<text>Nitty Gritty Dirt Band (sometimes abbreviated NGDB), also known as the Dirt Band, is an American band founded in Long Beach, California, in 1966. Since 2018, the band has consisted of Jeff Hanna and his son Jaime Hanna, both guitarists and vocalists, along with Jimmie Fadden (drums, harmonica, vocals), Bob Carpenter (keyboards, accordion, vocals), Ross Holmes (fiddle, mandolin, vocals), and Jim Photoglo (bass guitar, vocals).

Jeff Hanna and Fadden founded Nitty Gritty Dirt Band in 1966 with a lineup initially consisting of Bruce Kunkel, Ralph Barr, Les Thompson, and Jackson Browne, who quit early on and was replaced by longtime member John McEuen (vocals, guitar, banjo). The band had its first hit single in 1967 with &quot;Buy for Me the Rain&quot; on Liberty Records. Their earliest work featured jug band and traditional folk elements. In 1970, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band had their biggest pop hit with a cover of Jerry Jeff Walker&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Bojangles&quot;. Their sound took on elements of soft rock in the latter half of the 1970s and early 1980s, including the hit singles &quot;An American Dream&quot; and &quot;Make a Little Magic&quot;.

Starting in the early 1980s, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band began a shift toward country music, led off by the singles &quot;Shot Full of Love&quot; and &quot;Dance Little Jean&quot;. By this point, the band consisted of Jeff Hanna, McEuen, Fadden, Carpenter, and Jimmy Ibbotson (bass guitar, vocals). This lineup recorded several country albums for Warner Records throughout the 1980s and charted multiple singles on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs. Of these, &quot;Long Hard Road (The Sharecropper&#x27;s Dream)&quot;, &quot;Modern Day Romance&quot;, and &quot;Fishin&#x27; in the Dark&quot; all went to number one, with the latter becoming their signature song. After leaving Warner in the late 1980s, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band recorded for several other labels, including Universal, MCA Nashville, Rising Tide, and DreamWorks Records. They have collaborated with a number of artists, including Doc Watson, Linda Ronstadt, John Denver, and Steve Martin. In addition, Jeff Hanna co-wrote the song &quot;Bless the Broken Road&quot;, the most successful version of which was recorded by Rascal Flatts.

Nitty Gritty Dirt Band is also known for three collaborative albums: &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&quot; in 1972, &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken: Volume Two&quot; in 1989, and &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken, Volume III&quot; in 2002. All three albums featured a large number of guests from folk, rock, country, and bluegrass. They have also won three Grammy Awards. Critics have found influences of country, pop, rock, bluegrass, and folk music in their sound.

==History==

Nitty Gritty Dirt Band was founded in Long Beach, California, in 1966. Founding guitarist Jeff Hanna was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, but his family had moved to Long Beach four years prior. While in high school, he befriended guitarist Bruce Kunkel, and the two played in a local duo called the New Coast Two. As they wanted to form a larger group, the two began playing impromptu jam sessions at a Long Beach music shop called McCabe&#x27;s Guitar Shop. Through these performances, they recruited four other musicians. These were Jimmie Fadden, who at the time played washtub bass, harmonica, and guitar, along with Ralph Barr (guitar, clarinet), Les Thompson (guitar, mandolin), and Jackson Browne (guitar). All six members also served as vocalists. Browne quit the group after only a few months, and was replaced by John McEuen, who contributed on guitar, mandolin, banjo, and washtub bass. They briefly called themselves the Illegitimate Jug Band, due to their playing jug band music without actually having a member who played the jug. Soon afterward, they selected Nitty Gritty Dirt Band as a name. This name was inspired by their observation that many bands at the time had names which they considered long and unusual, such as Strawberry Alarm Clock.

===19671971: Early years===
John&#x27;s older brother William E. McEuen served as the band&#x27;s manager, helping to book them as opening acts for artists such as Joan Baez. He also helped the band sign a contract with Liberty Records, who released their self-titled debut album in 1967. &quot;Buy for Me the Rain&quot; was released as a single from this project, and it reached number 45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Another album for Liberty, &quot;Ricochet&quot;, followed later in 1967. After this album, Kunkel quit over creative differences in the band&#x27;s sound, and was replaced by multi-instrumentalist Chris Darrow, formerly a member of Kaleidoscope. Of their style at the time, Mary Campbell of the Associated Press noted their use of acoustic instruments and rudimentary traditional folk instruments such as washtub bass, kazoo, and comb and paper. She also noted that their clothing and song choices, such as a cover of &quot;Teddy Bears&#x27; Picnic&quot;, reflected the music and mindset of the 1920s.

Their third album, 1968&#x27;s &quot;Rare Junk&quot;, was their first to feature electric guitar, electric bass, and drums. Although Browne had left by this point, they covered his &quot;These Days&quot; on it. Johnny Sandlin contributed on drums. Bob Talbert of &quot;The State&quot; praised the album for the variety of instruments used, noting that said variety allowed influences of jazz and country music on top of the group&#x27;s existing jug band sound. A year later, Liberty released a live album titled &quot;Alive&quot;, recorded at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, California. That same year, the band contributed the song &quot;Hand Me Down That Can o&#x27; Beans&quot; to the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Paint Your Wagon&quot;, starring Lee Marvin. The band briefly broke up in late 1969. During this hiatus, Hanna and Darrow briefly founded a country rock band called the Corvettes, who recorded one session with Michael Nesmith of the Monkees as producer.

Nitty Gritty Dirt Band reunited in 1970, although Darrow and Barr declined to rejoin. Both were replaced by Jimmy Ibbotson, who played bass guitar, drums, piano, and accordion. After reuniting, the band issued its fourth Liberty album &quot;Uncle Charlie &amp; His Dog Teddy&quot; that same year. Colin Larkin, in the &quot;Virgin Encyclopedia of Country Music&quot;, wrote that this album marked a shift in their sound from &quot;jokey elements&quot; to a more country rock sound. It featured a cover of Jerry Jeff Walker&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Bojangles&quot;. Their version of the song was their first major hit, reaching number nine on the Hot 100. Also charting from the album were covers of Kenny Loggins&#x27;s &quot;House at Pooh Corner&quot; and Nesmith&#x27;s &quot;Some of Shelly&#x27;s Blues&quot;. Richie Unterberger of AllMusic wrote of this album, &quot;The group moved into a more accessible rock-oriented fusion of country, bluegrass, pop, and rock &amp; roll, relying primarily on smartly chosen covers...Few bands had incorporated instruments more commonly associated with country and bluegrass, particularly mandolin and banjo, as comfortably into a rock setting prior to this release, and their well-crafted harmonies help put the songs over for those not-steeped-in backwoods sounds.&quot;

===19721977: United Artists Records and &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&quot;===

Liberty Records merged with United Artists Records in 1972. Their first project for this label was 1972&#x27;s &quot;All the Good Times&quot;. The album had further cover songs on it, including Hank Williams&#x27;s &quot;Jambalaya (On the Bayou)&quot; and Doug Kershaw&#x27;s &quot;Diggy Liggy Lo&quot;, as well as another Jackson Browne cover, &quot;Jamaica&quot;. The former of these was issued as a single, but peaked in the lower end of the Hot 100. &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; writer Henry McNulty found the cover songs superior to the original cuts on the album, but criticized the inclusion of fake applause between tracks.

Also in 1972, the band traveled to Nashville, Tennessee, to record the album &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&quot;. This was a collaborative three-disc album featuring a number of country and bluegrass artists, such as Roy Acuff, Maybelle Carter, Earl Scruggs, and Doc Watson. Writing for &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, Robert Hillburn thought that the band showed appreciation for the music of the collaborators, and that the album would appeal to music fans who did not like the then-contemporary Nashville sound. The album also accounted for Nitty Gritty Dirt Band&#x27;s first entries on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs charts: a cover of Hank Williams&#x27;s &quot;I Saw the Light&quot; and the original &quot;Grand Ole Opry Song&quot;, respectively featuring guest vocals from Roy Acuff and Jimmy Martin. Following the commercial success of &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&quot;, they began touring across the United States and internationally. McEuen also began recording as a solo artist at this point, despite staying a member of the band. Larkin noted that critical reception of &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&quot; &quot;played an important role in breaking down mistrust between the country&#x27;s establishment and the emerging &#x27;long hair&#x27; practitioners.&quot; Similarly, Watson later attributed the album&#x27;s success to renewed interest in his music, particularly among fans of rock music who did not typically listen to folk and bluegrass. The &quot;I Saw the Light&quot; cover accounted for their first Grammy Award nomination, in the category of Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal; a year later, the album itself was nominated in the same category. In 1997, the project became their first album to be certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Their next album for United Artists was 1974&#x27;s &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes Forever&quot;. By this point, Thompson had left as well, leaving the band as a quartet. A cover of Johnny Horton&#x27;s &quot;The Battle of New Orleans&quot; charted from this project. The album, composed of both live and studio recordings, also featured interview segments by fiddle player Vassar Clements. Bruce Eder wrote that these elements made the album &quot;more than its money&#x27;s worth&quot; and capable of showing their mix of country and rock influences. A year later, they released &quot;Symphonion Dream&quot;, led off by a cover of the Everly Brothers&#x27;s &quot;All I Have to Do Is Dream&quot;. The album featured guest contributions from Linda Ronstadt, Leon Russell, and actor Gary Busey. Eder found influences of psychedelic rock and bluegrass in the instrumentation, highlighting the instrumentals, as well as in the other cover songs on the album such as Hank Williams&#x27;s &quot;Hey, Good Lookin&quot;. Ibbotson left the band after this album, after which point John Cable and Jackie Clark joined. These two alternated as bassists and guitarists. Soon after they joined, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band toured in the Soviet Union. The United States Department of State oversaw the tour, which lasted for 28 days. This was followed by their first greatest-hits package, &quot;Dirt, Silver and Gold&quot;, also in 1976.

===19781981: The Dirt Band and shift to soft rock===
In 1978, both Clark and Cable left, and the group shortened its name to the Dirt Band. McEuen said that the name change was due to disc jockeys not being comfortable with the longer name. Conversely, music writer Tom Roland attributed the name change to Chuck Morris, who had taken over as the band&#x27;s manager due to William E. McEuen becoming overwhelmed by the role. Also according to John McEuen, Clark left voluntarily, while he believes that Hanna &quot;got rid&quot; of Cable because he felt &quot;threatened&quot; by Cable&#x27;s songwriting ability. Joining Hanna, John McEuen, and Fadden as members were drummer Merel Bergante, bassist Richard Hathaway, and Al Garth, who played multiple instruments including saxophone and keyboards. The first release under the shortened name was 1978&#x27;s &quot;The Dirt Band&quot;. &quot;In for the Night&quot; reached the lower regions of the Hot 100 as a single from this project. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic considered the album to mark a shift in sound to a soft rock style. He thought the songs on the album were consistent in quality, but also that it would not appeal to fans of their earlier works. Also during 1978, the band appeared under the pseudonym the Toot Uncommons as backing musicians on comedian and actor Steve Martin&#x27;s novelty hit single &quot;King Tut&quot;. This appearance was due to William E. McEuen serving as producer on the track.

Their second album as the Dirt Band was 1979&#x27;s &quot;An American Dream&quot;. The album&#x27;s title track, written by Rodney Crowell, was released as a single in 1980. The song featured a backing vocal from Linda Ronstadt. It accounted for their second-highest Hot 100 peak of 13, and was also their first appearance on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country music charts since 1973. During the release of this album, Michael Buono took over for Bergante on drums, while Bob Carpenter joined as keyboardist. Next was 1980&#x27;s &quot;Make a Little Magic&quot;. Featuring backing vocals from Nicolette Larson, its title track was a number 25 hit on the Hot 100. Ken Paulson of the Fort Myers, Florida, &quot;News Press&quot; noted that, unlike their previous albums, it contained only one cover song; specifically, Cidny Bullens&#x27;s &quot;Anxious Heart&quot;. He opined that by focusing more on original material, the album showed the band members&#x27; strengths as songwriters and performers, and considered it their best album yet.

After this album, EMI eliminated the United Artists label and reopened Liberty Records, transferring them back to that label after a decade. Their first release upon returning to Liberty was 1981&#x27;s &quot;Jealousy&quot;. Most of the members wrote the songs on the album by themselves and Hanna co-produced the album. Also by this point, Vic Mastrionni had become the band&#x27;s drummer. &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; was released as a single. The title track was as well, but it did not chart. The album featured guest vocals from Rosemary Butler and Kenny Loggins. An uncredited review in the New Jersey &quot;Daily Record&quot; panned the album&#x27;s soft rock sound and lack of variety between tracks, as well as the songs on which Carpenter sang lead vocals. Likewise, Erlewine said that they &quot;never quite mustered&quot; the soft rock sound of the album, and criticized many of the songs for lacking hooks.

===19831984: Shift to country===

In the early 1980s, the band reverted its name to Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. This coincided with a membership change: Ibbotson rejoined in 1981 after a five-year hiatus, while Fadden began playing drums as well as harmonica. At the time, the other members of the quintet were Hanna, McEuen, and Carpenter. Roland also attributes the shift in sound and reversion of their name to Morris; McEuen also attributed both of these and the return of Ibbotson to the lineup as being decisions made by Morris. The first release to be successful on the country charts was &quot;Shot Full of Love&quot;, which went to number 19 on the Hot Country Songs charts in 1983. This was followed by Ibbotson&#x27;s composition &quot;Dance Little Jean&quot;, which went to number nine. Both were included on the album &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot;, their last after rejoining Liberty. This album was produced by Norbert Putnam and Richard Landis. This album marked a shift to country music, a move which Hanna attributed to changing tastes among fans of rock and pop music. McEuen, meanwhile, attributed the shift to country, return of Ibbotson to the lineup, and reversion of the name to Nitty Gritty Dirt Band as conditions agreed upon by Morris, who was seeking to make the band more successful again after the failure of &quot;Jealousy&quot;.

The band began recording their next album, &quot;Plain Dirt Fashion&quot;, while still on Liberty. However, Morris was uncertain if the label would promote the album properly, as it was the last one in their contract. As a result, they transferred to Warner Records, who released it in 1984. Furthering their move to country music, they also switched booking agents, which resulted in them opening shows for Ricky Skaggs and Hank Williams Jr. Paul Worley and Marshall Morgan served as producers on the project. According to Ibbotson, the band chose to switch producers after moving to Warner, as they thought Putnam&#x27;s and Landis&#x27;s production styles were not suitable for country. In addition to the five members, other contributors included Skaggs and Jerry Douglas. The project also included a cover of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Cadillac Ranch&quot;. The lead single was another Rodney Crowell composition, &quot;Long Hard Road (The Sharecropper&#x27;s Dream)&quot;, which in 1984 became their first number-one single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts. Also issued as singles were &quot;I Love Only You&quot; (written by Dave Loggins and Don Schlitz) and &quot;High Horse&quot; (written by Ibbotson), both of which were top-five country hits between late 1984 and early 1985. Writing for the Mattoon, Illinois, &quot;Journal Gazette&quot;, Rickey Ferguson found a country influence through the &quot;storytelling lyrics&quot; of &quot;Long Hard Road&quot;.

===19851987: Middle years with Warner===
Next on Warner was &quot;Partners, Brothers and Friends&quot; in 1985. The album&#x27;s lead single was &quot;Modern Day Romance&quot;, written by Kix Brooks, who would later become one-half of Brooks &amp; Dunn. Upon release, this song became Nitty Gritty Dirt Band&#x27;s second number-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts. Worley noted that the song had originally been submitted to them for inclusion on &quot;Plain Dirt Fashion&quot; but was rejected, and they chose to record it after it was submitted to them a second time. Also charting in the top ten from this album were &quot;Home Again in My Heart&quot; and the title track, which Hanna and Ibbotson co-wrote. While not released as a single, the album track &quot;Telluride&quot; (also written by Ibbotson) was made into a music video. Robert K. Oermann of &quot;The Tennessean&quot; noted that the lyrics of &quot;Partners, Brothers and Friends&quot; contained several references to the band&#x27;s career up to that point. Holly Gleason of &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; reviewed the album favorably, praising Hanna&#x27;s and Ibbotson&#x27;s lead vocals as well as the lyrics of the title track. Following in 1986 was their second greatest-hits package, &quot;Twenty Years of Dirt&quot;. It was accompanied by an anniversary concert tour of the same name, featuring a 10,000-person show in Denver, Colorado, with Michael Martin Murphey. The album included the new song &quot;Stand a Little Rain&quot;. Both this and a re-release of &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; were sent to country radio as singles, with both reaching top ten.

This was followed in 1987 by &quot;Hold On&quot;, led off by the single &quot;Baby&#x27;s Got a Hold on Me&quot;. It reached number two on the country charts upon release. Following it was their third and final number one, &quot;Fishin&#x27; in the Dark&quot;, written by Wendy Waldman and Jim Photoglo. Ed Bruce had recorded the song a year prior. For this album, they again switched producers to Josh Leo. He found &quot;Fishin&#x27; in the Dark&quot; when searching for songs, and upon hearing Photoglo&#x27;s demo of the song, immediately suggested the band record it. Hanna later described it as Nitty Gritty Dirt Band&#x27;s signature song and a popular song to play during the summertime. The song was certified gold as a music download in 2011, and increased to platinum in 2014. The album&#x27;s third and final single was &quot;Oh What a Love&quot;, also written by Ibbotson. Writing for the &quot;Palm Beach Post&quot;, Holly Gleason praised Leo&#x27;s &quot;perfectly pretty production&quot; and Ibbotson&#x27;s vocals on &quot;Fishin&#x27; in the Dark&quot;, while also finding influences of country rock and Cajun music on individual tracks. She also compared the track &quot;Joe Knows How to Live&quot; (later a number-one single for Eddy Raven) to &quot;An American Dream&quot;.

===19881989: Departure of John McEuen and &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken: Volume Two&quot;===
During promotion for &quot;Hold On&quot;, McEuen quit to raise his family. He was replaced by Bernie Leadon, formerly of the Eagles and Flying Burrito Brothers. Leadon&#x27;s only in-studio appearance with the band was on 1988&#x27;s &quot;Workin&#x27; Band&quot;. This project charted three singles within the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts: &quot;Workin&#x27; Man (Nowhere to Go)&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Lookin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Down That Road Tonight&quot;. Fadden wrote the former, while Hanna co-wrote the latter two. Leadon left after this album as well, reducing the lineup to a quartet of Fadden, Hanna, Carpenter, and Ibbotson. An uncredited review in &quot;The Tennessean&quot; praised the use of acoustic instruments and the &quot;crisp&quot; nature of Josh Leo&#x27;s production style, as well as the &quot;urgency&quot; of the singing.

In 1989, the band transferred to Universal Records, then a new country label started by producer Jimmy Bowen. Their only release for the label was &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken: Volume Two&quot;, a sequel album to their 1972 album &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&quot;. Like its predecessor, it featured a large number of guest musicians, including Johnny Cash, Earl Scruggs, Bruce Hornsby, Levon Helm, Marty Stuart, and Vince Gill. Many of the guests appeared on the title track, a cover of A. P. Carter&#x27;s &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&quot;. Earl Scruggs&#x27;s son, Randy, produced the album. The album featured over 200 guests in total, and was recorded between December 1988 and January 1989. Universal simultaneously released three songs as lead singles from the project. These were a cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Going Nowhere&quot; featuring Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman on lead vocals, as well as the original compositions &quot;Turn of the Century&quot; and &quot;And So It Goes&quot;, the latter a collaboration with John Denver. The Dylan cover, credited solely to McGuinn and Hillman, peaked at number six on the country charts upon release. The other two singles were less successful, but follow-up &quot;When It&#x27;s Gone&quot; peaked at number ten, becoming their last top-40 country single. Released last from the project was &quot;One Step over the Line&quot;, featuring guest vocals from Rosanne Cash and John Hiatt. The album won the Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, the track &quot;The Valley Road&quot; (a collaboration with Hornsby) won Best Bluegrass Recording, and the title track was nominated for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals at the 32nd Grammy Awards in 1990. &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&quot; also won Album of the Year from the Country Music Association, their only win from that organization.

===1990s: Label changes===
After Universal closed, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band transferred to MCA Nashville Records for 1990&#x27;s &quot;The Rest of the Dream&quot;. Randy Scruggs also produced this project, and Carpenter observed that the track &quot;Wishing Well&quot; was the first time every band member wrote a song together. Serving as lead single was another Bruce Springsteen cover, this time of &quot;From Small Things (Big Things One Day Come)&quot;. Neither this song nor &quot;You Make Life Good Again&quot; was successful on the charts. Hanna later stated that covering &quot;From Small Things&quot; and recording a song written by every member of the band were both objectives of his for nearly a decade prior. Bruce Mason of &quot;The Province&quot; praised the use of mandolin in the production, as well as the number of John Hiatt cover songs.

This project was followed in 1992 by &quot;Live Two Five&quot;, a live album recorded a year prior in Alberta, Canada. The band returned to Liberty a third time for 1992&#x27;s &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;, titled after a cover of the Buddy Holly song &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;. Suzy Bogguss provided guest vocals on the track &quot;Don&#x27;t Underestimate Love&quot;. This project charted the singles &quot;I Fought the Law&quot; (a cover of the Bobby Fuller Four) and &quot;One Good Love&quot;. It also included covers of Merle Haggard&#x27;s &quot;Mama Tried&quot; and the Dennis Linde composition &quot;What&#x27;ll You Do About Me&quot;, previously recorded by Randy Travis and later a single for Doug Supernaw in 1995. Writing for the Elmira, New York &quot;Star-Gazette&quot;, Dennis Miller praised the covers in particular, as well as the vocal harmony and &quot;uncluttered musical arrangements.&quot;

Next on Liberty was 1994&#x27;s &quot;Acoustic&quot;, composed entirely of acoustic songs. Jim Newsom of AllMusic called the album &quot;refreshingly unadorned&quot; and praised the use of instruments such as Dobro and accordion. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; writer Bob Cannon was less favorable, writing, &quot;They’re always competent, with shimmering three-part harmonies and stellar musicianship, but that doesn’t compensate for their generally forgettable songwriting.&quot; The album&#x27;s closing track is &quot;Bless the Broken Road&quot;, which Hanna wrote with Bobby Boyd and Marcus Hummon. Hummon later recorded the song himself, as did Melodie Crittenden, whose version was a charted single in 1998. Rascal Flatts also covered the song in 2005 and took their version to number one on the country charts, while Crittenden also charted the song a second time as a collaboration with the Christian group Selah.

The band released no further projects until 1997&#x27;s &quot;The Christmas Album&quot; on Rising Tide Records. This project contained a mix of traditional Christmas songs and new material mostly written by the band members. While on Rising Tide, they recorded another album titled &quot;Bang Bang Bang&quot;, whose title track charted ahead of the album&#x27;s release. However, the album was delayed due to the closure of Rising Tide and transferred to Decca Records, which also closed before it could be released. It was ultimately issued in 1998 through DreamWorks Records, which also re-released the title track and caused it to chart a second time. The project included a cover of Mac McAnally&#x27;s &quot;Down the Road&quot;, previously a single for him in 1990 and later re-released in 2008 as a duet between him and Kenny Chesney. An uncredited review of the album in &quot;Billboard&quot; called the project &quot;entertainingly quirky&quot;. George Hauenstein of Country Standard Time spoke favorably of the variety of songwriters, which included Jim Lauderdale, Dennis Linde, and Hanna&#x27;s wife, Matraca Berg. He also wrote that &quot;record label trouble&quot; had kept them from being more successful in the 1990s.

===21st century: &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken, Volume III&quot;, membership changes, and farewell tour===

McEuen rejoined the band in 2001, shortly before the release of their third collaborative album, &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken, Volume III&quot;, in 2002. This album featured further guests such as Dwight Yoakam, Tom Petty, and Iris DeMent. Collaborators from the previous &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&quot; albums returned as well, such as Doc Watson and Johnny Cash. Robert L. Doerschuk of AllMusic thought the album felt less collaborative than the previous two, due to a lack of chemistry between certain performers. Corresponding with both this album&#x27;s release and the 30th anniversary of the first &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&quot; album, they joined Earl and Randy Scruggs, Vassar Clements, and Jerry Douglas for a live concert aired on PBS and titled &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken: Farther Along.&quot; All of the artists performed a live rendition of &quot;Earl&#x27;s Breakdown&quot;. This rendition accounted for Nitty Gritty Dirt Band&#x27;s third Grammy Award win, in the category of Best Country Instrumental Performance.

Next in 2004 was &quot;Welcome to Woody Creek&quot; on Dualtone Records. This album was recorded at a studio owned by Ibbotson in Woody Creek, Colorado. Dan MacIntosh of Country Standard Time wrote, &quot;Such an idyllic setting may well have inspired the warmth and friendliness of this bluegrass-tinged album.&quot; Ibbotson left the band just before 2009&#x27;s &quot;Speed of Life&quot;, a self-released project. George Massenburg and Jon Randall produced the album. In Ibbotson&#x27;s absence, session musician Glenn Worf played bass, while Randall and Berg were among the backing vocalists. A review for Country Standard Time said of this album that it &quot;isn&#x27;t breaking much new ground, but it sounds like an album the boys in the band had a lot of fun making, and that fun translates well to the listening.&quot;

To honor their 50th anniversary, the band played a special concert at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville. The concert was also released as a live album and DVD titled &quot;Circlin&#x27; Back: Celebrating 50 Years&quot;. It included guests John Prine, Sam Bush, Vince Gill, Jerry Jeff Walker, Alison Krauss, Rodney Crowell, Byron House, Jerry Douglas, and Jackson Browne in addition to former member Ibbotson. The special also aired on PBS and was later packaged as a live CD and DVD titled &quot;Circlin’ Back: Celebrating 50 Years&quot; in 2016. An uncredited &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; review stated that the original release &quot;helped knock down barriers then separating the traditional country and rock music communities, setting the stage for the eventual emergence of what came to be known as Americana music&quot;.

Following the end of their anniversary tour in 2017, McEuen exited again, citing creative differences. This left just Hanna, Carpenter, and Fadden as members. In response to this, they hired three new members in 2018. These were Ross Holmes on fiddle and mandolin, Jeff Hanna&#x27;s son Jaime Hanna on guitar, and Jim Photoglo on bass guitar. Prior to joining the band, Jaime Hanna had been a touring guitarist for the Mavericks; he also performed with John McEuen&#x27;s son Jonathan in the duo Hanna-McEuen, and later as a member of Gary Allan&#x27;s road band. Holmes had previously been a touring musician for Mumford &amp; Sons. Photoglo had been a friend of the members for several years prior, and wrote &quot;Fishin&#x27; in the Dark&quot; almost 30 years before he joined. With this lineup in place, the band recorded a Bob Dylan covers album, &quot;Dirt Does Dylan&quot;, in 2022 with Ray Kennedy as producer. The first single was a cover of &quot;The Times They Are a-Changin&#x27;&quot;, featuring guest vocals from the War and Treaty, Rosanne Cash, Jason Isbell, and Steve Earle. All proceeds from this version were donated to Feeding America. Larkin Poe also joined the band on a cover of &quot;I Shall Be Released&quot;. Hanna told &quot;Billboard&quot; he wanted to release a Dylan cover album for many years due to him being a longtime fan of Dylan&#x27;s music. Dan McIntosh of Country Standard Time noted that while the project mostly contained &quot;familiar tunes&quot;, he considered the arrangements indicative of Dylan&#x27;s influence on country.

In January 2024, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band began their farewell tour For the Good Times, starting with a concert in Bowling Green, Kentucky, and lasting throughout 2024. Several stops on the tour included Isbell as an opening act.

==Musical styles==
Nitty Gritty Dirt Band&#x27;s music encompasses a wide variety of styles. Colin Larkin, in &quot;The Virgin Encyclopedia of Country Music&quot;, wrote that their early albums contained jug band and Vaudeville influences, while by the release of &quot;Uncle Charlie and His Dog Teddy&quot;, they &quot;abandoned the jokey elements...[and] pursued a career as purveyors of superior country rock.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s Mark Deming spoke similarly of their early material, noting influences of bluegrass in the &quot;Mr. Bojangles&quot; cover as well as the tracks from the first &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&quot; album. He also defined the band&#x27;s late-1970s output as soft rock, and that their 1990s and 21st-century material was indebted to American folk music. On the same site, Stephen Thomas Erlewine also noticed influences of soft rock on &quot;The Dirt Band&quot;. Rickey Ferguson wrote the country influences were more evident on &quot;Plain Dirt Fashion&quot; due to the use of instruments such as fiddle and mandolin. Holly Gleason noted the twang evident in Hanna&#x27;s and Ibbotson&#x27;s singing voices, and thought the rhythm sections were stronger than usual for a country band.

During the release of &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&quot;, the members were noted for their long-haired appearance, which was considered counter to the appearances of country music acts at the time. Bill Monroe was said to have refused an offer to appear on the album, and Roy Acuff was initially apprehensive before joining. The band said that an impetus behind their shift to country music in the 1980s was the lack of a successful pop song after &quot;An American Dream&quot; and &quot;Make a Little Magic&quot;, followed by a realization that members of the country music community in Nashville were still fans of their music. They also thought that the first two &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&quot; projects helped to &quot;dim the lines&quot; between pop and country, especially since the genre of country rock was still new when the first one was recorded. Walter Tunis of the &quot;Lexington Herald-Leader&quot; thought that of them as an early example of the California-based country rock movement of the 1970s furthered by bands such as the Flying Burrito Brothers and Eagles, and that such a comparison was furthered when Leadon, a former member of both bands, joined. He also thought that their success in country in the 1980s was more indebted to marketing and changes in taste from listeners more so than a shift in sound within the band itself. Leadon also stated that he heard influences of the Eagles within the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band&#x27;s songs. Jim Wensits of &quot;The South Bend Tribune&quot; described them as a &quot;coming force in country rock&quot; during the success of &quot;Mr. Bojangles&quot;, and added that they &quot;confounded critics by refusing to be categorized.&quot; He also thought that the band&#x27;s sound during the 1970s was comparable to the Eagles, and that some songs such as their cover of &quot;Jambalaya&quot; featured influences of Cajun music.

In a 2022 concert review, Jeffrey B. Remz of Country Standard Time opined that Jeff Hanna&#x27;s &quot;voice was well intact at 75&quot; and that he had &quot;an affable, easy going stage presence.&quot; He also noted that Jaime Hanna, Carpenter, and Fadden occasionally sang lead vocals as well. He also praised the use of fiddle and mandolin in their live settings.

<doc id="404926" wikidata="Q1628597" url="?curid=404926" title="Analysis of covariance">
<text>Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) is a general linear model that blends ANOVA and regression. ANCOVA evaluates whether the means of a dependent variable (DV) are equal across levels of one or more categorical independent variables (IV) and across one or more continuous variables. For example, the categorical variable(s) might describe treatment and the continuous variable(s) might be covariates (CV)&#x27;s, typically nuisance variables; or vice versa. Mathematically, ANCOVA decomposes the variance in the DV into variance explained by the CV(s), variance explained by the categorical IV, and residual variance. Intuitively, ANCOVA can be thought of as &#x27;adjusting&#x27; the DV by the group means of the CV(s).

The ANCOVA model assumes a linear relationship between the response (DV) and covariate (CV):

formula_1

In this equation, the DV, formula_2 is the jth observation under the ith categorical group; the CV, formula_3 is the &quot;j&quot;th observation of the covariate under the &quot;i&quot;th group. Variables in the model that are derived from the observed data are formula_4 (the grand mean) and formula_5 (the global mean for covariate formula_6). The variables to be fitted are formula_7 (the effect of the &quot;i&quot;th level of the categorical IV), formula_8 (the slope of the line) and formula_9 (the associated unobserved error term for the &quot;j&quot;th observation in the &quot;i&quot;th group).

Under this specification, the categorical treatment effects sum to zero formula_10 The standard assumptions of the linear regression model are also assumed to hold, as discussed below.

==Example==

In an agricultural study, ANCOVA can be used to analyze the effect of different fertilizers (formula_7) on crop yield (formula_2), while accounting for soil quality (formula_3) as a covariate. Soil quality, a continuous variable, influences crop yield and may vary across plots, potentially confounding the results.

The model adjusts yield measurements for soil quality differences and evaluates whether fertilizer types differ significantly. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

formula_14

where:
* formula_2 is the crop yield for the formula_16-th plot under the formula_17-th fertilizer type,
* formula_4 is the grand mean crop yield,
* formula_7 represents the effect of the formula_17-th fertilizer type, subject to the constraint formula_21 for identifiability,
* formula_22 is the slope of the regression line representing the relationship between soil quality and crop yield,
* formula_3 is the soil quality for the formula_16-th plot under the formula_17-th fertilizer type, and formula_5 is the global mean soil quality,
* formula_9 is the residual error term, assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 and variance formula_28.

In this setup, ANCOVA partitions the total variance in crop yield into variance explained by soil quality (covariate), variance explained by fertilizer type (categorical IV), and residual variance. By adjusting for soil quality, ANCOVA provides a more precise estimate of the fertilizer effect on crop yield. The constraint formula_29 ensures that the categorical variable&#x27;s effects are centered around zero, allowing for meaningful interpretation of group differences. It is standard in ANOVA and ANCOVA with categorical variables.
==Uses==
===Increase power===
ANCOVA can be used to increase statistical power (the probability a significant difference is found between groups when one exists) by reducing the within-group error variance. In order to understand this, it is necessary to understand the test used to evaluate differences between groups, the F-test. The &quot;F&quot;-test is computed by dividing the explained variance between groups (e.g., medical recovery differences) by the unexplained variance within the groups. Thus,
:formula_30
If this value is larger than a critical value, we conclude that there is a significant difference between groups. Unexplained variance includes error variance (e.g., individual differences), as well as the influence of other factors. Therefore, the influence of CVs is grouped in the denominator. When we control for the effect of CVs on the DV, we remove it from the denominator making &quot;F&quot; larger, thereby increasing our power to find a significant effect if one exists at all.

===Adjusting preexisting differences===
Another use of ANCOVA is to adjust for preexisting differences in nonequivalent (intact) groups. This controversial application aims at correcting for initial group differences (prior to group assignment) that exists on DV among several intact groups. In this situation, participants cannot be made equal through random assignment, so CVs are used to adjust scores and make participants more similar than without the CV. However, even with the use of covariates, there are no statistical techniques that can equate unequal groups. Furthermore, the CV may be so intimately related to the categorical IV that removing the variance on the DV associated with the CV would remove considerable variance on the DV, rendering the results meaningless.

==Assumptions==
There are several key assumptions that underlie the use of ANCOVA and affect interpretation of the results. The standard linear regression assumptions hold; further we assume that the slope of the covariate is equal across all treatment groups (homogeneity of regression slopes).

===Assumption 1: linearity of regression ===
The regression relationship between the dependent variable and concomitant variables must be linear.

===Assumption 2: homogeneity of error variances===
The error is a random variable with conditional zero mean and equal variances for different treatment classes and observations.

===Assumption 3: independence of error terms===
The errors are uncorrelated. That is, the error covariance matrix is diagonal.
===Assumption 4: normality of error terms===
The residuals (error terms) should be normally distributed formula_9 ~ formula_32.

===Assumption 5: homogeneity of regression slopes===
The slopes of the different regression lines should be equivalent, i.e., regression lines should be parallel among groups.

The fifth issue, concerning the homogeneity of different treatment regression slopes is particularly important in evaluating the appropriateness of ANCOVA model. Also note that we only need the error terms to be normally distributed. In fact both the independent variable and the concomitant variables will not be normally distributed in most cases.

==Conducting an ANCOVA ==
===Test multicollinearity===
If a CV is highly related to another CV (at a correlation of 0.5 or more), then it will not adjust the DV over and above the other CV. One or the other should be removed since they are statistically redundant.

===Test the homogeneity of variance assumption===
Tested by Levene&#x27;s test of equality of error variances.
This is most important after adjustments have been made, but if you have it before adjustment you are likely to have it afterwards.

===Test the homogeneity of regression slopes assumption===
To see if the CV significantly interacts with the categorical IV, run an ANCOVA model including both the IV and the CVxIV interaction term. 
If the CVxIV interaction is significant, ANCOVA should not be performed. Instead, Green &amp; Salkind suggest assessing group differences on the DV at particular levels of the CV. Also consider using a moderated regression analysis, treating the CV and its interaction as another IV. Alternatively, one could use mediation analyses to determine if the CV accounts for the IV&#x27;s effect on the DV.

===Run ANCOVA analysis===
If the CV×IV interaction is not significant, rerun the ANCOVA without the CV×IV interaction term. 
In this analysis, you need to use the adjusted means and adjusted mean squared error. The adjusted means (also referred to as least squares means, LS means, estimated marginal means, or EMM) refer to the group means after controlling for the influence of the CV on the DV.
===Follow-up analyses===
If there was a significant main effect, it means that there is a significant difference between the levels of one categorical IV, ignoring all other factors. To find exactly which levels are significantly different from one another, one can use the same follow-up tests as for the ANOVA.
If there are two or more IVs, there may be a significant interaction, which means that the effect of one IV on the DV changes depending on the level of another factor. One can investigate the simple main effects using the same methods as in a factorial ANOVA.

==Power considerations==
While the inclusion of a covariate into an ANOVA generally increases statistical power by accounting for some of the variance in the dependent variable and thus increasing the ratio of variance explained by the independent variables, adding a covariate into ANOVA also reduces the degrees of freedom. Accordingly, adding a covariate which accounts for very little variance in the dependent variable might actually reduce power.

<doc id="404928" wikidata="Q3316148" url="?curid=404928" title="R. D. Blackmore">
<text>Richard Doddridge Blackmore (7 June 1825 – 20 January 1900), known as R. D. Blackmore, was one of the most famous English novelists of the second half of the nineteenth century. He won acclaim for vivid descriptions and personification of the countryside, sharing with Thomas Hardy a Western England background and a strong sense of regional setting in his works.

Blackmore, often referred to as the &quot;Last Victorian&quot;, was a pioneer of the movement in fiction that continued with Robert Louis Stevenson and others. He has been described as &quot;proud, shy, reticent, strong-willed, sweet-tempered, and self-centred.&quot; Apart from his novel &quot;Lorna Doone&quot;, which has enjoyed continuing popularity, his work has gone out of print.

He was also a barrister, as per his census entry for 1881 in the National Census of England and Wales, at the age of 55, with his residence listed in Teddington, Middlesex.

== Biography ==

Richard Doddridge Blackmore was born on 7 June 1825 at Longworth in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), one year after his elder brother Henry (1824–1875), where his father, John Blackmore, was curate-in-charge of the parish. His mother died a few months after his birth—the victim of an outbreak of typhus which had occurred in the village. After this loss John Blackmore moved to Bushey, Herts, then to his native Devon, first to Kings Nympton, then Culmstock, Tor Mohun and later to Ashford, in the same county. Richard, however, was taken by his aunt, Mary Frances Knight, and after her marriage to the Rev. Richard Gordon, moved with her to Elsfield rectory, near Oxford. His father married again in 1831, whereupon Richard returned to live with him. Having spent much of his childhood in the lush and pastoral &quot;Doone Country&quot; of Exmoor, and along the Badgworthy Water (where there is now a memorial stone in Blackmore&#x27;s honour), Blackmore came to love the very countryside he immortalised in &quot;Lorna Doone&quot;.

=== Scholarly career ===
In 1837, Blackmore entered Blundell&#x27;s School in Tiverton. He excelled in classical studies, and later won a scholarship to Exeter College, Oxford, where he took his degree in 1847.
During a university vacation he made his first attempt at writing a novel. This was the beginning of &quot;The Maid of Sker&quot;—not, in fact, completed until many years later, and eventually published in 1872—which he himself would come to consider his finest novel.

After leaving Oxford and spending some time as a private tutor, Blackmore decided on a career in law. He entered the Middle Temple in 1849 and was called to the Bar in 1852. Ill-health, however, prevented him from continuing legal work as a full-time occupation and in 1854, he took the post of classics master at Wellesley House Grammar School, Hampton Road, Twickenham. In later years this became the Metropolitan and City of London Police Orphanage and then Fortescue House School. Soon after accepting this position, he moved from London to No. 25 Lower Teddington Road, Hampton Wick—where he lived until he moved to his new home in Teddington.

=== Marriage ===
Blackmore was married on 8 November 1853 at Trinity Church, Holborn, to Lucy Maguire. She was 26, a Roman Catholic and said to be somewhat delicate; they never had any children. They were both fond of her sister Agnes&#x27; four children and often had them to stay. As well as helping with their education, the Blackmores seem to have adopted Eva when she was 7. Theirs was described by Blackmore&#x27;s sister as a &quot;happy marriage.&quot;

=== Move to the country ===
In September 1857, Blackmore&#x27;s uncle, the Rev. H.H. Knight, Rector of Neath, Glamorgan, died and left his nephew a sum of money which enabled him to realise a long-held ambition of possessing a house in the country encompassed by a large garden. Blackmore&#x27;s father encouraged him in the scheme and helped him to carry it into effect.

==== Fruit-growing business ====
The land selected was a plot at Teddington which Blackmore had seen and admired for some time. Here he built his new house—completed in 1860—in which he lived for the rest of his life. He called it Gomer House after one of his favourite dogs, a Gordon Spaniel. In the extensive grounds he created an market garden specialising in the cultivation of fruit. The grounds were surrounded by high walls which served to keep out thieves and to aid the ripening of tender fruit. His knowledge of horticulture was extensive, but through competition and other factors, the business was not a very lucrative enterprise except in his supply of pears to Covent Garden. However, he is believed to have held the view that he preferred to be remembered as the winner of first prize for swedes than as the author of &quot;Lorna Doone&quot;.

==== Fight for environment ====
At the time Blackmore came to Teddington, the railway had not yet disturbed its quiet rural atmosphere. Before long, however, plans were in hand for the purchase of land and the construction of lines. In 1868, Blackmore won a fight against the claims made on his property by the London and South Western Railway Company, but he was unable to prevent the building of the railway station almost directly opposite his house.

=== His works, his reputation, and death ===
Blackmore began a career as writer by publishing collections of poetry, before turning to novel-writing. His third novel, which became his best known and most successful, &quot;Lorna Doone&quot; (1869), established him in the front rank of British novelists of that time. With it, he pioneered a new romantic movement in English fiction. The novel&#x27;s overwhelming popularity was only secured when it appeared as a one-volume edition, as distinct from the unsuccessful three-volume form in which it was originally published. However, Blackmore was of the view that it had become popular quite by accident when a book reviewer had incorrectly stated that the book was about the forefathers of Lord Lorne who had recently married Princess Louise. Hardy would write to Blackmore expressing his appreciation of the book; but the two men were divided by a certain rivalry as well as differences in temperament and opinions. Various attempts were made to dramatise &quot;Lorna Doone,&quot; but Blackmore only authorised one and that was from the pen of Horace Newte.

Blackmore followed Sir Walter Scott in often setting his characters against a significant historical background, as with &quot;Springhaven&quot; (1887) and the Napoleonic Wars; his descriptive powers perhaps exceeded his narrative structures.

Some local residents in Teddington regarded Blackmore as somewhat unsociable, if not misanthropic. Charles Deayton, a Teddington merchant, is recorded as stating to a visitor—

&quot;He is not a social man, and seems wedded to his garden in summer and his book writing in winter. That is all I know about him; except that he keeps the most vicious dogs to protect his fruit, and I would advise you to avoid the risk [of visiting him].&quot;

This statement gives a rather distorted picture of Blackmore&#x27;s character. Although he was of a retiring disposition, preoccupied with the demands of writing and fruit growing, he did, in fact, have a number of very intimate friends whom he met regularly. His works had a wide following in the United States and during his life he formed many friendships with Americans.

His wife&#x27;s health began to deteriorate and became critical by the beginning of January 1888, and she died at the end of that month. The funeral was held on 3 February 1888 in Teddington Parish Church, and she was buried in Teddington Cemetery. After her death, Blackmore was looked after by her nieces, Eva and Adalgisa Pinto-Leite. Blackmore died at Teddington on 20 January 1900 after a long and painful illness, and was buried next to his wife, as per his request. His final letter was to his sister Ellen, who likewise was suffering a terminal illness. Blackmore movingly ended his short Christmas letter of 1899 as follows:

&quot;I have fallen away during the last month, having taken obstinate chills, &amp; caring neither to eat nor drink, nor speak. All my energy &amp; spirit are abated, &amp; often I know not where I am. – E. &amp; D. join me in kindest love, &amp; I am always&quot;

&quot;PS Frost coming, I fear – don&#x27;t like the look of it[.]&quot;

Upon his death at the age of 74, a well-attended funeral in Teddington Cemetery, conducted by his old friend, the Reverend Robert Borland, was held in his honour. Four years after his death, in April 1904, a memorial to him was established in Exeter Cathedral. The result of work by a committee including his good friend, Thomas Hardy, Rudyard Kipling, and James Barrie, it bore an address written by another writer from Devon, Eden Phillpotts, and the portrait was carved by Harry Hems of Exeter. A reduced copy of the memorial was also mounted in Oare Church in Somerset, where Lorna Doone was married; above it in the cathedral was a stained glass window depicting David, Jonathan, and Samson—the archetypes of courage, love, and strength, respectively. John Ridd and Lorna Doone are cast at the top of the window, not far from Carver Doone.

=== After death ===
Blackmore&#x27;s two nieces continued to live in Gomer House; Amelia died in 1911 and was also buried in the Blackmore grave. Then in October 1938 there was an auction of all its contents, which included Blackmore&#x27;s own library containing first editions of his works. The house itself was later demolished and Doone Close, Blackmore&#x27;s Grove and Gomer Gardens were built, referencing the novelist&#x27;s associations with Teddington. The end of Doone Close marks the approximate site of Gomer House. Blackmore&#x27;s market garden covered the area between the present Station Road and Field Lane.

<text>Soyuz 28 (, &quot;Union 28&quot;) was a March 1978 Soviet crewed mission to the orbiting Salyut 6 space station. It was the fourth mission to the station, the third successful docking, and the second visit to the resident crew launched in Soyuz 26.

Cosmonaut Vladimír Remek from Czechoslovakia became the first person launched into space who was not a citizen of the United States or the Soviet Union. The other crew member was Aleksei Gubarev. The flight was the first mission in the Intercosmos program that gave Eastern Bloc and other communist states access to space through crewed and uncrewed launches.

==Mission highlights==
The Soyuz 28 mission was the first Intercosmos flight, whereby military pilots from Soviet bloc nations were flown on flights of about eight days to a Soviet space station. Pilots from other nations would eventually also fly. The program was a reaction to American plans to fly Western Europeans on Space Shuttle missions.

Vladimir Remek, the first non-Soviet, non-American to travel to space, was launched aboard Soyuz 28 on 2 March 1978, after a three-day delay of unspecified cause. The Soyuz commander was Soviet cosmonaut Aleksei Gubarev. The crew docked with the orbiting Salyut 6 space station, and greeted the occupants Georgi Grechko and Yuri Romanenko who had arrived on Soyuz 26 in December. Gubarev and Grechko had previously flown together on Soyuz 17 to the Salyut 4 space station in 1975.

The day after the docking, the Soyuz 26 crew celebrated their breaking of the space endurance record of 84 days, set by the Skylab 4 crew in 1974.

While the mission had a political purpose, scientific experiments were carried out, including one which monitored the growth of chlorella algae in zero gravity, another which used the on-board Splav furnace to melt glass, lead, silver, and copper chlorides, and an experiment called Oxymeter which measured oxygen in human tissue.

On 10 March, the Soyuz 28 crew prepared for their return to Earth, packing experiments and testing systems. They undocked from the station and landed west of Tselinograd later that day.

A joke appeared soon after the mission that Remek&#x27;s hand had mysteriously turned red. He informed the doctors, the joke goes, that this was because every time he went to touch something, the Soviet crewmembers would slap his hand and yell, &quot;Don&#x27;t touch that!&quot;

<text>In international relations, the liberal international order (LIO), also known as rules-based order (RBO), describes a set of global, rule-based, structured relationships based on political liberalism, economic liberalism and liberal internationalism since the late 1940s. More specifically, it entails international cooperation through multilateral institutions (like the United Nations, World Trade Organization and International Monetary Fund) and is constituted by human equality (freedom, rule of law and human rights), open markets, security cooperation, promotion of liberal democracy, and monetary cooperation. The order was established in the aftermath of World War II, led in large part by the United States.

The nature of the LIO, as well as its very existence, has been debated by scholars. The LIO has been credited with expanding free trade, increasing capital mobility, spreading democracy, promoting human rights, and collectively defending the West from the Soviet Union. The LIO facilitated unprecedented cooperation among the states of North America, Western Europe and Japan. Over time, the LIO facilitated the spread of economic liberalism to the rest of the world, as well as helped consolidate democracy in formerly fascist or communist countries.

Origins of the LIO have commonly been identified as the 1940s, usually starting in 1945, with some scholars pointing to earlier agreements between the WWII-era Allies such as the Atlantic Charter in 1941. John Mearsheimer has dissented with this view, arguing that the LIO only arose after the end of the Cold War, since in his theory liberal international order is possible only in a unipolar World. Core founding members of the LIO include the states of North America, Western Europe and Japan; these states form a security community. The characteristics of the LIO have varied over time. Some scholars refer to a Cold War variation of the LIO largely limited to the West, and a post-Cold War variation having a more widespread scope and giving international institutions more powers.

Aspects of the LIO are challenged internally within liberal states by populism, protectionism and nativism. Scholars have argued that embedded liberalism (or the logics inherent in the Double Movement) are key to maintaining public support for the planks of the LIO; some scholars have raised questions whether aspects of embedded liberalism have been undermined, thus leading to a backlash against the LIO.

Externally, the LIO is challenged by authoritarian states, illiberal states, and states that are discontented with their roles in world politics. China, Russia, Iran and North Korea have been characterized as prominent challengers to the LIO. Some scholars have argued that the LIO contains self-undermining aspects that could trigger backlash or collapse.

== Definition ==
Minimalist definitions of the LIO characterize it as “open and rules-based international order” while maximalist definitions include liberal social purpose, economic and political rights, and democratic decision-making procedures.

David Lake, Lisa Martin and Thomas Risse define &quot;order&quot; as &quot;patterned or structured relationships among units&quot;. Interactions in the LIO are structured by rules, norms and decision-making procedures. They note that the LIO is not synonymous with a &quot;rule-based international order&quot;, as non-liberal rule-based orders may exist (such as the Westphalian order). Others refer to the LIO as the rules-based international order (RBIO), or the rules-based order (RBO). 

Lake, Martin and Risse define &quot;liberal&quot; as a belief in the universal equality of individuals, as well as individual and collective freedoms. Political liberalism entails the rule of law, and the sovereign equality of states, as well as protections for human rights, political rights and civil liberties. Economic liberalism entails free market-oriented policies. Liberal internationalism entails principled multilateralism and global governance.

Michael Barnett defines an international order as &quot;patterns of relating and acting&quot; derived from and maintained by rules, institutions, law and norms. International orders have both a material and social component. Legitimacy (the generalized perception that actions are desirable, proper or appropriate) is essential to political orders. George Lawson has defined an international order as &quot;regularized practices of exchange among discrete political units that recognize each other to be independent.&quot; John Mearsheimer defines an international order as &quot;an organized group of international institutions that help govern the interactions among the member states.&quot;

In &quot;After Victory&quot; (2001), John Ikenberry defines a political order as &quot;the governing arrangements among a group of states, including its fundamental rules, principles and institutions.&quot; Political orders are established when the basic organizing arrangements are set up, and they break down when the basic organizing arrangements are overturned, contested or in disarray. He defines a constitutional international order as a political order &quot;organized around agreed-upon legal and political institutions that operate to allocate rights and limit the exercise of power.&quot; There are four main core elements of constitutional orders:

# Shared agreement about the rules of the game within the order
# Rules and institutions that bind and limit the exercise of power
# Institutional autonomy from special interests
# The entrenchment of these rules and institutions with a broader, immutable political system.
In 2018, Ikenberry defined the liberal international order as:multilayered, multifaceted, and not simply a political formation imposed by the leading state. International order is not “one thing” that states either join or resist. It is an aggregation of various sorts of ordering rules and institutions. There are the deep rules and norms of sovereignty... There is a sprawling array of international institutions, regimes, treaties, agreements, protocols, and so forth. These governing arrangements cut across diverse realms, including security and arms control, the world economy, the environment and global commons, human rights, and political relations. Some of these domains of governance may have rules and institutions that narrowly reflect the interests of the hegemonic state, but most reflect negotiated outcomes based on a much broader set of interests. Charles Glaser has disputed the analytical value of the concept of the LIO, arguing that the concept is so broad and vague that &quot;almost any international situation qualifies as an international order, so long as its members accept the sovereignty norm.&quot; Some critics of the LIO, such as John Mearsheimer, have argued that liberal democracy promotion and hyper-globalization are elements of the LIO.

Jeff Colgan has characterized the liberal international order as the theme that unites multiple subsystems in the international system. These subsystems can experience drastic change without fundamentally changing the liberal international order.

== Debates ==
The debate about liberal international order has grown especially prominent in International Relations. Daniel Deudney and John Ikenberry list five components of this international order: security co-binding, in which great powers demonstrate restraint; the open nature of US hegemony and the dominance of reciprocal transnational relations; the presence of self-limiting powers like Germany and Japan; the availability of mutual gains due to &quot;the political foundations of economic openness&quot;; and the role of Western &quot;civil identity.&quot; According to Charles Glaser, there are five key mechanisms in the LIO: &quot;democracy, hierarchy built on legitimate authority, institutional binding, economic interdependence, and political convergence.&quot;

The more supportive views of scholars such as Ikenberry have drawn criticism from scholars who have examined the imperial and colonial legacies of liberal international institutions. The contributions of non-Western actors to the formation of the liberal international order have also recently gained attention from scholars advancing global International Relations theory. In the case of Latin America, for example, &quot;From as far back as the 1860s, Latin American jurists have made prominent contributions to international jurisprudence, the ‘mortar’ that binds international order. [...] However, in other ways, historically the LIO has been—and remains—superficial in its reach in Latin America.&quot; According to Abrahamsen, Andersen, and Sending, the contemporary liberal international order includes the legacy of &quot;southern actors&quot; in Africa and Asia advocating the process of decolonization.

International organizations play a central role in the liberal order. The World Trade Organization, for example, creates and implements free trade agreements, while the World Bank provides aid to developing countries. The order is also premised on the notion that liberal trade and free markets will contribute to global prosperity and peace. Critics argue that free trade has sometimes led to social problems such as inequality and environmental degradation.

Post-Cold War, some consider international agreements on issues such as climate change, nuclear nonproliferation, and upholding initiatives in maritime law (UNCLOS) to constitute elements of the LIO. The European Union is often considered a major example of the liberal international order put into effect in terms of international agreements between the constituent countries. 

Others argue that weak states played a central role in shaping the liberal international order. Marcos Tourinho argues that weak states used the three strategies of &quot;resistance&quot;, &quot;community&quot; and &quot;norms&quot; to push back on U.S. dominance during the construction of the liberal international order, thus ensuring that the order did not just reflect U.S. interests. Martha Finnemore argues that unipolarity does not just entail a material superiority by the unipole, but also a social structure whereby the unipole maintains its status through legitimation, and institutionalization. In trying to obtain legitimacy from the other actors in the international system, the unipole necessarily gives those actors a degree of power. The unipole also obtains legitimacy and wards off challenges to its power through the creation of institutions, but these institutions also entail a diffusion of power away from the unipole. David Lake has argued along similar lines that legitimacy and authority are key components of international order. Abrahamsen suggested that middle powers also benefit from liberal internationalism. By investing in the maintenance of multilateral institutions, moderate powers can collectively advocate for their self-interest, counterbalancing great power politics. Supporting liberal internationalism is thus a form of realpolitik for middle powers.

Realist critics of the LIO include John Mearsheimer, Patrick Porter and Charles Glaser. Mearsheimer has argued that the LIO is bound to fail due to the pushback it faces internally within liberal states and externally by non-liberal states. Porter has argued that the LIO was actually a coercive order and that it was not liberal. Glaser has argued that the balance of power theory, bargaining theory and neo-institutional theories better explain NATO than mechanisms associated with the LIO.

Aaron McKeil of the London School of Economics finds realist criticism of liberal order insufficient. He argues that the alternative foreign policies offered by realists as &quot;restraint&quot; and &quot;offshore balancing&quot; would be more generative of proxy wars and would fail to offer the level of institutions required for managing great power competition and international challenges.

Inderjeet Parmar has argued that the LIO is &quot;imperialism by another name&quot; and that it promotes a class-based, white elitist and racist hegemony over the rest of the world. According to Amitav Acharya, the LIO is often perceived outside of the West as a narrow ideological, economic, and strategic system that promotes the interests and culture of Western nations at the expense of their own local cultural languages, identities, and religions.

John Dugard of the Leiden Law School argued that the concept of the rules-based international order (RBO) is often used to serve the interests of the United States, and bypass international law when necessary. Dugard noted that the &quot;rules&quot; defined by the RBO are often vague and undefined, and can be subjected to manipulation and double standards. For instance, the US is not a party to several international treaties such as UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, Protocol I and Protocol II of the Geneva Conventions, and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, and used their own interpretations of international law in cases such as 2003 invasion of Iraq and drone warfare in the War on Terror as allowing for preemptive war as a form of permissible self-defence, a definition that is more contested under international law than the broader rules of the RBO.

== Relations with individual countries ==
China and Russia have been characterized as the most threatening states to the LIO.

=== China ===
Some see China as a potential challenger to the liberal order. According to Darren Lim and John Ikenberry, China seeks an international order that protects its illiberal domestic political and economic model. Scholars cite initiatives such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and One Belt One Road Initiative as institutions that appear to compete with existing liberal international institutions. Van Niewenhuizen is categorical that Xi Jinping, then General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, seeks to supplant the LIO. According to political scientist Thomas Ambrosio, one aim of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation was to ensure that liberal democracy could not gain ground in these countries, promoting authoritarian norms in Central Asia.

Rühlig asks in his March 2018 paper why China under Xi would seek to change a system by which it earns enormous profit. 

Nisha Mary Mathew contends that China&#x27;s relationship with Iran is driven not only by economics, but by a desire to see an international order not dominated by the U.S. and its allies.

Publishing in 2024, academics Xinru Ma and David C. Kang observe that U.S. scholars who contend that China does not accept the RBO rarely consider it an issue that the U.S. also often ignores these same rules.

=== Russia ===
Many scholars agree that the Russian Federation under Vladimir Putin seeks to undermine the liberal international order. Various viewpoints have been developed on the subject. The first is that Russia is a &quot;revanchist power&quot; seeking to completely overturn international diplomacy, the second is that Russia is a &quot;defensive power&quot; that seeks to push incremental change in the existing order, and the third is that Russia is an &quot;aggressive isolationist&quot;, with Putin playing a &quot;spoiler role&quot; in international affairs to boost legitimacy domestically.

Political sociologist Larry Diamond argues that Putin&#x27;s assault on liberal democracy is exemplified by the 2008 military intervention for the enclaves of Abkhazia and South Ossetia against independent Georgia, Russian support for Viktor Yanukovych in Ukraine, and the Russian military intervention in Ukraine by troops without insignia in 2014. Putin has been accused of giving financial support to far-right or national populist parties across Europe. For example, the National Front (now National Rally) obtained a 9 million euro loan from a Russian bank in 2014. Larry Diamond argues this influenced the policy of the National Front such as Marine Le Pen&#x27;s support for the annexation of Crimea.

The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and a widespread response against the invasion has led to renewed discussion of the liberal international order. Political scientist Lucan Way writes that the invasion has inadvertently strengthened the liberal international order in opposition, with the full-scale Russian invasion being a more conspicuously imperialistic challenge to sovereignty than smaller-scale frozen conflicts and political interferences. Way says that blocs such as the European Union will have more unified action while being currently pillars in the liberal international order. Samir Saran, head of the Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation, says that a renewed emphasis in the liberal international order offers new opportunities for the international community, but hopes that the LIO should maintain interest in global issues after the security crisis in Europe. Edward Luce says the invasion is a serious threat to the international order because, &quot;should Putin succeed, it would legitimise the law of the jungle, where large countries can annex smaller ones with impunity.&quot; At the same time, Luce suggests different terminology should be used besides &quot;liberal international order&quot; due to what he says is the selective nature of diplomacy. Kori Schake argues that the Russian invasion has provoked a Western response which strengthens the transatlantic alliance, a main component of the LIO, yet has also involved a global response, with the largest partner being Japan. Schake suggests that Ukraine&#x27;s own defense is a new strengthening element to the LIO, by showing a stark contrast between liberalism and authoritarianism. 

John Mearsheimer argues, that the US-lead liberal international order emerged in 1991 after the break-up of the Soviet Union, when the USA became the only superpower in the World. The absence of any other power, capable of challenging the US hegemony, resulted in numerous illiberal activities (e.g. bombing on Yugoslavia in 1999, Afganistan in 2001, Iraq in 2003-2011 and in 2014, Libya in 2011 and in 
2015–2019) initiated by the United States under false pretences. However, these wars have &quot;failed to spread democracy or produce international stability&quot;, and instead they &quot;antagonized the forces of nationalism and realist counter-hegemonic power politics&quot;. The Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 was notable as perhaps the first time that NATO and its allies failed to achieve their goals, potentially symbolizing the end of the unipolar moment of liberal hegemony and the beginning of a new International order, which may or may not be multipolar.

=== United States ===
A frequent view among developing countries interprets the United States as inconsistent when it argues for a rules-based international order while failing to conform to the decisions of international institutions like the United Nations or to accept the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.
&quot;The RBO (Rules-Based Order) is something other than international law. It is an alternative regime outside the discipline of international law which inevitably challenges and threatens international law&quot;.

<text>Gunnera is the sole genus of herbaceous flowering plants in the family Gunneraceae, which contains 63 species. Some species in this genus, namely those in the subgenus &quot;Panke&quot;, have extremely large leaves. Species in the genus are variously native to Latin America, Australia, New Zealand, Papuasia, Hawaii, insular Southeast Asia, Africa, and Madagascar. The stalks of some species are edible.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Gunnera&quot; is the only genus in the family Gunneraceae. The APG II system, of 2003, also recognizes this family and assigns it to the order Gunnerales in the clade core eudicots. The family then consisted of one or two genera, &quot;Gunnera&quot; and, optionally, &quot;Myrothamnus&quot;, the latter optionally segregated as a separate family, Myrothamnaceae. This represents a change from the APG system, of 1998, which firmly recognized two separate families, unplaced as to order. The APG III system and APG IV system recognizes the family Gunneraceae and places &quot;Myrothamnus&quot; in Myrothamnaceae; both families are placed in the order Gunnerales in the core eudicots.

The genus &quot;Gunnera&quot; was named after the Norwegian botanist Johann Ernst Gunnerus. At first it was assigned to the family Haloragaceae, though that presented difficulties that led to the general recognition of the family Gunneraceae, as had been proposed about the beginning of the 20th century. In the meantime, in many publications it had been referred to as being in the Haloragaceae, variously misspelt (as for example &quot;Halorrhagidaceae&quot;.) Such references still cause difficulties in consulting earlier works. However, currently &quot;Gunnera&quot; is firmly assigned to the monogeneric family Gunneraceae.

=== Evolution ===
&quot;Gunnera&quot; is thought to be a rather ancient group, with a well-documented fossil history due to the presence of fossilized pollen spores, known by the palynotaxon &quot;Tricolpites reticulatus&quot;. It is a Gondwanan lineage, having originated in South America during the Cretaceous. The earliest fossilized pollen is known from the Late Cretaceous (Turonian) of Peru, about 90 million years ago, and within the following 10 million years, &quot;Gunnera&quot; had achieved a worldwide distribution, with fossil pollen grains being found in areas where it is not found today, such as western North America, mainland Australia, and Antarctica. Based on fossil pollen recovered from drilling cores, &quot;Gunnera&quot; is also known to have inhabited the now-submerged islands of the Ninetyeast Ridge during the Paleocene, likely having dispersed there from either Australasia or the then-emergent Kerguelen Plateau islands.

Due to the widespread distribution of &quot;Gunnera&quot; during the Cretaceous, it was previously thought that the modern disjunct distribution of the genus was a relic of this period. However, phylogenetic analysis indicates that the majority of &quot;Gunnera&quot; species, even those found on entirely different continents, diverged from each other during the Cenozoic, indicating that the modern distribution of &quot;Gunnera&quot; is a consequence of long-distance dispersal from South America to other parts of the world, rather than relics of a former cosmopolitan distribution. The only species that diverged prior to the Cenozoic is &quot;Gunnera herteri&quot;, described from Uruguay and distributed in Uruguay and southeastern Brazil, which is thought to be the most ancient species of the genus, its lineage having diverged during the Late Cretaceous, roughly concurrent with the oldest &quot;Gunnera&quot; fossil pollen from Peru. The persistence of the &quot;Gunnera&quot; crown group since the Cretaceous makes it unique among flowering plants, and may have been facilitated by strong niche conservatism, dispersal ability, and being able to aggressively colonize disturbed land.

==Description==
The 40–50 species vary enormously in leaf size, with the iconic large-leaved species belonging to the subgenus &quot;Panke&quot;. The giant rhubarb, or Campos des Loges (&quot;Gunnera manicata&quot;), native to the Serra do Mar mountains of southeastern Brazil, is perhaps the largest species, with or sub-reniform leaves typically long, not including the thick, succulent petiole which may be up to in length. The width of the leaf blade is typically , but on two occasions cultivated specimens (in Dorset, England in 2011 and at Narrowwater, Ulster, Ireland in 1903) produced leaves fully in width. The seeds germinate best in very moist, but not wet, conditions and temperatures of 22–29 °C.

Only slightly smaller is &quot;Gunnera masafuerae&quot; of the Juan Fernandez Islands off the Chilean coast. They can have leaves up to in width on stout leaf stalks long and thick according to Skottsberg. These leaf stalks or petioles are the thickest of any dicot, and probably also the most massive. On nearby Isla Más Afuera, &quot;Gunnera peltata&quot; frequently has an upright trunk to in height by thick, bearing leaves up to wide. The Hoja de Pantano (&quot;Gunnera magnifica&quot;) of the Colombian Andes bears the largest leaf buds of any plant; up to long and thick. The succulent leaf stalks are up to long. The massive inflorescence of small, reddish flowers is up to long and weighs about 13 kg. The flowers of Gunnera species are dimerous ( two sepals, two petals (or none), two stamens (or one), and two carpels. Other giant &quot;Gunnera&quot; species within the subgenus &quot;Panke&quot; are found throughout the Neotropics and Hawaii. &quot;Gunnera insignis&quot; is also known by the name &quot;poor man&#x27;s umbrella&quot; in Costa Rica.

Outside of the subgenus &quot;Panke&quot;, most of the more basal &quot;Gunnera&quot; species have small-to-medium-sized leaves. There are some species with moderately large leaves in Africa (&quot;G. perpensa&quot;, in the subgenus &quot;Perpensum&quot;) and Southeast Asia (&quot;G. macrophylla&quot;, in the subgenus &quot;Pseudogunnera&quot;), but the majority of more basal species are low-lying, mat-forming plants with small leaves. There are several small species are found in New Zealand, notably &quot;G. albocarpa&quot;, with leaves only 1–2 cm long, and also in South America, with &quot;G. magellanica&quot; having leaves 5–9 cm wide on stalks 8–15 cm long. The most basal species in the genus, &quot;G. herteri&quot; of Uruguay and Brazil, also has small leaves.

Some fossil leaf impressions of &quot;Gunnera&quot; from the Cretaceous of North America have large leaves akin to those of &quot;Panke&quot;, and the most basal extant species within &quot;Panke&quot; (&quot;G. mexicana&quot;) is the most northern member. For this reason, it has been suggested that &quot;Panke&quot; originates from South American &quot;Gunnera&quot; that colonized North America during the Cretaceous and grew into giant forms, with the remaining South American &quot;Gunnera&quot; evolving into the subgenus &quot;Misandra&quot;, with a low-lying, matlike growth. During the Cenozoic, the North American &quot;Panke&quot; would have colonized Hawaii and retreated southwards on the mainland before recolonizing South America. However, more recent phylogenetic evidence suggests that &quot;Misandra&quot; and &quot;Panke&quot; diverged only 15 million years ago, much too recent to assign the Cretaceous &quot;Gunnera&quot; to &quot;Panke&quot;. Due to this, the large-leaved Cretaceous &quot;Gunnera&quot; from North America may represent a distinct lineage that convergently evolved giant leaves similar to those of &quot;Panke&quot;, but did not leave any descendants. &quot;&quot;

==Species==
, Plants of the World Online accepts the following species separated by subgenus:
In 2022, it was shown that plants in cultivation under the name &quot;Gunnera manicata&quot; were actually a hybrid, &quot;Gunnera&quot; × &quot;cryptica&quot;.

==Cyanobacterial symbiosis==
At least some species of &quot;Gunnera&quot; host endosymbiotic cyanobacteria such as &quot;Nostoc punctiforme&quot;. The cyanobacteria provide fixed nitrogen to the plant, while the plant provides fixed carbon to the microbe. The bacteria enter the plant via glands found at the base of each leaf stalk and initiate an intracellular symbiosis which is thought to provide the plant with fixed nitrogen in return for fixed carbon for the bacterium. The Nostoc-filled symbiotic tissue makes up just a small portion of the plant&#x27;s total biomass. &quot;Gunnera&quot; is the only known genus of angiosperms that hosts cyanobacteria, and the only known land plant with intracellular cyanobionts. Although the endosymbionts enters the cell wall, they do not penetrate the cell membrane. This relationship may provide insights to allow the creation of novel symbioses between crop plants and cyanobacteria, allowing growth in areas lacking fixed nitrogen in the soil.

==Uses==
The stalks of &quot;G. tinctoria&quot; (&quot;nalca&quot;), from southern Chile and Argentina, are edible. Their principal use is fresh consumption, after peeling, but also they are prepared in salads, liquor or marmalade. Leaves of this species are used in covering curanto (a traditional Chilean food).

&quot;Gunnera perpensa&quot; is a source of traditional medicine in southern Africa, both in veterinary and human ailments, largely in obstetric and digestive complaints, but also as a wound dressing. It also is eaten in various ways, largely the petioles, flower stalks and leaves, fresh and raw, preferably with skins and fibre removed, which is said to remove bitterness, but also cooked. The plant also is said to be used in making a beer.

<doc id="404949" wikidata="Q1836777" url="?curid=404949" title="Lucky Jim">
<text>Lucky Jim is a novel by Kingsley Amis, first published in 1954 by Victor Gollancz. It was Amis&#x27;s first novel and won the 1955 Somerset Maugham Award for fiction. The novel follows the academic and romantic tribulations of the eponymous James (Jim) Dixon, a reluctant history lecturer at an unnamed provincial English university.

Amis arrived at Dixon&#x27;s surname from 12 Dixon Drive, Leicester, the address of Philip Larkin from 1948 to 1950, while he was a librarian at the university there. &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; is dedicated to Larkin, who helped to inspire the main character and contributed significantly to the structure of the novel.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine included &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; in its &quot;TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005&quot;.

==Plot==
Jim Dixon is a lecturer in medieval history at a red brick university in the English Midlands. He has made an unsure start and, towards the end of the academic year, is concerned about losing his probationary position in the department. In his attempt to be awarded a permanent post he tries to maintain a good relationship with his absent-minded head of department, Professor Welch. To establish his credentials he must also ensure the publication of his first scholarly article, but he eventually discovers that the editor to whom he submitted it has translated it into Italian and passed it off as his own.

Dixon struggles with an on-again off-again &quot;girlfriend&quot;, Margaret Peel, a fellow lecturer who is recovering from a suicide attempt in the wake of a broken relationship with another man and implies she might make another attempt if Dixon left her. Margaret employs emotional blackmail to appeal to Dixon&#x27;s sense of duty and pity while keeping him in an ambiguous and sexless limbo. While she is staying with Professor Welch, he holds a musical weekend that seems to offer an opportunity for Dixon to advance his standing among his colleagues. The attempt goes wrong, however, and the drunken Dixon drops a lighted cigarette on the bed, burning a hole in the sheets.

During the same weekend Dixon meets Christine Callaghan, a young Londoner and the latest girlfriend of Professor Welch&#x27;s son, Bertrand, an amateur painter whose affectedness particularly infuriates Dixon. After a bad start Dixon realises that he is attracted to Christine, who is far less pretentious than she initially appears.

Dixon&#x27;s growing closeness to Christine upsets Bertrand, who is using her to reach her well-connected Scottish uncle, Julius Gore-Urquhart, and get a job from him. Then Dixon rescues Christine from the university&#x27;s annual dance after Bertrand treats her offhandedly, and takes her home in a taxi. The pair kiss and make a date for later, but Christine admits that she feels guilty about seeing Dixon behind Bertrand&#x27;s back and about Dixon&#x27;s supposed relationship with Margaret. The two decide not to see each other again, but when Bertrand calls on Dixon to &quot;warn him off the grass&quot; he cannot resist the temptation to quarrel with Bertrand, until they fight.

The novel reaches its climax during Dixon&#x27;s public lecture on &quot;Merrie England&quot;. Having attempted to calm his nerves by drinking too much, partially at the urging of Gore-Urquhart, he caps his uncertain performance by angrily mocking and denouncing the university culture of arty pretentiousness and passes out. Welch lets Dixon know privately that his employment will not be extended, but Gore-Urquhart offers Dixon the coveted job of assisting him in London. Later Dixon meets Margaret&#x27;s ex-boyfriend, who reveals that he had not been her fiancé, as she had claimed. Comparing notes, the two realise that the suicide attempt was faked as a piece of neurotic emotional blackmail.

Feeling free of Margaret at last, Dixon responds to Christine&#x27;s phoned request to see her off as she leaves for London. There he learns from her that she is leaving Bertrand after being told that he was having an affair with the wife of one of Dixon&#x27;s former colleagues. They decide to leave for London together and then walk off arm in arm, outraging the Welches as they pass on the street.

==Literary significance and legacy==
When originally published, &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; received enthusiastic reviews. In the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, Walter Allen wrote, &quot;Mr Amis has an unwaveringly merciless eye for the bogus: some aspects of provincial culture – the madrigals and recorders of Professor Welch, for instance – are pinned down as accurately as they have ever been; and he has, too, an eye for character – the female lecturer Margaret, who battens neurotically on Jim&#x27;s pity, is quite horribly well done. Mr Amis is a novelist of formidable and uncomfortable talent.&quot;

W. Somerset Maugham praised Amis&#x27; writing while disdaining the new generation he represented: &quot;Mr. Kingsley Amis is so talented, his observation is so keen, that you cannot fail to be convinced that the young men he so brilliantly describes truly represent the class with which his novel is concerned... They have no manners, and are woefully unable to deal with any social predicament. Their idea of a celebration is to go to a public bar and drink six beers. They are mean, malicious and envious... They are scum.&quot;

In response to Maugham&#x27;s criticism of the new generation, the &quot;New Statesman&quot; and &quot;The Nation&quot; held contests to get readers to respond to Maugham in the voice of Jim Dixon.

Retrospective reviews have solidified its legacy as one of Amis&#x27; finest novels. Christopher Hitchens described it as the funniest book of the second half of the 20th century, writing: &quot;&quot;Lucky Jim&quot; illustrates a crucial human difference between the little guy and the small man. And Dixon, like his creator, was no clown but a man of feeling after all.&quot;

Olivia Laing, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;Remarkable for its relentless skewering of artifice and pretension, &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; also contains some of the finest comic set pieces in the language.&quot;

Margaret Drabble, although defending Monica Jones, Philip Larkin&#x27;s paramour, against Amis&#x27;s caricature of her in &quot;Lucky Jim&quot;, wrote in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; that &quot;Monica as Margaret Peel, a needy, dowdy academic spinster, was the version that first lodged in my consciousness, as a scarecrow alarming enough to warn any woman off the academic life&quot;.

Adam Gopnik, writing in The New Yorker, wrote that the vacant Professor Welch was at least partially modelled on Oxford professor J. R. R. Tolkien, who his students, Amis and Larkin, had found to be tedious and almost unintelligible.

==Film and television adaptations==
In the 1957 British film adaptation, Jim Dixon was played by Ian Carmichael. Keith Barron starred in &quot;Further Adventures of Lucky Jim&quot;, a 1967 seven-episode BBC TV series based on the character and set in the &quot;swinging London&quot; of 1967. This was followed by &quot;The Further Adventures of Lucky Jim&quot; in 1982, but with Enn Reitel as Jim. In 2003, ITV aired a remake of &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; with Stephen Tompkinson playing the central character.

<doc id="404956" wikidata="Q4646303" url="?curid=404956" title="99 Flake">
<text>A 99 Flake, 99 or ninety-nine is an ice cream cone with a Cadbury Flake inserted in the ice cream. The term can also refer to the half-sized Cadbury-produced Flake bar, itself specially made for such ice cream cones, and to a wrapped product marketed by Cadbury “for ice cream and culinary use”.

Created at the Cadbury&#x27;s factory in Birmingham, England, the flake was originally designed to be a cuboid and to fit into a wafer. By 1930, Cadbury&#x27;s was selling half-length Flake &quot;99s&quot; specifically for serving in an ice cream cone.

==&#x27;99&#x27; ice cream==
A 99 Flake is an ice cream cone, usually made with soft serve ice cream, into which a Flake bar has been inserted. The ice cream is usually vanilla flavoured. They are sold by ice cream vans and parlours. Variations include a 99 with two flakes – often referred to as a &quot;double 99&quot; or &quot;bunny&#x27;s ears&quot; – and a 99 with strawberry or raspberry syrup on top, sometimes known as &quot;monkey&#x27;s blood&quot;.

==Cadbury 99 Flake bar==

The Flake chocolate bar manufactured and marketed by Cadbury was first developed in the UK in 1920. An employee of Cadbury&#x27;s noted that when the excess chocolate from the moulds used to create other chocolate bars was drained off, it fell off in a stream and created folded chocolate with flaking properties.

The early &quot;99 Flake&quot; was a wafer &quot;sandwich&quot;, not a flake bar inserted into a cone of ice cream. It consisted of a small chocolate flake inserted between two servings of ice cream and placed between two wafer biscuits.

In 1930, Cadbury started producing a smaller version of the standard Flake bar especially for use with ice cream cones. These were marketed under the name 99 Flake and sold loose in boxes rather than individually wrapped like the traditional Flake.

==Name==
The origins of the name are uncertain. One claim is that it was coined in Portobello, Scotland, where Stefano Arcari who had opened a shop in 1922 at 99 Portobello High Streetwould break a large &quot;Flake&quot; in half and stick it in an ice cream. The name derived from the shop&#x27;s address. A Cadbury representative took the naming idea to his company. Another address-based claim for the &quot;99&quot; is made by the Dunkerleys in Gorton, Manchester, who operated a sweet shop at 99 Wellington Street.

Another naming possibility is that it was named by immigrant Italian ice-cream sellers, many of whom were from the mountainous areas in Veneto, especially in the Bellunes Alps, Trentino, and Friuli. The name was in honour of the final wave of Italian First World War conscripts, born in 1899 and referred to as &quot;i Ragazzi del 99&quot; (&quot;the Boys of &#x27;99&quot;). In Italy they were held in such high esteem that some streets were named in their honour. The chocolate flake may have reminded the ice cream sellers of the long dark feather cocked at an angle in the conscripts&#x27; &quot;Alpini&quot; Regiment hats.

The Cadbury website says that the reason behind the Flake being called a &quot;99&quot; has been &quot;lost in the mists of time&quot;. However, the website also references an article from an old Cadbury works paper, which states that the name came from the guard of the Italian king, which consisted of 99 men and thus &quot;anything really special or first class was known as 99.&quot;

<text>The Strategic Rocket Forces of the Russian Federation or the Strategic Missile Forces of the Russian Federation (RVSN RF; ) is a separate combat arm of the Russian Armed Forces that controls Russia&#x27;s land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). It was formerly part of the Soviet Armed Forces from 1959 to 1991.

The Strategic Rocket Forces was created on 17 December 1959 as part of the Soviet Armed Forces as the main force for operating all Soviet nuclear ground-based intercontinental, intermediate-range ballistic missile, and medium-range ballistic missile with ranges over 1,000 kilometers. After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, assets of the Strategic Rocket Forces were in the territories of several new states in addition to Russia, with armed nuclear missile silos in Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine. The three of them transferred their missiles to Russia for dismantling and they all joined the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

Complementary strategic forces within Russia include the Russian Aerospace Forces&#x27; Long Range Aviation and the Russian Navy&#x27;s ballistic missile submarines. Together the three bodies form Russia&#x27;s nuclear triad.

== History ==

The first Soviet rocket study unit was established in June 1946, by redesignating the 92nd Guards Mortar Regiment at Bad Berka in East Germany as the 22nd Brigade for Special Use of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. On October 18, 1947, the brigade conducted the first launch of the remanufactured former German A-4 ballistic missile, or R-1, from the Kapustin Yar Range. In the early 1950s the 77th and 90th Brigades were formed to operate the R-1 (SS-1a &#x27;Scunner&#x27;). The 54th and 56th Brigades were formed to conduct test launches of the R-2 (SS-2 &#x27;Sibling&#x27;) at Kapustin Yar on June 1, 1952.

The 5th Scientific Research Proving Ground was established in 1955 in Kzyl-Orda Oblast at the town of Zarya later Leninsk, and finally in 1995 Baikonur. Also established that year was the 43rd Independent Scientific Experimental Station (Klyuchi, Kamchatka Krai) as an outstation of the Baikonur test site. Two years later &quot;Object Angara&quot; was formed at Plesetsk, Arkhangelsk Oblast, which after another name change in 1959 eventually became the 53rd Scientific Research Proving Ground in 1963.

From 1959 the Soviets introduced a number of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) into service, including the R-12 (SS-4 &#x27;Sandal&#x27;), the R-7 (SS-6 &#x27;Sapwood&#x27;), the R-16 (SS-7 &#x27;Saddler&#x27;), the R-9 (SS-8 &#x27;Sasin&#x27;), the R-26 (given the NATO reporting name SS-8 &#x27;Sasin&#x27; due to incorrect identification as the R-9), the R-36 (SS-9 &#x27;Scarp&#x27;), and the RT-21 (SS-16 &#x27;Sinner&#x27;), which was possibly never made fully operational.

By 1990 all early types of missiles had been retired from service. In 1990, the Strategic Missile Forces were officially established as a service branch of the Armed Forces under the direct control of the Defense Ministry. The date of its formal foundation, December 17, is celebrated as Strategic Missile Forces Day.

Two rocket armies were formed in 1960. The 43rd Rocket Army and the 50th Rocket Army were formed from the previous 43rd and 50th Air Armies of the Long Range Aviation.

During a test of the R-16 ICBM on October 24, 1960, the test missile exploded on the pad, killing the first commander of the SRF, Chief Marshal of Artillery Mitrofan Ivanovich Nedelin. This disaster, the details of which were concealed for decades, became known as the Nedelin catastrophe. He was succeeded by Marshal of the Soviet Union Kirill Moskalenko who was in turn quickly succeeded by Marshal Sergey Biryuzov. Under Marshal Вiryuzov the SRF deployed missiles to Cuba in 1962 as part of Operation Anadyr. 36 R-12 intermediate range ballistic missiles were sent to Cuba, initiating the Cuban Missile Crisis. The 43rd Guards Missile Division of 43rd Rocket Army manned the missiles while in Cuba.

Marshal Nikolai Krylov took over in March 1963 and served until February 1972. During this time French President Charles de Gaulle visited the Strategic Missile Forces in 1966. Together with NI Krylov, he visited a missile division in Novosibirsk, and then at the invitation of Leonid Brezhnev participated in a demonstration missile launch at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in the Kazakh SSR. Chief Marshal of Artillery Vladimir Fedorovich Tolubko commanded the SRF from April 12, 1972, to July 10, 1985. Tolubko emphasised raising the physical fitness standards within the SRF and in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Strategic Rocket Forces began to field the new UR-100 (SS-11 &#x27;Sego&#x27;) and UR-100N (SS-19 &#x27;Stilleto&#x27;) ICBMs beginning with the 43rd Rocket Army in the Ukrainian SSR, providing them with longer range and more accurate missiles. He was succeeded by General of the Army Yury Pavlovich Maksimov, who was in command from July 10, 1985, to August 19, 1992.

According to a 1980 TIME Magazine article citing analysts from RAND Corporation, Soviet non-Slavs were generally barred from joining the Strategic Missile Forces because of suspicions about the loyalty of ethnic minorities to the state. Those who served in the Strategic Rocket Forces had better quality of living, food and also higher salaries than the ones paid to those serving in the Soviet Army. The majority of new recruits has, since its inception, consisted of mainly college and university graduates.

In 1989 the Strategic Missile Forces had over 1,400 ICBMs, 300 launch control centers, and twenty-eight missile bases. The SMT operated RSD-10 (SS-20 &#x27;Saber&#x27;) intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) and R-12 (SS-4 &#x27;Sandal&#x27;) medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs). Two-thirds of the road-mobile Soviet RSD-10 force was based in the western Soviet Union and was aimed at Western Europe.

One-third of the force was located east of the Ural Mountains and was targeted primarily against China. Older R-12 missiles were deployed at fixed sites in the western Soviet Union. The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, signed in December 1987, called for the elimination of all 553 Soviet RSD-10 and R-12 missiles within three years. As of mid-1989, over 50% of RSD-10 and R-12 missiles had been eliminated.

By 1990 the Soviet Union had seven types of operational ICBMs. About 50% were heavy R-36M (SS-18 &#x27;Satan&#x27;) and UR-100N (SS-19 &#x27;Stiletto&#x27;) ICBMs, which carried 80% of the country&#x27;s land-based ICBM warheads. By this time it was producing new mobile, and hence survivable ICBMs, the RT-23 (SS-24 &#x27;Scalpel&#x27;) and RT-2PM (SS-25 &#x27;Sickle&#x27;).

In 1990, with the R-12 apparently fully retired, the IISS reported that there were 350 UR-100s (SS-11 &#x27;Sego,&#x27; Mod 2/3), 60 RT-2s (SS-13 &#x27;Savage&#x27;) still in service in one missile field, 75 UR-100MRs (SS-17 &#x27;Spanker,&#x27; Mod 3, with 4 MIRV), 308 R-36Ms (mostly Mod 4 with 10 MIRV), 320 UR-100Ns (mostly Mod 3 with 6 MIRV), some 60 RT-23s (silo and rail-mobile), and some 225 RT-2PMs (mobile).

== Post Soviet Union ==
Like most of the Russian Armed Forces, the Strategic Missile Forces had limited access to resources for new equipment in the Yeltsin era. However, the Russian government made a priority of ensuring that the Missile Forces received new missiles to phase out older, less-reliable systems, and to incorporate newer capabilities in the face of international threats to the viability of the nuclear deterrent effect provided by their missiles. In particular the development of missile defense systems in the United States.

In 1995, the &quot;Strategic Missile Forces Day&quot; and &quot;Military Space Forces Day&quot; were created. On July 16, 1997, President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree incorporating the Russian Space Forces and the Space Missile Defence Forces (Russian: Ракетно-космической обороны) into the SMT. In doing so, &#x27;nearly 60&#x27; military units and establishments were dissolved. However, four years later, on June 1, 2001, the Russian Space Forces were reformed as a separate branch of service from the SMT.

Minister of Defence Marshal of the Russian Federation Igor Sergeev, a former commander of the SMT from August 19, 1992 – May 22, 1997, played a major role in assuring funding for his former service. He was succeeded by General of the Army Vladimir Yakovlev, who commanded the SMT from June 1997 until April 27, 2001. Yakovlev was succeeded by Colonel General Nikolay Solovtsov.

In the early 2000s, Chief of the General Staff Army General Anatoly Kvashnin decided to downgrade the status of the Strategic Missile Forces from a branch of the armed forces to an independent combat arm. This was completed despite the opposition of Defense Minister Marshal Igor Sergeyev.

Solovtsov was dismissed in July–August 2009. Speculation over why Solovtsov was dismissed included opposition to further cuts in deployed nuclear ballistic missile warheads below the April 2009 figure of 1,500, the fact that he had reached the retirement age of 60, despite that he had recently been extended another year&#x27;s service, or the failure of the Navy&#x27;s Bulava missile).

After only a year, Lieutenant General Andrey Shvaichenko, appointed on August 3, 2009, by President Dmitry Medvedev, was replaced. The current commander of the Strategic Missile Forces, Colonel General Sergey Karakayev, was appointed to the post by a presidential decree of June 22, 2010.

The RVSN headquarters has a special sledgehammer that can be used to gain access to the launch codes if the commander feels the need to use it or if ordered directly, but does not have normal access to the safe. In 2020, the Strategic Missile Forces completed switching to digital information transmission technology.

==Composition since 2010s==


The main RVSN command post is at Kuntsevo in the suburbs of Moscow. The alternate command post is at Kosvinsky Mountain in the Urals.

Female cadets have started to join the Peter the Great Strategic Missile Forces Academy. In the past, only men were allowed to serve in the Missile Forces. RVSN institutes also exist at Serpukhov and Rostov-on-Don. An ICBM test impact range is located in the Far East, the Kura Test Range. This has been under Aerospace Defence Forces&#x27; command since 2010. 

The Strategic Missile Forces operate four distinct missile systems. The oldest system is the silo-based R-36M2 / SS-18 &quot;Satan&quot;. It carries ten warheads. The last missile will be in service until 2020.

The second system is the silo-based UR-100NUTTH / SS-19 &quot;Stiletto&quot;. The last &quot;Stiletto&quot; missiles in service with six warheads each will be removed by 2019. Two UR-100NUTTH missiles are still believed to be active with Avangard HGVs as of 2024.

A new missile entering service is the RT-2UTTH Topol-M / SS-27 &quot;Sickle B&quot; with single warhead, of which 60 are silo-based and 18 are mobile. Some new missiles will be added in the future. The first upgraded Topol-M called RS-24 Yars, carrying three warheads, was commissioned in 2010. In July 2011 the first mobile regiment with nine missiles was completed. From 2012 to 2017, about 80 ICBMs were placed in active duty. The RF Defense Minister said in December 2022 that 91.3% of the country&#x27;s nuclear forces was modern. 3 missile regiments rearmed in 2023. According to the RF MoD, the new super-heavy ICBM RS-28 Sarmat has entered service, it&#x27;s designed to replace the aging R-36. A new IRBM named Oreshnik was launched at Dnipro, Ukraine in 2024.

<doc id="404971" wikidata="Q6141263" url="?curid=404971" title="USS Tunny (SS-282)">
<text>USS &quot;Tunny&quot; (SS/SSG/APSS/LPSS-282) was a which saw service in World War II and in the Vietnam War. &quot;Tunny&quot; received nine battle stars and two Presidential Unit Citations for her World War II service and five battle stars for her operations during the Vietnam War. &quot;Tunny&quot; was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the tunny, any of several oceanic fishes resembling the mackerel.

== Construction ==
&quot;Tunny&quot;&#x27;s keel was laid down on 10 November 1941 at Vallejo, California, by the Mare Island Navy Yard. She was launched on 30 June 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Frederick G. Crisp, wife of Rear Admiral Frederick G. Crisp, manager of the Mare Island Navy Yard, and commissioned on 1 September 1942.

==World War II service==
===September 1942–January 1943===
After commissioning, &quot;Tunny&quot; conducted shakedown training from California ports. On 29 November 1942, at a position in the Pacific Ocean off California which the armed tanker reported as but actually was in the vicinity of , &quot;Huguenot&quot; mistook &quot;Tunny&quot; for a Japanese submarine and opened gunfire on her. &quot;Tunny&quot; was under escort by the submarine chaser , which was about from &quot;Tunny&quot; on her starboard quarter at the time. &quot;Tunny&quot; pulled away from at high speed to a range of and avoided damage and casualties.

After completing shakedown, &quot;Tunny&quot; arrived in the Hawaiian Islands on 12 December 1942. She then engaged in an additional week of training, followed by two weeks repairs.

===First war patrol (12 January – 20 February 1943)===
She got underway from Submarine Base, Pearl Harbor, on 12 January 1943 for her first war patrol. For nearly a week, rough seas hampered the progress of the submarine. Then, as she approached the Ryukyu Islands, sea traffic increased. Sightings of sampans became frequent, and &quot;Tunny&quot; often dove to avoid detection by suspicious-looking trawlers.

At 05:30 on 26 January, &quot;Tunny&quot; sighted masts and a stack over the horizon indicating a possible target. During the day, she lessened the distance between herself and her quarry; and, near dusk, she closed a 400-ton trawler. Finding the prey not worth a torpedo, the submarine surfaced and opened fire with her deck gun. Soon, darkness forced her to discontinue the attack, and she continued on her way.

On 29 January, she began patrolling off Formosa. An hour and a half before midnight on 31 January, her periscope at last disclosed a worthwhile target, a freighter approaching Takao Ko. &quot;Tunny&quot; fired two &quot;fish&quot; from her bow tubes, but the freighter made a radical change of course which enabled her to evade the torpedoes. When her target counterattacked and dropped two depth charges, &quot;Tunny&quot; broke off the attack and submerged.

On 1 February, &quot;Tunny&quot; set her course for the China coast, running on the surface. As darkness fell on 2 February, she was only hours from Hong Kong, expecting to make landfall on Tamkan Island by daybreak. At 2130, she made radar contact; and, through the night, drew closer to her as yet unseen quarry.

A light rain was falling and visibility was poor when, half an hour before morning twilight, &quot;Tunny&quot; began a radar approach. Rapidly shoaling water less than 20 fathoms (37 m) deep and land masses on two sides of the submarine limited her maneuverability. At , the extreme phosphorescence of the water illuminated her wake and betrayed her presence to the enemy ship, which began signaling the unidentified intruder with a blinker light. Despite her detection, &quot;Tunny&quot; continued the approach until she was only from the target and then launched three torpedoes. The Japanese ship, now discernible as a loaded tanker, began to maneuver radically and opened fire on the submarine. Undeterred, &quot;Tunny&quot; submerged and continued the attack, firing a second volley from her stern tubes. One of these torpedoes hit the side of the tanker with a thud, but without explosion, and a small column of water erupted just forward of the tanker&#x27;s bridge. Duds and prematures were a problem for American submarines early in 1943, and verification that this torpedo had indeed hit the tanker, but failed to detonate, was forthcoming when members of the tanker&#x27;s crew dashed to the spot in question and began examining the impact area with flashlights. Despite continuous fire from the ship and the proximity of land, &quot;Tunny&quot; managed to stay within firing range of her target by traveling at full speed. After the tanker successfully evaded &quot;Tunny&quot;&#x27;s third salvo, the submarine fired a last torpedo from as the intended victim reached the passage into Hong Kong. Following this disappointing conclusion to her attack, &quot;Tunny&quot; dove in anticipation of search planes which appeared within two hours and continued their surveillance throughout the day.

After dark on 3 February, while patrolling Lema Channel, &quot;Tunny&quot; made radar contact with a sizable target. On this very dark night, visual identification was impossible; but, at 2005, the submarine approached to and made a three-torpedo attack. The sound of the target&#x27;s screws ceased immediately, and &quot;Tunny&quot; claimed to have sunk this unidentified ship which had been seen only on radar. When the submarine surfaced at daybreak the following day, the submariners discovered an unexpected visitor on deck—a six-foot black and yellow striped snake.

On 4 February, &quot;Tunny&quot; set her course for Swatow, keeping to the shoreline in hopes of intercepting shipping. En route, she passed a large hospital ship well marked and brilliantly lighted. On 6 February and 7 February, &quot;Tunny&quot; patrolled off Swatow. Numerous junks plying the Formosa and Swatow banks at all hours added to the hazards imposed by shallow water, and an inoperable fathometer (depthmeter) made it impossible for &quot;Tunny&quot; to approach the shore closer than six miles (10 km).

Early on the morning of 8 February, she went deep to avoid a plane revealed by radar. When she surfaced, she discovered a freighter off her beam. She shadowed the target during the day and, after sunset, made her approach and launched two torpedoes from a distance of . Due to bad runs, neither of these took effect, but they did alert the freighter, which opened fire on &quot;Tunny&quot;. The submarine fired two shots from her bow tubes, but one torpedo missed, and the other circled around to the right. &quot;Tunny&quot; then drew ahead for a surface approach and fired three more torpedoes. Two of these found the mark; but one put on an amazing show, veering sharply first to the left and then to the right, before hitting the target. The &quot;Kusayama Maru&quot;, a heavily laden, 5000-ton cargo ship, sank by the stern in 20 minutes; &quot;Tunny&quot; had scored her first confirmed kill. As she proceeded on towards Takao harbor, a searchlight suddenly pierced the dark not far ahead, and &quot;Tunny&quot; dove to avoid detection.

The next day, &quot;Tunny&quot; sighted a large transport. Undetected by two nearby patrol vessels and a plane, she made her approach and scored two hits on the transport with her remaining torpedoes. However, the ship did not sink and later left the area.

On 11 February, &quot;Tunny&quot; set her course for Midway Island. En route, she used a combination of 20 millimeter and five-inch (127 mm) gunfire to sink a 100-ton fishing trawler. On 20 February, she made contact with the harbor escort and proceeded to moor at Midway Island, completing her first aggressive and successful patrol. She later continued on to Hawaii, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 24 February 1943.

===Second war patrol (24 March – 23 April 1943)===
After refitting by tender and three days of training, &quot;Tunny&quot; departed the Hawaiian Islands on 18 March, paused at Midway Island for replacement of her periscope, and got underway for Wake Island on 24 March. Later, Commander, Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet, would describe &quot;Tunny&quot;&#x27;s second war patrol as belonging &quot;in that exceptional category of one of the outstandingly aggressive patrols of the war.&quot;
On 27 March 1943, &quot;Tunny&quot; arrived off Wake Island and operated within a circle all day, flooding down the decks awash when within of the island. Before dawn the next morning, she closed to within ten miles (16 km) of the Japanese-held island and watched as its awakening occupants turned on their lights. A motor torpedo boat and two patrol boats passed by less than from the submarine without detecting her presence. Trailing these vessels, &quot;Tunny&quot; came upon a cargo ship, &quot;Suwa Maru,&quot; and all hands scrambled to battle stations. Shortly after sunrise, the submarine launched her attack, firing two torpedoes from a range of . The first found its mark and blew the stern off the enemy ship, but the buoyancy of the lightly loaded vessel kept it afloat. &quot;Tunny&quot; was maneuvering at periscope depth to avoid depth charges dropped across her bow at a range of when the first of several aerial bombs fell close aboard. The submarine dove to . When she attempted to surface an hour later, &quot;Tunny&quot; was again driven down by an aerial adversary. Later in the morning, traveling submerged at , she set her course for her assigned patrol area.

On 31 March, she entered the patrol area in the Caroline Islands, and, on 1 April 1943, she conducted submerged patrols off North Pass Island, Truk, and later in the day on the Japanese naval base&#x27;s western approaches. Failing to find any action in these areas, she surfaced late in the afternoon on 2 April and set her course for the channel between Puluwat Island and Pulap Island. Later that day, as she patrolled off Alet Island, &quot;Tunny&quot; made radar contact with a ship dead ahead. Heading in for a flank attack, she sighted a astern of her chosen target. &quot;Tunny&quot; launched three torpedoes from and noted a hit in the forward hold of the Japanese cargo ship before diving to to avoid the attention of the destroyer. Minutes later, a series of nine depth charges tumbled down in search of the submarine, but exploded at too shallow a depth to achieve their purpose. Some 15 minutes later, as &quot;Tunny&quot; started up to take a look, she was jolted by a deep-set depth charge which caught her at , but caused only minor damage—a small price to pay for the sinking of &quot;Toyo Maru Number 2&quot;. Before midnight, the destroyer gave up the search, and the submarine surfaced and set her course for the Namonuito group to the north.

Late on 4 April, &quot;Tunny&quot; headed west to intercept traffic reported north of McLaughlin Bank. On 7 April, while patrolling in that area, the submarine took advantage of a rain squall to approach within of a radar-tracked target. She then launched two torpedoes at the &quot;Kosei Maru&quot;, an 8000-ton passenger-cargo ship, scoring a hit amidships and one aft, and dove immediately to escape the inevitable wrath of the escorting &quot;Akatsuki&quot;-class destroyer which had been patrolling just ahead of the now-stricken transport. The ensuing depth charge counterattack continued until the destroyer lost contact with the submarine in a heavy rain squall. Having added a third cargo ship to her list of kills, &quot;Tunny&quot; retired from the scene of the attack.

On 8 April, the submarine surfaced in a downpour to continue patrols north of West Fayu Island. Later that day, she set her course to intercept a convoy reported to be southwest of Truk. At 22:28 on 9 April, she made radar contact with a formation less than three miles (5 km) distant and went to four engines to maneuver into position for an attack. In a few minutes, the formation changed course, putting &quot;Tunny&quot; in position to slow down to two-thirds speed and head in, flooded down to decks awash to avoid detection. As the convoy became visible, &quot;Tunny&quot;″s commanding officer, Commander James A. Scott, could hardly believe his luck. On the starboard bow was a large aircraft carrier, to port two auxiliary carriers, and on each bow of the formation, a destroyer. Given this perfect setup, &quot;Tunny&quot; maneuvered to swing the bow on twin targets, but her plans were disrupted when three small boats similar to motor torpedo boats appeared only off her port bow. &quot;Tunny&quot; quickly dove to , turned right, ninety degrees, and launched four torpedoes from her stern tubes at one of the auxiliary carriers from a distance of . As she turned her attention to other targets, four torpedo explosions sounded through the night.

Signaling from her new target gave executive officer Lieutenant Commander Roger Keithly at the conn a final check on the target&#x27;s bearing, and &quot;Tunny&quot; released a salvo of six torpedoes from her bow tubes at the large carrier. Her surprise attack completed, &quot;Tunny&quot; immediately dove amidst the cacophony of depth charges and churning screws. The depth charges rocked the submarine but did no damage; and the crackling and grinding noises heard throughout the ship, as well as on sonar, led those on board the submarine to believe that their &quot;fish&quot; had found their mark. In all this noise and confusion, &quot;Tunny&quot; unobtrusively slipped away to the north. Later, examination of Japanese records showed that this attack was ruined by prematures and duds, and that damage to the enemy had been minor. However, the skill and daring with which the raid was conducted remained an example of excellence and prompted the Commander, Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet, to commend &quot;Tunny&quot;&#x27;s commander for his actions on this patrol as &quot;an illustrious example of professional competence and military aggressiveness.&quot;

An hour and a half after midnight on 10 April, the submarine surfaced and set her course to return to her patrol area. While approaching North Pass about from Truk on 11 April, &quot;Tunny&quot; dove when a searchlight suddenly broke the night, ahead on the starboard bow. No depth charges followed, and the source of the light—not sizable enough to be detected on radar—was presumed to be a small boat.

Early on the afternoon of 11 April, a contact, at first thought to be a patrol boat, turned out to be a Japanese submarine. The designation symbol of the enemy submarine was emblazoned on her sail, spelling out &quot;I-9&quot; in large white characters. Boldly taking the offensive, &quot;Tunny&quot; fired her three remaining forward &quot;fish&quot; at the submarine, only to see the vessel turn away and parallel the course of the torpedoes. &quot;Tunny&quot; then began her own evasive procedures, going deep and away from the Japanese submersible—and none too soon. Minutes later, she tracked two torpedoes which passed harmlessly astern. An enemy plane added bombs to &quot;Tunny&quot;&#x27;s immediate concerns, but she rigged for silent running and weathered the attack by remaining submerged until after nightfall.

That same evening, as &quot;Tunny&quot; lay on the surface in the bright moonlight charging her batteries, she made radar contact with a ship moving at . Within minutes, the contact materialized into an enemy destroyer steaming on the starboard bow. &quot;Tunny&quot; dove to and began to swing for a stern shot when the belligerent destroyer increased speed to a thundering and headed in from a distance of less than . As the submarine dove for , the explosions of nine depth charges fairly close by pursued her. Silent running and a quick reversal of course eventually shook off the menacing destroyer, and &quot;Tunny&quot; returned to the surface after the moon set, noting only minor damage from the attack.

In the days that followed, &quot;Tunny&quot; patrolled off East Fayu Island and north of Mogami Bank before setting her course for Saipan on 15 April. Her surveillance of Magicienne Harbor disclosed that it was not in use. Seeking targets, the submarine passed through Saipan Channel and later discovered two cargo ships in Garapan Harbor. Prevented from attacking by the presence of intervening reefs, &quot;Tunny&quot; departed the area and moored in the lagoon at Midway Island on 23 April for a welcome rest. So aggressive had been her handling on this eventful patrol that not one of her firing ranges exceeded . She was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for this outstanding patrol.

===Third war patrol (27 April – 14 July 1943)===
After refitting at Midway Island, &quot;Tunny&quot; continued on to Hawaii for additional repairs. She departed Pearl Harbor on 25 May 1943 and, after fueling at Johnston Island, got underway on 27 April for Eniwetok. Her first contact with the enemy on this third war patrol came early in the afternoon on 31 May when she dove to avoid a radar contact whose speed identified it as a plane. As &quot;Tunny&quot; passed , a bomb exploded over her after torpedo room, breaking lights and thermometers, flooding the after torpedo tubes, and causing miscellaneous other damage. An unsatisfactory makeshift repair of the broken bridge speaker prompted a note in the war patrol report that &quot;the only dependable communication system was the open hatch and a powerful set of lungs.&quot; Other repairs were completed before nightfall, and &quot;Tunny&quot; continued on her way. She patrolled off Eniwetok for two days; then moved on to her assigned area, arriving at Truk on 6 June.

As this patrol progressed, &quot;Tunny&quot; discovered that antisubmarine action by the Japanese at Truk had shifted to aerial detection. On 7 June, her first day of patrol, she was harassed by a single float biplane and an ineffectual Japanese destroyer. &quot;Tunny&quot; found the enemy biplanes a great nuisance, since her radar detected them late or not at all. Soon she came to regard the aircraft as an arch-enemy which thwarted attacks on convoys by hovering overhead and guiding possible targets around the submarine, out of firing range.

On 14 June, as &quot;Tunny&quot; cruised on the surface following a submerged patrol east of Murilo Island in the Hall group, one of her lookouts sighted a convoy bearing 090 degrees. Made up of two small freighters and a large transport and accompanied by two destroyers, the convoy was a tempting target. As &quot;Tunny&quot; made her approach, an unobserved escort vessel suddenly challenged her with a searchlight and several rounds of four-inch (102 mm) fire which fell astern. The submarine dove to but continued her approach. She then surfaced and launched four torpedoes at the transport from a range of . Three explosions and a tremendous cloud of smoke and water over the target indicated that &quot;Tunny&quot; had damaged the enemy vessel. The submarine dove to avoid the escorts, but no depth charging ensued. Shortly after midnight, as she ran on the surface attempting to intercept the convoy, an undetected vessel fired shots which splashed astern. &quot;Tunny&quot; dove again.

As June wore on, &quot;Tunny&quot; continued patrols as far as Saipan without success. On 26 June, she conducted routine and photographic reconnaissance of Saipan Harbor and Tinian Channel and, later that day, surfaced to patrol the Truk-Empire shipping lanes east of Rota Island. Patrolling off Harnum Point and Rota harbor on 28 June, &quot;Tunny&quot; sighted a converted gunboat zigzagging madly, went to battle stations, and dispatched the enemy vessel with a salvo of three torpedoes from . Sighting an armed trawler bearing down on her, the submarine dove. Those on board felt the concussion of three sharp explosions close aboard, perhaps from aerial bombs, as &quot;Tunny&quot; went deep and rigged for silent running, maneuvering to avoid the trawler. Seconds later, two heavy explosions marked the death throes of &quot;Tunny&quot;&#x27;s most recent victim. &quot;Tunny&quot; was chased down again by the trawler when she attempted to surface an hour later. Returning to periscope depth some three hours after the attack, her commanding officer at the periscope was relieved to find no sign of the trawler, but his relief quickly turned to alarm when the periscope revealed a close-up of the bomb bay of a Mitsubishi Type 97 at , directly overhead. This time &quot;Tunny&quot; waited four hours before surfacing again from Guam.

She patrolled off Guam until 4 July when she received orders to leave the area. Early the next day, she set her course for Johnston Island. Japanese aircraft continued to badger the submarine for two days as she proceeded toward Hawaii. After taking on fuel and provisions at Johnston Island on 11 July, she completed her third patrol at Pearl Harbor on 14 July.

===Fourth war patrol (10 August – 8 September 1943)===
After refitting and three days of training, &quot;Tunny&quot; departed Hawaii on 5 August for Midway Island. She arrived at Midway Island on 9 August and was again underway on 10 August. On 18 August, she sighted Pagan Island and Alamagan Island; and, on 22 August, she entered her assigned area in the Palau Islands and began patrols. Early in the morning of 24 August, she sighted a six-ship convoy as it emerged from Toagel Mlungui Pass. &quot;Tunny&quot; trailed the convoy until she could obtain a good firing position and, at moonrise on 25 August, she submerged to and began her approach. At 01:40, she launched three torpedoes and then another two in rapid succession. She then ducked her periscope and dove to avoid being rammed by the first target. The convoy passed overhead as &quot;Tunny&quot; dove deep in expectation of depth charges. She heard her torpedoes explode at the end of their run, but the absence of depth charges was both welcome and unexpected. Near dawn, &quot;Tunny&quot; made another attack, launching six torpedoes at ships of the convoy without success. Meanwhile, a destroyer escort had joined the convoy. Alerted to &quot;Tunny&quot;&#x27;s presence, she now bore down on the submarine. &quot;Tunny&quot; dove, and, for the next two hours, the enemy ship remained overhead pinging and tracking. The destroyer escort dropped two patterns of six depth charges close by the submarine but finally gave up the search. At noon, &quot;Tunny&quot; came to periscope depth and, finding no sign of the convoy, set her course for Toagel Mlungui, securing from battle stations after an exhausting 15 hours.

At mid-morning on 26 August, she spotted two vessels escorted by submarine chaser CH-4 approaching Toagel Mlungui Pass and launched a five-torpedo attack. As &quot;Tunny&quot; dove, the screws of the first ship were heard to stop; and, shortly thereafter, two depth charges exploded overhead. Two minutes later, another pattern of depth charges exploded all around the submarine. A small fire broke out in the maneuvering room, causing main power to be lost momentarily. In order to check the fire, the main motors were stopped for one minute; then started again. Although the fire was small, dense smoke from burning insulating varnish made it difficult at first to assess the damage. Meanwhile, &quot;Tunny&quot;&#x27;s bow planes jammed and the submarine climbed to , then went into a steep glide which took her down to before control was regained. Within five minutes, coolly efficient damage control parties had restored operating conditions to nearly normal, and the submarine began her retirement to the southwest. Once again the sound of screws caused tense moments for those on board &quot;Tunny&quot;, but this time no depth charges fell.

Early that evening, &quot;Tunny&quot; surfaced and headed away from the heavily traveled lanes she had been patrolling in order to assess her damages and effect repairs. Inspection disclosed considerable damage to the bow, ripped-up plating aft of the torpedo room, and sheared-off rivets and bolts. The torpedo room pressure hull was badly dished in between frames; and this damage in turn immobilized the bow plane tilting gears. The explosions had jammed the gyro spindles in the stern torpedo tubes, impaired the usefulness of sound and radar gear, and caused other damage visible throughout the ship. Sailors inspecting topside found fragments of the destructive depth charges scattered over the deck.

For two days, her crew labored to restore her to order and make the necessary repairs. Having done everything within his means to restore &quot;Tunny&quot; to normal operating condition, her commanding officer found her still short of combat readiness. Her bow planes, despite all efforts, were still inoperative; her bow buoyancy tank unusable; and various other problems, which could not be remedied at sea, remained. Thus, on 29 August 1943, she departed her patrol area leaving these hunting grounds to other submarines in better condition. The war-scarred submarine moored at Pearl Harbor on 8 September.

===Fifth war patrol (27 February – 11 April 1944)===
After a preliminary assessment of battle damage, &quot;Tunny&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 11 September 1943. She arrived at Hunters Point, San Francisco, California on 17 September for overhaul and repairs and remained there until 2 February 1944. Then, repairs and tests completed, she departed the West Coast. &quot;Tunny&quot; returned to Hawaii a week later, underwent voyage repairs and training, and departed Pearl Harbor for her fifth war patrol on 27 February.

&quot;Tunny&quot; stopped at Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands on 2 March, got underway the next day for the Palau Islands, and entered her patrol area on 15 March. On 20 March, a persistent observation plane kept &quot;Tunny&quot; down for three hours off the entrance to Toagel Mlungui and dropped eight light bombs without damaging the submarine. In the following days, the submarine patrolled the northern and western approaches to the islands.

On 22 March, &quot;Tunny&quot;″s radar picked up what proved to be a large convoy. Day was breaking, and &quot;Tunny&quot; was maneuvering for a position ahead when an escorting destroyer appeared on the radar at . The enemy soon sighted the submarine and challenged her with a blinker. &quot;Tunny&quot; took advantage of a nearby rain squall for concealment and continued to close the convoy, keeping a watchful eye on the destroyer. Despite bad visibility and the pinging of the escort, &quot;Tunny&quot; continued her approach and soon found herself in the midst of a group of tankers and cargo ships. Choosing two heavily loaded cargo ships for her targets, she launched a six-torpedo attack and heard or observed hits on both. Immediately, attention on board &quot;Tunny&quot; was diverted when a small tanker nearly collided with the submarine. &quot;Tunny&quot; now obtained a setup on a destroyer moving at high speed across her stern, fired four Mark 18 torpedoes, then dove quickly even as depth charges from a nearby trawler exploded on the port quarter. During the next four hours, the Japanese ships dropped 87 depth charges in an effort to finish off the submarine but without effect. Late in the day, &quot;Tunny&quot; surfaced and began a futile search for stragglers and cripples from the morning&#x27;s attack. She found only debris and an oil slick.

At 21:19 on 23 March, while patrolling off Angaur Island, &quot;Tunny&quot; picked up a radar contact which she identified by sight as a large I-class submarine. For nearly an hour and a half, &quot;Tunny&quot; and the enemy submarine maneuvered for position, each attempting to prevent the other from obtaining a shot. Then, at 2324, &quot;Tunny&quot; launched four torpedoes from a range of , swung hard to starboard to prevent a collision, and dove to avoid a possible return attack. Before the hatch was closed, two hits were heard and felt and a flash was seen inside &quot;Tunny&quot;&#x27;s conning tower. For one terrible moment, observers on board &quot;Tunny&quot; feared that their own submarine had been hit. As &quot;Tunny&quot; dove to and began circling the area, the screws of the enemy submarine stopped, and a crackling racket began and continued for an hour. When the noise ceased, &quot;Tunny&quot; surfaced and cleared the area, but had met her end.

&quot;Tunny&quot; returned to waters off Toagel Mlungui and resumed patrols. On the morning of 29 March, she observed a large number of small vessels leaving Malakal Harbor, none worth an attack. Apparently, the enemy had somehow received word of the Fifth Fleet&#x27;s impending bombing attack on Japanese installations in the Caroline Islands and made a desperate attempt to clear the area. Late in the afternoon, a larger formation appeared: the 63,000-ton battleship &quot;Musashi&quot;, the light cruiser , and three destroyers, also fleeing the expected aerial bombardment. After a daring approach, &quot;Tunny&quot; fired six torpedoes at the battleship from her bow tubes. The torpedoes passed directly under an alert destroyer of the screen which immediately hoisted flags to warn the battleship, swung parallel to the torpedo tracks, and made a run on the submarine. &quot;Tunny&quot; went deep and ran for the southwest while the destroyer dropped 38 depth charges in a short, but concentrated counterattack. One torpedo had found its mark on the battleship&#x27;s bow, which caused flooding of the hydrophone compartment and 18 casualties. Toward sunset, the submarine lost contact with the formation. Later that night, she encountered what she thought to be the same force and was held down for two hours by one of the escorting ships. Hits by two of &quot;Tunny&quot;″s torpedoes had damaged but failed to slow the powerful battleship. However, &quot;Musashi&quot; was still forced to return to port for repairs and upgrades, which kept her out of action for most of April.

At 02:00 on 30 March 1944, &quot;Tunny&quot; arrived on station to begin lifeguard duties for the Fifth Fleet&#x27;s air attack on the Palau Islands. At 07:00, a series of explosions followed by the appearance of heavy smoke from the vicinity of the harbor indicated that American planes were finding their mark. During the morning, more than 100 planes passed over the submarine on their return from the strike. Then, as &quot;Tunny&quot; circled on station shortly after 12:00, two TBF Avenger torpedo bombers of U.S. Navy Torpedo Squadron 5 (VT-5) from the aircraft carrier mistook her for a Japanese destroyer. and approached. One sheared off for a strafing attack which it did not complete; the other went into a steep glide and released a bomb. from an altitude of . Incredulous watchers on the submarine saw the bomb cross over the deck gun on the bow, pass the bridge at what appeared to be no more than arm&#x27;s length, and strike the water with a tremendous impact, only to starboard of the forward engine room. The entire ship lifted with a snap as if it had collided with an underwater object, and an explosion followed some seconds later, throwing personnel and gear in all directions in the maneuvering and after torpedo rooms. Damage to the main control cubicle and to &quot;Tunny&quot;&#x27;s remaining torpedoes resulted. &quot;Tunny&quot; completed repairs during the night, and the next morning manned her lifeguard station as before, only a little more wary of &quot;friendly&quot; aircraft.

&quot;Tunny&quot; departed the Palau Islands on 2 April, stopped at Milne Bay on 7 April, and arrived in Australia on 11 April. She received the Presidential Unit Citation for this patrol.

===Sixth war patrol (29 April – 29 June 1944)===
Following refit, the submarine departed Brisbane on 29 April and set her course for New Guinea. She underwent voyage repairs at Milne Bay, then proceeded via Langemak Bay to her patrol area in the Mariana Islands. She arrived in the patrol area on 11 May and, in the days that followed, encountered many enemy planes as she patrolled off Saipan and Guam.

On 17 May, she received a report from submarine of a convoy in the area and set out to intercept it. Late in the afternoon, she sighted the smoke of her quarry; and, just after sunset, the masts came into view. The convoy consisted of three cargo ships escorted by a like number of destroyers. Racing against fading twilight, &quot;Tunny&quot; made her approach; launched a spread of three torpedoes at the second ship of the column; then rapidly fired three more at the last cargo ship. Before the converging escorts forced her down, &quot;Tunny&quot; observed that a hit had left the last ship of the column down by the stern, emitting clouds of dense black smoke. Although the escorting vessels dropped 81 depth charges, none fell close, and &quot;Tunny&quot; withdrew to the southeast, having scored her sixth kill of the war, a 4900-ton cargo ship, the &quot;Nichiwa Maru&quot;. Shortly after midnight, &quot;Tunny&quot; surfaced and saw an ill-fated cargo ship, the victim of &quot;Sand Lance&quot;, ablaze from stem to stern. Frequent minor explosions punctuated the night as the ship went down in the darkness.

As &quot;Tunny&quot; continued patrols in the Mariana Islands, she sighted numerous aircraft and noted explosions and burning ships—apparently the work of sister ship . At this time, however, planes attached to enemy convoys seemed effective in detecting &quot;Tunny&quot; and routing convoys around her, out of range of her torpedoes.

On 8 June, she rendezvoused with submarines and to form a coordinated attack group, the &quot;Blair Blasters.&quot; The three submarines formed a scouting line for a patrol across the western Pacific to the South China Sea. &quot;Tunny&quot; passed through Balintang Channel on 14 June and sighted Luzon the next morning. While returning through Balintang Channel on 16 June, she made a surface approach on a small sampan and sank it with gunfire. She conducted patrols in the Philippine Sea until 22 June when she parted company with the attack group. On 29 June, she fueled at Midway Island; then proceeded to Oahu, having traveled over on her sixth war patrol.

===Seventh war patrol (4 August – 17 September 1944)===
After refitting, she departed Pearl Harbor on 4 August 1944 as a member of a coordinated attack group or &quot;wolfpack&quot; called &quot;Ed&#x27;s Eradicators&quot;. With wolfpack members and , she set her course, via Midway Island, for the South China Sea. She arrived in her patrol area on 25 August. Her first action came hours after midnight on 31 August when the wolfpack attacked a convoy. &quot;Queenfish&quot; was the first to score a hit, and &quot;Tunny&quot; witnessed the explosion of a tanker, the victim of her sister submarine. As &quot;Tunny&quot; maneuvered in the bright moonlight, she was suddenly startled by gunfire, which seemed to those on board to come from all directions. She dove and avoided damage from the depth charges which soon followed. Later on the same day, a hit by &quot;Barb&quot; alerted the convoy&#x27;s air escort to &quot;Tunny&quot;&#x27;s presence; and she was forced down again without opportunity to launch her torpedoes. Time after time, the submarine surfaced only to be forced down by escorting planes as the attack on the convoy continued into the evening.

A second disappointing day came on the heels of the first. &quot;Tunny&quot; patrolled submerged for most of 1 September in order to avoid enemy aircraft. Late in the afternoon, she was advancing westward on a scouting line formed by the wolf pack, when she sighted a plane dead ahead and about six miles (10 km) distant. She immediately began to dive, but 90 seconds later, as she passed , two bombs hit close aboard aft, sending the ship upward at an eight degree angle and causing extensive damage. As the third and fourth bomb exploded, &quot;Tunny&quot; was already heading for to assess her damages.

Inspection disclosed that the bombs had dished in the hull plating in the vicinity of the after torpedo room and the maneuvering room, causing a leak in a vent riser. Less than ten minutes after the Japanese plane had been sighted, the commanding officer decided to discontinue the patrol. Throughout the ship, sheared off valves and bolts, damaged meters, clocks, and gauges attested to the force of the bomb&#x27;s explosion. In addition, all three radio antennas were down, a leak in her pressure hull had been aggravated, and &quot;Tunny&quot;&#x27;s rudder action indicated possible damage. She set her course for Balintang Channel and surfaced late in the day on 2 September. &quot;Tunny&quot; continued to sight Japanese airplanes as she made her way to Hawaii. She completed this patrol on 17 September at Pearl Harbor.

===Eighth war patrol (3 February – 14 April 1945)===
&quot;Tunny&quot; departed Oahu for California on 20 September and on 26 September she arrived at Hunter&#x27;s Point for battle damage repairs and an overhaul. She returned to Hawaii in January 1945 and, after a training period departed Pearl Harbor on 3 February for her eighth war patrol.

On 14 February, she entered Tanapag Harbor and moored to submarine tender for repairs to her main engine. Later in the month, she conducted sonar tests out of that port. On 5 March, she departed Saipan and, in the days that followed, was slowed by heavy seas as she proceeded to her patrol area in the Ryukyu Islands.

On 13 March and 14 March, she conducted a special reconnaissance mission off the Nansei Shoto in preparation for landings planned for Okinawa on 1 April. On 14 March, &quot;Tunny&quot; plotted over 230 mines which she detected on sonar as she traveled through the hazardous waters at . On 15 March, all hands breathed a sigh of relief as &quot;Tunny&quot; got underway for her patrol area, her special mission safely and successfully completed.

Her pursuit of a distant convoy ended in disappointment on 18 March, when a change of course allowed the cargo ships and their escort to slip away from &quot;Tunny&quot; around sunset. For two days, the submarine patrolled off Amami Ōshima; then, on 23 March, she took up a lifeguard station. Days later, as &quot;Tunny&quot; searched for a downed flier, a twin-float enemy plane took her by surprise and dropped two bombs. One fell quite close but caused only minor damage to the submarine. As the month drew to its close, &quot;Tunny&quot; rescued two fliers from aircraft carrier and one from as those ships took part in the assault on Okinawa.

On 1 April, &quot;Tunny&quot; completed her lifeguard duties and set her course for Midway Island. En route, she sank a 200-ton lugger with her deck gun. After stopping at Midway Island, she arrived at Oahu on 14 April.

===Ninth (last) war patrol (14 May – 6 July 1945)===
Following refitting and a week of sonar and approach training, &quot;Tunny&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 14 May for her ninth war patrol. She stopped at Guam for repairs and additional sonar exercises, then got underway on 28 May. Together with submarines and , &quot;Tunny&quot; formed the second group of &quot;Hydeman&#x27;s Hellcats&quot; known as &quot;Pierce&#x27;s Polecats.&quot; On 2 June, &quot;Tunny&quot; passed through the Nansei Shoto and, as she approached Kyūshū two days later, encountered increasing small boat traffic. On 5 June, &quot;Tunny&quot; passed through Korea Strait, repeating the hair-raising task of mine detection by sonar, this time in Nishi Suido. She plotted over 80 mines; then continued on to conduct patrols on the western shore of Honshū.

Operating in the supposedly inviolable waters of the Sea of Japan, the wolf pack attacked shipping and made exploratory attempts to enter Japanese harbors. Late on 9 June, &quot;Tunny&quot; attacked a cargo vessel. One torpedo hit the enemy vessel with a thud but failed to explode, and &quot;Tunny&quot; discontinued the attack. In the harbor entering phase of the patrol, &quot;Tunny&quot; closed the breakwater of Etomo Ko to 8,000 yards (7.3 km) shortly before midnight on 12 June. Town and waterfront lights provided illumination, but no suitable target could be found, and the submarine cleared the harbor before midnight. A few minutes later, &quot;Tunny&quot; approached within of the harbor mouth at Uppuri Wan but discreetly withdrew when searchlights located and then brilliantly illuminated the intruder.

On 16 June, &quot;Tunny&quot; sighted numerous rafts filled with the Japanese survivors of a successful action by &quot;Bonefish&quot; and later took prisoner a Japanese chief petty officer who had escaped from the sinking ship. On the following day, as &quot;Tunny&quot; and &quot;Bonefish&quot; closed a radar-located target, &quot;Tunny&quot; suddenly found herself the object of gunfire, with the closest shot falling only off her port beam. She quickly changed course and eluded both the gunfire and the depth charges which followed. On 19 June, shallow coastal water foiled &quot;Tunny&quot;&#x27;s attack on a 4,000-ton cargo ship.

&quot;Tunny&quot; rendezvoused with &quot;Skate&quot; on 23 June to depart the Sea of Japan. She remained off Hokkaidō for two days on the chance that she might be able to aid &quot;Bonefish&quot;, missing since her request to make a daylight submerged patrol of Toyama Wan some days earlier. On 27 June, &quot;Tunny&quot; discontinued her vigil; proceeded via the Kuril Islands and Midway Island; and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 6 July.

The submarine then made her way back to the west coast. &quot;Tunny&quot; was decommissioned on 13 December 1945 and placed in the Mare Island Group, 19th Fleet.

==Post-war missile testing and deterrent patrols==
The war in Korea placed new demands on the resources of the Navy and led to &quot;Tunnys being placed in commission, in reserve, on 28 February 1952. She saw no service at this time, however, and was decommissioned in April 1952. On 6 March 1953, she was placed in commission for the third time. Converted to carry guided missiles under project SCB 28, she was reclassified as SSG-282&quot;&#x27; and was armed with the Regulus I nuclear cruise missile for nearly 12 years. In this role, &quot;Tunny&quot; was equipped with a hangar housing two missiles and a launcher on the after deck. One of the limitations of Regulus was that the firing submarine had to surface, the missile then being rolled out onto the launcher and fired. Regulus I also required guidance from submarines or other platforms after firing. In 1955, a second World War II submarine, , was also converted to fire Regulus I.

For the first four of those years she operated out of Port Hueneme, contributing to the development of the Regulus missile system. Except for a short period of type training, &quot;Tunny&quot; engaged entirely in the launching and guidance of Regulus missiles for purposes of missile evaluation in the development of the system. In 1957, she shifted her base of operations to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, bringing Regulus to initial operational capability, where she conducted the first submarine deterrent patrols and fired exercise missiles.

==Vietnam operations==
In May 1965, the Regulus missile system was phased out, having been superseded by the Polaris missile, and &quot;Tunny&quot; was redesignated with hull classification symbol SS-282. She remained in the Hawaiian operating area until the end of the year, conducting training exercises and providing various other services. In 1966, she was converted to a troop-carrying submarine and redesignated with hull classification symbol APSS-282, being re-equipped with a deck shelter for small amphibious vehicles and other equipment. In February 1967, &quot;Tunny&quot; began missions in unconventional warfare, operating off the coast of Vietnam. She conducted reconnaissance in preparation for amphibious assault operations and gathered navigational and oceanographic information. Ideally suited for transporting small teams for specialized operations as well as for gathering information, she participated in Operation Deckhouse VI.

On 1 January 1968, the veteran submarine was reclassified LPSS-282. She was decommissioned on 28 June 1969, and, on 30 June 1969, her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. She was sunk as a target on 19 June 1970.

==Awards==


In April 1997, officers and men of &quot;Tunny&quot; and the other four US Navy submarines that conducted strategic deterrent patrols in the Western Pacific between 1959 and 1964 were awarded the right to wear the Navy&#x27;s SSBN Deterrent Patrol insignia.

<text>USS &quot;Tunny&quot; (SSN-682), a &quot;Sturgeon&quot;-class attack submarine, was the second submarine of the United States Navy to be named for the tunny, any of several oceanic fishes resembling the tuna.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract for&quot;Tunny&quot;″s construction was awarded on 25 June 1968 and her keel was laid down on 22 May 1970 at Pascagoula, Mississippi, by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries. She was launched on 10 June 1972, sponsored by Mrs. Lola Aiken, and commissioned on 26 January 1974 at her home port, Charleston, South Carolina.

==Service history==
===1974===
&quot;Tunny&quot; remained at Charleston until March 1974, when she moved to Groton, Connecticut, for two weeks of in-port training at the submarine base. Between March and June 1974, she conducted shakedown training in the West Indies and along the United States East Coast. From June to August 1974, she conducted operations out of Charleston before heading north to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard at Kittery, Maine, where she began post-shakedown on 12 August 1974. She completed repairs on 5 October 1974 and headed back to Charleston, where she resumed normal training operations.

===1975===
In February 1975, &quot;Tunny&quot; began preparations for her first deployment to the Mediterranean Sea. She stood out of Charleston on 6 March 1975 and headed across the Atlantic Ocean. She came under operational control of the United States Sixth Fleet on 16 March 1975. During the first part of her tour in the Mediterranean, she operated with Task Force 60, conducting antisubmarine warfare exercises with the other ships of the task force. Following refit and upkeep alongside a submarine tender in June and early July 1975 at Santo Stefano, Sardinia, Italy, &quot;Tunny&quot; rejoined the Sixth Fleet as a unit of Task Force 69 and resumed antisubmarine warfare training. After participating in a major Sixth Fleet exercise late in July and early in August 1975, she departed the Mediterranean for home. She changed operational control from the Sixth Fleet to the United States Atlantic Fleet Submarine Force on 17 August 1975 and arrived in Charleston, concluding her deployment, on 29 August 1975. After a routine post-deployment standdown in September and repairs and alterations Charleston Naval Shipyard at Charleston in October and November, she resumed operations—mostly attack submarine training—out of Charleston on 20 November 1975.

===1976===
Attack submarine training along the South Carolina and Florida coasts occupied her time during January 1976. February 1976 brought inspections and examinations and, in March 1976, she participated in two special operations designed to help develop and evaluate submarine tactics. In May 1976, &quot;Tunny&quot; began preparations for her second tour of duty with the Sixth Fleet but did not embark upon that assignment for over two months. In the meantime, she conducted an exercise in naval mine warfare in June 1976. Finally, on 26 July 1976, she departed Charleston on her way to the Mediterranean. Following a visit to Lisbon, Portugal, she joined the Sixth Fleet on 11 August 1976. After a month of antisubmarine warfare training, highlighted by Exercise &quot;National Week XXI&quot;, she put into Santo Stefano for a month of upkeep alongside submarine tender . In October 1976, she returned to sea for antisubmarine warfare training operations punctuated periodically with a visit to Naples, Italy, or upkeep at Santo Stefano. That routine continued until 11 December 1976, when she departed Santo Stefano to return to the United States. Arriving in Charleston on 22 December 1976, she commenced a combination of Christmas holiday leave and upkeep and a routine post-deployment standdown.

===1977===
January 1977 found &quot;Tunny&quot; undergoing an extensive upkeep following her Mediterranean deployment. She then resumed operations off the U.S. East Coast which extended through the spring and summer months. In mid-September 1977, she commenced a two-month period of repairs and alterations at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia, which was concluded in late November, followed by a short sea trial period. Following refresher training at the Submarine School at Naval Submarine Base New London at New London, Connecticut, &quot;Tunny&quot; returned to Charleston.

===1978===
&quot;Tunny&quot; spent January and part of February 1978 preparing for a North Atlantic Ocean deployment which commenced in late February and concluded in late April. Tunny made stops in Dunoon, Scotland and Portland, England.

In July 1978, &quot;Tunny&quot;″s home port was changed to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. She transited the Panama Canal and briefly crossed the equator on her voyage to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 19 August 1978. &quot;Tunny&quot; was assigned to Submarine Squadron 1, and devoted the remainder of 1978 to operations in the Hawaiian Islands in preparation for a 1979 deployment to the Western Pacific.

===1979–1997===
&quot;Tunny&quot; departed for Western Pacific at the beginning of 1979. She visited various ports during the deployment, including Amphoe Sattahip in Thailand, and Orote Point in Guam. She also entered the Indian Ocean, where she visited the U.S. naval base at Diego Garcia in the British Indian Ocean Territory. She was a guest of the Royal Australian Navy when she visited , the administrative center of the Royal Australian Navy&#x27;s main naval base on the west coast of Australia, located on Garden Island just off the coast of Western Australia near the city of Perth, and &quot;Tunny&quot;″s crew participated in the ANZAC Day Parade in April 1979. &quot;Tunny&quot; completed her six-month deployment to the Western Pacific when she returned to Pearl Harbor in June 1979.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Tunny&quot; was deactivated while still in commission on 1 October 1997, and was both decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 13 March 1998. Her scrapping via the U.S. Navy″s Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program began on 1 October 1997 and was completed on 27 October 1998.

<doc id="404982" wikidata="Q298789" url="?curid=404982" title="Santiago Carrillo">
<text>Santiago José Carrillo Solares (18 January 1915 – 18 September 2012) was a Spanish politician who served as General Secretary of the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) from 1960 to 1982.

He was exiled during the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, becoming a leader of the democratic opposition to the regime. His role as leader of the PCE made him a key figure in the transition to democracy. He later embraced Eurocommunism and democratic socialism, and was a member of the Congress of Deputies from 1977 to 1986.

== Childhood and early youth ==
Born in Gijón, Asturias province, into the House of Carrillo, Santiago Carrillo was the son of Socialist leader Wenceslao Carrillo and María Rosalía Solares Martínez. When he was six years old, his family moved to Madrid. After attending school, he began to work in &quot;El Socialista&quot;, the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) newspaper at the age of 13. At the same time, he joined the Socialist Union, the Workers&#x27; General Union and the Socialist Youth.

== Second Republic and Civil War ==
In 1932, Carrillo joined the Executive Commission of the Socialist Youth and became editor of its newspaper, &quot;Renovación&quot;. Carrillo belonged to the left wing of the organisation. In 1933, as the Socialist Youth was becoming more radical, Carrillo was elected as General Secretary. From October 1934 to February 1936 he was jailed, due to his participation in the failed 1934 leftist coup (Carrillo was a member of the National Revolutionary Committee).

After his release, in March 1936, Carrillo and the executive of the Socialist Youth travelled to Moscow to meet the leaders of the Young Communist International and prepare the unification of Socialist and Communist youth leagues.
He was accompanied on the visit to Moscow by Leandro Carro and Juan Astigarrabía.
The result was the creation of the Unified Socialist Youth (&quot;Juventudes Socialistas Unificadas&quot;).

After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Carrillo joined the Communist Party and did so on the day the government left Madrid in November. During the war, he was intensely pro-Soviet. On 7 November 1936 Carrillo was elected Councillor for Public Order in the Defence Council of Madrid, which was given supreme power in besieged Madrid, after the government left the city.

During his term, several thousand military and civilian prisoners were killed by republican groups in the Paracuellos massacres at Paracuellos del Jarama and Torrejón de Ardoz (the biggest mass killings by the Republican side during the Civil War). The dead were buried in common graves. Carrillo denied any knowledge of the massacres in his memoirs but some historians like César Vidal and Pío Moa maintain that Carrillo was involved. In an interview with the historian Ian Gibson, Carrillo set out his version of events concerning the massacre. In the preface of the second edition of his book, Ian Gibson maintains that Cesar Vidal twisted and misrepresented his sources in order to indict Carrillo.

In March 1939 Madrid surrendered after Casado&#x27;s coup against the Negrín administration and its close ally, the Communist Party, which sought to continue the resistance until the expected outbreak of the World War. Carrillo&#x27;s father, Wenceslao, a member of the PSOE, was among those who led the coup and was a member of Casado&#x27;s Junta. Some weeks before, Carrillo&#x27;s mother had died. Carrillo then wrote an open letter to his father describing the coup as counter-revolutionary and as a betrayal, reproaching him for his anti-communism, and renouncing any further communication with him. In his memoirs, Carrillo states that the letter was written on 7 March. However, journalist and historian Carlos Fernández published the letter in 1983, as it had been published in &quot;Correspondance International&quot;; it was dated 15 May.

After the military collapse of the Republican Government, Carrillo fled to Paris and worked to reorganise the party. Carrillo spent 38 years in exile, most of the time in France, but also in the USSR and other countries.

== Exile ==

In 1944 Carrillo led the retreat of the communist guerrillas from the Aran Valley.

According to the historian and politician Ricardo de la Cierva, in 1945 Carrillo ordered the execution of fellow communist party member Gabriel León Trilla In 2005 Carrillo said &quot;yo he tenido que eliminar a alguna persona&quot; (I have had to eliminate someone).

Between April 1946 and January 1947, he served as minister wthout portfolio in the Republican government-in-exile led by José Giral.

In August 1948, Carrillo met Soviet leader Joseph Stalin.

Carrillo became the General Secretary of the PCE in 1960, replacing Dolores Ibárruri (&quot;La Pasionaria&quot;), who was given the honorary post of Party Chairman. Carrillo&#x27;s policies were aimed at strengthening the party&#x27;s position among the working class and intellectual groups , and survived opposition from Marxist–Leninist, Stalinist and social democratic factions. In 1968, when the Soviets and Warsaw Pact countries invaded Czechoslovakia, Carrillo distanced the party from Moscow.

He fought for the total independence of the party from the Soviet Union and for a peaceful return to democracy in Spain.

== Spanish transition and Eurocommunism ==
Carrillo returned secretly to Spain in 1976 after the death of long-time Spanish Francisco Franco.
He disguised his bald head with a wig provided by Eugenio Arias, Picasso&#x27;s barber.
He was entered from France in the Mercedes of millionaire communist sympathizer .
Arrested by the police, he was released within days. Together with communist party leaders Georges Marchais of France and Enrico Berlinguer of Italy, he launched the Eurocommunist movement in a meeting held in Madrid on March 2, 1977. 

In the first democratic elections in 1977, shortly after the legalization of the PCE (9 April 1977) by the government of Adolfo Suárez, Carrillo was elected to the Spanish Congress of Deputies (Congreso de los Diputados), the lower house of the Spanish Parliament, the Cortes Generales to represent the Madrid district. Throughout the transition period, Carrillo&#x27;s authority and leadership were decisive in securing peaceful evolution towards a democratic system, a constructive approach based on dialogue with opponents, and a healing of the wounds from the Civil War (the &quot;Reconciliation&quot; policy). It is widely acknowledged that this policy played a key role in making possible a peaceful transition to democracy.

Carrillo was re-elected in 1979, but the failed right-wing coup d&#x27;état attempt on 23 February 1981 reduced support for the PCE, as Spanish society was still recovering from the trauma of the Civil War and subsequent repression and dictatorship. This was despite Carrillo&#x27;s celebrated and highly public defiance of the coup plotters in the chamber of deputies - he was one of the three members who refused to obey by laying on the ground, even when they shot into the air.

Fear of another military uprising increased support for moderate left-wing forces in the 1982 elections, in which Carrillo held his parliamentary seat. He was forced to leave his post as party leader on 6 November 1982, owing to the party&#x27;s poor electoral performance.

==Leaving the Spanish Communist Party==
On 15 April 1985, Carrillo and his followers were expelled from the PCE, and in 1986 they formed their own political group, the Workers Party of Spain-Communist Unity (PTE-UC). This tiny party was unable to attract enough voters, so on 27 October 1991, Carrillo announced that it would be disbanded. Subsequently, the PTE-UC merged into the ruling PSOE, but Carrillo declined PSOE membership considering his many years as a communist member.

==Retirement and death==
On 20 October 2005, Carrillo was granted an honorary doctorate by the Autonomous University of Madrid. The action of the university was strongly criticized by right-wing commentators. Carrillo had retired from public life at the time of his death at his home in Madrid at the age of 97 on 18 September 2012. He was cremated in Madrid on 20 September.

<text>Little Roger and the Goosebumps is a pop/rock band from San Francisco active during the 1970s and early 1980s and resurrected in 2006. It has been led throughout its history by Roger Clark and Dick Bright, with various sidemen.

The band is best known for its single &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island (Stairway)&quot; a song combining the lyrics to the theme song of the television show &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; with the music of &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; by Led Zeppelin. The band wrote the song in 1977 as &quot;material to pad the last set of the grueling 5 nights a week/4 sets a night routine,&quot; recorded it in March 1978, and released it as a single in May 1978 on their own Splash Records label. Led Zeppelin&#x27;s management threatened a copyright infringement lawsuit against the label, its attorneys demanding that all copies be destroyed, and the band withdrew the song, seeing their legal resources as inadequate. The song was reissued in 2000 on the CD &quot;Laguna Tunes&quot; with the song title renamed &quot;Stairway to Gilligan&#x27;s Island.&quot;

In 1980 they released their Christmas single &quot;Xmas in the Hot Tub&quot;.

During a 2004 interview on National Public Radio, Robert Plant referred to the tune as his favorite cover of &quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot;

The famous conman &quot;Clark Rockefeller&quot; and his young daughter Snooks used to sing the Stairway/Gilligan&#x27;s mix.

The band recorded their next single, &quot;Kennedy Girl&quot; (based on Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot;), in 1980, then waited over a quarter-century before producing their debut album &quot;They Hate Us Cuz We&#x27;re Beautiful&quot;, featuring new recordings of 14 songs drawn from three decades of original material.

Their single &quot;Fudd on the Hill,&quot; essentially a performance of &quot;Fool on the Hill&quot; by Looney Tunes character Elmer Fudd, was included on the novelty compilation album &quot;The Rhino Brothers Present the World&#x27;s Worst Records, Volume 2&quot;.

<text>New Mathematics or New Math was a dramatic but temporary change in the way mathematics was taught in American grade schools, and to a lesser extent in European countries and elsewhere, during the 1950s1970s.

== Overview ==

In 1957, the U.S. National Science Foundation funded the development of several new curricula in the sciences, such as the Physical Science Study Committee high school physics curriculum, Biological Sciences Curriculum Study in biology, and CHEM Study in chemistry. Several mathematics curriculum development efforts were also funded as part of the same initiative, such as the Madison Project, School Mathematics Study Group, and University of Illinois Committee on School Mathematics.

These curricula were quite diverse, yet shared the idea that children&#x27;s learning of arithmetic algorithms would last past the exam only if memorization and practice were paired with teaching for &quot;comprehension.&quot; More specifically, elementary school arithmetic beyond single digits makes sense only on the basis of understanding place value. This goal was the reason for teaching arithmetic in bases other than ten in the New Math, despite critics&#x27; derision: In that unfamiliar context, students couldn&#x27;t just mindlessly follow an algorithm, but had to think why the place value of the &quot;hundreds&quot; digit in base seven is 49. Keeping track of non-decimal notation also explains the need to distinguish &quot;numbers&quot; (values) from the &quot;numerals&quot; that represent them.

Topics introduced in the New Math include set theory, modular arithmetic, algebraic inequalities, bases other than 10, matrices, symbolic logic, Boolean algebra, and abstract algebra.

All of the New Math projects emphasized some form of &quot;discovery learning.&quot; Students worked in groups to invent theories about problems posed in the textbooks. Materials for teachers described the classroom as &quot;noisy.&quot; Part of the job of the teacher was to move from table to table assessing the theory that each group of students had developed and &quot;torpedo&quot; wrong theories by providing counterexamples. For that style of teaching to be tolerable for students, they had to experience the teacher as a colleague rather than as an adversary or as someone concerned mainly with grading. New Math workshops for teachers, therefore, spent as much effort on the pedagogy as on the mathematics.

== Criticism ==
Parents and teachers who opposed the New Math in the U.S. complained that the new curriculum was too far outside of students&#x27; ordinary experience and was not worth taking time away from more traditional topics, such as arithmetic. The material also put new demands on teachers, many of whom were required to teach material they did not fully understand. Parents were concerned that they did not understand what their children were learning and could not help them with their studies. In an effort to learn the material, many parents attended their children&#x27;s classes. In the end, it was concluded that the experiment was not working, and New Math fell out of favor before the end of the 1960s, though it continued to be taught for years thereafter in some school districts.

In the Algebra preface of his book, &quot;Precalculus Mathematics in a Nutshell&quot;, Professor George F. Simmons wrote that the New Math produced students who had &quot;heard of the commutative law, but did not know the multiplication table&quot;.

In 1965, physicist Richard Feynman wrote in the essay, &quot;New Textbooks for the &quot;New&quot; Mathematics&quot;:

In his book &quot;Why Johnny Can&#x27;t Add: The Failure of the New Math&quot; (1973), Morris Kline says that certain advocates of the new topics &quot;ignored completely the fact that mathematics is a cumulative development and that it is practically impossible to learn the newer creations, if one does not know the older ones&quot;. Furthermore, noting the trend to abstraction in New Math, Kline says &quot;abstraction is not the first stage, but the last stage, in a mathematical development&quot;.

As a result of this controversy, and despite the ongoing influence of the New Math, the phrase &quot;new math&quot; was often used to describe any short-lived fad that quickly becomes discredited until around the turn of the millennium. In 1999, &quot;Time&quot; placed it on a list of the 100 worst ideas of the 20th century.

== In other countries ==
In the broader context, reform of school mathematics curricula was also pursued in European countries, such as the United Kingdom (particularly by the School Mathematics Project), and France due to concerns that mathematics as taught in schools was becoming too disconnected from mathematics research, in particular that of the Bourbaki group. In West Germany the changes were seen as part of a larger process of &quot;Bildungsreform&quot;. Beyond the use of set theory and different approach to arithmetic, characteristic changes were transformation geometry in place of the traditional deductive Euclidean geometry, and an approach to calculus that was based on greater insight, rather than emphasis on facility.

Again, the changes were met with a mixed reception, but for different reasons. For example, the end-users of mathematics studies were at that time mostly in the physical sciences and engineering, and they expected manipulative skill in calculus rather than more abstract ideas. Some compromises have since been required, given that discrete mathematics is the basic language of computing.

Teaching in the USSR did not experience such extreme upheavals, while being kept in tune, both with the applications and academic trends:

In Japan, New Math was supported by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), but not without encountering problems, leading to student-centred approaches.

==In popular culture==
* Musician and university mathematics lecturer Tom Lehrer wrote a satirical song named &quot;New Math&quot; (from his 1965 album &quot;That Was the Year That Was&quot;), which revolved around the process of subtracting 173 from 342 in decimal and octal. The song is in the style of a lecture about the general concept of subtraction with positional notation in an arbitrary base, illustrated by two simple calculations, and highlights the New Math&#x27;s emphasis on insight and abstract concepts – as Lehrer sardonically put it, &quot;In the new approach ... the important thing is to understand what you&#x27;re doing, rather than to get the right answer.&quot; At one point in the song, he notes that &quot;you&#x27;ve got thirteen and you take away seven, and that leaves five... well, six, actually, but the idea is the important thing.&quot; The chorus pokes fun at parents&#x27; frustration and confusion over the entire method: &quot;Hooray for New Math, New Math / It won&#x27;t do you a bit of good to review math / It&#x27;s so simple, so very simple / That only a child can do it.&quot;
* In 1965, cartoonist Charles Schulz authored a series of &quot;Peanuts&quot; strips, which detailed kindergartener Sally&#x27;s frustrations with New Math. In the first strip, she is depicted puzzling over &quot;sets, one-to-one matching, equivalent sets, non-equivalent sets, sets of one, sets of two, renaming two, subsets, joining sets, number sentences, placeholders.&quot; Eventually, she bursts into tears and exclaims, &quot;All I want to know is, how much is two and two?&quot; This series of strips was later adapted for the 1973 &quot;Peanuts&quot; animated special &quot;There&#x27;s No Time for Love, Charlie Brown&quot;. Schulz also drew a one-panel illustration of Charlie Brown at his school desk exclaiming, &quot;How can you do &#x27;New Math&#x27; problems with an &#x27;Old Math&#x27; mind?&quot;
* In the 1966 &quot;Hazel&quot; episode &quot;A Little Bit of Genius&quot;, the show tackles the division that the introduction of New Math wrought between families, friends, and neighbors, as well as its impact on the then ever-widening generation gap.

<text>Dietrich Eckart (; 23 March 1868 – 26 December 1923) was a German &quot;völkisch&quot; poet, playwright, journalist, publicist, and political activist who was one of the founders of the German Workers&#x27; Party, the precursor of the Nazi Party. Eckart was a key influence on Adolf Hitler in the early years of the Party, the original publisher of the party newspaper, the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; (&quot;Folkist Observer&quot;), and the lyricist of the first party anthem, &quot;Sturmlied&quot; (&quot;Storming Song&quot;). He was a participant in the failed Beer Hall Putsch in 1923 and died on 26 December of that year, shortly after his release from Landsberg Prison, of a heart attack.

Eckart was elevated to the status of a major thinker upon the establishment of Nazi Germany in 1933. He was acknowledged by Hitler to be the spiritual co-founder of Nazism and &quot;a guiding light of the early National Socialist movement.&quot;

==Early life==

Eckart was born on 23 March 1868 in Neumarkt, about southeast of Nuremberg in the Kingdom of Bavaria, the son of Christian Eckart, a royal notary and lawyer, and his wife Anna, a devout Catholic. Eckart&#x27;s mother died when he was ten years old and he was expelled from several schools. In 1895, his father died, leaving him a considerable amount of money that Eckart soon spent.

Eckart initially studied law at Erlangen, later medicine at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, and was an eager member of the fencing and drinking Student Korps. He decided in 1891 to become a poet, playwright, and journalist. Diagnosed with morphine addiction and nearly stranded, he moved to Berlin in 1899. There he wrote a number of plays, often autobiographical, and became the protégé of Count Georg von Hülsen-Haeseler (1858–1922), the artistic director of the Prussian Royal Theatre. After a duel, Eckart was incarcerated at the Passau Oberhaus.

As a playwright Eckart had success with his 1912 adaptation of Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, which played for more than 600 performances in Berlin alone. Although Eckart never had another theatrical success like &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, and blamed his numerous failures on the influence of Jews in German culture, that one play not only made him wealthy, it gave him the social contacts that he later used to introduce Hitler to dozens of important German citizens. These introductions proved to be pivotal in Hitler&#x27;s rise to power. Later on, Eckart developed an ideology of a &quot;genius superman&quot;, based on writings by the &quot;Völkisch&quot; author Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels and by philosopher Otto Weininger. Eckart saw himself following the tradition of Heinrich Heine, Arthur Schopenhauer and Angelus Silesius. He also became fascinated by the Buddhist doctrine of &quot;Maya&quot;, or illusion.

From 1907 Eckart lived with his brother Wilhelm in the Döberitz mansion colony west of the Berlin city limits. In 1913 he married Rose Marx, an affluent widow from Bad Blankenburg, and returned to Munich.

==Eckart&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;==

In Eckart&#x27;s five-act version of Ibsen&#x27;s piece, the play became &quot;a powerful dramatisation of nationalist and antisemitic ideas&quot;, in which Gynt represents the superior Germanic hero, struggling against implicitly Jewish &quot;trolls&quot;. In Ibsen&#x27;s original play, Peer Gynt leaves Norway to become the &quot;king of the world&quot;, but through his selfish and deceptive actions his body and soul are ruined, and he returns to his native village in shame. Eckart, however, sees Gynt as a hero who challenges the trollish, i.e. Jewish, world. His transgressions are therefore noble, and Gynt returns to reclaim the innocence of his youth. This conception of the character was influenced by Eckart&#x27;s hero, Otto Weininger, who led him to see Gynt as an antisemitic genius. In this racial allegory, the trolls and Dovregubben (&quot;Dovre Giant&quot;) represent Weininger&#x27;s concept of &quot;Jewishness&quot;.

Eckart later wrote to Hitler—in a copy of the play he presented to him shortly after Hitler became the Nazi Party Fuhrer—that &quot;[Gynt&#x27;s] idea of becoming the king of the world should not be taken literally as the &#x27;Will to Power&#x27;. Hidden behind this is a spiritual belief that he will ultimately be pardoned for all his sins.&quot; He counseled Hitler that in his quest to be the &quot;German Messiah&quot; his ends justified the means he used, so he need not be concerned about employing violence or other transgressions of societal norms because, like Gynt, he would be forgiven for his sins. In his introduction to the play, Eckart wrote &quot;[It is by] German nature, which means, in the broader sense, the capability of self-sacrifice itself, that the world will heal, and find its way back to the pure divine, but only after a bloody war of annihilation against the united army of the &#x27;trolls&#x27;; in other words, against the Midgard Serpent encircling the earth, the reptilian incarnation of the lie.&quot;

==Antisemitism and foundation of the German Workers&#x27; Party (DAP)==
Eckart was not always an antisemite. In 1898, for instance, Eckart wrote and had published a poem extolling the virtues and beauty of a Jewish girl. Before his conversion to antisemitism, the two people he admired most were the poet Heinrich Heine and Otto Weininger, who were both Jews. Weininger, however, had converted to Protestantism, and has been described as a &quot;self-hating Jew&quot; eventually espousing antisemitic views. Eckart&#x27;s admiration for Weininger may have played a part in his conversion.

In December 1918, Eckart founded, published and edited the antisemitic weekly &quot;Auf gut Deutsch&quot; (&quot;In plain German&quot;) —with financial support from the Thule Society—working with Alfred Rosenberg, whom he called his &quot;co-warrior against Jerusalem&quot;, and Gottfried Feder. A fierce critic of the German Revolution and the Weimar Republic, he vehemently opposed the Treaty of Versailles, which he viewed as treason, and was a proponent of the so-called stab-in-the-back legend (&quot;Dolchstoßlegende&quot;), according to which the Social Democrats and Jews were to blame for Germany&#x27;s defeat in the war.

Eckart&#x27;s antisemitism was influenced by the publication &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, which had been brought to Germany by &quot;white Russian&quot; &quot;emigrés&quot; fleeing the October Revolution. The book purported to outline the international Jewish conspiracy for control of the world, and many right-wing and &quot;völkisch&quot; political figures believed it to be a true account.

After living in Berlin for many years, Eckart moved to Munich in 1913, the same year that Hitler moved there from Vienna. In January 1919, he, Feder, Anton Drexler and Karl Harrer founded the &quot;Deutsche Arbeiterpartei&quot; (German Workers&#x27; Party, or DAP). In order to increase its appeal to larger segments of the population, in February 1920 it changed its name to the &quot;Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei&quot; (National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party, or NSDAP); more commonly known as the Nazi Party. Eckart was largely responsible for the party buying the &quot;Münchener Beobachter&quot; in December 1920, when he arranged for the loan which paid for it. The 60,000 Marks came from German Army funds available to General Franz Ritter von Epp, and the loan was secured with Eckart&#x27;s house and possessions as collateral, with Dr. Gottfried Grandel, an Augsburg chemist and factory owner who was Eckart&#x27;s friend and a funder of the Party, as guarantor. The newspaper was renamed the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; and became the party&#x27;s official organ, with Eckart as its first editor and publisher. He also created the Nazi slogan &quot;Deutschland erwache&quot; (&quot;Germany awake&quot;), and wrote the lyrics for the anthem based on it, the &quot;Sturm-Lied&quot;.

In 1921 Eckart promised 1,000 Marks to everyone who could cite one Jewish family whose sons had served longer than three weeks at the front during the First World War. The Hannover rabbi Samuel Freund named 20 Jewish families who met this condition and sued Eckart when he refused to pay the reward. During the trial, Freund named 50 more Jewish families with up to seven veterans, among whom were several which lost up to three sons in the war. Eckart lost the case and had to pay.

==Eckart and Hitler==
Eckart was instrumental in creating the persona of Adolf Hitler as one of the future dictator&#x27;s most important early mentors, and was one of the first propagators of the &quot;Hitler Myth&quot;. Their relationship was not simply a political one, as there was a strong emotional and intellectual bond between the two men, described by some as an almost symbiotic relationship. It was Eckart who gave to Hitler his philosophy of the necessity of overcoming &quot;soulless Jewishness&quot; as the basis for a true German revolution, unlike the false revolution of 1918. Although the need to present himself as a self-made man prevented him from publicly writing or speaking about the debt he owed to Eckart, in private Hitler acknowledged Eckart as having been his teacher and mentor, and the spiritual co-founder of Nazism.

The two first met when Hitler gave a speech before the DAP membership in the winter of 1919. Hitler immediately impressed Eckart, who said of him &quot;I felt myself attracted by his whole way of being, and very soon I realized that he was exactly the right man for our young movement.&quot; It is probably Nazi legend that Eckart said about Hitler on their first meeting &quot;That&#x27;s Germany&#x27;s next great man –one day the whole world will talk about him.&quot; He was not a member of the Thule Society.

Eckart, who was 21 years older than Hitler, became the father-figure to a group of younger &quot;volkisch&quot; men, including Hitler and Hermann Esser, and acted as mediator between the two when they clashed, telling Esser that Hitler, whom he esteemed as the DAP&#x27;s best speaker, was the far superior man. He became Hitler&#x27;s mentor, exchanging ideas with him and helping to establish theories and beliefs of the Party. He lent Hitler books to read, gave him a trench coat to wear, and made corrections to Hitler&#x27;s style of speaking and writing. Hitler was to say later &quot;Stylistically I was still an infant.&quot; Eckart also schooled the provincial Hitler in proper manners, and regarded Hitler as his &quot;protégé&quot;.

Hitler and Eckart had many things in common, including their interest in art and politics, that both thought of themselves primarily as artists, and both were prone to depression. They also shared that their early influences were Jewish, a fact which both preferred not to speak about. Although, unlike Hitler, Eckart did not believe that Jews were a race apart, by the time the two met, Hitler&#x27;s goal was &quot;the total removal of the Jews&quot;, and Eckart had expressed the opinion that all Jews should be put on a train and driven into the Red Sea. He also espoused that any Jew who married a German woman should be jailed for three years, and executed if he repeated the crime. Paradoxically, Eckart also believed that the existence of humanity depended on the antithesis between Aryans and Jews, that one could not exist without the other. In 1919, Eckart had written that it would be &quot;the end of all times ... if the Jewish people perished.&quot;

Eckart provided Hitler with &quot;entré&quot; into the Munich arts scene. He introduced Hitler to the painter Max Zaeper and his salon of like-minded antisemitic artists, and to the photographer Heinrich Hoffmann. It was Eckart who introduced Alfred Rosenberg to Hitler. Between 1920 and 1923, Eckart and Rosenberg labored tirelessly in the service of Hitler and the party. Through Rosenberg, Hitler was introduced to the writings of Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Rosenberg&#x27;s inspiration. Both Rosenberg and Eckart were influential with Hitler on the subject of Russia. Eckart saw Russia as Germany&#x27;s natural ally, writing in 1919 that &quot;German politics hardly has another choice than to enter an alliance with a new Russia after the elimination of the Bolshevik regime.&quot; He felt strongly that Germany should support the Russian people in their struggle against the &quot;current Jewish regime&quot;, by which he meant the Bolsheviks. Rosenberg also counseled Hitler along these lines, with the two men providing Hitler with the intellectual basis for his Eastern policy, which was then made practical by Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter.

In March 1920, at the behest of Karl Mayr –the German General Staff officer who had first introduced Hitler to politics– Hitler and Eckart flew to Berlin to meet Wolfgang Kapp and take part in the Kapp Putsch, as well as to forge a connection between Kapp&#x27;s forces and Mayr. Kapp and Eckart knew each other - Kapp had donated 1,000 Marks in support of Eckart&#x27;s weekly magazine. However, the trip was not a success: Hitler, who wore a false beard, was afraid of heights and got airsick on the way –it was his first airplane flight– and when they arrived in Berlin, the &quot;putsch&quot; was already collapsing. Nor did they create a positive impression with the Berliners: Captain Waldemar Pabst is said to have told them &quot;The way you look and talk –people are going to laugh at you.&quot;

Eckart introduced Hitler to wealthy potential donors connected to the &quot;völkisch&quot; movement. They worked together to raise money for the DAP in Munich, using Eckart&#x27;s contacts, but did not have great success. In Berlin, however, where Eckart was better connected with the rich and powerful, they raised considerable funds, including from senior officials of the Pan-German League. Together, they made frequent trips to the capital. During one of them, Eckart introduced Hitler to his future etiquette tutor, socialite Helene Bechstein, and it was through her that Hitler began to move among the upper class of Berlin.

In June 1921, while Hitler and Eckart were on a fundraising trip to Berlin, a mutiny broke out within the Nazi Party in Munich. Members of its executive committee wanted to merge with the rival German Socialist Party (DSP). Hitler returned to Munich on 11 July and angrily tendered his resignation. The committee members realised that the resignation of their leading public figure and speaker would mean the end of the party, so Eckart –who had lobbied the committee not to lose Hitler– was asked by the Party leadership to talk with Hitler and relay the conditions in which Hitler would agree to return to the Party. Hitler announced he would rejoin on the conditions that the party headquarters would remain in Munich, and that he would replace Anton Drexler as party chairman and become the party&#x27;s dictator, its &quot;Fuhrer&quot;. The committee agreed, and he rejoined the party on 26 July 1921.

Eckart would also advise Hitler about the people who had gathered around him and the Party, such as the virulently antisemitic Julius Streicher, the publisher of the quasi-pornographic &quot;Der Stürmer&quot;. Hitler was repelled by pornography and disapproved of Streicher&#x27;s sexual activities; he also was distressed by the many intra-party fights that Streicher managed to start. According to Hitler, Eckart told him on multiple occasions &quot;that Streicher was a schoolteacher, and a lunatic to boot, from many points of view. He always added that one could not hope for a triumph of National Socialism without giving one&#x27;s support to a man like Streicher.&quot;

For a time, before Alfred Rosenberg took over the role, Eckart –along with Gottfried Feder– was considered to be the Nazi Party&#x27;s &quot;philosopher.&quot;

===Growing apart===
The more confidence that Hitler felt in himself, to a large extent due to Eckart&#x27;s mentoring, the less that he needed Eckart as a mentor, which resulted in the relationship cooling off.

In November 1922, Eckart and the party&#x27;s chief fund-raiser outside of Germany, Emil Gansser, made a trip to Zurich, Switzerland to see Alfred Schwarzenbach, a rich entrepreneur in the silk industry. The trip was arranged by Hitler&#x27;s deputy, Rudolf Hess, who used family connections. While no detailed records of the meeting survive, a repeat visit –with Hitler along as well– was made the following year. This trip was not successful. Hitler made a speech to German expatriates, right-wing Swiss officers, and several dozen Swiss businessmen, but it, and the next day&#x27;s private meeting, was a fiasco. Hitler blamed Eckart&#x27;s lack of social graces for the failure of the trip.

After publishing a slanderous poem about Friedrich Ebert, the President of Germany at the time, Eckart ducked an arrest warrant by escaping in early 1923 to the Bavarian Alps near Berchtesgaden, close to the German-Austrian border, under the name &quot;Dr. Hoffman&quot;. In April, Hitler visited him there at the Pension Moritz in Obersalzberg, and stayed with him for a few days as &quot;Herr Wolf&quot;. It was Hitler&#x27;s introduction to the area where he would later build his mountain retreat, the &quot;Berghof&quot;.

Hitler had recently replaced Eckart as the publisher of &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; with Alfred Rosenberg, although he softened the blow by making it clear that he still regarded Eckart highly. &quot;His accomplishments are everlasting!&quot; Hitler said, he just was not constitutionally able to run a big business like a daily newspaper. &quot;I would not be able to do it, either,&quot; according to Hitler, &quot;I have been fortunate that I got a few people who know how to do it. ... It would be as if I tried to run a farm! I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do it.&quot; Nevertheless, tensions between Hitler and Eckart began to appear. Not only were there personal disagreements about the behavior of each towards a woman, but Hitler was annoyed that Eckart didn&#x27;t believe that a &quot;putsch&quot; launched in Munich could turn into a successful national revolution. &quot;Munich is not Berlin,&quot; Eckart said, &quot;It would lead to nothing but ultimate failure.&quot;

Despite his own role in promoting Hitler as a genius and messiah, in May 1923 he complained to Ernst &quot;Putzi&quot; Hanfstaengl, another of Hitler&#x27;s mentors, that Hitler had &quot;megalomania halfway between a Messiah complex and Neroism&quot; after Hitler had compared himself to Jesus throwing the money-changers out of the temple.

Motivated by his temporary annoyance at Eckart, and by Eckart&#x27;s impracticality in operational matters, Hitler began attempting to run the party without Eckart&#x27;s assistance, and when forced to use Eckart again as a political operative, the results were disappointing. Hitler began to see Eckart as a political liability due to his disorganization and his increased drinking. Hitler, however, did not discard or sideline him, as he had with other early comrades who had stood in his way. He stayed close to Eckart intellectually and emotionally, and continued to visit him in the mountains. The relationship between the two men was not simply a political one.

On 9 November 1923, Eckart participated in the failed Beer Hall Putsch. He was arrested and placed in Landsberg Prison along with Hitler and other party officials, but was released shortly thereafter due to illness. He then went to Berchtesgaden to recuperate.

===Hitler as genius and messiah===
Eckart promoted Hitler as Germany&#x27;s coming savior. Eckart&#x27;s hero, Otto Weininger, had formulated a dichotomy in which genius and Jews were opposed. Genius, in Weininger&#x27;s view, was the epitome of masculinity and non-materialism, while Jews were femininity in its purest form. Eckart took upon himself this philosophy, and considered that the role of genius was to rid the world of the baleful influence of Jews. Many parts of German society held similar views, and were looking for a savior, a &quot;German Messiah&quot;, a genius to lead them out of the economic and political morass the country had fallen into as a result of the Great Depression and the economic effects of the Treaty of Versailles that ended World War I.

Under Eckart&#x27;s tutelage Hitler first began to think of himself as that person, a superior being. Because it was generally believed that geniuses were born and not made, he could not present himself as having been mentored by Eckart and others. Thus in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, Hitler did not mention Eckart or Karl Mayr, or the others who had been instrumental in creating what the world was now meant to see as the natural genius, Adolf Hitler, the German Messiah.

Shortly after the Party purchase of the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; in December 1920, and Eckart&#x27;s installation as editor, with Rosenberg as his assistant, the two men had begun to use the newspaper as a vehicle to disseminate this &quot;Hitler Myth&quot;, the notion that Hitler was a superior being, a genius who would be the divine German Messiah – the chosen one. The paper did not refer to Hitler as merely the leader of the Nazi Party; instead, he was &quot;Germany&#x27;s leader&quot;. Other newspapers in Bavaria began to call Hitler &quot;the Bavarian Mussolini.&quot; This idea of Hitler&#x27;s specialness began to spread, so that two years later, in November 1922, the &quot;Traunsteiner Wochenblatt&quot; newspaper would look ahead to when &quot;the masses of the people will raise [Hitler] up as their leader, and give him their allegiance through thick and thin.&quot;

==Death==
Eckart died in Berchtesgaden on 26 December 1923 of a heart attack. He was buried in Berchtesgaden&#x27;s old cemetery, not far from the eventual graves of Nazi Party official Hans Lammers and his wife and daughter.

Although Hitler did not mention Eckart in the first volume of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, after Eckart&#x27;s death he dedicated the second volume to him, writing that Eckart was &quot;one of the best, who devoted his life to the awakening of our people, in his writings and his thoughts and finally in his deeds.&quot; In private, he would admit Eckart&#x27;s role as his mentor and teacher, and said of him in 1942: &quot;We have all moved forward since then, that&#x27;s why we don&#x27;t see what [Eckart] used to be back then: a polar star. The writings of all others were filled with platitudes, but if he told you off: such wit! I was a mere infant then in terms of style.&quot; Hitler later told one of his secretaries that his friendship with Eckart was &quot;one of the best things he experienced in the 1920s&quot; and that he never again had a friend with whom he felt such &quot;a harmony of thinking and feeling.&quot;

==Memorials==

During the Nazi period, several monuments and memorials were created to Eckart. Hitler named the arena near the Olympic Stadium in Berlin, now known as the Waldbühne (Forest Stage), the &quot;Dietrich-Eckart-Bühne&quot; when it was opened for the 1936 Summer Olympics. The 5th &quot;Standarte&quot; (regiment) of the &quot;SS-Totenkopfverbände&quot; was given the honour-title &quot;Dietrich Eckart&quot;. In 1937 the &quot;Realprogymnasium&quot; in Emmendingen was expanded and renamed the &quot;Dietrich-Eckart secondary school for boys&quot;. Several new roads were named after Eckart. All of these have since been renamed.

Eckart&#x27;s birthplace in Neumarkt in der Oberpfalz was officially renamed with the added suffix &quot;Dietrich-Eckart-Stadt&quot;. In 1934, Adolf Hitler inaugurated a monument in his honour in the city park. It has since been rededicated to Christopher of Bavaria (1416–1448), King of Denmark, who was probably born in the town.

In March 1938, when Passau commemorated Eckart&#x27;s 70th birthday at Oberhaus Castle, the Lord Mayor announced not only the creation of a Dietrich-Eckart-Foundation but also the restoration of the room where Eckart had been imprisoned. In addition, a street was dedicated to Eckart.

==Ideas and assessments==
Eckart has been called the spiritual father of Nazism, and indeed Hitler acknowledged him as being its spiritual co-founder.

Eckart viewed World War I not as a holy war between Germans and non-Germans, as it was sometime interpreted toward the end of the conflict, but as a holy war between Aryans and Jews, who, according to him, plotted the fall of the Russian and German empires. To describe this apocalyptic struggle, Eckart adopted extensive imagery from the legends of Ragnarok and from the Book of Revelation.

In 1925, Eckart&#x27;s unfinished essay &quot;Der Bolschewismus von Moses bis Lenin: Zwiegespräch zwischen Hitler und mir&quot; (&quot;Bolshevism from Moses to Lenin: Dialogue Between Hitler and Me&quot;) was published posthumously. Margarete Plewnia considered the dialogue between Eckart and Hitler to be an invention by Eckart himself, but Ernst Nolte, Friedrich Heer and Klaus Scholder think that the book – which was completed and published posthumously by Rosenberg, allegedly using Eckart&#x27;s notes – reflects Hitler&#x27;s own words. Thus historian Richard Steigmann-Gall believed that &quot;[the] book still remains a reliable indicator of [Eckart&#x27;s] own views.&quot;

Steigmann-Gall quotes from the book:

In Christ, the embodiment of all manliness, we find all that we need. And if we occasionally speak of Baldur (a god in Norse mythology), our words always contain some joy, some satisfaction, that our pagan ancestors were already so Christian as to have an indication of Christ in this ideal figure.

Steigmann-Gall concluded that, &quot;far from advocating a paganism or anti-Christian religion, Eckart held that, in Germany&#x27;s postwar tailspin, Christ was a leader to be emulated.&quot; But historian Ernst Piper dismissed Steigmann-Gall&#x27;s views about a relationship between the admiration of Christ by early members of the NSDAP and a positive relationship with Christianity; Eckart fervently opposed the political Catholicism of the Bavarian People&#x27;s Party and its national ally the Centre Party, supporting instead a vaguely defined &quot;positive Christianity&quot;. From the pages of &quot;Vőlkischer Beobachter&quot;, Eckart tried to win over Bavarian Catholics to the Nazi&#x27;s cause, but that attempt ended with the Beer Hall Putsch, which put Nazis at odds with Bavarian Catholics.

Joseph Howard Tyson writes that Eckart&#x27;s anti-Old Testament views show a strong resemblance to the early Christian heresy Marcionism.

In 1935 Alfred Rosenberg published the book &quot;Dietrich Eckart. Ein Vermächtnis&quot; (&quot;Dietrich Eckart. A Legacy&quot;) with collected writings by Eckart, including this passage:

To be a genius means to use the soul, to strive for the divine, to escape from the mean; and even if this cannot be totally achieved, there will be no space for the opposite of good. It does not prevent the genius to portray also the wretchedness of being in all shapes and colors, being the great artist that he is; but he does this as an observer, not taking part, sine ira et studio, his heart remains pure. ... The ideal in this, just like in every respect whatsoever is Christ; his words &quot;You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no one&quot; show the completely divine freedom from the influence of the senses, the overcoming of the earthly world even without art as an intermediary. At the other end you find Heine and his race ... all they do culminates in ... the motive, in subjugating the world, and the less this works, the more hate-filled their work becomes that is to satisfy their motive, the more deceitful and fallacious every try to reach the goal. No trace of true genius, the very opposite of the manliness of genius ...

===Personality===
Early Nazi adherent Ernst Hanfstaengl remembered Eckart as &quot;a perfect example of an old-fashioned Bavarian with the appearance of a walrus.&quot; Eckart was described by journalist Edgar Ansel Mowrer as &quot;a strange drunken genius&quot;. His antisemitism supposedly arose from various esoteric schools of mysticism, and he spent hours with Hitler discussing art and the place of the Jews in world history. Samuel W. Mitcham calls Eckart an &quot;eccentric intellectual&quot; and &quot;extreme antisemite&quot; who was also a &quot;man of the world&quot; who liked &quot;wine, women, and pleasures of the flesh.&quot; Alan Bullock describes Eckart as having &quot;violent nationalist, anti-democratic, and anti-clerical opinions, a racist with an enthusiasm for Nordic folklore and a taste for Jew-baiting&quot; who &quot;talked well even when he was drunk&quot; and &quot;knew everyone in Munich.&quot; According to Richard J. Evans, Eckart, the &quot;failed racist poet and dramatist&quot; blamed his career&#x27;s failure on Jewish domination of German culture, and defined as &quot;Jewish&quot; anything that was subversive or materialistic. Joachim C. Fest describes Eckart as a &quot;roughhewn and comical figure, with [a] thick round head, [and a] partiality for good wine and crude talk&quot; with a &quot;bluff and uncomplicated manner&quot;. His revolutionary goals were to promote &quot;true socialism&quot; and rid the country of &quot;interest slavery&quot;. According to Thomas Weber, Eckart had a &quot;jovial but moody nature&quot;, while John Toland describes him as &quot;an original raffish man with a touch of genius&quot;, and &quot;a tall, bald, burly eccentric who spent much of his time in cafes and beer halls giving equal attention to drink and talk.&quot; He was &quot;a born romantic revolutionary ... a master of coffeehouse polemics. A sentimental cynic, a sincere charlatan, constantly on stage, lecturing brilliantly if given the slightest opportunity be it at his own apartment, on the street or in a café.&quot;

<text>James Adelbert McDermott (born December 28, 1936) is an American politician and psychiatrist who was the U.S. representative for from 1989 to 2017. He is a member of the Democratic Party. The 7th district includes most of Seattle, Vashon Island, Tukwila, Burien, Shoreline, Lake Forest Park, Lynnwood, Mountlake Terrace, Woodway, and Edmonds.
He served on the House Ways and Means Committee and was a member of the House Progressive Caucus. He was formerly the committee chairman, then in 1995, ranking minority member on the House Ethics Committee. On January 4, 2016, he announced that he would not be seeking another congressional term.
==Early life, education, and early career==
McDermott was born on December 28, 1936, in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Roseanna (Wabel) and William McDermott. He was the first member of his family to attend college; he graduated from Wheaton College, Illinois, and then went to medical school, getting an M.D. from the University of Illinois College of Medicine in Chicago in 1963. After completing an internship in 1964 at Buffalo General Hospital in Buffalo, New York, a two-year psychiatry residency at the University of Illinois Research and Educational Hospital (now called University of Illinois Research Hospital), and fellowship training in child psychiatry (1966–68) at the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle, he served in the United States Navy Medical Corps as a psychiatrist in California during the Vietnam War.

==Early political career==

In 1970, McDermott made his first run for public office and was elected to the Washington state legislature as a representative from the 43rd District. He did not seek re-election in 1972 but instead ran for Governor of Washington losing the primary to former governor Albert Rosellini, who was seeking a return to the governorship after losing a third term bid in 1964. Rosellini would lose that fall. In 1974, he ran for the state senate, and subsequently was re-elected three times, to three successive two-year terms. During this time, he crafted and sponsored legislation that would eventually be called the Washington State Basic Health Plan, the first such state program in the country, which offers health insurance to the unemployed and the working poor.

In 1980, while still a state senator, he saw a chance to take on incumbent governor Dixy Lee Ray in the Democratic primary for governor as she sought re-election. U.S. Senator Warren Magnuson endorsed McDermott and persuaded the leaders of the Washington State AFL–CIO to endorse and actively campaign for McDermott. He was successful in the primary, upsetting an incumbent governor by a 57–42% landslide, but lost the general election to Republican John Spellman in the year of the Republican Ronald Reagan landslide. McDermott would lose 57–43% while Magnuson would lose in a narrow upset to Washington attorney general Slade Gorton.

McDermott chose for a third time in 1984 to run for governor. In his third gubernatorial campaign, he carried shiny red apples around the state as he campaigned in a state noted for its apple crops. He has pushed what he&#x27;s called an &quot;Apple agenda&quot;—his acronym for Affordable health care, Promotion of jobs, Protection of the environment, Life with hope and without fear, and excellence in Education. However, this time in the primary, he faced the Pierce County Executive Booth Gardner, a former state senator as well who ran in the slogan, &quot;Booth Who?!&quot; Gardner ran with a focus on LGBT and the pro-choice issues, and contributed $500,000 of his own funds to the campaign. McDermott ended up losing his third primary to Gardner, who then went on to defeat Spellman in the general election.

In 1987, McDermott briefly left politics to become a Foreign Service medical officer based in Zaire (now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo), providing psychiatric services to Foreign Service, USAID, and Peace Corps personnel in sub-Saharan Africa.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1988, the seat for came open when five-term incumbent Mike Lowry gave it up to make an unsuccessful run for the Senate. McDermott returned from Africa to run for the seat and won handily with 71 percent of the vote. He was re-elected 13 times with no substantive opposition. He usually garnered wide support in his district, the most Democratic white-majority district in the nation, even in disastrous years for Democrats nationally. In 1994, for instance, he won with 75% of the vote even as the Republicans won control of Congress and took all but two seats in Washington (his and that of Norm Dicks). He was re-elected in 2010, taking 83 percent of the vote against independent challenger Bob Jeffers-Schroder. No Republican filed to contest the election in 2010. In 2012 McDermott was challenged in the Democratic primary by attorney Andrew Hughes. Despite spending more than $200,000 on his campaign (versus McDermott&#x27;s primary spending of $387,000), Hughes won just 6 percent of the vote to McDermott&#x27;s 71 percent. In the general election, McDermott won just under 80% of the vote, against Republican Ron Bemis. McDermott did not seek reelection in 2016 following the announcement of a primary challenge by state representative Brady Walkinshaw.

===Tenure===
====AIDS Housing Opportunity Act of 1990====
In his first term, McDermott sponsored the AIDS Housing Opportunity Act, which provides state and local governments with the resources and incentives to devise long-term comprehensive strategies for meeting the housing needs of persons with AIDS and the families of such persons.

The program established, known as HOPWA, has grown to be a $335M line in United States budget, at a cost of $5,432 per recipient in 2010. Despite the long-term focus of the original legislation, according to HUD, 59% of recipients received help with short-term housing.

====Cedar River Watershed Land Exchange Act of 1992====
This consolidated land in Washington state which allowed the city of Seattle to gain greater control over its primary water source, thus enabling more efficient planning for the future. The bill was one of the last signed by President George H. W. Bush before he left office.

====2002 Iraq trip====
In the fall of 2002, McDermott and fellow Representatives David Bonior of Michigan, Nick Rahall of West Virginia and Mike Thompson of California visited Iraq; in Baghdad they met with members of parliament and the Iraqi Foreign Minister, and in Basra they met with residents who talked about the effect on them of the Iraq sanctions. American conservatives sharply criticised McDermott for this trip, and for his predictions that President George W. Bush would &quot;mislead the American public&quot; to justify military action and that no WMD would be found in Iraq.

After this trip, McDermott&#x27;s opponents dubbed him &quot;Baghdad Jim&quot;; his supporters claimed that he had been proven correct on the facts.

According to a disclosure form filed with the clerk of the House of Representatives, the nonprofit organization Life for Relief and Development paid McDermott&#x27;s $5,510 travel expenses for the Iraq trip. On March 26, 2008, a Bush Administration indictment accused Muthanna Al-Hanooti of arranging for the trip and paying for it with funds from Saddam Hussein&#x27;s intelligence agency, the IIS. Ultimately these charges were dropped; Al-Hanooti was convicted of attempting to sell Iraqi oil to raise money for humanitarian purposes without permission of the U.S. Treasury.

====African Growth and Opportunity Act of 2004====
This act lowered tariffs and spurred apparel trade with many African countries. The AGOA has brought approximately 15,000 jobs and $340 million in foreign investment to some of the poorest nations in sub-Saharan Africa. On August 22, 2007, McDermott was knighted by King Letsie III of Lesotho, in recognition of McDermott&#x27;s leadership on the Act.

====Violence Against Women and Justice Department Reauthorization Act of 2005====
This piece of legislation strengthened privacy and confidentiality of people already receiving care under the Act and modernized it by prohibiting cyberstalking as defined under the law.

====Pledge of Allegiance====
On April 28, 2004, Congressman McDermott omitted the phrase &quot;under God&quot; while leading the House in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. The incident occurred after atheist Michael Newdow lost his court case to have the phrase &quot;under God&quot; dropped from the Pledge, and after McDermott had voted against a congressional resolution that called for overturning a court ruling that declared the phrase unconstitutional. In 1954, during the McCarthy era and communism scare, Congress had passed a bill, which was signed into law, to add the words &quot;under God.&quot; McDermott later stated that he had &quot;reverted to the pledge as it was written and taught in the public schools throughout my childhood&quot;, as the phrase &quot;under God&quot; was added in 1954, the year in which McDermott graduated from high school; he turned 18 in late December of that year, after graduating.

====&quot;Boehner v. McDermott&quot;====
In December 2004, the House Ethics Committee investigated McDermott over the leaking of an illegally recorded telephone conversation during a 1997 committee investigation of then-Speaker Newt Gingrich.

In the conversation, Mr. Gingrich, his lawyer, and several other Republican Congressmen discussed how Gingrich&#x27;s Congressional allies should deal with the political consequences of his admission that he had violated House ethics rules by giving inaccurate information to the House Ethics Committee for its inquiry into his use of tax-exempt funds. Democrats have described the conversation as evidence that Mr. Gingrich broke an agreement with the Ethics Committee that he would not orchestrate a politically motivated response to those committee findings.

The recording was made by John and Alice Martin, who claimed that they had overheard the conversation on a police scanner, decided to record it for posterity&#x27;s sake, and then decided that it might be important for the Ethics Committee to hear. The Martins gave the tape to McDermott because he was the senior Democrat on the Ethics Committee. Within two days, reportedly after the Republican Ethics Committee chair Nancy L. Johnson refused to allow a vote on making the tape part of the committee&#x27;s records, sending the tape to the Justice Department, or taking any action against participants in the conversation, and over the warning of the committee&#x27;s counsel of possible legal liability, McDermott gave the tape to several media outlets, including the &quot;New York Times.&quot;
Rep. John Boehner, who was part of the Gingrich conversation, sued McDermott in his capacity as a private citizen, seeking punitive damages for violations of his First Amendment rights. After U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan ordered McDermott to pay Boehner for &quot;willful and knowing misconduct&quot; that &quot;rises to the level of malice&quot;, McDermott appealed, arguing that since he had not created the recording, his actions were allowed under the First Amendment, and that ruling against him would have &#x27;a huge chilling effect&#x27; on reporters and newsmakers alike. Eighteen news organizations – including ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, The Associated Press, the &quot;New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Washington Post&quot; — filed a brief backing McDermott. On March 29, 2006, the court ruled 2–1 that McDermott violated federal law when he turned over the illegally recorded tape to the media outlets, ordering McDermott to pay Boehner&#x27;s legal costs (over $600,000) plus $60,000 in damages. On June 26, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the judgment, deciding to re-hear the case with all nine judges. However, a split 4 to 1 to 4 en banc decision in &quot;Boehner v. McDermott&quot;, 484 F.3d 573 (D.C. Cir. 2007) affirmed the three-judge panel, but on different grounds; the Supreme Court declined review.
 On March 31, 2008, Chief Judge Thomas Hogan of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ordered McDermott to pay Boehner $1.05 million in attorney&#x27;s fees, costs and interest. McDermott also paid over $60,000 in fines and close to $600,000 in his own legal fees.

The Ethics Committee formally rebuked McDermott in 2006, writing he had &quot;violated ethics rules by giving reporters access to an illegally taped telephone call involving Republican leaders a decade ago. Rep. McDermott&#x27;s secretive disclosures to the news media ... risked undermining the ethics process&quot; and that McDermott&#x27;s actions &quot;were not consistent with the spirit of the committee.&quot; Previously, the Martins pleaded guilty to violating the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. In 1997, Gingrich was reprimanded by the House for providing false information to the Ethics Committee and he agreed to reimburse $300,000 in costs.

====Depleted Uranium Study Act of 2006====
This amendment to the Defense Authorization Act of 2006 directed the Department of Defense to study possible adverse health effects of the use of depleted uranium by the US military on servicemembers, employees and their families.

====Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008====
A reform in the American foster care system, this legislation addresses needs affecting foster children in the United States; it extends federal foster care payments until children are 21 years old, provides federal support for relatives caring for foster children, increases access to foster care and adoption services by Native American tribes, and improves oversight of the health and education needs of children in foster care.

====Unemployment Compensation Extension Acts of 2008–2009====
McDermott oversaw the emergency unemployment compensation extensions during the recession that began in 2008 under the George W. Bush administration and continued into the administration of Barack Obama.

====Ft. Lawton legislation====
H.R. 3174 required the US Army Board for Correction of Military Records to review dozens of convictions that followed the Fort Lawton Riot of 1944. The Board uncovered &quot;egregious error&quot; in the prosecution, overturned the convictions, issued retroactive honorable discharges to the defendants and ordered back pay. H.R. 5130 provided that such payments, which were otherwise of amounts considered nominal, to include interest.

====Worker, Home-ownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009====
The purpose of this act was to encourage job creation, strengthen the economic recovery, and assist those unable to find jobs during the serious economic downturn that began in 2008. While the bill had unrelated provisions, the primary focus was on the extension of the $8,000 first-time home buyer tax credit; opinion is divided as to the effectiveness of the program.

====Conflict Minerals Trade Act of 2010====
This legislation requires publicly traded companies in the United States exercise due diligence to ensure that conflict minerals (gold, tin, tantalum and tungsten) in their products do not come from mines funding civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Originally proposed as a standalone bill, it became section 1502 of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. A United Nations Security Council committee reported that this legislation was a &quot;catalyst&quot; for efforts to save lives by cutting off a key source of funding for armed groups at a cost to American firms of approximately $8 billion per year.

====Tax Parity for Health Plan Beneficiaries Act 2010, 2011====
McDermott sponsored a bill which would have eliminated the tax burden incurred by married same sex couples, same-sex and opposite-sex domestic partners. The bill also would have ensured that domestic partners of federal civilian employees receive the same health care benefits as married spouses, including retirement, compensation for work injuries, and full life and health insurance benefits. It was eventually folded into and taken out of the House Health Care Bill in 2010, and has been referred to committee both times, where it died. Versions of this bill were co-sponsored under McDermott&#x27;s leadership since the 106th Congress with Republican Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon. The 2010 (111th Congress) and 2011 (112th Congress) bills were co-sponsored by Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer of New York.

====The Internet Gambling Regulation and Tax Enforcement Act====
In June 2011, McDermott introduced The Internet Gambling Regulation and Tax Enforcement Act (H.R. 2230) along with John Campbell (R-Calif.) and Barney Frank (D-Mass). This represented McDermott&#x27;s fifth introduction of such an act, which would offer a tax structure should online gambling become fully legalized and regulated within the United States.

<text>Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal (; 17 September 1916 – 20 April 1991) was a Mongolian politician who led the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic from 1952 to 1984. He served as General Secretary of the ruling Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party from 1940 to 1954 and again from 1958 to 1984, as Chairman of the Council of Ministers (head of government) from 1952 to 1974, and as Chairman of the Presidium of the People&#x27;s Great Khural (head of state) from 1974 to 1984.

Tsedenbal rose to prominence in the 1940s as a member of leader Khorloogiin Choibalsan&#x27;s inner circle, and succeeded him as premier after his death in 1952. Tsedenbal resisted de-Stalinization, and ousted and internally exiled several of his rivals in the 1960s. His policies were aimed at making Mongolia a loyal political and economic partner of the Soviet Union. Tsedenbal was the longest-serving leader of modern Mongolia and any Eastern Bloc country, serving until his expulsion with Soviet support in 1984. He retired to Moscow and died in 1991, and his legacy has been considered a controversial one since the 1990 democratic revolution.

==Early life and education==
Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal (originally Tserenpil) was born on 17 September 1916 to an unwed Dörbet mother in Bayan Chandamani Uula banner (modern Davst District, Uvs Province). In October 1929, he and 21 other Mongolian students were selected to study at a special &quot;rabfak&quot; (preparatory school) in Irkutsk in the Soviet Union. In 1931, he joined the Mongolian Revolutionary Youth League. After graduating from the &quot;rabfak&quot;, Tsedenbal attended the Institute of Finance and Economics in Irkutsk, from which he graduated in July 1938. The Mongolian students were invited for sightseeing in Moscow, where Tsedenbal was noticed by the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party. In September 1938, he returned to Mongolia and began working as an instructor at the Ulaanbaatar Financial College, a technical school attached to the Finance Ministry.

== Party career and rise ==
After he was recommended to Mongolia&#x27;s leader, Khorloogiin Choibalsan, by Soviet intelligence officer and diplomatic representative Ivan Alekseevich Ivanov, in 1939 Tsendenbal joined the Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party (MPRP), and became deputy finance minister that March. From July 1939 to March 1940, Tsedenbal was concurrently Mongolia&#x27;s minister of finance and chairman of the board of the state bank (Bank of Trade and Industry). In December 1939, Tsedenbal joined Choibalsan and Ivanov for a meeting with Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in Moscow. There, Choibalsan promised to purge sitting MPRP secretary Banzarjavyn Baasanjav to replace him with Tsedenbal, which was done with Baasanjav&#x27;s execution in February 1940. Eventually though, Baasanjav was rehabilitated in 1957 and acknowledged as unjustly slandered and punished and as one of several high ranking government officials who were the victims of an &quot;out of control Interior Ministry&quot;.

In March 1940, at age 24, Tsedenbal was elected a member of the Central Committee, member of the Presidium, and general secretary at the MPRP&#x27;s Tenth Congress, becoming the country&#x27;s number-two leader. Though he was part of Choibalsan&#x27;s inner circle, unlike him Tsedenbal was not enthusiastic about pan-Mongolian unification, and around 1950 instead supported the proposal advanced by several young party officials that Mongolia join the Soviet Union in order to achieve socialism. Tsedenbal was responsible for the introduction of the Cyrillic script for writing the Mongolian language, replacing Mongolian script. During World War II in the Soviet Union from 1941 to 1945, Tsedenbal served as head of the Political Directorate and deputy commander-in-chief of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Army, with the rank of lieutenant general, and was awarded the Soviet Order of Lenin. Mongolia did not declare war on Nazi Germany after its invasion of the USSR, but supported the Soviet war effort by financing a tank regiment and a fighter squadron, and by donating horses, winter clothing, and money. Some Mongolian workers and students under training in the Soviet Union joined the Soviet Red Army. Tsedenbal was appointed chairman of the State Planning Commission in 1945 and deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers in 1948.

== Leader of Mongolia ==

=== Consolidation of power ===
Following Choibalsan&#x27;s death in January 1952, Tsedenbal allied with second secretary Dashiin Damba to defeat a bid for power by hardliner Chimeddorjiyn Sürenjav, who was exiled to Moscow. Tsedenbal was appointed chairman of the Council of Ministers (premier) on 27 May 1952. As premier, he immediately visited Moscow and Beijing (where the People&#x27;s Republic of China had been established in 1949), and signed agreements which created the Trans-Mongolian Railway and an alliance between the countries. The Mongolian Politburo formally approved joining the Soviet Union. While attending Stalin&#x27;s funeral in March 1953, Tsedenbal presented the request to the Soviet leadership, which rejected and rebuked it.In 1954, Tsedenbal lost the position of general secretary to Damba (who gained the title of first secretary). The two men split over the Mongolian response to Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s speech criticizing Stalin in April 1956. The Mongolian Politburo initially created a special commission, headed by Bazaryn Shirendev, to re-examine the purges of the Choibalsan period. While Damba supported the commission, Tsedenbal repeatedly blocked its work. In 1958, Tsedenbal ousted and internally exiled Damba, taking over his position (Tsedenbal regained the title of general secretary in 1981). In 1961–1962, as Khrushchev intensified the Soviet de-Stalinization drive, a &quot;Rehabilitation Commission&quot; was appointed, whose work Tsedenbal also criticized. For example, in 1963, the Mongolian Politburo banned the film &quot;Tümnii Neg&quot; (&quot;A Million in One&quot;), which dealt with the purges. Due to Tsedenbal&#x27;s stubborn resistance to de-Stalinization, a statue of Stalin stood in front of the Mongolian National Library until 1990.In 1962–1963, Tsedenbal began expelling several rivals and critics from the MPRP on charges of &quot;nationalism&quot;. In 1962, Mongolia&#x27;s Politburo was organizing celebrations for the 800th anniversary of the birth of Genghis Khan when the Soviet Communist Party newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot; criticized the &quot;Mongol–Tatar yoke&quot; imposed on the Russian people by the &quot;reactionary&quot; Genghis. The politburo canceled the celebrations, and on 10 September the member in charge of organizing the celebrations, Daramyn Tömör-Ochir, was scapegoated by Tsedenbal, ousted, and internally exiled for trying &quot;to create an unhealthy mood in public opinion and to inflame nationalist passions&quot;; he was followed by Luvsantserengiin Tsend. At a central committee meeting in December 1964, three members handling economic issues, Tsogt-Ochiryn Lookhuuz, Baldandorjiin Nyambuu, and Bandiin Surmaajav, argued that living standards were declining, and criticized the party&#x27;s &quot;petit-bourgeois&quot; attitude. They were named an &quot;anti-party group&quot; by Tsedenbal, expelled from the party, and internally exiled. In 1966, Tsedenbal, the undisputed leader, received Leonid Brezhnev on the first visit of a Soviet leader to Mongolia and presided unchallenged over the Fifteenth Congress.

=== Domestic policy ===
Tsedenbal was close to the Soviet leadership and a strong proponent of Soviet political and economic policies, and described the relationship between the countries as an &quot;elder brother–younger brother&quot; (&quot;akh düü&quot;) one. In 1962, Tsedenbal proposed the slogan that mastering Russian, &quot;the language of Lenin&quot;, was &quot;a component of ideological education&quot; (in the late 1970s, an attempt to conduct all higher education in Russian was narrowly defeated). From 1963, Tsedenbal condemned many areas of emerging intellectual endeavor, including abstract art, new appreciation of Buddhist literature, and survey-based sociology, among others. In a note written in 1963, he rejected Chinese suggestions that Mongolia, by being relegated to mining and light industry, was becoming a colony of the Soviet Union. From 1966, Tsedenbal&#x27;s policies were shaped by a determination to make Mongolia an &quot;industrial-agricultural country&quot;. While the USSR prodded the Mongolian government to concentrate its efforts on the development of agriculture and the mineral sector, Tsedenbal and his followers sought to foster rapid industrialization (mostly semi-processing of raw materials for the Soviet market) even in the face of Soviet opposition. Despite stating that &quot;new young forces must be drawn into leadership work&quot;, he cemented an aging leadership, and the Politburo changed little between 1966 and 1981. Despite his modest protestations to the contrary, Tsedenbal developed a cult of personality during his tenure. He was awarded the highest distinction of Hero of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic and presented with the Order of Sükhbaatar on his 50th birthday in 1966 for his &quot;special services to the party, state, and Mongolian people&quot;, and was made an honorary member of the Academy of Sciences. On his 60th birthday in 1976, he received another Order of Sükhbaatar at a &quot;grand ceremony&quot;, an exhibition about him was opened in Ulaanbaatar, and a bronze bust was unveiled in Ulaangom, the center of his home province of Uvs. Brezhnev awarded him another Order of Lenin. Tsedenbal promoted himself to army general, the highest rank in the Mongolian People&#x27;s Army, and in 1979 created for himself the rank of marshal of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic. On his 65th birthday in 1981, Marshal Tsedenbal was given another Order of Sükhbaatar (he was awarded six altogether).

=== Foreign policy ===
In the early years of his rule, Tsedenbal favored balanced relations between Mongolia and China. In 1959, Tsedenbal was in Beijing for the 10th anniversary of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. At the time of the Sino-Soviet split, Tsedenbal decisively sided with the Soviet Union and incurred China&#x27;s wrath. Despite this, the two countries managed to sign a border treaty in 1962. In the early 1960s, he signed an order expelling all Chinese citizens from Mongolia. The resolution was met with outrage: &quot;Break off Tsedenbal&#x27;s dog&#x27;s head,&quot; was written onto the Mongolian embassy, and Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai stated that &quot;Comrade Tsedenbal is trampling on diplomacy.&quot; With the intensification of the Sino-Soviet border conflict in the 1960s, the signing of a treaty with the USSR in Ulaanbaatar in early 1966 by Brezhnev and Tsedenbal, allowed the Soviet Union to station troops in Mongolia to ensure mutual defense, being the first time that foreign troops would be stationed in the republic.

In July 1956, he welcomed North Korean leader Kim Il Sung on a state visit. As it relates to the Korean conflict, Tsedenbal, during a 1971 visit of the North Korean deputy premier in honor of the 50th anniversary of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolution, declared that his nation &quot;strongly support the struggle of the Korean people to unify the motherland by peaceful, democratic means and for the liberation of South Korea.&quot; Tsedenbal visited Bucharest on 9 September 1957, becoming the first Mongolian leader to visit Romania. His relationship with President Nicolae Ceaușescu proved to be frosty, being critical of the latter for his more independent foreign policy. Mongolia under Tsedenbal increased its participation in international organizations, attempting first in 1955 to have the MPR join the United Nations (with the request being vetoed by the Republic of China on the island of Taiwan) and being admitted into the UN in 1961. During the Vietnam War, he supported the Soviet position, in part due to the stance of the Chinese in this regard. During a February 1973 visit to New Delhi, an Indo-Mongolian joint declaration was signed by Tsedenbal and Indira Gandhi. Furthermore, he supported India in the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, at the expense of relations with Pakistan. Under Tsedenbal, Mongolia established ties with West Germany on 31 January 1974.

=== Decline and ousting ===
Around late 1973, Tsedenbal began to experience moments of memory loss and spells of dizziness, which grew increasingly serious from 1975 on. In 1974, Tsendenbal resigned as premier, handing the office to his underling Jambyn Batmönkh, and became chairman of the presidium of the People&#x27;s Great Khural (head of state). In 1981, at the Eighteenth Party Congress, Tsedenbal was praised as &quot;the best leader of party and state&quot;, and again began purging intellectuals and former allies to &quot;root out weeds&quot; in the leadership. In 1982, he dismissed Shirendev, then the president of the Academy of Sciences; in December 1983, he linked Sampilyn Jalan-Aajav, the deputy head of state, to the 1963 &quot;anti-party&quot; group and internally exiled him. By 1984, one-third of the Central Committee and almost half the ministry heads appointed in 1981 had been dismissed by Tsedenbal.

After Brezhnev&#x27;s death in 1982, the new Soviet leadership decided in November 1983 that Tsedenbal&#x27;s erratic behaviour was becoming a liability. On 9 August 1984, while Tsedenbal was vacationing in Moscow, the Kremlin&#x27;s doctor diagnosed him as suffering from &quot;overwork&quot;, and top Soviet leaders summoned Batmönkh and Tsedenbal&#x27;s old ally , telling them Tsedenbal could no longer serve. On 23 August, the Mongolian Politburo dismissed Tsedenbal from all positions &quot;on account of his state of health, and with his agreement&quot;.

== Later life and death ==
After his dismissal, Tsedenbal lived in retirement with his family at their flat in Moscow. In 1986, Batmönkh&#x27;s position was reinforced by another MPRP Congress and Great Khural election. In 1988, Batmönkh and official media began to blame him by name for the political and economic &quot;stagnation&quot; into which the country had declined. In December 1988, Batmönkh called for greater openness in political and social affairs and the press blamed Tsedenbal and his &quot;administrative command&quot; methods for the country&#x27;s stagnation, following the line of Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s policies of &quot;glasnost&quot; and &quot;perestroika&quot; in the Soviet Union. An MPRP Central Committee resolution described Tsedenbal as &quot;willful and unprincipled&quot; and said he &quot;belittled collective leadership&quot;. In June 1989, the MPRP revised the Party Rules, Party Program, and procedures for rehabilitation of victims of the personality cult.

Following the resignation of the MPRP Politburo and Secretariat in March 1990 at the height of the democratic revolution, the MPRP Central Committee criticized Tsedenbal&#x27;s legacy, stripped him of his titles, and expelled him from the party &quot;for not fulfilling his lofty responsibilities&quot;. It also rehabilitated his old enemies, including Tömör-Ochir, Lookhuuz, Nyambuu, and Surmaajav. Mongolia&#x27;s new government planned to try Tsedenbal and other members of the MPRP Politburo on various charges, but by February 1991 he was considered too ill to face trial. Tsedenbal died on 20 April 1991 at a Moscow hospital from &quot;bile duct cancer, purulent poisoning and chronic liver failure.&quot; After he died, his body was brought to Mongolia. His funeral was held at the Officers&#x27; Palace on 29 April, and he was buried (after some debate) with military honors at Altan-Ölgii National Cemetery in Ulaanbaatar.

==Legacy==
In Mongolia, Tsedenbal is remembered for successfully maintaining a path of relatively moderate socialism during the Cold War. By the decree of President Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat in 1997, the 1990 decree that stripped him of his rank and awards was invalidated. A statue of Tsedenbal was built in 2000 on the plaza in front of the National Drama Academic Theater which has since been renamed to Tsedenbal Square (&quot;Цэдэнбалын талбай&quot;). The statue and its surroundings were refurbished in 2013. On 21 September 2016, the Erdenet Mining Corporation was named after him.

In 2019, Mongolian filmmakers produced a biographical film of Tsedenbal. His son Zorig founded the Tsedenbal Academy in Mongolia.

== Personal life ==
His Russian wife, Anastasia Filatova, was often said to be the most powerful political figure in Mongolia due to her close relationship with the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. They had two children, Vladislav (7 October 1949 – c. 2000) and Zorig (born 11 March 1957). A third son, born 11 March 1948, died three days later. The sons&#x27; surnames were reduplicated from their patronymic in Russian (e.g. Владислав Цэдэнбалович Цэдэнбал). His granddaughter Anastasia Tsedenbal (Анастасия Зоригновна Цэдэнбал), born in 1985, graduated from the Lomonosov Moscow State University as an African researcher.

<text>Liberality and Prodigality (&quot;A Pleasant Comedie, shewing the contention betweene Liberalitie and Prodigalitie&quot;, also known as &quot;Contention between Liberality and Prodigality&quot;) is a morality play by an unknown author from c.1567. Its title page also reads: &quot;As it was played before her Maiestie. London Printed by Simon Stafford for George Vincent, and are to be sold at the signs of the Hand in hand in Wood-street over against S. Michaels Church.&quot;

The play is a farcical allegorization of the relationship between the ethical concepts of Liberality and Prodigality, the qualities of which are derived from Aristotle&#x27;s Nicomachean Ethics. It is notable for being one of the earliest attempts to present an Aristotelian dramatization of these qualities in early modern drama.

The copy of this play in the Garrick Collection appears to be the only one known. There is some internal evidence, from the allusion to the 43rd year of Queen Elizabeth, that the production was performed before her Majesty in 1600; and it seems likely that it was a revival of a more ancient piece. Edward Phillips, author of the &quot;Theatrum Poetarum&quot;, assigned it to Robert Greene, but this attribution is dubious.

<text>Grim the Collier of Croyden; or, The Devil and his Dame: with the Devil and Saint Dunston is a seventeenth-century play of uncertain authorship, first published in 1662. The play&#x27;s title character is an established figure of the popular culture and folklore of the time who appeared in songs and stories – a body of lore the play draws upon. The London coal and charcoal industry was centred on Croydon, to the south of London in Surrey; the original Grimme or Grimes has been claimed to be a real individual, but evidence for this is not forthcoming. 

==History==
On 6 May 1600 the Diary of Philip Henslowe records a payment to playwright William Haughton for a play called &quot;The Devil and His Dame&quot;. H. Dugdale Sykes made a case for Haughton&#x27;s authorship of &quot;Grim&quot; based on common features with Haughton&#x27;s play &quot;Englishmen for My Money,&quot; a case that is accepted by some commentators.

&quot;Grim&quot; first appeared in print in 1662 in a duodecimo drama collection titled &quot;Gratiae Theatrales; or, A Choice Ternary of English Plays,&quot; a volume that also contains the plays &quot;The Marriage Broker&quot; and &quot;Thorny Abby; or, The London Maid.&quot; The collection assigns &quot;Grim&quot; to &quot;I. T.&quot; (which in modern usage could be &quot;J. T.&quot;); John Tatham has been proposed as one possible candidate for &quot;I. T.&quot; Reports of earlier editions of &quot;Grim,&quot; in 1599, 1600, and 1606, have proved unverifiable.

The inclusion of a collier and a devil in &quot;Grim&quot; seems to link it to an earlier play with the same elements. &quot;Like Will to Like,&quot; an old play (c. 1568) by Ulpian Fulwell, appears to have been acted by Pembroke&#x27;s Men at Henslowe&#x27;s Rose Theatre on 28 October 1600; the old play may have influenced &quot;Grim,&quot; or its revival may have been a response to it. (Fulwell&#x27;s play employs the traditional tune &quot;Tom Collier of Croydon hath sold his coals.&quot;) Grim the Collier also appears in the old (c. 1565) play &quot;Damon and Pythias,&quot; by Richard Edwardes; both plays employ the same joke, absurdly identifying the character as &quot;collier to the King&#x27;s own majesty&#x27;s mouth.&quot; One of the sources for &quot;Grim&quot; is Machiavelli&#x27;s novel &quot;Belfagor arcidiavolo;&quot; the play&#x27;s treatment of Saint Dunstan draws upon the &quot;Golden Legend&quot; of Jacobus de Voragine.

&quot;Grim&quot; is one in a long series of devil plays that unite Elizabethan drama with the Medieval drama from which it grew. Later examples include Dekker&#x27;s &quot;If This Be Not a Good Play the Devil is in It&quot; (1611–12) and Jonson&#x27;s &quot;The Devil is an Ass&quot; (1616).

== Synopsis ==
The devil Belphagor comes to live on Earth for a time, to investigate reports that women have grown extreme in their misbehaviors and have made marriage a curse. He disguises himself as a Spanish doctor named Castiliano. He offers to cure a mute woman named Honoria if she will marry him in return – a proposal that is accepted by the young woman and her family. Once he cures her, however, she repudiates her marital promise, calling him a &quot;base Spaniard&quot; who she wouldn&#x27;t allow her slave to marry. 

All the English seem to turn on him: he is bed-tricked into marrying Honoria&#x27;s shrewish maid, who cheats on him; one of the maid&#x27;s former suitors tries to kill him; and his wife eventually poisons him. Castiliano dies just as Belphagor&#x27;s predetermined time on Earth expires, and the devil returns to Hell with great relief at escaping the toils of earthly existence and its ferocious females. 

The play&#x27;s depiction of its devil is surprisingly restrained; he is described as &quot;patient, mild, and pitiful,&quot; and is rather a sympathetic character than otherwise. Its infernal domain, ruled by Pluto, is a mixture of Christian and classical elements.

In the play&#x27;s subplot, Grim the collier is a simple and good-hearted soul who is devoted to his love, Joan of Badenstock. After complications with Clack the Miller and Parson Shorthose, Grim wins her in the end, with the help of Puck or Robin Goodfellow (alias Akercock; in this play, a devil like Belphagor).

== Grim-the-collier as a common name for &quot;Pilosella aurantiaca&quot;==
Grim-the-collier is also the common name for &quot;Pilosella aurantiaca&quot; (sometimes under the genus &quot;Hieracium&quot;). Other common names are Orange Hawkweed, Fox and Cubs, Devil&#x27;s paintbrush and Red devil.

<text>In computing, especially digital signal processing, the multiply–accumulate (MAC) or multiply-add (MAD) operation is a common step that computes the product of two numbers and adds that product to an accumulator. The hardware unit that performs the operation is known as a multiplier–accumulator (MAC unit); the operation itself is also often called a MAC or a MAD operation. The MAC operation modifies an accumulator &quot;a&quot;:
formula_1

When done with floating-point numbers, it might be performed with two roundings (typical in many DSPs), or with a single rounding. When performed with a single rounding, it is called a fused multiply–add (FMA) or fused multiply–accumulate (FMAC).

Modern computers may contain a dedicated MAC, consisting of a multiplier implemented in combinational logic followed by an adder and an accumulator register that stores the result. The output of the register is fed back to one input of the adder, so that on each clock cycle, the output of the multiplier is added to the register. Combinational multipliers require a large amount of logic, but can compute a product much more quickly than the method of shifting and adding typical of earlier computers. Percy Ludgate was the first to conceive a MAC in his Analytical Machine of 1909, and the first to exploit a MAC for division (using multiplication seeded by reciprocal, via the convergent series ). The first modern processors to be equipped with MAC units were digital signal processors, but the technique is now also common in general-purpose processors.

==In floating-point arithmetic==
When done with integers, the operation is typically exact (computed modulo some power of two). However, floating-point numbers have only a certain amount of mathematical precision. That is, digital floating-point arithmetic is generally not associative or distributive. (See .)
Therefore, it makes a difference to the result whether the multiply–add is performed with two roundings, or in one operation with a single rounding (a fused multiply–add). IEEE 754-2008 specifies that it must be performed with one rounding, yielding a more accurate result.

==Fused multiply–add==
A fused multiply–add (FMA or fmadd)
is a floating-point multiply–add operation performed in one step (fused operation), with a single rounding. That is, where an unfused multiply–add would compute the product , round it to &quot;N&quot; significant bits, add the result to &quot;a&quot;, and round back to &quot;N&quot; significant bits, a fused multiply–add would compute the entire expression to its full precision before rounding the final result down to &quot;N&quot; significant bits.

A fast FMA can speed up and improve the accuracy of many computations that involve the accumulation of products:

* Dot product
* Matrix multiplication
* Polynomial evaluation (e.g., with Horner&#x27;s rule)
* Newton&#x27;s method for evaluating functions (from the inverse function)
* Convolutions and artificial neural networks 
* Multiplication in double-double arithmetic

Fused multiply–add can usually be relied on to give more accurate results. However, William Kahan has pointed out that it can give problems if used unthinkingly. If is evaluated as (following Kahan&#x27;s suggested notation in which redundant parentheses direct the compiler to round the term first) using fused multiply–add, then the result may be negative even when due to the first multiplication discarding low significance bits. This could then lead to an error if, for instance, the square root of the result is then evaluated.

When implemented inside a microprocessor, an FMA can be faster than a multiply operation followed by an add. However, standard industrial implementations based on the original IBM RS/6000 design require a 2&quot;N&quot;-bit adder to compute the sum properly.

Another benefit of including this instruction is that it allows an efficient software implementation of division (see division algorithm) and square root (see methods of computing square roots) operations, thus eliminating the need for dedicated hardware for those operations.

===Dot product instruction===
Some machines combine multiple fused multiply add operations into a single step, e.g. performing a four-element dot-product on two 128-bit SIMD registers codice_1 with single cycle throughput.

===Support===
The FMA operation is included in IEEE 754-2008.

The Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) VAX&#x27;s codice_2 instruction is used for evaluating polynomials with Horner&#x27;s rule using a succession of multiply and add steps. Instruction descriptions do not specify whether the multiply and add are performed using a single FMA step. This instruction has been a part of the VAX instruction set since its original 11/780 implementation in 1977.

The 1999 standard of the C programming language supports the FMA operation through the codice_3 standard math library function and the automatic transformation of a multiplication followed by an addition (contraction of floating-point expressions), which can be explicitly enabled or disabled with standard pragmas (). The GCC and Clang C compilers do such transformations by default for processor architectures that support FMA instructions. With GCC, which does not support the aforementioned pragma, this can be globally controlled by the codice_4 command line option.

The fused multiply–add operation was introduced as &quot;multiply–add fused&quot; in the IBM POWER1 (1990) processor, but has been added to numerous other processors since then:

<text>Hatton Garden is a street and commercial zone in the Holborn district of the London Borough of Camden, abutting the narrow precinct of Saffron Hill which then abuts the City of London. It takes its name from Sir Christopher Hatton, a favourite of Queen Elizabeth I, who established a mansion here and gained possession of the garden and orchard of Ely Place, the London seat of the Bishops of Ely. It remained in the Hatton family and was built up as a stylish residential development in the reign of King Charles II. For some decades it often went, outside of the main street, by an alternative name St Alban&#x27;s Holborn, after the local church built in 1861.

St Etheldreda&#x27;s Church in Ely Place, all that survives of the old Bishop&#x27;s Palace, is one of only two remaining buildings in London dating from the reign of Edward I. It is one of the oldest churches in England now in use for Roman Catholic worship, which was re-established there in 1879. The red-brick building now known as Wren House, at the south-east corner of Hatton Garden and St Cross Street, was the Anglican church for the Hatton Garden development. It was taken over by the authorities of a charity school, and the statues of a boy and girl in uniform were then added.

Hatton Garden is London&#x27;s jewellery quarter and the centre of the diamond trade in the United Kingdom. This specialisation grew up in the early 19th century, spreading out from its more ancient centre in nearby Clerkenwell. Today there are nearly 300 businesses here in the jewellery industry and over 90 shops, representing the largest cluster of jewellery retailers in the UK. The largest of these businesses was De Beers, the international family of companies which dominated the international diamond trade. Their headquarters were in an office and warehouse complex just behind the main Hatton Garden shopping street.

Sir Hiram Maxim had a small factory at 57 Hatton Garden and in 1881, invented and started to produce the Maxim Gun, a prototype machine gun, capable of firing 666 rounds a minute. Hatton Garden has an extensive underground infrastructure of vaults, tunnels, offices and workshops. The area is now home to many media, publishing and creative businesses, including Blinkbox and Grey Advertising. Surrounding streets including Hatton Place and Saffron Hill (the insalubrious setting for Fagin&#x27;s den in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;) were improved during the 20th century and in modern times have been developed with blocks of &#x27;luxury&#x27; apartments, including Da Vinci House (occupying the former &quot;Punch&quot; magazine printworks) and the architecturally distinctive Ziggurat Building.

==Hatton Garden development, 1659–1694==

The Hatton Garden area between Leather Lane in the west and Saffron Hill in the east, and from Holborn in the south to Hatton Wall in the north, was developed as a new residential district in the Restoration period, between 1659 and 1694. It arose soon after the residential developments in Covent Garden and was contemporary with those of Bloomsbury Square.

It was formerly the site of the medieval palace, gardens and orchard of the Bishops of Ely, forming their City residence. The palace stood in the southeast corner, on the site of Ely Place. During the 1570s Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Chancellor and favourite, Sir Christopher Hatton, held a lease of part of the site and developed Hatton House to the northwest of the palace. In 1581, he obtained a more permanent grant from Queen Elizabeth during a vacancy in the see, and after his death, it passed into the possession of Lady Elizabeth Hatton, the widow of Sir Christopher&#x27;s nephew Sir William Newport (who changed his name to Hatton). At her death in 1646, during the English Civil War, it reverted to Christopher Hatton, 1st Baron Hatton, a close associate of Charles II in his exile in Paris during the Commonwealth period, 1649–1660.

The bishops disputed the Hattons&#x27; title, but, under the Protectorate, Bishop Matthew Wren was a prisoner in the Tower of London, and the palace itself was sequestrated to Parliamentarian uses and was badly damaged. To raise money Lord Hatton granted a long lease of the site in 1654, which became effectively permanent in 1658, though he retained the freehold. In 1659, John Evelyn observed Hatton Street (Hatton Garden road) being laid out from south to north, hard against the west side of the palace, as the beginning of a newly planned town district. Speculative builders took leases to construct tall and spacious adjoining houses to attract wealthy men at court, city officials and country gentlefolk wanting London homes, convenient for Clerkenwell and the Inns of Court.
In this way a varied but harmonious townscape, with attractive detail of porches and interior panelling, grew up on a rectangular grid of new streets. Charles Street (at first called Cross Street) was laid west to east as a continuation of Greville Street, and the Bishops&#x27; orchard, which (as shown in Richard Newcourt&#x27;s map of 1658) the Hattons had laid out as a walled knot garden with a central fountain, lay north of that up to Hatton Wall. Hatton Street followed the line of its central path. By 1666, the year of the Great Fire, the development had advanced north to form two principal blocks up to the line of St Cross Street (then called Little Kirby Street). The remaining open land was used as a refuge by Londoners escaping the Fire, which did not consume Hatton Garden.

After Lord Hatton&#x27;s death in 1670, the northern sector up to Hatton Wall was completed by 1694, in the time of his son Sir Christopher Hatton, 1st Viscount Hatton, whose agent was the noted accountant Stephen Monteage (1623–1687). Work on the Hatton Street church (now Wren House) commenced in 1685–86. Great Kirby Street, parallel to Hatton Street on the east side, enclosed a central block with rear gardens backing, but in the northern sectors, Hatt and Tunn Yard on the east (on the site of Hatton Place) and other small yards on the west provided access to smaller dwellings and coach houses. In the southern sectors King&#x27;s Head Yard (later Robin Wood Yard, Robin Hood Yard) was similarly enclosed to the west, and to the east Bleeding Heart Yard (Arlidge&#x27;s Yard, with Union Court) was developed near the palace by Abraham Arlidge (1645–1717), a carpenter of Kenilworth (Warwickshire) origins who worked extensively on the project and made his fortune by judicious investments. Arlidge&#x27;s survey of 1694 shows the completed estate in detail: he succeeded Sir John Cass as Master of the Worshipful Company of Carpenters in 1712.

Among early residents were Christopher Merret, Robert Ferguson, John Flamsteed, William Whiston and Captain Thomas Coram.

Later the Hatton Garden estate was inherited by George Finch-Hatton esq (great grandson of the 1st Viscount Hatton). He sold it in 1780s and had received around £100,000 and was to receive even more money as it sold further.

== Crime ==
A &quot;Great Robbery in Hatton Garden&quot; occurred in late December 1678, when twenty men turned up at the house of a wealthy gentleman claiming to have a warrant to search the house for dangerous persons. After letting them in the owner asked to see the search warrant, whereupon he was forced at gunpoint into an inner room and locked in while the intruders rifled the house of its valuables. However, someone managed to escape and raised the alarm, and the thieves made a run for it. They were apprehended two days later while trying to dispose of the stolen property, which was recovered. George Brown, John Butler, Richard Mills, Christopher Bruncker and George Kenian were hanged at Tyburn for the offence on 22 January 1678/9.

In 1685, the notorious informer and confidence trickster Thomas Dangerfield, who was being returned to prison after a public whipping, was killed in Hatton Garden in an altercation with a barrister called Robert Francis, who struck him in the eye with his cane. Rather to the surprise of the general public, who thought the killing was an accident, Francis was convicted of murder and hanged.

In July 1993, thieves stole £7 million worth of gems belonging to the jewellers Graff Diamonds. This was London&#x27;s biggest gem heist of modern times.

In April 2015, an underground safe deposit facility in the Hatton Garden area was burgled in the Hatton Garden safe deposit burglary. The total stolen may have had a value of up to £200 million, although court reports referred to £14 million The theft was investigated by the Flying Squad, a branch of the Specialist, Organised &amp; Economic Crime Command within London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police Service, leading to the arrests and March 2016 convictions of seven perpetrators.

:Hatton Garden is the spot, down below
:Where we likes to go a lot, down below,
:Since a bloke from Leather Lane,
:Dropped a diamond down the drain,
:We&#x27;ll be going there again, down below.

<doc id="405035" wikidata="Q1415197" url="?curid=405035" title="List of film awards">
<text>This is a list of groups, organizations, and festivals that recognize achievements in cinema, usually by awarding various prizes. The awards sometimes also have popular unofficial names (such as the &quot;Oscar&quot; for Hollywood&#x27;s Academy Awards), which are mentioned if applicable. Many awards are simply identified by the name of the group presenting the award. 

Awards have been divided into four major categories: critics&#x27; awards, voted on (usually annually) by a group of critics; festival awards, awards presented to the best film shown in a particular film festival; industry awards, which are selected by professionals working in some branch of the movie industry; and audience awards, which are voted by the general public.

<text>The Cessna 170 is an American single-engine, four seat, general aviation aircraft produced by the Cessna Aircraft Company between 1948 and 1956.

It is the predecessor of the Cessna 172, the most produced aircraft in history, which replaced the 170 in production in 1956. 

==Development==

===170===
In late 1948, Cessna began sales of the 170, with a metal fuselage and tail and fabric-covered constant-chord wings. These earliest 170s were four-seat versions of the popular 140 with a more powerful Continental C145-2 and an extra interconnected fuel tank in one wing for a total of 36 gallons in three tanks. Like the 140, they were constructed of metal with fabric-covered wings supported by a &quot;V&quot; strut.

===170A===
In 1949, Cessna began marketing the 170A, an all-metal 170 with zero-dihedral wing tapered outboard of the slightly-enlarged plain flaps with 50 degrees maximum deflection, two 21 gallon fuel tanks, and a single strut replacing the &quot;V&quot; strut of the 170. This and subsequent versions of the 170 shared the fin/rudder shape of the larger Cessna 190 and 195 models.

===305===
In 1950, the United States Air Force, Army and Marines began using the military variant of the 170, the Model 305, designated the L-19 and later O-1 Bird Dog by the military. It was used as a forward air control and reconnaissance aircraft. The Bird Dog was extensively redesigned from the basic 170 and included a revised tandem-seat fuselage and a wing with large modified Fowler flaps that deployed up to 60°.

===170B===
In 1952, the Cessna 170B was introduced, featuring a new wing tapered outboard of the flaps, incorporating dihedral similar to the military version. The B model was equipped with very effective modified Fowler (slotted, rearward-traveling) wing flaps which deflect up to 40°, adapted from the C-305/Bird Dog, a wing design that lives on in the Cessna light singles of today (constant NACA 2412 section with a chord of from centerline to (the outboard end of the flaps), then tapering to NACA 2412 section chord at 208 inches from centerline, with three-degree washout across the tapered section). The 170B model also included a new tailplane, a revised tailwheel bracket, and other refinements over the 170 and 170A. It was marketed in 1952 for $7245.

In 1955, the previously elliptical rear side windows were changed to a squarer design.

=== 170C ===
The sole 170C, registered N37892 (c/n 609), was built in November 1954 with a redesigned squared vertical stabilizer. No production followed, and the prototype was converted to 170B standard with a rounded tail in January 1956. However, the 170C was developed into the Cessna 172, with early models sharing the squared tail of the 170C.

===Experimental===
In 1958, Cessna experimented with a belt driven 145 hp Continental engine. The company completed 1000 hours of test flying. The belt drive reduced vibration, engine noise and propeller noise. A 92 inch propeller with 70 degrees of pitch improved the rate of climb 12 percent. The belts used were developed by Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and were 3/8-inch wide, 7/16-inch deep, and 41 inches long.

===Successor===
The 170 is equipped with conventional landing gear, which is more challenging to land than tricycle landing gear. In 1956, Cessna introduced a replacement for the 170 that was essentially a nosewheel-equipped 170B with a square tailfin, designated the 172. 170 production was halted soon after the 172 became available.

===Model 309 and 319===
Between 1951 and 1955, Cessna used modifications of the 170 and its derivative, the U.S. Army L-19, as test beds for boundary layer control research, under contract to the Office of Naval Research and the Army Transportation Corps, designating them as the models 309 and 319. The project was done in conjunction with the University of Wichita which conducted extensive wind tunnel tests of the concept. The model 309 utilized the German World War II Arado lift-increasing system in which a jet pump inside the wing sucked in stagnant air from the flap area, energized it and blew the higher-speed air over the ailerons. Various chemicals and enhancements were used to power the jet pump. Better results were obtained by departing from the Arado jet pump method and using an engine-driven generator to power electric motors driving axial fans to move the internal air. 

This concept was adopted on the Model 319 but substituted an engine-driven hydraulic pump to drive hydraulic-powered axial fans. This model was more successful and resulted in the highest lift capacity, as measured by the maximum lift coefficient, recorded up to that time. The 319 demonstrated the capability of taking off in , landing in and clearing a obstacle in . The aircraft had a stall speed of .
The 309 and 319 were meant to be research aircraft only, and no plans were developed to incorporate boundary layer control technology in then-current Cessna models. Others were also working on the concept, and it was ultimately incorporated into the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter.

<text>The IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic (IEEE 754) is a technical standard for floating-point arithmetic originally established in 1985 by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The standard addressed many problems found in the diverse floating-point implementations that made them difficult to use reliably and portably. Many hardware floating-point units use the IEEE 754 standard.

The standard defines:
* &quot;arithmetic formats:&quot; sets of binary and decimal floating-point data, which consist of finite numbers (including signed zeros and subnormal numbers), infinities, and special &quot;not a number&quot; values (NaNs)
* &quot;interchange formats:&quot; encodings (bit strings) that may be used to exchange floating-point data in an efficient and compact form
* &quot;rounding rules:&quot; properties to be satisfied when rounding numbers during arithmetic and conversions
* &quot;operations:&quot; arithmetic and other operations (such as trigonometric functions) on arithmetic formats
* &quot;exception handling:&quot; indications of exceptional conditions (such as division by zero, overflow, etc.)

IEEE 754-2008, published in August 2008, includes nearly all of the original IEEE 754-1985 standard, plus the IEEE 854-1987 Standard for Radix-Independent Floating-Point Arithmetic. The current version, IEEE 754-2019, was published in July 2019. It is a minor revision of the previous version, incorporating mainly clarifications, defect fixes and new recommended operations.

==History==
The need for a floating-point standard arose from chaos in the business and scientific computing industry in the 1960s and 1970s. IBM used a hexadecimal floating-point format with . CDC and Cray computers used ones&#x27; complement representation, which admits a value of +0 and −0. CDC 60-bit computers did not have full 60-bit adders, so integer arithmetic was limited to 48 bits of precision from the floating-point unit. Exception processing from divide-by-zero was different on different computers. Moving data between systems and even repeating the same calculations on different systems was often difficult.

The first IEEE standard for floating-point arithmetic, IEEE 754-1985, was published in 1985. It covered only binary floating-point arithmetic.

A new version, IEEE 754-2008, was published in August 2008, following a seven-year revision process, chaired by Dan Zuras and edited by Mike Cowlishaw. It replaced both IEEE 754-1985 (binary floating-point arithmetic) and IEEE 854-1987 Standard for Radix-Independent Floating-Point Arithmetic. The binary formats in the original standard are included in this new standard along with three new basic formats, one binary and two decimal. To conform to the current standard, an implementation must implement at least one of the basic formats as both an arithmetic format and an interchange format.

The international standard ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 (with content identical to IEEE 754-2008) has been approved for adoption through ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 25 under the ISO/IEEE PSDO Agreement and published.

The current version, IEEE 754-2019 published in July 2019, is derived from and replaces IEEE 754-2008, following a revision process started in September 2015, chaired by David G. Hough and edited by Mike Cowlishaw. It incorporates mainly clarifications (e.g. &quot;totalOrder&quot;) and defect fixes (e.g. &quot;minNum&quot;), but also includes some new recommended operations (e.g. &quot;augmentedAddition&quot;).

The international standard ISO/IEC 60559:2020 (with content identical to IEEE 754-2019) has been approved for adoption through ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 25 and published.

The next projected revision of the standard is in 2029.

== Formats ==
An IEEE 754 &quot;format&quot; is a &quot;set of representations of numerical values and symbols&quot;. A format may also include how the set is encoded.

A floating-point format is specified by
* a base (also called &quot;radix&quot;) &quot;b&quot;, which is either 2 (binary) or 10 (decimal) in IEEE 754;
* a precision &quot;p&quot;;
* an exponent range from &quot;emin&quot; to &quot;emax&quot;, with &quot;emin&quot; = 1 − &quot;emax&quot;, or equivalently &quot;emin&quot; = − (&quot;emax&quot; − 1), for all IEEE 754 formats.

A format comprises
* Finite numbers, which can be described by three integers: &quot;s&quot; = a &quot;sign&quot; (zero or one), &quot;c&quot; = a &quot;significand&quot; (or &quot;coefficient&quot;) having no more than &quot;p&quot; digits when written in base &quot;b&quot; (i.e., an integer in the range through 0 to &quot;b&quot;&quot;p&quot; − 1), and &quot;q&quot; = an &quot;exponent&quot; such that &quot;emin&quot; ≤ &quot;q&quot; + &quot;p&quot; − 1 ≤ &quot;emax&quot;. The numerical value of such a finite number is . Moreover, there are two zero values, called signed zeros: the sign bit specifies whether a zero is +0 (positive zero) or −0 (negative zero).
* Two infinities: +∞ and −∞.
* Two kinds of NaN (not-a-number): a quiet NaN (qNaN) and a signaling NaN (sNaN).

For example, if &quot;b&quot; = 10, &quot;p&quot; = 7, and &quot;emax&quot; = 96, then &quot;emin&quot; = −95, the significand satisfies 0 ≤ &quot;c&quot; ≤ , and the exponent satisfies . Consequently, the smallest non-zero positive number that can be represented is 1×10−101, and the largest is 9999999×1090 (9.999999×1096), so the full range of numbers is −9.999999×1096 through 9.999999×1096. The numbers −&quot;b&quot;1−&quot;emax&quot; and &quot;b&quot;1−&quot;emax&quot; (here, −1×10−95 and 1×10−95) are the smallest (in magnitude) &quot;normal numbers&quot;; non-zero numbers between these smallest numbers are called subnormal numbers.

=== Representation and encoding in memory ===
Some numbers may have several possible floating-point representations. For instance, if &quot;b&quot; = 10, and &quot;p&quot; = 7, then −12.345 can be represented by −12345×10−3, −123450×10−4, and −1234500×10−5. However, for most operations, such as arithmetic operations, the result (value) does not depend on the representation of the inputs.

For the decimal formats, any representation is valid, and the set of these representations is called a &quot;cohort&quot;. When a result can have several representations, the standard specifies which member of the cohort is chosen.

For the binary formats, the representation is made unique by choosing the smallest representable exponent allowing the value to be represented exactly. Further, the exponent is not represented directly, but a bias is added so that the smallest representable exponent is represented as 1, with 0 used for subnormal numbers. For numbers with an exponent in the normal range (the exponent field being neither all ones nor all zeros), the leading bit of the significand will always be 1. Consequently, a leading 1 can be implied rather than explicitly present in the memory encoding, and under the standard the explicitly represented part of the significand will lie between 0 and 1. This rule is called &quot;leading bit convention&quot;, &quot;implicit bit convention&quot;, or &quot;hidden bit convention&quot;. This rule allows the binary format to have an extra bit of precision. The leading bit convention cannot be used for the subnormal numbers as they have an exponent outside the normal exponent range and scale by the smallest represented exponent as used for the smallest normal numbers.

Due to the possibility of multiple encodings (at least in formats called &quot;interchange formats&quot;), a NaN may carry other information: a sign bit (which has no meaning, but may be used by some operations) and a &quot;payload&quot;, which is intended for diagnostic information indicating the source of the NaN (but the payload may have other uses, such as &quot;NaN-boxing&quot;).

=== Basic and interchange formats ===

The standard defines five basic formats that are named for their numeric base and the number of bits used in their interchange encoding. There are three binary floating-point basic formats (encoded with 32, 64 or 128 bits) and two decimal floating-point basic formats (encoded with 64 or 128 bits). The binary32 and binary64 formats are the &quot;single&quot; and &quot;double&quot; formats of IEEE 754-1985 respectively. A conforming implementation must fully implement at least one of the basic formats.

The standard also defines &quot;interchange formats&quot;, which generalize these basic formats. For the binary formats, the leading bit convention is required. The following table summarizes some of the possible interchange formats (including the basic formats).

In the table above, integer values are exact, whereas values in decimal notation (e.g. 1.0) are rounded values. The minimum exponents listed are for normal numbers; the special subnormal number representation allows even smaller (in magnitude) numbers to be represented with some loss of precision. For example, the smallest positive number that can be represented in binary64 is 2−1074; contributions to the −1074 figure include the &quot;emin&quot; value −1022 and all but one of the 53 significand bits (2−1022 − (53 − 1) = 2−1074).

Decimal digits is the precision of the format expressed in terms of an equivalent number of decimal digits. It is computed as &quot;digits&quot; × log10 &quot;base&quot;. E.g. binary128 has approximately the same precision as a 34 digit decimal number.

log10 &quot;MAXVAL&quot; is a measure of the range of the encoding. Its integer part is the largest exponent shown on the output of a value in scientific notation with one leading digit in the significand before the decimal point (e.g. 1.698·1038 is near the largest value in binary32, 9.999999·1096 is the largest value in decimal32).

The binary32 (single) and binary64 (double) formats are two of the most common formats used today. The figure below shows the absolute precision for both formats over a range of values. This figure can be used to select an appropriate format given the expected value of a number and the required precision.

An example of a layout for 32-bit floating point is

and the 64 bit layout is similar.

=== Extended and extendable precision formats ===
The standard specifies optional extended and extendable precision formats, which provide greater precision than the basic formats. An extended precision format extends a basic format by using more precision and more exponent range. An extendable precision format allows the user to specify the precision and exponent range. An implementation may use whatever internal representation it chooses for such formats; all that needs to be defined are its parameters (&quot;b&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, and &quot;emax&quot;). These parameters uniquely describe the set of finite numbers (combinations of sign, significand, and exponent for the given radix) that it can represent.

The standard recommends that language standards provide a method of specifying &quot;p&quot; and &quot;emax&quot; for each supported base &quot;b&quot;. The standard recommends that language standards and implementations support an extended format which has a greater precision than the largest basic format supported for each radix &quot;b&quot;. For an extended format with a precision between two basic formats the exponent range must be as great as that of the next wider basic format. So for instance a 64-bit extended precision binary number must have an &#x27;emax&#x27; of at least 16383. The x87 80-bit extended format meets this requirement.

The original IEEE 754-1985 standard also had the concept of &quot;extended formats&quot;, but without any mandatory relation between &quot;emin&quot; and &quot;emax&quot;. For example, the Motorola 68881 80-bit format, where &quot;emin&quot; = − &quot;emax&quot;, was a conforming extended format, but it became non-conforming in the 2008 revision.

=== Interchange formats ===
Interchange formats are intended for the exchange of floating-point data using a bit string of fixed length for a given format.

====Binary====
For the exchange of binary floating-point numbers, interchange formats of length 16 bits, 32 bits, 64 bits, and any multiple of 32 bits ≥ 128 are defined. The 16-bit format is intended for the exchange or storage of small numbers (e.g., for graphics).

The encoding scheme for these binary interchange formats is the same as that of IEEE 754-1985: a sign bit, followed by &quot;w&quot; exponent bits that describe the exponent offset by a &quot;bias&quot;, and &quot;p&quot; − 1 bits that describe the significand. The width of the exponent field for a &quot;k&quot;-bit format is computed as &quot;w&quot; = round(4 log2(&quot;k&quot;)) − 13. The existing 64- and 128-bit formats follow this rule, but the 16- and 32-bit formats have more exponent bits (5 and 8 respectively) than this formula would provide (3 and 7 respectively).

As with IEEE 754-1985, the biased-exponent field is filled with all 1 bits to indicate either infinity (trailing significand field = 0) or a NaN (trailing significand field ≠ 0). For NaNs, quiet NaNs and signaling NaNs are distinguished by using the most significant bit of the trailing significand field exclusively, and the payload is carried in the remaining bits.

====Decimal====
For the exchange of decimal floating-point numbers, interchange formats of any multiple of 32 bits are defined. As with binary interchange, the encoding scheme for the decimal interchange formats encodes the sign, exponent, and significand. Two different bit-level encodings are defined, and interchange is complicated by the fact that some external indicator of the encoding in use may be required.

The two options allow the significand to be encoded as a compressed sequence of decimal digits using densely packed decimal or, alternatively, as a binary integer. The former is more convenient for direct hardware implementation of the standard, while the latter is more suited to software emulation on a binary computer. In either case, the set of numbers (combinations of sign, significand, and exponent) that may be encoded is identical, and special values (±zero with the minimum exponent, ±infinity, quiet NaNs, and signaling NaNs) have identical encodings.

== Rounding rules ==
The standard defines five rounding rules. The first two rules round to a nearest value; the others are called &quot;directed roundings&quot;:

=== Roundings to nearest ===
* Round to nearest, ties to even – rounds to the nearest value; if the number falls midway, it is rounded to the nearest value with an even least significant digit.
* Round to nearest, ties away from zero (or ties to away)  – rounds to the nearest value; if the number falls midway, it is rounded to the nearest value above (for positive numbers) or below (for negative numbers).
At the extremes, a value with a magnitude strictly less than formula_1 will be rounded to the minimum or maximum finite number (depending on the value&#x27;s sign). Any numbers with exactly this magnitude are considered ties; this choice of tie may be conceptualized as the midpoint between formula_2 and formula_3, which, were the exponent not limited, would be the next representable floating-point numbers larger in magnitude. Numbers with a magnitude strictly larger than are rounded to the corresponding infinity.

&quot;Round to nearest, ties to even&quot; is the default for binary floating point and the recommended default for decimal. &quot;Round to nearest, ties to away&quot; is only required for decimal implementations.

=== Directed roundings ===
* Round toward 0 – directed rounding towards zero (also known as &quot;truncation&quot;).
* Round toward +∞ – directed rounding towards positive infinity (also known as &quot;rounding up&quot; or &quot;ceiling&quot;).
* Round toward −∞ – directed rounding towards negative infinity (also known as &quot;rounding down&quot; or &quot;floor&quot;).

Unless specified otherwise, the floating-point result of an operation is determined by applying the rounding function on the infinitely precise (mathematical) result. Such an operation is said to be &quot;correctly rounded&quot;. This requirement is called &quot;correct rounding&quot;.

== Required operations ==

Required operations for a supported arithmetic format (including the basic formats) include:

* Conversions to and from integer
* Previous and next consecutive values
* Arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide, square root, fused multiply–add, remainder, minimum, maximum)
* Conversions (between formats, to and from strings, etc.)
* Scaling and (for decimal) quantizing
* Copying and manipulating the sign (abs, negate, etc.)
* Comparisons and total ordering
* Classification of numbers (subnormal, finite, etc.) and testing for NaNs
* Testing and setting status flags

=== Comparison predicates ===

The standard provides comparison predicates to compare one floating-point datum to another in the supported arithmetic format. Any comparison with a NaN is treated as unordered. −0 and +0 compare as equal.

=== Total-ordering predicate ===

The standard provides a predicate &quot;totalOrder&quot;, which defines a total ordering on canonical members of the supported arithmetic format. The predicate agrees with the comparison predicates (see section ) when one floating-point number is less than the other. The main differences are:
* NaN is sortable.
** NaN is treated as if it had a larger absolute value than Infinity (or any other floating-point numbers). (−NaN &lt; −Infinity; +Infinity &lt; +NaN.)
** qNaN and sNaN are treated as if qNaN had a larger absolute value than sNaN. (−qNaN &lt; −sNaN; +sNaN &lt; +qNaN.)
** NaN is then sorted according to the payload. In IEEE 754-2008, a NaN with a lesser payload is treated as having a lesser absolute value. In IEEE 754-2019, any implementation-defined ordering is acceptable.
* Negative zero is treated as smaller than positive zero.
* If both sides of the comparison refer to the same floating-point datum, the one with the lesser exponent is treated as having a lesser absolute value.

The &quot;totalOrder&quot; predicate does not impose a total ordering on all encodings in a format. In particular, it does not distinguish among different encodings of the same floating-point representation, as when one or both encodings are non-canonical. IEEE 754-2019 incorporates clarifications of &quot;totalOrder&quot;.

For the binary interchange formats whose encoding follows the IEEE 754-2008 recommendation on placement of the NaN signaling bit, the comparison is identical to one that type puns the floating-point numbers to a sign–magnitude integer (assuming a payload ordering consistent with this comparison), an old trick for FP comparison without an FPU.

== Exception handling ==
The standard defines five exceptions, each of which returns a default value and has a corresponding status flag that is raised when the exception occurs. No other exception handling is required, but additional non-default alternatives are recommended (see ).

The five possible exceptions are
* Invalid operation: mathematically undefined, e.g., the square root of a negative number. By default, returns qNaN.
* Division by zero: an operation on finite operands gives an exact infinite result, e.g., 1/0 or log(0). By default, returns ±infinity.
* Overflow: a finite result is too large to be represented accurately (i.e., its exponent with an unbounded exponent range would be larger than &quot;emax&quot;). By default, returns ±infinity for the round-to-nearest modes (and follows the rounding rules for the directed rounding modes).
* Underflow: a result is very small (outside the normal range). By default, returns a number less than or equal to the minimum positive normal number in magnitude (following the rounding rules); a subnormal number always implies an underflow exception, but by default, if it is exact, no flag is raised.
* Inexact: the exact (i.e., unrounded) result is not representable exactly. By default, returns the correctly rounded result.

These are the same five exceptions as were defined in IEEE 754-1985, but the &quot;division by zero&quot; exception has been extended to operations other than the division.

Some decimal floating-point implementations define additional exceptions, which are not part of IEEE 754:
* Clamped: a result&#x27;s exponent is too large for the destination format. By default, trailing zeros will be added to the coefficient to reduce the exponent to the largest usable value. If this is not possible (because this would cause the number of digits needed to be more than the destination format) then an overflow exception occurs.
* Rounded: a result&#x27;s coefficient requires more digits than the destination format provides. An inexact exception is signaled if any non-zero digits are discarded.

Additionally, operations like quantize when either operand is infinite, or when the result does not fit the destination format, will also signal invalid operation exception.

== Special values ==
=== Signed zero ===

In the IEEE 754 standard, zero is signed, meaning that there exist both a &quot;positive zero&quot; (+0) and a &quot;negative zero&quot; (−0). In most run-time environments, positive zero is usually printed as &quot;codice_1&quot; and the negative zero as &quot;codice_2&quot;. The two values behave as equal in numerical comparisons, but some operations return different results for +0 and −0. For instance, 1/(−0) returns negative infinity, while 1/(+0) returns positive infinity (so that the identity is maintained). Other common functions with a discontinuity at &quot;x&quot;=0 which might treat +0 and −0 differently include (&quot;x&quot;) and the principal square root of for any negative number &quot;y&quot;. As with any approximation scheme, operations involving &quot;negative zero&quot; can occasionally cause confusion. For example, in IEEE 754, does not always imply , as 0 = −0 but 1/0 ≠ 1/(−0). Moreover, for the reciprocal square root, is while the mathematical function formula_4 over the real numbers does not have any negative value.
=== Subnormal numbers ===

Subnormal values fill the underflow gap with values where the absolute distance between them is the same as for adjacent values just outside the underflow gap. This is an improvement over the older practice to just have zero in the underflow gap, and where underflowing results were replaced by zero (flush to zero).

Modern floating-point hardware usually handles subnormal values (as well as normal values), and does not require software emulation for subnormals.

=== Infinities ===

The infinities of the extended real number line can be represented in IEEE floating-point datatypes, just like ordinary floating-point values like 1, 1.5, etc. They are not error values in any way, though they are often (depends on the rounding) used as replacement values when there is an overflow. Upon a divide-by-zero exception, a positive or negative infinity is returned as an exact result. An infinity can also be introduced as a numeral (like C&#x27;s &quot;INFINITY&quot; macro, or &quot;&quot; if the programming language allows that syntax).

IEEE 754 requires infinities to be handled in a reasonable way, such as
* 
* NaN – there is no meaningful thing to do

=== NaNs ===

IEEE 754 specifies a special value called &quot;Not a Number&quot; (NaN) to be returned as the result of certain &quot;invalid&quot; operations, such as 0/0, , or sqrt(−1). In general, NaNs will be propagated, i.e. most operations involving a NaN will result in a NaN, although functions that would give some defined result for any given floating-point value will do so for NaNs as well, e.g. NaN ^ 0 = 1. There are two kinds of NaNs: the default &quot;quiet&quot; NaNs and, optionally, &quot;signaling&quot; NaNs. A signaling NaN in any arithmetic operation (including numerical comparisons) will cause an &quot;invalid operation&quot; exception to be signaled.

The representation of NaNs specified by the standard has some unspecified bits that could be used to encode the type or source of error; but there is no standard for that encoding. In theory, signaling NaNs could be used by a runtime system to flag uninitialized variables, or extend the floating-point numbers with other special values without slowing down the computations with ordinary values, although such extensions are not common.

== Design rationale ==
It is a common misconception that the more esoteric features of the IEEE 754 standard discussed here, such as extended formats, NaN, infinities, subnormals etc., are only of interest to numerical analysts, or for advanced numerical applications. In fact the opposite is true: these features are designed to give safe robust defaults for numerically unsophisticated programmers, in addition to supporting sophisticated numerical libraries by experts. The key designer of IEEE 754, William Kahan notes that it is incorrect to &quot;... [deem] features of IEEE Standard 754 for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic that ...[are] not appreciated to be features usable by none but numerical experts. The facts are quite the opposite. In 1977 those features were designed into the Intel 8087 to serve the widest possible market... Error-analysis tells us how to design floating-point arithmetic, like IEEE Standard 754, moderately tolerant of well-meaning ignorance among programmers&quot;.
* The special values such as infinity and NaN ensure that the floating-point arithmetic is algebraically complete: every floating-point operation produces a well-defined result and will not—by default—throw a machine interrupt or trap. Moreover, the choices of special values returned in exceptional cases were designed to give the correct answer in many cases. For instance, under IEEE 754 arithmetic, continued fractions such as R(z) := 7 − 3/[z − 2 − 1/(z − 7 + 10/[z − 2 − 2/(z − 3)])] will give the correct answer on all inputs, as the potential divide by zero, e.g. for , is correctly handled by giving +infinity, and so such exceptions can be safely ignored. As noted by Kahan, the unhandled trap consecutive to a floating-point to 16-bit integer conversion overflow that caused the loss of an Ariane 5 rocket would not have happened under the default IEEE 754 floating-point policy.
* Subnormal numbers ensure that for &quot;finite&quot; floating-point numbers x and y, x − y = 0 if and only if x = y, as expected, but which did not hold under earlier floating-point representations.
* On the design rationale of the x87 80-bit format, Kahan notes: &quot;This Extended format is designed to be used, with negligible loss of speed, for all but the simplest arithmetic with float and double operands. For example, it should be used for scratch variables in loops that implement recurrences like polynomial evaluation, scalar products, partial and continued fractions. It often averts premature Over/Underflow or severe local cancellation that can spoil simple algorithms&quot;. Computing intermediate results in an extended format with high precision and extended exponent has precedents in the historical practice of scientific calculation and in the design of scientific calculators e.g. Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s financial calculators performed arithmetic and financial functions to three more significant decimals than they stored or displayed. The implementation of extended precision enabled standard elementary function libraries to be readily developed that normally gave double precision results within one unit in the last place (ULP) at high speed.
* Correct rounding of values to the nearest representable value avoids systematic biases in calculations and slows the growth of errors. Rounding ties to even removes the statistical bias that can occur in adding similar figures.
* Directed rounding was intended as an aid with checking error bounds, for instance in interval arithmetic. It is also used in the implementation of some functions.
* The mathematical basis of the operations, in particular correct rounding, allows one to prove mathematical properties and design floating-point algorithms such as 2Sum, Fast2Sum and Kahan summation algorithm, e.g. to improve accuracy or implement multiple-precision arithmetic subroutines relatively easily.

A property of the single- and double-precision formats is that their encoding allows one to easily sort them without using floating-point hardware, as if the bits represented sign-magnitude integers, although it is unclear whether this was a design consideration (it seems noteworthy that the earlier IBM hexadecimal floating-point representation also had this property for normalized numbers). With the prevalent two&#x27;s-complement representation, interpreting the bits as signed integers sorts the positives correctly, but with the negatives reversed; as one possible correction for that, with an xor to flip the sign bit for positive values and all bits for negative values, all the values become sortable as unsigned integers (with ).

== Recommendations ==

=== Alternate exception handling ===
The standard recommends optional exception handling in various forms, including presubstitution of user-defined default values, and traps (exceptions that change the flow of control in some way) and other exception handling models that interrupt the flow, such as try/catch. The traps and other exception mechanisms remain optional, as they were in IEEE 754-1985.

=== Recommended operations ===
Clause 9 in the standard recommends additional mathematical operations that language standards should define. None are required in order to conform to the standard.

The following are recommended arithmetic operations, which must round correctly:
* formula_5, formula_6, formula_7
* formula_8, formula_9, formula_10
* formula_11, formula_12, formula_13
* formula_14, formula_15, formula_16
* formula_17
* formula_4
* formula_19 for formula_20 (named &quot;compound&quot; and used to compute an exponential growth, whose rate cannot be less than −1)
* formula_21
* formula_22, formula_23
* formula_24, formula_25, formula_26
* formula_27, formula_28, formula_29, formula_30
* formula_31, formula_32, formula_33 (see also: Multiples of π)
* formula_34, formula_35, formula_36, formula_37 (see also: Multiples of π)
* formula_38, formula_39, formula_40
* formula_41, formula_42, formula_43

The formula_44, formula_45 and formula_46 functions were not part of the IEEE 754-2008 standard because they were deemed less necessary. formula_44 and formula_45 were mentioned, but this was regarded as an error. All three were added in the 2019 revision.

The recommended operations also include setting and accessing dynamic mode rounding direction, and implementation-defined vector reduction operations such as sum, scaled product, and dot product, whose accuracy is unspecified by the standard.
, &quot;augmented arithmetic operations&quot; for the binary formats are also recommended. These operations, specified for addition, subtraction and multiplication, produce a pair of values consisting of a result correctly rounded to nearest in the format and the error term, which is representable exactly in the format. At the time of publication of the standard, no hardware implementations are known, but very similar operations were already implemented in software using well-known algorithms. The history and motivation for their standardization are explained in a background document.
As of 2019, the formerly required &quot;minNum&quot;, &quot;maxNum&quot;, &quot;minNumMag&quot;, and &quot;maxNumMag&quot; in IEEE 754-2008 are now deprecated due to their non-associativity. Instead, two sets of new minimum and maximum operations are recommended. The first set contains &quot;minimum&quot;, &quot;minimumNumber&quot;, &quot;maximum&quot; and &quot;maximumNumber&quot;. The second set contains &quot;minimumMagnitude&quot;, &quot;minimumMagnitudeNumber&quot;, &quot;maximumMagnitude&quot; and &quot;maximumMagnitudeNumber&quot;. The history and motivation for this change are explained in a background document.

=== Expression evaluation ===
The standard recommends how language standards should specify the semantics of sequences of operations, and points out the subtleties of literal meanings and optimizations that change the value of a result. By contrast, the previous 1985 version of the standard left aspects of the language interface unspecified, which led to inconsistent behavior between compilers, or different optimization levels in an optimizing compiler.

Programming languages should allow a user to specify a minimum precision for intermediate calculations of expressions for each radix. This is referred to as &quot;preferredWidth&quot; in the standard, and it should be possible to set this on a per-block basis. Intermediate calculations within expressions should be calculated, and any temporaries saved, using the maximum of the width of the operands and the preferred width if set. Thus, for instance, a compiler targeting x87 floating-point hardware should have a means of specifying that intermediate calculations must use the double-extended format. The stored value of a variable must always be used when evaluating subsequent expressions, rather than any precursor from before rounding and assigning to the variable.

=== Reproducibility ===
The IEEE 754-1985 version of the standard allowed many variations in implementations (such as the encoding of some values and the detection of certain exceptions). IEEE 754-2008 has reduced these allowances, but a few variations still remain (especially for binary formats). The reproducibility clause recommends that language standards should provide a means to write reproducible programs (i.e., programs that will produce the same result in all implementations of a language) and describes what needs to be done to achieve reproducible results.

== Character representation ==
The standard requires operations to convert between basic formats and &quot;external character sequence&quot; formats. Conversions to and from a decimal character format are required for all formats. Conversion to an external character sequence must be such that conversion back using round to nearest, ties to even will recover the original number. There is no requirement to preserve the payload of a quiet NaN or signaling NaN, and conversion from the external character sequence may turn a signaling NaN into a quiet NaN.

The original binary value will be preserved by converting to decimal and back again using:
* 5 decimal digits for binary16,
* 9 decimal digits for binary32,
* 17 decimal digits for binary64,
* 36 decimal digits for binary128.

For other binary formats, the required number of decimal digits is

: formula_49

where &quot;p&quot; is the number of significant bits in the binary format, e.g. 237 bits for binary256.

When using a decimal floating-point format, the decimal representation will be preserved using:
* 7 decimal digits for decimal32,
* 16 decimal digits for decimal64,
* 34 decimal digits for decimal128.

Algorithms, with code, for correctly rounded conversion from binary to decimal and decimal to binary are discussed by Gay, and for testing by Paxson and Kahan.

=== Hexadecimal literals ===

The standard recommends providing conversions to and from &quot;external hexadecimal-significand character sequences&quot;, based on C99&#x27;s hexadecimal floating point literals. Such a literal consists of an optional sign (codice_3 or codice_4), the indicator &quot;0x&quot;, a hexadecimal number with or without a period, an exponent indicator &quot;p&quot;, and a decimal exponent with optional sign. The syntax is not case-sensitive. The decimal exponent scales by powers of 2. For example, codice_5 is 1/16 and codice_6 is 1/256.

<doc id="405043" wikidata="Q526224" url="?curid=405043" title="Blackheath, New South Wales">
<text>Blackheath (postcode: 2785) is a town located near the highest point of the Blue Mountains, between Katoomba and Mount Victoria in New South Wales, Australia. The town&#x27;s altitude is about and it is located about west north-west of Sydney, north-west of Katoomba, and about south-east of Lithgow.

Blackheath has a vibrant artistic community and hosts two monthly markets – the Blackheath Growers Market and The Blackheath Community Market, as well as annual Christmas markets, antique markets and bimonthly craft markets. The town has many community activities, such as the Blackheath Philosophy Forum, which was founded in 2002 to arrange public discussion forums on philosophy and related topics.

As Blackheath has grown, more and more shops have appeared. Various shops from the late 1800s still stand in Blackheath.

== History ==

The surrounding areas of Blackheath were thought to be a summer corroboree meeting place for peoples of the Darug, Gundungurra and Wiradjuri nations.

Following European settlement of Australia, the site was originally named Hounslow. After crossing the Blue Mountains in 1815 and returning from Bathurst, Governor Lachlan Macquarie renamed the settlement as &quot;Black-Heath&quot;, in reference to the colour and texture of the native shrubbery in the area. Macquarie recorded in his journal: 
&quot;This place having a black wild appearance I have this day named it Black-Heath.&quot;

The first building in Blackheath, the &quot;Scotch Thistle Inn&quot;, was erected by Andrew Gardner in 1831 and Charles Darwin visited the inn in 1836. The extent of the original grant of land to Gardner can be seen today as the area bound by the Great Western Highway, Govetts Leap Road and (the misspelt) Gardiners Crescent.

Blackheath developed into a town after the Main Western railway line was built in 1869; the current station location was completed in 1883. A large dam built to supply water for railway steam engines became the public baths well before steam operations ceased upon electrification. The baths opened for public swimming in 1931 and since then have been redeveloped to include swimming pools, children&#x27;s play facilities and surrounding park lands. Blackheath&#x27;s original post office opened in 1910 and has now been converted into a clothing shop.

Blackheath&#x27;s sporting claim to fame is that Don Bradman hit a century off three overs for the Blackheath team in November 1931 at Blackheath Oval in a social match against Lithgow. He went on to make 256. Blackheath Oval is now home to the Blackheath Cricket Team.

== Heritage listings ==
Blackheath has a number of heritage listed sites, including:
*Blue Mountains National Park: Blue Mountains walking tracks
*Main Western railway: Blackheath railway station

==People==

At the , Blackheath had a population of people. Of these:
*Age distribution: The residents&#x27; median age was 53 years, which is fifteen years older than the national median age of 38. Children aged under 15 years made up 13.6% of the population (national average is 18.2%) and people aged 65 years and over made up 29.9% of the population (national average is 17.2%).
* Ethnic diversity: 73.0% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 6.9%. 87.8% of people only spoke English at home.
*Finances: The median household weekly income was $1,322, compared to the national median of $1,746. This difference is also reflected in real estate, with the median mortgage payment being $1,842 per month, compared to the national median of $1,721.
*Housing: Of occupied private dwellings in Blackheath, 96.2% were separate houses. The average household size was 2.0 people.
*Religion: The most common responses for religion were No Religion 51.9%, Anglican 11.5% and Catholic 12.7%.

== Local attractions ==
===Govetts Leap===

From Blackheath town centre, a short drive to the east-north-east takes visitors to Govetts Leap, a lookout with views of the Grose Valley and nearby waterfalls. The fall is named after William Romaine Govett, an assistant to the Surveyor General at the time, who first came upon the falls in June 1831. The name &#x27;leap&#x27; is an old Scottish word meaning waterfall or cascade.

===Evans Lookout===

Evans Lookout provides an alternate vantage point for views, also into Grose Valley.

===Other lookouts, walking tracks and attractions===
Pulpit Rock, Perrys Lookdown, and Anvil Rock are other lookouts to the north-northeast of the town centre, off Hat Hill Road. There are several walking tracks starting from the lookouts, including short walks to enjoy different views, longer half and whole day walks, and walks involving camping overnight or several days&#x27; walk. Canyoners and rockclimbers also base themselves at Blackheath for activities in the surrounding national park. The Blue Gum Forest may be accessed from Perrys Lookdown.

The area is known today for its colourful blooms in Spring and golden Autumn foliage as the weather begins to cool. In September, daffodils bloom, and on the first weekend of November, Blackheath hosts an annual Rhododendron Festival.

The Campbell Rhododendron Gardens are located north-north-east of the town centre, in Bachante Street. The gardens comprise rhododendrons/azaleas planted underneath a native Australian bush canopy tended by the volunteers of The Blue Mountains Rhododendron Society of NSW.

The ornamental cherry trees that line the streets are usually in full bloom in the first week of October.

Mount Boyce lookout is located northwest of Blackheath, towards Lithgow. The Megalong Valley can be accessed from Blackheath, about away to the west, via Mount Victoria.

Blackheath has a number of cafés and restaurants, a large antique centre, and other shops. It is a common destination for people from Sydney for a weekend excursion or a Sunday drive. Due to the climate, Blackheath is a popular destination for Christmas in July.

== Rhododendron Festival ==
One of Blackheath&#x27;s main festivals and celebrations is the Rhododendron Festival, commonly known as the &#x27;Rhodo&#x27; Festival. Occurring on the first Sunday of November, the festival commemorates the flowering of the Rhododendron Tree, a species commonly planted throughout Blackheath by European settlers, especially in the Blackheath Soldiers Memorial Park and the Campbell Rhododendron Gardens The festival includes a parade, as well as stalls from local businesses. The date also coincides with the opening weekend of the Blackheath Pool.

==Transport==

Blackheath was connected to the Main Western railway line in 1869, and the town is now served by the Blackheath railway station located on the Blue Mountains Line.

The Great Western Highway is the main road access route, through the town&#x27;s main business district. To the northwest of Blackheath, at Mount Victoria, the Darling Causeway connects the Great Western Highway to the Bells Line of Road at Bell. Several proposals have been investigated for upgrading the Great Western Highway west of Blackheath as a tunnel. As of 2024, the tunnel project has been indefinitely shelved.

On the day of the 2016 Census, the most common methods of travel to work for employed people were: Car, as driver 56.6%, Worked at home 12.7% and Train 5.4%.

Blue Mountains Transit operates two bus routes through the suburb of Blackheath:

* 698: Katoomba to Blackheath
* 698V: Katoomba to Mount Victoria
== Wildlife ==

A large amount of wildlife inhabit in and around Blackheath. Mammals such as the Eastern Grey Kangaroo and Echidna live in the forests around Blackheath.

Rare bird species also occur, such as the Lesser Sooty Owl and Regent Honeyeater.

== Geography and climate ==

The area around Blackheath has views over the Grose Valley from Evans Lookout and Govetts Leap in the east, and the vista of the Megalong Valley from Hargraves Lookout in the west, past the small hamlet of Shipley.

As the highest town in the Blue Mountains, Blackheath receives snow in winter (two settled falls per season is the average with another five to ten days of light snow showers) and even in summer the temperatures are generally mild in comparison to other locations at the same latitude. Average maximum temperature in winter is around although some days struggle to get above . Frosts are fairly common but not as common or strong as frosts on the Oberon Plateau or in places further west, like Bathurst and Orange. Local topography tends to keep minimum temperatures in the range as the coldest air during radiative cooling (clear, calm nights) drains into the valleys.

In summer, average maximum temperatures are around but temperatures occasionally peak at on some days during mid-summer and can also drop to the mid teens, or lower, during southerly changes or when onshore troughs persist on the east coast. Minimum temperatures in summer are typically around but minimums in single figures also occur, more commonly in December. In December 2011, a minimum of was recorded.

Blackheath&#x27;s location on a high ridge makes it vulnerable to strong and sometimes destructive winds, especially in the winter months when cold fronts surge up from the Southern Ocean, producing land gales. On 5 July 2011 a strong cold front passed over the area that produced winds that officially gusted up to , causing many trees to be uprooted and extensive damage to some property. The Venturi effect, where airflow is constricted by vertical cliffs and deep valleys, would probably have produced winds notably stronger than this in vulnerable locations in town and nearby. Land gales are more likely to occur from around April to November but vary in their intensity from year to year. Spring and summer storms can also produce fresh to strong winds, typically in the range of .

Blackheath can also be prone to fogs and thunderstorms, although this varies notably from year to year. Some days in summer are quite humid, allowing for moisture to build during the day, sometimes creating severe storms that can last for hours. The most common cause for quite frequent spring/summer thunderstorms in and around Blackheath is related to the early, mid morning heating of the lower atmosphere, due to the town&#x27;s elevation.

Blackheath is surrounded by the Blue Mountains National Park which is prone to bushfires. In November 2006 severe bushfires threatened Blackheath from the north.

Blackheath experiences a subtropical highland climate with monthly average temperatures not falling below and not exceeding . Blackheath&#x27;s average annual precipitation is just over .

<doc id="405044" wikidata="Q1159473" url="?curid=405044" title="Danelectro">
<text>Danelectro is a brand of musical instruments and accessories that was founded in Red Bank, New Jersey, in 1947. The company is known primarily for its string instruments that employed unique designs and manufacturing processes. The Danelectro company was sold to the Music Corporation of America (MCA) in 1966, moved to a much larger plant in Neptune City, New Jersey, and employed more than 500 people. Nevertheless, three years later Danelectro closed its plant.

In the late 1990s, the Evets Corporation started selling instruments and accessories under the Danelectro name. In 2016, Danelectro introduced new models, including a resonator guitar.

Some of the products manufactured by Danelectro include electric and resonator guitars, basses, electric sitars, amplifiers, pickups, and effects units.

==History==

Danelectro was founded by in 1947. Throughout the late 1940s, the company produced amplifiers for Sears, Roebuck and Company and Montgomery Ward, branded Silvertone and Airline respectively.

Later, Danelectro added hollow-bodied guitars, constructed of Masonite and poplar to save costs and increase production speed, intending to produce no-frills guitars of reasonably good tone at low cost. These instruments were branded either as Danelectro or (for Sears) Silvertone, distinguished by the Silvertone maroon vinyl covering, and the Danelectro light-colored tweed covering. The guitars used concentric stacked tone/volume knobs on the two-pickup models of both series and &quot;lipstick-tube&quot; pickups, which contained the pickup components inside metal tubes that resembled lipstick containers of the era. 

In 1956, Danelectro introduced the six-string bass guitar. Though the model never became widely popular, it found an enduring niche in Nashville and Los Angeles for &quot;tic-tac&quot; bass lines, where the electric instrument doubled the line played by an upright acoustic bass. 

In 1966, Danelectro was sold to the Music Corporation of America. A year later, in 1967, they introduced the Coral line, known for its hollow-bodies and electric sitars.

In 1969, Danelectro closed down, burdened by MCA&#x27;s attempt to market their guitars to small guitar shops rather than large department stores.

In the late 1990s, importer The Evets Corporation purchased the Danelectro brand name, marketing recreations of old Silvertone and Danelectro guitars and newly designed effects pedals and small amplifiers made in China. After initially selling well, guitar sales slowed and Danelectro stopped selling guitars after 2001 (2004 on the official site) to concentrate on effects pedals. In 2006 (2005 on official site), new owners of Evets decided on a new marketing model for guitars, selling a limited number each year.

==Guitars==

===Danelectro C===
The Danelectro C was put into production and retailed from 1954 to 1955 until being replaced by the Danelectro U model in 1956. Unlike most of the later Danelectro instruments, the C model was a solid body construction made of poplar and came in a peanut-like body shape.

===Danelectro U2===
The Danelectro U2 is a dual-pickup hollow-bodied guitar made of Masonite and shaped similar to a Les Paul style guitar. It was the most enduringly popular of the U-series. A single-pickup version (the U1) and triple-pickup version (the U3) were manufactured and sold alongside the U2. They were originally made from the years 1956 to 1958. It was reissued in the late 1990s, in 2006 in a slightly modified form as the &#x27;56 Pro, and again in 2010 as the &#x27;56 Single Cutaway.

===Danelectro Shorthorn===
The Danelectro Shorthorn line of guitars are a dual cutaway hollow-bodied design made of Masonite and poplar. The original models were introduced in 1959.

===Danelectro Dano Pro===
The Danelectro Dano Pro is a beginner electric guitar made by Danelectro in 1963 and 1964; it was reissued in 2007 and again in 2012. The original was a 3/4-scale guitar with a single lipstick tube pickup. The reissue features two pickups rather than one.

==Effects pedals==

The FAB series of guitar effect pedals is a budget range of pedals made by the Danelectro company that are manufactured in China. The series was launched in 2005 with the release of the FAB Distortion, FAB Overdrive, and FAB Metal pedals. Currently, eight pedals share the same distinctive injection moulded plastic casing and blue LED light. Each has a mains power DC9 socket or can be powered by a nine-volt battery. They market eight pedals lines: original effects, FAB effects, mini effects, vintage effects, Wasabi effects, Paisley effects, Cool Cat effects, and other miscellaneous effects. All run on nine-volt batteries or power adapters. The original effects featured metal enclosures and FET switching. Cool Cat models were designed with metal enclosures and true-bypass switching. Danelectro began rolling out Cool Cat V2 pedals, featuring extra &quot;under the hood&quot; features. Mini effects pedals are smaller, compact pedals with effects resembling those of the original effects and the FAB effects. Vintage effects include the large, rectangular Spring King and Reel Echo effect pedals. The discontinued Paisley series featured paisley-patterned drive effects in original style enclosures. The Wasabi series features large, futuristic-looking metal enclosures. FAB effects are the cheapest of the brand&#x27;s lineup and feature plastic enclosures somewhat larger than the Mini effects series.

In 2006, Danelectro sold a carrying case that holds up to five mini effects. When the player is ready to play, the top could be removed and the bottom acts as a pedals board. It was shortly discontinued. Not long after, another carrying case was developed to fit five FAB or Cool Cat pedals as well as serve as a pedal board.

Despite the advantages of the mini effects, FAB effects are more common. The Mini effects are less expensive, but the plastic construction makes them fragile.

<text>Sergio Oliva (; July 4, 1941 – November 12, 2012), often known by his epithet &#x27;The Myth&#x27; for his physique and performance, was a Cuban American bodybuilder and three-time Mr. Olympia winner.

==Early life==
Sergio Oliva was born on July 4, 1941, in Guantanamo, Cuba, during the presidency of Fulgencio Batista. As a teenager, Sergio was able to perform clean &amp; jerks above 400 pounds. He was selected to represent Cuba at the 1962 Central America and Caribbean Games. While representing Cuba in Jamaica, he successfully claimed political asylum in the United States. Soon after, 65 other Cuban nationals, which included Castro&#x27;s entire weightlifting team and their security guards, followed Oliva by seeking asylum in the US. In the United States Oliva lived in Miami, Florida, where he worked as a TV repairman.

==Career==
Oliva won the Mr. Olympia title three years from 1967 to 1969 in a row. He competed at a contest weight of 225–245 lbs. His second title in 1968 was uncontested. In 1969, he won his third consecutive Mr. Olympia by beating four-time Mr. Universe winner Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Oliva was banned from competing in the 1971 IFBB Mr. Olympia competition due to the fact that he competed in the 1971 NABBA Mr. Universe, allowing Schwarzenegger to claim the title. In 1972, Oliva challenged Schwarzenegger again for the year&#x27;s Olympia in Essen, West Germany. However, he again placed second behind Schwarzenegger.

In 1985, Oliva returned for a final attempt at the Mr. Olympia title. He finished this year in 8th place - repeating his position from the previous year.

==Personal life==
* Oliva was a police officer in Chicago from 1976 to 2003.
* In 1986, Sergio survived being shot by his then-wife Arleen Garrett. He sustained 5 bullet wounds to his abdomen from a .38 Special.
* His son, Sergio Oliva Jr., is an IFBB Pro bodybuilder who won the 2015 NPC Nationals bodybuilding competition, and who has since competed on Mr. Olympia, Arnold Classic, and New York Pro stages.

==Death==
Sergio Oliva died on November 12, 2012, in Chicago, Illinois, from apparent kidney failure.

<text>Sir Cyril Richard Smith (28 June 1928 – 3 September 2010) was a British Liberal Party and Liberal Democrat politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Rochdale from 1972 to 1992.

Smith was first active in local politics as a Liberal in 1945 before switching to Labour in 1950; he served as a Labour councillor in Rochdale, Lancashire, from 1950 and became mayor in 1966. He subsequently switched parties again and entered Parliament as a Liberal in 1972, winning his Rochdale seat on five further occasions. Smith was appointed the Liberal Chief Whip in June 1975 but later resigned on health grounds. In his later years as an MP, Smith opposed an alliance with the Social Democratic Party and did not stand for re-election in 1992; however, he remained loyal to the Liberal Democrats upon the parties&#x27; merger. Throughout much of his career, he maintained a high profile in the media and became a well-known public figure.

In later years, Smith&#x27;s public esteem was considerably marred by the allegation that he had been involved in a cover-up of a health risk at a local asbestos factory. In 2008, there were calls for Smith to be stripped of his knighthood after it was revealed that he had asked the asbestos company Turner &amp; Newall to prepare a speech for him in 1981 in which he declared that &quot;the public at large are not at risk from asbestos&quot;. It was later revealed that Smith owned 1,300 shares in the company. In 2008, Smith said that 4,000 asbestos-related deaths a year in the UK was &quot;relatively low&quot;.

As early as 1979, a local underground magazine, the &quot;Rochdale Alternative Press&quot;, alleged that in the 1960s Smith had spanked and sexually abused teenage boys in a hostel he co-founded. The story was repeated by the magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;. After his death, the allegations were denied by his family. The Press Office of the leader of the Liberal Party, David Steel, commented at the time, &quot;All he seems to have done is spanked a few bare bottoms&quot;. After his death, formal allegations of child sexual abuse were made against him, leading authorities to conclude that he was a prolific sex offender.

In 2012, after his death and following allegations of child sexual abuse, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) formally admitted that Smith should have been charged with such abuse during his lifetime. In November 2012, Greater Manchester Police Assistant Chief Constable Steve Heywood said there was &quot;overwhelming evidence&quot; that young boys were sexually and physically abused by Smith.

In April 2014, it was reported that there had been 144 complaints against Smith from victims as young as eight years of age. Attempts to prosecute Smith had been blocked. Public authorities including Rochdale Borough Council, the police, and British intelligence services have been implicated in covering up Smith&#x27;s alleged crimes. In 2015, it emerged that Smith had been arrested in the early 1980s in relation to some of these offences; however, a high-level cover-up reportedly led to destruction of evidence, Smith&#x27;s rapid release within hours, and the invocation of the Official Secrets Act to prevent the investigating officers from discussing the matter. In February 2017, Greater Manchester Police reported that their investigation into historical child sex abuse at the former Knowl View School in Rochdale, requested by the Home Office in 2014, had found no evidence of a cover-up or corruption. 

==Early years==
Cyril Smith was born in Rochdale, Lancashire, a mill town near Manchester that is known as the birthplace of the co-operative movement. Smith described himself as &quot;illegitimate, deprived and poor&quot;. Though he never knew the name of his father, he commented, &quot;I suspect I know who he was.&quot; Smith lived with his mother Eva, grandmother and two half-siblings, Eunice and Norman, in a one-up one-down cottage (demolished in 1945) on Falinge Road. Eva Smith, was a domestic worker for a local cotton mill–owning family.

Smith was educated at Rochdale Grammar School for Boys. After leaving school, he began work at the Rochdale Inland Revenue Tax Office. In the 1945 general election, aged 16, he gave a public speech in support of Liberal candidate Charles Harvey. Smith said he was given an ultimatum by his manager in the tax office to either choose the civil service or politics. He left his job at the tax office and then worked as an office boy at Fothergill &amp; Harvey&#x27;s mill in Littleborough. The mill was owned by the Harveys, a notable Liberal family, but Smith claimed the director Charles Harvey knew nothing of his job application.

Smith was a lifelong member of the Rochdale Unitarian Church. Contemporaries remembered him expressing, as a teenager, the desire to be both mayor and Member of Parliament (MP). Smith served in many roles, including as Sunday School superintendent, trustee, and chair of the trustees. His Unitarian faith intersected with his Liberal politics. Smith credited the church with &quot;helping develop his fiercely independent and anti-establishment streak&quot;.

==Political career==

===Early career===
Smith joined the Liberal Party in 1945 and was a member of the National Executive Committee of the Young Liberals in 1948 and 1949. From 1948 to 1950, he was Liberal agent in Stockport, but after the party suffered poor election results in 1950 and 1951, he was advised by the losing Liberal candidate for Stockport, Reg Hewitt, to join the Labour Party.

In 1952, Smith was elected a Labour councillor for the Falinge ward of Rochdale. By 1954, he was chairman of Rochdale Council&#x27;s Establishment Committee. In 1963 Smith switched committee roles to be responsible for Estates which included overseeing residential and town centre development. He was appointed the Labour Mayor of Rochdale in 1966, with his mother, Eva, acting as mayoress (she retained her job as a cleaner in Rochdale Town Hall whilst in the post). In her work as a cleaner at the town hall, Smith&#x27;s mother was banned from entering the police station – likewise based in the building – because she would search through its bins for information to help her son.

Smith&#x27;s mayoral duties were filmed for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Man Alive&quot; documentary series, in an episode titled &quot;Santa Claus for a Year&quot;. In 1966 he was appointed chairman of the Education Committee overseeing the introduction of comprehensive education in the district. In the same year he was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours. According to his autobiography, Smith was found guilty of an offence relating to public lotteries and bound over to keep the peace for twelve months.

In 1966, Smith resigned the Labour whip when the party refused to vote for an increase in council house rents and sat with four other councillors as independents until 1970. His subsequent return to the Liberal Party, and his election as a Liberal MP, caused surprise after his role in opposing Ludovic Kennedy, the Liberal candidate in the 1958 Rochdale by-election. Controversy was sparked by Rochdale Liberals when the parliamentary candidate, Garth Pratt, was deselected to make way for Smith&#x27;s return to the party.

During the 1960s Smith was active on many Rochdale Council committees regarding youth activities. These included: Rochdale Youth Orchestra, Rochdale Youth Theatre Workshop, governorship of 29 Rochdale schools and chairmanship of the Youth Committee, Youth Employment Committee and the Education Committee.

===Member of Parliament===
Having been Liberal candidate in Rochdale at the 1970 general election when he took the party to second place, Smith won the seat at the 1972 by-election with a large swing from Labour to the Liberals, and a majority of 5,171.

Smith was appointed as the party Chief Whip in June 1975, and faced pressure from the press in the wake of a scandal involving party leader Jeremy Thorpe. Smith was in hospital when Thorpe sacked him, just before he himself was forced to resign. Speaking to Granada Television in 2003, David Steel reflected on events in the 1970s with the conclusion: &quot;Cyril was not an ideal Chief Whip because he did not handle a crisis well and had a tendency to say anything to a news camera.&quot; Smith was the only Liberal MP during his parliamentary career to advocate the return of the death penalty. One of his constituents was jailed for sixteen years for the sexual murder of a child, in what turned out to be a miscarriage of justice. The man&#x27;s mother repeatedly approached Smith for help, but he declined to take the case on.

In 1978, Smith approached former Conservative Prime Minister Ted Heath to discuss forming a new centrist party. In 1980, Smith described UK unemployment figures of two million jobless people as &quot;a disgrace&quot;, stating: &quot;They represent a sick society, and are not acceptable to live with.&quot; In 1981, he was involved in moves to create &quot;a party with a new image&quot; but, according to the &quot;Rochdale Observer&quot;, at the foundation of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in 1981 he warned Liberal colleagues to move with caution. Smith was quoted as being &quot;opposed to an alliance at any price&quot;. He would later express the view that the Liberal Party would have been &quot;better off&quot; without being &quot;shackled to the SDP&quot;. After David Alton&#x27;s 1988 bill to reduce the time limit for abortions was talked out by MPs, he referred to other members as &quot;murderers in the womb&quot;. The speaker of the House of Commons forced Smith to apologise for the comment.

===Asbestos===
In 2008, the &quot;New Statesman&quot; accused Smith of improper conduct in his connection with the company Turner &amp; Newall (T&amp;N), which was based in his constituency, and was once the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of materials using asbestos. In the summer recess of 1981, Smith wrote to Sydney Marks, head of personnel at T&amp;N, informing him that EEC regulations were coming up for debate in the next parliamentary session. A House of Commons speech Smith delivered was almost identical to one prepared for him by the company. He said &quot;the public at large are not at risk from asbestos&quot; in his speech about a substance then long-known to be lethal if inhaled. A year later he revealed he owned 1,300 shares in T&amp;N. Interviewed in September 2008 by a local BBC news programme, Smith responded to the claims he had helped cover up the dangers of asbestos as &quot;absolute rubbish&quot;. After his death, he was described by journalist Oliver Kamm in his blog in &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;a corrupt, mendacious mountain of flesh&quot;.

The controversy led, in November 2008, to a parliamentary early day motion that Smith be stripped of the knighthood he had been granted in 1988. Kevin Maguire of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; supported the idea.

==Later years==
After leaving Westminster and the death of his mother Eva in 1994, Smith was invited by a lifelong friend, a public relations manager at the Cunard Line, to become a guest lecturer on the cruise liner &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;. Smith liked to spend his holidays at Lytham St Annes, a seaside resort near Blackpool.

In February 2006, Smith was taken to hospital after collapsing at his Rochdale home. He had been weakened by dehydration and low potassium levels.

Smith died of cancer in a Rochdale nursing home on 3 September 2010. He had made detailed plans for his own funeral, which was held in the Great Hall of Rochdale Town Hall and included David Alton, the MEP Chris Davies, and former MP Paul Rowen as speakers. Of all the many tributes, the then-current leader of Rochdale Council summed him up: &quot;He simply was politics for Rochdale.&quot; The service was led by the minister of his local Unitarian church, of which he had been a lifelong member.

Smith&#x27;s younger brother Norman followed him into local politics, as councillor, mayor, and president of the local Liberal Democrat chapter.

==Popular image==
Smith&#x27;s large size and capacity for blunt speaking and popular touch made him one of the most recognisable British politicians of the 1970s and 1980s. His nickname, &quot;Big Cyril&quot;, was the title of his autobiography. Smith made many popular television appearances: he sang &quot;She&#x27;s a Lassie from Lancashire&quot; on his friend Jimmy Savile&#x27;s early-1970s TV show &quot;Clunk Click&quot;, appeared in an advert for a &quot;greatest hits&quot; album by 1980s pop group Bananarama, and sang a duet with Don Estelle in a 1999 recording of the Laurel and Hardy song &quot;The Trail of the Lonesome Pine&quot;. Like several other prominent British MPs in the 1980s, he was regularly parodied in the satirical television show &quot;Spitting Image&quot;.

Smith is believed to have been the heaviest British MP ever: at 6&#x27; 2&quot; (188 cm), he was reported to weigh 29 stone 12 pounds (about 190 kilogrammes or 418 pounds). A common joke on the size of the Parliamentary Liberal Party in the early 1970s was that only one taxi would be needed to transport the entire party; after Smith&#x27;s election, the party could fill two taxis.

A lifelong bachelor, Smith told &quot;You&quot; magazine: &quot;I haven&#x27;t had a lot of time for courting women ... I&#x27;ve tended to be married to politics&quot;. Smith was a friend of the mother of broadcasters Andy and Liz Kershaw; she described him as dependent on Valium, but he denied these allegations.

==Allegations of child sexual abuse==

===Early allegations===
In May 1979, a local underground magazine, the &quot;Rochdale Alternative Press&quot;, alleged that in the 1960s Smith had spanked and sexually abused teenage boys in a hostel he co-founded. The matter was investigated by the police, but Smith was not prosecuted. The story was repeated in the same month by the magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;. Smith never publicly denied the accusations of abuse or took legal action in response to those accusations. After his death, the allegations were denied by his family. The Press Office of the leader of the Liberal Party, David Steel, commented at the time, &quot;All he seems to have done is spanked a few bare bottoms&quot;.

===2012===
In November 2012, speaking in the House of Commons, Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP for Rochdale, Smith&#x27;s former seat, called for an inquiry into alleged acts of abuse by Smith.

Rossendale councillor Alan Neal alleged that at the age of eleven in 1964, during Smith&#x27;s membership of the Labour Party, he was beaten by Smith at a hostel for boys. Neal said: &quot;I&#x27;m speaking now because someone has taken a right decision to raise this issue with the authorities&quot;. He added that he told police about the incident in 1968 when he left the school, but that when he did so, &quot;everyone made the same comment that the person in question was a very important, powerful man&quot;. Neal said that he lost two front teeth and needed stitches to a head wound after Smith assaulted him for refusing to eat a potted meat sandwich.

Another alleged victim of abuse by Smith waived his right to anonymity in November 2012 to claim that Smith smacked him and stroked his buttocks when he was a teenager at a Rochdale care home in the 1960s. Barry Fitton said he was spanked &quot;very, very hard&quot; by Smith and that he was left in tears by the alleged incident.

On 21 November 2012, Greater Manchester Police announced it would investigate allegations that Smith had sexually abused boys at a hostel in Rochdale after 1974, and Lancashire Police would investigate claims dating from before 1974. The police said it would look at whether investigations had taken place into Smith during the 1980s and 1990s.

On 27 November 2012, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said that Smith should have been charged with crimes of abuse more than 40 years earlier. In a statement, Greater Manchester Police said Smith had committed &quot;physical and sexual abuse&quot;. Smith was never charged, although investigations were undertaken in 1970, 1998, and 1999. The method of assessing the probability of a conviction has changed since 1970, and the decision not to charge Smith then necessitated the outcome of the 1998 investigation. Following the sexual abuse allegations, Rochdale Council removed a blue plaque to Smith from the town hall. Greater Manchester Police Assistant Chief Constable Steve Heywood said: &quot;Although Smith cannot be charged or convicted posthumously, from the overwhelming evidence we have it is right and proper we should publicly recognise that young boys were sexually and physically abused&quot;.

On 28 November 2012, an alleged victim waived his right to anonymity in a television interview with Sky News to say that he was sexually abused by Smith at a council-run residential special school. Chris Marshall broke down in tears during his interview when describing the sexual abuse he said took place at Knowl View school in Rochdale in the early 1980s. He said that as a nine-year-old boy he was taken to a room and made to perform oral sex on Smith and one other man. Smith was a governor at the school and allegedly had his own set of keys. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said: &quot;I am deeply shocked and horrified by these terrible allegations and my thoughts are with the victims who had the courage to speak out&quot;.

In November 2012, Tony Robinson, a former Special Branch officer with Lancashire Police in the 1970s, said that a dossier of sexual abuse allegations against Smith which police claimed was &quot;lost&quot; was actually seized by MI5. Robinson said that he was asked by MI5 to send to London a police dossier that had been kept in a safe in his office which he said was &quot;thick&quot; with allegations from boys claiming they had been abused by Smith.

In December 2012, Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk alleged that Smith raped some of his victims. Danczuk said: &quot;There is no doubt that Cyril Smith seriously sexually abused young boys: why the CPS didn&#x27;t prosecute more recently is puzzling&quot;.

Following claims by MP Tom Watson of &quot;a powerful paedophile network linked to Parliament and No 10&quot;, it was reported that Scotland Yard detectives investigating allegations of child abuse at the Elm Guest House were looking into allegations that senior politicians abused children in the 1980s and escaped justice.

===2013===
In January 2013, &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; reported that police were investigating claims that Smith sexually abused boys at the London guest house. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police later said: &quot;We can confirm Cyril Smith visited the premises.&quot; A 16-year-old boy was allegedly sexually abused by Smith at Elm Guest House. MP Simon Danczuk said he was convinced that there was a &quot;network of paedophiles&quot; operating in the House of Commons who helped to protect Smith.

In September 2013, a Channel 4 &quot;Dispatches&quot; programme &quot;The Paedophile MP: How Cyril Smith Got Away With It&quot; quoted CPS as claiming that they had not prosecuted Smith for crimes of abuse because he had been given an assurance in 1970 that he would not be prosecuted, and that prevented them from subsequently reopening the investigation under the law at the time. Political journalist Francis Wheen said that he found this explanation incomprehensible.

===2014===
Danczuk, with researcher and campaigner Matthew Baker, published &quot;Smile for the Camera: The Double Life of Cyril Smith&quot;, an exposé of the child abuse committed by Smith. Danczuk alleged that Smith was part of a high-level paedophile ring and that Smith had used his influence to escape prosecution. Danczuk said: &quot;Once you looked beyond the jolly clown playing for the camera, there was a sickening, dark heart. This wasn&#x27;t just about abuse, it was about power – and a cover-up that reached from Rochdale all the way to the very top of the Establishment.&quot; Danczuk said that in the 1980s police discovered child pornography belonging to Smith, but he escaped justice. Danczuk described Smith as &quot;a predatory paedophile and a prolific offender who would target the most vulnerable boys.&quot; He said: &quot;A lot of manpower went into investigating Smith over the years, but the only thing he was ever convicted for was mis-selling a lottery ticket.&quot;

In 2014, David Steel, the former Liberal leader, said he had confronted Smith about his &quot;unusual&quot; behaviour with boys at a hostel in Rochdale. Following allegations published in 1979, Steel said that Smith confessed to spanking boys and conducting intimate &quot;medical examinations&quot; on them but was allowed to remain as a Liberal MP. Steel said: &quot;I asked Cyril Smith about it. I was half expecting him to say it was all wrong, and I would have been urging him to sue to save his reputation. To my surprise he said the report was correct.&quot; Steel said that Smith had a supervisory role in institutions in Rochdale where he was involved in corporal punishment. Steel said of the abuse allegations: &quot;They had been investigated by the police, as &quot;Private Eye&quot; stated, and no action had been taken on them. So there was nothing more I could do.&quot;

In April 2014, following reports that there had been 144 complaints against Smith and that attempts to prosecute him had always been blocked, the President of the Liberal Democrats, Tim Farron, said that his party needed to answer &quot;serious questions&quot; about who knew that Smith had faced allegations of sexual assault. However, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg refused to hold an inquiry into what he called the &quot;repugnant&quot; actions of Smith. Clegg said: &quot;My party, the Liberal Democrats, did not know about these actions.&quot; Clegg stated that the child abuse allegations were a matter for the police.

In May 2014, it was alleged that Smith had molested an 11-year-old boy at the National Liberal Club in London in 1978. Smith allegedly insisted that the boy remove his underpants before attempting to fondle him. A spokesman for the Liberal Democrats said: &quot;Cyril Smith&#x27;s acts were vile and repugnant and we have nothing but sympathy for those whose lives he ruined.&quot;

In June 2014, Detective Chief Superintendent Russ Jackson of Greater Manchester Police admitted the force&#x27;s previous investigations into abuse linked to Smith at Rochdale Knowl View residential school &quot;fell well short&quot; of what would be expected today. Allegations were made that a paedophile ring had been operating for decades in the town of Rochdale and that men from as far away as Sheffield were travelling to Rochdale to have sex with Knowl View boys aged between eight and thirteen. Greater Manchester Police said there were 21 suspects, 14 of whom it had identified, including Smith. In July 2014, Rochdale council&#x27;s inquiry into child abuse linked to Smith at Knowl View residential school was halted at the request of police. Greater Manchester Police asked the authority to suspend their inquiry while detectives investigated claims of an institutional cover-up. The investigation found no evidence of a cover-up.

In July 2014, it was reported that Smith had put pressure on the BBC in 1976 by asking the corporation not to investigate the &quot;private lives of certain MPs&quot;. According to letters in the National Archives, Smith wrote to BBC Director-General Sir Charles Curran in September 1976 saying he was &quot;deeply concerned about the investigative activities of the BBC&quot;, especially relating to &quot;the private lives of certain MPs&quot;. Former children&#x27;s minister Tim Loughton described Smith&#x27;s letters as &quot;bully-boy tactics&quot;. Loughton said: &quot;It was an abuse of position that somebody as an MP was saying, &#x27;You shouldn&#x27;t look at us, we&#x27;re above the law.&#x27;&quot;

A report released by the CPS in July 2014 showed that in 1970 a police detective investigating Smith presented evidence to his superior of Smith&#x27;s abuse of young boys at a care home in Rochdale, but no action was taken.

===2015===
In March 2015, Cabinet Office papers were released confirming that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was made aware of allegations against Smith before he was knighted in 1988, although she gave him the &quot;benefit of the doubt&quot; because the Director of Public Prosecutions had previously investigated him and had decided not to prosecute him due to lack of evidence. Shortly after, a BBC investigation on &quot;Newsnight&quot; revealed that Smith had been arrested in the early 1980s in relation to his participation in a paedophile ring, but a high-level cover-up reportedly led to him being released within hours, the evidence destroyed and the investigating officers prevented from discussing the matter under the Official Secrets Act. Theresa May, the Home Secretary, called for immunity for whistle-blowers in the case. Reports also emerged of Smith&#x27;s arrest by Northamptonshire Police, where he was again released in mysterious circumstances.

In 2015, a retired police officer said that he was threatened with the Official Secrets Act after he found Smith in the home of a known sex offender with two drunk teenage boys and a police sergeant in civilian clothes. The retired officer said that he was summoned to a meeting with a senior officer at Stockport Police Station and told &quot;in no uncertain terms&quot; not to say anything about it. The alleged incident took place in 1988 at a house in Stockport after a complaint that the occupant had committed a lewd act in his window in front of a newspaper boy.

<text>The Brunswick rifle was a large calibre () muzzle-loading percussion rifle manufactured for the British Army at the Royal Small Arms Factory at Enfield in the early 19th century. Its name is derived from the historical German state of Brunswick because the British were experimenting with Hanoverian percussion cap technology during the period Great Britain and Hanover (1714–1837) had the same head of state.

==History==

The Brunswick rifle was one of several designs submitted to replace the Baker rifle. Unlike the Baker rifle, the Brunswick rifle used a special round ball with raised ribs that fit into two spiraling grooves in the barrel.

During its evaluation, it was noted that the Brunswick&#x27;s unique round meant the Brunswick rifle could not fire the standard British paper cartridges in use at the time. The rifle was also noted as being very heavy, and fired a relatively low velocity round. Despite these detriments, the rifle performed much better than expected, and the Master-General of Ordnance ordered it to be produced with a barrel of caliber. The new rifle was designed to accept a bayonet, though the design was changed with the mounting moved further back since experience had shown that the Baker rifle could not be fired with its bayonet fixed.

In December 1836, trials were conducted to compare the Brunswick rifle against the Baker rifle. The Brunswick rifle proved to be equally accurate at shorter ranges, and more accurate at longer ranges. The Brunswick rifle also proved to require less cleaning than the Baker rifle. Evaluators also noted that the simplified two groove design of the Brunswick was likely to have a longer service life than the barrel of the Baker, and the Brunswick rifle was said to be very rugged overall. In January 1837, the rifle was approved for production.

Almost immediately, the caliber was changed from to under a new program of standardization. An altered pattern was submitted in August 1837, and the first bulk order of 1000 rifles was given on 25 October 1837. In January the following year, it became apparent that 600 of these would be required urgently for Col. Brown&#x27;s Battalion of the Rifle Brigade and the Enfield factory would not be able to supply them in time. Thus the whole order was put out to the trade in London at a charge of 38s per rifle. The first Brunswick rifles were made by the following gunmakers:

* Tomas Potts, 212;
* Wm. Heptinstall, 55;
* Barnett &amp; Co., 212;
* Reynolds &amp; Son, 55;
* Lacy &amp; Reynolds, 210;
* Yeoman&#x27;s &amp; Son, 55;
* E. J. Baker, 146;
* Thomas Leigh, 55;
* William Parker, 80;
* W. Mills &amp; Son, 55;
* R. E. Pritchett, 80;
* W. T. Bond, 55;
* Thomas Ashton, 80.

Production began in March 1838, and the first mass-produced rifles were issued to the Rifle Brigade, the Canadian Rifle Regiment, and a few specialized units in 1840.

The Brunswick rifle developed a reputation for being difficult to load, but was fairly well received and remained in production for almost 50 years. The rifle was used in England and assorted colonies and outposts throughout the world. Several refinements were made to the design during its production life, and production of the rifle was finally discontinued in 1885.

The Brunswick was also manufactured in Belgium. Limited numbers of Brunswick rifles were imported to the United States during the Civil War. Some of those ended up in the hands of units such as the 26th Louisiana Infantry, which was partly equipped with Brunswicks during the Siege of Vicksburg.

==Design and features==
The Brunswick had a two groove barrel designed to accept a &quot;belted&quot; round ball. Like all rifles of the period, the Brunswick rifle suffered from the problem of being difficult to load. Rounds for rifles were required to fit tightly into the barrel so that the round would grip the rifling as it traveled down the barrel, imparting a spin to the round and improving its stability. Even though the rib and groove design of the Brunswick allowed it to use rounds that did not fit quite as tightly, the black powder utilized during this period would quickly foul the barrel, making even the Brunswick&#x27;s design more and more difficult to load as the rifle was used.

Since the Brunswick used a round that was specifically designed to be mated with the grooves in the rifle, it had to be oriented properly in order to be loaded. This made the rifle difficult to load at night, when the grooves could not be seen.

The lock was originally a back action design, with the mainspring located behind the hammer. This design proved to be unpopular because it weakened the wrist of the stock. Later Brunswick rifles featured a more conventional side action lock.

The stock was made of walnut, and featured a straight wrist and a low comb butt. A patch box with a hinged brass lid was located on the right side of the butt. Originally, the Brunswick rifle used a single compartment patch box. Later rifles used a slightly larger patch box with two compartments.

The ramrod pipes, trigger guard, and butt plate were all made of polished brass.

The rifle was designed to accept a sword type bayonet which mounted by use of a bayonet bar, similar to the design of that used on the Baker rifle. The bayonet bar was relocated further back due to problems that had been experienced with the Baker rifle.

The Brunswick rifle used a block front sight and a two position folding leaf rear sight which could be set for either .

The rifle weighed approximately (depending on the pattern) without the bayonet attached.

==Variants==

The Pattern 1836 featured the original back action lock and the single compartment patch box. The first of these were caliber. This was changed fairly early in the rifle&#x27;s life, and most were caliber. All subsequent patterns were caliber.

The Pattern 1840 featured a dual compartment patch box, and had several minor improvements to the Pattern 1836.

The Pattern 1841 replaced the back action lock with a side lock. However, this lock change was not put into manufacturing until 1845. This version also used a wrought iron barrel instead of twisted steel, and a simple plug that replaced the break-off breech plug used in earlier patterns.

The Pattern 1848 featured other minor improvements, and used an improved bayonet latch with the locking notch located halfway along the bayonet bar on its upper side. Only a few batches of rifles produced for the British Army were fitted with this improvement.

A heavier version in caliber was produced for the Royal Navy.

Copies of the Brunswick rifle were made in Nepal, from approximately 1840 to 1860. These copies were apparently hand made, and as such their details varied slightly. There were two distinct versions, a &quot;light&quot; pattern that weighed approximately , and a more similar version to the standard Brunswick rifle that weighed over . It is estimated that approximately 10,000 to 12,000 of these were made in Nepal.

<doc id="405061" wikidata="Q1423300" url="?curid=405061" title="Irrlicht Engine">
<text>Irrlicht (pronounced in German) is an open-source game engine written in C++. It is cross-platform, officially running on Windows, macOS, Linux and Windows CE and due to its open nature ports to other systems are available, including FreeBSD, Xbox (up to Irrlicht version 1.8.1), PlayStation Portable, Symbian, iPhone, AmigaOS 4, Sailfish OS via a Qt/QML wrapper, and Google Native Client.

Irrlicht is known for its small size and compatibility with new and older hardware alike, ease of learning, and a large friendly community. Unofficial bindings for many languages exist including AutoIt, C++Builder, FreeBASIC, GameMaker Language, Java, Lua, .NET, Object Pascal (Delphi), Perl, Python, and Ruby, though most of them have not been maintained for five years or more.

Irrlicht&#x27;s development began in 2003 with one developer, Nikolaus Gebhardt. Only after the 1.0 release of Irrlicht in 2006 did the team grow to ten members as of 2011, most of them being developers.

Irrlicht is a common German term for a will-o&#x27;-the-wisp.

==Features==
Irrlicht supports 3D rendering via OpenGL, DirectX 8, 9 and internal software rasterizers. DirectX 8 is not supported after 1.8.1, effectively ending support for Xbox. External renderers and windowing systems plug in through simple interfaces, giving rise to a community-made Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) video driver and support for iPhone and Symbian devices. The engine comes with a library of standard material renderers, allowing fallback materials where user hardware is unable to handle advanced methods. New materials can be added to the engine at run-time, allowing users to write their own as needed. In addition to legacy fixed-function pipeline materials, programmable Pixel and Vertex Shaders (1.1 to 3.0 and 4.0 using GLSL), ARB Fragment and Vertex Programs, HLSL, Cg and GLSL materials are supported.

Irrlicht supports many file formats. It will load and display 3ds Max files, Quake 2 MD2 Models, Wavefront .obj objects, Quake 3 .bsp maps, Milkshape3D objects, and DirectX .x files. Additional format loaders have been written as external plugins. Lights, cameras and 3D objects are managed as a tree of &quot;Scene Nodes&quot;, arbitrary groupable entities linked together in a scene graph. These nodes are responsible for their own behaviour, but can also be managed by animators, each other, or manually by users.

Many built-in node types exist and can be used together to make complex indoor and outdoor scenes. New nodes are trivial to make and can be added at runtime; many additional node types are available from the community. Node types packaged with Irrlicht include a terrain renderer and sky domes-boxes for outdoor rendering, binary space partitioning (BSP) for indoor rendering, bone based animated meshes, stencil shadows, billboards and particle systems, water surfaces and primitives.

A skinnable 2D graphical user interface (GUI) is available, supporting many controls and the ability for users to plug in their own (or community made) custom widgets at runtime. Irrlicht&#x27;s internal event system provides mouse, keyboard, joystick and GUI events without having to rely on additional libraries.

Filesystem access is abstracted allowing platform-independent file and folder access, and transparent access to files within ZIP archives. Other I/O features include an XML reader and writer, the ability to take screenshots, manipulate images and meshes and then save them in several different file formats.

Irrlicht provides support for simple collision detection including mouse picking, but users are advised that this is not intended as a replacement for a full featured physics engine.

==Engine extensions==
Irrlicht was designed to be able to load and save the current scene to an XML file; this combined with the engine&#x27;s open-source licensing model has attracted various programmers and developers to create world editors for Irrlicht to simplify the world-creation process. One such example is the irrEdit world editor, developed by Nikolaus Gebhardt and other members of the company Ambiera. IrrEdit contains a radiosity lightmap generator and a scripting interface using Squirrel scripts.

Since Irrlicht does not support sound by itself, Ambiera has also developed irrKlang, a non-free, proprietary audio library with an API similar to Irrlicht. Being developed by the same group, irrEdit supports the use of sounds in levels made by irrEdit for use with irrKlang-enabled compiled DLLs. Also, among Ambiera&#x27;s creations is irrXML, Irrlicht&#x27;s XML parser.

Many physics libraries have had plugins and wrappers written for Irrlicht, including Nvidia PhysX, Bullet, and Open Dynamics Engine.

More extensions can be found in the Irrlicht forums and in the irrExt project, a side-project of Irrlicht for special purpose add-ons.

There are also some new technologies in forums such as Deferred shading or Shadow mapping. Many users contribute extensions such as Compute Shaders (OpenGL 4.3) and Tessellation Shaders (Shader Model 5.0).

<doc id="405062" wikidata="Q829980" url="?curid=405062" title="Boreogadus">
<text>Boreogadus saida, known as the polar cod or as the Arctic cod, is a fish of the cod family Gadidae, related to the true cod (genus &quot;Gadus&quot;). Another fish species for which both the common names Arctic cod and polar cod are used is &quot;Arctogadus glacialis&quot;.

== Description ==
Arctic cod have slender bodies, deeply forked tails, a projecting mouth, and a small chin barbel. They have three dorsal fins and two anal fins, which are all separate from each other. The caudal fin is concave, the pectoral fins reach beyond the end of the first dorsal fin, and the pelvic fins are elongated rays. The lateral line is interrupted along the entire length of the fish.

They are plainly coloured with brownish spots and a silvery body. Greenlandic Inuit fishers have described two morphotypes of Arctic cod, a lighter-colored variety and a darker-colored variety.

Arctic cod are frequently misidentified as polar cod (Arctogadus glacialis) during their larval and early juvenile stages. The species can be differentiated through the analysis of otoliths or molecular data.

Arctic cod grow to an average length of 25 cm (9.8 in), and a maximum length of .

== Geographical distribution ==

This species is found further north than any other fish (beyond 84°N) with a circumpolar distribution spanning the entire North Polar Basin above Russia, Alaska, Canada, and Greenland. More specifically, in the Arctic Ocean, Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, Hudson Bay, Baffin Bay, Greenland Sea, Barents Sea, Kara Sea, Laptev Sea and the Eastern Siberian Sea. Arctic cod occur in almost all Arctic and Subarctic marine habitats, ranging from coastal waters, the mesopelagic zone, the deeper central Arctic Ocean, and under ice. Arctic cod are the most abundant demersal Arctic species in the Beaufort Sea.

Arctic cod exhibit diel vertical migration patterns during winter and spring, but migration is not observed during summer.

== Habitat ==
Early life stages of Arctic cod are found near the surface in both ice-covered and open water; however, adults are found deeper in the water column. In the Canadian Arctic, Arctic cod will separate vertically in the water column by size, with younger fish in the upper 100 meters of the water column, and juvenile and immature fish below 200 meters.

Arctic cod can also be found in dense schools near glacial fronts and polynyas. Subsurface plumes of freshwater discharged from glaciers create foraging hotspots, aggregating zooplankton where they are stunned or killed by osmotic shock, making them easy prey for Arctic cod. Greenlandic Inuit fishers have reported the presence of Arctic cod near the Sermilik and Sermeq Avannarleq glaciers, located off the southwestern coast of Greenland.

== Adaptations to Arctic waters ==

Arctic cod have several adaptations that allow them to function in freezing polar waters where most other species could not. These waters, though incredibly cold, have a lower freezing point due to their high salt content. While Arctic cod do have higher salt concentrations in their bodies compared to fish in warmer waters, this only accounts for half of the decrease in the cod&#x27;s freezing point. The key adaptation that allow for a decrease in their freezing point lies in their blood: specifically, high molecular mass antifreeze glycoproteins. These special proteins decrease the freezing point of ice, preventing the formation of ice crystals in the blood. This mechanism allows Arctic cod to thrive in freezing waters.

Antifreeze glycoproteins first occurred about 5 to 15 million years ago, coinciding with the freezing of the Antarctic Ocean. Arctic cod have antifreeze glycoprotein genes that are similar to other notothenioid Antarctic fish, however, the protein-coding sequences are not identical. This suggests that the ability to produce antifreeze glycoproteins evolved independently in both fish, showing convergent evolution due to similar cold environments. How exactly these proteins prevent ice formation remains unknown.

Arctic cod have unique kidneys that lack glomeruli, structures found in most organisms that filter out toxins from the blood. This adaptation, shared with Antarctic notothenioid fish, help the cod retain vital antifreeze glycoproteins in their blood. It also prevents the fish from experiencing osmotic stress, as the high salt content of the Arctic Oceans draws water out of their bodies.

== Keystone species in the Arctic ==

Arctic cod are a keystone species in Arctic marine food webs. Because Arctic cod have high lipid concentrations relative to their size, predators in the Arctic rely on this species as their main food source. Arctic cod funnel more than 70% of the energy from zooplankton to higher trophic levels and are the most energy-rich prey species in the Arctic.

Arctic cod are locally dominant prey for Atlantic cod, Arctic char, and Greenland halibut. They are also prey for seabirds, specifically the thick-billed murre, black guillemot, common murre, northern fulmar, black-legged kittiwake, ivory gull, and glaucous gull. Arctic cod are the primary food source for species endemic to the Arctic, namely narwhals, belugas, ringed seals, and harp seals.

== Diet ==
Arctic cod are generalists that feed on plankton and krill, more specifically hyperiid amphipods, gammarid amphipods, and copepods. Diet varies based on size, region, and locality. Arctic cod larvae feed on eggs, nauplii, and copepods. Larger Arctic cod engage in piscivory. When their preferred prey is scarce, Arctic cod are adaptable and will switch to any other available prey.

Because Arctic winters have low primary production rates, Arctic cod accumulate energy reserves rapidly during the late summer to prepare for the overwintering period. To withstand short summer growing seasons, Arctic cod juveniles enter winter with higher lipid concentrations compared to boreal species.

== Reproduction and life stages ==
Arctic cod have multiple reproductive cycles throughout their lives. Arctic cod are an r-selected species, meaning they reach maturity early and produce high numbers of offspring. On average, a female will lay between 9,000 and 21,000 eggs. Spawning occurs between September and April, and peaks between January and February. Spawning locations are not fully known, but spawning is suggested to occur in the Barents Sea to the southwest of the Svalbard Island chain, and the Kara and Pechora seas. In the Canadian Arctic, spawning is suggested to occur near the Franklin and Darney bays. In the Pacific Arctic, spawning is suggested to occur in the northern Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, and Kotzebue Sound. Greenlandic Inuit fishers have noted a spawning area near Saattut Island.

The development and viability of Arctic cod eggs depend heavily on temperature. Eggs develop normally between -1.5 °C and 3 °C; however, hatching success severely declines above 2 °C. Incubation time decreases as temperatures increase: at 1.5 °C, it will take 79 days for larvae to hatch, but at 3.8 °C, incubation time decreases to 29 days. In the Canadian Arctic, Arctic cod hatch under the ice from January to July and remain under the ice until fall. 

Arctic cod larvae can be between 3.5mm and 7mm after hatching; however, in experimental settings, length after hatching decreases when temperatures increase. The larvae have a higher temperature tolerance range than the eggs. Larvae are euryhaline, meaning that they can withstand different salinity concentrations. Therefore, they can be found in areas with glacial meltwater, in river mouths, or in ice-covered areas. The larger the larvae is, the higher the chance of survival it has, especially during the transition between yolk feeding to exogenous feeding.

Juvenile Arctic cod have a much larger temperature tolerance range than larvae and eggs, tolerating temperatures from 0 °C to 12 °C. Arctic cod exhibit isometric growth, but allometric fat storage. Juvenile Arctic cod are found in the pelagic zone of the water column and descend deeper after their first summer. Some juveniles are found within cavities in sea ice. It is hypothesized that juveniles that have hatched late remain sympagic to avoid predation from adult Arctic cod and competition from other juvenile Arctic cod. Arctic cod reach sexual maturity at around age 2 to 3.

Adult Arctic cod can tolerate temperatures up to 13.5 °C and function best between 3 °C and 10 °C. Adults are found deeper than 100 meters in the water column and are not associated with sea ice.

== Conservation status ==
In 2021, the Arctic cod was listed as highly threatened by the Norwegian Red List due to the impacts of increasing ocean temperatures on embryo survival.

== Fishery ==
Arctic cod was commercially fished by Norway and Russia in the Barents Sea from 1930 to 2012. The fishery was closed due to declining populations of Arctic cod. Arctic cod are unlikely to become a large-scale fishery in the Arctic due to the remoteness of their habitats and low prices for the species.

Arctic cod are not culturally significant to the Inuit and are not used in subsistence fishing. However, Arctic cod are used by Greenlandic Inuit fishers as bait for Greenland halibut, which is the main fishery in the area. Fishing for Arctic cod is a relatively new practice for the Greenlandic Inuit, as it became more accessible in the 1990s through the availability of sonar echosounders that help detect Arctic cod schools. Before the use of sonar, detection of Arctic cod was possible but less efficient. Therefore, Arctic cod were not fished at larger scales as it was not profitable. Greenlandic Inuit fishers locate schools of Arctic cod by observing the movements of predators in combination with the use of sonar. They catch the cod with mesh nets at depths of 10-50m and up to 200m. Due to the remote fishing areas, fishers typically only go out to fish every 2 to 4 days.

Arctic cod is caught as bycatch in bottom trawls used for Greenland halibut and northern and striped shrimp fishing. Arctic cod bycatch reaches about 50 tons in each fishery.

== Impacts of climate change ==
Although very populous throughout the Arctic Ocean, Arctic cod can still be victim to threats from human actions. Global warming has increased steadily over the past years, and it has caused an increase in ocean temperatures of the Arctic Ocean. Arctic cod live in extremely cold water temperatures, and therefore they have adapted to sub-zero temperatures. Arctic cod populations are predicted to decline due to climate change.

The Canadian Arctic has low pelagic fish biodiversity and is controlled by lower trophic levels, meaning that the area is more sensitive to changes in Arctic cod populations than other Arctic regions. Changes to Arctic cod populations will have cascading effects on populations of endemic Canadian Arctic species used by Inuit subsistence fishers and hunters.

Ocean temperatures in the Arctic are warming and sea ice extent is reducing. Boreal species can withstand these warmer temperatures, extending their ranges northward into habitats historically inhabited by only Arctic species. In the Barents Sea, boreal capelin, Atlantic cod, and haddock have already started moving northwards into Arctic cod dominated areas. Arctic cod now face increased competition and predation from these boreal species.

Arctic cod embryos are also sensitive to temperature. Increasing sea surface temperatures will decrease the optimal thermal range for embryos. Their larvae must be in 3 °C to hatch normally, and a rise in ocean temperatures can easily lead to phenotypic changes of this cod species. Possible alterations of the species due to increasing ocean temperatures include, smaller size, reduced fecundity, earlier maturation, and increased investment in reproduction at an early age for some.

Arctic cod eggs are laid underneath sea ice, and as temperatures increase, sea ice cover will decrease. Arctic cod eggs will be increasingly exposed to UV radiation, turbulence and temperature changes, which could affect mortality. Reduced sea ice will also decrease the amount of refuge habitat available for juveniles. Ice dwelling Arctic cod will be affected by the loss of habitat complexity and structures provided by established sea ice. If sea ice forms later in autumn, Arctic cod spawning times may shift, and spawning habitat will decrease.

Climate change will also affect the primary production and availability of Arctic cod prey. Climate models predict that ice algae populations will increase because of decreases in ice thickness, allowing more light for primary production. This change will be favorable for young Arctic cod, but inter-annual variability in primary production might lead to different long-term outcomes.

Less sea ice will lead to increased anthropogenic activities in the Arctic, especially commercial shipping. Experimental studies have shown that Arctic cod respond to noise pollution from moving shipping vessels by retreating to areas with lower noise levels. Arctic cod also tend to aggregate in the presence of vessel noise. Increased usage of shipping lanes through the Arctic will likely fragment habitat for Arctic cod. With shipping comes the possibility of oil spills, which will also affect Arctic cod as they lack glomeruli to filter out toxins from their blood.

<doc id="405063" wikidata="Q148988" url="?curid=405063" title="Rhön Mountains">
<text>The Rhön Mountains () are a group of low mountains (or &quot;Mittelgebirge&quot;) in central Germany, located around the border area where the states of Hesse, Bavaria and Thuringia come together. These mountains, which are at the extreme southeast end of the East Hesse Highlands (&quot;Osthessisches Bergland&quot;), are partly a result of ancient volcanic activity. They are separated from the Vogelsberg Mountains by the river Fulda and its valley. The highest mountain in the Rhön is the Wasserkuppe (), which is in Hesse. The Rhön Mountains are a popular tourist destination and walking area.

==Origins==
The name &quot;Rhön&quot; is often thought to derive from the Celtic word &quot;raino&quot; (=hilly), but numerous other interpretations are also possible. Records of the monks at Fulda Abbey from the Middle Ages describe the area around Fulda as well as more distant parts of the Rhön as &quot;Buchonia&quot;, the land of ancient beech woods. In the Middle Ages beech was an important raw material. Large scale wood clearing resulted in the &quot;land of open spaces&quot; (&quot;Land der offenen Fernen&quot;), 30% of which, today, is forested.

==Geography==

===Location===
Lying within the states of Hesse, Bavaria and Thuringia, the Rhön is bounded by the Knüll to the northwest, the Thuringian Forest to the northeast, the Grabfeld to the southeast, Lower Franconia to the south, the Spessart forest to the southwest and the Vogelsberg mountains to the west.

=== Division by type of volcanic activity ===
Based on the effects of ancient volcanic activity, the Rhön can be divided into the &quot;Anterior Rhön&quot; (&quot;Vorderrhön&quot;), the &quot;Kuppen Rhön&quot; (geographical region 353, &quot;Kuppenrhön&quot;) and the &quot;High Rhön&quot; (354, &quot;Hohe Rhön&quot;).

The terms &quot;Anterior Rhön&quot; (&quot;Vorderrhön&quot;) and &quot;Kuppen Rhön&quot; (&quot;Kuppenrhön&quot; or &quot;Kuppige Rhön&quot;) are somewhat misleading, since the &quot;Anterior Rhön&quot; also consists mainly of &quot;Kuppen&quot; or low mountains with dome-shaped summits. The name has genuine historic origins: the &quot;Anterior Rhön&quot;, as viewed from Thuringia, forms the foothills (or anterior part) of the mountain region.

In this gently rolling landscape numerous individual dome-shaped mountains rise on both sides of the border of Hesse and Thuringia and also, in some places, in Bavaria. These &quot;Kuppen&quot; are the remnants of ancient volcanos or volcanic activity.

=== Natural regions ===

==== High Rhön ====

The High Rhön ( or &quot;Hochrhön&quot;) is that part of the central Rhön that lies in Hesse, Bavaria, and to a lesser extent in Thuringia; it covers an area of Landscape fact files by the BfN (c.f. section on Natural region division) and is up to and whose highland plateaux with elevations starting at are covered by solid basalt. Its core area in the northeast used to be called the &quot;Plattenrhön&quot;. The High Rhön is a natural regional major unit in the East Hesse Highlands; see Natural regions.

The High Rhön has five main mountainous regions:

* Wasserkuppen Rhön
* Long Rhön (&quot;Lange Rhön&quot;)
* Dammersfeld Ridge (&quot;Dammerfeldrücken&quot;)
* Kreuzberg Group
* Black Mountains (&quot;Schwarze Berge&quot;)

At the heart of the Rhön, albeit only the fourth highest summit of these mountains, is the Heidelstein () on the border between Bavaria and Hesse on the Rhine-Weser watershed. It forms the main high point on the plateau of the Long Rhön, which runs northeast over the Stirnberg () as far as the Ellenbogen (Schnitzersberg) () without crossing any significant lower ground. Within the Long Rhön the basalt layer is almost unbroken.

At the Heidelstein, another natural region, the Wasserkuppen Rhön, branches off in a north to northwesterly direction to the Rhön&#x27;s highest summit, the Wasserkuppe (), whose basalt likewise covers a wide area, but is broken in places by bunter sandstone and muschelkalk – in particular the basalt &quot;kuppen&quot; of the Weiherberg (, northwest) and Ehrenberg ( northeast) are slightly separated from the rest.

Between the northeastern end of the Wasserkuppen Rhön at the Ehrenberg and the plateau of the Long Rhön from the Heidelstein to just beyond the Stirnberg is the Upper Ulster valley, which cuts into the bunter sandstone by up to about and divides the &quot;Plattenrhön&quot; in two.

The Long Rhön runs southwest along the main watershed to the Dammersfeld ridge which continues along the watershed via the Hohe Hölle () and Eierhauckberg () to the Dammersfeldkuppe (), the ridge being clearly narrower than the Long Rhön and its basalt layer being interrupted several times. The Großer () and Kleiner Auersberg (about ), separated by the valley of the Schmale Sinn, are also part of this natural region.

South of Heidelstein and Hoher Hölle the narrow head of the Brend valley near Bischofsheim forms the boundary with another mountain group of the High Rhön, the Kreuzberg Group, which contains the Arnsberg () and the Kreuzberg (). In between these two mountains lies the source of the Sinn. This river, which forms a wide and deep valley head flanked by the Dammersfeld ridge, flows to the southwest.

On the other side of the Sinn valley, and southwest of the Kreuzberg Group, are the Black Mountains (), which include the Schwarzenberg (Feuerberg, ) and Totnansberg (). They are separated from the Kreuzberg Group by the narrow valley of the Premich&#x27;s upper reaches, the &quot;Kellersbach&quot;.

Clearly different from the aforementioned ridges is the eastern slope of the Long Rhön, which forms the transition zone from the High Rhön to the muschelkalk region of the Mellrichstadt Gäu (&quot;Mellrichstädter Gäu&quot;), the eastern part of the Werra Gäu Plateaux. Individual domes rise from the descending Triassic beds east of the solid basalt covering of the Long Rhön in the of the tributaries of the Franconian Saale between Brend and Streu, notably the Gangolfsberg () and the Rother Kuppe (). This landscape bears a clear resemblance to the Kuppen Rhön.

The Wildflecken Training Area, which covers an area of , equivalent to almost a quarter of the High Rhön, is not accessible to the public.

==== Kuppen Rhön ====

The of the &quot;Kuppen Rhön in its narrow sense&quot;, to which the Anterior Rhön also belongs, is the wide outer fringe of markedly different relief, that circles around the High Rhön from the northeast (in Thuringia) through the northwest (in Hesse) to the southwest (with small parts in Bavaria). Numerous dome-shaped isolated mountains and hills rise above the valleys to , whose basalt covering is concentrated around the summit regions and does not blanket the entire landscape, as it does in the High Rhön. The domes or &quot;kuppen&quot; are the stumps of heavily weathered former volcanoes or volcanic pipes. Between pointed cones and broad domes lie many small plateaux, especially common in the Anterior Rhön.

Over a foundation of Middle Bunter sandstone lie stratigraphic sequences of Upper Bunter (Röt), muschelkalk and keuper, the last two rocks only surviving where they have been protected by an overlying sheet of basalt. Woods cover less than a third of the area and are largely restricted to the summit regions. Five natural regions may be distinguished:

* Anterior Rhön
* Auersberg Kuppenrhön
* Soisberg Kuppenrhön with the Hessian Skittles
* Milseburg Kuppenrhön
* Brückenau Kuppenrhön

The eastern part of the Kuppen Rhön is the Thuringian Anterior Rhön, which reaches a height of at the huge plateau of the Gebaberg in the southeast. There is hardly any keuper escarpment there at all. The &quot;kuppen&quot; and plateaux rest directly on a bedrock of muschelkalk. This natural region runs northeast from the wide, pyramidal Pleß, , far into the Bunter sandstone of the Stadlengsfeld Hills that descend to the River Werra. In the west the Middle Felda Valley forms a natural boundary between Kaltensundheim in the south and below Dermbach in the north.

West of the Felda valley is the Auersberg Kuppenrhön (&quot;Auersberger Kuppenrhön&quot;), which lies mainly in Thuringia, but extends into Hesse in the southwest. This natural region runs from the town of Auersberg in the south, which gives the region its name, to the boundary with the Long Rhön at the Ellenbogen, . In the northeast of the region, the prominent &quot;kuppe&quot; of the Baier reaches a height of , but its northernmost summit is the popular viewing mountain of Oechsen. The western boundary is the Middle Ulster Valley between Hilders in the south and below Buttlar in the north.

West of the Ulster valley is the Soisberg Kuppenrhön (&quot;Soisberger Kuppenrhön&quot;), which lies mainly in Hesse, with elements in the southeast also extending into Thuringia. This region reaches a height of at the Soisberg in the north where the countryside is enclosed by the Seulingswald forest. It reaches even greater elevations in the extreme southeast, where the Habelberg () west of Tann stands opposite to and north of the Auersberg. This natural region is well known for the Hessian Skittles, a striking regular array of high, gently rounded, basalt cones up to . North and south of the skittles most of the &quot;kuppen&quot; in this natural region are also arranged in a row along the watershed between the Werra and the Fulda and between the Ulster and the Haune respectively. To the west they do not quite reach the Haune at the Haune Plateaux; to the south the Nüst valley below Obernüst forms a natural boundary.

The almost entirely Hessian range of the Milseburg Kuppenrhön (&quot;Milseburger Kuppenrhön&quot;), which bounds the Wasserkuppen Rhön, up to , south of the Nüst valley and west of the Ulster valley. Again the keuper escarpment is missing and even the muschelkalk only appears in islands around individual domes. The majority of the basalt and phonolite cones sit directly on the sandstones of the Middle Bunter. Cutting deeply into the sandstone, the rivers of the Haune and the Fulda flow westwards. The phonolitic cone of the Milseburg () is the only mountain in the Kuppen Rhön that exceeds the 800-metre-mark. Even the height of the Großer Nallenberg () south of the Fulda, is not reached in other parts of the region. To the southwest the area is bounded by the rocky sandstone of the &quot;Hoher Kammer&quot; (), as it descends from the heights of the Dammersfeld ridge (up to ).

Separated from the Kammer by the upper reaches of the Döllbach, the &quot;Döllau&quot;, the Große Haube () on the Rhine-Weser watershed opens the Brückenau Kuppenrhön, whose western half is in Hesse and whose eastern half is in Bavaria. The valleys of the Schmaler and Breiter Sinn running southwestwards, divide the natural region, which is clearly more heterogenous than the other ranges of the Kuppen Rhön, into three segments. In the west, the rugged plateaux of dolerite and basalt transition into the Landrücken, whilst the northeast of the Kleiner Auersberg (c. ) leads up to the Dammersfeld ridge. Between the more rugged plateaux and ridges there are gently domed basalt intrusions that rise up, especially in the southeast, left of the Sinn near Bad Brückenau. The Dreistelzberg in the extreme south reaches .

=== Rivers ===
The following rivers rise in the Rhön Mountains or flow by or through them &quot;(length given in brackets)&quot;:

* The Franconian Saale (&quot;Fränkische Saale&quot;) – rises in Grabfeld, passes the southeast Rhön, flows southwest and into the River Main and therefore belongs to the catchment area of the River Rhine. The valley of the Franconian Saale in the area around Bad Neustadt forms part of the southeast border of the Rhön with the Grabfeld.
** Streu – rises in the Rhön on the southern slopes of the Ellenbogen and flows southwards into the Franconian Saale.
** The Brend – rises at Oberweißenbrunn in the Rhön, flows southeast into the Franconian Saale
** The Premich – rises from numerous springs between the Kreuzberg and the Black Hills, and heads southeast to the Franconian Saale
** The Thulba – rises on the Platzer Kuppe in the Rhön and flows southwards into the Franconian Saale
** The Schondra – rises in the Rhön and heads south into the Franconian Saale
** The Sinn – rises in the Rhön near Wildflecken and flows southwards into the Franconian Saale
* The Fulda – rises in the Rhön on the Wasserkuppe and is the left headstream of the Weser. The valley of the Fulda in the area around the town of Fulda separates the Rhön from the Vogelsberg Mountains to the west.
** The Haune – rises in the Rhön and flows north into the Fulda
** The Lütter – rises below the Wasserkuppe and flows westwards into the Fulda
** The Döllau – rises in the Rhön, and flows via the Fliede to the Fulda
* The Werra – rises on the boundary between the Thuringian Forest and Thuringian Highlands, runs past the Rhön to the northeast and flows northwards. It is the right headstream of the Weser. The valley of the Werra between Bad Salzungen and Wasungen separates the Rhön from the Thuringian Forest to the east.
** The Herpf – rises in the Rhön and flows east into the Werra.
** The Ulster – rises in the Rhön and flows north into the Werra.
** The Felda – rises in the Rhön and flows north into the Werra.

==History==

The name &quot;Rhön&quot; is believed to be of Celtic origin. A regional Celtic presence is well established, with an important Celtic town at Milseburg. Furthermore, there are circular embankments that could be both of Celtic and of Germanic origin in the &quot;Kuppenrhön&quot; on the Stallberg and the Kleinberg mountains. Many names of places, mountains and meadows in the Rhön likely have their origins in Celtic root words.

Up to the 10th century parts of the Rhön belonged to Altgau Buchonia. This term was coined by the Romans in Late Antiquity and described an ancient beech forest in the Rhön and the neighbouring low mountain ranges of the Spessart and Vogelsberg. Expansive stands of beech still exist today in the area.

Due to the far reaching view from the Rhön mountains, they became sites for hilltop castles in the Middle Ages. One example is Hauneck Castle (&quot;Burg Hauneck&quot;) on the Stoppelsberg, the ruins of which can still be seen. It served to oversee and protect traffic on the ancient road, the Antsanvia, as well as protecting the villages in the Haune valley.

In the Middle Ages the &quot;Würzburg Defences&quot; (&quot;landwehr&quot;) were erected on the &quot;Hochrhön&quot; for the protection of its farmers.

The Rhön was also home to the Christian Community known as the Bruderhof from 1926 to 1937 when it was dissolved by Nazi persecution.

==Biosphere Reserve==

In 1991 UNESCO declared parts of the Rhön a Biosphere Reserve on account of its unique high-altitude ecosystem.

==Flora and fauna==
As a result of its geography and geology the Rhön is an area with higher-than-average number of different habitats and species. But man, too, has generated valuable secondary habitats by creating a rich cultural landscape.

===Plant life===
Compared with other low mountain regions, the Rhön is particularly rich in plant varieties. Its natural vegetation would probably be dominated by beech woods with scattered groups of other trees, but today beech trees are very much in decline. A few of these ancient woods were identified as core elements of the Rhön biosphere reserve. The higher beech woods are a habitat for rare, sometimes isolated, species of plant such as the Alpine blue-sow-thistle, giant bellflower and annual honesty. The vegetation of the lower-lying beech woods has a mix of mountain and other varieties. In addition to common wildflowers like the martagon lily, lily of the valley, wild chervil and wild garlic, various orchids also flourish here including &quot;Cephalanthera&quot; orchids, the yellow coralroot, bird&#x27;s-nest orchid, lady&#x27;s slipper and lady orchid.

Only small areas of the Rhön landscape are essentially open: the raised bogs (&quot;Hochmoore&quot;), the rock outcrops and the stone runs. These habitats are home to highly specialised species. The raised bogs of the Long Rhön - the Red Moor (&quot;Rotes Moor&quot;) and the Black Moor (&quot;Schwarzes Moor&quot;) are floristically important links between the northern and Alpine raised bogs. Here, for example, can be found sundews, crowberry and cottongrass. Growing amongst the rocks of the volcanic mountains are rare species such as Cheddar pink, sweet william catchfly, oblong woodsia and fir clubmoss.

There are no naturally occurring coniferous forests in the Rhön, but notable species of wild flower such as the lady&#x27;s slipper orchid, creeping lady&#x27;s tresses and burning-bush are found in the forests of mixed pine.

The cultural landscape formed by humankind over the centuries also has a great variety of habitats and plants however, today, the extensive grassland areas are amongst the most threatened and heavily cultivated habitats. It is on the semi-arid grasslands and juniper heaths that the silver thistle, symbol of the Rhön region, grows, alongside gentians, pasque flowers and wood anemones, as well as orchids like the early purple, fragrant and fly orchids. Rarer flowers include the various bee orchids and the military, lady, burnt, green-winged, man, pyramidal, frog and lizard orchids. Along the southern fringes of the Rhön, on the so-called slopes of steppe heathland (&quot;Steppenheidenhängen&quot;) grow warmth-loving plants such as white rock-rose, erect clematis and honewort.

Amongst the most valuable habitats in the Rhön are the mountain meadows and fields of mat grass (&quot;Nardetum strictae&quot;) on the higher slopes. Characteristic plants here include the monkshood, northern wolfsbane, common moonwort, martagon lily, greater butterfly orchid, perennial cornflower and wig knapweed.

Bog-bean, grass of Parnassus&#x27; western marsh orchid and lousewort are found in the wet meadows and low marshes; and the extremely rare large brown clover, hairy stonecrop and Pyrenean scurvygrass in the springwater marshes of the &quot;Hohe Rhön&quot;.

===Wildlife===

The wildlife in the Rhön mountains is similar to that of other low mountain ranges, but there are also some unusual species. In addition to the more common mammals such as roe deer, fox, badger, hare and wild boar, there are also smaller mammals such as the dormouse, common water shrew and Miller&#x27;s water shrew. One unusual regional species is the alpine shrew. Birds occurring here include the black grouse, the capercaillie, the black stork, the eagle owl, the corncrake, the red-backed shrike and the wryneck. There are also two species endemic to the Rhön: the rove beetle and a local snail, the &quot;Rhönquellschnecke&quot; (Bythinella compressa).

==Rhön umbrella brand==

The &quot;Dachmarke Rhön&quot; project (Rhön umbrella brand project) is run by the Rhön working group and its aim is to promote a common identity for the Rhön region and to present a unified view of the area to the outside world and to harmonise the marketing measures of the three participating federal states.
==Tourism==

These mountains are a popular tourist destination. Hikers come for the nearly of trails, and gliding enthusiasts have been drawn to the area since the early 20th century. More recently, farm holidays have been flourishing in the region.

<text>American Record Corporation (ARC), also referred to as American Record Company, American Recording Corporation, or ARC Records, was an American record company in operation from 1929 to 1938, and again from 1978 to 1982.

==Overview==

ARC was created in January 1929 by Louis G. Sylvester, president of Scranton Button Works (&#x27;Scranton&#x27;), founded 1885. Scranton owned a pressing plant that manufactured disks for many companies, including Columbia labels and Emerson Records, the latter which it also owned. It then purchased Cameo Record Corporation, which owned the Cameo, Lincoln and Romeo labels), and six labels owned by the Plaza Music Company (Conqueror, Banner, Domino, Jewel, Oriole, and Regal). for $1 each, including liabilities. Pathé-Perfect Phonograph and Radio Corporation, which owned Actuelle, Pathé, and Perfect, was also purchased. &#x27;American Record Corporation&#x27; was incorporated in Delaware on July 25, 1929, as a subsidiary of Consolidated Film Industries, Inc. (&quot;CFI&quot;). Louis G. Sylvester became the president of the new company, located at 1776 Broadway in Manhattan, New York City.

==Columbia Phonograph Company US ownership==

In March 1925, Louis Sterling, managing director of the UK Columbia Graphophone Company, backed by J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., acquired a controlling interest in the parent company, Columbia Phonograph Company (U.S.), for $2.5 million, in order to purchase the license for new Western Electric patents that Columbia US could not afford.
The British firm controlled US operations from 1925 until 1931. Sterling, originally from New York, became chairman.

The repercussions of the stock market Crash of 1929 led to huge losses in the recording industry and, in March 1931, J.P Morgan, the major shareholder, steered the Columbia Graphophone Company (along with Odeon records and Parlophone, which it had owned since 1926) into a merger with the Gramophone Company ( (&quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot;) to form Electric and Musical Industries Ltd (EMI). Since the Gramophone Company (HMV) was a wholly owned subsidiary of Victor, and Columbia in America was a subsidiary of UK Columbia, Victor now technically owned its largest rival in the US. To avoid antitrust legislation, EMI had to sell off its US Columbia operation, which continued to release pressings of matrices made in the UK.

In December, 1931, the U.S. Columbia Phonograph Company, Inc. was sold to the Grigsby-Grunow Company, the manufacturers of Majestic radios and refrigerators. When Grigsby-Grunow was declared bankrupt in November 1933, Columbia was placed in receivership, and in June 1934, the company was sold to Sacro Enterprises Inc. (&quot;Sacro&quot;) for $70,000. Sacro was incorporated a few days before the sale in New York. Public documents do not contain any names. Many suspect that it was a shell corporation set up by ARC&#x27;s parent, Consolidated Films Industries, Inc. to hold the Columbia stock. This assumption grew out of the ease which CFI later exhibited in selling Columbia in 1938.

==Brunswick Radio Corporation purchased by Warner Brothers Pictures, Inc.==

On April 9, 1930, the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company sold its Brunswick and Vocalion trademarks, patents, master recordings, inventory of unsold records, recording studio leases, radio/phonograph manufacturing plants and record pressing plants to Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. (WB), which named its new division the &quot;Brunswick Radio Corporation.&quot; The price was $10,000,000.

According to a book co-authored by Jack Warner, Jr., Warner Bros. Pictures &quot;bought the radio, record and phonograph divisions of Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company for the company&#x27;s patents, its record factory, and its 16mm home talkie projector&quot;. Before they came to their senses, it was all moved across the country to WB&#x27;s Sunset studio. WB soon realized it was a terrible mistake; it lost $8 million on the Brunswick deal.

Melotone, a subsidiary label of the Brunswick Radio Corporation, was introduced late in 1930. &quot;Brunswick is the first of the big-three disc companies to go into the market shortly with a double-faced disc to sell at 25 cents. Plate is called the Melotone,&quot; reported Variety. &quot;Policy of Melotone will be the biggest song, to be delivered as cheaply as possible. No literature or advertising campaigns; cheap nut, quantity is the goal.&quot;

WB wanted to withdraw from the record business, but economic conditions had deteriorated to the point where no buyer would offer anything close to the $10,000,000 they&#x27;d paid for Brunswick just the year before. Unwilling to take a huge loss, an agreement was entered into with Consolidated Film Industries, the parent company of ARC, on December 3, 1931, whereby the record company&#x27;s artist and staff employment contracts were transferred, and the Brunswick, Vocalion and Melotone trademarks and catalog of master recordings were loaned, to the &quot;Brunswick Record Corporation,&quot; a newly-formed holding company controlled by ARC.

While WB was to be paid a fee on sales of records pressed from Brunswick, Vocalion and Melotone masters recorded prior to December 3, 1931, ARC was permitted to release its own master recordings on the Brunswick, Vocalion and Melotone labels free of charge. The agreement effectively fixed the minimum retail price of a 10-inch Brunswick record at 75 cents, but allowed ARC free rein to set prices for Vocalion and Melotone (The price of Melotone nonetheless stayed at 25 cents.) In the event that fewer than 250,000 Brunswick records were pressed and sold in the U.S. and Canada during any one-year period, the agreement provided that control of the trademarks and catalog of Brunswick, Vocalion and Melotone masters recorded through December 2, 1931 would revert to WB. Brunswick would become ARC&#x27;s premium label.

==Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. acquires American Record Corporation==

On December 17, 1938, American Record Corporation was purchased for $700,000 by the Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. (CBS). Edward Wallerstein was named president on January 3, 1939. On April 4, 1939 CBS filed an amendment in New York for Columbia Phonograph Company, Inc.

Columbia Phonograph Company, Inc., has been chartered to conduct a business in the recording of voices, sounds, etc., in New York, with Frank K. White and Adrian Murphy (employees of CBS), among the directors. Attorney Ralph F. CoUn, 165 Broadway, is third director. White owns four shares; the others three apiece. Capitol stock is $10;000, $10 par value. 
Rosenberg, Goldmlark &amp; Colin, are filing attorneys.

Above incorporation represents the formal change of name of CBS&#x27; phonograph subsidiary. The American Record Co. tag is discarded and instead of three corporations embracing the ARC&#x27;S various operations there will be one, the Columbia Phonograph Co., Inc. The latter label was taken over by Herbert J. Yates, former head of the American Record Co. several years ago and made file insignia of the combine&#x27;s classical catelog. The indications are that the Columbia label will be returned to the popular field, replacing Brunswick as the company&#x27;s fee popular record.

On May 22, 1939, Columbia Recording Corporation, Inc., was incorporated with the State of Delaware, and became the CBS phonograph subsidiary. The New York Department of State shows a later incorporation date of April 4, 1947. This corporation changed its name to Columbia Records, Inc. on October 11, 1954, and reverted to CRC on January 2, 1962.

==Columbia Recording Corporation==

In February 1939, &quot;American Record Co., now the child of the Columbia Broadcasting System, will shortly&#x27; move its recording division from its present location on upper-Broadway, New York, to a site conveniently near the Madison avenue home of its new parent&quot;. Studios were established at 799 7th Avenue, New York City, along with corporate offices at 1473 Barnum Avenue, Bridgeport, CT. Also in February, John Hammond was hired by Wallerstein as Associate Director Popular Recording. Another executive from ARC, Art Satherley, was not expected to transition over as easily. &quot;It is understood that CBS and the Levys are not interested in retaining American Record&#x27;s hillbilly department, and that Art Satherly, who has been running this section for many years, will take it out of the company with him&quot;. Fortunately, to the delight of many, this did not happen, and Art went on to many more successful years.

Hammond hired Benny Goodman away from Victor to record for the Columbia label. Then came an announcement August 30, 1939, &quot;Columbia drops its Brunswick label at 75c in favor of a 50c platter tagged Columbia, with the issuing of the first of the platters cut by Benny Goodman Sept 3&quot;. Brunswick was gradually phased out, the final issue being Brunswick 8520, in April 1940. On December 27, &quot;Columbia Records expects to shift quite a list of artists from its current $.35 Vocalion label to the recently created $.50 Columbia...reason for the shift is that the Columbia label is selling so much faster than the Vocalion.&quot;

As sales of Brunswick records declined, a minimum threshold required by the 1931 Warner Bros. lease agreement was going unmet, which obliged Columbia to also discontinue Vocalion. The final Vocalion issued under Columbia&#x27;s aegis, number 5621, was released July 5, 1940. It was priced at 35 cents, as was the next record in the series, OKeh 05622. Okeh Records was revived in June 1940, acquired in the same 1934 bankruptcy sale whereby ARC obtained its Columbia trademarks. By July, it was releasing new Hillbilly platters by Gene Autry and Bob Wills, and re-issuing past Vocalion discs, using the same catalogue numbers with a leading zero added. Okeh was extremely successful until it was merged into the parent label in 1945. When a January 1941 audit found that not more than 150,000 Brunswick records had sold during the period from December 1, 1939 through December 31, 1940, control of the loaned trademarks and catalog of master recordings made prior to December 3, 1931 reverted to Warner Bros. Pictures

==Brunswick and Vocalion purchased by Decca Records, Inc.==

On May 2, 1941, Decca Records Executive Milton Rackmil bought Brunswick Radio Corporation from Warner Brothers for $350,000, which included Brunswick, Vocalion and Melotone masters from label inception to December 1931. Decca reactivated the labels for limited purposes from time to time, but it was the valuable catalogues it really wanted. Brunswick masters included Isham Jones, Al Jolson, early Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong and Marion Harris, but it was obscure Jacques Rennard and His Orchestra that had recorded &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; in 1931. Decca re-released it in 1943, to capitalize on &#x27;Casablanca&#x27;s&#x27; (1942) theme music. Because of the American Federation of Musicians&#x27; 1942–1944 musicians&#x27; strike, which resulted in a ban on studio recording, the only recordings the major labels could find were the Rennard, and a July 1931 rendition by Rudy Vallee and His Connecticut Yankees, released by Victor. Both finished in the top 25 of 1943, with Renard&#x27;s version selling over 250,000 copies, making Decca management so happy, they gave him a $1,000 bonus, even though he hadn&#x27;t recorded for years. His record&#x27;s sales more than paid for the Brunswick Radio Corporation purchase. Rackmil was also promoted and named to the Decca board of directors.

==ARC re-activated==

During August 1978 ARC was reactivated by Columbia as Maurice White&#x27;s vanity label. Acts such as Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Weather Report, Deniece Williams, Pockets, and The Emotions were signed to the label. One of the label&#x27;s final releases was Earth, Wind &amp; Fire&#x27;s 1981 album &quot;Raise!&quot;

As of 2019, the ARC legacy is now part of Sony Music Entertainment.

<doc id="405071" wikidata="Q2400963" url="?curid=405071" title="Dude, Where's My Country?">
<text>Dude, Where&#x27;s My Country? is a 2003 book by Michael Moore dealing with corporate and political events in the United States. The title is a satirical reworking of the 2000 film &quot;Dude, Where&#x27;s My Car?&quot;.

The book covers many topics and is written in a heavily satirical fashion, in common with much of Moore&#x27;s work.

== Outline ==
In the book, Moore attacks corporate America and President George W. Bush, whom he accuses of destroying &quot;my America of tolerance and peace&quot;. He lashes out against the 2003 Iraq War in particular. The Enron Corporation, and particularly Chairman Ken Lay, also received a lot of attention.

Moore is also critical of the post 9/11 security measures implemented by the Bush administration and Congress, especially the Patriot Act. The frontispiece reads in part: 

Topics covered range from who the Democrats should put up for the presidency (Moore proposes Oprah Winfrey or General Wesley Clark, once the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO) right through to &#x27;How to talk to your conservative brother-in-law&#x27;, a guide on how to avoid interpersonal conflicts at Thanksgiving dinner with the family. On page 87 Moore praises Oprah Winfrey for being the only mainstream media to show antiwar footage two months before the war that no other U.S. media would show.

Breaking from some on the left, Moore at one point in his book says that &quot;Mumia probably killed that guy&quot;. Activists supporting the Black Panther Party&#x27;s Mumia Abu-Jamal demanded that Moore substantiate this claim. Moore in a later interview stated that he did not believe that Mumia Abu Jamal killed the police officer, and that he would change the passage for the paperback release.

After publishing &quot;Stupid White Men&quot;, an earlier work, Michael Moore was accused of not providing references to back up his statements. As a response to this, &quot;Dude, Where&#x27;s My Country?&quot; includes thorough references.

<text>Vladimir Aleksandrovich Dzhanibekov (, born 13 May 1942) is a retired Soviet Air Force Major General and a cosmonaut veteran of five orbital missions.

==Biography==
Dzhanibekov was born Vladimir Aleksandrovich Krysin () in the remote area of Iskandar in what was then Bostanliq District, South Kazakhstan Region, Kazakh SSR (since 1956 – Tashkent Region, Uzbekistan) on 13 May 1942. His family moved to Tashkent soon after his birth.

In 1964 he married Liliya Munirovna Dzhanibekova, who was a descendant of Janibeg, medieval ruler of the Golden Horde. As her father had no sons, Dzhanibekov took his wife&#x27;s family name in order to honour her ancestry and continue her line of descent, an unusual step for a husband in the Soviet Union.

In 1960 he entered Leningrad University to study physics, where he became involved in flying, something in which he had always been interested. In 1961 he decided to enroll in the V. M. Komarov Higher Military Flying School at Yeisk while simultaneously completing his degree in physics at the Taganrog campus of Rostov State University. Four years later he graduated and became a flying instructor in the Soviet Air Forces serving at military training unit number 99735 in Taganrog in 1968–1970. During the 1970 visit of Gherman Titov to the Taganrog-based Air Forces training unit he was selected into the cosmonaut training pool Air Force Group 5. He joined the Communist Party the same year.

Dzhanibekov served on five space missions: Soyuz 27/Soyuz 26 (launch/return), Soyuz 39, Soyuz T-6, Soyuz T-12, and Soyuz T-13. He accrued 145 days, 15 hours, and 56 minutes in space over these five missions. He had also performed two EVAs with the total time of 8 hours and 35 minutes. In 1985 he demonstrated stable and unstable rotation of a T-handle nut from the orbit, subsequently named the &quot;Dzhanibekov effect&quot;. The effect had been long known from the tennis racket theorem, which says that rotation about an object&#x27;s intermediate principal axis is unstable while in free fall.

In 1985 he was promoted to the rank of major general. After retiring from the cosmonaut program in 1986, he became involved in politics. He was the Deputy to the Supreme Soviet of Uzbek SSR from 1985 until 1990. Also, he has taken up photography and painting, and his works, predominantly of space thematics, are owned by museums and private collectors.

Starting 1990, Dzhanibekov unsuccessfully attempted to circumnavigate the globe by balloon. He partnered with Larry Newman who envisioned flying a NASA-designed sky anchor balloon. This unique hourglass shaped design used a zero pressure helium balloon for buoyancy and a superpressure balloon for variable ballast. Manufactured by Raven Industries, the double balloon system together measured tall. A proof of concept flight, launched from Tillamook, Oregon on 8 September 1990, was crewed by Dzhanibekov, Newman, Tim Lachenmeier, and Don Moses. Moses replaced Richard Branson, who was unable to make it by the weather window departure time. The flight lasted for continuous 31 hours, spanning two nights, before landing at Omak, Washington, and confirmed the sky anchor balloon nominal performance. Dzhanibekov, Larry Newman, and Don Moses piloted the &quot;Earthwinds Hilton&quot; balloon which was primarily sponsored by Barron Hilton. In 1992 an attempt from Akron, Ohio did not launch due to strong winds. The next attempt was a planned pre-dawn launch but was delayed for several hours by difficulties inflating both balloons. Launching later than desired, on 13 January 1993 the &quot;Earthwinds&quot; liftoff from Reno Stead Airport flew for 30 minutes before crashing. The balloon could not penetrate a strong inversion layer and tore the ballast balloon on a mountain peak. The three crewmen survived the crash without injuries. An additional flight on 31 December 1994 reached when the ballast balloon failed. These sky anchor balloon failures prompted other circumnavigation attempts to switch to the Roziere balloon system instead.

The minor planet 3170 Dzhanibekov, discovered by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh in 1979, is named after him.

<text>Thomas Brown (1662 – 18 June 1704) was an English translator and satirist, largely forgotten today save for a four-line gibe that he may have written concerning John Fell.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Brown was born at either Shifnal or Newport in Shropshire; he is identified with the Thomas Brown, son of William and Dorothy Brown, who was recorded christened on 1 January 1663 at Newport. His father, a farmer and tanner, died when Thomas was eight years old. He took advantage of the free schooling offered in the county, attending Adams&#x27; Grammar School at Newport, before going up to Christ Church, Oxford and there meeting the college&#x27;s dean, Dr John Fell.

Fell was well known as a disciplinarian, and Brown throughout his life displayed a disdain for restrictions. The legend behind Brown&#x27;s most recognised work is therefore plausible: it states that Brown got into trouble while at Oxford, and was threatened with expulsion, but that Dr Fell offered to spare Brown if he could translate an epigram from Martial (I, 32, 1):

:&quot;Non amo te, Sabidi, nec possum dicere quare;&quot;
:&quot;Hoc tantum possum dicere, non amo te.&quot;

According to the story, Brown replied extemporaneously:

:I do not love thee, Dr Fell,
:The reason why I cannot tell;
:But this I know, and know full well,
:I do not love thee, Dr Fell.

Fell is said to have stayed Brown&#x27;s dismissal from the college in admiration of this translation. However, the story is of apocryphal provenance, and it is known that Brown left Christ Church without a degree, moving to Kingston upon Thames where he stayed three years as a schoolmaster, and later to London, where he took up residence on Aldersgate Street in the Grub Street district.

=== Career ===
After some years spent as headmaster of the free school at Kingston upon Thames, Brown moved to London to live by his pen. Remembered now mainly for his witty political satires, he also wrote three stage plays, including &quot;The Dispensary&quot; (1697), and a large number of essays. A life-long friend of Aphra Behn, Brown assisted in her literary career. 

Brown made a modest living from his writing in Latin, French and English, in addition to offering services of translation. He translated copiously from Latin and Greek, French, Italian, and Spanish. The list of the translated authors includes, among others, Catullus, Cicero, Horace, Martial, Persius, Pliny, Petronius, and Lucian. He refrained, however, from ever attaching himself to a patron, and expressed contempt toward those who did so. He pursued a libertine lifestyle, and his satirical works gained him several enemies in their subjects.

His best-known works, apart from the quatrain, are probably &quot;Amusements Serious and Comical, calculated for the Meridian of London&quot; (1700) and &quot;Letters from the Dead to the Living&quot; (1702), although his writings were quite prolific. Several works of the period whose author is unknown are suspected to be his.

Toward the end of his life he began to regret the licentiousness with which he had lived it, and on his deathbed he secured from his publisher (one Sam Briscoe) a promise that any posthumously published works would be censored of &quot;all prophane, undecent passages&quot;. The promise was promptly reneged upon.

Many of Brown&#x27;s works went unpublished until his death, and the publication date of many is in question, as is his stature as a writer. Contemporary opinion was mixed; Jonathan Swift spoke quite highly of Brown&#x27;s work, and indeed parts of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; and other of Swift&#x27;s works may have been significantly influenced by Brown&#x27;s writings. Henry Fielding, in &quot;Tom Jones&quot;, calls him (through the words of Benjamin the barber) &quot;one of the greatest wits that ever the nation produced&quot;. On the other hand, those whom Brown mercilessly lampooned during his lifetime understandably did nothing to further his good reputation after his demise.

The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica gives this verdict: &quot;He was the author of a great variety of poems, letters, dialogues and lampoons, full of humour and erudition, but coarse and scurrilous. His writings have a certain value for the knowledge they display of low life in London.&quot; Presently the best description of Brown&#x27;s legacy may be that of Joseph Addison, who accorded him the appellation &quot;T-m Br-wn of facetious Memory&quot;. He was buried in the grounds of Westminster Abbey.

<text>The Sko or Skou languages are a small language family spoken by about 7000 people, mainly along the Vanimo coast of Sandaun Province in Papua New Guinea, with a few being inland from this area and at least one just across the border in the Indonesian province of Papua (formerly known as Irian Jaya).

==Typology==
===Tone===
Skou languages are unusual among Papuan languages for being tonal; all Skou languages possess contrastive tone. Vanimo, for example, has three tones, &quot;high, mid, low.&quot;

Example minimal sets illustrating tonal contrasts in various Skou languages:

*I’saka: &quot;ẽy&quot;H ‘louse’, &quot;wey&quot;L ‘butterfly’, &quot;wey&quot;LH ‘house’, &quot;wey&quot;HL ‘language’
*Barupu: &quot;e&quot;H ‘tooth’, &quot;e&quot;L ‘garden’, &quot;e&quot;HL ‘mosquito’, &quot;e&quot;HLH ‘write’
*Wutung: &quot;ho&quot;H ‘roof thatch made from sago palm fronds’, &quot;ho&quot;L ‘star’, &quot;ho&quot;HL ‘grease’
*Skou: &quot;ta&quot;H ‘grass’, &quot;ta&quot;L ‘hair’, &quot;ta&quot;HL ‘arrow’

Lakes Plain languages, spoken in a discontiguous area to the southwest, are also tonal. Because of the apparent phonological similarities and sharing of stable basic words such as ‘louse’, Foley speculates the potential likelihood of a distant relationship shared between the Skou and Lakes Plain families, but no formal proposals linking the two families have been made due to insufficient evidence. Additionally according to Foley, based on some lexical and phonological similarities, the Keuw language (currently classified as a language isolate) may also possibly share a deep relationship with the Lakes Plain languages. Like the Lakes Plain languages, Keuw also possesses constrative tone.

Lepki, Kaure, and Kembra, spoken in mountainous inland regions of the Indonesia-PNG border to the southwest of the Skou-speaking area, are also tonal.

===Morphology===
Skou languages can be isolating or polysynthetic.

*Isolating structure: Dumo, an Inner Skou language
*Polysynthetic structure: Barupu, a Piore River language

== Classification ==
Skou languages were first linked by G. Frederici in 1912. In 1941, K.H. Thomas expanded the family to its current extent.

The Sko family is not accepted by Søren Wichmann (2013), who splits it into two separate groups.

Donohue (2007) and Donohue and Crowther (2005) list Nouri as a mixed language having features of both the Piore River and Serra Hills subgroups.

===Sko (Laycock 1975)===
Laycock posited two branches, Vanimo and Krisa:
*Sko
**Vanimo branch
***Skou
***Sangke (Nyao)
***Wutung
***Vanimo (Dumo)
**Krisa branch
***I’saka (Krisa)
***Rawo
***Puari
***Barupu (Warapu)
===Skou (Ross 2005)===
However, Krisa is poorly supported and Malcolm Ross abandoned it.
*Skou
**I’saka (Krisa)
**Barupu (Warapu)
**Puari
**Rawo
**Womo
**Vanimo branch:
*** Skou (Tumawo)
***Leitre
***Sangke (Nyao)
***Wutung
***Vanimo (Dumo)
***Dusur
===Macro-Skou (Donohue 2002)===
Mark Donohue proposed a subclassification based on areal diffusion he called &quot;Macro-Skou&quot;.
*Macro-Skou
**Isaka
**Skou–Serra–Piore linkage
***Piore River: Nori (strongly influenced by Womo), Barupu
***Serra Hills
****Puare
****Rawo – Main Serra: Rawo, Womo
*** Skou (Vanimo) family
****Skou
****Eastern Skou / Vanimo
*****Leitre
*****West Coast
******Border: Nyao, Wutung
******Vanimo proper: Dumo, Dusur
Donohue (2004) notes that is unclear if extinct Nouri is in the Piore River or Serra Hills branch.

===Sko (Foley 2018)===
Foley (2018) provides the following classification.
*Sko
**I&#x27;saka
**Piore River
***Barupu / Warupu (Bauni)
***Ramo (Uni)
***Sumo (Bouni)
**Serra Hills
***Puare
****Womo
****Waro
**Inner Sko
***Skou
****Leitre
*****Dumo
*****Dusur
*****Nyao / Sangke
*****Wutung
Foley&#x27;s &quot;Inner Sko&quot; corresponds to Donohue&#x27;s &quot;Western Skou&quot;.

===Miller (2017)===
The &quot;Piore River&quot; branch was renamed &quot;Lagoon&quot; in Miller (2017). The older names of the Piore River languages were from village names; Miller has since renamed them as Bauni, Uni, Bouni, and Bobe, though it is debatable whether they are all distinct languages.
*Lagoon (also &quot;Piore River&quot;)
**Bauni (Poo and Barapu/Warapu villages)
**Uni (Ramo village)
**Bouni (Sumo village)
**Bobe (Nouri village)
===Usher (2020)===
Usher groups the languages as follows, with each node being a reconstructable clade, and giving the family a geographic label rather than naming it after a single language. The Eastern languages are typologically quite distinct from the Western languages and I&#x27;saka.
*Vanimo Coast
**I&#x27;saka
**West
***Skou
***Leitre
***Dumo-Dusur (Vanimo)
***Sangke–Wutung
****Sangke (Nyao)
****Wutung
**East
***Piore River
****Barupu (Bauni–Uri–Bouni)
****Nouri 
***Serra Hills
****Puare
****Rawo
****Pini
*****Womo
*****Sumararu
==Pronouns==
The pronouns Ross reconstructs for proto-Skou are,

The Skou languages also have a dual, with a distinction between inclusive and exclusive we, but the forms are not reconstructable for the proto-language.

Pronouns in individual Skou languages:

==Cognates==
Sko family cognates (I&#x27;saka, Barupu, Wutung, Skou) listed by Foley (2018):

A cognate set for &#x27;louse&#x27; in Sko languages (reconstructing roughly to *nipi in Proto-Sko) as compiled by Dryer (2022):

==Vocabulary comparison==
The following basic vocabulary words are from Voorhoeve (1971, 1975), as cited in the Trans-New Guinea database. More recent data from Marmion (2010) has been added for Wutung and from Donohue (2002) (as cited in the ASJP Database) for Skou.

The words cited constitute translation equivalents, whether they are cognate (e.g. &quot;lúrtô&quot;, &quot;rəto&quot; for “eye”) or not (e.g. &quot;hlúqbùr&quot;, &quot;kəsu&quot; for “head”).

<text>Sandaun Province (formerly West Sepik Province) is the northwesternmost mainland province of Papua New Guinea (also known as home of the sunset). It covers an area of 35,920 km2 (13868 m2) and has a population of 248,411 (2011 census). The capital is Vanimo. In July 1998 the area surrounding the town of Aitape was hit by an enormous tsunami caused by a Magnitude 7.0 earthquake which killed over 2,000 people. The five villages along the west coast of Vanimo towards the International Border are namely; Lido, Waromo, Yako, Musu and Wutung. It borders Indonesia.

==Name==
Sandaun is a Tok Pisin word derived from English &quot;sun down,&quot; since the province is located in the west of the country, where the sun sets. The province was formerly named West Sepik Province, for the Sepik River that flows through the province and forms part of the province&#x27;s southern border.

== Physical Geography ==
The Sandaun Province has beaches along the northern coast, as well as mountainous areas throughout the province, primarily in the southern area of the province. Several rivers flow throughout the province, most notable the Sepik River. The area, like much of Papua New Guinea, is prone to earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions.

==Districts and LLGs==
There are four districts in the province. Each district has one or more Local Level Government (LLG) areas. For census purposes, the LLG areas are subdivided into wards and those into census units.

== Provincial leaders==

The province was governed by a decentralised provincial administration, headed by a Premier, from 1978 to 1995. Following reforms taking effect that year, the national government reassumed some powers, and the role of Premier was replaced by a position of Governor, to be held by the winner of the province-wide seat in the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea.

===Premiers (1978–1995)===

===Governors (1995–present)===

==Members of the National Parliament==

The province and each district is represented by a Member of the National Parliament. There is one provincial electorate and each district is an open electorate.

<text>Space Odyssey is a science fiction media franchise created by writer Arthur C. Clarke and filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, consisting of two films and four novels. The first novel was developed concurrently with Kubrick&#x27;s film version and published after the release of the film. The second novel was made into a feature film directed by Peter Hyams and released in 1984. Two of Clarke&#x27;s early short stories have ties to the series.

==Literature==

Short stories:
* &quot;The Sentinel&quot; – short story written in 1948 and first published in 1951 as &quot;Sentinel of Eternity&quot;
* &quot;Encounter in the Dawn&quot; – short story first published in 1953 (re-titled &quot;Encounter at Dawn&quot; or &quot;Expedition to Earth&quot; in some later collections)

Novels:
* &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; – produced concurrently with the film and released in 1968
* &quot;2010: Odyssey Two&quot; – 1982 novel, adapted as the 1984 film &quot;2010: The Year We Make Contact&quot; with screenplay by Peter Hyams
* &quot;2061: Odyssey Three&quot; – 1987 novel
* &quot;3001: The Final Odyssey&quot; – 1997 novel

Comic books:
* &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; – 1976 oversized Marvel single-issue comic book adaptation based upon the 1968 film of the same name
* &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; – ten-issue Marvel comic book series based upon the 1968 film of the same name that ran from 1976 to 1977
* &quot;2010&quot; – based on the 1984 film of the same name, originally published in &quot;Marvel Super Special&quot; #37, then again as a two-issue miniseries; both versions published by Marvel Comics in 1984

==Films==
*&quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968)
*&quot;2010: The Year We Make Contact&quot; (1984) 

===Cancelled sequels===

It was reported on Yahoo! in 2000 that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Tom Hanks were in discussions regarding turning both &quot;2061: Odyssey Three&quot; and &quot;3001: The Final Odyssey&quot; into movies (Hanks would reportedly play Frank Poole in the &quot;3001&quot; film). An update in 2001 stated that there was no further development on the project.

In November of 2014, it was reported that the U.S. cable channel Syfy had ordered a miniseries adaptation of &quot;3001: The Final Odyssey&quot; into production, planned for broadcast in 2015. The miniseries would be executive-produced by Ridley Scott, David W. Zucker and Stuart Beattie; the latter would also be the primary script-writer. The estates of both Clarke and Kubrick were reported as having &quot;offered their full support&quot;, but the extent of their involvement was not known at the time. In February 2016, the series was mentioned as one of Syfy&#x27;s &quot;in development pipeline&quot; projects during their press release for &quot;Prototype&quot;, though no further announcements have been made since that time.

==Development==

The &quot;2001&quot; screenplay was written by Clarke and Kubrick jointly, based on the seed idea in &quot;The Sentinel&quot; that an alien civilization left an object on the Moon to alert them to humankind&#x27;s attainment of space travel. In addition, the 1953 short story &quot;Encounter in the Dawn&quot; contains elements of the first section of the film, in which the ancestors of humans are apparently given an evolutionary nudge by extraterrestrials. The opening part of another Clarke story, &quot;Transience&quot;, has plot elements set in about the same time in human history, but is otherwise unrelated.

The 1972 book &quot;The Lost Worlds of 2001&quot; contains material that did not make it into the book or film.

Clarke&#x27;s first attempt to write the sequel to &quot;2001&quot; was a film screenplay, though he ultimately wrote a novel instead that was published in 1982. Clarke was not directly involved in the production of the second film, although he did communicate with writer/director Peter Hyams a great deal during the production via the then-pioneering medium of e-mail (as published in the book &quot;The Odyssey File&quot;) and also made a non-speaking cameo appearance in the film. Kubrick had no involvement in the &quot;2010&quot; novel or film, or any of the later projects.

The &quot;Space Odyssey&quot; series combines several science-fiction narrative conventions with a metaphysical tone. Since the stories and settings in the books and films all diverge, Clarke suggested that the continuity of the series represents happenings in a set of parallel universes. One notable example is that in the &quot;2001&quot; novel, the voyage was to the planet Saturn. During production of the film, it was decided that the special effects for Saturn&#x27;s rings would be too expensive, so the voyage in the film is to Jupiter instead. The second book, &quot;2010&quot;, retcons the storyline of the first book to make the destination Jupiter as seen in the film.

Clarke stated that the &quot;Time Odyssey&quot; novels are an &quot;orthoquel&quot; – a neologism coined by Clarke for this purpose, combining the word &quot;sequel&quot; with &quot;ortho-&quot;, the Greek prefix meaning &quot;straight&quot; or &quot;perpendicular&quot;, and alluding to the fact that time is orthogonal to space in relativity theory – to the &quot;Space Odyssey&quot; series.

==Characters==
* HAL 9000 is a sentient computer (or artificial intelligence) that becomes the primary antagonist of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. HAL is also in the sequel novels and the film sequel &quot;2010&quot;. In both films he is voiced by actor Douglas Rain.
* Dr. David &quot;Dave&quot; Bowman serves as the protagonist of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. The character later appears in the sequel story released first as a book, &quot;2010: Odyssey Two&quot;, and then as a movie, &quot;2010: The Year We Make Contact&quot;, albeit as a non-corporeal entity, and also returns in two more books by Arthur C. Clarke, &quot;2061: Odyssey Three&quot; and &quot;3001: The Final Odyssey&quot;. In the forewords to both &quot;2010&quot; and &quot;2061&quot;, Clarke makes it clear that the plots of the movies and books do not necessarily follow a linear arc, and should be seen as taking place in parallel universes, or as being variations of a main theme; consequently there are apparent inconsistencies in the character of David Bowman throughout the series. In the two movies, Bowman is played by Keir Dullea.
* Dr. Heywood R. Floyd first appears in &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; as being in charge of the mission to investigate the alien Monolith found on the Moon. After the events that took place in &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, he is the protagonist of &quot;2010: Odyssey Two&quot; and &quot;2061: Odyssey Three&quot;. Floyd was born in 1958 in America, and by 1999 is chairman of the National Council of Astronautics, overseeing all American spaceflight operations. He has two daughters (only one in the movies, born 1994) and was widowed when his wife Marion died in a plane crash. In &quot;2010: The Year We Make Contact&quot;, Floyd has a new wife and a five-year-old son named Christopher. Floyd was played by William Sylvester in the film version of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and by Roy Scheider in &quot;2010: The Year We Make Contact&quot;.
* Dr. Frank Poole is an astronaut aboard &quot;Discovery One&quot; on the first crewed mission to Jupiter in &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (Saturn in the novel). He and Dave Bowman are the only crew members who were not put on board in suspended animation (hibernation). His boyhood hometown was Flagstaff, Arizona, where he visited the Lowell Observatory at its museums on many occasions. These visits sparked his interest in astronomy and astronautics, and hence he went to college to study these subjects. He is the main character of &quot;3001: The Final Odyssey&quot;. In Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, Poole was portrayed by Gary Lockwood. Tom Hanks once expressed interest in directing a film version of &quot;3001&quot;, in which he would have played Poole, but this never came to fruition.
* Walter Curnow appears in the book and movie versions of &quot;2010: Odyssey Two&quot; as the American engineer who designs &quot;Discovery&quot; and helps to build &quot;Discovery II&quot; to go back to Jupiter. When the joint Soviet-American mission on the &quot;Leonov&quot; is planned instead, Curnow is one of the three American experts to go on the trip, along with Heywood Floyd and Dr. Chandra. Curnow is one of the first people to set foot on &quot;Discovery&quot; again, along with Maxim Brailovsky. Due to his engineering expertise, &quot;Discovery&quot; becomes operational again. In the 1984 film adaptation, &quot;2010: The Year We Make Contact&quot;, Curnow is played by John Lithgow.
* Dr. Sivasubramanian Chandrasegaram Pillai (often abbreviated to Dr. Chandra) is mentioned in the novel of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; as a scientist who instructed the computer HAL 9000 in its basic functions (in the film, it was instead a &quot;Mr. Langley&quot;). He is a main character in &quot;2010: Odyssey Two&quot; where it was established that he was in fact the creator of HAL, and he is a member of the joint Russian-American expedition to Jupiter on board the Soviet spacecraft &quot;Leonov&quot;. Although the character does not make any further appearances in the &quot;Space Odyssey&quot; novels, he is briefly mentioned by an elderly Heywood Floyd in the novel &quot;2061: Odyssey Three&quot;. In 2010: The Year We Make Contact, Chandra was played by Bob Balaban and is referred to as Dr. R. Chandra.

<doc id="405120" wikidata="Q1782672" url="?curid=405120" title="Noah in Islam">
<text>Noah, also known as Nuh (), is recognized in Islam as a prophet and messenger of God. He is also believed to be the first messenger sent by God. He is one of the Ulul &#x27;azm prophets. Noah&#x27;s mission was to warn his people, who were plunged in idol worshipping. God charged Noah with the duty of preaching to his people, advising them to abandon idolatry and to worship only God, and to live good and pure lives. Although he preached the Message of God with zeal, his people refused to mend their ways, leading to building the Ark and the Deluge, the Great Flood. In Islamic tradition, it is disputed whether the Great Flood was a global or a local one. Noah&#x27;s preaching and prophethood spanned 950 years according to the Quran, &quot;ahadith&quot; and &quot;tafsir&quot;.

==In the Quran==

===Praise===

Noah is praised by God in the Qur&#x27;an, which shows his great status amongst the prophets. In 17:3 of the Qur&#x27;an, God states: &quot;He was indeed a grateful servant.&quot; The Qur&#x27;an also states in a later chapter:
And also in 3:33, the Qur&#x27;an states: &quot;Indeed, Allah chose Adam, Noah, the family of Abraham, and the family of ’Imrân above all people ˹of their time˺.

===Story===
According to the Qur&#x27;an, Noah was inspired by God like other prophets—such as Ibrāhīm (Abraham), Ismā&#x27;īl (Ishmael), Ishaq (Isaac), Ya&#x27;qub (Jacob), Isa (Jesus), Ilyas (Elijah), Ayyub (Job), Harun (Aaron), Yunus (Jonah), Dawud (David) and Muhammad—and was a faithful messenger. Noah had firm belief in tawhid (the oneness of God), and preached Islam (literally &quot;submission,&quot; meaning submission to God).

He continuously warned the people of the painful doom that was coming and asked them to accept one God instead of worshipping idols such as Wadd, Suwa&#x27;, Yaghuth, Ya&#x27;uq and Nasr. He called the people to serve God, and said that nobody but God could save them. He said that the time of the deluge was appointed and could not be delayed, and that the people had to submit to God.

God commanded Noah to build a ship, the Ark, and as he was building it, the chieftains passed him and mocked him. Upon its completion, the ship is said to be loaded with pairs of every animal, and Noah&#x27;s household, and a group of believers who did submit to God. The people who denied the message of Noah, including one of his own sons, drowned. The final resting place of the ship was referred to as &quot;Al-Jūdiyy&quot; or a &quot;Munzalanm-Mubārakan&quot; (). Noah is called a grateful servant. Both Noah and Abraham were taught the prophethood and the scripture. According to Shi&#x27;a tafsir (exegesis), God commanded Noah to take all species that he needed on the ship. The commentary by Prophetic descendants explains the verse to mean eight animals.

==Traditional narrative in Islam==
According to Islam, he was a prophet, sent to warn mankind of that region and his people to change their ways. He conveyed the message for over 950 years. Islamic literature recounts that in the Generations of Adam, many men and women continued to follow Adam&#x27;s original teachings, worshiping God alone and remaining righteous. Among Adam&#x27;s descendants there were many brave and pious men, greatly loved and revered by their respective communities. Exegesis goes on to narrate that, upon the death of these elders, people felt enormous grief and some felt prompted to make statues of these people in remembrance of them. Then gradually, through the generations many forgot what such statues were for and began to worship them, (as the Shaytan (Satan) slowly deceived each generation) along with many other idols. In order to guide the people, God appointed Noah with the duty of being the next prophet to humanity.

===Early preaching===
According to Islamic belief, Noah began preaching to his people both verbally and through example. He would praise God consistently and he urged his people to do the same, warning his tribe of the punishment they would face if they did not mend their ignorant ways. The Qur&#x27;an states that Noah repeatedly told his people:
Though a few were moved by Noah&#x27;s words, the powerful and wealthy members of the tribe refused to hear his call. The unbelievers at the time were impelled to rebel by various evil motives. Firstly, they were extremely envious and jealous of men superior to them in any way. Secondly, the people were ignorant of the weak and lowly, who were frequently superior intellectually, morally and spiritually. As a result of their ignorance, they were arrogant and mocked all who they felt were inferior to them. They would ask Noah, &quot;Shall we believe in you, when the inferior follow you?&quot; Noah would respond: &quot;Their account is only with my Lord, if you could (but) know.&quot; When Noah preached the faith of God to them, all they did was revile the messenger, abuse the Message, and refer to the whole warning as a lie. He then went on to explain the Prophetic Message in greater depth, ensuring them that it was not a message of destruction but it was a message with the mercy from God, and that their acts would lead to destruction if they did not accept the faith. He questioned them, asking why they would not accept what would benefit them in the near future. Noah went onto further, and told his community that he asked of no reward from them, telling them his only reward would be from God. But his people threatened him with being stoned.

===Accusation===
As time passed, Noah became firmer in his preaching. When the unbelievers began insulting those who accepted God&#x27;s message, believing that Noah would send those faithful away to attract the wealthy unbelievers, Noah revealed that they—the arrogant and ignorant rich—were the wicked and sinful ones. His people accused him of being soothsayer or diviner. Noah declared that he was by no means a mere fortune-teller, pretending to reveal secrets which are not worth revealing. Noah also denied accusations claiming he was an angel, always maintaining that he was a human messenger. When the people refused to acknowledge their sinfulness Noah told them that it was not Noah, but God that would punish them - however God pleased.

===Prayer===
The Qur&#x27;an states that Noah prayed to God, complaining that his preaching only made his people disbelieve further. Noah told God how they had obstinately refused to accept the message, so that the light of the truth should not affect their thinking. Noah told God how he had used all the resources of the classical preacher, conveying the message both in public places and with individuals in private. Noah spoke of how he had told the people the rewards they would receive if they became righteous, namely that God would supply plentiful rain as a blessing, and that God would also guarantee them an increase in children and wealth.

===Building of the Ark===
According to the Quran, one day, Noah received a revelation from God, in which he was told that no one would believe the message, aside from the few who had already submitted to God. Noah&#x27;s frustration at the defiance of his people led him to ask God to not leave even one sinner from the people he was sent to; not the whole earth like in the Bible. Although there is no proof that God accepted his prayer (as there are many examples of accepted prayers, such as in case of Yunus, Lut (Lot), Suleyman (Solomon) etc., even Noah&#x27;s prayer in some other shape was accepted), God decreed that a terrible flood would come (and yet, Qur&#x27;an doesn&#x27;t say it came to cover whole Earth) and He ordered Noah to build a ship () which would save him and the believers from this dreadful calamity. Ever-obedient to God&#x27;s instructions, Noah went out in search of material with which to construct the vessel. When Noah began building the Ark, the people who saw him at work laughed and mocked at him even more than before. Their conclusion was that he was surely a madman; they could not find any other reason why a man would build a huge vessel when no sea or river was nearby. Although Noah was now very old, the aged patriarch continued to work tirelessly until, at last, the Ark was finished.

===Family===
Little is known of Noah&#x27;s personal history before his call to prophecy. However, Ibn Kathir records him to have been the son of Lamech and grandson of Methuselah, one of the patriarchs from the Generations of Adam. Noah was neither the leader of the tribe nor a very rich man but, even before being called to prophecy, he worshiped God faithfully and was, in the words of the Qur&#x27;an, &quot;a devotee most grateful&quot;.

Noah was married to a woman whose name is not mentioned in the Quran. Some Islamic historians such as Al-Tabari have suggested that the name of Noah&#x27;s wife was Umzarah bint Barakil but this cannot be confirmed. Most Muslims simply call her by her midrashic name Naamah. 

The Quran states that Noah&#x27;s wife was not a believer with him so she did not join him. The sons of Noah are not expressly mentioned in the Qur&#x27;an, except for the fact that one of the sons was among the people who did not follow his own father, not among the believers and thus was washed away in the flood. Also the Qur&#x27;an indicates a great calamity, enough to have destroyed Noah&#x27;s people, but to have saved him and his generations to come.
Noah&#x27;s wife (Naamah) is referred to in the Qur&#x27;an as an evil woman. When God emphasizes upon the notion that everyone is for themselves on the Day of Judgement and that marital relations will not be to your aid when the judgement takes place, the Qur&#x27;an says:

 In contrast, the wife of the Pharaoh of the Exodus, Asiya, and Mary, the mother of Jesus, are referred to as among the best of women. This adds to the notion that, on the Last Day, everyone will be judged according to their own deeds. The &quot;Stories of The Prophets&quot; explain that the son who declined to embark was a non-believer.

===Searches for Noah&#x27;s Ark===

&quot;Searches for Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot; have been reported since antiquity, as ancient scholars sought to affirm the historicity of the Genesis flood narrative by citing accounts of relics recovered from the Ark. With the emergence of biblical archaeology in the 19th century, the potential of a formal search attracted interest in alleged discoveries and hoaxes. By the 1940s, expeditions were being organized to follow up on these purported leads. This modern search movement has been informally called &quot;arkeology&quot;.

In 2020, the young Earth creationist group the Institute for Creation Research acknowledged that, despite many expeditions, Noah&#x27;s Ark had not been found and is unlikely to be found. Many of the supposed findings and methods used in the search are regarded as pseudoscience and pseudoarchaeology by geologists and archaeologists.

===Ashure===
There is a Turkish dessert in remembrance of Noah, which is called &quot;Ashure&quot; or &quot;Noah&#x27;s pudding&quot;. It is made out of grains, nuts, and dried and fresh fruits. These are believed to be the few ingredients left on the ark, used by Noah and his family to celebrate the end of the flood.

===Tomb===

There are several sites that are claimed to be the Tomb of Noah:
* Noah&#x27;s Mausoleum in Cizre, Şırnak, Turkey
* Noah&#x27;s Mausoleum (Sunni Islam) in Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan
* Karak Nuh, Beqaa, Lebanon

<text>Robert Julian Yeatman (15 July 1897 – 13 July 1968) was a British humourist who wrote for &quot;Punch&quot;. He is best known for the book &quot;1066 and All That&quot;, a tongue-in-cheek guide to &quot;all the history you can remember&quot;, which he wrote with W. C. Sellar.

Yeatman was born in Chelsea, London. He spent some of his early years in Oporto, the principal city and port of northern Portugal, where his father worked as a port wine merchant, a family business connected with Taylor&#x27;s Port. From 1911 he was educated at Marlborough College. In World War I he was commissioned into the Royal Field Artillery. Serving in France, he won the Military Cross and was severely wounded. After the war he attended Oriel College, Oxford, where he met Sellar. Yeatman then worked as a journalist before becoming advertising manager for Kodak Ltd. 

When asked to convert his BA from Oxford into an MA, Yeatman could not find the fee owing to debt, and hence he is recorded in &quot;1066 and All That&quot; as &quot;Failed M.A., etc. Oxon&quot;.

With ambitions to be a writer, Yeatman contributed humorous pieces to &quot;Punch&quot; from 1926, with &quot;1066 and All That&quot; published in 1930, which was an immediate success. Three further joint ventures with Sellar followed: &quot;And Now All This&quot; (1932), &quot;Horse Nonsense&quot; (1933), and &quot;Garden Rubbish&quot; (1936), all selling well but without the popular success of &quot;1066&quot;.

Yeatman rejoined the army in 1940, serving as a captain in the Royal Artillery, then working for the Ministry of Information from 1943 until 1949. Afterwards he was employed as a copywriter, retiring in 1962.

<text>Hūd (), sometimes called Eber, is believed in Islam to have been a messenger sent to pre-Islamic Arabia. Hud is repeatedly mentioned in the Quran, whose eleventh chapter is also named after him (although a small portion of it is actually about him).

== Historical context ==


Hud has sometimes been identified with Eber, an ancestor of the Ishmaelites and the Israelites who is mentioned in the Old Testament.

Hud is said to have been a subject of a &quot;mulk&quot; (, kingdom) named after its founder, &#x27;Ad, a fourth-generation descendant of Noah (his father being Uz, the son of Aram, who was the son of Shem, who in turn was a son of Noah):

The other tribes said to be present at this time in Arabia, were the Thamud, Jurhum, Tasam, Jadis, Amim, Midian, Amalek Imlaq, Jasim, Qahtan, Banu Yaqtan and others.

The Quran gives the location of ʿĀd as being &quot;Al-Aḥqāf&quot; (, &quot;The Sandy Plains&quot;, or &quot;The Wind-curved Sand-hills&quot;). It is believed to have been in South Arabia, possibly in eastern Yemen and/or western Oman. In November 1991, a settlement was discovered and hypothesized to be Ubar, which is thought to be mentioned in the Qur&#x27;an as &quot;Iram dhāt al-ʿImād&quot; (&quot;Iram of the Pillars&quot; or &quot;Iram of the tentpoles&quot;), and may have been the capital of ʿĀd. One of the members of the original expedition, archeologist Juris Zarins, however, later concluded that the discovery did not represent a city called Ubar. In a 1996 interview on the subject, he said:

The Moroccan mystic Abdulaziz ad-Dabbagh gives detailed information about Hud: According to him, alludes to the fact that Hud was sent to the second ʿAd tribe, which lived after Noah. The first &#x27;Ad tribe had a messenger named Huwayd, whose message was to be revived by Hud, and the tribe was destroyed with stones and fire by God. Hud was Eber&#x27;s son (see Eber in Islam for his genealogy) and Iram was the name of one of the tribes of &#x27;Ad, specifically the one Hud was sent to (see Iram in the Qur&#x27;an).

== Narrative in the Quran ==

&quot;This is a brief summary of Hud&#x27;s narrative, with emphasis on two particular verses&quot;:

The people of ʿĀd were extremely powerful and wealthy and they built countless buildings and monuments to show their power. However, the ʿĀd people&#x27;s wealth ultimately proved to be their source of pride, as they became arrogant and forsook God and began to adopt idols for worship, including three named &quot;Samd&quot;, &quot;Samud&quot; and &quot;Hara&quot;. Hud, even in childhood, remained consistent in prayer to God. It is related through exegesis that Hud&#x27;s mother, a pious woman who had seen great visions at her son&#x27;s birth, was the only person who encouraged Hud in his worship. Thus, the Lord raised up Hud as a prophet for the ʿĀd people. According to a tafsir of the whole &quot;Surah Hud&quot; by scholars, the &#x27;Ad were a powerful empire that preceded the era of Abraham and Nimrod, and they were tyrannically oppressive towards other civilizations at that time.

When Hud started preaching and invited them to the worship of only the true God and when he told them to repent for their past sins and ask for mercy and forgiveness, the ʿĀd people began to revile him and wickedly began to mock God&#x27;s message. Hud&#x27;s story epitomizes the prophetic cycle common to the early prophets mentioned in the Quran: the prophet is sent to his people to tell them to worship God only and tells them to acknowledge that it is God who is the provider of their blessings The Quran states:

=== Miracle ===
According to a &quot;tafsir&quot; from Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya in his book of analysis, &quot;Madaarij Saalikeen&quot;, which has been quoted by Ibn Abi al-Izz in his &quot;syarh&quot; (commentary) of Al-Aqida al-Tahawiyya, Hud has a miracle, which is pointed by the verse of 54-57:

Both Ibn Qayyim and Ibn Abi al-Izz, examining this chain of verses as the occurrence when Hud fought alone against entire nation of &#x27;Ad, the entire city was about to harm him both psychologically and physically, only to be defeated by miraculous power shown by Hud, which resulted from his firm belief to the protection from God. Umar Sulaiman Al-Ashqar, a Salafi scholar of Tafsir, quoted this literation in his book, while his brother, Muhammad Sulaiman Al Ashqar, professor of Islamic University of Madinah, also implied his support of this narrative about Hud&#x27;s miracle, in his own tafsir, &quot;Zubdat at Tafsir Min Fath al Qadir&quot;. The miracle is further highlighted by Firanda Andirja, lecturer of &quot;Al-Masjid al-Haram&quot;.

=== Calamity upon ʿĀd ===
After Hud has been left alone by the people of ʿĀd for a long time. The majority of them, however, refused to pay any notice to his teachings and they kept ignoring and mocking all he said. As their aggression, arrogance and idolatry deepened, God, after plenty of warning, sent a thunderous storm to finish the wicked people of ʿĀd once and for all. The destruction of the ʿĀd is described in the Quran:

The King Saud University from The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia stated the interpretation from Al-Tabari of Quran were narrated about the disaster which caused the extinction of ʿĀd. Wahbah al-Zuhayli, Salih bin Abdullah al Humaid, Imam of Grand Mosque of Mecca, along with the officials of  Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Dawah and Guidance also agreed the verse were speaking about the punishment from God towards ʿĀd peoples.

Meanwhile, another Quran verse that describe further the characteristic of winds that bear calamity were Adh-Dhariyat:
Exegesis experts translate &quot;Ar-Rīḥ al-ʿAqīm&quot; () literally as &quot;fruitless wind&quot; or &quot;barren wind&quot;, a wind that does not bring benefit or any positive reaction to any biological existences. According to Arabic linguists and tafseer experts who examined &quot;al-Aqeem&quot;, its literal form is &quot;sterile&quot; in this verse&#x27;s context, which correlates the antithesis of common characteristic of natural winds that usually benefitted the natural cycle, or any biological progressions or reproductions, whether for humans, animals or plants.

In addition for its barren characteristic, another verse also described additional features about the catastrophic tornado which decimated the &#x27;Ad is in &quot;Surah Al-Qamar&quot;:
Exegesis experts describe &quot;ar-Rīḥ ash-Sharshar&quot; (, the cold and harsh wind) as literally freezing yet possess thunderous deafening voice, and according to Tafsir Ibn Kathir, the strength of such punishing winds alone has squeezed the peoples of Ad inside out, until their intestines came out from their rectum and mouths. Nevertheless, modern contemporary scholars such as Al-Tahawi, Wahbah al-Zuhayli, and other scholars from Islamic University of Madinah and Saudi religious ministry has interpreted the verses of Al-Qamar from 18th verse to the 20th verse were narrating the story about the process of the calamity upon ʿĀd.

== In the hadith ==
There are several hadiths from various chains that became supporting materials regarding Calamity that has fallen upon the ʿĀd peoples, such as: 
* Abdulaziz al-Tarefe gave commentary in his book, &quot;Aqida al Khurasaniyya&quot;, regarding Hadith came from Abu Sa&#x27;id al-Khudri, where Muhammad has mentioned the threat of Kharijites: &quot;From this one&#x27;s stock there will be people who recite the Quran, but it will not pass down their throats. They will sever from Islam and leave the worshippers of Idols alone; but if I live up to their time I shall certainly kill them as &#x27;Ad were killed (by Hud).&quot; The Hadith has recorded in Al-Nasa&#x27;i, Sahih al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, and Sunan Abu Dawood, which all graded authentic by Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani.
* Another mention of the calamity of &#x27;Ad from Hadith came from the narration of Ibn Abbas and recorded in Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim during the battle of the trench, when the polytheists coalition army encampment were struck by storm, that Muhammad as said: &quot;I have been made victorious with &quot;As-Saba&quot; (easterly wind) and the people of &#x27;Ad were destroyed by &quot;Ad-Dabur&quot; (westerly wind).&quot;

== Place of burial ==

Several sites are revered as the tomb of Hud. The most noted site, &quot;Qabr Hud&quot;, is located in a village in Hadhramaut, Yemen, and is a place of frequent Muslim pilgrimage. Robert Bertram Serjeant, in his study of the pilgrimage rite to the tomb of Hud, verified on the spot the facts related by Al-Harawi, who described, at the gate of the Mosque, on the west side, the rock onto which Hud climbed to make the call to prayer, and mentioned the grotto of &quot;Balhut&quot; at the bottom of the ravine. Around the tomb and neighborhood, various ancient ruins and inscriptions have been found. However, as is often the case with the graves of prophets, other locations have been listed. A possible location for his &quot;qabr&quot; (, grave) is said to be near the Zamzam Well in Saudi Arabia, or in the south wall of the Umayyad Mosque in Syria. Some scholars have added that the Masjid has an inscription stating: &quot;Haḏā Maqām Hūd&quot; (, &quot;This is (the) Tomb of Hud&quot;); others, however, suggest that this belief is a local tradition spewing from the reverence the locals have for Hud.

== In other religions ==
Hud is referred to in the Baháʼí Faith as a Prophet who appeared after Noah and prior to Abraham, who exhorted the people to abandon idolatry and practice monotheism. His endeavors to save His people resulted in their &quot;willful blindness&quot; and His rejection.

Judaism and Christianity do not venerate Hud as a prophet and, as a figure, he is absent from the Bible. However, there are several pre-Quranic references in Palmyrene inscription to individuals named Hud or possessing a name which is connected to &quot;Hud&quot; as well as references to the people of ʿĀd.

Sellar was born at Golspie in Sutherland, the descendant of Patrick Sellar who had taken a leading role in the Highland clearances and a relative of William Young Sellar, a Scottish classical scholar.

He won a scholarship to Fettes College where he was Head Boy in 1917. He left school at the height of the First World War, and joined the British Army. Having attended an Officer Cadet Unit, he was commissioned in the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers as a second lieutenant on 31 October 1917. He took a degree in modern history at Oriel College, Oxford (which, as recorded in &quot;1066 and All That&quot;, was awarded through an aegrotat in 1922).

It was at Oriel that he met his contemporary Yeatman, and struck up a lifelong friendship. Although the two produced brilliant work together, they were entirely different personalities: Sellar was somewhat shy and introverted, although he enjoyed acting. He wrote melancholy poetry in addition to dry humour.

==Teaching career==
On leaving Oriel, Sellar worked as a schoolmaster at his old school Fettes, leaving in 1928 when he moved to Great Marlow in Buckinghamshire in the hope of becoming a full-time writer.

However, the financial burdens of bringing up two daughters led him to take a job at Canford School in Dorset from the start of the school year in 1929, and he went on to teach at Charterhouse School from 1932 until his death. At first he taught history, but later moved to teach English and he became Housemaster of Daviesites from 1939. He used his own ration and money to buy extra food for the boys of the House during World War II, which made him very popular.

During the period 1946-1950 he was again teaching history at Charterhouse, and even in his late years Sellar retained his sense of humour, for example putting on as the school play one year two trials. The first, in which he was somehow simultaneously the King of Spain and the Lord Chief Justice of England, was the trial of Christopher Columbus (played by the Head Boy) for the heinous crime of discovering America. The second, in his words &quot;the most important negligence trial in history&quot; was of course the trial of Guy Fawkes &quot;in that he did fail to blow up the Houses of Parliament&quot;. The boys (Charterhouse was all-male in those days) all loved this (and also his habit of throwing blackboard rubbers at the headmaster!).

==Writing==
Sellar had begun to contribute to &quot;Punch&quot; in 1925 when three humorous short stories of his were published (he also contributed to other journals around this time). His collaboration with his old University colleague Yeatman, who was also writing for &quot;Punch&quot;, appears to have begun in 1928 during his period out of teaching. The first part of &quot;1066 and All That&quot; appeared in &quot;Punch&quot; on 10 September 1930, taking its title from Robert Graves&#x27; autobiography &quot;Good-Bye to All That&quot;. Sellar&#x27;s contribution is particularly noted in the comic exaggerations and name confusions; his knowledge of English literature also inspired the book&#x27;s many literary allusions and pastiches.

After completing the book, Sellar worked with Yeatman again on a sequel, &quot;And Now All This&quot;, a parody of general knowledge, including subjects as diverse as geography, knitting and topology.

The 1933 book &quot;Horse Nonsense&quot; was credited to the two but is largely the work of Yeatman, while &quot;Garden Rubbish and Other Country Bumps&quot; is also credited to the two but largely Sellar&#x27;s work.

<doc id="405128" wikidata="Q326189" url="?curid=405128" title="Salih">
<text>Saleh () is a prophet mentioned in the Qur&#x27;an who prophesied to the tribe of Thamud in ancient Arabia, before the lifetime of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The story of Salih is linked to the story of the She-Camel of God, which was the gift given by God to the people of Thamud when they desired a miracle to confirm that Salih was truly a prophet.

== Historical context ==
The Thamud were a tribal confederation in the northwestern region of the Arabian Peninsula, mentioned in Assyrian sources in the time of Sargon II. The tribe&#x27;s name continues to appear in documents into the fourth century CE, but by the sixth century they were regarded as a group that had vanished long ago.

According to the Quran, the city that Saleh was sent to was called &quot;Al-Hijr&quot; (), which corresponds to the Nabataean city of Hegra. The city rose to prominence around the 1st century AD as an important site in the regional caravan trade. Adjacent to the city were large, decorated rock-cut tombs used by members of various religious groups. At an unknown point in ancient times, the site was abandoned and possibly functionally replaced by Al-&#x27;Ula. The site has been referred to as &quot;Mada&#x27;in Salih&quot; () since the era of Muhammad and was named after his predecessor Salih.

Saleh is not mentioned in any historical texts or in any of the Abrahamic scriptures that precede the Qur&#x27;an, but the account of Thamud&#x27;s destruction may have been well known in ancient Arabia. The tribe&#x27;s name is used in ancient Arabian poetry as a metaphor for &quot;the transience of all things&quot;.

== In Islam ==

=== Qur&#x27;an ===
According to Muslim tradition, the people of Thamud virtually relied upon Saleh for support. He was chosen by God as a prophet () and sent to preach against the selfishness of the wealthy and to condemn the practice of &quot;shirk&quot; (). Although Saleh preached for a sustained period of time, the people of Thamud refused to hear his warning and instead began to ask Saleh to perform a miracle for them. They said: “O Ṣâliḥ! We truly had high hopes in you before this. How dare you forbid us to worship what our forefathers had worshipped? We are certainly in alarming doubt about what you are inviting us to.”

Saleh reminded his people of the castles and palaces they built out of stone, and of their technological superiority over neighbouring communities. Furthermore, he told them about their ancestors, the ʿĀd tribe, and how they too were destroyed for their sins. Some of the people of Thamud believed Saleh&#x27;s words, but the tribal leaders refused to listen to him and continued to demand that he demonstrate a miracle to prove his prophethood.

In response, God gave the Thamud a blessed she-camel (), as both a means of sustenance and a test. The tribe was told to allow the camel to graze peacefully and avoid harming her. But in defiance of Saleh&#x27;s warning, the people of the tribe hamstrung the camel. Saleh informed them that they had only three more days to live before the wrath of God descended upon them. The people of the city were remorseful, but their crime could not be undone, and all the disbelieving people in the city were killed in an earthquake. Al-Hijr was rendered uninhabited and remained in ruins for all time thereafter. Saleh himself and the few believers who followed him survived.

The story is expanded upon in Sūrat an-Naml of the Qur&#x27;an. Whilst the she-camel is not mentioned explicitly in this chapter, it states that nine men plotted to kill Salih and his whole family, a crime for which they were struck down by God three days later.

=== Muslim tradition ===
Muslim writers have elaborated upon the story of Saleh and the she-camel. Early Islamic tradition often involved a motif of the camel miraculously emerging from stone, often accompanied by a calf, and the production of milk from the camel. Al-Tabari states that Saleh summoned his people to a mountain, where they witnessed the rock miraculously split open, revealing the camel. The she-camel had a young calf. Saleh informed the Thamud that the older camel was to drink from their water source on one day, and they were to drink from it the next day. On days when they were not allowed to drink water, the camel provided them with milk. But God informed Saleh that a boy who would hamstring the camel would soon be born to the tribe, and that child was evil and grew unnaturally fast. The camel was indeed killed, and its calf cried out three times, signaling that the Thamud would be destroyed in three days. Their faces turned yellow, then red, then black, and they died on the third day as predicted.

According to some Islamic scholars, the mother of Ismail, Hajar, was a granddaughter of Saleh.

A similar tradition is related in an eighth-century commentary on Islam by John of Damascus and is also mentioned in the works of Ibn Kathir.

<doc id="405130" wikidata="Q206275" url="?curid=405130" title="Pérotin">
<text>Pérotin () was a composer associated with the Notre Dame school of polyphony in Paris and the broader musical style of high medieval music. He is credited with developing the polyphonic practices of his predecessor Léonin, with the introduction of three and four-part harmonies.

Other than a brief mention by music theorist Johannes de Garlandia in his &quot;De Mensurabili Musica&quot;, virtually all information on Pérotin&#x27;s life comes from Anonymous IV, a pseudonymous English student who probably studied in Paris. Anonymous IV names seven titles from a &quot;Magnus Liber&quot;—including &quot;Viderunt omnes&quot;, &quot;Sederunt principes&quot; and &quot;Alleluia Nativitas&quot;—that have been identified with surviving works and gives him the title &quot;Magister Perotinus&quot; (Pérotinus the Master), meaning he was licensed to teach. It is assumed that Perotinus was French and named Pérotin, a diminutive of Peter, but attempts to match him with persons in contemporary documents remain speculative.
== Identity and career ==
Pérotin, about whom little is known, most likely lived around the end of the 12th and beginning of the 13th century and is presumed to have been French. The closest thing to a contemporary account of his life comes from two much later reporters: a brief mention attributed to the music theorist Johannes de Garlandia () in his &quot;De Mensurabili Musica&quot;, and four mentions in the works of a late 13c English student known as Anonymous IV. At one stage Anonymous IV was thought to be a pupil of Johannes de Garlandia, but this is unlikely, and the name is a misnomer, derived from the title of notes by Charles-Edmond-Henri de Coussemaker, &quot;Anonymus IV&quot;. These were probably notes taken by the student in lecture. including this paragraph:
These rules were used in many older books; this was so during and after the time of Perotinus the Great. Nevertheless, they did not know how to distinguish these notes from those which will be presented shortly. This was so even since the time of Leo, because two ligated notes were put for the durational value of a &quot;brevis longa&quot;, and in a similar manner, three ligated notes were quite often used for a &quot;longa brevis, longa&quot;. People say Maître Leonin was the best composer of Organum (optimus organista), he composed the Great Organum Book for the gradual and antiphonary in order to prolong the divine service. This book remained in use until the time of the great Perotin who abridged it and composed clausules and sections that were many in number and better because he was the best composer of descant (optimus discantor). This Magister Perotinus made the best quadrupla, such as &quot;Viderunt&quot; and &quot;Sederunt&quot;, with an abundance of striking musical embellishments [&quot;colores armonicae artis&quot;]; likewise, the noblest tripla, such as &quot;Alleluia, Posui adiutorium&quot; and &quot;[Alleluia]&quot;, &quot;Nativitas&quot; etc. He also made three-voice conductus, such as &quot;Salvatoris hodie&quot;, and two-voice conductus, such as &quot;Dum sigillum summi Patris&quot;, and also, among many others, monophonic conductus, such as &quot;Beata viscera&quot; etc. The book, that is, the books of Magister Perotinus, were in use in the choir of the Paris cathedral of the Blessed Virgin up to the time of Magister Robertus de Sabilone, and from his time up to the present day.

There have been many speculative attempts to identify Pérotin with members of the Notre Dame administration, but these have not generally been accepted. Of the several people with that name (&quot;Petrus&quot;) that have been suggested, the commonest are Petrus Cantor (died 1197), who was a theologian, and another Petrus who was Succentor at Notre Dame ca. 1207–1238. Of these two, Petrus Succentor has been suggested as more probable, in part on chronological grounds, and partly because of the succentor&#x27;s role in overseeing the celebration of the liturgy in the cathedral (whose choir was dedicated 1182), but this is purely speculative, resting on an assumption that the composer held some important rank in the cathedral hierarchy.

Pérotin is considered to be the most important member of the Notre Dame school of polyphony, a group of composers working at or near the cathedral in Paris from about 1160 to 1250, creators of the style. The dates of Pérotin&#x27;s life and works have long been a subject of debate, but are generally thought to be from about 1155/60 (or earlier) to around 1200/05 (or later), based on the evolution of French choral writing during this time (see Works), in particular, his apparent absence from the flowering of the French motet that occurred after 1210.

Pérotin was one of very few composers of his day whose name has been preserved, and can be reliably attached to individual compositions, most of which have been transcribed. Anonymous IV called him &quot;Magister Perotinus&quot; (Pérotinus the Master). The title, employed also by Johannes de Garlandia, means that Perotinus, like Léonin, earned the degree &quot;magister artium&quot;, almost certainly in Paris, and that he was licensed to teach. However, only Anonymous IV employed the epithet &quot;Perotinus Magnus&quot; (Perotinus the Great). The name Perotinus, the Latin diminutive of Petrus, is assumed to be derived from the French name Pérotin, diminutive of Pierre. However &quot;Petrus&quot; was one of the most common names in the Ile de France during the High Middle Ages, making further identification difficult. The diminutive was presumably a mark of respect bestowed by his colleagues. The title &quot;Magnus&quot; was a mark of the esteem in which he was held, even long after his death.

== Historical context ==
=== Notre Dame School ===

The reign of Louis VII (1137–1180) witnessed a period of cultural innovation, in which appeared the Notre Dame school of musical composition, and the contributions of Léonin, who prepared two-part choral settings (&quot;organa&quot;) for all the major liturgical festivals. This period in musical history has been described as a paradigm shift of lasting consequence in musical notation and rhythmic composition, with the development of the &quot;organum&quot;, &quot;clausula&quot;, &quot;conductus&quot; and motet. The innovative nature of the Notre Dame style stands in contrast to its predecessor, that of the Abbey of St Martial, Limoges, replacing the monodic (monophonic) Gregorian chant with polyphony (more than one voice singing at a time). This was the beginning of polyphonic European church music. &quot;Organum&quot; at its roots involves simple doubling (&quot;organum duplum&quot; or &quot;organum purum&quot;) of a chant at intervals of a fourth or fifth, above or below. This school also marked a transition from music that was essentially performance to a less ephemeral entity that was committed to parchment, preserved and transmitted to history. It is also the beginning of the idea of composers and compositions, the introduction of more than two voices and the treatment of vernacular texts. For the first time, rhythm became as important as pitch, to the extent that the music of this era came to be known as &quot;musica mensurabilis&quot; (music that can be measured). These developments and the notation that evolved laid the foundations of musical practice for centuries. The surviving manuscripts from the thirteenth century together with the contemporaneous treatises on musical theory constitute the musical era of . The Notre Dame repertory spread throughout Europe. In Paris polyphony was being performed in the late 1190s but later sources imply that some of the compositions date back as far as the 1160s. Although often linked to the construction of the cathedral itself, construction commenced in 1163 and the altar consecrated in 1182. However, there was evidence of musical creativity there from the early twelfth century.

Léonin&#x27;s work was distinguished by two distinctive &quot;organum&quot; styles, &quot;purum&quot; and &quot;discantus&quot;. This early polyphonic &quot;organa&quot; was still firmly based on Gregorian chant, to which a second voice was added. The chant was called the &quot;tenor&quot; (&quot;cantus firmus&quot; or &quot;vox principalis&quot;), which literally &quot;holds&quot; (Latin: &quot;tenere&quot;) the melody. The &quot;tenor&quot; is based on an existing plainsong melody from the liturgical repertoire (such as the &quot;Alleluia&quot;, Verse or Gradual, from the Mass, or a Responsory or &quot;Benedicamus&quot; from the Office). This quotation of plainchant melody is a defining characteristic of thirteenth century musical genres. In &quot;organum purum&quot; the &quot;tenor&quot; part was drawn out into long pedal points, while the upper part or &quot;duplum&quot; contrasted with it in a much freer rhythm, consisting of melisms (melismatic or several notes per syllable, compared to syllabic, a single note per syllable). In the second, &quot;discantus&quot;, style, the &quot;tenor&quot; was allowed to be melismatic, and the notes were quicker and more regular with the upper part becoming equally rhythmic. These more rhythmic sections were known as clausulae (puncta). Another innovation was the standardization of note forms, and Léonin&#x27;s new square notes were quickly adopted. Although he developed the discantus style, Léonin&#x27;s strength was as a writer of &quot;organum purum&quot;. The singing of &quot;organa&quot; fell into disuse by the mid thirteenth century. Associated with the Notre Dame school, was Johannes de Garlandia, whose &quot;De mensurabili&quot; provided a theoretical basis, for Notre Dame polyphony is essentially &quot;musica mensurabilis&quot;, music that is measured in time. In his treatise, he defines three forms of polyphony, &quot;organum in speciali&quot;, copula, and discant, which are defined by the relationship of the voices to each other and by the rhythmic flow of each voice.

=== &quot;Magnus liber organi&quot; ===
Léonin compiled his compositions into a book, the &quot;Magnus liber organi&quot; (Great Organum Book), around 1160. Pérotin&#x27;s works are preserved in this compilation of early polyphonic church music, which was in the collection of the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris. The &quot;Magnus liber&quot; also contains the work of his successors. In addition to two-part organa, this book contains three- and four-part compositions in four distinct forms: &quot;organa&quot;, &quot;clausulae&quot;, &quot;conducti&quot; and motets, and three distinct styles. In the organum style the upper voices are highly mobile over a &quot;tenor&quot; voice moving in long unmeasured notes. The discant style has the &quot;tenor&quot; moving in measured notes, but still more slowly than the upper voices. The third style has all voices moving note on note, and is largely limited to &quot;conductus&quot;. The surviving sources all commence with a four-voice organal setting of the Christmas Gradual, &quot;Viderunt omnes fines terrae&quot; (), believed to be Pérotin&#x27;s, as most likely did the original &quot;Liber&quot;. However, the manuscripts and fragments that survive date well into the thirteenth century, meaning that they are preserved in a form notated by musicians working several generations following Léonin and Pérotin. This collection of music constitutes the earliest known record of polyphony to have the stability and circulation achieved earlier by monophonic Gregorian chant.

==Music==
=== Forms and style ===

Louis VII was succeeded by his son Philip II in 1179 and his reign was marked by integration and revision of the cultural shifts that had transpired under his father. It was during this time that the compositions of Pérotin first appeared, and a shift towards a more predominant &quot;discantus&quot; style. Pérotin is best known for his composition of both liturgical &quot;organa&quot; and non-liturgical &quot;conducti&quot; in which the voices move note on note. He pioneered the styles of &quot;organum triplum&quot; and &quot;organum quadruplum&quot; (three and four-part polyphony) and his &quot;Viderunt omnes&quot; and &quot;Sederunt principes et adversum me loquebantur&quot; () Graduals for Christmas and the feast of St Stephen&#x27;s Day (26 December) respectively are among only a few &quot;organa quadrupla&quot; known, early polyphony having been restricted to two-part compositions. With the addition of further parts, the compositions became known as motets, the most important form of polyphony of the period. Pérotin&#x27;s two Graduals for the Christmas season represent the highest point of his style, with a large scale tonal design in which the massive pedal points sustain the swings between consecutive harmonies, and an intricate interplay among the three upper voices. Pérotin also furthered the development of musical notation, moving it further from improvisation. Despite this, we know nothing of how these works came about.

In addition to his own compositions, as noted by Anonymous IV, Pérotin set about revising the &quot;Magnus liber organi&quot;. Léonin&#x27;s added &quot;duplum&quot; required skill, and had to be sung fast with up to 40 notes to one of the underlying chant, as a result of which the actual text progressed very slowly. Pérotin shortened these passages, while adding further voice parts to enrich the harmony. The degree to which he did this has been debated due to the phrase &quot;abbreviavit eundem&quot; by Anonymous IV. Usually translated as abbreviate, it has been surmised that he shortened the &quot;Magnus liber&quot; by replacing &quot;organum purum&quot; with discant clausulae or simply replacing existing clausulae with shorter ones. Some 154 clausulae have been attributed to Pérotin but many other clausulae are elaborate compositions that would actually expand the compositions in the &quot;Liber&quot;, and these stylistically resemble his known works which are on a much grander scale than those of his predecessor, and hence do not represent &quot;abbreviation&quot;. An alternative rendering of &quot;abbreviavit&quot; is to write down, suggesting that he actually prepared a new edition using his better developed system of rhythmic notation, including mensural notation, as mentioned by Anonymous IV.

Two styles emerged from the &quot;organum duplum&quot;, the &quot;florid&quot; and &quot;discant&quot; (&quot;discantus&quot;). The former was more typical of Léonin, the latter of Pérotin, though this indirect attribution has been challenged. Anonymous IV described Léonin as &quot;optimus organista&quot; (the best composer of &quot;organa&quot;) but Pérotin, who revised the former&#x27;s &quot;Magnus liber organi&quot; (Great Organum Book), as &quot;optimus discantor&quot; referring to his discant composition., In the original discant &quot;organum duplum&quot;, the second voice follows the &quot;cantus firmus&quot;, note on note but at an interval, usually a fourth above. By contrast, in the florid organum, the upper or &quot;vox organalis&quot; voice wove shorter notes around the longer notes of the lower &quot;tenor&quot; chant.

=== Compositions ===
Anonymous IV mentions a number of compositions which he attributes to Pérotin, including the four-voice &quot;Viderunt omnes&quot; and &quot;Sederunt principes&quot;, and the three-voice &quot;Alleluia &quot;Posui adiutorium&quot;&quot; and &quot;Alleluia &quot;Nativitas&quot;&quot;. Johannes de Garlandia states that the &quot;Magnus Liber&quot; commences with Perotin&#x27;s four-part organa, and makes specific reference to the notation in the three-part &quot;Alleluya, Posui adiutorium&quot;. Other works are attributed to him by later scholars, such as Heinrich Husmann, on stylistic grounds, all in the organum style, as well as the two-voice &quot;Dum sigillum summi Patris&quot; and the monophonic &quot;Beata viscera&quot; () in the conductus style. (The &quot;conductus&quot; sets a rhymed Latin poem called a sequence to a repeated melody, much like a contemporary hymn.) By tradition, the four-part pieces of the Notre Dame school have been attributed to Pérotin, leaving the two-part pieces to Léonin. The former include the three-part conductus &quot;Salvator hodie&quot;. The latter is placed in the Mass for the Circumcision in a 13th-century French manuscript. Of these, the best known works are his &quot;Viderunt omnes&quot; and &quot;Sederunt principes&quot;. These have been described as representing the peak of musical development of the time.

Most of Pérotin&#x27;s works are in polyphonic form of discant, including the &quot;quadrupla&quot; and &quot;tripla&quot;. Here the upper voices move in discant, as rhythmic counterpoint above the sustained &quot;tenor&quot; notes. This is consistent with Anonymous IV&#x27;s description of him as &quot;optimus discantor&quot;. However, like Léonin, he is likely to have composed in every musical genre and style known to Notre Dame polyphony.
Pérotin&#x27;s dates of activity have been approximated from some late 12th century edicts (&quot;Statuta et donationes piae&quot;) of the Bishop of Paris, Odo (Eudes de Sully) (1196–1208), in 1198 and 1199. Rebuked by Peter of Capua, the papal legate of the time, the bishop sought to reform the rituals around the Christmas season, forbidding the boistrous costumed performances that existed at the time, in particular, the Feast of Fools. His preference was for elaborate music in its stead, calling for performance in &quot;organa triplo vel quadruplo&quot; for the Responsory and &quot;Benedicamus&quot; and other settings. The bishop&#x27;s edicts are quite specific, and suggest that Pérotin&#x27;s &quot;organum quadruplum&quot; &quot;Viderunt omnes&quot; was written for Christmas 1198, and his other &quot;organum quadruplum&quot; &quot;Sederunt Principes&quot; was composed for Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day 1199, for the dedication of a new wing of the Notre Dame Cathedral. If written after this, they could not have been written till late 1200 or 1201, since for most of 1200 France lay under an interdict of Pope Innocent III which suppressed the celebration of church services. Hans Tischler dates the revision of the &quot;Magnus Liber&quot; to around 1180/90. Between the accounts of Anonymous IV, the episcopal edicts and the arrangements in the &quot;Magnus liber&quot;, the key compositions appear to be corroborated and assigned to this period.

Pérotin composed music to at least five of the poems of the Chancellor of the cathedral, Philippe le Chancelier (Philip the Chancellor). Philip, also a canon there, held that title at the cathedral from 1218 till his death in 1236, suggesting a possible later date for Pérotin&#x27;s setting of the former&#x27;s &quot;Beata viscera&quot; (ca. 1220), or at least a &quot;terminus ante quem&quot;. Others believe this poem was written much earlier, and hence place Pérotin&#x27;s death as no later than 1205, the bishop&#x27;s edicts implying that Pérotin&#x27;s work was well before this. Philip appears to have written a number of poems with the intention of them being set to music by Pérotin, and with him is given credit for the development of the motet.

== Works ==
Anonymous IV identified seven works, that he presumably considered worthy of singling out, and these represent the only direct attribution. Subsequent authors have attributed works on stylistic and chronological grounds. These include Friedrich Ludwig (1910), Heinrich Husmann (1940), Hans Tischler (1950) and Ethel Thurston (1970). Husmann added an additional nine three-part &quot;organa&quot;, and five &quot;clausula&quot; to which Ludwig added numerous other &quot;clausula&quot;. Other authors have attributed all the three-part &quot;organa&quot; in the &quot;Magnus Liber&quot; to Pérotin, which is unlikely. Nevertheless, two of the only three known four-part &quot;organa&quot; can be attributed to him.

== Influence ==

Pérotin has been described as the first modern composer in the Western tradition, radically transforming the work of his predecessors from a largely improvisatory technique to a distinct musical architecture. Pérotin&#x27;s music has influenced modern minimalist composers such as Steve Reich, particularly in Reich&#x27;s work &quot;Proverb&quot;.
