<text>The cinema of India, consisting of motion pictures made by the Indian film industry, has had a large effect on world cinema since the second half of the 20th century. Indian cinema is made up of various film industries, each focused on producing films in a specific language, such as Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Bhojpuri, Assamese and others.

Major centres of film production across the country include Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Kochi, Bengaluru, Bhubaneswar-Cuttack, and Guwahati. For a number of years, the Indian film industry has ranked first in the world in terms of annual film output. In 2022, Indian cinema earned ($1.9 billion) at the box-office. Ramoji Film City located in Hyderabad is certified by the Guinness World Records as the largest film studio complex in the world measuring over 1,666 acres (674 ha).

Indian cinema is composed of multilingual and multi-ethnic film art. The term &#x27;Bollywood&#x27;, often mistakenly used to refer to Indian cinema as a whole, specifically denotes the Hindi-language film industry. Indian cinema, however, is an umbrella term encompassing multiple film industries, each producing films in its respective language and showcasing unique cultural and stylistic elements.

In 2021, Telugu cinema emerged as the largest film industry in India in terms of box office. In 2022, Hindi cinema represented 33% of box office revenue, followed by Telugu representing 20%, Tamil representing 16%, Kannada representing 8%, and Malayalam representing 6%. Other prominent film industries are Marathi, Punjabi, Bengali, Gujarati, Bhojpuri, and Odia cinema. As of 2022, the combined revenue of South Indian film industries has surpassed that of the Mumbai-based Hindi-language film industry (Bollywood). As of 2022, Telugu cinema leads Indian cinema with 23.3 crore (233 million) tickets sold, followed by Tamil cinema with 20.5 crore (205 million) and Hindi cinema with 18.9 crore (189 million).

Indian cinema is a global enterprise, and its films have attracted international attention and acclaim throughout South Asia. Since talkies began in 1931, Hindi cinema has led in terms of box office performance, but in recent years it has faced stiff competition from Telugu cinema. Overseas Indians account for 12% of the industry&#x27;s revenue.

== History ==
The history of cinema in India extends to the beginning of the film era. Following the screening of the Lumière and Robert Paul moving pictures in London in 1896, commercial cinematography became a worldwide sensation and these films were shown in Bombay (now Mumbai) that same year.

=== Silent era (1890s–1920s) ===
In 1897, a film presentation by filmmaker Professor Stevenson featured a stage show at Calcutta&#x27;s Star Theatre. With Stevenson&#x27;s camera and encouragement, Indian photographer Hiralal Sen filmed scenes from that show, exhibited as &quot;The Flower of Persia&quot; (1898). &quot;The Wrestlers&quot; (1899), by H. S. Bhatavdekar, showing a wrestling match at the Hanging Gardens in Bombay, was the first film to be shot by an Indian and the first Indian documentary film. From 1913 to 1931, all the movies made in India were silent films, which had no sound and had intertitles.

In 1913, Dadasaheb Phalke released &quot;Raja Harishchandra&quot; (1913) in Bombay, the first film made in India. It was a silent film incorporating English, Marathi, and Hindi intertitles. It was premiered in Coronation cinema in Girgaon.

Although some claim &quot;Shree Pundalik&quot; (1912) of Dadasaheb Torne as the first film ever made in India, some film scholars have argued that &quot;Pundalik&quot; was not a true Indian film because it was simply a recording of a stage play, filmed by a British cameraman and it was processed in London. &quot;Raja Harishchandra&quot; of Phalke had a story based on Hindu Sanskrit legend of Harishchandra, a truthful King and its success led many to consider him a pioneer of Indian cinema. Phalke used an all Indian crew including actors Anna Salunke and D. D. Dabke. He directed, edited, processed the film himself. Phalke saw &quot;The Life of Christ&quot; (1906) by the French director Alice Guy-Blaché, While watching Jesus on the screen, Phalke envisioned Hindu deities Rama and Krishna instead and decided to start in the business of &quot;moving pictures&quot;.

In South India, film pioneer Raghupathi Venkaiah Naidu, credited as the father of Telugu cinema, built the first cinemas in Madras (now Chennai), and a film studio was established in the city by Nataraja Mudaliar. In 1921, Naidu produced the silent film, &quot;Bhishma Pratigna&quot;, generally considered to be the first Telugu feature film.

The first Tamil and Malayalam films, also silent films, were &quot;Keechaka Vadham&quot; (1917–1918, R. Nataraja Mudaliar) and &quot;Vigathakumaran&quot; (1928, J. C. Daniel Nadar). The latter was the first Indian social drama film and featured the first Dalit-caste film actress.

The first chain of Indian cinemas, Madan Theatre, was owned by Parsi entrepreneur Jamshedji Framji Madan, who oversaw the production and distribution of films for the chain. These included film adaptations from Bengal&#x27;s popular literature and &quot;Satyawadi Raja Harishchandra&quot; (1917), a remake of Phalke&#x27;s influential film.

Films steadily gained popularity across India as affordable entertainment for the masses (admission as low as an &quot;anna&quot; [one-sixteenth of a rupee] in Bombay). Young producers began to incorporate elements of Indian social life and culture into cinema, others brought new ideas from across the world. Global audiences and markets soon became aware of India&#x27;s film industry.

In 1927, the British government, to promote the market in India for British films over American ones, formed the Indian Cinematograph Enquiry Committee. The ICC consisted of three British and three Indians, led by T. Rangachari, a Madras lawyer. This committee failed to bolster the desired recommendations of supporting British Film, instead recommending support for the fledgling Indian film industry, and their suggestions were set aside.

=== Sound era ===
The first Indian sound film was &quot;Alam Ara&quot; (1931) made by Ardeshir Irani. &quot;Ayodhyecha Raja&quot; (1932) was the first sound film of Marathi cinema. Irani also produced South India&#x27;s first sound film, the Tamil–Telugu bilingual talking picture &quot;Kalidas&quot; (1931, H. M. Reddy).

The first Telugu film with audible dialogue, &quot;Bhakta Prahlada&quot; (1932), was directed by H. M. Reddy, who directed the first bilingual (Telugu and Tamil) talkie Kalidas (1931). East India Film Company produced its first Telugu film, &quot;Savitri&quot; (1933, C. Pullayya), adapted from a stage play by Mylavaram Bala Bharathi Samajam. The film received an honorary diploma at the 2nd Venice International Film Festival. Chittoor Nagayya was one of the first multilingual filmmakers in India.

&quot;Jumai Shasthi&quot; was the first Bengali short film as a talkie.

Jyoti Prasad Agarwala made his first film &quot;Joymoti&quot; (1935) in Assamese, and later made &quot;Indramalati&quot;. The first film studio in South India, Durga Cinetone, was built in 1936 by Nidamarthi Surayya in Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh. The advent of sound to Indian cinema launched musicals such as &quot;Indra Sabha&quot; and &quot;Devi Devyani&quot;, marking the beginning of song-and-dance in Indian films. By 1935, studios emerged in major cities such as Madras, Calcutta and Bombay as filmmaking became an established industry, exemplified by the success of &quot;Devdas&quot; (1935). The first colour film made in India was &quot;Kisan Kanya&quot; (1937, Moti B). &quot;Viswa Mohini&quot; (1940) was the first Indian film to depict the Indian movie-making world.

Swamikannu Vincent, who had built the first cinema of South India in Coimbatore, introduced the concept of &quot;tent cinema&quot; in which a tent was erected on a stretch of open land to screen films. The first of its kind was in Madras and called Edison&#x27;s Grand Cinema Megaphone. This was due to the fact that electric carbons were used for motion picture projectors. Bombay Talkies opened in 1934 and Prabhat Studios in Pune began production of Marathi films. &quot;Sant Tukaram&quot; (1936) was the first Indian film to be screened at an international film festival, at the 1937 edition of the Venice Film Festival. The film was judged one of the three best films of the year. However, while Indian filmmakers sought to tell important stories, the British Raj banned &quot;Wrath&quot; (1930) and &quot;Raithu Bidda&quot; (1938) for broaching the subject of the Indian independence movement.

The Indian &quot;Masala film&quot;—a term used for mixed-genre films that combined song, dance, romance, etc.—arose following the Second World War. During the 1940s, cinema in South India accounted for nearly half of India&#x27;s cinema halls, and cinema came to be viewed as an instrument of cultural revival. The Indian People&#x27;s Theatre Association (IPTA), an art movement with a communist inclination, began to take shape through the 1940s and the 1950s. IPTA plays, such as &quot;Nabanna&quot; (1944), prepared the ground for realism in Indian cinema, exemplified by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas&#x27;s &quot;Dharti Ke Lal&quot; (&quot;Children of the Earth&quot;, 1946). The IPTA movement continued to emphasise realism in films &quot;Mother India&quot; (1957) and &quot;Pyaasa&quot; (1957), among India&#x27;s most recognisable cinematic productions.

Following independence, the 1947 partition of India divided the nation&#x27;s assets and a number of studios moved to Pakistan. Partition became an enduring film subject thereafter. The Indian government had established a Films Division by 1948, which eventually became one of the world&#x27;s largest documentary film producers with an annual production of over 200 short documentaries, each released in 18 languages with 9,000 prints for permanent film theatres across the country.

=== Golden Age (late 1940s–1960s) ===
The period from the late 1940s to the early 1960s is regarded by film historians as the Golden Age of Indian cinema. This period saw the emergence of the parallel cinema movement, which emphasised social realism. Mainly led by Bengalis, early examples include &quot;Dharti Ke Lal&quot; (1946, Khwaja Ahmad Abbas), &quot;Neecha Nagar&quot; (1946, Chetan Anand), &quot;Nagarik&quot; (1952, Ritwik Ghatak) and &quot;Do Bigha Zamin&quot; (1953, Bimal Roy), laying the foundations for Indian neorealism

&quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot; (1955–1959, Satyajit Ray) won prizes at several major international film festivals and firmly established the parallel cinema movement. It was influential on world cinema and led to a rush of coming-of-age films in art house theatres. Cinematographer Subrata Mitra developed the technique of bounce lighting, to recreate the effect of daylight on sets, during the second film of the trilogy and later pioneered other effects such as the photo-negative flashbacks and X-ray digressions.

During the 1950s, Indian cinema reportedly became the world&#x27;s second largest film industry, earning a gross annual income of in 1953. The government created the Film Finance Corporation (FFC) in 1960 to provide financial support to filmmakers. While serving as Information and Broadcasting Minister of India in the 1960s, Indira Gandhi supported the production of off-beat cinema through the FFC.

Baburao Patel of &quot;Filmindia&quot; called B. N. Reddy&#x27;s &quot;Malliswari&quot; (1951) an &quot;inspiring motion picture&quot; which would &quot;save us the blush when compared with the best of motion pictures of the world&quot;. Film historian Randor Guy called &quot;Malliswari&quot; scripted by Devulapalli Krishnasastri a &quot;poem in celluloid, told with rare artistic finesse, which lingers long in the memory&quot;.

Commercial Hindi cinema began thriving, including acclaimed films &quot;Pyaasa&quot; (1957) and &quot;Kaagaz Ke Phool&quot; (1959, Guru Dutt) &quot;Awaara&quot; (1951) and &quot;Shree 420&quot; (1955, Raj Kapoor). These films expressed social themes mainly dealing with working-class urban life in India; &quot;Awaara&quot; presented Bombay as both a nightmare and a dream, while &quot;Pyaasa&quot; critiqued the unreality of city life.

Epic film &quot;Mother India&quot; (1957, Mehboob Khan) was the first Indian film to be nominated for the US-based Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences&#x27; Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and defined the conventions of Hindi cinema for decades. It spawned a new genre of dacoit films. &quot;Gunga Jumna&quot; (1961, Dilip Kumar) was a dacoit crime drama about two brothers on opposite sides of the law, a theme that became common in Indian films in the 1970s. &quot;Madhumati&quot; (1958, Bimal Roy) popularised the theme of reincarnation in Western popular culture.

Actor Dilip Kumar rose to fame in the 1950s, and was the biggest Indian movie star of the time. He was a pioneer of method acting, predating Hollywood method actors such as Marlon Brando. Much like Brando&#x27;s influence on New Hollywood actors, Kumar inspired Hindi actors, including Amitabh Bachchan, Naseeruddin Shah, Shah Rukh Khan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui.

&quot;Neecha Nagar&quot; (1946) won the Palme d&#x27;Or at Cannes and Indian films competed for the award most years in the 1950s and early 1960s. Ray is regarded as one of the greatest auteurs of 20th century cinema, along with his contemporaries Dutt and Ghatak. In 1992, the &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; Critics&#x27; Poll ranked Ray at  7 in its list of Top 10 Directors of all time. Multiple films from this era are included among the greatest films of all time in various critics&#x27; and directors&#x27; polls, including &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot;, &quot;Jalsaghar&quot;, &quot;Charulata&quot; &quot;Aranyer Din Ratri&quot;, &quot;Pyaasa&quot;, &quot;Kaagaz Ke Phool&quot;, &quot;Meghe Dhaka Tara&quot;, &quot;Komal Gandhar&quot;, &quot;Awaara&quot;, &quot;Baiju Bawra&quot;, &quot;Mother India&quot;, &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; and &quot;Subarnarekha&quot; (also tied at No. 11).

Sivaji Ganesan became India&#x27;s first actor to receive an international award when he won the Best Actor award at the Afro-Asian film festival in 1960 and was awarded the title of Chevalier in the Legion of Honour by the French Government in 1995. Tamil cinema is influenced by Dravidian politics, with prominent film personalities C N Annadurai, M G Ramachandran, M Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa becoming Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu.

===1970s–present===
By 1986, India&#x27;s annual film output had increased to 833 films annually, making India the world&#x27;s largest film producer. Hindi film production of Bombay, the largest segment of the industry, became known as &quot;Bollywood&quot;.

By 1996, the Indian film industry had an estimated domestic cinema viewership of 600million people, establishing India as one of the largest film markets, with the largest regional industries being Hindi, Telugu, and Tamil films. In 2001, in terms of ticket sales, Indian cinema sold an estimated 3.6 billion tickets annually across the globe, compared to Hollywood&#x27;s 2.6 billion tickets sold.

====Hindi====
Realistic parallel cinema continued throughout the 1970s, practised in many Indian film cultures. The FFC&#x27;s art film orientation came under criticism during a Committee on Public Undertakings investigation in 1976, which accused the body of not doing enough to encourage commercial cinema.

Hindi commercial cinema continued with films such as &quot;Aradhana&quot; (1969), &quot;Sachaa Jhutha&quot; (1970), &quot;Haathi Mere Saathi&quot; (1971), &quot;Anand&quot; (1971), &quot;Kati Patang&quot; (1971) &quot;Amar Prem&quot; (1972), &quot;Dushman&quot; (1972) and &quot;Daag&quot; (1973).

By the early 1970s, Hindi cinema was experiencing thematic stagnation, dominated by musical romance films. Screenwriter duo Salim–Javed (Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar) revitalised the industry. They established the genre of gritty, violent, Bombay underworld crime films with &quot;Zanjeer&quot; (1973) and &quot;Deewaar&quot; (1975). They reinterpreted the rural themes of &quot;Mother India&quot; and &quot;Gunga Jumna&quot; in an urban context reflecting 1970s India, channelling the growing discontent and disillusionment among the masses, unprecedented growth of slums and urban poverty, corruption and crime, as well as anti-establishment themes. This resulted in their creation of the &quot;angry young man&quot;, personified by Amitabh Bachchan, who reinterpreted Kumar&#x27;s performance in &quot;Gunga Jumna&quot; and gave a voice to the urban poor.

By the mid-1970s, Bachchan&#x27;s position as a lead actor was solidified by crime-action films &quot;Zanjeer&quot; and &quot;Sholay&quot; (1975). The devotional classic &quot;Jai Santoshi Ma&quot; (1975) was made on a low budget and became a box office success and a cult classic. Another important film was &quot;Deewaar&quot; (1975, Yash Chopra), a crime film with brothers on opposite sides of the law which Danny Boyle described as &quot;absolutely key to Indian cinema&quot;.

The term &quot;Bollywood&quot; was coined in the 1970s, when the conventions of commercial Bombay-produced Hindi films were established. Key to this was Nasir Hussain and Salim–Javed&#x27;s creation of the masala film genre, which combines elements of action, comedy, romance, drama, melodrama and musical. Their film &quot;Yaadon Ki Baarat&quot; (1973) has been identified as the first masala film and the first quintessentially Bollywood film. Masala films made Bachchan the biggest Bollywood movie star of the period. Another landmark was &quot;Amar Akbar Anthony&quot; (1977, Manmohan Desai). Desai further expanded the genre in the 1970s and 1980s.

Commercial Hindi cinema grew in the 1980s, with films such as &quot;Ek Duuje Ke Liye&quot; (1981), &quot;Disco Dancer&quot; (1982), &quot; Himmatwala&quot; (1983), &quot;Tohfa&quot; (1984), &quot;Naam&quot; (1986), &quot;Mr India&quot; (1987), and &quot;Tezaab&quot; (1988).

In the late 1980s, Hindi cinema experienced another period of stagnation, with a decline in box office turnout, due to increasing violence, decline in musical melodic quality, and rise in video piracy, leading to middle-class family audiences abandoning theatres. The turning point came with Indian blockbuster &quot;Disco Dancer&quot; (1982) which began the era of disco music in Indian cinema. Lead actor Mithun Chakraborty and music director Bappi Lahiri had the highest number of mainstream Indian hit movies that decade. At the end of the decade, Yash Chopra&#x27;s &quot;Chandni&quot; (1989) created a new formula for Bollywood musical romance films, reviving the genre and defining Hindi cinema in the years that followed. Commercial Hindi cinema grew in the late 1980s and 1990s, with the release of &quot;Mr. India&quot; (1987), &quot;Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak&quot; (1988), &quot;Chaalbaaz&quot; (1989), &quot;Maine Pyar Kiya&quot; (1989), &quot;Lamhe&quot; (1991), &quot;Saajan&quot; (1991), &quot;Khuda Gawah&quot; (1992), &quot;Khalnayak&quot; (1993), &quot;Darr&quot; (1993), &quot;Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!&quot; (1994), &quot;Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge&quot; (1995), &quot;Dil To Pagal Hai&quot; (1997), &quot;Pyar Kiya Toh Darna Kya&quot; (1998) and &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot; (1998). Cult classic &quot;Bandit Queen&quot; (1994) directed by Shekhar Kapur received international recognition and controversy.

In the late 1990s, there was a resurgence of parallel cinema in Bollywood, largely due to the critical and commercial success of crime films such as &quot;Satya&quot; (1998) and &quot;Vaastav&quot; (1999). These films launched a genre known as &quot;Mumbai noir&quot;, reflecting social problems in the city. Ram Gopal Varma directed the Indian Political Trilogy, and the Indian Gangster Trilogy; film critic Rajeev Masand had labelled the latter series as one of the &quot;most influential movies of Bollywood. The first instalment of the trilogy, &quot;Satya&quot;, was also listed in CNN-IBN&#x27;s 100 greatest Indian films of all time.

Since the 1990s, the three biggest Bollywood movie stars have been the &quot;Three Khans&quot;: Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, and Salman Khan. Combined, they starred in the top ten highest-grossing Bollywood films, and have dominated the Indian box office since the 1990s. Shah Rukh Khan was the most successful for most of the 1990s and 2000s, while Aamir Khan has been the most successful since the late 2000s; according to &quot;Forbes&quot;, Shah Rukh Khan is &quot;arguably the world&#x27;s biggest movie star&quot; as of 2017, due to his immense popularity in India and China. Other notable Hindi film stars of recent decades include Arjun Rampal, Sunny Deol, Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgn, Hrithik Roshan, Anil Kapoor, Sanjay Dutt, Sridevi, Madhuri Dixit, Juhi Chawla, Karisma Kapoor, Kajol, Tabu, Aishwarya Rai, Rani Mukerji and Preity Zinta.

&quot;Haider&quot; (2014, Vishal Bhardwaj), the third instalment of the Indian Shakespearean Trilogy after &quot;Maqbool&quot; (2003) and &quot;Omkara&quot; (2006), won the &quot;People&#x27;s Choice Award&quot; at the 9th Rome Film Festival in the Mondo Genere making it the first Indian film to achieve this honour.

The 2000s and 2010s also saw the rise of a new generation of popular actors like Shahid Kapoor, Ranbir Kapoor, Ranveer Singh, Ayushmann Khurrana, Varun Dhawan, Sidharth Malhotra, Sushant Singh Rajput, Kartik Aaryan, Arjun Kapoor, Aditya Roy Kapur and Tiger Shroff, as well as actresses like Vidya Balan, Priyanka Chopra, Kareena Kapoor, Katrina Kaif, Kangana Ranaut, Deepika Padukone, Sonam Kapoor, Anushka Sharma, Shraddha Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Parineeti Chopra and Kriti Sanon with Balan, Ranaut and Bhatt gaining wide recognition for successful female-centric films such as &quot;The Dirty Picture&quot; (2011), &quot;Kahaani&quot; (2012), &quot;Queen&quot; (2014), &quot;Highway&quot; (2014), &quot;Tanu Weds Manu Returns&quot; (2015), &quot;Raazi&quot; (2018) and &quot;Gangubai Kathiawadi&quot; (2022).

Salim–Javed were highly influential in South Indian cinema. In addition to writing two Kannada films, many of their Bollywood films had remakes produced in other regions, including Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam cinema. While the Bollywood directors and producers held the rights to their films in Northern India, Salim–Javed retained the rights in South India, where they sold remake rights for films such as &quot;Zanjeer&quot;, &quot;Yaadon Ki Baarat&quot; and &quot;Don&quot;. Several of these remakes became breakthroughs for actor Rajinikanth.

Sridevi is widely regarded as the first female superstar of Indian cinema due to her pan-Indian appeal with equally successful careers in Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada and Telugu cinema. She is the only Bollywood actor to have starred in a top 10 grossing film each year of her active career (1983–1997).

==== Telugu====
K. V. Reddy&#x27;s &quot;Mayabazar&quot; (1957) is a landmark film in Indian cinema, a classic of Telugu cinema that inspired generations of filmmakers. It blends myth, fantasy, romance and humour in a timeless story, captivating audiences with its fantastical elements. The film excelled in various departments like cast performances, production design, music, cinematography and is particularly revered for its use of technology. The use of special effects, innovative for the 1950s, like the first illusion of moonlight, showcased technical brilliance.. Powerful performances and relatable themes ensure Mayabazar stays relevant, a classic enjoyed by new generations. On the centenary of Indian cinema in 2013, CNN-IBN included &quot;Mayabazar&quot; in its list of &quot;100 greatest Indian films of all time&quot;. In a poll conducted by CNN-IBN among those 100 films, &quot;Mayabazar&quot; was voted by the public as the &quot;Greatest Indian film of all time&quot;.

K. Viswanath, one of the prominent auteurs of Indian cinema, he received international recognition for his works, and is known for blending parallel cinema with mainstream cinema. His works such as &quot;Sankarabharanam&quot; (1980) about revitalisation of Indian classical music won the &quot;Prize of the Public&quot; at the Besançon Film Festival of France in the year 1981. &quot;Forbes&quot; included J. V. Somayajulu&#x27;s performance in the film on its list of &quot;25 Greatest Acting Performances of Indian Cinema&quot;. &quot;Swathi Muthyam&quot; (1986) was India&#x27;s official entry to the 59th Academy Awards. &quot;Swarna Kamalam&quot; (1988) the dance film choreographed by Kelucharan Mohapatra, and Sharon Lowen was featured at the Ann Arbor Film Festival, fetching three Indian Express Awards.

B. Narsing Rao, K. N. T. Sastry, and A. Kutumba Rao garnered international recognition for their works in new-wave cinema. Narsing Rao&#x27;s &quot;Maa Ooru&quot; (1992) won the &quot;Media Wave Award&quot; of Hungary; &quot;Daasi&quot; (1988) and &quot;Matti Manushulu&quot; (1990) won the Diploma of Merit awards at the 16th and 17th MIFF respectively. Sastry&#x27;s &quot;Thilaadanam&quot; (2000) received &quot;New Currents Award&quot; at the 7th Busan; Rajnesh Domalpalli&#x27;s &quot;Vanaja&quot; (2006) won &quot;Best First Feature Award&quot; at the 57th Berlinale.

Ram Gopal Varma&#x27;s &quot;Siva&quot; (1989), which attained cult following introduced steadicams and new sound recording techniques to Indian films. &quot;Siva&quot; attracted the young audience during its theatrical run, and its success encouraged filmmakers to explore a variety of themes and make experimental films. Varma introduced road movie and film noir to Indian screen with &quot;Kshana Kshanam&quot; (1991). Varma experimented with close-to-life performances by the lead actors, which bought a rather fictional storyline a sense of authenticity at a time when the industry was being filled with commercial fillers.

Singeetam Srinivasa Rao introduced time travel to the Indian screen with &quot;Aditya 369&quot; (1991). The film dealt with exploratory dystopian and apocalyptic themes, taking the audience through a post-apocalyptic experience via time travel and folklore from 1526 CE, including a romantic subplot. Singeetam Srinivasa Rao was inspired by the classic sci-fi novel &quot;The Time Machine&quot;.

Chiranjeevi&#x27;s works such as the social drama film &quot;Swayamkrushi&quot; (1987), comedy thriller &quot;Chantabbai&quot; (1986), the vigilante thriller &quot;Kondaveeti Donga&quot; (1990), the Western thriller &quot;Kodama Simham&quot; (1990), and the action thriller, &quot;Gang Leader&quot; (1991), popularised genre films with the highest estimated cinema footfalls. Sekhar Kammula&#x27;s &quot;Dollar Dreams&quot; (2000), which explored the conflict between American dreams and human feelings, re-introduced social realism to Telugu film which had stagnated in formulaic commercialism. War drama &quot;Kanche&quot; (2015, Krish Jagarlamudi) explored the 1944 Nazi attack on the Indian army in the Italian campaign of the Second World War.

Pan-Indian film is a term related to Indian cinema that originated with Telugu cinema as a mainstream commercial film appealing to audiences across the country with a spread to world markets. S. S. Rajamouli pioneered the pan-Indian films movement with duology of epic action films &quot;&quot; (2015) and &quot;Baahubali 2: The Conclusion&quot; (2017), that changed the face of Indian cinema. &quot;Baahubali: The Beginning&quot; became the first Indian film to be nominated for American Saturn Awards. It received national and international acclaim for Rajamouli&#x27;s direction, story, visual effects, cinematography, themes, action sequences, music, and performances, and became a record-breaking box office success. The sequel &quot;Baahubali 2&quot; (2017) went on to win the American &quot;Saturn Award for Best International Film&quot; &amp; emerged as the second-highest-grossing Indian film of all time.

S.S Rajamouli followed up with the alternate historical film &quot;RRR&quot; (2022) that received universal critical acclaim for its direction, screenwriting, cast performances, cinematography, soundtrack, action sequences and VFX, which further consolidated the Pan-Indian film market. The film was considered one of the ten best films of the year by the National Board of Review, making it only the seventh non-English language film ever to make it to the list. It also became the first Indian film by an Indian production to win an Academy Award. The film went on to receive several other nominations at the Golden Globe Awards, Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award including Best Foreign Language Film. Films like &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Kalki 2898 AD&quot; have further contributed to the pan-Indian film wave.

Actors like Prabhas, Allu Arjun, Ram Charan and N. T. Rama Rao Jr. enjoy a nationwide popularity among the audiences after the release of their respective Pan-Indian films. Film critics, journalists and analysts, such as Baradwaj Rangan and Vishal Menon, have labelled Prabhas as the &quot;first legit Pan-Indian Superstar&quot;.

Hindi cinema has been remaking Telugu films since the late 1940s, some of which went on to become landmark films. Between 2000 and 2019, one in every three successful films made in Hindi was either a remake or part of a series. And most of the star actors, have starred in the hit remakes of Telugu films.

==== Tamil ====

Tamil cinema established Madras (now Chennai) as a secondary film production centre in India, used by Hindi cinema, other South Indian film industries, and Sri Lankan cinema. Over the last quarter of the 20th century, Tamil films from India established a global presence through distribution to an increasing number of overseas theatres. The industry also inspired independent filmmaking in Sri Lanka and Tamil diaspora populations in Malaysia, Singapore, and the Western Hemisphere.

&quot;Marupakkam&quot; (1991, K. S. Sethumadhavan) and &quot;Kanchivaram&quot; (2007) each won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film. Tamil films receive significant patronage in neighbouring Indian states Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and New Delhi. In Kerala and Karnataka the films are directly released in Tamil but in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana they are generally dubbed into Telugu.

Tamil films have had international success for decades. Since &quot;Chandralekha&quot; (1948), &quot;Muthu&quot; (1995) was the second Tamil film to be dubbed into Japanese (as &quot;Mutu: Odoru Maharaja&quot;) and grossed a record $1.6 million in 1998. In 2010, &quot;Enthiran&quot; grossed a record $4 million in North America. Tamil-language films appeared at multiple film festivals. &quot;Kannathil Muthamittal&quot; (Ratnam), &quot;Veyyil&quot; (Vasanthabalan) and &quot;Paruthiveeran&quot; (Ameer Sultan), &quot;Kanchivaram&quot; (Priyadarshan) premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. Tamil films were submitted by India for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film on eight occasions. Chennai-based music composer A. R. Rahman achieved global recognition with two Academy Awards and is nicknamed as &quot;Isai Puyal&quot; (musical storm) and &quot;Mozart of Madras&quot;. &quot;Nayakan&quot; (1987, Kamal Haasan) was included in &quot;Time&quot; All-Time 100 Movies list.

====Malayalam====

Malayalam cinema experienced its Golden Age during this time with works of filmmakers such as Adoor Gopalakrishnan, G. Aravindan, T. V. Chandran and Shaji N. Karun. Gopalakrishnan is often considered to be Ray&#x27;s spiritual heir. He directed some of his most acclaimed films during this period, including &quot;Elippathayam&quot; (1981) which won the Sutherland Trophy at the London Film Festival. In 1984 &quot;My Dear Kuttichathan&quot;, directed by Jijo Punnoose under Navodaya Studio, was released and it was the first Indian film to be filmed in 3D format. Karun&#x27;s debut film &quot;Piravi&quot; (1989) won the Caméra d&#x27;Or at Cannes, while his second film &quot;Swaham&quot; (1994) was in competition for the Palme d&#x27;Or. &quot;Vanaprastham&quot; was screened at the Un Certain Regard section of the Cannes Film Festival. Murali Nair&#x27;s &quot;Marana Simhasanam&quot; (1999), inspired by the first execution by electrocution in India, the film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival where it won the Caméra d&#x27;Or. The film received special reception at the British Film Institute.

Fazil&#x27;s &quot;Manichitrathazhu&quot; (1993), scripted by Madhu Muttam, is inspired by a tragedy that happened in an Ezhava &quot;tharavad&quot; of Alummoottil meda&#x27; (an old traditional house) located at Muttom, Alappuzha district, with a central Travancore Channar family, in the 19th century. It was remade in four languages – in Kannada as &quot;Apthamitra&quot;, in Tamil as &quot;Chandramukhi&quot; , in Bengali as &quot;Rajmohol&quot; and in Hindi as &quot;Bhool Bhulaiyaa&quot; – all being commercially successful. Jeethu Joseph&#x27;s &quot;Drishyam&quot; (2013) was remade into four other Indian languages: &quot;Drishya&quot; (2014) in Kannada, &quot;Drushyam&quot; (2014) in Telugu, &quot;Papanasam&quot; (2015) in Tamil and &quot;Drishyam&quot; (2015) in Hindi. Internationally, it was remade in Sinhala language as &quot;Dharmayuddhaya&quot; (2017) and in Chinese as &quot;Sheep Without a Shepherd&quot; (2019), and also in Indonesian.

====Kannada====

Rishab Shetty&#x27;s &quot;Kantara&quot; (2022), received acclaim for showcasing the Bhoota Kola, a native Ceremonial dance performance prevalent among the Hindus of coastal Karnataka.

====Marathi====
Marathi cinema also known as Marathi film industry, is a film industry based in Mumbai, Maharashtra. It is the oldest film industry of India.

Mid-2000s onwards, the industry frequently made hit movies.

== Cultural context ==


K. Moti Gokulsing and Wimal Dissanayake identified six major influences that have shaped Indian popular cinema:

*The ancient epics of &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and &quot;Ramayana&quot; influenced the narratives of Indian cinema. Examples of this influence include the techniques of a side story, back-story and story within a story. Indian popular films often have plots that branch into sub-plots; such narrative dispersals can be seen in the 1993 films &quot;Khalnayak&quot; and &quot;Gardish&quot;.
*Ancient Sanskrit drama, with its emphasis on spectacle, music, dance and gesture combined &quot;to create a vibrant artistic unit with dance and mime being central to the dramatic experience&quot;. Sanskrit dramas were known as &quot;natya&quot;, derived from the root word (dance), featuring spectacular dance-dramas. The &quot;Rasa&quot; method of performance, dating to ancient times, is one of the fundamental features that differentiate Indian from Western cinema. In the &quot;Rasa&quot; method, the performer conveys emotions to the audience through empathy, in contrast to the Western Stanislavski method where the actor must become &quot;a living, breathing embodiment of a character&quot;. The &quot;rasa&quot; method is apparent in the performances of Hindi actors such as Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan and in Hindi films such as &quot;Rang De Basanti&quot; (2006), and Ray&#x27;s works.
*Traditional folk theatre, which became popular around the 10th century with the decline of Sanskrit theatre. These regional traditions include the Yatra of West Bengal, the Ramlila of Uttar Pradesh, Yakshagana of Karnataka, &#x27;Chindu Natakam&#x27; of Andhra Pradesh and the Terukkuttu of Tamil Nadu.
*Parsi theatre, which blends realism and fantasy, containing crude humour, songs and music, sensationalism, and dazzling stagecraft. These influences are clearly evident in &quot;masala&quot; films such as &quot;Coolie&quot; (1983), and to an extent in more recent critically acclaimed films such as &quot;Rang De Basanti&quot;.
*Hollywood-made popular musicals from the 1920s through the 1960s, though Indian films used musical sequences as another fantasy element in the song-and-dance tradition of narration, undisguised and &quot;intersect[ing] with people&#x27;s day-to-day lives in compelex and interesting ways.&quot; 
*Western music videos, particularly MTV, had an increasing influence in the 1990s, as can be seen in the pace, camera angles, dance sequences, and music of recent Indian films. An early example of this approach was &quot;Bombay&quot; (1995, Mani Ratnam).

Sharmistha Gooptu and Bhaumik identify Indo-Persian/Islamicate culture as another major influence. In the early 20th century, Urdu was the lingua franca of popular performances across northern India, established in performance art traditions such as nautch dancing, Urdu poetry and Parsi theatre. Urdu and related Hindi dialects were the most widely understood across northern India, thus Hindustani became the standardised language of early Indian talkies. &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; (&quot;Arabian Nights&quot;) had a strong influence on Parsi theatre, which adapted &quot;Persianate adventure-romances&quot; into films, and on early Bombay cinema where &quot;&quot;Arabian Nights&quot; cinema&quot; became a popular genre.

Like mainstream Indian popular cinema, Indian parallel cinema was influenced by a combination of Indian theatre and Indian literature (such as Bengali literature and Urdu poetry), but differs when it comes to foreign influences, where it is influenced more by European cinema (particularly Italian neorealism and French poetic realism) than by Hollywood. Ray cited Vittorio De Sica&#x27;s &quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot; (1948) and Jean Renoir&#x27;s &quot;The River&quot; (1951), on which he assisted, as influences on his debut film &quot;Pather Panchali&quot; (1955).

== International influence ==
During colonial rule, Indians bought film equipment from Europe. The British funded wartime propaganda films during the Second World War, some of which showed the Indian army pitted against the Axis powers, specifically the Empire of Japan, which had managed to infiltrate India. One such story was &quot;Burma Rani&quot;, which depicted civilian resistance to Japanese occupation by British and Indian forces in Myanmar. Pre-independence businessmen such as J. F. Madan and Abdulally Esoofally traded in global cinema.

Early Indian films made early inroads into the Soviet Union, Middle East, Southeast Asia and China. Mainstream Indian movie stars gained international fame across Asia and Eastern Europe. For example, Indian films were more popular in the Soviet Union than Hollywood films and occasionally domestic Soviet films. From 1954 to 1991, 206 Indian films were sent to the Soviet Union, drawing higher average audience figures than domestic Soviet productions, Films such as &quot;Awaara&quot; and &quot;Disco Dancer&quot; drew more than 60 million viewers. Films such as &quot;Awaara&quot;, &quot;3 Idiots&quot; and &quot;Dangal&quot;, were among the 20 highest-grossing films in China.

Many Asian and South Asian countries increasingly found Indian cinema more suited to their sensibilities than Western cinema. Jigna Desai holds that by the 21st century, Indian cinema had become &#x27;deterritorialised&#x27;, spreading to parts of the world where Indian expatriates were present in significant numbers and had become an alternative to other international cinema.

Indian films frequently appeared in international fora and film festivals. This allowed parallel Bengali filmmakers to achieve worldwide fame.

Indian cinema more recently began influencing Western musical films, and played a particularly instrumental role in the revival of the genre in the Western world. Ray&#x27;s work had a worldwide impact, with filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese, James Ivory, Abbas Kiarostami, François Truffaut, Carlos Saura, Isao Takahata and Gregory Nava citing his influence, and others such as Akira Kurosawa praising his work. The &quot;youthful coming-of-age dramas that flooded art houses since the mid-fifties owe a tremendous debt to the Apu trilogy&quot;, according to the film critic Michael Sragow. Since the 1980s, overlooked Indian filmmakers such as Ghatak and Dutt posthumously gained international acclaim. Baz Luhrmann stated that his successful musical film &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; (2001) was directly inspired by Bollywood musicals. That film&#x27;s success renewed interest in the then-moribund Western musical genre, subsequently fuelling a renaissance. Danny Boyle&#x27;s &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; (2008) was directly inspired by Indian films, and is considered to be an &quot;homage to Hindi commercial cinema&quot;.

Indian cinema has been recognised repeatedly at the US-based Academy Awards. Indian films &quot;Mother India&quot; (1957), &quot;Salaam Bombay!&quot; (1988) and &quot;Lagaan&quot; (2001), were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Indian Oscar winners include Bhanu Athaiya (costume designer), Ray (filmmaker), A. R. Rahman (music composer), Resul Pookutty (sound editor) and Gulzar (lyricist), M. M. Keeravani (music composer), Chandrabose (lyricist) Cottalango Leon and Rahul Thakkar Sci-Tech Award.

== Genres and styles ==
=== Masala film ===

Masala is a style of Indian cinema that mixes multiple genres in one work, pioneered in the early 1970s Bollywood by filmmaker Nasir Hussain, For example, one film can portray action, comedy, drama, romance and melodrama. These films tend to be musicals with songs filmed in picturesque locations. Plots for such movies may seem illogical and improbable to unfamiliar viewers. The genre is named after masala, a mixture of spices in Indian cuisine.

=== Parallel cinema ===

Parallel cinema, also known as art cinema or the Indian New Wave, is known for its realism and naturalism, addressing the sociopolitical climate. This movement is distinct from mainstream Bollywood cinema and began around the same time as the French and Japanese New Waves. The movement began in Bengal (led by Ray, Sen and Ghatak) and then gained prominence in other regions. The movement was launched by Bimal Roy&#x27;s &quot;Do Bigha Zamin&quot; (1953), which was both a commercial and critical success, winning the International Prize at Cannes. Ray&#x27;s films include the three instalments of &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot; which won major prizes at the Cannes, Berlin and Venice Film Festivals, and are frequently listed among the greatest films of all time.

Other neo-realist filmmakers were Shyam Benegal, Karun, Gopalakrishnan and Kasaravalli.

=== Multilingual ===

Some Indian films are known as &quot;multilinguals&quot;, filmed in similar but non-identical versions, in different languages. Chittoor Nagayya, was one of the first multilingual filmmakers in India. &quot;Alam Ara&quot; and &quot;Kalidas&quot; are earliest examples of bilingual filmmaking in India&quot;.&quot; According to Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema&quot; (1994), in its most precise form, a multilingual is

Rajadhyaksha and Willemen note that in seeking to construct their &quot;Encyclopedia&quot;, they often found it &quot;extremely difficult to distinguish multilinguals in this original sense from dubbed versions, remakes, reissues or, in some cases, the same film listed with different titles, presented as separate versions in different languages ... it will take years of scholarly work to establish definitive data in this respect&quot;.

=== Pan-India film ===

Pan-India is a term related to Indian cinema that originated with Telugu cinema as a mainstream commercial cinema appealing to audiences across the country with a spread to world markets. S. S. Rajamouli pioneered the Pan-Indian films movement with his duology of epic action films &quot;&quot; (2015) and &quot;Baahubali 2: The Conclusion&quot; (2017). &quot;Pan-India film&quot; is both a style of cinema and a distribution strategy, designed to universally appeal to audiences across the country and simultaneously released in multiple languages.

== Music ==
Music and songs are a big part of Indian cinema and it&#x27;s not just for entertainment but they play a crucial role in storytelling. Music and dance are a core part of Indian culture, and films weave them in to tell the story. Songs are used to express emotions that spoken dialogue might struggle to convey. Songs often used to move the plot forward. Lyrics might reveal a character&#x27;s inner thoughts, motivations, or foreshadow future events. Sometimes the song itself can become a turning point in the story. While some may find them disruptive, songs remain a deeply rooted tradition in Indian cinema, reflecting both its culture and what audiences love.

Music is a substantial revenue generator for the Indian film industry, with music rights alone accounting for 4–5% of net revenues. The major film music companies are T-Series at Delhi, Sony Music India at Chennai and Zee Music Company at Mumbai, Aditya Music at Hyderabad and Saregama at Kolkata. Film music accounts for 48% of net music sales in the country. A typical film may feature 5–6 choreographed songs.

The demands of a multicultural, increasingly globalised Indian audience led to a mixing of local and international musical traditions. Local dance and music remain a recurring theme in India and followed the Indian diaspora. Playback singers such as Mohammad Rafi, Lata Mangeshkar, Kishore Kumar, Asha Bhosle, Mukesh, S. Janaki, P. Susheela, K. J. Yesudas, S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, K. S. Chithra, Anuradha Paudwal, Kavita Krishnamurthy, Alka Yagnik, Sadhana Sargam, Shreya Ghoshal ,Sunidhi Chauhan, Kumar Sanu, Udit Narayan, Abhijeet and Sonu Nigam drew crowds to presentations of film music. In the 21st century interaction increased between Indian artists and others.

In 2023, the song &quot;Naatu Naatu&quot; composed by M. M. Keeravani for the movie &quot;RRR&quot; won the Oscar for Best Original Song at the 95th Academy Awards, making it the first song from an Indian film, as well as the first from an Asian film, to win in this category. This made it the first Indian film by an Indian production to win an Academy Award.

== Filming locations ==
A filming location is any place where acting and dialogue are recorded. Sites where filming without dialogue takes place are termed a second unit photography site. Filmmakers often choose to shoot on location because they believe that greater realism can be achieved in a &quot;real&quot; place. Location shooting is often motivated by budget considerations.

The most popular locations for filming in India are the main cities of their state for regional industry. Other locations include Manali and Shimla in Himachal Pradesh; Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir; Ladakh; Darjeeling in West Bengal; Ooty and Kodaikanal in Tamil Nadu; Amritsar in Punjab; Udaipur, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer and Jaipur in Rajasthan; Delhi; Ottapalam in Kerala; Goa and Puducherry.

Bhojpuri film history begins with &quot;Ganga Maiyya Tohe Piyari Chadhaibo&quot; (&quot;Mother Ganges, I will offer you a yellow sari&quot;, 1962, Kundan Kumar). Throughout the following decades, few films were produced. The industry experienced a revival beginning with the hit &quot;Saiyyan Hamar&quot; (&quot;My Sweetheart&quot;, 2001, Mohan Prasad). Although smaller than other Indian film industries, these successes increased Bhojpuri cinema&#x27;s visibility, leading to an awards show and a trade magazine, &quot;Bhojpuri City&quot;.

=== Chakma ===

The Chakma language is spoken in Tripura and Mizoram (Northeast India), as well as in the Chittagong Hill Tracts region of Bangladesh. Films in Chakma include &quot;Tanyabi Firti&quot; (&quot;Tanyabi&#x27;s Lake&quot;, 2005, Satarupa Sanyal).

Kenneth Anderson was born in Bolarum, Secunderabad and came from a Scottish family that settled in India for six generations. His father Douglas Stuart Anderson was superintendent of the F.C.M.A. in Poona, Bombay Presidency and dealt with the salaries paid to military personnel, having an honorary rank of captain. His mother Lucy Ann Taylor née Bailey was the grand-daughter of John Taylor who, for his services, had been gifted land in Bangalore by Sir Mark Cubbon. Douglas like most Scottish soldiers took an interest in sport hunting and influenced Kenneth&#x27;s interest in the outdoors and hunting.

Anderson went to Bishop Cotton Boys&#x27; School and also studied at St Joseph&#x27;s College, Bangalore. He was sent to study law at Edinburgh, Scotland but he quit studies and returned to India. He worked for fifteen years in the posts and telegraph department and later worked at the British Aircraft Factory in Bangalore (later HAL) in the rank of Factory Manager for Planning. He owned nearly 200 acres of land across Karnataka, Hyderabad and Tamil Nadu. In 1972 he was diagnosed with cancer from which he died in 1974. He was buried at the Hosur road cemetery.

== Family==
Anderson met Cheryl Majoire Blossom Minnette née Fleming who came from Sri lanka (her mother Millicient Toussaint was a Burgher while her father Clifford Fleming was from Australia) at Bowring Club in Bangalore. They married in April 1929 at Sorkalpet, Cuddalore, then had a daughter named June (born 19 June 1930) and a son named Donald (18 February 1934 - 12 July 2014) who also took an interest in hunting. The couple separated in later life; Kenneth Anderson moved to Whitefield, while Blossom stayed on at Prospect House, their home on Sydney Road (now Kasturba Road). Blossom died on 11 March 1987.

== Outdoors and writings ==
His love for the inhabitants of the Indian jungle led him to big game hunting and to writing real-life adventure stories. He often went into the jungle alone and unarmed to meditate and enjoy the beauty of untouched nature. As a hunter, he tracked down man-eating tigers and leopards. His kills include the Sloth bear of Mysore, the Leopard of Gummalapur, the Rogue Elephant of Panapatti, the Leopard of the Yellagiri Hills, the Tigress of Jowlagiri, the Tiger of Segur and the Tiger of Mundachipallam.

He is officially recorded as having shot 8 man-eating leopards (7 males and 1 female) and 7 tigers (5 males and 2 females) on the Government records from 1939 to 1966 though he is rumored to have unofficially shot over 18 man eating panthers and over 15–20-man eating tigers. He also shot a few rogue elephants.

Anderson&#x27;s style of writing is descriptive, as he talks about his adventures with wild animals. While most stories are about hunting tigers and leopards – particularly man-eaters – he includes chapters on his first-hand encounters with elephants, bison, and bears. There are stories about the less &#x27;popular&#x27; creatures like Indian wild dogs, hyenas, and snakes. He explains the habits and personalities of these animals.

Anderson gives insights into the people of the Indian jungles of his time, with woods full of wildlife and local inhabitants having to contend with poor quality roads, communication and health facilities. His books delve into the habits of the jungle tribes, their survival skills, and their day-to-day lives.

He also explored the occult, and wrote about his experiences for which he had no explanation. He always wore a talisman to protect him from danger, given to him by Sathya Sai Baba. He was often sought to shoot man-eaters in villages in southern India. He spoke Kannada, the language of his home town Bangalore, and Tamil, a language of the neighboring state of Tamilnadu. He had a Studebaker car and usually hunted with a .405 Winchester Model 1895 rifle. He was a pioneer of wildlife conservation in southern India, and spent his later years &quot;shooting&quot; with a camera.

Anderson expounds his love for India, its people, and its jungles. He believed in the power of alternative medicine and carried a box containing natural herbs from the jungle. He refused most treatments based on Western medicine and died of prostate cancer. (However, when he was mauled by a man-eating tiger, he took penicillin to counter the possible infection.) This incident is described in his book &quot;Man Eaters and Jungle Killers&quot; in the chapter entitled &quot;The Maurauder of Kempekarai&quot;. His last book, &quot;Jungles Long Ago&quot;, was published posthumously. He wrote a novel called the &quot;Fires of Passion&quot; which highlighted the situation of the Scottish people in South India.

In his introduction to &quot;Tales from the Indian Jungle&quot;, Anderson writes: &quot;He [Anderson] appears to be of the jungle himself, and we get the impression that he belongs there. This is the home for him and here is the place he would want to die; the jungle is his birthplace, his heaven and his resting place when the end comes.&quot;

==Jungle folk==
Anderson became well acquainted with many jungle folk from various aborigine tribes; Byra the Poojare from the Poojaree tribe, Ranga a petty shikari who also occasionally took to poaching, and Rachen from the Sholaga tribe. Some of his friends such as Hughie Hailstone also had estates in South India and he also tells us about Eric Newcombe, his friend from his young days who used to get into a lot of trouble.

<doc id="402408" wikidata="Q1137284" url="?curid=402408" title="White-winged lark">
<text>The white-winged lark (Alauda leucoptera) is a species of lark found from southern Ukraine through Kazakhstan to south-central Russia. It is partially migratory, with birds tending to move south in winter. The southernmost birds are mainly resident. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The current genus name is from the Latin for lark. The specific &quot;leucoptera&quot; means &quot;white-winged&quot;, from &quot;leukos&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, and &quot;pteron&quot;, &quot;wing&quot;. Formerly, the white-winged lark was classified as belonging to the genus &quot;Melanocorypha&quot; until moved to &quot;Alauda&quot; in 2014.

==Description==
This lark with flashing white wing patches is large and robust, usually 17–19 cm in length, with a wingspan of 35 cm. Both sexes weigh about 44 g. In flight, it is unmistakable due to its striking wing pattern: black outer flight feathers, white inner flight feathers, and the rest of the wing chestnut. Its body is dark-streaked grey above and whitish below. The adult male has a chestnut crown, but the sexes are otherwise similar.

===Vocalisations===
Its song is a more melodious version of the Eurasian skylark&#x27;s.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The white-winged lark lives in dry, open steppe and plains. It nests on the ground, laying three to eight eggs per clutch. Its diet consists of seeds, and insects during the breeding season. It is gregarious during the winter.

===Threats===
Habitat destruction due to ploughing is one of the main threats to the white-winged lark.

==Status==
Although its population has declined significantly, it is still relatively common, and is not considered to be at risk.

<text>The Padma Vibhushan (IAST: &quot;Padma Vibhūṣaṇa&quot;, lit. &quot;Lotus Grandeur&quot;) is the second-highest civilian award of the Republic of India, after the Bharat Ratna. Instituted on 2 January 1954, the award is given for &quot;exceptional and distinguished service&quot;. All persons without distinction of race, occupation, position or sex are eligible for these awards. However, government servants including those working with public sector undertakings, except doctors and scientists, are not eligible for these Awards. , the award has been bestowed on 336 individuals, including thirty-one posthumous and twenty-one non-citizen recipients.

During 1 May and 15 September of every year, the recommendations for the award are submitted to the Padma Awards Committee, constituted by the Prime Minister of India. The recommendations are received from all the state and the union territory governments, the Ministries of the Government of India, the Bharat Ratna and previous Padma Vibhushan award recipients, the Institutes of Excellence, the Ministers, the Chief Ministers and the Governors of State, and the Members of Parliament including private individuals. The committee later submits their recommendations to the Prime Minister and the President of India for the further approval. The award recipients are announced on Republic Day.

The first recipients of the award were Satyendra Nath Bose, Nand Lal Bose, Zakir Husain, Balasaheb Gangadhar Kher, Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, and V. K. Krishna Menon, who were honoured in 1954. The 1954 statutes did not allow posthumous awards but this was subsequently modified in the January 1955 statute. The &quot;Padma Vibhushan&quot;, along with other personal civil honours, was briefly suspended twice, from July 1977 to January 1980 and from August 1992 to December 1995. Some of the recipients have refused or returned their conferments. P. N. Haksar, Vilayat Khan, E. M. S. Namboodiripad, Swami Ranganathananda, and Manikonda Chalapathi Rau, Mata Amritanandamayi refused the award, the family members of Lakshmi Chand Jain (2011) and Sharad Anantrao Joshi (2016) declined their posthumous conferments, and Baba Amte returned his 1986 conferment in 1991.

In 2024, the award was bestowed upon five recipientsVyjayanthimala, Chiranjeevi, Venkaiah Naidu, Bindeshwar Pathak (posthumous) and Padma Subrahmanyam. The 2025 award was given to seven recipientsD. Nageshwara Reddy, Jagdish Singh Khehar, Kumudini Lakhia, L. Subramaniam, M. T. Vasudevan Nair (posthumous), Osamu Suzuki (posthumous) and Sharda Sinha (posthumous).

== History ==
On 2 January 1954, a press release was published from the office of the secretary to the President of India announcing the creation of two civilian awards—Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian award, and the three-tier Padma Vibhushan, classified into &quot;Pahela Varg&quot; (Class I), &quot;Dusra Varg&quot; (Class II), and &quot;Tisra Varg&quot; (Class III), which rank below the Bharat Ratna. On 15 January 1955, the Padma Vibhushan was reclassified into three different awards: the Padma Vibhushan, the highest of the three, followed by the Padma Bhushan and the Padma Shri.

The award, along with other personal civilian honours, was briefly suspended twice in its history; for the first time in July 1977 when Morarji Desai was sworn in as the fourth Prime Minister of India, for being &quot;worthless and politicized&quot;. The suspension was rescinded on 25 January 1980 after Indira Gandhi returned as Prime Minister.

The civilian awards were suspended again in mid-1992, when two Public-Interest Litigations were filed in the High Courts of India, one in the Kerala High Court on 13 February 1992 by Balaji Raghavan and another in the Madhya Pradesh High Court (Indore Bench) on 24 August 1992 by Satya Pal Anand. Both petitioners questioned the civilian awards being &quot;titles&quot; per an interpretation of of the Constitution of India.

On 25 August 1992, the Madhya Pradesh High Court issued a notice temporarily suspending all civilian awards. A Special Division Bench of the Supreme Court of India was formed comprising five judges: A. M. Ahmadi C. J., Kuldip Singh, B. P. Jeevan Reddy, N. P. Singh, and S. Saghir Ahmad. On 15 December 1995, the Special Division Bench restored the awards and delivered a judgment that the &quot;Bharat Ratna and Padma awards are not titles under Article 18 of the Constitution of India&quot;.

== Regulations ==
The award is conferred for &quot;exceptional and distinguished service&quot;, without distinction of race, occupation, position, or sex. The criteria include &quot;service in any field including service rendered by Government servants&quot;, but excludes those working with the public sector undertakings, with the exception of doctors and scientists. The 1954 statutes did not allow posthumous awards, but this was subsequently modified in the January 1955 statute; Aditya Nath Jha, Ghulam Mohammed Sadiq, and Vikram Sarabhai became the first recipients to be honoured posthumously in 1972.

The recommendations are received from all state and union territory governments, the Ministries of the Government of India, the Bharat Ratna and previous Padma Vibhushan award recipients, the Institutes of Excellence, the Ministers, the Chief Ministers, the Governors of State, and the Members of Parliament, including private individuals. The recommendations received during 1 May and 15 September of every year are submitted to the Padma Awards Committee, convened by the Prime Minister of India. The Awards Committee later submits its recommendations to the Prime Minister and the President of India for further approval.

The Padma Vibhushan award recipients are announced every year on Republic Day of India and registered in &quot;The Gazette of India&quot;a publication released weekly by the Department of Publication, Ministry of Urban Development used for official government notices. The conferral of the award is not considered official without its publication in the &quot;Gazette&quot;. Recipients whose awards have been revoked or restored, both of which actions require the authority of the President, are also registered in the &quot;Gazette&quot; and are required to surrender their medals when their names are struck from the register.

== Specifications ==
The original 1954 specifications of the award called for a circle made of gold gilt in diameter, with rims on both sides. A centrally located lotus flower was embossed on the obverse side of the medal and the text &quot;Padma Vibhushan&quot; written in Devanagari script was inscribed above the lotus along the upper edge of the medal. A floral wreath was embossed along the lower edge and a lotus wreath at the top along the upper edge. The Emblem of India was placed in the centre of the reverse side with the text &quot;Desh Seva&quot; in Devanagari Script on the lower edge. The medal was suspended by a pink riband in width divided into two equal segments by a white vertical line.

A year later, the design was modified. The current decoration is a circular-shaped bronze toned medallion in diameter and thick. The centrally placed pattern made of outer lines of a square of side is embossed with a knob carved within each of the outer angles of the pattern. A raised circular space of in diameter is placed at the centre of the decoration. A centrally located lotus flower is embossed on the obverse side of the medal and the text &quot;Padma&quot; written in Devanagari script is placed above and the text &quot;Vibhushan&quot; is placed below the lotus.

The Emblem of India is placed in the centre of the reverse side with the national motto of India, &quot;Satyameva Jayate&quot; (Truth alone triumphs), in Devanagari Script, inscribed on the lower edge. The rim, the edges. and all embossing on either side is of white gold with the text &quot;Padma Vibhushan&quot; of silver gilt. The medal is suspended by a pink riband in width.

== Recipients ==

<text>The Cave of Altamira ( ; ) is a cave complex, located near the historic town of Santillana del Mar in Cantabria, Spain. It is renowned for prehistoric cave art featuring charcoal drawings and polychrome paintings of contemporary local fauna and human hands. The earliest paintings were applied during the Upper Paleolithic, around 36,000 years ago. The site was discovered in 1868 by Modesto Cubillas and subsequently studied by Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola.

Aside from the striking quality of its polychromatic art, Altamira&#x27;s fame stems from the fact that its paintings were the first European cave paintings for which a prehistoric origin was suggested and promoted. Sautuola published his research with the support of Juan de Vilanova y Piera in 1880, to initial public acclaim.

However, the publication of Sanz de Sautuola&#x27;s research quickly led to a bitter public controversy among experts, some of whom rejected the prehistoric origin of the paintings on the grounds that prehistoric human beings lacked sufficient ability for abstract thought. The controversy continued until 1902, by which time reports of similar findings of prehistoric paintings in the Franco-Cantabrian region had accumulated and the evidence could no longer be rejected.

Altamira is located in the Franco-Cantabrian region and in 1985 was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as a key location of the Cave of Altamira and Paleolithic Cave Art of Northern Spain. The cave can no longer be visited, for conservation reasons, but there are replicas of a section at the site and elsewhere.

== Description ==

The cave is approximately long and consists of a series of twisting passages and chambers. The main passage varies from two to six meters in height. The cave was formed through collapses following early karst phenomena in the calcareous rock of Mount Vispieres.

Archaeological excavations in the cave floor found rich deposits of artifacts from the Upper Solutrean (c.18,500 years ago) and Lower Magdalenian (between c.16,590 and 14,000 years ago). Both periods belong to the Paleolithic or Old Stone Age. In the two millennia between these two occupations, the cave was evidently inhabited only by wild animals.

Human occupants of the site were well-positioned to take advantage of the rich wildlife that grazed in the valleys of the surrounding mountains as well as the marine life available in nearby coastal areas. Around 13,000 years ago a rockfall sealed the cave&#x27;s entrance, preserving its contents until its eventual discovery, which occurred after a nearby tree fell and disturbed the fallen rocks.

Human occupation was limited to the cave mouth, although paintings were created throughout the length of the cave. The artists used charcoal and ochre or hematite to create the images, often diluting these pigments to produce variations in intensity and creating an impression of chiaroscuro. They also exploited the natural contours of the cave walls to give their subjects a three-dimensional effect. The Polychrome Ceiling is the most impressive feature of the cave, depicting a herd of extinct steppe bison (&quot;Bison priscus&quot;) in different poses, two horses, a large doe, and possibly a wild boar.

Dated to the Magdalenian occupation, these paintings include abstract shapes in addition to animal subjects. Solutrean paintings include images of horses and goats, as well as handprints that were created when artists placed their hands on the cave wall and blew pigment over them to leave a negative image. Numerous other caves in northern Spain contain Paleolithic art, but none is as complex or well-populated as Altamira.

== Discovery, excavation, scepticism ==
In 1879, following its discovery a decade earlier, amateur archaeologist Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola was led by his eight-year-old daughter María to the cave and realized that the markings on the walls constituted drawings. The cave was excavated by Sautuola and archaeologist Juan Vilanova y Piera from the University of Madrid, resulting in a much acclaimed publication in 1880 which interpreted the paintings as Paleolithic in origin. The French specialists, led by Gabriel de Mortillet and Émile Cartailhac, were particularly adamant in rejecting the hypothesis of Sautuola and Piera, whose findings were loudly ridiculed at the 1880 Prehistorical Congress in Lisbon.

Due to the high artistic quality, and the exceptional state of conservation of the paintings, Sautuola was accused of forgery, as he was unable to answer why there were no soot (smoke) marks on the walls and ceilings of the cave. A fellow countryman maintained that the paintings had been produced by a contemporary artist, on Sautuola&#x27;s orders. Later, Sautuola found out the artist could have used marrow fat as oil for the lamp, producing much less soot than any other combustibles.

It was not until 1902, when several other findings of prehistoric paintings had served to render the hypothesis of the extreme antiquity of the Altamira paintings less offensive, that the scientific society retracted their opposition to the Spaniards. That year, Cartailhac emphatically admitted his mistake in the famous article, &quot;Mea culpa d&#x27;un sceptique&quot;, published in the journal &quot;L&#x27;Anthropologie&quot;. Sautuola, having died 14 years earlier, did not live to witness his rehabilitation.

Cartailhac went on to write a pair of books about the cave, assisted by Henri Breuil&#x27;s hand-drawn reproductions of the paintings. Breuil was both a Catholic priest and a competent draughtsman, whose connection with the cave is discussed in the first chapter of G. K. Chesterton&#x27;s book, The Everlasting Man.

Further excavation work on the cave was done by Hermilio Alcalde del Río between 1902 and 1904, the German Hugo Obermaier between 1924 and 1925 and finally by Joaquín González Echegaray in 1968.

== Dating and periodization ==

There is no scientific agreement on the dating of the archeological artifacts found in the cave, nor the drawings and paintings, and scientists continue to evaluate the age of the cave art at Altamira.

In 2008, researchers using uranium-thorium dating found that the paintings were completed over a period of up to 20,000 years rather than during a comparatively brief period.

A later study published in 2012 based on data obtained from further uranium-thorium dating research, dated some paintings in several caves in North Spain, including some of the claviform signs in the &quot;Gran sala&quot; of Altamira. The oldest sign found, a &quot;large red claviform-like symbol of &quot;Techo de los Polícromos&quot;&quot;, was dated to (corrected), i.e. still well within the Aurignacian. A red dotted outline horse, also in the &quot;Techo de los Polícromos&quot; chamber, was dated to (beginning Solutrean), establishing that the paintings span a period of more than 10,000 years.

== Visitors and replicas ==

During the 1970s and 2000s, the paintings were being damaged by the carbon dioxide and water vapour in the breath of the large number of visitors. Altamira was completely closed to the public in 1977, and reopened to limited access in 1982. Very few visitors were allowed in per day, resulting in a three-year waiting list. After green mould began to appear on some paintings in 2002, the caves were closed to public access.

A replica cave and museum were built nearby and completed in 2001 by Manuel Franquelo and Sven Nebel, reproducing the cave and its art. The replica allows a more comfortable view of the polychrome paintings of the main hall of the cave, as well as a selection of minor works. It also includes some sculptures of human faces that are not visitable in the real cave.

As well as the adjacent National Museum and Research Center of Altamira there are reproductions in the National Archaeological Museum of Spain (Madrid), in the Deutsches Museum in Munich (completed 1964) and in Japan (completed 1993).

During 2010 there were plans to reopen access to the cave towards the end of that year. In December 2010, however, the Spanish Ministry of Culture decided that the cave would remain closed to the public. This decision was based on advice from a group of experts who had found that the conservation conditions inside the cave had become much more stable since the closure.

== Cultural impact ==

Some of the polychrome paintings at Altamira Cave are well known in Spanish popular culture. The logo used by the autonomous government of Cantabria to promote tourism to the region is based on one of the bisons in this cave. &quot;Bisonte&quot; (Spanish for &quot;bison&quot;), a Spanish cigarette brand of the 20th century, also used a Paleolithic style bison figure along with its logo.

The Spanish comic series &quot;Altamiro de la Cueva&quot;, created in 1965, is named for the Altamira Cave. The comic series depicts the adventures of a group of prehistoric cavemen, shown as modern people, but dressed in pieces of fur, similarly to the Flintstones.

The song &quot;The Caves of Altamira&quot; appears on the 1976 album &quot;The Royal Scam&quot; by jazz-rock band Steely Dan, later covered by soul group Perri.

The mid-20th-century modern dinnerware line Primitive, designed by Viktor Schreckengost for the American pottery company Salem China, was based on the bison, deer, and stick figure hunters depicted in the Altamira cave paintings.

The iconic bison image has been used for the cover of the poetry collection &quot;Songs for the Devil and Death&quot; by Scottish author Hal Duncan.

The protagonist in Satyajit Ray&#x27;s film &quot;Agantuk&quot; was inspired by the charging Bison painting to leave his home and study tribal people.

In 2007, the caves were selected as one of the &quot;12 Treasures of Spain&quot;, a contest conducted by broadcasters Antena 3 and COPE.

In 2016, British Director Hugh Hudson released the film &quot;Altamira&quot; (called &quot;Finding Altamira&quot; outside Spain) about the discovery of the caves, starring Antonio Banderas and with music by Mark Knopfler released on the soundtrack album &quot;Altamira&quot;.

<text>Jacques René Hébert (; 15 November 1757 – 24 March 1794) was a French journalist and leader of the French Revolution. As the founder and editor of the radical newspaper &quot;Le Père Duchesne&quot;, he had thousands of followers known as &quot;the Hébertists&quot; (French &quot;Hébertistes&quot;). A proponent of the Reign of Terror, he was eventually guillotined.

==Early life==
Jacques René Hébert was born on 15 November 1757 in Alençon into a Protestant Huguenot family, to goldsmith, former trial judge, and deputy consul Jacques Hébert (died 1766) and Marguerite Beunaiche de Houdrie (1727–1787).

Hébert studied law at the College of Alençon and went into practice as a clerk for a solicitor in Alençon, in which position he was ruined by a lawsuit against a Dr. Clouet. Hébert fled first to Rouen and then to Paris in 1780 to evade a substantial one thousand livre fine imposed for charges of slander. For a while, he passed through a difficult financial time and was supported by a hairdresser in Rue des Noyers. There he found work in a theater, La République, where he wrote plays in his spare time; but these were never produced. Hébert was eventually fired for theft and entered the service of a doctor. It is said he lived through expediency and fraud.

In 1789, he began his writing with a pamphlet &quot;La Lanterne magique ou le Fléau des Aristocrates&quot; (&quot;The Magic Lantern, or Scourge of Aristocrats&quot;). He published a few booklets. In 1790, he attracted attention through a pamphlet he published, and became a prominent member of the political club of the Cordeliers in 1791.

==Père Duchesne==
Many writers and journalists were greatly influenced by the proclamation of martial law on 21 October 1789. It invoked various questions and patterns of Revolutionary thinking and inspired various forms of writing such as that based on the character of &quot;Père Duchesne&quot; (Father Duchesne). The law prompted multiple interpretations, all of which led to what became essential Revolutionary ideals.

From 1790 until his death in 1794, Hébert became a voice for the working class of Paris through his highly successful and influential journal, &quot;Le Père Duchesne&quot;. In his journal, Hébert assumed the voice of a patriotic &quot;sans-culotte&quot; named Père Duchesne and would write first-person narratives in which Père Duchesne would often relay fictitious conversations that he had with the French monarchs or government officials. Hébert did not use himself as the prime example of the revolution. He used a mythical character of Père Duchesne to be able to relay his message in an anonymous fashion. Père Duchesne was already well known by the people of Paris and Hébert only wanted his message to be received directly and clearly by his followers. Père Duchesne was a strong, outspoken, highly emotional character. He felt great anger but also could experience great happiness. He was never afraid to show exactly how he was feeling. He would constantly use foul language and other harsh words to express himself, while also being witty and reflective. The stories resonated deeply in the poorer Parisian quarters. This could encourage violent behavior. Street hawkers would yell, &quot;Il est bougrement en colère aujourd’hui le père Duchesne!&quot; (&quot;Father Duchesne is very angry today!&quot;). Although Hébert did not create the image of the Père Duchesne, his use of the character helped to transform the symbolic image of Père Duchesne from that of a comical stove-merchant into a patriotic role model for the &quot;sans-culottes&quot;. In part, Hébert&#x27;s use of Père Duchesne as a revolutionary symbol can be seen by the character&#x27;s appearance as a bristly old man who was portrayed as smoking a pipe and wearing a Phrygian cap.

Hébert and the Hébertists often expressed the view that many more aristocrats should be examined, denounced, and executed, as they argued that Revolutionary France; and France could only be fully reborn through the elimination of its ancient and supposedly currently malignant nobility. In &quot;Le Père Duchesne&quot; number 65, where he writes of his reawakening in 1790, he defines aristocrats as &quot;enemies of the constitution&quot; who &quot;conspire against the nation&quot;, showing his animus against them. Much of Hébert&#x27;s celebrity came from his denunciations of King Louis XVI in his newspaper, as opposed to any office he may have held or his roles in any of the Parisian clubs with which he was involved.

Because Père Duchesne reflected both his audience&#x27;s speech and dress, his readers listened to and acted on his message. The French linguist and historian Ferdinand Brunot called Hébert, &quot;The Homer of filth&quot;, because of his ability to use common language to appeal to a general audience. In addition, Père Duchesne&#x27;s appearance played into the tensions of the revolution through the sharp contrast between his laborer&#x27;s clothing and the elegant attire of the aristocracy. Hébert was not the only writer during the French Revolution to use the image of Père Duchesne nor was he the only author in the period to adopt foul language as a way of appealing to the working class. Another writer at the time, Lemaire , also wrote a newspaper entitled &quot;Père Duchêne&quot; (although he spelt it differently than Hébert) from September 1790 until May 1792 in which he assumed the voice of a &quot;moderate patriot&quot; who wanted to conserve the relationship between the King and the nation. Lemaire&#x27;s character also used a slew of profanities and would address France&#x27;s military. However, &quot;Le Père Duchesne&quot; became far more popular because it cost less than Jean-Paul Marat&#x27;s paper, &quot;L&#x27; Ami du Peuple&quot;. This made it easier to access for people like the sans-culottes. The popularity was also, in part, due to the Paris Commune deciding to buy his papers and distribute them to the French soldiers in training. For example, starting in 1792, the Paris Commune and the ministers of war Jean-Nicolas Pache and, later, Jean Baptiste Noël Bouchotte bought several thousand copies of &quot;Le Père Duchesne&quot; which were distributed free to the public and troops. This happened again in May and June 1793 when the Minister of War bought copies of newspapers in order to &quot;enlighten and animate their patriotism&quot;. It is estimated that Hébert received 205,000 livres from this purchase. The assassination of Jean-Paul Marat on July 13, 1793, led to &quot;Le Père Duchesne&quot; becoming the incontestible best-selling paper in Paris.

Hébert&#x27;s political commentary between 1790 and 1793 focused on the lavish excesses of the monarchy. Initially, from 1790 and into 1792, &quot;Le Père Duchesne&quot; supported a constitutional monarchy and was even favorable towards King Louis XVI and the opinions of the Marquis de La Fayette. His violent attacks of the period were aimed at Jean-Sifrein Maury, a great defender of papal authority and the main opponent of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Although the character of Père Duchesne supported a constitutional monarchy, he was always highly critical of Marie Antoinette. Knowing that the queen was an easy target for ridicule after the Diamond Necklace Affair, she became a consistent target in the paper as a scapegoat for many of France&#x27;s political problems. By identifying Marie Antoinette&#x27;s lavish excesses and alleged sexuality as the core of the monarchy&#x27;s problems, Hébert&#x27;s articles suggested that, if Marie Antoinette would change her ways and renounce aristocratic excesses, the monarchy could be saved and the queen could return to the good will of the people. Despite his view that the monarchy could be restored, Hébert was skeptical of the queen&#x27;s willingness to comply and often characterized her as an evil enemy of the people by referring to the queen as &quot;Madame Veto&quot; and even addressing King Louis XVI as, &quot;drunken and lazy; a cuckolded pig&quot;. Initially, Hébert was trying to not only educate his readers about the queen, but also awaken her to how she was viewed by the French public. This gave Marie-Antoinette a pivotal role in Hébert&#x27;s political rhetoric; as the Revolution unfolded, she appears in fourteen percent of his newspaper articles between January 1791 and March 1794. Many of the fictitious conversations that Père Duchesne has with her in the newspaper are attempts at either showcasing her supposed nymphomania or attempting to beg her to repent and renounce her wicked ways. With the king&#x27;s failed flight to Varennes, Hébert&#x27;s tone significantly hardened.

==Revolutionary role==
Following Louis&#x27;s failed flight to Varennes in June 1791, Hébert began to attack both Louis and Pope Pius VI. On 17 July, Hébert was at the Champ de Mars to sign a petition to demand the removal of King Louis XVI and was caught up in the subsequent Champ de Mars massacre by troops under the Marquis de Lafayette. This put him in the revolutionary mindset, and &quot;Le Père Duchesne&quot; adopted a populist style, deliberately opposed to the high-minded seriousness and appeal to reason expressed by other revolutionaries, to better appeal to the Parisian sans-culottes. His journalistic voice expressed separation from and violent opposition to cultured elites in favor of a popular political allegiance to radical patriotic solutions to controlling the economy and winning the war. &quot;Le Père Duchesne&quot; began to attack prominent political figures like Lafayette, head of the National Guard; the deceased Comte de Mirabeau, a prominent orator and statesman; and Jean Sylvain Bailly, mayor of Paris. In a 1793 speech to the public, Hébert stated his beliefs regarding Lafayette. He noted that there were two Père Duchesnes, who opposed each other deeply. The Père Duchesne that he said he identified with was the &quot;honest and loyal Père Duchesne who has pursued traitors&quot;, while the Père Duchesne he had nothing to do with &quot;praised Lafayette to the heavens&quot;.

As a member of Cordeliers club, he had a seat in the revolutionary Paris Commune, and during the Insurrection of 10 August 1792 he was sent to the Bonne-Nouvelle section of Paris. As a public journalist, he supported the September Massacres the next month. He agreed with most of the ideals of the radical Montagnard faction, even though he was not a member of it. On 22 December 1792, he was appointed the second substitute of the &quot;procureur&quot; of the commune, and through to August 1793 supported the attacks against the Girondin faction.

In April–May 1793 he, along with Marat and others, violently attacked the Girondins. On 20 May 1793, the moderate majority of the National Convention formed the Special Commission of Twelve, a Girondin commission which was designed to investigate and prosecute conspirators. At the urging of the Twelve, on 24 May 1793, he was arrested. However, Hébert had been warned in time, and, with the support of the &quot;sans-culottes&quot;, the National Convention was forced to order his release three days later. Just four days after that, his anti-Girondin rhetoric would help lead to their ousting in the Insurrection of 31 May 2 June. On 28 August 1793, he proposed to the Jacobins to write an address taking up the demands of the Enragés, and to have it taken to the Convention by the Jacobins, the 48 sections, and the popular societies, a suggestion greatly applauded by Billaud-Varenne and others, ignoring Maximilien Robespierre&#x27;s warning against a riot &quot;which would fill the aristocrats with joy&quot;.

During all this, Hébert met his wife Marie Goupil (born 1756), a 37-year-old former nun who had left convent life at the Sisters of Providence convent at Rue Saint-Honoré. Marie&#x27;s passport from this time shows regular use. They married on 7 February 1792, and had a daughter, Virginie-Scipion Hébert (7 February 1793 – 13 July 1830). During this time, Hébert had a luxurious, bourgeois life. He entertained Jean-Nicolas Pache, the mayor of Paris and Minister of War, for weeks, as well as other influential men, and liked to dress elegantly and surround himself with beautiful objects such as pretty tapestries—an attitude that can be contrasted to that of Paris Commune president Pierre Gaspard Chaumette. Where he got the financial resources to support his lifestyle is unclear; however, there are Jean-Nicolas Pache&#x27;s commissions to print thousands of issues of &quot;Le Père Duchesne&quot; and his relationship to Delaunay d&#x27;Angers, mistress and wife of Andres Maria de Guzman. In February 1793, he voted with fellow bourgeois Hébertists against a Maximum Price Act, a price ceiling on grain, on the grounds that it would cause hoarding and stir resentment.

==Dechristianization==
Dechristianization was a movement that took hold during the French Revolution. Advocates believed that to pursue a secular society, they had to reject the superstitions of the Old Regime and, as an extension, Catholicism, altogether. The trend toward secularization had already begun to take hold throughout France during the eighteenth century, but between September 1793 and August 1794, mostly during the Reign of Terror, French politicians began discussing and embracing notions of &quot;radical dechristianization&quot;. While Robespierre advocated for the right to religion and believed that aggressively pursuing dechristianization would spur widespread revolts throughout rural France, Hébert and his followers, the Hébertists, wanted to spontaneously and violently overhaul religion. The writer and philosopher Voltaire was an inspiration to Hébert on this front. Like Voltaire, Hébert believed that the toleration of different religious beliefs was necessary for humanity to pass from an age of superstitions, and that traditional religion was an obstacle to this goal. Eventually, Hébert would argue that Jesus was not a demigod, but instead a good &quot;sans-culotte&quot;. Voltaire had also provided him with the basic tenets of a civic religion that would be able to replace traditional religion, which led to Hébert to being heavily involved in the movement. The program of dechristianization waged against Catholicism, and eventually against all forms of Christianity, included the deportation of clergy and the condemnation of many of them to death, the closing of churches, the institution of revolutionary and civic cults, the large scale destruction of religious monuments, the outlawing of public and private worship and religious education, forced marriages of the clergy, and forced abjurement of their priesthood. On 21 October 1793, a law was passed which made all suspected priests and all persons who harbored them liable to death on sight.

On 10 November 1793, dechristianization reached what many historians consider the climax of the movement when the Hébertists moved the first Festival of Reason (&quot;Fête de la Raison&quot;), a civic festival celebrating the Goddess of Reason, from the Circus of the Palais Royale to the Cathedral of Notre Dame and reclaimed the cathedral as a &quot;Temple of Reason&quot;. On 7 June, Robespierre, who had previously condemned the Cult of Reason, advocated a new state religion and recommended that the Convention acknowledge the existence of a singular God. On the next day, the worship of the deistic Supreme Being was inaugurated as an official aspect of the Revolution. Compared with Hébert&#x27;s somewhat popular festivals, this austere new religion of Virtue was received with signs of hostility by the Parisian public.

==Clash with Robespierre, arrest, conviction, and execution==
After successfully attacking the Girondins, Hébert in the fall of 1793 continued to attack those whom he viewed as too moderate, including Georges Danton, Pierre Philippeaux, and Maximilien Robespierre, among others. When Hébert accused Marie Antoinette during her trial of incest with her son, Robespierre called him a fool (&quot;imbécile&quot;) for his outrageous and unsubstantiated innuendos and lies.

The government was exasperated and, with support from the Jacobins, finally decided to strike against the Hébertists on the night of 13 March 1794, despite the reluctance of Barère de Vieuzac, Collot d&#x27;Herbois, and Billaud-Varenne. The order was to arrest the leaders of the Hébertists; these included individuals in the War Ministry and others.

In the Revolutionary Tribunal, Hébert was treated very differently from Danton, more like a thief than a conspirator; his earlier frauds were brought to light and criticized. He was sentenced to death with his co-defendants on the third day of deliberations. Their execution by guillotine took place on 24 March 1794. Hébert fainted several times on the way to the guillotine and screamed hysterically when he was placed under the blade. Hébert&#x27;s executioners reportedly amused the crowd by adjusting the guillotine so that its blade stopped inches above his neck, and it was only after the fourth time the lever (&quot;déclic&quot;) was pulled that he was actually beheaded. His corpse was disposed of in the Madeleine Cemetery. His widow was executed twenty days later on 13 April 1794, and her corpse was disposed of in the Errancis Cemetery.

The importance of Hébert&#x27;s execution was known by everyone involved in the revolution, including the Jacobins. Louis Antoine de Saint-Just, a prominent Jacobin leader, noted that following his execution, &quot;the revolution is frozen&quot;, demonstrating how central Hébert and his followers, a large portion of &quot;sans-culottes&quot;, were to the longevity and success of the revolution.

==Influence==
It is difficult to ascertain the extent to which Hébert&#x27;s publication &quot;Le Père Duchesne&quot; impacted the outcomes of political events between 1790 and 1794. French revolutionary historians such as Jean-Paul Bertaud, Jeremy D. Popkin, and William J. Murray each investigated French Revolutionary press history and determined that while the newspapers and magazines that one read during the revolution may have influenced political leanings, the periodicals did not necessarily create those political leanings. One&#x27;s class, for example, could be a significant determinant in directing and influencing one&#x27;s political decisions. Therefore, Hébert&#x27;s writings certainly influenced his audience to an often dramatic extent, but the &quot;sans-culottes&quot; were but one element in a complex political mix, meaning that it is difficult to determine in what ways his writing changed the political outcomes of the French Revolution. That being said, his wide readership and voice throughout the Revolution means that he was a significant public figure, and &quot;Le Père Duchesne&quot;″s ability to influence the general population of France was indeed notable.

<doc id="402435" wikidata="Q274111" url="?curid=402435" title="William F. Sharpe">
<text>William Forsyth Sharpe (born June 16, 1934) is an American economist. He is the STANCO 25 Professor of Finance, Emeritus at Stanford University&#x27;s Graduate School of Business, and the winner of the 1990 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.

Sharpe was one of the originators of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). He created the Sharpe ratio for risk-adjusted investment performance analysis, and he contributed to the development of the binomial method for the valuation of options, the gradient method for asset allocation optimization, and returns-based style analysis for evaluating the style and performance of investment funds.

==Early years==
William Sharpe was born on June 16, 1934, in Boston, Massachusetts. As his father was in the National Guard, the family moved several times during World War II, until they finally settled in Riverside, California. Sharpe spent the rest of his childhood and teenage years in Riverside, graduating from Riverside Polytechnic High School in 1951. He then enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley planning to pursue a degree in medicine. However, in the first year he decided to change his focus and moved to the University of California, Los Angeles to study business administration. Finding that he was not interested in accounting, Sharpe had a further change in preferences, finally majoring in economics. During his undergraduate studies, two professors had a large influence on him: Armen Alchian, a professor of economics who became his mentor, and J. Fred Weston, a professor of finance who first introduced him to Harry Markowitz&#x27;s papers on portfolio theory. While at UCLA, Sharpe became a member of the Theta Xi Fraternity and Phi Beta Kappa Society. He earned a B.A. in 1955, an M.A. in 1956, and a Ph.D. in 1961, all from UCLA.

==Academic training==
After graduation, in 1956 Sharpe joined the RAND Corporation. While doing research at RAND, he also started work for a Ph.D. at UCLA under the supervision of Armen Alchian. While searching for a dissertation topic, J. Fred Weston suggested him to ask Harry Markowitz at RAND. Working closely with Markowitz, who in practice &quot;filled a role similar to that of dissertation advisor&quot;, Sharpe earned his Ph.D. in 1961 with a thesis on a single factor model of security prices, also including an early version of the security market line.

==Professional career==
In 1961 after finishing his graduate studies, Sharpe started teaching at the University of Washington. He started research on generalizing the results in his dissertation to an equilibrium theory of asset pricing, work that yielded the Capital asset pricing model. He submitted the paper describing CAPM to the &quot;Journal of Finance&quot; in 1962. However, ironically, the paper which would become one of the foundations of financial economics was initially considered irrelevant and rejected from publication. Sharpe had to wait for the editorial staff to change until finally getting the paper published in 1964. At the same time, the CAPM was independently developed by John Lintner, Jan Mossin, and Jack Treynor.

In 1968 Sharpe moved to the University of California, Irvine but stayed there for only two years, and in 1970 he moved, this time to Stanford University. While teaching at Stanford, Sharpe continued research in the field of investments, in particular on portfolio allocation and pension funds. He also became directly involved in the investment process by offering consultance to Merrill Lynch and to Wells Fargo, thus having the opportunity to put in practice the prescriptions of financial theory. In 1986, in collaboration with the Frank Russell Company, he founded &quot;Sharpe-Russell Research&quot;, a firm specialized in providing research and consultancy on asset allocation to pension funds and foundations. His 1988 paper, &#x27;Determining a Fund&#x27;s Effective Asset Mix&#x27;, established the model later referred to as returns-based style analysis.

==Later career==
In 1989 he retired from teaching, retaining the position of Professor Emeritus of Finance at Stanford, choosing to focus on his consulting firm, now named &quot;William F. Sharpe Associates&quot;. In 1996, he co-founded Financial Engines (NASDAQ: FNGN) with Stanford Professor Joseph Grundfest and Silicon Valley lawyer Craig W. Johnson. Financial Engines uses technology to implement many of his financial theories in portfolio management.

Today, Financial Engines has over 200 employees and is the leader in automated retirement plan investment advice and management, with more than $200 Billion in managed retirement accounts, providing advice and managed account services to employees in over 1000 major corporations. In March 2018, Financial Engines was acquired for $3 Billion in cash.

Sharpe served as a President of the American Finance Association and he is a trustee of the Economists for Peace and Security. He is also the recipient of a Doctor of Humane Letters, Honoris Causa from DePaul University, a Doctor Honoris Causa from the University of Alicante (Spain), a Doctor Honoris Causa from the University of Vienna and the UCLA Medal, UCLA&#x27;s highest honor.

Since 2009, Sharpe has been an advocate of &quot;adaptive asset allocation&quot; strategies, which seek to exploit recent market behaviour to optimise asset allocation and thus maximise returns and reduce volatility.

==Political views==
In June 2024, 16 Nobel Prize in Economics laureates, including Sharpe, signed an open letter arguing that Donald Trump’s fiscal and trade policies coupled with efforts to limit the Federal Reserve&#x27;s independence would reignite inflation in the United States.

<text>Christopher Doyle, also known as Dù Kěfēng (Mandarin) or Dou Ho-Fung (Cantonese) () (born 2 May 1952) is an Australian-Hong Kong cinematographer. He has worked on over fifty Chinese-language films, being best known for his collaborations with Wong Kar-wai in 
&quot;Fallen Angels&quot;, &quot;Chungking Express&quot;, &quot;Happy Together, In the Mood for Love&quot; and &quot;2046&quot;. Doyle is also known for other films such as &quot;Temptress Moon&quot;, &quot;Hero&quot;, &quot;Dumplings&quot;, and &quot;Psycho&quot;. He has won awards at the Cannes Film Festival and Venice Film Festival, as well as the AFI Award for cinematography, the Golden Horse award (four times), and the Hong Kong Film Award (six times).

==Early life==

Doyle was born in Sydney, Australia, in 1952. He left his native country on a Norwegian merchant ship at the age of eighteen. Doyle arrived in Taiwan for the first time in the 1970s, while his ship was docked in Keelung Harbor. Doyle met Stan Lai and Ding Nai-chu at Idea House, a restaurant in Taipei.

==Career==

While living in other countries, he took on several odd jobs, such as being an oil driller in India, a cow herder in Israel, and a doctor of Chinese medicine in Thailand. In the late seventies, Doyle took an interest in Chinese culture and received the Chinese name Dù Kěfēng, which translates to &quot;like the wind&quot;. After language studies in Taiwan, he started working as a photographer. A couple of years later, he became a cinematographer, working with Taiwanese director Edward Yang on the 1983 film &quot;That Day, on the Beach.&quot;

Doyle has worked on over 50 Chinese-language films. He is best known for his collaborations with Wong Kar-wai in &quot;Chungking Express&quot;, &quot;Fallen Angels&quot;, &quot;Happy Together&quot;, &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; and &quot;2046&quot;. He has collaborated with other Chinese filmmakers on projects including &quot;Temptress Moon&quot;, &quot;Hero&quot; and &quot;Dumplings&quot;. He has also made more than 20 films in various other languages, working as director of photography on Gus Van Sant&#x27;s remake of &quot;Psycho&quot;, &quot;Liberty Heights&quot;, &quot;Last Life in the Universe&quot;, &quot;Rabbit-Proof Fence&quot;, &quot;Paranoid Park&quot;, and &quot;The Limits of Control&quot;, among others.

He also wrote, shot, and directed &quot;Warsaw Dark&quot;, &quot;Away with Words&quot; starring Asano Tadanobu, and &quot;Hong Kong Trilogy: Preschooled Preoccupied Preposterous&quot;, an experimental portrait of three generations of Hong Kong people. He co-directed &quot;The White Girl&quot; with Jenny Suen.

<text>Camille Chautemps (; 1 February 1885 – 1 July 1963) was a French Radical politician of the Third Republic, three times President of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister).

He was the father-in-law of U.S. politician and statesman Howard J. Samuels.

==Early life==
Born into a family of Radical politicians, Camille Chautemps was a lawyer by training and a noted amateur rugby-player in his youth, playing for Tours Rugby and Stade Français. He was inducted into the Grand Orient of France (1906, master 1908), quitting the Freemasons in August 1940 as anti-masonic regulation was adopted by Pétain.

==Early career==
He entered local politics in the fiefdom of his parliamentarian uncle, Alphonse Chautemps, and followed a political career path typical of many Radical-Socialists: first elected town councillor for Tours (1912), then mayor (1919–25), parliamentary deputy (1919–34) and senator (1934–40). Chautemps was considered one of the chief figures of the &#x27;right&#x27; (anti-socialist and pro-liberal) wing of the centre-left Radical-Socialist Party. Between 1924 and 1926, he served in the centre-left coalition governments of Édouard Herriot, Paul Painlevé and Aristide Briand.

===Twice prime minister===
Renowned as a skilful negotiator with friends from across the party divide, he was called upon on several occasions to attempt to build support for a coalition of the centre-left. He first became President of the Council for a short-lived government in 1930. After the electoral victory of the left in 1934, he served as Interior Minister and became head of government once more in November 1933. The revelations of the Stavisky Affair, a corruption scandal, tarnished two of his ministers, sparking violent protests by the far-right leagues. He resigned his posts on 27 January 1934, when the opposition press attributed Stavisky&#x27;s suicide to a government cover-up.

===Deputy Prime minister and last premiership===
In Léon Blum&#x27;s Popular Front government of 1936, Chautemps represented the Radical-Socialist Party as a Minister of State and succeeded Blum at the head of the government from June 1937 to March 1938. The franc was devalued, but government finances remained in difficulty. Pursuing the program of the Popular Front, he proceeded in the nationalisation of the railroads to create the SNCF. However, in January 1938, he formed a new government consisting solely of ministers from the nonsocialist republican centre- left. In February, he granted married women financial and legal independence (until then, wives had been dependent on their husbands to take action involving family finances) and allowed them to go to university and to open bank accounts. His government also repealed Article 213 of the code: &quot;the husband owes protection to his wife, the wife obedience to the husband&quot;. However, the husband remained &quot;head of the household&quot; with &quot;the right to choose the household’s place of residence&quot;. His government fell on 10 March.

===Runup to World War II===
Chautemps subsequently served from April 1938 to May 1940 as Deputy Prime Minister in the governments of Édouard Daladier and Paul Reynaud. After the latter resigned, as he was again deputy prime minister, now to Marshal Philippe Pétain.

==World War II==
France declared war on Germany in September 1939, and in May 1940, the German Army invaded and swept aside all opposition. With the fall of Dunkirk on 5 June and the defeat of the French Army imminent, Chautemps, dined with Paul Baudouin on the 8th, and declared that the war must be ended and that Pétain saw his position most clearly. On the 11th, during a Cabinet meeting, Chautemps suggested for Churchill to be invited back to France to discuss the hopeless situation; he attended a conference at Tours on 13 June. The Cabinet met again on the 15th and was almost evenly split on the question of an armistice with Germany. Chautemps now suggested that to break the deadlock, that they should get a neutral authority to enquire what the German terms would be, which if honourable, the Cabinet could agree to study. If not, the Cabinet would agree to fight on. The Chautemps proposal passed by 13 to 6.

On 16 June, Charles de Gaulle, now in London, telephoned Reynaud to give him the British government&#x27;s offer of joint nationality for French and British in a Franco-British union. A delighted Reynaud put it to a stormy Cabinet meeting and was supported by five of his ministers. Most of the others were persuaded against him by the arguments of Pétain, Chautemps and Jean Ybarnégaray, the last two seeing the offer as a device to make France subservient to Britain as an extra dominion. Georges Mandel, who had a Jewish background, was flinging accusations of cowardice around the room, and Chautemps and others replied in kind. Reynaud clearly would not accept Chautemps&#x27;s proposal and later resigned.

==Later life==
On 10 July 1940, Chautemps voted as a Senator in favour of granting the cabinet presided by Marshal Philippe Pétain authority to draw up a new constitution, thereby effectively ending the French Third Republic and establishing Vichy France. However, Chautemps broke with Pétain&#x27;s government after he had arrived in the United States on an official mission and lived there for much of the rest of his life. After World War II, a French court convicted him &quot;in absentia&quot; for collaborating with the enemy; he was amnestied in 1954.

After his death in Washington, DC, he was laid to rest in the Rock Creek Cemetery.

<text>Albert-Pierre Sarraut (; 28 July 1872 – 26 November 1962) was a French Radical politician, twice Prime Minister during the Third Republic.

==Biography==
Sarraut was born on 28 July 1872 in Bordeaux, Gironde, France.

On 14 March 1907 Sarraut, Senator of Aude and Under-Secretary of State for the Interior, was ridiculed by Clemenceau for trying to plead the case of his electorate during the revolt of the Languedoc winegrowers. 
Clemenceau told Sarraut, &quot;I know the South, it will all end with a banquet&quot;.
After massive demonstrations in the winegrowing region in June 1907 Clemenceau asked Sarraut to bring the leader Ernest Ferroul to the negotiating table. 
Ferroul told him: &quot;When we have three million men behind us, we do not negotiate&quot;.
From 17 June 1907 the Midi was occupied by 22 regiments of infantry and 12 regiments of cavalry.
The gendarmerie was ordered to imprison the leaders of the demonstrations. 
Sarraut refused to endorse this policy and resigned from the government.

He was Governor-General of French Indochina, from 1912 to 1914 and from 1917 to 1919.
Although Sarraut was celebrated for native education reform, his motivation was an example of paternalism. He believed that the Vietnamese could not be civilized until their thinking, customs and institutions mirrored those of the French. According to Hue Tam Ho Tai, if Sarraut&#x27;s argument was carried to its logical conclusion, the Vietnamese, she writes, would &quot;deserve independence from French rule only when they no longer desired to be Vietnamese, but Frenchmen in yellow skin.&quot;
Albert Sarraut supported actively the preservation and development of native arts, for instance supporting the French art scholar George Groslier in preserving Cambodian arts and cultural traditions, and funding the design and construction of the National Museum of Cambodia.
On 18 January 1920 he replaced Henry Simon as Minister of the Colonies. 

Acting as Minister of the Interior for the Édouard Daladier run government, Sarrault became increasingly concerned with what he considered a flood of Spanish refugees fleeing the Francoist regime during the Spanish Civil War. In April 1938 Sarrault released a statement calling for the &quot;methodical, energetic and prompt action to rid our country of the too numerous undesirable elements&quot;. 

On 10 July 1940, Sarraut voted in favour of granting the Cabinet presided over by Marshal Philippe Pétain authority to draw up a new constitution, thereby effectively ending the French Third Republic and establishing Vichy France. Thereafter Sarraut retired from politics. He took control of the family newspaper, &quot;La Dépêche de Toulouse&quot;, after the editor, his brother Maurice Sarraut, was killed by the Milice in 1943. 

Sarraut died in Paris on 26 November 1962. The Lycée Albert Sarraut in Hanoi was named after him.

<text>Pierre-Étienne Flandin (; 12 April 1889 – 13 June 1958) was a French conservative politician of the Third Republic, leader of the Democratic Republican Alliance (ARD), and Prime Minister of France from 1934 to 1935.

A military pilot during World War I, Flandin held a number of cabinet posts during the interwar period. He was Minister of Commerce, under the premiership of Frédéric François-Marsal, for just five days in 1924. He was Minister of Commerce and Industry in the premierships of André Tardieu in 1931 and 1932. Between those posts, he served under Pierre Laval as Finance Minister. In 1934 (6 February to 8 November), he was Minister of Public Works in the second cabinet of Gaston Doumergue. He became Prime Minister in November 1934, but his premiership lasted only until June 1935. However, a number of important pacts were negotiated during his term: the Franco-Italian Agreement of 1935, the Stresa Front and the Franco-Soviet Pact. Flandin was, at 45, the youngest prime minister in French history.

Flandin was the French Foreign Minister when Adolf Hitler ordered the Wehrmacht to reoccupy the Rhineland on 7 March 1936. He attempted to organize a strong response but was unable to without British support. Supporting appeasement during the Munich crisis hurt his career. On 13 December 1940, Vichy Chief of State Philippe Pétain appointed Flandin Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, replacing Pierre Laval. He occupied that position for only two months.

He was ousted by François Darlan in January 1941.

After the Liberation of France, Flandin was put on trial for treason but the high court acquitted him. He was instead sentenced to 5 years in prison for “national unworthiness”, however his sentence was remitted due to his help of the resistance during the war. 

A street in Avallon was named in his honour. In May 2017, it was renamed in honour of the murdered British MP, Jo Cox.

<text>Pierre Paul Henri Gaston Doumergue (; 1 August 1863 in Aigues-Vives, Gard18 June 1937 in Aigues-Vives) was a French politician who served as President of France from 1924 to 1931.

Tasked with important ministerial portfolios, he was first appointed President of the Council of Ministers in 1913, but was forced to leave power a few months after his appointment. He was elected as President of the Senate in 1923.

At the end of his mandate as President of France, refusing to compete against his eventual successor, Doumergue retired, but chaired a government of national unity during the crisis created by the riots of 6 February 1934.

==Early life and career==
===Protestant origins===
Gaston Doumergue came from a Protestant family. His father, Pierre Doumergue, was a vigneron in Aigues-Vives. His mother, Françoise Pattus, raised him in the Protestant faith and the admiration of republican ideas. He was also the great-uncle of playwright Colette Audry and filmmaker Jacqueline Audry.

A brilliant student, he claimed to have belonged to the &quot;generation of revenge, animated by a beautiful patriotic ardour&quot;, after the defeat of 1870. He studied at the boys&#x27; high school in Nîmes, the future .

===Judiciary===
After a license and a doctorate in law at the School of Law of Paris, he registered in 1885 at the Nîmes bar and participated in the resounding trial of deputy , before entering the judiciary in 1890 as a substitute in Hanoi, French Indochina. His time there was brief because he returned to France on the death of his father in 1891.
==Political career==
===Beginnings in Parliament (1893–1901)===
In 1893, while he was a justice of the peace for the commune of Aïn El Arbaa, he returned to Aigues-Vives in France and presented his candidacy for a partial legislative election in December 1893, intended to fill the seat of , a longtime friend who had just been re-elected in the August 1893 election but died suddenly on 18 November, before the opening of the parliamentary session. Nothing destined him for politics and his grandfather had even refused an appointment as mayor of the village in 1836 because of the modesty of his fortune in a tax system.

Encouraged by his mother who followed his career step-by-step, Doumergue was elected as the Radical deputy for Nîmes with 10,101 votes, beating, in the second round, the mayor of Nîmes, , who obtained only 24 votes. He attended the banquet given in Lyon by President Sadi Carnot on 24 June 1894, during which the latter was fatally stabbed by the Italian anarchist Sante Geronimo Caserio. This event made him realize the seriousness and the danger of the use of power.

He was re-elected deputy on 8 May 1898, in the first round of the ballot, with 11,514 votes against the conservative Albert de Nesmes-Desmarets. He was very involved in France&#x27;s colonial policy and, during his speeches at the podium (which were well-received on the left benches), criticized successive governments for their military interventionism and in particular the occupation of Madagascar. From 1894, he also denounced the &quot;benevolent indifference and not the pronounced sympathy&quot; of public opinion vis-à-vis colonial policy, which masked the looting of conquered territories and the violence of the administration.

His secular and republican convictions made him side with Alfred Dreyfus. His successive mandates were also an opportunity for him to defend small agricultural producers. His influence within the left grew. He was elected deputy for the third time on 27 April 1902, in the first round.

A freemason since 1901, he was initiated into the lodge &quot;L&#x27;Écho du Grand Orient&quot; at the Orient of Nîmes, Grand Orient de France.

===Ministerial portfolios (1902–1910)===
Under the presidency of Émile Loubet, he was Minister of the Colonies in the Émile Combes government from 1902 to 1905.

He was minister without interruption from 1906 to 1910, first for Trade and Industry, where he created the direction of the merchant navy, then for Public Instruction and Fine Arts from 1908, replacing Aristide Briand. In this capacity, on 4 June 1908, he delivered a speech on behalf of the government of Georges Clemenceau during the transfer of Émile Zola&#x27;s ashes to the Panthéon, praising the &quot;heroism&quot; of the writer just as he, on 19 March the previous year, had defended the organization of the transfer ceremony on the Assembly platform, against the anti-Dreyfusards.

A fervent supporter of secular schools, he unleashed the most violent school war in the history of France by filing two &quot;secular defense&quot; projects in June 1908 aimed at punishing families who prevented their children from following an education, even an anti-Catholic one. For this, he received the nickname of &quot;escapee from St. Bartholomew&quot; from the polemicist Édouard Drumont. In the field of education, Doumergue also pleaded in favour of the teaching of Arabic in French Algeria.

He also became vice-president of the Chamber of Deputies for a year, from February 1905 to March 1906, between his two ministries. In 1910, he was elected senator for Gard, after the death of Frédéric Desmons. Doumergue was re-elected in 1912 and 1921.

===First government (1913–1914)===
From 9 December 1913 to 8 June 1914 he was President of the Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs at the request of President Raymond Poincaré, who sought in Doumergue a conciliator capable of forming a cabinet of &quot;republican harmony&quot;. From then on, Doumergue strove to reconcile the demands of the Radical party and the interests of the country, in an international horizon that was becoming darker: the statesman took precedence over the partisan. Doumergue needed to defend the law on three-year military service, which he voted through, not without scrutiny, in August 1913: &quot;None of you is expecting us to reopen the debate: that&#x27;s the law.&quot; The proposal to create an income tax by the finance minister, Joseph Caillaux, triggered a controversy among the conservatives, but was finally voted on in July 1914 by a Senate which had been hostile to it for five years. The &quot;Calmette affair&quot;, which led to the resignation of the minister, put the government in a difficult position as the tenth legislature ended and a delicate electoral campaign began. Doumergue had, however, warned that he &quot;would in no case stay after the elections&quot;.

It was time for a policy of rearmament and closer alliances, which Poincaré and Doumergue carried out successfully. However, Doumergue did not lose sight of the international situation, and the chancelleries were constantly kept on alert. The Radical party easily came out on top in the 1914 French legislative election and this left-wing majority, elected on the theme of peace, caused the President great difficulty in constituting a cabinet that could succeed Doumergue. The latter took advantage of the end of his functions to undertake a trip to Upper Austria.

On 3 August 1914, the day of Germany&#x27;s declaration of war on France, marking the start of World War I, the new president of the council, René Viviani, called on Doumergue to replace him at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, during the composition of his short-lived first government. Then, he was minister of the colonies in the successive governments from 26 August 1914 to 19 March 1917. During this mandate, in the middle of the war, he ensured the security of French possessions and set up a secret agreement with Tsar Nicholas II of Russia which defined the demands that France and Russia would make in future peace negotiations with Germany and Austria-Hungary. However, this treaty became null and void following the October Revolution.

In February 1923, he was elected President of the Senate, replacing Léon Bourgeois.

===President of the Republic (1924–1931)===
====Election to the presidency====
His career culminated with his election as President of the Republic on 13 June 1924, for a seven-year term. This accession to the head of state was the result of several successive political events. The preceding 11 and 25 May saw the victory of the Cartel des Gauches in the legislative elections, despite a higher number of votes for the right and thanks to an electoral law granting a bonus to alliances. Raymond Poincaré, the President of the Council since 1922, having been disavowed, submitted his resignation to President Alexandre Millerand. The cartelists claimed power in the &quot;smallest cogs of the administration&quot;. Paul Painlevé was brought to the head of the Chamber thanks to the votes of the Cartel also led by Léon Blum, Édouard Herriot, and Aristide Briand against the candidate of the right, André Maginot. The appointment of Frédéric François-Marsal was taken as a provocation and his government lasted only two days.

Thus, the left, which forced Alexandre Millerand to resign, then believed it could bring Painlevé to the presidency, but the moderates thwarted his ambitions by massively turning to Gaston Doumergue, who already benefitted from some of the votes on the left. He received 515 votes out of 815 voters, against 309 for Painlevé and 21 for Zéphyrin Camélinat, the first communist candidate in a presidential election.

====Domestic policy====
He appointed the mayor of Lyon, Édouard Herriot, as head of government and charged him with establishing a policy of symbolic change to satisfy the electorate. The cartel state was installed, with its members holding a majority of the presidencies of parliamentary committees, as well as the major positions in the administration. The scandal of irregularities at the Bank of France overthrew the government and Doumergue resolved to appoint Paul Painlevé as President of the Council in order to unite Radical and socialist voices, playing with designations according to the parliamentary pendulum.

On 5 July 1924 Gaston Doumergue proclaimed the official opening of the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris during the opening ceremony held at the Stade olympique de Colombes in the presence of the President of the International Olympic Committee, Pierre de Coubertin, the members of the IOC, the President of the French Olympic Committee, Justinien Clary, the members of the FOC, as well as the 44 participating delegations.

Doumergue&#x27;s seven-year term was marked by the prosperity of France during the interwar period and the &quot;Années folles&quot;, but also by significant ministerial instability and financial difficulties caused by the fall of the franc. Called to the Ministry of Finance in July 1926, Poincaré instituted a policy of austerity by bringing the franc back to its real value through a sharp devaluation. He also restored confidence and managed to boost a flagging economy. This neo-liberal policy also generated a period of economic and financial prosperity, at a time when the United States was hit hard by the stock market crash of 1929. Progress in technical industry, particularly in the steel industry and automobiles, contributed to the country&#x27;s growth. Production capacity thus increased by 45% over the 1920s. To support this development, Doumergue reinforced a centrist policy and instituted workers&#x27; social insurance.

In May 1930, he went to the departments of Algeria, to the lands he had known in the first years of his career, for the commemorations of the centenary of French Algeria, accompanied by a delegation of eight ministers and of several dozen deputies. The following year, a few weeks before the end of his mandate, he commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the French protectorate of Tunisia.

====Foreign policy====
In foreign policy, he declared himself in favour of a policy of firmness vis-à-vis Germany in the face of resurgent nationalism in parts of Europe, but also in France. He ran into difficulties: the Allies were unable to agree on Germany. Forced to evacuate the Ruhr, Saarland, and the Rhineland between 1925 and 1930, Doumergue&#x27;s France was also duped by the German Chancellor Gustav Stresemann despite the signing of the Locarno Treaties.

Disagreements with his foreign minister, Aristide Briand, only aggravated the colonial crises in Syria and the Rif. After failed attempts at consultation by the prefect in place in Morocco, Doumergue decided to send Marshall Philippe Pétain, who quickly won the Rif War. At the same time, he participated in the inauguration of the Grand Mosque of Paris, with the Moroccan sultan Moulay Youssef, who was on an official visit to France. On this occasion, he became the first French president to quote a hadith: &quot;the best Muslim is the one whose believers have neither hand nor tongue to fear&quot;. In French Indochina in the 1920s, the Vietnamese nationalists of the VNQDĐ maintained an independence agitation (assassination of Alfred François Bazin, Yên Bái mutiny, etc.) that colonial authorities repressed with rifle shots and guillotines.

In South America, he helped , the director of the &quot;Compagnie générale aéropostale&quot;, obtain the postal contracts and flyover rights from Brazil and Argentina necessary for the operation of an air transport line.

====Particularities of his presidency====
Within such an unstable political world, Doumergue strove to support the management of public affairs in leftist values and a conservative guideline. An affable and courteous man, he seduced since the beginning of his political career with his good nature and his accent. After his election to the presidency of the Republic, his simplicity continued to earn him popularity in the public opinion, which is reflected in particular by his nickname of &quot;Gastounet&quot;.

Moreover, Doumergue&#x27;s accession to the presidency of the Republic made him the only Protestant head of state known to France since the abjuration of Henry IV, on 25 July 1593. He was also the second unmarried President of the French Republic when he took office, after Napoleon III. Although an &quot;old bachelor&quot;, he was nonetheless, according to historian , &quot;sensitive to feminine charm&quot;, but his frequent passing liaisons were only the &quot;Parisian manners of politicians&quot;. He maintained a long-term liaison with , an associate professor of the university. During his presidential mandate, he had breakfast with her at his former home at 73 Avenue de Wagram every morning, where he went on foot from the Élysée Palace. On 1 June 1931, twelve days before the end of his mandate, he married Gaussal in front of the mayor of the 8th arrondissement of Paris, Gaston Drucker, who had come specially to the Élysée, with the secretary-general of the presidency, Jules Michel, as his witness. Doumergue thus became the first President of the Republic to marry during his mandate.

His presidential mandate ended on 13 June 1931, and he retired from political life to his wife&#x27;s home in Tournefeuille, in Haute-Garonne.

===Return to Council Presidency (1934)===
Still popular, he was recalled as president of the council after the bloody events of 6 February 1934, to form a government of national unity where André Tardieu and Édouard Herriot rubbed shoulders. After having positioned himself at the centre-left of the political spectrum during his first mandate, he gradually neared the centre-right Independent Radicals during his presidency.

His goal was to reform institutions to reduce ministerial instability. This attempt did not succeed; in poor health, it was difficult for him to arbitrate within one of those cabinets in which the greatest hopes are generally placed because they symbolize the unity of the nation, but which are actually made up of ministers from all sides of the political spectrum who do not get along. There was, however, an upturn in public finances, which allowed the price of government bonds to gain ten to twelve points between March and June. He was also weakened by the assassination of Louis Barthou on 9 October, and preferred to resign soon after, on 8 November.
René Viviani, who died in 1925, said of him: &quot;In a well-organized democracy, Doumergue would be a justice of the peace in the provinces.&quot;

==Death and state funeral==
Doumergue died on 18 June 1937 at his house in Aigues-Vives, at the age of 73.

The government organized a state funeral for him, which took place in Nîmes. His grave is located in the small cemetery of Aigues-Vives, where his wife Jeanne () was buried alongside him in 1963.

A bust of Gaston Doumergue is exhibited in the room of the Presidents of the Republic in the Musée de la Révolution française, recalling that he was the first president to be hosted in this former presidential summer residence.

<text>Augustin Alfred Joseph Paul-Boncour (; 4 August 1873 – 28 March 1972) was a French politician and diplomat of the Third Republic. He was a member of the Republican-Socialist Party (PRS) and served as Prime Minister of France from December 1932 to January 1933. He also served in a number of other government positions during the 1930s and as a Permanent Delegate to the League of Nations in 1936 during his tenure as Minister of State.

==Career==
Born in Saint-Aignan, Loir-et-Cher, Paul-Boncour received a law degree from the University of Paris and became active in the labor movement, organizing the legal council of the &quot;Bourses du Travail&quot; (workers&#x27; associations). He was private secretary to Premier Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau from 1898 to 1902. Elected to the Chamber of Deputies as a Radical in 1909, he held his seat until 1914, briefly serving as Minister of Labour from March to June 1911. After serving in the military during World War I, he returned to the French National Assembly.

Turning to Socialism, he joined the SFIO in 1916. Paul-Boncour left the socialist party in 1931 because he considered imperative, in face of the League of Nations progressive powerlessness, to reinforce national defence, something the socialists opposed. After his resignation from the SFIO in 1931 he joined the Republican-Socialist Party (PRS), which in 1935 merged with the French Socialist Party (PSF) and the Socialist Party of France-Jean Jaurès Union (PSdF) to form the Socialist Republican Union (USR). Also in 1931, Paul-Boncour was elected to the Senate, and served in that capacity until the establishment of the Vichy régime in 1940 (during World War II).

During his time as a Senator, Paul-Boncour served in a variety of cabinet and diplomatic posts. He was the Permanent Delegate to the League of Nations from 1932 to 1936, Minister of War in 1932, Premier from December 1932 to January 1933, and Foreign Minister on two occasions (December 1932 to January 1934 and March–April 1938).

Paul-Boncour was opposed to the formation of the Vichy government, and recommended continuing the fight against Nazi Germany after the fall of France, from Algiers. As a member of the Consultative Assembly from 1944, he led the French delegation to the United Nations conference in San Francisco and signed the &quot;United Nations Charter&quot; on behalf of France. He once again served as a senator from 1946 to 1948.

He died in Paris on 28 March 1972 at the age of 98.

<text>Édouard Marie Herriot (; 5 July 1872 – 26 March 1957) was a French Radical politician of the Third Republic who served three times as Prime Minister (1924–1925; 1926; 1932) and twice as President of the Chamber of Deputies. He led the first Cartel des Gauches. Under the Fourth Republic, he served as President of the National Assembly until 1954. A historian by occupation, Herriot was elected to the Académie Française&#x27;s eighth seat in 1946. He served as Mayor of Lyon for more than 45 years, from 1905 until his death, except for a brief period from 1940 to 1945, when he was exiled to Germany for opposing the Vichy regime.

==Life==
Herriot was born at Troyes, France on 5 July 1872. As Mayor of Lyon, Herriot improved relations between municipal government and local unions, increased public assistance funds, and began an urban renewal programme, amongst other measures. He died in Lyon on 26 March 1957. He went through a Deathbed conversion to Catholicism with Cardinal Pierre-Marie Gerlier, and was buried at the Loyasse Cemetery &quot;with church ritual&quot;.

===Denial of the Holodomor===

The height of denial of the Holodomor was reached during a visit to Ukraine carried out between 26 August and 9 September 1933 by Herriot, who had recently left the French Prime Ministry. Herriot denied accounts of the famine and said that Soviet Ukraine was &quot;like a garden in full bloom&quot;.

Furthermore, he announced to the press that there was no famine in Ukraine, that he did not see any trace of hunger, and that the allegations of starving millions were being spread by adversaries of the Soviet Union. &quot;When one believes that the Ukraine is devastated by famine, allow me to shrug my shoulders&quot;, he declared. The 13 September 1933 issue of &quot;Pravda&quot; was able to write that Herriot &quot;categorically contradicted the lies of the bourgeoisie press in connection with a famine in the USSR.&quot;

<text>Théodore Steeg (; 19 December 1868 – 19 December 1950) was a lawyer and professor of philosophy who became Prime Minister of France.

Steeg entered French politics in 1904 as a radical socialist, although his views were generally moderate. He was a Deputy of the Seine from 1904 to 1914 and Senator from 1914 to 1944. At different times he was Minister of Higher Education, Interior, Justice and Colonies. In the 1920s he was in charge of the colonial administrations first of Algeria and then of Morocco. He encouraged irrigation projects to provide land for French &quot;colons&quot; at a time of growing demands for political and economic rights from the indigenous people, accompanied by growing unrest. Steeg was briefly prime minister in 1930–1931.

==Early years==

Jules Joseph Théodore Steeg was born in Libourne, Gironde on 19 December 1868. 
He was of German descent, and his political opponents would later attack him for this fact.
His father, Jules Steeg (1836–1898), was a Protestant pastor who became a journalist and then a radical deputy in the National Assembly.

Théodore&#x27;s mother was Anne-Marie Zoé Tuyès, born in 1840 in Orthez, Basses-Pyrénées.

Théodore Steeg attended the college at Libourne and then studied at the Lycée Henri-IV in Paris. He was admitted to the University of Paris and the Faculty of Law, coming first there in 1887. He obtained the degrees of Bachelor of Laws and Bachelor of Arts in 1890.
He then began studies for the &quot;agrégation&quot; in Philosophy, in which he won first place in 1895.
On 25 October 1892 he married Ewaldine Bonet-Maury (born on 14 June 1872 in Dordrecht, Netherlands). She was the daughter of Gaston Bonet-Maury, a correspondent member of the Institute and a knight of the Legion of Honor, and the sister in law of the government architect Lecoeur. They were to have three daughters. The eldest, Juliette Isabelle, was born on 14 April 1894. She became a doctor and married a doctor.
Théodore Steeg taught at the Alsatian school from 1892 to 1894, then was appointed professor of philosophy at the College of Vannes, and next taught at the College of Niort. In 1897, he co-founded the &quot;People&#x27;s Union&quot; with Ferdinand Buisson, Maurice Bouchor, Émile Duclaux and Pauline Kergomard, and was secretary of the union for two years.
After returning to Paris he taught philosophy at the Alsatian school and at the Lycée Charlemagne until 1904.

==Political career==

===Deputy (1904–1914)===

Théodore Steeg was elected a deputy of the Seine in 1904.
He was aged 35.
He ran as a radical socialist in a by-election to replace Émile Dubois, who had died on 7 May 1904. Steeg was elected in the second round on 24 July 1904 for the second riding of the 14th arrondissement of Paris. As a new deputy, Steeg threw himself into a campaign for the protection and education of children. Steeg became a lawyer in Paris in 1905. He was re-elected with growing majorities in 1906 and 1910. In 1906 he was elected to the Budget Committee, responsible for Posts and Telegraphs. In 1907 he was appointed the rapporteur on the Public Education budget.

Théodore Steeg was appointed Minister of Public Instruction and Beaux-Arts in Ernest Monis&#x27;s cabinet on 2 March 1911.
The Mona Lisa was stolen from the Louvre on 21 August 1911, and Steeg was forced to start an administrative inquiry into how such an important painting could have been stolen from such a major museum.
Steeg was a supporter of the Nouvelle Sorbonne movement with its insistence on basic republican principles. He rejected a petition to revise the Sorbonne reforms of 1902, to which the government was committed.

On 14 January 1912 Steeg became Minister of Interior in Raymond Poincaré&#x27;s government.
That year a Tunis congress of Alienists and Neurologists pointed out the lack of facilities for treating the insane in the colonies. Steeg worked with the Algerian governor-general, Charles Lutaud, to set up a planning commission to improve psychiatric care in the colony.
The committee filed its report in 1914. It recommended building an asylum at Blida, but World War I delayed implementation.

On 21 January 1913 Steeg briefly resumed the post of Minister of Public Instruction and Beaux-Arts in Aristide Briand&#x27;s third and fourth cabinets, holding office until 21 March 1913. He then resumed his seat in the Assembly, where he worked with Maurice Viollette to introduce humanitarian improvements to the Civil Code regarding illegitimate children.

===Senator (1914–1921)===

On 12 March 1914 Théodore Steeg ran in a Senate election in the Seine department to replace Athanase Bassinet, who had died on 12 February 1914.
He was elected on the second ballot. Steeg joined the Democratic Left. World War I (1914–1918) started in July 1914. 
In 1915 Steeg served on the Finance Committee and many special commissions. On 20 March 1917 he joined Alexandre Ribot&#x27;s fifth cabinet as Minister of Public Instruction and Beaux-Arts, where he adopted the law of Wards of the Nation. Paul Painlevé succeeded Ribot on 12 September 1917, at a time when France was struggling for survival.
Steeg was briefly Minister of the Interior in Painlevé&#x27;s cabinet, leaving on 16 November 1917.

In 1918 and 1919 Steeg returned to the ranks. He ran for re-election to the Senate on 11 January 1920 and won the first ballot. On 20 January 1920 Steeg was appointed Minister of Interior in Alexandre Millerand cabinet.
The right had won the election and the appointment of a Radical Socialist to this sensitive position was controversial.
Léon Daudet attacked Steeg, trying unsuccessfully to get Millerand to abandon Steeg&#x27;s nomination. However, Millerand had appointed his friend in part to demonstrate his independence, in part due to his desire to form a &quot;republican union&quot; that rose above party lines, and stood firm.

Steeg had to deal with a general strike launched by the Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT) on 1 May 1920 that first called out transport workers, then miners, seamen, dockers, metalworkers and other trades.
The government moved forcibly to end the strike. On 20 May 1920 Steeg said the government considered that deliberately trying to throw the country&#x27;s economy into chaos was a criminal act. The strike was unsuccessful, and ended with the last workers returning on 28 May 1920.
Steeg retained his position as Minister of Interior in Georges Leygues&#x27;s cabinet of 24 September 1920.
When Aristide Briand formed his cabinet on 16 January 1921, Steeg left the Ministry. 
He was elected president of the new committee on general administration, departmental and communal.

===Algeria (1921–1925)===

Steeg was appointed governor-general of Algeria on 28 July 1921 at a time when the colony was in crisis.
Muslim Algerians had fought for France in the trenches and now expected political rights. 
The Jonnart Law of 4 February 1919 had granted less than the Muslims wanted, but more than the French colons could readily accept.
In April 1922 President Alexandre Millerand visited Algeria to calm the fears of the French &quot;colons&quot; about the growth in numbers of Muslim electors, and to assure them that France would continue to protect their interests. The prefect of Algiers did not want the influential Emir Khalid ibn Hashim (1875–1936) to present his position, but Steeg overrode him. Khaled told Millerand, &quot;The inhabitants of Algeria without racial or religious distinction are equally children of France ... We come to solicit representation in the French Parliament.&quot;

Steeg was able to reduce the tensions and initiate a stable period of economic growth.
As a Radical, Steeg was committed to benevolent civilian administrations in the colonies. However, Steeg inherited a system in Algeria where the local settler assemblies dominated by wealthy landowners controlled taxation and spending. 
There was a tendency to favor spending that boosted the economy over spending on social projects. When Steeg resubmitted the 1914 plan for an asylum at Blida, the assembly delayed approval of funding. 
Steeg was able to initiate major irrigation projects to improve agricultural productivity, a policy he would later repeat in Morocco.
He became known as the &quot;water governor&quot;.

Steeg supported cooperation between Algerian and French West African (AOF) forces in combating &quot;rezzous&quot; (Tuareg raids) in the western Sahara, a constant source of insecurity that prevented development of north-south transport routes. 
In February 1923 he met in Algiers with his counterparts Marshal Hubert Lyautey of Morocco and Lucien Saint of Tunisia to discuss common problems. They agreed that the western Sahara must be treated as a whole, ignoring arbitrary boundaries.
Nomadic migration across borders would be allowed but smuggling would not. 
A joint Algerian-Moroccan police force would operate from a base at Forthassa Rharbia.

On 17 April 1925 Steeg was unexpectedly called back to France to become Minister of Justice in Painlevé&#x27;s second cabinet.
Painlevé needed left-wing politicians such as Steeg, Briand, Caillaux, Monzie and Laval in his cabinet so he could gain support for his program, which was essentially conservative.
Steeg was succeeded in Algeria by Viollette.

===Morocco (1925–1928)===

In April 1925 Abd-el-Krim proclaimed the independent Rif Republic in the Rif region of Spanish Morocco.
He advanced south into French Morocco, defeating French forces and threatening the capital, Fes. 
The resident-general, Hubert Lyautey, was replaced as military commander by Philippe Pétain on 3 September 1925.
On 11 October 1925 Steeg replaced Lyautey as resident-general with the mandate of restoring peace and making the transition from military to civilian government.
Lyautey received very little recognition for his achievement in securing Morocco as a colony.
Steeg would have been willing to give autonomy to the people of the Rif, but was overruled by the army. 
Abd-el-Krim surrendered to Pétain on 26 May 1926 and was deported to Réunion in the Indian Ocean, where he was held until 1947.
Steeg said he wanted Abd el Krim to be &quot;neither exalted nor humiliated, but in time forgotten.&quot;

Steeg moved quickly to resolve the most acute social problems.
Steeg appointed men who had worked with him in Algeria to key posts, and brought many more Frenchmen into the administration. 
There were 66,000 Europeans in Morocco when he arrived, most of them citizens of France.
Steeg favored bringing more French settlers into the country.
In his first three years he introduced almost as many colonists to Morocco as his predecessor had in thirteen.
Steeg issued a decree of 4 January 1927 that created a fund for large scale irrigation projects such as the El Kansera dam on the Beth and the N&#x27;fis dam, 
both of which were started that year.
Through his &quot;grands barrages&quot; projects he planned to bring year-round irrigation to of land.
Irrigation would make new land available for French settlers, and would allow for denser settlement.

Steeg temporarily banned the &quot;Ha-Olam&quot; journal of the World Zionist Organization, 
but generally allowed publication of pro-Zionist newspapers and permitted Zionist activity.
At a meeting of the French League for Human Rights in 1926 he said that the Jews were progressing faster than Muslims.
Educated Moroccan Jews should be able to apply to become French citizens.
Some observers were disturbed by the shift from Lyautey&#x27;s sympathy for the Moroccans and respect for their customs to Steeg&#x27;s policy of land expropriation and French colonization, which seemed sure to create mounting hostility between the two peoples.
Steeg favored assimilation of the indigenous cadres into the French administration to avoid competition between the two, 
which he felt would weaken the government&#x27;s authority.
In contrast to Lyautey, Steeg spent little time with the Sultan and other members of the Moroccan elite. 
His selection of Sidi Mohammed Ben Youssef as the new Sultan in 1927 may have been due to a desire for an inexperienced young ruler who would conform to his wishes.

The effect of Steeg&#x27;s policies was for the traditional elite to lose power as pastoralists and subsistence farmers left the land to work for wages in the city. 
Many of the new &quot;colons&quot; came from Algeria, and were intolerant to the &quot;natives&quot;, seeing them as no more than unskilled laborers. Racial tensions increased.
There was growing demand for Moroccan labor, and labor shortages emerging in some areas.
Steeg was pressed by socialists to pass social laws to give workers the same protection as in France, and to create organizations for the protection of labor. He responded that because of the many foreign workers, and an indigenous population not yet ready to benefit from such measures, he could do no more than study the possibility.
Various &quot;seditious&quot; organizations emerged with communist or pan-Islamic goals, or both, including the Egypt-based Union Maghrébine and El Mountadda el Abaddi. In a report to the Foreign Ministry of 27 December 1927, Steeg said the Union Maghrébine had 1,500 supporters in the cities of Fez, Casablanca and Tangiers. The Sûreté kept these groups under observation, routinely arresting and imprisoning leaders and seizing material.

A fourth North African conference was held in Algiers in May 1927. Steeg participated for Morocco, Maurice Viollette for Algeria and Lucien Saint for Tunisia. General Jules Carde of French West Africa was represented by Albert Duchêne, the Director of Political Affairs at the Ministry of Colonies. 
Steeg was asked to act more decisively to suppress dissidence in the region to the south of the Atlas Mountains. However, Moroccan forces were still tied up in what was proving to be a slow campaign to eliminate resistance in the north of the High Atlas.
It was agreed that troops from Algeria and Mauritania could enter Moroccan territory, up to defined boundaries, but without prejudice to Morocco&#x27;s later taking part in pacifying the western Sahara.

In 1927 Steeg was re-elected to the Senate. When the Pujols, Gironde, cantonal elections of 1928 were held, Steeg was unable to retain his position as General Counsel of Gironde while also sitting as Senator for the Seine and holding office in Morocco.
Steeg left the Residence of Morocco in January 1929 and was replaced by Lucien Saint.

===Later career (1929–1950)===

From 1929 to 1935 Steeg was a member of the Committee on Colonies, and became president of the committee. He also belonged to the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Committee of Algeria and the Education committee. Steeg was Minister of Justice in Camille Chautemps&#x27;s short-lived government (21 February – 1 March 1930) replacing Lucien Hubert.
He was succeeded in this position by Raoul Péret.

The government of André Tardieu was defeated by a Senate vote at the start of December 1930, and after several days of negotiation a new government was formed, headed by Steeg, much further to the left than any recent governments. 
He accepted the position of President of the Council, and simultaneously Minister of Colonies, on 13 December 1930.
The right-wing &quot;Action Française&quot; launched violent attacks on the new government. It called the Minister of Defense, Louis Barthou, &quot;mad, vicious, corrupt&quot;. Steeg, the son and grandson of Prussians, was clearly a traitor.
Although he had the support of the Senate, he could not get a stable majority in the House for his moderate policies, and was thrown out of office on 22 January 1931 when he lost a vote on agricultural policy and wheat speculation.

Steeg was elected to the Senate again on 14 January 1936. He remained chairman of the committee on the Colonies and member of the committees on Foreign Affairs, Algeria and Education.
Under the first government of Léon Blum (in office 4 June 1936 – 22 June 1937) Steeg was appointed head of a commission to study socio-economic conditions in the French colonial empire.
The North African sub-committee included leading figures such as Paul Reynaud, Henry Bérenger, Charles-André Julien and Paul Rivet. Meeting on 8 July 1937, this sub-committee decided to focus on labor conditions in the Maghreb.
They were too late to prevent the escalation of widespread and violent labor unrest in the region, which was violently suppressed.
Steeg was briefly Minister of Colonies in Camille Chautemps&#x27;s fifth cabinet, from 18 January to 13 March 1938.
He replaced Marius Moutet, a supporter of a plan to settle Jewish refugees in Madagascar.
Steeg was hostile to this plan. He said that the urbanized Jewish settlers would not have the skills needed to work the land, 
but would engage in small-scale commerce &quot;at the expense of the local economy and the natives.&quot;
He also said the plan would be too expensive, and would be widely criticized in the press. Steeg recommended that Jews should look for help to the Jewish Colonization Association rather than to his ministry.

Steeg was Minister of State in Léon Blum&#x27;s second cabinet (13 March 1938 – 10 April 1938).
World War II broke out in September 1939. After the armistice with Germany, at the Congress of Vichy on 10 July 1940 Steeg voluntarily abstained during the vote on transferring constitutional powers to Marshal Philippe Pétain.
Théodore Steeg died on 19 December 1950 in the 14th arrondissement of Paris on his 82nd birthday.

<text>Paul Painlevé (; 5 December 1863 – 29 October 1933) was a French mathematician and statesman. He served twice as Prime Minister of the Third Republic: 12 September – 13 November 1917 and 17 April – 22 November 1925. His entry into politics came in 1906 after a professorship at the Sorbonne that began in 1892.

His first term as prime minister lasted only nine weeks but dealt with weighty issues, such as the Russian Revolution, the American entry into the war, the failure of the Nivelle Offensive, quelling the French Army Mutinies and relations with the British. In the 1920s as Minister of War he was a key figure in building the Maginot Line. In his second term as prime minister he dealt with the outbreak of rebellion in Syria&#x27;s Jabal Druze in July
1925 which had excited public and parliamentary anxiety over the general crisis of France&#x27;s empire.

== Biography ==

===Early life===
Painlevé was born in Paris. Brought up within a family of skilled artisans (his father was a draughtsman) Painlevé showed early promise across the range of elementary studies and was initially attracted by either an engineering or political career. However, he finally entered the École Normale Supérieure in 1883 to study mathematics, receiving his doctorate in 1887 following a period of study at Göttingen, Germany with Felix Klein and Hermann Amandus Schwarz. Intending an academic career he became professor at Université de Lille, returning to Paris in 1892 to teach at the Sorbonne, École Polytechnique and later at the Collège de France and the École Normale Supérieure. He was elected a member of the Académie des Sciences in 1900.

He married Marguerite Petit de Villeneuve in 1901. Marguerite died during the birth of their son Jean Painlevé in the following year.

Painlevé&#x27;s mathematical work on differential equations led him to encounter their application to the theory of flight and, as ever, his broad interest in engineering topics fostered an enthusiasm for the emerging field of aviation. In 1908, he became Wilbur Wright&#x27;s first airplane passenger in France and in 1909 created the first university course in aeronautics.

===Mathematical work===

Some differential equations can be solved using elementary algebraic operations that involve the trigonometric and exponential functions (sometimes called elementary functions). Many interesting special functions arise as solutions of linear second order ordinary differential equations. Around the turn of the century, 
Painlevé, É. Picard, and B. Gambier showed that
of the class of nonlinear second order ordinary differential equations with polynomial coefficients, those that possess a certain desirable technical property, shared by the linear equations (nowadays commonly referred to as the &#x27;Painlevé property&#x27;) can always be transformed into one of fifty canonical forms. Of these fifty equations, just six require &#x27;new&#x27; transcendental functions for their solution. These new transcendental functions, solving the remaining six equations, are called the Painlevé transcendents, and interest in them has revived recently due to their appearance in modern geometry, integrable systems and statistical mechanics.

In 1895 he gave a series of lectures at Stockholm University on differential equations, at the end stating the Painlevé conjecture about singularities of the n-body problem. In the same year he published work on the Painlevé paradox, an apparent contradiction in simple models of friction.

In the 1920s, Painlevé briefly turned his attention to the new theory of gravitation, general relativity, which had recently been introduced by Albert Einstein. In 1921, Painlevé proposed the Gullstrand–Painlevé coordinates for the Schwarzschild metric. The modification in the coordinate system was the first to reveal clearly that the Schwarzschild radius is a mere coordinate singularity (with however, profound global significance: it represents the event horizon of a black hole). This essential point was not generally appreciated by physicists until around 1963. In his diary, Harry Graf Kessler recorded that during a later visit to Berlin, Painlevé discussed pacifist international politics with Einstein, but there is no reference to discussions concerning the significance of the Schwarzschild radius.

===Early political career===
Between 1915 and 1917, Painlevé served as French Minister for Public Instruction and Inventions. In December 1915, he requested a scientific exchange agreement between France and Britain, resulting in Anglo-French collaboration that ultimately led to the parallel development by Paul Langevin in France and Robert Boyle in Britain of the first active sonar. He also established the Directorate of Inventions for National Defense, the predecessor of the French National Centre for Scientific Research.

===First period as French Prime Minister===
Painlevé took his aviation interests, along with those in naval and military matters, with him when he became, in 1906, Deputy for Paris&#x27;s 5th arrondissement, the so-called Latin Quarter. By 1910, he had vacated his academic posts and World War I led to his active participation in military committees, joining Aristide Briand&#x27;s cabinet in 1915 as Minister for Public Instruction and Inventions.

On his appointment as War Minister in March 1917 he was immediately called upon to give his approval, albeit with some misgivings, to Robert Georges Nivelle&#x27;s wildly optimistic plans for a breakthrough offensive in Champagne. Painlevé reacted to the disastrous public failure of the plan by dismissing Nivelle and controversially replacing him with Henri Philippe Pétain. He was also responsible for isolating the Russian Expeditionary Force in France in the La Courtine camp, located in a remote spot on the plateau of Millevaches.

On 7 September 1917, Prime Minister Alexandre Ribot lost the support of the Socialists and Painlevé was called upon to form a new government.

Painlevé was a leading voice at the Rapallo conference that led to the establishment of the Supreme Allied Council, a consultative body of Allied powers that anticipated the unified Allied command finally established in the following year. He appointed Ferdinand Foch as French representative knowing that he was the natural Allied commander. On Painlevé&#x27;s return to Paris he was defeated and resigned on 13 November 1917 to be succeeded by Georges Clemenceau. Foch was finally named Allied &quot;generalissimo&quot; in March 1918, eventually becoming commander-in-chief of all Allied armies on the Western and Italian fronts.

===Second period as French Prime Minister===
Painlevé then played little active role in politics until the election of November 1919 when he emerged as a leftist critic of the right-wing Bloc National. By the time the next election approached in May 1924 his collaboration with Édouard Herriot, a fellow member of Briand&#x27;s 1915 cabinet, had led to the formation of the Cartel des Gauches. Winning the election, Herriot became Prime Minister in June, while Painlevé became President of the Chamber of Deputies. Though Painlevé ran for President of France in 1924 he was defeated by Gaston Doumergue. Herriot&#x27;s administration publicly recognised the Soviet Union, accepted the Dawes Plan and agreed to evacuate the Ruhr. However, a financial crisis arose from the ensuing devaluation of the franc and in April 1925, Herriot fell and Painlevé became Prime Minister for a second time on 17 April. Unfortunately, he was unable to offer convincing remedies for the financial problems and was forced to resign on 21 November.

===Later political career===
Following Painlevé&#x27;s resignation, Briand formed a new government with Painlevé as Minister for War. Though Briand was defeated by Raymond Poincaré in 1926, Painlevé continued in office. Poincaré stabilised the franc with a return to the gold standard, but ultimately acceded power to Briand. During his tenure as Minister of War, Painlevé was instrumental in the creation of the Maginot Line. This line of military fortifications along France&#x27;s Eastern border was largely designed by Painlevé, yet named for André Maginot, owing to Maginot&#x27;s championing of public support and funding. Painlevé remained in office as Minister for War until July 1929.

From 1925 to 1933, Painlevé represented France in the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations (he replaced Henri Bergson and was himself replaced by Édouard Herriot).

Though he was proposed for President of France in 1932, Painlevé withdrew before the election. He became Minister of Air later that year, making proposals for an international treaty to ban the manufacture of bomber aircraft and to establish an international air force to enforce global peace. On the fall of the government in January 1933, his political career ended.

Painlevé died in Paris in October of the same year. On 4 November, after a eulogy by Prime Minister Albert Sarraut, he was interred in the Panthéon.

<text>Black &amp; White is a god video game developed by Lionhead Studios and published by Electronic Arts for Microsoft Windows in 2001 and by Feral Interactive in 2002 for Mac OS. &quot;Black &amp; White&quot; combines elements of artificial life and strategy. The player acts as a god whose goal is to defeat Nemesis, another god who wants to take over the world. A primary theme is the concept of good and evil, with the atmosphere being affected by the player&#x27;s moral choices. The core gameplay mechanic of &quot;Black &amp; White&quot; is the interaction between the player and an avatar creature, who carries out the player&#x27;s instructions and whose personality and behaviour change in reaction to how they are treated. Multiplayer is supported over a local network or online.

Peter Molyneux led the three-year development of the highly anticipated game, originally to feature wizards instead of gods. &quot;Black &amp; White&quot; was written from scratch, and the intention was to have the main user interface free of icons, buttons, and panels. Versions for games consoles were in development, but were cancelled.

&quot;Black &amp; White&quot; received universal acclaim on release; reviewers praised the artificial intelligence, uniqueness, and depth, although the system requirements and bugs were criticised. &quot;Black &amp; White&quot; won awards from several organisations, including the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences and the Guinness World Record, for the complexity of the artificial intelligence, selling over two million copies. Later re-reviews of the game considered it to have been overrated at the time, but was nevertheless considered one of the greatest games of all time. An expansion, &quot;Black &amp; White: Creature Isle&quot;, and sequel, &quot;Black &amp; White 2&quot;, followed.

Since its original release, Lionhead and its intellectual property were purchased by Microsoft, while EA retain the publishing rights. The game was never re-released, and it has been described as abandonware.

== Gameplay ==

The player takes on the role of a god ruling over several islands populated by various tribes. The player interacts with the environment via an animated, on-screen hand, that is used to throw people and objects, tap houses to wake their occupants, cast miracles, and perform other actions. Key items in the story are gold and silver scrolls. Gold scrolls initiate a significant event (including the main story), and silver ones a minor task to perform for a reward.

Nearly every action (or lack thereof) affects how the player is judged by their followers: the player may be seen as a good god, an evil one, or in-between the two. The land, interface (including the hand), and music change according to that alignment. A good god&#x27;s temple is brightly coloured, while an evil god&#x27;s is designed to look intimidating. It is not necessary to consistently perform acts of either alignment and a mixture of the two can be used to stay neutral. The player has two advisors, one good and the other evil, who try to persuade the player to do things according to their alignment.

An important task is expanding the villages, by constructing buildings and increasing the number of villagers. Important buildings include houses, the Village Centre (which displays the god who controls the village and the available miracles), and the Village Store (which stores resources and displays the villagers&#x27; desires). Buildings are created in the Workshop after obtaining blueprints. Wonders are special buildings granting a specific benefit. Villagers belong to one of eight tribes, such as Norse, Celtic, or Japanese, each having a different Wonder. Villagers can be assigned to perform a specific task such as fishing or starting a family. If the Temple is destroyed, the game is lost. When attacked, Temples transfer damage to their god&#x27;s buildings and followers in defence; only Temples whose god has no followers are vulnerable.

The Temple is surrounded by sites where villagers worship, generating the power needed to cast miracles. Villagers require feeding, healing or rest to worship. How many villagers worship is controlled at the Village Centre, and which miracles are available depends on those available at the player&#x27;s villages. Miracles include providing food or wood, healing people, and providing shields to protect an area. Miracles can also be cast by using Miracle Dispensers, a common reward for completing Silver Reward Scrolls. These allow the casting of a miracle without worship. Miracles can only be cast, and most other actions performed, within the player&#x27;s area of influence, which can be extended by expanding the population of villages owned, or by taking over others. Miracles can be selected at the Temple or Village Centre, or by performing certain gestures with the Hand. Power can also be produced by sacrificing living beings at the altar.

The general goal of a level is to gain control over every village on an island, accomplished through acts that persuade the villagers to believe in the player. Villagers can be swayed by everything from assistance with day-to-day tasks to being terrorised by fireballs and lightning storms. Artefacts (special objects that glow in their owner&#x27;s colour) and missionary disciples can be used to impress villagers. Villagers become bored with repetitive attempts to impress them. For example, if boulders fly overhead too frequently, their effect is lost. This forces the player to use multiple methods to convert a village.

The game features a skirmish mode, where other gods are battled for control of an island, a multiplayer mode over a local area network (LAN) or an online service, and The God&#x27;s Playground, where gameplay aspects can be practised. In multiplayer mode, deathmatch and cooperative modes are available. In cooperative mode, players share a creature. &quot;Black &amp; White&quot; includes a feature enabling the import of real weather.

One of &quot;Black &amp; White&quot;″s core features is the interaction between the player and an avatar-like creature. Three are available to select from the beginning of the game and others can be obtained by completing Silver Reward Scrolls. The currently-owned creature can be swapped with a new one at certain points in the game. The creature starts out small, and grows as the game progresses. Each has strengths and weaknesses: apes are intelligent and proficient at learning but lack strength; tigers are strong but learn slowly.

As a god, the player can teach their creature to perform tasks such as stocking the village store or performing miracles. The creature is taught what and when to eat, and how to attack or impress enemy villages. Fighting skills may be taught in one-on-one battles with other creatures; attack and defence abilities can be improved. Teaching is performed using a reinforcement learning system: if the creature does something the player does not want, it can be discouraged with a slap. If the creature does something the player approves of, it can be stroked. The creature remembers the response to various actions and gradually changes its behaviour accordingly. With time and repetition, it can perform complex functions that allow it to serve as the player&#x27;s avatar. Three types of leashes are used to command the creature to go to a specific place, and can be tied to a building to restrict movement. One leash encourages the creature to pay attention when actions are demonstrated; the others encourage either benevolent or malevolent behaviour. The game reinforces the creature&#x27;s choices and learning by providing visual feedback, and the creature has an alignment separate from the player&#x27;s. Evil wolves sport glowing eyes and large fangs and claws; good ones turn a shade of purple and glow gently.

Lionhead Studios used Michael Bratman&#x27;s belief–desire–intention model to simulate creatures&#x27; learning and decision-making processes. A creature forms an intention by combining desires, opinions, and beliefs. Beliefs are attributed to lists that store data about various world objects. Desires are goals the creature wants to fulfill, expressed as simplified perceptrons. Opinions describe ways of satisfying a desire using decision trees. For each desire, the creature selects the belief with the best opinion, thus forming an intention or goal.

== Plot ==
The player begins on an island as a new god, created from a family&#x27;s prayers. After saving their son from sharks, the god follows the grateful family to their village. A large creature (a lion, a bear or a sheep, depending on your creature), known as the Guide, is later discovered who tells the player of its former master, a god named Nemesis, who desires to reign supreme as the one true god by destroying all others. The player is told of the Creed; an energy source with the ability to destroy gods. Nemesis, upon hearing this, destroys his former creature and attacks the village. Shortly after a mysterious vortex opens and the player enters to escape Nemesis. He&#x27;s transported to a second island and greeted by another god, Khazar. Khazar reveals that it was he who sent the vortex and requests assistance against another god, Lethys, Nemesis&#x27; underling, in exchange for resources to rebuild the village.

Later, Nemesis destroys Khazar and his creature, stealing his piece of the Creed in the process. Lethys then kidnaps the player&#x27;s creature, taking it through a vortex that, unlike the others, closes automatically. In the third land, the creature is held in stasis by three magical pillars. After the creature is freed by converting the villages (and avoiding their reconversion by both burning unbelievers and a wolf pack), Lethys implores the player not to take his last village, grants the player a piece of the Creed and opens a vortex. The player returns to the first land, now cursed by Nemesis; fireballs and lightning rain from the sky. After the curses are lifted by destroying the three guardian stones, a cursed village is freed and the piece of the Creed is claimed, Nemesis appears, inviting the player to his realm. On the last island, Nemesis curses the player&#x27;s creature, causing it to slowly change alignments, shrink, and grow weaker. When the final piece of the Creed is obtained, the player destroys Nemesis and is left as the only god in the world.

== Development and release ==
=== History ===

&quot;Black &amp; White&quot; took over three years to develop beginning on 14 February 1998, and was released on 27 March 2001. Peter Molyneux funded the project himself and devoted his entire focus to its development. Molyneux stated that he tried to correct the mistakes he made with the game design of &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;. The goal was to develop a unique game where players felt they inhabited a world where they could do anything. Molyneux had liked the idea of controlling people as a god since his previous venture, &quot;Populous&quot;. He was interested in the concept of good and evil and thought that this could be used to influence the game&#x27;s atmosphere. Development was slow, starting with only six people, as Molyneux wanted to assemble the right team. Discussions about concepts (including a Mafia-style game) began at his house in 1997, and in February 1998, the team moved into Lionhead&#x27;s offices. The expanded nine-person team exchanged further suggestions for the game and its content, such as lip-synchronised characters, although this was thought impossible. As more people joined, Molyneux wanted Lionhead&#x27;s friendly atmosphere to remain, and their policy of only recruiting people who could fit in with existing members meant that the team had developed their own way of working. According to Molyneux, team members questioned and competed with each other, resulting in a better quality of work. He said that &quot;the team did the work of a group twice their number.&quot; The group that finally produced the game numbered twenty-five programmers with a budget of approximately £4 million.

Molyneux stated that &quot;King Kong&quot; was an inspiration for the game. Soon afterwards, watching the &quot;Outer Limits&quot; episode &quot;The Sandkings&quot;, he noticed that the episode featured bug-like creatures worshipping a scientist, and who moved around him in reverence whenever he was nearby. Molyneux thought that being admired with that level of devotion made one a god. Molyneux told &quot;Official Dreamcast Magazine&quot; that he had sought to recreate the &quot;fantastic feeling&quot; of destroying ant nests as a child.

In 1998, &quot;Black &amp; White&quot; was shown at the E3 trade show in Atlanta, Georgia, and incorporated elements of &quot;Populous&quot; and &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;. Molyneux estimated the game would be nearly finished in 1999, and scheduled it for a late September 2000 release. Artificial intelligence was one of the key areas still being worked on. The game crashed multiple times; Molyneux fixed the bugs using Microsoft Developer Studio before restarting. He expected the 3D engine used would be an improvement when compared to his previous games. He instructed the programmers to &quot;Make it the most beautiful engine ever conceived by anybody, ever&quot;. As of December 1998, no animators had been hired, and the art team were developing their own skills in that area. By this time, the engine was being developed by three people: Alex Evans, Jean-Claude Cuttier, and Scawen Roberts (who had joined from a courier company called, coincidentally, Black And White). Cottier developed the landscape system, and found a method of generating textures, enabling the reflection of various types of terrain. Roberts created the creatures and the animation (Eric Bailey later took over the creature animations). Evans described developing the engine as &quot;a daunting task&quot;. Composer Russell Shaw came up with the idea of the world changing appearance according to the player&#x27;s alignment: he suggested that the player&#x27;s territory loses colour if he plays evil, and for it to be gaily coloured if good. Artist Mark Healey wanted the cursor to be a magician&#x27;s hand.

The entire game, including the tools and libraries, was written from scratch. A trial and error approach was taken: the team learned by trying something and changing what did not work. They avoided using control panels, icons and buttons for casting miracles, preferring a gesture system. Molyneux commented that he would have been very disappointed if the system was dumped, but in the end, they got the feature working &quot;beautifully&quot;. Integrating the storyline was found to draw the player through the game in an unexpected manner, which led to the development of characters like Sable, the Creature trainer, and the advisers. A great deal of effort was devoted to getting features such as the weather import working.

The game was originally to feature battling wizards, who would have had creatures (originally named Titans) to raise, and be powered by belief. A key idea was the ability to turn living beings into Titans. Healey&#x27;s early visualisation featured the Horned Reaper from &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; representing Titans. The team wanted the player to see the world from the same perspective as possessing a creature in &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; (it was originally intended for the player to be able to take control of creatures in the first-person). Molyneux wanted &quot;limitless flexibility&quot; and the ability to zoom out to see the world from the sky. It was decided to make the player a god when it was realised that humans could not wield the powers that were being implemented. The spells that were to be cast became miracles, and the wizards&#x27; supporters became worshippers. The mechanic of turning living beings into Titans was dropped because of problems with balance, with certain Titans having advantages over others. After the name Titans was dropped, others were considered, including Sards, Demes, Ikons, Psiphs, and Amalians. None had unanimous support, so they ended up being called &#x27;creatures&#x27;. Elements of the Wizard theme, such as Temples resembling a wizard&#x27;s tower, remain in the final game. Temples were originally named Citadels and some sported a medieval, fairy-tale look.

In January 1999, Richard Evans was working out how the game judges the morality of the player&#x27;s behaviour. Mark Webley (who had programmed the creature&#x27;s artificial intelligence on a testbed version) had become project manager, ensuring routines were listed on task schedules. He stated that this was &quot;a hundred times more difficult&quot; than similar tasks at Bullfrog Productions. By March, the team had expanded to 17 people including five artists, five game programmers, two engine programmers, and a sound programmer. Lionhead wanted a maximum of 25 people so as not to break the &quot;team spirit&quot; atmosphere. &quot;Black &amp; White&quot; was shown at E3 1999 where it was judged the most original game. At this time, Lionhead were considering 15 cover designs provided by Electronic Arts.

At E3 2000, Molyneux gave a precise release date: 23 September 2000. The game was supposed to reach the alpha stage by 18 June, but by summer, it became clear that development was behind schedule, and the release date was pushed back to 10 November. In September, it was pushed back again into 2001, angering fans who were eagerly awaiting its release. Molyneux apologised for the delay. By September 2000, every Lionhead member had their faces digitised for use on villagers. Villagers were auctioned online at QXL, with all proceeds going to the National Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children. The team were surprised when the first one sold for £450, and the fourth one for over £1000. By October, Lionhead were operating around the clock to reach alpha. Shin Kanaoya of EA Square came to discuss the Japanese localisation, which was considered difficult due to the requirement of the use of two-byte characters to display the Japanese writing system, particularly the 20,000 Kanji characters, which would have posed RAM management issues. Lionhead were considering using the Japanese fonts included with Windows. In September, there were &quot;dozens&quot; of fansites about &quot;Black &amp; White&quot;. By November, there were around 150. Molyneux later said that &quot;Black &amp; White&quot; was amongst the first video games to have fansites, and that Lionhead were accused of over-promising when the sites described features the game did not have when shown.

Molyneux said that might have been &quot;insanely ambitious&quot; with regard to the standards they set themselves for the graphics, because the system requirements were high and much of the custom software needed to be written. One such program was a terrain-editing tool named Leadhead. He stated that they went from &quot;bizarre ideas&quot;, to &quot;the best game I have ever seen&quot;. The villagers&#x27; artificial intelligence had to be restricted by giving some control to the Village Centre as there was no limit on the number of villagers. Molyneux said of the creature&#x27;s artificial intelligence, &quot;part of the game itself learns from everything you do and tailors itself to you&quot;, and described the creature as &quot;an astonishing piece of work&quot;. He also commented that the last months of development were &quot;the hardest any of us has ever had to work&quot;, and that &quot;without the right team, this game never would have happened.&quot; The models for the trees, bushes, and other landscape features were created in 3D Studio Max, and initial graphics development was done in 2D using Adobe Photoshop. Later development was done using other custom software. Clan multiplayer, where multiple players play as one god, was developed in a rush; its interface had to be developed in two weeks. &quot;Black &amp; White&quot;″s online community was handled by two servers in London, where the clan creatures were stored to minimise the possibility of cheating.

Alpha was reached in December 2000. Multiplayer mode nearly had to be dropped for this to happen, but the problems were fixed just in time. Electronic Arts became involved in the production; testers were employed (they found three thousand bugs), localisations were checked, and a marketing campaign was launched. Fearing the bugs could kill the game, lists were sent to every member of the team, who had a chart, updated daily. The biggest problem was the final set, and fixing them created more bugs. Molyneux commented that &quot;It was as if the game just didn&#x27;t want to be finished and perfected&quot;, and remarked that the team felt like they had run a marathon after fixing the bugs. The end product was so large that they &quot;almost felt lost within the code&quot; which consisted of over a million lines, and took over an hour to compile. The music, dialogue, and sound effects were compressed to fit on one CD, as they took five times as much space as the game. People not involved with the game&#x27;s development began playing it and were extremely impressed. The release date was then set at 23 February 2001. Electronic Arts complained that the age at which the villagers were reproducing was below the age of consent for some countries, so this had to be changed. Lionhead announced that the game went gold (became ready to be released) on 16 March 2001. Molyneux credited fans for making the hardest times worthwhile. Because players encountered technical issues, rumours that Electronic Arts had shipped beta versions circulated; Lionhead denied them. Molyneux said &quot;Black &amp; White&quot; was the most important and difficult game he had made. In June, a patch that fixed bugs was released. The Japanese version was released on 24 May 2001, and re-released as &quot;Black &amp; White Special Edition&quot; under the EA Best Selections branding on 18 March 2004. Another patch was released, which would allow the Hand to be controlled by an Essential Reality P5 Glove, a virtual reality glove.

=== Story and characters ===

Work on the story began in October 1999, and took longer than expected. The team estimated two months, but soon realised they lacked the necessary skills to meet this deadline. Bullfrog&#x27;s James Leach, who had previously worked on titles such as &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; and &quot;Theme Hospital&quot;, was recruited, and wrote many challenges, all the dialogue, and enabled the team to make the advisers characters rather than just sources of information. The idea to make the advisers characters came from Alex Evans, who wanted them to interact with their lips synchronised. A system was developed that moved their mouths into common phoneme shapes, used as a basis to turn them into graphic equalisers that move into shapes according to the sounds being played. This facilitated localisation, as the game was to be translated into fifteen languages. Both advisers were voiced by Marc Silk, cutting the recording time by roughly half. The initial designs were produced by artist Christian Bravery, but these were considered too similar to classic devils and angels. Healey redesigned the angel to be more like a fairy. He was accused of putting his girlfriend into the game, something which he agreed with on reflection: he admitted that it looked &quot;rather a lot like her&quot;. He then designed an old man resembling a cross between a hippy, a yogi, and a &quot;kindly old man&quot;. The advisers&#x27; animations and emotions were triggered by keywords in the script document, a Microsoft Excel file consisting of several thousand lines. Much of the script was for the advisers, as they were to comment on everything happening as well as the other things players may want to do.

The challenges and quests were developed to keep players occupied while playing through the story. Molyeux told Leach about the ways of good and evil and the system&#x27;s reflection of the player&#x27;s behaviour, and provided him with a digital copy of the Bible with instructions to study the concepts due to their connection with gods and men. Leach decided to supplement the idea of evil with mischief, as he thought being completely evil by annoying or killing followers was senseless. Molyneux wanted a conflict between good and evil, and for the enemy gods to have the opposite alignment to the player. As a method of introducing the player to miracles and combat, a god whose alignment is the same as the player&#x27;s was added.

Leach, Molyneux, and Webley were considering the final story when Jamie Durrant, an artist, became involved in the scripting language. A level designer, Ken Malcolm, was also hired, and their skills were considered invaluable. Malcolm said that the challenges were imagined as films with multiple endings because the story elements were different to games based on levels. According to him, the team had to &quot;forget the rules&quot; and focus on what players would do.

World domination was the story&#x27;s goal. The Creed was a way of achieving that goal without having to convert every tribe. The intent was for the Creeds to be hosted inside creatures, obtainable only after the creature was dead. Winning the game would require three Creeds of the same alignment and their placement in the volcano on the fifth land. The explosion would &quot;shatter the world&quot; and the world would be the player&#x27;s. As the story evolved, it was decided that the game should not force the player through it, as it would restrict his freedom. The team also wanted players to explore the world. The solution to this problem came in the form of the Gold Story Scrolls.

The other gods&#x27; actions and dialogue were written to be neutral as they could be either good or evil. Some were influenced by the player&#x27;s alignment, but some lines were spoken regardless of the player&#x27;s alignment due to lack of space. The concept of good and evil also affected the gods&#x27; names: bias towards a particular alignment was avoided because they could be either. Khazar and Lethys were &quot;suitably old and legendary&quot;. The name Nemesis was to be replaced with &quot;a huge, powerful name&quot;, but was liked by most of the team.

Programmer Oliver Purkiss was hired to program the villagers. He and Molyneux &quot;worked tirelessly&quot; to give the villagers autonomy and individuality without using too much processor power. Purkiss said that they did not want players to believe that villagers were worthless. Afterwards, it was decided that the villagers should have different belief levels, so the player would need to impress more sceptical ones. Richard Evans worked on the villagers&#x27; reactivity.

The script editor started out &quot;simple&quot;, enabling programmers to perform camera angles and move villagers, and the first script was created when Cottier added a widescreen function. Molyneux wanted &quot;an epic tale&quot;, so tools such as cinematography and the ability to analyse the creature and the player&#x27;s alignment and abilities were needed. Jason Hutchens, an &quot;expert in languages&quot;, was hired and helped create a &quot;more natural&quot; language compiler. A system to generalise each approach to challenges was also needed. The script editor and language were simple enough for non-programmers to use, and was also capable of writing complex scripts.

=== Sound and music ===

Shaw was head of music and sound. He handled the voice recording, all the sound effects, and composed the music. He also played instruments and sang: the first land&#x27;s Missionaries&#x27; song featured the voices of Shaw and Webley. It was originally Shaw&#x27;s intention for there to be no dialogue. The game had over 5000 sound effects by January 2000.

Shaw&#x27;s lack of experience in playing &quot;ethnic&quot; instruments was a problem, but Steafan Hannigan, an expert on the subject, was enlisted to help. Hannigan further enlisted a musical ensemble who covered the instruments for every tribe. Silc&#x27;s speech was performed at Electronic Arts&#x27;s sound studio in Chertsey over three-and-a-half days. The sessions were directed by Leach, and the lines were recorded onto hard disk by Electronic Arts engineer Bill Lusty. The recordings were then burnt to CD, which were sent to Shaw, who then &quot;cut up&quot; each line and assigned them to those in the game. Afterwards, Hugo Myatt and Shelley Blond were recorded at Lionhead.

=== Creature ===

The decision to base the creatures on real animals was made early on. To offer players variety, a mixture of benign and aggressive creatures was deemed necessary. The team decided to implement anthropomorphised bipedal animals, because their humanoid form evoked empathy, and credibility in their potential sentience. Due to technical restraints, bipedal creatures also provided greater flexibility for animation and game dynamics.

The lion was constructed for the prototype. 3D Studio Max was used to build the wire-mesh frame, and then Adobe Photoshop was used to skin the creature. The skeleton was added, which was used by an animator to perform movements. The good creatures&#x27; appearances were the most problematic, and the transformation between alignments was also thought to be &quot;a huge challenge&quot;. Each form was built from seven meshes and three texture sets. This enabled subtle variation. The eyes were originally painted as a texture, but this was deemed &quot;unsatisfactory&quot;. Later, the eyes were built using separate geometry that moves independently, and were added using the game&#x27;s creature editor.

To implement the transformation of the creature based on its alignment, Alex Evans developed an exporter program to export 3D Studio Max&#x27;s models and animations, and Roberts created one to import them and apply them to the lion. Each version of the creature was then loaded, and interpolation code was written, as well as a blended animation between two similar ones. The system has a two-way blend: one for the alignment, and the other for how fat the creature is. As there was not going to be many creatures on one map, the team were able to use CPU resources to run many animations simultaneously on a single creature.

The planned level of artificial intelligence for the creature was thought to be risky: Molyneux commented that they wanted to &quot;advance the technology to its extreme&quot;, and artificial intelligence specialist Richard Evans built the technology, which according to Molyneux appeared to &quot;live and learn like, say, a clever puppy&quot;. Molyneux desired the creature to pass the Turing test, which had not yet been achieved.

=== Other versions ===

An online version, &quot;Black &amp; White: The Gathering&quot;, was in development, and would have enabled creatures to interact those of other players in a cut-down game environment over the internet. Lionhead planned to release &quot;Black &amp; White: The Gathering&quot; two months before the main game&#x27;s release as a free download, and it was to offer a choice of creatures. It would have linked with chat programs such as AOL instant messenger and ICQ and convert text to a speech bubble from the creature. It was intended for players to be able to upload the main game&#x27;s creature into &quot;Black &amp; White: The Gathering&quot; and its experiences to be saved into the main game. Another online program, &quot;Black &amp; White Worlds&quot;, was in development. This would have taken place in the worlds of the main game. Molyneux explained that there was to be a server, whose worlds would have been set up with a match-making system and players would have been able to do battle, like last man standing. There was also a plan to produce &quot;Black &amp; White Universe&quot;, in which players would have had a persistent online world.

A PlayStation version was in development and scheduled for release in summer 2001, and a Dreamcast version in late 2001. Both were cancelled. The PlayStation version was in development by Blade Interactive Studios and was going to be published by Midas Interactive and Bethesda Softworks.PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions were due for release in 2002. Versions for the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance were proposed, but never materialised. A company called M4 was to have co-developed them alongside Lionhead, but Electronic Arts were not interested in the Game Boy versions. Molyneux stated that the Dreamcast version was cancelled because it was taking time to convert the game for the platform, and development had not progressed far enough for it to be worth continuing as interest in the platform was declining. Versions for Linux and BeOS were mooted, but were not greenlit by any prospective publisher. 

A spinoff of the series, &quot;Black &amp; White Creatures&quot; was announced for the Nintendo DS in May 2005. While the original was a large scale god game for PC platforms, the DS version was more of a smaller scale pet simulator adaption of the original concept. A very early 20% complete version of the game was playable at E3 2005, but the game was eventually cancelled. A similarly very early, barely playable build of the game leaked onto the internet in 2021. A PlayStation Portable version was also announced, but never released.

== Reception ==
Critics lauded &quot;Black &amp; White&quot; with &quot;universal acclaim&quot; according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. The graphics, gameplay, and artificial intelligence in particular were well received. &quot;Black &amp; White&quot; sold two and a half million copies on the PC by 2006. In the United States, NPD Techworld ranked &quot;Black &amp; White&quot; as the 11th-biggest computer game seller of 2001. Its sales in that region totaled 464,325 units, for revenues of $19.3 million, by the end of the year. It received a &quot;Platinum&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

&quot;Maxim&quot; Scott Steinberg complimented the design, saying it &quot;lets you indulge your most megalomaniacal fantasies with ease&quot;. IGN&#x27;s Tal Blevins complimented the &quot;wildly imaginative&quot; single-player mode, and the graphics, describing the game as &quot;a visual masterpiece&quot;. AllGame&#x27;s Michael House eulogised the &quot;[a]bsolutely stunning and gorgeous&quot; graphics. Marc Saltzman of &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; complimented the addictiveness and &quot;superb&quot; gameplay, but criticised the high system requirements. &quot;Playboy&quot; Michael Ryan complimented the &quot;intelligent&quot; sense of humour, &quot;intense&quot; visual appeal, and addictiveness, but criticised the frequent micromanagement and ambiguous objectives.

&quot;Game Informer&quot;″s Kristian Brogger was impressed with the game&#x27;s depth. GameZone&#x27;s reviewer praised the landscapes, described the music as &quot;fit for a god&quot;, and complimented the game for merging genres. Greg Kasavin of GameSpot concurred with this, stating: &quot;No other PC game to date has so effectively combined so many seemingly incompatible elements into one highly polished game&quot;. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; Charles Ardai commended the artificial intelligence and graphics, describing the landscape as &quot;stunning&quot;. Ben Silverman of Game Revolution approved the &quot;[u]nbelievable presentation&quot; and agreed with &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; on the artificial intelligence, calling it &quot;revolutionary&quot;. &quot;GamePro&quot; reviewer complimented the realism, stating that it is like interacting with a real world, and echoed others&#x27; views on the artificial intelligence by describing it as &quot;impressive&quot;. X-Play commended the graphics, but criticised the high system requirements.

Uniqueness and originality garnered critical praise. Craig Wessel of GameSpy felt the game is a unique and enjoyable strategy game. Originality was commended by &quot;PC Gamer&quot; reviewer, who also eulogised the &quot;[b]eautiful&quot; graphics, &quot;awesome&quot; interface, and its creativity, and Gamezilla&#x27;s Alex Karls, who also remarked the game &quot;lives up to its hype&quot;. &quot;Edge&quot; reviewer agreed about the originality, and described the game as &quot;a colossal achievement&quot;. Keith Pullin of &quot;PC Zone&quot; compared the resource management to &quot;Age of Empires&quot;, and complimented the humour and pop culture references and praised the combination of original ideas, remarking that &quot;&quot;B&amp;W&quot; is as captivating as it is ingenious&quot;. &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; complimented the originality and &quot;amazing&quot; creature AI, but complained about the bugs. Jim Preston of &quot;Next Generation&quot; described the game as &quot;thoughtful and engrossing&quot;. Reviewing the Macintosh version, Kit Pierce of Inside Mac Games remarked &quot;Black &amp; White is a gorgeous game&quot;, and commended its addictiveness.

Several publications re-reviewed the game later and, while still well received, have re-evaluated their initial judgement. &quot;Black &amp; White&quot; was selected by GameSpy as the most over-rated game of all time in an article published in September 2003, citing a lack of true interaction with the townspeople and poor use of the much-lauded creatures as reasons it disappointed. IGN mentioned the game in one of their podcasts discussing over-rated games.

<text>Georges Leygues (; 29 October 1856 – 2 September 1933) was a French politician of the Third Republic. During his time as Minister of Marine he worked with the navy&#x27;s chief of staff Henri Salaun in unsuccessful attempts to gain naval re-armament priority for government funding over army rearmament such as the Maginot Line.

==Leygues&#x27;s Ministry, 24 September 1920 – 16 January 1921==
*Georges Leygues – President of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs
*André Joseph Lefèvre – Minister of War
*Théodore Steeg – Minister of the Interior
*Frédéric François-Marsal – Minister of Finance
*Paul Jourdain – Minister of Labour
*Gustave L&#x27;Hopiteau – Minister of Justice
*Adolphe Landry – Minister of Marine
*André Honnorat – Minister of Public Instruction and Fine Arts
*André Maginot – Minister of War Pensions, Grants, and Allowances
*Joseph Ricard – Minister of Agriculture
*Albert Sarraut – Minister of Colonies
*Yves Le Trocquer – Minister of Public Works
*Auguste Isaac – Minister of Commerce and Industry
*Émile Ogier – Minister of Liberated Regions

Changes
*16 December 1920 – Flaminius Raiberti succeeds Lefèvre as Minister of War.

==Memory==
Besides the Îles Leygues, in the Kerguelens, two French warships have been named for Georges Leygues:
* a light cruiser &quot;Georges Leygues&quot; that served in World War II
* an F70-type frigate &quot;Georges Leygues&quot;, which was decommissioned in 2014

<text>The white-crowned lapwing, white-headed lapwing, white-headed plover or white-crowned plover (Vanellus albiceps) is a medium-sized wader. It is resident throughout tropical Africa, usually near large rivers.

==Description==

This lapwing is unmistakable. Its wings and tail are strikingly patterned in black and white, the back is brown and the underparts white. The head is particularly striking, being mainly grey, but with a white crown and foreneck. The eyering, facial wattles and legs are yellow. Females, males and young birds are similar in plumage.

==Behaviour==
It is a wader which breeds on exposed sand or shingle near rivers. 2–3 eggs are laid in a ground scrape. The nest and young are defended noisily and aggressively against all intruders, up to and including the hippopotamus.

Food is mainly insects and other small invertebrates. This species often feeds in small flocks when not breeding.

==Status==
The white-crowned lapwing is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

<text>Jean Raphaël Adrien René Viviani (; 8 November 18637 September 1925) was a French politician of the Third Republic, who served as Prime Minister for the first year of World War I. He was born in Sidi Bel Abbès, in French Algeria. In France he sought to protect the rights of socialists and trade union workers.

==Biography==

René Viviani was born in Algeria in a family of Italian immigrants. His parliamentary career began in 1893, when he was elected deputy of the fifth ward in Paris. He retained this office until 1902, when he failed to be reelected, but four years later he was elected deputy of the Department of Creuse. In the same year he entered the cabinet of Georges Clemenceau. At an early age he associated himself with the Socialist party, soon becoming one of its most brilliant orators and prominent leaders. When the party was reorganized in 1904 into the Unified Socialist party, Viviani, like fellow Socialist Aristide Briand, stayed outside, and thenceforth called himself an Independent Socialist. He served as Minister of Public Instruction in the ministry of Gaston Doumergue. Viviani was an antisemite, arguing that &quot;antisemitism is the best form of social struggle&quot;.

In the spring of 1914 an exceptionally radical chamber was elected, and for a while it seemed that they would be unable to agree upon any one for Premier, but finally, he was appointed prime minister on 13 June 1914, by President Poincaré. He received a vote of confidence of 370 to 137. The chief issues were the maintenance of the law requiring three years&#x27; service in the army and provision for a loan of 1,800,000,000 francs ($360,000,000) for military preparations. Viviani supported both of these measures. During the July Crisis, he was largely dominated by President Poincaré. He retained the premiership for the first year of the First World War, but his tenure was undistinguished.

On 26 August 1914 Viviani reorganized his cabinet on a war basis with Alexandre Millerand replacing Adolphe Messimy as Minister of War. Along with President Poincaré and War Minister Millerand he attended a June 1915 meeting of Joffre (Commander-in-Chief) and his Army Group Commanders (Foch, Castelnau and Dubail), a rare attempt at political oversight at this stage of the war.

By autumn 1915 Viviani&#x27;s government was in trouble following the resignation of Delcassé as Foreign Minister, the unsuccessful western front offensive and the entry of Bulgaria into the war. Although he survived a no confidence vote by 372–9, there were many abstentions. General Gallieni agreed to replace Millerand as Minister of War, but other French politicians refused to join Viviani&#x27;s government, so he resigned on 27 October 1915. Viviani served as Vice-President of the Council of Ministers (Deputy Prime Minister) and Gallieni as War Minister in Aristide Briand&#x27;s new ministry.

In April 1917 Viviani led a mission to the US, which had just entered the war &quot;associated with&quot; the Allies. He was overshadowed by Marshal Joffre, who attracted much more attention from the American press.

During Viviani&#x27;s time as prime minister, a law was adopted in July 1915 providing for special boards to fix such a wage for women employed in home-work in the clothing industry.
In May 1919 the Chamber of Deputies finally debated the bill proposed by Paul Dussaussoy in 1906 for limited women&#x27;s suffrage. Viviani gave an eloquent speech in its support, and the chamber voted in its favour by 344 to 97.

<doc id="402517" wikidata="Q637134" url="?curid=402517" title="Flag of British Columbia">
<text>The flag of British Columbia is based upon the shield of the provincial arms of British Columbia. At the top of the flag is a rendition of the Royal Union Flag, defaced in the centre by a crown, and with a setting sun, a view from parliament across the water at the province capital, representing the location of the province of British Columbia at the western end of Canada.

==History==
The flag of British Columbia is based upon the 1906 arms of the province, designed by Arthur John Beanlands, the canon of Christ Church Cathedral in Victoria. Originally, the arms featured the Union Flag on the bottom. This was changed as it conflicted with the expression &quot;The sun never sets on the British Empire.&quot; Based upon Beanlands&#x27; revised design, the flag of British Columbia was introduced on June 14, 1960, by Premier W. A. C. Bennett, and was first flown on board the BC Ferries motor vessel &quot;Sidney&quot; (later &quot;Queen of Sidney&quot;).

==Design==
The four wavy white and three wavy blue lines symbolize the province&#x27;s location between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains. The setting sun represents the fact that British Columbia is Canada&#x27;s westernmost province. The image of the continuously rising sun refers to the provincial motto —suggesting the idea that the sun never sets (on the British Empire). The Union Flag on top reflects the province&#x27;s British heritage, while the crown in the centre represents British Columbia becoming a Crown colony and achieving responsible government. The flag has an aspect ratio of 3:5.

A stylized version of the flag that appears on British Columbia licence plates incorrectly features the setting sun overlapping the Union Flag instead of the waves.

The flag of British Columbia is similar to the flag of the British Indian Ocean Territory. It also bears similarities to the arms of Suffolk County Council, the local authority of the county of Suffolk in the United Kingdom, as well as the flag of Kiribati, which features the blue waves for the Pacific Ocean and a sun for its own reasons.

<doc id="402518" wikidata="Q271887" url="?curid=402518" title="Louis Barthou">
<text>Jean Louis Barthou (; 25 August 1862 – 9 October 1934) was a French politician of the Third Republic who served as Prime Minister of France for eight months in 1913. In social policy, his time as prime minister saw the introduction (in July 1913) of allowances to families with children.

In 1917 and in 1934, Barthou also served as Minister of Foreign Affairs.

==Early life==
Louis Barthou was born on 25 August 1862 in Oloron-Sainte-Marie, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, France.

==Career==
Barthou served as a deputy from his home constituency and was an authority on trade-union history and law.

He served as prime minister from 22 March 1913 to 9 December 1913. In social policy, Barthou&#x27;s time as prime minister saw the passage of a law in June 1913 aimed at safeguarding women workers before and after childbirth.
He also held ministerial office on 13 other occasions. He served as Foreign Minister in 1917 and 1934. He was the primary figure behind the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance of 1935, but it was signed by his successor, Pierre Laval. As a national World War I hero and a recognized author, Barthou was elected to the Académie française at the end of that war.

In 1934 he tried to create an Eastern Pact, which would have included Germany (in some proposals) the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia and the Baltic states on the basis of guarantees – of the European borders of the Soviet Union by France, and of the eastern borders of Nazi Germany by the Soviet Union. He succeeded in obtaining the entry of the Soviet Union into the League of Nations in September 1934. In response to the withdrawal of Nazi Germany from the League in 1933, he began a program of rearmament, which focused initially on the Navy and the Air Force. 
Barthou was a lover of the arts, and in power he worked with leaders of the arts to publicize their fields. He felt that world-class leadership in the arts made Paris a mecca for tourists and collectors, and enhanced the nation&#x27;s stature worldwide as the exemplar of truth and beauty. In turn, the arts community honoured Barthou by dubbing him the &quot;minister of poets&quot;.

==Death==

As Foreign Minister, Barthou met King Alexander I of Yugoslavia during his state visit to Marseille in October 1934. On 9 October, King Alexander was assassinated by Vlado Chernozemski, a Bulgarian assassin wielding a handgun. Another bullet struck Barthou in the arm, passing through and fatally severing an artery. He died of blood loss less than an hour later. The assassination had been planned in Rome by Ante Pavelić, head of the Croatian Ustaše, in August 1934. Pavelić was assisted by Georg Percevic, a former Austro-Hungarian Armed Forces officer. France unsuccessfully requested the extradition of Percevic and Pavelić. This assassination ended the careers of the Bouches-du-Rhone prefect, , and of the director of the Surete Nationale, Jean Berthoin.

A ballistic report on the bullets found in the car was made in 1935, but its results were not made available to the public until 1974. The report revealed that Barthou had been hit by an 8 mm Modèle 1892 revolver round, commonly used in weapons carried by French police. Thus Barthou was killed during the frantic police response, rather than by the assassin.
==Legacy==
The deaths of Barthou and the King led to the Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of Terrorism concluded at Geneva by the League of Nations on 16 November 1937. The Convention was signed by 25 nations, ratified only by India. Barthou was granted a state funeral four days after his demise.

<text>The fifth USS &quot;Independence&quot; (CV/CVA-62) was an aircraft carrier of the United States Navy. She was the fourth and final member of the of conventionally powered supercarriers. She entered service in 1959, with much of her early years spent in the Mediterranean Fleet.

&quot;Independence&quot; was decommissioned in 1998 after 39 years of active service. Stored in recent years at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, the ex-&quot;Independence&quot; was towed beginning on 10 March 2017 to Brownsville, Texas for scrapping. She arrived on 1 June 2017 and dismantling was completed by early 2019.

==Design and construction==

The s were designed in the early 1950s as a smaller version of the cancelled &quot;United States&quot;-class &quot;supercarriers&quot;. Unlike the &quot;United States&quot; class, they were to operate in both the nuclear strike and conventional roles, and were therefore intended to carry a mixed fleet of fighters, light attack and heavy attack aircraft, all of which were to be jets. The carriers were designed around the large new Douglas A3D Skywarrior bomber, with four deck-edge aircraft elevators large enough to handle the new bomber. As jet aircraft needed much more fuel than piston-engined aircraft, the &quot;Forrestal&quot; class had a much greater aviation fuel capacity than existing carriers, with of Avgas and of jetfuel, more than double that carried in the s.

&quot;Independence&quot; was built with an angled flight deck with four C-7 steam catapults, two on the bow and two on the angled deck. She was fitted with AN/SPS-37 long-range search radar and AN/SPS-8B height finding radar. Defensive armament consisted of eight 5&quot;/54 caliber Mark 42 guns mounted on sponsons jutting out from the sides of the ship so they did not interfere with the flight deck. The initial air wing of the &quot;Forrestal&quot;-class carriers was about 90 aircraft, although this varied with the composition of the airwing.

The contract to build &quot;Independence&quot;, the fourth &quot;Forrestal&quot;-class carrier was awarded to the Brooklyn Navy Yard on 2 July 1954, with the ship being laid down on 1 July 1955. She was launched on 6 June 1958 by the wife of Thomas S. Gates, the Secretary of the Navy, and commissioned on 10 January 1959.

==Operational history==
===Testing and workup===
&quot;Independence&quot; conducted shakedown training under her first captain, Captain R. Y. McElroy, with the first landing-on being carried out by a Grumman Trader carrier onboard delivery aircraft on 2 March 1959. She arrived at her new homeport of Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia on 30 June 1959, and then carried out a ten-week training cruise in the Caribbean. During these trials, while carrying out compatibility tests aboard the new carrier, a Douglas A3D Skywarrior was catapulted off &quot;Independence&quot; at a gross weight of 84,000 pounds (38,000 kg), the heaviest aircraft to take off from a carrier at the time.

===1960–1964===
&quot;Independence&quot; operated off the Virginia Capes for the next year on training maneuvers, and departed 4 August 1960 for her first cruise to the Mediterranean. There, she added to the power of the 6th Fleet in the region, remaining in the eastern Mediterranean until her return to Norfolk 3 March 1961. On 4 August 1961, she departed again for the Mediterranean to join the US 6th fleet for another cruise and returned on 19 December 1961 to Norfolk.

&quot;Independence&quot; sailed on 19 April 1962 for Sixth Fleet duty in support of President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s firm stand on Berlin during a recurrence of stress in a critical area. She returned to Norfolk 27 August and sailed 11 October for the Caribbean Sea. Called on by President Kennedy on 24 October during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, &quot;Independence&quot; she acted as a key participant in the U.S. naval blockade of Cuba. She arrived off Puerto Rico in response to the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba and took part in the quarantine operations until the resolution of the crisis. She then returned to Norfolk on 25 November for readiness exercises along the eastern seaboard, overhaul in the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, and refresher training out of Guantanamo Bay.

&quot;Independence&quot; departed Norfolk on 6 August 1963 to take part in combined readiness exercises in the Bay of Biscay with sea-air units of the United Kingdom and France then entered the Mediterranean on 21 August for further duty with the Sixth Fleet. Cruising throughout the Mediterranean, she gained much valuable experience during combined NATO exercises, including close air support to Turkish paratroops, reconnaissance, communications, and convoy strike support. President Makarios of Cyprus paid her a visit on 7 October 1963, after which she took part in bilateral U.S.-Italian exercises in the Adriatic with Italian patrol torpedo boats, and U.S.-French exercises, which pitted her aircraft against French interceptors and a surface action with the French cruiser . She returned to Norfolk on 4 March 1964.

Following training exercises, ranging north to New York and south to Naval Station Mayport, Florida, &quot;Independence&quot; departed Norfolk 8 September 1964 for NATO Teamwork exercises in the Norwegian Sea and off the coast of France, then to Gibraltar. She returned to Norfolk 5 November 1964 and entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for overhaul.

===1965–1970===
On 10 May 1965, &quot;Independence&quot; deployed for more than seven months, including 100 days in the South China Sea, off the coast of Vietnam, the first Atlantic Fleet carrier to do so. She also was the fifth U.S. carrier to operate off Vietnam. &quot;Independence&quot; and her embarked Carrier Air Wing 7 received the Navy Unit Commendation for exceptionally meritorious service from 5 June to 21 November 1965. The carrier&#x27;s air group participated in the first major series of coordinated strikes against vital enemy supply lines north of the Hanoi-Haiphong complex, successfully evading the first massive surface-to-air missile barrage in aviation history while attacking assigned targets, and executing, the first successful attack on an enemy surface-to-air missile installation. The carrier launched more than 7,000 sorties, sustaining an exceptional pace of day and night strike operations against military and logistic supply facilities in North Vietnam. &quot;The superior team spirit, courage, professional competence, and devotion to duty displayed by the officers and men of &quot;Independence&quot; and embarked Attack Carrier Air Wing Seven reflect great credit upon themselves and the United States Naval Service.&quot;

&quot;Independence&quot; returned to her homeport, Norfolk, arriving 13 December 1965. During the first half of 1966, she operated off Norfolk, replenishing and training air groups. On 4 May 1966, she participated in Operation Strikex. The carrier departed Norfolk 13 June for European operations with the Sixth Fleet. &quot;Independence&quot; was involved with unit and NATO exercises from July into December. She then continued her Sixth Fleet deployment returning to CONUS in early 1967. After a few months of local operations, she underwent an extensive overhaul at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. 

On 30 April 1968, &quot;Independence&quot; steamed to the Mediterranean Sea for a nine-month deployment. She returned to Pier 12 NOB Norfolk, Virginia on 27 January 1969. On 3 September 1969, the Independence departed Norfolk to participate in NATO exercises in the North Atlantic, (NORLANT), where she participated in testing the Hawker Siddeley Harrier in flight deck operations, returning home on 9 October 1969. &quot;Independence&quot; was again deployed to the Mediterranean on 23 June 1970, returning to Pier 12 on 31 January 1971. It was during this cruise that the ship was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation in support of actions against the PLO during the Jordanian crisis.

===1970–1979===

On 25 September 1970, the news was received that Gamal Abdel Nasser, President of the United Arab Republic had died; an event that might plunge the Middle East into a crisis. &quot;Independence&quot;, along with , , and seven other U.S. Navy ships were put on standby in case U.S. military protection was needed for the evacuation of U.S. citizens and as a counterbalance to the Soviet Union&#x27;s Mediterranean fleet.

Pilots of VMA-142, -131 and -133 began qualification landings in A-4 Skyhawks aboard &quot;Independence&quot; on 3 August 1971. For the next three days, four active duty and 20 reserve pilots operated aboard the carrier —the first time that Marine Corps Reserve squadrons qualified in carrier duty.

Deploying from Norfolk in September 1971, the crew earned the designation as &#x27;Blue Nose&#x27; sailors when the &quot;Independence&quot; crossed the Arctic Circle on 28 September. During subsequent operations in the North Sea, &quot;Independence&quot; conducted cross-deck operations with the British aircraft carrier and transited the English Channel en route to the Strait of Gibraltar and scheduled operations in the Mediterranean Sea.

In May 1973, President Richard M. Nixon delivered his annual Armed Forces Day address from the decks of &quot;Independence&quot;. While based in Norfolk, the ship made deployments to the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean. From 8 to 13 October 1973, Task Group 60.1 with &quot;Independence&quot;, Task Force 60.2 with , and Task Forces 61/62 with were alerted for possible evacuation contingencies in the Middle East as a result of the 1973 Yom Kippur War between Arab states and Israel. &quot;Independence&quot; operated off the island of Crete.

In the summer of 1974, &quot;Independence&quot; departed Norfolk for yet another &#x27;Med Cruise&#x27;, operating with CTG 60.1 and CVW-7. Relieving &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot;, &quot;Independence&quot; and &quot;Saratoga&quot; continued the tradition of steaming the Mediterranean while being shadowed by Soviet aircraft and ships. On 8 September 1974, &quot;Independence&quot; and other ships steamed to the crash site of TWA Flight 841, which had been brought down by a terrorist bomb, and its crew spent two days retrieving the remains of the ill-fated jetliner and of the persons on board.

On 20 June 1979, Lieutenant Donna L. Spruill became the first female Navy pilot to carrier qualify in a fixed-wing aircraft. Lieutenant Spruill piloted a C-1A Trader to an arrested landing aboard &quot;Independence&quot;.

===1980–1989===

On 19 November 1980, &quot;Independence&quot; with Carrier Air Wing Six (AE) embarked, deployed to the Indian Ocean along with the cruiser and was on watch along with &quot;Ranger&quot; on &quot;Gonzo Station&quot; as President Reagan took office and the Iranian Hostages were freed. Subsequently, completing an Indian Ocean cruise, &quot;Independence&quot; transited the Suez Canal northbound, shortly after had transited southbound, making &quot;America&quot; the first United States Navy carrier (and, thus, &quot;Independence&quot; the second) to transit the Suez Canal since in 1967. &quot;Independence&quot; completed a deployment of 204 days. Scheduled to go to Singapore, the crew was instead diverted to the Persian Gulf to back up during the Iran Hostage Crisis mission with Capt. Thomas E. Shanahan Commanding. After the Gulf, &quot;Independence&quot; and her battle group visited Perth/Fremantle, Western Australia from 2 to 7 February for R&amp;R. Upon completion of the deployment, Captain Shanahan was promoted to rear admiral.

In 1982, &quot;Independence&quot; provided critical support to the multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon. On 25 June, the greatest concentration of U.S. Navy air power in the Mediterranean Sea resulted when the battle groups of &quot;Forrestal&quot; and &quot;Independence&quot; joined forces with and &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;. After steaming together in the eastern Mediterranean Sea for several days, &quot;Forrestal&quot; and &quot;Independence&quot; relieved &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; and &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;, the latter sailing home to Norfolk, after a long deployment.

In late October 1983, &quot;Independence&quot;″s battle group (Carrier Group Four), assigned to the United States Second Fleet, became the core of Task Group 20.5, the carrier task group that would support the Invasion of Grenada. On 25 October 1983, aircraft from &quot;Independence&#x27;s&quot; embarked air wing flew missions supporting the invasion. Returning to Lebanon that same year, the ship&#x27;s air wing conducted air strikes against Syrian positions.

In 1984, she won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for the Atlantic Fleet.

On 17 February 1985, &quot;Independence&quot; arrived at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard to undergo a modernization and overhaul program to extend her service life by 15 years. The flight deck was improved to allow the recovery of high-performance aircraft while the ship traveled at slower speeds, and the NATO Sea Sparrow launchers were upgraded. Other improvements improved the ship&#x27;s fuel consumption. &quot;Independence&quot; completed the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in June 1988. Setting sail 15 August 1988 from Norfolk, the ship transited the tip of South America and arrived at her new homeport of NAS North Island, in San Diego, California, 8 October.

The Paramount film &quot;Flight of the Intruder&quot; (1991), starring Danny Glover, Willem Dafoe, and Brad Johnson was filmed partly on &quot;Independence&quot;. The aircraft carrier went out for two weeks of filming in November 1989; the on-board fire party was kept busy dealing with the numerous small electrical fires that the movie crew had started with their lighting equipment.

===1990–1995===

In June 1990, with Carrier Air Wing 14 embarked, &quot;Independence&quot; departs San Diego on a routine WESTPAC. On 2 August, in response to Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait, &quot;Independence&quot;, leading Task Group 800.1, which included &quot;Jouett&quot; (CG-29), was sent to deter further Iraqi aggression during Operation Desert Shield. Arriving on station in the Gulf of Oman on 5 August, &quot;Independence&quot; was the first carrier to enter the Persian Gulf since 1974. The ship remained on station for 112 days and permanently reestablished a U.S. naval presence in the region. She returned to San Diego on 20 December 1990.

&quot;Independence&quot; changed homeports again on 11 September 1991—this time to Yokosuka, Japan, embarking Carrier Air Wing 5 and becoming the Navy&#x27;s only permanently forward-deployed aircraft carrier, and flagship for Commander, Carrier Group Five.

On 23 August 1992, &quot;Independence&quot; entered the Persian Gulf, under the Command of Captain Carter B. Refo prepared to enforce an Allied ban on Iraqi flights over south Iraq below the 32nd parallel north. On 26 August, President George H. W. Bush announced that the United States and its allies had informed Iraq that in 24 hours allied aircraft would fly surveillance missions in southern Iraq and were prepared to shoot down any Iraqi aircraft flying south of the 32nd parallel. The action was precipitated by Iraq&#x27;s failure to comply with U.N. Resolution 688, which demanded that the Iraqi government stop the repression of its Shiite population in southern Iraq.

Persian Gulf allies began to enforce the ban on Iraqi planes from flying south of the 32nd parallel on 27 August in Operation Southern Watch. Any Iraqi planes that violated the ban would be shot down. Twenty Navy aircraft from CVW-5 aboard &quot;Independence&quot; in the Persian Gulf were the first coalition aircraft on station over Iraq as Operation Southern Watch began. Southern Watch was the enforcement of a ban on Iraqi warplanes and helicopters from flying south of the 32nd parallel.

&quot;Independence&quot; became the most battle experienced ship in the Navy&#x27;s active fleet, and the first carrier in history to hold that distinction, on 30 June 1995. With this honor, &quot;Independence&quot; displayed the Revolution-era First Navy Jack, commonly called the &quot;Don&#x27;t Tread on Me&quot; flag, from her bow until her decommissioning. The flag was presented to &quot;Independence&quot;″s commanding officer Capt. David P. Polatty III in a formal ceremony on 1 July. The flag was received from upon her decommissioning.

In November 1995, &quot;Independence&quot; and Carrier Air Wing Five returned to Japan after successfully completing their third deployment to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Southern Watch.

===1996–1998===


In March 1996, &quot;Independence&quot; was deployed to the waters east of Taiwan to provide a stabilizing presence amid the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis. She was joined in the area by &quot;Nimitz&quot; as the People&#x27;s Republic of China lobbed missiles into Taiwanese territorial waters. On returning to Yokosuka in April 1996, the ship was visited by President Bill Clinton as part of an official state visit to Japan.

In 1997, &quot;Independence&quot; made a four-month deployment, covering several major exercises and seven ports of call. Included in these ports of call were two historic port visits. The first was 28 February 1997 to the island territory of Guam. &quot;Independence&quot; was the first aircraft carrier to pull into Guam in 36 years.

The second, two months later, was to Port Klang, Malaysia. &quot;Independence&quot; became the first aircraft carrier in the world to make a port visit to Malaysia.

Before sailing back to Yokosuka, Japan, &quot;Independence&quot; made her last port call of the deployment in May 1997 to Hong Kong. The ship&#x27;s port call was the last U.S. naval visit to the territory before its handover to China on 1 July 1997.

&quot;Independence&quot; deployed to the Persian Gulf in January 1998 to support negotiations between the UN and Iraq and to again participate in Operation Southern Watch, prior to being relieved at Yokosuka by .

==In popular culture==
Independence was used for filming the 1991 movie Flight Of The Intruder with shots of the CV 62 number on the island and credit at the end of the film.

==Decommissioning and fate==

&quot;Independence&quot; was decommissioned in ceremonies at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, on 30 September 1998. At the conclusion of this ceremony, in keeping with naval tradition, &quot;Independence&quot;″s last commanding officer, Captain (later Rear Admiral) Mark R. Milliken, USN, was the last person to depart the ship.

&quot;Independence&quot;″s commissioning pennant was hauled down 39 years, 9 months and 20 days after it was first hoisted, and the &quot;Don&#x27;t Tread on Me&quot; First Navy Jack was transferred to the Navy&#x27;s next oldest active ship, the aircraft carrier &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;.

After decommissioning, &quot;Independence&quot; remained in mothballs for five and a half years before being struck on 8 March 2004. During her time in mothballs, the ship was said to have been heavily stripped to support the active carrier fleet, especially the remaining s. Her port anchor and both anchor chains were used on the new . The recycling of parts and the poor material condition of the ship at the time she was withdrawn made a strong argument against retaining her as a potential museum ship. In April 2004, Navy officials identified ex-&quot;Independence&quot; as one of 24 decommissioned ships available to be sunk as artificial reefs. However, as of February 2008, she was scheduled to be dismantled in the next five years along with . At that time, she was still available for donation as a reef while awaiting a contract for her dismantling to be awarded.

On 26 January 2012, the Navy&#x27;s Naval Sea Systems Command posted a notice of solicitation for the towing and complete dismantlement of multiple CV-59/CV-63 Class Aircraft Carriers in the United States, including &quot;Forrestal&quot;, &quot;Independence&quot;, and &quot;Constellation&quot;. The impacts of an initial scraping for marine life in the Puget Sound required remediation with a layer of sand over the scraping area.

Following the disposal of and &quot;Constellation&quot;, on 10 March 2017 ex-&quot;Independence&quot; began her 16,000-mile journey from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to Brownsville, Texas for dismantling by International Shipbreaking Limited. On 26 April 2017, she was on her way through the Strait of Magellan, and on 30 May 2017 she arrived at Brownsville, where a special ceremony was held at Isla Blanca Park for veterans, school children and members of the local community to honour the vessel. Scrapping was completed by early 2019.

Two of the ship&#x27;s propellers are on display at South Padre Island.

<text>Joseph-Marie-Auguste Caillaux (; 30 March 1863 – 22 November 1944) was a French politician of the Third Republic. He was a leader of the French Radical Party and Minister of Finance, but his progressive views in opposition to the military alienated him from conservative elements. He was accused of corruption, but was cleared by a parliamentary commission. This political weakness strengthened the right wing elements in the Radical Party.

==Biography==
He was the son of Eugène Caillaux. After studying law and following lectures at the École des Sciences Politiques, he entered the civil service in 1888 as an inspector of finance, and spent most of his official career in Algiers. Standing as a Republican candidate in the elections of 1898 for the department of the Sarthe, in opposition to the Duc de la Rochefoucault-Bisaccia, he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies by 12,929 votes to 11,737. He became Minister of Finance in the Waldeck-Rousseau Cabinet, and after its fall it was not until the Clemenceau Ministry of 1906 that he returned to office, once more with the portfolio of Finance.
During the revolt of the Languedoc winegrowers on 22 May 1907 Caillaux tabled a bill on wine fraud. 
The text submitted to Parliament provided for an annual declaration of their harvest by wine growers, prohibition of second-cycle sweetening, and control and taxation of purchases of sugar.

In 1911 he became prime minister. The leader of the Radicals, he favored a policy of conciliation with Germany during his premiership from 1911 to 1912, which led to the maintenance of the peace during the Second Moroccan Crisis of 1911. He and his ministers were forced to resign on 11 January 1912, after it was revealed that he had secretly negotiated with Germany without the knowledge of President Armand Fallières.

Nevertheless, thanks to his undoubted qualities as a financier, he remained a great power in French politics. He fought the Three Years&#x27; Service bill with the utmost tenacity. Although that measure became law, it was he who finally, on the financial aspect of that bill, brought about the downfall of the Barthou Ministry in the autumn of 1913.

While the Entente Cordiale was in effect, it was impossible for Caillaux to return to the position of prime minister, but he joined the succeeding Doumergue Cabinet as Minister of Finance. As a financial expert, he had long identified himself with a great and necessary reform in the fiscal policy of France—the introduction of the principle of an income tax. Throughout the winter of 1913, he campaigned for this principle. His advocacy of an income tax, and his uncertain and erratic championship of proletarian ideas, alarmed all the conservative elements in the country, and throughout the winter he was attacked with increasing vehemence from the platform and through the press. Those attacks reached their highest point of bitterness in a series of disclosures in the newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; of a more or less personal nature.
In 1914, &quot;Le Figaro&quot; started the publication of love letters that had been sent by Caillaux to his second wife Henriette while he was still married to the first, Berthe Gueydan. In March 1914, Madame Caillaux in turn shot to death Gaston Calmette, the editor of &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, and Caillaux resigned as Minister of Finance. In July 1914, Madame Caillaux was acquitted on the grounds that she committed a &quot;crime passionel&quot;.

Caillaux became the leader of a peace party in the Assembly during World War I. After a mission to South America, he returned in 1915, and at once began to lobby. He financed newspapers, and did everything he possibly could behind the scenes to consolidate his position. He became acquainted with the Bolos and the Malvys of political and journalistic life. By the spring of 1917, he had become in the eyes of the public &quot;l&#x27;homme de la défaite&quot;, the man who was willing to effect a compromise peace with Germany at the expense of Great Britain. However, the advent of Clemenceau to power killed all his hopes. This led to his arrest for treason in 1917. After a long delay, he was convicted of high treason by the High Court of the Senate, and sentenced to three years&#x27; imprisonment, the term he had already served. He was also forbidden to reside in French territory for five years and deprived of civil rights for ten years.

Again rehabilitated after World War I, Caillaux served at various times in the left wing governments of the 1920s.

On 10 July 1940, Caillaux voted as a Senator in favour of granting the cabinet presided by Marshal Philippe Pétain authority to draw up a new constitution, thereby effectively ending the French Third Republic and establishing Vichy France.

Joseph Caillaux is interred in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

His political collaborators included the Nord region journalist and politician Émile Roche.

<text>Jeconiah ( &quot;Yəḵonəyā&quot; , meaning &quot;Yah has established&quot;; ; ), also known as Coniah and as Jehoiachin ( &quot;Yəhōyāḵīn&quot; ; ), was the nineteenth and penultimate king of Judah who was dethroned by the King of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar II in the 6th century BCE and was taken into captivity. He was the son and successor of King Jehoiakim, and the grandson of King Josiah. Most of what is known about Jeconiah is found in the Hebrew Bible. Records of Jeconiah&#x27;s existence have been found in Iraq, such as the Jehoiachin&#x27;s Rations Tablets. These tablets were excavated near the Ishtar Gate in Babylon and have been dated to c. 592 BCE. Written in cuneiform, they mention Jeconiah (, &quot;Yaʾúkinu&quot; [&quot;ia-ʾ-ú-ki-nu&quot;]) and his five sons as recipients of food rations in Babylon.

==Jeconiah in scripture==

===Reign===

Jeconiah reigned three months and ten days, beginning December 9, 598 BCE. He succeeded Jehoiakim as king of Judah after raiders from surrounding lands invaded Jerusalem and killed his father. It is likely that the king of Babylon was behind this effort, as a response to Jehoiakim&#x27;s revolt, starting sometime after 601 BCE. Three months and ten days after Jeconiah became king, the armies of Nebuchadnezzar II seized Jerusalem, with the intention to take high class Judahite captives and assimilate them into Babylonian society. On March 15/16th, 597 BCE, Jeconiah, his entire household and three thousand Jews were exiled to Babylon.

The Masoretic Text of 2 Chronicles 36 states that Jeconiah&#x27;s rule began at the age of eight, while in 2 Kings 24:8 Jeconiah is said to have come to the throne at eighteen. Modern scholars have treated the difference between &quot;eight&quot; and &quot;eighteen&quot; as reflecting a copying error on one side or the other of the issue.

===During exile===
After Jeconiah was deposed as king, his uncle Zedekiah (2 Kings 24:17) was appointed by Nebuchadnezzar to rule Judah. Zedekiah was the son of Josiah. Jeconiah would later be regarded as the first of the exilarchs. In the Book of Ezekiel, the author refers to Jeconiah as king and dates certain events by the number of years he was in exile. The author identifies himself as Ezekiel, a contemporary of Jeconiah, and he never mentions Zedekiah by name.

===Release from captivity===
According to 2 Kings 25:27–30, Jeconiah was released from prison &quot;in the 37th year of the exile&quot;, in the year that Amel-Marduk (Evil-Merodach) came to the throne, and given a prestigious position at court. Jeconiah&#x27;s release in Babylon brings to a close the Books of Kings and the Deuteronomistic history. Babylonian records show that Amel-Marduk began his reign in October 562 BCE. According to Jeremiah 52:31, Jeconiah was released from prison &quot;in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month&quot;: this indicates the first year of captivity to be 598/597 BCE, according to Judah&#x27;s Tishri-based calendar. The 37th year of captivity was thus, by Judean reckoning, the year that began in Tishri of 562, consistent with the synchronism to the accession year of Amel-Marduk given in Babylonian records.

====Curse====
Jeremiah (22:28–30) cursed Jeconiah that none of his descendants would ever sit on the throne of Israel:
Chapter 1, verses 11–12 of the Gospel of Matthew lists Jeconiah in the lineage of Jesus Christ, through Joseph. If Joseph was the biological father of Jesus (contrary to Christian belief), then Jesus could not rightfully claim to be the Messiah as the curse of Jeconiah, if true, would apply to Him.

Richard Challoner interpreted the two genealogies of Matthew and Luke to be referring to a biological offspring and an offspring from a Levirate marriage. According to this concept, Joseph may have been a biological descendant from Jeconiah, but within Jewish law he would have been counted as a descendant of someone else due to the carrying of a brother&#x27;s name through the Levirate marriage.

===In Rabbinical literature===
Jehoiachin was made king in place of his father by Nebuchadnezzar; but the latter had hardly returned to Babylon when some one said to him, &quot;A dog brings forth no good progeny,&quot; whereupon he recognized that it was poor policy to have Jehoiachin for king (Lev. R. xix. 6; Seder &#x27;Olam R. xxv.). In Daphne, near Antiochia, Nebuchadnezzar received the Great Sanhedrin, to whom he announced that he would not destroy the Temple if the king were delivered up to him. When the king heard this resolution of Nebuchadnezzar he went upon the roof of the Temple, and, turning to heaven, held up the Temple keys, saying: &quot;As you no longer consider us worthy to be your ministers, take the keys that you have entrusted to us until now.&quot; Then a miracle happened; for a fiery hand appeared and took the keys, or, as others say, the keys remained suspended in the air where the king had thrown them (Lev. R. l.c.; Yer. Sheḳ. vi. 50a; other versions of the legend of the keys are given in Ta&#x27;an. 29a; Pesiḳ. R. 26 [ed. Friedmann, p. 131a], and Syriac Apoc. Baruch, x. 18). The king as well as all the scholars and nobles of Judah were then carried away captive by Nebuchadnezzar (Seder &#x27;Olam R. l.c.; compare Ratner&#x27;s remark ad loc.). According to Josephus, Jehoiachin gave up the city and his relatives to Nebuchadnezzar, who took an oath that neither they nor the city should be harmed. But the Babylonian king broke his word; for scarcely a year had elapsed when he led the king and many others into captivity.

Jehoiachin&#x27;s sad experiences changed his nature entirely, and as he repented of the sins which he had committed as king he was pardoned by God, who revoked the decree to the effect that none of his descendants should ever become king (Jer. xxii. 30; Pesiḳ., ed. Buber, xxv. 163a, b); he even became the ancestor of the Messiah (Tan., Toledot, 20 [ed. Buber, i. 140]). It was especially his firmness in fulfilling the Law that restored him to God&#x27;s favor. He was kept by Nebuchadnezzar in solitary confinement, and as he was therefore separated from his wife, the Sanhedrin, which had been expelled with him to Babylon, feared that at the death of this queen the house of David would become extinct.

They managed to gain the favor of Queen Semiramis, who induced Nebuchadnezzar to ameliorate the lot of the captive king by permitting his wife to share his prison. As he then manifested great self-control and obedience to the Law, God forgave him his sins (Lev. R. xix., end). Jehoiachin lived to see the death of his conqueror, Nebuchadnezzar, which brought him liberty; for within two days of his father&#x27;s death Evil-merodach opened the prison in which Jehoiachin had languished for so many years.

Jehoiachin&#x27;s life is the best illustration of the maxim, &quot;During prosperity a man must never forget the possibility of misfortune; and in adversity must not despair of prosperity&#x27;s return&quot; (Seder &#x27;Olam R. xxv.). On the advice of Jehoiachin, Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s son cut his father&#x27;s body into 300 pieces, which he gave to 300 vultures, so that he could be sure that Nebuchadnezzar would never return to worry him (&quot;Chronicles of Jerahmeel,&quot; lxvi. 6). Evil-merodach treated Jehoiachin as a king, clothed him in purple and ermine, and for his sake liberated all the Jews that had been imprisoned by Nebuchadnezzar (Targ. Sheni, near the beginning). It was Jehoiachin, also, who erected the magnificent mausoleum on the grave of the prophet Ezekiel (Benjamin of Tudela, &quot;Itinerary,&quot; ed. Asher, i. 66). In the Second Temple there was a gate called &quot;Jeconiah&#x27;s Gate,&quot; because, according to tradition, Jeconiah (Jehoiachin) left the Temple through that gate when he went into exile (Mid. ii. 6).

===Genealogy===
Jeconiah was the son of Jehoiakim and Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem. He had eight children: Assir, Shealtiel, Malkiram, Pedaiah, Shenazzar, Jekamiah, Hoshama and Nedabiah. (). Jeconiah is also mentioned in the first book of Chronicles as the father of Pedaiah, who in turn was the father of Zerubbabel. A list of his descendants is given in .

In listing the genealogy of Jesus Christ, Matthew 1:11 records Jeconiah the son of Josiah as an ancestor of Joseph, the husband of Mary. This Jeconiah is uncle of Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim (1 Chron 3:16), which the Jeconiah/Jehoiakim lineage was cursed (Jer 22:24,30). The Jeconiah/Josiah (Matt 1:11) lineage to Jesus is not cursed. 

==Dating Jeconiah&#x27;s reign==
The Babylonian Chronicles establish that Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem for the first time on 2 Adar (16 March) 597 BCE. Before Wiseman&#x27;s publication of the Babylonian Chronicles in 1956, Thiele had determined from biblical texts that Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s initial capture of Jerusalem and its king Jeconiah occurred in the spring of 597 BCE, whereas Kenneth Strand points out that other scholars, including Albright, more frequently dated the event to 598 BCE.

===Thiele&#x27;s dates===
Thiele said that the 25th anniversary of Jeconiah&#x27;s captivity was April 25 (10 Nisan), 573 BCE, implying that he began the exile to Babylon on 10 Nisan 597, 24 years earlier. His reasoning in arriving at this exact date was based on Ezekiel 40:1, where Ezekiel, without naming the month, says it was the tenth day of the month, &quot;on that very day.&quot; Since this fits with his idea that Jeconiah&#x27;s (and Ezekiel&#x27;s) exile to Babylon began a month later than the capturing of the city, thus allowing a new Nisan-based year to begin, Thiele took these words in Ezekiel as referring to the day in which the captivity or exile proper began. He therefore ended Jehoiachin&#x27;s reign of three months and ten days on this date. The dates he gives for Jeconiah&#x27;s reign are then: 21 Heshvan (9 December) 598 BCE to 10 Nisan (22 April) 597 BCE.

Thiele&#x27;s reasoning in this regard has been criticized by Rodger C. Young, who advocates the 587 date for the fall of Jerusalem. Young argues that Thiele&#x27;s arithmetic is inconsistent, and adds an alternative explanation of the phrase &quot;on that very day&quot; (&quot;be-etsem ha-yom ha-zeh&quot;) in Ezekiel 40:1. This phrase is used three times in Leviticus 23:28–30 to refer the Day of Atonement, always observed on the tenth of Tishri, and Ezekiel&#x27;s writings in several places show familiarity with the Book of Leviticus. A further argument in favor of this interpretation is that in the same verse, Ezekiel says it was Rosh Hashanah (New Year&#x27;s Day) and also the tenth of the month, indicating the start of a Jubilee year, since only in a Jubilee year did the year begin on the tenth of Tishri, the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 25:9). The Talmud (tractate &quot;Arakin&quot; 12a,b) and the Seder Olam (chapter 11) also say that Ezekiel saw his vision at the beginning of a Jubilee year, the 17th, consistent with this interpretation of Ezekiel 40:1.

Because this offers an alternative explanation to Thiele&#x27;s interpretation of Ezekiel 40:1, and because Thiele&#x27;s chronology for Jeconiah is incompatible with the records of the Babylonian Chronicle, the infobox below dates the end of Jeconiah&#x27;s reign to 2 Adar (16 March) 597 BCE, the date of the first capture of Jerusalem as given in the Babylonian records. Thiele&#x27;s dates for Jeconiah, however, and his date of 586 BCE for the fall of Jerusalem, continue to hold considerable weight with the scholarly community.

However, no such complication is necessary since the tenth of Tishri 574 BCE is precisely as stated in Ezekiel 40:1, both in the fourteenth year of the Temple&#x27;s destruction in 587 BCE and the twenty-fifth year of Jeconiah&#x27;s exile in 597 BCE.

Gershon Galil also attempted to reconcile a 586 date for the fall of Jerusalem with the data for Jeconiah&#x27;s exile. Like Thiele, he assumed that the years of exile should be measured from Nisan, but for a different reason. Galil hypothesized that Israel’s calendar was one month ahead of that of Babylon because Babylon had inserted an intercalary month and Israel had not yet done so. This would make Adar (the twelfth month) in the Babylonian records correspond to Nisan (the first month) in Judean counting. But this hypothesis, like Thiele&#x27;s, runs into difficulty with Ezekiel 40:1, since the 25th year of captivity would begin in Nisan of 573 and the fall of Jerusalem, 14 years earlier, would be in 587, not the 586 that Galil and Thiele advocate. There is further conflict with the Babylonian data, because the 37th year of captivity, the year in which Jeconiah was released from prison, would be the year starting in Nisan of 561 BCE, not Nisan of 562 BCE as given in the Babylonian Chronicle. Recognizing these conflicts, Galil admits (p. 377) that his date for the fall of Jerusalem (586 BCE) is inconsistent with the precise data given in the Bible and the Babylonian Chronicle.

==Dating the fall of Jerusalem using Jeconiah&#x27;s dating==

The reign of Jeconiah is considered important in establishing the chronology of events in the early sixth century BCE in the Middle East. This includes resolving the date of the fall of Jerusalem to Nebuchadnezzar. According to Jeremiah 52:6, the city wall was breached in the summer month of Tammuz in the eleventh year of Zedekiah.

Historians, however, have been divided on whether the year was 587 or 586 BCE. A 1990 study listed eleven scholars who preferred 587 and eleven who preferred 586. The Babylonian records of the second capture of Jerusalem have not been found, and scholars looking at the chronology of the period must rely on the Biblical texts, as correlated with extant Babylonian records from before and after the event. In this regard, the Biblical texts regarding Jeconiah are especially important, because the time of his reign in Jerusalem was fixed by Donald Wiseman&#x27;s 1956 publication, and this is consistent with his thirty-seventh year of captivity overlapping the accession year of Amel-Marduk, as mentioned above.

Ezekiel&#x27;s treatment of Jeconiah&#x27;s dates are a starting point for determining the date of the fall of Jerusalem. He dated his writings according to the years of captivity he shared with Jeconiah, and he mentions several events related to the fall of Jerusalem in those writings. In Ezekiel 40:1, Ezekiel dates his vision to the 25th year of the exile and fourteen years after the city fell. If Ezekiel and the author of were both using Tishri-based years, the 25th year would be 574/573 BCE and the fall of the city, 14 years earlier, would be in 588/587—i.e., in the summer of 587 BCE. This is consistent with other texts in Ezekiel related to the fall of the city. Ezekiel 33:21 relates that a refugee arrived in Babylon and reported the fall of Jerusalem in the twelfth year, tenth month of &quot;our exile.&quot; Measuring from the first year of exile, 598/597, this was January of 586 BCE, incompatible with Jerusalem falling in the summer of 586 BCE, but consistent with its fall in the summer of 587 BCE. The other side holds that since Jeconiah surrendered in March 597, January 586 is less than eleven years later and therefore can not be considered in the twelfth year of the exile.

Thiele held to a 586 BCE date for the capture of Jerusalem and the end of Zedekiah&#x27;s reign. Recognizing to some extent the importance of Ezekiel&#x27;s measuring time by the years of captivity of Jeconiah, and in particular the reference to the 25th year of that captivity in Ezekiel 40:1, he wrote, 
Although the Babylonian tablets dealing with the final fall and destruction of Jerusalem have not been found, it should be noticed that the testimony of Ezekiel 40:1 is definitive in regard to the year 586. Since Ezekiel had his vision of the temple on the twenty-fifth anniversary of his and Jehoiachin&#x27;s captivity (28 April 573), and since this was the fourteenth year after Jerusalem&#x27;s fall, the city must have fallen eleven years after the captivity. Eleven years after 597 is 586.

In order to justify his 586 date, Thiele had assumed that the years of captivity for Jeconiah must be calendar years starting in Nisan, in contrast to the Tishri-based years that he used everywhere else for the kings of Judah. He also assumed that Jeconiah&#x27;s captivity or exile was not to be measured from Adar of 597 BCE, the month Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem and its king according to the Babylonian Chronicle, but in the next month, Nisan, when Thiele assumed Jeconiah began the trip to Babylon. Granting these assumptions, the first year of captivity would be the year starting in Nisan of 597 BCE. The twenty-fifth year of captivity would start in Nisan of 573 BCE, (573/572) twenty-four years later. Years of captivity must be measured in this non-accession sense (the year in which the captivity started was considered year one of the captivity), otherwise the 37th year of captivity, the year in which Jeconiah was released from prison, would start on Nisan 1 of 560 BCE (597 − 37), two years &quot;after&quot; the accession year of Amel-Marduk, according to the dating of his accession year that can be fixed with exactitude by the Babylonian Chronicle. Thiele then noted that Ezekiel 40:1 says that this 25th year of captivity was 14 years after the city fell. Fourteen years before 573/572 is 587/586, and since Thiele is assuming Nisan years for the captivity, this period ended the day before Nisan 1 of 586. But this is three months and nine days before Thiele&#x27;s date for the fall of the city on 9 Tammuz 586 BCE. Even Thiele&#x27;s assumption that the years of captivity were measured from Nisan does not reconcile Ezekiel&#x27;s chronology for the captivity of Jeconiah with a 586 date, and the calculation given above that uses the customary Tishri-based years yields the summer of 587, consistent with all other texts in Ezekiel related to Jeconiah&#x27;s captivity.

Another text in Ezekiel offers a clue to why there has been such a conflict over the date of Jerusalem&#x27;s fall in the first place. Ezekiel 24:1–2 (NIV) records the following:
In the ninth year, in the tenth month on the tenth day, the word of the Lord came to me: &quot;Son of man, record this date, this very date, because the king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day.&quot;

Assuming that dating here is according to the years of exile of Jeconiah, as elsewhere in Ezekiel, the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem began on January 27, 589 BCE. This can be compared to a similar passage in (NIV):
So in the ninth year of Zedekiah&#x27;s reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army. He encamped outside the city and built siege works all around it.

The ninth year, tenth month, tenth day in Ezekiel is identical to the period in 2 Kings. In Ezekiel, the years are everywhere else measured according to Jeconiah&#x27;s captivity, which must be taken in a non-accession sense, so that the beginning of the siege was eight actual years after the beginning of the captivity. The comparison with 2 Kings 25:1 would indicate that Zedekiah&#x27;s years in 2 Kings were also by non-accession reckoning. His eleventh year, the year in which Jerusalem fell, would then be 588/587 BCE, in agreement with all texts in Ezekiel and elsewhere that are congruent with that date.

Some who maintain the 586 date therefore maintain that in this one instance, Ezekiel, without explicitly saying so, switched to the regnal years of Zedekiah, although Ezekiel apparently regarded Jeconiah as the rightful ruler and never names Zedekiah in his writing. Another view is that a later copyist, aware of the 2 Kings passage, modified it and inserted it into the text of Ezekiel. In his study of all biblical texts related to the Babylonian capture of Jerusalem, Young concludes that these conjectures are not necessary, and that all texts related to the fall of Jerusalem in Jeremiah, Ezekiel, 2 Kings, and 2 Chronicles are internally consistent and consistent with the fall of the city in Tammuz of 587 BCE.

==Archeological findings==
During his excavation of Babylon in 1899–1917, Robert Koldewey discovered a royal archive room of King Nebuchadnezzar near the Ishtar Gate. It contained tablets dating to 595–570 BCE. The tablets were translated in the 1930s by the German Assyriologist, Ernst Weidner. Four of these tablets list rations of oil and barley given to various individuals—including the deposed King Jehoiachin—by Nebuchadnezzar from the royal storehouses, dated five years after Jehoiachin was taken captive.

One tablet reads:
10 (sila of oil) to the king of Judah, Yaukin; 2 1/2 sila (oil) to the offspring of Judah&#x27;s king; 4 sila to eight men from Judea.
Another reads:
1 1/2 sila (oil) for three carpenters from Arvad, 1/2 apiece; 11 1/2 sila for eight wood workers from Byblos ...; 3 1/2 sila for seven Greek craftsman, 1/2 sila apiece; 1/2 sila to the carpenter, Nabuetir; 10 sila to Ia-ku-u-ki-nu, the son of Judah&#x27;s king[1]; 2 1/2 sila for the five sons of the Judean king.

The Babylonian Chronicles are currently housed in the Pergamum Museum in Berlin.

<doc id="402553" wikidata="Q244206" url="?curid=402553" title="Saud of Saudi Arabia">
<text>Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (; 15 January 1902 – 23 February 1969) was King of Saudi Arabia from 9 November 1953 until his abdication on 2 November 1964. During his reign, he served as Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia from 1953 to 1954 and from 1960 to 1962. Prior to his accession, Saud was the country&#x27;s crown prince from 11 May 1933 to 9 November 1953. He was the second son of King Abdulaziz, the founder of Saudi Arabia.

Saud was the second son of King Abdulaziz and Wadha bint Muhammad Al Orair. The death of Saud&#x27;s elder brother, Prince Turki, in 1919 poised Saud to become his father&#x27;s successor; King Abdulaziz appointed him as the crown prince of Saudi Arabia in 1933. Saud served as a commander in Abdulaziz&#x27;s conquests that led to the establishment of Saudi Arabia in 1932. He was the viceroy of Nejd from 1926 to 1932, and he also represented his father in neighboring countries. He played a role in the financial reforms of Saudi Arabia, preparing the first state budget in 1948 and establishing the Saudi Central Bank in 1952. Saud also oversaw the country&#x27;s infrastructural development.

Upon his father&#x27;s death in 1953, Saud ascended the throne and reorganized the government. He founded the convention that the king of Saudi Arabia presides over the Council of Ministers. Saud sought to maintain friendly relations with the United States, whilst also supporting other Arab countries in their conflicts against Israel. Under his reign, Saudi Arabia joined the Non-Aligned Movement in 1961. However, Saud&#x27;s inability to counter the Saudi national debt brought him into a power struggle with his half-brother and crown prince, Faisal, culminating in the forced abdication of Saud and the proclamation of Faisal as king. Saud went into exile and made an unsuccessful attempt, supported by some of his sons, to take back the throne. He died in Athens, Greece, in 1969.

==Early life and education==

Prince Saud was born on 15 January 1902 in Kuwait City. The second son of Abdulaziz bin Abdul Rahman, he was born in the home of his grandfather Abdul Rahman bin Faisal. They lived in Sikkat Inazza district of the city where the family was staying after their exile from Riyadh. When his father conquered Riyadh in 1902, Saud followed him with his mother and brothers.

Prince Saud&#x27;s full siblings were Prince Turki, Prince Khalid, Prince Abdullah and Princess Mounira. Of them Khalid and Abdullah died young. Their mother was Abdulaziz&#x27;s second wife, Wadha bint Muhammad Al Orair, who was from the Bani Khalid tribe. 

From the age of five, Prince Saud studied Sharia and the Quran under Sheikh Abdul Rahman Al-Mufaireej. He also learned archery and horse-riding amongst other things under the supervision of his father, as well as tribal lineages, and how to conduct peace agreements, and the art of wars, politics, diplomacy, and administration in the traditional Arabian ways. His formal tutors were his father&#x27;s advisors, Abdullah Al Damluji and Hafiz Wahba.

==Early career==
Saud accompanied his father on his many expeditions and, participated in several campaigns during the unification of the Arabian Peninsula. His first political mission was at the age of thirteen, leading a delegation to Qatar. The first battle he fought was at Jarrab in 1915, followed by one at Yatab in the same year, then Trubah in 1919. In 1925, he stopped the Almahmal crisis in Mecca. During his tenure as viceroy of Najd Prince Saud criticized his father due to the limitations on the Ikhwan through the newspaper &quot;Umm Al Qura&quot;. However, he later fought to stop the Ikhwan revolt at the battle of Sabilla in 1929.

On 11 May 1933, Saud was appointed Crown Prince which was announced in &quot;Umm Al Qura&quot; newspaper. His uncle Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman did not pledge his allegiance to Saud as crown prince and before the gathering he left Riyadh for Mecca. Upon his appointment as crown prince, Abdulaziz told his son that he should be devoted to spreading Islam, take good care of his subjects, and pay attention to the advice of religious scholars. Saud then promised his father that he would listen to his father&#x27;s advice.

The following year, King Abdulaziz sent two military expeditions; one of them was led by Crown Prince Saud, who regained Najran and advanced secretly through the rugged mountains in the northwest part of Yemen.

Following the end of the war with Yemen, Abdulaziz decided to encourage Saud to travel abroad. Accompanied by his father&#x27;s adviser Fuad Hamza and physician Dr. Medhat Sheikh el-Ard and some others, he visited: Transjordan, Palestine, Iraq, Egypt and Europe where he represented his father at the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1937. Saud struck a warm friendship with the young King Ghazi of Iraq, and earned plaudits from the Amir of Transjordan (later King Abdullah I of Jordan), who said to him: &quot;in his character, he represented the choicest and purest of the traits and attributes of the Arabian Peninsula.&quot; When a crisis erupted between the neighboring Bahrain and Qatar, Saud visited the former in December 1937 in order to help sort out their differences. This was followed by other visits to the until the eve of the Second World War.

After the war, when the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine appeared to be imminent, and leaders of the various Arab States met at Inshas in Egypt during 1946 in order to review the situation under the Chairmanship of King Farouk of Egypt, Saud was again selected by his father to represent him and his country, and participated in the adoption of the famous resolution that declared that: &quot;The Palestinian cause is the cause of all Arabs and not merely the Palestinians&quot;. In 1947, Saud visited the United States and met with President Harry S. Truman, and also met with leaders in Britain, France, and Italy, in order to acquaint the policymakers with his father&#x27;s views and the unacceptability of the infringement of the rights of the Palestinians.

Following Saud&#x27;s visits, he concentrated on the first areas to be deemed in sore need of modernization and reform in view of increasing revenues and expenditures, these were the governance and handling the country&#x27;s finances. After seeking advice and expert help from a number of friendly countries, primarily the US, the Saudi riyal was linked to the United States Dollar and apart from structural, regulatory, and procedural reforms within a revamped Ministry of Finance; a Central Bank under the name of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) was established during 1952.

In keeping with universal practice, a proper annual state budget had first been issued during 1948 and following the establishment of the above central banking body, SAMA, the third Saudi national budget for the year 1952 complied with internationally observed standards. During this period, technical co-operation, primarily in the guise of the arrival of 35 experts during 1952 and aimed at generating planned economic growth within the Kingdom also received a major boost.

Apart from financial and administrative reforms, the report presented to Abdulaziz by Prince Saud, had commended the implementation of a whole range of vital infrastructure projects relating to the improvement of facilities for the Pilgrims, so important to the Kingdom from a religious and economic point of view, water supply, roads, broadcasting service, health, municipal affairs, port improvements, customs reorganization, and higher education.

Plans for the paved road between Jeddah and Mecca had been announced by Saud during the Hajj of 1947, and the project for bringing water from the nearby Wadi Fatimah to Jeddah was also inaugurated by him shortly during November 1947. The Hajj of 1950 witnessed the establishment of the Mecca college that was later to be expanded and renamed Umm al-Qura University.

Many of these reforms, along with the complete reorganisation of the system of public administration, through the establishment or restructuring of new or existing ministries and departments, and conceived and recognised as the &quot;Crown Prince&#x27;s Reforms&quot;, issued from his Office by a Decree under his seal on 19 October 1952, were destined to be developed, built upon and some even implemented after the demise of Abdulaziz on 9 November 1953 and during Saud&#x27;s reign as King. The traditional Consultative Council in Mecca, the Majlis-ash-Shura or Consultative Assembly of Saudi Arabia was expanded on 17 November 1952.

Earlier, on 19 October 1953, Abdulaziz had also appointed Crown Prince Saud as prime minister for the first Saudi Cabinet. Before that, he appointed him as Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces and Internal Security Units on 25 August 1953. During this period, the Armed Forces of Saudi Arabia, including the Air Force, were modernized on a large scale with American assistance. The Saudi Arabian Airlines fleet was also expanded by the purchase of four new &#x27;Sky Masters&#x27; to primarily facilitate the transport of Pilgrims from their homes to the sites of pilgrimage and back, and also within the Kingdom. On 10 June 1953, Saud with the approval of his father also laid the foundation stone for the expansion and refurbishment of the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque in Medina. Earlier on, following a visit, he had recommended to Abdulaziz the need for the adoption of this step, which the latter had sanctioned.

==Reign==

Saud succeeded his father Abdulaziz as King on 9 November 1953 upon the latter&#x27;s death. He ascended the throne in a political climate very different from the time when his father Abdulaziz established his Kingdom.

During his reign one of King Saud&#x27;s major advisors was Abdulaziz Al Muammar.

===National policy===
King Saud announced to the new council of ministers in his very first speech as King, that, while his father&#x27;s reign was noted for military conquests, he intended his reign to be &quot;a war on poverty, ignorance, and disease with the equitable application of the dictates of the holy Sharia laws to all without exception, and the creation of a strong army&quot;.
In order to cope adequately with the responsibilities of this challenge, and facilitate realistically the implementation of his programme he initially doubled the number of ministries to ten by adding the portfolios of education, agriculture, health, commerce, and industry, plus two directorates: Labour and broadcasting and the bureau of public inspection in 1955, to the existing ministries of foreign affairs, finance, interior, defence, and communications. In 1953, the decision had already been taken to move the ministries, then located in Jeddah, to Riyadh, the country&#x27;s official capital. This had called for the construction of suitable new buildings and the provision of adequate housing for employees. This was an ignition point for Riyadh&#x27;s modernization and development. Saud&#x27;s half-brother and crown prince, Faisal bin Abdulaziz, was appointed prime minister while retaining his former portfolio of foreign minister. A five years plan was started, as mentioned in King Saud&#x27;s first cabinet speech in 1954. The same year King Saud established the Grievance Board which was attached to the council of ministers which became an independent body in 1955. The board was headed by Musaid bin Abdul Rahman, a young uncle of King Saud.

In January 1954 King Saud signed an agreement with Greek businessman Aristotle Socrates Onassis to establish a state-owned maritime tanker company. Given that the agreement was not in favor of the US interests it was soon terminated as a result of foreign pressures.

In 1957, King Saud also founded King Saud University in Riyadh. He clarified the duties and responsibilities of the cabinet minister in May 1958. He declared in 1960 that schools would be established to educate girls in religious matters, including Quran, creed, and fiqh as well as in other sciences which were acceptable in Islamic tradition such as house management, and raising and disciplining children.

===Foreign relations===

King Saud played a role of utmost importance on the regional, Arab, Islamic, and international political stages. He started his worldwide tours after finishing touring of his country&#x27;s regions. He visited Arab and friendly countries for strategic and political purposes. He began his tour in 1954 in Egypt, followed by Kuwait, Bahrain, Jordan, Yemen, and Pakistan.

He announced that his sole purpose was to &quot;unify Muslims all over the world&quot; so they would be like one strong body. King Saud believed in a non-alignment policy between the United States and the Soviet Union, which he discussed thoroughly with Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru during an official visit to India. He also strove to keep the region free from coalitions and blocs that only served foreign interests and thus he refused to join the Baghdad Pact. Despite pressure exerted from the West, he approved upon meeting President Gamal Abdel Nasser and the Syrian President Shukri al-Quwatli in Cairo in March 1956 of making a joint statement regarding their understanding of security and defense matters, that coincided with other agreements in the financial, economical and development area.

In November 1955, King Saud granted a 16 million dollars loan to Syria for five years. He agreed to exchange products and exempt agricultural products from import-export license and custom duties. With the continuous Israeli assault on Jordan in 1955, King Saud invited military leaders of Egypt, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan to Riyadh in order to discuss procedures to counter the aggression. He agreed to cover all expenses of reinforcing Jordan&#x27;s National Guard and armed forces. He also supported the Algerian revolution against France, diplomatically and financially. King Saud made a statement inviting people to donate money for the revolution; the donations amounted to $1,200,000. The government donated one million dollars of that amount in 1956, and the rest of the donations were granted yearly. King Saud kept granting donations to Algeria and kept defending it until it established its independence in 1962.

Imam Ahmad bin Yahya of Yemen joined the Arab endeavors to unify their ranks when he signed the joint defense agreement with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Syria. This event took place after the Imam&#x27;s meeting with King Saud, President Gamal Abdel Nasser, and President Shukri al-Quwatli on 21 April 1956, following the Jeddah Pact between Saudi Arabia and Yemen.

Maintaining his support to the Arab countries after the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company on 26 July 1956, although the Egyptian Government did not consult him as it did with Syria in taking that decision contrary to his expectations as a military ally. He succeeded in strengthening his relation with King Faisal II of Iraq after a meeting held in Dammam on 20 September 1956. It was followed that same month and in the same place by a meeting with President Gamal Abdel Nasser and the Syrian President Shukri al-Quwatli during which he confirmed his total support for the Egyptian stand in this crisis. When Britain, France, and Israel invaded Egypt on 29 October 1956 as a result of the nationalization of the canal, King Saud declared a general mobilization and ordered the opening of enlistment offices.

He offered total assistance to the Egyptian government, personally supervising operations and welcoming Egyptian combat planes into his country for their protection. Among the first to enlist were Fahd bin Abdulaziz, Sultan bin Abdulaziz, Salman bin Abdulaziz and King Saud&#x27;s son Fahd bin Saud, along with many other princes. As a means of exerting pressure on the British and French governments, he used a weapon never used before, when he blocked oil exports, banning all British and French tankers and other tankers carrying Saudi oil to these two countries. He also broke off relations with Britain and France.

King Saud had used this economic weapon for the first time although he was aware of the possible repercussions of such a procedure on the national economy. He sustained his support after the war so as to remove the aftermath of the aggression. He offered generous contributions, including 2 million Saudi riyals to the Egyptian Red Crescent to help victims of Port Said.

King Saud was still keen on keeping the region free of political and defense blocs that only support a superpower against another. Despite his solid relations with the American system, on which he relied in several areas because of the oil discovery and production, he seriously thought of canceling the American access for using Dhahran airport as a means of exerting pressure on the United States of America.

Despite traditionally intimate ties of his country with the United States of America, and the ingrained alienation of communism and Islamic beliefs, he refused to join the American sponsored the Baghdad Pact of 1955, (later on the Central Treaty Organisation – CENTO), – aimed at opposing the expansion of Communist influence in the region, despite the involvement of the fellow Arab State of Iraq in it, along with Iran, Turkey, Pakistan and Britain. Jordan, which also was keen to join the Pact and Syria as well, had been discouraged from doing so with the aid of political and financial pressure.

President of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower invited King Saud to undertake an official visit to the U.S. in 1957 since he believed that King Saud played a crucial role in implementing his doctrine of deterring and fighting communism in the Middle East and the Islamic countries. Once King Saud received the invitation he convened with Presidents Gamal Abdel Nasser and Shukri al-Quwatli in Cairo in January 1957. The three leaders agreed to try to convince Eisenhower to pressure the Israeli government to evacuate occupied Sharm El Sheikh that overlooks the Gulf of Aqaba and to withdraw to the borders of the previous truce on all frontiers.

He maintained his support to the countries at war with Israel, and signed a ten-year agreement with the Egyptian and Syrian presidents and with King Hussein of Jordan to ease Jordan&#x27;s financial burdens as a result of this conflict. The annual Egyptian and Saudi financial assistance added up to five million Egyptian pounds from each of the two countries.

He also discussed with the American President his dispute with Britain over the Al Buraymi Oasis, an oil zone between the frontiers of Saudi Arabia, Oman and Abu Dhabi which was under British protection. The issue of the Al Buraymi Oasis was one of the issues that had been raised since the reign of his father King Abdulaziz and was still pending. After several clashes, the case went to international arbitration. When he accepted the American president&#x27;s invitation to the United States he received a good welcome, but the Mayor of New York, Robert F. Wagner, Jr., refused to welcome the King because of his national and Islamic politics.

King Saud delivered an important speech during the banquet held by Dag Hammarskjöld, the Swedish UN Secretary-General in which he addressed the different aspects of the Arab complaints, in accordance with the UN charter and its powers. He invited all countries to value the charter and implement it in full; he also addressed the outcomes and repercussions of the Cold War. During his negotiations with the American president in Washington on 2 February 1957, the American President explained the principles and objectives of his doctrine, known as the Eisenhower Doctrine, and the effective role that he expected of him as a powerful friend of the United States of America and as an eminent Arab and Muslim leader in fighting the communist movement invading the Middle East and the Islamic countries.

Within this scheme, Dwight D. Eisenhower offered a 25 million dollar loan to the Saudi Government on 24 January 1957. In return, King Saud explained that he had refused Soviet Union military aid to fight Britain and that Britain&#x27;s policy was what urged the Arabs to seek the Soviet Union&#x27;s help. He also stressed that the &quot;non-aligned&quot; countries in the region were benefiting from Soviet aid more than the American allied countries were benefiting from American aid. He considered that this aid should double if the American President wished to succeed in his endeavors. King Saud asked Dwight D. Eisenhower to exert pressure on Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories of Palestine and settle the Palestinian cause, and to convince France to reach a settlement regarding the independence of Algeria. On the other hand, he promised to inform the Arabs of the Eisenhower Doctrine and its purposes; and to inquire about the Arab reaction on the official and officious levels before making any commitments. King Saud explained to the American President that a large bulk of his country&#x27;s budget was allocated to development projects and to the five-year plan and that he needed military aid before being able to play any role expected from him in fighting Communism. The American government agreed to give him a 250 million dollar loan and all kinds of land, sea, and air weaponry, and to train the Saudi army on how to use them.

In return, the American government was to be granted facilities to use Dhahran airport for five years, after which it would be returned with all its equipment to the Saudi Government in 1962.
Before briefing his Arab peers about the results of this visit and the Eisenhower Doctrine, King Saud visited Spain, Morocco, Tunisia and Libya and informed them of these results. In February 1957 he met the leaders of Egypt, Syria, and Jordan in Cairo and informed them of Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s objectives. Under the influence of Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser and the Syrian President Shukri al-Quwatli, King Saud, wanting to support a unanimous Arab stand, decided to back up the Egyptian and Syrian Presidents in their decision not to contribute to the Eisenhower Doctrine.

When the Republic of Iraq decided to annex Kuwait in 1961 under Abd al-Karim Qasim, King Saud protested in international forums, declaring &quot;any action against Kuwait is an action against Saudi Arabia.&quot;

===Struggle with Faisal===
Immediately after Abdulaziz&#x27;s death, a fierce struggle erupted between his two eldest surviving sons, Saud and Faisal. The increase in oil revenues did not solve the financial problem associated with Saudi Arab debt, estimated to have been $US200 million in 1953. In fact, this debt more than doubled by 1958, when it reached $US450 million. The Saudi riyal lost half of its official value against the United States dollars. Both ARAMCO and international banks declined Saudi&#x27;s demand for credit. Saud suspended the few government projects he had initiated but continued his spending on luxurious palaces.

In 1958, Saud was forced to delegate most of his executive powers to Faisal. Saud and Faisal fought an internal battle over the definition of political responsibilities and the division of government functions. Saud was often associated among other things with the plundering of oil revenues, luxurious palaces, and conspiracy inside and outside of Saudi Arabia while Faisal was associated with sobriety, piety, puritanism, thriftiness, and modernization.

The battle between the two brothers was fought over the role to be assigned to the Council of Ministers. Saud abolished the office of Prime Minister by royal decree, thus enforcing his position as King and &quot;de facto&quot; prime minister. Saud thought of himself as both King and prime minister whereas Faisal envisioned more powers being in his own hand as Crown Prince and deputy prime minister.

===Forced abdication===
King Saud&#x27;s family members worried about Saud&#x27;s profligacy and his inability to meet the challenge of Nasser&#x27;s Egypt. Corruption and backwardness weakened the regime. Radio Cairo&#x27;s anti-Saudi broadcasting was finding a receptive audience.

King Saud and Prince Faisal continued their power struggle until 1962 when Prince Faisal formed a cabinet in the absence of the King, who had gone abroad for medical treatment. Prince Faisal allied with Prince Fahd and Prince Sultan. Prince Faisal&#x27;s new government excluded the sons of Saud. He promised a ten-point reform that included the drafting of the basic law, the abolition of slavery, and the establishment of a judicial council.

Upon his return, King Saud rejected Prince Faisal&#x27;s new arrangement and threatened to mobilize the Royal Guard against his brother. In response, Prince Faisal demanded King Saud make him regent and turn over all royal powers to him. In this, he had the crucial backing of the ulema (elite Islamic scholars), including a &quot;fatwa&quot; (edict) issued by the grand mufti of Saudi Arabia, a relative of Prince Faisal on his mother&#x27;s side, calling on King Saud to accede to his brother&#x27;s demands.

King Saud continued his attempts to regain power and formed a cabinet in Jeddah in December 1963. He ordered the Mecca radio to announce the formation of his cabinet. The army forces loyal to Faisal besieged the radio station and did not allow the radio to broadcast it. In addition, Faisal gave an ultimatum to the king to leave Saudi Arabia.

Following these events Faisal ordered the National Guard to surround Saud&#x27;s palace. In March 1964 Saud finally relented and named Faisal regent with full executive powers, effectively reducing himself to a figurehead. In November, the ulema, cabinet and senior members of the ruling family forced Saud to abdicate altogether, and Faisal became king in his own right. At the same time Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz was sent to Al Naṣariah Palace of King Saud to demand his and his sons&#x27; loyalty to the chosen king, Faisal. On 28 November 1964 an official announcement was made in Radio Mecca stating that 11 of Saud&#x27;s sons had declared allegiance to King Faisal.

On 6 January 1965 Saud went to the palace with his uncle Abdullah bin Abdul Rahman to declare his allegiance to King Faisal.

===Exile and later life===
Following this event Saud left Saudi Arabia in January 1965. He was suggested to enter exile in Geneva, Switzerland, and then on to other European cities, but he settled in Athens. Later he unsuccessfully attempted to settle in Beirut. In 1966 Saud was invited by Nasser to live in Egypt; another report claims that King Saud went to Egypt under refuge granted by Nasser and stayed there from 1966 to 1967. King Saud was also allowed to broadcast on Radio Cairo. Some of his sons, including Prince Khalid, Prince Badr, Prince Sultan and Prince Mansour, joined him and supported his attempt to regain the throne. However, after the June 1967 Arab-Israel War, he lost the support of Egypt. In October 1967 he left Egypt and went first to Vienna and then to Athens where he remained until his death on 23 February 1969.

==Personal life==

Saud had 108 children and three wives at the time of his death. One of his many wives was Fawzia bint Nawwaf, a granddaughter of Nuri Al Shalaan, the Emir of the Ruwullah tribe. One of Sauds grandchildren; Amatalhaq Alhadi, mediator in Yemeni affairs who is still working today. Another; Dalal bint Saud Al Saud, palace figure, philanthropist who also had some parts in women&#x27;s rights up until 2021. Only few of his daughters have or had any public role.

His eldest son, Fahd, was minister of defense from 1956 to 1960. His youngest child is Basmah bint Saud. His third son, Muhammed, was sometime governor of Al Bahah Province and died on 8 July 2012. Prince Mishari, replaced his elder brother as Al Bahah governor with the rank of minister in August 2010.

Another son, Mishaal, was the governor of Najran Province from 1996 to November 2008. His son Abdul Rahman was a supporter of Al Nassr FC. One son, Badr bin Saud, was governor of Riyadh during his father&#x27;s reign, while another son, Hussam, is a businessman.

One of his daughters, named Hajer, died outside the Kingdom following an illness on 17 November 2011. Her funeral prayer was performed at Imam Turki bin Abdullah Mosque in Riyadh after Asr prayer. Another daughter, Noura, was the mother of the former deputy defense minister Fahd bin Abdullah bin Mohammed Al Saud and died in late July 2013. Another daughter, Hessah, was the first Saudi woman to become the principal of a school. His daughter Fahda is an artist.

In 2001, his daughter Buniah (born 1960) was arrested and charged with assaulting her maid in Florida. She was held for one night in prison and was released on bail of $5,000 and ordered to surrender her passport. After the death of his elder brother Turki, Saud married his wife, Muneera bint Obaid; their daughter, Al Anoud, died in January 2006 aged 83 and was buried in Mecca.

He was described as &quot;although not as large as his illustrious father, King Saud is about six feet two inches (187 cm) in height and weighs well over two hundred pounds. Like his father, he has weak eyes, but he has also inherited Abdulaziz&#x27;s magnetic smile and a keen sense of humor, which wins him many friends.&quot;

The &quot;Red Palace&quot; which King Abdulaziz built for King Saud and his mother was opened by the Ministry of Culture in 2019 to the public. It was Saudi Arabia&#x27;s first concrete building and now exhibits displays about his life.

==Death and funeral==
King Saud died at the age of 67 on 23 February 1969 in Athens after suffering a heart attack. Two days before his death, he felt ill and asked his doctor Filnger from Austria to examine him. However, his physician arrived after he had died. In the morning of that day, Saud took a short walk on a beach with his daughter Nozhah, near the hotel where he used to live (Hotel Kavouri). His body was taken to Mecca then to Riyadh and the funeral ceremony took place at the Great Mosque in Mecca. He was buried next to his father&#x27;s and grandfathers&#x27; graves at Al Oud cemetery in Riyadh.

==Awards==

Immediately after his accession to the throne Iranian ruler Mohammad Reza Pahlavi sent King Saud the highest decoration of the Imperial Iran, Order of Pahlavi. 

During his reign, King Saud was the recipient of many honors and orders of various nations. In the formal portraits of King Saud in ceremonial uniform, he is wearing the breast stars of the following orders.

* Syrian Republic: Order of the Umayyads.
* Lebanon: The Order of the Cedar.
* Afghanistan: The Order of the Supreme Sun.
In the central display case, the following Orders are on display:
* Kingdom of Libya: Star and Sash of the Order of Mohammed Ibn Ali El Senoussi.
* Jordan: Star of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance.
* Spain: Star and Sash of the Order of Civil Merit.
* Greece: Star of the Order of Saint Mark.
* Egypt: Collar of the Order of the Nile (1954)
* Unknown: A poorly manufactured breast star – possibly a trial piece.
It was during King Saud&#x27;s reign that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia instituted, either in 1954 or 1955, its own series of orders, decorations, and medals. This series of awards consisted of the following:
* Order of King Abdulaziz
* Star of King Saud

<text>Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Brent Thirsk, (born August 17, 1953) is a Canadian retired engineer and physician, and a former Canadian Space Agency astronaut. He holds the Canadian record for the most time spent in space (204 days, 18 hours and 29 minutes). He became an officer of the Order of Canada (OC) in 2013 and was named to the Order of British Columbia (OBC) in 2012.

==Life==
Thirsk is from New Westminster, British Columbia and is married to Brenda Biasutti of Montreal, Quebec. They have three children. He enjoys spending time with his family, as well as flying, hockey, squash, and playing the piano.

He is a member of Professional Engineers Ontario, the College of Family Physicians of Canada, the Canadian Aeronautics and Space Institute, the Aerospace Medical Association, the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, and the International Space University.

He won the Association of Professional Engineers, Geologists and Geophysicists of Alberta Gold Medal in 1976, and was the first recipient of the University of Calgary Distinguished Alumni Award (1985). In 1997, he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Professional Engineers of Ontario and was awarded honorary membership in the &quot;College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia&quot;.

==Education==
Thirsk attended primary and secondary schools in British Columbia, Alberta, and Manitoba, attending Glenayre Elementary School (Port Moody, B.C.), R. T. Alderman Junior High and graduating from Calgary&#x27;s Lord Beaverbrook High School. His post-secondary education began with receiving a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Calgary in 1976, and continued with a Master of Science degree in mechanical engineering from MIT in 1978, an M.D. from McGill University in 1982, and his MBA from the MIT Sloan School of Management in 1998 as a Sloan Fellow. He received an honorary doctorate from the University of Calgary while in orbit on July 8, 2009. Fellow ISS crewmember Koichi Wakata placed the convocation cape on Thirsk, which was later removed due to it constantly floating up to his face. This event made Thirsk the first person to receive a university degree from space. In 2019, Thirsk was awarded an honorary D.Eng. from Carleton University in recognition of his outstanding career as a Canadian astronaut, his many contributions to scientific and health research, and his promotion of science education and lifelong learning.

==CSA career==
Thirsk was in the family medicine residency program at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Montreal when he was selected in December 1983 by the National Research Council of Canada to join the Canadian astronaut program. He began astronaut training in February 1984 and served as backup payload specialist to Marc Garneau for space shuttle mission STS-41-G, which flew October 5 to 13, 1984. He has participated in several parabolic flight experiment campaigns on board NASA&#x27;s KC-135 aircraft and has been involved in various projects relating to space medicine, the International Space Station, mission planning, and education with the Canadian Space Agency. He led an international research team investigating the effect of weightlessness on the heart and blood vessels. His team designed and tested an experimental &quot;anti-gravity suit&quot; that may help astronauts withstand the effects of extended spaceflight on the cardiovascular system.

He served as Chief Astronaut of the Canadian Space Agency in 1993 and 1994. In February 1994, he was crew commander for the CAPSULS mission, a simulated 7-day space mission that involved the participation of several international investigators and three other Canadian astronauts. In 1994–95, Thirsk completed a sabbatical year in Victoria, British Columbia. During this year, he improved his skills in clinical practice, space medicine research and Russian language training.
On June 20, 1996, Thirsk flew aboard space shuttle mission STS-78 (the life and microgravity Spacelab mission) as a payload specialist. During this 17-day flight aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;, he and his six crewmates performed 43 experiments devoted to the study of life and materials science. Most of these experiments were conducted within the pressurized Spacelab laboratory module situated in the orbiter&#x27;s payload bay. The life science experiments investigated changes in plants, animals and humans under spaceflight conditions. The materials science experiments examined protein crystallization, fluid dynamics, and high-temperature solidification of multi-phase materials in microgravity.

While on STS-78, Thirsk wrote two columns for the &quot;Calgary Sun&quot; newspaper. This was the first occasion in which an astronaut wrote and filed a story to a newspaper—and had it published—while the astronaut was still in orbit.

In 1998, Thirsk was assigned by the Canadian Space Agency to NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center in Houston to pursue mission specialist training. This training program involves advanced instruction on both shuttle and space station systems, EVA (spacewalking), robotic operations, and Russian language. Within the NASA Astronaut Office, Thirsk served as a CapCom (capsule communicator) for the International Space Station (ISS) program. CapComs participate in actual and simulated space missions as a communication link between the ground team at Mission Control and the astronauts in orbit. CapComs speak directly with the space station crew, and assist with technical planning for the mission and last-minute troubleshooting.

In October 2004, Thirsk served as the commander of the NEEMO 7 mission aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory, living and working underwater for eleven days. As a back-up crewmember, Thirsk replaced fellow CSA astronaut Dafydd Williams, who had previously served as an aquanaut on the NEEMO 1 mission, due to Williams undergoing review of a temporary medical issue. Williams eventually served as the commander of NEEMO 9 in April 2006.

In 2004, Thirsk trained at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre near Moscow and became certified as a flight engineer for the Soyuz spacecraft. He served as backup flight engineer to European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Roberto Vittori for the Soyuz TMA-6 taxi mission to the ISS in April 2005. During the ten-day mission, Thirsk worked as Crew Interface Coordinator (European CapCom) at the Columbus Control Centre in Germany.
Thirsk was a member of the Expedition 21 crew on the International Space Station. He launched as a flight engineer on the Soyuz TMA-15 Soyuz mission on May 27, 2009, as a member of the Expedition 20 crew. He was the first Canadian astronaut to fly on a Soyuz. About this mission, Thirsk is quoted saying &quot;It will be the supreme thrill of my life. Throughout the mission I will examine the long-term effects of zero gravity as both a test subject and a physician. My findings will undoubtedly contribute to the future understanding of space station living.&quot; He returned to Earth on Soyuz TMA-15 in November 2009.

During the ISS 20/21 flight, he was visited by two other Canadians: Julie Payette (Space Shuttle Endeavour STS 127) and space tourist Guy Laliberté on Soyuz TMA-16 at the end of September 2009. The meeting between Thirsk and Payette in July 2009 was the first time two Canadians met in space. He and the Soyuz TMA-15 crew returned to Earth December 1, 2009.

On April 12, 2011, Thirsk was awarded the Russian Medal &quot;For Merit in Space Exploration&quot; – for outstanding contribution to the development of international cooperation in crewed space flight. In 2012, he was made a Member of the Order of British Columbia and in 2013 he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada

==Post-CSA career==

From August 2012 to February 2014, Thirsk worked for the Canadian Institutes of Health Research as Vice President, Public, Government and Institute Affairs. The institute is the Canadian government&#x27;s health research investment agency.

In September 2013, a Senior High School in Calgary, Alberta opened honoring Thirsk, named Robert Thirsk High School.

Thirsk became Chancellor of the University of Calgary on July 1, 2014.

In 2021 Robert made a trip to the UK where he gave a speech to Loughborough Grammar School.

<doc id="402555" wikidata="Q4275577" url="?curid=402555" title="Civic Act-up">
<text>Civic Act-up () is a small pro-democracy political group in Hong Kong. It was founded on 24 September 2003 by a group of relatively young activists with the encouragement of Legislative Councillor Cyd Ho, to challenge the existing pro-government district councillors in Wanchai District in the 2003 District Council elections. There is no formal structure in the group.

==Beliefs==
The platform of the group includes pressing for universal suffrage for the Chief Executive and Legislative Council, improvements in urban design and transportation, paying special attention to youth, women and ethnic minority issues, and extending anti-discrimination laws to the areas of age, sexual orientation and race.

==History==
It was formed in the background of the 2003 July 1 march, where half of a million Hong Kong people showed up in the demonstration against the legislation of the Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23 and the Tung Chee-hwa administration. In the wake of the massive civil movement, Legislative Councillor Cyd Ho So-lan formed the Civic Act-up to contest in the Wanchai District in the 2003 District Council elections. Three out of five candidates of the group won in the 2003 District Council elections, with Cyd Ho defeated the pro-Beijing DAB&#x27;s Legislative Councillor Ip Kwok-him in the Kwun Lung constituency in Central and Western District.

In 2004 LegCo elections, Cyd Ho, representing the Civic Act-up, lost her seat to DAB&#x27;s Choy So-yuk with a narrow margin in Hong Kong Island due to tactical mistake of the ally Democratic Party. Cyd Ho revenged her defeat in the 2012 LegCo elections by winning in Hong Kong Island.

In 2012, Cyd Ho joined the Labour Party and ran under the Labour banner in the 2012 LegCo elections.

It is composed of the descendants of Muhammad bin Saud, founder of the Emirate of Diriyah, known as the First Saudi State, (1727–1818), and his brothers, though the ruling faction of the family is primarily led by the descendants of Ibn Saud, the modern founder of Saudi Arabia. It forms a subtribe of the larger prominent ancient Banu Hanifa tribe of Arabia, from which well known 7th century Arabian theologist Maslama ibn Ḥabīb originates. The most influential position of the royal family is the King of Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarch. The family in total is estimated to comprise 15,000 members; however, the majority of power, influence and wealth is possessed by a group of about 2,000 of them. Some estimates of the royal family&#x27;s wealth measure their net worth at $1.4 trillion. This figure includes the market capitalization of Saudi Aramco, the state oil and gas company, and its vast assets in fossil fuel reserves, making them the wealthiest family in the world and the wealthiest in recorded history.

The House of Saud has had four phases: the Sheikhdom of Diriyah (1446–1744); the Emirate of Diriyah (1727–1818), marked by the expansion of Salafism; the Emirate of Nejd (1824–1891), marked with continuous infighting; and the current state (1902–present), which evolved into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932 and now wields considerable influence in the Middle East. The family has had conflicts with the Ottoman Empire, the Sharif of Mecca, the Al Rashid family of Ha&#x27;il and their vassal houses in Najd along with numerous Islamist groups both inside and outside Saudi Arabia and Shia minority in Saudi Arabia.

The succession to the Saudi Arabian throne was designed to pass from one son of the first king, Ibn Saud, to another. The monarchy was hereditary by agnatic seniority until 2006, when a royal decree provided that future Saudi kings are to be elected by a committee of Saudi princes. King Salman, who reigns currently, first replaced the next crown prince, his brother Muqrin, with his nephew Muhammad bin Nayef. In 2017, Muhammad bin Nayef was replaced by Mohammed bin Salman, King Salman&#x27;s son, as the crown prince after an approval by the Allegiance Council with 31 out of 34 votes. The king-appointed cabinet includes more members of the royal family.

==Title==

&quot;House of Saud&quot; is a translation of &quot;ʾĀl Saud&quot;, an Arabic dynastic name formed by adding the word &quot;&quot; (meaning &quot;family of&quot; or &quot;House of&quot;, not to be confused with meaning &quot;the&quot;) to the personal name of an ancestor. In the case of the Al Saud, the ancestor is Saud ibn Muhammad ibn Muqrin, the father of the dynasty&#x27;s 18th century founder Muhammad bin Saud (Muhammad, son of Saud).

The surname &quot;Al Saud&quot; is carried by any descendant of Muhammad bin Saud or his three brothers Farhan, Thunayyan, and Mishari. Al Saud&#x27;s other family branches like Saud Al Kabir, the Al Jiluwi, the Al Thunayan, the Al Mishari and the Al Farhan are called cadet branches. Members of the cadet branches hold high and influential positions in government though they are not in the line of succession to the Saudi throne. Many cadet members intermarry within the Al Saud to re-establish their lineage and continue to wield influence in the government.

All male members of the royal family have the title of Emir (Prince). However, the sons and patrilineal grandsons of Kings are referred to by the style &quot;His Royal Highness&quot; (HRH), differing from patrilineal great-grandsons and members of cadet branches who are called &quot;His Highness&quot; (HH), while the reigning king uses the additional title of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.

==History==
===Origins and early history===
The earliest recorded ancestor of the Al Saud was Mani&#x27; ibn Rabiah Al-Muraydi, who settled in Diriyah in 1446–1447 with his clan, the Mrudah. The Mrudah are believed to be descended from the Banu Hanifa branch of the larger Rabi&#x27;ah tribal confederation. The Banu Hanifa played an important role in shaping the Middle East and Arabia from the 6th century. 

Mani&#x27; was invited to Diriyah by a relative named Ibn Dir, who was the ruler of a group of villages and estates that make up modern-day Riyadh. Mani&#x27;s clan had been on a sojourn in east Arabia, near Al-Qatif, from an unknown point in time. Ibn Dir handed Mani two estates, called al-Mulaybeed and Ghusayba. Mani and his family settled and renamed the region Al Diriyah after their benefactor Ibn Dir.

The Mrudah became rulers of Al Diriyah, which prospered along the banks of Wadi Hanifa and became an important Najdi settlement. As the clan grew larger, power struggles ensued, with one branch leaving for nearby Dhruma, while another branch (the &quot;Al Watban&quot;) left for the town of az-Zubayr in southern Iraq. The Al Muqrin became the ruling family among the Mrudah in Diriyah.

The name of the clan comes from Sheikh Saud ibn Muhammad ibn Muqrin, who died in 1725.

===Emirate of Diriyah===

The First Saudi State was founded in 1727. This period was marked by conquest of neighboring areas and by religious zeal. At its height, the First Saudi State included most of the territory of modern-day Saudi Arabia, and raids by Al Saud&#x27;s allies and followers reached into Yemen, Oman, Syria, and Iraq. Islamic scholars, particularly Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab and his descendants, are believed to have played a significant role in Saudi rule during this period. The Saudis and their allies referred to themselves during this period as the &quot;Muwahhidun&quot; or &quot;Ahl al-Tawhid&quot; (&quot;the monotheists&quot;). Later they were referred to as the Wahhabis, a particularly strict, puritanical Islamic sect, named for its founder.

Leadership of Al Saud during the time of their first state passed from father to son without incident. The first imam, Muhammad bin Saud, was succeeded by his eldest son, Abdulaziz in 1765. In 1802, Abdulaziz&#x27;s forces led 10,000 Wahhabi soldiers in an attack on the Shi&#x27;ite holy city of Karbala, in what is now southern Iraq and where Hussein ibn Ali, the grandson of Muhammad is buried. The Wahhabi soldiers killed more than 2,000 people, including women and children. They plundered the city, demolishing the massive golden dome above Hussein&#x27;s tomb and loaded hundreds of camels with weapons, jewelry, coins and other valuable goods.

The attack on Karbala convinced the Ottomans and the Egyptians that the Saudis were a threat to regional peace. Abdulaziz was killed in 1803 by an assassin, believed by some to have been a Shi&#x27;ite seeking revenge over the sacking of Karbala the year before. Abdul-Aziz was in turn succeeded by his son, Saud, under whose rule the Saudi state reached its greatest extent. By the time Saud died in 1814, his son and successor Abdullah bin Saud had to contend with an Ottoman-Egyptian invasion in the Wahhabi war seeking to retake lost Ottoman Empire territory. The mainly Egyptian force succeeded in defeating Abdullah&#x27;s forces, taking over the then-Saudi capital of Diriyyah in 1818. Abdullah was taken prisoner and was soon beheaded by the Ottomans in Constantinople, putting an end to the First Saudi State. The Egyptians sent many members of the Al Saud clan and other members of the local nobility as prisoners to Egypt and Constantinople, and razed the Saudi capital of Diriyyah.

===Emirate of Nejd===

A few years after the fall of Diriyah in 1818, the Saudis were able to re-establish their authority in Najd, establishing the Emirate of Nejd, commonly known as the Second Saudi State, with its capital in Riyadh.

Compared to the First Saudi State, the second Saudi period was marked by less territorial expansion (it never reconquered the Hijaz or &#x27;Asir, for example) and less religious zeal, although the Saudi leaders continued to go by the title of &quot;imam&quot; and still employed Salafi religious scholars. The second state was also marked by severe internal conflicts within the Saudi family, eventually leading to the dynasty&#x27;s downfall. In all but one instance, succession occurred by assassination or civil war, the exception being the passage of authority from Faisal ibn Turki to his son Abdullah ibn Faisal ibn Turki.

===Present form===

After his defeat at Mulayda, Abdul Rahman bin Faisal went with his family into exile in the deserts of eastern Arabia among the Al Murra bedouin. Soon afterward, however, he found refuge in Kuwait as a guest of the Kuwaiti emir, Mubarak Al Sabah. In 1902, Abdul Rahman&#x27;s son, Abdulaziz, took on the task of restoring Saudi rule in Riyadh. Supported by a few dozen followers and accompanied by some of his brothers and relatives, Abdulaziz was able to capture Riyadh&#x27;s Masmak fort and kill the governor appointed there by Muhammad bin Abdullah Al Rashid. Abdulaziz, reported to have been barely 20 at the time, was immediately proclaimed ruler in Riyadh. As the new leader of the House of Saud, Abdulaziz became commonly known from that time onward as &quot;Ibn Saud&quot; in Western sources, though he is still called &quot;Abdulaziz&quot; in the Arab world.

Ibn Saud spent the next three decades trying to re-establish his family&#x27;s rule over central Arabia, starting with his native Najd. His chief rivals were the Al Rashid clan in Ha&#x27;il, the Sharifs of Mecca in the Hijaz, and the Ottoman Turks in al Hasa. Abdulaziz also had to contend with the descendants of his late uncle Saud ibn Faisal (later known as the &quot;Saud Al Kabir&quot; branch of the family), pretenders to the throne. Though for a time acknowledging the sovereignty of the Ottoman Sultans and even taking the title of &quot;pasha&quot;, Ibn Saud allied himself to the British, in opposition to the Ottoman-backed Al Rashidis. From 1915 to 1927, Abdulaziz&#x27;s dominions were a protectorate of the British Empire, pursuant to the 1915 Treaty of Darin.

Ibn Saud won final victory over the Al Rashidis in 1921, making him the ruler of most of central Arabia. He consolidated his dominions as the Sultanate of Nejd. He then turned his attention to the Hijaz, finally conquering it in 1926, just months before the British protectorate ended. For the next five and a half years, he administered the two parts of his dual realm, the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd, as separate units.

By 1932, Ibn Saud had disposed of all his main rivals and consolidated his rule over much of the Arabian Peninsula. He united his dominions into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that year. His father, Abdul Rahman, retained the honorary title of &quot;imam&quot;. In 1937, near Dammam, American surveyors discovered what later proved to be Saudi Arabia&#x27;s vast oil reserves. Before the discovery of oil, many family members were destitute.

Ibn Saud sired dozens of children by his many wives. He had at most four wives at a time, divorcing many times. He made sure to marry into many of the noble clans and tribes within his territory, including the chiefs of the Bani Khalid, Ajman, and Shammar tribes, as well as the Al ash-Sheikh (descendants of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab). He also arranged for his sons and relatives to enter into similar marriages. He appointed his eldest surviving son, Saud as heir apparent, to be succeeded by the next eldest son, Faisal. The Al Saudi family became known as the &quot;royal family&quot;, and each member, male and female, was accorded the title &quot;amir&quot; (&quot;prince&quot;) or &quot;amira&quot; (&quot;princess&quot;), respectively.

Ibn Saud died in 1953, after having cemented an alliance with the United States in 1945. He is still celebrated officially as the &quot;Founder&quot;, and only his direct descendants may take on the title of &quot;his or her Royal Highness&quot;. The date of his recapture of Riyadh in 1902 was chosen to mark Saudi Arabia&#x27;s centennial in 1999 (according to the Islamic lunar calendar).

Upon Ibn Saud&#x27;s death, his son Saud assumed the throne without incident, but his lavish spending led to a power struggle with his brother, Crown Prince Faisal. In 1964, the royal family forced Saud to abdicate in favor of Faisal, aided by an edict from the country&#x27;s grand mufti. During this period, some of Ibn Saud&#x27;s younger sons, led by Talal ibn Abdul Aziz, defected to Egypt, calling themselves the &quot;Free Princes&quot; and calling for liberalization and reform, but were later induced to return by Faisal. They were fully pardoned but were also barred from any future positions in government.

Faisal was assassinated in 1975 by a nephew, Faisal bin Musaid, who was promptly executed. Another brother, Khalid, assumed the throne. The next prince in line had actually been Prince Muhammad, but he had relinquished his claim to the throne in favor of Khalid, his only full brother.

Khalid died of a heart attack in 1982, and was succeeded by Fahd, the eldest of the powerful &quot;Sudairi Seven&quot;, so-called because they were all sons of Ibn Saud by his wife Hassa Al Sudairi. Fahd did away with the previous royal title of &quot;his Majesty&quot; and replaced it with the honorific &quot;Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques&quot;, in reference to the two Islamic holy sites in Mecca and Medina, in 1986.

A stroke in 1995 left Fahd largely incapacitated. His half-brother, Crown Prince Abdullah, gradually took over most of the king&#x27;s responsibilities until Fahd&#x27;s death in August 2005. Abdullah was proclaimed king on the day of Fahd&#x27;s death and promptly appointed his younger brother, Sultan bin Abdulaziz, the minister of defense and Fahd&#x27;s &quot;Second Deputy Prime Minister&quot;, as the new heir apparent. On 27 March 2009, Abdullah appointed Prince Nayef Interior Minister as his &quot;second deputy prime minister&quot; and Crown Prince on 27 October. Sultan died in October 2011 while Nayef died in Geneva, Switzerland on 15 June 2012. On 23 January 2015, Abdullah died after a prolonged illness, and his half-brother, Crown Prince Salman, was declared the new king.

Many princes and government officials were arrested in 2017 in an alleged anti corruption campaign by the king and crown prince. Then-United States President Donald Trump expressed support for the arrests.

==Political power==

The head of the House of Saud is the King of Saudi Arabia who serves as Head of State and monarch of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The king holds almost absolute political power. The king appoints ministers to his cabinet who supervise their respective ministries in his name. The key ministries of Defence, the Interior and Foreign Affairs are usually held by members of the Saud family, as are all of the thirteen regional governorships. Most portfolios, however, such as Finance, Labour, Information, Planning, Petroleum Affairs and Industry, have traditionally been given to commoners, often with junior Al Saud members serving as their deputies. House of Saud family members also hold many of the kingdom&#x27;s critical military and governmental departmental posts. Ultimate power in the kingdom has always rested upon the Al Saudis, though support from the Ulema, the merchant community, and the population at large has been key to the maintenance of the royal family&#x27;s political &quot;status quo&quot;.

Long-term political and government appointments have resulted in the creation of &quot;power fiefdoms&quot; for senior princes, such as those of King Faisal, who was foreign minister almost continuously from 1932 to 1975; King Abdullah, who had been commander of the National Guard since 1963 (until 2010, when he appointed his son to replace him); former Crown Prince Sultan, minister of defence and aviation from 1962 until his death in 2011; former Crown Prince Nayef who was the minister of interior from 1975 to his death in 2012; Prince Saud who had been minister of foreign affairs since 1975; and King Salman, who was minister of defense and aviation before he was crown prince and governor of the Riyadh Province from 1962 to 2011. The current minister of defense is Prince Mohammad bin Salman, the son of King Salman and crown prince.

Such terms of service have enabled senior princes to mingle their personal wealth with that of their respective domains. They have often appointed their own sons to senior positions within their own portfolios. Examples of these include Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah as assistant commander in the National Guard until 2010; Prince Khalid bin Sultan as assistant minister of defence until 2013; and Prince Mansour bin Mutaib as assistant minister for municipal and rural affairs until he replaced his father in 2009. In cases where portfolios have notably substantial budgets, appointments of younger, often full, brothers have been necessary, as deputies or vice ministers, ostensibly to share the wealth and the burdens of responsibility, of each fiefdom. Examples of these include Prince Abdul Rahman who was vice minister of defence and aviation under Prince Sultan; Prince Badr, deputy to King Abdullah in the National Guard; Prince Sattam, who was deputy governor of Riyadh during King Salman&#x27;s term; and Prince Ahmed, who held the deputy minister&#x27;s portfolio under Prince Nayef&#x27;s interior ministry.

Unlike Western royal families, the Saudi monarchy has not had a clearly defined order of succession. Historically, upon becoming king, the monarch has designated an heir apparent to the throne who serves as crown prince of the kingdom. Upon the king&#x27;s death, the crown prince becomes king, and during the king&#x27;s incapacitation the crown prince, likewise, assumes power as regent. Although other members of the Al Saudis hold political positions in the Saudi government, it is only the king and crown prince who legally constitute the political institutions.

The royal family is politically divided by factions based on clan loyalties, personal ambitions and ideological differences. The most powerful clan faction is known as the &#x27;Sudairi Seven&#x27;, comprising the late King Fahd and his full brothers and their descendants. Ideological divisions include issues over the speed and direction of reform, and whether the role of the ulema should be increased or reduced. There were divisions within the family over who should succeed to the throne after the accession or earlier death of Prince Sultan. When Prince Sultan died before ascending to the throne on 21 October 2011, King Abdullah appointed Prince Nayef as crown prince. The following year, Prince Nayef also died before ascending to the throne.

==Succession==

Succession has been from brother to brother since the death of the founder of modern Saudi Arabia. Abdulaziz was succeeded by his son Saud who was succeeded by his half-brother Faisal. Faisal was succeeded by his brother Khalid who, in turn, was succeeded by his half-brother Fahd. Fahd was succeeded by his half-brother Abdullah, and Abdullah by his half-brother Salman, the current King. Salman appointed his half-brother Muqrin as Crown Prince in January 2015 and removed him in April 2015. Even Abdulaziz&#x27;s youngest son was to turn 70 in 2015. Abdulaziz, in 1920, had said that the further succession would be from brother to brother, not from father to son.

King Salman ended the brother-to-brother succession and appointed his 56-year-old nephew Muhammad bin Nayef as crown prince in April 2015, thus making the next succession from uncle to nephew. At the same time, King Salman appointed his son, Mohammad bin Salman, as deputy crown prince, thus making the next succession from cousin to cousin, as Muhammad bin Salman is the cousin of Crown Prince Muhammad bin Nayef. However, in June 2017, Salman elevated Mohammad bin Salman to crown prince, following his decision to strip Muhammad bin Nayef of all positions, making his son heir apparent to the throne, and making the next succession from father to son, for the first time since 1953, when Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud succeeded his father, the founder of Saudi Arabia, Ibn Saud.

Amid international outcry over the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, members of the Saudi royal family were allegedly distressed over the prospect of the crown prince becoming the next king. It was reported that dozens of princes and members of the Al Saud family were interested in seeing Prince Ahmed become the next king instead. During his London tour, Prince Ahmed criticized the Saudi leadership. He was also one of the three members of the ruling family to oppose Mohammad bin Salman becoming the crown prince in 2017.

==Wealth==

In June 2015, &quot;Forbes&quot; listed businessman Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, a grandson of Abdulaziz, the first king of Saudi Arabia, as the 34th-richest man in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$22.6 billion.

As of 2020, the combined net worth of the entire royal family has been estimated at around US$100 billion, which makes them the richest royal family among all monarchs, as well as one of the wealthiest families in the world. Some estimates of the Royal Family&#x27;s wealth put the figure as high as $1.4 trillion, which includes holdings in Saudi Aramco.

==Opposition and controversy==

Due to its authoritarian and quasi-theocratic rule, the House of Saud has attracted much criticism during its rule of Saudi Arabia. There have been numerous incidents, including the Wahhabi Ikhwan militia uprising during the reign of Ibn Saud. Osama Bin Laden, a critic of the US, was also a critic of Saudi Arabia and was denaturalized in the mid 1990s.

On 20 November 1979, the Grand Mosque seizure saw the al-Masjid al-Haram in Mecca violently seized by a group of 500 heavily armed and provisioned Saudi dissidents led by Juhayman al-Otaybi and Abdullah al-Qahtani, consisting mostly of members of the former Ikhwan militia of Otaibah but also of other peninsular Arabs and a few Egyptians enrolled in Islamic studies at the Islamic University of Madinah. The Saudi royal family turned to the Ulema, who duly issued a &quot;fatwa&quot; permitting the storming of the holy sanctuary by Saudi forces, aided by French special ops units. According to Lawrence Wright, the GIGN commandos did first convert to Islam prior to the raid. Most of those responsible, including Al-Otaybi himself, were soon beheaded publicly in four cities of Saudi Arabia.

In January 2016, Saudi Arabia executed the prominent Shiite cleric Sheikh Nimr, who had called for pro-democracy demonstrations, along with forty-seven other Saudi Shia citizens sentenced by the Specialized Criminal Court on terrorism charges.

Since May 2017, in response to protests against the government, the predominantly Shia town of Al-Awamiyah has been put under full siege by the Saudi military. Residents are not allowed to enter or leave, and the Saudi military indiscriminately shells the neighborhoods with airstrikes, mortar fire along with snipers shooting residents. Dozens of Shia civilians were killed, including a three-year-old and a two-year-old child. The Saudi government claims it is fighting terrorists in al-Awamiyah.

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman kept his own mother away from his father for more than two years, fearing that she would stop the king from giving eventual power to him. Princess Fahda bint Falah Al Hithlain, third wife of King Salman, was said to be in America for medical treatment. However, according to American intelligence, this was refuted, stating that she was not in the country.

Some Royals have been criticised for various human rights violations, including the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, treatment of workers, the Saudi-led intervention in Bahrain and the Yemen war.

The Reuters news agency reported on 23 June 2020 that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had allegedly threatened and intimidated a former intelligence officer, Saad al-Jabri, along with his family of adult children, from returning to Saudi Arabia from exile in Canada. Al-Jabri was a long-time aide to the former crown prince, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who was ousted in 2017. Al-Jabri allegedly has access to documents containing information sensitive and pivotal for the crown prince&#x27;s leadership.

A group of intellectuals from Saudi Arabia, exiled in the US, the UK, and elsewhere, launched a political party in opposition to the royal family ruling the kingdom. The launch of the party was announced in September 2020 and was launched on the 2nd death anniversary of Jamal Khashoggi. The National Assembly Party (NAAS – people in Arabic) was launched with the aim of gathering the support of people, both inside and outside Saudi Arabia, against the ruling royals King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Madawi al-Rasheed, a scholar, is also the co-founder of NAAS. Other members of the party include scholar Abdullah al-Aoudh, comedian and vlogger Omar Abdulaziz, and activist Yahya Assiri. The party&#x27;s launch took place online from London as the Basic Law of Saudi Arabia prohibits the formation of political parties. Forming a political party is considered sedition, punishable with lengthy jail terms.

Some members of the royal family have ill-treated their employees, even while visiting other countries. For example, Princess Buni Al Saud, a niece of King Fahd, pushed the staff down the stairs. Another princess attacked her worker with the help of a bodyguard. A Saudi prince and his children abused their maids when they were in France.

<doc id="402560" wikidata="Q317421" url="?curid=402560" title="Abdul Rahman bin Faisal Al Saud (1850–1928)">
<text>Abdul Rahman bin Faisal Al Saud ( &quot;ʿAbd ar Raḥman bin Fayṣal Āl Saʿūd&quot;; 1850 – June 1928) was the last emir of Nejd, reigning from 1875 to 1876 and from 1889 to 1891. He was the youngest son of Emir Faisal bin Turki bin Abdullah and the father of Abdulaziz, the founder of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

==Early life==
Abdul Rahman was born in 1850. He was the fourth and youngest son of Faisal bin Turki bin Abdullah. He had three elder brothers: Abdullah, Saud and Mohammed. Saud was his full brother, and their mother was from the Ajman tribe. One of his sisters was Al Jawhara (died around 1930), who accompanied Abdul Rahman and his family in exile to Kuwait.

==Royal civil war==
After their father died in 1865, a struggle for power arose between Abdul Rahman&#x27;s brothers Saud and Abdullah. Abdul Rahman and his brother Muhammad tended to align themselves with Saud. In 1871, after Saud had taken the capital Riyadh, Abdul Rahman was sent to Baghdad to negotiate with the Ottoman Empire for help. Unsuccessful after two years, he tried to take Al Hasa in the east where Abdullah was now based, but this also failed, and Abdul Rahman eventually returned to Riyadh. After Saud&#x27;s death in 1875, Abdul Rahman was recognized as successor, but within a year Riyadh was taken by Abdullah and he was forced to abdicate.

In 1887 the sons of Saud bin Faisal, who kept up desultory hostilities against their uncles, managed to capture Abdullah. The Emir of Jabal Shammar, Muhammad bin Abdullah Al Rashid, was able to secure Abdullah&#x27;s release in exchange for Abdul Rahman. Abdullah was taken to Ha&#x27;il and a Rashidi emir appointed him to govern Riyadh. Abdul Rahman was able to rise in revolt in 1887 and take and defend Riyadh, but his attempts to expand control ended in disaster. When he became the undisputed leader of the House of Saud in 1889, he attacked and regained Riyadh. However, Emir Muhammad&#x27;s forces defeated the Saudis in the Battle of Mulayda, and Abdul Rahman and his family were forced to flee.

==Later years==

In 1891 the family fled to the desert of the Rub al-Khali to the southeast among the Al Murrah. Abdul Rahman recognised that they could not live by depending on the support from the tribes. Then, he and his family found refuge first with the Al Khalifa family in Bahrain and finally with the Al Sabah family in Kuwait. They were given permission by the Ottoman State to settle in Kuwait. While in Kuwait, Abdul Rahman was given a regular stipend by the Ottomans. He tried to make Wahhabist Islam widespread there and recreate the Saudi dynasty. Mubarak Al Sabah, a member of the Kuwaiti royal family and future ruler of Kuwait from 1896, developed a rapport with one of Abdul Rahman&#x27;s sons, Abdulaziz, who frequently visited Mubarak&#x27;s majlis. However, Abdul Rahman did not visit the majlis and did not endorse Abdulaziz&#x27;s closeness with Mubarak due to the latter&#x27;s interest in fine silk clothes, smoking, and women.

After defeat at the battle of Sarif in February 1900, Abdul Rahman gave up all ambitions to recover his patrimony. In the battle he was actively supported by Mubarak Al Sabah. In December 1901 Abdul Rahman met with the Russian officials when the Russian Varyag cruiser visited Kuwait.

Following the capture of Riyadh in January 1902 by his son Abdulaziz, in May Abdul Rahman sent a message to Lieutenant Colonel C. A. Kemball who was the British political resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire asking the British Government to make a treaty with his son, but his proposal was not taken into consideration by the British due to their tendency to remain neutral in central Arabian affairs as well as due to their uncertainty about Abdulaziz&#x27;s potential to consolidate his power in the region.

Abdul Rahman left Kuwait on 11 May and came to Riyadh where he was welcomed by Abdulaziz and a group of ulema. Abdulaziz asked the group to declare their loyalty to his father, but Abdul Rahman did not accept the offer stating that they should take an oath of loyalty to Abdulaziz. Then Abdul Rahman presented Abdulaziz a sword that had belonged to Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab.

Abdul Rahman&#x27;s attempts to secure the British protection were not productive. At the beginning of 1905 he wanted to visit Kuwait to meet with Captain S.G. Knox, the first British political representative there, but it was not permitted by the British.

Abdul Rahman was styled Imam and considered the spiritual leader of the country, while Abdulaziz held secular and military authority. Abdulaziz succeeded Abdul Rahman as Imam in 1928 when the latter died. The latter acted as the ceremonial leader of the newly built state. However, during the formation years he was also acting ruler when Abdulaziz was out of Riyadh and helped him to organize the forces. In 1905 he represented Abdulaziz in the negotiations with the Ottomans following the capture of Qasim. Another significant meeting headed by Abdul Rahman was an assembly of Najdi tribal and religious leaders in Riyadh on 4 July 1924.

==Personal life and death==
Abdul Rahman had ten sons with different wives: Faisal (1870–1890), Abdulaziz, Mohammed, Saad I, Saud (1890–1965), Abdullah, Musaid, Ahmed, Saad II (1924–1955) and Abdul Mohsen. Abdulaziz was his fourth child. Ahmed was a member of the family council during the reign of King Khalid. Abdul Rahman&#x27;s most famous daughter, Noura bint Abdul Rahman, was an important adviser to her brother King Abdulaziz. At least two of Abdul Rahman&#x27;s daughters, Noura and Mounira, married the grandsons of their paternal uncle, Saud bin Faisal.

One of Abdul Rahman&#x27;s spouses was Sara bint Ahmed bin Muhammad Al Sudairi who was the mother of Faisal, Noura, Abdulaziz, Bazza, Haya and Saad I. She died in 1910. Another of his spouses was Sara bint Jiluwi, daughter of his uncle Jiluwi bin Turki and the mother of Mohammed. Another spouse was Amsha bint Faraj Al Ajran Al Khalidi, the mother of Musaid.

Abdul Rahman died in June 1928 and was buried in Riyadh.

<text>ISO/IEC 5218 &quot;Information technology — Codes for the representation of human sexes&quot; is an international standard that defines a representation of human sexes through a language-neutral single-digit code. It can be used in information systems such as database applications.

The four codes specified in ISO/IEC 5218 are:
* 0 = Not known;
* 1 = Male;
* 2 = Female;
* 9 = Not applicable.

The standard specifies that its use may be referred to by the designator &quot;SEX&quot;.

The standard explicitly states that no significance is to be placed on the encoding of &quot;male&quot; as 1 and &quot;female&quot; as 2; the encoding merely reflects existing practice in the countries that initiated this standard. The standard also explains that it &quot;meets the requirements of most applications that need to code human sexes. It does not provide codes for sexes that may be required in specific medical and scientific applications or in applications that need to code sex information other than for human beings.&quot; Since its 2022 revision, the standard also states that its scope does not cover human gender identities and therefore does not provide codes for those.

ISO/IEC 5218 was created by ISO&#x27;s &quot;Data Management and Interchange&quot; Technical Committee, proposed in November 1976, and updated in June 2022. The standard is currently maintained by 
the ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee (ISO/IEC JTC 1) subcommittee on Data management and interchange (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 32).
This standard is used in several national identification numbers. For example, the first digit of the French INSEE number and the first digit of the Republic of China National Identification Card (Chinese: 中華民國國民身分證) are based on ISO/IEC 5218 values.

<text>7.1 People Pile was a loose pro-democracy political group in Hong Kong named after the mass protest on 1 July 2003. It was established on 10 August 2003. The group is formed by a group of young people mainly under their 30s. Its aim is to push ahead for democracy in Hong Kong by continuing the spirit of &quot;people&#x27;s power&quot; in the 1 July protests.

Their platform includes a call for universal suffrage for the Chief Executive in 2007 and Legislative Council in 2008, opposing legislation to implement Article 23 of the Basic Law, Hong Kong&#x27;s mini-constitution, and demanding the Chief Executive, Tung Chee-hwa, to step down. The platform of the group also included the fight for full-fledged democracy, minority rights such as LGBT rights, gender equality, and the development of civil society.

The group filed three candidates in the 2003 District Council elections. All of them were defeated.

<text>Cristian Sáinz Castro (born 8 December 1974) is a Mexican pop singer. He is the son of actors Verónica Castro and Manuel &quot;El Loco&quot; Valdés, and nephew of actors Ramón Valdés (known for playing Don Ramón in &quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot;) and Germán &quot;Tin-Tan&quot; Valdés. Castro has sold over 12 million copies, making him one of the best-selling Latin music artists of all-time.

Juan Gabriel described Castro as &quot;the man with the most faculties to sing in Mexico&quot;.

== Biography ==

Born in Mexico City, he is the son of actress and singer Verónica Castro and comedian Manuel &quot;El Loco&quot; Valdés. Castro also has a younger brother named Michelle Sáinz Castro. His uncle is José Alberto Castro, and his aunt is Beatriz Castro; both are producers. As a baby, he made his acting debut with his aunt in the telenovela named &quot;El derecho de nacer&quot;. Soon after, he appeared on a television commercial with her and on the Mexican version of the musical &quot;Mame&quot;, starring Silvia Pinal.

Castro is one of the best selling Latin artists and has worked with Latin producers Kike Santander, Rudy Pérez, and Richard Daniel Roman. In 1984, Castro made his first appearance on TV as a singer in the Televisa&#x27;s child contest &quot;Juguemos a Cantar&quot;, but he did not qualify for the finals because of his young age.

=== 1992–1996: Fonovisa years ===
Castro began his professional singing career in 1992 with the release of &quot;Agua Nueva&quot; at the age of 18. This album was a huge success in Mexico and earned him a grammy nomination for Best Latin Album. After appearing in several telenovelas and recording some albums as a teenager, he began his &quot;internationalization&quot; in 1993, starting with concerts in Puerto Rico. Castro dedicated a song to that country in his second album, &quot;Un Segundo En El Tiempo&quot;, titled &quot;Puerto Rico&quot; as a way of thanking the Puerto Rican public for supporting his career. He modified his singing from the deep voice he employed in &quot;Agua Nueva&quot; to a softer one. His song &quot;Nunca Voy a Olvidarte&quot; (&quot;I Will Never Forget You&quot;) became his first number-one hit on the Hot Latin Tracks chart in 1993 and helped start his career. He became an international teen idol and sex symbol after he began touring. He received a nomination for Pop New Artist of the Year at the Lo Nuestro Awards of 1993.

In 1994, Cristian released &quot;El Camino del Alma&quot;. The album hit &quot;Mañana&quot; (&quot;Tomorrow&quot;) was composed by Mexican singer Juan Gabriel (&quot;Mañana, Mañana&quot;). In 1995, he was part of the compilation album &quot;Boleros: Por Amor y Desamor&quot; written and produced by Jorge Avendaño, recording &quot;Vuélveme a Querer&quot;, which hit No. 2 on the Hot Latin Tracks (held off by Enrique Iglesias&#x27; debut single Si Tú Te Vas). In 1996, Cristian released &quot;El Deseo De Oir Tu Voz&quot; (&quot;The Wish to Hear Your Voice&quot;) which featured hits such as &quot;Morelia&quot;, &quot;Amor&quot;, &quot;Amarte a Ti&quot;, and the title track. At the 9th Lo Nuestro Awards, Castro received a nomination for Male Pop Artist of the Year. Cristian has also done opening themes for telenovelas such as &quot;Morelia&quot; (1994), &quot;Ángela&quot; (1998) and &quot;Mujer De Madera&quot; (&quot;Woman of Wood&quot;) (2004).

=== 1997–2004: BMG years ===

In 1997, Castro left Fonovisa and signed with BMG, which released &quot;Lo Mejor De Mi&quot;. Pianist Raúl Di Blasio played on &quot;Después De Tí...¿Qué?&quot; (&quot;After You...What?&quot;). The album was nominated Best Latin Pop Album of the Year. Following the album&#x27;s success, Castro sang duets with Olga Tañón, Grupo Límite, and José Alfredo Jiménez. In 1999 he released &quot;Mi Vida Sin Tu Amor&quot;, which had four singles in the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Tracks chart. (&quot;Alguna Vez&quot; No. 2, &quot;Por Amarte Asi&quot; No. 3, &quot;Mi Vida Sin Tu Amor&quot; No. 3, and &quot;Volver a Amar&quot; No. 4). In 2001, he released &quot;Azul&quot;, which won Best Latin Pop Album of the Year. In 2002, he sang a duet with Irish boy band Westlife in the song &quot;Flying Without Wings&quot;. In 2005, he released &quot;Galltio Feliz&quot;, a collection of his childhood songs, &quot;Nunca Voy A Olvidarte...Los Exitos&quot;, a greatest hits album featuring both Fonovisa and BMG songs.

=== 2005–2012: Universal Music Latino years ===
In 2005, Castro released &quot;Días Felices&quot; with &quot;Amor Eterno&quot; and &quot;Sin Tu Amor&quot; as the album hit under the Universal Music Latino label. In 2006, Castro contributed to a tribute to Víctor Yturbe &quot;El Piruli&quot; in which he sang &quot;Mil Besos&quot;. On 26 June 2007, he released his first mariachi album, &quot;El Indomable&quot;, which was produced by Vicente Fernández, and released the single &quot;Tu Retirada&quot;.

Castro announced that the divorce with Valeria led him to bankruptcy. The album &quot;El culpable soy yo&quot; was released on 28 April 2009. He sang at the Latin Grammy Celebra José José ceremony. On 28 September 2010, he released the single &quot;La Nave del Olvido&quot; and &quot;Amor, Amor&quot; as part of &quot;Viva el Príncipe&quot;, his tribute album to José José. In 2011, a follow-up to &quot;Viva el príncipe&quot; was recorded under the title &quot;Mi Amigo El Príncipe&quot;.

=== 2012–present: &quot;Primera Fila&quot; and Sony Music ===

<doc id="402577" wikidata="Q667229" url="?curid=402577" title="Champagne socialist">
<text>Champagne socialist is a political term commonly used in the United Kingdom. It is a popular epithet that implies a degree of hypocrisy, and it is closely related to the concept of the liberal elite. The phrase is used to describe self-identified anarchists, communists, and socialists whose luxurious lifestyles, metonymically including consumption of champagne, are ostensibly in conflict with their political beliefs.

==United Kingdom==
The term has been used by left-wing commentators to criticise centrist views. Some traditional left-wingers regard the first Labour Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald as a &quot;champagne socialist&quot; who betrayed the Labour movement. MacDonald&#x27;s lavish lifestyle and his mingling with high society is supposed to have been a corrupting influence that led to the end of the Labour Government in 1931 and the eventual formation of the National Government. More recently, the epithet has been levelled at supporters of the New Labour movement which brought Tony Blair to power in 1997.

In an article about Oscar Wilde&#x27;s 1891 essay &quot;The Soul of Man under Socialism&quot;, political commentator Will Self expressed the view that Wilde could be considered an early champagne socialist because of his aesthetic lifestyle and socialist leanings.

The writer and Labour supporter John Mortimer, when accused of being a champagne socialist, said that he preferred to be thought of as &quot;more a Bollinger Bolshevik&quot;.

In the fourth series of the British television comedy &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;, Saffron is offered a job with New Labour. While she is at pains to avoid being seen as a champagne socialist, her grandmother considers the family to be &quot;Bolly Bolsheviks&quot;.

The label has also been applied to the Labour politician Geoffrey Robinson MP on account of his large personal fortune. Singer Charlotte Church has described herself as a &quot;prosecco socialist&quot;, referring to the increasing popularity and lower price range of non-champagne sparkling wines such as prosecco and cava.

In the UK, the term is often used by critics to disparage people with a leftwing political view. This argument claims that the champagne socialist espouses leftist views while enjoying a luxurious lifestyle; one example might include Labour Party supporters who stereotypically live in Inner London and consume highbrow media.

This usage of the term has been criticised by Caitlin Moran as a fallacious argument, because she claims it assumes that only those who are poor can express an opinion about social inequality.

==Australia and New Zealand==
In Australia and New Zealand, the variant &quot;Chardonnay socialist&quot; was used, as Chardonnay was seen as a drink of affluent people. By the late 1990s, chardonnay had become more readily available and generally consumed in Australia; today it is the most dominant white wine variety produced in the country. As a result, the drink&#x27;s association with elitism has faded.

Staunch Australian right-wingers also used the term to deride those who supported what they considered &quot;middle-class welfare&quot;—government funding for the arts, free tertiary education, and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

==United States==
&quot;Current Affairs&quot; ran a lighthearted article featuring a political cartoon of guests at a Marxist gathering dressed in fancy attire and sipping on champagne. The central argument was that conspicuous consumption was not inherently antithetical to leftist values so long as luxuries were shared equally. As the magazine put it, &quot;When we say let them eat cake, we are serious: there must be cake, it must be good cake, and it must be had by all. The reason Marie Antoinette needed beheading was not that she wished cake on the poor, but that she never actually gave them any.&quot;

The term appears in &quot;Blind Alleys&quot;, a 1906 work of fiction by the American author George Cary Eggleston which distinguishes the &quot;beer socialist&quot; who &quot;wants everybody to come down to his low standards of living&quot; and the &quot;champagne socialist&quot; who &quot;wants everybody to be equal on the higher plane that suits him, utterly ignoring the fact that there is not enough champagne, green turtle and truffles to go round&quot;.

A 2021 article in the libertarian magazine &quot;Reason&quot; written by Jason Brennan and Christopher Freiman derided Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and political commentator Hasan Piker as so-called &quot;champagne socialists.&quot; In the article, Brennan and Freiman chide these &quot;socialist figureheads&quot; to &quot;open their wallets before they open their mouths&quot; on the basis that each had supposedly donated little of their personal wealth to causes they support, but had instead called for increased taxes. In the case of Sanders and Piker, Brennan and Freiman criticize their supposedly excessive living arrangements, while Warren is reprehended for donating only a small portion of her net worth to causes she advocates for.

== Other related terms ==
The term is broadly similar to the American terms &quot;limousine liberal&quot;, &quot;Learjet liberal&quot;, or &quot;Hollywood liberal&quot;, and to idioms in other languages such as the Spanish &quot;Izquierda caviar&quot;, The Portuguese &quot;Esquerda Caviar&quot;, the French &quot;Gauche caviar&quot;, the German &quot;Salonsozialist&quot;, the Italian &quot;Radical chic&quot;, the Swedish &quot;Rödvinsvänster&quot;, and Polish &quot;kawiorowa lewica&quot;. In Turkey, &quot;Cihangir leftist&quot; (Turkish: &quot;Cihangir solcusu&quot;) is commonly used, since Cihangir is a high-income neighborhood of Beyoğlu, Istanbul although &quot;champagne socialist&quot; can be used as well. Other related terms include &quot;Hampstead liberal&quot;, &quot;Gucci socialist&quot;, &quot;Gucci communist&quot;, &quot;Neiman Marxist&quot;, &quot;cashmere communist&quot;, and in Ireland, &quot;smoked salmon socialist&quot;.

<doc id="402579" wikidata="Q307187" url="?curid=402579" title="Abdulaziz bin Muhammad Al Saud">
<text>Abdulaziz bin Muhammad Al Saud ( &quot;ʿAbd al ʿAzīz bin Muḥammad Āl Suʿūd&quot;; 1720–1803) was the second ruler of the Emirate of Diriyah. He was the eldest son of Muhammad bin Saud and the son-in-law of Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab. Abdulaziz ruled the Emirate from 1765 until 1803. He was nicknamed by his people as the savior of his time (&quot;mahdi zamanihi&quot; in Arabic) due to his fearless activities.

==Early life==
Abdulaziz was born in 1720 and was the eldest son of Muhammad bin Saud. He was educated by Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab and became a Wahhabi scholar.

Long before the death of his father Abdulaziz was announced the next ruler of the state at the request of Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab. From 1750 Abdulaziz was the chief military commander of the Emirate due to his father&#x27;s old age. In 1763 he led a military campaign of the Emirate attacking the regions under the rule of the Bani Khalid Emirate. It was the first military attack of the Emirate outside the Nejd. These attacks were followed by those against the Sudair and Jalajil tribes who did not join the religious movement of Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab. Next Abdulaziz raided the Ajman tribe who were the natives of the Najran region. In the latter attack the forces of Abdulaziz were defeated losing nearly one thousand men.

==Reign==
The reign of Abdulaziz bin Muhammad began in 1765 when his father died. Abdulaziz&#x27;s Bay&#x27;ah (Arabic: Pledge of allegiance) ceremony was supervised by Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab. Although his father was titled as Emir, Abdulaziz was given the titles of both Emir and Imam. However, the latter title was not granted immediately after his succession to the throne, but it was given later. Imam as a title was a reflection of Abdulaziz&#x27;s religious education by Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab and his deeply religious personality. His younger brother, Abdullah, unsuccessfully challenged the rule of Abdulaziz. 

Abdulaziz&#x27;s father, Muhammad bin Saud, initiated attacks against the ruler of Riyadh, Dahham bin Dawwas, in 1747. However, following the battles for nearly 25 years only in 1773 Riyadh was captured by Abdulaziz and became part of the Emirate. Their military success and orthodox approach to religion won them great support in the area. Their standing was also boosted by Abdulaziz&#x27;s practice of holding open meetings where tribal elders could meet with him, allowing access to their ruler. During his reign Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab was his major advisor and dealt with all major activities, including treasury. However, following the capture of Riyadh Abdulaziz bin Muhammad himself began to control the budget of the state due to the significant increase in revenues. From 1789 Abdulaziz&#x27;s supremacy was recognised by all Najdi people. As early as 1790 Abdulaziz&#x27;s forces started their attacks in the region near the Euphrates in southern Iraq. The region was the settlement of the Shammar tribe, originally from Najd, and they were defeated two times in 1791. Muslat bin Mutlaq Al Jarba, son of the tribal leader Mutlaq bin Muhammad, killed in the battle which led to the migration of the tribe to southern Mesopotamia. 

The expansion continued with the capture of Qatif in 1794 and Hasa in 1795 where Shiites were dominant. Abdulaziz&#x27;s attacks against Hasa which had been under the rule of Banu Khalid began in 1792. From 1797 the relations between Abdulaziz and the Ottoman authorities both in Baghdad and in Mecca became tense.

In 1802 Hejaz, namely Taif and Khurma, was captured, and the people, particularly men, living there were slaughtered. In Taif Abdulaziz&#x27;s forces took women and children as slaves. They also demolished the heterodox texts and innovative household equipment such as mirrors and window frames and robbed the wealth of the local people. Zubayr and other settlements in the region witnessed similar violence, too. 

In 1802 Bahrain was invaded and captured by the ruler of Muscat. Abdulaziz bin Muhammad recaptured it in addition to Qatar and appointed there a governor, Abdullah bin Ufaysan, there. The rulers of Bahrain, Abdullah and Salman, together with their families were sent to Diriyah where they were all detained. Therefore, the Wahhabi influence also extended to Qatar and Bahrain. However, due to the Ottoman attacks in Hejaz Abdulaziz bin Muhammad did not manage to fully consolidate his power in Bahrain and had to reduce his forces there which allowed the Al Khalifa to reestablish their rule. Abdulaziz&#x27;s governor, Abdullah bin Ufaysan, was detained by the Al Khalifa. In 1803 Mecca was taken by Abdulaziz&#x27;s forces, and the religious figures in the city declared their alliance to Wahhabis. The attacks of the Saudi forces reached Syria, Iraq and Yemen where Abdulaziz managed to establish his authority.

==Sack of Karbala==

In 1802 Abdulaziz bin Muhammad&#x27;s forces led by his heir and son Saud attacked Karbala and Najaf in Iraq. Unlike other attacks the goal of Saudi forces was not to rule or control the region. They massacred thousands of the Shia population, stole enough precious loot to load 4,000 camels, and destroyed the dome over the shrine of Imam Hussain. they destroyed it because according to the hadith of Prophet Muhammad We cannot built anything over graves. They also stole the gold, jewels, and rare minerals in the shrine. This incident also had another and much more significant effect: it added a sectarian nuance to the Sunni-Shia divide in the Muslim world. 

The observations of Lieutenant Francis Warden, a British military official, about the attack are as follows: 

They pillaged the whole of it [Karbala], and plundered the Tomb of Hussein...slaying in the course of the day, with circumstances of peculiar cruelty, above five thousand of the inhabitants...

==Personal life and death==
Abdulaziz married to the daughter of Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab and the daughter of Uthman bin Mu&#x27;ammar, the ruler of Uyayna. He had four sons: Saud, Abdul Rahman, Abdullah and Umar. Of them Saud was born through Abdulaziz&#x27;s marriage to the daughter of Uthman bin Mu&#x27;ammar.

Abdulaziz was much more adhered to the Wahhabi cause and more aggressive than his father. However, like his father he dressed in a plain way, and his armaments were not decorated unlike those of the Mamluk and Ottoman rulers.

Shortly after his capture of Mecca Abdulaziz returned to Diriyah where he was assassinated by a Persian man who was a darwish when Abdulaziz was leading Asr Salat in the mosque of Turaif in November 1803. The motive of the assassin was to take revenge against him due to the killing of his sons in the Karbala attack. The British newspaper &quot;London Times&quot; dated 12 March 1804 reported the following about the assassination:

Abdulaziz ibn Muhammad was assassinated by Ibadgi Osman, a Mussulman of the sect of Ali. He had profaned the tomb of Ali, and thus excited the fury of the disciples of that prophet. Ibadgi Osman resolved to avenge the ashes of Ali. He crossed the desert of Arabia on a dromedary, entered the tent of Abdulaziz while he was at prayers, and plunged a cangiar into his breast crying, &quot;Let this avenge the tomb of Ali, for thy profanations.&quot; The brother of Abdulaziz, hearing the noise, ran into the tent, where he found his brother bathed in his blood, and the assassin, who squatted himself down, saying his prayers, and calmly awaiting death. He attacked him; but Ibadgi Osman, who was the strongest of the two, got up and killed his assailant with the same cangiar which was still stained with the blood of his brother. The soldiers then entered, and cut the assassin in pieces with their sabers.

Abdulaziz was succeeded by his eldest son, Saud.

==Writings==
A student of his father-in-law, Abdul Wahab, Abdulaziz followed his footsteps in writing on tawhid and the avoidance of grave-worshiping and other such related matters, his epistles being praised by Al-Shawkani, a scholar.

<doc id="402582" wikidata="Q3106650" url="?curid=402582" title="Gimar Montaz Mautino">
<text>Gimar Montaz Mautino (GMM) is a French manufacturer that was created by the merger of Gimar (founded in 5. June 1980 by Jean-Claude Giraud and Dominique Marceau, two former executives at Weber) and Montaz-Mautino (founded in 1952 by Pierre Montaz and Victor Mautino). They make aerial lifts (mostly two-seat chairlifts) and surface ski lifts. They are headquartered in Échirolles France, near Grenoble. Originally known as Montaz-Mautino, they were one of the most successful ski lift companies in the 1970s and 1980s, primarily constructing two and three-seat chairlifts.

The current form of the company dates back to 1990, when the Gimar company, then headed by industrialist Bernard Drevet, obtained the Montaz-Mautino company after its judicial liquidation by the judgment of Grenoble&#x27;s commercial court in December 1989.

The Montaz-Mautino company was founded 40 years earlier by Pierre Montaz and Victor Mautino in the commune of Fontaine, Isère. They ceased their activities within the company between 1986 and 1987. Its activities covered various fields such as ski lifts, fixed-grip chairlifts, detachable-grip chairlifts, gondolas, and cable cars. In particular, in 1987 it built the Brévent cable car in Chamonix-Mont-Blanc.

The Gimar company was created by Messrs Giraud and Marceau at the end of the 1970s. Activities (until 1988) were generally focused on the production of industrial cable transport devices, with some attempts in the tourist sector. The purchase of the company by Bernard Drevet in 1988 gave it new life.

Since 1994, the company is certified according to the standard NF EN ISO 9001.

The company was experiencing difficulties due to site hazards in India and was bought in 1994 by Didier Serre, a Lyon businessman. He appointed the head of GMM François Montes, former Secretary-General of Lafuma, to conduct a responsible policy. After these turbulent times, the manufacturer refocused on making chairlifts and ski lifts, its historic know-how, and after the sales service of the previous-Montaz Mautino and Gimar installation. It is currently managed by Gilles Kraan.

== Products ==
GMM mainly builds four-seater fixed-attachment chairlifts and roller or pole-mounted ski-lifts and provides after-sales service on old products designed by the two former companies Montaz-Mautino and Gimar. Although it is not as well known as other major aerial lift manufacturers (Doppelmayr, Leitner, and Poma), GMM has manufactured more than 2,500 aerial lifts on 5 continents, including nearly 780 in France. The company strives to limit the ecological footprint of its ski lifts by using demountable structures and recycled elements.

The current range of GMM chairlifts is based on 7+ stations and mini 7 of motor type or motor-voltage compacts (on massive concrete). 7+ The first copy was made in 1998 at the Alpe d&#x27;Huez: this is the Lievre Blanc chairlift.

GMM retains also to catalog a range of lifts with poles (fixed and detachable). Although they are now less popular, they are historical know-how of the company since as Montaz Mautino, then as GMM, the manufacturer has made the territory more than 600 slope-back of its kind since the 1950s, the company has modernized the same range with the design of 4 new types of stations S whose first units were delivered in 2005.

However, the manufacturer now offers lifts retractors. GMM has developed for this purpose a so-called range E (as winders) with 3 different driving-voltage terminals; the lighter is sized to fit devices for beginners, the heart of the product target. The first aircraft of this range is the lift of Daffodils, installed in 2010 to Parlour in the Fore (Massif Central).

Retractors are models that have the particularity of being magnetic braking plates. Until 2015, they came from the manufacturer Loipolder Seilbahn Technik. Since 2016, GMM has its reel, developed by the internal design department.

Best seen in the resort of Puy-Saint-Vincent as well as gondolas and surface lifts (similar in design to POMA surface lifts). Though in recent years, due to the rapid growth of rivals POMA and Leitner in France, Montaz Mautino lifts are being replaced with faster and higher capacity lifts from its rivals. GMM still constructs surface lifts and a completely new design of 4 person chairlift.

<doc id="402585" wikidata="Q1238247" url="?curid=402585" title="Mohammad-Reza Shajarian">
<text>Mohammad-Reza Shajarian (; , 23 September 1940 – 8 October 2020) was an Iranian singer and master (&quot;Ostad&quot;) of Persian traditional music. He was also known for his skills in Persian calligraphy and humanitarian activities. Shajarian started his singing career in 1959 at Radio Khorasan, rising to prominence in the 1960s with his distinct singing style.

Shajarian&#x27;s main teachers were Ahmad Ebadi, Esmaeil Mehrtash, Abdollah Davami, and Nour-Ali Boroumand. He also learned the vocal styles of singers from previous generations, including Reza Gholi Mirza Zelli, Fariborz Manouchehri, Ghamar Molouk Vaziri, Eghbal Azar and Taj Isfahani. He cited legendary Persian tar soloist Jalil Shahnaz as highly influential to his development, indicating that he often tried to mimic Shahnaz&#x27;s playing style in his singing.

Shajarian collaborated with musicians such as Parviz Meshkatian, Mohammad Reza Lotfi, Hossein Alizadeh, Faramarz Payvar, Dariush Pirniakan, and Sohrab Pournazeri. He was recognized as a skilled singer in the challenging traditional Dastgah style. His works also cover some songs of Iranian ethnic music, including Mazandarani music, Azeri music, Kurdish music and Lur music.

Shajarian&#x27;s critics believe that his fame resulted from the ban on all other singers in 1979. In fact, right before 1979 there was an abundance of excellent singers like Iraj, Golpa, Hayedeh, whom Shajarian was far from being able to compete with due to lack of talent. His concerts before 1979 couldn&#x27;t attract people at all due to the very strong competitors.

UNESCO in France presented Shajarian with the Picasso Award in 1999 and with the UNESCO Mozart Medal in 2006. In 2017, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; cited him as the &quot;Greatest living maestro of Persian classical music&quot;. After coming out in support of the Iranian Green Movement and criticizing the Iranian government, he was banned from holding concerts and releasing music.

==Early life==

Mohammad-Reza Shajarian was born on 23 September 1940 in Mashhad, Iran. His father, Mehdi, was a Quran qari, as was his grandfather Ali Akbar. His mother was Afsar Shahverdiani, who died in 2007.

He was the oldest of five siblings, and studied singing at the age of five under the supervision of his father by recitation of the Quran.

==Music career==
===Early work===

At the age of 12, he began studying the Persian classical repertoire known as the &quot;Radif&quot; without his father&#x27;s consent as studying and performing music was against his father&#x27;s religious beliefs. This may have been the reason why he chose the stage name &quot;Siavash Bidakani&quot; in his early career as a singer, which did not last long, and soon he used his real name again. Shajarian started his singing career in 1959 at Radio Khorasan, rising to prominence in the 1960s with his distinct style of singing. Since then his career has included teaching at Tehran University&#x27;s Department of Fine Arts, working at National Radio and television, researching Persian/Iranian music, and making numerous recordings.

===Music bands===
Shajarian was not always in music groups, but he did the vocals for the Masters of Persian Music with his son Homayoun Shajarian, as well as two other &quot;ostads&quot;, Kayhan Kalhor and Hossein Alizadeh. He also performed with his daughter Mojgan Shajarian.

In 2008, he toured the world with the Ava Ensemble, composed of his son Homayoun (tombak and vocals), Hossein Behroozinia (barbat), Majid Derakhshani (tar), Hossain Rezaeenia (daf), and Saeed Farajpouri (kamanche).

In 2012, he toured with the Shahnaz Ensemble with his daughter Mojgan and other band members. The ensemble is named after master tar musician Jalil Shahnaz, with a percentage of the proceeds going towards supporting his health care needs.

===Masters and students===
Shajarian studied with Esmaeil Mehrtash, Ahmad Ebadi and Nour-Ali Boroumand.

He learned the vocal styles of previous singers such as Hossein Taherzadeh, Reza Gholi Mirza Zelli, Qamar-ol-Moluk Vaziri, Eghbal Azar, and Taj Isfahani.

He started playing the santour under the instruction of Jalal Akhbari to understand better and perform the traditional repertoire. In 1971, he was introduced to Faramarz Payvar and took santour lessons with him. Shajarian also learned Abolhasan Saba&#x27;s vocal Radif from Payvar.

He also studied under the guidance of master Abdollah Davami, from whom he learned many early Persian songs. Davami also passed on to Shajarian his interpretation of the Radif.

Shajarian taught many students in the field of singing, some of whom are:
* Iraj Bastami
* Ali Jahandar
* Shahram Nazeri
* Hesameddin Seraj
* Mozaffar Shafei
* Qasem Rafati
* Mohammad Esfahani
* Homayoun Shajarian
* Ali Rostamian
* Mohsen Keramati
* Hamid Reza Noorbakhsh
* Sina Sarlak
* Mojtaba Asgari

==Politics==

Shajarian&#x27;s Bidaad album was recorded after a three-year hiatus from a commercial recording. The album&#x27;s lyrics speak of a wonderful place having been reduced to shambles and bloodshed, in which he sings in sadness, &quot;what happened?&quot;. When giving a lecture at California State University, Sacramento on 2 March 2012, he was asked what the lyrics of this song meant. His response made it clear that he chose these lyrics based on what happened to the Iranian regime after the revolution – a once beautiful country being reduced to shambles. This is widely considered his first commercial recording meant to represent the voice of an oppressed people in Iran.

Shajarian has indicated support for Iranians protesting against the 12 June 2009 Iranian presidential election results. When Iran&#x27;s president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad referred to the protesters as &quot;dust and trash&quot;, Shajarian told a BBC Persian channel telephone interviewer that he (Shajarian) considered himself the voice of dust and trash: &quot;It is the voice of dust and trash, and it will always remain the voice of dust and trash.&quot; He also asked IRIB (Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting) to stop broadcasting his songs. He mentioned that his famous song &quot;Iran, Ey Saraye Omid&quot; (Iran, the land of Hope), has no relation with the current situation of his country.

After Shajarian criticized the government public and sided with the Green Movement protesters, the state broadcaster IRIB banned his work of art, which used to be a fixture of public broadcasting until then. Even against Shajarian&#x27;s will, the state TV and radio stations stopped airing &quot;Rabbana&quot;, a prayer sung during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan heralding the moment of fast-breaking. The recital had been broadcast regularly every Ramadan since the 1979 revolution but swept from public view after the legendary singer fell out of favor with the establishment. A Shajarian fan in Tehran told The Guardian Ramadan without Rabbana was like Christmas without Christmas carol. In the elections of 2013 and 2017, Hassan Rouhani criticized the ban on broadcasting Shajarian&#x27;s works, including &quot;Rabbana&quot;, and demanded that Shajarian&#x27;s works be broadcast on television and radio.

In an interview in 2016, Shajarian stated that &quot;my criticism was a mistake of one person, I am not against the republic system. Our music has always been attacked or criticized by a class of religious people. Of course, some of the deviant music can be like this. But the nature of music is not deviant. I myself am fundamentally opposed to deviant music. We accept the clergy and religion&quot;.

Lyrics of his song &quot;Language of Fire,&quot; issued in September 2009, — &quot;Lay down your gun, Come, sit down, talk, hear. Perhaps the light of humanity will get through to your heart too&quot; —
are thought by some observers to speak &quot;directly to the plainclothes Basiji militiamen and security forces&quot; who had beaten protesters during recent unrest.

In an interview with Hamid Reza Nourbakhsh in 2016, Shajarian said that he was not against the Islamic Republic and that his protest was only against one person (Mahmoud Ahmadinejad). &quot;We say you have no right to insult the people. This is not a fall with the whole system.&quot;

Shajarian continues: &quot;Several years ago, we had a concert in Stockholm with the Aref group, led by the living memory of Parviz Meshkatian. As soon as we were present on the group stage, they started chanting. They chanted against the Islamic Republic. The children in the group were all upset. When they chanted, we just sat and listened, and they chanted. They saw that we were not doing anything. Some ordinary people who came also shook hands with us to start our work. I also told Parviz to perform the last ballad and then go. We had two parts of the program, in each of which there were five ballads, and we only performed the last ballad, and we got up and went out, and the children brought their instruments. I told the person announcing the program to say behind the microphone. In honor of those who bought tickets and came from far and near, we performed this ballad. And get your money back and go. Later it turned out that the organizer was one of them, so I came backstage and told him as much as I could.

==Later life, death and legacy==

While in exile, Shajarian privately sat for a series of rare interviews that form the basis of a feature-length documentary entitled &quot;The Voice of Dust and Ash&quot;. In a leaked clip of the documentary, Shajarian can be heard saying, &quot;I am Mohammad Reza Shajarian, son of Iran. My voice is part of Iran&#x27;s ancient culture, to remind the people of the world that we have had a culture of love, peace and friendship.&quot; The clip went viral on social media twice, once in 2016 and again upon Shajarian&#x27;s death in 2020. Shot in California and Iran, the interviews occurred shortly before he announced his cancer diagnosis and the rapid deterioration of his health. They now constitute his last public testament.

In March 2016, Shajarian revealed that he had had kidney cancer for the past fifteen years. He appeared with shaved hair in his Nowrouz congratulation video, published on his YouTube account. Bahram Beyzai composed a poem after announcement of Shajarian&#x27;s illness and described it as a sad day in happy days of Nowruz.

Shajarian transferred to hospital on 27 January 2020 and had a successful surgery. He was released from hospital on 25 August but was hospitalized again on 5 October.
Shajarian died on 8 October 2020 at the age of 80 at intensive care unit of Jam Hospital in Tehran. The cause of his death was not immediately made public. A private religious ceremony was held following day at Behesht-e Zahra in Tehran, before his body being transferred to Mashhad. He was buried at the Tomb of Ferdowsi in Tus, Mashhad, on 10 October.

==Personal life==
In 1962, Shajarian married teacher Farkhondeh Golafshan when he was 21 years old. They had one son Homayoun and three daughters, Farzaneh (a.k.a. Raheleh), Mojgan and Afsaneh. Afsaneh married Parviz Meshkatian. Shajarian and Golafshan divorced in 1993.

His second marriage was to Katayoun Khansari, sister of his son&#x27;s wife, in 1995. The couple had one son, Ryan who was born in 1997 in Vancouver, Canada.

<doc id="402587" wikidata="Q112128" url="?curid=402587" title="Husayn ibn Ali">
<text>Husayn ibn Ali (; 11 January 626 – 10 October 680) was a social, political and religious leader. The grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and a son of Ali ibn Abi Talib and Muhammad&#x27;s daughter Fatima, as well as a younger brother of Hasan ibn Ali, Husayn is regarded as the third Imam (leader) in Shia Islam after his brother, Hasan, and before his son, Ali al-Sajjad. Being the grandson of the prophet, he is also a prominent member of the Ahl al-Bayt. He is also considered to be a member of the Ahl al-Kisa, and a participant in the event of the mubahala. Muhammad described him and his brother, Hasan, as the leaders of the youth of Paradise.

During the caliphate of Ali, Husayn accompanied him in wars. After the assassination of Ali, he obeyed his brother in recognizing the Hasan–Mu&#x27;awiya treaty, despite it being suggested to do otherwise. In the nine-year period between Hasan&#x27;s abdication in AH 41 (660 CE) and his death in AH 49 or 50 (669 or 670 CE), Hasan and Husayn retreated to Medina, trying to keep aloof from political involvement for or against Mu&#x27;awiya. After the death of Hasan, when Iraqis turned to Husayn, concerning an uprising, Husayn instructed them to wait as long as Mu&#x27;awiya was alive due to Hasan&#x27;s peace treaty with him. Prior to his death, Mu&#x27;awiya appointed his son Yazid as his successor, contrary to the Hasan–Mu&#x27;awiya treaty. When Mu&#x27;awiya died in 680, Yazid demanded that Husayn pledge allegiance to him. Husayn refused to do so. As a consequence, he left Medina, his hometown, to take refuge in Mecca in AH 60 (679 CE). There, the people of Kufa sent letters to him, invited him to Kufa and asked him to be their Imam and pledged their allegiance to him. On Husayn&#x27;s way to Kufa with a retinue of about 72 men, his caravan was intercepted by a 1,000-strong army of the caliph at some distance from Kufa. He was forced to head north and encamp in the plain of Karbala on 2 October, where a larger Umayyad army of some 4,000 or 30,000 arrived soon afterwards. Negotiations failed after the Umayyad governor Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad refused Husayn safe passage without submitting to his authority, a condition declined by Husayn. Battle ensued on 10 October during which Husayn was martyred along with most of his relatives and companions, while his surviving family members were taken prisoner. The battle was followed by the Second Fitna, during which the Iraqis organized two separate campaigns to avenge the martyrdom of Husayn; the first one by the Tawwabin and the other one by Mukhtar al-Thaqafi and his supporters.

The Battle of Karbala galvanized the development of the pro-Alid party (&quot;Shi&#x27;at Ali&quot;) into a unique religious sect with its own rituals and collective memory. It has a central place in the Shi&#x27;a history, tradition, and theology, and has frequently been recounted in Shi&#x27;a literature. For the Shi&#x27;a, Husayn&#x27;s suffering and martyrdom became a symbol of sacrifice in the struggle for right against wrong, and for justice and truth against injustice and falsehood. It also provides the members of the Shi&#x27;a faith with a catalog of heroic norms. The battle is commemorated during an annual ten-day period during the Islamic month of Muharram by many Muslims especially Shi&#x27;a, culminating on tenth day of the month, known as the day of Ashura. On this day, Shi&#x27;a Muslims mourn, hold public processions, organize religious gathering, beat their chests and in some cases self-flagellate. Sunni Muslims likewise regard the incident as a historical tragedy; Husayn and his companions are widely regarded as martyrs by both Sunni and Shi&#x27;a Muslims.

==Early life==

According to the majority of narrations, Husayn was born on the 3rd of Sha&#x27;ban 4 AH (11 January 626 CE) in Medina and was still a child when his grandfather, Muhammad, died. He was the younger son of Ali, the cousin of Muhammad, and Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad, both from the Banu Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe. Both Hasan and Husayn were named by Muhammad, although Ali had other names such as &quot;Harb&quot; in mind. Muhammad sacrificed a ram to celebrate Husayn&#x27;s birth, and Fatima shaved his head and donated the same weight of his hair in silver as alms.
According to Islamic traditions, Husayn is mentioned in the Torah as &quot;Shubayr&quot; and in the Gospels as &quot;Tab&quot;. Aaron, Moses&#x27; brother, gave the same names to his sons after learning the names God had chosen for Ali&#x27;s children.

Husayn was brought up in Muhammad&#x27;s household at first. The family formed from the marriage of Ali and Fatima was praised many times by Muhammad. In events such as Mubahala and the hadith of the Ahl al-Kisa, Muhammad referred to this family as the ahl al-bayt. In the Qur&#x27;an, in many cases, such as the verse of purification, the ahl al-bayt has been praised.
According to Madelung, there are numerous narrations showing Muhammad&#x27;s love for Hasan and Husayn, such as carrying them on his shoulders, or putting them on his chest and kissing them on the belly. Madelung believes that some of these reports may imply a little preference of Muhammad for Hasan over Husayn, or pointing out that Hasan was more similar to his grandfather. Other Hadiths of this kind are: &quot;whoever loves them loves me and whoever hates them hates me&quot;, and &quot;al-Hasan and al-Husayn are the sayyids [masters] of the youth of Paradise&quot;. The recent one is used by Shia to prove the right of Imamate for the descendants of Muhammad. is an epithet used by Shias to refer to each of Muhammad&#x27;s grandsons. It is also narrated that Muhammad took Ali, Fatima, Hasan and Husayn under his cloak and called them ahl al-bayt and stated that they are free from any sin and pollution. Muhammad reported the Karbala incident on several occasions; For example, he gave a small bottle of soil to Umm Salama and told her that the soil inside the bottle would turn into blood after Husayn was killed.

=== Event of &quot;Mubahala&quot; ===
In the year 10 AH (631–632) a Christian envoy from Najran (now in northern Yemen) came to Muhammad to argue which of the two parties erred in its doctrine concerning Jesus. After likening Jesus&#x27; miraculous birth to Adam&#x27;s creation —who was born to neither a mother nor a father— and when the Christians did not accept the Islamic doctrine about Jesus, Muhammad reportedly received a revelation instructing him to call them to Mubahala, where each party should ask God to destroy the false party and their families: 
In Shia perspective, in the verse of &quot;Mubahala&quot;, the phrase &quot;our sons&quot; would refer to Hasan and Husayn, &quot;our women&quot; refers to Fatima, and &quot;ourselves&quot; refers to Ali. Most of the Sunni narrations quoted by al-Tabari do not name the participants. Other Sunni historians mention Muhammad, Fatima, Hasan and Husayn as having participated in the Mubahala, and some agree with the Shia tradition that Ali was among them.
The verse &quot;God wishes only to remove taint from you, people of the Household, and to make you utterly pure&quot; is also attributed to this event, during which Ali, Fatima, Hasan and Husayn stood under Muhammad&#x27;s cloak. Thus the title, the Family of the Cloak, is related sometimes to the Event of Mubahala.

== During the caliphate of Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman ==
During the caliphate of Abu Bakr and Umar, Husayn was present at some events such as testifying about the story of Fadak. According to a narration, Husayn, while the second caliph was sitting on the pulpit of Muhammad and giving a speech, objected to him for sitting on the pulpit of Muhammad, and Umar also stopped his sermon and came down from the pulpit. During the time of Uthman, he defended Abu Dharr al-Ghifari, who had preached against some of the actions of the tyrants and was to be exiled from Medina.

According to several narrations, Ali asked Hasan and Husayn to defend the third Caliph during the Siege of Uthman and carry water to him. According to Vaglieri, when Hasan entered Uthman&#x27;s house, Uthman was already assassinated.
Another report says that Uthman asked Ali&#x27;s help. The latter send Husayn in response. Then Uthman asked Husayn if he was able to defend himself against rebels. Husayn demurred, so Uthman sent him back. It is also narrated that Uthman&#x27;s cousin, Marwan ibn Hakam, have said Husayn: &quot;Leave us, your father incites the people against us, and you are here with us!&quot; Haeri writes in the Encyclopedia of the Islamic World: According to some narrations, Husayn or Hasan were wounded in the case of defending Uthman.

== During the caliphate of Ali and Hasan ==
During the Caliphate of Ali, Husayn, along with his brothers Hasan and Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya, and his cousin, Abdullah ibn Ja&#x27;far were among closest allies of Ali. He remained alongside him, accompanying him in the battlefields. According to a report by Tabari, Husayn was among Ali&#x27;s major supporters who were cursed in public by the order of Mu&#x27;awiya.

After the assassination of Ali people gave allegiance to Hasan. Mu&#x27;awiya who did not want go give allegiance to him, prepared to fight. To avoid the agonies of the civil war, Hasan signed a treaty with Mu&#x27;awiya, according to which Mu&#x27;awiya would not name a successor during his reign, and let the Islamic community () choose his successor. Madelung believes that Husayn did not recognize this treaty at first, but pressed by Hasan, accepted it. Later on when several Shia leaders suggested him to conduct a surprise attack on Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s camp near Kufa, he refused, saying that as long as Mu&#x27;awiya was alive, he would abide by the terms of the peace treaty, however, after Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s death, he will reconsider it. After signing the peace treaty, Mu&#x27;awiyah delivered a sermon in Kufa in which he declared that he had violated all the provisions of the treaty and also insulted Ali ibn Abi Talib. Husayn wanted to respond, but Hasan refused to do so, and Hasan delivered a sermon in response. Husayn adhered to the terms of the treaty even after Hassan&#x27;s death. Husayn then left Kufa for Medina along with Hasan and Abdullah ibn Ja&#x27;far. He adhered to the terms of the treaty even after Hasan&#x27;s death.

==During the caliphate of Mu&#x27;awiya==
According to the Shi&#x27;a, Husayn was the third Imam for a period of ten years after the death of his brother Hasan in 670 AD. All of this time except the last six months coincided with the caliphate of Mu&#x27;awiya. In the nine-year period between Hasan&#x27;s abdication in AH 41 (660 AD) and his death in AH 49 (669 AD), Hasan and Husayn retreated to Medina, trying to keep aloof from political involvement for or against Mu&#x27;awiya. Sentiments in favor of the rule of Ahl al-Bayt occasionally emerged in the form of small groups, mostly from Kufa, visiting Hasan and Husayn asking them to be their leaders – a request to which they declined to respond. When Hasan was poisoned, he refused to tell Husayn the name of his suspect, probably Mu&#x27;awiya, in fear of provoking bloodshed. The burial of Hasan&#x27;s body near that of Muhammad, was another problem which could have led to bloodshed, as Marwan ibn Hakam swore that he would not permit Hasan to be buried near Muhammad with Abu Bakr and Umar, while Uthman was buried in the cemetery of al-Baqi. After the death of Hasan, when Iraqis turned to Husayn, concerning an uprising, Husayn instructed them to wait as long as Mu&#x27;awiya was alive due to Hasan&#x27;s peace treaty with him. Meanwhile, Marwan reported to Mu&#x27;awiya the frequent visits of Shias to Husayn. Mu&#x27;awiya instructed Marwan not to clash with Husayn, in the same time he wrote a letter to Husayn in which he &quot;mingled generous promises with the advice not to provoke him.&quot; Later on, when Mu&#x27;awiya was taking allegiance for his son, Yazid, Husayn was among the five prominent persons who did not give his allegiance, as appointing a successor was in violation of Hasan&#x27;s peace treaty with Mu&#x27;awiya. Before his death in April 680, Mu&#x27;awiya cautioned Yazid that Husayn and Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr might challenge his rule and instructed him to defeat them if they did. Yazid was further advised to treat Husayn with caution and not to spill his blood, since he was the grandson of Muhammad.

==Uprising==
===Refusal to give allegiance to Yazid===
Immediately after Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s death on 15th of Rajab 60 AH (22 April 680 AD), Yazid charged the governor of Medina, Walid ibn Utba ibn Abu Sufyan, to secure allegiance from Husayn with force if necessary. Yazid&#x27;s goal was to take control of the situation in the city before the people became aware of Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s death. Yazid&#x27;s concern was especially about his two rivals in the caliphate; Husayn and Abdullah ibn Zubayr who had previously renounced allegiance.
Husayn answered the summons but declined to pledge allegiance in the secretive environment of the meeting, suggesting it should be done in public.
Marwan ibn Hakam told Walid to imprison or behead him, but due to Husayn&#x27;s kinship with Muhammad, Walid was unwilling to take any action against him. A few days later, Husayn left for Mecca without acknowledging Yazid. He arrived in Mecca at the beginning of May 680, and stayed there until the beginning of September. He was accompanied by his wives, children and brothers, as well as Hasan&#x27;s sons.

===Invitations from Kufa ===
Husayn had considerable support in Kufa, which had been the caliphal capital during the reigns of his father and brother. The Kufans had fought the Umayyads and their Syrian allies during the First Fitna, the five-year civil war which had established the Umayyad Caliphate. They were dissatisfied with Hasan&#x27;s abdication and strongly resented Umayyad rule. While in Mecca, Husayn received letters from pro-Alids in Kufa informing him that they were tired of the Umayyad rule, which they considered to be oppressive, and that they had no rightful leader. They asked him to lead them in revolt against Yazid, promising to remove the Umayyad governor if Husayn would consent to aid them. Husayn wrote back affirmatively that a rightful leader is the one who acts according to the Qur&#x27;an and promised to lead them with the right guidance. Then he sent his cousin Muslim ibn Aqil to assess the situation in Kufa. Ibn Aqil attracted widespread support and informed Husayn of the situation, suggesting that he join them there. Yazid removed Nu&#x27;man ibn Bashir al-Ansari as governor of Kufa due to his inaction, and installed Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, then governor of Basra, in his place. As a result of Ibn Ziyad&#x27;s suppression and political maneuvering, Ibn Aqil&#x27;s following began to dissipate and he was forced to declare the revolt prematurely. It was defeated and Ibn Aqil was killed.
Husayn had also sent a messenger to Basra, another garrison town in Iraq, but the messenger could not attract any following and was quickly apprehended and executed. 
Husayn was unaware of the change of political circumstances in Kufa and decided to depart. Abd Allah ibn Abbas and Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr advised him not to move to Iraq, or, if he was determined, not to take women and children with him. Nevertheless, he offered Husayn support if he would stay in Mecca and lead the opposition to Yazid from there. Husayn refused this, citing his abhorrence of bloodshed in the sanctuary, and decided to go ahead with his plan.

===Journey towards Kufa===
Despite the advice of Muhammad ibn Hanafiyya, Abdullah ibn Umar, and the constant insistence of Abd Allah ibn Abbas in Mecca, Husayn did not back down from his decision to go to Kufa. Ibn &#x27;Abbas pointed out that the Kufis had left both his father Ali and his brother Hasan alone, and suggested that Husayn go to Yemen instead of Kufa, or at least not take women and children with him if he were to go to Iraq. Husayn insisted on his decision and wrote about his motives and goals in a famous letter or will that he gave to Muhammad ibn al Hanafiyyah

&quot;I did not go out for fun and selfishness and for corruption and oppression; Rather, my goal is to correct the corruptions that have occurred in the nation of my ancestors. I want to command the good and forbid the bad, and follow the tradition of my grandfather and the way of my father Ali ibn Abi Talib. So, whoever accepts this truth (and follows me) has accepted the way of God and whoever rejects (and does not follow me) I will walk (my way) with patience and perseverance so that God may be the judge between me and this nation and he is the best judge.&quot;

Then, Husayn, who had not yet received the letters of the new events of Kufa, prepared to leave for Kufa on the 8th or 10th of Dhu al-Hijjah 60 AH / 10 or 12 September 680 AD. Instead of performing Hajj, he performed Umrah, and in the absence of the Governor of Mecca, Amr ibn Sa&#x27;id ibn As, who was performing Hajj on the outskirts of the city, secretly left the city with his companions and family. Fifty men from Husayn&#x27;s relatives and friends – who could fight if needed – accompanied Husayn, including women and children. He took the northerly route through the Arabian Desert. On persuasion of Husayn&#x27;s cousin Abd Allah ibn Ja&#x27;far, the governor of Mecca Amr ibn Sa&#x27;id sent his brother and Ibn Ja&#x27;far after Husayn in order to assure him safety in Mecca and bring him back. Husayn refused to return, relating that Muhammad had ordered him in a dream to move forward irrespective of the consequences. Further on the way, he received the news of the execution of Ibn Aqil and the indifference of the people of Kufa. 
He informed his followers of the situation and asked them to leave. Most of the people who had joined him on the way left, while his companions from Mecca decided to stay with him.

 On the way, Husayn encountered various people. In response to Husayn&#x27;s question about the situation in Iraq, the poet Farzadaq explicitly told him that the hearts of the Iraqi people are with you, but their swords are in the service of the Umayyads. But Husayn&#x27;s decision was unwavering, and in response to those who tried to dissuade him, he said that things were in God&#x27;s hands and that God wanted the best for His servants and would not be hostile to anyone who was right. The news of the murder of Muslim ibn Aqeel and Hani ibn Arwa was reported by some travellers, for the first time in Thalabiyah.

When Husayn reached the area of Zabalah, he found out that his messenger, Qais ibn Mushar Sa&#x27;idawi – or his brother-in-law, Abdullah ibn Yaqtar – who had been sent from Hejaz to Kufa to inform the people of Husayn&#x27;s imminent arrival, was exposed and killed by falling from the roof of Kufa Palace. Upon hearing this, Husayn allowed his supporters to leave the caravan due to the depressing issues such as the betrayal of the Kufis. A number of those who had joined him on the way, parted away. But those who had come with Husayn from Hejaz did not leave him. The news from Kufa showed that the situation there had completely changed from what Muslim had reported. The political assessments made it clear to Husayn that going to Kufa was no longer apt.

In the area of Sharaf or Zuhsam, armies emerged from Kufa under the leadership of Hurr ibn Yazid. With the weather being hot there, Husayn ordered water to be given to them and then announced his motives to the army and said:

&quot;You did not have an Imam and I became the means of uniting the ummah. Our family is more deserving of government than anyone else, and those in power do not deserve it and rule unjustly. If you support me, I will go to Kufa. But if you do not want me anymore, I will return to my first place.&quot;

Ibn Ziyad had stationed troops on the routes into Kufa. Husayn and his followers were intercepted by the vanguard of Yazid&#x27;s army, about 1,000 men led by Hurr ibn Yazid al-Tamimi, south of Kufa near Qadisiyya. Husayn said to them:I did not come to you until your letters were brought to me, and your messengers came to me saying, &#x27;Come to us, for we have no imam.&#x27; ... Therefore, if you give me what you guaranteed in your covenants and sworn testimonies, I will come to your town. If you will not and are averse to my coming, I will leave you for the place from which I came to you. He then showed them the letters he had received from the Kufans, including some in Hurr&#x27;s force. Hurr denied any knowledge of the letters and stated that Husayn must go with him to Ibn Ziyad, which Husayn refused to do. Hurr responded that he would not allow Husayn to either enter Kufa or go back to Medina, but that he was free to travel anywhere else he wished. Nevertheless, he did not prevent four Kufans from joining Husayn. Husayn&#x27;s caravan started to move towards Qadisiyya, and Hurr followed them. At Naynawa, Hurr received orders from Ibn Ziyad to force Husayn&#x27;s caravan to halt in a desolate place without fortifications or water. One of Husayn&#x27;s companions suggested that they attack Hurr and move to the fortified village of al-Aqr. Husayn refused, stating that he did not want to start the hostilities.

According to Valiri, Hurr ordered his army to take Husayn and his companions to Ibn Ziyad without fighting and intended to persuade Husayn to do so. But when he saw that Husayn was moving his caravan, he did not dare to follow it. However, Madlung and Bahramian write that when Husayn was ready to leave, Hurr blocked his way and said that if Husayn did not accept the order given by Ibn Ziyad, Hurr would not allow him to go to Medina or Kufa. He suggested to Husayn to neither go to Kufa nor to Medina, rather write a letter to Yazid or Ibn Ziyad and wait for their orders, hoping to avoid this difficult situation by receiving an answer. But Husayn did not heed to his advice and continued to Azad or Qadisiyah. Hurr informed Husayn that he was doing this for Husayn and that if there would be a war, Husayn would be killed. Husayn, however, was not afraid of death and stopped in an area called Karbala, on the outskirts of Kufa.

In one place, Husayn recited a sermon and said: &quot;I do not see death except as martyrdom and living with the oppressors except as hardship.&quot; In another place, he explained the reason for his opposition to the government while recalling the bitterness of breaking the allegiance of the people of Kufa with his father and brother, saying, &quot;These people have submitted to the obedience of Satan and have left the obedience of God the Merciful.&quot; On the way, he refused to accept the offer to go to the tribe of Tayy by pointing to his pact with Hurr about not returning. Later, a messenger from Ibn Ziad came to Hur and, without greeting Husayn, gave a letter to Hur in which Ibn Ziad had ordered him to not to stop in a place where Husayn can have easy access to water. With this letter, Obaidullah wanted to force Husayn to fight. Zuhair ibn Qayn suggested to Husayn to attack the small army of Hur and capture the fortified village of Akr. But Husayn did not accept; Because he did not want to start a war.

On 2 October 680 (2 Muharram 61 AH), Husayn arrived at Karbala, a desert plain north of Kufa, and set up camp.
On the following day, a 4,000-strong Kufan army arrived under the command of Umar ibn Sa&#x27;d. He had been appointed governor of Rayy to suppress a local rebellion, but then recalled to confront Husayn. Initially, he was unwilling to fight Husayn, but complied following Ibn Ziyad&#x27;s threat to revoke his governorship. After negotiations with Husayn, Ibn Sa&#x27;d wrote to Ibn Ziyad that Husayn was willing to return. Ibn Ziyad replied that Husayn must surrender or he should be subdued by force, and that to compel him, he and his companions should be denied access to the Euphrates river. Ibn Sa&#x27;d stationed 500 horsemen on the route leading to the river. Husayn and his companions remained without water for three days before a group of fifty men led by his half-brother Abbas was able to access the river. They could only fill twenty water-skins.
Husayn and Ibn Sa&#x27;d met during the night to negotiate a settlement; it was rumored that Husayn made three proposals: either he be allowed to return to Medina, submit to Yazid directly, or be sent to a border post where he would fight alongside the Muslim armies. According to Madelung, these reports are probably untrue as Husayn at this stage is unlikely to have considered submitting to Yazid. A &quot;mawla&quot; of Husayn&#x27;s wife later claimed that Husayn had suggested that he be allowed to leave, so that all parties could allow the fluid political situation to clarify. Ibn Sa&#x27;d sent the proposal, whatever it was, to Ibn Ziyad, who is reported to have accepted but then persuaded otherwise by Shemr ibn Ziljawshan. Shemr argued that Husayn was in his domain and letting him go would be to demonstrate weakness. Ibn Ziyad then sent Shemr with orders to ask Husayn for his allegiance once more and to attack, kill and disfigure him if he was to refuse, as &quot;a rebel, a seditious person, a brigand, an oppressor and he was to do no further harm after his death&quot;. If Ibn Sa&#x27;d was unwilling to carry out the attack, he was instructed to hand over command to Shemr. Ibn Sa&#x27;d cursed Shemr and accused him of foiling his attempts to reach a peaceful settlement but agreed to carry out the orders. He remarked that Husayn would not submit because there was &quot;a proud soul in him&quot;.

The army advanced toward Husayn&#x27;s camp on the evening of 9 October. Husayn sent Abbas to ask Ibn Sa&#x27;d to wait until the next morning, so that they could consider the matter. Ibn Sa&#x27;d agreed to this respite. Husayn told his men that they were all free to leave, with his family, under the cover of night, since their opponents only wanted him. Very few availed themselves of this opportunity. Defense arrangements were made: tents were brought together and tied to one another and a ditch was dug behind the tents and filled with wood ready to be set alight in case of attack. Husayn and his followers then spent the rest of the night praying.

===Battle of Karbala===
After the morning prayer on 10 October, both parties took up battle positions. Husayn appointed Zuhayr ibn Qayn to command the right flank of his army, Habib ibn Muzahir to command the left flank, and his half-brother Abbas as the standard bearer. Husayn&#x27;s companions, according to most accounts, numbered thirty-two horsemen and forty infantrymen. Ibn Sa&#x27;d&#x27;s army totaled 4,000. The ditch containing wood were set alight. Husayn then delivered a speech to his opponents reminding them of his status as Muhammad&#x27;s grandson and reproaching them for inviting and then abandoning him. He asked to be allowed to leave. He was told that first he had to submit to Yazid&#x27;s authority, which he refused to do. Husayn&#x27;s speech moved Hurr to defect to his side.
After Husayn&#x27;s speech, Zuhayr ibn Qayn attempted to dissuade Ibn Sa&#x27;d&#x27;s soldiers from killing Husayn, but in vain. Ibn Sa&#x27;d&#x27;s army fired several volleys of arrows. This was followed by duels in which several of Husayn&#x27;s companions were slain. The right wing of the Kufans, led by Amr ibn al-Hajjaj, attacked Husayn&#x27;s force, but was repulsed. Hand-to-hand fighting paused and further volleys of arrows were exchanged. Shemr, who commanded the left wing of the Umayyad army, launched an attack, but after losses on both sides he was repulsed. This was followed by cavalry attacks. Husayn&#x27;s cavalry resisted fiercely and Ibn Sa&#x27;d brought in armoured cavalry and five hundred archers. After their horses were wounded by arrows, Husayn&#x27;s cavalrymen dismounted and fought on foot.

Since Umayyad forces could approach Husayn&#x27;s army from the front only, Ibn Sa&#x27;d ordered the tents to be burned. All except the one which Husayn and his family were using were set on fire. Shemr wanted to burn that one too, but was prevented by his companions. The plan backfired and flames hindered the Umayyad advance for a while. After noon prayers, Husayn&#x27;s companions were encircled, and almost all of them were killed. Husayn&#x27;s relatives, who had not taken part in the fighting so far, joined the battle. Husayn&#x27;s son Ali Akbar was killed; then Husayn&#x27;s half-brothers, including Abbas, and the sons of Aqil ibn Abi Talib, Jafar ibn Abi Talib and Hasan ibn Ali were slain. The account of Abbas&#x27; death is not given in the primary sources, al-Tabari and Baladhuri, but a prominent Shi&#x27;a theologian Shaykh Al-Mufid states in his account in &quot;Kitab al-Irshad&quot; that Abbas went to the river together with Husayn but became separated, was surrounded, and killed. At some point, a young child of Husayn&#x27;s, who was sitting on his lap, was hit by an arrow and died.

====Death====

During the Battle of Karbala the Umayyad soldiers hesitated to initiate a direct attack on Husayn; however, he was struck in the mouth by an arrow as he went to the river to drink. He collected his blood in a cupped hand and cast towards the sky, complaining to God of his suffering. Later, he was surrounded and struck on the head by Malik ibn Nusayr. The blow cut through his hooded cloak, which Husayn removed while cursing his attacker. He put a cap on his head and wrapped a turban around it to staunch the bleeding. Ibn Nusayr seized the bloodied cloak and retreated.

Shemr advanced with a group of foot soldiers towards Husayn, who was now prepared to fight as few people were left on his side. A young boy from Husayn&#x27;s camp escaped from the tents, ran to him, tried to defend him from a sword stroke and had his arm cut off. Ibn Sa&#x27;d approached the tents and Husayn&#x27;s sister Zaynab complained to him: &quot;&#x27;Umar b. Sa&#x27;d, will Abu &#x27;Abd Allah (the of Husayn) be killed while you stand and watch?&quot; Ibn Sa&#x27;d wept but did nothing. Husayn is said to have killed many of his attackers. The Umayyad forces however were still unwilling to kill him and each of them wanted to leave this to somebody else. Eventually Shemr shouted: &quot;Shame on you! Why are you waiting for the man? Kill him, may your mothers be deprived of you!&quot; The Umayyad soldiers then rushed Husayn and wounded him on his hand and shoulder. He fell on the ground face-down and an attacker named Sinan ibn Anas stabbed and beheaded him.

====Aftermath====

Seventy or seventy-two people died on Husayn&#x27;s side, of whom about twenty were descendants of Abu Talib, the father of Ali. This included two of Husayn&#x27;s sons, six of his paternal brothers, three sons of Hasan ibn Ali, three sons of Jafar ibn Abi Talib and three sons and three grandsons of Aqil ibn Abi Talib. Following the battle, Husayn&#x27;s clothes were stripped, and his sword, shoes and baggage were taken. The women&#x27;s jewelry and cloaks were also seized. Shemr wanted to kill Husayn&#x27;s only surviving son Ali al-Sajjad, who had not taken part in the fighting because of illness, but was prevented by Ibn Sa&#x27;d. There are reports of more than sixty wounds on Husayn&#x27;s body, which was then trampled with horses as previously instructed by Ibn Ziyad. The bodies of Husayn&#x27;s companions were decapitated. There were eighty-eight dead in Ibn Sa&#x27;d&#x27;s army, who were buried before he left. After his departure, members of the Banu Asad tribe, from the nearby village of Ghadiriya, buried the headless bodies of Husayn&#x27;s companions.

Husayn&#x27;s family, along with the heads of the dead, were sent to Ibn Ziyad. He poked Husayn&#x27;s mouth with a stick and intended to kill Ali al-Sajjad, but spared him after the pleas of Husayn&#x27;s sister Zaynab. The heads and the family were then sent to Yazid, who also poked Husayn&#x27;s mouth with a stick. The historian Henri Lammens has suggested that this is a duplication of the report regarding Ibn Ziyad. No one was compassionate towards the women and Ali al-Sajjad, One of his courtiers asked for the hand of a captive woman from Husayn&#x27;s family in marriage, which resulted in heated altercation between Yazid and Zaynab. The women of Yazid&#x27;s household joined the captive women in their lamentation for the dead. After a few years, the women were compensated for their belongings looted in Karbala and were sent back to Medina.

The killing of the grandson of Muhammad shocked the Muslim community. The image of Yazid suffered and gave rise to sentiment that he was impious. 
Prior to the Battle of Karbala, the Muslim community was divided into two political factions. Nonetheless, a religious sect with distinct theological doctrines and specific set of rituals had not developed. Karbala gave this early political party of pro-Alids a distinct religious identity and helped transform it into a distinct religious sect. Heinz Halm writes: &quot;There was no religious aspect to Shi&#x27;ism prior to 680. The death of the third imam and his followers marked the &#x27;big bang&#x27; that created the rapidly expanding cosmos of Shi&#x27;ism and brought it into motion.&quot;

====Related uprisings====
A few prominent Alid supporters in Kufa felt guilty for abandoning Husayn after having invited him to revolt. To atone for what they perceived as their sin, they began a movement known as Tawwabin uprising, under Sulayman ibn Surad, a companion of Muhammad, to fight the Umayyads, and attracted large-scale support. The armies met in January 685 at Battle of Ayn al-Warda; which resulted killing most of them including Ibn Surad.
The defeat of the Tawwabin left the leadership of the Kufan pro-Alids in the hand of Mukhtar al-Thaqafi. In October 685, Mukhtar and his supporters seized Kufa. His control extended to most of Iraq and parts of northwestern Iran. Mukhtar executed Kufans involved in the killing of Husayn, including Ibn Sa&#x27;d and Shemr, while thousands of people fled to Basra. He then sent his general Ibrahim ibn al-Ashtar to fight an approaching Umayyad army, led by Ibn Ziyad, which had been sent to reconquer the province. The Umayyad army was routed at the Battle of Khazir in August 686 and Ibn Ziyad was slain. Later on, in April 687, Mukhtar was killed.

====Historical analysis====
Based on an official report sent to caliph Yazid, which describes the battle of Karbala very briefly, stating that it lasted for no longer than a siesta, Lammens concludes that there was no battle at all but a quick massacre that was over in an hour; he suggests that the detailed accounts found in the primary sources are Iraqi fabrications, since their writers were dissatisfied with their hero being killed without putting up a fight. This is countered by the historian Laura Veccia Vaglieri, who argues that despite there being some fabricated accounts, all of the contemporary accounts together form &quot;a coherent and credible narrative&quot;. She criticizes Lammens&#x27; hypothesis as being based on a single isolated report and being devoid of critical analysis. Similarly, Madelung and Wellhausen assert that the battle lasted from sunrise to sunset and that the overall account of the battle is reliable. Vaglieri and Madelung explain the length of the battle despite the numerical disparity between the opposing camps as Ibn Sa&#x27;d&#x27;s attempt to prolong the fight and pressure Husayn into submission instead of attempting to quickly overwhelm and kill him.

According to Wellhausen, the compassion that Yazid showed to the family of Husayn, and his cursing of Ibn Ziyad was only for show. He argues that if killing Husayn was a crime its responsibility lay with Yazid and not Ibn Ziyad, who was only performing his duty. Madelung holds a similar view; according to him, early accounts place the responsibility for Husayn&#x27;s death on Ibn Ziyad instead of Yazid. Yazid, Madelung argues, wanted to end Husayn&#x27;s opposition, but as a caliph of Islam could not afford to be seen as publicly responsible and so diverted blame onto Ibn Ziyad by hypocritically cursing him. According to Howard, some traditional sources have a tendency to exonerate Yazid at the cost of Ibn Ziyad and lower authorities.

====Primary and classic sources====

The primary source of the Karbala narrative is the work of the Kufan historian Abu Mikhnaf titled &quot;Kitab Maqtal Al-Husayn&quot;. Abu Mikhnaf&#x27;s was an adult some twenty years after the Battle of Karbala. As such he knew many eyewitnesses and collected firsthand accounts and some with very short chains of transmitters, usually one or two intermediaries. The eyewitnesses were of two kinds: those from Husayn&#x27;s side; and those from Ibn Sa&#x27;d&#x27;s army. Since few people from Husayn&#x27;s camp survived, most eyewitnesses were from the second category. According to Julius Wellhausen, most of them regretted their actions in the battle and embellished the accounts of the battle in favor of Husayn in order to dilute their guilt. Although as an Iraqi, Abu Mikhnaf had pro-Alid tendencies, his reports generally do not contain much bias on his part. Abu Mikhnaf&#x27;s original text seems to have been lost and the version extant today has been transmitted through secondary sources such as the &quot;History of Prophets and Kings&quot; by al-Tabari; and &quot;Ansab al-Ashraf&quot; by Baladhuri. Tabari quotes either directly from Abu Mikhnaf or from his student Ibn al-Kalbi, who took most of his material from Abu Mikhnaf. Tabari occasionally takes material from Ammar ibn Mu&#x27;awiya, Awana and other primary sources, which, however, adds little to the narrative. Baladhuri uses same sources as Tabari. Information on the battle found in the works of Dinawari and Ya&#x27;qubi is also based on Abu Mikhnaf&#x27;s &quot;Maqtal&quot;, although they occasionally provide some extra notes and verses. Other secondary sources include al-Mas&#x27;udi&#x27;s &quot;Muruj al-Dhahab&quot;, Ibn Ath&#x27;am&#x27;s &quot;Kitab al-Futuh&quot;, Shaykh al-Mufid&#x27;s &quot;Kitab al-Irshad&quot;, and Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani&#x27;s &quot;Maqatil al-Talibiyyin&quot;. Most of these sources took material from Abu Mikhnaf, in addition to some from the primary works of Awana, al-Mada&#x27;ini and Nasr ibn Muzahim.
Although Tabari and other early sources contain some miraculous stories, these sources are mainly historical and rational in nature, in contrast to the literature of later periods, which is mainly hagiographical in nature.
The Battle of Karbala was also reported by an early Christian source. A history by the Syriac Christian scholar Theophilus of Edessa, who was chief astrologer in the Abbasid court between 775 and 785, is partially preserved in a number of extant Christian chronicles, including those by Michael the Syrian and the Byzantine historian Theophanes the Confessor.

== Tomb ==

Husayn ibn Ali&#x27;s tomb is located in the city of Karbala, about 90 km southwest of Baghdad. This tomb was probably formed two centuries after the event of Karbala and was rebuilt and expanded until the thirteenth century AH. This place did not have a building at first and was marked with a simple sign. After that, in the third century AH, a monument was built on it, which was considered during the time of some Abbasid caliphs and Dailami princes and patriarchal and Ottoman rulers, and over time, the city of Karbala was built and expanded around it.

There are several narrations about the burial place of Imam Husayn&#x27;s head; For example, with his father Ali in Najaf, outside Kufa but not with Ali, in Karbala with his whole body, in Baqiya, in an unknown place in Damascus, in Raqqa, Syria, and in a mosque Mohsen Al-Amin in Cairo.

==Commemoration==

Shi&#x27;a Muslims consider pilgrimages to Husayn&#x27;s tomb to be a source of divine blessings and rewards. According to Shi&#x27;a tradition the first such visit was performed by Husayn&#x27;s son Ali al-Sajjad and the surviving family members during their return from Syria to Medina. The first historically recorded visit is Sulayman ibn Surad and the Penitents going to Husayn&#x27;s grave before their departure to Syria. They are reported to have lamented and beaten their chests and to have spent a night by the tomb. Thereafter this tradition was limited to the Shi&#x27;a imams for several decades, before gaining momentum under the sixth Shi&#x27;a imam Jafar Sadiq and his followers. Buyids and Safavids also encouraged this practice. Special visits are paid on 10 Muharram (&quot;Ashura&quot; Pilgrimage) and 40 days after the anniversary of Husayn&#x27;s (&quot;Arba&#x27;in&quot; pilgrimage). In Shi&#x27;a tradition, Husayn&#x27;s martyrdom is also connected to the hagiography of John the Baptist.

The soil of Karbala, is considered to have miraculous healing effects.

Mourning for Husayn is considered by Shi&#x27;as to be a source of salvation in the afterlife, and is undertaken as a remembrance of his suffering. After the death of Husayn, when his family was being taken to Ibn Ziyad, Husayn&#x27;s sister Zaynab is reported to have cried out after seeing his headless body: &quot;O Muhammad!... Here is Husayn in the open, stained with blood and with limbs torn off. O Muhammad! Your daughters are prisoners, your progeny are killed, and the east wind blows dust over them.&quot; Shi&#x27;a Muslims consider this to be the first instance of wailing and mourning over the death of Husayn. Husayn&#x27;s son Ali al-Sajjad is reported to have spent the rest of his life weeping for his father. Similarly, Husayn&#x27;s mother Fatima is believed to be weeping for him in paradise and the weeping of believers is considered to be a way of sharing her sorrows. Special gatherings (&quot;majalis&quot;; sing. &quot;majlis&quot;) are arranged in places reserved for this purpose, called &quot;husayniyya&quot;. In these gatherings the story of Karbala is narrated and various elegies (&quot;rawda&quot;) are recited by professional reciters (&quot;rawda khwan&quot;).
During the month of Muharram, elaborate public processions are performed in commemoration of the Battle of Karbala. In contrast to pilgrimage to Husayn&#x27;s tomb and simple lamenting, these processions do not date back to the time of the battle, but arose during tenth century. Their earliest recorded instance was in Baghdad in 963 during the reign of the first Buyid ruler Mu&#x27;izz al-Dawla. The processions start from a &quot;husayniyya&quot; and the participants parade barefoot through the streets, wailing and beating their chests and heads before returning to the &quot;husayniyya&quot; for a &quot;majlis&quot;. Sometimes, chains and knives are used to inflict wounds and physical pain. In South Asia, an ornately tacked horse called &quot;Zuljenah&quot;, representing Husayn&#x27;s battle horse, is also led riderless through the streets. In Iran, the battle scenes of Karbala are performed on stage in front of an audience in a ritual called &quot;taziya&quot; (passion play), also known as &quot;shabih&quot;. In India however, &quot;taziya&quot; refers to the coffins and replicas of Husayn&#x27;s tomb carried in processions.

Most of these rituals take place during the first ten days of Muharram, reaching a climax on the tenth day, although &quot;majalis&quot; can also occur throughout the year. Occasionally, especially in the past, some Sunni participation in &quot;majalis&quot; and processions has been observed. According to Yitzhak Nakash, the rituals of Muharram have an &quot;important&quot; effect in the &quot;invoking the memory of Karbala&quot;, as these help consolidate the collective identity and memory of the Shi&#x27;a community. Anthropologist Michael Fischer states that commemoration of the Battle of Karbala by the Shi&#x27;a is not only the retelling of the story, but also presents them with &quot;life models and norms of behavior&quot; which are applicable to all aspects of life, which he calls the Karbala Paradigm. According to Olmo Gölz, the Karbala Paradigm provide Shi&#x27;as with heroic norms and a martyr ethos, and represents an embodiment of the battle between good and evil, justice and injustice. Rituals involving self-flagellation have been criticized by many Shi&#x27;a scholars as they are considered to be innovative practices. Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has banned the practice in Iran since 1994.

==Family life==

Husayn&#x27;s first marriage was with Rubab. Her father, Imra&#x27; al-Qais, a chief of Banu Kalb, came to Medina during the Caliphate of Umar, and was appointed by him as the chief of the Quda&#x27;a tribes. Ali proposed her marriage with Husayn, but since Husayn and Imra al-Qais&#x27;s daughter were too young at the time, the actual marriage took place later. Husayn had a daughter, Amena (or Amina or Omayma) who is known as Sakinah, from her. According to a narration recorded by Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani, Hasan has blamed Husayn for his excessive favors to Rubab. Husayn, in response, depicted his great love for Rubab and Sakinah in three lines of poetry. Later on Rubab bore a son, Abd Allah (or according to recent Shia sources, Ali al-Asghar) for him. Husayn&#x27;s , Abu Abd Allah, probably refers to this son. After Husayn&#x27;s death, Rubab spent a year in grief at his grave and refused to marry again.

According to Madelung, Husayn had two sons named Ali. The older one, Ali al-Sajjad who became the fourth Shia Imam later, was 23 years old when his younger brother (Ali al-Akbar) was killed in the Battle of Karbala at the age of 19. Ali al-Akbar was born from Layla, the daughter of Abi Murrah al-Thaqafi, who was an ally of the Umayyads. Husayn&#x27;s marriage with Layla, according to Madelung, probably had material benefits for Husayn. Ali al-Sajjad&#x27;s mother, on the other hand, was a slave probably from Sind named Ḡazāla, Solāfa, Salāma, Šāhzanān, or Shahrbanu. According to the reports, commonly accepted by Shia, she was the daughter of Yazdegerd III, the last Sassanid king of Iran to be captured during the Arab conquest. On the other hand, in narrative sources, mistakes and confusion have been made between Ali al-Asghar and Abd Allah. Contemporary Shiite circles have carefully identified Sajjad as Ali al-Awsat and Ali al-Asghar as an infant in Karbala; Among these children, Abd Allah – known by the mention of his name in the events of Ashura – is considered the other son of Husayn. According to Madelung, although early Sunni sources refer to Ali al-Sajjad as &#x27;Ali al-Asghar and Ali II as &#x27;Ali al-Akbar, it is probably true that Sheikh Mufid and other Shi&#x27;ite writers are correct in stating the opposite. Ali II was killed in Karbala at the age of 19. His mother is Layla, the daughter of Abi Murrah ibn Urwah al-Thaqafi and Maymuna bint Abi Sufyan, the sister of Mu&#x27;awiya. According to Madelung, after Hasan&#x27;s peace with Mu&#x27;awiya, Husayn married Layla, from whom Ali al-Akbar was born.

Umm Ishaq, the daughter of Talha, was another wife of Husayn, who had previously married Hasan. Despite her allegedly bad character, Hasan was pleased with her and asked his younger brother, Husayn, to marry her when he himself died. Husayn did so and had a daughter from her, named Fatima, who later married with Hasan ibn Hasan.

Hasan and Husayn were the only male descendants of the Muhammad from whom the next generations were born. Hence, any person who says that his lineage goes back to the Muhammad is either related to Hasan or to Husayn. Hasan and Husayn are different in this respect from their half brothers, such as Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya.

== Personality and appearance ==
Husayn had a white face and sometimes wore a green turban and sometimes a black turban. He would travel with the poor or invite them to his house and feed them. Mu&#x27;awiya said about Husayn that he and his father Ali were not deceitful, and Amr ibn al-As considered him the most beloved of the earthlings to the people of heaven.

According to the Encyclopedia of Islam, one of the moral characteristics of Husayn is Tolerance, humility, eloquence, and finally traits that can be deduced from his behavior, such as despising death, hatred of a shameful life, pride, and the like. In many narrations, the resemblance of Husayn and his brother to Muhammad is mentioned, and each of them is likened to half of their grandfather&#x27;s behavior.

Husayn is described as looking like his grandfather, Muhammad, though not as much as his older brother, Hasan. According to Madelung, Husayn was similar to his father, Ali, while Hasan had the temperament of Muhammad and criticized the policies of his father, Ali. Madelung cites the fact that Hasan named two of his sons Muhammad and did not name any of them Ali and that Husayn named two of his four sons Ali and did not name either Muhammad as proof of this claim. 
Rasool Jafarian considers the narrations in which Husayn is like Ali and Hasan is like Muhammad to be fake; According to him, the image presented in these narrations could have been used to destroy the image of Ali and Ashura and to be useful to those who were in favor of Uthman tendencies. According to the Shia scholar, Muhammad Husayn Tabatabai, the opinion of some commentators about the difference in taste between Hasan and Husayn is misplaced; Because despite not swearing allegiance to Yazid, Husayn, like his brother, spent ten years in Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s rule and never opposed it. Mohammad Emadi Haeri believes that Husayn is considered to be similar to Muhammad in most sources, and in one narration the most similar to him. There is also a narration that Ali considers Hussein to be the most similar person in terms of behavior.

Husayn was known for his generosity in Medina, and he freed his slaves and maids if they saw any good behavior. There is a narration that Mu&#x27;awiyah sent a maid to Husayn with a lot of property and clothes. When the maid recited verses from the Qur&#x27;an and a poem about the instability of the world and the death of man, Husayn set her free and gave her property. Once one of Husayn&#x27;s slaves did something wrong. But after the slave recited the verse &quot;وَالْعافینَ عَنِ النَّاس&quot;, Husayn forgave him and after that the slave recited the verse &quot;وَلِلَّهِ یُحِبُّ الْمُحسنِينَ&quot; and Husayn released the slave because of this. There is a narration that Husayn gave the property and goods that he inherited before receiving them. Husayn gave his children&#x27;s teacher a large sum of money and clothes; While acknowledging that this does not compensate for the value of the teacher&#x27;s work. A Levantine man once cursed Husayn and Ali, but Husayn forgave him and treated him with kindness. It is said that the place of the food bags that Husayn carried for the poor was obvious on his body on the day of Ashura.

== In the Quran and Hadith ==

=== In the verses of the Quran ===
Many Sunni and Shia&#x27;a commentators, such as Fakhr Razi and Muhammad Husayn Tabataba&#x27;i, in their interpretation of Surah Al-Insan, attribute its revelation to Ali and Fatima and the story of the illness of their child or children and a vow for their recovery.

Muhammad Husayn Tabataba&#x27;i in Tafsir al-Mizan said, the event of the &quot;mubahala&quot; tells the story of the confrontation between the Prophet of Islam and his family on the one hand and the Christians of Najran on the other. Tabatabai says that according to the narrations, the meaning of our sons in the verse of Mubahila was Hassan and Husayn. Many Sunni commentators have also stated that the people in it are Ali, Fatima, Hasan and Husayn.

In interpreting the verse of purification in Al-Mizan, Tabatabai considers the addressee of this verse to be the Ahl al-Kisa and refers to its hadiths, which number more than seventy hadiths and are mostly from the Sunnis. Sunni commentators such as Fakhr Razi and Ibn Kathir, in their commentary, while narrating various narrations about the example of Ahl al-Bayt in this verse, consider Ali, Fatima, Hasan and Husayn as examples.

In the explanation and interpretation of verse 23 of Surah ash-Shura, Tabatabai in Al-Mizan, while reporting and criticizing the various sayings of the commentators, has said that the meaning of &quot;nearness&quot; is the love of the Ahl al-Bayt of Muhammad; That is, Ali is Fatima, Hassan and Husayn. He goes on to cite various narrations from Sunnis and Shiites that have clarified this issue. Sunni commentators such as Fakhr al-Razi and Ibn Kathir have also referred to this issue.

Verse 15 of Surah Al-Ahqaf talks about a pregnant woman who endures a lot of pain and suffering. This verse is considered a reference to Fatima Zahra, and the son is also known as Husayn, when God expressed his condolences to Muhammad about the fate of this grandson and Muhammad expressed this to Fatima Zahra, she was very upset.

Other verses that the Shiites attribute to Husayn include verse 6 of Surah Al-Ahzab and 28 of Surah Az-Zukhruf, which have been interpreted to mean the continuation of the Imamate from his generation. Also, verses such as 77 Surah an-Nisa, 33 Surah al-Isra and 27th to 30th Surah Al-Fajr refer to the uprising and killing of Husayn from the Shiite point of view.

=== In the biography of the Prophet of Islam ===
Husayn is placed as an example for the second weight in the narrations related to &quot;Thaqalin&quot;. In another group of narrations related to Hasnain, they are introduced as &quot;the master of the youth of Paradise&quot;. His name and Hassan&#x27;s, due to their young age, are among those who pledge allegiance in renewing allegiance to the Prophet, which indicates the Prophet&#x27;s goal in strengthening their historical and social status.

==== News of Husayn&#x27;s fate ====
There are narrations that Gabriel informed Muhammad at the time of Husayn&#x27;s birth that his ummah would kill Husayn and that the Imamate would be from Husayn, and that Muhammad informed his companions of how Husayn had been killed. Except for Muhammad, Ali and Hasan, they had said the same thing. God also informed the previous prophets about the killing of Husayn. Ali also knew that Husayn would be killed in Karbala, and once he passed by this area, he stopped and cried and remembered the news of Muhammad. He interpreted Karbala (کربلا) as (کرب) anguish and (بلا) calamity. The slain of Karbala will enter Paradise without any reckoning.

==Works==
There are narrations, sermons and letters left from Husayn Ibn Ali which are available in Sunni and Shiite sources. Narrations about him can be divided into two periods before and after the Imamate. In the first period – which is the period of his life in the life of his grandfather, father, mother and brother – there are at least two types of narrations about him: first, his narrations from his relatives, and second, his personal hadiths. In Sunni sources, only the aspect of the narration of his hadith has been considered in these hadiths. These Musnads, like the Musnad of the Companions of the Prophet of Islam, also have a Musnad named Husayn Ibn Ali. In his Musnad, Abu Bakr Bazar has narrated the Musnad of Husayn Ibn Ali with 4 hadiths and Tabarani has narrated his Musnad with 27 hadiths, respectively. In the Musnad of Husayn ibn Ali, in addition to the hadiths of Husayn himself, there are also hadiths of the Prophet of Islam and Ali ibn Abi Talib. In the present era, Azizullah Atardi has compiled the document of the Imam of the Martyr Abi Abdullah Al-Husayn Ibn Ali.

In the category of sermons of Husayn Ibn Ali, there are some sermons of him in the pre-Imamate period, some of which are very famous. Thus, the sermon of Husayn ibn Ali, after public allegiance to Ali ibn Abi Talib and others, is his sermon in the battle of Safin. Another example is a poem by Husayn about the loss of his brother Hasan after his burial. The sermons and letters of Husayn ibn Ali during his Imamate are more than before him. His letters to the Shiites, as well as his letters to Mu&#x27;awiyah regarding his adherence to the peace treaty, trace Mu&#x27;awiyah&#x27;s actions, especially regarding Yazid, as well as his sermons and letters in the form of letters of recommendation at the beginning of Yazid&#x27;s caliphate. An important part of the sermons and letters belong to the period of the uprising of Husayn bin Ali. Correspondence with Kufis, Basrians and people like Muslim Ibn Aqeel is like this. Hadiths on the subjects of jurisprudence, interpretation, beliefs, rulings and sermons, supplications, advice and poetry also remain from Husayn, which are scattered in Shiite and Sunni sources and have been compiled and published in the form of collections. There are also prayers left by Husayn Ibn Ali which have been published in the form of collections entitled Al-Sahifa Al-Husayn or prays of Imam Al-Husayn.

One of the most famous Shia prayers, as well as the works of Husayn, recorded in the book, Mafatih al-Janan, is the Du&#x27;a Arafah. According to William C. Chittick, this prayer is the most famous prayer in terms of its beauty and spiritual structure and is recited every year on the Day of Arafah and during the Hajj season – that is, when it was first recited by Husayn ibn Ali – by Shia pilgrims. This prayer has a special and important role in Shia theology and Mulla Sadra, the philosopher and mystic, has referred to this prayer many times in his works.

==Views==
The killing of Husayn has had an emotional impact on Sunnis, who remember the event as a tragic incident and those killed in the company of Husayn as martyrs. The impact on Shi&#x27;a Islam has been much deeper. According to Vaglieri, only the adherents of the Umayyad who considered him as &quot;a rebel against the established authority&quot;, condoned his murder by Yazid, but their opinion was opposed by the majority of Muslims. Therefore, almost all Muslims consider Husayn honorable because he was the grandson of Muhammad and because of the belief that he sacrificed himself for an ideal. Historian Edward Gibbon described the events at Karbala as a tragedy. According to historian Syed Akbar Hyder, Mahatma Gandhi attributed the historical progress of Islam, to the &quot;sacrifices of Muslim saints like Husayn&quot; rather than military force.

===Sunnis===
The positive attitude of the Sunnis towards Husayn, according to Vaglieri, is most likely due to the sad narrations that Abu Mikhnaf has collected, some of which have been narrated directly or with short chains of transmitters, mostly from Kufis who regretted their actions towards Husayn. These sad narrations of the Kufis, which were a sign of Abu Mikhnaf&#x27;s Shia tendencies, became the source of the narrations used by later historians and spread throughout the Islamic world. According to Rasul Jafarian, the Shia historian, fatalism, being promoted by Mu&#x27;awiya, caused Husayn&#x27;s move to never be considered an uprising against corruption by the Sunnis, and they only considered it an illegal insurrection ().

===Shias ===
The most important components of Shia views about Husayn are the belief in the Imamate of Husayn and the characteristics of an Imam by the Shia religions; Twelvers, Ismailis and Zaydis. Like other Imams, Husayn is a mediator with God for those who call on him; &quot;it is through his intercession () that his faithful followers obtain guidance and attain salvation.&quot;

As a member of holy five he receives all the divine grace that exist in his older brother, Hasan; also as the grandson of Muhammad. 
According to Vaglieri, the basis of the Shias&#x27; glorification of Husayn is his outstanding sacred and moral action and the noble ideals to which he sacrificed himself. From the belief that &quot;the Imams know all that was, that is, and that is to come, and that their knowledge does not increase with time,&quot; it is inferred that Husayn already knew the fate that awaited him and his followers. 
Hence, he left Mecca for Kufa, aware of his imminent sacrifice and yet without any hesitation or attempt to escape the will of God. A narration according to which Husayn was called by God to choose between sacrifice and Victory (with the help of an angel), gives even more value to his enterprise. About the reason for Husayn&#x27;s sacrifice in Shia sources Vaglieri write:
He is thus remembered as the prince of martyrs (&quot;Sayyed al-Shuhada&quot;). The historian G. R. Hawting describes the Battle of Karbala as a &quot;supreme&quot; example of &quot;suffering and martyrdom&quot; for Shi&#x27;as. According to Abdulaziz Sachedina, it is seen by Shi&#x27;as the climax of suffering and oppression, revenge for which came to be one of the primary goals of many Shi&#x27;a uprisings. This revenge is believed to be one of the fundamental objectives of the future revolution of the twelfth Shi&#x27;a Imam Muhammad al-Mahdi, whose return is awaited. With his return, Husayn and his seventy-two companions are expected to be resurrected along with their killers, who will then be punished.
Believing that Husayn wanted to redeem people from their sins with his blood, and that his action was &quot;a redemptive sacrifice for the salvation of the world&quot;, according to Vaglieri, is foreign to Shia belief; however it may have been penetrated to Shia ta&#x27;zieh and recent poems later on, since it is easy to make the transition from &quot;tawassul&quot; to this idea, or it may be influenced by Christian ideas.

Among the verses that interpreted by some Shia sources as referring to Husayn is (Qur&#x27;an 46:15) which talks about a pregnant mother, Fatima, the mother of Husayn, who suffers a lot, when God expressed his condolences to Muhammad about the fate of this grandson, and Muhammad expressed this to Fatima; thus she was very upset.
According to another narration, the mysterious letters of K.H.Y.A.S. at the beginning of the nineteenth chapter of the Qur&#x27;an (Maryam (surah)) refers to Husayn and his fate in Karbala, that was similar to the fate of John the Baptist who was also beheaded and his head was placed on a plate.
It is also narrated that Ali knew that Husayn would be killed in Karbala, and when he passed by this area, he stopped and cried, remembering Muhammad&#x27;s prophecy. Ali interpreted the name &quot;Karbala&quot; as &quot;Karb&quot; and &quot;bala&quot; meaning &quot;affliction&quot; and &quot;trial&quot;. The slain of Karbala will enter Paradise without any reckoning.

The traditional narration &quot;Every day is Ashura and every land is Karbala!&quot; is used by the Shi&#x27;a as a mantra to live their lives as Husayn did on Ashura, i.e. with complete sacrifice for God and for others. The saying is also intended to signify that what happened on Ashura in Karbala must always be remembered as part of suffering everywhere.

====Husayn&#x27;s head in Isma&#x27;ilism====
The Fatimid vizier Badr al-Jamali conquered Palestine under Caliph al-Mustansir Billah and discovered the head of Husayn in AH 448 (1056 AD). He constructed the minbar, a mosque and the &quot;mashhad&quot; at the place of burial, known as the Shrine of Husayn&#x27;s Head. The shrine was described as the most magnificent building in Ashkelon. During the British Mandate it was a &quot;large maqam on top of a hill&quot; with no tomb but a fragment of a pillar showing the place where the head had been buried. Israeli Defense Forces under Moshe Dayan blew up Mashhad Nabi Husayn in July 1950 as part of a broader operation. Around the year 2000, Isma&#x27;ilis from India built a marble platform there, on the grounds of the Barzilai Medical Center. The head remained buried in Ashkelon until 1153 (for about 250 years) only. Fearing the crusaders, Ashkelon&#x27;s ruler Sayf al-Mamlaka Tamim brought the head to Cairo on 31 August 1153 (8 Jumada al-Thani, AH 548).

===Ahl-e Haqq===
In the holy text of Yarsanism named &quot;Zolāl Zolāl&quot; is a long dialogue between angels Ruchiyar and Ayvat and their reincarnations. It is written in the book that the angel Ayvat incarnated into Husayn ibn Ali and after his death into an Yari saint named Baba Yadegar.

===Modern historical views on motivations of Husayn===
Vaglieri considers him to be motivated by ideology, saying that if the materials that have come down to us are authentic, they convey an image of person who is &quot;convinced that he was in the right, stubbornly determined to achieve his ends...&quot; Holding a similar view, Madelung has argued that Husayn was not a &quot;reckless rebel&quot; but a religious man motivated by pious convictions. According to him, Husayn was convinced that &quot;the family of the Prophet was divinely chosen to lead the community founded by Moḥammad, as the latter had been chosen, and had both an inalienable right and an obligation to seek this leadership.&quot; He was, however, not seeking martyrdom and wanted to return when his expected support did not materialize. Maria Dakake holds that Husayn considered the Umayyad rule oppressive and misguided, and revolted to reorient the Islamic community in the right direction. A similar view is held by Mahmoud Ayoub. S. M. Jafri proposes that Husayn, although motivated by ideology, did not intend to secure leadership for himself. Husayn, Jafri asserts, was from the start aiming for martyrdom in order to jolt the collective conscience of the Muslim community and reveal what he considers to be the oppressive and anti-Islamic nature of the Umayyad regime.

Others such as Wellhausen and Lammens, view his revolt as premature and ill-prepared, while others like Heinz Halm see it as a struggle for political leadership among the second generation of Muslims. Fred Donner, G. R. Hawting, and Hugh N. Kennedy consider Husayn&#x27;s revolt an attempt to regain what his brother Hasan had renounced.&quot;

==Legacy==
===Politics===
The first political use of the death of Husayn seems to have been during the revolt of Mukhtar, when he seized Kufa under the slogan of &quot;Revenge for Husayn&quot;. Although the Penitents had used the same slogan, they do not seem to have had a political program. In order to enhance their legitimacy, Abbasid rulers claimed to have avenged the death of Husayn by dethroning the Umayyads. During the early years of their rule, they also encouraged Muharram rituals. Buyids, a Shi&#x27;a dynasty originally from Iran which later occupied the Abbasid capital Baghdad while accepting the Abbasid caliph&#x27;s suzerainty, promoted the public rituals of Muharram to portray themselves as patrons of religion and to strengthen the Shi&#x27;a identity in Iraq. After taking over Iran in 1501, Safavids, who were previously a Sufi order, declared the state religion to be Twelver Shi&#x27;ism. In this regard, Karbala and Muharram rituals came to be a vehicle of Safavid propaganda and a means of consolidating the dynasty&#x27;s Shi&#x27;a identity. Riza Yildirim has claimed that the impetus of the Safvid revolution was the revenge of the death of Husayn. The founder of the dynasty, Shah Ismail, considered himself to be the Mahdi (the twelfth Shi&#x27;a Imam) or his forerunner. Similarly, Qajars also patronized Muharram rituals such as processions, &quot;taziya&quot; and &quot;majalis&quot;, to improve the relationship between the state and the public.

====Iranian Revolution====
Karbala and Shi&#x27;a symbolism played a significant role in the Iranian Revolution of 1979. In contrast to the traditional view of Shi&#x27;ism as a religion of suffering, mourning and political quietism, Shi&#x27;a Islam and Karbala were given a new interpretation in the period preceding the revolution by rationalist intellectuals and religious revisionists like Jalal Al-e-Ahmad, Ali Shariati and Nematollah Salehi Najafabadi. According to these, Shi&#x27;ism was an ideology of revolution and political struggle against tyranny and exploitation, and the Battle of Karbala and the death of Husayn was to be seen as a model for revolutionary struggle; weeping and mourning was to be replaced by political activism to realize the ideals of Husayn.

After the White Revolution reforms of the Iranian Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, which were opposed by the Iranian clergy and others, Ruhollah Khomeini labelled the Shah as the Yazid of his time. Shi&#x27;i beliefs and symbols were instrumental in orchestrating and sustaining widespread popular resistance with Husayn&#x27;s story providing a framework for labeling as evil and reacting against the Pahlavi Shah.
Condemning the Iranian monarchy, Khomeini wrote: &quot;The struggle of al-Husayn at Karbalâ is interpreted in the same way as a struggle against the non-Islamic principle of monarchy.&quot; Opposition to the Shah was thus compared with the opposition of Husayn to Yazid, and Muharram ritual gatherings became increasingly political in nature. According to Aghaie, the Shah&#x27;s hostility towards various Muharram rituals, which he considered to be uncivilized, contributed to his fall. The Islamic republic that was established after the revolution has since promoted Muharram rituals. The clerics encourage public participation in elections as a form of &quot;political activism&quot; comparable to that of Husayn. Martyrdom spirit influenced by the death of Husayn was frequently witnessed in Iranian troops during the Iran–Iraq war.

== In art and literature ==

===Literature===

Mir Mosharraf Hossain&#x27;s 19th century novel on Karbala, &quot;Bishad Sindhu&quot; (the Ocean of Sorrow), established the precedent of the Islamic epic in Bangali literature. South Asian philosopher and poet Muhammad Iqbal sees Husayn&#x27;s sacrifice as being similar to that of Ishmael and compares Yazid&#x27;s opposition to Husayn with the opposition of Pharaoh to Moses. Urdu poet Ghalib compares Husayn&#x27;s suffering with that of Mansur al-Hallaj, a tenth century Sufi, who was executed on a charge of claiming divinity.

====Maqtal literature and legendary accounts====
&quot;Maqtal&quot; (pl. &quot;Maqatil&quot;) works narrate the story of someone&#x27;s death. Although &quot;Maqatil&quot; on the deaths of Ali, Uthman and various others have been written, the &quot;Maqtal&quot; genre has focused mainly on the story of Husayn&#x27;s death.

As well as Abu Mikhnaf&#x27;s &quot;Maqtal&quot;, other Arabic &quot;Maqatil&quot; on Husayn were written. Most of these mix history with legend and have elaborate details on Husayn&#x27;s miraculous birth, which is stated to be on 10 Muharram, coinciding with his date of death. The universe as well as humanity are described as having been created on the day of &quot;Ashura&quot; (10 Muharram). &quot;Ashura&quot; is also asserted to have been the day of both Abraham&#x27;s and Muhammad&#x27;s birth and of the ascension of Jesus to heaven, and of numerous other events concerning prophets. Husayn is claimed to have performed various miracles, including quenching his companions&#x27; thirst by putting his thumb in their mouths and satisfying their hunger by bringing down food from the heavens, and to have killed several thousand Umayyad attackers. Other accounts claim that when Husayn died, his horse shed tears and killed many Umayyad soldiers; the sky became red and it rained blood; angels, jinns and wild animals wept; that light emanated from Husayn&#x27;s severed head and that it recited the Qur&#x27;an; and that all of his killers met calamitous end.

&quot;Maqtal&quot; later entered Persian, Turkish, and Urdu literature, and inspired the development of &quot;rawda&quot;.

====Marthiya and rawda====
When Shi&#x27;ism became the official religion of Iran in the 16th century, Safavid rulers such as Shah Tahmasp I, patronized poets who wrote about the Battle of Karbala. The genre of &quot;marthiya&quot; (poems in the memory of the dead, with popular forms of Karbala related &quot;marthiya&quot; being &quot;rawda&quot; and &quot;nawha&quot;), according to Persian scholar Wheeler Thackston, &quot;was particularly cultivated by the Safavids.&quot; Various Persian authors wrote texts retelling romanticized and synthesized versions of the battle and events from it, including Sa&#x27;id al-Din&#x27;s &quot;Rawdat al-Islam&quot; (The Garden of Islam) and Al-Khawarazmi&#x27;s &quot;Maqtal nur &#x27;al-&#x27;a&#x27;emmah&quot; (The Site of the Murder of the Light of the Imams). These influenced the composition of the more popular text &quot;Rawdat al-Shuhada&quot; (Garden of Martyrs), which was written in 1502 by Husain Wa&#x27;iz Kashefi. Kashefi&#x27;s composition was an effective factor in the development of &quot;rawda khwani&quot;, a ritual recounting of the battle events in &quot;majalis&quot;.

Inspired by &quot;Rawdat al-Shuhada&quot;, the Azerbaijani poet Fuzûlî wrote an abridged and simplified version of it in Ottoman Turkish in his work &quot;Hadiqat al-Su&#x27;ada&quot;. It influenced similar works in Albanian on the subject. Dalip Frashëri&#x27;s &quot;Kopshti i te Mirevet&quot; is the earliest, and longest epic so far, written in the Albanian language; the Battle of Karbala is described in detail and Frashëri eulogizes those who fell as martyrs, in particular Husayn.

Urdu &quot;marthiya&quot; is predominantly religious in nature and usually concentrates on lamenting the Battle of Karbala. South Indian rulers of Bijapur (Ali Adil Shah), and Golkonda Sultanate (Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah) were patrons of poetry and encouraged Urdu &quot;marthiya&quot; recitation in Muharram. Urdu &quot;marthiya&quot; afterwards became popular throughout India. Famous Urdu poets Mir Taqi Mir, Mirza Rafi Sauda, Mir Anees, and Mirza Salaamat Ali Dabeer have also composed &quot;marthiya&quot;. Comparing Karl Marx with Husayn, Josh Malihabadi argues that Karbala is not a story of the past to be recounted by the religious clerics in &quot;majalis&quot;, but should be seen as a model for revolutionary struggle towards the goal of a classless society and economic justice.

====Sufi poetry====
In Sufism, where annihilation of the self (&quot;nafs&quot;) and suffering in the path of God are paramount principles, Husayn is seen as a model Sufi. Persian Sufi poet Hakim Sanai describes Husayn as a martyr, higher in rank than all the other martyrs of the world; while Farid ud-Din Attar considers him a prototype of a Sufi who sacrificed himself in the love of God. Jalal ud-Din Rumi describes Husayn&#x27;s suffering at Karbala as a means to achieve union with the divine, and hence considers it to be a matter of jubilation rather than grief. Sindhi Sufi poet Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai devoted a section in his &quot;Shah Jo Risalo&quot; to the death of Husayn, in which the incident is remembered in laments and elegies. He too sees Husayn&#x27;s death as a sacrifice made in the path of God, and condemns Yazid as being bereft of divine love. Turkish Sufi Yunus Emre labels Husayn, along with his brother Hasan, as the &quot;fountain head of the martyrs&quot; and &quot;Kings of the Paradise&quot; in his songs.

<doc id="402593" wikidata="Q217442" url="?curid=402593" title="Yazid I">
<text>Yazid ibn Mu&#x27;awiya ibn Abi Sufyan (; 11 November 683), commonly known as Yazid I, was the second caliph of the Umayyad Caliphate, ruling from April 680 until his death in November 683. His appointment by his father Mu&#x27;awiya I () was the first hereditary succession to the caliphate in Islamic history. His caliphate was marked by the death of Muhammad&#x27;s grandson Husayn ibn Ali and the start of the crisis known as the Second Fitna.

During his father&#x27;s caliphate, Yazid led several campaigns against the Byzantine Empire, including an attack on the Byzantine capital, Constantinople. Yazid&#x27;s nomination as heir apparent in (56 AH) by Mu&#x27;awiya was opposed by several Muslim grandees from the Hejaz region, including Husayn and Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr. The two men refused to recognize Yazid following his accession and took sanctuary in Mecca. When Husayn left for Kufa in Iraq to lead a revolt against Yazid, he was killed with his small band of supporters by Yazid&#x27;s forces in the Battle of Karbala. Husayn&#x27;s death caused resentment in the Hejaz, where Ibn al-Zubayr called for a consultative assembly to elect a new caliph. The people of Medina, who supported Ibn al-Zubayr, held other grievances toward the Umayyads. After failing to gain the allegiance of Ibn al-Zubayr and the people of the Hejaz through diplomacy, Yazid sent an army to suppress their rebellion. The army defeated the Medinese in the Battle of al-Harra in August 683 and the city was sacked. Afterward, Mecca was besieged for several weeks until the army withdrew as a result of Yazid&#x27;s death in November 683. The Caliphate fell into a nearly decade-long civil war, ending with the establishment of the Marwanid dynasty (the Umayyad caliph Marwan I and his descendants).

Yazid continued Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s decentralized model of governance, relying on his provincial governors and the tribal nobility. He abandoned Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s ambitious raids against the Byzantine Empire and strengthened Syria&#x27;s military defences. No new territories were conquered during his reign. Yazid is considered an illegitimate ruler and a tyrant by many Muslims due to his hereditary succession, the death of Husayn, and his attack on Medina. Modern historians take a milder view, and consider him a capable ruler, albeit less successful than his father.

==Early life==
Yazid was born in Syria. His year of birth is uncertain, placed between 642 and 649. His father was Mu&#x27;awiya ibn Abi Sufyan, then governor of Syria under Caliph Uthman (). Mu&#x27;awiya and Uthman belonged to the wealthy Umayyad clan of the Quraysh tribe, a grouping of Meccan clans to which the Islamic prophet Muhammad and all the preceding caliphs belonged. Yazid&#x27;s mother, Maysun, was the daughter of Bahdal ibn Unayf, a chieftain of the powerful Bedouin tribe of Banu Kalb. She was a Christian, like most of her tribe. Yazid grew up with his maternal Kalbite kin, spending the springs of his youth in the Syrian Desert; for the remainder of the year he was in the company of the Greek and native Syrian courtiers of his father, who became caliph in 661.

During his father&#x27;s caliphate, Yazid led several campaigns against the Byzantine Empire, which the Caliphate had been trying to conquer, including an attack on the Byzantine capital, Constantinople. Sources give several dates for this between 49 AH (669–70 CE) and 55 AH (674–75 CE). Muslim sources offer few details of his role in the campaigns, possibly downplaying his involvement due to the controversies of his later career. He is portrayed in these sources as having been unwilling to participate in the expedition to the chagrin of Mu&#x27;awiya, who then forced him to comply. However, two eighth-century non-Muslim sources from al-Andalus (Islamic Spain), the Chronicle of 741 and the Chronicle of 754, both of which likely drew their material from an earlier Arabic work, report that Yazid besieged Constantinople with a 100,000-strong army. Unable to conquer the city, the army captured adjacent towns, acquired considerable loot, and retreated after two years. Yazid also led the hajj (the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca) on several occasions.

==Nomination as caliph==
The third caliph Uthman drew the ire of the Muslim settlers of the conquered lands as a consequence of his controversial policies, which were seen by many as nepotistic and interfering in provincial affairs. In 656 he was killed by the provincial rebels in Medina, then capital of the Caliphate, after which Ali, the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad, was recognized as caliph by the Medinese people and the rebels. In the consequent first Islamic civil war (656–661), Mu&#x27;awiya opposed Ali from his stronghold in Syria, fighting him to a stalemate at the Battle of Siffin in 657. In January 661 Ali was assassinated by a Kharijite (a faction opposed to Ali and Mu&#x27;awiya), after which his son Hasan was recognized as his successor. In August, Mu&#x27;awiya, who had already been recognized as caliph by his partisans in Syria, led his army toward Kufa, the capital of Hasan and Ali in Iraq, and gained control over the rest of the Caliphate by securing a peace treaty with Hasan. The terms of the treaty stipulated that Mu&#x27;awiya would not nominate a successor. Although the treaty brought a temporary peace, no framework of succession was established.

Mu&#x27;awiya was determined to install Yazid as his successor. The idea was scandalous to Muslims, as hereditary succession had no precedent in Islamic history—earlier caliphs had been elected either by popular support in Medina or by the consultation of the senior companions of Muhammad—and according to Islamic principles, the position of ruler was not the private property of a ruler to award to his descendants. It was also unacceptable by Arab custom, according to which the rulership should not pass from father to son but within the wider clan. According to the orientalist Bernard Lewis, the &quot;only precedents available to Mu&#x27;āwiya from Islamic history were election and civil war. The former was unworkable; the latter had obvious drawbacks.&quot; Mu&#x27;awiya passed over his eldest son Abd Allah, who was from his Qurayshite wife, perhaps due to the stronger support Yazid had in Syria because of his Kalbite parentage. The Banu Kalb was dominant in southern Syria and led the larger tribal confederation of Quda&#x27;a. The Quda&#x27;a were established in Syria long before Islam and had acquired significant military experience and familiarity with hierarchical order under the Byzantines, as opposed to the more free-spirited tribesmen of Arabia and Iraq. Northern Syria, on the other hand, was dominated by the tribal confederation of Qays, which had immigrated there during Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s reign, and resented the privileged position of the Kalb in the Umayyad court. By appointing Yazid to lead campaigns against the Byzantines, Mu&#x27;awiya may have sought to foster support for Yazid from the northern tribesmen. The policy had limited success as the Qays opposed the nomination of Yazid, at least in the beginning, for he was &quot;the son of a Kalbi woman&quot;. In the Hejaz (western Arabia, where Medina and Mecca are located and where the old Muslim elite resided), Yazid had support among his Umayyad kinsmen, but there were other members of the Hejazi nobility whose approval was important. By appointing Yazid to lead the hajj rituals there, Mu&#x27;awiya may have hoped to enlist support for Yazid&#x27;s succession and elevate his status as a Muslim leader. According to Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani (), Mu&#x27;awiya had also employed poets to influence public opinion in favour of Yazid&#x27;s succession.

According to the account of Ibn Athir (), Mu&#x27;awiya summoned a (consultative assembly) of influential men from all of the provinces to his capital, Damascus, in 676 and won their support through flattery, bribes, and threats. He then ordered his Umayyad kinsman Marwan ibn al-Hakam, the governor of Medina, to inform its people of his decision. Marwan faced resistance, especially from Ali&#x27;s son and Muhammad&#x27;s grandson Husayn, and Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, Abd Allah ibn Umar, and Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr, all sons of prominent companions of Muhammad, who, by virtue of their descent, could also lay claim to the caliphal office. Mu&#x27;awiya went to Medina and pressed the four dissenters to accede, but they fled to Mecca. He followed and threatened some of them with death, but to no avail. Nonetheless, he was successful in convincing the people of Mecca that the four had pledged their allegiance, and received the Meccans&#x27; allegiance for Yazid. On his way back to Damascus, he secured allegiance from the people of Medina. General recognition of the nomination thus forced Yazid&#x27;s opponents into silence. The orientalist Julius Wellhausen doubted the story, holding that the reports of the nomination&#x27;s rejection by prominent Medinese were a back-projection of the events that followed Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s death. A similar opinion is held by the historian Andrew Marsham. According to the account of al-Tabari (), Mu&#x27;awiya announced the nomination in 676 and only received delegations from the Iraqi garrison town of Basra, which pledged allegiance to Yazid in Damascus in 679 or 680. According to al-Ya&#x27;qubi (), Mu&#x27;awiya demanded allegiance for Yazid on the occasion of the hajj. All, except the four prominent Muslims mentioned above, complied. No force was used against them. In any case, Mu&#x27;awiya arranged a general recognition for Yazid&#x27;s succession before his death.

==Reign==
Mu&#x27;awiya died in April 680. According to al-Tabari, Yazid was at his residence in Huwwarin, located between Damascus and Palmyra, at the time of his father&#x27;s death. According to verses of Yazid preserved in Isfahani&#x27;s , a collection of Arabic poetry, Yazid was away on a summertime expedition against the Byzantines when he received the news of Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s final illness. Based on this and the fact that Yazid arrived in Damascus only after Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s death, the historian Henri Lammens has rejected the reports of Yazid being in Huwwarin. Mu&#x27;awiya entrusted supervision of the government to his most loyal associates, Dahhak ibn Qays al-Fihri and Muslim ibn Uqba al-Murri, until Yazid&#x27;s return. He left a will for Yazid, instructing him on matters of governing the Caliphate. He was advised to beware Husayn and Ibn al-Zubayr, for they could challenge his rule, and instructed to defeat them if they did. Yazid was further advised to treat Husayn with caution and not to spill his blood, since he was the grandson of Muhammad. Ibn al-Zubayr, on the other hand, was to be treated harshly, unless he came to terms.

===Oaths of allegiance===
Upon his accession, Yazid requested and received oaths of allegiance from the governors of the provinces. He wrote to the governor of Medina, his cousin Walid ibn Utba ibn Abi Sufyan, informing him of Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s death and instructing him to secure allegiance from Husayn, Ibn al-Zubayr, and Ibn Umar. The instructions contained in the letter were:

Walid sought the advice of Marwan, who suggested that Ibn al-Zubayr and Husayn be forced to pay allegiance as they were dangerous, while Ibn Umar should be left alone as he posed no threat. Husayn answered Walid&#x27;s summon, meeting Walid and Marwan in a semi-private meeting where he was informed of Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s death and Yazid&#x27;s accession. When asked for his oath of allegiance, Husayn responded that giving his allegiance in private would be insufficient and suggested the oath be made in public. Walid agreed, but Marwan insisted that Husayn be detained until he proffered allegiance. Husayn scolded Marwan and left to join his armed retinue, who were waiting nearby in case the authorities attempted to apprehend him. Immediately following Husayn&#x27;s exit, Marwan admonished Walid, who in turn justified his refusal to harm Husayn by dint of the latter&#x27;s close relation to Muhammad. Ibn al-Zubayr did not answer the summons and left for Mecca. Walid sent eighty horsemen after him, but he escaped. Husayn too left for Mecca shortly after, without having sworn allegiance to Yazid. Dissatisfied with this failure, Yazid replaced Walid with his distant Umayyad kinsman Amr ibn Sa&#x27;id. Unlike Husayn and Ibn al-Zubayr, Ibn Umar, Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr, and Abd Allah ibn Abbas, who had also previously denounced Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s nomination of Yazid, paid allegiance to him.

===Battle of Karbala===
In Mecca Husayn received letters from pro-Alid Kufans, inviting him to lead them in revolt against Yazid. Husayn subsequently sent his cousin Muslim ibn Aqil to assess the situation in the city. He also sent letters to Basra, but his messenger was handed over to the governor Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad and killed. Ibn Aqil informed Husayn of the large-scale support he found in Kufa, signalling that the latter should enter the city. Informed by some Kufan tribal chiefs () of the goings-on, Yazid replaced the governor of Kufa, Nu&#x27;man ibn Bashir al-Ansari, who had been unwilling to take action against pro-Alid activity, with Ibn Ziyad, whom he ordered to execute or imprison Ibn Aqil. As a result of Ibn Ziyad&#x27;s suppression and political maneuvering, Ibn Aqil&#x27;s following began to dissipate and he was forced to declare the revolt prematurely. It was suppressed and Ibn Aqil was executed.

Encouraged by Ibn Aqil&#x27;s letter, Husayn left for Kufa, ignoring warnings from Ibn Umar and Ibn Abbas. The latter reminded him, to no avail, of the Kufans&#x27; previous abandonment of his father Ali and his brother Hasan. On the way to the city, he received news of Ibn Aqil&#x27;s death. Nonetheless, he continued his march towards Kufa. Ibn Ziyad&#x27;s 4,000-strong army blocked his entry into the city and forced him to camp in the desert of Karbala. Ibn Ziyad would not let Husayn pass without submitting, which Husayn refused to do. Week-long negotiations failed, and in the ensuing hostilities on 10 October 680, Husayn and 72 of his male companions were slain, while his family was taken prisoner. The captives and Husayn&#x27;s severed head were sent to Yazid. According to the accounts of Abu Mikhnaf () and Ammar al-Duhni (), Yazid poked Husayn&#x27;s head with his staff, although others ascribe this action to Ibn Ziyad. Yazid treated the captives well and sent them back to Medina after a few days.

===Revolt of Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr===

Following Husayn&#x27;s death, Yazid faced increased opposition to his rule from Ibn al-Zubayr who declared him deposed. Although publicly he called for a to elect a new caliph, in secret Ibn al-Zubayr let his partisans pay allegiance to him. At first, Yazid attempted to placate him by sending gifts and delegations in an attempt to reach a settlement. After Ibn al-Zubayr&#x27;s refusal to recognize him, Yazid sent a force led by Ibn al-Zubayr&#x27;s estranged brother Amr to arrest him. The force was defeated and Amr was taken captive and executed. As well as Ibn al-Zubayr&#x27;s growing influence in Medina, the city&#x27;s inhabitants were disillusioned with Umayyad rule and Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s agricultural projects, which included the confiscation of their lands to boost government revenue. Yazid invited the notables of Medina to Damascus and tried to win them over with gifts. They were unpersuaded and on their return to Medina narrated tales of Yazid&#x27;s lavish lifestyle. Accusations included Yazid drinking wine, hunting with hounds, and his love for music. The Medinese, under the leadership of Abd Allah ibn Hanzala, renounced their allegiance to Yazid and expelled the governor, Yazid&#x27;s cousin Uthman ibn Muhammad ibn Abi Sufyan, and the Umayyads residing in the city. Yazid dispatched a 12,000-strong army under the command of Muslim ibn Uqba to reconquer the Hejaz. After failed negotiations, the Medinese were defeated in the Battle of al-Harra. According to the accounts of Abu Mikhnaf and al-Samhudi (d. 1533), the city was sacked, whereas per the account of Awana (d. 764) only the ringleaders of the rebellion were executed. Having forced the rebels to renew their allegiance, Yazid&#x27;s army headed for Mecca to subdue Ibn al-Zubayr. Ibn Uqba died on the way to Mecca and command passed to Husayn ibn Numayr al-Sakuni, who besieged Mecca in September 683. The siege lasted for several weeks, during which the Ka&#x27;ba, the sacred Muslim shrine at the center of the Mecca Mosque, caught fire. Yazid&#x27;s sudden death in November 683 ended the campaign and Ibn Numayr retreated to Syria with his army.

===Domestic affairs and foreign campaigns===
The style of Yazid&#x27;s governance was, by and large, a continuation of the model developed by Mu&#x27;awiya. He continued to rely on the governors of the provinces and , as Mu&#x27;awiya had, instead of relatives. He retained several of Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s officials, including Ibn Ziyad, who was Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s governor of Basra, and Sarjun ibn Mansur, a native Syrian Christian, who had served as the head of the fiscal administration under Mu&#x27;awiya. Like Mu&#x27;awiya, Yazid received delegations of tribal notables () from the provinces to win their support, which would also involve distributing gifts and bribes. The structure of the caliphal administration and military remained decentralised as in Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s time. Provinces retained much of their tax revenue and forwarded a small portion to the Caliph. The military units in the provinces were derived from local tribes whose command also fell to the .
Yazid approved a decrease in taxes on the Arab Christian tribe of Najran upon their request, but abolished the special tax exemption of the ethno-religious community of Samaritans, which had been granted to them by previous caliphs as a reward for their aid to the Muslim conquerors. He improved the irrigation system of the fertile lands of the Ghouta near Damascus by digging a canal that became known as .

Toward the end of his reign, Mu&#x27;awiya reached a thirty-year peace agreement with the Byzantines, obliging the Caliphate to pay an annual tribute of 3,000 gold coins, 50 horses, and 50 slaves, and to withdraw Muslim troops from the forward bases they had occupied on the island of Rhodes and the Anatolian coast. Under Yazid, Muslim bases along the Sea of Marmara were abandoned. In contrast to the far-reaching raids against the Byzantine Empire launched under his father, Yazid focused on stabilizing the border with Byzantium. In order to improve Syria&#x27;s military defences and prevent Byzantine incursions, Yazid established the northern Syrian frontier district of Qinnasrin from what had been a part of Hims, and garrisoned it.

Yazid reappointed Uqba ibn Nafi, the conqueror of the central North African region of Ifriqiya whom Mu&#x27;awiya had deposed, as governor of Ifriqiya. In 681, Uqba launched a large-scale expedition into western North Africa. Defeating the Berbers and the Byzantines, Uqba reached the Atlantic coast and captured Tangier and Volubilis. He was unable to establish permanent control in these territories. On his return to Ifriqiya, he was ambushed and killed by a Berber–Byzantine force at the Battle of Vescera, resulting in the loss of the conquered territories. In 681 Yazid appointed Ibn Ziyad&#x27;s brother Salm ibn Ziyad as the governor of the northeastern border province of Khurasan. Salm led several campaigns in Transoxiana (Central Asia) and raided Samarqand and Khwarazm, but without gaining a permanent foothold in any of them. Yazid&#x27;s death in 683 and the subsequent chaos in the east ended the campaigns.

==Death and succession==
Yazid died on 11 November 683 in the central Syrian desert town of Huwwarin, his favourite residence, aged between 35 and 43, and was buried there. Early annalists like Abu Ma&#x27;shar al-Madani (d. 778) and al-Waqidi (d. 823) do not give any details about his death. This lack of information seems to have inspired fabrication of accounts by authors with anti-Umayyad leanings, which detail several causes of death, including a horse fall, excessive drinking, pleurisy, and burning. According to the verses by a contemporary poet Ibn Arada, who at the time resided in Khurasan, Yazid died in his bed with a wine cup by his side.

Ibn al-Zubayr subsequently declared himself caliph and Iraq and Egypt came under his rule. In Syria, Yazid&#x27;s son Mu&#x27;awiya II, whom he had nominated, became caliph. His control was limited to parts of Syria as most of the Syrian districts (Hims, Qinnasrin, and Palestine) were controlled by allies of Ibn al-Zubayr. Mu&#x27;awiya II died after a few months from an unknown illness. Several early sources state that he abdicated before his death. Following his death, Yazid&#x27;s maternal Kalbite tribesmen, seeking to maintain their privileges, sought to install Yazid&#x27;s son Khalid on the throne, but he was considered too young for the post by the non-Kalbites in the pro-Umayyad coalition. Consequently, Marwan ibn al-Hakam was acknowledged as caliph in a of pro-Umayyad tribes in June 684. Shortly after, Marwan and the Kalb routed the pro-Zubayrid forces in Syria led by Dahhak at the Battle of Marj Rahit. Although the pro-Umayyad stipulated that Khalid would succeed Marwan, the latter nominated his son Abd al-Malik as his heir. Thus the Sufyanid house, named after Mu&#x27;awiya I&#x27;s father Abu Sufyan, was replaced by the Marwanid house of the Umayyad dynasty. By 692 Abd al-Malik had defeated Ibn al-Zubayr and restored Umayyad authority across the Caliphate.

==Legacy==
The killing of Muhammad&#x27;s grandson Husayn caused widespread outcry among Muslims and the image of Yazid suffered greatly. It also helped crystallize opposition to Yazid into an anti-Umayyad movement based on Alid aspirations, and contributed to the development of Shia identity, whereby the party of Alid partisans was transformed into a religious sect with distinct rituals and memory. After the Battle of Karbala, Shia imams from Husayn&#x27;s line adopted the policy of political quietism.

===Traditional Muslim view===
Yazid is considered an evil figure by many Muslims to the present day, not only by the Shia, who hold that the ruling position rightly belonged to Husayn&#x27;s father Ali and his descendants, including Husayn, whom Yazid killed to strip him of his right, but also by many Sunnis, to whom he was an affront to Islamic values. For the Shia, Yazid is an epitome of evil. He is annually reviled in the Ashura processions and passion plays, and rulers considered tyrannical and oppressive are often equated with him. Before the Iranian Revolution, the Shah of Iran was called the &quot;Yazid of his time&quot; by the Iranian cleric Rouhollah Khomeini, as was the Iraqi president Saddam Hussein by the Iraqi Shia during the Iran–Iraq War for his ban on pilgrimages to the holy sites of Shia Islam. Among the Sunnis, the Hanafi school allows cursing of Yazid, whereas the Hanbali school and many in the Shafi&#x27;i school maintain that no judgment should be passed on Yazid, rather tyrants in general should be cursed. However, the Hanbali scholar Ibn al-Jawzi () encouraged the cursing. According to al-Ghazali (), cursing Yazid is prohibited, for he was a Muslim and his role in the killing of Husayn is unverified.

Yazid was the first person in the history of the Caliphate to be nominated as heir based on a blood relationship, and this became a tradition afterwards. As such, his accession is considered by the Muslim historical tradition as the corruption of the caliphate into a kingship. He is depicted as a tyrant who was responsible for three major crimes during his caliphate: the death of Husayn and his followers at Karbala, considered a massacre; the aftermath of the Battle of al-Harra, in which Yazid&#x27;s troops sacked Medina; and the burning of the Ka&#x27;ba during the siege of Mecca, which is blamed on Yazid&#x27;s commander Husayn ibn Numayr. The tradition stresses his habits of drinking, dancing, hunting, and keeping pet animals such as dogs and monkeys, portraying him as impious and unworthy of leading the Muslim community. Extant contemporary Muslim histories describe Yazid as &quot;a sinner in respect of his belly and his private parts&quot;, &quot;an arrogant drunken sot&quot;, and &quot;motivated by defiance of God, lack of faith in His religion and hostility toward His Messenger&quot;. Al-Baladhuri () described him as the &quot;commander of the sinners&quot; (), as opposed to the title commander of the faithful () usually applied to the caliphs. Nevertheless, some historians have argued that there is a tendency in early Muslim sources to exonerate Yazid of blame for Husayn&#x27;s death, and put the blame squarely on Ibn Ziyad. According to the historian James Lindsay, the Syrian historian Ibn Asakir () attempted to stress Yazid&#x27;s positive qualities, while accepting the allegations that are generally made against him. Ibn Asakir thus emphasised that Yazid was a transmitter of hadith (the sayings and traditions attributed to Muhammad), a virtuous man &quot;by reason of his connection to the age of the Prophet&quot;, and worthy of the ruling position.

===Modern scholarly view===
Despite his reputation in religious circles, academic historians generally portray a more favourable view of Yazid. According to Wellhausen, Yazid was a mild ruler, who resorted to violence only when necessary, and was not the tyrant that the religious tradition portrays him to be. He further notes that Yazid lacked interest in public affairs as a prince, but as a caliph &quot;he seems to have pulled himself together, although he did not give up his old predilections,—wine, music, the chase and other sport&quot;. In the view of the historian Hugh N. Kennedy, despite the disasters of Karbala and al-Harra, Yazid&#x27;s rule was &quot;not devoid of achievement&quot;. His reputation might have improved had he lived longer, but his early death played a part in sticking of the stigma of &quot;the shocks of the early part of his reign&quot;. According to the Islamicist G. R. Hawting, Yazid tried to continue the diplomatic policies of his father but, unlike Mu&#x27;awiya, he was not successful in winning over the opposition with gifts and bribes. In Hawting&#x27;s summation, &quot;the image of Muʿāwiya as operating more like a tribal than a traditional Middle Eastern despot ... also seems applicable to Yazīd&quot;. In the view of Lewis, Yazid was a capable ruler &quot;with much of the ability of his father&quot; but was overly criticized by later Arab historians. Expressing a viewpoint similar to Wellhausen&#x27;s, Lammens remarked, &quot;a poet himself, and fond of music, he was a Maecenas of poets and artists&quot;.

The characterization of Yazid in the Muslim sources has been attributed to the hostility of the Abbasid dynasty, during whose rule the histories were written, toward the Umayyads, whom they toppled in 750. Most reports in the traditional Muslim sources focus on the revolts against Yazid, and usually lack detail on his public life in Syria and his activities other than the suppression of the revolts. Lammens has attributed this to the tendency of the Iraq-based, Abbasid-era chroniclers to portray a caliph, under whom Husayn was killed and the holy cities of Islam were attacked, only as an impious drunkard. In contrast, a Syrian source preserved in the Chronicle of 741 describes the Caliph as &quot;a most pleasant man and deemed highly agreeable by all the peoples subject to his rule. He never, as is the wont of men, sought glory for himself because of his royal rank, but lived as a citizen along with all the common people.&quot;

===Yazidism===
In the Yazidi religion, practiced by the mainly Iraq-based Kurdish-speaking ethno-religious community of Yazidis, Sultan Ezid is a highly revered divine figure. Most modern historians hold that the name Ezid derives from the name of Caliph Yazid. In Yazidi religious lore, there is no trace of any link between Sultan Ezid and the second Umayyad caliph. A pro-Umayyad movement particularly sympathetic towards Yazid existed in the Kurdish mountains before the 12th century, when Shaykh Adi, a Sufi of Umayyad descent venerated by Yazidis to this day, settled there and attracted a following among the adherents of the movement. The name Yazidi seems to have been applied to the group because of his Umayyad origins.

==Coins and inscriptions==
A Sasanian-style silver coin bearing the mint date as &quot;Year I of Yazid&quot; has been reported. The obverse side shows the portrait of the Sasanian king Khosrow II () and his name in the Pahlavi script. The reverse has the usual Zoroastrian fire altar surrounded by attendants. The margins, however, contain the inscription that it was minted during the first year of Yazid&#x27;s reign. An anonymous coin from the Nishapur mint bearing the mint date 60, which is assumed to be the Hijri year, is also thought to be from Yazid&#x27;s first regnal year. Other coins from his reign usually have only the name of the governor of the province where the coin originated. Coins bearing the name of the counter-caliph Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr have also been found from the provinces of Fars and Kirman, dated between 61 and 63 (681–683 CE), although Ibn al-Zubayr did not publicly claim the caliphate until after the death of Yazid. This may show that as well as the challenges to his rule in Arabia and Iraq, Yazid&#x27;s authority was also challenged in southern Persia from roughly the time of his accession. The coins were probably minted in the name of Ibn al-Zubayr to lend legitimacy to the challengers of the Umayyads by using a suitable Qurayshite name.

Yazid is thought to be mentioned in a short, undated Paleo-Arabic Christian graffito known as the Yazid inscription. It reads &quot;May God be mindful of Yazid the king&quot;.

==Wives and children==
Yazid married three women and had several concubines. The names of two of his wives are known: Umm Khalid Fakhita bint Abi Hisham and Umm Kulthum, a daughter of the veteran commander and statesman Abd Allah ibn Amir. Fakhita and Umm Kulthum both hailed from the Abd Shams, the parent clan of the Umayyads.

Yazid had three sons from his wives. His eldest, Mu&#x27;awiya II, was between 17 and 23 years old at the time of Yazid&#x27;s death. The name of Mu&#x27;awiya II&#x27;s mother is unknown, but she was from the Banu Kalb. Ill health prevented him from carrying out the caliphal duties and he rarely left his residence. He survived his father only by a few months and died without leaving any offspring. Yazid&#x27;s second son, Khalid, was from Fakhita, and was born circa 668. Marwan married Fakhita after becoming caliph, to foster an alliance with the Sufyanid house and neutralize her son Khalid&#x27;s claim to the caliphate. He remained quiet about being sidelined from the succession, although a legendary report says that he protested to Marwan, who in turn insulted him. He had friendly relations with Abd al-Malik, whose daughter he married. Several legendary accounts report Khalid being interested in alchemy and having ordered the translation of Greek works on alchemy, astronomy, and medicine into Arabic. Yazid&#x27;s daughter Atika was the favourite wife of Abd al-Malik. They had several children, including the future Caliph Yazid II (). Yazid&#x27;s son Abd Allah, from Umm Kulthum, was a famed archer and horseman. Yazid had several other sons from slave women.
