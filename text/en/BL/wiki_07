<text>Shih Ming-teh (; 15 January 1941 – 15 January 2024), commonly known as Nori Shih, was a Taiwanese statesman and human rights defender. He was once a political prisoner for 25-and-a-half years.

Arrested at the age of 21 in 1962 and charged with creating the &quot;Taiwan Independence League&quot; (a study group) with the intention of overthrowing the Kuomintang government, Shih was sentenced to life imprisonment. The sentence was commuted to 15 years in 1975, and Shih was released on 16 June 1977.

Shih promptly joined the &quot;Tangwai&quot; (literally meaning &quot;outside the party&quot;, because the Kuomintang was the only legally existing political party in Taiwan at that time), became a reporter for the &quot;Liberty Times&quot; and married the American researcher Linda Gail Arrigo. After he played a part in organizing the 10 December 1979 pro-democracy rally subsequently known as the Kaohsiung Incident (also known as the Formosa Incident or Meilitao Incident), an arrest warrant was issued charging Shih with treason, and following 26 days on the run he was again arrested and sentenced to life in prison. In 1984, while he was incarcerated, Polish politician and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Lech Wałęsa nominated him for the Peace Prize.

In July 1987, Chiang Ching-kuo lifted martial law and offered an amnesty to Shih, but he refused to accept. On 20 May 1990 he was finally released. In total, he spent 25 years in prison, 13 years in solitary confinement and over 4 years on hunger strike.

In 1993, he was elected leader of the legalized opposition Democratic Progressive Party. He was also elected legislator on three occasions. Shih proposed a political &quot;grand reconciliation&quot; in Taiwan. He resigned from the Democratic Progressive Party on 14 November 2000.

In 2006, Shih carried out a huge protest, known as Million Voices Against Corruption, President Chen Must Go, in an effort to force the embattled president Chen Shui-bian to resign. He led a round-the-clock sit-in in front of the Presidential Building and Taipei Railway Station in Taipei City, pledging to remain there until President Chen resigned, or he reached the end of his term in March 2008. On 5 December 2006, he left Taipei Railway Station pledging to continue the protest alone in &quot;self-reclusion&quot; at an apartment nearby. This protest ended April 2007.

Shih was one of the most prominent personalities of the &quot;Tangwai&quot; movement and greatly contributed to Taiwan&#x27;s democratization. He has been referred to by some as &quot;Taiwan&#x27;s Mandela&quot; on account of his efforts for democracy and prolonged incarceration.

== Early life ==
Shih Ming-teh&#x27;s father Shih Kuo-tsui was a well-known practitioner of Chinese medicine.

In February 1947, Shih Ming-teh witnessed at Kaohsiung Station that would later be known as the February 28 Incident. The student leaders of schools were charged as instigators and some were executed as riots broke out. Students seized weapons from the Harbor Garrison and exchanged fire with the guards.

Shih entered Kaohsiung&#x27;s Chung-Cheng Senior High in 1957. In 1959, after failing to pass his college entrance exam, he signed up with the ROC Army, passing the admission exams for the artillery school. On occasion he vowed in public to overthrow the ROC government by force, through an armed coup d&#x27;état as an army officer. That same year, his girlfriend gave birth to a daughter when he was 19.

Shih briefly served as an artillery officer in Kinmen.

== First imprisonment: 1962–1977 ==
In 1962 Shih was arrested for alleged involvement in the &quot;Formosa Independence Movement&quot;; over 30 more accomplices, mostly army school and university students, were also arrested. Shih&#x27;s two brothers, poet and painter Shih Ming-cheng and medical school student Shih Ming-hsiung were among them.

In 1964 Shih was sentenced to life imprisonment for orchestrating the independence movement. He was also stripped of his civil rights for life. Shih was roughed up and suffered the loss of his teeth and spinal damage at the age of 22.

The Kuomintang regime considered outspoken Shih as a highly dangerous political criminal and therefore prevented him from doing any forced labor that would put him in contact with the world outside prison. This gave him time to do research and study. Shih focused on philosophy, history, international law, linguistics and Japanese. He also developed a strong and resolute personality in prison.

In the 1970s, Taiwan&#x27;s government suffered several blows to its international status. First, its seat at the United Nations was taken over by the People&#x27;s Republic of China, then the United States established official ties with Beijing, severing those with Taipei. A rebellion in the Taiyuan prison, where many of the inmates were political prisoners, was planned. Access to the Taitung radio station and a publicly broadcast declaration of Taiwan&#x27;s independence from China was one of their goals. Many pro-independence prisoners took part in the plot. On 8 February 1970 five prisoners murdered a guard and tried to take his gun. Ultimately the five inmates broke from prison, only to be caught soon after. The breakout plot was foiled. The Kuomintang believed Shih was one of the masterminds of the uprising and therefore kept him in isolation during his time in Taiyuan. To this day, the investigation documents are still kept confidential and the implication of Shih was disputed by Shih himself, who sued Lin Shu-chi for defamation.

In 1974, after 12 years of imprisonment, Shih&#x27;s first wife Chen Li-chu asked for a divorce. She had had an affair with one of Shih&#x27;s friends, who had been released before Shih. In 1975, when president Chiang Kai-shek died, his son Chiang Ching-kuo succeeded him as KMT Chairman. Under his rule, a leniency policy was implemented. On 16 June 1977, Shih was released after serving only 15 years of a life sentence.

== Leader of the Kaohsiung Incident ==
During Chiang Ching-kuo&#x27;s presidency, political opposition to the Kuomintang was suppressed. After Peter Huang&#x27;s attempt to assassinate Chiang proved unsuccessful, the KMT became more aware of opposition. Shih Ming-teh created a &quot;party without a name&quot; amidst the absence of freedom of association in Taiwan at that time. In September 1978 Shih became active in the &quot;Tangwai&quot; movement. In May 1979 this group of non-Kuomintang activists established the &quot;Meilitao Magazine,&quot; of which Shih was named general manager. During this time, he adopted the English nickname &quot;Nori&quot;, after the Japanese pronunciation of the second Chinese character in his given name, &quot;Teh&quot;. For historical reasons, this nickname served as a shibboleth to enrage &quot;Waishengren&quot; people in Taiwan (mainlanders whose ancestors fought the Japanese), and endear him to the &quot;benshengren&quot; (less-recent Hokkien migrants disenfranchised by the Waishengren, and who have a more positive view of Japanese colonization). On 10 December 1979, the &quot;Tangwai&quot; group commemorated Human Rights Day in Kaohsiung. The rally operated without prior approval, with specific stipulations that no torches and weapons were allowed. Police intervened and clashed with the protestors resulting in various damage. The event would be known as the Kaohsiung Incident, a milestone in Taiwan&#x27;s democratization process.

Three days later, Shih dramatically escaped: Chang Wen-ying, then a dentist and later Mayor of Taichung City, performed plastic surgery on Shih to change his looks so he could escape overseas. Shih was later caught along with the dentist, and sentenced to life in prison for the second time.

During the 1980 Meilitao Incident trials Shih was defiant and proud facing a potentially fatal court-martial decision. He declared during his defense: &quot;Taiwan should be independent, in fact, it already is, it has been for 30 years and currently it is known as the Republic of China&quot;. Shih also demanded an end to the political monopoly of the Kuomintang, the control of the Taiwanese press, and martial law, so that the 30-plus-year rubber-stamping legislative session could be dissolved.

== Second imprisonment and hunger strike: 1980–1990 ==
In 1983, one of Shih&#x27;s allies, Chen Wen-chen, was murdered; Shih Ming-teh began a 1-month hunger strike to protest what he believed to be an assassination ordered by the secret police.

Polish union leader Lech Wałęsa (Nobel Peace 1983) nominated Shih Ming-teh for the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize..

In 1985, Shih commenced an indefinite hunger strike. He demanded an end to martial law and state-sponsored political murders, implementation of a democratic system and release of all Meilitao Incident political prisoners. Shih was sent to the Tri-Service General Hospital and underwent force-feeding through a nasogastric tube during his four and half years of protest.

On 15 July 1987, the 38-year-long order of martial law was declared over by the KMT government, when President Chiang Ching-kuo announced nationwide sentence reductions and conditional releases. Shih declined the offer. In 1988, Shih went on another hunger strike protest with his brother Shih Ming-cheng. His brother died on 23 August 1988; Shih survived.

=== Release ===
On 20 May 1990, the new president Lee Teng-hui officially assumed the presidency and ordered a special amnesty for all Meilitao Incident prisoners. Shih ripped up his amnesty document and demanded an unconditional release. When President Lee announced the invalidation of the Meilitao Trials, Shih Ming-teh finally accepted his release as an innocent person. Upon recovering his freedom, he joined the now legal Democratic Progressive Party, which originated in the Tangwai movement.

== Political career ==
In 1992, Shih was elected legislator for the Tainan County constituency in the Legislative Yuan. This election was the first free direct legislative elections in Taiwan history.

Between 1994 and 1996 Shih was elected Chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party. During his tenure, he claimed that &quot;Taiwan is already an independent and sovereign nation, when the Democratic Progressive Party is in power, there is no need and it will not announce Taiwan&#x27;s independence&quot;. At the same time Shih proposed a political and social Grand Reconciliation. Elected legislator for a new term in 1996, he ran for the presidency of the Legislative Yuan, gaining a vote from former archrival New Party but losing one from Democratic Progressive Party legislator Chang Chin-cheng. Liu Sung-pan was elected the President of the Legislative Yuan.

On 23 March 1996, Taiwan&#x27;s first direct presidential election was held. The Democratic Progressive Party&#x27;s candidate was defeated by incumbent president Lee Teng-hui, with only 21.1% of the vote (The DPP got around 30% in before regional elections). Shih Ming-teh resigned to his position as party chief, and Chang Chun-hsiung assumed as acting leader of the opposition party. Shih shifted his attention to the completion of the &quot;Meilitao Oral History Records&quot;.

On 1 April 1997, Shih was indicted for a violation to the Mass Gathering and Demonstration Act. He had organized in 1992 a protest demanding direct presidential elections. Huang Hsin-chieh, Hsu Hsin-liang and Lin Yi-hsiung went to prison with Shih for 50 days. This was the third time Shih was imprisoned, but now as a legislator. He was released after 41 days.

In 1998, Shih was re-elected legislator but this time representing a Taipei City constituency. He would continue his efforts for the completion of the &quot;Meilitao Oral History Records&quot;. In three years, 200 individuals of the political spectrum. The oral testimonies amounted to over 6 million words, and were edited to a 600,000-word four-volume version. To date, this is the most comprehensive historical research of the 1970–1990 era in Taiwan&#x27;s development, earning it a publishing prize. This was the result of Shih&#x27;s individual efforts, using his own financial and personal resources. Neither the Democratic Progressive Party nor the government of Taiwan has helped complete this overwhelming historic research project.

In 2000, Chen Shui-bian, the former Mayor of Taipei City, was elected president. Shih congratulated the leader of the Democratic Progressive Party Lin Yi-hsiung for the triumph. He said in an interview that since his childhood dream of ousting Chiang&#x27;s KMT regime had been accomplished, he would leave the political party. In May, Chen before he assumed the presidency, visited Shih&#x27;s office to personally ask him if he was willing to be appointed senior political advisor. Shih rejected Chen&#x27;s offer once more, but instead proposed Hsu Hsin-liang for the position.

Shih condemned President Chen for leading the country with a minority government, ignoring the KMT majority in the Legislative Yuan and risking political stability. After Chen rejected his suggestion for an alliance with the opposition majority in the Legislative Yuan, Shih further walked away from the party. Believing that Taiwan&#x27;s greatest challenge in the 21st century was globalization, together with former colleagues Hsu Hsin-liang and Sisy Chen, the famous Wen Shih-ren and a dozen other intellectuals and entrepreneurs, founded the &quot;&quot;Shan&quot; (Mountain) Alliance&quot;. Their goal: to draw a road map for Taiwan in the 21st century.

Shih ran as an independent twice, in December 2001 and December 2004. On the first occasion he lost with 24,925 votes, on the second he narrowly lost the race by receiving 26,974 votes in the highly contested Taipei North Constituency. He had proposed a parliamentary political system to overcome the aggravation of political differences in Taiwan&#x27;s society.

In December 2002, Shih ran as a mayoral candidate for Kaohsiung City. His platform: turn the port-city into a free port, much like Hong Kong or Amsterdam, to cope with the challenge of globalization. Direct maritime links with Chinese ports were also part of the proposal. Shih perceived that the political division was so severe that he decided to announce his withdrawal three days before the election.

In September 2003, Shih Ming-teh was a visiting scholar at George Mason University for a one-year period. During his tenure, Shih researched what he called the &quot;One China: European Union Model&quot; as a means of ending the impasse between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, and reiterated his proposal for a constitutional amendment in favor of a parliamentary system, in an attempt to put an end to the political polarization into the two camps (blue or Kuomintang-based and green or Democratic Progressive Party-centered) which was deteriorating into ethnic rivalry between Chinese refugees coming to rule Taiwan in 1949, and those who were there before that time.

On 6 October 2005, the Department of Political Science at the National Taiwan University opened the &quot;Shih Ming-teh Lecture&quot; series; ethnic harmony, political reconciliation and cross-strait peace are its core values.

In May 2006, the &quot;Shih Ming-teh Lecture&quot; invited Frederik Willem de Klerk, Former State President of South Africa, to a dialog with Shih Ming-teh: &quot;Maintaining Peace: South Africa&#x27;s Experience, a Perspective for Taiwan?&quot; was the topic.

In May 2015, Shih announced his intention to run for president as an independent candidate in 2016. He again reiterated the Broad One China Framework first proposed in 2014, in which China and Taiwan govern one legal entity separately. Both governments would be allowed to join international organizations and not use military force against the other, instead &quot;resolving issues through consensus.&quot; Shih ended his campaign in September, as he had not been able to fulfill the Central Election Commission requirements needed to stand in the 2016 election.

== Million Voices Against Corruption, Chen Must Go Campaign ==

===Chronology===
On 9 August 2006, Shih wrote an open letter to President Chen Shui-bian, whose aides, wife and son-in-law were implicated in several corruption cases. Shih urged Chen to resign as a display of strength in times of crisis, respect for public opinion and acknowledgement of wrongdoing. Ironically, Chen Shui-bian had been Shih&#x27;s defense attorney in the aftermath of the Kaohsiung Incident and had been imprisoned for 18 months himself.

On 12 August 2006, Shih gave a keynote speech to kick-start the &quot;Million Voices Against Corruption-Chen Must Go&quot; campaign in the 28 February Incident Memorial Park. He argued that the people could not bear with so much corruption anymore. Shih asked of all those who supported the movement a NT$100 (US$3, €2.3) donation as a symbol of commitment and consent, as well as a display of determination to ask Chen Shui-bian to leave the Presidential Office. Shih vowed to lead the people in a protest until Chen Shui-bian stepped down if the donations came in. By 22 August 2006, a sum equivalent of that from over 1 million people had been received (the actual number of donors cannot be computed because there was no restriction on the maximum amount of money one could transfer to the designated account) in only seven days. The designated account was quickly closed and the preparations for the marathon protest started.

On 1 September 2006, the anti-corruption campaign organizers started training for the sit-ins (emergency procedures in case of police intervention). The sit-in began on a rainy day on 9 September 2006. According to the Chinapost, over 300,000 people gathered that day on Ketagalan Avenue, in front of the Presidential Building in Taipei under the pouring rain. The Taipei Police Department claimed there were only 90,000 protestors. According to the organizers&#x27; request, most of them were wearing red shirts; no controversial flags or political icons should be displayed, not even the Republic of China flag, perceived as a pro-Kuomintang device. Some protestors still brought along a small Republic of China flag or other campaign items with them.

On 15 September 2006, a Democratic Progressive Party Taipei city counselor booked the Ketagalan Boulevard site where the red-clad protestors were still gathered. Shih Ming-teh decided to move the protest to Taipei Railway Station. A climax was reached the night of the procession: a large perimeter of over 5.5 kilometers around the heavily guarded Presidential Building and Residence at the heart of Taipei was quickly flooded by peaceful red-clad protestors: the &quot;China Post&quot; reported that over 8 hundred thousand people had joined the candlelight encirclement; the Taipei Police again contradicted this with an estimate of 3 hundred thousand.

On 22 September 2006, Shih declared that he would not form his own political party nor participate in any political negotiations, he also made it clear that he was not willing to engage in negotiations with former president Lee Teng-hui; instead he would stay with the red-clad anti-Chen protestors. On 20 November 2006, Shih Ming-teh urged Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou (the Kuomintang&#x27;s 2008 presidential hopeful) to resign amidst accusations of corruption. Shih said he was not contemplating anti-corruption protests against Ma, but insisted there should not be double standards regarding corruption allegations. Ma was acquitted.

On 30 November 2006, the last night of protest by the Million Voices Against Corruption, Chen Must Go Campaign. Shih Ming-teh later travelled to Thailand for a TV interview and panel discussion.

On 7 December 2006, the Special State Funds case of President Chen and his wife was underway, campaign organizers claimed that Taiwan needed to go back to normal, but Shih would protest until Chen stepped down. On 1 April 2007, Shih announced the end to his self-imprisonment and started preparations for the second stage of the anti-Chen campaign. Plans involved presenting candidates for the next legislative elections. Originally scheduled for late 2007, the elections would instead be carried out in early 2008.

==Personal life==
Shih was married to Linda Arrigo from 1978 to 1995. He later married . Chen was an advocate for LGBTQ rights and same-sex marriage in Taiwan. Chen also led the Shih Ming-teh Culture Foundation.

== Death ==
Shih died on 15 January 2024 of cancer at Taipei Veterans General Hospital, on his 83rd birthday. Several Taiwanese political figures acknowledged Shih&#x27;s death. Lai Ching-te described Shih as a &quot;trailblazer for democracy, a staunch defender of human rights, and a wise and courageous politician.&quot; Tsai Ing-wen stated that Taiwanese people would &quot;consolidate all our endeavors and persist in building a better Taiwan,&quot; reflecting Shih&#x27;s dedication to the same cause. Chiang Wan-an commended Shih&#x27;s advocacy for Taiwanese people and efforts to monitor government actions.

== Controversy ==
Shih was often considered a &quot;romantic revolutionary&quot; in Taiwan media. He believed that he was rooted in his ability &quot;to pursue unlimited aspirations and ideals under restrictive conditions&quot;. The latest editions of Taiwan&#x27;s High-School textbooks list Shih Ming-teh as a political activist. Shih&#x27;s former Legislative Yuan secretary, cartoonist and writer , thinks Shih &quot;is never quite sure of his own place in history&quot;.

Shih was accused by his former wife Chen Li Zhu, in her book &quot;The Innocent Song of a Taiwanese Woman&quot;, of using her as a sex toy, and failing his responsibility as a husband. Chen also claimed Shih had been indifferent to his responsibility toward their daughter. Shih Ming-teh often said: &quot;I have been locked up for 25 years, where were you then?&quot;.

Another former secretary of Shih, Kuo Wen-pin, wrote about his opinion of Shih in Taiwan Daily (15 October 2000): Taking a look at 40 years of his struggle for Taiwan&#x27;s democracy, he revealed himself as a visionary, making several pioneering proposals ahead of his time.

Over 20 years ago, Shih already said the four evils of Taiwan&#x27;s path towards democracy were the political monopoly by the Kuomintang, the press control in Taiwan, the martial law and the &quot;Ten-thousand-year Congress&quot;. Risking the death penalty, Shih advocated for a &quot;Republic of China, Taiwanese Independence Model&quot;, and added that &quot;Taiwan is already an independent country, it has been so for over 30 years&quot;. For his opinions, Shih was considered seditious and the media, organizations, academia, everyone attacked him and humiliated him, only for the Democratic Progressive Party to adopt and implement his ideas; they even led the way to Lee Teng-hui&#x27;s &quot;Silent Revolution&quot; political compromises. When the Kuomintang&#x27;s 50 years in power ended, the Chen Shui-bian administration accepted some of his teachings. Arrests and repression are no longer the defensive measures of the regime when facing harsh criticism, but the abuse of public power and the media by individuals to insult, humiliate, and defame others is still common practice. The DPP party has vowed to improve its image with more diplomatic means, but this has yet to be seen.

In the aftermath of Shih&#x27;s &quot;red-shirt&quot; movement, he became a darling of PRC-controlled media, including CCTVPhoenix TV, and the People&#x27;s Daily. Shih&#x27;s efforts in discrediting the DPP have been widely praised and reported by various media outlets controlled or owned by the Chinese government. On 20 November 2006, ifeng.com, web portal of pro-CCP television channel Phoenix TV, reported Shih planned a trip to Thailand to discuss his &quot;red shirt&quot; philosophy. In the same article, Shih also rebutted claims by representative of the American Institute in Taiwan that the red shirts instigated violence and caused social upheaval.

On 16 January 2010, chinanews.com.cn, a PRC media outlet, reported the possibility of Shih running for presidency in 2012. On 19 April 2010, www.chinataiwan.org, a Chinese government sponsored site, reported Shih claimed numerous prominent DPP leaders, including Chen Shui-bian and Hsieh Chang-ting, were undercover agents for the Kuomintang against political dissidents during the 1980s. According to Huaxia.com, yet another pro-CCP website, Shih&#x27;s accusations have caused a general panic in the DPP. A former supporter and pastor of the Presbyterian Church, Wang, Jie Nan, wrote an opinion piece highlighting his disappointment with Shih, starting from Shih&#x27;s &quot;red shirt&quot; movement and his subsequent efforts to undermine the DPP with outlandish accusations.

On 17 April 2011, Shih courted controversy when he asked Tsai Ing-Wen to publicly disclose her sexual orientation before she participated in her presidential bid. Despite his own support for LGBT rights in Taiwan, Shih was roundly criticized by major women&#x27;s groups including the Awakening Foundation, the Taiwan Women&#x27;s Link and the Taiwan Gender Equity Education Association. Tsai herself characterized the request as &quot;surprising&quot; and refused to reply.

<text>The Deutscher Werkbund (; ) is a German association of artists, architects, designers and industrialists established in 1907. The &quot;Werkbund&quot; became an important element in the development of modern architecture and industrial design, particularly in the later creation of the Bauhaus school of design. Its initial purpose was to establish a partnership of product manufacturers with design professionals to improve the competitiveness of German companies in global markets. The Werkbund was less an artistic movement than a state-sponsored effort to integrate traditional crafts and industrial mass production techniques, to put Germany on a competitive footing with England and the United States. Its motto &quot;Vom Sofakissen zum Städtebau&quot; (from sofa cushions to city-building) indicates its range of interest.

==History==
The Deutscher Werkbund emerged when the architect Joseph Maria Olbrich left Vienna for Darmstadt, Germany, in 1899, to form an artists&#x27; colony at the invitation of Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse. The Werkbund was founded by Olbrich, Peter Behrens, Richard Riemerschmid, Bruno Paul and others in 1907 in Munich at the instigation of Hermann Muthesius, existed through 1934, then re-established after World War II in 1950. Muthesius was the author of the exhaustive three-volume &quot;The English House&quot; of 1905, a survey of the practical lessons of the English Arts and Crafts movement. Muthesius was seen as something of a cultural ambassador, or industrial spy, between Germany and England.

The organization originally included twelve architects and twelve business firms. The architects include Peter Behrens, Theodor Fischer (who served as its first president), Josef Hoffmann, Bruno Paul, Max Laeuger and Richard Riemerschmid. Other architects affiliated with the project include Heinrich Tessenow and the Belgian Henry van de Velde. By 1914, it had 1,870 members, including heads of museums. The Werkbund commissioned van de Velde to design a theater for the 1914 Werkbund Exhibition in Cologne. The exhibition was closed and the buildings dismantled ahead of schedule because of the outbreak of World War I. Eliel Saarinen was made corresponding member of the Deutscher Werkbund in 1914 and was invited to participate in the 1914 Cologne exhibition. Among the Werkbund&#x27;s more noted members was the architect Mies van der Rohe, who served as Architectural Director.

<text>Constance Georgine Markievicz ( ; &#x27;Gore-Booth; 4 February 1868 – 15 July 1927), also known asCountess MarkieviczandMadame Markievicz, was an Irish politician, revolutionary, nationalist, suffragist, and socialist who was the first woman elected to the Parliament of the United Kingdom. She served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Dublin St Patrick&#x27;s from 1918 to 1922. In the Irish Free State, she was elected Minister for Labour in the First Dáil, becoming the second female cabinet minister in Europe. She served as a Teachta Dála for the Dublin South constituency from 1921 to 1922 and 1923 to 1927.

A founding member of Fianna Éireann, Cumann na mBan and the Irish Citizen Army, she took part in the Easter Rising in 1916, when Irish republicans attempted to end British rule and establish an Irish Republic. She was sentenced to death but her sentence was commuted to life imprisonment on the grounds of her sex. On 28 December 1918, she was the first woman elected to the UK House of Commons, though, being in Holloway Prison at the time and in accordance with party policy, she did not take her seat. Instead, she and the other Sinn Féin MPs (as TDs) formed the first Dáil Éireann. She was also one of the first women in the world to hold a cabinet position, as Minister for Labour, from 1919 to 1922.

Markievicz supported the anti-Treaty stance in the Irish Civil War. She continued as an (abstentionist) Dáil member for Sinn Féin until 1926 when she became a founding member of Fianna Fáil. She died in 1927.

== Early life ==

Constance Georgine Gore-Booth was born at Buckingham Gate in London in 1868, the elder daughter of the Arctic explorer and adventurer Sir Henry Gore-Booth, 5th Baronet, an Anglo-Irish landlord who administered a estate, and Georgina, Lady Gore-Booth, &quot;née&quot; Hill. During the famine of 1879–80, Sir Henry provided free food for the tenants on his estate at Lissadell House in the north of County Sligo in the north-west of Ireland. Their father&#x27;s example inspired in Gore-Booth and her younger sister, Eva Gore-Booth, a deep concern for working people and the poor. The sisters were childhood friends of the poet W. B. Yeats, who frequently visited the family home Lissadell House, and were influenced by his artistic and political ideas. Yeats wrote a poem, &quot;In Memory of Eva Gore-Booth and Con Markiewicz&quot;, in which he described the sisters as &quot;two girls in silk kimono, both beautiful, one a gazelle&quot; The gazelle being Eva, whom Yeats described as having &quot;a gazelle-like beauty&quot;. Eva later became involved in the labour movement and women&#x27;s suffrage in Great Britain, although initially Constance did not share her sister&#x27;s ideals.

Gore-Booth wished to train as a painter, to her family&#x27;s dismay; in 1892, she went to study at the Slade School of Art in London, where she lived at the Alexandra House for Art Pupils, Kensington Gore, founded five years before by Sir Francis Cook, a wealthy great-uncle of Maud Gonne. One of her contemporaries there was Blanche Georgiana Vulliamy. It was at this time that Gore-Booth first became politically active and joined the National Union of Women&#x27;s Suffrage Societies (NUWSS). Later she moved to Paris and enrolled at the prestigious Académie Julian where she met her future husband, Casimir Markievicz, an artist from a wealthy Polish family from present-day Ukraine.

The Markieviczes settled in Dublin in 1903 and moved in artistic and literary circles, with Constance gaining a reputation as a landscape painter. In 1905, along with artists Sarah Purser, Nathaniel Hone, Walter Osborne and John Butler Yeats, she was instrumental in founding the United Arts Club, which was an attempt to bring together all those in Dublin with an artistic and literary bent. This group included the leading figures of the Gaelic League founded by the future first President of Ireland, Douglas Hyde. Although formally concerned only with the preservation of the Irish language and culture, the league brought together many patriots and future political leaders. Sarah Purser, whom the young Gore-Booth sisters first met in 1882, when she was commissioned to paint their portrait, hosted a regular salon where artists, writers and intellectuals on both sides of the nationalist divide gathered. At Purser&#x27;s house, Markievicz met revolutionary patriots Michael Davitt, John O&#x27;Leary and Maud Gonne. In 1907, Markievicz rented a cottage in the countryside near Dublin. The previous tenant, the poet Padraic Colum, had left behind copies of &quot;The Peasant&quot; and &quot;Sinn Féin&quot;. These revolutionary journals promoted independence from British rule. Markievicz read them and was propelled into action.

== Politics ==
In 1908, Markievicz became actively involved in nationalist politics in Ireland. She joined Sinn Féin and Inghinidhe na hÉireann (&#x27;Daughters of Ireland&#x27;), a revolutionary women&#x27;s movement founded by the actress and activist Maud Gonne, muse of WB Yeats. Markievicz came directly to her first meeting from a function at Dublin Castle, the seat of British rule in Ireland, wearing a satin ball gown and a diamond tiara. Naturally, the members looked upon her with some hostility. This refreshing change from being &quot;kowtowed&quot;-to as a countess only made her more eager to join, she told her friend Helena Molony. She performed with Maud Gonne in several plays at the newly established Abbey Theatre, an institution that played an important part in the rise of cultural nationalism. In the same year, Markievicz played a dramatic role in the women&#x27;s suffrage campaigners&#x27; tactic of opposing Winston Churchill&#x27;s election to Parliament during the Manchester North West by-election, flamboyantly appearing in the constituency driving an old-fashioned carriage drawn by four white horses to promote the suffragist cause. A male heckler asked her if she could cook a dinner, to which she responded, &quot;Yes. Can you drive a coach and four?&quot; Her sister Eva had moved to Manchester to live with fellow suffragist Esther Roper and they both campaigned against the anti-suffragist Churchill with her. Churchill lost the election to Conservative candidate William Joynson-Hicks, in part as a result of the suffragists&#x27; dedicated opposition.

In 1909 Markievicz founded Fianna Éireann, a nationalist scouting organisation that instructed teenage boys in scouting, in the style of Robert Baden-Powell&#x27;s then-paramilitary Boy Scouts. At the Fianna&#x27;s first meeting in Camden Street, Dublin, on 16 August 1909, she was almost expelled on the basis that women did not belong in a physical force movement. She had drawn in Bulmer Hobson, who had earlier founded a less successful boy scout group in Belfast. He supported her, and she was elected to the committee. She was jailed for the first time in 1911 for speaking at an Irish Republican Brotherhood demonstration attended by 30,000 people, organised to protest against George V&#x27;s visit to Ireland. During this protest, Markievicz handed out leaflets, erected great banners emblazoned &quot;Dear land thou art not conquered yet&quot;, participated in stone-throwing at pictures of the King and Queen and attempted to burn the giant British flag taken from Leinster House, eventually succeeding, but then seeing James McArdle imprisoned for one month for the incident, despite Markievicz testifying in court that she was responsible. Her friend Helena Molony was arrested for her part in the stone-throwing and became the first woman in Ireland to be tried and imprisoned for a political act since the time of the Ladies Land League.

Markievicz joined James Connolly&#x27;s socialist Irish Citizen Army (ICA), a volunteer force formed in response to the lock-out of 1913 to defend the demonstrating workers from the police. Markievicz recruited volunteers to peel potatoes in the basement of Liberty Hall while she and others worked on distributing the food. Markievicz was forced to take out loans and to sell her jewellery. That year, with Inghinidhe na hÉireann, she ran a soup kitchen to feed poor children and enable them to attend school.

In the Inghininidhe na h-Éireann magazine &quot;Bean na h-Éireann&quot;, Markievicz&#x27;s advice to women was: &quot;Dress suitably in short skirts and strong boots, leave your jewels in the bank and buy a revolver.&quot;

== Easter Rising ==

As a member of the Citizen Army, Markievicz took part in the 1916 Easter Rising. She was deeply inspired by the founder of the ICA, James Connolly. Markievicz designed the Citizen Army uniform and composed its anthem, based on the tune of a Polish song.

Markievicz fought in St Stephen&#x27;s Green, where on the first morning —according to the only two pages surviving of the diary of an alleged witness — she shot a member of the Dublin Metropolitan Police, Constable Lahiff, who subsequently died of his injuries. Other accounts place her at City Hall when the policeman was shot, only arriving at Stephen&#x27;s Green later. It was long thought that she was second in command to Michael Mallin, but in fact it was Christopher &quot;Kit&quot; Poole who held that position. Markievicz supervised the setting-up of barricades on Easter Monday and was in the middle of the fighting all around Stephen&#x27;s Green, wounding a British army sniper. Trenches were dug in the Green, sheltered by the front gate; however, after British machine gun and rifle fire from the rooftops of tall buildings on the north side of the Green including the Shelbourne Hotel, the Citizen Army troops withdrew to the Royal College of Surgeons on the west side of the Green.

The Stephen&#x27;s Green garrison held out for six days, ending the engagement when the British brought them Pearse&#x27;s surrender order. The British officer, Captain (later Major) de Courcy Wheeler, who accepted their surrender was married to Markievicz&#x27;s first cousin, Selina Maude Beresford Knox.

They were taken to Dublin Castle and then to Kilmainham Gaol through what Matt Connolly described as &quot;several groups of hostile people&quot;. There, she was the only one of 70 women prisoners who was put into solitary confinement. At her court-martial on 4 May 1916, Markievicz pleaded not guilty to &quot;taking part in an armed rebellion...for the purpose of assisting the enemy,&quot; but pleaded guilty to having attempted &quot;to cause disaffection among the civil population of His Majesty&quot;. Markievicz told the court, &quot;I went out to fight for Ireland&#x27;s freedom and it does not matter what happens to me. I did what I thought was right and I stand by it.&quot; She was sentenced to death, but the court recommended mercy &quot;solely and only on account of her sex&quot;. The sentence was commuted to life in prison. When told of this, she said to her captors, &quot;I do wish your lot had the decency to shoot me&quot;.

Markievicz was transferred to Mountjoy Prison, Holloway Prison and then to Aylesbury Prison in England in July 1916. She was released from prison in 1917, along with others involved in the Rising, as the government in London granted a general amnesty for those who had participated in it. It was around this time that Markievicz, born into the Church of Ireland, converted to Catholicism.

== First Dáil ==

Along with other leading Sinn Féin members, she was jailed again in 1918 for her part in the supposed German Plot. At the 1918 general election, Markievicz was elected for the constituency of Dublin St Patrick&#x27;s, beating her opponent William Field with 66% of the vote, as one of 73 Sinn Féin MPs. The results were called on 28 December 1918. This made her the first woman elected to the United Kingdom House of Commons. However, in line with Sinn Féin abstentionist policy, she did not take her seat in the House of Commons.

Markievicz was in Holloway prison when her colleagues assembled in Dublin at the first meeting of the First Dáil, the Parliament of the revolutionary Irish Republic. When her name was called, she was described, like many of those elected, as being &quot;imprisoned by the foreign enemy&quot; (&quot;fé ghlas ag Gallaibh&quot;). She was re-elected to the Second Dáil in the elections of 1921.

Markievicz served as Minister for Labour from April 1919 to January 1922, in the Second Ministry and the Third Ministry of the Dáil. Holding cabinet rank from April to August 1919, she became both the first Irish female Cabinet Minister and at the same time, only the second female government minister in Europe. She was the only female cabinet minister in Irish history until 1979 when Máire Geoghegan-Quinn was appointed to the cabinet post of Minister for the Gaeltacht for Fianna Fáil.
Her Labour department was concerned with setting up Conciliation Boards, arbitrating labour disputes, surveying areas and establishing guidelines for wages and food prices.

Markievicz left the government in January 1922 along with Éamon de Valera and others in opposition to the Anglo-Irish Treaty. She worked actively for the Republican cause in the Irish Civil War, including directing the Citizen Army in the occupation of Moran&#x27;s Hotel in Dublin. During the Battle of Dublin (28 June to 5 July 1922) she helped lead the anti-Treaty forces of the IRAs Dublin Brigade. Members of Cumann na mBan assisted the anti-treaty forces and carried dispatches between the occupied Four Courts buildings and the Dublin Brigade headquarters. After the civil war she toured the United States. She was not elected in the 1922 Irish general election but was returned in 1923 for the Dublin South constituency. In common with other Republican candidates, she did not take her Dáil seat. She was arrested again in November 1923. In prison, she went on a hunger strike, and within a month, she and other prisoners were released.

She left Sinn Féin and joined Fianna Fáil on its foundation in 1926, chairing the inaugural meeting of the new party in La Scala Theatre. In the June 1927 general election, she was re-elected to the 5th Dáil as a candidate for Fianna Fáil, which was pledged to take its seats in Dáil Éireann if the requirement to take the Oath of Allegiance were removed. Markievicz died on 15 July 1927. Following the assassination of Kevin O&#x27;Higgins and proposed changes in electoral law, Fianna Fáil altered its policy. Its TDs signed the Oath and took their seats in the Dáil on 12 August 1927, less than a month after her death. The party leader Éamon de Valera described the Oath as &quot;an empty political formula&quot;.

== Family life ==

Constance&#x27;s husband, Casimir Markievicz, was known in Paris as Count Markievicz, a title that was the norm for large landowners in Poland at this time. When the Gore-Booth family enquired as to the validity of the title, they were informed through Pyotr Rachkovsky of the Russian Secret Police that he had taken the title &quot;without right&quot;, and that there had never been a &quot;Count Markievicz&quot; in Poland. However, the Department of Genealogy in Saint Petersburg said that he was entitled to claim to be a member of the nobility. Markievicz was married, though separated, at the time they met; his wife died in 1899 and he and Gore-Booth married in London on 29 September 1900. She gave birth to their daughter, Maeve, at Lissadell in November 1901. The child was mainly raised by her Gore-Booth grandparents. Stanislas, Casimir&#x27;s son from his first marriage, accompanied the couple to Ireland after their honeymoon visit to his homeland.

In 1913 Markievicz&#x27;s husband moved back to Ukraine, and never returned to live in Ireland. However, they did correspond and he was by her side when she died.

== Death ==
Markievicz died at the age of 59 on 15 July 1927, of complications after two appendicitis operations, a dangerous surgery in the days before antibiotics. She had given away the last of her wealth, and died in a public ward &quot;among the poor where she wanted to be&quot;. One of the doctors attending her was her revolutionary colleague Kathleen Lynn. Also at her bedside were Casimir and Stanislas Markievicz, Éamon de Valera and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington. Prior to her death, Esther Roper maintained a vigil at Constance&#x27;s bed with Marie Perolz, Helena Molony, Kathleen Lynn and other friends. Refused a state funeral by the Free State government, she was laid out in the Rotunda, where she had spoken at so many political meetings. Thousands of the Dubliners who loved her lined O&#x27;Connell Street and Parnell Square to pass by her body and pay their respects to &#x27;Madame&#x27;. It took four hours for the beginning of the funeral, starting from the Rotunda, to reach the gates of Glasnevin Cemetery. Eamon de Valera gave the funeral oration, while Free State soldiers stood on guard to prevent the rifle salute that Michael Collins had called &quot;the only speech which it is proper to make above the grave of a dead Fenian&quot;.

Her former Citizen Army colleague the playwright Seán O&#x27;Casey said of her: &quot;One thing she had in abundance—physical courage; with that she was clothed as with a garment.&quot;

== Tributes ==
In County Sligo Markievicz Road and Markievicz Park (the main GAA stadium in the county) both bear her name. In Dublin, the flat complex Countess Markiewicz House also bears her name.

In 2018, a portrait of Markievicz was donated by the Irish parliament to the British House of Commons to commemorate the 1918 Representation of the People Act, under which, some women were allowed the right to vote for the first time in the United Kingdom.

In 2019, a Dublin City Council Commemorative Plaque was unveiled at Markievicz&#x27;s former home in Dublin, Surrey House on Leinster Road in Rathmines.

In 2008, a Ukrainian village of Zhyvotivka, where Constance stayed with the Markievicz family in 1903, opened a room dedicated to the couple with the documents brought from Lissadel.

<text>Petsoe End is a hamlet in Emberton civil parish, in the City of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England.

The name Petsoe is used frequently in the local area, with other local hamlets being called Petsoe Manor and Petsoe Lodge.

Petsoe was formerly a separate parish from Emberton, but was annexed to the latter parish in 1650 for ecclesiastical purposes. There was another parish nearby, called Ekeney which was also annexed at the same time, though nothing remains of Ekeney today.

Today nothing remains of Petsoe church, though the landmarkings showing where it once stood are still discernible.

<text>Frieder Nake (born December 16, 1938) is a mathematician, computer scientist, and pioneer of computer art. He is best known internationally for his contributions to the earliest manifestations of computer art, a field of computing that made its first public appearances with three small exhibitions in 1965.

==Art career==
Nake had his first exhibition at Galerie Wendelin Niedlich in Stuttgart in November, 1965 alongside the artist Georg Nees.

Until 1969, Nake generated in rapid sequence a large number of works that he showed in many exhibitions over the years. He estimates his production at about 300 to 400 works during those years. A few were limited screenprint editions, single pieces and portfolios. The bulk were done as China ink on paper graphics, carried out by a flatbed high precision plotter called the Zuse Graphomat Z64.

Nake participated in the important group shows of the 1960s, such as, most prominently, Cybernetic Serendipity (London, UK, 1968), Tendencies 4: Computers and Visual Research (Zagreb, Yugoslavia, 1968), Ricerca e Progettazione. Proposte per una esposizione sperimentale (35th Venice Biennale, Italy, 1970), Arteonica (São Paulo, Brazil, 1971).

In 1971, he wrote a short and provocative note for Page, the Bulletin of the Computer Arts Society (whose member he was and still is), under the title „There Should Be No Computer-Art“ (Page No. 18, Oct. 1971, p. 1-2. Reprinted in Arie Altena, Lucas van der Velden (eds.): The anthology of computer art. Amsterdam: Sonic Acts 2006, p. 59-60). The note sparked a lively controversial debate among those who had meanwhile started to build an active community of artists, writers, musicians, and designers in the digital domain. His statement was rooted in a moral position. The involvement of computer technology in the Vietnam War and in massive attempts by capital to automate productive processes and, thereby, generate unemployment, should not allow artists to close their eyes and become silent servants of the ruling classes by reconciling high technology with the masses of the poor and suppressed.

His book &quot;Ästhetik als Informationsverarbeitung&quot; (1974) is one of the first to study connections between aesthetics, computing, and information theory, which has become important to the transdisciplinary area of digital media. This book and many of his ca. 300 publications (2012) evince his intellectual position between science and the humanities – a position that has always included an element of concern regarding the threats to a fully human society represented by computer technology, and which concern is on full display in a summary interview focused on what he describes as the &quot;Algorithmic Revolution&quot;.

==Academic career==
Frieder Nake has been a professor of interactive computer graphics at the Department of Computer Science at Bremen, Germany, since 1972. Since 2005, he has also been teaching digital media design there. After studying mathematics at the University of Stuttgart, where he earned his diploma and doctoral degrees (in probability theory), he has taught in Stuttgart, Toronto and Vancouver, before coming to Bremen. His courses and seminars, besides computer graphics, interactivity, and digital media, are in the areas of computer art, aesthetics, semiotics, computers and society, and theory of computing. He has been a visiting professor to Universitetet Oslo, Aarhus Universitet, Universität Wien, Danube University Krems, University of Colorado, University of Lübeck, University of Basel, University of Costa Rica, Xi&#x27;an University of Science and Technology and Tongji University.

==Awards==
He won the First Prize of the Computer Art Contest of Computers &amp; Automation in 1966. In 1997, his teaching work was honored by the Berninghausen Award for Excellence and Innovation in Teaching (University of Bremen).

<doc id="394528" wikidata="Q747336" url="?curid=394528" title="Flackwell Heath">
<text>Flackwell Heath is a village in the civil parish of Chepping Wycombe on the outskirts of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, England. With an elevation of about , in the Chiltern Hills. It has a population of around 6000.

== History ==
The name &#x27;Flackwell&#x27; is of dubious origin but may describe the source of a stream which once started in this area. The heath was once covered with cherry orchards, &quot;a place of annual resort and festivity during the cherry season&quot; with many cherry pickers traveling from London for the annual event.

This is now commemorated in the name of a pub, the Carrington school emblem and in road names such as Cherrywood Gardens. The area covered by Flackwell Heath was once four villages; Flackwell Heath, North-End Woods, Heath End, and Sedgemoor. However, housing developments, particularly post-1945, meant the four eventually formed one large village: Flackwell Heath.

The original villagers were in the main farm workers, but some bargemen and mill workers also lived in the village. In the late 19th century, industrial mill workers became more commonplace in the village, and the first furniture makers and workers began to settle too, with Flackwell Heath&#x27;s close proximity to High Wycombe – well known for the chair and furniture industry.

== Amenities ==
The village has several shops with Sainsbury&#x27;s (Local) being the largest of these. There are two Indian takeaways and a fish and chip shop as well as convenience stores and other shops.

Although Flackwell Heath previously had six public houses in the village, the site of The Magpie has been redeveloped and The Green Man (1755 to 2011) demolished, with a Sainsbury&#x27;s Local store built on the site in the centre of the village. The remaining four pubs are; The Cherry Tree (found on Straight Bit in the heart of the village), The Green Dragon (located in the south of the village, on the corner between Blind Lane and Green Dragon Road), The Three Horseshoes on Common Road (close to the Golf Club) and The Stag (at the Western end of the village on Heath End Road).

Other features of the village include a water tower, war memorial and recreation ground. There is only one listed building, a former farmhouse dating from the 17th – early 18th century.

There is a wind turbine situated in the playing field of Carrington Junior School. The turbine generates around a third of the school&#x27;s energy.

=== Sport and leisure ===
A golf course Flackwell Heath Golf Club dating from 1904 is located on the village outskirts. In the 90s the golf club kitchen was run by Frank Wood. He cooked roast dinners and catered for hundreds of Members during his time at the golf club.

There is also Flackwell Heath Football Club, a Non-League football team who play at Wilkes Park in the west of the village.

== Community ==
There is a Methodist Church and the recently extended Christ Church, which includes stained glass designed by Patrick Reyntiens. A community centre is situated in the village centre, and has notably been made use of for the Scout&#x27;s 2006 Christmas Pantomime, &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, the 2007 pantomime, &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, &quot;Cinderella&quot; in 2008 and most recently, &quot;Dick Whittington&quot; in 2009. The Scout Pantomimes were &quot;enjoyed by all&quot;. The Community Centre is also home to an &#x27;indoor boot sale&#x27; has been held every Sunday during Winter for the past few years, attracting many to the village. It is also used as a polling station for general elections.

There is an annual firework display on the weekend nearest 5 November in the Carrington School Playing field, next to the 1st Flackwell Heath Scout&#x27;s HQ (it was previously held on the recreation ground), which features two firework displays and several foods and drink stores. The firework display has been hugely successful for 30 years. A village Fête held every year on the recreation ground was revived as the &#x27;Cherry Fayre&#x27;. Every year, this celebration has had a different theme – one such theme being Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. In celebration of the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee in June 2012, a number of village organisations (including the Residents&#x27; Association, Community Association, Scout Group, WI and Royal British Legion) ran a series of events across the Bank Holiday Weekend.

Every Remembrance Sunday, there is a parade around the village war memorial, hosted by the Royal British Legion and attended by service men and women past and present, 1st Flackwell Heath Scout Group, Flackwell Heath Guide District, Flackwell Heath Girl&#x27;s Brigade and more recently a local Troop of the Boy Scouts of America. Every year the parade sees hundreds of residents stood around the memorial and many wreaths laid.

The Flackwell Heath Residents&#x27; Association and the Flackwell Heath Community Association both host numerous events throughout the year for the residents, including Race Nights, Quiz Nights, Music Events and Dances. The Grapevine newsletter is distributed to the village community ten times a year and is put together and run by volunteers.

There is a large wood (Fennels Wood), which runs alongside a large part of Flackwell Heath and consists mainly of Beech trees. It also has an area where people ride their bicycles, this is locally known as &#x27;The Dells&#x27;. The wood hit the news in September 2006, as it was briefly closed off, due to a suspicious find relating to the transatlantic aircraft terrorist plot.

House prices are relatively high in Flackwell Heath due to its closeness both to London and pleasant rural areas.

== Education ==
There are three primary schools in the village, Juniper Hill, Carrington Junior School, and Carrington Infant School. The catchment areas for the schools are the east and west sides of the village respectively. Flackwell Heath is also home to the Wycombe campus of Amersham &amp; Wycombe College. The college is based in Spring Lane on the site of a former secondary school that was built in the late 1960s and closed in 1985. The village is also in the catchment area of Grammar Schools, including John Hampden Grammar School for boys and Wycombe High School for girls, which are both situated 3 miles from the centre of the village in High Wycombe.

== Transportation ==
The M40 from junction 3 to 4 runs through the middle of Fennels Wood. Junction 3 of the M40 can be found a short distance away from Flackwell Heath in Loudwater.

Flackwell Heath was once served by the High Wycombe to Maidenhead railway line, via Loudwater railway station at the bottom of Treadaway Hill. The line and station were closed in 1970 although you can walk along the disused railway line through Fennels Wood.

Carousel operate the council contracted bus service 36 from Flackwell Heath to High Wycombe and Bourne End, Buckinghamshire. There are also a number of school buses that operate from Flackwell Heath and in the mornings and afternoons.

<text>Infernal Affairs () is a 2002 Hong Kong crime action thriller film directed by Andrew Lau and Alan Mak from a screenplay written by Mak and Felix Chong. The film stars Andy Lau, Tony Leung, Anthony Wong, Eric Tsang, Sammi Cheng and Kelly Chen. The film follows an undercover Hong Kong Police Force officer who infiltrates a triad and another police officer who is secretly a spy for the same triad. The film is the first in the &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; series, followed by &quot;Infernal Affairs II&quot; and &quot;Infernal Affairs III&quot; (both 2003).

At the 22nd Hong Kong Film Awards, &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; won seven out of the sixteen awards it was nominated for—including Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor (Leung), and Best Supporting Actor (Wong). It also won in those categories at the 40th Golden Horse Awards and 8th Golden Bauhinia Awards. The film was selected as Hong Kong&#x27;s entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 76th Academy Awards but was not nominated. Miramax Films acquired the United States distribution rights and gave it a limited American theatrical release in 2004. 

American director Martin Scorsese remade the film in 2006 as &quot;The Departed&quot;, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture as well as Academy Award for Best Director, Scorsese&#x27;s first and only Oscar in his career, and Best Adapted Screenplay. The film has also been remade in India as &quot;Homam&quot; (2008), in South Korea as &quot;City of Damnation&quot; (2009), and in Japan as &quot;Double Face&quot; (2012). In 2018, a television series adaptation aired on TVB.

== Plot ==
Hon Sam, a Hong Kong triad boss, sends Lau Kin-ming, a young gangster, to the police academy to become his mole in the Hong Kong Police Force. Around the same time, cadet Chan Wing-yan is ostensibly expelled from the police academy, but is actually selected to be an undercover cop reporting only to Superintendent Wong Chi-shing, who sends him to infiltrate Hon&#x27;s triad. Over the next ten years, Chan is under great stress due to his questionable actions working undercover. Meanwhile, Lau quickly rises through the ranks, becoming a Senior Inspector. 

After successfully infiltrating the triad, Chan informs Wong of a transaction between Hon and some Thai cocaine dealers, which Wong&#x27;s team interrupts. However, Lau alerts Hon, giving him enough time to get his henchmen to dispose of the evidence. After this incident, Wong and Hon realise they each have a spy within their own organisations, and race each other to uncover the moles. By this time, both Chan and Lau are struggling with their double lives. Chan is afraid he is turning into an actual criminal while also fearing his cover will be blown; he begins undergoing sessions with psychiatrist Lee Sum-yee and jokingly tells her that he is a cop. Meanwhile, Lau appreciates his life as a respected police officer and wants to sever his ties with the triad.

Lau is tasked by Hon to identify the cop who infiltrated the triad; coincidentally, he is also assigned by the HKPF to lead the mission to uncover the triad&#x27;s mole within their ranks. He uses his new role to have Wong surveilled, hoping to catch him meeting his mole. Wong meets Chan on a rooftop to discuss Hon&#x27;s next drug shipment as well as Chan&#x27;s fear of being uncovered. Hon learns about Wong&#x27;s location from Lau and sends his henchmen to confront them. Chan escapes from the building while Wong tries to distract the gangsters but ends up being thrown off the roof to his death. Just then, the police show up and a shootout ensues. Henchman Keung, unaware that Chan is the mole, chauffeurs him away from the scene but succumbs to a gunshot wound he sustained earlier. When the news reports that Keung was apparently an undercover cop, Hon assumes he was the mole. Using Wong&#x27;s phone, Lau contacts Chan and convinces him to collaborate in taking Hon down. The police successfully foils Hon&#x27;s subsequent drug deal and arrests his henchmen. Lau then betrays Hon and kills him.

Everything seems to have fallen into place—Chan can revert to his true identity as a cop while Lau has erased his criminal connections. At police headquarters, Chan and Lau meet for the first time. As Lau prepares to reinstate Chan into the police force, Chan deduces that Lau was the mole and leaves promptly. Realising what had happened, Lau takes possession of Chan&#x27;s police identity file to use as leverage to dissuade Chan from exposing him. Chan meets with Lee, the only person left whom he can trust, and convinces her that he truly is a cop. Chan then sends a CD to Lau&#x27;s address containing a recording of Lau&#x27;s earlier meeting with Hon. Lau&#x27;s fiancée, Mary, inadvertently listens to the CD and discovers Lau&#x27;s secret. Chan arranges to meet with Lau on the same rooftop where Wong was killed. There, he disarms Lau and points a pistol to his head. Lau states calmly that he wants to start over as a good person, but Chan rejects his plea to help him conceal his criminal past. Inspector &quot;Big B&quot; arrives and points his gun at Chan, ordering him to release Lau. Chan holds Lau hostage at gunpoint and backs into a lift, but is shot in the head by Big B. Big B then reveals to Lau that he is also a mole planted by Hon, and assures Lau of his loyalty. When they ride the lift down to the ground floor, Lau kills Big B. 

Six months later, Lee discovers records of Chan&#x27;s identity as an undercover cop and he is buried with honours beside Wong. Lau salutes Chan at his funeral. Meanwhile, the internal affairs case is closed after they conclude that Big B was the mole in the police force. A flashback shows the day that Chan was ostensibly expelled from the police academy, with Lau looking back with guilt and wishing he was the one expelled instead.

===Alternate ending===
An alternate ending for the film was shot in order to comply with Article 25 (7) of the Chinese Film Administration Regulations specifying that films cannot propagate obscenity, gambling or violence, or abet to commit crimes. In the original Hong Kong ending, Lau concealed his true identity as a triad spy and identified himself as a police officer to avoid punishment. Therefore, the original ending was deemed to promote criminal activity and injustice, and an alternate ending was filmed to make the film suitable for mainland China. In the alternate ending, Inspector Cheung discovers evidence of Lau&#x27;s criminal activity and immediately arrests him when he gets off the lift. This alternate ending was shown in mainland China and Malaysia.

==Production==
===Writing===
Writer Alan Mak had long wanted to write a story about police and gangsters. The script of &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; was inspired by John Woo&#x27;s &quot;Face/Off&quot; (1997) but Mak knew that its science fiction elements were too implausible in reality, so he focused on the exchange of identity and psychology between the two leads as its themes. In the process of Mak&#x27;s creation, his good friend Felix Chong also encouraged and supported him. The script, written by Mak and revised by Chong, took three years to complete.

The dialogue in the famous rooftop showdown was created on the spot by Felix Chong and Tony Leung, with Chong playing Andy Lau&#x27;s part. The script originally included a typical shootout in the third act, but Leung insisted on turning it into a dialogue scene.

Gordon Lam did not receive the full script and did not know his character was also a triad mole until the final scene.

===Investment===
The script for &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; originally belonged to Andy Lau&#x27;s Teamwork Motion Pictures, but due to the company&#x27;s entanglement in a lawsuit at the time, it was unable to produce the film. In addition, the creative team could not find investors because other studios at the time thought that an undercover film wasn&#x27;t novel enough to make money. Eventually, Andrew Lau made a hopeless bid and showed the script to John Chong at Media Asia Entertainment Group. To his surprise Chong and company chairman Peter Lam saw potential in the story. Lam proceeded to invest HK $20 million in the film, under the condition that Andy Lau will star the film.

==Themes==
===Postcolonial identity crisis in Hong Kong===
In &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot;, the identity crisis suffered by both Chan and Lau as moles hint at the struggle of Hong Kong residents, who faced both the colonization by the British and the reunification with Mainland China. Specifically, under Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s one country, two systems policy, the duplicity, unsettling, and uncertain nature of the future of Hong Kong residents is tightly echoed in Chan and Lau&#x27;s character developments. Scholar Howard Y. F. Choy further claimed that &quot;this postcolonial (re)turn is actually more a recolonization than a decolonization of the capitalist Cantonese city by the mainland Mandarin master.&quot;

===Buddhism===
&quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; opens with Buddhist classic Nirvana Sutra Verse Nineteen, stating that &quot;The worst of the Eight Hells is called Continuous Hell. It has the meaning of Continuous Suffering. Thus the name.&quot; The film also closes with another quote from Buddha, stating that &quot;He who is in Continuous Hell never dies. Longevity is a big hardship in Continuous Hell.&quot; In Buddhism, Continuous Hell is also termed The Avici, where one can never reincarnate nor be relieved from guilt and suffering. This concept of timeless, placeless, and endless suffering especially applies to the character Lau throughout the trilogy, who infinitely bears the burden of self-betrayal (serves as a mole), loss of family and friendship, and unsettledness.

==Reception==
===Box office===
Upon its premiere in Hong Kong, &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; grossed $160,356 during the opening day (16–19 January). In total, the film grossed $7,035,649 during its run in Hong Kong theatres. The film was then released across Asia, where it grossed a further $169,659 from theatre receipts. In 2016, South Korean theaters re-released the film, which went on to gross $128,026 across three weeks. The total lifetime gross of the film in Korea is $977,903.

In total, worldwide, the film grossed $8,836,958 across release in both domestic markets and European theatres which displayed the film.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; has an approval rating of 94% based on reviews from 64 critics, with an average rating of 7.50/10. The consensus from the site reads as &quot;Smart and engrossing, this is one of Hong Kong&#x27;s better cop thrillers.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 75 out of 100 based on reviews from 19 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. It was ranked as the 62nd Best Movie of 2004, 86th Most Discussed Movie of 2004, and the 95th Most Shared Movie of 2004.

Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film a three-out-of-four star rating and described &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; as offering &quot;rare emotional depth.&quot; In his words, &quot;The movie pays off in a kind of emotional complexity rarely seen in crime movies. I cannot reveal what happens but will urge you to consider the thoughts of two men who finally confront their own real identities—in the person of the other character.&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer Elvis Mitchell was so enraptured with the film that he stated that &quot;&quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; is so beautifully shot that the images occasionally distract you from the condensed policier plot.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; played an integral role in Andrew Lau&#x27;s breakout films in entering the 21st century. Being the most critically acclaimed film of his to date, it was ranked No. 30 in &quot;Empire&quot;&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot; in 2019.

&quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; gained significant traction during its festival run as it was nominated for sixteen awards during the 22nd Hong Kong Film Awards, winning seven of those categories. It also won the Best Picture at the 40th Golden Horse Awards, the 8th Golden Bauhinia Awards, and the Best Foreign Language Film at the 46th Blue Ribbon Awards.

Eventually, &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; would spark the creation of two more films, with &quot;Infernal Affairs II&quot; getting 11 nominations and &quot;Infernal Affairs III&quot; getting 7 nominations during the 23rd Hong Kong Film Awards, with &quot;Infernal Affairs II&quot; winning Best Original Film Song.

== Legacy ==

===Sequels and adaptations===
With star power, visual allure, and an engaging script, &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; did very well critically and financially, spawned two sequels and a television series, and attracted the attention of Hollywood.
In 2003, Brad Pitt&#x27;s production company Plan B Entertainment acquired the rights for a Hollywood remake, named &quot;The Departed&quot;, which was directed by Martin Scorsese, written by William Monahan, starred Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone, Vera Farmiga, and Alec Baldwin, set in Boston, Massachusetts, and roughly based on the life of famed Boston mobster James &quot;Whitey&quot; Bulger. &quot;The Departed&quot; was released on 6 October 2006 by Warner Bros. Pictures and won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay for Monahan, and Best Director for Scorsese. Andrew Lau, the co-director of &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot;, who was interviewed by Hong Kong newspaper &quot;Apple Daily&quot;, said: &quot;Of course I think the version I made is better, but the Hollywood version is pretty good too. [Scorsese] made the Hollywood version more attuned to American culture.&quot; Andy Lau, one of the main actors in &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot;, when asked how the movie compares to the original, said: &quot;&quot;The Departed&quot; was too long and it felt as if Hollywood had combined all three &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; movies together.&quot; Lau pointed out that the remake featured some of the &quot;golden quotes&quot; of the original but did have much more swearing. He ultimately rated &quot;The Departed&quot; 8/10 and said that the Hollywood remake is worth a view, though according to Lau&#x27;s spokeswoman Alice Tam, he felt that the combination of the two female characters into one in &quot;The Departed&quot; was not as good as the original storyline.

Media Asia released a limited edition of eight-DVD set of the &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; trilogy in an Ultimate Collectible Boxset () on 20 December 2004. Features included an online game and two Chinese novelisations of the film series by Lee Muk-Tung (), titled 無間道I+II小說 and 無間道III終極無間小說.

In 2009, a Korean remake &quot;City of Damnation&quot;, which was directed by Kim Dong-won was released on 22 January 2009. In 2009, a Telugu remake &quot;Homam&quot;, which directed and acted by JD Chakravarthy along with Jagapathi Babu was released and became a notable movie. In 2012, &quot;Double Face&quot; (ダブルフェイス), a Japanese television remake starring Hidetoshi Nishijima was released by TBS and WOWOW. The production aired in two parts: &quot;Police Impersonation&quot; on WOWOW and &quot;Undercover&quot; on TBS.

A TV series remake debuted in 2018 produced by Media Asia and former TVB producer Tommy Leung. The series, which is titled &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; like the film, stars Gallen Lo, Damian Lau, Paul Chun, Lo Hoi-pang, Eric Tsang, Derek Kok, Dominic Lam, Toby Leung and Yuen Biao. The story takes place years after the films&#x27; events, with some minor characters reprising their roles alongside a new cast. The TV series uses the same concept as the film, but with an entirely new story and characters, and the setting expanded beyond Hong Kong to include Thailand and Shenzhen. It stretched through three seasons with each season consisting of 12 episodes.

Hindi remake is going to be a joint development between Warner Bros. India and Mumbai – based banner Azure and is set for a remake for a two-picture deal

===In popular culture===
Lau, Tsang, and Jacky Cheung parodied the cinema scene to promote the Hong Kong Film Awards. Lau and Tsang, in their respective characters, go through the scene where they meet to gather info on the undercover cop amongst Hon Sam&#x27;s gang. Lau Kin-ming asks Hon, &quot;Why do we always meet in a cinema?&quot;, to which Hon answers, &quot;It&#x27;s quiet. No one comes to movies&quot;. Cheung comes out from the shadows behind them and says, &quot;I don&#x27;t know...quite a few people watch movies&quot; and we see a slew of Hong Kong celebrities watching various clips of Hong Kong films on the screen. Originally Tony Leung was going to appear but scheduling conflicts led to the recasting.

The 2003 TVB spoof celebrating the Chinese New Year called &quot;Mo Ba To&quot; (), the 2004 comedy film &quot;Love Is a Many Stupid Thing&quot; by Wong Jing, and the 2004 TVB television drama &quot;Shades of Truth&quot; were re-writings based on the plot of the film.

In Taiwan SHODA () and a secondary school student Blanka () cut and rearranged the original film and inserted new sound tracks to produce their videos &quot;Infernal Affairs CD pro2&quot; and &quot;Infernal Affairs iPod&quot; on the web. The videos had many views and both producers removed their videos after receiving cease and desist letters from the Group Power Workshop Limited (), the Taiwan distributor of the film.

The hi-fi shop scene was later recreated with additions of excerpts of the film to encourage businesses to join the Quality Tourism Services Scheme in Hong Kong.

The success of the film inspired many genres, including an open-world video game from United Front Games titled &quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot; (or &quot;True Crime: Hong Kong&quot; before being canceled by Activision Blizzard in 2011), with the protagonist of the story infiltrating the criminal underworld as an undercover cop.

== Remaster ==
A 4K remaster of the &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; trilogy was released on 12 December 2022, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot;.

==Music and soundtrack==
The original film score for &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; was written and performed by Chan Kwong-wing.
The theme song, &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; (), was composed by Ronald Ng, lyrics provided by Albert Leung, and performed in Cantonese and Mandarin by Andy Lau and Tony Leung.

Although not included in the soundtrack album, Tsai Chin&#x27;s song &quot;Forgotten Times&quot; () features prominently in this film as a recurring element of its storyline, and also in its sequels.

<text>Emberton is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority area of the City of Milton Keynes, in Buckinghamshire, England. The village is near the borders with Northamptonshire and Bedfordshire, just to the south of Olney, north of Newport Pagnell, and north-east of Central Milton Keynes.

The parish of Emberton was formed from three villages that were annexed together for ecclesiastical purposes in 1650: Petsoe, Ekeney and Emberton. Today nothing remains of Ekeney and Petsoe only exists as a hamlet called Petsoe End.

The village name is an Old English word and means &quot;Eanbeorht&#x27;s Farm&quot;. In the Domesday Book of 1086 the village was called &quot;Ambretone&quot;; in manorial records of 1227 it was &quot;Emberdestone&quot;, and by the fourteenth century it was Embirtone.

In the twelfth century, the manor was owned by the Paynel &quot;(sic)&quot; family of Newport Pagnell. The parish church is dedicated to All Saints.

Although there are no shops in the village, there is a village pub called the Bell and Bear on the site of the old Bell Inn. The former Bear Inn was previously situated near Petsoe where the A509 now runs.

==Clock tower==
At the heart of the village is a clock tower, which was restored in 1972 and then renovated with the help of a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. This poem is engraved on a panel below the clock:

==Nearby geographic features==
Hollington Wood, a small patch of ancient woodland, lies about a mile south-east of Emberton.

The Milton Keynes Wind Farm is located 2 miles east of Emberton.

There is also an 18ha solar farm at Rectory Farm, Petsoe 

==Notable people==
Dan Wheldon (1978–2011), one of the biggest names in American motorsport, hailed from Emberton. Though relatively unknown in his native Britain, Wheldon became a star in the United States after winning both the IndyCar championship and the Indy 500 in 2005 and 2011. He was killed in a high-speed crash involving 15 cars in the 2011 IndyCar season finale held in Las Vegas.

==Emberton Country Park==

Emberton Country Park is a Country park on the river Great Ouse. The original gravel works site where the modern park is located was transformed by Milton Keynes City Council in 1965 into a country park and is the only one in the Milton Keynes UA to be designated as such, and one of five in Buckinghamshire.

There are five lakes and a (touring) caravan park within the park area.

<doc id="394539" wikidata="Q337463" url="?curid=394539" title="Order of the Red Banner">
<text>The Order of the Red Banner () was the first Soviet military decoration. The Order was established on 16 September 1918, during the Russian Civil War by decree of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee. It was the highest award of Soviet Russia, subsequently the Soviet Union, until the Order of Lenin was established in 1930. Recipients were recognised for extraordinary heroism, dedication, and courage demonstrated on the battlefield. The Order was awarded to individuals as well as to military units, cities, ships, political and social organizations, and state enterprises. In later years, it was also awarded on the twentieth and again on the thirtieth anniversary of military, police, or state security service without requiring participation in combat (the &quot;Long Service Award&quot; variant).

== Award history ==
The Russian Order of the Red Banner was established during the Russian Civil War by decree of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee of September 16, 1918.

The first recipient was Vasily Blyukher on September 28, 1918. The second recipient was Iona Yakir.

During the Civil War, similarly named orders and decorations existed, which were established by the Soviet communist governments of several other constituent and nonconstituent republics. The August 1, 1924, decree of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee established the all-Soviet Order of the Red Banner for deserving personnel of the Red Army.

Other nonmilitary awards also used the phrase &quot;Order of the Red Banner&quot; in their title; for example, the Order of the Red Banner of Labour was presented for acts of great scientific, military (technical or logistic), manufacturing, or agricultural achievement.

From 1918 till the late 1930s there was also a Soviet collective variant – the Revolutionary Red Banner of Honor. This was in the form of a special military color awarded to distinguished Red Army, Soviet Air Force, and Soviet Navy units. It was older than the Order of the Red Banner, having been established on August 3, 1918, a month and several weeks before.

== Award statute ==
As a military decoration, the Order of the Red Banner recognised heroism in combat or otherwise extraordinary accomplishments of military valour during combat operations. Before the establishment of the Order of Lenin on April 5, 1930, the Order of the Red Banner functioned as the highest (and practically the only) military order of the USSR. During World War II, under various titles (including the Order of the Red Banner of Military Valour and Order of the Red Banner for Maritime Valour), it was presented to both individuals and military units for acts of extreme military heroism. In some ways, the Order of the Red Banner was more prestigious, as it could only be awarded for bravery during combat operations. In contrast, the Order of Lenin was sometimes awarded to non-military personnel and political leaders. Nearly all well-known Soviet commanders became recipients of the Order of the Red Banner.

When the Order was awarded to whole formations, the prefix &quot;Red Banner&quot; was added to their official designations. Naval vessels also flew a special ensign.

== Long service award ==
The Order of the Red Banner was also used as a &quot;long service award&quot; between 1944 and 1958 to mark twenty and thirty years of service in the military, state security, or police. Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of September 14, 1957, emphasised the devaluation of certain Soviet high military Orders used as long service awards instead of their originally intended criteria. This led to the joint January 25, 1958, decree of the Ministers of Defence, of Internal Affairs, and of the Chairman of the Committee on State Security of the USSR establishing the Medal &quot;For Impeccable Service,&quot; putting an end to the practice of awarding long service variants of the Order of the Red Banner.

== Award description ==
The Order, made of silver, consisted of a white-enamelled badge, which had a golden Hammer and Sickle badge surrounded by two golden panicles of wheat on a Red Star, backed by crossed hammer, plough, torch, and a red flag bearing the motto &quot;Proletarians (Workers) of all countries, Unite!&quot;. Two golden panicles of wheat surrounded the whole; at the bottom were the letters &quot;SSSR&quot; (). Additional awards of the Order bore a white enamelled shield with a silver sequence number at the bottom of the obverse. A recipient of multiple Orders of the Red Banner would wear a basic badge of the Order with a numeral corresponding to the sequence of the award on a cartouche over the wheat at the bottom of the badge.

The early variants of the Order were screw-back badges to allow wear on clothing. Later variants (from 1943) hung from a standard Soviet pentagonal mount with a ring through the suspension loop. The mount was covered with an overlapping 24mm wide red silk moiré ribbon with 1.5mm wide white edge stripes and a 7mm wide white central stripe.

The Order of the Red Banner was worn on the left side of the chest and when in the presence of other Orders and medals of the USSR, was placed immediately after the Order of the October Revolution. If worn in the presence of Orders or medals of the Russian Federation, the latter have precedence.

==Individual feats==

Feats of valour worthy of the award of the Order of the Red Banner were as much against internal as against external enemies of the USSR, as detailed below:
*Stalin&#x27;s Chief Executioner (and eventually NKVD Major General) Vasili Mikhailovich Blokhin was awarded his Order in 1941 for leading a company of executioners that performed and supervised numerous mass executions during Stalin&#x27;s reign, including more than 7,000 Poles over the course of several consecutive days.
*Pavel Dybenko won three Orders of the Red Banner, his first in the 1921 bloody suppression of the naval rebellion in Kronstadt, his two other Orders in 1922 in the suppression of peasants uprisings.
*Sasha Fillipov received his posthumous Order in 1944 for spying on, and being executed by, the Germans during the Battle of Stalingrad.
*Private Mikhail Minin was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for being the first to enter the Reichstag building on April 30, 1945, during the Battle of Berlin, and the first soldier to mount the red flag on its roof at 10:40 pm.
*Major General Mikhail Vasilyevich Vodopyanov was awarded two of his four Orders of the Red Banner for his leadership of long-range bomber groups during World War II, often personally leading the missions.
*Captain Vasily Zaytsev, won his Order as a sniper during the Battle of Stalingrad in Nov–Dec 1942, killed over 200 enemy soldiers, including 11 enemy snipers.

==Media==

*In George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Animal Farm&quot; (1945), a satire on the Soviet Union, an order called the Order of the &quot;Green&quot; Banner is created.
*William Craig&#x27;s nonfiction book, &quot;Enemy at the Gates: The Battle for Stalingrad&quot; (1973), based partially on and depicting the exploits and successful tactics of Zaytsev, was made into a feature-length film, &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot;, (2001), starring Jude Law as Zaytsev. Zaytsev&#x27;s tactics are required reading for US snipers.

<text>Marsh is a hamlet in the civil parish of Great and Little Kimble cum Marsh in Buckinghamshire, England. The hamlet name comes from the name of the Earls of Pembroke in the 12th and 13th centuries and was previously called &quot;Marshals&quot;.

Formerly a parish in its own right, it was annexed into the parish of Great Kimble in the late medieval period when its manor was purchased by Lord Griffith Hampden (ancestor of John Hampden) who was also the lord of Great Kimble manor. In the English Civil War it was reputed that King Charles I of England spent some time in hiding in the pub in the hamlet.

Today the hamlet is just a small collection of houses, a pub and a couple of farms. The name Marsh is also given to the nearby Marsh Level Crossing on the railway line that runs from Princes Risborough to Aylesbury. Marsh is close to the Chiltern hills an area of outstanding beauty, surrounded in wildlife and farms it is a perfect habitat for animals.

<text>Great Missenden is a village and civil parish in the Misbourne Valley in the Chiltern Hills in Buckinghamshire, England, situated between the towns of Amersham and Wendover. It adjoins the village of Little Kingshill, and is a mile from Little Missenden and the village of Prestwood. 

The narrow and historic High Street is bypassed by the main A413 London to Aylesbury Road. It is located in the centre of the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The source of the Misbourne is to be found just north of the village, although the upper reach of the river runs only in winter and the perennial head is in Little Missenden. The village is now best known as home to the late Roald Dahl, the world-famous adult and children&#x27;s author.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Missenden&quot; is first attested in the Domesday Book as &quot;Missedene&quot;, with other early attestations including the spellings &quot;Messedena&quot; and &quot;Musindone&quot;. The &quot;-den&quot; element probably comes from Old English &quot;denu&quot;, meaning &quot;valley&quot;, but the etymology of the first element is uncertain. It is thought to occur in the name of the River Misbourne, which rises in Great Missenden, and also in the Hertfordshire place-name Miswell. Frank Stenton and Allen Mawer guessed that it came from a hypothetical Anglo-Saxon personal name &quot;Myrsa&quot;, which they also supposed to be found in the name of Mursley. 

Eilert Ekwall suggested that the name &quot;Missenden&quot; came from a lost Old English word related to English &quot;moss&quot;, and to Danish &quot;mysse&quot; and Swedish &quot;missne&quot; (which denote plants of the genus &quot;Calla&quot;, such as water arum). Recent researchers have tentatively preferred Ekwall&#x27;s guess, in which case the name &quot;Missenden&quot; would once have meant something like &quot;valley where water-plants/marsh-plants grow&quot;.

== History ==
Great Missenden lay on a major route between the Midlands and London. Several coaching inns, particularly the Red Lion (now an estate agency) and The George (with new owners), provided rest and refreshment for travellers and their horses. The first railway line in the area was, however, routed alongside the Grand Union Canal to the east. Once the coaches stopped running Great Missenden declined in importance and prosperity, becoming an agricultural town. Following the arrival of the Metropolitan Railway, (later the London Underground&#x27;s Metropolitan line) in 1892. Great Missenden became a village where writers, entertainers and even Prime Ministers resided. Great Missenden railway station is now on the Chiltern Railways line and offers fast connecting services running into London Marylebone; it is the first station on the line that does not fall into a London Zone.

The village is overlooked by the medieval Church of England parish church, the Church of St Peter and St Paul, whereas the High Street itself is home to the Catholic Church of The Immaculate Heart of Mary, one of the largest Catholic churches in the Chiltern District. The position of the parish church away from the town centre suggests an earlier settlement around the church with a move of the village&#x27;s heart to its present location in the early Middle Ages. In the twelfth century Great Missenden was granted a charter allowing it to hold an annual Fair in August. Missenden Abbey, founded in 1133 as an Augustinian monastery, was ruined following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and the remains were incorporated into a Georgian mansion which is now a conference centre.

Gipsy House in Great Missenden was the home of author Roald Dahl from 1954 until his death in 1990, and still remains in the family, and many local scenes and characters are reflected in his work. Dahl is buried at St. Peter and St. Paul&#x27;s Church and children still leave toys and flowers at his grave. In June 2005 the Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre opened in Great Missenden to honour the work of Dahl. 

Robert Louis Stevenson, the writer of famous works such as &quot;Treasure Island&quot; and the &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;, stayed a night at The Red Lion, now 62 High Street, in Great Missenden in October 1874, which he wrote in an essay called &quot;An Autumn Effect&quot;.

The espionage novelist David Cornwell, who wrote as John le Carré, noted in a posthumously published introduction to a 2021 reissue of his first novel, &quot;Call for the Dead&quot;, that &quot;I lived in Great Missenden in those days and commuted to Marylebone station&quot;.

The village is home to the private Gateway School, Great Missenden Combined School and The Misbourne secondary school. Many children attend the local grammar schools in nearby Amersham, Chesham, Little Chalfont and High Wycombe, as well as leading local preparatory schools such as Chesham Prep, which consistently makes &quot;The Tatler&quot; list of Best Prep Schools in the UK.

Given its quaint and historic high street, the village has been used extensively as a filming location for TV drama &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;. During 1980, Hammer Film Productions filmed a small series of horror films for television, many of them filmed in and around Great Missenden. Of note is the episode &quot;Rude Awakening&quot; starring Denholm Elliott who plays an Estate Agent trapped in a recurring nightmare.

<doc id="394544" wikidata="Q334045" url="?curid=394544" title="Pierre Deligne">
<text>Pierre René, Viscount Deligne (; born 3 October 1944) is a Belgian mathematician. He is best known for work on the Weil conjectures, leading to a complete proof in 1973. He is the winner of the 2013 Abel Prize, 2008 Wolf Prize, 1988 Crafoord Prize, and 1978 Fields Medal.

==Early life and education==
Deligne was born in Etterbeek, attended school at Athénée Adolphe Max and studied at the Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB), writing a dissertation titled &quot;Théorème de Lefschetz et critères de dégénérescence de suites spectrales&quot; (Theorem of Lefschetz and criteria of degeneration of spectral sequences). He completed his doctorate at the University of Paris-Sud in Orsay 1972 under the supervision of Alexander Grothendieck, with a thesis titled &quot;Théorie de Hodge&quot;.

==Career==
Starting in 1965, Deligne worked with Grothendieck at the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques (IHÉS) near Paris, initially on the generalization within scheme theory of Zariski&#x27;s main theorem. In 1968, he also worked with Jean-Pierre Serre; their work led to important results on the l-adic representations attached to modular forms, and the conjectural functional equations of L-functions. Deligne also focused on topics in Hodge theory. He introduced the concept of weights and tested them on objects in complex geometry. He also collaborated with David Mumford on a new description of the moduli spaces for curves. Their work came to be seen as an introduction to one form of the theory of algebraic stacks, and recently has been applied to questions arising from string theory. But Deligne&#x27;s most famous contribution was his proof of the third and last of the Weil conjectures. This proof completed a programme initiated and largely developed by Alexander Grothendieck lasting for more than a decade. As a corollary he proved the celebrated Ramanujan–Petersson conjecture for modular forms of weight greater than one; weight one was proved in his work with Serre. Deligne&#x27;s 1974 paper contains the first proof of the Weil conjectures. Deligne&#x27;s contribution was to supply the estimate of the eigenvalues of the Frobenius endomorphism, considered the geometric analogue of the Riemann hypothesis. It also led to a proof of the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem and the old and new estimates of the classical exponential sums, among other applications. Deligne&#x27;s 1980 paper contains a much more general version of the Riemann hypothesis.

From 1970 until 1984, Deligne was a permanent member of the IHÉS staff. During this time he did much important work outside of his work on algebraic geometry. In joint work with George Lusztig, Deligne applied étale cohomology to construct representations of finite groups of Lie type; with Michael Rapoport, Deligne worked on the moduli spaces from the &#x27;fine&#x27; arithmetic point of view, with application to modular forms. He received a Fields Medal in 1978. In 1984, Deligne moved to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.

===Hodge cycles===
In terms of the completion of some of the underlying Grothendieck program of research, he defined absolute Hodge cycles, as a surrogate for the missing and still largely conjectural theory of motives. This idea allows one to get around the lack of knowledge of the Hodge conjecture, for some applications. The theory of mixed Hodge structures, a powerful tool in algebraic geometry that generalizes classical Hodge theory, was created by applying weight filtration, Hironaka&#x27;s resolution of singularities and other methods, which he then used to prove the Weil conjectures. He reworked the Tannakian category theory in his 1990 paper for the &quot;Grothendieck Festschrift&quot;, employing Beck&#x27;s theorem – the Tannakian category concept being the categorical expression of the linearity of the theory of motives as the ultimate Weil cohomology. All this is part of the &quot;yoga of weights&quot;, uniting Hodge theory and the l-adic Galois representations. The Shimura variety theory is related, by the idea that such varieties should parametrize not just good (arithmetically interesting) families of Hodge structures, but actual motives. This theory is not yet a finished product, and more recent trends have used K-theory approaches.

===Perverse sheaves===
With Alexander Beilinson, Joseph Bernstein, and Ofer Gabber, Deligne made definitive contributions to the theory of perverse sheaves. This theory plays an important role in the recent proof of the fundamental lemma by Ngô Bảo Châu. It was also used by Deligne himself to greatly clarify the nature of the Riemann–Hilbert correspondence, which extends Hilbert&#x27;s twenty-first problem to higher dimensions. Prior to Deligne&#x27;s paper, Zoghman Mebkhout&#x27;s 1980 thesis and the work of Masaki Kashiwara through D-modules theory (but published in the 80s) on the problem have appeared.

===Other works===
In 1974 at the IHÉS, Deligne&#x27;s joint paper with Phillip Griffiths, John Morgan and Dennis Sullivan on the real homotopy theory of compact Kähler manifolds was a major piece of work in complex differential geometry which settled several important questions of both classical and modern significance. The input from Weil conjectures, Hodge theory, variations of Hodge structures, and many geometric and topological tools were critical to its investigations. His work in complex singularity theory generalized Milnor maps into an algebraic setting and extended the Picard-Lefschetz formula beyond their general format, generating a new method of research in this subject. His paper with Ken Ribet on abelian L-functions and their extensions to Hilbert modular surfaces and p-adic L-functions form an important part of his work in arithmetic geometry. Other important research achievements of Deligne include the notion of cohomological descent, motivic L-functions, mixed sheaves, nearby vanishing cycles, central extensions of reductive groups, geometry and topology of braid groups, providing the modern axiomatic definition of Shimura varieties, the work in collaboration with George Mostow on the examples of non-arithmetic lattices and monodromy of hypergeometric differential equations in two- and three-dimensional complex hyperbolic spaces, etc.

== Awards ==
He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1978, the Crafoord Prize in 1988, the Balzan Prize in 2004, the Wolf Prize in 2008, and the Abel Prize in 2013, &quot;for seminal contributions to algebraic geometry and for their transformative impact 
on number theory, representation theory, and related fields&quot;. He was elected a foreign member of the Academie des Sciences de Paris in 1978.

In 2006 he was ennobled by the Belgian king as viscount.

In 2009, Deligne was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and a residential member of the American Philosophical Society. He is a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.

<text>The State Political Directorate (), abbreviated as GPU (), was the secret police of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from February 1922 to November 1923. It was the immediate successor of the Cheka, and was replaced by the Joint State Political Directorate (OGPU).

== Name ==
The official designation in line to the native reference is:
*Русский: = Государственное политическое управление (ГПУ) при Народном комиссариaте внутренних дел (НКВД) РСФСР
*tr =Gosudarstvennoe politicheskoe upravlenie (GPU) pri narodnom komissariate vnutrennikh del (NKVD) RSFSR – (GPU pri NKVD RSFSR)
*English: = State Political Directorate (also State Political Administration) under the People&#x27;s Commissariat of interior affairs of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR)

==Establishment==
Formed from the Cheka, the original Russian state security organization, on February 6, 1922, it was initially known under the Russian abbreviation GPU—short for &quot;State Political Directorate under the NKVD of the RSFSR&quot; (Russian: Государственное политическое управление при НКВД РСФСР, &quot;Gosudarstvennoye politicheskoye upravlenie&quot; under the NKVD of the RSFSR&quot;). Its first chief was the Cheka&#x27;s former chairman, Felix Dzerzhinsky.

==Mission==

===Internal security===
On paper, the new agency was supposed to act with more restraint than the Cheka. For example, unlike the Cheka, it did not have the right to shoot suspected &quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot; at will. All those suspected of political crimes had to be brought before a judge in normal circumstances.

===Foreign intelligence===
The &#x27;Foreign Department&#x27; of the GPU was headed by a former Bolshevik and party member, Mikhail Trilisser. The Foreign Department was placed in charge of intelligence activities overseas, including espionage and liquidation of &#x27;enemies of the people&#x27;. Trilisser himself was later liquidated by Joseph Stalin during the Great Purge in 1940.

==Disestablishment==
With the creation of the USSR in December 1922, a unified organization was required to exercise control over state security throughout the new union. Thus, on November 15, 1923, the GPU left the Russian NKVD and was reorganized as the all-union Joint State Political Directorate, also translated as &quot;All-Union State Political Administration&quot;. Its official name was &quot;Joint State Political Directorate under the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars of the USSR&quot; (Russian: &quot;Obyedinyonnoye gosudarstvennoye politicheskoye upravleniye&quot; under the SNK of the USSR, Объединённое государственное политическое управление при СНК СССР), or OGPU (ОГПУ).

<text>St Leonards is a small village in the Chiltern Hills in Buckinghamshire, England. It is 3 miles east of Wendover and 4 miles south of Tring, Hertfordshire. A short section of Grim&#x27;s Ditch delineates the northern end of the village, which lies within the civil parish of Cholesbury-cum-St Leonards.

==Early history==

===Prehistoric===
The earliest evidence of habitation is indicated by a short section of the Chiltern Grim&#x27;s Ditch linear earthwork, which is believed to have been constructed during the Iron Age. Though what remains is eroded and poorly preserved a ditch and bank are still visible. There are also examples of pottery shards, possibly associated with a small Iron Age bloomery found in a brick-earth quarry and iron slag (at Newsetts Wood) indicating there was a significant community living in the area close to the present-day Dundridge Manor. St Leonards is not mentioned in the Domesday Book however the muster roll tells us that by 1522 St Leonards was a hamlet of some 30–40 residents.

===St Leonard&#x27;s Church===
The early history of the village centres on the foundation of a chapel at St Leonards. A charter of Henry de Crokesley from around 1187 refers to him granting the manor at Dundridge to Missenden Abbey and setting aside land for the chapel-of-ease at St Leonards. By 1278 St Leonards was more closely associated with Aston Clinton. Richard Gravesend Bishop of Lincoln and Archdeacon of Oxford on a visitation granted William de Clinton Lord of the Manor of Aston Clinton, the right to establish a consecrated chapel on the site of the former hermitage belonging to Missenden Abbey. The chapel was dedicated to St Leonard of Noblac also recorded as &quot;Leonardi de Blakemere&quot; (possessive form) in 1250.). The choice of Leonardus or Leonard may have been in recognition of a hermit associated with Missenden Abbey known as the &#x27;Hermit of the Woods&#x27;, according to the Pipe Rolls of 1196. However this has not been verified and the choice of St Leonard might have been because the hermit was instead connected with St Leonard&#x27;s Hospital in Aylesbury. Blakemere is thought to be a reference to Black Mere, a marshy area and pond that appears in records from that time. (The pond survived until it was filled in around 1923).

It has been determined that most of the current church was built in the 15th century, though a piscina and sedile are of 14th century design and were probably saved from the earlier building. The bell in the Bell-Cot was made in 1702 by Chandler from Drayton Parslow. Despite the Dissolution of the Monasteries the church continued in use as a chapel-of-ease until after 1586 when an inquisition was held in the name of Queen Elizabeth into why the chapel and lands had not reverted to the crown. However following successful pleas from Silvester and Henry Baldwin, it was permitted that from 1587 services could be held there once again, for the benefit of local woodsmen, because Aston Clinton church was a good hour&#x27;s walk away, and the long journey stopped them from getting on with their work). By 1640 the church had fallen into disrepair and at the end of the English Civil War remaining were only bare walls of timber-framed construction which mainly dates to the 15th century although some evidence of the earlier chapel also remains to this day in the form of a 13th-century piscina and sedile. The building was largely rebuilt in a simple Queen Anne style around 1700, paid for by the brother of John Wood, the then minister. Within the church one of two large commemorative memorials to the Wood family, is a marble bust of General Cornelius Wood who as benefactor was responsible for the major restoration of the church at the end of the turn of the 16th century. Wood was also Colonel of the Earl of Plymouth&#x27;s Regiment of Horse until his death in 1712. His generosity also enabled the chapel to be freed from the control of the Bishop, and Trustees were given autonomy to appoint the incumbent.

===Dundridge manor===
There is a record of a manor and farm estate at Dundridge (orig. Dunryge) in the 12th century, though possibly on the site of an earlier Saxon settlement. It was part of the lands granted to Missenden Abbey, and the tenant was Henry de Crokesley. Subsequently, the manor came under the control of the Montagu family and later it came into the possession of Margaret Pole, 8th Countess of Salisbury. A lease to Dundridge Manor seems to have been held by William Baldwin (1441 – abt. 1475 or 1479), which his son Robert Baldwin inherited, as evidenced by his payment of 6 shillings and 6 pence in tax upon it in 1525. It may be presumed that the Baldwins leased the manor from its owner, the Countess of Salisbury, and later from Henry VIII. The Countess held the lands until Henry VIII&#x27;s time, when he seized them from the Abbey and had Margaret Pole beheaded. In 1545, Henry granted Dundridge to Sir John Baldwin who was Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. Though believed not related to Sir John Baldwin, Dundridge remained in the control of the Baldwin family until 1768, when the fortunes of the Baldwins waned and the house and manor lands were sold in lots.

Dundridge Manor house is recorded to have fallen into disrepair at the time it was disposed of to the Darvill (Darell) family. During the 19th century it passed through marriage to the Jeffrey family. The Rev. John Jeffrey, rector of Barnes, inherited it. After his death, in 1900, the manor house and part of the estate was sold to Robert Green. The Rodwell family lived there, breeding pheasant, until the Second World War when forced by the War Agricultural Executive Committee to relinquish the farm estate. It was purchased by the Matthews family, who have occupied it since then. The house was recorded as Grade II listed in 1983.

A Sylvester Baldwin was born at Dundridge manor around 1602. He subsequently became the tenant of Chapel Farm, part of the Dundridge estate. In 1638, with his wife and children, he set sail for New England on the ship &quot;Martin&quot;. Though Sylvester did not survive the journey, the Baldwin family successfully settled in the newly established New Haven Colony on land adjacent to the present day Milford, Connecticut, from where it spread out across the continent.

===Daniel Bacheler===
 Daniel Bacheler, sometimes spelt Batchellor, (1572–1619) was born in the village at Chapel Farm. He was a composer of lute music at the Court of Elizabeth I. He was also a servant and courier to Francis Walsingham and the Earl of Essex, particularly when the latter served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. On one occasion he was paid £10 by Elizabeth to act as go-between and deliver letters to Essex. He accompanied Walshingham to the Netherlands to recover and return to England the body of Sir Philip Sidney, Walshingham&#x27;s son-in-law. Bacheler&#x27;s close association with court life is evidenced by a contemporary mural of Sidney&#x27;s funeral procession to St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in 1587, which depicts him astride a horse. He is credited with introducing consort music and was a contemporary of John Dowland who was a lutinist at the Court of James I, whilst Bacheler had been elevated to Groom of the Privy Chamber, a position of significant trust as confidant to Anne of Denmark.

==Development of the settlement==
Around 1700 a number of unlicensed alehouses were opened and soon closed by the constables. The first licensed premise was the White Lion in 1714. Having ceased trading in 2015, an attempt to change use to residential was unsuccessful; and so through until June 2021, the pub premises were being refurbished under new ownership. The Pub is now open and running as a regular local pub, but with a mediterranean food menu. The extensive Commons at St Leonards were enclosed in 1816. St Leonards Parish Hall was built in 1938 behind which there are extensive playing fields. St Leonards National School, which was founded in 1860, across the road from the church, and remained open until 1973 when children of the village transferred to the Hawridge and Cholesbury Church of England School in Hawridge. It is now a private house. Gilberts Hill acquired its name from the post Office and grocers shop, once run by Samuel and Phoebe Gilbert which closed in 1975.

==Governance==
When civil parishes were established in 1896 the village was assigned to the parish of Aston Clinton and St Leonards. From 1934 St Leonards has formed part of Cholesbury-cum-St Leonards parish which, in addition to St Leonards comprises Cholesbury, Buckland Common and Hawridge

==Notable people==
* John Robert Blayney Owen, (1849 - 13 June 1921) who was born in the village, played one international football match for England against Scotland in 1874. He was later ordained and became headmaster of Hawkshead Grammar School.

<text>Donna Lynn Awatere Huata (sometimes written Awatere-Huata, previously known as Donna Awatere; born 1949) is a former member of the New Zealand Parliament for the ACT New Zealand Party, activist for Māori causes, and convicted fraudster.

==Early life==

Donna Awatere was born in Rotorua in 1949, and was educated in Auckland. Her primary area of study was education, particularly educational psychology, but she has also undertaken study in operatic singing and film production.

Her father, Colonel Arapeta Awatere DSO MC, was a prominent member of the Māori Battalion who was later elected to the Auckland City Council. In 1969 he was convicted of the murder of his mistress&#x27;s lover and sent to jail, where he eventually died.

==Activism==

From the 1970s Awatere became involved in the Māori protest movement, including the group Ngā Tamatoa. She was a leading protester against the 1981 Springbok Tour, and in 1984 she published &quot;Maori Sovereignty&quot;, which became a key text in the Māori protest movement. During this period she and fellow Maori activist Ripeka Evans went to Communist Cuba. She was also involved in feminist politics, and &quot;Maori Sovereignty&quot; was originally written for the feminist magazine &quot;Broadsheet&quot;. She was critical of white feminists who ignored issues of race, and expressed the opinion that the problems facing Māori were more important than those facing women and other marginalised groups. In &quot;Maori Sovereignty&quot; she is generally critical of the established left.

After the publication of &quot;Maori Sovereignty&quot;, Awatere retired from protest and became a biculturalism consultant for various organisations, including the New Zealand Treasury and the New Zealand Police. She also imported a children&#x27;s reading programme, which she later developed and promoted through the Pipi Foundation. During this period she married Wi Huata and changed her surname from Awatere to Awatere Huata.

==Member of Parliament==

===Member of Parliament===


Shortly before the , Awatere Huata joined the ACT New Zealand party. This surprised many commentators, as ACT was not generally associated with the sort of cause that Awatere Huata had previously supported. In a 2019 interview on Māori Television&#x27;s current affairs programme Te Ao with Moana, Awatere Huata claimed she joined ACT as she supported its educational policy of the funding following the child, as she believed this would make it easier to establish Kura Kaupapa and Kohanga Reo. She described herself as being at the time too &quot;economically naïve to understand [ACT&#x27;s agenda] was a neoliberal agenda,&quot; and said once discovering this she resolved to stay within parliament and &quot;fight from within&quot;. In the interview she described going with ACT as being &quot;one step too far&quot;.

Awatere Huata was ranked in fourth place on ACT&#x27;s party list, and stood as a candidate in the Māori electorate of Te Puku O Te Whenua, coming in 4th place. She was not successful in her electorate race, but entered Parliament as a list MP. In the , she polled fifth in but due to her fourth-place ranking on the party&#x27;s list consequently remained in Parliament. In the , she came 4th in and although she was lowered to fifth place on the list, nevertheless remained in parliament comfortably.

===Pipi Foundation Affair===

In 2003 Awatere Huata was expelled from the ACT party on allegations of fraud regarding the Pipi Foundation charity, which at the time was under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. Subsequently, there were a series of legal battles around Awatere Huata&#x27;s right to remain in parliament as an independent list MP. These culminated in one of the Supreme Court&#x27;s first major decisions in 2004 and she was removed from Parliament, giving the ACT Party a new MP, Kenneth Wang until the 2005 New Zealand election.

Awatere Huata was charged by the Serious Fraud Office and later convicted of fraud after taking $80,000 from the Pipi Foundation, a Government funded charity, she had set up as an MP in 1999. The media reported that &quot;Some of the stolen money was used to pay for Awatere Huata&#x27;s stomach stapling operation and some was used to pay state-integrated school fees for the couple&#x27;s children.&quot; On 30 September 2005, she was sentenced to 2 years 9 months in jail alongside her husband, Wi Huata, who received 2 years with the ability to apply for home detention. On 16 May 2006, she was released on home detention and after her sentence was completed in February 2009, she was able to set up a correspondence teaching centre &quot;The Learning Post&quot;. In October 2010 another school she and her husband ran was forced to go into liquidation owing large sums of money. NZQA said that many of the courses were inadequately supported. The school had only 15 pupils.

In a 2019 interview with Moana Maniapoto Awatere Huata stated &quot;I am proud of the fact that because of the issues that erupted around me that led to me being expelled from parliament, I actually helped bring down ACT. And that, to me, is a big achievement.&quot;

== After Parliament==
Awatere Huata worked briefly in several roles for New Zealand Māori Council, including administrative support and representing the council at the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. This was followed by a role under Mark Solomon at the Māori Carbon Foundation.

In mid-March 2022, Awatere Huata and her husband Wi Huata were ordered to vacate their home and farm on disputed land in Maraekakaho near Hastings. Justice Christine Grice ruled in favour of the Te Hua Whenua Trust&#x27;s trustees, who disputed the Huata&#x27;s lease of the land for the past 35 years. This decision reversed a Maori Land Court ruling and was appealed. The Huatas withdrew their appeal in August 2022 and vacated the land as ordered on 2 February 2024.

<doc id="394564" wikidata="Q2091177" url="?curid=394564" title="Lyra Belacqua">
<text>Lyra Belacqua ( ), later known as Lyra Silvertongue, is the heroine of Philip Pullman&#x27;s trilogy &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;. In &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; Lyra is a young girl who inhabits a universe parallel to our own. Brought up in the cloistered world of Jordan College, Oxford, she finds herself embroiled in a cosmic war between Lord Asriel on one side, and a deity figure known as The Authority and his Regent, Metatron, on the other. Lyra also features prominently in the subsequent trilogy &quot;The Book of Dust&quot;.

==Background and life==
Lyra Belacqua, aged around eleven at the beginning of the trilogy, is the daughter of Lord Asriel and Marisa Coulter in a fictional Oxford, similar to our own. She is being brought up at Jordan College, where the scholars, professors and servants treat her as an adopted daughter. She has been raised believing that her parents died in an airship crash, and that Lord Asriel is her uncle; she later learns the truth from John Faa, leader of the Gyptians. Lyra spends much of her time socialising with other children of the city, sometimes harmoniously, frequently mock-violently, and often in order to avoid schoolwork. Her closest friend among the other children is a Jordan kitchen boy named Roger Parslow, who disappears early in &quot;Northern Lights&quot;. The search to find Roger, and other children, is Lyra&#x27;s motivation throughout much of &quot;Northern Lights&quot;.

Lyra is described as having wavy dirty-blonde hair and pale-blue eyes, and is thin and short for her age. Lyra is unruly and tomboyish and her complete disregard for her appearance and personal hygiene exasperates her adult carers. She receives a scant and haphazard education at the hands of Jordan scholars, being neither interested in study nor officially a student of the college. However, she is highly intelligent, and is particularly talented at deceiving others; she is capable of making up complex yet plausible lies on the spur of the moment. Initially she uses this talent to avoid punishment by her guardians, and to entertain and deceive other children, but later in the series employs it to save her own life and the lives of others. She deceives Iofur Raknison, king of the panserbjørne (&quot;armoured bears&quot; in Danish) of Svalbard, by suggesting that she can become his dæmon if Iofur defeats Iorek in combat. Tricking a panserbjørn was a feat that her friend Iorek Byrnison had believed to be impossible for a human, and her success prompts Iorek to informally christen her &quot;Silvertongue&quot;, which is the surname by which she is known in The Secret Commonwealth.

The character&#x27;s first name comes from Lyra Davidica, which means &quot;harp of David.&quot; Lyra Davidica is the title of a hymnal collection, but Pullman mistook it for the author&#x27;s name of an Easter hymn he liked, as it was printed under the number of the hymn. He later realized it wasn&#x27;t actually a person’s name, though due to the popularity of the character, it has now become one.

Lyra&#x27;s surname, Belacqua, is the name of a character in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, a soul in the ante-purgatory, representing those who wait until the last opportunity before turning to God. The mood in the ante-purgatory is said to be one of helplessness, nostalgia, and yearning – Belacqua and the other souls in ante-purgatory are caught between two worlds and lack clear understanding of themselves. Whether this has any connection to Lyra is not known.

==Pantalaimon==
Lyra&#x27;s dæmon, Pantalaimon , is her dearest companion, whom she calls &quot;Pan&quot;. In common with dæmons of all children, he can take any animal form he pleases; he first appears in the story as a dark brown moth. His name is a given male name in the Eastern Orthodox world (Παντελεήμων &quot;Panteleēmon&quot;), which in Greek means &quot;all-compassionate&quot;. He changes into many forms throughout the series, ranging from a dragon to an eagle, but his favourite forms are a snow-white ermine, a moth, a wildcat, and a mouse. At the end of the trilogy, as Lyra is entering adulthood, Pantalaimon finds his final form when Will Parry touches him, and is later described as a beautiful pine marten, red-gold in colour with a &quot;patch of cream-white fur&quot; on his throat.

Pantalaimon is portrayed as a cautious and level-headed counterpoint to Lyra&#x27;s impulsive, inquisitive, and sometimes reckless character.

Lyra must separate from Pantalaimon when she enters the Land of the Dead in &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot;, causing extreme pain to both of them; Pantalaimon avoids Lyra for a while afterwards. However, surviving this separation allows the two to move great distances from one another, an ability only witches and shamans generally possess in her world.

==Role==
In the first novel of &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;, &quot;Northern Lights&quot; (known in US and some other countries as &quot;The Golden Compass&quot;), Serafina Pekkala tells of the prophecy of a girl who is &quot;destined to bring about the end of destiny&quot;. The witches&#x27; prophecy states that this girl will be able to pick the &quot;correct&quot; cloud-pine branch out of several, as indeed Lyra does. It transpires that Lyra&#x27;s destiny is to be the second Eve and fall into the temptation of the serpent, represented by Mary Malone. Will Parry and the Dust in the abyss are corrected, and the universes start to work in harmony. In order to ensure the stability of the universes and protect people from the creation of Spectres, Will and Lyra must close all of the inter-world windows with the help of angels and keep them closed forever – and since their dæmons cannot survive long outside of their own birth worlds, they must part forever. Despite this, they decide to sit on the same bench each year for an hour at noon on Midsummer&#x27;s Day, in the Botanic Gardens in their separate Oxfords – so that they might feel themselves to be in each other&#x27;s presence. She fulfils her destiny to &quot;bring an end to death&quot; by leading the ghosts out of the world of the dead.

In the most recent edition of &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot; released in the UK, the post-script &quot;Lantern Slides&quot; section shows Lyra studying the alethiometer (a rare truth-telling device) with Pantalaimon at age 18. She is excited to start recognising a pattern in the readings, and Pullman tells us that this discovery of a pattern is the &quot;second thing she said to Will next day in the Botanic Garden&quot;, implying that the next day was Midsummer&#x27;s Day, when she and Will would be sitting on the same bench in their separate worlds.

Letters written by Lyra included in the companion book &quot;Once Upon a Time in the North&quot; reveal that Lyra is researching her dissertation for a M.Phil. in Economic History, showing she is still studying in her twenties. The title of her dissertation is &quot;Developments of patterns of trade in the European Arctic region with particular reference to independent balloon carriage (1950–1970)&quot;. In the first letter, Lyra also mentions that she is continuing to study the alethiometer. Once she finishes her studies, she will be able to read the alethiometer not with grace, as she used to, but with certainty and knowledge.

==In other media==
In the 1999 unabridged audio production, Lyra was performed by the voice-over actress Jo Wyatt (as Joanna Wyatt).

In a 2003 BBC radio adaptation, Lyra was voiced by child actress Lulu Popplewell.

The National Theatre in London staged a two-part, six-hour-long adaptation of the novels. The production ran in 2003 and 2004; Lyra was played by Anna Maxwell Martin in the first run and by Elaine Symons in the second.

In &quot;The Golden Compass&quot;, the film adaptation of the first book, Lyra is portrayed by Dakota Blue Richards. British singer/songwriter Kate Bush wrote and recorded a song, &quot;Lyra&quot;, for the film which features choristers from Magdalen College School in Oxford.

Dafne Keen plays Lyra in the BBC television adaptation.

<doc id="394566" wikidata="Q7105082" url="?curid=394566" title="Orton, Peterborough">
<text>Orton is a suburb of the City of Peterborough, in Cambridgeshire, England, about south west of Peterborough city centre to the south of the River Nene. It is located on the route of the A1.

It expanded from the villages of Orton Waterville and Orton Longueville when Peterborough was designated as a new town. It lies in the historic county of Huntingdonshire.

Today, the suburb comprises several areas whose names each begin with Orton, such as Orton Malborne. For electoral purposes it comprises Orton Longueville, Orton Waterville and Orton with Hampton wards in North West Cambridgeshire.

==History==
Orton was designated the second township in the new town expansion of Peterborough in 1967. It is composed of the ancient villages of Orton Waterville and Orton Longueville, together with the newer developments of Orton Brimbles, Orton Goldhay, Orton Malborne, Orton Southgate, Orton Winyates, Orton Wistow and most recently Orton Northgate. All lie south of the River Nene and are thus historically in Huntingdonshire, but are not in the current local government district of that name.

In common with many New Towns the Ortons are characterised by extensive landscaping and tree planting. The A605 runs through the Ortons, connecting Peterborough to the A1(M) which runs from London to Edinburgh. There is no church in Orton Wistow or Orton Northgate: these both fall within the parish of St Andrew&#x27;s, Alwalton.

As the Ortons were established, health centres were constructed, initially in Herlington and then at the Orton Centre. For a short time there was also a small branch surgery in Orton Wistow. Due to the expansion of the area and decay of the premises at Herlington, the Orton Wistow surgery was replaced by a new surgery at Clayton, Orton Goldhay.

In 2001 Anglia Regional Co-operative Society closed its Rainbow supermarket at Orton Centre, the only major supermarket serving the Ortons. This was widely assumed to be due to competition from the Tesco Extra which had opened at nearby Serpentine Green in Hampton and the ongoing degeneration of the centre. In October 2008 the Co-operative returned to the Ortons with a new store in the regenerated Orton Centre, now renamed Ortongate.

==Orton Brimbles==
This is an area of mixed public and private sector housing dating almost entirely from the 1980s. Orton Brimbles contains the Ortons&#x27; first and only purpose-built solar powered houses at Gostwick. There is also Ormiston Meadows Academy, formerly Matley Primary School, a mainstream primary school with Enhanced Resources provision for children with physical disabilities.

There is a row of shops, including a post office, at Matley which also has a community centre where the Salvation Army hold Sunday services. Orton Brimbles falls within Orton Waterville Parish Council area.

==Orton Goldhay==
Orton Goldhay was laid out from the mid-1970s by Peterborough Development Corporation as part of the city&#x27;s second township. The area is largely residential but contains the district shopping centre known as Orton Centre, and one of the Ortons&#x27; two secondary schools, Ormiston Bushfield Academy. Much of the housing here was built for the public sector and originally housed overspill population from London.

==Orton Longueville==
Until the 1960s, Orton Longueville was a village separated from Peterborough by open farmland. Orton Longueville is home to Nene Park Academy, formerly Orton Longueville School. The &#x27;village&#x27; contains many pre-20th-century buildings including Orton Hall, once used as a prisoner of war camp during the Second World War (now a hotel), several thatched cottages, a cricket field and the 13th-century church of Holy Trinity. The church contains many historic monuments to the families who once owned properties in the village, including the Huntlys and Copes, and has a rare wall painting of St Christopher. There is still a village green and close by is a half-mile long plantation of giant redwood wellingtonia trees known as the &#x27;Long Walk&#x27;.

Orton Longueville saw many homes built after the Second World War. It is cut through north-south by the Nene Parkway (A1260) constructed in the 1970s. To the west of this road lies the original &#x27;village&#x27;, and to the east is a housing estate and some light warehousing laid out on former farmland in the latter half of the 20th century. To the north east is a newer housing area known as Botolph Green. There was a separate parish called Botolphbridge until it was combined with Longueville in 1702.

==Orton Malborne==
Similar in character to Orton Goldhay, this area was also created from the mid-1970s and lies along the dedicated bus route leading to the city centre. There are local shops at Herlington and Eldern, both of which had pubs, The Dragonfly and The Eldern (formerly The Shire Horse). Only the former remains open, the latter having been sold and converted to homes.

There is a purpose-built community centre at Herlington. A second community centre that looks like a 3-storey end of terrace house with attached hall at 156 Leighton was closed by the City Council and sold for private housing in 2009.

In the period since October 1976, five church congregations have met in the area. Christian Presence was first, established as an Anglican and later Methodist plant in a community house and later at Leighton Community Centre before moving to Herlington Community Centre in 2009. The latter has also been home to the Life Tabernacle Apostolic Church, and the building was also used by another Christian Fellowship in the 1980s. Nearby is the purpose-built St.Luke&#x27;s Roman Catholic church. The Orton Gospel Hall is at the east end of Malborne Way.

There is a primary school at Leighton and one at nearby Winyates also serves the Malborne area. Herlington has a pre-school. The Lime Academy educational trust has a campus hub for children on Malborne Way built on the site of The Tunnel Adventure Playground.

==Orton Northgate==
The latest addition to &#x27;the Ortons&#x27; and the fastest growing, Orton Northgate previously formed part of the East of England Showground site.

Orton Northgate&#x27;s local Anglican church is St Andrew&#x27;s, Alwalton.

==Orton Southgate==
This is mainly a business area containing offices and factories, including ComparetheMarket.com, NCR, Amazon, XL Displays, Yodal and others. It also contains a housing area centred on Dunblane Drive, which was partly built by Persimmon Homes around 1995, and added to by a small group of David Wilson Homes in around 1997.

The East of England Showground sold off some of its land to developers to expand the housing towards Alwalton, linking Dunblane Drive with Loch Lomond Way. However, there was a moratorium on building in October 2008, and as of February 2010 the site remained dormant.

==Orton Waterville==
One of the original &#x27;Ortons&#x27;, Orton Waterville also retains a village atmosphere and contains many thatched and stone built cottages and the 13th-century parish church of St Mary&#x27;s. It once had its own Orton Waterville railway station, but both the station and the line it stood on have now closed.

==Orton Wistow==
Orton Wistow was laid out during the 1980s by private developers, with the last developments being completed around 1992. This development lies adjacent to the Country Park known as Ferry Meadows and the Nene Valley Railway. There is a primary school called Orton Wistow Primary School.

==Transport==
Two bus services serve the Ortons. The Citi 1 runs every 10 minutes from Orton to the city centre and continues to Werrington. Route 60 links Orton Malborne with Serpentine Green, Stanground and the City Centre infrequently. Stagecoach Corby also operate Service 23 between Orton Waterville and Peterborough Queensgate bus station and Service 24 between Thrapston/Oundle and Peterborough Queensgate bus station.

<text>Machinae Supremacy is a Swedish/Finnish band that combines modern heavy metal, power metal and alternative rock with chiptunes. Self-defined as &quot;SID metal&quot;, many of their songs use a SidStation that features the SID chip of the Commodore 64. They have released 32 original recordings for free download on their site, with approximately 100,000 downloads a month.

&quot;Deus Ex Machinae&quot;, the band&#x27;s first commercial album was released in 2004 through the independent (and now defunct) MbD Records UK. The band released their second studio album, &quot;Redeemer&quot;, in 2006, and a few more studio albums, with their latest album, &quot;Into the Night World&quot;, released in December 2016, independently.

==History==

===Origin: 2000–2001===
Machinae Supremacy was formed in Luleå, Sweden during the summer of 2000 by Robert Stjärnström, Kahl Hellmer and Jonas Rörling. The name of the band had existed before this, but it was only a few months later the band decided on a specific style they wanted to pursue. Andreas Gerdin, a long-time friend of Rörling, joined on keyboards and Tobias Malm joined on drums. Together they recorded their first song, &quot;Cryosleep.&quot;

Defining an original style and being fans of the Commodore 64, they settled on using the SID chip from the machine in their music, later becoming known by the term &quot;SID metal&quot;. They described their music as carrying a vibe of self-confidence, enlightenment and encouragement for people to take control of their own lives.

===Promo: 2001–2003===
The band saw the Internet as the best way to reach a wider audience, forgoing the traditional method of sending demos to record labels. In 2001 their official website was launched, boasting around nine freely available songs. They distributed their music through the free Vorbis audio codec as well as MP3.

The band attempted to reach out to the Commodore 64 community in an attempt to gain a larger fan base. It was during this time &quot;The Great Gianna Sisters&quot; was released, a cover of the theme to &quot;Great Giana Sisters&quot; composed by Chris Hülsbeck. Releasing this song onto various Commodore 64 remix sites proved to be instrumental in the band&#x27;s early success, which was later increased by the follow-up, the &quot;Sidology&quot; series. Machinae Supremacy would go on to perform their first show abroad, at a nightclub in Soho during the &quot;Back in Time Live&quot; event.

During 2001, Stjärnström and Hellmer, together with friend Tomi Tauriainen formed the short-lived punk rock side-project, &quot;FLAK&quot;. Intending to express a political side, only three songs were released; parts of which would later go on to influence Machinae Supremacy songs. From an interview with Stjärnström &quot;FLAK is... aggression and pain! :] It&#x27;s a band, but it&#x27;s nothing serious, just a means of expression.&quot;

In 2002, Tobias Malm left the band and was replaced by Tomas Nilsén, who is a long-time friend (and previous bandmate in &quot;Garden of Concrete&quot;) of Stjärnström&#x27;s. Over the next few years, they released 25 freely downloadable songs before they began work on their first studio album.

===&quot;Deus Ex Machinae&quot;: 2004–2005===
In May 2004, the band announced the release of their first commercial album &quot;Deus Ex Machinae&quot; through Music By Design Records Ltd. (MbD). The album&#x27;s first print of 1000 copies sold out within a year, leading to a second print being released in 2005. Shortly after the release of reprint of &quot;Deus Ex Machinae&quot;, MbD ceased trading and the band were without a record label for the then-in-development second album. This album would not be released until 2006.

The band contributed to other projects that year; they worked on the soundtrack for the video game &quot;Jets&#x27;n&#x27;Guns&quot; by RakeInGrass software. The &quot;Jets&#x27;n&#x27;Guns Soundtrack&quot; was released for free in December 2004. In that year three of their songs were included in the In the Groove series of dancing games; &quot;Hybrid&quot;, &quot;Bouff&quot; and &quot;Cryosleep&quot;.

During 2005, the band&#x27;s focus was directed towards finishing and finding a way to release their second album. &quot;Ghost (Beneath The Surface)&quot; was released, as an outtake from the album.. They collaborated with the German gaming magazine &quot;GameStar&quot; to produce and release two songs, &quot;Loot Burn Rape Kill Repeat&quot; on 25 June for a &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; special, and &quot;Multiball&quot; (a medley of themes from the &quot;Pinball Dreams&quot; series) on 20 November for a &quot;Battlefield 2&quot; special.

Later that year, Hellmer moved away from Luleå and could no longer take part in the band. He was replaced by Johan Palovaara.

===&quot;Redeemer&quot;: 2006–2007===
Early in 2006, on 9 January, the band was able to release &quot;Sidology Episode II – Trinity&quot;, finally completing their &quot;Sidology&quot; series, as well as announce a sister production company Hubnester Industries, which would handle future soundtrack and commissioned work.

On 18 March of that year they were able to independently release their second commercial album, &quot;Redeemer&quot; through their own merchandise web site and store using Hubnester Industries as their own record label. Then on 27 September that year it was announced they had signed to Spinefarm Records in a 4 album record deal and would remaster and re-release &quot;Redeemer&quot; to retail on 8 November.

In late 2006 the band, with Hubnester Industries, worked on the soundtrack to the now postponed PC game &quot;War Angels&quot;, developed by Moonpod, and their third studio album. On 27 November 2006, the band&#x27;s lineup was changed with the hope of improving the quality of live performances, with Stjärnström&#x27;s guitar role passing on to Gerdin, allowing Stjärnström to focus solely on vocals, and replacing the keyboard with pre-recorded samples.

In 2007, it was confirmed that the band would produce their first music video for the song &quot;Through The Looking Glass&quot;. It was directed by Tomi Tauriainen, and shot by Torbjörn Lindbäck and was released after several delays later that year.

It was during this year that the band were asked to perform with the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra during the Play! A Video Game Symphony concert in Stockholm, part of the world-tour event featuring music from video games. They played during the song &quot;Dancing Mad&quot; from &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;. Following the success of this concert, they were asked to return to the event in Oslo, Norway with the Norwegian Radio Orchestra and the Oslo Philharmonic Choir where they played, among other songs, Metallica&#x27;s &quot;One&quot; during a &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; segment.

===&quot;Overworld&quot;: 2007–2009===
On 9 October, shortly after the band released their first music video for the song &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;, it was announced that Johan Palovaara was leaving the band, &quot;Due to different priorities, Johan Palovaara is now leaving the band to pursue other ambitions.&quot; It was later revealed it was over the band&#x27;s decision to perform at events such as Play!. Johan Hedlund was hired as the band&#x27;s new bassist.

Production began on the third album, &quot;Overworld&quot; during 2007. The first radio single from the new album, a cover of &quot;Britney Spears&quot;&#x27; &quot;Gimme More&quot;, was premiered on the Finnish station YleX in late November.

The album was released on 13 February 2008. Later in the year after a web site redesign the Vorbis audio files were replaced with lossless FLAC files. In October the band released a cover of the title theme from the 1988 video game &quot;Bionic Commando&quot; for the game&#x27;s sequel.

In August 2009, Nilsén departed the band due to &quot;personal issues&quot;. He was replaced by Niklas Karvonen in October 2009.

===&quot;A View from the End of the World&quot;: 2010–2011===
The band released their fourth studio album, &quot;A View from the End of the World&quot;, on 3 November 2010. The video for the song &quot;Force Feedback&quot; was later released in 2011.

In early 2011 the band toured Europe supporting Children of Bodom on their Ugly World Tour. A UK-only best of compilation, &quot;The Beat of Our Decay&quot;, was released on 28 March 2011 to support the tour. After four years of membership, Hedlund left the band on 19 June 2011; Gerdin switched to bass to fill his spot and Stjärstrom returned to performing his role as the band&#x27;s rhythm guitarist. The band did not release an official statement regarding his reasons.

===&quot;Rise of a Digital Nation&quot;: 2012–2013===

The fifth studio album of Machinae Supremacy, &quot;Rise of a Digital Nation&quot;, was released on 19 October 2012. It was featured on the controversial Swedish file-sharing website The Pirate Bay, leading to a significant increase in the band&#x27;s online profile.

On 5 December 2012, Machinae Supremacy announced on their official Facebook page that Tomi Luoma would be joining the band as their rhythm guitarist, first appearing with them on 10 January 2013.

A music video was made for the album&#x27;s opening track &quot;All of My Angels&quot; to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Doctor Who.

In 2013, Machinae Supremacy announced that they were working on a new album, due for release in 2014, and launched a fundraiser through their own website for a headlining European tour.
The fundraiser, which deadline was extended several times, lasted from 22 September 2013 to 12 January 2014, collecting over €37000 from more than 350 single donations. As a result, twelve different European countries were &quot;unlocked&quot;, in which a tour is planned to take place during 2014.

On 4 January 2014, Machinae Supremacy played their first show in the United States at MAGFest 12, a Music and Gaming Festival in Washington, DC.

=== &quot;Phantom Shadow&quot;: 2014–2015 ===
On 14 March 2014, Robert Stjärnström announced that the &quot;release [of the new album] won&#x27;t be until August.&quot; The new album, titled Phantom Shadow, was released on 22 August 2014.

On 9 September 2015, Machinae Supremacy announced on their Facebook page that they would have to cancel shows on the rest of their tour in Germany and the UK. Stating that &quot;On the morning of September 5th our bus driver Stefan, Gordon&#x27;s [Gerdin] father, suffered a stroke while driving between Turku to Tampere, Finland&quot;. Whilst no one was hurt in the highway collision, the driver was rushed to hospital, and they played three further shows before announcing that the rest of the tour would not go ahead.

=== &quot;Into the Night World&quot;: 2016–present ===
The seventh studio album of Machinae Supremacy, &quot;Into the Night World&quot;, was released on 16 December 2016 independently on the band&#x27;s own label, Hubnester Records.

<doc id="394583" wikidata="Q296555" url="?curid=394583" title="Philippe I, Duke of Orléans">
<text>&quot;Monsieur&quot; Philippe I, Duke of Orléans (21 September 1640 – 9 June 1701) was the younger son of King Louis XIII of France and Anne of Austria, and the younger brother of King Louis XIV. He was the founder of the House of Orléans, a cadet branch of the ruling House of Bourbon.

Styled Duke of Anjou from birth, Philippe became Duke of Orléans upon the death of his uncle Gaston in 1660. He was also granted the dukedoms of Valois, Chartres and Nemours. Known as &quot;le Petit Monsieur&quot; or simply &quot;Monsieur&quot;, Philippe was a distinguished military commander and took part in the War of Devolution and the Franco-Dutch War, the latter of which saw his victory over William of Orange at the Battle of Cassel. Through careful personal administration, he greatly augmented the fortunes of the House of Orléans, which rivalled that of the Bourbons.

Throughout his life, Philippe was open about his preference for male lovers, most notably the Chevalier de Lorraine, and freely acted with effeminacy. He married twice, first to Henrietta of England and then to Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate. Two of his daughters, Marie Louise and Anne Marie, became queens consort of Spain and Sardinia, respectively, while his son Philippe II served as regent of France from 1715 to 1723.

==Early years==

===Birth===

Philippe de Bourbon was born on 21 September 1640 at the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye in the town of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France, the day before his mother Anne&#x27;s 39th birthday. As the son of a ruling king, the infant Philippe held the rank of a &quot;Fils de France&quot; (son of France). As such, he ranked immediately behind his older brother Louis, Dauphin of France, who inherited the French throne before Philippe reached the age of three. From birth, Philippe was second in line to the throne of France and was entitled to the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot;.

He was born in the presence of his father Louis XIII, the Princess of Condé, and the Duchess of Vendôme, prominent members of the Bourbon dynasty. Philippe&#x27;s cousin, Anne Marie Louise d&#x27;Orléans, noted in her memoirs that the child&#x27;s birth was marked by celebratory cannons in Paris. An hour after his birth, he was baptised in a private ceremony by Dominique Séguier, Bishop of Meaux, and given the name Philippe. Louis XIII had wanted to give the infant the title Count of Artois in honour of a recent French victory in Arras within the county of Artois. However, Louis respected tradition and gave him the title of Duke of Anjou instead, a title commonly granted to the younger sons of French kings since the fourteenth century. After his baptism, Philippe was put in the care of Françoise de Souvré, marquise de Lansac, who also looked after his older brother, in 1643 succeeded by Marie-Catherine de Senecey.

===Le Petit Monsieur===

At the death of their father Louis XIII in May 1643, Philippe&#x27;s older brother ascended to the throne of France as Louis XIV. Their mother Queen Anne revoked the late king&#x27;s will to arrange for a power-sharing agreement with Cardinal Mazarin, who had been serving as Louis XIII&#x27;s chief minister. Anne was now in full control of her children, something she had been vying for since their birth. As the younger brother of the king, Philippe was addressed as &quot;le Petit Monsieur&quot;, since his uncle Gaston, who had also been the younger brother of a French king, was still alive. Gaston was then known as &quot;le Grand Monsieur&quot;. It was not until 1660 at the death of Gaston that Philippe would be known simply as &quot;Monsieur&quot; or as the Duke of Orléans.

The child Philippe was acknowledged to be attractive, affectionate, and intelligent. The Duchess of Montpensier dubbed him the &quot;prettiest child in the world&quot;, while his mother&#x27;s friend and confidant, Madame de Motteville, later said of Philippe that he displayed a &quot;lively intelligence&quot; early on. From 1646 on Philippe spent some of his childhood at the Hôtel de Villeroy (&quot;Cremerie de Paris&quot;), house of Nicolas de Villeroy, tutor of his brother Louis XIV. The children played there with Catherine de Villeroy and François de Villeroy.

In the autumn of 1647, at age seven, Philippe caught smallpox, but recovered and convalesced at the Palais-Royal. A year later, he was taken from the care of women and, on 11 May 1648 carried out his first official ceremony when he was baptized publicly at the Palais-Royal. His godparents were his uncle Gaston and aunt Queen Henrietta Maria of England. Later, he was placed in the care of François de La Mothe Le Vayer and the Abbé de Choisy. He was also educated by the maréchal du Plessis-Praslin. His tutors were chosen by Cardinal Mazarin, who was created the superintendent of the prince&#x27;s education by his mother. His education emphasized languages, history, literature, mathematics and dancing. Despite having a household of his own, his behavior was closely watched by his mother and Mazarin, who made sure that Philippe had no meaningful financial freedom from the crown.
When Philippe was eight, the civil war known as the Fronde began in France. It lasted until 1653 in its two main phases: the &quot;Fronde Parlementaire&quot; (1648–1649) and the &quot;Fronde des nobles&quot; (1650–1653). During the conflict, the royal family was obliged to flee Paris on the night of 9 February 1651 for the safety of Saint-Germain-en-Laye in order to avoid a revolt by the nobility against Mazarin. When peace returned, the decision was made for Philippe to move his household to the Palais des Tuileries, previously the residence of the duchess of Montpensier opposite the Palais-Royal. At the coronation of Louis XIV on 7 June 1654, Philippe acted as dean, placing the Crown of Charlemagne on his brother&#x27;s head. All his life, Philippe would be a noted lover of etiquette and panoply, ensuring that all ceremonial details were adhered to.

In late June 1658, Louis became gravely ill. Presumed to have typhoid, Louis was almost pronounced dead when, in mid-July, he began to recover. The illness made Philippe, heir presumptive to the throne, the center of attention. For fear of infection, Philippe could not see his brother. During the crisis, Queen Anne became closer to her younger son, showing him more affection. After Louis&#x27;s recovery, Philippe was once again left to his own devices. Later in 1658, Philippe made his most significant purchase, the Château de Saint-Cloud, a building about 10 kilometers west of Paris. On 8 October 1658, its proprietor Barthélemy Hervart organized a sumptuous feast at the château in honor of the royal family. Some two weeks later, on 25 October, Philippe bought the estate for 240,000 livres. He immediately began to organize improvements to what was then a small villa.

==Duke of Orléans==
When Philippe&#x27;s uncle Gaston died in February 1660, the Duchy of Orléans reverted to the crown, as he had no surviving male issue. The duchy was one of the most highly regarded appanages of the &quot;ancien régime&quot;, and it was traditionally Philippe&#x27;s birthright as the brother of the king. Thus, at the death of Gaston, Philippe himself took on the new style of Duke of Orléans and Louis XIV granted Philippe the title officially on 10 May 1661 along with the subsidiary titles duke of Valois and duke of Chartres, all registered peerages with the Parlement of Paris. He was also granted the lordship of Montargis.

In order to discourage the type of tempestuous relationship that had developed between Louis XIII and his younger brother Gaston, Anne of Austria and Cardinal Mazarin made it a private policy to prevent Philippe from pursuing ambitions which might prompt rivalry with or defiance of the king. Aside from his appanage, he was given no meaningful financial freedom from the Crown. Later, to his already rich holdings Philippe wanted to add the countship of Blois, with its Château de Chambord, and the governorship of Languedoc, but both would be refused to him by his brother.

==Marriages and love life==

===Sexuality===
During his childhood, Queen Anne was observed to address Philippe by such nicknames as &quot;my little girl&quot; and encouraged him to dress in feminine clothing even as a young man—a habit he would retain all his life. A contemporary would later call him the &quot;silliest woman who ever lived&quot;, a reference to his effeminacy. As a young man, Philippe would dress up and attend balls and parties in female attire, for example, dressed as a shepherdess. Mindful that Gaston&#x27;s treasonous habits had not only been evoked by the Fronde, but by his secret elopement with a foreign princess which had left the royal brothers estranged for years, his homosexual activity was not unwelcome, because it was seen to reduce any potential threat he may have posed to his older brother. It appears that 1658 was the key year in which Philippe&#x27;s sexuality became well defined. Court gossip said that Cardinal Mazarin&#x27;s own nephew Philippe Jules Mancini, the Duke of Nevers, had been the &quot;first to [have] corrupted&quot; Philippe in what was referred to as the &quot;Italian vice&quot;—contemporary slang for male homosexuality. Philippe certainly did make his first contacts that year with Philippe de Lorraine, known as the Chevalier de Lorraine, the male lover with whom he would establish the closest emotional attachment throughout his life.

Even once married, he reportedly carried on open romantic affairs with German nobles, with no regard to either of his two wives. Philippe&#x27;s favorites, invariably younger, handsome men, dominated contemporary and historical commentaries about his role at court, as had the &quot;mignons&quot; of Henry III. Philippe was infatuated with the famously arrogant Armand de Gramont, Comte de Guiche. There were also rumors at court that Philippe in fact had a mistress and had shown an interest in the Duchess of Mercœur, Mazarin&#x27;s niece. Another lover of Philippe at this time was Antoine Coiffier, the Marquis d&#x27;Effiat. The latter had entered Philippe&#x27;s life as captain of the chase and stayed in his household until Philippe&#x27;s death.

Among the lovers, one man stands out, Philip of Lorraine-Armagnac, the never-married Chevalier de Lorraine, who was described as &quot;insinuating, brutal and devoid of scruple&quot;. As a member of the House of Guise, ranking as a &quot;prince étranger&quot;, Philippe could keep him near while at court and promote him within his own household without initially evoking scandal or offending sensibilities. In January 1670, Philippe&#x27;s wife prevailed upon the king to imprison the chevalier, first near Lyon, then in the Mediterranean island-fortress of Château d&#x27;If. Finally, he was banished to Rome. However, by February, the Duke of Orléans&#x27; protests and pleas persuaded the king to restore him to his brother&#x27;s entourage.

===Marriage with Princess Henrietta of England===

After Louis XIV&#x27;s marriage to Maria Theresa of Spain on 9 June 1660, Queen Anne turned her attention to the marriage of Philippe. He had previously been encouraged to court his older cousin, Anne Marie Louise d&#x27;Orléans, Duchess of Montpensier, eldest daughter of Gaston and his first wife Marie de Bourbon. Known as &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; at this time, she had an immense private fortune and had previously rejected suitors such as Charles II of England. Born in 1627, she was the sole heiress of her mother, who died in childbirth. Mademoiselle declined the union, complaining that Philippe always stayed near his mother as if he was &quot;like a child&quot;. Mademoiselle instead remained unmarried. Philippe would marry instead another first cousin, Princess Henrietta of England, youngest child of King Charles I of England and his wife Henrietta Maria of France, who was Philippe&#x27;s paternal aunt and had taken refuge at the court of France after the birth of Princess Henrietta in 1644. They lived at the Palais-Royal and at the Palais du Louvre. In 1660, after the restoration of the House of Stuart to the throne of England under her brother Charles II, Princess Henrietta returned to England to visit her sister, the Princess of Orange, who later caught smallpox and died. The French court officially asked for Henrietta&#x27;s hand on behalf of Philippe on 22 November 1660 while she was in England. The couple signed their marriage contract at the Palais-Royal on 30 March 1661. The ceremony took place the next day in the same building in front of select members of the court. The dowry promised was a hefty 840,000 livres. Known as &quot;Henriette d&#x27;Angleterre&quot; in France, and &quot;Minette&quot; to her intimates, she was known officially as &quot;Madame&quot; and was ever popular with the court. Court gossip later said that the king was the father of Henrietta&#x27;s first child. Henrietta&#x27;s very open flirting is said to have caused a jealous Philippe to retaliate by beginning to flaunt his sexuality openly in a less-than-accepting era. Henrietta&#x27;s flirting with the king started early in the summer of 1661 while the newlyweds were staying at the Palace of Fontainebleau for the summer. Philippe complained to his mother about the intimacy that Louis and Henrietta displayed, which led Queen Anne to reprimand both son and daughter-in-law. Relations were further strained when Henrietta allegedly seduced Philippe&#x27;s old lover, the Comte de Guiche.

The couple moved from the Tuileries in early 1662 to the Palais-Royal. Later in March of the same year, Philippe became a father when Henrietta gave birth to their daughter Marie Louise, the future wife of Charles II of Spain. Henrietta&#x27;s disappointment at the birth of a daughter was great, and she even remarked that she should &quot;throw her into the river!&quot; This greatly offended Queen Anne, who adored her first granddaughter. For his part, Philippe would always consider Marie Louise his favourite child. The girl was baptized on 21 May 1662. On the same day Philippe took part in the famous &quot;Carrousel du Louvre&quot;, where he dressed extravagantly as the King of Persia with the king as the King of the Romans and all ladies of the court in attendance.

In 1664, Henrietta gave birth at Fontainebleau to a son who was given the title Duke of Valois. Philippe wrote to his brother-in-law Charles II of England &quot;that your sister was this morning safely delivered of a fine boy. The child seems to be in excellent health.&quot; The child nonetheless died of convulsions in 1666, having been baptized Philippe Charles d&#x27;Orléans hours before death. The loss of the little Duke of Valois affected Henrietta greatly. Philippe, however, was anxious to maintain the allowance which his son had received from the king. This death only augmented the grief of a court still in mourning for the death of Queen Anne in January. The previous year, the Comte de Guiche has been exiled from court with Philippe reporting to his mother that Henrietta had had private interviews with the dashing nobleman.
Philippe took part in the War of Devolution in 1667 while Henrietta remained at Saint-Cloud due to her pregnancy. On the field, Philippe took an active part in the trenches at Tournai and Douai and distinguished himself through his valor and coolness under fire. But Philippe later became bored with battle and interested himself more in the decoration of his tent. Hearing that Henrietta was ill due to a miscarriage, he returned to Saint-Cloud, where she was recovering from an ordeal which almost cost her her life. Upon her recovery, Philippe returned to the battlefield and distinguished himself at the Siege of Lille.

In January 1670, Henrietta prevailed upon the King to imprison the Chevalier de Lorraine, first near Lyon, then in the Mediterranean island-fortress of the Château d&#x27;If. He was finally banished to Rome after offending the King and Henrietta by boasting that he could get Philippe to divorce her. In retaliation for the Chevalier&#x27;s treatment, Philippe withdrew to his estate at Villers-Cotterêts, dragging Henrietta with him. By February, Philippe&#x27;s protests and pleas persuaded the King to restore the Chevalier to his brother&#x27;s entourage. The couple had their last child in August 1669, a daughter who was baptized Anne Marie at the private chapel of the Palais-Royal on 8 April 1670 by Philippe&#x27;s first chaplain, the bishop of Vabres.

Henrietta is best known to political historians in France for her part in negotiating the Secret Treaty of Dover, an offensive and defensive treaty between England and France signed at Dover on 1 June 1670. It required France to assist England in her aim to rejoin the Roman Catholic Church and England to assist France in her war of conquest against the Dutch Republic. The Third Anglo-Dutch War was a direct consequence of this treaty. Having returned to France at the end of June 1670, Henrietta had to endure Philippe&#x27;s blatant spite for her part in the Chevalier&#x27;s exile and her secret mission to Dover. Despite tense relations, she traveled to Saint-Cloud on 24 June, when she started to complain of pains in her side. Relaxing at Saint-Cloud on 29 June, she collapsed on the terrace at the palace. Taken inside, she was undressed and started to exclaim that she had been poisoned. She subsequently died between the hours of two and three in the morning of 30 June 1670 at the age of 26. An autopsy was performed which found that Henrietta died of peritonitis caused by a perforated ulcer; however, public rumor claimed she had been poisoned by her husband, and, according to Saint-Simon in his memoirs, even the king suspected it at first, but the inquiry he conducted revealed that it was the Chevalier de Lorraine and the Marquis d&#x27;Effiat who had poisoned her.

===Search for a second bride===

Henrietta was mourned greatly at the court of France, but little by her husband, due to their strained relationship. Louis XIV himself looked for a second wife for Philippe, who was eager to have a male heir to continue the Orléans line. Attention again turned to the duchess of Montpensier, by now known as &quot;&quot;. Louis himself asked her if she wanted to fill &quot;the vacant place&quot;, but she politely declined the offer. Louis rejected many other candidates before settling on the Protestant Princess Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate. Known as &quot;Liselotte&quot; within her family, she was the only daughter of Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine, and his estranged wife Charlotte of Hesse-Kassel. She was recommended by Anna Gonzaga, a confidante of Philippe&#x27;s and wife of the bride&#x27;s uncle, the Prince Palatine Edward. Elizabeth Charlotte had grown up with her aunt Sophia of Hanover due to her parents&#x27; bad relationship. Throughout her life she would remain in contact with the Electress Sophia, writing some 50,000 letters that detailed life at the court of France. The Princess Palatine was Henrietta&#x27;s first cousin once removed, since the latter&#x27;s father, Charles I of England, was the brother of Elisabeth Charlotte&#x27;s paternal grandmother, Elizabeth Stuart.

===Marriage with Princess Palatine Elizabeth Charlotte===

Philippe married the nineteen-year-old Elizabeth Charlotte, who converted to Roman Catholicism, on 16 November 1671. She was not attractive, as Henrietta had been. When Philippe first saw her, he is said to have remarked, &quot;How will I ever be able to sleep with her?&quot; Madame de Sévigné noted how popular the new &quot;Madame&quot; was with the court. She became renowned for her brusque candor, upright character, and lack of vanity. Her letters record how willingly she gave up sharing Philippe&#x27;s bed at his request after their children&#x27;s births and how unwillingly she quietly endured the presence of his male favourites in their household.

The couple were very happy in the first years of their marriage. The Chevalier de Lorraine was in Italy, but returned in spring 1672. Pregnant later that year, Elizabeth Charlotte gave birth to a son in June 1673 who was named Alexandre Louis and given the title Duke of Valois. The child died, however, in 1676. A second son, Philippe, followed in 1674, and then a daughter, Élisabeth Charlotte, in 1676, after which the two mutually agreed to sleep in separate beds. Elizabeth Charlotte was praised as being a natural mother. Philippe&#x27;s second son with Elizabeth Charlotte, known as the Duke of Chartres until he inherited the dukedom of Orléans in 1701, later served as Regent of France during the minority of Louis XV. Elizabeth Charlotte acted as a mother to Philippe&#x27;s children by Henrietta and maintained correspondence with them until her last days.

==Battle of Cassel==
Having already established himself as a successful military commander during the War of Devolution in 1667, Philippe was eager to return to the field. In 1676 and 1677 he took part in sieges in Flanders, and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general, which made him second-in-command to Louis XIV himself.

The most impressive victory won under Philippe&#x27;s command took place on 11 April 1677: the Battle of Cassel against William III, Prince of Orange, later the king of England and son of Philippe&#x27;s own first cousin Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange. William decided to relieve some besieged towns; from Ypres he marched with 32,000 men through Poperinge and Oxelaëre in the Cassel Valley. Philippe, who learned of his plans, arranged to meet William&#x27;s forces at Penebeek between Noordpeene and Zuytpeene. Louis XIV sent him some 25,000 foot-soldiers and 9,000 cavalry from Cambrai under the command of Marshal Luxembourg. By nightfall there were 66,000 soldiers ready for battle. The Dutch attacked the French positions without scouting first. Marshal Luxembourg surprised the Dutch with a cavalry attack that practically destroyed three battalions and routed William&#x27;s army. In all, casualties on both sides amounted to 4,200 dead and 7,000 wounded. Philippe was hailed for his skill as a military commander, much to the annoyance of his brother, the king. He was presumably jealous of Philippe&#x27;s growing popularity at court as well as on the battlefield. In honor of his victory at Cassel, Philippe set up a Barnabite College in Paris. The campaign marked the end of his military career; he soon immersed himself once again in a life of pleasure.

==Cultural expansion and property==
From the time of the victory at Cassel until the 1690s, Philippe mainly concentrated his energies on the expansion of his estates, personal fortune, and art collection, including the renovation of his residences, the Palais-Royal and the Château de Saint-Cloud. The latter was his favorite residence, the home of an ever-expanding and &quot;stormy&quot; court. Philippe became an important patron of the artists Jean Nocret and Pierre Mignard, both of whom were employed to elaborate the décor at Saint-Cloud and the Palais-Royal. As early as 1660, Philippe also ordered Antoine Lepautre to begin extensions at Saint-Cloud; later he became &quot;contrôleur général&quot; of Philippe&#x27;s properties.

Following Lepautre&#x27;s death in 1679, work on Saint-Cloud was continued by his executive assistant Jean Girard in collaboration with Thomas Gobert. Later on, Philippe sought Jules Hardouin-Mansart to design a grand staircase in the left wing in the manner of the Ambassadors&#x27; Staircase at Versailles. The gardens were redesigned by André Le Nôtre, while the basin and lowermost canal were added by Mansart in 1698. At the time of Philippe&#x27;s death in 1701, the estate of Saint-Cloud covered some .
Saint-Cloud remained with the Orléans family until 1785, when Philippe&#x27;s great-grandson Louis Philippe d&#x27;Orléans sold it to Marie Antoinette, Philippe&#x27;s great-granddaughter, for the sum of six million livres.
Minor improvements at the Palais-Royal began in 1661 at the time of Philippe&#x27;s marriage to Henrietta, but the property was part of the crown holdings, and had not been used officially for years. Philippe was limited in what he could do to renovate the building until it was given to him in 1692. Philippe again turned to Mansart for assistance in modernizing it. The interior décor was entrusted to Antoine Coypel, whose father Noël Coypel had previously worked at the palace. In 1695, Philippe bought a small island in the Seine directly opposite the château, which he renamed the &quot;&quot;.

Philippe not only enjoyed architecture and court society, but also music and dancing; he was in fact famed for his exceptional dancing abilities. Philippe was a patron of musicians such as Jean-Henri d&#x27;Anglebert, Henri Dumont, Jacques-Antoine Arlaud and Marie Aubry, many of whom would stay part of his son&#x27;s household after his death in 1701. Jean-Baptiste Lully was also a protégé of Philippe after he left Mademoiselle&#x27;s household. Philippe&#x27;s small art collection created the basis for the &quot;Orleans Collection&quot;, one of the most important art collections ever assembled.

With the permission of the Parlement of Paris, Philippe sponsored projects to help maintain his estates and enhance their profitability. From 1679, he was granted the right to build the Canal d&#x27;Orléans, a large canal that connected the River Loire at Orléans to a junction with the Canal du Loing and the Canal de Briare in the village of Buges near Montargis. As the largest canal built in France since Philippe&#x27;s grandfather Henry IV built the Canal de Briare in 1604, its construction was considered an engineering feat. The canal, used to transport goods from Orléans to Paris, was a great success in its time and is still used widely today. Philippe&#x27;s careful investment and management of his various estates made him a wealthy man in his own right, and his fortune was augmented considerably at the death of his cousin Mademoiselle in 1693. Philippe is acknowledged as being not only the biological founder of the House of Orléans, but as financial founder of a family whose monetary value would rival that of the main line of the House of Bourbon.

==Later years==
Upon the death of Mademoiselle in 1693, Philippe acquired the dukedoms of Montpensier, Châtellerault, Saint-Fargeau and Beaupréau. He also became prince of Joinville, count of Dourdan, Mortain and Bar-sur-Seine and viscount of Auge and Domfront. In later life, Philippe was thus able to maintain his lavish lifestyle easily, and he found much satisfaction in the activities of his children and grandchildren. Both of his daughters by his first wife Henrietta married influential European sovereigns, eventually becoming queens, and his son the Duke of Chartres pursued an active and distinguished military career, having served at the Battle of Steenkerque in 1692 as well as the Siege of Namur, much to his father&#x27;s pride. As he had with Philippe, Louis XIV was careful to limit the power of Chartres.
In 1696, Philippe&#x27;s granddaughter Marie-Adélaïde came to the French court from Italy for her marriage to Louis, Duke of Burgundy, who was third in line to the throne. The two were married in 1697 and became the parents of Louis XV. In 1701, Chartres was denied a position on the front in the War of the Spanish Succession, which began that year. This slight was the source of great bitterness on the part of both father and son after. The pretext seems to have been the behavior of Chartres in parading his mistress Mademoiselle de Séry in view of his wife. On 8 June 1701, Louis XIV and Philippe met at the Château de Marly to dine together. At first meeting, Louis XIV attacked Philippe about Chartres&#x27; conduct with Mademoiselle de Séry. Philippe responded by reprimanding Louis for similar conduct with his own mistresses during his marriage to Queen Marie Thérèse, adding that Chartres had still not received the favors promised to him for having married the King&#x27;s legitimized daughter, Françoise Marie. Nonetheless, the announcement of dinner halted the argument, and the brothers sat down to dine.

Philippe angrily returned to Saint-Cloud early the same evening to dine with his son. Philippe collapsed onto his son after suffering a fatal stroke at noon 9 June 1701 at the age of sixty. Louis XIV, upon hearing his only sibling had died, said &quot;I cannot believe I will never see my brother again.&quot; The Duchess of Burgundy, his granddaughter, was likewise distraught, avowing that she &quot;had loved Monsieur very much&quot;. Philippe&#x27;s heart was taken to the Val-de-Grâce convent on 14 June, and his body was taken on 21 June to the Basilica of St Denis, where it remained until the French Revolution, at which time the basilica was desecrated and all graves destroyed.

Worried that she would be put in a convent, a stipulation of her marriage contract in the event of Philippe&#x27;s death, Elizabeth Charlotte was assured by the king that she could remain at court as long as she wished. She burnt all the letters of Philippe&#x27;s lovers through the years, lest they fall into &quot;the wrong hands&quot;, observing that the scent of the perfumed letters nauseated her. Louis XIV assured the new Duke of Orléans, formerly the Duke of Chartres, that the past was forgotten and that henceforth he was to look on him as his father. The court was devastated, and his old friend, Louis XIV&#x27;s discarded mistress Madame de Montespan, was also greatly affected, the two having been very close. The widowed Elizabeth Charlotte continued to write frequently to her daughter, stepdaughter, the Duchess of Modena, and the Princess of Wales. She herself died at Saint-Cloud in December 1722, and was also buried at Saint-Denis.

<text>The Royal Buckinghamshire Hospital (colloquially called the Royal Bucks) is a private hospital in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. It is a Grade II listed building.

==History==
The hospital was established, by adding new wings to an 18th-century country house, in 1832. The facility was extensively remodeled to a design by David Brandon using a pavilion layout which was heavily influenced by Florence Nightingale through her brother-in-law, Sir Harry Verney of Claydon House. She said that &quot;it will be the most beautiful hospital in England.&quot; The new hospital was opened as the Buckinghamshire General Infirmary in 1862.

It is thought that the hospital became &quot;Royal&quot; after the Prince of Wales received treatment there in the late 19th century. A new wing, the foundation stone for which was laid by Lord Rothschild, followed in 1905.

Following the expansion of the Stoke Mandeville Hospital nearby, the Royal Buckinghamshire Hospital joined the National Health Service as a maternity hospital in 1948. It became a private hospital in 1994 and, after acquisition by Affinity Care Homes and an extensive subsequent refurbishment, it reopened as a facility for the treatment of patients with spinal cord, acquired brain injury and other neurological conditions in 2013. 

In January 2023, it was announced that the Royal Buckinghamshire Hospital would undergo an extensive refurbishment and be acquired by the Akessa Healthcare Group along with The Foscote Hospital and 107 Harley Street in January 2023.

<text>Ávila ( , , ) is a city of Spain located in the autonomous community of Castile and León. It is the capital and most populated municipality of the Province of Ávila.

It lies on the right bank of the Adaja river. Located more than 1,130 m above sea level, the city is the highest provincial capital in Spain.

Distinctively known by its medieval walls, Ávila is sometimes called the &quot;Town of Stones and Saints&quot;, and it claims that it is one of the towns with the highest number of Romanesque and Gothic churches per capita in Spain. It has complete and prominent medieval town walls, built in the Romanesque style; writer José Martínez Ruiz, in his book &quot;El alma castellana&quot; (&quot;The Castilian Soul&quot;), described it as &quot;perhaps the most 16th-century town in Spain&quot;. The town is also known as &quot;Ávila de los Caballeros&quot;, &quot;Ávila del Rey&quot; and &quot;Ávila de los Leales&quot; (&quot;Ávila of the knights&quot;, &quot;Ávila of the king&quot;, &quot;Ávila of the loyal ones&quot;), each of these epithets being present in the town standard.

Orson Welles once named Ávila as the place in which he would most desire to live, calling it a &quot;strange, tragic place&quot;. Various scenes of his 1965 film &quot;Chimes at Midnight&quot; were filmed in the town.

Ávila was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985. The site originally consisted of the walled city and four extra muros churches. The number of churches included in the site has since been increased.

==Geography==
Situated 1132 metres (3714 feet) above sea level on a rocky outcrop on the right bank of the Adaja river, a tributary of the Duero, Ávila is the highest provincial capital in Spain. It is built on the flat summit of a rocky hill, which rises abruptly in the midst of a veritable wilderness; a brown, arid, treeless table-land, strewn with immense grey boulders, and shut in by lofty mountains.

==Climate==
Ávila&#x27;s position results in a warm summer mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot;, according to the Köppen climate classification) bordering on a cold semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;) with warm summers and chilly winters with snowfalls. The hottest month, July, has an average temperature of , and the coldest month, January, has an average of . The average annual precipitation is . Annual rainfall is low compared to surrounding areas, implying that it lies in a rain shadow. The Adaja is dry for several months of the year and the town has historically had water supply problems. Ávila has the coldest winter low temperatures of the Spanish provincial capital cities, thanks to its high altitude ( above sea level).

==History==
In pre-Roman times (the 5th century BC), Ávila was inhabited by the Vettones, who called it &quot;Obila&quot; (Ὀβίλα) (&quot;High Mountain&quot;) and built one of their strongest fortresses here. There are Bronze Age stone statues of boars (known as verracio) nearby.
Ávila may have been the ancient town known as &quot;Abula&quot;, mentioned by Ptolemy in his &quot;Geographia&quot; (II 6, 60) as being located in the Iberian region of Bastetania. &quot;Abula&quot; is mentioned as one of the first towns in Hispania that was converted to Christianity by Secundus of Abula (&quot;San Segundo&quot;), however, &quot;Abula&quot; may alternatively have been the town of Abla.

After the conquest by ancient Rome, the town was called &quot;Abila&quot; or &quot;Abela&quot;. The plan of the town remains typically Roman; rectangular in shape, with its two main streets (cardo and decumanus) intersecting at a forum in the centre. Roman remains that are embedded in town walls at the eastern and southern entrances (now the Alcazar and Rastro Gates) appear to have been ashlar altar stones.

By tradition, in the 1st century, Secundus, having travelled via the Roman province of Hispania Baetica, brought the Gospel to Ávila, and was created its first bishop.

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Ávila became a stronghold of the Visigoths. Conquered by the Moors (Arabs) (who called it Ābila, آبلة), it was repeatedly attacked by the northern Iberian Christian kingdoms, becoming a virtually uninhabited no man&#x27;s land. It was repopulated about 1088 following the definitive reconquest of the area by Raymond of Burgundy, son in law of Alfonso VI of León and Castile. He employed two foreigners, Casandro Romano and Florin de Pituenga, to construct a stone frontier town and creating the walls that still stand. Ávila hosted a Jewish community in the middle ages. The first written evidence documenting the presence of Jews dates to 1144. By the end of the 13th century, the Jewish population in Ávila was one of the largest in Castile. In 1375, the Jews of Ávila were forced to watch a religious disputation between Juan de Valladolid and Moses ha-Kohen of Tordesillas. After the 1492 expulsion of the Jews, the Jewish community was nonexistent.

The city achieved a period of prosperity under the Catholic Monarchs in the early 16th century.

During the Revolt of the Comuneros, the city became the first meeting place of the Santa junta (the Holy governing board) on 1 August 1520. The Junta of Ávila drafted the &quot;Proyecto de Ley Perpetua&quot; (a sort of proto-constitutional draft that never came into force) in the Cathedral of Ávila in the Summer of 1520, envisaging that cities assembled every three years without the requirement for royal sanction or presence, determining taxation and acting as a check and balance on government activity.

The city experienced a long decline since the 17th century, its population reducing to just 4,000 inhabitants.

In the 19th century, there was some population growth with the construction of the railway line from Madrid to the French border at Irun and an important junction near the town.

In 1936, at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, the town quickly became part of the area occupied by rebel troops. Growth continued slowly again under Franco, but Ávila has not had a major influence in Spanish society in recent history, apart from the nurturing of politicians such as Adolfo Suárez, the first democratically elected prime minister of Spain post-Franco, and José María Aznar, prime minister from 1996 to 2004, who represented Ávila in the Cortes but was not from the town.
==Architecture==
===The Walls of Ávila===

The main landmark in the city is the imposing Walls of Ávila (11th–14th centuries), begun in 1090. The enclosed area is with a perimeter of , 88 blocks of semicircular towers, 2,500 merlons, curtain walls thick, with an average height of , and 9 gates.

The walls represent the largest fully illuminated monument in the world. It is possible to walk upon the walls for roughly half their circumference. While some of the walls will never be walkable because of their integration into other structures, a large stretch has yet to be made safe for pedestrians.

===Cathedral===
The construction of the iron-grey granite Gothic Cathedral of Ávila is said to have commenced in 1107 under Alvar Garcia de Estrella. Other historians believe the cathedral to be the work of the master mason Fruchel in the 12th century, coinciding with the repopulation of the town led by Raymond of Burgundy. The eastern apse, which forms part of the town walls, is half church, half fortress, and it was here that the loyal citizens elevated Alonso VII as their king, hence &quot;Ávila del Rey&quot;. The transept was finished in 1350 by Bishop Sancho de Ávila. The earlier Romanesque parts are made of a striking red-and-white &quot;blood&quot; limestone, while the Gothic parts were built with pure white stone.
* Northern façade: Gothic style at left and added renaissance at right. Porch of the Apostles.
* Western front: Burgundian style, with two towers forming a covered portal.

===Convento de San José===
The Convent of Saint Joseph is the first monastery of Discalced Carmelite nuns founded by Saint Teresa of Jesus. The convent was built in the year of 1562, although the most important architectural element, the church, was built in 1607. The church was designed by the architect Francisco de Mora (1553–1610). It has been designated a national monument since 1968.

===Ermita de San Segundo===

A hermitage located to the west of Ávila, outside the town walls, on the right bank of the Adaja river. It highlights the sculpted capitals in which the sculptor is the footprint of the apse of San Andrés. Alabaster statues were made by Juan de Juni. Popular belief has it that, on introducing a handkerchief into the tomb and asking for three wishes, the saint will grant one. His pilgrimage is celebrated on 2 May, Segundo being the patron saint of Ávila.

== Transport and services ==

The Ávila Railway Station serves the town. The closest airport is Adolfo Suárez in Madrid-Barajas. The city can be reached via the A-6 from Madrid. The city itself can be explored on foot, although there is a public service of buses running throughout the city. Also, there is a bus station that has intercity bus connections; it was built to replace the 1974-era old station located on Avenida de Madrid. There is an underground parking lot under the main square (&quot;El grande&quot;). 

The Old Town city zone is nowadays closed to private cars, and outside the walls are many roundabouts that help traffic flow, and the ring road that goes from the bus station to the southern zone bordering the walls makes it possible to cross the entire city by car or walking in less than 30 minutes. In the 70s and 80s most traffic lights were replaced with roundabouts, but many lights still exist in the central zone where it is not possible to put roundabouts. Also in that time, the city had relatively large growth, which led to the creation of many social neighborhoods around the old town area. 

The Hospital Nuestra Señora de Sonsoles (Our lady of Sonsoles Hospital), the Adolfo Suárez stadium, the residential zones as Urbanización Las Hervencias, la ciudad deportiva (sporting city) with pools, a running track, soccer and football camp; the office building (La calera), the tower-residential flats zone (Madrigal de Altas Torres), the workers&#x27; quarter like San José Obrero (St. Joseph of the Worker), the retirement building (Residencia de tercera edad), the students&#x27; residence (Valle Ambles), hotels like Don Carmelo and Sercotel, new schools and high schools, and the 4-lane principal avenues Hornos Caleros and Carretera de Valladolid were built in the 70s and 80s. This doubled the population and provided the city with modern services. Nowadays, there is a mall near the hospital in the northern zone.

<doc id="394592" wikidata="Q1847111" url="?curid=394592" title="Messaging spam">
<text>Messaging spam, sometimes called SPIM, is a type of spam targeting users of instant messaging (IM) services, SMS, or private messages within websites.

==Instant messaging applications==
Instant messaging systems, such as Telegram, WhatsApp, Twitter Direct Messaging, Kik, Skype and Snapchat are all targets for spammers. Many IM services are publicly linked to social media platforms, which may include information on the user such as age, sex, location and interests. Advertisers and scammers can gather this information, sign on to the service, and send unsolicited messages which could contain scam links, pornographic material, malware or ransomware. With most services users can report and block spam accounts, or set privacy settings so only contacts can contact them.

==Countermeasures==

* Many users choose to receive IMs only from people already on their contact list.
* In corporate settings, spam over IM is blocked by IM spam blockers like those from Actiance, ScanSafe, and Symantec.
* IM providers like Kik have a &quot;report user&quot; button, which sends a chatlog to the IM administrators who can then take action.

== Pornographic IM spambots ==
Spam-bots often sign on to popular messaging services like Kik or Skype to spread pornographic images. Often if the user responds they receive a URL inviting them to a private livestream that will ask them to enter credit card details for &quot;age verification&quot;.

These bots target random usernames; this often results in minors receiving unsolicited pornographic images.

==On Windows NT-based systems==
In 2002, a number of spammers began abusing the Windows Messenger service, a function of Windows designed to allow administrators to send alerts to users&#x27; workstations (not to be confused with Windows Messenger or Windows Live Messenger, a free instant messaging application) in Microsoft&#x27;s Windows NT-based operating systems. Messenger Service spam appears as normal dialog boxes containing the spammer&#x27;s message. These messages are easily blocked by firewalls configured to block packets to the NetBIOS ports 135-139 and 445 as well as unsolicited UDP packets to ports above 1024. Additionally, Windows XP Service Pack 2 disables the Messenger Service by default.

Messenger Service spammers frequently send messages to vulnerable Windows machines with a URL. The message promises the user to eradicate spam messages sent via the Messenger Service. The URL leads to a website where, for a fee, users are told how to disable the Messenger service. Though the Messenger is easily disabled for free by the user, this works because it creates a perceived need and then offers an immediate solution.

==In opinion-based recommender systems==
In an opinion based recommender system, an important concern is how to evaluate the user-generated reviews on the items. One of the purpose of this evaluation is to identify malicious or spam reviews. Poorly written reviews are considered helpless to the recommender system. However, even if a review is well generated, they can still be harmful to the recommender system by their biased prejudice to form an actual advertisement or slander towards a target item.

Current approach of spam detection methods includes analyzing the spam text and identifying the spam reviewers by their reviews and activities. For the first kind, a machine learning application on review text has been developed. For the second kind, researchers use network motif analysis technique to identify spam reviewers by their recurring reviewing activity.

<text>David Bryant Mumford (born 11 June 1937) is an American mathematician known for his work in algebraic geometry and then for research into vision and pattern theory. He won the Fields Medal and was a MacArthur Fellow. In 2010 he was awarded the National Medal of Science. He is currently a University Professor Emeritus in the Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown University.

==Early life and education==
Mumford was born in Worth, West Sussex in England, of an English father and American mother. His father William started an experimental school in Tanzania and worked for the then newly created United Nations.

He attended Phillips Exeter Academy, where he received a Westinghouse Science Talent Search prize for his relay-based computer project. Mumford then went to Harvard University, where he became a student of Oscar Zariski. At Harvard, he became a Putnam Fellow in 1955 and 1956. He completed his PhD in 1961, with a thesis entitled &quot;Existence of the moduli scheme for curves of any genus&quot;. He married Erika Mumford (1935-1988), an author and poet, in 1959 and they had four children, Stephen, Peter, Jeremy, and Suchitra. He currently has seven grandchildren.

Mumford&#x27;s work in geometry combined traditional geometric insights with the latest algebraic techniques. He published on moduli spaces, with a theory summed up in his book &quot;Geometric Invariant Theory&quot;, on the equations defining an abelian variety, and on algebraic surfaces.

His books &quot;Abelian Varieties&quot; (with C. P. Ramanujam) and &quot;Curves on an Algebraic Surface&quot; combined the old and new theories. His lecture notes on scheme theory circulated for years in unpublished form, at a time when they were, beside the treatise Éléments de géométrie algébrique, the only accessible introduction. They are now available as &quot;The Red Book of Varieties and Schemes&quot; ().

Other work that was less thoroughly written up were lectures on varieties defined by quadrics, and a study of Goro Shimura&#x27;s papers from the 1960s.

Mumford&#x27;s research did much to revive the classical theory of theta functions, by showing that its algebraic content was large, and enough to support the main parts of the theory by reference to finite analogues of the Heisenberg group. This work on the equations defining abelian varieties appeared in 1966–7. He published some further books of lectures on the theory.

He also is one of the founders of the toroidal embedding theory; and sought to apply the theory to Gröbner basis techniques, through students who worked in algebraic computation.

==Work on pathologies in algebraic geometry==
In a sequence of four papers published in the &quot;American Journal of Mathematics&quot; between 1961 and 1975, Mumford explored pathological behavior in algebraic geometry, that is, phenomena that would not arise if the world of algebraic geometry were as well-behaved as one might expect from looking at the simplest examples. These pathologies fall into two types: (a) bad behavior in characteristic p and (b) bad behavior in moduli spaces.

===Characteristic-&quot;p&quot; pathologies===
Mumford&#x27;s philosophy in characteristic &quot;p&quot; was as follows:

A nonsingular characteristic &quot;p&quot; variety is analogous to a general non-Kähler complex manifold; in particular, a projective embedding of such a variety is not as strong as a Kähler metric on a complex manifold, and the Hodge–Lefschetz–Dolbeault theorems on sheaf cohomology break down in every possible way.

In the first Pathologies paper, Mumford finds an everywhere regular differential form on a smooth projective surface that is not closed, and shows that Hodge symmetry fails for classical Enriques surfaces in characteristic two. This second example is developed further in Mumford&#x27;s third paper on classification of surfaces in characteristic &quot;p&quot; (written in collaboration with E. Bombieri). This pathology can now be explained in terms of the Picard scheme of the surface, and in particular, its failure to be a reduced scheme, which is a theme developed in Mumford&#x27;s book &quot;Lectures on Curves on an Algebraic Surface&quot;. Worse pathologies related to p-torsion in crystalline cohomology were explored by Luc Illusie (Ann. Sci. Ec. Norm. Sup. (4) 12 (1979), 501–661).

In the second Pathologies paper, Mumford gives a simple example of a surface in characteristic &quot;p&quot; where the geometric genus is non-zero, but the second Betti number is equal to the rank of the Néron–Severi group. Further such examples arise in Zariski surface theory. He also conjectures that the Kodaira vanishing theorem is false for surfaces in characteristic &quot;p&quot;. In the third paper, he gives an example of a normal surface for which Kodaira vanishing fails. The first example of a smooth surface for which Kodaira vanishing fails was given by Michel Raynaud in 1978.

===Pathologies of moduli spaces===
In the second Pathologies paper, Mumford finds that the Hilbert scheme parametrizing space curves of degree 14 and genus 24 has a multiple component. In the fourth Pathologies paper, he finds reduced and irreducible complete curves which are not specializations of non-singular curves.

These sorts of pathologies were considered to be fairly scarce when they first appeared. But Ravi Vakil in his paper &quot;Murphy&#x27;s law in algebraic geometry&quot; showed that Hilbert schemes of nice geometric objects can be arbitrarily &quot;bad&quot;, with unlimited numbers of components and with arbitrarily large multiplicities (Invent. Math. 164 (2006), 569–590).

==Classification of surfaces==

In three papers written between 1969 and 1976 (the last two in collaboration with Enrico Bombieri), Mumford extended the Enriques–Kodaira classification of smooth projective surfaces from the case of the complex ground field to the case of an algebraically closed ground field of characteristic &quot;p&quot;. The final answer turns out to be essentially the same as the answer in the complex case (though the methods employed are sometimes quite different), once two important adjustments are made. The first is that one may get &quot;non-classical&quot; surfaces, which come about when &quot;p&quot;-torsion in the Picard scheme degenerates to a non-reduced group scheme. The second is the possibility of obtaining quasi-elliptic surfaces in characteristics two and three. These are surfaces fibred over a curve where the general fibre is a curve of arithmetic genus one with a cusp.

Once these adjustments are made, the surfaces are divided into four classes by their Kodaira dimension, as in the complex case. The four classes are:
a) Kodaira dimension minus infinity. These are the ruled surfaces.
b) Kodaira dimension 0. These are the K3 surfaces, abelian surfaces, hyperelliptic and quasi-hyperelliptic surfaces, and Enriques surfaces. There are classical and non-classical examples in the last two Kodaira dimension zero cases.
c) Kodaira dimension 1. These are the elliptic and quasi-elliptic surfaces not contained in the last two groups.
d) Kodaira dimension 2. These are the surfaces of general type.

==Awards and honors==

Mumford was awarded a Fields Medal in 1974. He was a
MacArthur Fellow from 1987 to 1992. He won the Shaw Prize in 2006. In 2007 he was awarded the Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition by the American Mathematical Society. In 2008 he was awarded the Wolf Prize; on receiving the prize in Jerusalem from Shimon Peres, Mumford announced that he was donating half of the prize money to Birzeit University in the Palestinian territories and half to Gisha, an Israeli organization that promotes the right to freedom of movement of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. He also served on the Mathematical Sciences jury for the Infosys Prize in 2009 and 2010. In 2010 he was awarded the National Medal of Science. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

<doc id="394596" wikidata="Q17148664" url="?curid=394596" title="Newsgroup spam">
<text>Newsgroup spam is a type of spam where the targets are Usenet newsgroups. Usenet convention defines spamming as excessive multiple posting, i.e. repeated posting of a message or very similar messages to newsgroups. The spam may be commercial advertisements, opinionated messages, malicious files, or nonsensical posts designed to disrupt the newsgroups. A type of newsgroup spam is sporgery which is intended to make the targeted newsgroups unreadable. The prevalence of Usenet spam led to the development of the Breidbart Index as an objective measure of a message&#x27;s &quot;spamminess&quot;, and attempts to purge newsgroups of spam.

==History==
Spamming of Usenet newsgroups pre-dates e-mail spam. The first widely recognized Usenet spam (though not the most famous) was posted on 18 January 1994 by Clarence L. Thomas IV, a sysadmin at Andrews University. Entitled &quot;Global Alert for All: Jesus is Coming Soon&quot;, it was a fundamentalist religious tract claiming that &quot;this world&#x27;s history is coming to a climax.&quot; The newsgroup posting bot Serdar Argic also appeared in early 1994, posting tens of thousands of messages to various newsgroups, consisting of identical copies of a political screed relating to the Armenian genocide.

The first &quot;commercial&quot; Usenet spam, and the one which is often (mistakenly) claimed to be the first Usenet spam of any sort, was an advertisement for legal services entitled &quot;Green Card Lottery – Final One?&quot;. It was posted on 12 April 1994, by Arizona lawyers Laurence Canter and Martha Siegel, and hawked legal representation for United States immigrants seeking green cards.

Usenet convention defines spamming as &quot;excessive multiple posting&quot;, that is, the repeated posting of a message (or substantially similar messages). During the early 1990s there was substantial controversy among Usenet system administrators (news admins) over the use of cancel messages to control spam. A &quot;cancel message&quot; is a directive to news servers to delete a posting, causing it to be inaccessible. Some regarded this as a bad precedent, leaning towards censorship, while others considered it a proper use of the available tools to control the growing spam problem.

A culture of neutrality towards content precluded defining spam on the basis of advertisement or commercial solicitations. The word &quot;spam&quot; was usually taken to mean &quot;excessive multiple posting (EMP)&quot;, and other neologisms were coined for other abuses – such as &quot;velveeta&quot; (from the processed cheese product of that name) for &quot;excessive cross-posting&quot;. A subset of spam was deemed &quot;cancellable spam&quot;, for which it is considered justified to issue third-party cancel messages.

In the late 1990s, spam became used as a means of vandalising newsgroups, with malicious users committing acts of sporgery to make targeted newsgroups all but unreadable without heavily filtering. A prominent example occurred in alt.religion.scientology.

Prevalent in recent times is the MI-5 Persecution spam, which is well known across many newsgroups. These rambling postings often appear as clusters of twenty or more messages with varying subjects and content, but all related to Mike Corley&#x27;s perceived surveillance of himself by MI5, the British intelligence agency. These rambling messages used to state the originator as MI5Victim@mi5.gov.uk. Lately (December 2007) the spammer has taken to altering the &quot;from&quot; address and subject line in an attempt to get past newsgroup &quot;kill&quot; filters. This UK-based spammer readily admits that he has mental illness in several of his postings. See also &quot;The Corley Conspiracy&quot;.

The prevalence of Usenet spam led to the development of the Breidbart Index as an objective measure of a message&#x27;s &quot;spamminess&quot;. The use of the BI and spam-detection software has led to Usenet being policed by anti-spam volunteers, who purge newsgroups of spam by sending cancels and filtering it out on the way into servers. This very active form of policing has meant that Usenet is a far less attractive target to spammers than it used to be, and most of the industrial-scale spammers have now moved into e-mail spam instead.

== Google Usenet news archive ==
The advent of the large Usenet archive kept as part of the Google Groups website, has made Usenet more attractive to spammers than ever. The goal in this case is not just to reach the members of a newsgroup, but to also take advantage of the fact that Google gives a higher pagerank to websites that are referred to by these messages, which are catalogued and mirrored in multiple languages at Google&#x27;s top-level domain. Critics have suggested that Google has ulterior motives for &quot;turning a blind eye&quot; to the problem since the websites being pointed to use Google ads, which potentially generate revenue for both the spammer AND Google. The spam is extremely unfair to the companies paying Google and the spammer for an ad-click, as the most prevalent current spam (2010) is trying to trick readers into clicking on web ads by referring to them as images and saying that a link is hidden in them &quot;due to high sex content&quot; or that a link hidden in the image (Google ad) will take them to a &quot;PayPal form&quot; that will give them money.

While most newsreaders filter the spam at either the server or user level, Google does not filter spam out of its Usenet News archive. Google does, however, offer spam filtering for groups that decide to abandon Usenet and form a moderated Google Group, which gives another reason why Google would turn a blind eye to spam in its archive of Usenet News.

<doc id="394602" wikidata="Q42087" url="?curid=394602" title="Namwon">
<text>Namwon (, ) is a city in North Jeolla Province, South Korea. Namwon is about 50 minutes from the provincial capital of Jeonju, which is almost three hours away from Seoul. The official city flower is Royal Azalea () while the city tree is the crape-myrtle () and the city bird is the swallow (). Namwon is a small city located just outside Jirisan National Park, which has the largest set of mountains on the South Korean Mainland. It also borders the Seomjin River, one of South Korea&#x27;s more prominent rivers. It is 3 hours and 15 minutes from the Seoul Central City Bus Terminal (via direct bus) and about one hour from both the U-Square Bus Terminal in Gwangju and the Jeonju Inter City Bus Terminal (depending on traffic). It is called &quot;the City of Love&quot; because of the famous Korean love story of Chunhyang. Gwanghanlu Garden is a shrine to this love story.

== History ==
Namwon was founded in 680 during the reign of King Sinmun of Silla Kingdom. Namwon county was founded on April 1, 1895. 
The city suffered during the Siege of Namwon in 1597 during the Imjin War.

During the siege that lasted from August 13 to 16 the only defenders against the Japanese army of 56,000 men were 3300 Korean and Chinese soldiers and 6000 women and children. In the end the Japanese found a way to enter the city and killed all the soldiers and civilians.

== Geography ==
Namwon is located in a basin bordered by the Sobaek Mountains to the east and the Buheung Mountain Ridges to the west with the Yocheon River flowing through the city. Namwon is bordered by the counties of Imsil and Sunchang to the west, Jangsu to the north, Hamyang and Hadong in South Gyeongsang Province to the east, and Gurye and Gokseong in South Jeolla Province to the south.

== Climate ==
Namwon has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dwa&quot;), but can be considered a borderline humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwa&quot;) using the isotherm. The average yearly temperature of Namwon is with the average temperature in January being and in August. Due to its location in a mountainous basin with a high rate of precipitation, the climate of Namwon varies greatly. Winds in Namwon are usually weak and blow north to west in the winter and south to west in the summer. However, temperatures can sometimes (briefly) drop below in January with wind chills making it feel as though it were below . These winds are part of a cold front that comes down from Siberia for a very brief time. Temperatures in July and August can often reach , with the humidity making it feel as though it were . The humidity over the Korean peninsula from June through September comes from south east Asia. Temperatures in spring (late April and through May) and fall (after September 25 and through October) are often in the mid 20s °C (73–80 °F) and with low humidity.
== Festivals ==

=== Chunhyang festivals ===
The Chunhyang festival, that commemorates the love, fidelity and integrity of Chunhyang, started when female Korean entertainers created a fund to have a ceremony to honour Chunhyang in 1931, at a time when Korea was colonized by Japan. The festival is known as a festival for love through which the city of Namwon and the cultural assets of Chunhyang are promoted to the global community.

The Chunhyang festival, one of the 10 most celebrated festivals in Korea, attracts not only Korean participants but has also become popular among foreigners. Miss Chunhyang Beauty Pageant and other events make the festival memorable and fun for visitors. 
The main bridge that crosses the river that runs through the middle of the city is lit up, and along the river bank there are vendors selling food and items of all kinds. The Chunhyang beauty contest can be entered by the most beautiful female residents, in Hanbok (traditional dress). Another event is the Chunhyang parade which runs through cordoned sections of the city along the river bank, and which comprises just about the entire complement of the city&#x27;s mid-grade schoolgirls (numbering probably in the low hundreds) who are dressed in full chogori and carry musical instruments of some type, and who march in a very long line. There are also other parades of men and anyone else who is not a young girl may dress up in traditional dress and join the procession. The festival lasts four days and fireworks are launched every night.

For the rest of the year when the festival is not on, there is a small theme park dedicated to Chunhyang (Namwon Tourist Complex) complete with hypothetical dwellings and surroundings that someone like Chunhyang would have had (a mock house and yard). There are other sights in the park unrelated to Chunhyang such as a fish pond where visitors are free to feed the fish and some old-fashioned swings and horseshoe-style throwing games. Outside the park, along the river bank, there are also mini paddle boats that people can rent to traverse the small river.

=== Baraebong Royal Azalea Festival ===
From the end of April to mid May, Mt.Jiri is filled with their vivid red and pink flowers. Tourists can see crimson red flowers from the peak of Barae Bong of 1,165m down to Pal Rang Chi. There is a botanical garden and a herb valley nearby Barae Bong.

=== Namwon Herb Festival ===
Namwon Herb Festival, holds at Jirisan Mt. Herb Valley every spring and autumn, showcases many herbs that grow around Jirisan Mt.

=== Heungbu Festival ===
Namwon is the setting of a Korean traditional novel named Heungbujeon (story of Heungbu), and this festival is one of the most popular local events. Heungbu Festival opens on September 9 every year in lunar calendar to celebrate the friendship and love of a man named heungbu. Since the first festival held in 1993, it has offered various events including Heungbu theater, farm music competitions and food tasting event made with gourds.

<text>Kaluga (, ) is a city and the administrative center of Kaluga Oblast, Russia. It stands on the Oka River southwest of Moscow. Its population was 337,058 at the 2021 census.

Kaluga&#x27;s most famous resident, the space travel pioneer Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, worked there as a school teacher from 1892 to 1935. The Tsiolkovsky State Museum of the History of Cosmonautics in Kaluga is dedicated to his theoretical achievements and to their practical implementations for modern space research, hence the motto on the city&#x27;s coat of arms: , &quot;Kolybélʹ kosmonávtiki&quot; (&quot;The Cradle of Space-Exploration&quot;).

== History ==
Kaluga, founded in the mid-14th century as a border fortress on the southwestern borders of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, first appears in the historical record in chronicles in the 14th century as &quot;Koluga&quot;; the name comes from Old Russian &quot;kaluga&quot; is &quot;bog, quagmire&quot;. During the period of Tartar raids it was the western end of the Oka bank defense line. The Great stand on the Ugra River was fought just to the west. In the Middle Ages Kaluga was a minor settlement owned by the Princes Vorotynsky. The ancestral home of these princes lies southwest of the modern city.

On 19 January 1777, the Kaluga drama theatre opened its first theatrical season, established with the direct participation of the Governor-General Mikhail Krechetnikov.

Kaluga is connected to Moscow by a railway line and by the ancient roadway, the Kaluga Road (now partly within Moscow (as the Old Kaluga Highway), partly the A101 road). This road offered Napoleon his favored escape route from the Moscow trap in the fall of 1812. But General Kutuzov repelled Napoleon&#x27;s advances in this direction and forced the retreating French army onto the old Smolensk road, previously devastated by the French during their invasion of Russia.

On several occasions during the Russian Empire Kaluga was the residence of political exiles and prisoners such as the last Crimean khan Şahin Giray (1786), the Kyrgyz sultan Arigazi-Abdul-Aziz (1828), the Georgian princess Thecla (1834–1835), and the Avar leader Imam Shamil (1859–1868).

The German army briefly occupied Kaluga during the climactic Battle of Moscow, as part of Operation Barbarossa. The city was under full or partial German occupation from October 12 to December 30, 1941. In 1944, the Soviet Government used its local military buildings to intern hundreds of Polish prisoners of war — soldiers of the Polish underground Home Army — whom the advancing Soviet front had arrested in the area around Vilnius.

== Demographics ==
As of the 2021 Census, the ethnic composition of Kaluga was:
== Administrative and municipal status ==
Kaluga is the administrative center of the oblast. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with seventy-two rural localities, incorporated as the City of Kaluga—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Kaluga, together with one rural locality in Ferzikovsky District (the &quot;selo&quot; of Novozhdamirovo), is incorporated as Kaluga Urban Okrug.

== Economy ==
The Kaluga Turbine Plant is located here as is Kaluga Machine Works, which manufactures track machines for railways. In recent years, Kaluga has become one center of the Russian automotive industry, with a number of foreign companies opening assembly plants in the area:

On 28 November 2007, Volkswagen Group opened a new assembly plant in Kaluga, which further expanded by 2009. The investment has reached more than 500 million Euro. the plant assembled the Volkswagen Passat, Škoda Fabia and Škoda Rapid.

On 15 October 2007, the Volvo Group broke ground on a new truck assembly plant, that was inaugurated on 19 January 2009, with a yearly capacity of 10,000 Volvo and 5,000 Renault trucks.

On 12 December 2007, PSA Peugeot Citroën announced its decision to build a new assembly plant in Kaluga.

== Transportation ==
The city is served by the Grabtsevo Airport. Since 1899, there has been a railway connection between Kaluga and Moscow.

Public transportation is represented by the trolleybuses, buses, and &quot;marshrutkas&quot; (routed taxis).
== Climate ==
Kaluga has a humid temperate continental (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dfb&quot;), with warm and humid summers; and long, cold and snowy winters. Winter extreme records can be as low as , while summer heat may reach up , but normal variation is between and during winter and between and during summer in Kaluga.

<text>Buan County (, &quot;Buan-gun&quot;) is a county in Jeonbuk State, South Korea. It is bounded by the city of Jeongeup on the east, the county of Gochang on the south, the city of Gimje on the north, and Yellow Sea on the west. Buan is divided into 1 &quot;eup&quot;, 12 &quot;myeon&quot;, and 510 &quot;ri&quot;. Buan had a 2001 estimated population of 74,716 people and a 2018 population of 54,441 people with an area of 493.35 km2. Famous people from Buan include Joseon Dynasty kisaeng and poet, Yi Mae-chang. Like many rural areas in southern Korea, it has seen shrinking population with many younger people moving north to larger cities such as Seoul. This county should not be confused with Muan, the new capital of South Jeolla Province.

==History==

===Proto–Three Kingdoms period===
During the Samhan Period Buan County was called Mahan, and it was also called Jiban statelets among the 54 Mahan statelets. 

===Three Kingdoms period===
During the Beakjae Period there were two small localities: Gaehwa and Heunlyangmae. In B.C 757(16th year of King Gyeongdeok&#x27;s regime), after Silla united the three kingdoms, Gyehwa was renamed as Buryeong (sometimes called Gyebal) and was a part of Gobu. Honliang was renamed as Hee-an and was also a part of Gobu.

===Goryeo===
During the Goryeo period, the county was called Boan-hyeon and was also nicknamed as Namju. In late Goryeo, during King U&#x27;s regime, there were local governors were posted to Buryeong-hyeon and Boan-hyeon.

===Joseon===
During the 14th and 16th year of king Taejong&#x27;s reign, the two localities Buryeong-hyeon and Boan-hyeon were merged and separated several times. Then in December 1416, the two localities were merged and was named Buan, the &quot;bu&quot; coming from Buryeong and the &quot;an&quot; coming from Boan. The following year a locality named Heungdeokjin was made a part of Buan and was renamed as Buanjin. A high-level civil servant named the Byeongmasa ruled over the county. In 1423 (5th year of King Sejong&#x27;s regime), the ruler was changed from Cheomjeoljesa to Hyeongam. Locality Buan was changed into Boan County in 1895 (32nd year of King Gojong&#x27;s regime), when several different terms representing localities (bu, mok, gun, and hyeon) were unified to a single therm - gun(county). In 1914, during the Japanese occupation, the administrative district was changed: Wido become a part of Yeonggwang County(South Jeolla Province), and Biando was annexed to Gunsan City. Baeksan, Geoma, and Deoklim of Gobu County were annexed to Buan County.

In 1943 Byreong-myeon was upgraded into Buan-eup.

===Today===
On January 1, 1963, According to changes in the administrative districts, Wido-myeon of Yeonggwang County (South Jeolla Province) was annexed to Buan County.

With the reclamation works of Gaehwado in 1978, the country&#x27;s territory was increased by 3,968ha. In 1983 Sannae-myeon and Jinseo-myeon were divided into Gawhwa-myeon and Jinso-myeon. Currently, the administrative district consists of 1 eup and 12 myeon. The total area is 493 km2 (farming land 42%, forest land 42%, other 16%). Buan county is located and longitude 126 degrees 40 minutes, latitude 35 degrees 40 minutes. It is located to the west of Jeonbuk State and its border meets with Gunsan City at the sea. To the north there is Gimje City, to the southeast there is Jeongeup City, and to the south there is Gochang County. The land is low in the east side and high on the west site. The peninsula sticks out on the Yellow Sea. To the southwest direction a mountain named Byeonsan stands in layers. To the northeast there are wide and rich fields. The coast line which runs from the mouth of the Dongjingang River to Julpo-myeon Upo-ri, is 66 km long. The influence of sea winds bring about a lot of snow in the winter.

==Climate==
== Administrative district ==
The administrative district of Buan-gun consists of 1 eup and 12 myeon. The area of Buan-gun is 493.35 km2, and the population is 48,066 people and 27,434 households as of resident registration at the end of December 2024. 38% of the county&#x27;s total residents live in Buan-eup. Rocks from the Precambrian period are distributed only to a small extent, granites form the plains of eastern Buan-gun, and Cretaceous volcanic rocks form the geology of the Byeonsan Peninsula area in western Buan-gun.

== Lipids ==
Buan-gun is located at the southwest end of the boundary between the Gyeonggi massif and the Okcheon fold belt. 

Its geology is composed of gneiss formed in the Precambrian period, granite intruded in the Jurassic period of the Mesozoic Era, and volcanic rocks from the Cretaceous period of the Mesozoic Era occupying the Byeonsan Peninsula area. In the Sinsongrim Village area of Jangsin-ri, the biotite gneiss shows a folded pattern. In this area, biotite gneiss is intruded by Jurassic porphyllite granite (Jpgr), biotite granite (Jbgr), and Cretaceous Baekryeon-ri rhyolite (Kbbr), and is in contact with the Cretaceous Jangsinri Formation (Kj) to the west of Jangsin-ri through a fault. Along the northern forest road of Seokbulsan Mountain between Jangsin-ri and Uibok-ri, Gyehwa-myeon, small-scale biotite gneiss is captured within a porphyritic granite body.

=== Precambrian ===
* Precambrian gneisses are distributed on a small scale in the following areas. Biotite gneiss (PPrbgn), formed in the Precambrian Paleozoic Era, is developed in the southeastern part of Jangsin-ri and Cheongho-ri, Haseo-myeon, Buan-gun, and is the oldest rock in the Buan region. As a result of analyzing zircons from other rocks that intruded into the same rock in the Iksan area, an age of about 1.8 billion years was found, and the geological age of this rock appears to be the Paleozoic Era.
* Fresh outcrops of Precambrian gneiss and schist are well exposed along the northern coast of Gyeokpo Port in Gyeokpo-ri, Byeonsan-myeon. Gneiss is a metamorphic process involving the injection of white granitic materials into orthogneiss, which is a metamorphic process of granite, and schist of heterogeneous, silty, and sandy elements. Sub-gneisses that have undergone migmatization and granitization are mixed. The main constituent minerals of gneiss vary in relative amount depending on the type of source rock, but are mostly composed of quartz, orthoclase, siltstone, plagioclase, biotite, and muscovite.
* In the eastern area of Nampo-ri and Udong-ri, Boan-myeon (the area between Mangwolbong and Gamtubong Peak), Paleozoic gneiss is distributed in small quantities. On the eastern side of the gneiss distribution area, the Cheonmasan tuff of Buan volcanic rock lies unconformably, and on the western part, fractured breccias are partially distributed, and the Seokpo tuff and Udongjae tuff are in direct contact with the gneiss through a fault relationship.

=== Paleozoic Ordovician ===
* In uninhabited island areas such as Large Island, Small Island, Imsu Island, and Saengdannyeo in Wido-myeon, Buan-gun, foliated tonalite (Oft) is distributed as an independent rock body, and access to the outcrop is very limited to directly observe the rock. The 206Pb/238U age for zircon is 451.6±4.7 Ma, indicating a formation period in the late Ordovician (Katian).

=== Mesozoic Jurassic granite ===
The granite that is widely distributed in the eastern part of Buan-gun, forming a plain area, is a part of the Daebo granite body that is widely distributed in the areas of Iksan, Gimje, Jeongeup, and Gochang in the Honam region. In general, granites intruded during the Mesozoic Era are distributed in the northwest area of Seokbulsan Mountain in Haseo-myeon, almost all areas of Dongjin-myeon, Haengan-myeon, Buan-eup, Baeksan-myeon, Jusan-myeon, and Julpo-myeon, and the eastern part of Boan-myeon.

==Transport==
Buan Bus Terminal provides direct services to Seoul, Daejeon and Gwangju, as well as services within Jeonbuk State to Jeonju, Gimje, Iksan, Gunsan, Jeongeup and Gochang. The nearest railway station is at Gimje on the Honam Line.

<text>Gochang County () is a county in Jeonbuk State, South Korea. It is a rural area, and is home to only one institution of higher education: Gochang Polytechnic College.

Notable people from Gochang include the 20th-century poet Midang. The temple of Seonunsa is also located in Gochang.

The Gochang Dolmens located in Maesan village are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site and Historic Site #391.

Gochang-gun has an average temperature of 14.3 degrees Celsius and precipitation of 1003.6 millimeters, which is a low rainfall area. The average high is 18.8 degrees and the average low is 8.01 degrees.

==History==
Gochang is the town with most dolmen sites in Korea. Some of the dolmens in Dosan-ri, Sanggap-ri and Maesan-ri are of the southern style, whereas most of those in the rest of North Jeolla-do Province are of the northern style. This proves that a wide scope of culture existed in the town in the prehistoric times.

Gochang is where Morobiri, one of the 54 small countries during the ancient Mahan period was located. The town was called Moryangburi-hyeon or Moryang-hyeon in the Baekje period, then renamed as Gochanghyun in the United Kingdom of Shilla.

Notable sites in the area include the Seonunsa or Seonun Temple and the Gochangeupseong Fortress. Seonunsa Temple is one of the leading Buddhist temples in North Jeolla-do Province. It is known for camellias and has a number of Buddhist treasures such as Daeungjeon or the main building and the statue of a Buddhist saint named Jijang.

Meanwhile, Gochangeupseong Fortress is the best-preserved fortress in the country. Built in the early days of the Joseon dynasty to protect the town against Japanese invaders, the fortress has carried on the tradition of stepping on the ground of the fortress. A town named Mujang in Seongnae-ri, Mujang-myeon, also has a fortress. The south gate and mud rampart of the Mujang Town Fortress are in their original form.

Part of Shin Jae Hyo&#x27;s house remains near a pavilion called Gongbungnu within the Gochang Fortress. Gochang has relics of Dongjae all over a town called Ogari Dangsan, Sadong, Gosu-myeon, which used to be a home for the production of ceramics from celadon porcelains of the Goryeo dynasty to white porcelains of the Chosun dynasty and throughout the Japanese colonial period. Sudong-ri, Buan-myeon has a bunching production site. This is a specific type of porcelain. This place has been designated as a historic site as well. Bongan-ri, Buan-myeon has Kim Seong Su&#x27;s house. The design is a typical house of wealthy families in the region.

==Festival==

Gochang Moyang Fortress Festival

Gochang-eup Fortress (Moyang Fortress) was built to prevent invasion from other countries in the first year of King Danjong&#x27;s reign during the Joseon dynasty (1453) with the cooperation of the people of 21 towns (hyeon) in then Jeolla-do and Jeju-do. This is the natural stone fortress whose prototype has been preserved the best condition in Korea.

Among many legends and customs related with the construction of Moyang Fortress, the most famous one is Dapseong folklore game. People walk along the 1,684m-long fortress with a palm-sized stone on head. It was based on our ancestor&#x27;s wisdom that walking around the fortress makes the ground stronger and can be used in emergency situations. It has been said that you can heal your leg illness for one round of walking around the fortress, live healthy and long for two rounds and go to the heaven for three rounds. Every year many people participate in the folklore game.

Green Barley Field Festival

The Green Barley Field Festival is held at Hagwon Farm in Gongeum-myeon, Gochang-gun from mid-April to mid-May every year.

The vast barley field has become widely known among photographers and travelers. The increasing number of tourists to the place requires the administration to be involved to keep order, address inconveniences and introduce the local culture. Such necessity made the local people and the Gochang-gun Office go into negotiation to host the festival since 2004.

It is the first barley-themed scenic agricultural festival on a low hill. The landscape created by the barley field attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors every year.

Visitors can have various experiences including walking in the barley field, making traditional food with barley, making barley flute and folk play such as walking on a rope, tuho and Korean jumping.

Visitors can taste barley-based boiled rice, rice cake, traditional snack and pepper paste and enjoy various cultural performances and traditional performances. During the festival, exhibitions including international scenic agricultural photo exhibition and international academic conventions on tourism and agriculture are held. And along with barley, special products of Gochang such as mountain berry are traded in the festival.

Mountain Berry and Watermelon Festival

Gochang hosts mountain berry and watermelon festival in mid June every year. During the festival period, visitors can get a special discount for mountain berry and watermelon. Visitors can taste various products such as mountain berry beverage and liquor, processed mountain berry foods such as traditional snack and jelly and watermelon salads. And they can enjoy various experience programs such as Korean chamber pot curling, mountain berry archery and watermelon shooting.

Also, the festival also includes Pungcheon Eel tasting which has a great match with mountain berry liquor and Pungcheon Eel catching.

<doc id="394616" wikidata="Q6887211" url="?curid=394616" title="Mobile phone spam">
<text>Mobile phone spam is a form of spam (unsolicited messages, especially advertising), directed at the text messaging or other communications services of mobile phones or smartphones. As the popularity of mobile phones surged in the early 2000s, frequent users of text messaging began to see an increase in the number of unsolicited (and generally unwanted) commercial advertisements being sent to their telephones through text messaging. This can be particularly annoying for the recipient because, unlike in email, some recipients may be charged a fee for every message received, including spam. Mobile phone spam is generally less pervasive than email spam, where in 2010 around 90% of email is spam. The amount of mobile spam varies widely from region to region. In North America, mobile spam steadily increased after 2008 and accounted for half of all mobile phone traffic by 2019. In parts of Asia up to 30% of messages were spam in 2012.

The lesser and geographically uneven prevalence of mobile phone spam is attributable to geographic variation of prevalence of mobile vs non-mobile electronic communications, the higher cost (to spammers) of and technological barriers to sending mobile messages in some areas, and to law enforcement in others. Today, particularly in North America, most mobile phone spam is sent from mobile devices that have prepaid unlimited messaging rate plans. While the rate plans allow for unlimited messaging, in reality the relatively slow sending rate (on the order of magnitude of 1/s) limits the number of messages that may be sent before an abusing mobile is shut down.

==Terminology==
Mobile phone spam is described as &quot;mobile spamming&quot;, &quot;SMS spam&quot;, &quot;text spam&quot;, &quot;m-spam&quot; or &quot;mspam&quot;. SMiShing involves tricking users into revealing confidential information and is a type of phishing through mobile phone spam.

== Criminality and law enforcement ==
SMS spam is illegal under common law in many jurisdictions as trespass to chattels. Jurisdictions with specific SMS spam regulation and fines include Australia, the EU, and the United States. In the US, violators face substantial costs. For example, in a 2008 settlement, the violator agreed to pay $150 to each spam recipient. In a 2010 class action settlement of Satterfield v. Simon &amp; Schuster, a case that reached the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, defendants agreed to pay $175 to each spam recipient. In subsequent cases, the payment per class member has increased to $200 in 2011 and $500 in 2013. In response to Satterfield, entities who make money sending mobile phone spam formed the Mobile Advocacy Coalition (MAC) to lobby the government to legalize that activity. In the US, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has expanded Phone Spam regulations to cover also Voice Spam—mostly in form of prerecorded telemarketing calls—commonly known as robocalls; victims can file a complaint with the FCC. In California, Section 17538.41 of the B&amp;P Code bans text message advertisement. Consumers can sue on an individual or class basis per a private right of action against unfair business practices. In 2019, senators John Thune, Roger Wicker and Ed Markey introduced a new proposal titled the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence Act (TRACED) to deter criminal robocall violations and improve enforcement which passed the Senate on May 22, 2019 and was signed into law by President Trump in December 2019.

===Enforcement in small claims court ===

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released an order in Aug, 2004 that reiterated that SMS spam messages to cellphones are illegal under the existing Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA). Each such unsolicited message received without permission entitles the recipient to take the sender to small claims court and collect a minimum of $1 for each violation. They said this in 2003, and reiterated it in 2004: &quot;In 2003, we released a Report and Order in which we reaffirmed that the TCPA prohibits any call using an automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded message to any wireless telephone number. We concluded that this encompasses both voice calls and text calls, including Short Message Service (SMS) text messaging calls, to wireless phone numbers.&quot;

The 2003 TCPA Order (18 FCC Rcd at 14115, para. 165) says: “Both the statute and our rules prohibit these calls, with limited exceptions, ‘to any telephone number assigned to a paging service, cellular telephone service, specialized mobile radio service, or other common carrier service, or any service for which the called party is charged.’ This encompasses both voice calls and text calls to wireless numbers including, for example, short message service (SMS) calls, provided the call is made to a telephone number assigned to such service.” (citations omitted).

In the UK, Sending unsolicited text messages is acting contrary to Schedule 2 of the Data Protection Act 1998 and section 22 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003. Section 13 of Data Protection Act 1998 and section 30 of Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 enable consumers to bring proceedings for compensation for spam emails or text messages.

==Legalization==
In 2013, Club Texting, Inc. petitioned the FCC for a Declaratory Ruling that Text Broadcasters Are Not Senders of Text Messages, and had a private meeting with five FCC staff members to argue their case. This would mean that text broadcasters would no longer be liable for mobile phone spam they conveyed.

==Factors complicating SMS spam reduction==
Fighting SMS spam is complicated by several factors, including the lower rate of SMS spam (compared to more abused services such as Internet email), which has allowed many users and service providers to ignore the issue, and the limited availability of mobile phone spam-filtering software. Filtering SMS spam at the recipient device would be an imperfect solution in markets where users are charged to receive messages, as the user may still be charged for the message once the provider sent it, even if software on the device blocked it from appearing on the device&#x27;s display. This problem is not present in most of the world outside the U.S., however, where users are not charged to receive messages.

Providers may fear liability should a legitimate message of an emergency nature be blocked. Nonetheless, many providers voluntarily provide their subscribers technical means for mitigating unsolicited SMS messages.

==Defense==
There are several actions and strategies that can help reduce SMS spam. Legal actions can be effective and remunerative. Many carriers (such as AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon and Sprint in the US; and EE, T-Mobile, Orange and O2 in the UK) allow subscribers to report spam by forwarding the spam messages to short code 7726 (spells SPAM on a traditional phone keypad) (33700 in France, 1909 in India), other UK carriers Vodafone and Three use 87726 and 37726 respectively. It is reported that 1/2 million spam reports in France resulted in the disconnection of 300 spammers, and many more cease-and-desist orders were sent. Some spam defense measures depend on detection, and there are two developments in that area: a GSMA pilot spam reporting program, and the development of Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) standards for mobile spam reporting. In February 2010, the GSM Association has announced a pilot program that will allow subscribers to report SMS spam by forwarding it to short code &#x27;7726&#x27; which spells &quot;SPAM&quot; on most phones. AT&amp;T Mobility, Korea Telecom, and SFR announced their participation. Following the pilot, a number of other mobile operators have joined the GSMA&#x27;s Spam Reporting Service program.

The Open Mobile Alliance completed its &quot;SpamRep&quot; standard which provides a standardized client-server interface suited for user reporting of mobile email, SMS, MMS and IM spam using a &#x27;This-Is-Spam&#x27; button or menu item, as users of wired email systems are now doing. In 2012, responding to the increase in SMS spam, the GSM Association formed a Messaging Security Group to help reduce the impact of mobile spam. Another helpful SMS spam-reduction technique is guarding one&#x27;s cell phone number. One of the biggest sources of SMS spam is number harvesting carried out by Internet sites offering &quot;free&quot; ring tone downloads. In order to facilitate the downloads, users must provide their phones&#x27; numbers; which in turn are used to send frequent advertising messages to the phone. Wording in the sites&#x27; Terms of Service intended to make this legal have not survived court challenge.

Another approach to reducing SMS spam that is offered by some carriers involves creating an alias address rather than using the cell phone&#x27;s number as a text message address. Only messages sent to the alias are delivered; messages sent to the phone&#x27;s number are discarded. A New York Times article provided detailed information on this in 2008. Another countermeasure is to use a service that provides a public phone number and publishes the SMS messages received at that number to a publicly accessible website. Google Voice can be used in this way, but with numbers and messages kept private. most cell phone providers offer the option of completely disabling &quot;all&quot; text messaging services on a user&#x27;s account. This extreme solution, however, is satisfactory only for those users who have neither the need nor the desire to utilize SMS at all.

In June 2009, three major Chinese carriers—China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom—imposed limits on text messaging in order to crack down on spam SMS. Under the restrictions, a phone number can send no more than 200 messages per hour and 1000/day on weekdays. In the United States, recipients of SMS spam can file a complaint with the FCC. Phone users in the United Kingdom can use the Information Commissioner&#x27;s complaints page and can take action against the sender through the small claims court. The ICO however only have powers to act against SMS spam originating in the UK, and in the event Spam originates outside their jurisdiction they will forward details to an equivalent local regulator if one exists.

==Pro-active campaigns==

In October 2014, a network of solicitors in the UK called PIE (Personal Injury Expert) Lawyers launched a campaign on social media to rid their industry of text message spam. Their feeling was that the use of unsolicited sms marketing was adding further damage to their industry&#x27;s already poor reputation. The campaign focused on the fact that, under UK law, it is illegal for a solicitor to obtain business by unsolicited direct contact with potential personal injury clients. This is the case even in the event that it is not the solicitor who makes the unsolicited approach. The campaign actively encouraged people to respond to the spam text messages. Upon receipt of an offer of legal representation from a solicitor, the person would then report the solicitor to the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) which would then take appropriate action. Ultimately any solicitor found to be guilty on repeated occasions of obtaining customers by unsolicited approaches could have their practicing certificates revoked thereby ending their career as a solicitor.

<text>Imsil County () is a county in North Jeolla Province, South Korea. Imsil County is a county in central South Jeolla Province, South Korea. It is an area upstream of the Seomjingang River in the Noryeongsan Mountains, and there is a basin that runs southeast to Namwon. The county office is located in Imsil-eup, and the administrative district is 11 myeon, 1eup.

It is approximately 30 minutes south of Jeonju by car or bus. Domestic Korean cheese was first produced in Imsil County. Imsil County encompasses several important towns, mountains and natural areas.

Imsil-gun has 14 elementary schools and an English center.

==History==
===Proto–Three Kingdoms period===

Imsil belonged to the Mahan State, as New Wunsin State.

===Three Kingdoms period===

The County was Inghil-gun in Baekje.

===Unified Silla Period===

Imsil-gun belonged to Namwon-bu. Ingil-gun was renamed Imsil-gun in 759. The stone pagoda at Imsil Jingusaji Temple Site was also built during the Unified Silla period.

===Today===
The building was relocated in 2010.

==Tourism==
===Imsil Cheese Village===
Imsil Cheese Village () is located near the town of Imsil (within the county of Imsil). It offers vacation programs for children and tourists to learn how to make cheese.

The cheese produced there is called Imsil cheese, following the county name. Imsil cheese is the unusual mission legacy of a Catholic priest from Belgium who took the Korean name of Ji Junghwan. He arrived in the farming village of Imsil, in the mid-1950s, when the economy was still shattered from the Korean War. He started a farmers’ milk cooperative, which eventually became the Imsil Cheese Factory. The factory still exists today and produces high-quality cheese and yogurt for the Korean market.

A pizza franchise using Imsil cheese has become a widespread business in South Korea since 2004, under the name of Imsil Cheese Pizza. Nearby livestock farms produce the dairy products required for the manufacture of the cheese.

===Okjeongho Lake===

Okjeongho Lake () is an artificial lake created by the construction of the Seomjingang River Dam. There is a walking trail by the lake. In the upper reaches of the Seomjingang River, Okjeongho Lake has a large temperature difference between night and day, so fog rises.

==Education==
Yewon Arts University is located in Imsil.

==Climate==
==Twin towns – sister cities==
Imsil is twinned with:

* Gangseo-gu, South Korea
* Eunpyeong-gu, South Korea
* Busanjin-gu, South Korea

<doc id="394625" wikidata="Q1197400" url="?curid=394625" title="Crouton">
<text>A crouton () is a piece of toasted or fried bread, normally cubed and seasoned. Croutons are used to add texture and flavor to salads—notably the Caesar salad— as an accompaniment to soups and stews, or eaten as a snack food.

==Etymology==

The word crouton is derived from the French &quot;croûton&quot;, itself a diminutive of &quot;croûte&quot;, meaning &quot;crust&quot;. &quot;Croutons&quot; are often seen in the shape of small cubes, but they can be of any size and shape, up to a very large slice. Many people now use crouton for croute, so the usage has changed. Historically, however, a croute was a slice of a baguette lightly brushed with oil or clarified butter and baked. In English descriptions of French cooking, &quot;croûte&quot; is not only a noun but also has a verb form that describes the cooking process that transforms the bread into the crust.

==Preparation==
The preparation of croutons is relatively simple. Typically the cubes of bread are lightly coated in oil or butter (which may be seasoned or flavored for variety) and then baked. Croutons can also be cut into sticks. Some commercial preparations use machinery to sprinkle various seasonings on them. Alternatively, they may be fried lightly in butter or vegetable oil, until crisp and brown, to give them a buttery flavor and crunchy texture. Some croutons are prepared with the addition of cheese.

Nearly any type of bread—in a loaf or pre-sliced, with or without crust—may be used to make croutons. Dry or stale bread or leftover bread is usually used instead of fresh bread. Once prepared, the croutons will remain fresh far longer than unprepared bread.

==List of possible ingredients==
* bread
* garlic
* butter or oil (e.g., olive oil or rapeseed oil)
* Parmesan
* herbs
* spices (ground or whole)

==Gastronomy==
A dish prepared &quot;à la Grenobloise&quot; (in the Grenoble manner) has a garnish of small croutons along with beurre noisette, capers, parsley, and lemon.

Dried and cubed bread is commonly sold in large bags in North America to make Thanksgiving holiday stuffing or dressing. However, these are generally different from salad croutons, being only dry bread instead of buttered or oiled and with other seasonings.

<doc id="394633" wikidata="Q202930" url="?curid=394633" title="Reggaeton">
<text>Reggaeton (, ) is a modern style of popular and electronic music that originated in Panama during the late 1980s, and which rose to prominence in the late 1990s and early 2000s through a plethora of Puerto Rican musicians. It has evolved from dancehall, with elements of hip hop, Latin American, and Caribbean music. Vocals include toasting/rapping and singing, typically in Spanish.

Reggaetón, today, is regarded as one of the most popular music genres worldwide; it is the top music genre among the Spanish-speaking Caribbean nations and one of the primary modern genres within the Spanish-language music industry. Seemingly endless artists from the Caribbean have risen to fame (Puerto Rico, Panama, Dominican Republic, Cuba, Colombia). Argentina has seen a modern surge in young artists inspired by the reggaetón style, fusing their music with Spanish rap verses, trapetón and R&amp;B-style vocals (such as the &quot;Los Del Espacio&quot;, including LIT killah, Tiago PZK, Duki, Emilia, and María Becerra, as well as Argentine pop star Tini).

Several established, world-famous performers—notably Puerto Rican-American Jennifer Lopez and Shakira from Colombia—have embraced the style, recording numerous duets and collaborations with top &quot;reggaetoneros&quot;. Several other emerging international artists are seeing success in the genre as well, including Catalán-Spanish singer Bad Gyal (from Barcelona) and trilingual Brazilian star Anitta (from Rio de Janeiro). Mexican-American singer Becky G (from Los Angeles, California) has experienced huge success in recent years, as a Latino American artist in the reggaetón genre. In 2004, Daddy Yankee released his smash single “Gasolina”, regarded by many as the first globally-successful reggaetón song; Daddy Yankee is credited with bringing the style to western pop music listeners. By the 2010s, the genre had seen increased popularity across Latin America, as well as modern acceptance within mainstream Western music; during the 2010s, several new award categories (focusing on reggaetón and Latin music) were unveiled at various American music awards shows, notably the English-language American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, Grammy Awards, and MTV Video Music Awards.

== Etymology ==
There are several versions about the origin of the word reggaeton. El General&#x27;s representative Michael Ellis is said to have originated the term, adding the -ton suffix to &quot;make the word big.&quot; One of them states that the word reggaeton emerged in 1994 when Daddy Yankee mentioned it for the first time while &quot;freestyling&quot; on the mixtape &quot;Playero 34.&quot; Another version suggests that it appeared the following year when DJ Erick released the album titled &quot;Reggaetón Live Vol.1,&quot; abbreviating the words reggae and maratón (marathon). 

The spellings &quot;reggaeton&quot; and &quot;reggaetón&quot; are common, although prescriptivist sources such as the Fundéu BBVA and the &quot;Academia Puertorriqueña de la Lengua Española&quot; recommend the spelling &quot;reguetón&quot;, as it conforms more closely with traditional Spanish spelling rules.

== History ==
=== 1980s–2000s: Emergence ===
Often mistaken for reggae or , reggaeton is a younger genre that originated in the late 1980s in Panama and was later popularized in Puerto Rico. It had its origins in what was known as &quot;underground rap&quot; music, due to its circulation through informal networks and performances at unofficial venues. DJ Playero and DJ Nelson were inspired by hip hop and dancehall to produce &quot;riddims&quot;, the first reggaeton tracks. As Caribbean and African-American music gained momentum in Puerto Rico, reggae rap in Spanish marked the beginning of the Boricua underground and was a creative outlet for many young people. This created an inconspicuous-yet-prominent underground youth culture which sought to express itself. As a youth culture existing on the fringes of society and the law, it has often been criticized. The Puerto Rican police launched a campaign against underground music by confiscating cassette tapes from music stores under penal obscenity codes, levying fines and demonizing rappers in the media. Bootleg recordings and word of mouth became the primary means of distribution for this music until 1998, when it coalesced into modern reggaeton. The genre&#x27;s popularity increased when it was discovered by international audiences during the early 2000s.

The new genre, simply called &quot;underground&quot; and later &quot;&quot;, had explicit lyrics about drugs, violence, poverty, friendship, love and sex. These themes, depicting the troubles of inner-city life, can still be found in reggaeton. &quot;Underground&quot; music was recorded in (or carports) and at public housing complexes such as Villa Kennedy, and Jurutungo, often by creators using second-hand recording equipment. Despite that, the quality of the cassettes was good enough to help increase their popularity among Puerto Rican youth. The cassettes were sold or distributed on the streets from the trunks of cars. The availability and quality of the cassettes led to reggaeton&#x27;s popularity, which crossed socioeconomic barriers in the Puerto Rican music scene. The most popular cassettes in the early 1990s were DJ Negro&#x27;s &quot;The Noise I&quot; and &quot;II&quot; and DJ Playero&#x27;s 37 and 38. Gerardo Cruet, who created the recordings, spread the genre from the marginalized residential areas into other sectors of society, particularly private schools.

By the mid-1990s, &quot;underground&quot; cassettes were being sold in music stores. The genre caught on with middle-class youth, then found its way into the media. By this time, Puerto Rico had several clubs dedicated to the underground scene; Club Rappers in Carolina and PlayMakers in Puerto Nuevo were the most notable. Bobby &quot;Digital&quot; Dixon&#x27;s &quot;Dem Bow&quot; production was played in clubs. Underground music was not originally intended to be club music. In South Florida, DJ Laz and Hugo Diaz of the Diaz Brothers were popularizing the genre from Palm Beach to Miami.

Underground music in Puerto Rico was harshly criticized. In February 1995, there was a government-sponsored campaign against underground music and its cultural influence. Puerto Rican police raided six record stores in San Juan, hundreds of cassettes were confiscated and fines imposed in accordance with Laws 112 and 117 against obscenity. The Department of Education banned baggy clothing and underground music from schools. For months after the raids local media demonized rappers, calling them &quot;irresponsible corrupters of the public order.&quot;

In 1995, DJ Negro released &quot;The Noise 3&quot; with a mockup label reading, &quot;Non-explicit lyrics&quot;. The album had no cursing until the last song. It was a hit, and underground music continued to seep into the mainstream. Senator Velda González of the Popular Democratic Party and the media continued to view the movement as a social nuisance.

During the mid-1990s, the Puerto Rican police and National Guard confiscated reggaeton tapes and CDs to get &quot;obscene&quot; lyrics out of the hands of consumers. Schools banned hip hop clothing and music to quell reggaeton&#x27;s influence. In 2002, Senator González led public hearings to regulate the sexual &quot;slackness&quot; of reggaeton lyrics. Although the effort did not seem to negatively affect public opinion about reggaeton, it reflected the unease of the government and the upper social classes with what the music represented. Because of its often sexually-charged content and its roots in poor, urban communities, many middle- and upper-class Puerto Ricans found reggaeton threatening, &quot;immoral, as well as artistically deficient, a threat to the social order, apolitical&quot;.

Despite the controversy, reggaeton slowly gained acceptance as part of Puerto Rican culture — helped, in part, by politicians including González who began to use reggaeton in election campaigns to appeal to younger voters in 2003. Puerto Rican mainstream acceptance of reggaeton has grown and the genre has become part of popular culture, including a 2006 Pepsi commercial with Daddy Yankee and PepsiCo&#x27;s choice of Ivy Queen as musical spokesperson for Mountain Dew. Other examples of greater acceptance in Puerto Rico are religiously- and educationally-influenced lyrics; &quot;Reggae School&quot; is a rap album produced to teach math skills to children, similar to &quot;School House Rock&quot;. Reggaeton expanded when other producers, such as DJ Nelson and DJ Eric, followed DJ Playero. During the 1990s, Ivy Queen&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;En Mi Imperio&quot;, DJ Playero&#x27;s &quot;Playero 37&quot; (introducing Daddy Yankee) and &quot;The Noise: Underground&quot;, &quot;The Noise 5&quot; and &quot;The Noise 6&quot; were popular in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. Don Chezina, Tempo, Eddie Dee, Baby Rasta &amp; Gringo and Lito &amp; Polaco were also popular.

The name &quot;reggaeton&quot; became prominent during the early 2000s, characterized by the dembow beat. It was coined in Puerto Rico to describe a unique fusion of Puerto Rican music. Reggaeton is currently popular throughout Latin America. It increased in popularity with Latino youth in the United States when DJ Joe and DJ Blass worked with Plan B and Sir Speedy on &quot;Reggaeton Sex&quot;, &quot;Sandunguero&quot; and &quot;Fatal Fantasy&quot;.

=== 2004: Crossover ===
In 2004, reggaeton became popular throughout the United States and Europe. Tego Calderón was receiving airplay in the U.S., and the music was popular among youth. Daddy Yankee&#x27;s &quot;El Cangri.com&quot; became popular that year in the country, as did Héctor &amp; Tito. Luny Tunes and Noriega&#x27;s &quot;Mas Flow&quot;, Yaga &amp; Mackie&#x27;s &quot;Sonando Diferente&quot;, Tego Calderón&#x27;s &quot;El Abayarde&quot;, Ivy Queen&#x27;s &quot;Diva&quot;, Zion &amp; Lennox&#x27;s &quot;Motivando a la Yal&quot; and the &quot;Desafío&quot; compilation were also well received. Rapper N.O.R.E. released a hit single, &quot;Oye Mi Canto&quot;. Daddy Yankee released &quot;Barrio Fino&quot; and a hit single, &quot;Gasolina&quot;, opening the door for reggaeton globally. Tego Calderón recorded the singles &quot;Pa&#x27; Que Retozen&quot; and &quot;Guasa Guasa&quot;. Don Omar was popular, particularly in Europe, with &quot;Pobre Diabla&quot; and &quot;Dale Don Dale&quot;. Other popular reggaeton artists include Tony Dize, Angel &amp; Khriz, Nina Sky, Dyland &amp; Lenny, RKM &amp; Ken-Y, Julio Voltio, Calle 13, Héctor el Father, Wisin &amp; Yandel and Tito El Bambino. In late 2004 and early 2005, inspired by the success of &quot;Gasolina&quot;, Shakira collaborated with Alejandro Sanz to record &quot;La Tortura&quot; and &quot;La Tortura – Shaketon Remix&quot; for her album, &quot;Fijación Oral Vol. 1&quot;, further popularizing reggaeton. Four reggaeton songs were sung at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards: by Don Omar (&quot;Dile&quot;), Tego Calderón, Daddy Yankee, and Shakira with Sanz – the first time any reggaeton song was performed on that stage.

Musicians began to incorporate bachata into reggaeton, with Ivy Queen releasing singles (&quot;Te He Querido, Te He Llorado&quot; and &quot;La Mala&quot;) featuring bachata&#x27;s signature guitar sound, slower, romantic rhythms and emotive singing style. Daddy Yankee&#x27;s &quot;Lo Que Paso, Paso&quot; and Don Omar&#x27;s &quot;Dile&quot; are also bachata-influenced. In 2005 producers began to remix existing reggaeton music with bachata, marketing it as &quot;bachaton&quot;: &quot;bachata, Puerto Rican style&quot;.

=== 2006–2017: Topping the charts ===
In May 2006, Don Omar&#x27;s &quot;King of Kings&quot; was the highest-ranking reggaeton LP to date on the U.S. charts, debuting atop the Top Latin Albums chart and peaking at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Omar&#x27;s single, &quot;Angelito&quot;, topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Rhythm Radio Chart. He broke Britney Spears&#x27; in-store-appearance sales record at Downtown Disney&#x27;s Virgin music store.

That same year, Shakira&#x27;s &quot;Hips Don&#x27;t Lie&quot;, featuring Wyclef Jean of the Fugees, became &quot;the most popular song in the genre&#x27;s history&quot;, with &quot;the dembow beat in the background, the trumpet sample of Jerry Rivera&#x27;s &quot;Amores como el nuestro&quot; in the chorus, the obvious salsa influence.&quot;

In June 2007, Daddy Yankee&#x27;s &quot;El Cartel III: The Big Boss&quot; set a first-week sales record for a reggaeton album, with 88,000 copies sold. It topped the Top Latin Albums and Top Rap Albums charts, the first reggaeton album to do so on the latter. The album peaked at number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the second-highest reggaeton album on the mainstream chart.

The third-highest-ranking reggaeton album was Wisin &amp; Yandel&#x27;s &quot;Wisin vs. Yandel: Los Extraterrestres&quot;, which debuted at number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number one on the Top Latin Albums chart later in 2007. In 2008 Daddy Yankee soundtrack to his film, &quot;Talento de Barrio&quot;, debuted at number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. It peaked at number one on the Top Latin Albums chart, number three on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Top Soundtracks and number six on the Top Rap Albums chart. In 2009, Wisin &amp; Yandel&#x27;s &quot;La Revolución&quot; debuted at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, number one on the Top Latin Albums and number three on the Top Rap Albums charts.

By 2008, Reggaeton was the &quot;biggest-selling genre of Latin music&quot; and one of its artists, Tego Calderon, was using it to describe and encourage black pride.

=== Since 2017: &quot;Despacito&quot; effect ===
In 2017, the music video for &quot;Despacito&quot; by Luis Fonsi featuring Daddy Yankee reached one billion views in less than three months. From January 2018 to November 2020, the music video was the most viewed YouTube video of all-time. With its 3.3 million certified sales plus track-equivalent streams, &quot;Despacito&quot; became one of the best-selling Latin singles in the United States. The success of the song and its remix version led Daddy Yankee to become the most listened-to artist worldwide on the streaming service Spotify on 9 July 2017, being the first Latin artist to do so. He later became the fifth most listened-to male artist and the sixth overall of 2017 on Spotify. In June 2017, &quot;Despacito&quot; was cited by &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Leila Cobo as the song that renewed interest in the Latin music market from recording labels in the United States. Julyssa Lopez of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated that the successes of &quot;Despacito&quot; and J Balvin&#x27;s &quot;Mi Gente&quot; is &quot;the beginning of a new Latin crossover era.&quot; Stephanie Ho of Genius website wrote that &quot;the successes of &#x27;Despacito&#x27; and &#x27;Mi Gente&#x27; could point to the beginning of a successful wave for Spanish-language music in the US.&quot; Ho also stated that &quot;as &#x27;Despacito&#x27; proves, fans don&#x27;t need to understand the language in order to enjoy the music&quot;, referring to the worldwide success of the song, including various non-Spanish-speaking countries.

==== &quot;Te Boté&quot; and the minimalist dembow ====
In April 2018, &quot;Te Boté&quot; was released by Nio Garcia, Casper Magico, Darell, Ozuna, Bad Bunny and Nicky Jam. It reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Songs chart. It currently has over 1.8 billion views on YouTube. Many artists began to mark strong commercial trends in a market dominated by mixing Latin trap and reggaeton followed by a new minimalist dembow rhythm. For example, songs such as &quot;Adictiva&quot; by Daddy Yankee and Anuel AA, &quot;Asesina&quot; by Brytiago and Darell, &quot;Cuando Te Besé&quot; by Becky G and Paulo Londra, &quot;No Te Veo&quot; by Casper Magico and many other songs have been made in this style.
== Characteristics ==

=== Rhythm ===
The dembow riddim was created by Jamaican dancehall producers during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Dembow consists of a kick drum, kickdown drum, palito, snare drum, timbal, timballroll and (sometimes) a high-hat cymbal. Dembow&#x27;s percussion pattern was influenced by dancehall and other West Indian music (soca, calypso and cadence); this gives dembow a pan-Caribbean flavor. Steely &amp; Clevie, creators of the Poco Man Jam riddim, are usually credited with the creation of dembow. At its heart is the 3+3+2 (tresillo) rhythm, complemented by a bass drum in 4/4 time.
The riddim was first highlighted by Shabba Ranks in &quot;Dem Bow&quot;, from his 1991 album &quot;Just Reality&quot;. To this day, elements of the song&#x27;s accompaniment track are found in over 80% of all reggaeton productions. During the mid-1980s, dancehall music was revolutionized by the electronic keyboard and drum machine; subsequently, many dancehall producers used them to create different dancehall riddims. Dembow&#x27;s role in reggaeton is a basic building block, a skeletal sketch in percussion.

In Reggaeton &#x27;dembow&#x27; also incorporates identical Jamaican riddims such as Bam Bam, Hot This Year, Poco Man Jam, Fever Pitch, Red Alert, Trailer Reloaded and Big Up riddims, and several samples are often used. Some reggaeton hits incorporate a lighter, electrified version of the riddim. Examples are &quot;Pa&#x27; Que la Pases Bien&quot; and &quot;&quot;, which uses the Liquid riddim.

Since 2018 a new variation of the Dembow rhythm has emerged; Starting with Te Bote, a sharper minimalist Dembow has become a stable of Reggaeton production which has allowed for more syncopated rhythmic experiments.
=== Lyrics and themes ===
Reggaeton lyrical structure resembles that of hip hop. Although most reggaeton artists recite their lyrics rapping rather than singing, many alternate rapping and singing. Reggaeton uses traditional verse-chorus-bridge hip hop structure. Like hip hop, reggaeton songs have a hook which is repeated throughout the song. Latino ethnic identity is a common musical, lyrical and visual theme.

Unlike hip-hop CDs, reggaeton discs generally do not have parental advisories. An exception is Daddy Yankee&#x27;s &quot;Barrio Fino en Directo&quot; (&quot;Barrio Fino Live&quot;), whose live material (and with Snoop Dogg in &quot;Gangsta Zone&quot;) were labeled explicit. Snoop Dogg and Daddy Yankee filmed the video for &quot;Gangsta Zone&quot; in Torres Sabana housing projects in Carolina, Puerto Rico on January 27, 2006. Shot in grayscale, Daddy Yankee said the video depicts &quot;the real way we live on the island&quot;.

Artists such as Alexis &amp; Fido circumvent radio and television censorship by sexual innuendo and lyrics with double meanings. Some songs have raised concerns about their depiction of women. Although reggaeton began as a mostly-male genre, the number of women artists has been a slowly increasing and include the &quot;Queen of Reggaeton&quot;, Ivy Queen, Mey Vidal, K-Narias, Adassa, La Sista and Glory.

== Dance ==
&quot;Sandungueo&quot;, or &quot;perreo&quot;, is a dance associated with reggaeton which emerged during the early 1990s in Puerto Rico. It focuses on grinding, with one partner facing the back of the other (usually male behind female). Another way of describing this dance is &quot;back-to-front&quot;, where the woman presses her rear into the pelvis of her partner to create sexual stimulation. Since traditional couple dancing is face-to-face (such as square dancing and the waltz), reggaeton dancing initially shocked observers with its sensuality but was featured in several music videos. It is also known as daggering, grinding or juking in the English-speaking areas of the U.S.

== Popularity ==
=== Latin America ===
Over the past decade, reggaeton has received mainstream recognition in the Spanish-speaking Caribbean, where the genre originated from, including Puerto Rico, Cuba, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Colombia and Venezuela, where it is now regarded as one of the most popular music genres. Reggaeton has also seen increased popularity in the wider Latin America region, including in Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Ecuador and Peru.

In Cuba, reggaeton came to incorporate elements of traditional Cuban music, leading to the hybrid Cubaton. Two bands credited with popularizing Cubaton are Máxima Alerta (founded in 1999) and Cubanito 20.02. The former is notable for fusing Cubaton with other genres, such as son Cubano, conga, cumbia, salsa, merengue, and Cuban rumba, as well as styles and forms such as rap and ballads, whereas the latter&#x27;s music is influenced more by Jamaican music. The government of Cuba imposed restrictions on reggaeton in public places in 2012. In March 2019, the government went a step further; they banned the &quot;aggressive, sexually explicit and obscene messages of reggaeton&quot; from radio and television, as well as performances by street musicians.

The first name of reggaeton in Brazil was the Señores Cafetões group, who became known in 2007 with the track &quot;Piriguete&quot; - which at the time was mistaken by Brazilians for hip hop and Brazilian funk because reggaeton was still a genre almost unknown in the country. In Brazil, this musical genre only reached a reasonable popularity around the middle of the decade of 2010. The first great success of the genre in the country was the song &quot;Yes or no&quot; by Anitta with Maluma. One of the explanations for reggaeton has not reached the same level of popularity that exists in other Latin American countries is due to the fact that Brazil is a Portuguese-speaking country, which has historically led it to become more isolationist than other Latin American countries in the musical scene. The musical rhythm only became popular in the country when it reached other markets, like the American. The genre is now overcoming the obstacle of language. Some of the biggest names in the Brazilian music market have partnered with artists from other Latin American countries and explored the rhythm.

=== United States ===
The New York–based rapper N.O.R.E., also known as Noreaga, produced Nina Sky&#x27;s 2004 hit &quot;Oye Mi Canto&quot;, which featured Tego Calderón and Daddy Yankee, and reggaeton became popular in the U.S. Daddy Yankee then caught the attention of many hip-hop artists with his song &quot;Gasolina&quot;, and that year XM Radio introduced its reggaeton channel, Fuego (XM). Although XM Radio removed the channel in December 2007 from home and car receivers, it can still be streamed from the XM Satellite Radio website. Reggaeton is the foundation of a Latin-American commercial-radio term, hurban, a combination of &quot;Hispanic&quot; and &quot;urban&quot; used to evoke the musical influences of hip hop and Latin American music. Reggaeton, which evolved from dancehall and reggae, and with influences from hip hop has helped Latin-Americans contribute to urban American culture and keep many aspects of their Hispanic heritage. The music relates to American socioeconomic issues, including gender and race, in common with hip hop.

=== Europe ===
As in Latin America, reggaeton is a fairly widespread genre within Spain. For years it has topped the list as the most listened to musical genre in the Iberian country. Reggaeton arrived in Spain due to the large immigration flows of the 2000s and today it is a genre that is quite integrated into Spanish society, which also has its own exponents of the genre such as Enrique Iglesias, Rosalía, Ana Mena, Lola Índigo and Juan Magán.
In the rest of Europe, Reggaeton is less popular in Europe than in Latin America, however it attracts Latin American immigrants. A Spanish media custom, &quot;La Canción del Verano&quot; (&quot;The Song of the Summer&quot;), in which one or two songs define the season&#x27;s mood, was the basis of the popularity of reggaeton songs such as &quot;Baila Morena&quot; by Héctor &amp; Tito and Daddy Yankee&#x27;s &quot;Gasolina&quot; in 2005.

=== Asia ===
In the Philippines, reggaeton artists primarily use the Filipino language instead of Spanish or English. One example of a popular local reggaeton act is Zamboangueño duo Dos Fuertes, who had a dance hit in 2007 with &quot;Tarat Tat&quot;, and who primarily uses the Chavacano language in their songs.

In 2020, Malaysian rapper Namewee released the single and music video &quot;China Reggaeton&quot; featuring Anthony Wong. It is the first time reggaeton was sung in the Chinese languages of Mandarin and Hakka and accompanied by traditional Chinese instruments like the erhu, pipa and guzheng, creating a fusion of reggaeton and traditional Chinese musical styles.

== LGBTQ influence ==
Reggaeton has traditionally been male dominated and heteronormative, known to &quot;reinforce the most unpleasant aspects of machismo&quot;. The genre began to accept queer and trans artists into the mainstream after Bad Bunny publicly voiced his allyship to the queer community through challenging gender norms and homophobic notions. New generation artists like Villano Antillano, Young Miko, La Cruz and others have been challenging the stereotypes and values traditionally associated with the genre.

In 2022 Villano Antillano, a trans-femme rap/reggaeton artist from Puerto Rico, broke the record as &quot;the first transwoman to hit number 50 on Spotify&quot; with Villano Antillano: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 51 in collaboration with producer Bizarrap. She began her music career as a male-presenting person under the artist name &quot;Villano Antillano&quot; and later decided to &quot;step into [her] femininity&quot; and transition. She has since kept her original artist name, but identifies as non-binary and is referred to as her legal name &quot;Villana&quot;. Villana has spoken on her experience confronting the barriers for queer and trans people in the reggaeton and urban industry; she says, &quot;all of these cis male artists, who are very close, aren&#x27;t going to collaborate with a trans woman. There are very few. We can count them on one hand.&quot;

In 2023 Young Miko, a queer trap and reggaeton artist from Puerto Rico, charted in the Billboard Hot 100 with her single &quot;Classy 101&quot;. In the same year, she was featured on Spanish rapper Bad Gyal&#x27;s &quot;Chulo Pt2&quot;, along with Tokischa, a queer Dembow singer; as of October 2023, the song has over 100 million views on YouTube. In the start of her career, Young Miko grew a local following in Puerto Rico releasing music independently on SoundCloud, but gained national visibility after Bad Bunny invited her on stage during his Un Verano Sin Ti tour.

In June 2023, reggaeton artist, La Cruz, from Venezuela released a music video for his single &quot;TE CONOCI BAILANDO&quot;, which featured several homoerotic images including several shirtless men, locker room interactions and guys twerking in front of urinals. He challenged what is expected from traditional reggaeton music visuals by having gay men be the object of desire rather than women. The music video has amounted 2 million views on YouTube as of October 2023.

== Criticism ==
Despite the popularity of the genre, reggaeton has also attracted criticism due to its constant references to sexual and violent themes, similar to those of hip-hop. Mexican singer-songwriter Aleks Syntek made a public post on social media complaining that such music was played at Mexico City&#x27;s airport in the morning with children present. By 2019, other singers who expressed dismay over the genre included vallenato singer Carlos Vives and Heroes Del Silencio singer Enrique Bunbury. That same year, some activists stated that reggaeton music gives way to misogynistic and sadistic messages.

Some reggaeton singers have decided to counteract such accusations. One notable example is singer Flex, who in 2009 committed himself to singing songs with romance messages, a subgenre he dubbed &quot;romantic style&quot;.

<text>Jinan County (&quot;Jinan-gun&quot;) is a county in Jeonbuk State, South Korea.

==Introduce==
Famous as the &quot;sacred peak&quot; or the &quot;center-piece&quot; of the southwestern provinces, the mysterious Maisan Mountain forms the watershed of the Geumgang River and Seomjingang River in Jinan-gun, where kind-hearted people thrive on the nation&#x27;s granary land.
The high-altitude land is well suited to the cultivation of Jinan&#x27;s special products: ginseng, deodeok(lanceolate) root, shiitake mushrooms, black pigs, and delicious top-grade hot peppers.

==Jinan 8 Scenic Beauties==
Mai Mountain 
The 100 million year old mystery is pleasing to the senses. Mai Mountain! was easily overlooked with the simple story that the mountain looks like a horse&#x27;s ear without acknowledging its mysteries, legends and histories of nature kept in it. Mai Mountain, the only double peaked mountain in the world, is at the center of Jinan Heights on the boundary of the Noryeong Mountains, approximately 32 km to the east of Jeonju and 3 km to the southeast of Jinan-Eup. The whole mountain consists of the sedimentary rocks. The female Mai peak of 673m and the male Mai peak of 667m form the backbone of the Geumgang and Seomjingang rivers.

Gubong Mountain 
Gubong Mountain is unique because you can see all noted mountains in Jeolla-Do in every direction when you arrive at Janggunbong Peak (919 m), the top of Gubong Mountain. The mysterious appearance of the mountain with dominant rock peaks as the mountain name, 6 km from Wunjang Mountain toward the northeast, indicates us that it is the noted mountain that we can&#x27;t easily see. You can clearly see Myeongdobong Peak, Myeongdeokbong Peak and Daedun Mountain forming the Wunilam and Banilam Valley on the north. You have a bird&#x27;s eye view of Bokdubong Peak and Wunjang Mountain connected in the shape of the letter to the west and appreciate the Oknyeobong Peak, the Bugui Mountain and the Mandeok Mountain on the south. Furthermore, the grandiose appearance of Deokyu Mountain and Jiri Mountain enters your line of sight on the southeast.

Mai Mountain Stone Pagoda Group 
If the culmination of mystery made by the nature is Ai Mountain, the summit of mystery made by the people will be Cheonjitap and stone pagodas made of natural stone. The pagoda group under the cliff south of the female Maibong Peak was built by arranging the stones by Paljindobeop drawing in accordance with the harmony of Yin and Yang. The pagodas show the culmination of harmony, sophisticated like an awl and elegant like a big mountain and stand row after row with the main pagoda, Cheonjitap Pagoda, as the summit. The Cheonjitap Pagoda is also a couple pagoda. The pagodas were built based on the Yin and Yang philosophy. The construction of Yin and Yang pagodas on the Yin and Yang Mountain includes a mystery that can&#x27;t be called an accident.

Yongdamho Lake 
Yongdamho LakeYongdamho Lake is the artificial lake created by Yongdam Dam. 
Yongdam Dam is the grand freshwater lake formed by submersing 1 Eup and 5 Myeons such as Yongdam-Myeon, Ancheon-Myeon, Jeongcheon-Myeon, parts of Jucheon-Myeon, Sangjeon-Myeon and part of Jinan-Eup. Yongdam Dam is a concrete rockfill dam, 70m high and 498m long. The freshwater dimension is 30km2, the total volume is 815 million tons and the effective volume reaches to 682 million tons. 
Yongdam Dam uses the diversion scheme method. It was built to supply water to the residents in the Jeonju region, Jeollabuk-Do by supplying 1.35 million tons of water per day from the upper Geumgang River to the upper Mangyeonggang River in Sohyang-Ri Gosan-Myeon Gwanju-Gun through the 3.2m diameter and 21.9 km long water conduction tunnel. 
As the freshwater began to be supplied with the completion of dam construction, Yongdamho Lake became a noted tourists&#x27; site not to be missed in Jinan. 
The route linking Jeongcheon-Myeon, Yongdam-Myeon and Bondaem along the new relocated road around the dam makes for a fantastic drive in harmony with the superb view of the lake. The route linking Ancheon-Myeon and Bondaem is not inferior to the route above.

Using the rivers of Jucheon, Ancheon, Jeongcheon and Sangjeon, the clean and clear mountain areas in northeast Jeollabuk-Do, flowing in around Yongdam, Yongdam Dam was built to supply water to the residents all over Jeollabuk-Do including Jeonju, Gunsan and Iksan. Yongdam Dam project has been a long-cherished project of Jeollabuk-Do. We can&#x27;t deny that we may have losses even though the construction of dam controls flooding around Geumgang River. As about of Jinan is submersed, the sorrow of people whose hometown was in the dam area before submersion will constantly remain.

Wunilam Banilam 
Wunilam BanilamThe marvelous harmony of fantastic rocks and cliffs, clear water and green mountains, heaven and earth, create the scenic masterpiece of Wunilam and Banilam. Run 24 km via Jeongcheon from Jinan-Eup toward the north, and you will arrive at Jucheon-Myeon. Go up about 2 km along the upper Jujacheon River toward the Wunjang Mountain, and you will see the marvelous scene of Wunilam and Banilam. The Jujacheon River valley, about 5m between Myeongdeokbong Peak (845.5m) and Myeongdobong Peak (863m) on the northeast of Wunjang Mountain is called Wunilam and Banilam. There were only the passing cloud, the sky, the stone and the tree because there was only the steep cliff about 70 years ago

Recreation Forest of Wunjang Mountain 
The marvelous harmony of fantastic rocks and cliffs, clear water and green mountains, heaven and earth, create the scenic masterpiece of Wunilam and Banilam. Run 24 km via Jeongcheon from Jinan-Eup toward the north, and you will arrive at Jucheon-Myeon. Go up about 2 km along the upper Jujacheon River toward the Wunjang Mountain, and you will see the marvelous scene of Wunilam and Banilam.

There were only the passing cloud, the sky, the stone and the tree because there was only the steep cliff about 70 years ago.

Wunjang Mountain 
Wunjang Mountain is the dividing ridge of Geumgang River and Mangyeonggang River. Set on the northwestern side of Jinan Heights, it is the oldest peak in the southwestern part of Korea, with the plateau at a height of 1,126m stretching over Dongsang-Myeon of Wangju-Gun, Jeongcheon, Bugui and Jucheon. On the east side stands the Gubong Mountain. With the Gubong Mountain, the Wunjang Mountain achieves great fame as the great mountain with the extraordinary mountain. The Wunjang Mountain has three peaks. The middle peak? called Sangbong Peak, between the east and west peaks, is the highest. It takes about 3 to 4 hours in general but 5 to 6 hours in winter to go around the ridge of pampas grass and small bamboo field.

Punghyeol-Naengcheon(Wind Hole and Cold Spring) 
Go about 10 km from the south to the west of Mai Mountain, and you will find the Punghyeol-Naengcheon on the foot of Daedu Mountain in Yanghwa Village, Seongsu-Myeon. The wind path that was said to have ice even in summer long ago keeps the temperature inside the 67m2 cave? at about 4 by letting the cold wind of 4 out from the gap of Daam rocks. It was used as the agar plant and silkworm eggs storage house during Japanese rule. It is currently used for the residents to keep Kimchi in summer. It is like a refrigerator made by the nature.

<doc id="394637" wikidata="Q14860443" url="?curid=394637" title="Intercultural relations">
<text>Intercultural relations, sometimes called intercultural studies, is a field of social science. It is a multi-disciplinary academic field designed to train students to understand, communicate, and accomplish specific goals outside their own cultures. Intercultural relations involves, at a fundamental level, learning how to see oneself and the world through the eyes of another. It seeks to prepare students for interaction with cultures both similar to their own (e.g. a separate socioeconomic group in one&#x27;s own country) or very different from their own (e.g. an American businessman in a small Amazon tribal society). Some aspects of intercultural relations also include, their power and cultural identity with how the relationship should be upheld with other foreign countries.

==Nature==
The study of intercultural relations incorporates many different academic disciplines. As a field, it is most closely tied to anthropology and sociology, although a degree program in intercultural relations or intercultural studies may also include the study of history, research methods, urban studies, gender studies, public health, many various natural sciences, human development, political science, psychology, religion, missiology, and linguistics or other language training. Often, intercultural programs are designed to translate these academic disciplines into a practical training curricula. Graduate programs will also prepare students for academic research and publication. Especially in today&#x27;s global and multicultural world, students of intercultural relations can use their training in many fields both internationally and domestically, and often pursue careers in social work, law, community development, religious work, and urban development. Intercultural relations offers the opportunity to direct you in experiencing and learning about the diverse relations within our world.

==History==
The origins of the practical use of multi-field intercultural relations can be traced back to Christian missionaries seeking to relate the Christian gospel to other cultures in effective, ethical and culturally sensitive ways. Many intercultural studies programs are offered at religious institutions as training for missionaries and religiously motivated international development workers, and therefore often include some training in theology and evangelism. However, in an increasingly globalized world, the broader discipline attracts persons from many backgrounds with many different career goals. Bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctorate degrees are offered in the discipline.

==Topics==
Some of the main topics of study are:
* Anthropology and Sociology
* Culture Theory
* Development of cultural competence
* Analyzing cultural patterns around the world
* World Religions
* Gender Studies
* Strategies for adapting
* Intercultural communication
* Teaching social skills to reduce cultural misunderstandings
* Research methodology in order to produce academic works and increase access to a culture
* Linguistics
* Intercultural relationships
* Interethnic relationships
* Interracial relationships
* Interreligious relationships

<doc id="394644" wikidata="Q612577" url="?curid=394644" title="Treaty of Tientsin">
<text>The Treaty of Tientsin, also known as the Treaty of Tianjin, is a collective name for several unequal treaties signed at Tianjin (then romanized as Tientsin) in June 1858. The Qing dynasty, Russian Empire, Second French Empire, United Kingdom, and the United States were the parties involved. These treaties, counted by the Chinese among the unequal treaties, opened more Chinese ports to foreign trade, permitted foreign legations in the Chinese capital Beijing, allowed Christian missionary activity, and effectively legalized the import of opium. They ended the first phase of the Second Opium War, which had begun in 1856 and were ratified by the Emperor of China in the Convention of Peking in 1860, after the end of the war.

==Dates==
The Xianfeng Emperor authorized negotiations for the treaty on May 29, 1858. His chief representatives were the Manchu and the Mongol . The Russian treaty was negotiated by Yevfimiy Putyatin and finalized on June 13; the American treaty was negotiated by William Bradford Reed and finalized on June 18; the British treaty was negotiated by James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, and finalized on June 26; and the French treaty was negotiated by Jean-Baptiste-Louis Gros and finalized on June 27.

==American involvement==
Following the pattern set by the great powers of Europe, the United States took on a protectionist stance, built up its navy, and tried to create a mercantile empire. The United States was one of the leading &quot;treaty powers&quot; in China, forcing open a total of 23 foreign concessions from the Chinese government. While it is often noted that the United States did not control any settlements in China, it shared British land grants and was actually invited to take land in Shanghai but refused because the land was thought to be disadvantageous.

==Terms==

===Major points===
# Russia, which had previously been limited to trading at designated border posts, received the right to trade with the treaty ports by sea. Most-favored nation clauses in each treaty further ensured that all concessions were shared by the four powers.
# Guangzhou and the four treaty ports opened to foreign trade and residence by the Treaty of Nanjing were joined by Tainan, Haikou, Shantou, Haicheng, Penglai, Tamsui, and (notionally) Nanjing. The ports at Haicheng and Penglai being found inadequate for European vessels, their status was later extended to nearby Yantai and Yingkou, effectively opening another two ports.
# China was forbidden from considering Russian Orthodox, Protestant, and Roman Catholic Christianity, whether practiced by foreigners or Chinese converts, to be a harmful superstition. All laws, regulations, and practices limiting its observance became null and void everywhere in the country.
# The extraterritoriality of American citizens and Russian, British, and French subjects was reaffirmed. They further received the right to &quot;travel&quot; throughout the Qing Empire for pleasure or business so long as they possessed a valid passport, but the Qing Empire was able to prevent them from lawfully &quot;residing&quot; in the interior with extraterritoriality.
# The Qing Empire permitted foreign vessels to navigate on the Yangtze River but established that no legal trade would be permitted with areas held by the Taiping Rebellion until their reconquest. Foreign trade was to be limited to Zhenjiang, pledged to be opened within the year, and a further three ports to be opened after the suppression of the Taipings. This clause was later used to establish treaty ports at Wuhan and Jiujiang.
# The four nations gained the right to station permanent diplomatic legations in Beijing, which had previously been a closed city. The Russians&#x27; ecclesiastical mission in Beijing was also exempted from its previous restrictions.
# China was forbidden from using the character (understood to mean &quot;barbarian&quot;) in official documents to refer to officials, subjects, or citizens of the four nations.
# China was forbidden from establishing or permitting any further monopolies or cartels over its domestic trade.
# Addenda to the treaties settled China&#x27;s duties and tariffs on terms advantageous to the victors and pledged the Qing Empire would pay an indemnity of 6,000,000 taels of silver: 2 million to France, 2 million to Britain for military expenses, and 2 million as compensation to British merchants.

===Definitions===
The Treaties of Tientsin use several words that have somewhat ambiguous meanings. For example, the words &quot;settlement&quot; and &quot;concession&quot; can often be confused. The term &quot;settlement&quot; refers to a parcel of land, leased to a foreign power, which is composed of both foreign and national peoples, and governed by locally elected foreigners. The term &quot;concession&quot; refers to a long-term lease of land to a foreign power, under which the foreign nation has complete control of the land, which is governed by consular representatives.

<text>Muju County (&quot;Muju-gun&quot;), is a county in North Jeolla Province (Jeollabuk-do), South Korea. Muju is known for its Muju Firefly Festival and is a tourist area.

==History==

During the era of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, Mupung (the present name) in Byeonjin belonged to Silla and was called &quot;Musanhyeon&quot;, and Jugye area (current Muju-eup) in Mahan belonged to Baekje and was called &quot;Jeokcheonhyeon&quot;. It is known that Musan was renamed as &quot;Mupung&quot; and Jeokcheon as &quot;Dancheon&quot; after the Era of Unified Silla (668~917).

After Goryeo (918~1392) was founded, Mupung did not change its name whereas Dancheon was renamed as &quot;Jugye&quot;, and as Joseon rearranged administrative districts in 1414 (the 14th year of Taejong), Mupung and Jugye were incorporated into one district.

It was named as Muju through the combination of the first letters of the two areas, Mupung and Jugye, after they were incorporated into one administrative district.

==Geography==
Muju-gun is situated near four provinces, including Chungbuk, Chungnam, Gyeongbuk and Gyeongnam. Historically and geographically, the area has served as a transitional ground between the east and west part of the southern peninsula and is a site for cultural exchange.

<text>Sunchang County (, &quot;Sunchang-gun&quot;) is a county in North Jeolla Province, South Korea. It is located in a mountainous region of the province and is connected to the city of Jeonju by a modern double-lane free-way that was completed in 2011.

Sunchang&#x27;s claim to fame is its red pepper paste, or &quot;gochujang&quot;, which is supposed to be distinct from other recipes. The governor of the county puts his personal seal of approval on it to make it authentic Sunchang Gochujang.

Famous people from Sunchang include Unification Minister Chung Dong-young, who was born there.

==History==
As a world-famous longevity town and famous producer of traditional soybean pastes including hot pepper paste, the green and citizen-friendly town, Sunchang was once called &#x27;Okcheon&#x27; and &#x27;Osan&#x27; during the Mahan Period.
It was called &#x27;Sunhwa&#x27; during the unified Shilla Period and then &#x27;Sunchang-hyeon&#x27; during the Goryeo Period. Sunchang was elevated from hyeon to gun (County) when the Buddhist monk Jeongo, who came from the town, took the honorable duty as the Monk of the State in 1319 (the 1st year of King Choongsook&#x27;s reign).

<doc id="394649" wikidata="Q364638" url="?curid=394649" title="Adolf Wölfli">
<text>Adolf Wölfli (February 29, 1864 – November 6, 1930) (occasionally spelled Adolf Woelfli or Adolf Wolfli) was a Swiss artist who was one of the first artists to be associated with the Art Brut or outsider art label.

==Early life==
Wölfli was born in Bern. He was abused both physically and sexually as a child, and was orphaned at the age of 10. He thereafter grew up in a series of state-run foster homes. He worked as a &quot;Verdingbub&quot; (indentured child laborer) and briefly joined the army. He was charged with the attempted sexual abuse of minors and was sentenced to a prison term. In 1895, following another similar arrest, he was admitted to the Waldau Clinic, a psychiatric hospital in Bern where he would live out the rest of his life. He was very disturbed and sometimes violent upon admission, leading to him being kept in isolation during his early time at the hospital. He experienced psychosis, which led to intense hallucinations.

==Creative works==
At some point after his admission Wölfli began to draw. His first surviving works (a series of 50 pencil drawings) are dated from between 1904 and 1906.

Walter Morgenthaler, a doctor at the Waldau Clinic, took a particular interest in Wölfli&#x27;s art and his condition, later publishing &quot;Ein Geisteskranker als Künstler&quot; (A Psychiatric Patient as Artist) in 1921 which first brought Wölfli to the attention of the art world.
Morgenthaler&#x27;s book detailed the works of a patient who seemed to have no previous interest in art and developed his talents and skills independently after being committed for a debilitating condition. In this respect, Wölfli was an iconoclast and influenced the development and acceptance of outsider art, &quot;Art Brut&quot; and its champion Jean Dubuffet.

Wölfli produced a huge number of works during his life, often working with the barest of materials and trading smaller works with visitors to the clinic to obtain pencils, paper or other essentials. Morgenthaler closely observed Wölfli&#x27;s methods, writing in his influential book:

&quot;Every Monday morning Wölfli is given a new pencil and two large sheets of unprinted newsprint. The pencil is used up in two days; then he has to make do with the stubs he has saved or with whatever he can beg off someone else. He often writes with pieces only five to seven millimetres long and even with the broken-off points of lead, which he handles deftly, holding them between his fingernails. He carefully collects packing paper and any other paper he can get from the guards and patients in his area; otherwise he would run out of paper before the next Sunday night. At Christmas the house gives him a box of coloured pencils, which lasts him two or three weeks at the most.&quot;

The images Wölfli produced were complex, intricate and intense. They worked to the very edges of the page with detailed borders. In a manifestation of Wölfli&#x27;s &quot;horror vacui&quot;, every empty space was filled with two small holes. Wölfli called the shapes around these holes his &quot;birds&quot;.

His images also incorporated an idiosyncratic musical notation. This notation seemed to start as a purely decorative affair but later developed into real composition which Wölfli would play on a paper trumpet.

In 1908, he set about creating a semi-autobiographical epic which eventually stretched to 45 volumes, containing a total of over 25,000 pages and 1,600 illustrations. This work was a mix of elements of his own life blended with fantastical stories of his adventures from which he transformed himself from a child to &#x27;Knight Adolf&#x27; to &#x27;Emperor Adolf&#x27; and finally to &#x27;St Adolf II&#x27;. Text and illustrations formed the narrative, sometimes combining multiple elements on kaleidoscopic pages of music, words and colour.

After Wölfli died at Waldau in 1930, his works were taken to the Museum of the Waldau Clinic in Bern. Later, the Adolf Wölfli Foundation was formed to preserve his art for future generations. Its collection is now on display at the Museum of Fine Arts in Bern.

==Music and audio recordings==
Wölfli&#x27;s work has inspired many composers. Danish composer Per Nørgård, after viewing a Wölfli exhibition in 1979, embarked on a schizoid style lasting for several years; among the works of this time are an opera on the life of Wölfli called &quot;The Divine Circus&quot;. The chamber opera &quot;Wölfli Szenen&quot; (&quot;Wölfli Scenes&quot;), which premiered in Graz, Austria, in 1981, featured music by Georg Friedrich Haas, the Austrian composer of spectral music, Gösta Neuwirth, Anton Prestele and Wolfgang Rihm.

On their web site, The Adolph Wölfli Foundation poses the following question:

In 1978, &quot;Adolf Wölfli: Gelesen Und Vertont&quot;, the first recording of Wölfli&#x27;s work ever to be published, was released by the Adolf Wölfli Foundation, Museum of Fine Arts, Bern. Since that time, a number of German musicians have released adaptations of Wölfli&#x27;s work. A comprehensive list of these artists can be found at The Adolph Wölfli Foundation&#x27;s music page.

In 1987, musician and composer Graeme Revell released an LP entitled &quot;Necropolis, Amphibians &amp; Reptiles: The Music of Adolf Wolfli&quot;. This was on his own Musique Brut label in London, UK in 1987. This audio compilation was based on the works of Wölfli and incorporated digital renditions of Wölfli&#x27;s compositions, with additional sound effects and ambient soundscapes added to the songs, by Revell, based on the artwork surrounding Wölfli&#x27;s musical notations. The LP was a collection of musical interpretations by Revell as well as DDAA, &amp; Nurse With Wound. This LP came with a booklet with a biography and images of Wolfli&#x27;s works. Tracks 8 and 9 are combined into one track. This record was later re-released as &quot;The Musique Brut Collection&quot; on CD by the Grey Area record label, a sub-label of UK-based Mute Records, under the parent label EMI UK. This audio compilation also includes the other Musique Brut LP release &quot;The Insect Musicians&quot;. The CD release also contains a small booklet containing pictures of Wölfli&#x27;s artwork, information about his history, and a brief write-up on Revell&#x27;s process of converting Wölfli&#x27;s lithographs into songs.

In 1992, Terry Riley composed and performed a two-hour opera entitled &quot;The Saint Adolf Ring&quot; based on Wölfli&#x27;s life.

In 2010, Baudouin De Jaer released a record entitled &quot;The Heavenly Ladder&quot; with compositions by Wölfli.

<doc id="394651" wikidata="Q2161693" url="?curid=394651" title="Akeley, Buckinghamshire">
<text>Akeley is a village and civil parish in north-west Buckinghamshire, England. The village is on the A413 road, between Lillingstone Dayrell and Maids Moreton, and around north of Buckingham. The 2011 Census recorded the population of the parish as 514, down from 545 at the 2001 Census.

==Village background==
The village name is derived from the Old English for &quot;Oak Field&quot;. The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded it as &quot;Achelei&quot;.

The village was controlled by the Cluniac priory of nearby Newton Longville on behalf of the priory of Saint Faith in Longueville in northern France. The parish church of St. James the Apostle was built in Akeley in 1154. It was rebuilt to designs by the Gothic Revival architect John Tarring in 1854 and restored in 1901. By the mid 20th century St. James&#x27; had fallen into disrepair and in 1982 it was demolished. Akeley presently does not have its own parish church; it is part of the North Buckingham ecclesiastical parish.

Akeley once had a medieval deer park, and a school where poor children were taught to make lace.

==Amenities==
The village is a small primary school St James Church of England School, and outside the village the large Cognita run private Akeley Wood School.

The village has a pub (Bull &amp; Butcher) and opened a new village hall in 2006.

Akeley hosts an annual horticultural show, which has been run since 1976.

== Stockholt ==
The ancient hamlet of Stockholt once lay within the parish boundary. It has been amalgamated with the modern village.

<doc id="394660" wikidata="Q1817496" url="?curid=394660" title="Peace Pilgrim">
<text>Peace Pilgrim (July 18, 1908 – July 7, 1981), born Mildred Lisette Norman, was an American spiritual teacher, mystic, pacifist, vegetarian activist and peace activist. In 1952, she became the first woman to walk the entire length of the Appalachian Trail in one season. Starting on January 1, 1953, in Pasadena, California, she adopted the name &quot;Peace Pilgrim&quot; and walked across the United States for 28 years, speaking with others about peace. She was on her seventh cross-country journey when she died.

A transcript of a 1964 conversation with Peace Pilgrim from a broadcast on KPFK radio in Los Angeles was published as &quot;&quot;. She stopped counting miles in that year, having walked more than for peace.

== Early life ==
Mildred Lisette Norman was born on a poultry farm in Egg Harbor City, New Jersey, in 1908, the oldest of three children. Her mother, Josephine Marie Ranch, was a tailor, and her father, Ernest Norman, a carpenter. Although poor, the Norman family was admired in a community of German immigrants, whose relatives originally settled the area after escaping Germany in 1855.

In 1933 she eloped with Stanley Ryder and moved to Philadelphia in 1939. They divorced in 1946. She became a vegetarian for ethical reasons, stating that as she could not kill any living creature. She believed that meat eating was poisonous to the body and lived on a diet of fruits, nuts, vegetables, wholegrains and dairy products.

== Pilgrimage ==

In the book, &quot;Peace Pilgrim: Her Life and Work in Her Own Words,&quot; she related that her physical journey began after having experienced a &quot;spiritual awakening,&quot; following a long period of meditation practice. She said that this awakening was a direct, mystical experience of the &quot;creator&#x27;s&quot; love. She claimed that this spurred her to then start her decades-long walking journey for peace.

Her pilgrimage spanned almost three decades beginning January 1, 1953, in Pasadena, California. The Korean War was in progress. She continued walking for 28 years, spanning the American involvement in the Vietnam War and beyond. Peace Pilgrim was a frequent speaker at churches, universities, and local and national radio and television.

Expressing her ideas about peace, she referred to herself only as &quot;Peace Pilgrim.&quot;
Peace Pilgrim&#x27;s only possessions were the clothes on her back and the few items she carried in the pockets of her blue tunic which read &quot;Peace Pilgrim&quot; on the front and &quot;25,000 miles on foot for peace&quot; on the back. She had no organizational backing, carried no money, and would not even ask for food or shelter. When she began her pilgrimage she had taken a vow to &quot;remain a wanderer until mankind has learned the way of peace, walking until given shelter and fasting until given food.&quot;

On July 7, 1981, while being driven to a speaking engagement near Knox, Indiana, Peace Pilgrim was killed in an automobile accident. The accident occurred on Indiana State Road 23, around south of the bridge crossing Eagle Creek about north of Indiana State Road 23&#x27;s intersection with Indiana State Road 8. A marker is in the front lawn on the west side of the highway.

At the time of her death, she was crossing the United States for the seventh time. After her death, her body was cremated, and her ashes were interred in a family plot near Egg Harbor City, New Jersey.

<text>Salasaca is a community and an indigenous people located in the Tungurahua Province in the center of Ecuador, halfway along the road from Ambato to Baños. The Salasaca speak Spanish and their traditional language of Quichua. Their main economic activities are agriculture, livestock-raising, and handcrafts.

A market in the central plaza of Salasaca is called &quot;Plaza of the Arts.&quot; Local craftsmanship includes items such as tapestries, which are woven by hand on looms of very ancient technology. Many of the designs depict different aspects of their lives. Pigments are often derived from the female cochineal of the Dactylopius family which are crushed to make red colors. Salasca women wear a woolen garment around the shoulders, personalized by choosing a different shade of red. After pressing the insects into cakes, they use the dried cakes to dye the garments three at a time. One is left crimson, one is soaked in lemon juice to turn it scarlet, and the third is rubbed with wood ashes to turn it purple.

The Quichua Salasaca perform traditional music using a flute and drum. In the 21st century, the Quechua Salasaca have been incorporating other sounds that complement their traditional melodies.

In June, Salasaca people celebrate the Inca new year festival called Inti Raymi, an ancient festival of the sun, which is celebrated in all Quechua communities of the Highlands (Sierra). In the Salasaca festival circuit, the &quot;Varayuk&quot; or Mayor, who carries a wand that represents power and authority within the community, is the main personality.

<text>The Battle of Klushino, or the Battle of Kłuszyn, was fought on 4 July 1610, between forces of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Tsardom of Russia during the Polish–Russian War, part of Russia&#x27;s Time of Troubles. The battle occurred near the village of Klushino () near Smolensk (Polish: &quot;Smoleńsk&quot;). In the battle the outnumbered Polish-Lithuanian force secured a decisive victory over Russia, due to the tactical competence of hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski and the military prowess of Polish hussars, the elite of the army of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. The battle is remembered as one of the greatest triumphs of the Polish cavalry and an example of excellence and supremacy of the Polish military at the time.

==Background==
In 1610, in response to the Polish-Lithuanian advance on Russia, Russia and Sweden formed an alliance, and launched an operation known as the De la Gardie Campaign. A Russian army under Prince Dmitry Shuisky was heading towards the besieged fortress of Smolensk, but was intercepted by Polish-Lithuanian forces. In the meantime, Shuisky divided his forces into several smaller units.

The Polish-Lithuanian forces of about 12,000 under hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski encountered the advance Russian force of 8,000 under Grigory Valuyev and attempted to attack it soon after dawn on 24 June, but the Russians were able to fortify their positions at Tsaryovo-Zaymishche camp. The Russian troops found themselves encircled and trapped in their camp, but the main force under Shuisky, of about 35,000, was only days away. Russia, however, did not know the real strength of the Polish-Lithuanian forces, and how greatly they outnumbered them. Further, the besieged advance unit failed to notify Shuisky that it had encountered the Polish-Lithuanian army. On the other hand, Żółkiewski was confident in his powerful hussars, and decided to press with the attack. On 3 July he decided to leave part of his forces besieging the camp, and take the most mobile units against Shuisky&#x27;s troops. The ruse was successful, as the besieged troops never realized that the bulk of the Polish-Lithuanian army was temporarily engaged elsewhere, and neither was Shuisky aware of the Polish-Lithuanian movements nor expecting a major engagement.

==Opposing forces==
The Polish-Lithuanian forces numbering about 6,500–6,800 men (of which about 5,500, or about 80 percent, were the famous &quot;winged&quot; hussars) under Hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski faced a numerically superior force of about 30,000 Russians under Princes Dmitry Shuisky, Andrey Galitzine, and Danilo Mezetsky, as well as about 5,000 mercenary units temporarily allied to Russia, under the command of Jacob De la Gardie, composed of Flemish, French, Irish, German, Spanish, English, and Scottish soldiers. Including the forces that did not take part in combat (remained in camp, reserve, or were delayed), the numbers were 12,300 Polish-Lithuanian soldiers against 48,000 soldiers under Russian command. The Polish-Lithuanian army was supported by two cannons (some sources say four), and the Tsardom of Russia by 11.

==Battle==

According to a description based on the work of Leszek Podhorecki, although the Poles were more aware that the battle was about to take place, the forces encountered one another in the darkness of the night, and Żółkiewski decided to organize his army rather than engaging immediately, which also gave the Tsardom of Russia time to prepare. According to Mirosław Nagielski, however, the Poles under Żółkiewski purposefully chose to engage the opponent at that time, hoping to catch them asleep.

The Russian army was divided into foreign mercenary regiments on the right (north-west) flank, and the main Russian army on the center and left (south-east) flank. The Russian battle line consisted of infantry (pikemen, musketeers, arquebusiers), mostly behind the village fences, with a second line of cavalry to the rear and on the left wing (where there were fewer fences). The Russian artillery, left in the camp, played no role in the battle. Polish units consisted primarily of cavalry, namely the Polish hussars, with about 400 Cossack infantry on the left wing. Another 200 infantry and two cannons would arrive later, and did not participate in the first part of the battle.

The battlefield, a flat agricultural field, was crossed by a high village picket fence, reinforced by improvised fieldworks, which allowed the Polish hussars to charge only through a narrow gap.

The battle began before dawn. The first part of the battle consisted of Polish hussars repeatedly charging the fortified Russian positions, attempting to break them. The Polish forces continued to make ferocious attacks, and Samuel Maskiewicz, a witness from one hussar company, claimed that his unit charged eight or ten times. The Polish hussars&#x27; attacks on the infantry, hidden behind the fences, and using firearms, were not successful.

Hoping to take advantage of Polish exhaustion, Shuiski ordered a reiter unit to counterattack the hussars. 
However, their attempt to employ caracole tactics ended disastrously when the Polish cavalry instead closed into melee after discharging their firearms. As this Russian cavalry counterattack was mauled by the Poles, the left flank of the Russian army was broken and, in the ensuing confusion, Russian ranks broke and they were pushed back towards their camp gates.

While the center of the Russian army disintegrated, Russian regiments continued to hold on the right wing until they were overpowered, and the mercenary troops continued to put up strong resistance for several hours on the left wing. Eventually when the Polish infantry and cannons arrived, the mercenaries were forced to abandon their positions. A large portion of the foreign troops managed to retreat under the protection of their long infantry pikes in good order to the safety of their fortified camp (which was separate from the Russian camp).

The Polish forces now surrounded the two enemy camps. Further, the mercenaries who took positions in the forest were surrounded as well. However, the Russian fortified camp, filled with some still unbloodied troops (outnumbering the exhausted Polish force) was a serious obstacle.

Żółkiewski decided to attempt negotiations with the enemy, with significant success. Abandoned by the Russians, the foreign mercenaries entered negotiations with the Polish troops and eventually surrendered, having reached satisfactory conditions. The mercenaries were allowed to withdraw under the condition that they would not enlist with the Tsardom of Russia against the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth again. Additionally, several hundred mercenaries chose to switch sides, enlisting with the Polish-Lithuanian army.

==Aftermath==
The main Russian army was then allowed to retreat, as Shuisky preferred not to reengage in hostilities – despite the advice of his other commanders to the contrary. Meanwhile, the Polish were exhausted and more interested in looting the camp and (according to Podhorecki) did not attempt to stop the Russians. According to another account by Nagielski, they pursued the retreating Russians, inflicting several thousand casualties. The Poles took much loot and trophies, from luxury goods (gold, silver, furs) to military equipment (including all 11 Russian artillery pieces) to war trophies (several command flags and banners).

Overall, the battle lasted about five hours. Shuisky&#x27;s losses were about 5,000; Żółkiewski&#x27;s, about 400 (including 100 hussars).

The battle is seen by modern historians as a decisive victory in the war, although contemporary accounts were less clear on this issue, and some tried to stress the importance of the Siege of Smolensk, commanded by the Polish-Lithuanian king Sigismund III Vasa, and downplay Żółkiewski&#x27;s victory. Regardless, following the battle, Żółkiewski then turned back towards the Russians at Tsaryovo-Zaymishche, commanded by Valuyev, who after learning about the defeat of their relief force at Kluszyno decided to surrender. Soon after the battle, Tsar Vasili IV was ousted by the Seven Boyars and Żółkiewski entered Moscow with little opposition. The Seven Boyars then proclaimed the Polish-Lithuanian prince of the Commonwealth Władysław IV Waza as the new Tsar of Russia. He claimed the Tsar&#x27;s title from 1610 to 1634 but never assumed the throne, as his father and Commonwealth king, Zygmunt III Waza, failed to negotiate a lasting agreement with the boyars; the Polish-Lithuanian garrison in Moscow was soon besieged and would surrender a year later.

The Battle of Klushino is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, with the inscription &quot;KŁUSZYN – MOSKWA 2 VII – 28 VIII 1610&quot;.

<text>Ascott is a hamlet and country house in the parish of Wing, Buckinghamshire, England. The hamlet lies completely within the boundary of the Ascott Estate; it is home to many of the estate and house staff.

Prior to the Norman Conquest there was an abbey at Ascott, that had been given by a royal to a Benedictine convent in Angiers. In 1415 however, the same year as the Battle of Agincourt, the convent was seized by the English church because it belonged to the French and awarded to the Convent of St Mary du Pre, near St Albans.

In the early 16th century the abbey (along with the manor of Wing) was seized by the Crown and given to Cardinal Wolsey, however not long after it was seized once again in the Dissolution of the Monasteries and given to Robert Dormer. In 1554 William Dormer entertained Princess Elizabeth at the house, when she was on the road to London under arrest as a Protestant because her sister Mary had just taken the throne. Anne of Denmark visited in 1612, and James VI and I was entertained at Ascott by Anne, Lady Dormer, in 1620.

The former abbey, now a house, once featured additions that were attributed to Inigo Jones. The house fell into decay following the death without heirs of Charles Dormer, 2nd Earl of Carnarvon in 1709. In 1727 the house and estate were broken up, the deer sold and all the timber cut down and sold off. In the late 19th century members of the Rothschild banking family began to acquire estates in the area, including Ascott. In 1873 a farm house in the parish known as Ascott Hall was bought by Baron Mayer de Rothschild he gave it to his nephew Leopold de Rothschild who employed the architect George Devey to enlarge the property into a substantial country house. Today this is the National Trust property known as Ascott House or sometimes known more simply as just &quot;Ascott&quot;.

<doc id="394670" wikidata="Q180200" url="?curid=394670" title="Harju County">
<text>Harju County ( or &quot;Harjumaa&quot;), is one of the fifteen counties of Estonia. It is situated in northern Estonia, on the southern coast of the Gulf of Finland, and borders Lääne-Viru County to the east, Järva County to the southeast, Rapla County to the south, and Lääne County to the southwest. The capital and largest city of Estonia, Tallinn, is situated in Harju County. Harju is the largest county in Estonia in terms of population, as almost half (45%) of Estonia&#x27;s population lives in Harju County.

== History ==

===Ancient history===
The territory of modern Harju County consists mostly of two ancient Estonian counties: Revala, around what is now Tallinn, and Harjumaa, which was situated south of Revala and presently rests mostly in Rapla County. Lindanise, then a small trading post at the Gulf of Finland, served as the capital of Revala. It eventually grew into the mostly German-populated Hanseatic town of &quot;Reval&quot; and later into the Estonian capital, Tallinn.

===Conquest===
In 1219, the Danish King, Valdemar II, landed in Lindanise (Danish: &quot;Lyndanisse&quot;) and conquered both Revala and Harju counties, while the inhabitants were forced into Christianity. At the end of the Livonian Crusade (1208–1227 in Estonia), both counties were captured by the Order of the Sword Brothers until given back to Denmark with the Treaty of Stensby in 1238.

The Danes built the Toompea Castle (&quot;Castrum Danorum&quot;) on Toompea Hill in Tallinn, which quickly became the biggest settlement in Estonia. In 1248, it was the first settlement in Estonia to receive its town rights, and in 1285 it became the northernmost member of the Hanseatic League.

German dominance led to the St. George&#x27;s Night Uprising, which broke out in 1343 with the burning of Padise Abbey in modern Padise Parish. The uprising led Denmark to sell its possessions in Northern Estonia to the Livonian Order. In 1561, after the outbreak of the Livonian War, the nobility of North Estonia and the Tallinn Town Council declared loyalty to Sweden. Tallinn and other Swedish-occupied territories gained during warfare were secured by the Treaty of Plyussa.

During the Great Northern War, Harju was one of the few regions in Estonia untouched by warfare for a long time. Nonetheless, Harju County was greatly affected by the 1710-1713 Plague that killed more than eighty percent of the county&#x27;s population. Russian forces finally arrived in 1710 and laid siege to Tallinn for a month until the Swedish garrison surrendered, thus ending the Great Northern War in Estonia. Russian rule was secured with the Treaty of Nystad in 1721. The plague raged on for several years, eventually leaving several parts of the county completely empty of human habitation.

===Russian rule===


Imperial Russian rule started with the construction of naval harbours in Tallinn and Paldiski (Swedish: &quot;Rogerwiek&quot;). Russian Tsar Peter I visited Tallinn at least nine times between 1711 and 1723. He personally opened the construction for Tallinn Naval Harbour in 1714 and Paldiski Naval Harbour in 1718.

In 1870, the Paldiski-Tallinn-St. Petersburg Railway was opened, after which several smaller settlements along the line - Paldiski, Keila, Saue, Nõmme, Aruküla, Raasiku, Kehra and Aegviidu (then in Viru County) - started to grow. Several elements of Peter the Great&#x27;s Naval Fortress were built in Harju County and its headquarters were in Tallinn.

During World War I in 1914, the native population of Naissaar island was expelled from the island and it was turned into a military base. A narrow-gauge railway network was built on the island. Tallinn was the site for the very beginning of the October Revolution when the Estonian Bolshevik Jaan Anvelt took power in Tallinn on 5 November 1917, two days before the Revolution started in Petrograd. On 9 November 1917, the Bolsheviks took power from Governor Jaan Poska. After the coup, refusing to cooperate with the Estonian Soviet Executive Committee, the Estonian Provincial Assembly (Estonian: &quot;Maanõukogu&quot;) in Tallinn declared sovereignty from the Russian Empire on 28 November 1917. In December 1917, Russian sailors under the leadership of Stepan Maximovich Petrichenko declared the &quot;Soviet Republic of Soldiers and Fortress-Builders of Naissaar&quot;. They were ousted by German forces on 26 February 1918.

===Republic of Estonia===
The Republic of Estonia was proclaimed in Tallinn on 24 February 1918 while German occupation followed on the next day. German rule ended with the November Revolution in Germany. During the Estonian War of Independence, Soviet troops were halted only 40 km east of Tallinn by the end of 1918. Tallinn was the site of a failed Communist coup d&#x27;état attempt of 1924.

===Occupation era===

====Soviet occupation====
On 18 September 1939, after both Germany and the Soviet Union had invaded Poland, the Polish submarine ORP Orzeł escaped from internment in Tallinn Harbor during the Orzeł incident. The submarine eventually made her way to the United Kingdom, which led both the Soviet Union and Germany to question Estonia&#x27;s neutrality. On 24 September 1939, Soviet Navy warships appeared in North Estonian waters and Soviet Air Force bombers patrolled above Tallinn and the nearby countryside.

The Soviet Union demanded that Estonia allow the Soviet military bases and stationed 25,000 troops on Estonian soil for the duration of the European war. On 28 September 1939, the government of Estonia accepted the ultimatum and signed the mutual assistance treaty. Paldiski was made a Soviet Naval Base and its population was expelled from the town. With its new military bases in Northern Estonia, the Soviet Union invaded Finland on 30 November 1939, starting the Winter War. During 1939–1940, most of the Baltic German population from Tallinn and the Harju County countryside fled to Germany (&quot;Umsiedlung&quot;).

On 14 June 1940, the Soviet Navy set up a naval blockade in the Gulf of Finland and the Baltic Sea and stationed a navy squadron west of Naissaar island near Tallinn. Soviet bombers shot down the passenger airplane &quot;Kaleva&quot; near Keri island, killing all nine on board, which had included foreign diplomats.

On 16 June 1940, the Red Army invaded Estonia and organised a Soviet &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in Tallinn. On 21 June 1940, the Independent Signal Battalion in Tallinn showed resistance to the Red Army, until it surrendered and was disarmed on the same day. The Soviet powers organised rigged parliamentary elections and the new parliament declared the Estonian SSR on 21 July 1940, which was annexed by the Soviet Union on 6 August 1940. Most county and municipal leaders were replaced and local assemblies were replaced with Soviets. The native population of Naissaar island was expelled from the island (as in 1914) as the island was turned into a military base. During the 1940–41 Soviet Occupation, thousands were executed, imprisoned, mobilised into the Red Army labour battalions or deported to Siberia on 14 June 1941 (June deportation).

====Summer War====

Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 and Finland declared the Continuation War with the Soviet Union on 25 June 1941. As the Soviet Union retreated, its destruction battalions carried out the scorched-earth tactics. The Erna long-range reconnaissance group was sent from Finland to Northern Estonia on 10 July 1941 to perform reconnaissance of the retreating Red Army, but it eventually engaged the destruction battalions near Kautla forest (Battle of Kautla) on 31 July to 1 August 1941, allowing 2,000 civilians to flee.

German forces started its Tallinn Offensive on 19 August 1941, capturing Rapla on 21 August 1941. They reached Tallinn outskirts in Pirita on 24 August 1941 and Harku and Lasnamäe on 26 August 1941. Ordinary citizens were ordered to build defenses around Tallinn. Soviet forces started evacuating by sea on 24 August 1941. Of the 195 ships, that left Tallinn and Paldiski, 55 were sunk by mines near Juminda Peninsula, killing around 15,000 evacuees. Evacuating Soviet forces destroyed much of the infrastructure and industry around Tallinn. German forces captured Paldiski and Tallinn on 28 August 1941, shooting down the Soviet Flag on Tallinn Pikk Hermann Tower. Estonians replaced it with the Flag of Estonia, but it was replaced with the Flag of Germany the next day. German forces were greeted as liberators in Tallinn. It was also the first time since 1219 that Tallinn had been captured following a military engagement.

====German occupation====

Northern Estonia was the site of several concentration camps and massacres. In September 1942, up to three thousand foreign Jews and Gypsies were executed at Kalevi-Liiva in Jõelähtme Parish, while the rest were sent to the small Jägala concentration camp nearby, that never had more than 200 prisoners as their lifespan was short. Klooga concentration camp in Keila Parish was mostly evacuated before the Soviet takeover, however, 2,000 prisoners were executed before the German retreat. The Red Army liberated the few survivors on 22 September 1944.
Tallinn was bombed by the Soviet Air Force on 9 and 10 March 1944, killing 757 people and destroying 8,000 buildings (about one-third of the capital). Among others, Harju Street, St. Nicholas&#x27; Church, and Estonia Theatre were hit. 36-38 Soviet bombers were shot down during the bombardment.

After the Red Army broke through the Tannenberg Line in Eastern Estonia and crossed the Emajõgi river near Tartu, it launched the Tallinn Offensive on 17 September 1944 when Adolf Hitler had agreed to start abandoning Estonia on 16 September 1944. The National Committee of the Republic of Estonia was formed in Tallinn in March 1944 and the last Prime Minister of Estonia Jüri Uluots organized a new government under Otto Tief on 18 September 1944, captured government offices in Tallinn on 20 September 1944, and put the Estonian flag on top of the Pikk Hermann Tower.

German forces started Operation Aster to evacuate its 50,000 soldiers and 20,000 civilians through Tallinn and Paldiski. On the way, the hospital ship &quot;Moero&quot; was attacked and sunk by the Soviet Air Force, killing 637 of its passengers. The retreating German forces avoided conflict with the Red Army in Tallinn and the invading army saw only little resistance by Estonian units led by Rear Admiral Johan Pitka. The Red Army entered Tallinn on 22 September and Paldiski on 24 September 1944.

Before the Soviet reoccupation in 1944, thousands fled to Sweden across the Baltic Sea, including the entire Estonian Swedish population, who had been settling also on Pakri islands in Harju County.

====Second Soviet occupation====
The Forest Brothers resistance movement was considered to be the weakest in Harju County, due to dense population, fewer forests and more Soviet military activity. New deportations followed in 1949. The Soviet era brought development of heavy industry, a massive influx of foreign workers from throughout the Soviet Union and construction of new districts (Maardu, Mustamäe, Väike-Õismäe and Lasnamäe) for Tallinn.

Hotel Viru in Tallinn was built in 1972 as the first modern highrise in Estonia. The 1980 Summer Olympics Sailing events were held in Tallinn. The event also brought major construction, such as the seaside road from Central Tallinn to Pirita, renovation projects in Tallinn Old Town and the iconic highrise Hotel Olümpia and Tallinn TV Tower.

In 1962, Paldiski became a Soviet Navy nuclear submarine training centre and had two land-based nuclear reactors with 16,000 employees. It was a closed town until the last Russian warship left in August 1994. Until then it was the last Russian military base in Estonia. Russia relinquished control of the nuclear reactor facilities in September 1995.

== Administrative history ==
===Formation of the county===

The ancient counties of Harjumaa and Revala were merged into Harju County in 1266. It remained within most of its borders until 1949 (with the exclusion of 1783–1796, when Paldiski County was separated).

During the Soviet occupation, in 1940, Tallinn became a city of republic significance. Loksa was transferred to Viru County in 1949. The rest of Harju County was replaced with four raions during the Soviet occupation in 1950. Harju Raion around Tallinn gradually absorbed the former areas of Harju County as Loksa Raion was abolished in 1957, Kose Raion in 1959 and Keila Raion in 1962 and most of their territories transferred to Harju Raion. Aegviidu, Aegviidu Village Council and Kohila Village Council were transferred to Harju Raion in 1962. Harju Raion and the remaining Rapla Raion became Harju County and Rapla County in 1990. Tallinn was reincorporated into Harju County in 1993.

===Municipal history===
====Urban municipalities====
Tallinn was the first settlement in Harju County to receive town rights in 1248. Municipally, it consisted of the &quot;upper town&quot; of Toompea and the &quot;lower town&quot;. The two municipalities were merged in 1877. The naval harbour town of Paldiski received its town rights in 1783. Nõmme was given a town status in 1926 and Keila in 1938.

Soviet powers merged Nõmme with Tallinn already in 1940. They also separated Tallinn from Harju County and it became a centrally administered town. The same was applied to Paldiski in 1941. The German occupation of 1941-1944 left only Tallinn separated from Harju County. The Soviet reoccupation brought Paldiski back to central administration. Tallinn was divided into four urban raions in 1945 and it gained several new territories from its surrounding parishes. Aegviidu (then in Järva County), Järvakandi and Kohila (both now in Rapla County) and Kehra were named boroughs. The central administration of Paldiski was abolished in 1950 when Paldiski was merged with Keila Raion. Tallinn absorbed Saue in 1960 and Maardu in 1962 and the latter became a town within the municipality of Tallinn in 1980.

Maardu and Saue were separated from Tallinn in 1991 and Kehra, Loksa and Saue were given town status in 1993. The central administration of Tallinn was abolished and the town was re-transferred into Harju County. Its urban raions were abolished in 1993 and replaced with eight modern districts.

====Rural municipalities====
Ancient Estonian counties were divided into parishes (Estonian language: &quot;kihelkond&quot;), that became centered on local churches from the 13th century. Modern municipal parishes (Estonian: &quot;vald&quot;) were created in the 19th century. They were created within the old parishes, that were still centered on the local church.

Soviet rule brought major changes in rural municipalities as local village councils were created throughout 1945. The parishes were abolished with the creation of raions in 1950. Naissaar Parish had been abolished and given to the Red Army already in 1940 and Pakri Parish had been abolished and merged with Paldiski in 1947.

Village councils were renamed &quot;parishes&quot; in 1990–1993. Kehra merged into Anija Parish in 2002, Loksa Parish merged into Kuusalu Parish in 2005 and Kõue Parish merged into Kose Parish in 2013.

== Geography ==


Harju County lies on the southern coast of the Gulf of Finland. Its shores are dominated by the North-Estonian coastal plain and the North-Estonian Klint separates the plain from Harju plateau in central and southern Harju County. The forested Kõrvemaa area is situated in eastern Harju County and the West-Estonian plain in western Harju County.

===Shoreline===
The shoreline is mostly low, but is at some places close to the high North-Estonian Klint. The coastal cliff is the highest in Rannamõisa () and Türisalu () in Harku Parish, and in three points in Paldiski: Pakri Peninsula (), Leetse () and Väike-Pakri island (). There are also several long sand beaches, for example Kakumäe, Stroomi in Pelguranna, Pikakari in Paljassaare and Pirita along the shoreline and Lake Harku in Pikaliiva, all within Tallinn, and Kloogaranna and Kaberneeme in the countryside. The shoreline is also characterized by many peninsulas, such as Pakri, Lohusalu, Suurupi, Kakumäe, Kopli, Paljassaare, Viimsi, Ihasalu, Kaberneeme, Juminda and Pärispea.

===Islands===
The shoreline is dotted with several islands, with the largest ones being Naissaar (), Väike-Pakri (), Suur-Pakri (), Prangli (), Aegna () and Rammu (). All of the larger islands and several of the smaller islands have had a considerable historical population. Pakri Islands, Naissaar and Prangli even formed separate municipalities. Their population diminished during Soviet occupation, either gradually or by force. Today, Prangli (73 inhabitants) and Naissaar (three inhabitants) both consist of three villages within Viimsi Parish. Aegna (eight inhabitants) is a subdistrict in Kesklinn (central) district of Tallinn. Pakri islands (six inhabitants) are part of Paldiski. Koipsi and Rammu form uninhabited villages within Jõelähtme Parish.

===Lakes and rivers===
The largest lakes in Harju County are Lake Ülemiste () and Lake Harku () in Tallinn and Lake Kahala () in Kuusalu Parish. The largest artificial lake is Paunküla Reservoir () in Kose Parish. The longest rivers are the Keila River ( in total), Pirita River (), Jägala River () and Valgejõgi River (). The two largest permanently active waterfalls in Estonia, Jägala Waterfall () and Keila Falls (), are situated on these rivers.

===Protected areas===

There are a number of protected areas in Harju County. Lahemaa National Park was the first national park in the Soviet Union, when it was created in 1971. The park was intended for the protection of the natural and cultural heritage of the coastal landscapes of Northern Estonia. There are 21 nature reserves and 25 landscape protection areas, that are at least partly situated in Harju County. The largest is the Põhja-Kõrvemaa Nature Reserve in Kuusalu Parish and Anija Parish.

<text>The Russian Liberation Army (; , &#x27;, [[Abbreviation|abbreviated]] as , , also known as theVlasov army(,&#x27;) was a collaborationist formation, primarily composed of Russians, that fought under German command during World War II. From January 1945, the army was led by Andrey Vlasov, a Red Army general who had defected, and members of the army are often referred to as &quot;Vlasovtsy&quot; (). In 1944, it became known as the Armed Forces of the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia (, &quot;&quot;, abbreviated as , ).

Vlasov agreed to collaborate with Nazi Germany after having been captured on the Eastern Front. The soldiers of the ROA command were mostly former Soviet prisoners of war but also included some White Russian émigrés, some of whom were veterans of the anti-communist White Army from the Russian Civil War (1917–23). The political platform of the ROA was formulated mainly by Vlasov and his associates, who were products of Soviet society, so the declared principles of the Vlasovites were anti-capitalism, right of the nations to self-determination and devotion to the ideals of the Russian Revolution of 1917, while they tried to avoid Nazi antisemitism and chauvinism and form a political movement independent of the Nazi control.

The ROA existed only in Nazi propaganda until November 1944, while the &quot;Osttruppen&quot; referred to as &quot;ROA&quot; by the Nazi propaganda served directly under German command and were not formalized as separate units, while the image of Vlasov was a mere propaganda weapon. On 14 November 1944, it was officially formed as the Armed Forces of the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia, with the KONR being formed as a political body to which the army pledged loyalty. On 28 January 1945, it was officially declared that the Russian divisions no longer form part of the German Army, but would directly be under the command of KONR, and Vlasov became the commander in chief of the ROA. In May 1945, the 1st division of the ROA, while being the only completed division of the existing three, switched sides and joined the anti-Nazi Prague uprising.

==Origins==
These volunteers (called &quot;Hiwi&quot;, a compression of &quot;Hilfswilliger&quot;, which can be translated as &quot;those willing to help&quot;) were not under any Russian command or control; they were exclusively under German command carrying out various non-combat duties. A number of them were employed at the Battle of Stalingrad, where it was estimated that as much as one quarter of the 6th Army&#x27;s strength was USSR citizens. Soon, several German commanders began to use them in small armed units for various tasks, including combat against Soviet partisans, driving vehicles, carrying wounded, and delivering supplies.

As a result, some Red Army soldiers surrendered or defected in hopes of joining an army that did not exist. Many Soviet prisoners of war volunteered to serve under German command just to get out of Nazi POW camps, which were notorious for starving Soviet prisoners to death.
Meanwhile, the newly captured Soviet general Vlasov, along with his German and Russian allies, was desperately lobbying the German high command, hoping that the green light would be given for the formation of a real armed force that would be exclusively under Russian control. They were able to win over only Alfred Rosenberg to some extent.

Although Hitler&#x27;s staff repeatedly refused to even consider the idea, Vlasov and his allies reasoned that Hitler would eventually come to realize the futility of a war against the USSR without winning over the Russian people, and respond to Vlasov&#x27;s demands.

Irrespective of the political wrangling over Vlasov and the status of the ROA, by mid-1943 several hundred thousand ex-Soviet volunteers were serving in the German forces, either as &quot;Hiwi&quot;s or in Eastern volunteer units (referred to as &quot;Osteinheiten&quot; (&quot;Eastern units&quot;) or &quot;landeseigene Verbände&quot;). These latter were generally deployed in a security role at the rear of the armies and army groups in the East, where they constituted a major part of the German effort to counter the activity of Soviet partisan forces, dating as far back as early 1942. The Germans were, however, always concerned about their reliability.

Following the German defeats in the summer of 1943 the units began to disintegrate. On 12 September for example, 2nd Army had to withdraw Sturm-Btl. AOK 2 in order to deal with what was described as &quot;several mutinies and desertions of Eastern units&quot;. A 14 September communication from the army states that in the recent period, &quot;Hiwi&quot; absenteeism had risen considerably. Following a series of attempted or successful mutinies, and a surge in desertions, the Germans decided in September 1943 that the reliability of the units had fallen to a level where they were more a liability than an asset. In an October 1943 report, the 8th Army concluded grimly: &quot;All local volunteers are unreliable during enemy contact. Principal reason of unreliability is the employment of these volunteers in the East.&quot; Two days previously, the German army had given permission to the KTB to take harsh measures in the event of further cases of rebellion or unreliability, investing regimental commanders with far-reaching powers to hold summary courts and execute the verdicts.

Since it was felt that the reliability of Russian volunteers would improve if they were removed from contact with the local population, it was decided to send them to the Western Front, and the majority of them were re-deployed in late 1943 or early 1944.

Many of these battalions were integrated into the divisions in the West. A number of the Russian soldiers were on guard in Normandy on D-Day but, without the equipment or motivation to fight the Allies, most promptly surrendered.

A total of 71 &quot;Eastern&quot; battalions served on the Eastern Front, while 42 battalions served in Belgium, Finland, France, and Italy.

The Russian Liberation Army Air Arm was disbanded in July 1944 before seeing combat. 

== Ideology and program ==

Ideologically, the Vlasov movement had a rather undefined ideology beyond hatred for the USSR and Russian nationalism - it was split between NTS, as its ideologues surrounded Vlasov with the support of the Nazis, and the other POWs which held to social democratic views. Robert Conquest wrote that Vlasov&#x27;s &quot;program shows that he was entirely out of sympathy with Nazism, and only concerned with a democratic Russia.&quot; Other authors note that anti-communist literature on Vlasov &quot;glosses over documented Nazi sympathies and crimes of ROA soldiers&quot;. Julia Shapiro also highlights that &quot;Vlasov could have avoided working with the Germans: in Soviet interrogation transcripts, Vlasov and fellow collaborators recall meeting several highranking Red Army captives who faced no punishment for refusing to cooperate.&quot; Benjamin Tromly writes that &quot;Vlasovite-run press organs and camps to train Russian propagandists praised National Socialism and spread Nazi anti-Semitic propaganda&quot;, and the &quot;democratic veneer&quot; seen in the declarations of ROA was only made in attempt to make the movement palatable to the Western powers.
Some of Vlasov&#x27;s close associates like described themselves as &quot;Marxists&quot;, Zykov was also described as a Bukharinist. Despite being captured by the Nazi secret police and killed, ostensibly for his Jewish origins and for his views, before the formation of the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia and the creation of its Manifesto, the political organization of the Vlasovites, Zykov was a major ideologue of the Vlasov army and participated in writing of the other Vlasovite program documents. The Vlasovites opposed their programs, the Smolensk Declaration, Vlasov&#x27;s open letter &quot;Why I Decided to Fight against Bolshevism&quot;, the Prague Manifesto of the KONR and &quot;Bloknot Propagandista&quot; (an important document which was written by rather minor members of the KONR as open for discussion and was not recognized as an official program), both to the Western capitalism and Stalinism, which was called by the word &quot;Bolshevism&quot; and described in the Manifesto not as socialism, but as &quot;state capitalism&quot;, and proclaimed their devotion to &quot;completing the Revolution&quot; of 1917 without distinguishing the February Revolution and the October Revolution, and to ideals of either a &quot;Russia without Bolsheviks and Capitalists&quot; (Smolensk Declaration and the open letter), or a welfare state (&quot;Bloknot Propagandista&quot;); the influence of the NTS on the Manifesto is seen in the description of the future system of Russia as a &quot;national-labour&quot; system, some of Vlasov&#x27;s chief commanders joined the NTS. 

All of these documents claimed the basic democratic freedoms and rights, including the right of the nations to self-determination and did not contain antisemitic remarks and invectives; &quot;Bloknot Propagandista&quot; also contained an attempt in critique of Marxism and denied both internationalism and national chauvinism. However, antisemitic remarks were made in one of the speeches of Vasily Malyshkin and in and in Georgi Zhilenkov&#x27;s interview to the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot;; Vlasov was critical of such remarks and replied to the Nazi concerns that &quot;the Jewish question&quot; &quot;was an internal Russian problem and would be dealt with after they [the ROA] had accomplished the primary aim of overthrowing the existing regime&quot;; however, antisemitism frequently appeared in the pro-Vlasov Nazi and collaborationist newspapers, including the ones edited by Zykov, often in form of articles reprinted from the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; with the citation of the source. The program documents were also written as a compromise with Nazism to various extents: the Smolensk declaration included some pro-Nazi points (&quot;Germany was not fighting the war against the Russian people and their homeland but merely against Bolshevism&quot;), and the Manifesto included a number of criticisms of the Western Allies as a compromise with Himmler&#x27;s insistence to add antisemitic points.

The Nazis were suspicious of Vlasov, his organisation and his ideological position, and the Gestapo warned about the possibility of the Vlasovites betraying the Reich. The suspicions and criticism of the Vlasovites from the Reich officials was summarised in a document by the Ministry of Propaganda official Eberhard Taubert who described his concerns about the movement being &quot;not National Socialist&quot;: &quot;It is significant that it does not fight Jewry, that the Jewish Question is not recognized as such at all&quot;; instead it presented &quot;a watered-down infusion of liberal and Bolshevik ideologies&quot;, and Taubert described the concern with &quot;strong Anglophile sympathies&quot; and it &quot;toying with the idea of a possible change of course&quot; while not &quot;feel[ing] bound to Germany&quot;.

==Formation==


The ROA did not officially exist until autumn of 1944, after Heinrich Himmler persuaded a very reluctant Hitler to permit the formation of 10 Russian Liberation Army divisions.

On 14 November in Prague, Vlasov read aloud the Prague Manifesto before the newly created Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia. This document stated the purposes of the battle against Stalin, and spelled out 14 points which the army was fighting for. German insistence that the document carry anti-Semitic rhetoric was successfully parried by Vlasov&#x27;s committee, but they were obliged to include a statement criticising the Western Allies, labelling them &quot;plutocracies&quot; that were &quot;allies of Stalin in his conquest of Europe&quot;.

By February 1945, only one division, the 1st Infantry (600th Infantry), was fully organised, under the command of General Sergei Bunyachenko. Formed at Münsingen, it fought briefly on the Oder Front before switching sides and helping the Czechs liberate Prague.

A second division, the 2nd Infantry (650th Infantry), was incomplete when it left Lager Heuberg but was sent into action under the command of General Mikhail Meandrov. This division was joined in large numbers by eastern workers, which caused it to nearly double in size as it marched south. A third, the 3rd Infantry (700th German Infantry), had only begun formation.

Several other Russian units, such as the Russian Corps, XVth SS Cossack Cavalry Corps of General Helmuth von Pannwitz, the Cossack Camp of Ataman Domanov, and other primarily White émigré formations, had agreed to become a part of Vlasov&#x27;s army. However, their membership remained &quot;de jure&quot; as the turn of events did not permit Vlasov to use the troops in any operation (even reliable communications were often impossible).

A small group of ROA volunteers fought against the Red Army on 9 February 1945. Their fighting spirit earned them the praise of Heinrich Himmler. The only active combat the Russian Liberation Army undertook against the Red Army was by the Oder River on 11 April 1945, largely at the insistence of Himmler, as a test of the army&#x27;s reliability. After three days, the outnumbered 1st Division had to retreat.

On 28 January 1945, it was officially declared that the Russian divisions no longer formed part of the German Army, but would be directly under the command of KONR.

Vlasov then ordered the first division to march south to concentrate all Russian anti-communist forces loyal to him. As an army, he reasoned, they could all surrender to the Western Allies on &quot;favorable&quot; terms, which particularly meant no repatriation to the Soviet Union. Vlasov sent several secret delegations to the Western Allies to begin negotiating a surrender, hoping they would sympathise with the goals of ROA and potentially use it in an inevitable future war with the USSR.

==Fight against the Germans and capture by the Soviets==

During the march south, the first division of the ROA came to the help of the Czech partisans in the Prague uprising against the German occupation, which started on May 5, 1945. Vlasov was initially reluctant to agree to that move, but ultimately did not resist General Bunyachenko&#x27;s decision to fight against the Germans.

The first division engaged in battle with &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; units that had been sent to level the city. The ROA units, armed with heavy weaponry, fended off the relentless SS assault, and together with the Czech insurgents succeeded in preserving most of Prague from destruction. Due to the predominance of communists in the new Czech &quot;Rada&quot; (&quot;council&quot;), the first division had to leave the city the very next day and tried to surrender to US Third Army of General Patton. The Western Allies, however, were not interested in aiding or sheltering the ROA, fearing such aid would harm relations with the USSR.

More than a thousand soldiers were initially taken into Allied custody by the 44th Infantry Division and other U.S. troops. In a move that Allied command kept secret for many years, they were then forcefully handed over to the Soviets by the Western Allies, due to a previous agreement between Churchill and Stalin that all ROA soldiers would be returned to the USSR. Some Allied officers who were sympathetic to the ROA soldiers permitted them to escape in small groups into the American-controlled zones.

The Soviet government labelled all ROA soldiers (&quot;vlasovtsy&quot;) as traitors, and those who were repatriated were tried and sentenced to detention in prison camps. Vlasov and several other leaders of the ROA were tried and hanged in Moscow on August 1, 1946.

== Order of battle ==
The composition of the &quot;VS-KONR&quot; was as follows:

Air elements
:I. &quot;Ostfliegerstaffel (russische)&quot; (1st Eastern Squadron-Russian) (1943–1944)
:II. &quot;Störkampfstaffel&quot; (Night Harassment Squadron) 8 (1945)
:KONR Air Force

Two ace pilots of the Soviet Air Force, Semyon Trofimovich Bychkov and , defected and became part of the ROA air force, which was commanded by Major General . The air force was disbanded in July 1944.

<doc id="394676" wikidata="Q7744447" url="?curid=394676" title="The King's English">
<text>The King&#x27;s English is a book on English usage and grammar. It was written by the brothers Henry Watson Fowler and Francis George Fowler and published in 1906; it thus predates by twenty years &quot;Modern English Usage&quot;, which was written by Henry alone after Francis&#x27;s death in 1918.

&quot;The King&#x27;s English&quot; is less like a dictionary than &quot;Modern English Usage&quot;: it consists of longer articles on more general topics, such as vocabulary, syntax, and punctuation and draws heavily on examples from many sources throughout. One of its sections is a systematic description of the appropriate uses of &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;will&quot;. The third and last edition was published in 1931, by which time &quot;Modern English Usage&quot; had superseded it in popularity.

Because all living languages continually evolve, the book is now considered outdated in some respects, and some of the Fowlers&#x27; opinions about correct English usage are at times seen as antiquated (yet not incorrect) with regard to contemporary standards. For example, the Fowlers disapprove of the word &quot;concision&quot; on the grounds that it had a technical meaning in theology, &quot;to which it may well be left&quot;; but &quot;concision&quot; is now a common synonym for &quot;conciseness&quot;. The Fowlers also criticised the use of &quot;standpoint&quot; and &quot;just how much&quot; (as in &quot;Just how much more of this can we take?&quot;), describing them as undesirable &quot;Americanisms&quot;, but both are now common in British English. The book nevertheless remains a benchmark for usage and is still in print.

<text>Ildefons Cerdà Sunyer (; ; 23 December 1815, Centelles (Catalonia) – 21 August 1876, Caldas de Besaya (Cantabria)) was a Spanish urban planner and civil engineer who designed the 19th-century &quot;extension&quot; of Barcelona called the &quot;Eixample&quot;. Because of his extensive theoretical and practical work, he is considered the founder of modern town planning as a discipline, having coined the word &quot;urbanization&quot;. 

==Biography==

Cerdà was born in Centelles, Catalonia, Spain, in 1815. He trained as a civil engineer at the &quot;&quot;, in Madrid. He joined the Corps of Engineers and lived in various cities in Spain before settling in Barcelona in 1848 and marrying Clotilde Bosch. After the death of his brothers, Cerdà inherited the family fortune, and left the civil service. He became interested in politics and the study of urban planning.

When the government of the time finally gave in to public pressure and allowed Barcelona&#x27;s city walls to be torn down, he realized the need to plan the city&#x27;s expansion so that the new extension would become an efficient and livable place, unlike the congested, epidemic-prone old town within the walls. When he failed to find suitable reference works, he undertook the task of writing one from scratch while designing what he called the &quot;Ensanche&quot; or &quot;Eixample&quot;, borrowing a few technological ideas from his contemporaries to create a unique, thoroughly modern integrated concept that was carefully considered rather than whimsically designed.

He continued to create projects and improve existing designs throughout his lifetime, as well as to develop his theories taking on larger planning scopes (at the regional planning level), until the very end. In the process, he lost all his family&#x27;s inheritance and he died in 1876 a heavily indebted near-pauper, never having been paid for his chief masterpiece, the design of Barcelona&#x27;s &quot;Eixample&quot;.

==Achievements==
Cerdà was a multi-faceted man who, in pursuit of his vision, gave up a steady job in the civil engineering service, stood for election and became a member of the &quot;Cortes&quot; (the Spanish Parliament); drafted useful ground-breaking legislation, drew up a detailed topographical survey map of Barcelona&#x27;s surroundings, and wrote a theoretical treatise to support each of his major planning projects. He actually coined a number of important words in Spanish, including &quot;urbanización&quot;.

==Approach==

Cerdà focused on key needs: chiefly, the need for sunlight, natural lighting and ventilation in homes (he was heavily influenced by the sanitarian movement), the need for greenery in people&#x27;s surroundings, the need for effective waste disposal including good sewerage, and the need for seamless movement of people, goods, energy, and information.

His designs belie a network-oriented approach far ahead of his time. His street layout and grid plan were optimized to accommodate pedestrians, carriages, horse-drawn trams, urban railway lines (as yet unheard-of), gas supply and large-capacity sewers to prevent frequent floods, without neglecting public and private gardens and other key amenities. The latest technical innovations were incorporated in his designs if they could further the cause of better integration, but he also came up with remarkable new concepts of his own, including a logical system of land readjustment that was essential to the success of his project, and produced a thorough statistical analysis of working-class conditions at the time, which he undertook in order to demonstrate the ills of congestion.

==Controversy==
Cerdà&#x27;s plan for Barcelona underwent two major revisions; the second version, approved by the Spanish government at the time, is the one still recognizable in the layout of today&#x27;s &quot;Eixample&quot;, though the low height of buildings and the gardens within every city block were soon dispensed with by politicians inclined toward property speculation. In addition, only one of the two planned diagonal streets was realized. Culturally, the &quot;Eixample&quot; was (and still is) inhabited by the well-to-do, instead of integrating social classes.
Many of the Catalan architects of his time opposed Cerdà&#x27;s ideas, even accusing him of promoting socialism; in the end, however, they designed the Modernista façades that brought fame to the district.

Political developments in Spain and Catalonia eventually led to the enshrinement of a revisionist version of how Cerdà secured official approval of his plan. Cerdà actually drew up his plan under the commission of the then competent authority, the Spanish central government, with the support of the city council. A political reversal led to a change in local government, and the new council sought to preempt the previous central government&#x27;s decision by holding a project competition in 1859, which Cerdà lost; nevertheless, Cerdà&#x27;s design prevailed, much to the chagrin of the major property owners. 

==Major works==

<text>Ashendon is a small village and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England. It is about nine miles west of Aylesbury and seven miles north of Thame.

The toponym is derived from the Old English for &quot;Hill overgrown with ash trees&quot;. The Domesday Book of 1086 records the village as the property of the Grenville family; it was called &quot;Assedune&quot;. The original name refers to the fact that in Saxon times this area was forested, serving as hunting land for the king.

In recent times the manor of Ashendon passed into the hands of the Marquis of Buckingham.

Included in with the parish of Ashendon are the hamlets of Upper Pollicott and Lower Pollicott. The names of these hamlets derive from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Pol&#x27;s Cottage&quot;.

In the less distant past, Ashendon was an entirely farming village and, at present, there is still much agricultural activity within the village. However, some of the farmhouses have been converted into private residences, the best example of this being Ashendon Farm and its barns. Although Ashendon is a small village, in comparison with many nearby Buckinghamshire villages, it has a pub, a recreational playing field, a church and a thriving social club.

One mile south-west of the village, near Lower Pollicott, on the Chiltern Main Line between and , is the site of the former Ashendon Junction, which was an elaborate flying junction engineered for a high-speed turnout on to the now-dismantled link to the now disused Great Central Main Line at Grendon Underwood Junction. In former times this route was used by express trains between London Marylebone, Leicester and Sheffield.

<doc id="394684" wikidata="Q680341" url="?curid=394684" title="Mintaka">
<text>Mintaka , designation Delta Orionis (δ Orionis, abbreviated Delta Ori, δ Ori) and 34 Orionis (34 Ori), is a multiple star system some 1,200 light-years from the Sun in the constellation of Orion. Together with Alnitak (Zeta Orionis) and Alnilam (Epsilon Orionis), the three stars form Orion&#x27;s Belt, known by many names among ancient cultures. The star is located very close to the celestial equator. When Orion is near the meridian, Mintaka is the rightmost of the Belt&#x27;s stars when viewed from the Northern Hemisphere facing south.

== Nomenclature ==

&quot;Delta Orionis&quot; is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation, &quot;34 Orionis&quot; its Flamsteed designation. The name &quot;Mintaka&quot; itself is derived from an Arabic term for &#x27;belt&#x27;: منطقة or &quot;manṭaqa&quot;. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN, which included &quot;Mintaka&quot; for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

== Observational history ==

Mintaka is the westernmost of the three stars of Orion&#x27;s belt. It is easily visible to the naked eye, one of the brightest stars in the sky, and has been known since antiquity.

Radial velocity measurements taken by Henri-Alexandre Deslandres in 1900 at Paris Observatory showed that Mintaka had a variable radial velocity and therefore was a spectroscopic binary. His preliminary orbital period estimate of 1.92 days was shown to be incorrect in 1904 when Johannes Franz Hartmann using photographic plates taken at Potsdam Observatory showed that the orbital period was 5.7 days. Hartmann also noticed that the calcium K line at 393.4 nanometres in the stellar spectrum did not share in the periodic displacements of the lines due to orbital motion of the star and theorized that there was a cloud in the line of sight to Mintaka that contained calcium. This was the first detection of the interstellar medium.

==System==
δ Orionis is a multiple star system. There is a magnitude 7 star about 52 arcseconds away from the second-magnitude primary and a much fainter star in between. The system is designated WDS 05320-0018 in the Washington Double Star Catalog, with the 14th-magnitude companion listed as component B and the seventh-magnitude star as component C.
The primary component is itself a triple system: a class-O9.5 bright giant and a class-B main-sequence star orbit every 5.73 days and exhibit shallow eclipses when the star dims about 0.2 of a magnitude, and a B-class subgiant is resolved 0.26&quot; away. At the primary eclipse, the apparent magnitude (of the whole system) drops from 2.23 to 2.35, while it only drops to 2.29 at the secondary eclipse.

The outer star of the triple system orbits the inner pair once every . The orbit is quite eccentric, with the separation varying between and .

The seventh-magnitude companion, HD 36485, is a chemically peculiar B-type main-sequence star and itself a spectroscopic binary with a faint A-type companion in a 30-day orbit. It has an unusual spectrum with H-alpha emission and unusually strong helium absorption lines. It has a strong magnetic field and a very slow rotational velocity that produces chemical stratification in its atmosphere, which leads to the unusual abundances seen in the spectrum.

The 14th-magnitude companion is thought to be around the same distance and is a somewhat cooler and less luminous star than the Sun.

Mintaka is surrounded by a cluster of faint stars, possibly part of the cluster surrounding σ Ori.

==Distance==
The distance derived from the &quot;Hipparcos&quot; satellite parallax is , while spectroscopic distances, comparisons to similar stars, and cluster membership all suggest a value more than double that. This type of unreconcilable discrepancy is not unique to Mintaka and the reasons for it have yet to be clarified. In Gaia Data Release 3, component C is listed with a parallax of , consistent with the distances derived by other methods but disagreeing with the &quot;Hipparcos&quot;-derived value for the primary.

The Gaia DR3 parallax for component B is , strongly suggesting it is considerably closer than the other members of the system and merely a chance alignment. At that distance it is likely to be a K-type main sequence star.

==Etymology and cultural significance==
Mintaka was seen by astrologers as a portent of good fortune.

===Orion&#x27;s Belt===
The three belt stars were collectively known by many names in many cultures. Arabic terms include &quot;Al Nijād&quot; &#x27;the Belt&#x27;, &quot;Al Nasak&quot; &#x27;the Line&#x27;, &quot;Al Alkāt&quot; &#x27;the Golden Grains or Nuts&#x27;, and, in modern Arabic, &quot;Al Mīzān al Ḥakk&quot; &#x27;the Accurate Scale Beam&#x27;. In Chinese mythology, they were also known as the Weighing Beam.

In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;Three Stars (asterism)&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting of Mintaka, Alnilam, and Alnitak (Orion&#x27;s Belt), with Betelgeuse, Bellatrix, Saiph and Rigel later added. Consequently, the Chinese name for Mintaka is (, ). It is one of the western mansions of the White Tiger.
==Namesakes==
The USS &quot;Mintaka&quot; (AK-94) was a United States Navy &quot;Crater&quot;-class cargo ship named after the star.

<text>Cornelis Maartenszoon Tromp, &quot;Count of Sølvesborg&quot; (3 September 1629 – 29 May 1691) was a Dutch naval officer who served as lieutenant-admiral general in the Dutch Navy, and briefly as a general admiral in the Royal Danish-Norwegian Navy. Tromp is one of the most celebrated and controversial figures in Dutch naval history due to his actions in the Anglo-Dutch Wars and the Scanian War. His father was the renowned Lieutenant Admiral Maarten Tromp.

==Early life==
Cornelis Maartenszoon Tromp was born on 9 September 1629, in Rotterdam, in the historically dominant county of Holland. He was the second son of Maarten Tromp and Dina Cornelisdochter de Haas. His name Maartenszoon, sometimes abbreviated to Maartensz, is a patronymic. He had two full brothers, Harper and Johan.

In 1633, when he was only four years old, his mother died. His father remarried in 1634, and again in 1640. The two marriages brought Tromp four half brothers and five half sisters. His father had made career as an officer for the Admiralty of the Maze. After a conflict with Lieutenant Admiral Philips van Dorp in 1634, Maarten Tromp left the fleet starting to work as a deacon. After Van Dorp was removed from his position in 1637, his father became lieutenant admiral and supreme commander of the Dutch Navy.
In 1642, Tromp was sent to Harfleur, France, to learn to speak French from a Calvinist preacher.

==Early navy career==

On 1 September 1643, he joined his father on his flagship the &quot;Aemilia&quot;. In September 1645, he was appointed as lieutenant and commanded a small squadron charged to pursue the Barbary pirates. On 22 August 1649, he was made a full captain. He served in the First Anglo-Dutch War, fighting in the battle of Leghorn, but was not given command of the Mediterranean fleet after the death of Johan van Galen, only being promoted to rear admiral with the Admiralty of de Maze on 11 November 1653, after the death of his beloved father, Maarten.

In 1656, he participated in the relief of Gdańsk. In 1658, it was discovered he had used his ships to trade in luxury goods; as a result he was fined and not allowed to have an active command until 1662. Just before the Second Anglo-Dutch War, he was promoted to vice admiral on 29 January 1665; at the battle of Lowestoft, he prevented total catastrophe by taking over fleet command to allow the escape of the larger part of the fleet.

==Lieutenant admiral==

Gaining sudden popularity, he was temporarily given supreme command as lieutenant admiral of the confederate fleet on 23 July 1665, but had to give up this function (but not rank) the next month in favour of Lieutenant Admiral Michiel de Ruyter; he fought, having been transferred to the Admiralty of Amsterdam on 6 February 1666, under the latter in the Four Days Battle and the St. James&#x27;s Day Battle.

As this failure off Nieuwpoort in August 1666 was imputed to him by De Ruyter, he was dismissed, at the same time, being under the suspicion of plotting to overthrow the government, but he was reinstated in April 1673 by William of Orange, after the Orangists seized power, to fight against the French and English navies in the Third Anglo-Dutch War. There he participated in the last three fleet actions under Lieutenant-Admiral-General Michiel de Ruyter, distinguishing himself in the double battle of Schooneveld and the battle of Texel in August 1673, fighting out an epic duel with his personal enemy Edward Spragge, who drowned. During this war, his flagship was the &quot;Gouden Leeuw,&quot; of 82 cannons.

In 1674 a Dutch fleet under Tromp operated along the French coast. He directed a landing on 27 June on the island of Belle Île, on the coast of Brittany, and captured its coastal bulwarks. The Dutch however left the island again after 2 days, because the 3,000 French defenders had taken refuge in the island&#x27;s strong fortress and a siege would have taken too long. A few days later, on 4 July, the island of Noirmoutier was attacked. After a short struggle, which left more than a hundred Dutch men out of action, the French retreated to Poitou, leaving the island, with its castle, coastal batteries, more than 30 pieces of artillery and several ships, in the hands of the Dutch. For nearly three weeks, the Dutch flag flew from the walls of the French stronghold and the Dutch fleet captured many French ships in the meantime. The whole region from Brest to Bayonne was in turmoil, and several strong French forces gathered there to prevent the Dutch from landing. On 23 July the island of Noirmoutier was however abandoned after the Dutch blew up the castle and demolished the coastal batteries. The French coast was kept in fear for some time, but after visiting the Mediterranean Sea, Tromp&#x27;s fleet returned to Holland at the end of 1674.

He was closely involved in the murder of Johan de Witt and Cornelis de Witt in 1672. In 1675, he visited England and was created an English baronet and a Dutch erfridder by Charles II of England, but he refused an honorary doctorate when visiting Oxford.
==Danish-Norwegian Navy and Scanian War==
On 8 May 1676, he became admiral general of the Danish-Norwegian Navy and Knight in the Order of the Elephant; in 1677, Count of Sølvesborg – then a Danish nobility title. During the Scanian War he defeated the Swedish navy in the Battle of Öland. Tromp led the successful Landing at Ystad in Scania in June 1677, where there was a minor but still notable fighting before the Swedes withdrew and left the city in Danish hands. Tromp summoned all the local noblemen of Danish origin to his presence in order to promise they would stay still on their estates and not cause any trouble. He then took a two-week holiday at Baron Jörgen Krabbe&#x27;s Castle Krogholm (now Krageholm), just north of Aletophilus (Olluf Rosencrantz?) Ystad. During this period Tromp also licensed the local Danish bailiffs to recruit as many males as possible for the local Danish militias and sheriffs&#x27; teams. Tromp is mentioned in the local court registers for having licensed a Sheriff by the name of Bendix Clausen to recruit men in six different districts (hundreds) and there was some fierce fighting between these troops and the Swedes. Clausen and his men were branded as criminal &#x27;snapphanar&#x27; by the Swedes. For that reason Tromp also played a role for the snapphanar, who were in essence the local resistance and Danish para-military troops.

==Lieutenant-admiral general==
On 6 February 1679, he became lieutenant-admiral general of the Republic but never fought in that capacity, having become a liability to the new regime of William III. He died in Amsterdam in 1691, his mind broken by alcohol abuse and remorse, still officially commander of the Dutch fleet, after having been for a period replaced by Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest.

== Character ==

Tromp was a very aggressive squadron commander who personally relished the fight, preferring the direct attack having the weather gage over line-of-battle tactics. As a result, he had to change ships often: four times at the Four Days&#x27; Battle, three times at Schooneveld and two times at Texel. He was popular with his crews, despite the danger he put them in, because of his easy-going manners and his supporting the cause of the House of Orange against the States regime of Johan de Witt. However, he often treated his fellow officers with contempt, both his equals and superiors.

Tromp is infamous for his insubordination, although the two examples most often mentioned in this context, not following De Ruyter on the second day of the Four Days&#x27; Battle and chasing the English rear in the St James&#x27;s Day Fight, seem to have been honest mistakes. He was very jealous of De Ruyter but generally treated him with respect, though he considered him too common. Tromp tried to imitate the lifestyle of the nobility, marrying a rich elderly widow, Margaretha van Raephorst, in 1667. He had no children. At home, without fighting to distract him, Cornelis, or Kees as he was normally called, grew quickly bored and indolent. He had the reputation of being a heavy drinker, so much so that many inns at the time were named after him.

Tromp was a vain man, having an extremely high opinion of himself, which he never hesitated in sharing with others. He felt that, son of a famous father, he had a natural right to the position of naval hero. During his life he posed as a sitter for at least 22 paintings, a record for the 17th century, many by top artists such as Ferdinand Bol. His art possessions were displayed in his estate, that long after his death was called &#x27;Trompenburgh&#x27;, the manor house built in the form of a warship.

As his wider family was among the most fanatical supporters of Orange, he participated in most of their schemes, especially those of his brother-in-law Johan Kievit, a shrewd and unscrupulous intriguer. Tromp however had no great enthusiasm for subtle plotting; later in life he came to regret many of his actions. He died in great mental anguish, convinced he would go to hell as punishment for his crimes.

== Legacy ==
The Dutch Ministry of Defence names Maarten Tromp and Cornelis Tromp as naval heroes. Since 1777, nine navy ships have been named &quot;Tromp&quot; in honour of them, most recently the frigate .

<text>Ashley Green is a village and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England. The parish is on the boundary with Hertfordshire, midway between Chesham and Berkhamsted.

Originally a hamlet within Chesham parish, its toponym is derived from the Old English for &quot;Ash Field&quot;, referring to the forest that once covered this part of the Chiltern Hills.

==Churches==
Ashley Green used to have a Baptist church, situated down Hog Lane, which was a branch of Broadway Baptist Church in Chesham. It closed in the early 1900s.

Anglican services started in the village school in 1872, led by Rev Pratt, vicar of St Mary&#x27;s Chesham. Land for an Anglican church was given by Lord Chesham. The architect was G.E. Street and the contractor G. Cooper of Aylesbury Buckinghamshire. The total cost of the building was over £2,000 with the endowment being a further £6,000. The Church was built and endowed by the gift of Elizabeth Dorrien of Clifton, Bristol, in memory of her sisters and dedicated to John the Evangelist on 31 December 1873, although it was already in use when it was dedicated. Ashley Green became a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1876. Newspapers and coins were built into the pillar adjoining the pulpit. In 1980 the parish rejoined Chesham parish under a team ministry.

The Church is built of local knapped black flints with Bath stone dressings. There is a bellcote with two bells. There is a boiler house, and the church was originally being heated by &quot;Hayden&#x27;s hot air apparatus&quot;, now disused. The porch is on the Northern side of the building the front of which is an oak moulded archway, the timber being framed in red bricks - herringboned. The roof is of plain clay tiles. St. John&#x27;s has stained glass windows from various makers including Burlison and Grylls, Kempe and Co., James Powell and Sons, C.E. Moore and A.L. Moore.

Some of St. Johns&#x27; pews used to have a note on them that stated:
The seats in this Church are entirely free and unappropriated. The Church Wardens look to the Congregation for the support through the offertory of the usual Church expenses.

The bellcote has two bells, one of a diameter of and the other of a diameter of . John Taylor &amp; Co of Loughborough cast them in 1874 and refurbished and re-hung in the early 1990s.

In 2010 a kitchen and toilet was installed in the Church. In keeping with the tradition of the original builders, a time capsule that included a newspaper and a photograph of the congregation was buried under the floor of the kitchen.

==Population==
Today Ashley Green is a popular home for commuters and executives who commute daily to London. There are also many local residents who have lived and raised children who also continue to live in the village along with several farms surrounding the area.

==Local business==
Ashley Green has one public house, &quot;The Golden Eagle&quot;, referred to locally as &quot;The Eagle&quot;. On the junction of Chesham Road and Hog Lane the corner house used to be a shop and post office. An old post box still remains built into one of the entrance posts.
There is a &quot;farm shop&quot; at John&#x27;s Lane farm and the Chesham side of the village has a farm selling free range eggs.

==Community facilities==
The old school is used by a playgroup youth club and for ballet classes. The village hall also hosts regular events such as the village fete and for rehearsals by local actors who put on productions around the local area. Behind the village hall in The Glebe there is a play park. There is a well on the village green outside the entrance gates to the old school.

==Media==
Ashley Village School was the subject of a documentary film (Village School 1940) directed by John Eldridge. The film is a tribute to Britain&#x27;s women teachers in wartime.

The film &#x27;starred&#x27; Mrs. James the headmistress of the school and Mrs. Glover the other teacher at the school. Many of the pupils are shown taking part in school activities both indoors and outdoors. Some of the pupils were evacuees.

<text>A neighborhood watch or neighbourhood watch (see spelling differences), also called a crime watch or neighbourhood crime watch, is an organized group of civilians devoted to crime and vandalism prevention within a neighborhood.

The aim of neighborhood watch includes educating residents of a community on security and safety and achieving safe and secure neighborhoods. However, when a criminal activity is suspected, members are encouraged to report to authorities, and not to intervene.

==Organization==

A neighborhood watch may be organized as its own group or may simply be a function of a neighborhood association or other community association.

While not all neighborhood watch groups are vigilantes, some are and use vigilante practices in order for them to handle crime in their neighborhoods. In the United States, neighborhood watch groups increased in popularity throughout the 1980s and 1990s in part as a response to the perceived ineffectiveness of new policing strategies. 

Other programs similar to Neighborhood Watch include Operation Identification, a citizen&#x27;s burglary prevention program for use in homes and businesses that was developed in the United States during the 1960s.

== History ==
===Australia===
The Neighbourhood Watch Australasia (NHWA) program was first introduced in New South Wales in 1984. The logo with the four faces was designed by a Victorian volunteer community commission in 1983, where it has since become the nationally acknowledged brand of NHW. The first NHWA Journal was published in October 2006, where it contained information on crime prevention instructions and events from each of the NHWA regions. In 2007 NHWA was listed as an incorporated association. In 2010 NHWA featured its own online website and in 2011 it established its Facebook page.

In 2014, several Neighbourhood Watch groups in the Gold Coast faced a lack of interest from the community. Throughout the 2000s, Broadbeach had 22 groups that were surveilling the streets in Mermaid Waters. In 2014, however, only three people attended the committees due to disinterest.

Run by members of the community, the NSW Police supports and assists the NHW program. The program is not for profit and it is not funded by the NSW Police Force, or any other government organisations. It is rather assisted through fundraising, sponsorships and grants. Members of the community are encouraged to participate within the program and membership is free of charge. Participators act as a conduit between NSW Police and their local area by encouraging crime prevention and closer community relations. Diversity is reflected in the NHW program and is encouraged.

=== United States ===

The current American system of neighborhood watches began developing in the late 1960s as a response to the rape and murder of Kitty Genovese in Queens, New York. People became outraged after false reports that a dozen witnesses did nothing to save Genovese or to apprehend her killer. Inspired in part by Jane Jacobs&#x27; &quot;The Death and Life of Great American Cities&quot; (1961), which stated that Americans need to keep their &quot;eyes on the streets&quot; and connect with each other in their neighborhoods, national law enforcement agencies began pushing for community members to get more involved with reporting crimes at the local level.

Some local civilians formed groups to watch over their neighborhoods and to look out for any suspicious activity in their areas. Shortly thereafter, the National Sheriffs&#x27; Association began a concerted effort in 1972 to revitalize the &quot;watch group&quot; effort nationwide. During the first few years of the program, neighborhood watch functioned primarily as an intermediary between local law enforcement agencies and neighborhoods, to pass along information about burglaries and thefts in specific neighborhoods. Soon thereafter, the neighborhood watch became more involved and partnered with law enforcement agencies to report other types of crime as well.

=== Kazakhstan ===
In August 2011, police and municipal authorities in Petropavl city, the administrative center of the North Kazakhstan province, introduced the concept of a &quot;neighborhood watch&quot;. Having studied Estonia&#x27;s neighborhood watch model, police chief of this province set up a special office consisting of a 24-hour telephone hotline operated by civilians to respond to citizen complaints and anonymous tip offs. To support their work, the provincial authorities spent 15 million tenge that year to set up billboards and play television and radio ads encouraging citizens to report wrongdoing or anything suspicious to the police: &quot;the safety of your home, your family and friends is in your hands&quot;. By the end of 2012, this hotline had received 3,245 calls and in 2013, 2,797 calls. The police chiefs viewed this as a success. In 2013, the North Kazakhstan province police chief was transferred to lead the police department of the Almaty province and he launched the neighborhood watch program there by linking it explicitly to zero tolerance policing.

Some attempts to introduce the neighborhood watch program have been made in the cities of Taraz (2016), Aqtau (2017) and Qyzylorda (2020) but they produced little success and have been largely ignored in other parts of the country.

=== Germany ===
*Bavaria has created a system of citizen patrols (in german: Sicherheitswacht) where unarmed teams of two volunteers patrol assigned areas to improve security. These teams have a radio to call for help if needed and a black and white armband with letters identifying them as a neighborhood watch patrol.
*The citizens in Baden-Württemberg can take part in the Police Volunteer Programme, where approximately 1,200 citizens volunteer to assist the local police in 20 cities. These volunteers are specially trained, wear uniforms and are armed. Their main task is crime prevention: they carry out foot patrols to deter street crime, near schools and kindergartens and maintain contact with potential victims of common crime and juvenile delinquency.
*The citizens in Hesse can also participate in a Police Volunteer Program, where some citizens have voluntarily helped the local police. The volunteers are trained for 50 hours, receive a blue uniform, pepper spray and a mobile phone. Their main task is crime prevention: conducting foot patrols to deter street crime, patrolling near schools and kindergartens and maintaining contact with potential victims of common crime and juvenile delinquency. People can also join the security police (in german: Wachpolizei) which have fewer powers and pay less than the regular police to perform basic tasks such as traffic police or guard duties, freeing up the police officers from regular work.

== Controversies ==
===United States ===
The neighborhood watch system gained intense media attention after the February 2012 fatal shooting of teenager Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida by George Zimmerman, an appointed neighborhood watch coordinator. Zimmerman claimed self-defense and was tried for second-degree murder and manslaughter before he was acquitted from all charges. His actions on the night of the shooting generated controversy as he exited his vehicle and was carrying a firearm, both of which go against neighborhood watch recommendations. He has also been accused by prosecutors of racially profiling Martin, and he was investigated by the United States Department of Justice for possibly committing a racial hate crime. However, the FBI concluded their investigation and dropped its charges. Martin was black and Zimmerman is a mixed-race Hispanic.

In another incident involving a neighborhood watch, Eliyahu Werdesheim, part of an Orthodox Jewish community in Maryland, was convicted in May 2012 of second-degree assault and false imprisonment for beating and then pinning down a teenager he thought suspicious in 2010. Werdersheim and his brother, who had also been charged in the case but was acquitted, chose a bench trial, contending they would not get a fair trial due to the publicity over the Martin case. He was given a three-year suspended sentence and three years of probation at sentencing in June 2012. In December 2013, Werdesheim&#x27;s probation was cut short, and he was released at the end of the month.

A June 2012 &quot;New York Times&quot; article reported that neighborhood watches in the New York City area are growing again after decades of decrease due to lower crime rates. It also said that neighborhood watch groups fell under scrutiny since the shooting of Trayvon Martin.

In response to the Trayvon Martin case, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) began drafting a bill that would require neighborhood watch groups to be certified and limit their duties. Currently, with local police agencies setting guidelines for their neighborhood watches, groups across the U.S. vary greatly in their scope, function, the level of activity by their members, and training. Robert McCrie, professor of security management at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, disagrees with Lee&#x27;s initiative. He believes that standards for neighborhood watches &quot;are best left to the state or local community,&quot; although he would support background checks for volunteers.

<text>Asheridge (recorded Esserugge in the 13th century) is a small village in the parish of Chartridge, in Buckinghamshire, England. Prior to 1898 it was part of Chesham parish. It is situated in the Chiltern Hills, about two and a half miles north west of Chesham, 5 miles from Great Missenden and 6 miles from Wendover.

 Another suggestion is that the name derives from the Old English &quot;æsc&quot; and &quot;hrycg&quot;, and meant ‘long hill covered with ash trees.’

Asheridge Farmhouse is of 16th-century origin. In 1848 Asheridge is recorded as having a population of 129. A school and congregational church were established there during the latter part of the 19th century and records show they were still in existence in 1891. The Blue Ball public house which was at the centre of the settlement at that time is still in business today.

On 5 March 1945 an Avro Lancaster PB745 crashed in fields near Asheridge. The seven crew of the aircraft were drawn from the Royal Air Force and the Royal Australian Air Force. There was only one survivor, the rear gunner, William Hart. A memorial service and dedication of a plaque took place on 13 May 2012.

Aneurin (Nye) Bevan, Labour Minister responsible for the establishment of the National Health Service and his wife Jennie Lee, also a Minister in the same Labour Government and a key figure in the creation of the Open University, came to live at Asheridge Farm in 1954. After the death of her husband in 1960, Lee continued to live there until moving to London in 1968. She became Baroness Lee of Asheridge in 1970.

<text>Hollywood Science is an Open University TV programme produced for the BBC, which attempted to determine whether or not scenes in various films were scientifically credible. In the show, presenter Robert Llewellyn and scientist Jonathan Hare look at the science behind a scene in a film. They experiment or perform calculations, to see how the scene would work in real life. The scene is then given an accuracy rating. The approach is similar to that of the Bad Astronomer, who also uses films as a vehicle to teach science. The presence of Robert Llewellyn means the tone of the show is fairly light-hearted.

The show started in the BBC Learning Zone, a section of education programming broadcast in the early morning, meant to be recorded and watched later. It was then given a higher profile programming slot on BBC2 in the early evening. The programme is currently repeated on UKTV Documentary.

The series formed the basis of a Jonathan Hare lecture at Hull University in 2008.

== Episodes ==

=== Series 1 ===
The first series of six ten-minute episodes premiered in the Open University&#x27;s Learning Zone on BBC2 at 12:30 from 10 May 2001.

Each of these episodes concentrated on the science of a single film.
* Shanghai Noon
* Dante&#x27;s Peak
* Cool Hand Luke
* Ice Cold in Alex
* Die Hard
* Speed

=== Series 2 ===
The second series consisted of four half-hour episodes. 

&quot;Break-Ins&quot;
* The Score – If one fills a safe with water, will an explosion produce a more powerful door-busting effect?
* Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves – Could a medieval trebuchet fire Robin Hood and Will Scarlet into a castle, and land them on target?
* The Thomas Crown Affair – Would knocking out the air conditioning cause InfraRed cameras to become useless?

&quot;Gross Out&quot;
* Waterworld – Is it possible to sufficiently purify one&#x27;s own urine to be able to drink it? The team concluded that the film was portraying a reverse osmosis process with a realistic looking unit.
* Fight Club – Can high quality soap be made from liposuction fat? The team succeeded in making soap from pig fat, but it was not top quality soap.
* The Great Outdoors – Could someone eat a 96-ounce steak? The team concluded that this amount of meat would not fit in a human stomach, and thus gave it the &quot;least plausible&quot; award for the episode.

&quot;Tricky Situations&quot;
* Deep Blue Sea – Is it possible to be surrounded by electricity and water without being electrocuted?
* The Last Castle – How far can a water cannon fire a grappling iron?
* A View to a Kill – Can one survive underwater by breathing the air from a car tyre?

&quot;Escapes&quot;
* Chain Reaction – Could a hydrogen gas cylinder move a concrete slab? The team concluded it could, but probably not enough to allow escape and with a great risk of explosion.
* Escape from Alcatraz – Can one braze together a spoon and some nail clippers using a US dime, and some matches? After initial failure, the team concluded they needed a pre-1960s dime for its high silver content. Although they then succeeded in melting the dime, they failed to make a solid joint, largely due to the lack of flux. They also could not generate sufficient heat from matches, the heat source portrayed in the film.
* Hollow Man – Would you be able to move a metal bolt using a hand-made electromagnet? While this may be possible with good electromagnets, the team concluded the power source used in the film (a defibrillator) would be too feeble to do the job. This film was given the &quot;least plausible&quot; award of the episode.

<text>Askett is a picturesque hamlet in the civil parish of Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire, England. It is situated where the steep escarpment of the Chiltern Hills meets the flat expanse of the Vale of Aylesbury. It lies within an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and Conservation Area less than four miles from Chequers, country home of the UK prime minister.

One mile from the market town of Princes Risborough, Askett is served with The Three Crowns pub and an Indian restaurant, The Coco Tamarind. The nearby Monks Risborough railway station provides direct access to London Marylebone.

==History==
The Manor house at Askett sat on the site of Old Manor Close estate. At the beginning of the 20th century small cottages resided on the original land but by 1969 had been demolished and in 1983 five new houses were built. Opposite the entrance to the estate stood the wheelwrights shop where a modern bungalow now stands.

In the 19th Century, the small hamlet was a renowned village for lacemaking. By the 20th Century, villages like Askett and Kimble became the stopping point on the way to Aylesbury, Dillons Garage was a small well-known service station opened in Askett in 1933 which has since been demolished.

The village still holds many old fashioned cottages and bungalows. The area has more recently been described as &#x27;A Hamlet in a Meadow&#x27;.

<doc id="394710" wikidata="Q8018003" url="?curid=394710" title="Induced demand">
<text>In economics, induced demand – related to latent demand and generated demand – is the phenomenon whereby an increase in supply results in a decline in price and an increase in consumption. In other words, as a good or service becomes more readily available and mass produced, its price goes down and consumers are more likely to buy it, meaning that the quantity demanded subsequently increases. This is consistent with the economic model of supply and demand.

In transportation planning, induced demand, also called &quot;induced traffic&quot; or consumption of road capacity, has become important in the debate over the expansion of transportation systems, and is often used as an argument against increasing roadway traffic capacity as a cure for congestion. Induced traffic may be a contributing factor to urban sprawl. City planner Jeff Speck has called induced demand &quot;the great intellectual black hole in city planning, the one professional certainty that every thoughtful person seems to acknowledge, yet almost no one is willing to act upon.&quot;

The inverse effect, known as reduced demand, is also observed.

==Economics==
&quot;Induced demand&quot; and other terms were given economic definitions in a 1999 paper by Lee, Klein, and Camus. In the paper, &quot;induced traffic&quot; is defined as a change in traffic by movement along the &quot;short-run&quot; demand curve. This would include new trips made by existing residents, taken because driving on the road is now faster. Likewise, &quot;induced demand&quot; is defined as a change in traffic by movement along the &quot;long-run&quot; demand curve. This would include all trips made by new residents who moved to take advantage of the wider road.

== In transportation systems ==
===Definitions===
According to &quot;CityLab&quot;:

Induced demand is a catch-all term used for a variety of interconnected effects that cause new roads to quickly fill to capacity. In rapidly growing areas where roads were not designed for the current population, there may be significant latent demand for new road capacity, which causes a flood of new drivers to immediately take to the freeway once the new lanes are open, quickly congesting them again. But these individuals were presumably already living nearby; how did they get around before the expansion? They may have taken alternative modes of transport, travelled at off-peak hours, or not made those trips at all. That’s why latent demand can be difficult to disentangle from generated demand—the new traffic that is a direct result of the new capacity. (Some researchers try to isolate generated demand as the sole effect of induced demand.)

The technical distinction between the two terms, which are often used interchangeably, is that latent demand is travel that cannot be realised because of constraints. It is thus &quot;pent-up&quot;. Induced demand is demand that has been realised, or &quot;generated&quot;, by improvements made to transportation infrastructure. Thus, induced demand generates the traffic that had been &quot;pent-up&quot; as latent demand.

===History===
Latent demand has been recognised by road traffic professionals for many decades, and was initially referred to as &quot;traffic generation&quot;. In the simplest terms, latent demand is demand that exists, but, for any number of reasons, most having to do with human psychology, is suppressed by the inability of the system to handle it. Once additional capacity is added to the network, the demand that had been latent materialises as actual usage.

The effect was recognised as early as 1930, when an executive of a St. Louis, Missouri, electric railway company told the Transportation Survey Commission that widening streets simply produces more traffic, and heavier congestion. In New York, it was clearly seen in the highway-building program of Robert Moses, the &quot;master builder&quot; of the New York City area. As described by Moses&#x27;s biographer, Robert Caro, in &quot;The Power Broker&quot;: During the last two or three years before [the entrance of the United States into World War II], a few planners had ... begun to understand that, without a balanced system [of transportation], roads would not only not alleviate transportation congestion but would aggravate it. Watching Moses open the Triborough Bridge to ease congestion on the Queensborough Bridge, open the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge to ease congestion on the Triborough Bridge and then watching traffic counts on all three bridges mount until all three were as congested as one had been before, planners could hardly avoid the conclusion that &quot;traffic generation&quot; was no longer a theory but a proven fact: the more highways were built to alleviate congestion, the more automobiles would pour into them and congest them and thus force the building of more highways – which would generate more traffic and become congested in their turn in an ever-widening spiral that contained far-reaching implications for the future of New York and of all urban areas. The same effect had been seen earlier with the new parkways that Moses had built on Long Island in the 1930s and 40s, where ... every time a new parkway was built, it quickly became jammed with traffic, but the load on the old parkways was not significantly relieved. Similarly, the building of the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel failed to ease congestion on the Queens-Midtown Tunnel and the three East River bridges, as Moses had expected it to. By 1942, Moses could no longer ignore the reality that his roads were not alleviating congestion in the way he expected them to, but his answer to the problem was not to invest in mass transit, it was to build even more roads, in a vast program which would expand or create of roads, including additional bridges, such as the Throgs Neck Bridge and the Verrazano Narrows Bridge.

J. J. Leeming, a British road-traffic engineer and county surveyor between 1924 and 1964, described the phenomenon in his 1969 book, &quot;Road Accidents: Prevent or Punish?&quot;: Motorways and bypasses generate traffic, that is, produce extra traffic, partly by inducing people to travel who would not otherwise have done so by making the new route more convenient than the old, partly by people who go out of their direct route to enjoy the greater convenience of the new road, and partly by people who use the towns bypassed because they are more convenient for shopping and visits when through traffic has been removed. Leeming went on to give an example of the observed effect following the opening of the Doncaster Bypass section of the A1(M) in 1961. By 1998, Donald Chen quoted the British Transport Minister as saying &quot;The fact of the matter is that we cannot tackle our traffic problem by building more roads.&quot;

In Southern California, a study by the Southern California Association of Governments in 1989 concluded that steps taken to alleviate traffic congestion, such as adding lanes or turning freeways into double-decked roads, would have nothing but a cosmetic effect on the problem. Also, the University of California at Berkeley published a study of traffic in 30 California counties between 1973 and 1990 which showed that every 10 percent increase in roadway capacity, traffic increased by 9 percent within four years time. A 2004 meta-analysis, which took in dozens of previously published studies, confirmed this. It found that: ... on average, a 10 percent increase in lane miles induces an immediate 4 percent increase in vehicle miles travelled, which climbs to 10 percent – the entire new capacity – in a few years. An aphorism among some traffic engineers is &quot;Trying to cure traffic congestion by adding more capacity is like trying to cure obesity by loosening your belt.&quot;

According to city planner Jeff Speck, the &quot;seminal&quot; text on induced demand is the 1993 book &quot;The Elephant in the Bedroom: Automobile Dependence and Denial&quot;, written by Stanley I. Hart and Alvin L. Spivak.

=== Price of road travel ===
A journey on a road can be considered as having an associated cost or &quot;price&quot; (the generalised cost, &quot;g&quot;) which includes the out-of-pocket cost (e.g. fuel costs and tolls) and the opportunity cost of the time spent travelling, which is usually calculated as the product of travel time and the value of travellers&#x27; time. These cost determinants change often, and all have variable effects on demand for transport, which tends to be dependent on the reason(s) as well as method of travel.

When road capacity is increased, initially there is more road space per vehicle travelling than there was before, so congestion is reduced, and therefore the time spent travelling is reduced – reducing the generalised cost of every journey (by affecting the second &quot;cost&quot; mentioned in the previous paragraph). In fact, this is one of the key justifications for construction of new road capacity (the reduction in journey times).

A change in the cost (or price) of travel results in a change in the quantity consumed. Factors such as petrol prices, as well as fuel costs, are the most common variables that influence the quantity demanded for transport. This can be explained using the simple supply and demand theory, illustrated in this figure.

==== Elasticity of transport demand ====

The economic concept of elasticity measures the change in quantity demanded relative to a change in another variable, most commonly price. For roads or highways, the supply relates to capacity and the quantity consumed refers to vehicle miles traveled. The size of the increase in quantity consumed depends on the elasticity of demand.

The elasticity of demand for transport differs significantly depending on the reason people are choosing to travel initially. The clearest example of inelastic demand in this area is commuting, as studies indicate that most people are going to commute to work, regardless of fluctuations in variables such as petrol prices, as it is a required activity to generate income. This exemplifies the fact that activities that yield a high economic benefit, in this case, financial gain in the form of income, tend to be inelastic. Whereas, travelling for recreational or social reasons have a high tolerance for price increases, and as such the demand for recreational travel when prices spike sees a sharp decline.

A review of transport research suggests that the elasticity of traffic demand with respect to travel time is around −0.5 in the short term and −1.0 in the long term. This indicates that a 1.0% saving in travel time will generate an additional 0.5% increase in traffic within the first year. In the longer term, a 1.0% saving in travel time will result in a 1.0% increase in traffic volume.

=== Sources of induced traffic ===
In the short term, increased travel on new road space can come from one of two sources: diverted travel and induced traffic. Diverted travel occurs when people divert their trip from another road (change in route) or reschedule their travel to avoid peak period congestion – but if road capacity is expanded, peak congestion is lower and they can travel at the time they prefer.

Induced traffic occurs when new automobile trips are generated. This can occur when people choose to travel by car instead of public transport, or decide to travel when they otherwise would not have.

Shortening travel times can also encourage longer trips as reduced travel costs encourage people to choose farther destinations. Although this may not increase the number of trips, it increases vehicle miles travelled. In the long term, this effect alters land use patterns as people choose homes and workplace locations farther away than they would have without the expanded road capacity. These development patterns encourage automobile dependency which contributes to the high long-term demand elasticities of road expansion.

=== Induced traffic and transport planning ===
Although planners take into account future traffic growth when planning new roads (this often being an apparently reasonable justification for new roads in itself – that traffic growth will mean more road capacity is required), this traffic growth is calculated from increases in car ownership and economic activity, and does not take into account traffic induced by the presence of the new road; that is, it is assumed that traffic will grow, regardless of whether a road is built or not.

In the UK, the idea of induced traffic was used as grounds for protests against government policy of road construction in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s, until it became accepted as a given by the government as a result of their own Standing Advisory Committee on Trunk Road Assessment (SACTRA) study of 1994. However, despite the concept of induced traffic now being accepted, it is not always taken into consideration in planning.

=== Studies ===

A 1998 meta-analysis by the Surface Transportation Policy Project, which used data from the institute, stated that &quot;Metro areas which invested heavily in road capacity expansion fared no better in easing congestion than metro areas that did not.&quot;

On the other hand, a comparison of congestion data from 1982 to 2011 by the Texas A&amp;M Transportation Institute suggested that additional roadways reduced the rate of congestion increase. When increases in road capacity were matched to the increase demand, growth in congestion was found to be lower.

A study by Robert Cervero, a professor of City and Regional Planning at the University of California, Berkeley, found that &quot;over a six-to eight-year period following freeway expansion, around twenty percent of added capacity is &#x27;preserved,&#x27; and around eighty percent gets absorbed or depleted. Half of this absorption is due to external factors, like growing population and income. The other half is due to induced-demand effects, mostly higher speeds but also increased building activities. These represent California experiences from 1980 to 1994. Whether they hold true elsewhere is of course unknown.&quot;

And Mokhtarian et al. (2002) paired eighteen California state highway segments whose capacities had been improved in the early 1970s with control segments that matched the improved segments with regard to facility type, region, approximate size, and initial volumes &amp; congestion levels. Taking annual data for average daily traffic (ADT) and design-hour-traffic-to-capacity (DTC) ratios during the 21 years 1976–1996, they found the growth rates between the two types of segments to be “statistically and practically indistinguishable, suggesting that the capacity expansions, in and of themselves, had a negligible effect on traffic growth”.

=== Policy implications ===
When evaluating induced demand traffic demand theoretically, consideration is mainly given to the actual amount of traffic that will arise from a certain scenario. In real world applications, policymakers must consider the benefits of new infrastructure with the potential negative impacts on the environment, public health, and social equity.

Carbon emissions have become a primary concern for policymakers in recent times and continues to be a consideration for infrastructure planning. An example of this is the Expansion of Heathrow Airport, where hopes of additional runways would spur economic growth within the UK: increasing both the amount and frequency of direct flights. These expansion proposals posed climate concerns and prompted studies into its environmental viability. It was estimated by the government that such expansion plans would create 210.8 Mt (million tons) CO2 annually. In addition, approximately 700 homes, a church, and eight listed buildings would have to be destroyed to make way for the project. In 2020, the court of appeal ruled the expansion plans illegal due to the ministers’ lack of consideration towards the government’s commitments to climate change.

In contrast to negative externalities, Bogotá, Colombia, has been recognized as a success story in managing induced demand for transportation by investing in new bike infrastructure. The city’s first bike path was established in 1974, with heavy investment in the late 1990s which eventuated in over 300 kilometers of bike lanes and dedicated bike paths. This infrastructure has been credited with reducing traffic congestion through encouraging more people to bike as transport. Less traffic then directly leads to lesser emissions, improved air quality and healthier lifestyles for residents. In addition, the city has implemented additional policies such as a bike-sharing program, bike-friendly streets and education campaigns to promote biking as a healthy and sustainable mode of transportation.

=== Criticism ===

Critics of induced demand arguments generally accept their premise, but argue against their interpretation. Steven Polzin, former director of the Center for Urban Transportation Research and former Senior Advisor at the US Department of Transportation, argues that most forms of induced demand are actually good things and that, due to changing transportation trends, past data cannot be applied to present circumstances. Specifically, he argues:

# One type of induced demand is simply keeping up with population growth. This is a good thing.
# Another is traffic moving out of neighborhoods and onto newly expanded freeways. This is a very good thing.
# Another is people adjusting timing of trips to their desired timing, thus improving business efficiency and quality of life - both good things.
# Another is shifting transportation from non-auto transport to auto transport. Polzin does not argue that this is good, but rather that it&#x27;s irrelevant (at least in a US context) as non-auto transport is such a small fraction of the total, and thus cannot meaningfully induce demand anymore (unlike in the past). By contrast, going in reverse would require unprecedented growth rates in public transport systems even just to keep up with population growth.
# Another is people taking trips to places that they wouldn&#x27;t have gone before, such as shopping in new places or living further from work. Beyond arguments that this implies improved quality of life, while this appears to have been a major driver in induced demand in the past, it ignores trends. From 1980 to 2015 increases in road capacity in the US didn&#x27;t even keep up with population growth, yet vehicle miles per capita doubled - a detachment between capacity growth and demand. But since the late 2000s, vehicle miles per capita have stagnated - and growing trends of telecommuting and e-commerce are likely to apply further downward pressure. I.e.: people don&#x27;t drive further to shop or work if they&#x27;re shopping or working from home either way.
# As personal road travel declines, commercial and service travel increases. This travel is not sensitive to road capacity and is not readily shifted to alternate modes of transportation.

Rather than limiting demand by reducing road capacity, Polzin argues for limiting demand via highway pricing, such as managed lanes, toll highways, congestion pricing or cordon pricing, as this provides a revenue stream which can (among other things) subsidize public transportation.

Similar arguments have also been made by libertarian transportation policy analyst Randal O&#x27;Toole, economist William L. Anderson, transportation journalist and Market Urbanist director Scott Beyer, Professor of City and Regional planning Robert Cervero, studies such as from WSP and Rand Europe, and numerous others.

==Film-induced demand==

Film-induced demand, also referred to as film-induced tourism, is a relatively recent form of cultural tourism in which destinations that are included in media outlets such as television and films receive an increase in tourist visits. This is supported by several regression analyses that suggest a high correlation between destinations taking a proactive approach in order to encourage producers/studios to film at their location, and the tourism success in the area after the release of the movie. This is consistent with induced demand theory. When the supply increases, in the form of media exposure to areas that were not regarded as tourist hotspots, the number of visitors increases, even though the majority of these new visitors would not have necessarily visited these areas previously. This is exemplified by a Travelsat Competitive Index study that indicated that in 2017 alone, approximately 80 million tourists made the decision to travel to a destination based primarily on its featuring in a television series or film. This figure has doubled since 2015.

== Reduced demand (the inverse effect) ==
Just as increasing road capacity reduces the cost of travel and thus increases demand, the reverse is also observed – &quot;decreasing&quot; road capacity &quot;increases&quot; the cost of travel, so demand is reduced. This observation, for which there is much empirical evidence, has been called disappearing traffic, also traffic evaporation or traffic suppression, or, more generally, dissuaded demand. So the closure of a road or reduction in its capacity (e.g. reducing the number of available lanes) will result in the adjustment of traveler behavior to compensate – for example, people might stop making particular trips to patronize local businesses, condense multiple trips into one, re-time their trips to a less congested time, use online shopping with free shipping, or switch to public transport, carpooling, walking, bicycling or smaller motor vehicles less affected by road diets, such as motorcycles, depending upon the values of those trips or of the schedule delay they experience.

===Studies===
In 1994, the UK advisory committee SACTRA carried out a major review of the effect of increasing road capacity for trunk roads and motorways only, and reported that the evidence suggested such increases often resulted in substantial increases in the volume of traffic. Following this, London Transport and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions commissioned a study to see if the reverse also occurred, namely that when road capacity was reduced, there would be a reduction in traffic. This follow-up study was carried out by Sally Cairns, Carmen Hass-Klau and Phil Goodwin, with an Annex by Ryuichi Kitamura, Toshiyuki Yamamoto and Satoshi Fujii, and published as a book in 1998. A third study was carried out by Sally Cairns, Steve Atkins and Phil Goodwin, and published in the journal &quot;Municipal Engineer&quot; in 2002.

The 1998 study referred to about 150 sources of evidence, of which the most important were about 60 case studies in the UK, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, The Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, the US, Canada, Tasmania and Japan. They included major town centre traffic schemes to make pedestrian areas closed to traffic, bus priority measures (especially bus lanes), bridge and road closures for maintenance, and closures due to natural disasters, mostly earthquakes. The 2002 study added some extra case studies, including some involving cycle lanes. The Annex by Kitamura and his colleagues reported a detailed study of the effects of the Hanshin-Awaji earthquake in Japan.

Taking the results as a whole, there was an average reduction of 41% of the traffic flows on the roads whose capacity had been reduced, of which rather less than half could be detected as reappearing on alternative routes. Thus, on average, about 25% of the traffic disappeared. Analysis of surveys and traffic counts indicated that the disappearance was accounted for by between 15 and 20 different behavioural responses, including changing to other modes of transport, changing to other destinations, a reduction in the frequency of trips, and car-sharing. There was a large variation around these average results, with the biggest effects seen in large-scale pedestrianisation in German town centres, and the smallest seen in small-scale temporary closures with good alternative routes, and small reductions in capacity in uncongested streets. In a few cases, there was actually an increase in the volume of traffic, notably in towns which had closed some town centre roads at the same time as opening a new by-pass.

Cairns et al. concluded that:

The European Union have produced a manual titled &quot;Reclaiming city streets for people&quot; that presents case studies and methodologies for traffic evaporation in urban areas.

===Real-world examples===
An early example of the reduced demand effect was described by Jane Jacobs in her classic 1961 book &quot;The Death and Life of Great American Cities&quot;. Jacobs and others convinced New York City to close the street that split Greenwich Village&#x27;s Washington Square Park in two, and also not to widen the surrounding streets to service the extra capacity they were expected to carry because of the closing of the street. The city&#x27;s traffic engineers expected the result to be chaos, but, in fact, the extra traffic never appeared, as drivers instead avoided the area entirely.

Two widely known examples of reduced demand occurred in San Francisco, California, and in Manhattan, New York City, where, respectively, the Embarcadero Freeway and the lower portion of the elevated West Side Highway were torn down after sections of them collapsed. Concerns were expressed that the traffic which had used these highways would overwhelm local streets, but, in fact, the traffic, instead of being displaced, for the most part disappeared entirely. A New York State Department of Transportation study showed that 93% of the traffic which had used the West Side Highway was not displaced, but simply vanished.

After these examples, other highways, including portions of Harbor Drive in Portland, Oregon, the Park East Freeway in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the Central Freeway in San Francisco, and the Cheonggyecheon Freeway in Seoul, South Korea, were torn down, with the same effect observed.

The argument is also made to convert roads previously open to vehicular traffic into pedestrian areas, with a positive impact on the environment and congestion, as in the example of the central area of Florence, Italy. In New York City, after Mayor Michael Bloomberg&#x27;s plan for congestion pricing in Manhattan was rejected by the New York State Assembly, portions of Broadway at Times Square, Herald Square and Madison Square were converted into pedestrian plazas, and traffic lanes in other areas taken out of service in favor of protected bike lanes, reducing the convenience of using Broadway as a through-route. As a result, traffic on Broadway was reduced, and the speed of traffic in the area lessened. Another measure instituted was the replacement of through-lanes on some of Manhattan&#x27;s north–south avenues with dedicated left-turn lanes and protected bike lanes, reducing the avenues&#x27; carrying capacity. The Bloomberg administration was able to put these changes into effect as they did not require approval from the state legislature.

Despite the success of the Broadway pedestrian plazas in Manhattan, some pedestrian malls in the US, in which all traffic is removed from shopping streets, have not been successful. Areas with sufficient population density or pedestrian traffic are more likely to successfully pursue this path. Of the approximately 200 pedestrian malls created in the US from the 1970s on, only about 30 remained as of 2012, and many of these became poorer areas of their cities, as lack of accessibility caused commercial property values to decline. The exceptions, including the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica, California, and 16th Street in Denver, Colorado, are indicators that conversion of shopping streets to pedestrian malls can be successful. Some of the failed pedestrian malls have improved by allowing limited automobile traffic to return. Pedestrian zones are common across cities and towns in Europe.

<text>The governments of the Thirteen Colonies of British America developed in the 17th and 18th centuries under the influence of the British constitution. The British monarch issued colonial charters that established either royal colonies, proprietary colonies, or corporate colonies. In every colony, a governor led the executive branch, and the legislative branch was divided into two houses: a governor&#x27;s council and a representative assembly. Men who met property qualifications elected the assembly. In royal colonies, the British government appointed the governor and the council. In proprietary colonies, the proprietors appointed the governor and his council. In corporate colonies, voters elected these officials. 

In domestic matters, the colonies were largely self-governing on many issues; however, the British government did exercise veto power over colonial legislation, and regardless of the type of colonial government, retained control of the law and equity courts; judges were selected by the British government and served at the king&#x27;s pleasure. Diplomatic affairs were handled by the British government, as were trade policies and wars with foreign powers (wars with Native Americans were generally handled by colonial governments).

The American Revolution (1765–1783) was a dispute over the British Parliament&#x27;s right to enact domestic legislation for the American colonies. The British government&#x27;s position was that Parliament&#x27;s authority was unlimited, while the American position was that colonial legislatures were coequal with Parliament and outside of its jurisdiction. As the revolution progressed, the colonial governments were replaced by temporary provincial congresses and ultimately by state constitutions establishing republican governments. The colonial experience informed and shaped the new state constitutions and, ultimately, the United States Constitution adopted in 1789.

== Imperial government ==
===British constitution===

After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, Great Britain was governed as a constitutional monarchy with sovereignty residing in the King-in-Parliament. Parliament was a bicameral legislature. Aristocrats inherited seats in the House of Lords, while the gentry and merchants controlled the elected House of Commons. The British monarch possessed executive authority, but he relied on the cabinet ministers of the Privy Council to actually run the government. These ministers depended on majority support in both houses of Parliament to govern effectively. While only 25 percent of adult men met the property qualifications to vote in parliamentary elections, historian Alan Taylor notes: 

By the start of the American Revolution, the thirteen colonies had developed political systems featuring a governor exercising executive power and a bicameral legislature made up of a council and an assembly. The system was modeled on the British constitution, with the governor corresponding to the monarch, the council to the House of Lords and the assembly to the House of Commons. The American colonists were proud of their status as British subjects and claimed the same rights of Englishmen as their counterparts in the mother country.

=== Crown ===
The Thirteen Colonies were all founded with royal authorization, and authority continued to flow from the monarch as colonial governments exercised authority in the king&#x27;s name. A colony&#x27;s precise relationship to the Crown depended on whether it was a corporate colony, proprietary colony or royal colony as defined in its colonial charter. Whereas royal colonies belonged to the Crown, proprietary and corporate colonies were granted by the Crown to private interests.

Historian Robert Middlekauff describes royal administration of the colonies as inadequate and inefficient because lines of authority were never entirely clear. Before 1768, responsibility for colonial affairs rested with the Privy Council and the Secretary of State for the Southern Department. The Secretary relied on the Board of Trade to supply him with information and pass on his instructions to colonial officials. After 1768, the Secretary of State for Colonial Affairs was responsible for supervising the colonies; however, this ministry suffered from ineffective secretaries and the jealousy of other government ministers.

=== Parliament ===

Parliament&#x27;s authority over the colonies was unclear and controversial in the 18th century. As English government evolved from government by the Crown toward government in the name of the Crown (the King-in-Parliament), the convention that the colonies were ruled solely by the monarch gave way to greater involvement of Parliament by the mid 1700s. Acts of Parliament regulated commerce , defined citizenship, and limited the amount of paper money issued in the colonies.

The British government argued that Parliament&#x27;s authority to legislate for the colonies was unlimited. This was stated explicitly in the Declaratory Act 1766. The British also argued that the colonists, while not actually represented in Parliament, were nonetheless virtually represented. 

The American view, shaped by Whig political philosophy, was that Parliament&#x27;s authority over the colonies was limited. While the colonies initially recognized Parliament&#x27;s right to legislate for the whole British Empire—such as on matters of trade—they argued that parliamentary taxation was a violation of the principle of taxation by consent since consent could only be granted by the colonists&#x27; own representatives. Later, Americans argued that the colonies were outside of Parliament&#x27;s jurisdiction and that the colonists owed allegiance only to the Crown. In effect, Americans argued that their colonial legislatures were coequal—not subordinate—to Parliament. These incompatible interpretations of the British constitution would become the central issue of the American Revolution.

=== Judicial appeals ===

The Privy Council (technically, the King-in-Council) exercised appellate jurisdiction over the colonies. Appellate jurisdiction was delegated to the Board of Trade in 1679 and transferred to the Privy Council Appeals Committee in 1696.

The Appeals Committee was severely flawed because its membership was actually a committee of the whole of the Privy Council, of whom a quorum was three. Even worse, many Privy Councillors were not lawyers, all Privy Councillors had equal voting power on appeals, and there was no requirement that any of the Privy Councillors hearing a particular appeal had to be a lawyer. As a result, parties to appeals could and did try to tilt the outcome of appeals in their favor by persuading nonlawyer Privy Councillors to show up for the hearings on their appeals. For this reason, the Appeals Committee fell into disrepute among better-informed lawyers and judges in the colonies.

== Provincial government ==
=== Charter === 
Control over a corporate colony was granted to a joint-stock company, such as the Virginia Company. Virginia, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island were founded as corporate colonies. New England&#x27;s corporate colonies were virtually independent of royal authority and operated as republics where property owners elected the governor and legislators. 

Proprietary colonies were owned and governed by individuals known as proprietors. To attract settlers, however, proprietors agreed to share power with property owners. Maryland, South Carolina, North Carolina, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania were founded as proprietary colonies.

In 1624, Virginia became the first royal colony when the bankrupt Virginia Company&#x27;s charter was revoked. Over time, more colonies transitioned to royal control. When the Revolution started, there were eight royal colonies and five non-royal. Maryland, Pennsylvania and Delaware remained proprietary, while Rhode Island and Connecticut continued as corporate colonies.

=== Governor ===

In royal colonies, governors were appointed by the Crown and represented its interests. Before 1689, governors were the dominant political figures in the colonies. They possessed royal authority transmitted through their commissions and instructions. Among their powers included the right to summon, prorogue and dissolve the elected assembly. Governors could also veto any bill proposed by the colonial legislature.

Gradually, the assemblies successfully restricted the power of governors by gaining control over money bills, including the salaries of the governor and other officials. Therefore, a governor could find his salary withheld by an uncooperative legislature. Governors were often placed in an untenable position. Their official instructions from London demanded that they protect the Crown&#x27;s power—the royal prerogative—from usurpation by the assembly; at the same time, they were also ordered to secure more colonial funding for Britain&#x27;s wars against France. In return for military funding, the assemblies often demanded more power.

To gain support for his agenda, the governor distributed patronage. He could reward supporters by appointing them to various offices such as attorney general, surveyor-general or as a local sheriff. These offices were sought after as sources of prestige and income. He could also reward supporters with land grants. As a result of this strategy, colonial politics was characterized by a split between a governor&#x27;s faction (the court party) and his opposition (the country party).

=== Governor&#x27;s Council ===
The executive branch included an advisory council to the governor that varied in size ranging from ten to thirty members. In royal colonies, the Crown appointed a mix of placemen (paid officeholders in the government) and members of the upper class within colonial society. Councilors tended to represent the interests of businessmen, creditors and property owners in general. While lawyers were prominent throughout the thirteen colonies, merchants were important in the northern colonies and planters were more involved in the southern provinces. Members served &quot;at pleasure&quot; rather than for life or fixed terms. When there was an absentee governor or an interval between governors, the council acted as the government.

The governor&#x27;s council also functioned as the upper house of the colonial legislature. In most colonies, the council could introduce bills, pass resolutions, and consider and act upon petitions. In some colonies, the council acted primarily as a chamber of revision, reviewing and improving legislation. At times, it would argue with the assembly over the amendment of money bills or other legislation.

In addition to being both an executive and legislative body, the council also had judicial authority. It was the final court of appeal within the colony. The council&#x27;s multifaceted roles exposed it to criticism. Richard Henry Lee criticized Virginia&#x27;s colonial government for lacking the balance and separation of powers found in the British constitution due to the council&#x27;s lack of independence from the Crown.

===Assembly===

The lower house of a colonial legislature was a representative assembly. These assemblies were called by different names. Virginia had a House of Burgesses, Massachusetts had a House of Deputies, and South Carolina had a Commons House of Assembly. While names differed, the assemblies had several features in common. Members were elected annually by the propertied citizens of the towns or counties. Usually they met for a single, short session; but the council or governor could call a special session.

As in Britain, the right to vote was limited to men with freehold &quot;landed property sufficient to ensure that they were personally independent and had a vested interest in the welfare of their communities&quot;. Due to the greater availability of land, the right to vote was more widespread in the colonies where by one estimate around 60 percent of adult white males could vote. In England and Wales, only 17–20 percent of adult males were eligible. Six colonies allowed alternatives to freehold ownership (such as personal property or tax payment) that extended voting rights to owners of urban property and even prosperous farmers who rented their land. Groups excluded from voting included laborers, tenant farmers, unskilled workers and indentured servants. These were considered to lack a &quot;stake in society&quot; and to be vulnerable to corruption.

Tax issues and budget decisions originated in the assembly. Part of the budget went toward the cost of raising and equipping the colonial militia. As the American Revolution drew near, this subject was a point of contention and conflict between the provincial assemblies and their respective governors.

The perennial struggles between the colonial governors and the assemblies are sometimes viewed, in retrospect, as signs of a rising democratic spirit. However, those assemblies generally represented the privileged classes, and they were protecting the colony against unreasonable executive encroachments. Legally, the crown governor&#x27;s authority was unassailable. In resisting that authority, assemblies resorted to arguments based upon natural rights and the common welfare, giving life to the notion that governments derived, or ought to derive, their authority from the consent of the governed.

== Local government ==
Virginia and Maryland were colonies characterized by dispersed plantations and few towns. The main unit of local government was the county, which was controlled by wealthy planters. On the assembly&#x27;s advice, the governor appointed the judges, the sheriff, and the county clerk. In addition to conducting trials, the county court was responsible for many other functions including:

* tavern and ferry licensing 
* road maintenance
* local taxation
* militia supervision
* assembly elections 
* enforcing colonial laws

== Union proposals ==
Before the American Revolution, attempts to create a unified government for the thirteen colonies were unsuccessful. Multiple plans for a union were proposed at the Albany Congress in 1754. One of these plans, proposed by Benjamin Franklin, was the Albany Plan.

== Demise ==
During the American Revolution, the colonial governments ceased to function effectively as royal governors prorogued and dissolved the assemblies. By 1773, committees of correspondence were governing towns and counties, and nearly all the colonies had established provincial congresses, which were legislative assemblies acting outside of royal authority. These were temporary measures, and it was understood that the provincial congresses were not equivalent to proper legislatures.

By May 1775, the Massachusetts Provincial Congress felt that a permanent government was needed. On the advice of the Second Continental Congress, Massachusetts once again operated under the Charter of 1691 but without a governor (the governor&#x27;s council functioned as the executive branch). In the fall of 1775, the Continental Congress recommended that New Hampshire, South Carolina and Virginia form new governments. New Hampshire adopted a republican constitution on January 5, 1776. South Carolina&#x27;s constitution was adopted on March 26, and Virginia&#x27;s constitution was adopted on June 29. 

In May 1776, the Continental Congress called for the creation of new governments &quot;where no government sufficient to the exigencies of their affairs have been hitherto established&quot; and &quot;that the exercise of every kind of authority under the ... Crown should be totally suppressed&quot;. The Declaration of Independence in July further encouraged the states to form new governments, and most states had adopted new constitutions by the end of 1776. Because of the Revolutionary War, New York and Georgia did not complete constitutions until 1777.

<text>Aston Abbotts or Aston Abbots is a village and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England. It is about north of Aylesbury and south-west of Wing. The parish includes the hamlet of Burston and had a population of 426 at the 2021 Census.

==Manor==
&quot;Aston&quot; is a common toponym in England, derived from the Old English for &quot;eastern estate&quot;. The suffix &quot;Abbotts&quot; refers to the former abbey in the village, which until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century was the country home of the abbots of St Albans in Hertfordshire. The present house called The Abbey, Aston Abbotts was largely built in the late 18th century and altered in the early 19th century.

==Parish church==
The Church of England parish church of St James the Great has a late 15th or early 16th century Perpendicular Gothic west tower, but the rest of the building was demolished in 1865 and replaced with a new nave and chancel designed by the Oxford Diocesan Architect G.E. Street and completed in 1866. The church is a Grade II* listed building.

The church tower has a ring of six bells. Anthony Chandler of Drayton Parslow cast the third and fifth bells in the Commonwealth period in 1652. Edward Hall, also of Drayton Parslow, cast the fourth bell in 1739 and the tenor in 1740. John Taylor &amp; Co of Loughborough cast the treble and second bells in 1929.

The polar explorer Sir James Clark Ross is buried in the churchyard of St James the Great.

==Czechoslovak government-in-exile==
In the Second World War from 1940 to 1945 Dr Edvard Beneš, the exiled President of Czechoslovakia, stayed at The Abbey in Aston Abbotts. His advisers and secretaries (called his Chancellery) stayed in nearby Wingrave, and his military intelligence staff stayed at nearby Addington. President Beneš gave a bus shelter to the villages of Aston Abbotts and Wingrave in 1944. It is on the A418 road between the two villages.

==Amenities==
The village has a public house, the Royal Oak. Aston Abbotts had a village shop, but this closed in 2005.

The nearest shop, post office and school are 1 mile east of Aston Abbotts in the village of Wingrave, with Wingrave offering a Church of England First and Middle school. The nearest secondary school and doctors surgery are 2 miles north east of Aston Abbotts in the village of Wing.

There are regular bus services to Aston Abbotts from Aylesbury and Leighton Buzzard.

<doc id="394735" wikidata="Q3701365" url="?curid=394735" title="Dan Hicks (singer)">
<text>Daniel Ivan Hicks (December 9, 1941 – February 6, 2016) was an American singer-songwriter and musician, and the leader of Dan Hicks and His Hot Licks. His idiosyncratic style combined elements of cowboy folk, jazz, country, swing, bluegrass, pop, and gypsy music. He is perhaps best known for the songs &quot;I Scare Myself&quot; and &quot;Canned Music&quot;. His songs are frequently infused with humor, as evidenced by the title of his tune &quot;How Can I Miss You When You Won&#x27;t Go Away?&quot; His album &quot;Live at Davies&quot; (2013) capped over forty years of music.

Writing about Hicks for &quot;Oxford American&quot; in 2007, critic David Smay said, &quot;[T]here was a time from the ’20s through the ’40s when swing—&#x27;hot rhythm&#x27;—rippled through every form of popular music. That’s the music Dan Hicks plays, and there’s no single word for it because it wasn’t limited to any one genre. Django Reinhardt and the Mills Brothers and Spade Cooley and Hank Garland and the Boswell Sisters and Stuff Smith and Bing Crosby all swing. You can make yourself nutty trying to define what Dan Hicks is. Then again, you could just say: Dan Hicks swings.&quot;

==Early life==

Hicks was born in Little Rock, Arkansas on December 9, 1941. the only child of Ivan L. Hicks (a career United States Army and United States Air Force non-commissioned officer) and the former Evelyn Kehl. At age five, Hicks moved with his family to California. Following brief stints in Lomita, Cambria, and Vallejo, the family settled in Santa Rosa, the largest city in the North Bay subregion of the San Francisco Bay Area, where he was a drummer in grade school and played the snare drum in his school marching band.

At 14, he was performing with area dance bands. While in high school, he had a rotating spot on &quot;Time Out for Teens&quot;, a daily 15-minute local radio program. After receiving an A.A. in general education from Santa Rosa Junior College, he went on to earn a B.A. in broadcasting from San Francisco State College in 1965. Taking up the guitar in 1959, he became part of the American folk music revival scene during his undergraduate studies, often dropping out intermittently to perform at venues across the United States. Strongly influenced by the Jim Kweskin Jug Band, he would cultivate friendships with several of the group&#x27;s members (most notably Maria Muldaur) later in life.

Although he maintained an equivocal stance toward rock music (lauding the early recordings of Elvis Presley and The Byrds while retrospectively maintaining that &quot;rock has never really been my thing&quot;), Hicks joined seminal San Francisco psychedelic rock band The Charlatans on drums in 1965.

In this capacity, he participated in the group&#x27;s celebrated summer 1965 engagement at the Red Dog Saloon in Virginia City, Nevada. After the band failed to secure a long-term recording contract, he switched to rhythm guitar in 1967 and briefly performed his original material as the group&#x27;s frontman before leaving in 1968.

==Bandleader==

In 1967, Hicks formed Dan Hicks and His Hot Licks with violinist David LaFlamme as a vehicle for new songs rooted in his longstanding appreciation for acoustic-based forms of pre-rock popular music. In one of their earliest engagements, the group opened for The Charlatans; members of the latter band were surprised to see Hicks performing with a different ensemble.

In 1968, LaFlamme left to form It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day and was replaced by jazz violinist and fellow Santa Rosan &quot;Symphony&quot; Sid Page. Following several lineup changes, vocalists Sherry Snow and Christine Gancher, guitarist Jon Weber, and bassist Jaime Leopold filled out the band, which had no drummer. This line-up was signed to Epic and in 1969 issued the album &quot;Original Recordings&quot;, produced by Bob Johnston. The first major Hot Licks lineup lasted until 1971 and then broke up.

When Hicks reformed the band, Page and Leopold remained, and vocalists Naomi Ruth Eisenberg and Maryann Price joined, followed later by guitarist John Girton and drummer Bob Scott. This group recorded three albums, culminating in 1973&#x27;s &quot;Last Train to Hicksville&quot;. Following years of critical success, the album gained the group wider acclaim, peaking at #67 during an eighteen-week stay on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart; during this period, the group headlined at Carnegie Hall and appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; and &quot;The Flip Wilson Show&quot;. Nevertheless, Hicks dissolved the group by the end of the year, a decision that inspired a Charles Perry-penned &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; cover story. In 1997, he reflected on the decision: “It was getting old. We became less compatible as friends. I was pretty disillusioned, had some money, and didn’t want to do it any more.”

Over the next decade, Hicks seldom recorded while subsisting on Hot Licks royalties in his adopted hometown of Mill Valley, California. Envisaged as the soundtrack for an early iteration of Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s &quot;Hey Good Lookin&#x27;&quot; (1982), the acclaimed &quot;It Happened One Bite&quot; was released as Hicks&#x27; first solo album by Warner Bros. Records in 1978; however, it only managed to peak at #155 in &quot;Billboard&quot;. Often performing under the influence of alcohol, opioids and cocaine, his reputation was sullied by a series of belligerent solo concerts. Following rehabilitation, he appeared with Asleep at the Wheel at Farm Aid II in 1986, auguring his return to the popular consciousness. Although he briefly resumed using alcohol and cannabis in the mid-1990s (a period that culminated in arrests for public intoxication and driving under the influence), Hicks would credit Alcoholics Anonymous with maintaining his sobriety.

The classic Hot Licks lineup reunited for an appearance on &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; in 1991. The program also featured Hicks&#x27; new group, The Acoustic Warriors, a combination of folk, swing, jazz and country which included Brian Godchaux on violin and mandolin, Paul &quot;Pazzo&quot; Mehling on guitar, and Richard Saunders on bass. In 1993, the Acoustic Warriors continued to perform locally around San Francisco and on the road, but this edition placed Paul Robinson on guitar, Nils Molin or Alex Baum on string bass, Stevie Blacke on mandolin and Josh Riskin on drums. Hicks recorded one CD with the Acoustic Warriors. &quot;Shootin&#x27; Straight&quot; was released by Private Music in 1996. Recorded live at McCabe&#x27;s in Santa Monica, it featured Jim Boggio on accordion/piano, Stevie Blacke on mandolin/violin, Paul Robinson on guitar, Alex Baum on bass and former Hot Lick Bob Scott on drums.

Beginning with &quot;Beatin’ the Heat&quot; (featuring Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, Bette Midler, Ricki Lee Jones and Brian Setzer) in 2000, Hicks returned to releasing albums with a reconstituted lineup of the Hot Licks on Surfdog Records. &quot;Alive and Lickin’&quot;, a live album with the Hot Licks, followed in 2001. In 2003, Surfdog released &quot;Dan Hicks and The Hot Licks: Featuring an All-Star Cast of Friends&quot;, a live CD/DVD package. These albums reinvigorated Hicks, and the guests reflected their longtime admiration for the Hot Licks. Dan Hicks and The Hot Licks&#x27; comeback was met with widespread critical acclaim and led to several more albums under the Surfdog label. &quot;Selected Shorts&quot; featuring Jimmy Buffett, Willie Nelson and Gibby Haynes was released in 2004, then a downloadable compilation of Hicks&#x27;s previously released duets in 2007, &quot;Tangled Tales&quot; in 2009, &quot;Crazy For Christmas&quot; in 2010, and &quot;Live at Davies&quot; in 2013. To honor Dan on the first anniversary of Dan Hicks passing, Surfdog Records released &quot;Greatest Licks – I Feel Like Singin’&quot;, a compilation album paying tribute and celebrating Dan&#x27;s life and legacy, in February 2017.

In his later years, Hicks occasionally played jazz standards at intimate venues in the San Francisco Bay Area with Bayside Jazz.

In the film &quot;Class Action&quot; (1991), Hicks is seen performing with Eisenberg and Price at Rosatti&#x27;s in San Francisco. He also can be seen in several documentary films, including &quot;Revolution&quot; (1968) and &quot;Rockin at the Red Dog&quot; (1996).

From its founding in 1977 until late in his life, Hicks played with the San Francisco Bay Area&#x27;s Christmas Jug Band.

Thomas Dolby covered his song &quot;I Scare Myself&quot;.

==Musical style==
&quot;Billboard&quot; called Hicks an eccentric whose music contained elements of country, folk, jazz, and comedy. Hicks called his music &quot;folk swing&quot;.

==Personal life==
Following an on-and-off relationship spanning two decades, Hicks married concert promoter Clare &quot;CT&quot; Wasserman (a protege of Bill Graham and the former wife of bassist Rob Wasserman) in February 1997. He was diagnosed with throat and liver cancer in 2014. In March 2015, Hicks announced that he had been diagnosed with liver cancer. On February 6, 2016, at age 74, he died from cancer at his home in Mill Valley.

His posthumous memoir, &quot;I Scare Myself&quot;, was published in 2017. He spent hours on the phone with journalist Kristine McKenna every Friday for several years before his death. She edited these conversations into Hicks&#x27; autobiography.
