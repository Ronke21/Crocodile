<text>Butler&#x27;s Rangers (1777–1784) was a Loyalist provincial military unit of the American Revolutionary War, raised by American loyalist John Butler. Most members of the regiment were Loyalists from upstate New York and northeastern Pennsylvania. Their winter quarters were constructed on the west bank of the Niagara River, in what is now Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario. The Rangers fought principally in New York and Pennsylvania, but ranged as far west as Ohio and Michigan, and as far south as Virginia and Kentucky.

The Rangers were engaged in numerous violent raids that characterized the northern frontier of the American Revolutionary War, such as the Battle of Wyoming in July 1778 and the Cherry Valley massacre of November 1778. These actions earned the Rangers a reputation for ruthlessness.

==Formation==
Similar to other Loyalist regiments that fought for the British Crown during the Revolutionary War, for example the King&#x27;s Royal Regiment of New York, Butler&#x27;s Rangers was made up of Loyalist refugees who had fled to Canada following the outbreak of the American Revolution. John Butler was a French and Indian War veteran and landowner with a 26,000 acre estate near Caughnawaga in the Mohawk Valley. On the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, Butler abandoned these landholdings and fled to the Province of Quebec (now Canada) in the company of other Loyalist leaders, such as Daniel Claus and the Mohawk leader, Joseph Brant. During the war, John Butler also served as a deputy superintendent in the British Indian Department under Guy Johnson, another prominent Loyalist from the Mohawk Valley.

During the 1777 Saratoga Campaign, Butler persuaded about 350 Seneca warriors to participate in the Siege of Fort Stanwix, and led a group of Indian Department rangers at the Battle of Oriskany. As a result, Butler was granted permission in September 1777 to raise a “corps of rangers,” and was commissioned as its major commandant. Butler&#x27;s Rangers would be based at Fort Niagara, and would work closely with Britain’s native allies. Over the course of the war, the Rangers slowly grew from two companies in February 1778 to 10 companies by September 1781. Although the Rangers were headquartered at Fort Niagara, one company was later stationed at Detroit.

A number of Black Loyalists also served in Butler&#x27;s Rangers. Most prominent among these was Richard Pierpoint, formerly a slave in the northern Thirteen Colonies. After the war, Pierpoint settled with the disbanded Rangers in Canada.

==Campaigns==
In the summer of 1778, 110 Rangers under the command of Major Butler, accompanied by 464 mostly Seneca warriors, led by Sayenqueraghta and Cornplanter, destroyed the settlements in the Wyoming Valley in northeastern Pennsylvania. At the Battle of Wyoming on July 3, 1778, between 300 and 400 Patriot militia and Continentals were thoroughly routed by Butler&#x27;s forces. The battle is frequently referred to as the Wyoming Massacre due to the large number of American soldiers who were scalped and killed by the Seneca as they fled the battlefield. A sensationalist and widely distributed newspaper report published a few weeks later falsely accused the Rangers of slaughtering women and children in the aftermath of the battle. 

In September 1778, Captain William Caldwell’s company participated in the Attack on German Flatts that destroyed about 63 houses as well as barns and mills.

Two months later, Major Butler’s son, Captain Walter Butler, commanded about 150 Rangers at the Cherry Valley Massacre. Unlike at Wyoming where few if any non-combatants were killed, Captain Butler was unable to prevent the Seneca killing 32 civilians including children. About 70 of the inhabitants were taken captive but most of the women and children were released two days later.

At the Battle of Newtown in August 1779, the Rangers, Brant’s Volunteers and a contingent of Haudenosaunee and Munsee Delaware were unable to turn back the invasion of Haudenosaunee territory by the Continental Army during the genocidal Sullivan Campaign. The Rangers were forced to withdraw under sustained artillery fire when Major Butler became aware that his position was being flanked.

John Butler was promoted from Major to Lieutenant Colonel in the winter of 1780.

In October 1780, houses, barns, mills, and stores of grain and hay were burned as Loyalist forces led by Sir John Johnson marched down the Schoharie Valley to the Mohawk River, then headed west to destroy Stone Arabia. Four companies of Butler’s Rangers under the command of Lt. Col. Butler took part in this action. Albany and Tryon County militia under the command of Brigadier General Robert Van Rensselaer engaged Johnson&#x27;s men west of Stone Arabia at the inconclusive Battle of Klock&#x27;s Field on October 19, 1780.

A year later, Major John Ross, commanding the 2nd Battalion of the King&#x27;s Royal Regiment of New York, led a raid on the Mohawk Valley that destroyed Warrensborough to the east of Fort Hunter before heading to Johnstown. With Ross were three companies of Butler&#x27;s Rangers commanded by Captain Butler. On October 25, 1781, Ross engaged several hundred patriot militia commanded by Colonel Marinus Willett at the Battle of Johnstown. Five days later, as Ross withdrew towards Oswego, a rear-guard action at West Canada Creek resulted in the death of Captain Butler.

In June 1782, Captain William Caldwell’s company and their Shawnee allies forced Colonel William Crawford’s expedition to withdraw at the Battle of Sandusky. Caldwell was wounded early in the battle. In August, Caldwell crossed into Kentucky and after an unsuccessful attack on Bryan Station, defeated the patriot militia at the Battle of Blue Licks. A month later Captain Andrew Bradt’s company was present at the unsuccessful Siege of Fort Henry, in what is now Wheeling, West Virginia.

==Officers==

The company commanders of Butler&#x27;s Rangers were:
*Captain Andrew Bradt
*Captain Walter Butler, John Butler&#x27;s son, killed in action in 1781
*Captain William Caldwell, victor at the Battle of Sandusky and the Battle of Blue Licks
*Captain George Dame
*Captain Bernard Frey
*Captain Peter Hare
*Captain John McDonell
*Captain John McKinnon
*Captain Benjamin Pawling
*Captain Peter Ten Broeck
*Captain Andrew Thompson, fell overboard and drowned in Lake Erie in the fall of 1781 when returning from Detroit

==Uniforms and Weapons==
There is an historical debate as to what the Butler&#x27;s Ranger uniform actually looked like.
*Variation A – Their uniforms consisted of a green woolen coat faced white and a white woolen waistcoat. Their pant garment was gaitered trousers made from Russia sheeting, a hemp product. Their hats were round hats, useful in shielding their faces from the sun. When in garrison or on parade, they could bring up the leaves of that hat to form a cocked hat. Their belting was black.
*Variation B – Dark green coats faced with scarlet and lined with the same, a waistcoat of green cloth, and Buckskin Indian leggings reaching from the ankle to the waist...their caps were almost skull caps of black jacket leather or turned up felt with a black cockade on the left side. Their belts were of buff leather and crossed at the breast where they were held in place by a brass plate marked in the same manner and with the same words as the cap plate. This version is based on supposition rather than primary source materials.

Butler&#x27;s Rangers primarily used both the Long-Land and Short-Land forms of the Brown Bess musket. A mix of other firearms may have been used but would have created a supply issue due to calibre variations.

==Resettlement in Canada==

Butler&#x27;s Rangers were disbanded in June 1784, and its veterans were given land grants in the Nassau District, now the Niagara region of Ontario, as a reward for their services to the British Crown. In 1788 the Nassau Militia was formed with John Butler as its Commander, filling its ranks with the demobilized officers and men of Butler&#x27;s Rangers. In 1792 the county of Lincoln was formed and the name of the militia was changed to Lincoln Militia by 1793. The Lincoln Militia saw extensive fighting during the War of 1812 (1812–1815).

The Lincoln Militia still exists today as The Lincoln and Welland Regiment, a primary reserve regiment of the Canadian Forces, based in St. Catharines, Ontario. Although the building that houses &quot;The Lincoln and Welland Regiment Museum&quot; in Niagara-on-the-Lake is known as &quot;Butler&#x27;s Barracks&quot;, it is not the original barracks and never housed Butler&#x27;s Rangers. It was built in the years following the War of 1812 to house the Indian Department, and received the name because Butler had been a Deputy Superintendent in that department.

<text>Diane di Prima (August 6, 1934October 25, 2020) was an American poet, known for her association with the Beat movement. She was also an artist, prose writer, and teacher. Her &quot;magnum opus&quot; is widely considered to be &quot;Loba&quot;, a collection of poems first published in 1978 then extended in 1998.

==Early life and education==
Di Prima was born in Brooklyn, New York, on August 6, 1934. She was a second generation American of Italian descent. Her father Francis was a lawyer, and her mother Emma (née Mallozzi) was a teacher. Her maternal grandfather, Domenico Mallozzi, was an activist and associated with anarchists Carlo Tresca and Emma Goldman. Di Prima changed her last name from DiPrima to di Prima because she believed it better reflected her Italian ancestry.

She attended academically elite Hunter College High School where she became part of a small group of friends including classmate Audre Lorde who formed a sort of Dead Poets Society calling themselves &quot;the Branded&quot;. They cut class to roam the city, hanging out in bookstores, sharing their own poetry and holding séances for dead poets.

Di Prima then went on to Swarthmore College before dropping out to be a poet in Manhattan. Di Prima began writing as a child and by the age of 19 was corresponding with Ezra Pound and Kenneth Patchen. Her first book of poetry, &quot;This Kind of Bird Flies Backward&quot;, was published in 1958 by Hettie Jones and LeRoi Jones&#x27; Totem Press.

== Career ==
===Involvement with the Beats===
Di Prima spent the late 1950s and early 1960s in Manhattan, where she participated in the emerging Beat movement. She spent some time in California at Stinson Beach and Topanga Canyon, returned to New York City, and eventually moved to San Francisco permanently.

She edited the newspaper &quot;The Floating Bear&quot; with Amiri Baraka (LeRoi Jones) and was co-founder of the New York Poets Theatre and founder of the Poets Press. On several occasions she faced charges of obscenity by the United States government due to her work with the New York Poets Theatre and &quot;The Floating Bear&quot;. In 1961 she was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for publishing two poems in &quot;The Floating Bear&quot;. According to di Prima, police persistently harassed her due to the nature of her poetry. In 1966, she spent some time at Millbrook with Timothy Leary&#x27;s psychedelic community.

From 1974 to 1997, di Prima taught poetry at the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics, of the Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado, sharing the program with fellow Beats Allen Ginsberg and Anne Waldman (co-founders of the program), William Burroughs, Gregory Corso, and others.

===Later career===
In the late 1960s, di Prima moved permanently to California. There, she became involved with the Diggers and studied Buddhism, Sanskrit, Gnosticism, and alchemy. In 1966, she signed a vow of tax resistance to the Vietnam War. In the 1970s, she published the collection &quot;Revolutionary Letters&quot;, influenced by her time with the Diggers. At The Band&#x27;s famous Last Waltz concert in 1976, she read aloud from Revolutionary Letters and the one-line poem &quot;Get Yer Cut Throat Off My Knife&quot;.

She published her major work, the long poem &quot;Loba&quot;, in 1978, with an enlarged edition in 1998. From the 1960s on she worked as a photographer and a collage artist, and in the last decade or so of her life she took up watercolor painting.

From 1980 to 1987, di Prima taught Hermetic and esoteric traditions in poetry, in a short-lived but significant Masters-in-Poetics program at New College of California, which she established together with poets Robert Duncan and David Meltzer. She has also taught at the San Francisco Art Institute. She was one of the co-founders of San Francisco Institute of Magical and Healing Arts (SIMHA), where she taught Western spiritual traditions from 1983 to 1992.

In 2009, di Prima became San Francisco&#x27;s poet laureate.

==Activism==
Di Prima was known for her activism, having been exposed early on to political consciousness by her grandfather, Domenico, as detailed in her memoir &quot;Recollections of My Life as a Woman&quot;; she also discusses this in a 2001 interview with David Hadbawnik. In her memoir, di Prima describes seeing her grandfather speak at a rally in the park, writing: &quot;I am proud of him, and afraid, but mostly amazed. His words have awakened my full acknowledgment, consent. I hear what he says as truth, and it seems I have always known it. I feel old, self-contained, passionate with the pure passion of a child.&quot; Moments such as these sparked a dedication to social activism, especially as it concerned women&#x27;s rights, that persisted throughout di Prima&#x27;s life.

== Death and legacy ==
Di Prima died on October 25, 2020, at San Francisco General Hospital. She was 86 years old. She had several health issues including Parkinson&#x27;s disease and Sjögren syndrome. She was working on several books until two weeks prior to her death. Di Prima&#x27;s works are held at the University of Louisville, Indiana University, Southern Illinois University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

<doc id="404247" wikidata="Q189616" url="?curid=404247" title="Ellora Caves">
<text>The Ellora Caves are a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Aurangabad, India. It is one of the largest rock-cut Hindu temple cave complexes in the world, with artwork dating from the period 600–1000 AD, also including several Buddhist and Jain caves. The complex is a leading example of Indian rock-cut architecture, and several are not strictly &quot;caves&quot; in that they have no roof. Cave 16 features the largest single monolithic rock excavation in the world, the Kailash temple, a chariot-shaped monument dedicated to the god Shiva. The Kailash temple excavation also features sculptures depicting various Hindu deities as well as relief panels summarizing the two major Hindu epics.

There are over 100 caves at the site, all excavated from the basalt cliffs in the Charanandri Hills, 34 of which are open to public. These consist of 17 Hindu (caves 13–29), 12 Buddhist (caves 1–12) and 5 Jain (caves 30–34) caves, each group representing deities and mythologies prevalent in the 1st millennium CE, as well as monasteries of each respective religion. They were built close to one another and illustrate the religious harmony that existed in ancient India. All of the Ellora monuments were built during the Rashtrakuta dynasty (r. 753-982 AD), which constructed part of the Hindu and Buddhist caves, and the Yadava dynasty (c. 1187–1317), which constructed a number of the Jain caves. Funding for the construction of the monuments was provided by royals, traders and the wealthy of the region.

Although the caves served as temples and a rest stop for pilgrims, the site&#x27;s location on an ancient South Asian trade route also made it an important commercial centre in the Deccan region. It is north-west of Aurangabad, and about east-northeast of Mumbai. Today, the Ellora Caves, along with the nearby Ajanta Caves, are a major tourist attraction in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra and a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).

==Etymology==
Ellora, also called Verul or Elura, is the short form of the ancient name Elloorpuram. The older form of the name has been found in ancient references such as the Baroda inscription of 812 AD which mentions &quot;the greatness of this edifice&quot; and that &quot;this great edifice was built on a hill by Krishnaraja at Elapura, the edifice in the inscription being the Kailasa temple. In the Indian tradition, each cave is named and has a suffix &quot;Guha&quot; (Sanskrit), &quot;Lena&quot; or &quot;Leni&quot; (Marathi), meaning cave.

It is also thought to be derived from Ilvalapuram, named after the asura Ilvala who ruled this region who was vanquished by Sage Agastya.

==Location==

The Ellora caves are situated in state of Maharashtra about northwest of the city of Aurangabad, east-northeast of Mumbai, from Pune and about west of the Ajanta Caves, 2.3 kilometres (1.42 miles) from Grishneshwar Temple (India).

Ellora occupies a relatively flat rocky region of the Western Ghats, where ancient volcanic activity had created multilayered basalt formations, known as the Deccan Traps. The volcanic activity that formed the west-facing cliff that houses the Ellora caves occurred during the Cretaceous period. The resulting vertical face made access to many layers of rock formations easier, enabling architects to pick basalt with finer grains for more detailed sculpting.

==Chronology==

The construction at Ellora has been studied since British colonial rule. However, the overlapping styles between the Buddhist, Hindu and Jain caves has made it difficult to establish agreement concerning the chronology of their construction. The disputes generally concern: one, whether the Buddhist or Hindu caves were carved first and, two, the relative dating of caves within a particular tradition. The broad consensus that has emerged is based on comparing the carving styles at Ellora to other cave temples in the Deccan region that have been dated, textual records of various dynasties, and epigraphical evidence found at various archaeological sites near Ellora and elsewhere in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. Geri Hockfield Malandra and other scholars have stated that the Ellora caves had three important building periods: an early Hindu period (~550 to 600 CE), a Buddhist phase (~600 to 730 CE) and a later Hindu and Jain phase (~730 to 950 CE).

The earliest caves may have been built during the Traikutakas and Vakataka dynasties, the latter being known for sponsoring the Ajanta caves. However, it is considered likely that some of the earliest caves, such as Cave 29 (Hindu), were built by the Shiva-inspired Kalachuri dynasty, while the Buddhist caves were built by the Chalukya dynasty. The later Hindu caves and early Jain caves were built by the Rashtrakuta dynasty, while the last Jain caves were built by the Yadava dynasty, which had also sponsored other Jain cave temples.

==The Hindu monuments: Caves 13–29==

The Hindu caves were constructed during the Kalachuri period, from the mid-6th century to the end of the 8th century in two phases. Nine cave temples were excavated early in the 6th century, followed by a further four caves (caves 17–29). Work first started
, in order, on Caves 28, 27 and 19 then Caves 29 and 21, which were excavated concurrently with Caves 20 and 26. Caves 17 and 28 were the last ones to be started.

The later caves, 14, 15 and 16, were constructed during the Rashtrakuta period, some being dated to between the 8th to 10th centuries. Work first began in Caves 14 and 15 with Cave 16, the &quot;world&#x27;s largest single monolith&quot; , that is located in the Kailash temple in Madhya Pradesh,India, being the last of the three to be constructed. These caves were completed in the 8th century with the support of king Krishna I.

===Early Hindu temples: Dhumar Lena, Cave 29===

Construction in the early Hindu caves commenced before any of the Buddhist or Jain caves. These early caves were generally dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva, although the iconography suggests that the artisans gave other gods and goddesses of Hinduism prominent and equal reverence. A common feature of these cave temples was a rock-cut linga-yoni within the core of the shrine with each being surrounded by a space for circumambulation (&quot;parikrama&quot;).

Cave 29, also called &quot;Dhumar Lena&quot;, is one of earliest excavations in Ellora and among the largest. Early Hindu temple building in the cave centred around the &quot;Vale Ganga&quot;, a natural waterfall that was integrated into the monument. The waterfall is visible from a rock carved balcony to the south and has been described as &quot;falling over great Shiva&#x27;s brow&quot;, particularly during monsoon season. The carvings in this cave are larger than life size but, according to author Dhavalikar, they are &quot;corpulent, stumpy with disproportionate limbs&quot; compared to those found in other Ellora caves.

===Rameshwar temple, Cave 21===

Cave 21, also called &quot;Rameshwar Lena&quot;, is another early excavation whose construction has been credited to the Kalachuri dynasty. The cave was completed prior to the ascension of Rashtrakuta dynasty which went on to expand the caves at Ellora.

Although the cave features similar works to those in other Ellora caves, it also has a number of unique pieces, such as those depicting the story of goddess Parvati&#x27;s pursuit of Shiva. Carvings depicting Parvati and Shiva at leisure, Parvati&#x27;s wedding to Shiva, Shiva dancing and Kartikeya (Skanda) have been found in other caves. The cave also features a large display of the Sapta Matrika, the seven mother goddesses of the Shakti tradition of Hinduism, flanked on either side by Ganesha and Shiva. Inside the temple are other goddesses important to Shakti tradition, for example, the Durga. The entrance to Cave 21 is flanked by large sculptures of the goddesses Ganga and Yamuna representing the two major Himalayan rivers and their significance to the Indian culture.

The cave is laid out symmetrically according to the mandapa square principle and has embedded geometric patterns repeated throughout the cave. The Shiva linga at the sanctum sanctorum of the temple is equidistant from the major statues of goddesses Ganga and Yamuna, with all three set in an equilateral triangle. According to Carmel Berkson, this layout likely symbolizes the Brahman–Prakriti relationship, the interdependence of the masculine and the feminine energies, that is central to Hindu theology.

===The Kailāśa temple: Cave 16===


Cave 16, known as the Kailasa temple, is a particularly notable cave temple in India as a result of its size, architecture and having been entirely carved out of a single rock.

The Kailasha temple, inspired by Mount Kailasha, is dedicated to Shiva. It is modeled along similar lines to other Hindu temples with a gateway, an assembly hall, a multi-storey main temple surrounded by numerous shrines laid out according to the square principle, an integrated space for circumambulation, a garbha-grihya (sanctum sanctorum) wherein resides the linga-yoni, and a spire-shaped like Mount Kailash – all carved from one rock. Other shrines carved from the same rock are dedicated to Ganga, Yamuna, Saraswati, the ten avatars of Vishnu, Vedic gods and goddesses including Indra, Agni, Vayu, Surya and Usha, as well as non-Vedic deities like Ganesha, Ardhanarishvara (half Shiva, half Parvati), Harihara (half Shiva, half Vishnu), Annapurna, Durga and others. The basement level of the temple features numerous Shaiva, Vaishnava and Shakti works; a notable set of carvings include the twelve episodes from the childhood of Krishna, an important element of Vaishnavism.
The structure is a freestanding, multi-level temple complex covering an area twice the size of the Parthenon in Athens. It is estimated that the artists removed three million cubic feet of stone, weighing approximately 200,000 tonnes, to excavate the temple.

The construction of the temple has been attributed to the Rashtrakuta king Krishna I (r. 756–773 CE), but elements of Pallava architecture have also been noted. The dimensions of the courtyard are 82 meters by 46 meters at the base, and 30 meters high (280 × 160 × 106 feet). The entrance features a low gopuram. The central shrine housing the lingam features a flat-roofed mandapa supported by 16 pillars, and a Dravidian shikhara. An image of Shiva&#x27;s mount Nandi (the sacred bull) stands on a porch in front of the temple. Two of the walls in the main temple house rows of carvings depicting the Mahabharata, along the north side, and the Ramayana, on the south side.

The Kailasha temple is considered a highly notable example of temple construction from 1st millennium Indian history, and was called, by Carmel Berkson, &quot;a wonder of the world&quot; among rock-cut monuments.

===The Dashavatara: Cave 15===

The &quot;Dashavatara temple&quot;, or Cave 15, is another significant excavation that was completed sometime after Cave 14 (Ravan ki Khai, Hindu). Cave 15 has cells and a layout plan that are similar to Buddhist Caves 11 and 12, which suggests this cave was intended to be a Buddhist cave; however, the presence of non-Buddhist features, such as a &quot;Nrtya Mandapa&quot; (an Indian classical dance pavilion) at its entrance, indicated otherwise. According to James Harle, Hindu images have been found in Buddhist Cave 11, while many Hindu deities have been incorporated in Buddhist caves of the region. This overlap in disparate designs between Buddhist and Hindu caves may be due to the sites being worked on by the same architects and workers, or perhaps a planned Buddhist cave was adapted into a Hindu monument.

According to Geri Malandra, all the Buddhist caves at Ellora were an intrusion in a place that was already an established Brahmanical Tirtha (Hindu pilgrimage site), and not the other way around. Furthermore, given that both the Hindu and Buddhist caves were predominantly anonymous, with no donative inscriptions having been discovered for the Buddhist Ellora caves other than those of Hindu dynasties that built them, the original intent and nature of these cave temples is speculative.
The Hindu temple housed in Cave 15 has an open court with a free-standing monolithic &quot;mandapa&quot; at the middle and a two-storeyed excavated temple at the rear. Large sculptural panels between the wall columns on the upper floor illustrate a wide range of themes, including the ten avatars of Vishnu. An inscription of Dantidurga, critical to establishing the age of the temple, is on the back wall of the front &quot;mandapa&quot;. According to Coomaraswamy, the finest relief of this cave is the one depicting the death of Hiranyakashipu, where Vishnu in man-lion (Narasimha) form, emerges from a pillar to lay a fatal hand upon his shoulder. It is a Rastrakoot dynasty sculpture. Other reliefs in Cave 15 include the Gangadhara, marriage of Shiva and Parvati, Tripurantika of Shakti tradition, Markendeya, Garuda, aspects of life, Nandi in mandapa, dancing Shiva, Andhakasura, Govardhanadhari, Gajendravarada and others. The panels are arranged in dyads, which states Carmel Berkson, reinforce each other by displaying &quot;cooperative but also antagonistic energy&quot; with a mutuality of power transference.

===Other Hindu caves===
Other notable Hindu caves are the &quot;Ravan ki Khai&quot; (Cave 14) and the &quot;Nilkantha&quot; (Cave 22), both of which house numerous sculptures, Cave 25 in particular features a carving of Surya in its ceiling.

==The Buddhist monuments: Caves 1–12==

These caves are located on the southern side and were built either between 630 and 700 CE, or 600–730 CE. It was initially thought that the Buddhist caves were the earliest structures that were created between the fifth and eighth centuries, with caves 1–5 in the first phase (400–600) and 6–12 in the later phase (650–750), but modern scholars now consider the construction of Hindu caves to have been before the Buddhist caves. The earliest Buddhist cave is Cave 6, then 5, 2, 3, 5 (right wing), 4, 7, 8, 10 and 9, with caves 11 and 12, also known as Do Thal and Tin Thal respectively, being the last.
Eleven out of the twelve Buddhist caves consist of &quot;viharas&quot;, or monasteries with prayer halls: large, multi-storeyed buildings carved into the mountain face, including living quarters, sleeping quarters, kitchens, and other rooms. The monastery caves have shrines including carvings of Gautama Buddha, bodhisattvas and saints. In some of these caves, sculptors have endeavoured to give the stone the look of wood.

Caves 5, 10, 11 and 12 are architecturally important Buddhist caves. Cave 5 is unique among the Ellora caves as it was designed as a hall with a pair of parallel refectory benches in the centre and a Buddha statue in the rear. This cave, and Cave 11 of the Kanheri Caves, are the only two Buddhist caves in India arranged in such a way. Caves 1 through 9 are all monasteries while Cave 10, the Vīśvakarmā Cave, is a major Buddhist prayer hall.
Caves 11 and 12 are three-storied Mahayana monastery caves with idols, mandalas carved into the walls, and numerous goddesses, and Bodhisattva-related iconography, belonging to Vajrayana Buddhism. These are compelling evidence to suggest that Vajrayana and Tantra ideas of Buddhism were well established in South Asia by the 8th-century CE.

==The Vishvakarma Cave==
Notable among the Buddhist caves is Cave 10, a chaitya worship hall called the &#x27;Vishvakarma cave&#x27;, built around 650 CE. It is also known as the &quot;Carpenter&#x27;s Cave&quot;, because the rock has been given a finish that has the appearance of wooden beams. Beyond its multi-storeyed entry is a cathedral-like stupa hall also known as &quot;chaitya-griha&quot; (prayer house). At the heart of this cave is a 15-foot statue of Buddha seated in a preaching pose.

Cave 10 combines a &quot;vihara&quot; with a chapel-like worship hall that has eight subsidiary cells, four in the back wall and four in the right, as well as a portico in the front. It is the only dedicated chaitya griha amongst the Buddhist caves and is constructed along similar lines to Caves 19 and 26 of Ajanta. Cave 10 also features a gavaksha, or chandrashala, arched window and a side connection to Cave 9 of Ellora.

The main hall of the Visvakarma cave is apsidal in plan and is divided into a central nave and side aisles by 28 octagonal columns with plain bracket capitals. In the apsidal end of the chaitya hall is a stupa on the face of which a colossal high seated Buddha in &quot;vyakhyana mudra&quot; (teaching posture). A large Bodhi tree is carved at his back. The hall has a vaulted roof in which ribs (known as triforium) have been carved in the rock imitating the wooden ones. The friezes above the pillars are Naga queens, and the extensive relief artwork shows characters such as entertainers, dancers and musicians.

The front of the prayer hall is a rock-cut court entered via a flight of steps. The entrance of the Cave has a carved facade decorated with numerous Indian motifs including apsaras and meditating monks. On either side of the upper level are pillared porticos with small rooms in their back walls. The pillared &quot;verandah&quot; of the &quot;chaitya&quot; has a small shrine at either end and a single cell in the far end of the back wall. The corridor columns have massive squared shafts and &quot;ghata-pallava&quot; (vase and foliage) capitals. The various levels of Cave 10 also feature idols of male and female deities, such as Maitreya, Tara, Avalokitesvara (Vajradhamma), Manjusri, Bhrkuti, and Mahamayuri, carved in the Pala dynasty style found in eastern regions of India. Some southern Indian influences can also be found in various works in this cave.

==The Jain monuments: Caves 30–34==
At the north end of Ellora are the five Jain caves belonging to the Digambara sect, which were excavated in the ninth and early tenth centuries. These caves are smaller than the Buddhist and Hindu caves but nonetheless feature highly detailed carvings. They, and the later-era Hindu caves, were built at a similar time and both share architectural and devotional ideas such as a pillared veranda, symmetric mandapa and &quot;puja&quot; (worship). However, unlike the Hindu temples, emphasis is placed on the depiction of the twenty-four Jinas (spiritual conquerors who have gained liberation from the endless cycle of rebirths). In addition to these Jinas, the works at the Jain temples include carvings of gods and goddesses, &quot;yaksa&quot; (male nature deity), &quot;yaksi&quot; (female nature deity) and human devotees prevalent in Jain mythology of 1st millennium CE.
According to Jose Pereira, the five caves were actually 23 distinct excavations, over different periods. A 13 of these are in Indra Sabha, 6 in Jagannatha Sabha and rest in the Chhota Kailash. Pareira used numerous sources to conclude that the Jain caves at Ellora likely began in the late 8th century, with construction and excavation activity extending beyond the 10th century and into the 13th century before coming to a halt with the invasion of the region by the Delhi Sultanate. This is evidenced by votive inscriptions dated to 1235 CE, where the donor states to have &quot;converted Charanadri into a holy &quot;tirtha&quot;&quot; for Jains by gifting the excavation of lordly Jinas.

Particularly important Jain shrines are the &quot;Chhota Kailash&quot; (cave 30, 4 excavations), the &quot;Indra Sabha&quot; (cave 32, 13 excavations) and the &quot;Jagannath Sabha&quot; (cave 33, 4 excavations); cave 31 is an unfinished four-pillared hall, and shrine. Cave 34 is a small cave, which can be accessed through an opening in the left side of Cave 33.

The Jain caves contain some of the earliest &quot;Samavasarana&quot; images among its devotional carvings. The Samavasarana is of particular importance to Jains being the hall where the Tirthankara preaches after attaining &quot;Kevala Jnana&quot; (liberating omniscience). Another interesting feature found in these caves is the pairing of sacred figures in Jainism, specifically Parsvanatha and Bahubali, which appear 19 times. Other artworks of significance include those of deities Sarasvati, Sri, Saudharmendra, Sarvanubhuti, Gomukha, Ambika, Cakresvari, Padmavati, Ksetrapala and Hanuman.

===Chhota Kailasha: Cave 30===

The Chhota Kailasha, or the little Kailasha, is so named due to the similarity of the carvings to those in the Kailasha temple. This temple was likely built in the early 9th century, concurrent with the construction of the lower level of the Indra Sabha, some decades after the completion of the Kailasha Temple. It features two larger-than-life size reliefs of dancing Indra, one with eight arms and another with twelve, both adorned with ornaments and a crown; Indra&#x27;s arms are shown in various mudra reminiscent of the dancing Shiva artworks found in nearby Hindu caves. However, the iconography has several differences that indicate this cave shows a dancing Indra and not a dancing Shiva. The Indra panels at the entrance also feature other deities, celestials, musicians and dancers.

Art historian Lisa Owen has raised questions concerning whether music and dance were part of 9th-century Jainism, given that Jain theology focuses on meditative asceticism. Rajan, for example, has proposed that Cave 30 May have originally been a Hindu monument that was later converted into a Jain temple. However, Owen suggests that the celebration-filled artwork in this temple is better understood as part of the &quot;Samavasarana&quot; doctrine in Jainism.

The overlap between Jain and Hindu mythologies has caused confusion, given Book Three of the Hindu Mahabharata describes Indra&#x27;s abode as one filled with a variety of heroes, courtesans, and artisans, within a paradise-like setting. This imagery is repeated throughout Cave 30, similar to the Hindu caves, setting the context of the temple. However, the symbolism closer to the centre of the temple is more aligned with the core ideas of Jainism; a greater prevalence of meditating images and Jinas – the place where the Jain devotee would perform his or her ritual &quot;abhisheka&quot; (worship).

===Cave 31===

Cave 31, consisting of four pillars, a small shrine a number of carvings, was not completed. Carvings of Parshvanatha, guarded by yaksha Dharanendra with his 7 hoods, and Gommateshvara were made into the left and right walls of the hall, respectively, while within the shrine resides an idol of Vardhamana Mahavir Swami. The idol is seated in a padmasan position on a lion-throne and a chakra is seen in the middle panel of the throne. The figure of yaksha &quot;Matanga&quot; on an elephant is on the left side of shrine while one of yakshi &quot;Siddhaiki&quot;, seated in savya-lalitasana on a lion with a child on her lap, is on the right.

===The Indra Sabha: Cave 32===
The &quot;Indra Sabha&quot; (Cave 32), excavated in the 9th century, is a two-storey cave with a monolithic shrine in its court. 19th-century historians confused the Jain Yaksas for alternate images of Indra that were found in Buddhist and Hindu artworks, thus leading to the temple being given the misnomer &quot;Indra Sabha&quot;. Indra is an important deity in all three major religions, but is of particular importance in Jainism as not only is he one of 64 deities who reign over the heavens, he is, specifically, the king of the first Jain heaven, &quot;Saudharmakalpa&quot;, and the chief architect of the celestial assembly hall according to the &quot;Adipurana&quot;, a Jain holy text.

The Indra Sabha Jain temple is historically significant as it contains evidence, in the form of layered deposits and textual records, of active worship inside by the Jain community. In particular, rituals were known to have been held in the upper level, where the artwork may have played a central role.

As with many caves in Ellora, numerous carvings adorn the temple, such as those of the lotus flower on the ceiling. On the upper level of the shrine, excavated at the rear of the court, is an image of Ambika, the yakshini of Neminath, seated on her lion under a mango tree, laden with fruit. The centre of the shrine presents &quot;Sarvatobhadra&quot;, where four Tirthankaras of Jainism – Rshibha (1st), Neminatha (22nd), Parsvanatha (23rd) and Mahavira (24th) are aligned to the cardinal directions, forming a place of worship for devotees.

===The Jagannatha Sabha: Cave 33===
The &quot;Jagannatha Sabha&quot; (Cave 33) is the second-largest Jain cave at Ellora and dates to the 9th century according to the inscriptions on the pillars. It is a two-storeyed cave with twelve massive pillars and elephant heads projecting towards a porch, all carved from a single rock. The hall has two heavy square pillars in front, four in the middle area, and a pillared interior square principal hall with fluted shafts, all intricately carved with capitals, ridges and brackets. Inside the major idols are of Parshvanatha and Mahavira, the last two Tirthankaras in Jainism.

===Cave 34===
Certain inscriptions in Cave 34, or J26 according to historian José Pereira, are not deciphered as yet but were likely to have been executed between 800 and 850 CE. Other inscriptions, such as the one by Sri Nagavarma, are thought to date from the 9th or 10th century.

This cave features a large seated Parshvanatha Jina with four &quot;camara&quot; attendants, two of whom hold fly-whisks and seemingly emerge from the back of the Jina&#x27;s throne. As with many other Jain excavations, a large pair of &quot;yaksa-yaksi&quot; is also found in this cave near the Jina. In the back of the cave is a bearded figure with a bowl containing round sacrificial offerings, which have shapes reminiscent of &quot;pindas&quot; (rice balls) or &quot;laddus&quot; (sweetmeat). This suggests the scene may be related to Jain devotional worship, possibly a &quot;shraddha&quot; ceremony. The Parshvanatha in the cave is paired with a standing Gommateshvara, and accompanied by other carvings showing musicians playing a variety of instruments such as horns, drums, conchs, trumpets, and cymbals. A particularly notable feature of the cave is a giant, open lotus carving on its ceiling and rooftop, which is found in only one other Jain excavation and one Hindu Cave 25 in all of Ellora. The placement of the lotus on the cave rather than a sculpture symbolizes that the temple is a divine place.

===Rock carved image of Lord Parshvanath===
On the hill to the northeast of the main complex of caves is a Jain temple containing a rock-carved image of Lord Parshvanath from the Rashtrakuta period with an inscription dated 1234 A.D. The well-preserved image is flanked by Dharaıendra and Padmavati. The inscription mentions the site as Charana Hill, a holy site. It is still in active worship and thus not protected by the ASI. Six hundred steps must be climbed to reach it. It is managed by a Jain Gurukul in the village.

==Visitors, desecration and damage==
There have been several records written in the centuries following their completion indicating that these caves were visited regularly, particularly as it was within sight of a trade route; for example, Ellora was known to have been frequented by Buddhist monks in the 9th and 10th centuries. It is mistakenly referred to by the 10th-century Baghdad resident Al-Mas‘udi as &quot;Aladra&quot;, site of a great temple, a place of Indian pilgrimage and one with thousands of cells where devotees live; in 1352 CE, the records of Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah mention him camping at the site. Other records were written by Firishta, Thevenot (1633–67), Niccolao Manucci (1653–1708), Charles Warre Malet (1794), and Seely (1824). Some accounts acknowledge the importance of Ellora but make inaccurate statements regarding its construction; for example, a description of the caves by Venetian traveller Niccolao Manucci, whose Mughal history was well received in France, wrote that the Ellora caves &quot;...were executed by the ancient Chinese&quot; based on his assessment of the workmanship and what he had been told. Ellora was a well-known site in Mughal times: the emperor Aurangzeb used to picnic there with his family, as did other Mughal nobles. Mustaid Khan, a courtier of Aurangzeb, stated that people visited the area in all seasons but especially during the monsoon. He also spoke of &quot;many kinds of images with lifelike forms&quot; carved on all the ceilings and walls, but noted that the monuments themselves were in a state of &quot;desolation in spite of its strong foundations.&quot;
The &quot;Lilacharitra&quot;, a Marathi text dated to the late 13th century CE, is the first report stating that active use of Ellora ceased in the 13th century. Islamic court records indicated that Deogiri, the capital of the Yadava dynasty, and about 10 kilometres from Ellora, had come under sustained attack during this period and subsequently fell to the Delhi Sultanate in 1294 CE. According to José Pereira, there is evidence that work in the Jain caves at Ellora had flourished under Singhana, who ruled the Yadava dynasty between ~1200 and 1247 CE, and these caves were in use by Jain visitors and worshippers into the 13th century. However, Jain religious activity ceased after the region came under Islamic rule in the late 13th century.

The Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain monuments at Ellora show substantial damage, particularly to the idols, whereas intricate carvings on the pillars, and of natural objects on the walls, remain intact. The desecration of idols and images was traced to the 15th to 17th centuries when this region of the Deccan peninsula was subjected to iconoclasm by Muslim armies. According to Geri Malandra, such devastation by Muslims stemmed from the perceived offense caused by &quot;the graphic, anthropomorphic imagery of Hindu and Buddhist shrines&quot;. Muslim historians of the Islamic Sultanate period mention Ellora in their descriptions of the widespread damage and fanatical destruction of idols and artwork of the region, with some Muslims of this era being known to have expressed concern regarding the wanton damage and &quot;deplored it as a violation of beauty&quot;, according to Carl Ernst.

==Ellora inscriptions==

Several inscriptions at Ellora date from the 6th century onwards, the best known of which is an inscription by Rashtrakuta Dantidurga (c. 753–757 CE) on the back wall of the front mandapa of Cave 15 stating that he had offered prayers at that temple. Jagannatha Sabha, Jain cave 33, has 3 inscriptions that give the names of monks and donors, while a Parshvanath temple on the hill has a 1247 CE inscription that gives the name of a donor from Vardhanapura.

The Great Kailasa temple (Cave 16) is attributed to Krishna I (c. 757–783 CE), the successor and uncle of Dantidurga. A copper plate inscription found in Baroda, Gujarat, states that a great edifice was built on a hill by Krishnaraja at Elapura (Ellora):

==Painted carvings and paintings==
The carvings at Ellora were at one time profusely painted. The rock was covered with a lime plaster which was painted. The plaster and the paint has survived in places.

==In popular culture==
The famous Bengali filmmaker (and author) Satyajit Ray wrote the crime thriller novel &quot;Kailashey Kelenkari&quot; in 1974, featuring fictional detective Feluda. In the novel, Feluda travels to the Ellora caves to uncover a smuggling racket involving illegal trade of historical artifacts from Indian temples, including the largest cave at Ellora, the Kailasa Temple. Satyajit&#x27;s son Sandip Ray adapted the novel into a movie of the same name in 2007.

==In art and literature==
Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1832 contains a plate of &#x27;Skeletal Group in the Ramedwur, Caves of Ellora, supposed to represent the nuptials of Siva and Parvati&#x27; by George Cattermole, engraved by W. Kelsall, accompanied by a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon paraphrased from a translation from the Siva-Pooraun. This is from cave 21.

<text>The Rajdhani Express () is a series of passenger train services in India operated by Indian Railways connecting the national capital New Delhi with the capitals or the largest cities of various states. &quot;Rajdhani&quot;, derived from the Sanskrit means &quot;capital&quot;. Introduced in 1969, the trains are amongst the premium services operated by Indian Railways and regularly get a higher priority on the railway network.

== History ==
In 1960, the Railway Board of India commissioned a study to increase the speed of its trains, which was restricted to on the existent broad gauge lines. A target of with an intermediate stage of was set for passenger trains. Research Design and Standards Organisation (RDSO) started work on the same in 1962 with field trials commencing in 1967. The coaches were manufactured by the Integral Coach Factory at Madras and hauled by diesel locomotives.

On 19 February 1969, the Government of India introduced a new express train capable of reaching speeds of up to as announced in the railway budget. On 1 March 1969, the first Rajdhani Express with nine coaches was flagged off from New Delhi to Howrah with the return journey commencing on 3 March. The train completed the trip in 17 hours 20 minutes and was the only such train in operation till 1972, when the second Rajdhani was introduced from Mumbai. 

&quot;Rajdhani&quot;, derived from the Sanskrit means &quot;capital&quot; and later, with subsequent up-gradation of the tracks, new Rajdhani expresses were introduced connecting major cities with the capital New Delhi.

== Rake ==
Rajdhani trains have fully air-conditioned coaches that have to be reserved in advance. While the trains initially had chair car coaches, now the trains exclusively have sleeper coaches in three configurations: first class, two-tier and three-tier. The first class has dedicated coupes, two-tier with open bays containing six berths per bay (four berths in two tiers and two on the side of the aisle) with curtains and three-tier with open bays containing eight berths per bay (six berths in two tiers and two berths on the side of the aisle). The coaches were exclusively manufactured by Integral Coach Factory at Chennai till 2006, when LHB coaches manufactured by Rail Coach Factory, Kapurthala were introduced. , each train-set costs . While the trains are capable of running at higher speeds, the maximum speed is often limited to with the fastest Rajdhani permitted to reach a maximum speed of and average speeds being much lesser due to traffic congestion and lack of supporting tracks. The Rajdhani express trains are usually hauled by WAP-7 electric locomotives.

== Services ==
The trains are amongst the premium services operated by Indian Railways and regularly gets a higher priority on the railway network. Passengers are served optional meals by Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC), the menu of which could include morning tea, breakfast, lunch, high tea and dinner depending on the duration and timing. These trains have fewer halts than other express trains with stoppages only at prominent stations. Dynamic pricing is applicable on fares across all Rajdhani trains.

<doc id="404256" wikidata="Q1352215" url="?curid=404256" title="Polish–Russian War of 1792">
<text>The Polish–Russian War of 1792 (also, War of the Second Partition, and in Polish sources, War in Defence of the Constitution) was fought between the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth on one side, and the Targowica Confederation (conservative nobility of the Commonwealth opposed to the new Constitution of 3 May 1791) and the Russian Empire under Catherine the Great on the other.

The war took place in two theaters: a northern in Lithuania and a southern in what is now Ukraine. In both, the Polish forces retreated before the numerically superior Russian forces, though they offered significantly more resistance in the south, thanks to the effective leadership of Polish commanders Prince Józef Poniatowski and Tadeusz Kościuszko. During the three-month-long struggle several battles were fought, but no side scored a decisive victory. The largest success of the Polish forces was the defeat of one of the Russian formations at the Battle of Zieleńce on 18 June; in the aftermath of the battle the Polish highest military award, Virtuti Militari, was established. The Russians&#x27; greatest success in this war was the Battle of Mir on 11 June (O.S. 31 May). The war ended when the Polish King Stanisław August Poniatowski decided to seek a diplomatic solution, asked for a ceasefire with the Russians and joined the Targowica Confederation, as demanded by the Russian Empire.

==Background==
===Decline of the Commonwealth===
By the early 18th century, the magnates of Poland and Lithuania controlled the state – or rather, they managed to ensure that no reforms would be carried out that might weaken their privileged status (the &quot;Golden Freedoms&quot;). Through the abuse of the &quot;liberum veto&quot; rule which enabled any deputy to paralyze the Sejm (Commonwealth&#x27;s parliament) proceedings, deputies bribed by magnates or foreign powers or those simply content to believe they were living in an unprecedented &quot;Golden Age&quot;, paralysed the Commonwealth&#x27;s government for over a century.

The idea of reforming the Commonwealth gained traction from the mid-17th century; it was however viewed with suspicion not only by its magnates but also by neighboring countries, which had been content with the deterioration of the Commonwealth and abhorred the thought of a resurgent and democratic power on their borders. With the Commonwealth Army reduced to around 16,000, it was easy for its neighbors to intervene directly (The Imperial Russian Army numbered 300,000 troops overall; The Prussian Army and Imperial Army of the Holy Roman Empire, 200,000 each).

===Attempts at reform===
A major opportunity for reform presented itself during the &quot;Great Sejm&quot; of 1788–92. Poland&#x27;s neighbors were preoccupied with wars and unable to intervene forcibly in Polish affairs. The Russian Empire and Archduchy of Austria were engaged in hostilities with the Ottoman Empire (the Russo-Turkish War, 1787–1792 and the Austro-Turkish War, 1787–1791); the Russians also found themselves simultaneously fighting in the Russo-Swedish War, 1788–1790. A new alliance between the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Prussia seeming to provide security against Russian intervention, and on 3 May 1791 the new constitution was read and adopted to overwhelming popular support.

With the wars between Turkey and Russia and Sweden and Russia having ended, Tsarina Catherine was furious over the adoption of the document, which she believed threatened Russian influence in Poland. Russia had viewed Poland as a &quot;de facto&quot; protectorate. &quot;The worst possible news have arrived from Warsaw: the Polish king has become almost sovereign&quot; was the reaction of one of Russia&#x27;s chief foreign policy authors, Alexander Bezborodko, when he learned of the new constitution. The Kingdom of Prussia was also strongly opposed to the new Polish constitution, and Polish diplomats received a note that the new constitution changed the Polish state so much that Prussia did not consider its obligations binding. Just like Russia, Prussia was concerned that the newly strengthened Polish state could become a threat and the Prussian Foreign Minister, Friedrich Wilhelm von Schulenburg-Kehnert, clearly and with rare candor told Poles that Prussia did not support the constitution and refused to help the Commonwealth in any form, even as a mediator, as it was not in Prussia&#x27;s interest to see the Commonwealth strengthened so that it could threaten Prussia in the future. The Prussian statesman Ewald Friedrich von Hertzberg expressed the fears of European conservatives: &quot;The Poles have given the &quot;coup de grâce&quot; to the Prussian monarchy by voting a constitution&quot;, elaborating that a strong Commonwealth would likely demand the return of the lands Prussia acquired in the First Partition.

The Constitution was not adopted without dissent in the Commonwealth itself, either. Magnates who had opposed the constitution draft from the start, namely Franciszek Ksawery Branicki, Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki, Seweryn Rzewuski, and Szymon and Józef Kossakowski, asked Tsarina Catherine to intervene and restore their privileges such as the Russian-guaranteed Cardinal Laws abolished under the new statute. To that end these magnates formed the Targowica Confederation. The Confederation&#x27;s proclamation, prepared in Saint Petersburg in January 1792, criticized the constitution for contributing to, in their own words, &quot;contagion of democratic ideas&quot; following &quot;the fatal examples set in Paris&quot;. It asserted that &quot;The parliament ... has broken all fundamental laws, swept away all liberties of the gentry and on the third of May 1791 turned into a revolution and a conspiracy.&quot; The Confederates declared an intention to overcome this revolution. We &quot;can do nothing but turn trustingly to Tsarina Catherine, a distinguished and fair empress, our neighboring friend and ally&quot;, who &quot;respects the nation&#x27;s need for well-being and always offers it a helping hand&quot;, they wrote. The Confederates aligned with Tsarina Catherine and asked her for military intervention. On 18 May 1792, the Russian ambassador to Poland, Yakov Bulgakov, delivered a declaration of war to the Polish Foreign Minister Joachim Chreptowicz. Russian armies entered Poland and Lithuania on the same day, starting the war.

==Opposing forces==

The Russian army numbered nearly 98,000. It was commanded by generals-in-chief Mikhail Krechetnikov and Mikhail Kakhovsky. The Russians also had an advantage in combat experience. The Russian plan called for Kakhovsky to advance through Ukraine, taking Kamieniec Podolski, Chełm and Lublin, and approach Polish capital of Warsaw from the south. Krechetnikov was to advance through Minsk, Wilno, Brześć Litewski and Białystok, and approach Warsaw from the north, where he was to link with Kakhovsky. Whereas the Russians had good intelligence network in Poland, and were mostly aware of Polish army distribution and strength; the Poles had much less intelligence, receiving contradictory and often erroneous reports, and unsure whether the war would even start up to the point the Russian troops crossed the border.

Stanisław August Poniatowski, King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, was the commander-in-chief of the Polish forces, but in practice he delegated this position to his nephew, Prince Józef Poniatowski. Poniatowski had in theory at his disposal a 48,000 strong Crown army and the Lithuanian army more than half that size to confront them. In practice, Polish forces, still forming following the reforms of the Constitution of 3 May (which specified an army size of 100,000) numbered only 37,000. The army was reorganizing, with key documents on unit numbers and composition passed as recently as in April; it was also short on equipment and experienced personnel.

In the southeast corner of the country – the Ukrainian lands – the Polish forces were initially concentrated separately in three regions of the expected front, under Tadeusz Kościuszko, Michał Wielhorski and Prince Poniatowski himself. The Polish Crown army in Ukraine, led by Prince Poniatowski, and supported by Kościuszko, was about 17,000, 21,000 or 24,000 strong (Derdej distinguishes between the primary force of 17,000 and Prince Michał Lubomirski&#x27;s reserve division, of 4,500). In the southeastern war theater, they faced a nearly four times larger enemy army under General Mikhail Kakhovsky, who had about 64,000 men under his command. Kakhovsky&#x27;s forces were divided into four corps: 1st, 18,000 strong, under the command of General Mikhail Golenishchev-Kutuzov, 2nd, under General Ivan Dunin, 3rd, under General Wilhelm Derfelden, and 4th, under General Andrei Levanidov. The Targowica Confederates did not represent any real strength; and their attempts to gather popular support in Poland upon crossing borders failed miserably, with only few dozens joining at first; later the number would grow but not significantly, and even the Russians saw them as not having any military value, keeping them from the frontlines.

In Lithuania, the Commonwealth Lithuanian Army numbered about 15,000, with an additional Crown detachment of about 3,000. They were commanded by Duke Louis of Württemberg. Württemberg made no plans for the war, and the troops were not readied for action by the time the war started. The Russian army in that theatre under General Mikhail Krechetnikov was 33,700 strong or 38,000 strong. The Russian army was also divided into four corps: 1st under one of Targowica Confederate leaders, Szymon Kossakowski 7,300 strong, 2nd under General Boris Mellin, 7,000 strong, 3rd under General Yuri Dolgorukov, 15,400 strong, and 4th under General Ivan Fersen, 8,300 strong.

Additional Polish forces, about 8,000 strong, were to concentrate in Warsaw under the command of King Poniatowski as a reserve.

Tadeusz Kościuszko proposed a plan where the entire Polish army would be concentrated and would engage one of the Russian armies, to assure numerical parity and to boost the morale of mostly inexperienced Polish forces with a quick victory; this plan was however rejected by Prince Poniatowski. (Only a few months before, however, both commanders had the opposite idea – Poniatowski wanted the troops concentrated, and Kościuszko, dispersed). Poniatowski also planned to avoid serious engagements in the first phase of the war, hoping to receive the expected Prussian reinforcements of 30,000 which would bring parity to the two sides.

==War==
===Southern theater===
The first Russian forces crossed the border in Ukraine on the night of 18/19 May 1792. The Russians in that theater would encounter significantly more resistance than they expected, as Commonwealth&#x27;s top commanders, Prince Poniatowski and Kościuszko were stationed there. Kościuszko joined Prince Poniatowski near Janów on 29 May. The Crown Army was judged too weak to oppose the four columns of enemy armies advancing into West Ukraine and began a fighting withdrawal to the western side of the Southern Bug River, towards Lubar and Połonne, with Kośiuszko commanding the rear guard. Poniatowski, in the face of significant numerical inferiority of his forces, and promised reinforcements by King Poniatowski, decided to abandon Ukraine and move to Volhynia, where Połonne was to be fortified as a major defensive point, and where Lubomirski was tasked with gathering supplies.
On 14 June Wielhorski&#x27;s unit was defeated at the Battle of Boruszkowce. On 17 June Poniatowski finally received awaited reinforcements, about 2,000 troops led by Michał Lubomirski. Next day the Poles, led by Prince Poniatowski, defeated one of the Russian formations of general Irakly Morkov at the Battle of Zieleńce on 18 June. The victory was celebrated by King Poniatowski, who sent the new Virtuti Militari medals for the campaign leaders and soldiers, as &quot;the first since John III Sobieski&quot;.

The Russian forces, however, kept advancing. Under the command of Józef Poniatowski, the Polish army retreated in good order, yielding to the more powerful enemy as necessary to avoid annihilation. In early July, near Dubno, Prince Poniatowski and Kościuszko were betrayed by Michał Lubomirski, who was tasked with King Poniatowski with resupplying the troops; instead Lubomirski joined the Russian side and either hid the supplies for the Polish army, or outright passed them to the Russians. Lubomirski, however, was a powerful magnate, and it took until late May for the King officially to relieve him of his command. Within about a month of the Russian invasion, the Poles had mostly retreated from Ukraine. On 7 July Kościuszko&#x27;s forces fought a delaying battle with the Russians at Volodymyr-Volynskyi (Battle of Włodzimierz). Meanwhile, Poniatowski&#x27;s army retreated to the Bug River, where Kościuszko&#x27;s units on 18 July fought the Battle of Dubienka, which was a draw. With about 5,300 troops Kościuszko defeated the attack of 25,000 Russians under General Mikhail Kakhovsky. Kośicuszko then had to retreat from Dubienka, as the Russians begun flanking his positions crossing the nearby Austrian border. Although the Poles had to retreat from the Bug River line, they were not defeated so far, and a decisive battle or battles at more favorable locations closer to Warsaw were expected.

===Northern theater===
In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania the Russians crossed the Commonwealth border four days later than in the south, on 22 May. Poland&#x27;s ally, the Kingdom of Prussia, broke its alliance with Poland and the Prussian commander of the Lithuanian army, Duke Württemberg, betrayed the Polish-Lithuanian cause by refusing to fight the Russians. He never reached the frontlines, feigned illness in Wołczyn, and issued contradictory orders to his troops.

Thus the Army of Lithuania did little to oppose the advancing Russians, and kept withdrawing before their advance. Minsk was abandoned, after some skirmishes, on 31 May. Only after a change of commander on 4 June, did the Army, now under General Józef Judycki, try to stand and fight the Russians. The Russians however defeated Judycki at the Battle of Mir on 11 June and kept advancing through the Grand Duchy. The Commonwealth army retreated towards Grodno. On 14 June the Russians took Wilno, after only a small skirmish with local garrison; on 19 June, incompetently defended Nieśwież; and on 20 June, Kaunas, this time without any opposition. Judycki, disgraced, was replaced by Michał Zabiełło on 23 June. Nonetheless, since Mir, no decisive engagements occurred in the northern theater, as Polish army withdrew in relative order towards Warsaw, after minor defeat at Zelva, eventually taking defensive positions along the Bug river near Brest. Russians took Grodno on 5 July and Białystok on 17 July. On 23 July the Russians took Brest, defeating the local garrison, but on 24 they were defeated near Krzemień-Wieś; this last battle was the first significant Commonwealth victory on the northern front.

===War ends===
While Prince Poniatowski and Kościuszko considered the outcome of the war still open and were planning to use the combined Polish-Lithuanian forces to defeat the still separate Russian forces, King Poniatowski, with the consent of the Guardians of the Laws (cabinet of ministers) decided to ask for a ceasefire. Tsarina Catherine demanded that King Poniatowski join the pro-Russian aristocratic faction, the Targowica Confederation; with his cabinet split, he gave in to her demand around 22–23 July, which effectively forced Prince Poniatowski to terminate military resistance. The last military confrontation of the war was fought on 26 July at Markuszów in Lublin province, where an enemy attack was repelled by Polish cavalry led by Poniatowski.

At the time King Poniatowski decided to sue for peace, the Polish army was still in a good fighting condition not having suffered from any major defeat nor lack of supplies. King Poniatowski thought that due to Russian numerical superiority defeat was nonetheless imminent, and more could be gained through negotiations with the Russians, with whom he hoped a new alliance could be formed. Although subsequent events would prove him wrong, the question of whether this could have been foreseen, and prevented through continued military resistance, has been subject to much debate among historians.

The Polish military was widely dissatisfied with the ceasefire; Kościuszko, Prince Poniatowski and many others would criticize the King&#x27;s decision and many, including Kościuszko, would resign their commission in the coming weeks. Prince Poniatowski even considered rebelling against his uncle&#x27;s orders, and even issued orders to bring the King to the army&#x27;s camp by force if necessary, as was postulated by the more radical faction. Ultimately he decided not to continue fighting against his uncle&#x27;s will, and the order was rescinded at the last moment before the departure of the group charged with capturing the King.

==Aftermath==
Most Polish historians agree that the Polish capitulation was a mistake both from the military perspective, and the political one. In the realm of military, the Poles had reasonable chances to defend the Vistula river line, and exhaust the Russian invading forces. From the political one, showing a willingness to fight could have persuaded the partitioning powers that their plan was too costly.

King Poniatowski&#x27;s hopes that the capitulation would allow an acceptable diplomatic solution to be worked out were soon dashed. With new deputies bribed or intimidated by the Russian troops, a new session of parliament, known as the Grodno Sejm, took place in fall 1793. On 23 November 1793, it concluded its deliberations under duress, annulling the constitution and acceding to the Second Partition. Russia took of the Commonwealth&#x27;s territory, while Prussia took . This event reduced Poland&#x27;s population to a third of what it was before the First Partition. The rump state was garrisoned by Russian troops and its independence was strongly curtailed.

This outcome came as a surprise to most of the Targowica Confederates, who had wished only to restore the status quo ante bellum (Commonwealth magnate-favoring Golden Freedoms) and had expected that the overthrow of the 3 May Constitution would achieve that end, and nothing more. The last bid to restore the reformed Commonwealth came with the Kościuszko Uprising in 1794. The uprising failed and resulted in the Third Partition in 1795, in which the country lost all its remaining territories and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ceased to exist.

<doc id="404260" wikidata="Q3550487" url="?curid=404260" title="Hyperion (comics)">
<text>Hyperion is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, of which there are several notable versions. Created by writer Roy Thomas and artist Sal Buscema, the original Hyperion made his debut in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #69 (October 1969). The alternate versions are each from a different dimension of the Marvel Multiverse, and consist of both heroes and villains. Thomas says that the character was intended as a pastiche of DC&#x27;s iconic hero Superman.

The first Hyperion, Zhib-Ran, was a member of Squadron Sinister, a team that the Grandmaster created to fight against a team of Avengers gathered by the time travelling Kang. Two years after the character&#x27;s first appearance, a heroic version appeared as one of the founding members of the alternate-reality Squadron Supreme. This incarnation of the character was a major character in the 1985 series &quot;Squadron Supreme&quot;, which fleshed out the characterization of Hyperion and the other Squadron Supreme members. In 2003, Marvel Comics launched &quot;Supreme Power&quot;, a new take on the Squadron Supreme universe, where Hyperion is raised by the United States government to be a super-powered operative. Yet another alternate Hyperion joined the Avengers and later the Squadron Supreme from Earth-616.

==Creation== 
Thomas spoke in depth on the character&#x27;s creation stating, &quot;The first of the 4 members of the Squadron Sinister I designed for THE AVENGERS, to be an evil counterpart of Superman, kind of a parody/homage. I took the name from the Greek sun god, by way of the Shakespearean quote from &quot;Hamlet&quot;: &quot;...that was to this, Hyperion to a satyr.&quot; I made sure that every costume line on Hyperion was different from those on Superman... boots, belt, length of sleeves, face mask, etc. And I gave him a cape that only attached to one shoulder, after the look of a 1940s character called Dyna-Man in a Harry Chesler comic.&quot;

==Publication history== 
The first iteration of Hyperion, created by Roy Thomas and Sal Buscema, debuted in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #69 as a member of the Squadron Sinister. 

Two years later, Thomas and penciller John Buscema created an alternate, heroic version of the Squadron Sinister called the Squadron Supreme, once again in the title &quot;The Avengers&quot;, using characters with the same names as those of the Squadron Sinister (this caused confusion in Marvel&#x27;s production department, as the covers of &quot;The Avengers&quot; #85 and #141 claimed the issues featured appearances by the Squadron Sinister when it was in fact the Squadron Supreme that appeared in both issues). In the 12-issue &quot;Squadron Supreme&quot; limited series (Sept. 1985-Aug. 1986) Mark Gruenwald picked up from where Earth-712 was last seen in &quot;The Defenders&quot; #114 and revealed this Hyperion&#x27;s origins.

The character is re-imagined for Marvel&#x27;s MAX imprint title &quot;Supreme Power&quot;, where he is an alien who has been raised by the government. This iteration received a spinoff miniseries, &quot;Supreme Power: Hyperion&quot;, which showed a dystopian possible future.

Another Hyperion joins the Avengers in Jonathan Hickman&#x27;s &quot;The Avengers&quot; vol. 5 #1 (Dec. 2012). Hickman described the decision to use a new Hyperion, rather than an existing one:

This is yet another parallel universe Hyperion. This is not King Hyperion, or Supreme Power Hyperion, this is not Gruenwald&#x27;s Hyperion. This is Hyperion without all that baggage. This is Hyperion with a fresh slate, for a very specific purpose. He comes out of what the big story is behind the whole Avengers three-year plan that I have. He&#x27;s very important, very pivotal, and I think people are really going to dig where we go with that. He&#x27;s not going to be our poor analogue for Superman.

A pastiche of Hyperion, &quot;Hyperius&quot;, appears in DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Final Crisis&quot; and &quot;The Multiversity&quot;, part of a group of recursive homages to other companies&#x27; pastiches of DC characters.

==Fictional character biography==
===Squadron Sinister===
The Squadron Sinister are assembled by the cosmic entity the Grandmaster to battle the champions of the time-traveling Kang the Conqueror, the superhero team the Avengers. Hyperion (Zhib-Ran) is apparently brought from a microverse. The Avengers defeat the Squadron and thwart the Grandmaster, with Thor shrinking Hyperion and trapping him in a glass sphere. The Squadron reappears in the title Defenders, reunited by the alien Nebulon. The villains receive greater power in exchange for the planet Earth, and create a giant laser cannon in the Arctic to melt the polar ice caps, which would cover the entire planet in water. The superhero team the Defenders prevent the scheme and defeat the villains (and Nebulon), with the Hulk overpowering Hyperion. After this defeat Hyperion and his two remaining teammates are teleported off world by Nebulon, and later return to Earth. Acquiring an energy-draining weapon, the villains plan to threaten the Earth once again but are defeated by the Defenders and the Avenger Yellowjacket.

The character battles Thor once again and encounters the Earth-712 version of Hyperion. He becomes involved with Thundra, but the relationship ends when she discovers a means of returning to her own dimension. The Earth-712 Master Menace transports Hyperion to his universe and informs him that he is an inorganic duplicate created by the Grandmaster modeled on the Earth-712 Hyperion. The Squadron Sinister Hyperion then impersonates the Squadron Supreme Hyperion for several weeks before dying in battle against the original. The Grandmaster briefly resurrects the character as part of a group called the Legion of the Unliving to combat the Avengers.

A new Hyperion is made when the Grandmaster reforms the Squadron Sinister. He is joined by a new Doctor Spectrum (Alice Nugent, former lab assistant of Henry Pym); the Whizzer (now called Speed Demon), and Nighthawk. This Hyperion originated from the Microverse, as the original Hyperion had believed himself to have been. The Grandmaster increases the Squadron Sinister&#x27;s powers and they battle the New Thunderbolts. Thunderbolts team leader Baron Zemo defeats the Grandmaster, and in the ensuing chaos Hyperion and his teammates scatter and escape.

===Squadron Supreme (Earth-712)===
Hyperion, also known as Mark Milton, is a founding member of his reality&#x27;s Squadron Supreme and the last known Eternal left on his Earth. Four Avengers from the Earth-616 universe accidentally arrive in this Squadron&#x27;s reality, and the two groups first battle and then work together to stop the global threat posed by the mutant Brain-Child.

Hyperion and the Squadron Supreme are manipulated by the Serpent Crown into battling the Avengers. The Defenders travel to their world to fight the villain Overmind and his ally Null, the Living Darkness, who have placed the Squadron under their control.

Following the societal instability caused by Overmind&#x27;s takeover of the planet, Hyperion and other Squadron members resolve, against their teammate Nighthawk&#x27;s advice, to assume control of their United States government, instituting programs aimed at increasing quality of life; for instance Hyperion helps establish a behavior modification program, which the team uses to brainwash the Institute of Evil and numerous other criminals. He becomes trapped in an inter-dimensional zone and is impersonated by the Squadron Sinister Hyperion (Zhib-Ran). Forced to ally himself with Master Menace to escape, Hyperion battles Zhib-Ran to the death; although he wins, he is blinded in the fight. After a battle to the death with Nighthawk and the Redeemers, a team formed to stop the domineering Squadron, Hyperion relents and relinquishes power.

Hyperion and the other surviving members of the Squadron Supreme travel into space to protect their planet from the expanding Nth Man, and are exiled to the Earth-616 universe. The team encounters the hero Quasar, and take up residence at the government facility Project Pegasus. Quasar and the Eternal Makkari rescue the Squadron when the team is captured by the cosmic entity the Stranger; Makkari realizes that Hyperion is an Eternal and teaches him how to restore his eyesight. The entire Squadron later assists the Avengers against the villain Imus Champion before finding the means to return to their universe. Once home, the team disbands, but Hyperion reunites them when he discovers a corrupt government has filled the power vacuum they left. With the aid of inter-dimensional adventurers the Exiles, Hyperion and the Squadron expose the government to a global audience.

Earth-712 was eventually destroyed by an Incursion, a collision between two realities. Hyperion and Power Princess were the last two survivors of their team. A fatally injured Hyperion urged Zarda to escape their reality before it was destroyed.

===Supreme Power===

This Hyperion was sent to Earth in a spacecraft, and seized shortly after by U.S. government agents who raised him in a tightly controlled, isolated environment. As an adult, he became a covert agent used in strict secrecy, but eventually a reporter came too close to the truth, and the decision was made to make his existence public, largely so he could be used as a distraction from the government&#x27;s even more closely guarded secret super-operative, Joe Ledger. He briefly allies himself with Nighthawk and Blur to find and defeat the super-powered serial killer Michael Redstone. As Hyperion discovers that he has been systematically lied to his entire life, he becomes disillusioned with the government and eventually openly rebels. When the government attempts to blackmail him into returning by revealing his alien status to the public, he responds by smashing into the North Pole from space, creating a 10.5 seismic event.

In the &quot;Supreme Power: Hyperion&quot; miniseries, a hastily assembled team of superhumans is sent by the government to retrieve him, and the resulting battle—through an interaction of Hyperion&#x27;s &quot;flash vision&quot; eye-beams, Nuke&#x27;s radiation blast, and Arcanna&#x27;s reality manipulation—sends the combatants into what appears to be an alternate timeline where Hyperion and the Squadron Supreme rule a dystopian world. This causes Hyperion (on his counterpart&#x27;s advice) to rethink his ideas about power, humanity, and teamwork, leading him to surrender to the Squadron from his world. Emil Burbank later deduces that it was not an alternate world they traveled to, but their own future; Burbank tells no one of his discovery.

Along with the rest of his team, save Nighthawk, Hyperion was killed by the Cabal during an Incursion.

===Squadron Supreme (Earth-616)===
This Hyperion was sent to his reality&#x27;s Earth as a baby, the only survivor of a race of Eternals from a dying world. He was raised by a man named &quot;Father&quot;, who named him Marcus Milton and taught him the morals of society. As an adult, he became the superhero named Hyperion and protected the world alongside the Squadron Supreme. When his reality collided with another, Hyperion was the only survivor, floating around in the void that had been his universe until a group of A.I.M. scientists pulled him into the Earth-616 reality. Hyperion was in the captivity of A.I.M. until he was freed by the Avengers and offered a place amongst them. Hyperion is among the superheroes that joined the Avengers due to the threat of Ex Nihilo on Mars. Hyperion was with the Avengers when A.I.M. was sighted in the Savage Land trying to extract the formula from one of the Garden&#x27;s evolution pods. Hyperion later joins the Earth-616 version of the Squadron Supreme along with other various heroes who survived their home realities&#x27; destruction. This new incarnation of the Squadron Supreme are more dangerous than the Earth-712 and Supreme Power versions as they swear to protect Earth by any means necessary. Their first public battle is the destruction of Atlantis, which Hyperion enacts himself as well as severing Namor&#x27;s head with his atomic vision, killing him instantly in retaliation for the King of Atlantis&#x27; role in the annihilation of Doctor Spectrum&#x27;s home reality. After the public death of Namor the Squadron Supreme become a very controversial team which puts them at odds with the Avengers. Hyperion is convinced to take on a secret identity and later decides to take a job as a truck driver.

===Squadron Supreme of America===
A variation of the Mark Milton version of Hyperion appears as a member of the Squadron Supreme of America. This version is a simulacrum created by Mephisto and programmed by the Power Elite. Hyperion was programmed to be a mild-mannered man raised by farmers who had the strength of an Eternal. In his personal time, he works as a history teacher at Buscema High School in Kensington, Maryland.

In the team&#x27;s first mission, Hyperion and the Squadron Supreme of America fought Namor and the Defenders of the Deep, when they targeted a Roxxon oil platform off the coast of Alaska. Hyperion had Orka tied up in chains.

Then, the Squadron Supreme visited another oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico. The Squadron Supreme then made short work of Namor and the Defenders of the Deep.

During the &quot;War of the Realms&quot; storyline, Mark was teaching a class when a code red was issued. He and other members of the Squadron Supreme of America were summoned to Washington D.C., where Phil Coulson brought them up to speed with Malekith the Accursed&#x27;s invasion. Hyperion and the Squadron Supreme of America fight an army of Rock Trolls and Frost Giants. After the Squadron Supreme caused the Frost Giants to retreat, Phil Coulson sends them to Ohio which has become a battleground.

Hyperion was with the Squadron Supreme attempting to apprehend Black Panther, when he infiltrated the Pentagon to confront Phil Coulson. Hyperion states that the Squadron Supreme are the United States&#x27; sanctioned superhero team in light of the Avengers becoming an &quot;anti-American&quot; team.

==Powers and abilities==
Hyperion is a member of the race of superhumans known as the Eternals. As a result, he has superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, reflexes, and flight. All versions of Hyperion possess these superhuman attributes, and, in a few cases, powerful breath able to generate force winds and freezing cold. Each also has greatly enhanced sensory perceptions which extends to being able to perceive the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Their &quot;atomic vision&quot; allows them to fire beams of heat from their eyes.

The heroic Earth-712 version of Hyperion also possesses the ability to use cosmic energy to augment his life force granting him great longevity and regenerative abilities. The powers of Hyperion and his alternative versions are drained when exposed to argonite radiation.

==Other versions==
===Exiles===
King Hyperion was a member of the reality-hopping team known as Weapon X. He is incredibly ruthless and seeks to conquer alternate Earths, but is eventually defeated by Blink and an alternate version of Gambit. Although his body is blown to pieces, Hyperion survives, regenerating and eventually regaining his full power. He seeks revenge on the Exiles, only to be engaged in battle by two alternate versions of himself, including the Earth-712 version. King Hyperion is then exiled to his home reality, where Earth was completely destroyed by nuclear weapons in an attempt to destroy him years prior. He somehow escapes, and is later seen in the mainstream Earth-616 reality&#x27;s Russia, battling the Winter Guard and the Blue Marvel. He is imprisoned in the Raft, and Luke Cage nominates him for the Thunderbolts program. King Hyperion tells the team that he is a heroic iteration, and that the Hyperion who fought Blue Marvel had switched places with him upon defeat. This is a lie, and he turns on the Thunderbolts during their first mission together. He is soon brought down by Ghost, who uses the nanites in King Hyperion&#x27;s spine to dose him with argonite. After that, Hyperion is subject to Man-Thing&#x27;s touch, which burns anyone who feels fear.

===Marvel Zombies Supreme===
Scientists in the mainstream 616 reality graft the DNA of the Earth-712 Squadron Supreme members to normal human corpses and zap them with radiation to create a Squadron Supreme for their reality in an attempt to attain disease-curing knowledge of genetics. The bodies are reanimated as zombies, and, believing themselves to be the original Squadron Supreme, they attempt to escape the lab facility. Hyperion is successful and goes on an eating rampage in Kansas, but eventually finds enough willpower to realize deep in his mind the immorality of his appetite-driven actions, and thus in turn stopping himself through eating cattle infected with mad cow disease to kill himself.

===Paradise X===
In the &quot;Paradise X&quot; miniseries, a version of Hyperion is recruited by X-51 for his squadron of interdimensional heralds. in his reality, almost all superheroes perished in a nuclear attack by Earth&#x27;s governments. He later kills Kulan Gath, who is responsible for the deaths of many of another reality&#x27;s heroes.

===Secret Wars 2015===
Another version of Hyperion appears on Battleworld during &quot;Secret Wars&quot; in the four issue mini-series &quot;Squadron Sinister&quot;. He and his Squadron have been annexing other domains of Battleworld. Nighthawk secretly works against Hyperion, framing the Whizzer for treachery so that Hyperion incinerates him, and causing Doctor Spectrum to flee when he is also framed. Nighthawk later shoots Hyperion with an argonite gun, and holds his own in a fight with him using Doctor Spectrum&#x27;s power prism until Hyperion is so weakened by the argonite that Nighthawk strangles him to death with his bare hands.

<text>The Maharashtra Housing Board (MHB) was established in 1948 and had a jurisdiction over the entire State of Maharashtra except for the Vidarbha region. This body undertook construction of residential buildings under various housing schemes for different sections of society. The allotment and maintenance of these buildings was being looked after by it. On the re-organization of the State, the Vidarbha Housing Board (VHB) was established in 1960 as a successor body to the erstwhile Madhya Pradesh Housing Board. It served the Amravati and Nagpur divisions of Maharashtra and its functions were similar to those of the MHB, except that it also advanced loan to co-operative housing societies, institutions, and local authorities for the construction of houses. The Bombay Building Repairs and Reconstruction Board was constituted in 1971. It was created to deal with the problems faced by tenants residing in dilapidated buildings in the Island City of Bombay and undertook its structural repairs and reconstruction to make them structurally sound and safe for habitation. The Bombay Slum Improvement Board was constituted in 1974, with intention to provide basic amenities, such as water taps, drainage, pathways, latrines and streetlights etc. in Bombay slums. To begin with, its activities were confined to the Mumbai City and Mumbai Suburban Districts. These activities were later extended to the remainder of Maharashtra upon the launch of the Maharashtra Housing &amp; Area Development Authority (MHADA), as established by the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Act, 1976.

MHB and VHB were merged into a single entity known as MHADA, and it came into existence on 5 December 1977. The erstwhile Bombay Housing and Area Development Board was restructured by a Government Resolution dated 5.11.1992 and split into three separate Boards viz. Bombay Housing and Area Development Board, Bombay Building Repairs and Reconstruction Board and Bombay Slum Improvement Board Under the Government Resolution No. 2679/B, dated 22.7.1992. At present, MHADA coordinates and controls the activities of seven regional housing boards and setup for each revenue division in the state viz. Mumbai, Konkan, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, Amravati, Aurangabad and two special purpose boards viz. Mumbai Building Repairs and Reconstruction Board and Mumbai Slum Improvement Board. In Mumbai alone it has constructed about 3 lakh housing units.

Recently, MHADA has come out with a low cost housing scheme offering 2,593 apartments in Mumbai and Mira Road in its May 2012 Lottery Scheme. In a press conference on 28.08.2019 MHADA Chairman Uday Samant stated that MHADA may not call lottery for 3 years due to unavailability of housing stock. MHADA has stock of only 217 houses as of August 2019. On 6 August 2021, the organisation planned to initiate the process through a lottery system for allocation of low cost houses and will be situated in areas like Virar, Mira Road, Shirdhon, Khoni, Gotheghar, and Vengurla.

<doc id="404266" wikidata="Q494264" url="?curid=404266" title="Frederick DuCane Godman">
<text>Frederick DuCane Godman (15 January 1834 – 19 February 1919) was an English lepidopterist, entomologist and ornithologist. He was one of the twenty founding members of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union. Along with Osbert Salvin, he is remembered for studying the fauna and flora of Central America.

Godman collected Iznik, Hispano-Moresque and early Iranian pottery. His collection of more than 600 pieces was donated to the British Museum through the will of his younger daughter, Catherine, who died in 1982.

==Early life and Cambridge years==
Frederick DuCane Godman was born on 15 January 1834 at Park Hatch, Godalming, Surrey, and was one of the thirteen children of Joseph Godman and Caroline Smith. Joseph Godman was a partner in the brewery firm Whitbread &amp; Company. Frederick was sent to study at Eton College in 1844 but left three years later due to poor health and was educated at home by private tutors. At the age of 18 he went with his tutor on a trip around the Mediterranean and the Black Sea visiting southern Spain, Athens and Constantinople.

Godman joined Trinity College, Cambridge in 1853, where he met Alfred Newton and Osbert Salvin. Both Salvin and Godman spent time learning to skin and mount birds at Baker&#x27;s taxidermy shop on the Trumpington Road. They also spent time in the field on the fens. The custom of these ornithological friends, (which included his younger brother Percy (1836–1922)), to meet and talk over their recent acquisitions led to the idea of an organisation and the foundation of the British Ornithological Union. At a meeting in Newton&#x27;s room in Magdalene College on 17 November 1858, a group that included Godman, Salvin, Wilfred Simpson, John Wolley, Philip Sclater and others decided that &quot;... an Ornithological Union of twenty members should be formed, with the object of establishing a new Journal devoted to Birds: that Lieut.-Colonel H. M. Drummond should be President, Professor Newton the Secretary of the Union, and Sclater should edit the Journal: that the title of the Journal should be &quot;The Ibis&quot;.&quot;

==Travels==
Godman inherited a fortune from his father that allowed him to travel the world. In 1857 Godman and his brother Percy visited Bodø in northern Norway. They later published an account of their visit in the &quot;Ibis&quot;. In 1861 he joined Salvin (who was making his third trip to South America) in a trip to Guatemala and Belize via Jamaica. Godman left Salvin in Belize due to a fever and returned home via the Atlantic coast. In 1865, he made a trip to the Azores with one of his younger brothers, Captain Temple Godman (1844–1894). In 1871 he visited the Canary and Madeira Islands. He corresponded with Charles Darwin. He made many other trips later including a trip to India in 1886 with his brother-in-law Henry John Elwes. They visited Bombay, Delhi, Allan Octavian Hume at Simla, Calcutta and then travelled east to Sikkim. He purchased a collection of butterflies from Robert Lidderdale (1835–1908). During this trip he had trouble walking particularly at high altitudes. They returned through Madras and Sri Lanka. Later on he had a blood clot in the veins of his legs, leading him to move and live in the warmth of Mexico in 1885. Even here he joined Elwes on a trip up Popacatapetl.

==Life and work==

In 1876 Godman and Salvin decided to work on a project to document the fauna and flora of Central America. This monumental work &quot;Biologia Centrali-Americana&quot; (1879–1915) was to grow into a 63 volume encyclopaedia on the natural history of Central America. Some of the botanical plates were painted by Salvin&#x27;s wife. Salvin did not live to see it completed. Godman relied on Salvin for much of the systematics involved. The work was made possible by a number of other collaborators including Richard Bowdler Sharpe and George Charles Champion. The associated collection was also enormous and included collections made by others such as Henry Walter Bates that were purchased. Godman and Salvin also collected numerous bird and butterfly specimens. These were presented to the British Museum in 1885, including nearly 520,000 bird skins alone. Other works by Godman included &quot;The Natural History of the Azores&quot; (1870) and a two-volume &quot;Monograph of the Petrels&quot; (1907–10) with plates by J. G. Keulemans. The British Ornithologists&#x27; Union instituted the Godman-Salvin Medal for contributions to ornithology while a memorial to Godman and Salvin was constructed and is exhibited in the Natural History Museum.

Godman also took an interest in plants, maintaining a large collection of rhododendrons, orchids and alpine plants in his garden and rockery at South Lodge near Horsham. This house is now the South Lodge Hotel. There appears to have been a friendly rivalry with his friend Sir Edmund Loder, a plantsman and owner of nearby Leonardslee country estate. They co-operated on &quot;loderii&quot; hybrid rhododendron, a cross between Leanardslee&#x27;s &quot;Rhododendron fortunei&quot; and South Lodge&#x27;s &quot;Rhododendron griffianthium&quot;. South Lodge remains notable for its rhododendrons. His other botanical passions included orchids and nerines, and with his gardener, Geoffrey Giles, he propagated rare orchids, regularly being awarded for his efforts by the Royal Horticultural Society. Along with his brother Colonel Charles Bulkeley Godman (1849–1941), he took an interest in hunting with dogs, fishing and shooting.

Godman collected early Iranian pottery, Iznik pottery and Hispano-Moresque ware. Although he had visited Istanbul in 1852, the ceramics were purchased in England. He became well known as a collector and dealers would bring items to his home near Horsham. His collection included important inscribed and dated works.
In 1873 he married Edith, the daughter of J. H. Elwes (and hence sister of Godman&#x27;s friend H. J. Elwes) and after her death in 1875 married Alice, daughter of Percy Chaplin in 1891. Along with his second wife, later Dame Alice Mary Godman (1868–1944, who became deputy president of the British Red Cross Society), he travelled to the West Indies and through Africa. He had two daughters by his second wife, Eva Mary (1895–1965) and Catherine Edith (1896–1982). Both his daughters took an interest in natural history. The elder daughter Eva was killed by a vehicle when she crossed a street to post a letter. His collection of more than 600 pieces of Islamic pottery was transferred to the British Museum through the will of his younger daughter, Catherine, who died in 1982.

Godman was secretary of the British Ornithological Union from 1870 to 1882 and again from 1889 to 1897, and also served as president from 1896 until 1913. He was a fellow of the Zoological Society of London, and member of its council from 1902. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1882, received a gold medal from the Linnean Society in 1918, and was made a trustee of the British Museum.

==Death==
Godman died on 19 February 1919 at 45 Pont Street, London, and was laid to rest in Cowfold, Sussex.

==Legacy==
Godman is commemorated in the scientific names of four species of reptiles: &quot;Anolis godmani&quot; (a synonym of &quot;Anolis limifrons)&quot;, &quot;Cerrophidion godmani&quot;, &quot;Rhadinella godmani&quot;, &quot;Thamnophis godmani&quot; ; one amphibian, Godman&#x27;s tree frog (&quot;Tlalocohyla godmani)&quot;; and a heliconiine butterfly, &quot;Heliconius godmani&quot;.

==Works==
;Books
* 
* Scans from the Internet archive: Volume 1, Volume 2.

;Journal articles
Godman published 12 article on birds in the &quot;Ibis&quot;. Several of these had multiple parts and almost all were with Salvin as a co-author. He also published over 30 articles on butterflies, again mostly with Salvin.

He was born in Baltimore, Maryland. His father was George Foster Emmons.

He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1874. In 1881, he attained the Master rank, (1883) Lieutenant J.G. and (1887) Lieutenant.

In 1882, Emmons was stationed on the &quot;Pinta&quot; in Alaska, remaining there through the 1880s and 1890s. The Navy was largely responsible for stability in the region in those times.

Emmons married Kittie Baker in 1886.

Through his duties, Emmons got in contact with, and interested in, the Alaska Native cultures of the region: particularly the Tlingit and Tahltan. He began to record information and collect artifacts as he visited them on his leaves. He was dedicated to learning about native traditions, such Chilkat weaving, bear hunting, feuds, and the potlatch (a large ceremonial feast). With his understanding of beliefs and values, and his ethnographer&#x27;s devotion, he also recorded Tlingit vocabulary. He was assigned to the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition to accompany the Alaskan exhibit from 1891–1893.

Emmons retired in 1899 and took on special projects for the federal government. He was sent to Alaska in 1901 to locate border stone markers between Canada and the USA. He gave advice about Alaskan game and forests and salmon fishery in 1902. In 1904, he gathered information about white settlers and Alaska Natives and asked President Theodore Roosevelt to investigate the conditions of Alaska Natives and starvation among the Copper River Indians. He received Roosevelt&#x27;s support, and presented a report to the Congress in 1905.

His interest in Alaska Natives brought him into close contact with the American Museum of Natural History, which purchased his first two collections of Alaska Native artifacts in the 1890s. Emmons had an exchange of items with the Museum for the next three decades. (In 1902, the Field Museum of Natural History purchased a large and varied collection of more than 1,900 Tlingit objects.) F. W. Putnam, curator of the American Natural History Museum, asked for his help on a report in 1896 and repeated the request to the Navy the following year. So Emmons was officially detached from active service and ordered to write the &quot;Ethnological Report on the Native Tribes of Southeast Alaska, elaborated from the museum collections&quot;. He became a regular contributor to &quot;The American Museum Journal&quot; (forerunner of &quot;Natural History&quot; journal) and other scholarly periodicals.

At the recommendation of Franz Boas, with whom he corresponded regularly and at the request of the president of the American Museum of Natural History, Morris K. Jesup, he began to organize his notes and prepare a manuscript on the Tlingit. When he died in Victoria, British Columbia in 1945, the encyclopedic work was still unfinished. The project was taken over by Frederica de Laguna in 1955 and finally published 1991 with the title &quot;The Tlingit Indians&quot;. It includes topics such as census data, names of clans and houses, species of plants and their uses, native calendars, and names of gambling sticks.

<doc id="404280" wikidata="Q213544" url="?curid=404280" title="Zoisite">
<text>Zoisite, first known as saualpite, after its type locality, is a calcium aluminum hydroxy sorosilicate belonging to the epidote group of minerals. Its chemical formula is Ca2Al3(SiO4)(Si2O7)O(OH).

Zoisite occurs as prismatic, orthorhombic (2/m 2/m 2/m) crystals or in massive form, being found in metamorphic and pegmatitic rock. Zoisite may be blue to violet, green, brown, pink, yellow, gray, or colorless. Blue crystals are known under the name tanzanite. It has a vitreous luster and a conchoidal to uneven fracture. When euhedral, zoisite crystals are striated parallel to the principal axis (c-axis). Also parallel to the principal axis is one direction of perfect cleavage. The mineral is between 6 and 7 on the Mohs hardness scale, and its specific gravity ranges from 3.10 to 3.38, depending on the variety. It streaks white and is said to be brittle. Clinozoisite is a more common monoclinic polymorph of Ca2Al3(SiO4)(Si2O7)O(OH). 
Transparent material is fashioned into gemstones while translucent-to-opaque material is usually carved.

The mineral was described by Abraham Gottlob Werner in 1805. He named it after the Carniolan naturalist Sigmund Zois, who sent him its specimens from Saualpe in Carinthia. Zois realized that this was an unknown mineral when it was brought to him by a mineral dealer, presumed to be Simon Prešern, in 1797.

Sources of zoisite include Tanzania (tanzanite), Kenya (anyolite), Norway (thulite), Switzerland, Austria, India, Pakistan, and the U.S. state of Washington.

More recently, the Thulite variety has been found in Canada, in the Jeffrey Mine (Val-des-sources, QC) and in British Columbia.

<doc id="404284" wikidata="Q5092505" url="?curid=404284" title="Cherry Valley massacre">
<text>The Cherry Valley massacre was an attack by British and Iroquois forces on a fort and the town of Cherry Valley in central New York on November 11, 1778, during the American Revolutionary War. It has been described as one of the most horrific frontier massacres of the war. A mixed force of Loyalists, British soldiers, Senecas, and Mohawks descended on Cherry Valley, whose defenders, despite warnings, were unprepared for the attack. During the raid, the Seneca in particular targeted non-combatants, and reports state that 30 such individuals were killed, in addition to a number of armed defenders.

The raiders were under the overall command of Walter Butler. However, he had only tenuous authority, at best, over the Indian warriors on the expedition. Historian Barbara Graymont describes Butler&#x27;s command of the expedition as &quot;criminally incompetent&quot;. The Seneca were angered by accusations that they had committed atrocities at the Battle of Wyoming, and the colonists&#x27; recent destruction of their forward bases of operation at Unadilla, Onaquaga, and Tioga. Butler&#x27;s authority with the Indigenous People was undermined by his poor treatment of Joseph Brant, the leader of the Mohawks. Butler repeatedly maintained that he was powerless to restrain the Seneca, despite accusations that he permitted the atrocities to take place.

During the campaigns of 1778, Brant achieved an undeserved reputation for brutality. He was not present at Wyoming — although many thought he was — and he along with Captain Jacob (Scott) of the Saponi (Catawba) actively sought to minimize the atrocities that took place at Cherry Valley. Given that Butler was the overall commander of the expedition, there is controversy as to who actually ordered or failed to restrain the killings. The massacre contributed to calls for reprisals, leading to the 1779 Sullivan Expedition which saw the total military defeat of the British-allied Iroquois in Upstate New York.

==Background==
With the failure of British General John Burgoyne&#x27;s campaign to the Hudson after the Battles of Saratoga in October 1777, the American Revolutionary War in upstate New York became a frontier war. The Mohawk Valley was especially targeted for its fertile soil and large supply of crops farmers were supplying Patriot troops. British leaders in the Province of Quebec supported Loyalist and Native American partisan fighters with supplies and armaments. During the winter of 1777–78, Joseph Brant and other British-allied Natives developed plans to attack frontier settlements in New York and Pennsylvania. In February 1778 Brant established a base of operations at Onaquaga (present-day Windsor, New York). He recruited a mix of Iroquois and Loyalists estimated to number between 200 and 300 by the time he began his campaign in May. One of his objectives was to acquire provisions for his forces and those of John Butler, who was planning operations in the Susquehanna River valley.

Brant began his campaign in late May with a raid on Cobleskill, and raided other frontier communities throughout the summer. The local militia and Continental Army units defending the area were ineffective against the raiders, who typically escaped from the scene of a raid before defenders arrived in force. After Brant and some of Butler&#x27;s Rangers attacked German Flatts in September, the Americans organized a punitive expedition that destroyed the villages of Unadilla and Onaquaga in early October.
While Brant was active in the Mohawk valley, Butler descended with a large mixed force and raided the Wyoming Valley of northern Pennsylvania in early July. This action complicated affairs, for the Senecas in Butler&#x27;s force were accused of massacring noncombatants, and a number of Patriot militia violated their parole not long afterward, participating in a reprisal expedition against Tioga. The lurid propaganda associated with the accusations against the Seneca in particular angered them, as did the destruction of Unadilla, Onaquaga, and Tioga. The Wyoming Valley attack, even though Brant was not present, fueled among his opponents the view of him as a particularly brutal opponent.

Brant then joined forces with Captain Walter Butler (the son of John Butler), leading two companies of Butler&#x27;s Rangers commanded by Captains John McDonell and William Caldwell, for an attack on the major Schoharie Creek settlement of Cherry Valley. Butler&#x27;s forces also included 300 Senecas, probably led by either Cornplanter or Sayenqueraghta, as well as a number of Cayuga led by Fish Carrier, and 50 British soldiers from the 8th Regiment of Foot. As the force moved toward Cherry Valley, Butler and Brant quarreled over Brant&#x27;s recruitment of Loyalists. Butler was unhappy at Brant&#x27;s successes in this sphere, and threatened to withhold provisions from Brant&#x27;s Loyalist volunteers. Ninety of them ended up leaving the expedition, and Brant himself was on the verge of doing so when his Indigenous supporters convinced him to stay. The dispute did not sit well with the Indigenous forces, and may have undermined Butler&#x27;s tenuous authority over them.

==Massacre==

Cherry Valley had a palisaded fort (constructed after Brant&#x27;s raid on Cobleskill) that surrounded the village meeting house. It was garrisoned by 300 soldiers of the 7th Massachusetts Regiment of the Continental Army, commanded by Colonel Ichabod Alden. Alden and his command staff were alerted by November 8 through Oneida spies that the Butler–Brant force was moving against Cherry Valley. However, he failed to take elementary precautions, continuing to occupy a headquarters (the house of a settler named Wells) some from the fort.

Butler&#x27;s force arrived near Cherry Valley late on November 10, and established a cold camp to avoid detection. Reconnaissance of the town identified the weaknesses of Alden&#x27;s arrangements, and the raiders decided to send one force against Alden&#x27;s headquarters and another against the fort. In a council held that night, Butler extracted promises from the Indian warriors in the party that they would not harm noncombatants.

The attack began early on the morning of November 11. Some overeager Native warriors spoiled the surprise by firing on settlers cutting wood nearby. One of them escaped, raising the alarm. Little Beard led some of the Senecas to surround the Wells house, while the main body surrounded the fort. The attackers killed at least sixteen officers and troops of the quarters guards, including Alden, who was cut down while he was running from the Wells house to the fort. Most accounts say Alden was within reach of the gates, only to stop and try to shoot his pursuer, who may have been Joseph Brant. His wet pistol repeatedly misfired and he was killed by a thrown tomahawk hitting him in the forehead. Lt. Col. William Stacy, second in command, also quartered at the Wells house, was taken prisoner. Stacy&#x27;s son Benjamin and cousin Rufus Stacy ran through a hail of bullets to reach the fort from the house; Stacy&#x27;s brother-in-law Gideon Day was killed. Those attacking the Wells house eventually gained entry, leading to hand-to-hand combat inside. After killing most of the soldiers stationed there, the Senecas slaughtered the entire Wells household, twelve in all.

The raiders&#x27; attack on the fort was unsuccessful—lacking heavy weapons, they were unable to make any significant impressions on its stockade walls. The fort was then guarded by the Loyalists while the Native warriors rampaged through the rest of the settlement. Not a single house was left standing, and the Senecas, seeking revenge, were reported to have slaughtered anyone they encountered. Butler and Brant attempted to restrain their actions but were unsuccessful. Brant in particular was dismayed to learn that a number of families who were well known to him and whom he had counted as friends had borne the brunt of the Seneca rampage, including the Wells, Campbell, Dunlop, and Clyde families.
Lt. William McKendry, a quartermaster in Colonel Alden&#x27;s regiment, described the attack in his journal: 
Immediately came on 442 Indians from the Five Nations, 200 Tories under the command of one Col. Butler and Capt. Brant; attacked headquarters; killed Col. Alden; took Col. Stacy prisoner; attacked Fort Alden; after three hours retreated without success of taking the fort.
McKendry identified the fatalities of the massacre as Colonel Alden, thirteen other soldiers, and thirty civilian inhabitants. Most of the slain soldiers had been at the Wells house.

Accounts surrounding the capture of Lt. Col. Stacy report that he was about to be killed, but Brant intervened. &quot;[Brant] saved the life of Lieut. Col Stacy, who [...] was made prisoner when Col. Alden was killed. It is said Stacy was a freemason, and as such made an appeal to Brant, and was spared.&quot;

==Aftermath==
The next morning Butler sent Brant and some rangers back into the village to complete its destruction. The raiders took 70 captives, many of them women and children. About 40 of these Butler managed to have released, but the rest were distributed among their captors&#x27; villages until they were exchanged. Lt. Col. Stacy was taken to Fort Niagara as a prisoner of the British.
A Mohawk chief, in justifying the action at Cherry Valley, wrote to an American officer that &quot;you Burned our Houses, which makes us and our Brothers, the Seneca Indians angrey, so that we destroyed, men, women and Children at Chervalle.&quot; The Seneca &quot;declared they would no more be falsely accused, or fight the Enemy twice&quot; (the latter being an indication that they would refuse quarter in the future). Butler reported that &quot;notwithstanding my utmost Precaution and Endeavours to save the Women and Children, I could not prevent some of them falling unhappy Victims to the Fury of the Savages,&quot; but also that he spent most of his time guarding the fort during the raid. Quebec Governor Frederick Haldimand was so upset at Butler&#x27;s inability to control his forces that he refused to see him, writing &quot;such indiscriminate vengeance taken even upon the treacherous and cruel enemy they are engaged against is useless and disreputable to themselves, as it is contrary to the dispositions and maxims of the King whose cause they are fighting.&quot; Butler continued to insist in later writings that he was not at fault for the events of the day.

The violent frontier war of 1778 brought calls for the Continental Army to take action. Cherry Valley, along with the accusations of murder of non-combatants at Wyoming, helped pave the way for the launch of the 1779 Sullivan Expedition, commissioned by commander-in-chief Major General George Washington and led by Major General John Sullivan. The expedition destroyed over 40 Iroquois villages in their homelands of central and western New York and drove the women and children into refugee camps at Fort Niagara. It failed, however, to stop the frontier war, which continued with renewed severity in 1780.

==Legacy==

A monument was dedicated at Cherry Valley on August 15, 1878, at the centennial anniversary of the massacre. Former New York Governor Horatio Seymour delivered a dedication address at the monument to an audience of about 10,000 persons, saying:

Years after the massacre, Benjamin Stacy&#x27;s home village of New Salem, Massachusetts, celebrated the annual Old Home Day holiday with a Benjamin Stacy footrace, honoring his escape at Cherry Valley.

<doc id="404289" wikidata="Q2994242" url="?curid=404289" title="Menippean satire">
<text>The genre of Menippean satire is a form of satire, usually in prose, that is characterized by attacking mental attitudes rather than specific individuals or entities. It has been broadly described as a mixture of allegory, picaresque narrative, and satirical commentary. Other features found in Menippean satire are different forms of parody and mythological burlesque, a critique of the myths inherited from traditional culture, a rhapsodic nature, a fragmented narrative, the combination of many different targets, and the rapid moving between styles and points of view.

The term is used by classical grammarians and by philologists mostly to refer to satires in prose (cf. the verse Satires of Juvenal and his imitators). Social types attacked and ridiculed by Menippean satires include &quot;pedants, bigots, cranks, parvenus, virtuosi, enthusiasts, rapacious and incompetent professional men of all kinds,&quot; although they are addressed in terms of &quot;their occupational approach to life as distinct from their social behavior ... as mouthpieces of the idea they represent&quot;. Characterization in Menippean satire is more stylized than naturalistic, and presents people as an embodiment of the ideas they represent. The term &quot;Menippean satire&quot; distinguishes it from the earlier satire pioneered by Aristophanes, which was based on personal attacks.

==Origins==
The form is named after the third-century-BC Greek cynic parodist and polemicist Menippus. His works, now lost, influenced the works of Lucian (2nd century AD) and Marcus Terentius Varro (116–27 BC), the latter being the first to identify the genre by referring to his own satires as ; such satires are sometimes also termed &quot;Varronian satire&quot;. According to Mikhail Bakhtin, the genre itself was in existence prior to Menippus, with authors such as Antisthenes ( 446 – 366 BC), Heraclides Ponticus ( 390 BC – 310 BC)) and Bion of Borysthenes ( 325 –  250 BC).

==Classical tradition==

Varro&#x27;s own 150 books of Menippean satires survive only through quotations. The genre continued with Seneca the Younger, whose &quot;Apocolocyntosis&quot;, or &quot;Pumpkinification&quot;, is the only near-complete classical Menippean satire to survive. It consisted in an irreverent parody of the deification of Emperor Claudius. The Menippean tradition is also evident in Petronius&#x27; &quot;Satyricon&quot;, especially in the banquet scene &quot;Cena Trimalchionis&quot;, which combines epic form, tragedy, and philosophy with verse and prose. Both &quot;Satyricon&quot; and Apuleius&#x27; &quot;Metamorphoses (The Golden Ass)&quot;, are Menippea &quot;extended to the limits of the novel&quot;. The most complete picture of the genre in ancient times is to be found in the satires of Lucian. The influence of Menippean satire can be found in ancient Greek novels, in the Roman satires of Gaius Lucilius and Horace, and in early Christian literature, including the Gospels. Later examples include &quot;The Consolation of Philosophy&quot; of Boethius and &quot;The Caesars&quot; of Julian the apostate.

==Characteristics==
Bakhtin identifies a number of basic characteristics that distinguish Menippean satire from comparable genres in antiquity:

* There is a significantly heightened comic element, although there are exceptions (for example in Boethius).
* There is an &quot;extraordinary freedom of plot and philosophical invention&quot;. It is not bound by the orthodoxies of legend, or by the need for historical or everyday realism, even when its central characters are based on legendary or historical figures. It freely operates in the realm of &quot;the fantastic&quot;.
* The unrestrained use of the fantastic is internally motivated by a philosophical objective: a philosophical idea, embodied in a seeker of truth, is &quot;tested&quot; in &quot;extraordinary situations&quot;.
* Fantastic and mystical elements are combined with a crude &quot;slum naturalism&quot;: the &#x27;testing of the idea&#x27; never avoids the degenerate or grotesque side of earthly existence. The man of the idea encounters &quot;worldly evil, depravity, baseness and vulgarity in their most extreme expression&quot;.
* The ideas being tested are always of an &quot;ultimate&quot; nature. Merely intellectual or academic problems or arguments had no place: the whole man and his whole life are at stake in the process of the testing of his idea. Everywhere there is the &quot;stripped down &quot;pro et contra&quot; of life&#x27;s ultimate questions&quot;.
* A three-planed construction—Earth, Olympus and the netherworld—is apparent. Action and dialogue frequently take place on the &quot;threshold&quot; between the planes.
* An &quot;experimental fantasticality&quot; in narrative point of view appears, for example the &quot;view from above&quot; (&quot;kataskopia&quot;).
* An experimentation with &quot;psychopathological&quot; states of mind – madness, split personality, unrestrained daydreaming, weird dreams, extreme passions, suicides etc. Such phenomena function in the Menippea to destabilize the unity of an individual and his fate – a unity that is always assumed in other genres such as the epic. The person discovers other possibilities than those apparently preordained in himself and his life: &quot;he loses his finalized quality and ceases to mean only one thing; he ceases to coincide with himself&quot;. This non-finalization and non-coincidence is facilitated by a rudimentary form of &quot;dialogic relationship to one&#x27;s own self&quot;.
* Breaches of conventional behaviour and disruptions to the customary course of events are characteristic of the Menippea. Scandals and eccentricities have the same function in &#x27;the world&#x27; that mental disorders have in &#x27;the individual&#x27; – they shatter the fragile unity and stability of the established order and the &#x27;normal&#x27;, expected course of events. The inappropriate, cynical word that unmasks a false idol or an empty social convention is similarly characteristic.
* Sharp contrasts, abrupt transitions, oxymoronic combinations, counterintuitive comparisons and unexpected meetings between unrelated things are essential to the Menippea. Opposites are brought together, or united in a single character – the noble criminal, the virtuous courtesan, the emperor who becomes a slave.
* There is often an element of &quot;social utopia&quot;, usually in the form of a dream or journey to an unknown land.
* Widespread use of inserted genres such as novellas, letters, speeches, diatribes, soliloquys, symposia, and poetry, frequently of a parodic nature.
* A sharp satirical focus on a wide variety of contemporary ideas and issues.

Despite the apparent heterogeneity of these characteristics, Bakhtin emphasizes the &quot;organic unity&quot; and the &quot;internal integrity&quot; of the genre. He argues that Menippean satire is the best expression and the truest reflection of the social-philosophical tendencies of the epoch in which it flowered. This was the epoch of the decline of national legend, the disintegration of associated ethical norms, and the concomitant explosion of new religious and philosophical schools vying with each other over &quot;ultimate questions&quot;. The &quot;epic and tragic wholeness of a man and his fate&quot; lost its power as a social and literary ideal, and consequently social &#x27;positions&#x27; became devalued, transformed into &#x27;roles&#x27; played out in a theatre of the absurd. Bakhtin argues that the generic integrity of Menippean satire in its expression of a decentred reality is a quality that has enabled it to exercise an immense influence over the development of European novelistic prose.

According to Bakhtin, the cultural force that underpins the integrity and unity of Menippean satire as a genre, despite its extreme variability and the heterogeneity of its elements, is &quot;carnival&quot;. The genre epitomises the transposition of the &quot;carnival sense of the world&quot; into the language and forms of literature, a process Bakhtin refers to as &quot;Carnivalisation&quot;. Carnival as a social event is &quot;&quot;syncretic pageantry&quot; of a ritualistic sort&quot;: its essential elements were common to a great diversity of times and places, and over time became deeply rooted in the individual and collective psyche. These elements revolved around the suspension of the laws, prohibitions and restrictions that governed the structure of ordinary life, and the acceptance and even celebration of everything that was hidden or repressed by that structure. The apparently heterogeneous characteristics of Menippean satire can, in essence, be traced back to the &quot;concretely sensuous forms&quot; worked out in the carnival tradition and the unified &quot;carnival sense of the world&quot; that grew out of them.

==Later examples==
In a series of articles, Edward Milowicki and Robert Rawdon Wilson, building upon Bakhtin&#x27;s theory, have argued that Menippean is not a period-specific term, as many Classicists have claimed, but a term for discursive analysis that instructively applies to many kinds of writing from many historical periods including the modern. As a type of discourse, “Menippean” signifies a mixed, often discontinuous way of writing that draws upon distinct, multiple traditions. It is normally highly intellectual and typically embodies an idea, an ideology or a mind-set in the figure of a grotesque, even disgusting, comic character.

The form was revived during the Renaissance by Erasmus, Burton, and Laurence Sterne, while 19th-century examples include the &quot;John Buncle&quot; of Thomas Amory and &quot;The Doctor&quot; of Robert Southey. The 20th century saw renewed critical interest in the form, with Menippean satire significantly influencing postmodern literature. Among the works that contemporary scholars have identified as growing out of the Menippean tradition are:

*Erasmus, &quot;In Praise of Folly&quot; (1509)
*François Rabelais, &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot; (1564)
*John Barclay, &quot;Euphormionis Satyricon&quot; (1605)
*Joseph Hall, &quot;Mundus Alter et Idem&quot; (1605)
*Miguel Cervantes, &quot;Novelas ejemplares&quot; (1612)
*Robert Burton, &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot; (1621)
*Jonathan Swift, &quot;A Tale of a Tub&quot; and &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1726)
*Voltaire, &quot;Candide&quot; (1759)
*William Blake, &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot; (1794)
*Thomas Love Peacock, &quot;Nightmare Abbey&quot; (1818)
*Thomas Carlyle, &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot; (1836)
*Nikolai Gogol, &quot;Dead Souls&quot; (1842)
*Lewis Carroll, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1865)
*Fyodor Dostoevsky, &quot;Bobok&quot; (1873)
*Fyodor Dostoevsky, &quot;The Dream of a Ridiculous Man&quot; (1877)
*Aldous Huxley, &quot;Point Counter Point&quot; (1928)
*James Joyce, &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; (1939)
*Flann O&#x27;Brien, &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot; (1939) and &quot;The Third Policeman&quot; (1939)
*Mikhail Bulgakov, &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; (1967)
*Martin Amis, &quot;Dead Babies (novel)&quot; (1975)
*Terry Gilliam, &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985)
*Dave Eggers, &quot;The Circle&quot; (2013)

According to P. Adams Sitney in &quot;Visionary Film&quot;, Mennipea became the dominant new genre in avant-garde cinema at the turn of the century. Filmmakers he cited include Yvonne Rainer, Sidney Peterson, Michael Snow, and Hollis Frampton.

For Bakhtin, Menippean satire as a genre reached its summit in the modern era in the novels and short stories of Dostoevsky. He argues that all the characteristics of the ancient Menippea are present in Dostoevsky but in a highly developed and more complex form. This was not because Dostoevsky intentionally adopted and expanded it as a form: his writing was not in any sense a &quot;stylization&quot; of the ancient genre. Rather it was a creative renewal based in an instinctive recognition of its potential as a form through which to express the philosophical, spiritual and ideological ferment of his time. It could be said that &quot;it was not Dostoevsky&#x27;s subjective memory, but the objective memory of the very genre in which he worked, that preserved the peculiar features of the ancient menippea.&quot; The generic features of Menippean satire were the ground on which Dostoevsky was able to build a new literary genre, which Bakhtin calls Polyphony.

== Frye&#x27;s definition ==
Critic Northrop Frye said that Menippean satire moves rapidly between styles and points of view. Such satires deal less with human characters than with the single-minded mental attitudes, or &quot;humours&quot;, that they represent: the pedant, the braggart, the bigot, the miser, the quack, the seducer, etc. Frye observed,

He illustrated this distinction by positing Squire Western (from &quot;Tom Jones&quot;) as a character rooted in novelistic realism, but the tutors Thwackum and Square as figures of Menippean satire.

Frye found the term &quot;Menippean satire&quot; to be &quot;cumbersome and in modern terms rather misleading&quot;, and proposed as replacement the term &quot;anatomy&quot; (taken from Burton&#x27;s &quot;Anatomy of Melancholy&quot;). In his theory of prose fiction it occupies the fourth place with the novel, romance and confession.

<text>Gemini 2 (Gemini-Titan 2; GT-2) was the second spaceflight of the American human spaceflight program Project Gemini, and was launched and recovered on January 19, 1965. Gemini 2, like Gemini 1, was an uncrewed mission intended as a test flight of the Gemini spacecraft. Unlike Gemini 1, which was placed into orbit, Gemini 2 made a suborbital flight, primarily intended to test the spacecraft&#x27;s heat shield. It was launched on a Titan II GLV rocket. The spacecraft used for the Gemini 2 mission was later refurbished into the Gemini B configuration, and was subsequently launched on another suborbital flight, along with OPS 0855, as a test for the US Air Force Manned Orbital Laboratory. Gemini spacecraft no. 2 was the first craft to make more than one spaceflight since the X-15, and the only one until Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; flew its second mission in 1981; it would also be the only space capsule to be reused until Crew Dragon &quot;Endeavour&quot; was launched a second time in 2021.

== Mission history ==

=== GLV ===
The Titan II/Gemini launch vehicle was dismantled to protect it from two hurricanes in August and September 1964. The second stage of the vehicle was taken down and stored in a hangar on August 26, 1964, in preparation for Hurricane Cleo, and the entire launch vehicle was subsequently dismantled and removed from Cape Kennedy Air Force Station&#x27;s Launch Complex 19 in early September before Hurricane Dora passed over Cape Kennedy on September 9. The Gemini launch vehicle was erected for the final time on 12 September 1964.

Many ground tests were carried out on the Gemini 2 and Titan rocket in November 1964. On November 24, Gemini-Titan (GT) 2 successfully completed the Wet Mock Simulated Launch, a full-scale countdown exercise which included propellant loading. Procedures for flight crew suiting and spacecraft ingress and egress were practiced during simulated launch. The prime flight crew for Gemini 3 donned pressure suits and full biomedical instrumentation, assisted by their backup crew and the space suit bioinstrumentation and aeromedical personnel who would participate in the GT-3 launch operation. As a result of this practice operation, it was established that all physical examinations, bioinstrumentation sensor attachment, and suit donning would be done in the pilot ready room at Launch Complex 16.

Gemini 2 had been scheduled for launch on December 9, 1964. On that date, the countdown reached zero and the first stage engines were ignited. The launch vehicle&#x27;s Malfunction Detection System detected technical problems due to a loss of hydraulic pressure and shut down the engines about one second after ignition.

On the second launch attempt on January 19, 1965, Gemini 2 lifted off from Launch Complex 19 at Cape Kennedy at 14:03:59.861 UTC (9:04 am EST).

Shortly after launch the Mission Control Center suffered a power outage. Control of the mission was transferred to a tracking ship. The outage was later traced to an overload of the electrical system from the network television equipment used to cover the launch.

Gemini 2 flew a ballistic suborbital arc over the Atlantic Ocean reaching a maximum altitude of . The spacecraft was run by an onboard automatic sequencer. At 6 minutes 54 seconds after launch, retrorockets were fired. The spacecraft landed downrange from the launch pad at 14:22:14 UTC (9:22:14 am EST). The flight lasted 18 minutes 16 seconds. The landing was short of the planned impact point, and from the recovery aircraft carrier, . The spacecraft was brought aboard the carrier at 15:52 UTC (10:52 am EST). Most goals were achieved, except the fuel cells had failed before liftoff and were turned off. The spacecraft cooling system temperature also was found to be too high. The Gemini 2 spacecraft was in excellent condition. Its heat shield and retrorockets functioned as expected. The Gemini 2 mission was supported by 6,562 United States Department of Defense personnel, 67 aircraft, and 16 ships.

Gemini 2 had flight instrumentation pallets installed in the crew cabin, similar to those in Gemini 1.

=== MOL ===
The Gemini 2 reentry module was refurbished and flown again on November 3, 1966, in a test flight for the United States Air Force Manned Orbiting Laboratory program. It was launched on a Titan IIIC rocket on a 33-minute suborbital flight from LC-40 at Cape Kennedy. It is the only Gemini spacecraft to have flown with U.S. Air Force insignia, but there is an unflown Gemini B spacecraft in USAF markings on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio.

<doc id="404292" wikidata="Q1771114" url="?curid=404292" title="Orient Watch">
<text>is a Japanese watch manufacturer founded in 1950. Established as an independent company in 1950, it became a functional subsidiary of Epson in 2009 before being fully integrated into the company in 2017.

Until it was absorbed into Epson, the Orient Watch Company had primarily marketed mechanical watches (self-winding &amp; hand-winding), but also produced quartz, light-powered (solar) and radio-controlled models. Outside of the main business, the company produced some moving parts and electronic components that were then assembled into Seiko Epson&#x27;s electronic devices.

Currently, Akita Epson Corporation (formally Akita Orient Precision Instruments Co., Ltd.), a group company of Epson, manufactures all of the Orient movements in-house in Yuzawa, Akita, Japan.

==History==
The origin of Orient Watch Company dates back to 1901 when Shogoro Yoshida opened a wholesale shop called &quot;Yoshida Watch Shop&quot; in Ueno, Taito, Tokyo, Japan. Yoshida Watch Shop was successful, selling imported pocketwatches. In 1912, Yoshida expanded his business and began producing gold wristwatch cases. In 1920, Toyo Tokei Manufacturing was established, originally producing table clocks and gauges. It was not until 1934 that Toyo Tokei Manufacturing started the production of wristwatches. In 1936, the Hino factory was built in Hino, Tokyo, Japan. For several years, Toyo Tokei Manufacturing boomed at the Hino factory. However, the company shut down in 1949 in the Japanese economic devastation following World War II.

After Toyo Tokei Manufacturing was shut down, Yoshida&#x27;s wristwatch manufacturing company was reborn in 1950, founded under the name Tama Keiki Company. Tama Keiki Co. continued manufacturing watches at the Hino factory. In 1951, Tama Keiki Co. changed its name to , and in the same year the first Orient Star went on sale. Orient Watch was able to expand their visibility overseas after a memorandum trade agreement with China in 1955. The Royal Orient went on sale in 1960. Other important watches in the company&#x27;s history include the &quot;Dynamic&quot; in 1956, &quot;Grand Prix 100&quot; in 1964, &quot;Fineness&quot; (the world&#x27;s thinnest automatic wristwatch with day and date calendar function for its time) in 1967, and the &quot;Tenbeat&quot; in 1970.

In 2003, the Orient Technical Center (OTC) was established and the assembly of luxury watches began in Ugo, Ogachi, Akita, Japan. In 2004, the high-precision caliber 88700 movement went on sale via the Royal Orient watch line. In 2005, Orient Star Retro-Future collection was launched. In 2010, Orient Watch Co. celebrated its 60th anniversary with a limited edition model. The Royal Orient line was discontinued around 2016, likely to prevent cannibalism between it and fellow Seiko group brands Grand Seiko, and Credor. To celebrate 70 years of the Orient Star line, the Orient Star skeleton watch was introduced with a silicon escapement made using Epson&#x27;s MEMS technology, which has been used in high end Seiko watches since 2009.

In 2001 Seiko Epson (one of three core companies of the Seiko Group) became the majority shareholder (52%) of the company. Orient Watch became a wholly owned subsidiary of Epson in 2009. After transferring its business to Epson, the company now exists as a dormant company. Epson Sales Japan Corporation markets the Orient watches, while Akita Epson Corporation manufactures them.

<text>SLA Industries (pronounced &quot;slay&quot;) is a role-playing game first published in 1993 by Nightfall Games in Glasgow, Scotland. The game is set in a dystopian far-flung future in which the majority of the known universe is either owned or indirectly controlled by the eponymous corporation &quot;SLA Industries&quot; and incorporates themes from the cyberpunk, horror, and conspiracy genres.

The game combined concepts inspired by a range of aesthetics and ideas. Elements include: song lyrics from David Bowie and the Industrial music scene, cyberpunk fiction (including &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;Max Headroom&quot;), anime / manga (including &quot;Akira&quot;, &quot;Appleseed&quot;, &quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot;, and &quot;Trigun&quot;), and the growing cultural obsession with the media (including 24-hour news services and the &quot;Gladiator&quot; TV Show).

==Setting==
SLA Industries itself is a fictional corporation run by a mysterious and seemingly immortal creature called &quot;Mr. Slayer&quot;, whose upper management team includes two other creatures like himself, &quot;Intruder&quot; and &quot;Senti&quot;. The corporation is headquartered in &quot;Mort City&quot;, a densely populated city-sprawl larger than Eurasia and surrounded by the urban ruins of the &quot;Cannibal Sectors&quot;. It is all located on a vast planet (also called &quot;Mort&quot;) that had been stripped of its natural resources to the point that the ecology had been utterly destroyed. SLA Industries controlled an undefined but vast number of planets, collectively referred to as the World of Progress, and governed them in accordance with Mr. Slayer&#x27;s Big Picture. The setting is bleak and surreal, with much left deliberately ill-defined in the source material.

Players take the role of freelance employees of SLA Industries, called Operatives, living in Mort City and taking care of odd jobs assigned to them by the corporation. These jobs usually involve keeping the peace—chasing serial killers, hunting monsters in the sewers, quashing riots, foiling terrorist plots, and silencing dissidents are common themes. Appearance, style and branding are emphasized in the game world as much as combat ability, due to the omnipresence of television; for ambitious Operatives public persona and TV ratings are often as important as professional abilities. A supplement, the Contract Directory, also provides the option for players to play as celebrity gladiators called Contract Killers. As a role-playing experience, the game tends to be predisposed towards splatterpunk horror, noir, dark satire, and/or gunbunny high action. However, the complexity and Byzantine politics of the setting allow for slower-paced campaigns based around subversion, inter-departmental rivalry, and cut-throat power struggles within the company.

Along with humans, playable races include the drug-addicted mutant humans called &quot;Frothers&quot;, the stealthy feline &quot;Wraith Raiders&quot;, the formidably violent saurian &quot;Shaktar&quot;, and the two &#x27;Ebb&#x27; / pseudo-magic using races: the emotionally sensitive and charismatic Ebon, and their more sadistic and violent evolution, the &quot;Brain Wasters&quot;. There are also a variety of biogenetic vat-grown warrior races called Stormers, produced by SLA to fight in their endless wars.

==Publication prior to 2nd Edition==
&quot;SLA Industries&quot; was first published independently in 1993. The game was later bought by Wizards of the Coast late in 1994, after their success with &quot;&quot;. It was later republished by Nightfall Games Ltd and distributed by Hogshead Publishing, until Hogshead Publishing closed down. Between 2003 and 2011 Cubicle 7 Entertainment produced new material, and in 2011 the license returned to Nightfall Games Ltd, who released supplements (known as Data Packets) as PDFs. In August, 2016, the Kickstarter for the SLA Industries: Cannibal Sector 1 miniatures game was launched by Daruma Productions and Nightfall Games. On 22 June 2018, Nightfall Games announced that Daruma Productions was entering the liquidation process and Nightfall would be taking over completion of the Kickstarter. Cannibal Sector 1, the last 1st Edition product was published in 2019.

==Second Edition==

A new Kickstarter campaign launched in September 2019, for SLA Industries 2nd Edition. It raised £90,444 from 1,281 backers. Additionally, a free Quick Start was released in August 2019 to introduce the new rules, ahead of the Kickstart campaign. The pledge fulfilment started in December 2020, and the products went on general sale in January 2021.

A second Kickstarter was announced in July 2021 for the first sourcebooks for SLA Industries 2nd Edition to start on the 24th of August 2021. The first two books announced are Threat Analysis 1: Collateral and Species Guide 1: Shaktar/Wraithen.

SLA Industries 2nd Edition won a Judges&#x27; Spotlight award in the 2021 ENnies.

A third Kickstarter was announced in June 2024 for the 2nd Threat Analysis Sourcebook: CULT and an Operative&#x27;s Handbook to start on the 18th of June 2024.

==The Writers&#x27; Bible==
Nightfall Games produced the &quot;SLA Industries Writers Bible&quot;, sometimes simply referred to as &quot;The Bible&quot; or &quot;The Truth&quot;, to allow freelance writers to grasp the complicated background of the game. The terms of the associated non-disclosure agreement required that the contents of the document remain secret. Following an extended hiatus in production of official &quot;SLA Industries&quot; material, editor Tim Dedopulos released the bible to the members of the &quot;SLA Industries&quot; email discussion list in 1998. The fans&#x27; reaction to &quot;The Truth&quot; was not entirely warm, and the remaining members of Nightfall Games made it clear that further redistribution of the bible was not permitted without their explicit permission. The writers have since made it clear that the bible was not intended for mass consumption - it had not been edited to the same standard as the published material, as it was an internal document used only to keep the work of disparate authors consistent with the intentions of Nightfall Games. It has also been explained that the process of revealing &quot;The Truth&quot; was originally to have happened over the course of several publications, each one containing more elements of an increasingly refined version of the backstory. In 2005 Cubicle 7 re-released the old Writers Bible, stating that this was no longer the Truth used internally for further development of material. It is no longer accessible and not considered canon by Nightfall Games.

==Reception==
Denys Bakriges reviewed &quot;SLA Industries&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #44 (June, 1994), rating it a 3.5 out of 5 and stated that &quot;&quot;SLA&quot; offers a tone of information on a lot of ideas. For those who want to tackle this game, it offers many unusual concepts. Sci-fi aficionados shouldn&#x27;t be disappointed.&quot;

<doc id="404300" wikidata="Q1351565" url="?curid=404300" title="Octave Chanute">
<text>Octave Chanute (February 18, 1832 – November 23, 1910) was a French-American civil engineer and aviation pioneer. He advised and publicized many aviation enthusiasts, including the Wright brothers. At his death, he was hailed as the father of aviation and the initial concepts of the heavier-than-air flying machine.

==Early life==
Octave Chanute was born in Paris to Elise and Joseph Chanut, professor at the Collège de France. Octave and Joseph emigrated to the United States of America in 1838, when Joseph was named Vice President of Jefferson College in Louisiana. Octave attended private schools in New York. He added the &quot;e&quot; to his last name in his adult life. In 1857, he married Anne Riddell James, with whom he had a son and three daughters.

==Career==
===Railroad civil engineer===
Chanute began his training as a civil engineer in 1848.
He was widely considered brilliant and innovative in the engineering profession. He designed and constructed the two biggest stockyards in the United States, Chicago Stock Yards (1865) and Kansas City Stockyards (1871). He designed and built the Hannibal Bridge with Joseph Tomlinson and George S. Morison. In 1869, this bridge established Kansas City, Missouri as the dominant city in the region, as the first bridge to cross the Missouri River there. He designed many other bridges during his railroad career, including the Illinois River rail bridge at Chillicothe, Illinois, the Genesee River Gorge rail bridge near Portageville, New York (now in Letchworth State Park), the Sibley Railroad Bridge across the Missouri River at Sibley, Missouri, the Fort Madison Toll Bridge at Fort Madison, Iowa, and the Kinzua Bridge in Pennsylvania.

===Pioneer in wood preservation===
Chanute established a procedure for pressure-treating wooden railroad ties with an antiseptic that increased the wood&#x27;s lifespan. Establishing the first commercial plants, he convinced railroad men that it was advantageous to expend funds treating ties to extend their service life, thus reducing replacement costs. To monitor the longevity of railroad ties and other wooden items, he introduced the railroad date nail in the United States.

Chanute retired from the Erie Railway in 1883 to become an independent engineering consultant.

===Aviation pioneer===

Chanute became interested in aviation after watching a balloon ascend in Peoria, Illinois, in 1856. When he retired from his railroad career in 1883, he devoted some leisure time to furthering the new science of aviation. Applying his engineering background, Chanute collected all available data from flight experimenters around the world and combined it with the knowledge gathered as a civil engineer in the past. He published his findings in a series of articles in &quot;The Railroad and Engineering Journal&quot; from 1891 to 1893, which were then re-published in the influential book &quot;Progress in Flying Machines&quot; in 1894. This was the most systematic global survey of fixed-wing heavier-than-air aviation research published up to that time.

At the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, Chanute collaborated with Albert Zahm to organize a highly successful International Conference on Aerial Navigation.

Chanute was too old to fly, so he partnered with younger experimenters, including Augustus M. Herring and William Avery. In 1896, Chanute, Herring, and Avery tested a design based on the work of German aviation pioneer Otto Lilienthal, and of hang gliders of their own design. The testing was in the dunes along the shore of Lake Michigan near the town of Miller Beach, Indiana, just east of what became the city of Gary. These experiments convinced Chanute that the best way to achieve extra lift without a prohibitive increase in weight was to stack several wings, an idea proposed by the British engineer Francis Herbert Wenham in 1866 and realized in flight by Lilienthal in the 1890s. Chanute introduced the &quot;strut-wire&quot; braced wing structure that was used in powered biplanes of the future, not seriously challenged until the pioneering efforts of Hugo Junkers to develop all-metal cantilever airframe technology without external bracing from 1915 onward. Chanute based his &quot;interplane strut&quot; concept on the Pratt truss, which was familiar to him from his bridge-building work. The Wright brothers based their glider designs on the Chanute &quot;double-decker&quot;, as they called it. A new design of a biplane glider was developed and flown in 1897.

Chanute corresponded with many aviation pioneers, including Otto Lilienthal, Louis Pierre Mouillard, Gabriel Voisin, John J. Montgomery, Louis Blériot, Ferdinand Ferber, Lawrence Hargrave, and Alberto Santos Dumont. In 1897, he started a correspondence with British aviator Percy Pilcher. Following Chanute&#x27;s ideas, Pilcher built a triplane, but he was killed in a glider crash in October 1899 before he could attempt to fly it.

In 1900, Wilbur Wright read &quot;Progress in Flying Machines&quot; and contacted Chanute. Chanute helped to publicize the Wright brothers&#x27; work and provided consistent encouragement, visiting their camp near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in 1901, 1902, and 1903. The Wrights and Chanute exchanged hundreds of letters between 1900 and 1910.

Chanute freely shared his knowledge about aviation with anyone who was interested, and expected others to do the same. He encouraged colleagues to patent their inventions. His open approach led to friction with the Wright brothers, who believed their ideas about aircraft control were unique and refused to share them. Chanute did not believe that the Wright flying machine patent, premised on wing warping, could be enforced and said so publicly, including a newspaper interview in which he said, &quot;I admire the Wrights. I feel friendly toward them for the marvels they have achieved, but you can easily gauge how I feel concerning their attitude at present by the remark I made to Wilbur Wright recently. I told him I was sorry to see they were suing other experimenters and abstaining from entering the contests and competitions in which other men are brilliantly winning laurels. I told him that in my opinion they are wasting valuable time over lawsuits which they ought to concentrate in their work. Personally, I do not think that the courts will hold that the principle underlying the warping tips can be patented.&quot; The friendship was still impaired when Chanute died, but Wilbur Wright attended Chanute&#x27;s memorial service at the family&#x27;s home. Wright wrote a eulogy that was read at the Aero Club meeting in January 1911.

When the Aero Club of Illinois was founded on February 10, 1910, Chanute was its first president until his death.

==Death==

Chanute died on November 23, 1910, in Chicago, Illinois, after battling pneumonia. Wilbur Wright attended his funeral in his honor.

==Commemoration==

The town of Chanute, Kansas, is named after Chanute. Three small towns in southeast Kansas were vying for the railroad&#x27;s land office and Chanute suggested that they incorporate, to make the larger town more attractive to the railroad. 

The former Chanute Air Force Base near Rantoul, Illinois, was started in 1917 by the U.S. Army as Chanute Field. The base was decommissioned in 1993 and converted to peacetime endeavors. One of these endeavors was the now-closed Octave Chanute Aerospace Museum, which detailed the history of Chanute Air Force Base and of aviation in general, and included a replica of Chanute&#x27;s 1896 glider. The location of the base is now the Chanute Field Historic District, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1902, the Western Society of Engineers began to present the Octave Chanute Award for papers of merit on engineering innovations. From 1939 to 2005, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics presented the Chanute Flight Award for an outstanding contribution made by a pilot or test personnel to the advancement of the art, science, and technology of aeronautics.

In 1963, Chanute was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio.

In 1974, Chanute was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame.

In 1978, the U.S. Postal Service commemorated Octave Chanute with a pair of 21-cent airmail stamps.

In 1996, the National Soaring Museum honored the 100th anniversary of the glider flying experiments in the sand dunes along Lake Michigan as National Landmark of Soaring No. 8.

Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona Beach, in Daytona Beach, Florida, has an off-campus residence hall, the Chanute Complex, for upper-class students.

The Gary Bathing Beach Aquatorium, in Gary, Indiana, houses a museum dedicated to both Octave Chanute and the Tuskegee Airmen. The historic bathing pavilion was designed by architect George Washington Maher.

He is represented in the &quot;Frieze of American History&quot; detail &quot;The Birth of Aviation&quot;, in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda in Washington DC.

<text>Digression (&quot;parékbasis&quot; in Greek, &quot;egressio&quot;, &quot;digressio&quot; and &quot;excursion&quot; in Latin) is a section of a composition or speech that marks a temporary shift of subject; the digression ends when the writer or speaker returns to the main topic. Digressions can be used intentionally as a stylistic or rhetorical device.

In classical rhetoric since Corax of Syracuse, especially in &quot;Institutio Oratoria&quot; of Quintilian, the digression was a regular part of any oration or composition. After setting out the topic of a work and establishing the need for attention to be given, the speaker or author would digress to a seemingly disconnected subject before returning to a development of the composition&#x27;s theme, a proof of its validity, and a conclusion. A &quot;schizothemia&quot; is a digression by means of a long reminiscence.

Cicero was a master of digression, particularly in his ability to shift from the specific question or issue at hand (the &quot;hypothesis&quot;) to the more general issue or question that it depended upon (the &quot;thesis&quot;). As was the case with most ancient orators, Cicero&#x27;s apparent digression always turned out to bear directly upon the issue at hand. During the Second Sophistic (in Imperial Rome), the ability to guide a speech away from a stated theme and then back again with grace and skill came to be a mark of true eloquence.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;digression&quot; comes from the Latin word &quot;digressio&quot;: &quot;a going away, departing,&quot; noun of action from past participle stem of &quot;digredi&quot; &quot;to deviate&quot;, from &quot;dis-&quot; &quot;apart, aside&quot; + &quot;gradi&quot; &quot;to step, go&quot;.

== Literary use ==
Digressions in a literary text serve a diverse array of functions, such as a means to provide background information, a way to illustrate or emphasize a point through example or anecdote, and even a channel through which to satirize a subject.

=== 800–500 BCE ===
In 800-500 BCE, Homer relies upon digression in his composition of &quot;The Iliad&quot; in order to provide his audience with a break from the primary narrative, to offer background information, and, most importantly, to enhance the story&#x27;s verisimilitude. Through these digressions Homer ensures his audience&#x27;s devotion to the characters and interest in the plot.

For example, in Book Eleven, Homer employs a mini-digression when Agamemnon comes upon brothers Peisandros and Hippolokhos in battle. After they come to Agamemnon as suppliants, he remembers that their father was one who denied Menelaos’ emissaries and “held out for killing [them] then and there”. This short interlude from the action provides the audience with a critical fact about the beginning of the war and the nature of the opposing parties.

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===
In 18th-century literature, the digression (not to be confused with subplot) was a substantial part of satiric works. Works such as Jonathan Swift&#x27;s &quot;A Tale of a Tub&quot;, Laurence Sterne&#x27;s &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; and Diderot&#x27;s &quot;Jacques le fataliste et son maître&quot; even made digressiveness itself a part of the satire. Sterne&#x27;s novel, in particular, depended upon the digression, and he wrote, &quot;Digressions, incontestably, are the sunshine; — they are the life, the soul of reading; — take them out of this book (&quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;) for instance, — you might as well take the book along with them.&quot; This use of digression as satire later showed up in Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s work.

The digression was also used for non-satiric purposes in fiction. In Henry Fielding&#x27;s &quot;The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling&quot;, the author has numerous asides and digressive statements that are a side-fiction, and this sort of digression within chapters shows up later in the work of Charles Dickens, Machado de Assis, William Makepeace Thackeray, Herman Melville, Victor Hugo and others. The novels of Leo Tolstoy, J.D. Salinger, Marcel Proust, Henry Miller, Milan Kundera and Robert Musil are also full of digressions.

=== 20th century ===
In late twentieth-century literature (in postmodern fiction), authors began to use digressions as a way of distancing the reader from the fiction and for creating a greater sense of play. John Fowles&#x27;s &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; and Lawrence Norfolk&#x27;s &quot;Lemprière&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; both employ digressions to offer scholarly background to the fiction, while others, like Gilbert Sorrentino in &quot;Mulligan Stew&quot;, use digression to prevent the functioning of the fiction&#x27;s illusions.

== Real-life examples ==
Digression as a rhetorical device can also be found in present-day sermons: after introducing the topic, the speaker will introduce a story that seems to be unrelated, return to the original topic, and then use the story to illustrate the speaker&#x27;s point.

Unintentional digressions in informal conversation and discussion are common. Speakers commonly use the phrase &quot;But I digress...&quot; after a digression to express the shift back to the main topic. Many examples of this use can already be found in 19th-century publications. Unless the speaker ties the &quot;digression&quot; back into the subject at hand, that shift in subject does not strictly constitute a rhetorical digression.

<text>A rock musical is a musical theatre work with rock music. The genre of rock musical may overlap somewhat with album musicals, concept albums and song cycles, as they sometimes tell a story through the rock music, and some album musicals and concept albums become rock musicals. Notable examples of rock musicals include &quot;Next to Normal&quot;, &quot;Spring Awakening&quot;, &quot;Rent&quot;, &quot;Grease&quot;, and &quot;Hair&quot;. The Who&#x27;s &quot;Tommy&quot; and other rock operas are sometimes presented on stage as a musical.

==History==
The first musical to hint at what was to come was the final Ziegfeld Follies in 1957. This production featured one rock and roll number, &quot;The Juvenile Delinquent&quot;, performed by fifty-year-old Billy De Wolfe. This was followed by another precursor to the rock musical, &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; (1960), which included two rock and roll numbers.

The rock musical became an important part of the musical theatre scene in the late 1960s with the hit show &quot;Hair&quot;. Styled &quot;The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical,&quot; the anti-war free-love hippie-themed, nude-scened &quot;Hair&quot; premiered in 1967 as the first production staged at The Public Theater. It moved to Broadway in October 1968. &quot;Your Own Thing&quot; also opened in 1968 and featured a gender-switching version of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;.

&quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, began as an album musical in 1970. The money made from album sales was used to fund the subsequent stage production in late 1971. This show and some other rock musicals that have no dialogue or are otherwise reminiscent of opera, with dramatic, emotional themes, are sometimes styled &quot;rock operas&quot;. The musical &quot;Godspell&quot; (1971), had similar religious themes (albeit with a less controversial treatment) and pop/rock influences. The genre continued to develop through the 1970s with shows such as &quot;Grease&quot; and &quot;Pippin&quot;. The rock musical soon moved in other directions with shows like &quot;The Wiz&quot;, &quot;Raisin&quot;, &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; and &quot;Purlie&quot;, which were heavily influenced by R&amp;B and soul music.

The rock musical saw a decline in popularity through the 1980s. Except for a few outposts of rock, like &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; (1982) and &quot;Chess&quot; (1986), audience tastes turned to shows with European pop scores, like &quot;Les Misérables&quot; and &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, as well as to more nostalgic fare. However, the rock musical achieved a renaissance in the 1990s, due in no small part to the popularity of Jonathan Larson&#x27;s rock musical &quot;Rent&quot; (1996). This was followed by Off-Broadway rock musicals like &quot;Bat Boy: The Musical&quot; (1997) and &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; (1998), John Cameron Mitchell&#x27;s Off-Broadway show about a transgender rocker. The end of the 1980s saw the beginning of a new form, jukebox musicals, such as &quot;Buddy – The Buddy Holly Story&quot;, &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; and &quot;Jersey Boys&quot;, which feature the songs of a popular band, performer or genre.

The rock musical has seen a resurgence since the late 1990s, with shows by composers like Elton John (&quot;Aida&quot;, 1998), as well as a number of successful jukebox musicals with rock scores. Recent major original rock musical productions include &quot;Spring Awakening&quot; (2007), &quot;Passing Strange&quot; and &quot;Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson&quot; (both 2008), &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; and &quot;Next to Normal&quot; (both 2009), &quot;American Idiot&quot; (2010) and &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; (2019).

==Analysis ==
In 2010, critic Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; pointed out that all four of the musicals nominated for the Tony Award for Best Musical that year could be described as rock musicals. He analyzed the history and future of rock on Broadway:
Rock’s takeover of Broadway was not the revolution that had been feared – or anticipated – ever since &quot;Hair&quot; ... Broadway held out for many years as a bastion against youth culture. ... Rock’s Broadway invasion has been, instead, a lengthy campaign of attrition, via demographics, shifting tastes and musicians’ ambitions. Every few years another production [was] touted as finally bringing full-fledged rock to musical theater: &quot;Rent&quot;, &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; ... &quot;Spring Awakening&quot;. Very gradually rock musicians have stopped treating Broadway as an adversary – or a punch line. And for fans it has become one more entertainment option, as prices for arena shows reach Broadway levels.

Pareles commented, &quot;rock has been transformed from nemesis to novelty to mainstay. ... Broadway productions can’t match the visceral impact – starting with volume – of a rock concert. (They try to make up for it with enthusiasm and slicker dancing.)&quot; Another problem for rock musicals is that rock shows &quot;still leave theatergoers complaining that the characters are hollow. ... [However,] Broadway does provide current rock two major incentives. As the artistic unit of the album has been shattered, down to a handful of shuffled MP3’s, musical theater offers a refuge for songwriters who want to tell longer stories, the way the songwriter Stew did in his autobiographical rock musical &quot;Passing Strange&quot;.&quot; Pareles also noted, &quot;Broadway may be the final place in America, if not the known universe, where rock still registers as rebellious. In the decorous little jewel boxes that are Broadway’s theaters, raunch seems raunchier, and rock musicals flaunt four-letter words and lascivious simulations. ... There are, of course, commercial incentives. Broadway’s unbudgingly middle-aged audience is currently a generation that grew up on rock and R&amp;B and generally feels more comfortable taking reserved seats in small theaters than plunging into the scrum of a standing-room club audience, or dealing with a rowdy arena mob.&quot;

Pareles attributed some of the new acceptance of rock as theatre to &quot;American Idol&quot; and its ilk, noting that some of the show&#x27;s stars have moved to theatre. Also, &quot;Rock’s old protestations of authenticity (versus Broadway contrivance) have been crumbling. As if glam rock in the ’70s and music video in the ’80s weren’t obvious enough in presenting rock as theater, pop’s video-era arena spectacles use the same technology as Las Vegas revues and Broadway shows.&quot; Another driver of rock&#x27;s acceptance is its own entry into middle age, Pareles said, noting that &quot;as rock’s history stretches out ever longer ... it offers just as much room for ... the familiarity and nostalgia that keep the jukebox musicals running. Still, Pareles concluded, &quot;the last, crucial thrill of a rock performance – the unpredictability – stays just beyond Broadway’s reach. Two nights after the official opening of &quot;American Idiot&quot;, Green Day itself played an unannounced encore. The show had poured on its razzle-dazzle. ... But Green Day set off pandemonium. ... Green Day’s members may not be able to act or execute choreography ... but they also hold rock’s wild card: the potential, realized or not, for spontaneity.&quot;

<doc id="404306" wikidata="Q7051810" url="?curid=404306" title="Normal function">
<text>In axiomatic set theory, a function is called normal (or a normal function) if it is continuous (with respect to the order topology) and strictly monotonically increasing. This is equivalent to the following two conditions:

# For every limit ordinal (i.e. is neither zero nor a successor), it is the case that .
# For all ordinals , it is the case that .

== Examples ==
A simple normal function is given by (see ordinal arithmetic). But is &quot;not&quot; normal because it is not continuous at any limit ordinal; that is, the inverse image of the one-point open set is the set , which is not open when is a limit ordinal. If is a fixed ordinal, then the functions , (for ), and (for ) are all normal.

More important examples of normal functions are given by the aleph numbers formula_1, which connect ordinal and cardinal numbers, and by the beth numbers formula_2.

== Properties ==
If is normal, then for any ordinal ,
Proof: If not, choose minimal such that . Since is strictly monotonically increasing, , contradicting minimality of .

Furthermore, for any non-empty set of ordinals, we have
Proof: &quot;≥&quot; follows from the monotonicity of and the definition of the supremum. For &quot;&quot;, set and consider three cases:
* if , then and ;
* if is a successor, then there exists in with , so that . Therefore, , which implies ;
* if is a nonzero limit, pick any , and an in such that (possible since ). Therefore, so that , yielding , as desired.

Every normal function has arbitrarily large fixed points; see the fixed-point lemma for normal functions for a proof. One can create a normal function , called the derivative of , such that is the -th fixed point of . For a hierarchy of normal functions, see Veblen functions.

<doc id="404312" wikidata="Q5471994" url="?curid=404312" title="Fort Schuyler">
<text>Fort Schuyler is a preserved 19th century fortification in the New York City borough of the Bronx. It houses a museum, the Stephen B. Luce Library, and the Marine Transportation Department and Administrative offices of the State University of New York Maritime College. It is considered one of the finest examples of early 19th century fortifications. The fort was named in honor of Major General Philip Schuyler of the Continental Army.

==History==
Fort Schuyler was one of many forts built along the east coast of the United States under the third system of US fortifications in the aftermath of the War of 1812, when it became apparent that the U.S. coast was poorly defended against foreign invasion. Fort Schuyler was begun in 1833 and dedicated in 1856 after 75% completion, though not garrisoned until 1861. The fort was strategically positioned to protect New York City from naval attack through Long Island Sound, guarding the eastern entrance to New York Harbor. It is located on Throggs Neck, the southeastern tip of the Bronx, where the East River meets Long Island Sound. Fort Totten, built during the Civil War and largely incomplete, faces it on the opposite side of the river. Their interlocking batteries created a bottleneck of defenses against ships attempting to approach New York City.

===Design and construction===
Fort Schuyler, at its peak, boasted 312 guns and could accommodate a garrison of 1,250 men. It was designed and built by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Its position on Throggs Neck allowed four of its five sides to cover the water approach to New York City. Each of the four seacoast fronts had three tiers of cannon; ten guns per tier except on the north front, which had fourteen guns per tier. The bottom two tiers inside the fort were casemated, while the third tier on the roof had barbette mounts. Relatively small &quot;tower bastions&quot; of a type developed by US Army engineer Joseph G. Totten were at the three points where the seacoast fronts met. Each of these had twelve flank howitzers to protect the curtain walls of the fronts against assault, along with three heavy seacoast guns. Behind the fort were an extensive hornwork (unique in the third system) and an advanced redoubt (later demolished) to defend against a land attack. The hornwork had two demi-bastions protecting its face against a direct assault, along with a large ravelin extending northwest along the peninsula to break up an attack. Two additional demi-bastions protected the gap between the hornwork and the main fort. The demi-bastions and redoubt were armed with several flank howitzers each.

===Civil War===

During the American Civil War, Fort Schuyler held as many as 500 prisoners of war from the Confederate States Army and military convicts from the Union Army. It also included the McDougall Hospital, which had a capacity of 2,000 beds. The fort was well designed for its time, it is said to have had one of the most effective waste removal systems ever seen in a fort from this time period.

Fort Schuyler was also a mobilization and training center. Units trained at the fort before heading to combat included the 5th New York Volunteer Infantry &quot;Duryee&#x27;s Zouaves&quot;, the First California Regiment (later 71st Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment) under Senator and Colonel Edward Dickinson Baker, and the 69th and 88th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiments (the 1st and 2nd Regiments of Meagher&#x27;s &quot;Irish Brigade&quot;). From January 1863 until March 1864, the fort itself was garrisoned by the 20th Independent Battery, New York Volunteer Artillery, a unit originally recruited to fight in the war as part of the Anthon Battalion of Volunteer Light Artillery.


Duty at the fort was reported to be a dull assignment as the men took the roles of guards and hospital stewards, not artillerymen. From July until August 1865 the fort was garrisoned by companies A, B, C, F, G, H and I of the Anderson Zouaves (companies D and E being assigned to Fort Wood on Bedloes Island), upon their return from service with the VI Corps of the Army of the Potomac and duty in the defenses of Washington, D.C. The Anderson Zouaves finally mustered out from Fort Schuyler on August 30, 1865.

===Endicott era===
A ten-gun battery was built 1873–1876 as part of a general fort improvement program, along with a mine casemate (bunker) for a controlled minefield in the river, Fort Totten being an experimental station for coast defense minefields. Later, Fort Schuyler received several modern coastal artillery gun batteries under the Endicott Program, completed 1898-1900 as part of the Coast Defenses of Eastern New York, which also included new batteries at Fort Totten and Fort Slocum on Davids&#x27; Island. These included Battery Gansevoort with two 12-inch guns on disappearing carriages, Battery Hazzard with two 10-inch disappearing guns, Battery Bell with two 5-inch guns on retractable balanced pillar carriages, and Battery Beecher with two 3-inch guns on retractable masking parapet carriages. The forts were initially garrisoned by heavy artillery companies, which became coast artillery companies in 1901, and part of the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps in 1907, including US regular army, New York State Militia, and New York National Guard units. However, soon after completion the defenses of the East River were largely superseded by the Coast Defenses of Long Island Sound on islands east of Long Island, including Fort H. G. Wright on Fishers Island.

After the American entry into World War I in 1917, Battery Bell&#x27;s 5-inch guns were removed for potential service in France as field guns on wheeled carriages. Most of the 5-inch guns removed under this program were sent to France with the 69th Artillery Regiment of the Coast Artillery Corps. However, the regiment did not complete training before the Armistice and did not see action. The 5-inch guns were never returned to the forts and were scrapped circa 1920. Prior to 1922 one 12-inch gun at Battery Gansevoort was dismounted; this may have been in 1917–18 as potential railway artillery. At some time, probably in 1918-1920, a battery of two 3-inch antiaircraft guns was built at the fort. In 1920, with the war over, Battery Beecher&#x27;s 3-inch guns were scrapped as part of a general removal from service of the M1898 3-inch gun. The 10-inch guns of Battery Hazzard followed in 1930; the reason for this is unclear. In 1934 the fort was disarmed and turned over to the state. All of the Endicott-era batteries were demolished in the 1950s.

===College===
In the late 1920s Fort Schuyler was placed on the abandoned list by the U.S. Army. When this was done, it was targeted for acquisition by Robert Moses for conversion to a state park as well as a permanent shore base for the New York State Merchant Marine Academy (now SUNY Maritime College). A protracted political struggle ensued, but eventually the academy forces prevailed. The site was transferred to the state of New York in 1934 during the Great Depression, then rehabilitated by the Works Progress Administration and dedicated to the school in 1938. The college, which was founded in 1874, still occupies the site, and in 1948 was one of the original 29 founding schools to be incorporated into the State University of New York as the State University of New York Maritime College. The fort has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1976.

===Maritime Industry Museum===

In 1986, a portion of Fort Schuyler was dedicated as the Maritime Industry Museum. The museum houses exhibits on the history of the United States maritime industry, including commercial shipping, the merchant marine, and the port of New York, as well as exhibits on the history of Fort Schuyler. It is open to the public on weekdays.

<doc id="404316" wikidata="Q980121" url="?curid=404316" title="Last Time Around">
<text>Last Time Around is the third and final studio album by the Canadian-American folk rock band Buffalo Springfield, released in July 1968. The line-up at the time officially consisted of Neil Young, Stephen Stills, Richie Furay, Dewey Martin, Bruce Palmer, and Jim Messina, though the band itself was essentially broken up and the album was put together from previous recordings, some made up to a year earlier. Jim Messina acted as the album producer and mixing engineer, with input from Furay, as the two compiled the record to fulfil the band&#x27;s last contractual obligation to its label. A number of guest musicians (some uncredited) appeared on the album, notably pedal steel guitar player Rusty Young. 

By the time this album was released, the members were already involved in their next projects: Richie Furay, Jim Messina, and Rusty Young were busy forming the country-rock band Poco, Stephen Stills was forming Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, and Neil Young was performing with a group known as The Rockets which would later become the band Crazy Horse. Dewey Martin tried to revive the Buffalo Springfield name with new musicians, but he was sued by Stills and Young to prevent him from doing so. Bruce Palmer briefly joined Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, but legal problems kept him from producing much musical output during the rest of the 1960s.

== History ==
&quot;Last Time Around&quot; was compiled by Jim Messina and Furay to fulfil the band&#x27;s last contractual obligation to its label. By the time it was completed the group had functionally disbanded, with the cover photo of the group consisting of a montage and the five original members only recording together on one track, &quot;On the Way Home&quot;.

The album contained songs that were important to the authors. Neil Young has performed both &quot;I Am a Child&quot; and &quot;On the Way Home&quot; in concert throughout his career, the latter both solo and with CSNY, the Transband and the Bluenotes. &quot;Kind Woman&quot; became one of Richie Furay&#x27;s best known songs; he performed it with Poco and throughout his solo career. Stephen Stills merged &quot;Questions&quot; with a new song, &quot;Carry On&quot;, which became the opening track on &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; and was a major part of Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young&#x27;s concert repertoire. The lyrics to &quot;The Hour of Not Quite Rain&quot; were the result of an August 1967 contest run by Los Angeles radio station KHJ. Entrants would write a poem to be set to music and recorded by the Buffalo Springfield. The prize was $1000 plus publishing royalties. The winning entry was written by Micki Callen.

==Production==
The album was recorded between February 26, 1967 and March 1968 at Sunset Sound, Los Angeles. Additional work was done at Atlantic Studios, New York City on &quot;Pretty Girl Why&quot; and &quot;Kind Woman&quot;. Jim Messina was the album producer and mixing engineer, with input from Furay. A number of guest musicians (some uncredited) appeared on the album, notably pedal steel guitar player Rusty Young. Original bassist Bruce Palmer only appears on &quot;On the Way Home&quot;. His face is shown on the back cover photo montage with a humorous, partially obscured, &quot;mad&quot; sign aligned, due to Palmer resembling Alfred E. Neuman in the shot.

== Critical reception ==
Barry Gifford of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called &quot;Last Time Around&quot; Buffalo Springfield&#x27;s &quot;most beautiful record&quot; and &quot;a final testament to their multi-talent&quot;. Robert Christgau, writing for &quot;Esquire&quot;, called it a &quot;beautiful farewell album&quot; of &quot;countrified music&quot;, in which &quot;country elements are incorporated into a total style&quot;. Richie Unterberger was less enthusiastic in a retrospective review for AllMusic. He found Young&#x27;s songs for the album &quot;outstanding&quot;, but believed Stills&#x27; songwriting was a decline from the group&#x27;s previous albums. Young has been especially critical of the album, saying in an interview that &quot;It was such a disgraceful mess that I can&#x27;t bear to listen to it again. The mixes are incredibly awful, a very disturbing point,&quot; and saying in another interview that &quot;the Springfield&#x27;s last real album was &#x27;Buffalo Springfield Again&#x27;.&quot;
It was voted number 505 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000).

<text>Mohammad Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai (born 19 May 1949) is an Afghan former politician, academic, and economist who served as the president of Afghanistan from September 2014 until August 2021, when his government was overthrown by the Taliban.

Ghani was born in Logar, Afghanistan. After his grade-school education in Afghanistan, he spent much of his time abroad, studying in Lebanon and the United States. After receiving his PhD in cultural anthropology from Columbia University in 1983, he taught at various institutions and was an associate professor of anthropology at Johns Hopkins University. For much of the 1990s, he worked at the World Bank. In December 2001, he returned to Afghanistan after the collapse of the Taliban government. He then served as finance minister in Hamid Karzai&#x27;s cabinet. He resigned in December 2004 to become the dean of Kabul University. In 2009, Ghani ran in the 2009 Afghan presidential election but came in fourth.

In 2014, Ghani became president after winning the controversial 2014 Afghan presidential election. The election was so disputed that negotiations between Ghani and rival Abdullah Abdullah were mediated by the United States. Ghani became president and Abdullah chief executive, with power split 50-50. On 18 February 2020, Ghani was re-elected after a delayed result from the 2019 presidential elections. He was sworn in on 9 March 2020. As president, Ghani was known for his intensity and energetic speeches. He aimed to transform Afghanistan into a technocratic state, winning him support from youth and urban demographics. His cabinets were relatively young and well-educated. Ghani made efforts to make peace with Taliban insurgents and improving relations with Pakistan. However many of his promises, such as fighting corruption and turning the country into a trade hub between Central and South Asia, were left unfulfilled. His position was also weakened by political rivalries, his attempt to lessen the power of ex-warlords, and an uneasy relationship with the United States regarding the war. He was also criticized for being aloof and short-tempered, including being in denial during the Taliban&#x27;s offensive in 2021.

On 15 August 2021, his term ended abruptly, as the Taliban took over Kabul. Ghani and staff fled Afghanistan and took refuge in the United Arab Emirates. He later stated he left in order to avoid further violence, and that staying and dying would have accomplished nothing but adding another tragedy to Afghanistan&#x27;s history. However, he was also condemned across various spectrums for abandoning Afghanistan to the Taliban and has been accused of corruption during his administration.

== Early life (1949–1983) ==
Ghani was born on 19 May 1949 in the Logar Province in the Kingdom of Afghanistan to Shah Pesand, a clerk worker, and Kawbaba Lodin, who hailed from Kandahar. He belongs to the Ahmadzai Pashtun tribe.

=== Education ===
Ghani&#x27;s grade-school education was mostly done in Afghanistan. He attended secondary-level schooling in Kabul. But for the 1966–1967 school year, Ghani studied as a foreign exchange student at Lake Oswego High School (LOHS) in Lake Oswego, Oregon under the name Ashraf Ahmad. The American Field Service sponsored his foreign exchange stay. He served on the student council.

In 1973, he received a Bachelor of Arts in political studies from the American University of Beirut in Lebanon. There, he met his future wife, Rula. From 1973 to 1977, Ghani served on the faculty of Kabul University and Aarhus University in Denmark in 1977.

In 1977, he received a Master&#x27;s in cultural anthropology from Columbia University on a government scholarship.

While Ghani originally intended to stay for two years, the outbreak of the 1978 Saur Revolution led to much of his male family being imprisoned. He stayed at Columbia and received a PhD in cultural anthropology in 1983. His doctoral thesis was titled &#x27;Production and domination: Afghanistan, 1747–1901&#x27;. His thesis advisors included Conrad M. Arensberg, Richard Bulliet, Morton Fried, and Robert F. Murphy.

== Career before returning to Afghanistan (1983–2001) ==

=== Academic career (1983–1991) ===
In 1983, after receiving his PhD, he taught briefly at the University of California, Berkeley, and then at Johns Hopkins University as an associate professor from 1983 to 1991. His academic research was on state-building and social transformation. In 1985, he completed a year of fieldwork researching Pakistani madrassas as a Fulbright Scholar.

=== World Bank (1991–2001) ===
In 1991, Ghani became the Lead Anthropologist at the World Bank. During this time, he spent five years working in China, India, and Russia working on various projects. After the mid-nineties, he switched to working on the Bank&#x27;s social policy, reviewing country strategies, and designing reform programs. While working for the Bank, he attended the leadership training programs of Harvard-INSEAD and World Bank-Stanford Graduate School of Business.

== Return to Afghanistan (2001–2013) ==
In December 2001, he finally returned to Afghanistan after 24 years of absence. After the ousting of the Taliban that year, Ghani became a key figure in the Afghan Interim Administration, which lasted from December 2001 until July 2002.

He left his job at the World Bank and joined the United Nations as Special Adviser to Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations Secretary-General&#x27;s special envoy to Afghanistan. In this role, he worked on design and implementation of the Bonn Agreement, which outlined the post-Taliban government of Afghanistan. During this time, he also worked &quot;pro bono&quot; as Chief Adviser to then-interim president Hamid Karzai. He approved the constitution and worked on preparing the Loya Jirgas that eventually elected Karzai.

=== Minister of Finance (2002–2004) ===
On 2 June 2002, Ghani became finance minister of the new Transitional Afghan government under President Karzai. This government would last until 2004, when it was to be replaced by a &quot;fully representative government&quot;.

He carried out extensive reforms, including issuing a new currency, computerizing treasury operations, instituting a single treasury account, adopting a policy of balanced budgets and using budgets as the central policy instrument, centralizing revenue collection, tariff reform and overhauling customs. He instituted regular reporting to the cabinet, the public and international stakeholders as a tool of transparency and accountability, and required donors to focus their interventions on three sectors, improving accountability with government counterparts and preparing a development strategy that held Afghans more accountable for their own future development. He assisted with the National Solidarity Program, which covered 13,000 of the country&#x27;s estimated 20,000 villages.

=== Chancellor of Kabul University (2004–2008) ===
After Karzai was elected in October 2004, Ghani had declined to join his cabinet and instead asked to be appointed to the chancellorship at Kabul University. From 22 December 2004 to 21 December 2008, Ghani thus served as Chancellor of Kabul University. He focused on rebuilding the university and its resources after years of conflict and neglect under the Taliban government.

In January 2005, Ghani co-founded the Institute for State Effectiveness with Clare Lockhart, of which he was chairman. The institute focused on the role of the state and transparency in governance. The organization&#x27;s work was discussed at the UN and World Bank in September 2005. With Lockhart, he later published the book &quot;Fixing Failed States: A Framework for Rebuilding a Fractured World&quot; in 2008.

In 2005, he became a member of the Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor, an independent initiative hosted by the United Nations Development Programme.

Throughout 2005, Ghani gave many keynote speeches across the world, including the American Bar Association&#x27;s International Rule of Law Symposium, the Trans-Atlantic Policy Network, the annual meeting of the Norwegian Government&#x27;s development staff, CSIS&#x27;s meeting on UN reform, the UN–OECD–World Bank&#x27;s meeting on Fragile States and TED Global.

He also regularly gave interviews and contributed to the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

At the end of 2006, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; ran a front-page report speculating that Ghani was a top candidate to succeed Kofi Annan as secretary-general of the United Nations. He was quoted as saying, &quot;I hope to win, through ideas.&quot;

===2009 presidential election===

In January 2009, an article by Ahmad Majidyar of the American Enterprise Institute included Ghani on a list of fifteen possible candidates in the 2009 Afghan presidential election.

On 7 May 2009, Ashraf Ghani registered as a candidate in the 2009 Afghan presidential election. Ghani&#x27;s campaign emphasized the importance of a representative administration, good governance, a dynamic economy and employment opportunities for the Afghan people. Unlike other major candidates, Ghani asked the Afghan diaspora to support his campaign and provide financial support. He appointed Mohammed Ayub Rafiqi as one of his vice president candidate deputies, and hired Clinton campaign chief strategist James Carville as a campaign advisor.

Preliminary results placed Ghani fourth in a field of 38, securing roughly 3% of the votes.

=== Chairman of Transition Coordination Commission (2010–2013) ===
From 2010 to 1 October 2013, he served as chairman of the Afghan Transition Coordination Commission (TCC), which was responsible for transferring power from ISAF/NATO troops to Afghan Security Forces. He travelled across Afghanistan extensively during this time.

On 28 January 2010, Ghani attended the International Conference on Afghanistan in London, pledging his support to help rebuild their country. Ghani presented his ideas to Karzai as an example of the importance of cooperation among Afghans and with the international community, supporting Karzai&#x27;s reconciliation strategy. Ghani said hearing Karzai&#x27;s second inaugural address in November 2009 and his pledges to fight corruption, promote reconciliation and replace international security forces persuaded him to help.

Ghani resigned his post on 1 October 2013 in order to run for president in 2014.

==Presidency (2014–2021)==

After announcing his candidacy for the 2014 elections, Ghani tapped General Abdul Rashid Dostum, a prominent Uzbek politician and former military official in Karzai&#x27;s government, and Sarwar Danish, an ethnic Hazara who served as the justice minister in Karzai&#x27;s cabinet, as his vice presidential candidates. 
 

After none of the candidates managed to win more than 50% of the vote in the first round of the election, Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah, the two frontrunners from the first round, contested in a runoff election, which was held on 14 June 2014.

Initial results from the run-off elections showed Ghani as the overwhelming favourite to win the elections. However, allegations of electoral fraud resulted in a stalemate, along with threats of violence and the formation of a parallel government by the camp of his opponent, Abdullah Abdullah. On 7 August 2014, US Secretary of State John Kerry flew to Kabul to broker a deal that outlined an extensive audit of nearly 8 million votes and formation of a national unity government with a new role for a chief executive officer who would carry out meaningful functions within the president&#x27;s administration. After a three-month audit process, which was supervised by the United Nations with financial support from the U.S. government, the Independent Election Commission announced Ghani as president after Ghani agreed to a national unity deal. Initially, the election commission said it would not formally announce specific results. It later released a statement that said Ghani managed to secure 55.4% and Abdullah Abdullah secured 43.5% of the vote, although it declined to release the individual vote results. In September 2019, an explosion near an election rally attended by President Ashraf Ghani killed 24 people and injured 31 others, but Ghani was unhurt.

Ghani signed a law in September 2020 requiring mothers&#x27; names to be added to children&#x27;s ID cards, in addition to fathers&#x27; names, which was seen as a win for women&#x27;s rights activists in Afghanistan.

At age 65, Ghani became the oldest inaugurated Afghan ruler since the foundation of the Durrani Empire in 1747. At his 2019 re-election, at age 70, he overtook Mohammed Daoud Khan to become the oldest incumbent president.

=== Economy and trade ===
During his tenure, Ghani strengthened ties with Central Asian countries such as Uzbekistan, with which it has made deals to increase mutual trading. New trade routes have also been launched within the wider region. The Chabahar Port in Iran allows increased trading with India whilst avoiding Pakistani territory. Plans for a railway line from Khaf, Iran to Herat, Afghanistan were set in motion in 2018, with the railway being completed in 2020. In 2017, a railway line from Turkmenistan was extended to Aqina in Afghanistan, the precursor of the &quot;Lapis Lazuli&quot; transport corridor that was signed by Ghani that same year and would link Afghanistan to the Caucasus and the Black Sea. Other regional projects include the CASA-1000 hydroelectricity transmission from Central Asia, and the TAPI gas pipeline, expected to be completed by 2018 and 2019 respectively. In January 2018, at the inauguration of the Khan Steel iron smelting plant in Kabul, Ghani said that he is aiming for Afghanistan to become a steel exporter.

In 2015, a survey conducted by the Afghan news channel TOLO News showed that the popularity of Ashraf Ghani in Afghanistan had fallen dramatically, with only 27.5% of respondents claiming that they were satisfied with his leadership.

===Relations with Pakistan and India===
Since his election, Ghani wanted to improve relations with Pakistan, which in turn could pave the way for peace talks with the Taliban. He refused to recognize the border with Pakistan, known as the Durand Line, which Pakistan views as an existential issue. He made his first visit to Pakistan on 14 November 2014, meeting Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. However, after many terror attacks in Afghanistan which were largely blamed on Pakistan, and failed Taliban peace talks, Ghani grew increasingly cold to Pakistan. Ghani claimed that Pakistan had hit an &quot;undeclared war of aggression&quot; against Afghanistan. Following two deadly Taliban/Haqqani attacks in Kabul in January 2018, Ghani called Pakistan the &quot;center of the Taliban&quot;. Tolo News while quoting an unnamed source alleged that Ashraf Ghani had refused to take a call from the Pakistani prime minister, instead he sent a NDS delegation to hand over evidence that the terrorists were supported by Pakistan. However, Afghan envoy Omar Zakhilwal rejected such reports regarding Ghani&#x27;s phone call rejection with Pakistan prime minister. He stated that no phone call took place between the two leaders and that such reports are baseless. At a July 2021 conference in Tashkent, Ghani accused Pakistan of fomenting violence in Afghanistan through the Taliban; Pakistan accused Afghanistan of helping insurgent groups inside Pakistan (the Tehreek-e-Taliban and the Balochistan Liberation Army).

One of Ghani&#x27;s major objectives was to improve South Asian ties to transform the region&#x27;s economy. On his first official visit to India he envisioned &quot;breakfast in Delhi, lunch in Peshawar, and dinner in Kabul–that&#x27;s the world we seek!&quot; He voiced the idea that a stable Afghanistan can act as a bridge between Central, South, and West Asia, given the country&#x27;s centrist location.

Ghani had strong ties with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi. After Ghani&#x27;s escape from Afghanistan, Modi spoke of his friendship with him on NPR.

===Relations with Taliban===

In an interview with Vice News, Ghani said that his &#x27;heart breaks for [the] Taliban&#x27;. He further stated that &#x27;Talibans are Afghans and he is president of all Afghans&#x27;. Ashraf Ghani also said that he is willing to offer Afghan passports to the Taliban and to recognise them as a legitimate political group in Afghanistan, as an attempt to strike a peace deal with them.

In March 2021, in an attempt to advance peace talks, Ghani expressed his intentions of convincing the Taliban to hold fresh elections and allow forming of a new government through a democratic process.

Ghani blamed the Taliban for the 2021 Kabul school bombing, but Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid denied involvement in the attack, in a message released to the media. Many of the Kabul residents held Ghani responsible for the attack and raised loud chants against the Afghan government and security forces.

On 2 August 2021, Ghani blamed the sudden withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan for the advance of the Taliban and said the latter had not cut ties with terrorist organizations and had escalated attacks against women, which the Taliban denied. On 11 August 2021, Ghani appealed to local warlords and private militias to fight the Taliban and also appealed to a popular uprising against the Taliban. On the same day, Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan reported that the Taliban would not negotiate or hold peace talks with the government as long as Ghani remains as the president.

===Flight from Afghanistan===
The Taliban took control of Afghanistan on 15 August and Ghani was deposed. That day, Ghani left Afghanistan with his wife and two close aides to Uzbekistan as the Taliban captured Kabul. The Arg, the presidential palace, was captured a few hours later by the group. Afghan officials stated that Ghani had left the presidential palace Sunday morning to go to the US embassy. He has since been described as the former president. A senior cabinet minister said that Ghani fled to Tajikistan, however it was then claimed that he landed in Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan.

Later that day, Ghani wrote on his Facebook that he thought it was better for him to leave in order to avoid bloodshed and called on the Taliban to protect civilians and said the Taliban now faced a &quot;historic test&quot;. On 18 August 2021, the United Arab Emirates acknowledged that Ghani and his family were in that country for &quot;humanitarian considerations.&quot; He was granted stay by the government on humanitarian grounds.

On 17 August, the Taliban announced that they were actively working to form a government that would be announced over the coming days. The same day, first vice president Amrullah Saleh asserted that he was acting president, claiming that if the president is absent, escapes, resigns or dies then the first vice president becomes acting president. In an 18 August taped address from the UAE, Ghani said he fled to avoid being hanged, and vowed to eventually return to Afghanistan.

Former MP Elay Ershad, who had worked as Ghani&#x27;s spokeswoman, was scathing in criticism. She said he was &quot;gutless&quot; for fleeing the country. Afghanistan&#x27;s Ambassador to Tajikistan, Mohammad Zahir Aghbar, stated that Interpol should apprehend Ghani for embezzling public funds. The Russian embassy in Kabul alleged that Ghani fled with &quot;four cars and a helicopter&quot; full of cash and had to leave some money behind as it would not all fit in. Ashraf Ghani, speaking on 18 August 2021 in UAE, has stated that the accusations are baseless. To this day, no evidence of the accusation has been presented. A former senior official stated that Ghani left in haste. He said &quot;He went to Termez in Uzbekistan, where he spent one night and then from there to the UAE (United Arab Emirates). There was no money with him. He literally just had the clothes he was wearing.&quot;

On 8 September 2021, Ghani released a video where he apologized to the Afghan people and repeated that he left to avoid &quot;bloody street fighting&quot;. He also strongly denied stealing money from the country when he fled. Ghani said that &quot;leaving Kabul was the most difficult decision of my life, but I believed it was the only way to keep the guns silent and save Kabul and her 6 million citizens.&quot;

The United Nations removed Ghani&#x27;s name from its list of heads of state on 15 February 2022. In May 2022, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) released a report on the collapse of the Afghan National Army (ANA) and the Afghan government. The SIGAR described Ghani as a &quot;paranoid president... afraid of his own countrymen&quot; and that many of Ghani&#x27;s dismissals of top military generals &quot;undermined morale&quot; of the ANA. The SIGAR report also reported that Ghani feared that the US was &quot;plotting a coup&quot; against him.

SIGAR released a report on 9 August 2022 on the investigation of Ghani&#x27;s flight from Kabul. The report could not corroborate the Russian embassy&#x27;s claim that he fled with bags of millions of dollars, but added that it was &quot;unlikely to be true&quot; that he and his aides &quot;managed to pack tens of millions in cash&quot;, citing difficulties in vehicular transportation, helicopter load, and the short period of time. On the anniversary of Ghani&#x27;s departure, he commented:
He also rejected once again the reported millions of cash he flew in, citing a SIGAR report from June 2022 which found that the rumored amount would have been difficult to conceal: &quot;it would be somewhat larger than a standard American three-seater couch. This block would have weighed 3,722 pounds, or nearly two tonnes. The Mi-17 helicopters that the group flew on do not have separate cargo holds. Therefore, all of the cargo would have been visible in the cabin next to the passengers.&quot;

==Political views==
Ghani is a progressive modernist with the belief and goal to &quot;transform Afghanistan from a tribal, patronage-based society to a modern technocratic state&quot;. He is a fond admirer of both King Amanullah Khan, who was a progressive Afghan monarch in the 1920s, and General &quot;Sardar&quot; Mohammad Daoud Khan, a former prime minister of the Kingdom of Afghanistan, who served as the first president of the Republic of Afghanistan in the 1970s. 

On 2 February 2020, Ashraf Ghani made controversial remarks while talking about Timur and Muhammad of Ghor which angered the Uzbek population of Afghanistan. He made those remarks while delivering a speech to a group of Afghan students on History, Culture, and the National Identity. Ghani stated that Muhammad of Ghor destroyed Afghanistan&#x27;s central irrigation system while Genghis Khan demolished the irrigation system of the northern provinces. Ghani also referred to Turkic conqueror Amir Timur by his Persian-origin epithet &quot;Timur Lang&quot; (Timur the Lame) and stated that Timur wiped-out the irrigation system for Sistan, Farah, and Helmand provinces. His remarks regarding Timur were considered offensive to Uzbeks, according to experts, and drew condemnation from Afghanistan&#x27;s Uzbek population.

Following his remarks, residents of Faryab province staged protests and demanded an apology from Ashraf Ghani. The protesters threatened that they would take serious action if Ghani did not apologize for his remarks. Abdul Rashid Dostum, former vice president of Afghanistan and an ethnic Uzbek, also demanded an apology from Ashraf Ghani. Bashir Ahmad Tahyanj, spokesperson of the National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan, said that &quot;Ghani has a personal bias towards historic figures, honorable ethnicities, the history and culture of the people who live in Afghanistan. This is not his first time.&quot; However, in a statement, the Afghan government palace defended Ghani&#x27;s remarks and stated that &quot;what Ghani said about Timur was not offensive or insulting&quot;.

==Personal life==

Ashraf Ghani is married to Rula Saade, who was born into a Lebanese Christian family. The couple married after they met during their studies at the American University of Beirut, Lebanon during the 1970s. They eventually settled in the United States and obtained U.S. citizenship. However, Ghani renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2009 so he could run in Afghan elections.

Ashraf and Rula Ghani have two children, a daughter, Mariam, a Brooklyn-based visual artist, and a son, Tarek, who was a national security and foreign policy advisor to 2020 presidential candidate, Pete Buttigieg. Both were born in the United States and carry U.S. citizenship and passports. In an unusual move for a politician in Afghanistan, Ghani at his presidential inauguration in 2014 publicly thanked his wife, acknowledging her with an Afghan name, Bibi Gul. &quot;I want to thank my partner, Bibi Gul, for supporting me and Afghanistan,&quot; he said. &quot;She has always supported Afghan women and I hope she continues to do so.&quot;

Ashraf Ghani also owns 200 acres of land in Surkhab area of Logar province. Abdul Baqi Ahmadzai, who is close to Ashraf Ghani, claims that Ashraf Ghani inherited a lot of land from his father. However, Ashraf Ghani bought this 200 acres of land separately in Logar province.

Ghani lost most of his stomach after developing cancer in the 1990s. It is said that Ghani wakes up every morning before five, and reads for two to three hours.

He is the older brother of Hashmat Ghani Ahmadzai, an Afghan politician who is the Grand Council Chieftain of the Kuchis. Unlike his brother, Hashmat Ghani did not flee Afghanistan. When interviewed, he said, &quot;If I were to flee what would become of my people, my tribe. My roots are here, what kind of message would that send if I just fled and left my people in their time of need?&quot;

==Publications==
Ghani is the coauthor with Clare Lockhart of &quot;Fixing Failed States: A Framework for Rebuilding a Fractured World&quot; (2008). Along with Lockhart, he was listed on the &#x27;Top 100 global thinkers list&#x27; for 2010 by &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;.

<text>New Castile ( ) is a historic region of Spain. It roughly corresponds to the medieval Moorish Taifa of Toledo, taken during the &quot;Reconquista&quot; of the peninsula by Christians and thus becoming the southern part of Castile. The extension of New Castile was formally defined after the 1833 territorial division of Spain as the sum of the following provinces: Ciudad Real, Cuenca, Guadalajara, Madrid and Toledo.

Key to the reconquest of New Castile were the capture of Toledo in 1085, ending the Taifa&#x27;s Kingdom of Toledo, and the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212. It continued to be formally called &quot;Kingdom of Toledo&quot; even though it was under the Crown of Castile. Then it started to be called &quot;New Castile&quot; in the 18th century.

&quot;New Castile&quot; is separated from &quot;Old Castile&quot; to the north by the Sistema Central range of mountains. In the current territorial division of Spain, it covers the autonomous communities of Madrid and Castile–La Mancha (which also includes Albacete).

<text>Hampi or Hampe (), also referred to as the Group of Monuments at Hampi, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the town of Hampi in Vijayanagara district, east-central Karnataka, India. Hampi predates the Vijayanagara Empire; it is mentioned in the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and the Puranas of Hinduism as Pampa Devi Tirtha Kshetra. Hampi continues as a religious centre, with the Virupaksha Temple, an active Adi Shankara-linked monastery and various monuments belonging to the old city.

Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire from 1336 to 1565 (as Vijayanagara), when it was abandoned. It was a fortified city. Chronicles left by Persian and European travellers, particularly the Portuguese, say that Hampi was a prosperous, wealthy and grand city near the Tungabhadra River, with numerous temples, farms and trading markets. Hampi-Vijayanagara is estimated to be the world&#x27;s second-largest city by 1500, after Beijing, and probably India&#x27;s richest at that time, attracting traders from Persia and Portugal. The Vijayanagara Empire was defeated by a coalition of Muslim sultanates; its capital was conquered, pillaged and destroyed by Muslim armies in 1565, after which Hampi remained in ruins.

Located in Karnataka near the small modern town of Hampi with the city of Hosapete away, Hampi&#x27;s ruins are spread over and it has been described by UNESCO as an &quot;austere, grandiose site&quot; of more than 1,600 surviving remains of the last great Hindu kingdom in South India that includes &quot;forts, riverside features, royal and sacred complexes, temples, shrines, pillared halls, mandapas, memorial structures, water structures and others&quot;.

==Etymology==
The name was derived from the old name of the Tungabhadra River which was Pampa, so the name Hampi is the English version of the Kannada name Hampe.

==Location==
Hampi is situated on the banks of the Tungabhadra River in the eastern part of central Karnataka near the state border with Andhra Pradesh. It is southeast of the Badami and Aihole archaeological sites.

The synonym &quot;Hampi&quot;—traditionally known as &quot;Pampa-kshetra&quot;, &quot;Kishkindha-kshetra&quot; or &quot;Bhaskara-kshetra&quot;—is derived from Pampa, another name of the goddess Parvati in Hindu theology. According to mythology, the maiden Parvati (who is a reincarnation of Shiva&#x27;s previous wife, Sati) resolves to marry the loner ascetic Shiva. Her parents learn of her desire and discourage her, but she pursues her desire. Shiva is lost in yogic meditation, oblivious to the world; Parvati appeals to the gods for help to awaken him and gain his attention. Indra sends Kamadeva — the Hindu god of desire, erotic love, attraction, and affection—to awake Shiva from meditation. Kama reaches Shiva and shoots an arrow of desire. Shiva opens his third eye in his forehead and burns Kama to ashes.

Parvati does not lose her hope or her resolve to win over Shiva; she begins to live like him and engage in the same activities—asceticism, yogin and tapasya—awakening him and attracting his interest. Shiva meets Parvati in disguised form and tries to discourage her, telling her Shiva&#x27;s weaknesses and personality problems. Parvati refuses to listen and insists in her resolve. Shiva finally accepts her and they get married. Kama was later brought back to life after the marriage of Shiva and Parvati. According to Sthala Purana, Parvati (Pampa) pursued her ascetic, yogini lifestyle on Hemakuta Hill, now a part of Hampi, to win and bring ascetic Shiva back into householder life. Shiva is also called Pampapati (meaning &quot;husband of Pampa&quot;). The river near the Hemakuta Hill came to be known as Pampa river. The Sanskrit word Pampa morphed into the Kannada word Hampa and the place Parvati pursued Shiva came to be known as Hampe or Hampi.

The site was an early medieval era pilgrimage place known as Pampakshetra. Its fame came from the Kishkindha chapters of the Hindu epic Ramayana, where Rama and Lakshmana meet Hanuman, Sugriva and the monkey army in their search for kidnapped Sita. The Hampi area has many close resemblances to the place described in the epic. The regional tradition believes that it is that place mentioned in the Ramayana, attracting pilgrims. It was brought to light by an engineer named colonel Colin Mackenzie during the 1800s.

===Ancient to 14th century CE===

Emperor Ashoka&#x27;s Rock Edicts in Nittur and Udegolan—both in Bellary district 269-232 BCE—suggest this region was part of the Maurya Empire during the 3rd century BCE. A Brahmi inscription and a terracotta seal dating to about the 2nd century CE have been found during site excavations. The town is mentioned in Badami Chalukya&#x27;s inscriptions as Pampapura, dating from between the 6th and 8th centuries.

By the 10th century, it had become a centre of religious and educational activities during the rule of the Hindu kings Kalyana Chalukyas, whose inscriptions state that the kings made land grants to the Virupaksha temple. Several inscriptions from the 11th to 13th centuries are about the Hampi site, with a mention of gifts to goddess Hampa-devi. Between the 12th and 14th centuries, Hindu kings of the Hoysala Empire of South India built temples to Durga, Hampadevi and Shiva, according to an inscription dated about 1,199 CE. Hampi became the second royal residence; one of the Hoysala kings was known as &quot;Hampeya-Odeya&quot; or &quot;lord of Hampi&quot;. According to Burton Stein, the Hoysala-period inscriptions call Hampi by alternate names such as Virupakshapattana, Vijaya Virupakshapura in honour of the old Virupaksha (Shiva) temple there.

===14th century and after===

The armies of the Delhi Sultanate, those of Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad bin Tughlaq, invaded and pillaged South India. The Hoysala Empire and its capital Dvarasamudra in southern Karnataka was plundered and destroyed in the early 14th century by the armies of Alauddin Khalji, and again in 1326 CE by the army of Muhammad bin Tughlaq.

The Kampili kingdom in north-central Karnataka followed the collapse of Hoysala Empire. It was a short-lived Hindu kingdom with its capital about from Hampi. The Kampili kingdom ended after an invasion by the Muslim armies of Muhammad bin Tughlaq. The Hindu women of Kampili committed &quot;jauhar&quot; (ritual mass suicide) when the Kampili soldiers faced defeat by Tughlaq&#x27;s army. In 1336 CE, the Vijayanagara Empire arose from the ruins of the Kampili kingdom. It grew into one of the famed Hindu empires of South India that ruled for over 200 years.

The Vijayanagara Empire built its capital around Hampi, calling it Vijayanagara. Historians propose that Harihara I and Bukka I, the founders of the empire, were commanders in the army of the Hoysala Empire stationed in the Tungabhadra region to ward off Muslim invasions from the Northern India. Some claim that they were Telugu people, who took control of the northern parts of the Hoysala Empire during its decline. As per texts such as &quot;Vidyaranya Kalajana, Vidyaranya Vritanta, Rajakalanirnaya, Pitamahasamhita, Sivatatvaratnakara&quot;, they were treasury officers of Pratap Rudra, the King of Kakatiya Kingdom. When Muhammad Bin Tughlaq came looking for Baha-Ud-Din Gurshasp (who was taking refuge in the court of Pratap Rudra), Pratap Rudra was overthrown and Kakatiya was destroyed. During this time the two brothers Harihara I and Bukka I, with a small army came to the present site of Vijayanagara, Hampi. Vidyaranya, the 12th Jagadguru of the Śringeri Śarada Pītham took them under his protection and established them on the throne and the city was called Vidyanagara in A.D. 1336.
They expanded the infrastructure and temples. According to Nicholas Gier and other scholars, by 1500 CE Hampi-Vijayanagara was the world&#x27;s second-largest medieval-era city after Beijing, and probably India&#x27;s richest. Its wealth attracted 16th-century traders from across the Deccan area, Persia and the Portuguese colony of Goa. The Vijayanagara rulers fostered developments in intellectual pursuits and the arts, maintained a strong military and fought many wars with sultanates to its north and east. They invested in roads, waterworks, agriculture, religious buildings and public infrastructure. This included, states UNESCO, &quot;forts, riverside features, royal and sacred complexes, temples, shrines, pillared halls, mandapas (halls for people to sit), memorial structures, gateways, check posts, stables, water structures, and more&quot;. The site was multi-religious and multi-ethnic; it included Hindu and Jain monuments next to each other. The buildings predominantly followed South Indian Hindu arts and architecture dating to the Aihole-Pattadakal styles, but the Hampi builders also used elements of Indian architecture in the Lotus Mahal, the public bath and the elephant stables.

According to historical memoirs left by Portuguese and Persian traders to Hampi, the city was of metropolitan proportions; they called it &quot;one of the most beautiful cities&quot;. While prosperous and in infrastructure, the Muslim-Hindu wars between Muslim Sultanates and Vijayanagara Empire continued. In 1565, at the Battle of Talikota, a coalition of Muslim sultanates entered into a war with the Vijayanagara Empire. They captured and beheaded the king Aliya Rama Raya, followed by a massive destruction of the infrastructure fabric of Hampi and the metropolitan Vijayanagara. The city was pillaged, looted and burnt for six months after the war, then abandoned as ruins, which are now called the Group of Monuments at Hampi.

===Archaeological site===

Hampi and its nearby region remained a contested and fought-over region claimed by the local chiefs, the Hyderabad Muslim nizams, the Maratha Hindu kings, and Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan of Mysore through the 18th century. In 1799, Tipu Sultan was defeated and killed when the British forces and Wadiyar dynasty aligned. The region then came under British influence. The ruins of Hampi were surveyed in 1800 by Scottish Colonel Colin Mackenzie, first Surveyor General of India. Mackenzie wrote that the Hampi site was abandoned and only wildlife live there. The 19th-century speculative articles by historians who followed Mackenzie blamed the 18th-century armies of Hyder Ali and the Marathas for the damage to the Hampi monuments.

The Hampi site remained ignored until the mid-19th century, when &quot;Alexander Greenlaw&quot; visited and photographed the site in 1856. He created an archive of 60 calotype photographs of temples and royal structures that were standing in 1856. These photographs were held in a private collection in the United Kingdom and were not published until 1980. They are the most valuable source of the mid-19th-century state of Hampi monuments to scholars.

The monuments at this site would have had colours rather than the sandstone tint that they appear in today.

A translation of the memoirs written by Abd al-Razzaq Samarqandi, a Persian envoy in the court of Devaraya II (1424–1446), published in the early 1880s described some monuments of the abandoned site. This translation, for the first time, uses Arabic terms such as &quot;zenana&quot; to describe some of the Hampi monuments. Some of these terms became the names thereafter. Alexander Rea, an officer of the Archaeological Survey department of the Madras Presidency within British India, published his survey of the site in 1885. Robert Sewell published his scholarly treatise &quot;A Forgotten Empire&quot; in 1900, bringing Hampi to the widespread attention of scholars. The growing interest led Rea and his successor Longhurst to clear and repair the Hampi group of monuments.

The site is significant historically and archaeologically, for the Vijayanagara period and before. The Archaeological Survey of India continues to conduct excavations in the area.

==Description==

Hampi is located in hilly terrain formed by granite boulders The Hampi monuments comprising the UNESCO world heritage site are a subset of the Vijayanagara ruins. Almost all of the monuments were built between 1336 and 1570 CE during the Vijayanagara rule. The site has about 1,600 monuments and covers .

The Hampi site has been studied in three broad zones; the first has been named the &quot;sacred centre&quot; by scholars such as Burton Stein and othersl; the second is referred to as the &quot;urban core&quot; or the &quot;royal centre&quot;; and the third constitutes the rest of metropolitan Vijayanagara. The sacred centre, alongside the river, contains the oldest temples with a history of pilgrimage and monuments pre-dating the Vijayanagara empire. The urban core and royal centre have over sixty ruined temples beyond those in the sacred centre, but the temples in the urban core are all dated to the Vijayanagara empire. The urban core also includes public utility infrastructure such as roads, an aqueduct, water tanks, mandapa, gateways and markets, monasteries This distinction has been assisted by some seventy-seven stone inscriptions.

Most of the monuments are Hindu; the temples and the public infrastructure such as tanks and markets include reliefs and artwork depicting Hindu deities and themes from Hindu texts. There are also six Jain temples and monuments and a Muslim mosque and tomb. The architecture is built from the abundant local stone; the dominant style is Dravidian, with roots in the developments in Hindu arts and architecture in the second half of the 1st millennium in the Deccan region. It also included elements of the arts that developed during the Hoysala Empire rule in the south between the 11th and 14th century such as in the pillars of Ramachandra temple and ceilings of some of the Virupaksha temple complex. The architects also adopted an Indo-Islamic style in a few monuments, such as the Queen&#x27;s bath and Elephant stables, which UNESCO says reflects a &quot;highly evolved multi-religious and multi-ethnic society&quot;.

==List of attractions==
===Hindu temples and monuments===
====Virupaksha temple and market complex====
The Virupaksha temple is the oldest shrine, the principal destination for pilgrims and tourists, and remains a Hindu worship site. Parts of the Shiva, Pampa and Durga temples existed in the 11th-century; it was extended during the Vijayanagara era. The temple is a collection of smaller temples, a regularly repainted, high gopuram, a Hindu monastery dedicated to Vidyaranya of Advaita Vedanta tradition, a water tank (&quot;Manmatha&quot;), a community kitchen, other monuments and a -long ruined stone market with a monolithic Nandi shrine on the east end.

The temple faces eastwards, aligning the sanctums of the Shiva and Pampa Devi temples to the sunrise; a large gopuram marks its entrance. The superstructure is a pyramidal tower with pilastered storeys on each of which is artwork including erotic sculptures. The gopuram leads into a rectangular court that ends in another, smaller gopuram dated to 1510 CE. To its south side is a 100-column hall with Hindu-related reliefs on all four sides of each pillar. Connected to this public hall is a community kitchen, a feature found in other major Hampi temples. A channel is cut into the rock to deliver water to the kitchen and the feeding hall. The courtyard after the small gopuram has &quot;dipa-stambha&quot; (lamp pillar) and Nandi.

The courtyard after the small gopuram leads to the main mandapa of the Shiva temple, which consists of the original square mandapa and a rectangular extension composed of two fused squares and sixteen piers built by Krishnadevaraya. The ceiling of the open hall above the mandapa is painted, showing the Shaivism legend relating to Shiva-Parvati marriage; another section shows the legend of Rama-Sita of the Vaishnavism tradition. A third section depicts the legend of the love god Kama shooting an arrow at Shiva to get him interested in Parvati, and the fourth section shows the Advaita Hindu scholar Vidyaranya being carried in a procession. According to George Michell and other scholars, the details and colour hues suggest all the ceiling paintings are from a 19th-century renovation, and the themes of the original paintings are unknown. The mandapa pillars have outsized &quot;yalis&quot;, mythical animal melding the features of a horse, lion and other animals with an armed warrior riding it—a characteristic Vijayanagara feature.

The sanctum of the temple has a &quot;mukha-linga&quot;; a Shiva linga with a face embossed with brass. The Virupaksha temple also has smaller shrines for two aspects of Parvati-Pampa and Bhuvaneshwari to the north of the main sanctum. Bhuvaneshwari shrine is of Chalukyan architecture and it uses granite instead of pot stone. The compound has a northern gopura, smaller than the eastern gopura, that opens to the Manmatha tank and a pathway to the river with stone reliefs related to the &quot;Ramayana&quot;. To the west of this tank are shrines of Shaktism and Vaishnavism traditions, such as those for Durga and Vishnu respectively. Some of the shrines on this pilgrim&#x27;s path were whitewashed in the 19th century under orders of the British India officer F.W. Robinson, who sought to restore the Virupaksha temple complex; whitewashing of this cluster of historic monuments has continued as a tradition.

According to local tradition, the Virupaksha is the only temple that continued to be a gathering place of Hindus and frequented by pilgrims after the destruction of Hampi in 1565. The temple attracts large crowds; an annual fête with a chariot procession to mark the marriage of Virupaksha and Pampa is held in spring, as is the solemn festival of Maha Shivaratri. The temple has attracted criticism from tourists for its treatment of resident elephant, Lakshmi, who lives at the back of the temple in a narrow alleyway.

====Krishna temple, market, Narasimha and linga====

The Krishna temple, also called Balakrishna temple, on the other side of Hemakuta hill, is about south of Virupaksha temple. It is dated to 1515 CE; this part of the Hampi complex is called Krishnapura in inscriptions. In front of the ruined temple is a long market street, also referred to locally as the bazaar. Between the colonnaded stone shop ruins is a broad road that allowed chariots to transport goods to and from the market, and hosted ceremonial functions and festive celebrations. To the north of this road and middle of the market is a large Pushkarani—a public utility-stepped water tank with an artistic pavilion in its centre. Next to the tank is a public hall (mandapa) for people to sit.

The temple opens to the east; it has a gateway with reliefs of all ten avatars of Vishnu starting with Matsya at the bottom. Inside is the ruined temple for Krishna and small, ruined shrines for goddesses. The temple compound is layered into mandapas, including an outer and an inner enclosure. The compound has two gopuram entrances. Inside, a 25 (5x5)-bay open mandapa leads to a 9 (3x3)-bay enclosed mandapa. The original image of Balakrishna (baby Krishna) in its sanctum is now in a Chennai museum. A modern road passes in front of the eastern gopura, linking Kamalapuram to Hampi. The western gopuram has friezes of battle formation and soldiers.

South of the Krishna temple&#x27;s exterior are two adjacent shrines, one containing the largest monolithic Shiva Linga and the other with the largest monolithic Yoga-Narasimha avatar of Vishnu in Hampi. The Shiva Linga stands in water in a cubical chamber and has three eyes sketched on its top. South of this is the shrine for a -high Narasimha—the man-lion avatar of Vishnu—seated in a yoga position. The Narasimha monolith originally had goddess Lakshmi with him, but it shows signs of extensive damage and a carbon-stained floor—evidence of attempts to burn the shrine down. The statue has been cleaned and parts of the shrine have been restored.


====Achyutaraya temple and market complex====
The Achyutaraya temple, also called the Tiruvengalanatha temple, is about east of Virupaksha temple and a part of its sacred centre is close to the Tungabhadra River. It is referred to be in Achyutapura in inscriptions and is dated to 1534 CE. It is one of the four largest complexes in Hampi. The temple is unusual because it faces north. It is dedicated to Vishnu. In Vijayanagara times, the temple was approached from the river, first past a ceremonial tank then along the market street with a broad road. The temple had an outer gopuram leading into a courtyard with a 100-column hall and an inner gopuram leading to the Vishnu temple. On each side of each pillar in the 100-column hall are reliefs of avatars of Vishnu; other deities such as Shiva, Surya, Durga; scenes of daily life—rishi, amorous couples, jokers; people in yoga asanas; people in namaste poses; and Vijayanagara emblems.

The temple gateway shows the Vijayanagara dynastic emblems; a boar from Varaha, a sword, the sun and the moon. The temple and the market street are ruined but their layout suggests it was a major market with streets provided for chariot traffic.

====Vitthala temple and market complex====
The Vitthala temple and market complex is over north-east of the Virupaksha temple near the banks of the Tungabhadra River. It is an artistically sophisticated Hindu temple in Hampi, and is part of the sacred centre of Vijayanagara. It is unclear when the temple complex was built, and who built it; most scholars date it to a period of construction in the early-to-mid-16th century. Some of the books mention that its construction began during the time of Devaraya II and continued during the reign of Krishnadevaraya, Achuytaraya, and probably Sadasivaraya and it stopped due to the destruction of the city in 1565. The inscriptions include male and female names, suggesting that the complex was built by multiple sponsors. The temple was dedicated to Vitthala, a form of Krishna also called Vithoba. The temple opens to the east, has a square plan and features an entrance gopuram with two side gopurams. The main temple stands in the middle of a paved courtyard and several subsidiary shrines, all aligned to the east. The temple is a unified structure in a courtyard measuring 500 by 300 feet which is surrounded by a triple row of pillars. It is a low structure of one storey with an average height of 25 height. The temple has three distinct compartments: a &quot;garbhagriha, an ardhamandapa and a mahamandapa (or sabha mandapa).&quot;
The &quot;Vitthala&quot; temple has a &quot;Garuda shrine&quot; in the form of a stone chariot in the courtyard; it is an often-pictured symbol of Hampi. Above the chariot is a tower, which was removed during 1940s, as per historian Dr.S.Shettar. In the front of the stone chariot is a large, square, open-pillared, axial &quot;sabha mandapa&quot;, or community hall. The mandapa has four sections, two of which are aligned with the temple sanctum. The mandapa has 56 carved stone beams of different diameters, shape, length and surface finish that produces musical sounds when struck; according to local traditional belief, this hall was used for public celebrations of music and dancing. It is classified as Karakkoil, a temple fashioned after temple chariots which are taken in procession around the temple during festivals.

The mandapa links to an enclosed &quot;pradakshina patha&quot; for walking around the sanctum. Around this axial mandapa are (clockwise from east); the Garuda shrine, the Kalyana mandapa (wedding ceremonies), the 100-columned mandapa, the Amman shrine and the Utsav mandapa (festival hall). The walled enclosure covers about with colonnaded verandahs lining the compound walls. In the south-east corner is a kitchen with a roof window (clerestory).

Outside the temple compound, to its east-south-east, is a colonnaded market street almost long; all of which is now in ruins. To the north is another market and a south-facing shrine with reliefs of Ramayana scenes, Mahabharata scenes and of Vaishnava saints. The north street ended in a temple honouring the Hindu philosopher Ramanuja. The region around the Vitthala temple was called Vitthalapura. It hosted a Vaishnava matha (monastery), designed as a pilgrimage centre centred around the Alvar tradition. It was also a centre for craft production according to inscriptions found.

====Hemakuta hill monuments====
The Hemakuta hill lies between the Virupaksha temple complex to the north and the Krishna temple to the south. It is a collection of modestly sized monuments that are preserved examples of pre-Vijayanagara and early-Vijayanagara temples and construction. The site has several important inscriptions, is easily accessible and provides views of the some parts of Hampi and the fertile, agricultural valley that separates the sacred centre from the urban core with its royal centre.
The hill has more than thirty small-to-moderate-sized temples, together with water cisterns, gateways, and secular pavilions. The latest examples are dated to the early 14th century. Some of the structures are differently-sized prototypes of temples or mandapas, assembled from blocks of stones. Others are completed monuments of different designs, such as the &quot;Phamsana&quot; style. Two temple groups in this style look similar; each has a triple vimana consisting of square sanctums with each set connected to its own shared square mandapa. The towers (shikaras) on these are pyramidal granite structures consisting of eleven stacked, shrinking squares and a top in the Deccan-style square kalasha finial. Both sets are Shiva temples with triple linga; early sources misidentified these as Jain temples because of their simple exterior and interior walls.

One of these groups has a historically important inscription that records that &quot;Kampila&quot; built the monument in the early 14th century. This inscription links Hampi with the Kampili kingdom and suggests an association of the Kampili history with that of Vijayanagara Empire that followed it. The style of temples on the Hemakuta hill suggest it may have been a study centre for experimenting with different types of Hindu temples. The styles present include those of the Chalukya period, the Rashtrakuta period and later periods. It may also have been the template for the original Virupaksha temple, which was later greatly expanded with gopuram, mandala and other additions. A similar monument dedicated to Narasimha, the man-lion avatar of Vishnu, is located east of Hampi; an inscription near it states that it was operating in 1379 CE.

The Hemakuta hill also has monuments with two monolithic Ganesha; the Kadalekalu Ganesha and the Sasivekalu Ganesha. The Kadalekalu Ganesha, named after Ganesha&#x27;s &quot;gram&quot;-shaped belly, is in the middle of Hampi&#x27;s sacred centre on the east side of the hill near Matanga. A colonnaded, open mandapa leads to the sanctum, which houses a monolithic image of Ganesha more than high, which was carved &quot;in-situ&quot; from extant rock. Ganesha&#x27;s tusk and other parts have been damaged, but the left hand—which holds a rice cake treat with his trunk reaching out for it—has survived.

The Sasivekalu Ganesha, named after Ganesha&#x27;s mustard seed-shaped belly, is near the Krishna temple south-west of the Kadalekalu Ganesha. It is a -high monolith that was also carved &quot;in-situ&quot; from extant rock. The Sasivekalu Ganesha is carved with his mother Parvati, in whose lap he sits. She is only visible from the back of the statue. The monument is housed inside an open-pillared mandapa; the left hand and tusk have been damaged.

====Hazara Rama temple====

The Hazara Rama temple, referred to as the Ramachandra temple in inscriptions, occupied the western part of the urban core in the royal centre section of Hampi. This temple was dedicated to Rama of the &quot;Ramayana&quot; fame, and an avatar of Vishnu. It was the ceremonial temple for the royal family. The temple is dated to the early 15th century and is attributed to Devaraya I. The temple&#x27;s outer walls portray the Hindu Mahanavami (Dasara) and the spring Holi festival procession and celebrations in parallel bands of artwork. The lowest band shows marching elephants, above it are horses led by horsemen, then soldiers celebrated by the public, then dancers and musicians, with a top layer depicting a procession of the general public. The depiction mirrors the description of festivals and processions in surviving memoirs of Persians and Portuguese who visited the Vijayanagara capital.

The inner walls of the temple has friezes containing extensive narration of the Hindu epic &quot;Ramayana&quot;. The temple has an entrance mandapa and a yajna ceremony hall, whose ceiling is designed to ventilate fumes and smoke through the roof. Inside the main mandapa are four intricately carved pillars in the Hoysala style; these carving include depictions of Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita of Vaishnavism, Durga as Mahishasuramardini of Shaktism and Shiva-Parvati of Shaivism. Images are missing from the square sanctum. The temple has a smaller shrine with friezes depicting the legends of Vishnu avatars.

This ruined temple complex is known for its thousands of carvings and inscriptions, its elaborate frescoes depicting Hindu theosophy and its sprawling courtyard laid with gardens.

====Kodandarama temple and riverside monuments====

The Kodandarama temple complex lies near the Tungabhadra River, and is north of Achyutaraya temple. The temple overlooks Chakratirtha, where the Tungabhadra turns northwards towards the Himalayas. The river banks, considered holy, accommodate a Vijayanagara-era ghat and mandapa facilities for bathing. In front of the temple is a &quot;dipa stambha&quot; (lighting pillar) under a Pipal tree, and inside is a sanctum dedicated to Rama, Sita, Lakshmana and Hanuman. Nearby, and continuing until Kotitirtha to its north, are a number of smaller shrines, dedicated to Vitthala, Anjaneya, Shiva and other deities. On the rock face are reliefs of Anantashayana Vishnu (reclining Vishnu creating the cosmic cycle, Ranganatha), friezes narrating the legends of Narasimha and Prahlada, and the twenty-four avatars of Vishnu according to the Puranic tradition of Vaishnavism. Near the river is a rock carved with Shaivism&#x27;s 1,008 lingas.

====Pattabhirama temple complex====
The Pattabhirama temple complex is in the southern suburban centre outside the sacred centre and the urban core, about from the ASI Hampi museum. It was at the nucleus of economic and cultural activity of this suburb, now located north-east of Kamalapura. The complex, also known as Varadevi Ammana Pattana, was likely built in the early 16th century and dedicated to Rama (Vishnu avatar). The complex has a main temple, a colonnaded courtyard inside an enclosure and a 64 (8x8 square)-pillared and roofed mandapa in front of the sanctum. The complex and the sanctum face east; the normal entrance was through the eastern gopura. The ruins suggest the gopuram had six tiers. The Pattabhirama temple included a 100-pillared hall—likely a feeding hall—attached to the southern wall of the enclosed compound. The pillars have reliefs depicting Hindu themes which include gods, goddesses, a scene from a Hindu text, yoga and namaste.

====Mahanavami platform, public square complex====
The Mahanavami platform, also called the &quot;Great Platform&quot;, &quot;Audience Hall&quot;, &quot;Dasara&quot; or &quot;Mahanavami Dibba&quot; monument, is within a enclosure at one of the highest points inside the royal centre (urban core). It has ceremonial structures. It is mentioned in the memoirs of foreigners who visited Vijayanagara, some calling it the &quot;House of Victory&quot;. The largest monument in this complex has three ascending square stages leading to a large, square platform that likely had a wooden mandapa above it. This was burnt down during the destruction of Hampi.
The two lower levels of the platform is made of granite. It has reliefs—possibly a catalogue of 14th-century royal activities—and lines of marching animals including elephants, horses and camels. Reliefs on the south side show musicians and dancers, including female stick-dancers. The third level reliefs show a battle procession, couples and scenes of common citizens celebrating Holi (Vasantotsava) by throwing water at each other. Near the great platform is an audience hall, which also probably had a wooden pavilion, evidenced by 100 stone stubs; this too was burnt down.

South of the platform is an aqueduct leading water to large, symmetrical, stepped tank made of granite that was excavated by archaeologists in the 1980s. The complex has another large water pool, possibly for water sports and a garden and various mandapa. there is a ruined temple-like monument near the step tank.

====Water infrastructure====
The Square Water Pavilion, also called the Queen&#x27;s Bath, is in the south-east of the royal centre. It has a pavilion, a water basin and a method of moving fresh water to it and taking away wash water and overflows. The basin is enclosed within an ornate, pillared, vaulted bay. Nearby are ruins of the aqueduct. The modern name of this building, the Queen&#x27;s bath, is probably a misnomer because this was a public bath for men and travellers. The building&#x27;s interior arches show influence from Indo-Islamic architecture, reflecting an era in which Hindu and Muslim arts influenced each other in India.

The Vijayanagara empire built extensive water infrastructures, some examples include - the Manmatha tank near Virupaksha temple, which is dated to about the 9th century, predates the Vijayanagara. According to an inscription found there, the Manmatha tank was upgraded and a Durga shrine added in 1199 CE. The inclusion of artwork at the tank, such as a warrior fighting a lion, is dated to the 13th century, when Hoysalas frequented Hampi.
The Hampi monuments include aqueducts to carry water to tanks and other parts of the city, as well as drains and channels to remove water overflow. Excavations in the 1980s near the Mahanavami platform in the urban core revealed a large, square-stepped tank that was fed by an aqueduct. The tanks were public utilities; some were perhaps used for royal ceremonies.

Archaeological excavations in 1990 revealed twenty-three wells and cisterns in the Hampi-Vijayanagara metropolis. Of these, thirteen were found outside the city walls in the suburbs, and ten inside. Of these were twelve at roadsides, eight near temples, ten in residential areas and two were used for irrigation within the urban core. More water structures were found in Daroji valley for agriculture. According to archaeologists Kathleen Morrison and Carla Sinopoli, the Hampi water infrastructure was for the use of travellers, rituals, domestic use and irrigation.

====Fountains and community kitchen====
Several major temples in Hampi have an embedded kitchen and 100-or-more-pillared feeding halls. Hampi also had a dedicated public &quot;Bhojana shala&quot; (house of food) where numerous &quot;thali&quot; (dish) were carved in series in a rock on both sides of a water channel. One example is found near an octagonal fountain in the south of the royal centre; according to epigraphical sources, this Hampi &quot;bhojan shala&quot; was a &quot;utada kaluve&quot; or &quot;canal connected with eating&quot;.

====Elephant stables and enclosure====
In the east of the royal centre lies the Gajashala, or elephant stables, which consist of eleven square chambers aligned north–south. The openings to the stables are arched; above ten chambers are alternating fluted and plain domes. In the middle of the stables are stairs to reach the roof.

The enclosure is close to the elephant stables; it was thus named in a Persian memoir whose 19th-century translation was an early introduction to Hampi ruins for many. The enclosure contains the Lotus Mahal which is a two-storeyed pavilion in the royal centre. The Lotus Mahal combines a symmetrical, square, Hindu mandala design with lobed arches, vaults, and domes of the Indo-Islamic style. Its basement and pyramidal towers are based on Hindu temple architecture. Like almost all of the structures in Hampi&#x27;s royal centre, this monument has no inscriptions nor epigraphs mentioning it and therefore dating it and establishing its function with evidence has been difficult. The Lotus Mahal and other structures in the Hampi urban core, however, were not built with Muslim patronage, unlike the tombs in the various Muslim quarters of the city. These buildings reflect the assimilative approach of the Vijayanagara Hindu rulers. Lotus Mahal looks like a syncretic, congested space and its purpose is unclear. Speculations include it being a council hall.

====Other Hindu temples and monuments====
In the sacred centre near the southern banks of the Tungabhadra River and close to the Vitthala temple complex, are gateways and a monument now called the King&#x27;s Balance. The latter is similar to those found at the entrances of South Indian Hindu temples for the &quot;tula-purush-dāna&quot; or &quot;thulabharam&quot; ceremonies in which a person gives a gift by weight equal to, or greater than, their body weight.

The Vijayanagara rulers built forts, fortified gateways and watchtowers after their dynasty was founded from the ruins of war and for security from repeated raids and invasion. Hindu-style corbelled arches are the common gateways and watchtowers in Hampi. One such gateway is located south-east of Ganagitti Jain temple; it incorporate a central barbican wall designed to entrap and confuse a stranger aiming for a surprise, while frequent visitors knew the three changes of direction before the gateway. These functional Hindu monuments are identifiable by a legendary Hindu character incorporated into them, such as of Bhima of the Mahabharata&#x27;s Pandava fame. Another such gate is found on the north-east road to Talarighat Hindu monument and the Vitthala temple.

The Hampi site has over 1,600 surviving ruins—mostly Hindu—spread over a wide area. Other significant monuments include a temple near the octagonal bath for Saraswati, a Hindu goddess of knowledge and music; a temple in the suburbs for Ananthasayana Vishnu; an Uddana Virbhadra temple for Shiva and Vishnu; a shrine for Kali, the fierce form of Durga unusually shown holding a ball of rice and a ladle (Annapurna); an underground temple in the royal centre; a Sugriva cave temple; the Matanga hill monuments; the Purandaradasa temple dedicated to the scholar-musician famed for the Carnatic music tradition; the Chandrashekhara temple for Shiva near the Queen&#x27;s bath monument; and the Malyavanta hill dedicated to Rama-Sita-Lakshmana and Shiva. The Malyavanta hill features several shrines including the Raghunatha temple and a row of Shiva lingas carved in stone.

===Jain monuments===
Reliefs of Jain temples at Hampi include &quot;Hemkut Jain temples&quot;, Ratnantraykut, Parsvanath Charan and Ganagitti Jain temples. Most of the idols are now missing from these temples, which were built in the 14th century.

====Ganagitti temple complex====
The Ganigitti Jain temple is near Bhima&#x27;s gate in the south-east of the urban core section of Hampi. In front of it is a monolithic lamp pillar. The temple faced north; it is dated to 1385 CE, during the rule of Hindu king Harihara II, based on an inscription in the temple. It is dedicated to Tirthankara Kunthunatha and has plain walls, a pillared mandapa and a square sanctum from which the Jina&#x27;s statue is missing. There are capitals on the pillars and the doorways have decoration. Over the sanctum is a Dravidian-style, narrowing square, pyramidal tower. Other monuments in the temple compound are in ruins.

====Other Jain temples and monuments====
A cluster of Jain east of the elephant stables. One north-facing temple is dedicated to Parshvanatha Tirthankara. It was built by King Devaraya II and dates to 1426 CE, per an inscription in the temple. In front of the temple are two ruined temples; one of Shiva and the other dedicated to Mahavira. Jain Tirthankaras are also included in reliefs inside Hindu temples.

===Muslim monuments===

The Hampi site includes a Muslim quarter with Islamic tombs, two mosques and a cemetery. These are neither in the sacred centre nor in the royal centre of the Hampi site. Some Muslim monuments are a part of the urban core while others are in the suburbs where most Vijayanagara residents lived. These are in the north-east valley of the urban core, where settlements of Hindus and Jains are also found. Much of this region is deeply silted and the soil conceals abandoned temples, roads, water tanks, gateways and residential quarters.

====Ahmad Khan mosque and tomb ====
There is a Muslim monument in the south-east of the urban core on the road from Kamalapura to Anegondi, before Turuttu canal in the irrigated valley. This monument was first built in 1439 by Ahmad Khan, a Muslim officer in the army of Hindu king Devaraya II. The monuments include a mosque, an octagonal well, and a tomb. The mosque lacks a dome and is a pillared pavilion, while the tomb has a dome and arches. Other Muslim monuments and a graveyard were added later near the Ahmad Khan&#x27;s legacy.
==Reception==

In the memoirs of Niccolò de&#x27; Conti, an Italian merchant and traveller who visited Hampi about 1420, the city had an estimated circumference of and it enclosed agriculture and settlements in its fortifications. In 1442, Abdul Razzaq, who visited from Persia, described it as a city with seven layers of forts, with outer layers for agriculture, crafts and residence, the inner third to seventh layers very crowded with shops and bazaars (markets).

In 1520, Domingo Paes, a Portuguese traveller, visited Vijayanagara as a part of trade contingent from Portuguese Goa. He wrote his memoir as &quot;Chronica dos reis de Bisnaga&quot;, in which he stated Vijayanagara was &quot;as large as Rome, and very beautiful to the sight ... the best provided city in the world&quot;. According to Paes, &quot;there are many groves within it, in the gardens of the houses, many conduits of water which flow into the midst of it, and in places there are lakes ...&quot;.

Cesare Federici, an Italian merchant and traveller, visited a few decades after the 1565 defeat and collapse of the Vijayanagara Empire. According to Sinopoli, Johansen, and Morrison, Federici described it as a very different city. He wrote, &quot;the citie of Bezeneger (Hampi-Vijayanagara) is not altogether destroyed, yet the houses stand still, but emptie, and there is dwelling in them nothing, as is reported, but Tygres and other wild beasts&quot;.

The historian Will Durant, in his &quot;Our Oriental Heritage: The Story of Civilization&quot; recites the story of Vijayanagara and calls its conquest and destruction a discouraging tale. He writes, &quot;its evident moral is that civilization is a precarious thing, whose delicate complex of order and liberty, culture and peace may at any time be overthrown by war and ferocious violence.&quot;

<doc id="404343" wikidata="Q5456327" url="?curid=404343" title="Fixed-point lemma for normal functions">
<text>The fixed-point lemma for normal functions is a basic result in axiomatic set theory stating that any normal function has arbitrarily large fixed points (Levy 1979: p. 117). It was first proved by Oswald Veblen in 1908.

== Background and formal statement ==
A normal function is a class function formula_1 from the class Ord of ordinal numbers to itself such that:
* formula_1 is strictly increasing: formula_3 whenever formula_4.
* formula_1 is continuous: for every limit ordinal formula_6 (i.e. formula_6 is neither zero nor a successor), formula_8.
It can be shown that if formula_1 is normal then formula_1 commutes with suprema; for any nonempty set formula_11 of ordinals,
:formula_12.
Indeed, if formula_13 is a successor ordinal then formula_13 is an element of formula_11 and the equality follows from the increasing property of formula_1. If formula_13 is a limit ordinal then the equality follows from the continuous property of formula_1.

A fixed point of a normal function is an ordinal formula_19 such that formula_20.

The fixed point lemma states that the class of fixed points of any normal function is nonempty and in fact is unbounded: given any ordinal formula_21, there exists an ordinal formula_19 such that formula_23 and formula_20.

The continuity of the normal function implies the class of fixed points is closed (the supremum of any subset of the class of fixed points is again a fixed point). Thus the fixed point lemma is equivalent to the statement that the fixed points of a normal function form a closed and unbounded class.

== Proof ==
The first step of the proof is to verify that formula_25 for all ordinals formula_26 and that formula_1 commutes with suprema. Given these results, inductively define an increasing sequence formula_28 by setting formula_29, and formula_30 for formula_31. Let formula_32, so formula_33. Moreover, because formula_1 commutes with suprema, 
:formula_35
:formula_36
:formula_37
:formula_38
The last equality follows from the fact that the sequence formula_39 increases. formula_40

As an aside, it can be demonstrated that the formula_19 found in this way is the smallest fixed point greater than or equal to formula_21.

== Example application ==
The function &quot;f&quot; : Ord → Ord, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;α&quot;) = ω&quot;α&quot; is normal (see initial ordinal). Thus, there exists an ordinal &quot;θ&quot; such that &quot;θ&quot; = ω&quot;θ&quot;. In fact, the lemma shows that there is a closed, unbounded class of such &quot;θ&quot;.

<text>Pattadakal (Pattadakallu), also called Raktapura, is a complex of 7th and 8th century CE Hindu and Jain temples in northern Karnataka, India. Located on the west bank of the Malaprabha River in Bagalkot district, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is from Badami and about from Aihole, both of which are historically significant centres of Chalukya monuments. The monument is a protected site under Indian law and is managed by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).

UNESCO has described Pattadakal as &quot;a harmonious blend of architectural forms from northern and southern India&quot; and an illustration of &quot;eclectic art&quot; at its height. The Hindu temples are generally dedicated to Shiva, but elements of Vaishnavism and Shaktism theology and legends are also featured. The friezes in the Hindu temples display various Vedic and Puranic concepts, depict stories from the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, as well as elements of other Hindu texts, such as the &quot;Panchatantra&quot; and the &quot;Kirātārjunīya&quot;. The Jain temple is only dedicated to a single Jina. The most sophisticated temples, with complex friezes and a fusion of Northern and Southern styles, are found in the Papanatha and Virupaksha temples. The Virupaksha temple is an active house of Hindu worship.

The Malaprabha River, a tributary of the Krishna River cutting across the valley of mountains surrounded and the plains has great importance and place in this history of south India. The origin of this river is from Kanakumbi, Belagavi district, in the western ghats region flows towards the eastern side. Just before reaching Pattadakal it starts flowing from south to north. As per the Hindu tradition, a river that flows in the north direction is also called Uttarvahini Ganga.

== Location ==
The Pattadakal monuments are located in the Indian state of Karnataka, about southeast of Belgaum, northeast from Goa, from Badami, via Karnataka state highway SH14, and about from Aihole, set midst sandstone mountains and Malaprabha river valley. In total, there are over 150 Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist monuments, and archaeological discoveries, dating from the 4th to 10th century CE, in addition to pre-historic dolmens and cave paintings that are preserved at the Pattadakal-Badami-Aihole site.

Nearby airports to Pattadakal

* Sambra Belgaum Airport (IATA Code: IXG), a 3-hour drive to the west, which operates daily flights to Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai.
*Hubballi airport is also 3 hrs drive from Pattadkal. Hubballi airport is well connected to Bengaluru, Mumbai, Chennai, Kochi, Delhi

Access to the site by train is also possible via an Indian Railways service that stops at Badami on the Hubballi-Solapur line.
== History ==
Pattadakal (&quot;Stone of coronation&quot;) was considered a holy place, being where the Malaprabha river turned northwards towards the Himalayas and the Kailasha mountain (&quot;uttara-vahini&quot;). As its name implies, it was used during the Chalukya dynasty for coronation ceremonies, such as that of Vinayaditya in the 7th century CE. Other names this place was known by were Kisuvolal meaning &quot;valley of red soil&quot;, Raktapura meaning &quot;city of red&quot;, and Pattada-Kisuvolal meaning &quot;red soil valley for coronation&quot;. The site, states Archaeological Survey of India, is mentioned in texts by Srivijaya and is referred to by Ptolemy as &quot;Petirgal&quot; in his &quot;Geography&quot;.

The early rulers of the Chalukya during the 5th – 6th century were Vaishnavites (a community that believes and offers prayers to Lord Vishnu, followers of Vaishnavism) and then converted themselves into Shivaites (a community that believes and offer prayers to Lord Shiva and followers of Shivaism). Hence the temples in and around this compound are dedicated to Lord Shiva.

Pattadakal became, along with nearby Aihole and Badami, a major cultural centre and religious site for innovations in architecture and experimentation of ideas. The rule of the Gupta Empire during the 5th century brought about a period of political stability, during which Aihole became a locus of scholarship. The experimentations in architecture extended into Badami over the course of the next two centuries. This culture of learning encompassed Pattadakal in the 7th century which became a nexus where ideas from northern and southern India fused. It was during this latter period that the Chalukya empire constructed many of the temples in Aihole-Badami-Pattadakal region.

After the fall of the Chalukya Empire, the region was annexed by the Rashtrakuta kingdom, who would rule over the region into the 10th century. In the 11th century, and into the 12th century, the region came under the rule of the Late Chalukyas (Western Chalukya Empire, Chalukyas of Kalyani), an offshoot of the Early Chalukya Empire. Although the area was not a capital region, nor in proximity to one, numerous sources such as inscriptions, contemporaneous texts and the architectural style indicate that, from the 9th to 12th centuries, new Hindu, Jain and Buddhist temples and monasteries continued to be built in the Pattadakal region. Historian George Michell attributes this to the presence of a substantial population and its burgeoning wealth.

In the advent of the 14th century, Pattadakal, the Malaprabha valley, as well as much of the Deccan region, was subject to raids and plunder by the Delhi Sultanate armies that devastated the region. This period ended with the rise of the Vijayanagara Empire. It was responsible for the construction of forts for the protection of the monuments, as evidenced by inscriptions in the fort at Badami. Pattadakal was a part of the border region that witnessed wars between Vijayanagara and the Sultanates to its north. Following the collapse of Vijayanagara Empire in 1565, Pattadakal was annexed by the Sultanate of Bijapur, which was ruled by the Adil Shahi dynasty. In the late 17th century, the Mughal Empire, under Aurangzeb, gained control of Pattadakal from the Sultanate. After the collapse of the Mughal Empire, Pattadakal came under the control of the Maratha Empire. It later changed hands, yet again, when Haider Ali and Tipu Sultan wrested control of it in late 18th century but would lose it when the British defeated Tipu Sultan and annexed the region.

The monuments at Pattadakal are evidence of the existence, and the history, of interaction between the early northern and southern styles of Hindu arts. According to T. Richard Blurton, the history of temple arts in northern India is unclear as the region was repeatedly sacked by invaders from Central Asia, particularly during the Muslim incursions from the 11th century onward. The subsequent &quot;warfare has greatly reduced the quantity of surviving examples&quot;. The Pattadakal monuments completed in 7th and 8th century are among the earliest surviving examples of these early religious arts and ideas.

Prehistoric Monuments

Based on some recent findings by Archeologist and pre-historian Prof. Ravi Korisettar published works for National Institutes of Advance studies, India, the Early Chalukyan artisans were not the first to build monuments in the Malaprabha Valley. At Bachinnagudda, just a couple of kilometres west of Pattadakallu, along the road leading to Badami, is a rough-looking monument believed to date back to the Iron Age (approximately 1200 BCE – 500 BCE). This monument, called a dolmen, belongs to a class of structures called megaliths, which were erected all over southern India mostly during the Iron Age and the succeeding Early Historic period.

== Description ==
=== Site layout ===
There are ten major temples at Pattadakal, nine Hindu and one Jain, along with numerous small shrines and plinths. Eight of the major temples are clustered together, a ninth one about half a kilometer south of this cluster, and the tenth, a Jain temple, located about a kilometer to the west of the main cluster. The Hindu temples are all connected by a walkway, while the Jain temple has road access.

=== Style ===
The Pattadakal monuments reflect a fusion of two major Indian architectural styles, one from north India (Rekha-Nagara-Prasada) and the other from south India (Dravida-Vimana). Four temples were built in the Chalukya &quot;Dravida&quot; style, four in the &quot;Nagara&quot; style of Northern India, while the Papanatha temple is a fusion of the two. The nine Hindu temples are all dedicated to Shiva, and are on the banks of Malaprabha river. The oldest of these temples is Sangameshwara, which was built during the reign of Vijayaditya Satyashraya, between 697 and 733 CE. The largest of these temples in Pattadakal is the &quot;Virupaksha Temple&quot;, which was built between 740 and 745 CE.

The last temple built in the Group of Monuments is the Jain temple, known locally as the Jain Narayana temple, which was likely built in the 9th century during the reign of Krishna II of Rashtrakutas. Its style is patterned on the lines of the Kailasanatha temple at Kanchipuram.

The temple structures were built using the sandstones found abundantly locally at Pattadakkal. Some of the sculptures are carved from polished black granite.

=== Kadasiddheshwara temple ===

A relatively small temple, the Archaeological Survey of India has dated it to around the mid-7th century CE, but George Michell dates it to the early 8th century. The temple faces east and is built around a square &quot;garbha griha&quot; (sacrum sanctum). It houses a linga on a &quot;peetha&quot; (platform); there is a mantapa around the sacrum center. Much of the temple has been eroded or was damaged in the following centuries. The Shikhara (spire) is a northern Nagara style (Rekhanagara) with a &quot;sukanasa&quot; projection on the east. The &quot;sukanasa&quot; has a damaged Nataraja accompanied by Parvati.

The outer walls of the Kada Siddheshwara sanctum feature images of Ardhanarishvara (half Shiva, half Parvati) on its north, Harihara (half Shiva, half Vishnu) to its west and Lakulisha to the south. Mounted on a lintel at the sanctum entrance is Shiva and Parvati flanked by Brahma and Vishnu on either side. The steps at the sanctum entrance are flanked by the river goddesses Ganga and Yamuna, with attendants.

=== Jambulingeshwara temple ===

Another small temple, the Jambulingeshwara temple, also called the Jambulinga temple, is variously estimated by ASI and Michell to have been complete between mid 7th and early 8th century, respectively. The temple is built around a square &quot;garbha griha&quot; (sacrum sanctum), whose outer walls feature intricate &quot;devakoshtha&quot; (linteled niches with decorated frames with Hamsa and mythical makaras). Inside the frames are images of Vishnu on its north, Surya (Sun god) to its west and Lakulisha to the south. The temple also experiments with the idea of projecting &quot;sukanasa&quot; from the shikhara in front, over the mandapa. The temple still faces east, greeting the sunrise. The Nandi too is provided with a raised platform which is in ruins and the Nandi image shows signs of erosion. The dancing Shiva Nataraja with Parvati and Nandi by his side on the frontal arch sukanasa is better preserved.

The style of the temple is northern rekha-nagara with a curvilinear profile of squares diminishing as they rise towards the sky. The &quot;amalaka&quot; and &quot;kalasha&quot; of the northern style, however, are damaged and not in place. The entrance of the Jambulingeshwara mandapa is decorated with three shakhas, each with purnakumbhas below their capitals. A swan themed frieze covers the passageway with the faint remains of the carvings of swans, kutas and salas.

=== Galaganatha Temple ===

The Galaganatha temple lies to the east of the Jambulingeshwara temple. Unlike the previous two temples, ASI estimates this temple to be from the mid-8th century, whereas Michell states that it is likely from late 7th century. The temple is a northern rekha-nagara style with a linga, and a vestibule (antarala) within the temple sanctum (garbha griha). Outside the temple is a seated Nandi that faces the sanctum.

The sanctum has a covered circumambulatory path (&quot;pradakshina patha&quot;), indicating that this Hindu tradition was well established by 7th to 8th century. Various mandapas exist in this temple, such as a social or community hall (&quot;sabha mantapa&quot;), used for ceremonial functions, and a &quot;mukha mantapa&quot;, of which only the foundation remains. The entrance to the mantapa is flanked by the river goddesses Ganges and Yamuna.

The Galagatha temple is mostly in ruins, except for the southern part which contains a carved slab showing an eight-armed Shiva killing the demon Andhaka, while wearing a garland of skulls as a &quot;yajnopavita&quot; (sacred thread across the chest).

According to Michell, the Galaganatha temple is notable for being almost an exact copy of the Svarga Brahma temple of Alampur in Andhra Pradesh, a temple that is dated to 689 CE. Given both Alampur and Pattadakal were a part of the Badami Chalukya kingdom, an exchange of ideas is likely. The basement of the eastern moulding is notable for depicting friezes of &quot;Panchatantra&quot; fables, such as that of the mischievous monkey and the fable of two-headed bird.

=== Chandrashekhara Temple ===

Chandrashekhara temple is a small east facing temple without a tower. It is situated on the south side of the Galaganatha temple. This temple has been dated by Michell to the late 9th or early 10th century, whereas the ASI dates it to the mid-8th century.

The temple has a &quot;garbha griha&quot; with a Shiva linga and a closed hall; a Nandi sits on a platform to the east facing the linga. It is laid out within a space 33.33 feet in length and 17.33 in breadth, on an &quot;adhishthana&quot; (platform based on certain design rules in Hindu texts). Detailed Pilasters, yet lacking in ornamentation, decorate the exterior walls of the temple. There is a &quot;devakostha&quot; (niche) in the walls on either side of the Chandrashekhara temple sanctum. The temple lacks a lintel, but features a &quot;dvarapala&quot; (guardian) on each side of the entrance; the door frames are carved with &quot;shakhas&quot;.

=== Sangameshwara Temple ===

Sangameshwara temple, also called the Vijayeshvara temple, is a large, Dravida style east facing temple located on the south side of the Chandrashekhara temple. Inscriptions at the temple, and other evidence, date it to between 720 CE and 733 CE. The death of its patron king, Vijayaditya, in 734 CE resulted in the temple being left unfinished, although work continued intermittently in later centuries. During the Badami Chalukya reign, between 543 and 757 CE, other important Sangameshwara temples were built, such as the one at KuDavelli; in modern times, this temple was relocated to Alampur, after extensive restoration work. The inscriptions found in this and other temples mention sponsor names from different centuries, including those of Hindu queens, suggesting they actively supported the temple architecture and arts.
Although the temple is not the largest among those at Pattadakal it is nonetheless of imposing proportions. The temple has a square layout, with an east facing sanctum. The sanctum, surrounded by a covered &quot;pradakshina patha&quot; (circumambulatory path) lit by three carved windows. Inside the sanctum is a Shiva Linga. In front of the sanctum is a vestibule that is flanked on each side by smaller shrines. These shrines once contained carvings of Ganesha and Durga, but the carvings have since gone missing. Further east of the hall is a seated Nandi. Past the vestibule is a mandapa within which are sixteen massive pillars set in groups of four, which may have been added after construction of the temple was completed.

The vimana superstructure above the temple and the outer walls of the temple are well preserved. The vimana is a two tiered structure, crowned with a square &quot;kuta-sikhara&quot; and &quot;kalasha&quot;. The temple walls contain many &quot;devakostha&quot; (niches) carved with images of Vishnu and Shiva, some of which are in various stages of completion. The temple is built on a raised moulded base, with decorative friezes of elephants, yali and makara mythical creatures. Above the &quot;kapota&quot; (eaves) are detailed friezes of &quot;ganas&quot; (playful dwarfs), who are portrayed as if they are struggling to hold the weight of the temple structure. The parapet displays &quot;hara&quot; (various kinds of string in Hindu temple texts) of various styles, including &quot;karnakutas&quot; (square), and &quot;salas&quot; (oblong), which flow with the design below them and are decorated with &quot;kudus&quot;.

Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism themes are presented in the carvings at the temple. The Shaiva iconography includes a dancing Nataraja, Ardhanarishvara (half Shiva, half Parvati as essential halves of each other), Shiva with Bhringi, Shiva spearing the demon Andhaka, and the yogi, Lakulisha. The Vaishnava iconography includes avatars of Vishnu such as Varaha lifting goddess earth (Bhudevi).

Excavations into the foundations of its ruined hall, in 1969 and 1971, revealed the archaeologically significant discovery of a brick temple structure beneath the hall. This discovery led to the proposal that Sangameshwara had been built over an older temple, possibly dating to the 3rd century CE.

=== Kashi Vishwanatha Temple ===

Also known as Kashivishweswara, the Kashi Vishwanatha temple is another of the smaller temples at Pattadakal. The temple has been variously dated to the late 7th century, early 8th century or the mid-8th century.

Much like the other temples, the core of the Kashi Vishwanatha temple is the square &quot;garbha griha&quot; (sanctum), which houses a linga. To the east of the garbha griha is the moulded platform of a Nandi-mantapa, featuring the image of a seated Nandi. The temple also features a &quot;pranala&quot;, a stone structure used to drain out water used during devotional activities, and an &quot;antarala&quot;, or foyer, connecting to a &quot;mantapa&quot; with a ruined entrance porch. The river goddesses Ganga and Yamuna are still visible at the entrance to the mantapa. The temple sits on a raised platform, with five layers of mouldings, decorated with 8th-century carvings of horses, elephants, lions, peacocks, and flowery vine designs. The wall surfaces have pilaster pairs supporting chaitya-style arches. The entrance door features a Shaiva &quot;dvarapala&quot; (guardian) on each side.

Sculptures of Ardhanariswara (half-Shiva, half-Parvati) and Lakulisha are carved into the northern wall of the temple mantapa, but these have been damaged and defaced. The &quot;kapota&quot; (cornice) are decorated with motifs and carved with &quot;ganas&quot; (playful dwarfs) carrying garlands; brackets show flying couples and &quot;kirtimukhas&quot;.

The superstructure, displaying a well developed North Indian Rekha-Nagara style, is a rising five stage projection of centered squares with a complex pattern of interlocking &quot;gavakshas&quot;, but the &quot;amalaka&quot; and &quot;kalasha&quot; are now missing. The &quot;sukanasa&quot;, mounted on a spire in front of the temple, is of a dancing Uma-Maheshwara (Parvati-Shiva) set inside a chaitya-arch.

Inside the temple are pillars and pilasters intricately carved with friezes depicting the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; (Vaishnavism), the &quot;Shiva Purana&quot; (Shaivism) and the &quot;Ramayana&quot;. One frieze shows the demon Ravana lifting mount Kailasha, others show the playful pranks of Krishna, while another narrates the Kalyansundarmurti (marriage of Shiva and Parvati). One relief in particular shows Shiva coming out of the cylindrical linga. The mandapa ceiling has carvings of Shiva, Nandi and Parvati holding Kartikeya. This image is concentrically surrounded by the &quot;ashta-dikpalas&quot; (eight directional guardians).

=== Trailokeshwara Temple ===
Trillokeshwara temple is a mid-8th-century Shiva temple sponsored by queen Trailokyamahadevi. It is located south of the Kashi Vishwanatha temple, southwest of the Sangameshwara temple and in close proximity to Virupaksha. The temple was built about the same time as the Virupaksha temple, with a similar design and layout, but is somewhat smaller and has a few important differences.
The temple reflects a fully developed South Indian vimana style architecture. Its &quot;garbha griya&quot; (sanctum) has a Shiva linga, and features a circumambulatory path (&quot;pradakshina patha&quot;). In front of the sanctum is an antechamber (&quot;antarala&quot;) with small shrines for Durga as Mahishasuramardini killing the buffalo demon and another for Ganesha on each side, both currently empty. A Nandi-mantapa is included in the temple wherein Nandi faces the sanctum. Access to the sanctum is through a pillared &quot;sabha-mantapa&quot; (community hall) with entrance porches, enclosures (&quot;prakara&quot;) and a gateway (&quot;pratoli&quot;).
The temple, though similar to the Virupaksha temple, experiments with new architectural ideas that makes it distinct. The depiction of a dancing Shiva, as Nataraja, in the Mallikarjuna temple is set in the shallow arch of the &quot;sukanasa&quot;. As another example, the topmost storey of the &quot;shikara&quot; superstructure of this temple lacks &quot;hara&quot; elements (threads), while its roof is hemispherical unlike the square roof of the Virupaksha temple.

The use of stone carvings for storytelling is prevalent throughout the temple. The legends of Hindu epics and the Puranas are depicted on the temple pillars in the community hall. These stories span all major traditions within Hinduism, including Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism. The rasa lila of Krishna, whose stories are found in the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, are shown on friezes as are Hindu fables from the &quot;Panchatantra&quot;. Like other Hindu temples, the friezes of the Mallikarjuna temple show kama and mithuna scenes of amorous couples. In other places, artha scenes such as a worker walking with an elephant carrying a log and single women with different emotional expressions are carved into stone; one of these women carries an 8th-century musical instrument.

=== Virupaksha Temple ===
The Virupaksha temple, located to the immediate south of the Mallikarjuna temple, is the largest and most sophisticated of the monuments at Pattadakal. In inscriptions, it is referred to as &quot;Shri Lokeshvara Mahasila Prasada&quot;, after its sponsor Queen Lokmahadevi, and is dated to about 740 CE. It was constructed after the successful military campaigns of King Vikramaditya II against the Pallavas (4th-9th centuries CE) and the inscription mentions grant to the &quot;musicians of the temple&quot; by the Queen and also disclosing the identity of the chief architect &quot;Gunda Anivaritacharya&quot; to the architect and by giving him honour of &quot;perijereppu patta&quot; by king Vikramaditya-II. The temple is notable for its range, and quality, of construction exemplifying a well developed Dravidian architectural style, as well as the inscribed names of the artists beneath the panels they worked on.

As is common with other temples at Pattadakal, the Virupaksha temple was built facing east centred around a square &quot;garbha griha&quot; (sanctum), with a Shiva Linga, surrounded by a covered circumabulatory path (&quot;pradakshina patha&quot;). In front of the sanctum is an &quot;antarala&quot; with two small shrines within which are facing images of Ganesha and Parvati, in her Durga aspect as Mahishasuramardini killing the buffalo demon. The external Nandi pavilion is aligned on an east–west axis, as are the mantapa and antechamber. The temple site forms a rectangle consisting of fused squares bounded by walls, which are decorated with carvings. Within the compound are smaller shrines, of which there were once 32, based on the foundation footprint layout, but most have since been lost. The entrance leads to a mantapa with 18 columns (4-5-aisle-5-4, with a 4x4 set forming the inner mantapa and two leading to the &quot;darshana&quot; space).
The tower above the sanctum is a three-storey pyramidal structure, with each storey bearing motifs that reflect those in the sanctum below. However, for clarity of composition, the artisans had simplified the themes in the pilastered projections and intricate carvings. The third storey is the simplest, having only parapet &quot;kutas&quot;, a kuta roof with each face decorated with &quot;kudus&quot; – a structure common in later Dravidian architecture Hindu temples. A kalasha-like pot, found in festivals, social ceremonies and personal rituals such as weddings, crowns the temple. The top of this pot is above the temple pavement, the highest for any pre-9th century South Indian temple. The &quot;sukanasa&quot; on the tower is large, exceeding half the height of the superstructure, to aid visibility from a distance.

The sanctum walls, and also those of the nearby mantapa space, are decorated with intricately detailed carvings.
These carvings depict images of Shaivism, Vaishnavism, and Shaktism deities, and themes, such as Narasimha and Varaha (Vaishaivism), Bhairava and Nataraja (Shaivism), Harihara (half Shiva-half Vishnu), Lakulisa (Shaivism), Brahma, Durga, Saraswati, Lakshmi, and others. According to George Michell, the carvings on the walls and porch of the Virupaksha temple exterior are &quot;vehicles for diverse sculptural compositions, by far the most numerous found on any Early Chalukya monument&quot;. Other than Hindu gods and goddesses, numerous panels show depict people either as couples, in courtship and mithuna, or as individuals wearing jewellery or carrying work implements.
The temple has numerous friezes spanning a variety of topics such as, for example, two men wrestling, rishi with Vishnu, rishi with Shiva, Vishnu rescuing Gajendra elephant trapped by a crocodile in a lotus pond, scenes of hermitages, and sadhus seated in meditative yoga posture. Vedic deities such as Surya riding the chariot with Aruna, Indra on elephant and others are carved in stone. A few depict scenes from the &quot;Ramayana&quot; such as those involving Angada (Vali&#x27;s Son from Kishkindha Kingdom)sitting on a high chair made of his own magic tail and higher than the height of the ravana&#x27;s throne, golden deer, Hanuman, Sugriva, Vali, Ravana and Jatayu bird, Sita being abducted, the struggles of Rama and Lakshmana. Other friezes show scenes from the Mahabharata, Vasudeva jailed in by Kamsa and birth of Sr krishna, Krishna&#x27;s playful life story in the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; and the &quot;Harivamsa&quot; as well as fables from the &quot;Panchatantra&quot; and other Hindu texts.

The temple contains historically significant inscriptions that provide hints about the society and culture of 8th-century India. For example, one inscription mentions a grant to the &quot;musicians of the temple&quot; by the queen.

The famous Kailasha temple at Ellora Caves was modeled after this temple, although the Virupaksha temple was itself modeled after the Kailasanatha temple at Kanchipuram.

=== Papanatha temple ===

The Papanatha temple is situated apart from the main cluster of eight monuments. It is about half kilometer to the south of Virupaksha and has been dated towards the end of the Early Chalukya rule period, approximately mid-8th century. The temple is noted for its novel mixture of Dravida, and Nagara, Hindu temple styles.

The unusual layout of the temple is possibly due to its construction, which occurred in three stages, but there is a lack of epigraphical evidence to support this hypothesis. Its architectural and sculptural details do show a consistent and unified theme, indicative of a plan. The temple is longer, incorporating two interconnected mantapas, one with 16 pillars and another with 4 pillars. The decorations, parapets and some parts of the layout are Dravida in style, while the tower and pilastered niches are of the Nagara style.

Like the other temples, the Papanatha temple faces east towards the sunrise and has a Shiva linga in its &quot;garbha griya&quot; (sanctum) except there is no Nandi-mandapa. Instead, there is an image of Nandi housed in the &quot;sabha mantapa&quot; facing the sanctum. The temple walls are notable for the carved deities and themes of Shaivism and Vaishnavism; Durga is depicted in one of the niches. Intricately carved panels are displayed on the walls, depicting legends such as the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and excerpts of the &quot;Kiratarjuniya&quot;.

The centre of the ceiling is decorated with an elaborate Shiva Nataraja, while other ceiling slabs show Vishnu; one panel shows him in a reclining Anantasayana pose. Outside, in the mandapas, are images of single women and couples, in courtship and different stages of &quot;mithuna&quot;. Many panels show musicians with different types of musical instruments.

=== Jain Narayana Temple ===

The Jaina temple at Pattadakal was built during the 9th century, possibly with sponsorship from the Rashtrakuta King Krishna II or the Kalyani Chalukyas. Unlike the other nine temples, the Narayana temple lacks Hindu deities and intricate panels of the other nine, but instead has a statue of a Jina carved into the north side &quot;kapota&quot; eave.

Like the Hindu temples, this temple also features a square sanctum, a circumambulatory path, an antechamber, a mantapa and a porch. The mantapa is divided into seven bays at the north and south walls, with narrow niches containing seated Jinas. The bays are in the North Indian style, and the tower storey has a carved square shikhara.

The mantapa has a row of lathe-turned sandstone pillars. The &quot;kakshasana&quot; are decorated with the figures of dancers, purna-ghata, nidhis, vyalas but some of the artwork is only partially finished. The entrance features carvings of a life-sized elephant torso with riders. According to Adam Hardy, the niches of this Jain temple mantapa may have previously featured images.

The Archaeological Survey of India has conducted excavations at the site yielding evidence of an older temple and Jaina presence. According to the ASI, the excavations uncovered &quot;the remains of a large temple complex built in bricks and also a beautiful sculpture of Tirthankara standing in sama-bhanga indicating the existence of a temple, probably belonging to before or beginning of the early Chalukyan rule&quot;.

=== Other monuments and inscriptions ===

A number of inscriptions in the old Kannada language have been found at Pattadakal, notably in the Virupaksha, Sangameshwara and Papanatha temples. These inscriptions are an important source of information regarding the grants made by King Vikramaditya, and Vijayaditya, various queens, and others, for the construction and operation of the temple.
They have also provided valuable insight into the evolution of various written Indian scripts. As an example, one particular 8th century column is inscribed in two Sanskrit scripts, the northern Indian Siddhamatrika script and the southern Indian Kannada script.
Other notable monuments at Pattadakal include a monolithic stone pillar bearing numerous inscriptions, the Naganatha temple, the Mahakuteshwara temple, which also bears numerous inscriptions, as well as several small shrines dedicated to Shiva. Near the Virupaksha, Sangameshwara and Mallikarjuna temples is a Shaiva stone pillar, featuring a trident emblem. The pillar bears inscriptions stating it was erected by Jnana Shivacharya from Mrigathanikahara, located on the north bank of the Ganges, and that he had gifted a parcel of land to the Vijayeshwara.

In 2008, Upinder Singh wrote that S. Venkateshaiah, a senior archaeologist with the ASI had located the quarry where the stones were sourced some 5 kilometers away from the Pattadakal. The site is notable for sketches of Shiva, Nandi, Durga, Ganesh, trident, peacock, swastika, symbols and inscriptions. Some of these may be emblems of guilds (&quot;sanghata&quot;) that quarried and supplied the stones for temples.

== Significance ==
According to art historian Cathleen Cummings, the monuments at Pattadakal are a historically significant example of religion, society, and culture, particularly Hindu and Jain, in the Deccan region and is an expression of Hindu kingship and religious worldview of 8th-century India. She writes that the artisans express the conflicting concepts of Dharma (duty, virtue, righteousness) and Moksha (liberation) in Hindu theology, particularly Pashupata Shaivism. Furthermore, she states that the significance lies not just within individual images but also in their relative location and sequence as well how it expresses the historic tension in Hindu religious tradition between the stately life of the householder and the life of the renouncer monk.

The expression of Dharma, particularly &quot;raja-dharma&quot; (royal authority and duty) as exemplified by Rama, and Moksha are seen throughout the various temples at Pattadakal. The former is depicted in various friezes using examples of the life story of Rama from the Ramayana, while the latter is expressed with images of Lakulisha, Nataraja, Yoga, and numerous ascetics. Other imagery that is particularly prevalent at Pattadakal is that between Purusha and Prakriti, the soul and the matter, the masculine, and the feminine.

The temples at Pattadakal are symbolic of the Chalukya inclination towards integration, and experimentation, resulting in a merging of the Northern and Southern Indian architectural styles. This is particularly evident when the architecture at Pattadakal, Aihole and Badami are viewed together. Aihole, in the 5th century, served as the incubator for the concepts that would lead to this integration of styles. These concepts were further refined in Badami during the 6th and 7th centuries. The culmination of this is, as described by UNESCO, &quot;the apogee of an eclectic art which, in the 7th and 8th centuries, achieved a harmonious blend of architectural forms from the north and south of India&quot;.

=== Early medieval era music and arts ===
Among the sculptures at Pattadakal is one of a long neck lute (Sitar-like) dated to the 10th century. The site also shows friezes with more conventional musical instruments, but the long neck lute suggests there was a tradition of musicians innovating with new instrument designs. Another example are the 7th-century stick zithers found carved in the bas-relief at Mahabalipuram in Tamil Nadu.

<text>Anyolite is a metamorphic rock composed of intergrown green zoisite, black/dark green pargasite and ruby. It has been found in the Arusha Region of Tanzania and in Austria. It is sometimes incorrectly advertised as a variety of the mineral zoisite. The term &quot;anyolite&quot; is, however, not an officially accepted term for a metamorphic rock. 
Its name derives from the Maasai word &quot;anyoli&quot;, meaning &quot;green&quot;. Anyolite is also referred to as ruby in zoisite, ruby zoisite, ruby-zoisite or Tanganyika artstone.

The contrasting colours make anyolite a popular material for sculptures and other decorative objects. It was first discovered at the Mundarara Mine, near Longido, Tanzania in 1954.

In 2010 it was suggested that a 2 kilogram stone known as the &quot;Gem of Tanzania&quot; owned by the defunct company Wrekin Construction and fraudulently valued at £11 million was actually a lump of anyolite worth about £100, although it was eventually sold for £8000. It is reported that the stone originally came from a mine near Arusha, Tanzania.

<text>Thomas Cook (22 November 1808 – 18 July 1892) was the founder of the travel agency Thomas Cook &amp; Son. He was born into a poor family in Derbyshire and left school at the age of ten to start work as a gardener&#x27;s boy. He served an apprenticeship as a cabinet maker before becoming an itinerant Baptist preacher. He was a supporter of the temperance movement and his first foray into tourism was a railway excursion to Loughborough for members of the Leicester Temperance Society in 1841. Following the success of this excursion, Cook, by now settled with his family in Leicester, began to organise tours further afield in the British Isles and, eventually, to the United States, Egypt and the Holy Land. In 1872, he went into business with his son as &quot;Thomas Cook &amp; Son&quot;, with a head office in London. Following his retirement in 1878, he returned to Leicester and took an interest in the Baptist church and charitable work until his death. Cook is credited with having, through his all-inclusive tours, made travel and tourism accessible to a wider public.

== Early life ==
Thomas Cook was born on 22 November 1808 to Elizabeth and John Cook, who lived in a small cottage in Quick Close in the village of Melbourne, Derbyshire. His father was a labourer who died when Cook was four years old; his mother was the daughter of a New Connexion Baptist preacher. At the age of 10, Cook left school and started working as a gardener&#x27;s boy on Lord Melbourne&#x27;s estate, while continuing his education at Sunday School and later becoming a Sunday School teacher. In 1828, he left an apprenticeship as a cabinet-maker to become an itinerant Baptist preacher, distributing tracts and setting up Sunday Schools in villages in the South Midlands for an annual salary of £36. In 1829, he met Marianne Mason, a farmer&#x27;s daughter and Sunday School teacher from Barrowden in Rutland. The couple married on 3 March 1833 at  St Peter&#x27;s Church, Barrowden and set up home in Market Harborough in Leicestershire, with Cook working as a wood-tujarner. They had one surviving son, John Mason Cook, and daughter, Annie Elizabeth.

== First excursions ==

While he was living at Market Harborough, Cook became a supporter of the temperance movement. In 1836, both he and Marianne signed the pledge and Cook became active in campaigning for abstention from alcohol. Cook described how he got the idea for his first railway excursion when he was walking the 15 miles from his home to Leicester in June 1841 to attend a temperance meeting: &quot;A thought flashed through my brain – what a glorious thing it would be if the newly developed powers of railways and locomotion could be made subservient to the promotion of temperance&quot;. Cook&#x27;s plan came to fruition on 5 July 1841, when he took a party of 485 members of the Leicester Temperance Society on a rail excursion from Leicester Campbell Street Railway Station to Loughborough to attend a temperance meeting. He charged passengers one shilling each to cover the cost of hiring a train from the Midland Counties Railway. On the 150th anniversary of the excursion, a statue of Cook by James Butler was unveiled outside Leicester Railway Station.
Later in the year 1841, Cook moved to Leicester and set up as a bookseller and printer. He also ran two temperance hotels with his wife and his mother. In 1845, he organised his first profit-making excursion, taking a party to Liverpool, Caernarfon and Mount Snowdon. The following year he branched out with tours to Scotland and in 1851 he arranged for 165,000 people to travel to the Great Exhibition in London. That same year he began publishing &quot;Cook&#x27;s Excursionist&quot;, a monthly magazine which, as well as advice to travellers and advertisements for travel goods, contained testimonials from people who had been on Cook&#x27;s tours. One traveller wrote: &quot;Everything is organised, everything is catered for, one does not have to bother oneself with anything at all, neither timings, nor luggage nor hotels&quot;.

== Foreign tours ==
Having organised tours in England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland and the Isle of Man over the previous decade, Cook planned his first excursion abroad in 1855, a trip to Calais for tourists who went on to visit the Pris Exhibition. This was followed by &quot;a grand circular tour of the Continent&quot;, visiting major cities in Belgium, Germany and France. In 1862, Scottish railway companies stopped issuing cheap group tickets for tour groups and Cook turned his attention further afield, to Switzerland and Italy, the United States, Egypt and the Holy Land.

In 1865, Cook acquired business premises on Fleet Street in London. The office also contained a shop which sold essential travel accessories, including guide books, luggage, and footwear. In 1872, he formed a partnership with his son, John Mason Andrew Cook, and renamed the travel agency as &quot;Thomas Cook &amp; Son&quot;. In 1868, the company introduced &quot;hotel coupons&quot; which were issued to travellers and could be exchanged for restaurant meals and hotel accommodation. &quot;Circular notes&quot;, a form of traveller&#x27;s cheque, were introduced in 1874 and enabled tourists to obtain local currency. Cook made his first round-the-world tour in 1874, and the same year advertised an annual conducted trip for 200 guineas.

While Cook travelled the world, his son stayed at home to run the company, moving to a new London headquarters at Ludgate Circus. Cook and his son had different attitudes towards the business, with John Mason Cook being the more commercially-minded, and, after a number of quarrels, Cook retired from the partnership in 1878.

== Later life ==
Following his retirement, Cook moved back to Leicester to a house, Thorncroft, he had had built on London Road. His later years were marred by the death of his daughter in 1880 and of his wife in 1884 and by increasing loss of sight. He still managed to travel and went to the Holy Land in 1888. At home, he continued his work for the Baptist Church, the temperance movement, and other charities. He died following a stroke on 18 July 1892. He was buried in Welford cemetery in Leicester. His wealth at death was £2731 7s. 2d His son died in 1899, leaving an estate of £622,534 3s. 4d. The business of Thomas Cook &amp; Son was then run by Cook&#x27;s three grandsons. 
== Legacy ==
Cook is commemorated in the village of his childhood, Melbourne, by almshouses and a chapel he had built in 1890. A plaque reads:&quot;General Baptist Memorial Cottages and Mission Hall. Erected by Thomas Cook, a Native of Melbourne 1890&quot;. In Leicester he is commemorated by his statue outside the railway station and a blue plaque on his home, Thorncroft.

Historian of tourism Alan McNee described Cook as &quot;perhaps the nineteenth century&#x27;s greatest force for popularizing and democratizing travel&quot;, writing: 
Although the firm and its clients were often criticized by conservative commentators as a vulgarizing and destructive influence, Cook’s promotion of &#x27;excursion&#x27; travel allowed a huge number of ordinary British men and women to experience travel in a way that would have been unimaginable for their parents and grandparents. In doing so, Cook transformed the fields of tourism and leisure.

<doc id="404370" wikidata="Q731231" url="?curid=404370" title="Slim Harpo">
<text>Slim Harpo (born Isiah Moore or James Isaac Moore; February 11, 1924 – January 31, 1970) was an American blues musician, a leading exponent of the swamp blues style, and &quot;one of the most commercially successful blues artists of his day&quot;. He played guitar and was a master of the blues harmonica, known in blues circles as a &quot;harp&quot;. His most successful and influential recordings included &quot;I&#x27;m a King Bee&quot; (1957), &quot;Rainin&#x27; in My Heart&quot; (1961), and &quot;Baby Scratch My Back&quot; (1966), which reached number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s R&amp;B chart and number 16 on its broader Hot 100 singles chart.

==Life and career==
Moore was born in Lobdell, Louisiana, the eldest child in his family. After his parents died he worked as a longshoreman and construction worker in New Orleans in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Influenced in style by Jimmy Reed, he began performing in Baton Rouge bars using the name &quot;Harmonica Slim&quot;, and also accompanied his brother-in-law Lightnin&#x27; Slim in live performances.

He started his recording career in March 1957, working with the A&amp;R man and record producer J. D. &quot;Jay&quot; Miller in Crowley, Louisiana. To differentiate himself from another performer called Harmonica Slim he took his wife&#x27;s suggestion and adopted the name Slim Harpo. His first solo release, for Excello Records, based in Nashville, Tennessee, was &quot;I&#x27;m a King Bee&quot;, backed with &quot;I Got Love If You Want It&quot; in 1957. Harpo played guitar in his live shows, but he usually used other guitarists when recording. The record was a regional hit, but failed to make the national charts. He followed up with several more singles for Excello before having his first chart hit, &quot;Rainin&#x27; in My Heart&quot;, in early 1961. The record reached number 17 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s R&amp;B chart and number 34 on its Hot 100, and it was followed soon after with an album of the same name and additional singles. Many of his songs were co-written with his wife, Lovelle Moore, although she never received credit.

Never a full-time musician, Harpo owned a trucking business during the 1960s. According to writer Ryan Whirty, &quot;Harpo and his band needed to tour constantly and play as much as possible; times were frequently lean financially, and the men had to scrape up whatever they could get.&quot; But, by 1964, several of his songs had been released on albums and singles in the UK, and British rock bands began to include versions of his songs in their early repertoires. British Merseybeat/R&amp;B group The Moody Blues reportedly took their name from an instrumental track of Slim&#x27;s called &quot;Moody Blues&quot;. Critic Cub Koda wrote of his appeal: 
He had his biggest commercial success in 1966, when the predominantly instrumental &quot;Baby Scratch My Back&quot; reached number one on the R&amp;B chart and number 16 on the broader chart. Harpo described it as &quot;an attempt at rock &amp; roll for me&quot; and was again produced by Miller. However, disagreements with Miller and a change in the record company&#x27;s ownership led to two follow-ups, &quot;Tip On In&quot; and &quot;Tee-Ni-Nee-Ni-Nu&quot;, being recorded in Nashville with new producer Robert Holmes. Both made the R&amp;B charts.

He recruited Lightnin&#x27; Slim for his touring band in 1968, and toured widely in the late 1960s, mainly reaching rock audiences. With his first scheduled tour of Europe and recording sessions already planned, &quot;one of the cleanest living bluesmen of his era&quot; died suddenly of a heart attack in Baton Rouge. He was buried in Mulatto Bend Cemetery in Port Allen, Louisiana.

==Influence==
Music critic Cub Koda noted that his songs &quot;also proved to be quite adaptable for white artists on both sides of the Atlantic, including the Rolling Stones, Yardbirds, Kinks, Dave Edmunds with Love Sculpture, Van Morrison with Them, Sun rockabilly singer Warren Smith, Hank Williams, Jr., and the Fabulous Thunderbirds&quot;. The Slim Harpo Music Awards, awarded annually in Baton Rouge, are named in his honor. Proceeds from the awards benefit the &quot;Music in the Schools&quot; outreach program.

A biography, titled &quot;Slim Harpo: Blues King Bee of Baton Rouge&quot;, by UK blues scholar Martin Hawkins was published in 2006. David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine described the book as &quot;a passionate, encyclopedic triumph, bringing the enigmatic Harpo to life and tracing his remarkable mainstream ascensionfrom the rich central-Louisiana blues scene to gigs at the Fillmore Eastwith deep local research and detailed portraits of the singer&#x27;s peers, sidemen and record-business associates.&quot;

<text>The Battle of Ticonderoga was a minor confrontation at Fort Carillon (later renamed Fort Ticonderoga) on July 26 and 27, 1759, during the French and Indian War. A British military force of more than 11,000 men under the command of General Sir Jeffery Amherst moved artillery to high ground overlooking the fort, which was defended by a garrison of 400 Frenchmen under the command of Brigadier General François-Charles de Bourlamaque.

Rather than defend the fort, de Bourlamaque, operating under instructions from General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm and New France&#x27;s governor, the Marquis de Vaudreuil, withdrew his forces, and attempted to blow up the fort. The fort&#x27;s powder magazine was destroyed, but its walls were not severely damaged. The British then occupied the fort, which was afterwards known by the name Fort Ticonderoga. They embarked on a series of improvements to the area and began construction of a fleet to conduct military operations on Lake Champlain.

The French tactics were sufficient to prevent Amherst&#x27;s army from joining James Wolfe at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. However, they also tied up 3,000 of their own troops that were not able to assist in Quebec&#x27;s defense. The capture of the fort, which had previously repulsed a large British army a year earlier, contributed to what the British called the &quot;Annus Mirabilis&quot; of 1759.

==Background==
The French and Indian War, which started in 1754 over territorial disputes in what are now western Pennsylvania and upstate New York, had finally turned in the favor of the British in 1758 following a string of defeats in 1756 and 1757. The British were successful in capturing Louisbourg and Fort Frontenac in 1758. The only significant French victory in 1758 came when a large British army commanded by James Abercrombie was defeated by a smaller French force in the Battle of Carillon. During the following winter, French commanders withdrew most of the garrison from Fort Carillon (called Ticonderoga by the British) to defend Quebec City, Montreal and French-controlled forts on the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence River.

Carillon, located near the southern end of Lake Champlain, occupied a place that was strategic in importance even before Samuel de Champlain discovered it in 1609, controlling access to a key portage trail between Champlain and Lake George along the main travel route between the Hudson River valley and the Saint Lawrence River. When the war began, the area was part of the frontier between the British province of New York and the French province of Canada, and the British had stopped French advances further south in the 1755 Battle of Lake George. However, the fort was constructed in a difficult location: in order to build on rock, the French had sited it relatively far from the lake, while it was still below nearby hilltops.

===British planning===
For the 1759 campaign, British secretary of state, William Pitt, ordered General Jeffery Amherst, the victor at Louisbourg, to lead an army into Canada by sailing north on Lake Champlain, while a second force under James Wolfe, who distinguished himself while serving under Amherst at Louisbourg, was targeted at the city of Quebec via the Saint Lawrence. Instructions were sent to the governors of the Thirteen Colonies to raise up 20,000 provincial militia for these campaigns. About 8,000 provincial men were raised and sent to Albany by provinces as far south as Pennsylvania and New Jersey. New York sent 3,000 men and New Jersey sent 1,000. Massachusetts mustered 6,500 men; about 3,500 went to Albany, while the remainder were dispatched for service with Wolfe at Quebec or other service in Nova Scotia. The balance of the provincial men came from the other New England provinces and Pennsylvania. When Quaker Pennsylvania balked at sending any men, Amherst convinced them to raise men by threatening to withdraw troops from forts in the Ohio River Valley on the province&#x27;s western frontier, which were regularly subjected to threats from Indians and the French.
When Amherst learned through Sir William Johnson that the Iroquois League was prepared to support British efforts to drive the French out of their frontier forts, he decided to send an expedition to capture Fort Niagara. He sent 2,000 of the provincials west from Albany along with 3,000 regular troops under Brigadier General John Prideaux in May. He led the remainder of the provincials, consisting primarily of Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Connecticut men, north to Fort Edward, where they joined 6,000 regular troops (about 2,000 Royal Highlanders, as well as the 17th, 27th, and 53rd regiments of foot, the 1st Battalion of the 60th Foot, about 100 Royal Artillery, 700 of Rogers&#x27; Rangers, and 500 light infantry under Thomas Gage).

===French planning===
In the 1759 campaign, French war planners directed most of their war resources into the European theater of the Seven Years&#x27; War. In February, France&#x27;s war minister, Marshal Belle-Isle, notified General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm, who was responsible for the defense of Canada, that he would not receive any significant support from France, due in large part to English naval domination of the Atlantic and the risks associated with sending a large military force under those circumstances. Belle-Isle impressed on Montcalm the importance of maintaining at least a foothold in North America, as the territory would be virtually impossible to retake otherwise. Montcalm responded, &quot;Unless we have unexpected luck, or stage a diversion elsewhere within North America, Canada will fall during the coming campaign season. The English have 60,000 men, we have 11,000.&quot;
Montcalm decided to focus French manpower on defending the core territory of Canada: Montreal, the city of Quebec, and the Saint Lawrence River Valley. He placed 3,000 troops from the la Reine and Berry regiments under Brigadier General François-Charles de Bourlamaque for the defense south of Montreal, of which around 2,300 were assigned to Fort Carillon. He knew (after his own experience in the previous year&#x27;s battle there) that this force was too small to hold Carillon against a determined attack by a force with competent leaders. Instructions from Montcalm and New France&#x27;s governor, the Marquis de Vaudreuil, to de Bourlamaque were to hold Carillon as long as possible, then to destroy it, as well as the nearby Fort St. Frédéric, before retreating toward Montreal.
==British advance and French retreat==
Although General Amherst had been ordered to move his forces &quot;as early in the year, as on or about, the 7th of May, if the season shall happen to permit&quot;, Amherst&#x27;s army of 11,000 did not leave the southern shores of Lake George until July 21. There were several reasons for the late departure. One was logistical; Prideaux&#x27;s expedition to forts Oswego and Niagara also departed from Albany; another was the slow arrival of provincial militias.
When his troops landed and began advancing on the fort, Amherst was pleased to learn that the French had abandoned the outer defenses. He still proceeded with caution, occupying the old French lines from the 1758 battle on July 22, amid reports that the French were actively loading bateaux at the fort. His original plan had been to flank the fort, denying the road to Fort St. Frédéric as a means of French escape. In the absence of French resistance outside the fort, he decided instead to focus his attention on the fort itself.

For the next three days, the British entrenched and began laying siege lines to establish positions near the fort. This work was complicated by the fact there was little diggable ground near the fort, and sandbags were required to protect the siege works. During this time, the French gun batteries fired, at times quite heavily, on the British positions. On July 25, a detachment of Rogers&#x27; Rangers launched some boats onto the lake north of the fort and cut a log boom the French had placed to prevent ships from moving further north on the lake. By July 26, the British had pulled artillery to within of the fort&#x27;s walls.

Bourlamaque had withdrawn with all but 400 of his men to Fort St. Frédéric as soon as he learned that the British were approaching. The cannon fire by this small force killed five and wounded another 31 of the besieging British. Captain Louis-Philippe Le Dossu d&#x27;Hébécourt, who had been left in command of the fort, judged on the evening of July 26 that it was time to leave. His men aimed the fort&#x27;s guns at its walls, laid mines, and put down a powder trail to the overstocked powder magazine. They then lit the fuse and abandoned the fort, leaving the French flag flying. The British were notified of this action by the arrival of French deserters. General Amherst offered 100 guineas to any man willing to enter the works to find and douse the fuse; but no one was willing to take up the offer. The entire works went off late that evening with a tremendous roar. The powder magazine was destroyed, and a number of wooden structures caught fire due to flying embers, but the fort&#x27;s walls were not badly damaged. After the explosion, some of Gage&#x27;s light infantry rushed into the fort and retrieved the French flag. Fires in the fort were not entirely extinguished for two days.

==Aftermath==
The British began occupying the fort the next day. In one consequence of the French forces&#x27; hasty departure from Carillon, one of their scouting parties returned to the fort, believing it to still be in French hands; forty men were taken prisoner.

The retreating French destroyed Fort St. Frédéric on July 31, leaving the way clear for the British to begin military operations on Lake Champlain (denying the British access to Champlain had been the reason for the existence of both forts). However, the French had a small armed fleet, which would first need to be neutralized. The time needed to capture and effect some repairs to the two forts, as well as the need to build ships for use on Lake Champlain, delayed Amherst&#x27;s forces further and prevented him from joining General Wolfe at the siege of Quebec. Amherst, worried that Bourlamaque&#x27;s retreat might be leading him into a trap, spent August and September overseeing the construction of a small navy, Fort Crown Point (a new fort next to the ruins of Fort St. Frédéric), and supply roads to the area from New England.

On October 11, Amherst&#x27;s army began to sail and row north on Lake Champlain to attack Bourlamaque&#x27;s position at the Île-aux-Noix in the Richelieu River. Over the next two days, one of the French ships was captured; the French abandoned and burned the others to prevent their capture. On October 18, he received word of Quebec&#x27;s fall. As there was an &quot;appearance of winter&quot; (parts of the lake were beginning to freeze), and provincial militia enlistments were set to end on November 1, Amherst called off his attack, dismissed his militia forces, and returned the army to winter quarters.

The British definitively gained control of Canada with the surrender of Montreal in 1760. Fort Carillon, which had always been called &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; by the British (after the place where the fort is located), was held by them through the end of the French and Indian War. Following that war, it was manned by small garrisons until 1775, when it was captured by American militia early in the American Revolutionary War.

<doc id="404374" wikidata="Q1760576" url="?curid=404374" title="O scale">
<text>O scale (or O gauge) is a scale commonly used for toy trains and rail transport modelling. Introduced by German toy manufacturer Märklin around 1900, by the 1930s three-rail alternating current O gauge was the most common model railroad scale in the United States and remained so until the early 1960s. In Europe, its popularity declined before World War II due to the introduction of smaller scales.

O gauge had its heyday when model railroads were considered toys, with more emphasis placed on cost, durability, and the ability to be easily handled and operated by pre-adult hands. Detail and realism were secondary concerns, at best. It still remains a popular choice for those hobbyists who enjoy running trains more than they enjoy other aspects of modeling, but developments in recent years have addressed the concerns of scale model railroaders making O scale popular among fine-scale modellers who value the detail that can be achieved.

The size of O is larger than OO/HO layouts, and thus is a factor in making the decision to build an O gauge layout.

Collecting vintage O gauge trains is also popular and there is a market for both reproduction and vintage models.

==History==
The name for O gauge and O scale is derived from &quot;0 [zero] gauge&quot; or &quot;Gauge 0&quot; being smaller than Gauge 1 and the other then-existing standards. It was created in part because manufacturers realized their best selling trains were those built in the smaller scales.

In the United States, manufacturers such as the Ives Manufacturing Company, American Flyer, and Lionel Corporation used O gauge for their budget line, marketing either Gauge 1 or &#x27;Wide gauge&#x27; (also known as &#x27;standard gauge&#x27;) as their premium trains. One of the Lionel Corporation&#x27;s most popular trains, the 203 Armoured Locomotive, was O gauge and ran on tracks with rails spaced 1.25 inches apart. The Great Depression wiped out demand for the expensive larger trains, and by 1932, O gauge was the standard, almost by default.

Because of the emphasis on play value, the scale of pre–World War II O gauge trains varied. The Märklin specifications called for 1:43.5 scale. However, many designs were 1:48 scale or 1:64 scale. Early Marx Trains and entry-level trains, usually made of lithographed tin plate, were not scaled at all, made to whimsical proportions about the same length of an HO scale (&quot;half O&quot;) piece, but about the same width and height of an O scale piece. Yet all of these designs ran on the same track, and, depending on the manufacturer(s) of the cars, could sometimes be coupled together and run as part of the same train.

After World War II, manufacturers started paying more attention to scale, and post-war locomotives and rolling stock tended to be larger and more realistic than their earlier counterparts. This has been reflected in the change of name from O &quot;gauge&quot; to O &quot;scale&quot;: &quot;gauge&quot; describes merely the distance between the rails, while &quot;scale&quot; describes the size ratio of a model as it relates to its real-world prototype.

Since the early 1990s, O scale manufacturers have begun placing more emphasis on realism, and the scale has experienced a resurgence in popularity, with manufacturers including Lionel, MTH, Atlas, and Williams by Bachmann making O gauge model trains at 1:48 scale.

In the United Kingdom the dominant O gauge manufacturer before World War II was Meccano Ltd. who from 1920 produced a range of clockwork and electric models under the &quot;Hornby&quot; name.

==Standards==
The differences in the various O gauge and O scale standards can be confusing. O gauge model railroad tracks typically have their rails spaced apart with the United States National Model Railroad Association (NMRA) standard allowing spacings between 31.75 mm and 32.64 mm.

===Scale and gauge===
Scale refers to the size of the model relative to the actual full-sized object being represented, while gauge is the width of the model track. Most commercially produced model track is a compromise between appearance and a trouble-free running surface.

====Scale====
Scale is the ratio of a model dimension to the real life dimension. O Scale in the UK is commonly 1:43.5 or 7 mm to the foot, in continental Europe it is commonly 1:45 or 1:43.5 is also used particularly in France, and in the USA 1:48. The NMRA and the MOROP maintain detailed standards for a variety of scales to help model makers create interoperable models.

====Gauge====
&quot;Gauge&quot; refers to the distance between the inside edges of the load-bearing rails. Various sizes of track gauge exist around the world and the normal O gauge track represents the Standard gauge of . &quot;O gauge&quot; refers to tracks that are nominal according to older standards of NMRA, current standards of BRMSB and NEM. apart current standards of NMRA. When used as a narrow-gauge track, O gauge allows scales such as 1:32 representing gauge track. 1:20 representing narrow-gauge railways.

Regional model manufacturers design their O-scale rolling stock with minor regional scale differences—manufacturers support their rolling stock with track made to the same regional scales, so there is no universal width for O-gauge model track. Models could represent the real-world standard gauge track spacing of by choosing various spacings such as at 1:48 scale, at 1:45.2 scale, at 1:44.8 scale, at 7 mm:1 ft scale, and at 1:43.5 scale. Model makers choose their scale based on many considerations including the existing marketplace, aesthetic concerns and compatibility with existing models.

====Wide- or narrow-gauge track====

Some O-scale modelers choose to model prototypes at other than standard gauge and follow wide gauge (also known as broad-gauge) or narrow-gauge railroads. There is no standard for wide- or narrow-gauge model track, and modelers wishing to portray such railway track either build their own, or more commonly accept the shortcomings of appropriately wider or narrower gauge model track. , and are the more popular track widths used by indoor enthusiasts modeling narrow gauge. Differences in regional scales give different prototype gauges to these different model track widths.

For example, using specially manufactured gauge track, scaled at 7 mm to the foot (with appropriately spaced, larger sleepers, etc.) underneath:
# UK O scale rolling stock (1:43.5), it becomes a narrow-gauge track of , and is referred to as &quot;O 16.5&quot;. Modelers portray gauges between and .
# European O scale rolling stock (1:45 or 1:43.5 in France), it becomes a narrow-gauge track of , and is referred to as &quot;Oe&quot; portraying a , and prototype. Modelers portray gauges between 650 mm and 800 mm prototype.
# United States O scale rolling stock (1:48), it becomes a narrow-gauge track of , and is referred to as &quot;On 2½&quot; (or On30, as in 30 inches).

===Om gauge===


The Om gauge (O-22.5 gauge) includes the actual narrow-gauges from 850 to 1250 mm and with it the metric gauge. This applies to both 1:43.4 and 1:45 scale model trains. Metric model railroaders generally use the 0m scale with a gauge of 22.5 mm. The starting point is the NEM standards concerning 0m gauge that were created at the end of the 1950s.

===O-27 gauge===
&quot;O-27 gauge&quot; is variant whose origins are slightly unclear. Some historians attribute its creation to A. C. Gilbert Company&#x27;s American Flyer, but Ives Manufacturing Company used O-27 track in its entry-level sets at least a decade before Gilbert bought Flyer.

The modern standard for O-27, however, was formalized after 1938 by Gilbert, who scaled the locomotives and rolling stock to 1:64 scale. After World War II, this practice was continued by Louis Marx and Company, who used it throughout its product line, and Lionel, who used it for its entry-level trains. O-27 track is spaced at the same width as regular O gauge track, but is slightly shorter in height and has thinner rails than traditional O gauge track. A shim underneath the O-27 track enables the use of O and O-27 track together.

The O-27 name comes from the size of the track&#x27;s curves. A circle made of eight pieces of standard 45-degree curved O gauge track will have a diameter. A circle made of 8 pieces of 45-degree curved O-27 track is smaller, with a diameter. Full-sized O cars sometimes have difficulty negotiating the tighter curves of an O-27 layout.

Although the smaller, tin lithographed cars by American Flyer, Marx, and others predate the formal O-27 standard, they are also often called O-27, because they also operate flawlessly on O-27 track. Marx may have dedicated its entire line to O-27, but only the Lionel Corporation remains to produce O-27 track and trains. Its tubular rail is a standard of the tinplate era.

===Super-O gauge===
&quot;Super-O gauge&quot; is a variant whose origin stems from Lionel&#x27;s desire to create a more realistic looking track and improve sagging sales in the late 1950s.

===Exact scale standards===
Dissatisfaction with these standards led to a more accurate standard for wheels and track called &quot;Proto:48&quot; This duplicates to exact scale the AAR track and wheel standards. In the United Kingdom a similar ScaleSeven system exists.

The track gauge normally used for O of 32 mm or the near-approximation  inch is for Standard gauge () approximately equivalent to at 1:48 scale, at 1:45 and at 1:43.5.

Possibly because of the large size of American railroad systems, accurate scale modeling in standard gauge O gauge is rare in the United States, though narrow-gauge modeling is much more common.

Four common narrow-gauge standards exist, and the differences among &quot;On3,&quot; &quot;On2,&quot; &quot;On30,&quot; and &quot;On18&quot; are frequent sources of confusion. On3 is exact-scale 1:48 modeling of gauge prototypes, while On30 is 1:48 modeling of gauge prototypes, On2 is 1:48 modeling of gauge prototypes, and On18 is 1:48 modeling of gauge prototypes. On30 is also sometimes called On2½.

Because On30&#x27;s gauge closely matches that of HO track, On30 equipment typically runs on standard HO scale track. While many On30 modelers scratchbuild their equipment, commercial offerings in On30 are fairly common and sometimes very inexpensive, with Bachmann Industries being the most commonly found manufacturer.

Hobbyists who choose to model in any of these O gauge standards nevertheless end up building most, if not all, of their equipment either from kits or from scratch.

===Power supply===
Models that are either built to 1:43 scale, 7 mm:1 foot (1:43.5), 1:45 scale, or 1:48 scale can run on realistic-looking two-rail track using direct current (Commonly known as &quot;2-Rail O&quot;), or on a center third power rail or a center stud supply system. If modeling such a system, an external third rail or overhead supply may be employed.

While two-rail O has traditionally been more popular in Europe, and alternating current powered three-rail more popular in the United States, two-rail O is currently experiencing a resurgence in popularity in the United States, due to increased availability of ready-to-run models from several manufacturers. The recent development of Digital Command Control (DCC) power systems with built in sound have also increased the popularity of two rail O scale models.

===Die-cast metal models compatible with O scale===
Many manufacturers produce die-cast models of trucks, cars, buses, construction equipment and other vehicles in scales compatible with or similar to O scale model trains. These are available in 1:43 scale, 1:48 scale and 1:50 scale. Manufacturers include Conrad, NZG, Corgi, TWH Collectibles. Ertl, and many others. These are popular with collectors and easy to find.

==Geographical area==
===Continental Europe===
0 scale is one of the scales defined by the NEM as 1:43,5 and 1:45 scale. However, for historical reasons they use the number &quot;zero&quot; rather than the letter as the name for the scale.

A situation similar to that in Britain exists in continental Europe, although the market revolves less around kits and more around expensive hand-built metal models for the deep-pocketed collector. Additionally, Czech Republic–based Electric Train Systems started manufacturing and selling lithographed tin 1:45 scale trains in 1991, citing O gauge&#x27;s advantages over smaller sizes for non-permanent floor layouts and outdoor layouts. The Spanish company Paya produces a smaller line of tinplate trains, based on designs dating back to 1906.

In Germany a narrow-gauge train set is produced by Fleischmann, running on track, this scale is called &quot;0e&quot; ( prototype). The trains are marketed as children&#x27;s toy trains (Magic Train), but are accurately built after Austrian prototypes and increased the interest in building narrow-gauge layouts in Germany and Austria significantly. Since 2006 there are again some reasonably priced O-scale plastic models available, manufactured by DCC developer Lenz.

In the 1970s both Italian branches of Rivarossi and Lima produced large quantities of &quot;0&quot; models, mainly Italian and German trains, later on coaches and wagons from Switzerland. In the late 1970s hand made models of the Orient Express could be found in several German hobby stores, along with other highly detailed accessories. Special brands for high procession were Lemaco, Fulgurex, Euro Train, Markscheffel &amp; Lennartz, making models in small quantities.

===Former Soviet Union===
Between 1951 and 1969, a limited number of O gauge train sets were manufactured in the Soviet Union. Utilizing the same track and voltage as their U.S. counterparts, the colorful locomotives and cars resembled pre-World War II designs from U.S. manufacturers Lionel and American Flyer and the couplers were nearly identical to those of pre-war American Flyer. Some differences in U.S. and Soviet railroading were evident from comparing the Soviet sets with U.S. sets, particularly in the design of the boxcar, which looked like an American Flyer boxcar with windows added, reflecting the Soviets&#x27; use of box cars to haul livestock, as well as merchandise.

Much like their U.S. counterparts, Soviet O gauge trains were toys, rather than precision-scaled models.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, O gauge equipment is produced at a scale of 1:43.5, which is 7 mm to the foot (using the common British practice of modelling in metric prototypes originally produced using Imperial measurements). It is often called &quot;7 mm scale&quot; for this reason.

Although toy trains were historically produced to this scale, O gauge&#x27;s popularity across the whole of Europe reduced after World War II, and the standard is rarer than in the United States. Modelling in O gauge almost died out in Britain but enjoyed a resurgence in the 1990s as modellers developed a new appreciation for the level of accurate detailing possible in this scale. Some ready to run models are produced in this scale but most are available only as kits for assembly by the modeller or a professional model-builder. O gauge is considered an expensive scale to model in although the necessarily smaller scope of a larger-scaled layout mitigates this to some extent. The two dominant British manufacturers, Bassett-Lowke and Hornby, ceased production of O gauge trains in 1965 and 1969, respectively. However, ACE Trains and for a while a revived Bassett-Lowke are once again producing tinplate O gauge sets, many of them reproductions of classic Hornby and Bassett-Lowke designs, and Heljan also recently joined the market producing O gauge Diesel locomotives.

A true-to-prototype version of British 7 mm O gauge exists, called ScaleSeven (S7) which uses 33 mm gauge to represent British standard gauge in a scale of 1:43.5.

The British 1:43.5 rail scale gave birth to series of die cast cars and model commercial vehicles of the same scale which gradually grew in popularity and spread to France, the rest of Europe and North America at the same time that the rail models were becoming less popular.

7 mm scale is also popular for modelling narrow-gauge railways, a section of the hobby supported by the 7mm Narrow Gauge Association.

===United States===

In the United States, O gauge is defined as 1:48 (0.25 inches to the foot, &quot;quarter inch scale&quot; - 1/4 inch equals one foot). This is also a common dollhouse scale, giving more options for buildings, figures, and accessories. Many O gauge layouts are also accessorized with 1:43.5 scale model cars.

While 1:48 is a very convenient scale for modeling using the Imperial system (a quarter-inch equals one scale foot), the discrepancy between O gauge in the United States and O gauge in Europe is attributed to Lionel misreading the original Märklin specifications.

Although Lionel is the most enduring brand of O gauge trains, a variety of manufacturers made trains in this scale. Prior to World War I, the majority of toy trains sold in the United States were German imports made by Märklin, Bing, Fandor, and other companies. World War I brought a halt to these German imports, and protective tariffs after the war made it difficult for them to compete.

In between the two world wars, shorter-lived companies such as Dorfan, Hafner, Ives, and Joy Line competed with Lionel, Louis Marx and Company, American Flyer and Hornby. Many of these pre-war trains operated by clockwork or battery power and were made of lithographed tin. The sizes of the cars varied widely, as the standard for O gauge was largely ignored. Dorfan went out of business in 1934, while Ives was bought by Lionel, and Hafner and Joy Line were bought by Marx. Hornby withdrew from the U.S. market in 1930 after selling its U.S. factory to the A. C. Gilbert Company.

As early as 1938, the survivors Lionel, Marx, and American Flyer faced competition from Sakai, a Tokyo-based Japanese toy company who sold trains priced at the low end of the market. The product designs most closely resembled Lionel, but with Märklin-like couplers and detail parts that appeared to be copied from Ives. Seki, another Japanese company, was an entirely different and independent company.

Between 1946 and 1976, the primary U.S. manufacturers of O gauge trains were Lionel and Marx, with American Flyer switching to the more-realistic S scale and the rest of the companies out of business.

Toy maker Unique Art produced a line of inexpensive O gauge trains from 1949 to 1951, but found itself unable to compete with Marx. Marx continued to make clockwork and battery-powered trains and lithographed cars into the 1970s, along with more realistic offerings that were sometimes difficult to distinguish from Lionel.

Sakai re-entered the U.S. market after World War II, selling trains that were often nearly identical to Marx designs and sometimes undercutting Marx&#x27;s prices, from 1946 to 1969.

A company called American Model Toys brought out a line of realistic, detailed cars beginning in 1948. In 1953 it released a budget line. It ran into financial difficulty, reorganized under the name Auburn Model Trains, and ended up selling its line to Nashville, Tennessee–based Kusan, a plastics company who continued its production until 1961. The tooling was then sold to a small company run by Andrew Kriswalus in Endicott, New York, who operated as Kris Model Trains, or KMT. Kriswalus only produced the box, stock, and refrigerator cars from the Kusan dies, and on some of these cars he mounted die-cast trucks from the Kusan tooling. After Kriswalus&#x27; death, the tooling was sold to K-Line and Williams Electric Trains, who continued to use it to produce parts of their budget lines.

From O gauge&#x27;s beginnings up until the mid-1970s, the various manufacturers&#x27; trackside accessories would interoperate with one another, but the train cars themselves used couplers of differing designs, often making it difficult or impossible to use different manufacturers&#x27; cars together. The post-War consolidation did little to improve matters: Marx used three different standards, depending on the product line, and Lionel used two, so frequently the companies&#x27; own entry-level products were incompatible with their high-end products, let alone with the competition. Hobbyists who wanted differing standards to interoperate had to resort to replacing couplers.

After Marx went out of business in 1978, K-Line bought much of Marx&#x27;s tooling and entered the marketplace. K-Line&#x27;s early offerings changed little from the old Marx designs, other than a new brand name and a Lionel-compatible coupler, making K-Line&#x27;s offerings completely interoperable with Lionel.

As O gauge regained popularity in the 1990s it also started to regain manufacturers, and as of late 2003, no fewer than six companies market O gauge locomotives and/or cars, all theoretically interoperable with one another.

Lionel equipment retains a large collector following. Equipment from shorter-lived manufacturers prior to World War II is also highly sought after, while American Flyer and Marx are less so. Post-War Marx is gaining in popularity after years of being derided by serious collectors. There is little collector interest in Sakai today, possibly because of difficulty identifying the equipment and because the brand is much less widely known than its U.S. counterparts.

The biggest makers of American O scale trains today include Lionel, MTH, Atlas, and Williams by Bachmann.

==In popular culture==
This scale and gauge was used to model the Skarloey Railway locomotives and rolling stock for series 4 of &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot;. However, the construction of the engines resulted in difficulties during filming. Series 5 introduced new models of the engines and rolling stock, which were bigger than the gauge 1 standard gauge engines and stock but still ran on O gauge track. They were used up until series 12 before the move to CGI animation. The small scale models occasionally still appeared, usually when interacting with gauge 1 standard gauge engines in series 5, 7 (stock footage), 9 and 10 and &quot;Calling All Engines!&quot;.

<doc id="404381" wikidata="Q558992" url="?curid=404381" title="Edward Lansdale">
<text>Edward Geary Lansdale (February 6, 1908 – February 23, 1987) was a United States Air Force officer until retiring in 1963 as a major general before continuing his work with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Lansdale was a pioneer in clandestine operations and psychological warfare. In the early 1950s, Lansdale played a significant role in suppressing the Hukbalahap rebellion in the Philippines. In 1954, he moved to Saigon and started the Saigon Military Mission, a covert intelligence operation which was created to sow dissension in North Vietnam. Lansdale believed the United States could win guerrilla wars by studying the enemy&#x27;s psychology, an approach that won the approval of the presidential administrations of both John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.

==Early life==
Lansdale was born in Detroit, Michigan, on February 6, 1908, and later raised in Los Angeles. He was the second of four sons of Sarah Frances (née Philips; 1881–1954) and Henry Lansdale (1883–1959). Lansdale attended school in Michigan, New York, and California before attending the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) where he earned his way largely by writing for newspapers and magazines. Lansdale struggled in learning foreign languages while at UCLA and told a biographer he retained almost nothing except Spanish curse words and French phrases he had memorized in kindergarten. Lansdale&#x27;s difficulty meeting the foreign language requirement for his degree and lack of obvious career path prompted him to drop out of UCLA several credits short of graduation. He later moved on to better-paying work in advertising in Los Angeles and San Francisco.

==Career==

===Philippines===
Lansdale served with the Office of Strategic Services in World War II, ultimately being promoted to major. He extended his tour to remain in the Philippines until 1948, helping the Philippine Army rebuild its intelligence services and resolve the cases of large numbers of prisoners of war. With most of Lansdale&#x27;s prior United States Army intelligence officer experience being with US Army Air Forces units, he transferred to the US Air Force and was commissioned as a captain when it was established as an independent service in 1947. After leaving the Philippines in 1948, he served as an instructor at the Strategic Intelligence School at Lowry Air Force Base, Colorado, where he received a temporary promotion to lieutenant colonel in 1949. 

In 1950, President Elpidio Quirino personally requested that Lansdale be transferred to the Joint US Military Assistance Group, Philippines, to assist the intelligence services of the Armed Forces of the Philippines in combating the communist Hukbalahap rebellion. Lansdale was an early practitioner of psychological warfare. Adopting a tactic previously used in the Philippines by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II, Lansdale spread rumors that aswangs, blood-sucking demons in Philippine folklore, were loose in the jungle. His men then captured an enemy soldier and drained the blood from his body, leaving the corpse where it could be seen and making the Hukbalahap flee the region. Lansdale also arranged for US military support to Philippine efforts in defeating the Kamlon rebellion in Sulu.

Lansdale became friends with Ramon Magsaysay, then the secretary of national defense, and with his help Magsaysay eventually became President of the Philippines on December 30, 1953. Lansdale is said to have run Magsaysay&#x27;s campaign for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in the 1953 Philippine general election. Lansdale helped the Philippine Armed Forces develop psychological operations, civic actions, and the rehabilitation of Hukbalahap prisoners.

===Vietnam===
After the end of the left-wing Huk insurgency in the Philippines and after building support for Magsaysay&#x27;s presidency, CIA director Allen Dulles instructed Lansdale to &quot;do what you did in the Philippines [in Vietnam].&quot; Lansdale had previously been a member of General John W. O&#x27;Daniel&#x27;s mission to Indochina in 1953, acting as an advisor to French forces on special counter-guerrilla operations against the Viet Minh. From 1954 to 1957, he was stationed in Saigon as the head of the Saigon Military Mission. During this period, he was active in the training of the Vietnamese National Army (VNA), organizing the Caodaist militias under Trình Minh Thế in an attempt to bolster the VNA, a propaganda campaign encouraging Vietnam&#x27;s Catholics to move to the south as part of Operation Passage to Freedom, and spreading claims that North Vietnamese agents were making attacks in South Vietnam. 

Operation Passage to Freedom changed the religious balance in Vietnam. Before the war, the majority of Vietnamese Catholics lived in North Vietnam, but after the operation the South held the majority, 55% of which were refugees from the North. Lansdale accomplished that by dropping leaflets in the Northern hamlets stating that &quot;Christ has gone to the South&quot; and other leaflets showing maps with concentric circles emanating from Hanoi suggesting an imminent nuclear bomb strike on the Northern capital.

During his time in Vietnam, Lansdale quickly ingratiated himself with Ngo Dinh Diem, the leader of South Vietnam. Diem, typically suspicious of anyone not in his immediate family, invited Lansdale to move into the presidential palace after which they became friends. In October 1954, Lansdale foiled a coup attempt, cutting General Nguyễn Văn Hinh&#x27;s communication off from his top lieutenants by moving them to Manila. 

Lansdale mentored and trained Phạm Xuân Ẩn, a reporter for &quot;Time&quot; magazine who was actually a highly placed North Vietnamese spy. In 1961, he helped to publicize the story of Father Nguyễn Lạc Hoá, the &quot;fighting priest&quot; who had organized a crack militia, the Sea Swallows, from his village of anticommunist Chinese Catholic exiles. In 1961, Lansdale recruited John M. Deutch to his first job in government, working as one of Robert McNamara&#x27;s &quot;Whiz Kids&quot;. Deutch would go on to become the Director of Central Intelligence for the CIA. Lansdale during this time traveled to Vietnam with a young Daniel Ellsberg who would work in the U.S. Embassy there.

===Anti-Castro campaign===
From 1957 to 1963, Lansdale worked for the Department of Defense in Washington, serving as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Special Operations, Staff Member of the President&#x27;s Committee on Military Assistance, and Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations. During the early 1960s, he was chiefly involved in clandestine efforts to topple the government of Cuba, including proposals to assassinate Fidel Castro. Much of this work was under the aegis of &quot;Operation Mongoose&quot;, which was the operational name for the CIA plan to topple Castro&#x27;s government. According to Daniel Ellsberg, who was at one time Lansdale&#x27;s subordinate, Lansdale claimed that he was fired by President Kennedy&#x27;s Defense Secretary Robert McNamara after he declined Kennedy&#x27;s offer to play a role in the overthrow of the Diem regime.

==Late career and personal life==
Lansdale retired from the Air Force on November 1, 1963. Yet from 1965 to 1968, he was back in Vietnam where he worked in the United States Embassy, Saigon, with the rank of minister. The scope of his delegated authority was vague, however, and he was bureaucratically marginalized and frustrated. His 1972 memoir, &quot;In the Midst of Wars. An American&#x27;s Mission to Southeast Asia&quot;, covers his time in the Philippines and Vietnam up to December 1956.

Lansdale&#x27;s biography, &quot;The Unquiet American&quot;, was written by Cecil Currey and published in 1988; the title refers to the common, but incorrect, belief that the eponymous character in Graham Greene&#x27;s novel &quot;The Quiet American&quot; was based on Lansdale. According to Norman Sherry&#x27;s authorized biography of Greene &quot;The Life of Graham Greene&quot; (Penguin, 2004), Lansdale did not officially enter the Vietnam arena until 1954, while Greene wrote his book in 1952 after departing Vietnam. It is more likely that he was the inspiration for the character Colonel Hillandale in Eugene Burdick&#x27;s and William Lederer&#x27;s joint novel &quot;The Ugly American&quot; published in 1958. Many of Lansdale&#x27;s private papers and effects were destroyed in a fire at his McLean home in 1972. In 1981, Lansdale donated most of his remaining papers to Stanford University&#x27;s Hoover Institution.

Lansdale died of a heart ailment on February 23, 1987. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. He was twice married and had two sons from his first marriage.

<text>USS &quot;Bonefish&quot; (SS-223) was a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, the first United States Navy ship to be named for the bonefish.

She had a busy career in the Pacific against Japanese shipping after being launched and commissioned in May 1943. She was sunk in June 1945 after sinking a ship on her eighth cruise.

== Operational history ==
&quot;Bonefish&quot;″s keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut on 25 June 1942. She was launched 7 May 1943 (sponsored by Mrs. Elizabeth S. Daubin, wife of Rear Admiral Freeland A. Daubin), and commissioned on 31 May 1943, Lieutenant Commander Thomas W. Hogan in command.

The submarine conducted shakedown training out of New London, Conn., and Newport, R.I., until 23 July, when she set out for the Pacific. She transited the Panama Canal on 4 August and arrived at Brisbane, Australia, on the 30th. Following a week of training out of that port, she again got underway for more days of drills in Moreton Bay. The submarine departed there on 16 September for her first war patrol.

=== First patrol, September – October 1943 ===

After transiting Balabac Strait on 22 September, &quot;Bonefish&quot; continued on to her patrol area in the central part of the South China Sea. Three days later, the submarine attacked a convoy of eight ships, scoring three hits on a freighter before the escorts forced her to go deep to avoid a depth charge attack. &quot;Bonefish&quot; encountered another convoy on 27 September and launched four torpedoes at the lead ship, the largest of the five, and sank the 9,908 ton transport &quot;Kashima Maru&quot; and damaged the &quot;Chihaya Maru&quot;. The escort ships pursued &quot;Bonefish&quot;, but she was able to dive and elude her attackers. On 6 October, the boat approached a third convoy and scored hits on two heavily laden cargo vessels. Again forced to go deep to avoid the counterattack, she failed to evaluate the damage that her torpedoes had done to the targets. On 10 October, in her last action of the patrol, &quot;Bonefish&quot; fired a spread of four torpedoes at two ships of a convoy off Indochina, sending both the 4,212 ton cargo ship &quot;Isuzugawa&quot; and the 10,086 ton transport &quot;Teibi Maru&quot; to the bottom. On 14 October the &quot;Bonefish&quot; sank a Japanese sailing vessel in the Makassar Strait. &quot;Bonefish&quot; concluded her first war patrol back at Fremantle, Western Australia, on 21 October.

=== Second patrol, November – December 1943 ===

After refit and training, the submarine got underway on 22 November for the South China Sea and her second war patrol. She entered the Flores Sea on 28 November and, the next day, intercepted two enemy ships. &quot;Bonefish&quot; made a submerged approach and launched four torpedoes. Two of the four — one hit amidships and another struck the freighter under her mainmast — sent the 4,646 ton cargo ship &quot;Suez Maru&quot; down rapidly by the stern. The escort increased speed and headed for &quot;Bonefish&quot;, but the sub went deep and escaped the barrage of depth charges. Unknown to &quot;Bonefish&quot;, &quot;Suez Maru&quot; was carrying 414 British and 133 Dutch POWs. Minesweeper &quot;W.12&quot; picked up the Japanese survivors although recently released documents state that W.12 machine-gunned the surviving POWs (a minimum of 250) in the water,

On 1 December, the boat sighted a convoy of three ships with two escorts hugging the Celebes coast. In two separate attacks, the submarine scored a hit on a large passenger/cargo ship &quot;Nichiryo Maru&quot; which later sank and another on a destroyer escort which apparently survived.

&quot;Bonefish&quot; conducted a submerged patrol of Sandakan Harbor, Borneo, from 4 – 6 December and then sailed for Tarakan. On 11 December, she surfaced to engage small cargo vessel &quot;Toyohime Maru &quot; with gunfire, scoring several hits before a mechanical problem put her gun out of action. The next day, the boat made a submerged approach on an unidentified Japanese vessel and fired six torpedoes, scoring one hit; &quot;Bonefish&quot; never learned the fate of her target. She cleared the area and arrived at Fremantle on 19 December.

=== Third patrol, January – March 1944 ===

Following refit and training, the submarine sailed from Fremantle on 12 January 1944 to conduct her third war patrol. While operating in the vicinity of Makassar Strait on 22 January, &quot;Bonefish&quot; encountered a large sailing vessel. The stranger&#x27;s crew of seven acted suspiciously as the submarine approached, and despite repeated orders to do so, the crew refused to abandon ship. When &quot;Bonefish&quot; opened fire with her machine guns, the natives leaped overboard. As the vessel began to sink, Japanese troops emerged from below decks; &quot;Bonefish&quot; counted 39 men going over the side.

On 6 February, the submarine sighted a convoy composed of at least 17 ships. As she maneuvered into attack position, &quot;Bonefish&quot; selected a large oiler as her primary target and launched four bow &quot;fish&quot; at it. She fired the other two bow tubes at a cargo ship and then tried to swing her stern into position to fire her after tubes. With escorts charging her, the boat suddenly lost depth control and ducked her periscope below the water. Nine tons of water rushed into her forward torpedo room before the proper valves were secured. &quot;Bonefish&quot; managed to evade the escorts, and her crew heard explosions which they interpreted as at least two hits on the oiler and one on the cargo ship. Nevertheless, it seems that neither target sank.

The submarine next trained her torpedo tubes on a convoy of 13 ships which she contacted on 9 February in Camranh Bay. Although detected by a Japanese destroyer, &quot;Bonefish&quot; succeeded in firing five torpedoes at the ex-whale-factory tanker &quot;Tonan Maru No. 2&quot; before making an emergency dive in shallow water. The submarine escaped damage from both the destroyer&#x27;s depth charges and from aerial bombs which enemy aircraft dropped, but they prevented her from observing the results of her attack. (The &quot;Tonan Maru&quot; was hit but quickly repaired.) Following this action, she continued to seek targets for more than a month before returning to Fremantle on 15 March.

=== Fourth patrol, April – May 1944 ===

Underway again on 13 April, &quot;Bonefish&quot; headed for the Celebes Sea and her fourth war patrol. On 26 April, she intercepted a convoy of four ships steaming along the Mindanao coast. The submarine maneuvered into a position suitable to attack &quot;Tokiwa Maru&quot;, launched four torpedoes, and then turned to evade the escorts. Two torpedoes struck the 806 ton passenger/cargo ship amidships and aft, sinking her. The next day, &quot;Bonefish&quot; fired a spread of four torpedoes at a cargo ship headed for Davao Gulf but, in spite of three hits, failed to sink the target.

While in the Sulu Sea on 3 May, &quot;Bonefish&quot; approached a convoy but was forced to dive when an enemy plane dropped two depth bombs which exploded close aboard. The boat sustained minor damage and surfaced to make repairs, but two Japanese ships began to close in on her. &quot;Bonefish&quot; went deep once again and rigged for the depth charges, 25 in all. When her pursuers left the area, so did &quot;Bonefish&quot;. She moved to the northern approach to Basilan Strait. She attacked a convoy in those waters on 7 May, firing four torpedoes at an escort vessel, but could not observe the results.

On 14 May, &quot;Bonefish&quot; approached a convoy of three tankers and three escorting destroyers, steaming off Tawitawi in the Philippines and headed for Sibutu Passage. The submarine fired five torpedoes. One hit under the bridge of a tanker and another struck under the stack, enveloping the ship in smoke and flames. The destroyers converged on &quot;Bonefish&quot; for counterattack, but she escaped into the depths. Postwar records show that, while her torpedoes only damaged the tanker, they sank one of the escorting destroyers, &quot;Inazuma&quot;, which was known for having rescued 376 survivors from and 151 from during the Second Battle of the Java Sea.

&quot;Bonefish&quot; then set course for Sibutu Passage on a reconnaissance mission. She sighted a Japanese task force consisting of three battleships, one aircraft carrier, three heavy cruisers, and one light cruiser, screened by eight destroyers. The submarine relayed the information, then continued her reconnaissance. She again sighted and reported the same task force on the 17th, this time anchored in Tawitawi Bay. Upon completing this mission, she headed for Australia and arrived at Fremantle on 30 May.

=== Fifth patrol, June – August 1944 ===

Under the command of Lt. Cmdr. Lawrence L. Edge, the submarine began her fifth war patrol on 25 June and headed again for the Celebes Sea. On 6 July, she surfaced to destroy a wooden-hulled schooner by gunfire. She then cleared the area and, the next day, engaged and destroyed another small ship with gunfire. Later that same day, the boat fired eight torpedoes at a small cargo ship, scoring several hits. On 8 July, she used her guns to touch off a blazing fire in a small, inter-island steamer and, two days later, sank a sampan with gunfire.

On 29 July, &quot;Bonefish&quot; commenced tracking a large, but empty, tanker with escorts and, early the next morning, gained a favorable attack position. She fired six torpedoes and scored four hits. The target, &quot;Kokuyo Maru&quot;, immediately settled by the stern, and &quot;Bonefish&quot; headed for the traffic lanes north of Sibutu and Tawitawi. On 3 August, she damaged a tanker with one torpedo hit. She set course for Fremantle the next day, ending her patrol there on 13 August.

=== Sixth patrol, September – October 1944 ===

With her crew refreshed and her provisions and ammunition replenished, &quot;Bonefish&quot; got underway on 5 September for the Sibuyan Sea. After three days there without encountering any enemy ships, she departed those waters on 24 September. Four days later, while patrolling off Mindoro, the submarine sighted a large, heavily laden tanker escorted by two destroyers. She fired all of her bow torpedoes and heard and felt the hits on the 2,068 ton Japanese ship &quot;Anjo Maru&quot;. &quot;Bonefish&quot; tracked the target whose rapidly falling speed indicated her distress until the crippled tanker&#x27;s escorts forced the boat to retire. A postwar examination of Japanese records confirmed that &quot;Anio Maru&quot; sank later that day.

During the later part of this patrol, &quot;Bonefish&quot; joined and in forming a coordinated attack group. Patrolling in the vicinity of Cape Bolinao on 10 October, the boats attacked a convoy of cargo ships, and &quot;Bonefish&quot; scored three hits for undetermined damage. Four days later, while en route to a lifeguard station, she sank cargo ship &quot;Fushimi Maru&quot;. On 18 October, the submarine rescued two naval aviators. She departed her lifeguard station the next day, stopped at Saipan for fuel on the 27th, and continued on to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 8 November.

From Hawaii, &quot;Bonefish&quot; continued on to San Francisco, California, where she underwent overhaul at the Bethlehem Steel Submarine Repair Basin from 18 November 1944 to 13 February 1945. Then, after refresher training off Monterey, Calif., she returned to Pearl Harbor where she conducted exercises until 20 March.

=== Seventh patrol, March – May 1945 ===

&quot;Bonefish&quot; then set sail via Guam for the East China Sea and her seventh war patrol. Despite thorough coverage of the waters assigned her, she made few contacts and each of these was a small antisubmarine vessel. On Friday, 13 April, she attempted to sink a patrol vessel, but the target&#x27;s radical maneuvers enabled it to escape. While on lifeguard duty off Korea&#x27;s southern coast on 16 April, &quot;Bonefish&quot; rescued two Japanese aviators who had been shot down by a Navy plane. The USS Bonefish then completed a &quot;special mission&quot;. On 7 May, the submarine returned to Apra Harbor, Guam, ending another successful war patrol.

=== Eighth patrol, May – June 1945 ===

Upon completion of refit on 28 May, &quot;Bonefish&quot; got underway in company with and , as part of &quot;Pierce&#x27;s Pole Cats&quot;, commanded by &quot;Tunny&quot;″s skipper, Commander George E. Pierce. Equipped with a new mine-detecting device, the submarines were ordered to penetrate the Sea of Japan to sever the last of the Japanese overseas supply lines. &quot;Bonefish&quot; successfully threaded her way through the minefields by Tsushima Island as she transited the Korea Strait to enter the Sea of Japan for an offensive patrol off the west central coast of Honshū.

During a rendezvous with &quot;Tunny&quot; on 16 June, &quot;Bonefish&quot; reported sinking &quot;Oshikayama Maru&quot;, a 6,892 ton cargo ship. In a second rendezvous two days later, she requested and received permission to conduct a daylight submerged patrol of Toyama Bay, a bay farther up the Honshū coast. The attack group was to depart the Sea of Japan via La Perouse Strait on the night of 24 June. &quot;Bonefish&quot; did not make the scheduled pre-transit rendezvous. Still, &quot;Tunny&quot; waited in vain off Hokkaidō for three days. On 30 July, &quot;Bonefish&quot; was presumed lost.

Japanese records reveal that the 5,488 ton cargo ship &quot;Konzan Maru&quot; was torpedoed and sunk in Toyama Wan on 18 June and that an ensuing severe counterattack by Japanese escorts, the &quot;Okinawa&quot;, &quot;CD-63&quot;, &quot;CD-75&quot;, &quot;CD-158&quot; and &quot;CD-207&quot;, brought debris and a major oil slick to the water&#x27;s surface. There can be little doubt that &quot;Bonefish&quot; was sunk in this action. She was the second to last United States Submarine lost in the war, with being lost in August 1945.

<text>USS &quot;Bonefish&quot; (SS-582) was a submarine of the United States Navy, and was the second U.S. Navy submarine to be named for the bonefish.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Bonefish&quot; was awarded on 29 June 1956 to the New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden, New Jersey, and her keel was laid down on 3 June 1957. She was launched on 22 November 1958, sponsored by Mrs. Lawrence L. Edge, widow of Commander Lawrence Edge, who was lost with his ship, the first , in 1945. She was commissioned on 9 July 1959 with Lieutenant Commander Elmer H. Kiehl in command.

==Service history==
&quot;Bonefish&quot; conducted trials and training off the New England coast until the spring of 1960. On 1 April 1960, she departed New London, Conn., to join the Pacific Fleet. On 23 May, the submarine reported for duty with Submarine Division 33 (SubDiv 33) at Naval Station San Diego, California. She operated out of that port until 16 September, when she embarked upon her first deployment to the western Pacific.

While in the Far East, the warship participated in various 7th Fleet exercises and visited ports in Japan, the Philippines, the Marianas, and at Hong Kong. &quot;Bonefish&quot; concluded her first tour of duty with the 7th Fleet on 13 March 1961 when she arrived back in San Diego. The submarine conducted normal operations out of San Diego until 4 October, when she entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for her first regular overhaul. She completed repairs on 6 March 1962, and resumed operations along the west coast at that time.

In May, the submarine again headed for the western Pacific for a deployment quite similar to her first cruise in Oriental waters. She returned to San Diego in December and began an extended upkeep period. In February 1963, &quot;Bonefish&quot; moved to a new home port, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. During the summer of 1963, she made a two-month cruise to the western Pacific, returning to Pearl Harbor in August. After four months of operations in the Hawaiian Islands, the submarine headed for the Far East again in January 1964. That tour of duty ended with her return to Oahu in July. Following a post-deployment standdown and local operations, she entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for a regular overhaul.

Repairs occupied her time during the remainder of 1964, and local operations in the Hawaiian operating area took up the entire year of 1965. In April 1966, &quot;Bonefish&quot; deployed to the western Pacific for the fourth time. In addition to taking part in 7th Fleet training exercises, she also operated in the Gulf of Tonkin. The seven-month Far Eastern assignment ended in November when she reentered Pearl Harbor.

&quot;Bonefish&quot; resumed normal operations after the post-deployment rest and upkeep period. That employment lasted until October 1967, when she headed back to the Orient. There, she engaged in 7th Fleet training evolutions and made port visits at Hong Kong, in the Philippines, and in Japan. April 1968 saw her back at Oabu resuming local operations. In September, the submarine entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for her regular overhaul.

Repairs occupied her until June 1969, and post-overhaul trials and refresher training followed. In November, the warship voyaged back to the western Pacific, and the normal round of exercises and port visits ensued. She concluded that cruise at Pearl Harbor in June 1970. Following seven months of operations out of Pearl Harbor, &quot;Bonefish&quot; departed that port on 9 February 1971 on her way back to the Far East.

Her activities included the usual port visits and exercises as well as a tour of duty with Task Force 77 (TF 77) in the Gulf of Tonkin. She returned to Hawaii on 10 August and, after post deployment standdown, resumed operations in the Hawaii operating area. For exceptional performance during the 1969–1970 WestPac, &quot;Bonefish&quot; was awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation for readiness.

That deployment lasted until 7 February 1972 when she began another regular overhaul at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. That repair period lasted through the year, and a material casualty to the snorkel piping system during sea trials in March 1973 extended it into July 1973. In July, the submarine went to sea for refresher training. Thereafter, local operations occupied her for the next 10 months. On 24 May 1974, she stood out of Pearl Harbor for yet another assignment with the 7th Fleet in Far Eastern waters. &quot;Bonefish&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor from that routine deployment on 7 November and began 13 months of local operations.

On 6 December 1975, the submarine departed Oahu bound for the Orient. During that tour of duty, she participated in exercises with units of the Korean and Taiwanese navies as well as with elements of the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force. She concluded 7th Fleet assignments on 25 April 1976 when she stood out of Subic Bay on her way home. The warship arrived back in Pearl Harbor on 15 May. After a four-week standdown and a brief period of operations, &quot;Bonefish&quot; entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard on 26 July. The repairs and modifications took nearly a year to complete. She emerged from the shipyard on 25 June 1977 to begin post-overhaul refresher training.

&quot;Bonefish&quot; conducted training out of Pearl Harbor until early November. On the 8th, she put to sea for San Diego, her new home port, and reached her destination on 18 November. She remained in port for three weeks to allow crewmen to settle into the new home port. On 6 December 1977, the submarine began operations along the California coast. She spent the first 20 weeks of 1978 conducting various training exercises out of San Diego.

On 17 May 1978, &quot;Bonefish&quot; put to sea for the western Pacific. Once again, she made the usual port visits and conducted exercises with units of friendly navies. The warship ended the deployment with her arrival back at San Diego on 28 October. She then conducted type training and other exercises along the California coast for the remainder of the year and into 1979.

During the first five months of 1979, &quot;Bonefish&quot; underwent a regular overhaul at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. On 1 June, the submarine embarked upon a deployment to South America. The voyage took her through the Panama Canal to the Caribbean Sea. She visited Trinidad, Tobago, Curaçao, Colombia, Venezuela, and the Netherlands Antilles before retransiting the canal. Thereafter, &quot;Bonefish&quot; stopped in Ecuador, Peru, and Chile. Throughout the cruise, the warship conducted UNITAS exercises with the armed forces of the countries visited. At the end of the South American deployment, she resumed normal operations out of San Diego, and that employment occupied her time for the remainder of 1979 and during 11 of the 12 months of 1980.

On 8 December 1980, &quot;Bonefish&quot; stood out of San Diego on her way to duty with the 7th Fleet. The usual calls to Far Eastern ports punctuated her periods at sea engaged in training missions. The submarine ended that cruise at San Diego on 14 July 1981. Following the normal post-deployment leave and upkeep period, she resumed operations along the west coast of North America.

That employment continued until 8 June 1982, when &quot;Bonefish&quot; departed San Diego on her way to the east coast. She transited the Panama Canal on 23 June and arrived in Naval Station Charleston, South Carolina, her new home port, on 6 July. On 11 August the submarine put to sea to participate in NATO exercises in the North Atlantic. At the end of those operations, she visited Hamburg, West Germany, and Portsmouth, England, before returning to Charleston on 9 October.

Normal operations out of Charleston occupied &quot;Bonefish&quot; for the remainder of 1982 and during the first three weeks of 1983. On 25 January, the submarine commenced a 14-month overhaul at the Charleston Naval Shipyard. She resumed active service in the western Atlantic and West Indian operating areas on 5 April 1984 and remained so engaged through the end of the year.

===Fire===
On 24 April 1988 &quot;Bonefish&quot; was submerged, during an exercise with guided-missile frigate , about off the Atlantic coast of Florida, when seawater began leaking onto cables and electric buses in a battery-supply cableway. Arcing then caused an explosion, which flashed into a fire within minutes. The temperature in the battery space reached 1,200°F (650°C). The heat was so intense that it melted the soles of the shoes of the crewmembers in the space above.

&quot;Bonefish&quot; surfaced, and the captain ordered the crew to abandon ship. The crews of a whaleboat from &quot;Carr&quot; and helicopters from both &quot;Carr&quot; and the aircraft carrier rescued 89 men. Anti-Submarine Warfare Operator (AW) Petty Officer Third Class Larry B. Grossman, an Aviation Rescue Swimmer (AIRR) and Navy Diver from Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Seven (HS-7), with total disregard for his own safety, jumped from an H-3 helicopter into the ocean and spent more than three hours rescuing stricken sailors. 

The first survivor, in a panic, knocked off Grossman&#x27;s mask and Grossman gave up his own life preserver to calm the sailor down. Petty Officer Grossman swam thousands of yards, without a mask or his own life preserver, and continued to rescue submariners in the choppy waters. Grossman&#x27;s eyes were nearly swollen shut from the fuel and saltwater. He received minor chemical burns on his body from the diesel fuel spilled in the ocean and remained overnight in the medical ward on the aircraft carrier for his injuries. He received credit for having saved 19 lives.

Grossman received the Navy and Marine Corps Medal from the President for his extraordinary heroism. The Navy and Marine Corps Medal is the highest noncombat decoration awarded for heroism within the US Department of the Navy, ranking immediately above the Bronze Star Medal in the Awards and decorations of the United States Armed Forces order of precedence for the awards and decorations of the US armed forces.

Three crewmembers – Lieutenant Ray Everts, Radioman First Class (RM1) (SS) Bob Bordelon, and Yeoman Third Class (YN3) (SS) Marshal Lindgren – died due to the fire. The frigate USS &quot;McCloy&quot;, serving as headquarters of the rescue operation, pulled alongside &quot;Bonefish&quot; to remove the bodies. Afterward , a salvage-and-rescue ship, towed &quot;Bonefish&quot; to Charleston, South Carolina.

Naval authorities deemed the damage to &quot;Bonefish&quot; to be too extensive to warrant repair and thus decided to decommission and scrap her.

===Decommissioning===
The Navy decommissioned &quot;Bonefish&quot; on 28 September 1988, struck her from the Naval Vessel Registry on 28 February 1989, and disposed of her by scrapping on 17 August 1989. Northrop Grumman later bought the hull for marine-concept testing.

===USSVI===
The Bonefish Base of the local United States Submarine Veterans Inc. is named after the USS Bonefish and holds monthly meetings in Riverside CA.

<doc id="404387" wikidata="Q2529534" url="?curid=404387" title="Thulite">
<text>Thulite (sometimes called rosaline) is a translucent, crystalline or massive pink manganese-bearing variety of the mineral zoisite. Manganese substitutes for calcium in the structure with up to two percent Mn2+. Thulite is often mottled with white calcite and occurs as veins and fracture fillings transecting many types of rock. In mineralogical literature, thulite may sometimes refer to any pink zoisite. &quot;Clinothulite&quot; is the manganese bearing variety of monoclinic clinozoisite.

Thulite was first discovered at a place called Sauland in Telemark county, Norway in 1820. It is named after the mythical island of Thule in the belief that the island is Scandinavia. Thulite is used as a gemstone and carving material in the manufacture of jewelry and ornamental objects.

Thulite is also found in the Austrian Tyrol and in Mitchell County, North Carolina. A new, more recent find of a small quantity of thulite was discovered near Riverside in Okanogan County, Washington, US and in Snillfjord Municipality in Trøndelag county, Norway during tunnel constructions in December 2018. Thulite is also found in New Zealand in the Otago region of the South Island. 

Thulite is also found in Namibia. The occurrence is spread throughout the Namib Desert and generally has ridges with a NE to SW setting. The color can be highly variable with most deposits being greenish in nature, but on occasion the desirable pink color is to be found.

<text>Augustin Pyramus (or Pyrame) de Candolle (, , ; 4 February 17789 September 1841) was a Swiss botanist. René Louiche Desfontaines launched de Candolle&#x27;s botanical career by recommending him at a herbarium. Within a couple of years de Candolle had established a new genus, and he went on to document hundreds of plant families and create a new natural plant classification system. Although de Candolle&#x27;s main focus was botany, he also contributed to related fields such as phytogeography, agronomy, paleontology, medical botany, and economic botany.

De Candolle originated the idea of &quot;Nature&#x27;s war&quot;, which influenced Charles Darwin and the principle of natural selection. De Candolle recognized that multiple species may develop similar characteristics that did not appear in a common evolutionary ancestor; a phenomenon now known as convergent evolution. During his work with plants, de Candolle noticed that plant leaf movements follow a near-24-hour cycle in constant light, suggesting that an internal biological clock exists. Though many scientists doubted de Candolle&#x27;s findings, experiments over a century later demonstrated that &quot;the internal biological clock&quot; indeed exists.

De Candolle&#x27;s descendants continued his work on plant classification; son Alphonse and grandson Casimir de Candolle contributed to the &quot;Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis&quot;, a catalog of plants begun by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle.

==Early life==

Augustin Pyramus de Candolle was born on 4 February 1778 in Geneva, Republic of Geneva, to Augustin de Candolle, a former official, and his wife, Louise Eléonore Brière. His family descended from one of the ancient families of Provence in France, but relocated to Geneva at the end of the 16th century to escape religious persecution.

At age seven de Candolle contracted a severe case of hydrocephalus, which significantly affected his childhood. Nevertheless, he is said to have had great aptitude for learning, distinguishing himself in school with his rapid acquisition of knowledge in classical and general literature and his ability to write fine poetry. In 1794, he began his scientific studies at the Collège de Genève, where he studied under Jean Pierre Étienne Vaucher, who later inspired de Candolle to make botanical science the chief pursuit of his life.

==Career in botany==

He spent four years at the Geneva Academy, studying science and law according to his father&#x27;s wishes. In 1798, he moved to Paris after Geneva had been annexed to the French Republic. His botanical career formally began with the help of René Louiche Desfontaines, who recommended de Candolle for work in the herbarium of Charles Louis L&#x27;Héritier de Brutelle during the summer of 1798. The position elevated de Candolle&#x27;s reputation and also led to valuable instruction from Desfontaines himself. de Candolle established his first genus, &quot;Senebiera&quot;, in 1799.

De Candolle&#x27;s first books, &quot;Plantarum historia succulentarum&quot; (4 vols., 1799) and &quot;Astragalogia&quot; (1802), brought him to the notice of Georges Cuvier and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. de Candolle, with Cuvier&#x27;s approval, acted as deputy at the Collège de France in 1802. Lamarck entrusted him with the publication of the third edition of the &quot;Flore française&quot; (1805–1815), and in the introduction entitled &quot;Principes élémentaires de botanique&quot;, de Candolle proposed a natural method of plant classification as opposed to the artificial Linnaean method. The premise of de Candolle&#x27;s method is that taxa do not fall along a linear scale; they are discrete, not continuous. Lamarck had originally published this work in 1778, with a second edition in 1795. The third edition, which bears the name of both Lamarck and de Candolle, was in reality the work of the latter, the former having only lent his name and access to his collection.

In 1804, de Candolle published his &quot;Essai sur les propriétés médicales des plantes&quot; and was granted a doctor of medicine degree by the medical faculty of Paris. Two years later, he published &quot;Synopsis plantarum in flora Gallica descriptarum&quot;. de Candolle then spent the next six summers making a botanical and agricultural survey of France at the request of the French government, which was published in 1813. In 1807, he was appointed professor of botany in the medical faculty of the University of Montpellier, where he would later become the first chair of botany in 1810. His teaching at the University of Montpellier consisted of field classes attended by 200–300 students, starting at 5:00 am and finishing at 7:00 pm.

During this period, de Candolle became a close acquaintance of the Portuguese polymath, José Correia da Serra, who was Portuguese ambassador to Paris and who circulated in an international network of thinkers ranging from the Briton Joseph Banks to the Americans Thomas Jefferson and William Bartram, and the French scholars Antoine Laurent de Jussieu and Georges Cuvier. Correia&#x27;s endorsement of the idea of emphasizing similarity and symmetry in classifying plants influenced de Candolle, who acknowledged as much in his writing.

While in Montpellier, de Candolle published his &quot;Théorie élémentaire de la botanique&quot; (Elementary Theory of Botany, 1813), which introduced a new classification system and the word &quot;taxonomy&quot;. Candolle moved back to Geneva in 1816 and in the following year was invited by the government of the Canton of Geneva to fill the newly created chair of natural history.
De Candolle spent the rest of his life in an attempt to elaborate and complete his natural system of botanical classification. de Candolle published initial work in his &quot;Regni vegetabillis systema naturale&quot;, but after two volumes he realized he could not complete the project on such a large scale. Consequently, he began his less extensive &quot;Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis&quot; in 1824. However, he was able to finish only seven volumes, or two-thirds of the whole. Even so, he was able to characterize over one hundred families of plants, helping to lay the empirical basis of general botany. Although de Candolle&#x27;s main focus was botany, throughout his career he also dabbled in fields related to botany, such as phytogeography, agronomy, paleontology, medical botany, and economic botany.

In 1827, he was elected an associated member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands.

==Later life==

Augustin de Candolle was the first of four generations of botanists in the de Candolle dynasty. He married Mademoiselle Torras and their son, Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle, eventually succeeded to his father&#x27;s chair in botany and continued the &quot;Prodromus&quot;. Casimir de Candolle, Augustin de Candolle&#x27;s grandson, also contributed to the &quot;Prodromus&quot; through his detailed, extensive research and characterization of the plant family Piperaceae. Augustin de Candolle&#x27;s great-grandson, Richard Émile Augustin de Candolle, was also a botanist. Augustin de Candolle died on 9 September 1841 in Geneva, after being sick for many years. That same year, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

In 2017, a book was written in French about his life and one of his greatest contributions, the Botanical Garden of Geneva.

==Legacy==

He is remembered in the plant genera &quot;Candollea&quot; and &quot;Candolleodendron&quot;, several plant species like &quot;Eugenia candolleana&quot; or &quot;Diospyros candolleana&quot; and the mushroom &quot;Psathyrella candolleana&quot;. &quot;Candollea&quot;, a scientific journal that publishes papers on systematic botany and phylotaxonomy, was named after de Candolle and his descendants in honor of their contribution to the field of botany. He was a mentor to the French-Mexican botanist Jean-Louis Berlandier and is credited with encouraging Marie-Anne Libert to investigate cryptogamic flora.

===Classification system===

De Candolle was the first to put forward the idea of &quot;Nature&#x27;s war&quot;, writing of plants being &quot;at war one with another&quot; with the meaning of different species fighting each other for space and resources. Charles Darwin studied de Candolle&#x27;s &quot;natural system&quot; of classification in 1826 when at the University of Edinburgh, and in the inception of Darwin&#x27;s theory in 1838 he considered &quot;the warring of the species&quot;, adding that it was even more strongly conveyed by Thomas Malthus, producing the pressures that Darwin later called natural selection. In 1839, de Candolle visited Britain and Darwin invited him to dinner, allowing the two scientists the opportunity to discuss the idea.

De Candolle was also among the first to recognize the difference between the morphological and physiological characteristics of organs. He ascribed plant morphology as being related to the number of organs and their positions relative to each other rather than to their various physiological properties. Consequently, this made him the first to attempt to attribute specific reasons for structural and numerical relationships amongst organs, and thus to distinguish between major and minor aspects of plant symmetry. To account for modifications of symmetry in parts of different plants, an occurrence that could hinder the discovery of an evolutionary relationship, de Candolle introduced the concept of homology.

===Chronobiology===

De Candolle also made contributions to the field of chronobiology. Building upon earlier work on plant circadian leaf movements contributed by such scientists as Jean-Jacques d&#x27;Ortous de Mairan and Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau, de Candolle observed in 1832 that the plant &quot;Mimosa pudica&quot; had a free-running period of leaf opening and closing of approximately 22–23 hours in constant light, significantly less than the approximate 24-hour period of the Earth&#x27;s light-dark cycles. Since the period was shorter than 24 hours, he hypothesized that a different clock had to be responsible for the rhythm; the shortened period was not entrained—coordinated—by environmental cues, thus the clock appeared to be endogenous. Despite these findings, a number of scientists continued to search for &quot;factor X&quot;, an unknown exogenous factor associated with the Earth&#x27;s rotation that was driving circadian oscillations in the absence of a light dark schedule, until the mid-twentieth century. In the mid-1920s, Erwin Bunning repeated Candolle&#x27;s findings and came to similar conclusions, and studies that showed the persistence of circadian rhythm in the South Pole and in a space lab further confirmed the existence of oscillations in the absence of environmental cues.

<text>Émile Auguste Étienne Martin Deschanel (19 November 1819, Paris – 26 January 1904, Paris) was a French author and politician, the father of Paul Deschanel, the 11th President of the French Republic.

He graduated from École normale supérieure. His works include: &quot;Études sur Aristophane&quot; (1867), &quot;Le Romantisme des classiques&quot; (1882), and the earlier, controversial &quot;Catholicisme et socialisme&quot; (1850) - as a result of which, Napoleon III forced him into exile between 1851 and 1859. He later became a professor at the Collège de France. He was a member of the French Parliament from 1876 until 1881 and, in 1881, became a senator for life.

A street bearing his name is located in the 7th arrondissement of Paris bordering the Champ de Mars.

<text>Irving John Good (9 December 1916 – 5 April 2009)
was a British mathematician who worked as a cryptologist at Bletchley Park with Alan Turing. After the Second World War, Good continued to work with Turing on the design of computers and Bayesian statistics at the University of Manchester. Good moved to the United States where he was a professor at Virginia Tech.

He was born Isadore Jacob Gudak to a Polish Jewish family in London. He later anglicised his name to Irving John Good and signed his publications &quot;I. J. Good.&quot;

An originator of the concept known as the intelligence explosion, Good served as consultant on supercomputers to Stanley Kubrick, director of the 1968 film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;.

Good was born Isadore Jacob Gudak to Polish Jewish parents in London. His father was a watchmaker, who later managed and owned a successful fashionable jewellery shop, and was also a notable Yiddish writer writing under the pen name of Moshe Oved. Good was educated at the Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s Boys&#x27; School, at the time in Hampstead in northwest London, where, according to Dan van der Vat, Good effortlessly outpaced the mathematics curriculum.

Good studied mathematics at Jesus College, Cambridge, graduating in 1938 and winning the Smith&#x27;s Prize in 1940. He did research under G. H. Hardy and Abram Besicovitch before moving to Bletchley Park in 1941 on completing his doctorate.

===Bletchley Park===
On 27 May 1941, having just obtained his doctorate at Cambridge, Good walked into Hut 8, Bletchley&#x27;s facility for breaking German naval ciphers, for his first shift. This was the day that Britain&#x27;s Royal Navy destroyed the after it had sunk the Royal Navy&#x27;s . Bletchley had contributed to &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s destruction by discovering, through wireless-traffic analysis, that the German flagship was sailing for Brest, France, rather than Wilhelmshaven, from which she had set out.
Hut 8 had not, however, been able to decrypt on a current basis the 22 German Naval Enigma messages that had been sent to &quot;Bismarck&quot;. The German Navy&#x27;s Enigma cyphers were considerably more secure than those of the German Army or Air Force, which had been well penetrated by 1940. Naval messages were taking three to seven days to decrypt, which usually made them operationally useless for the British. This was about to change, however, with Good&#x27;s help.

Good served with Turing for nearly two years. Subsequently, he worked with Donald Michie in Max Newman&#x27;s group on the Fish ciphers, leading to the development of the Colossus computer.

Good was a member of the Bletchley Chess Club which defeated the Oxford University Chess Club 8–4 in a twelve-board team match held on 2 December 1944. Good played fourth board for Bletchley Park, with Conel Hugh O&#x27;Donel Alexander, Harry Golombek and James Macrae Aitken in the top three spots. He won his game against Sir Robert Robinson.

===Postwar work===
In 1947, Newman invited Good to join him and Turing at Manchester University. There, for three years, Good lectured in mathematics and researched computers, including the Manchester Mark 1.

In 1948, Good was recruited back to the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). He remained there until 1959, while also taking up a brief associate professorship at Princeton University and a short consultancy with IBM.

From 1959 until he moved to the US in 1967, Good held government-funded positions and from 1964 a senior research fellowship at Trinity College, Oxford, and the Atlas Computer Laboratory, where he continued his interests in computing, statistics and chess. He later left Oxford, declaring it &quot;a little stiff&quot;.

===United States===
In 1967, Good moved to the United States, where he was appointed a research professor of statistics at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. In 1969, he was appointed a University Distinguished Professor at Virginia Tech, and in 1994 Emeritus University Distinguished Professor.
In 1973, he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.

He later said about his arrival in Virginia (from Britain) in 1967 to start teaching at VPI, where he taught from 1967 to 1994:

==Research and publications==
Good&#x27;s published work ran to over three million words.
He was known for his work on Bayesian statistics. Kass and Raftery credit Good (and in turn Turing) with coining the term &quot;Bayes factor&quot;. Good published a number of books on probability theory. In 1958, he published an early version of what later became known as the fast Fourier transform but it did not become widely known. He played chess to county standard and helped popularise Go, an Asian boardgame, through a 1965 article in &quot;New Scientist&quot; (he had learned the rules from Alan Turing). In 1965, he originated the concept now known as &quot;intelligence explosion&quot; or the &quot;technological singularity&quot;, which anticipates the eventual advent of superhuman intelligence:

Good&#x27;s authorship of treatises such as his 1965 &quot;Speculations Concerning the First Ultraintelligent Machine&quot; and &quot;Logic of Man and Machine&quot; made him the obvious person for Stanley Kubrick to consult when filming &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968), one of whose principal characters was the paranoid HAL 9000 supercomputer. In 1995, Good was elected a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Graphcore&#x27;s proposed foundation model $600m computer, that uses Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, which will have the potential capacity of running programs with 500trn parameters, was named to honor Good&#x27;s intellectual heritage. According to The Economist, Graphcore aims to take the &quot;first step&quot; towards creating I. J. Good&#x27;s imagined &quot;Ultraintelligent Machine&quot;.

According to his assistant, Leslie Pendleton, in 1998 Good wrote in an unpublished autobiographical statement that he suspected an ultraintelligent machine would lead to the extinction of man.

==Personality==
Good published a paper under the names IJ Good and &quot;K Caj Doog&quot;—the latter, his own nickname spelled backwards. In a 1988 paper, he introduced its subject by saying, &quot;Many people have contributed to this topic but I shall mainly review the writings of I. J. Good because I have read them all carefully.&quot; In Virginia he chose, as his vanity licence plate, &quot;007IJG,&quot; in subtle reference to his Second World War intelligence work.

Good never married. After going through ten assistants in his first thirteen years at Virginia Tech, he hired Leslie Pendleton, who proved up to the task of managing his quirks. He wanted to marry her, but she refused. Although there was speculation, they were never more than friends, but she was his assistant, companion, and friend for the rest of his life.

==Death==
Good died on 5 April 2009 of natural causes in Radford, Virginia, aged 92.

<doc id="404405" wikidata="Q234388" url="?curid=404405" title="Rebbie Jackson">
<text>Maureen Reillette &quot;Rebbie&quot; Jackson-Brown (; born May 29, 1950) is an American singer and the eldest child of the Jackson family of musicians. She first performed on stage with her siblings during shows in Las Vegas, Nevada, at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino in 1974, before subsequently appearing in the television series &quot;The Jacksons&quot;. At age 34, Jackson released her debut album &quot;Centipede&quot; (1984). The album&#x27;s title track was written by her younger brother Michael and it has been her most successful single release to date. Jackson released two more albums: &quot;Reaction&quot; (1986) and &quot;R U Tuff Enuff&quot; (1988).

Following a 7-year hiatus, Jackson returned with a cover of &quot;Forever Young&quot; for the &quot;Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home&quot; soundtrack before the release of the 1998 album &quot;Yours Faithfully&quot; three years later. The production of the album, her last to date, was a collaboration with artists and producers such as Men of Vizion&#x27;s Spanky Williams, Keith Thomas, and Eliot Kennedy. It also featured contributions from her children. In 2011, Rebbie embarked on the Pick Up the Phone Tour, which is dedicated to teens from all over the U.S. who have committed suicide.

==Life and career==

===Childhood and youth===

Maureen Reillette Jackson was born at 2300 Jackson Street in Gary, Indiana to a working-class family on May 29, 1950. She is first daughter of Joseph Walter &quot;Joe&quot; (July 26, 1928 – June 27, 2018), and Katherine Esther (née Scruse, May 4, 1930), she is the eldest of their 10 children. Her siblings are Jackie, Tito (d. September 15, 2024), Jermaine, La Toya (born on Rebbie&#x27;s sixth birthday), Marlon, Brandon (d. March 12, 1957), Michael (d. June 25, 2009), Randy, and Janet. 

Joseph was a steel mill employee who often performed in a rhythm and blues (R&amp;B) band called the Falcons with his brother, Luther. Katherine is a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness and raised her children to follow the religion. Rebbie, La Toya, and Michael became the most devout of the children as time progressed. Reflecting on her early life, Rebbie acknowledged in a 1980s magazine interview that her role within the family had been that of a &quot;second mother&quot; to her younger siblings, whom she would often babysit, along with her eldest brother Jackie. She graduated from Theodore Roosevelt High School in Gary in 1968.

===Early career===
Jackson began her singing career in 1974, performing with her siblings in Las Vegas. The Vegas shows had initially begun in April, without Rebbie; due to a sprained ankle, Rebbie&#x27;s debut was postponed until June. Her five brothers were the main draws, with Rebbie, Randy, Janet, and La Toya serving as fillers for the performances.

When the Jackson 5 parted with their record label Motown in 1976, they signed to CBS Records and rebranded themselves The Jacksons. Additionally, the brothers were signed to CBS-TV to star with their family in a variety series called &quot;The Jacksons&quot;. The show premiered in June 1976 and featured all of the siblings excluding Jermaine, who had chosen to stay with Motown. The initial series run of the 30-minute programs was four weeks. Due to ratings success, more episodes were ordered in January 1977. The show marked the first time that an African-American family had ever starred in a television series. The run of programs concluded shortly afterward.

Prior to the series, Jackson had thought of her singing as merely a private hobby. Her television experience, as well as an early love of musicals, motivated her to become a professional recording artist, and the show&#x27;s producer encouraged her to sing. Jackson served as a backing vocalist for several musicians around this time, as well as a cabaret singer. She contributed her voice for songs by such artists as The Emotions, Sonny Bono, and Betty Wright before her second pregnancy stalled her musical career for a short time.

===&quot;Centipede&quot;===
Following years of preparation, Jackson&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Centipede&quot;, was released in October 1984 by Columbia Records, which had signed her as a solo artist two years previously. The album was only released once Jackson had ensured that family life was secure, and that she had spent time with her children during their younger years. &quot;Centipede&quot; reached number 13 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and number 63 on its Top 200. The recording of the album had been a family affair; it involved several contributions from her relatives. Her husband Nathaniel Brown (1949–2013) co-wrote the song &quot;Come Alive Saturday Night&quot; with two of his wife&#x27;s brothers, Randy and Tito. The latter Jackson also penned &quot;Hey Boy&quot; with his wife Dee Dee. The most successful song from the album was the million-selling title track, &quot;Centipede&quot;. Written, arranged, and produced by Michael, the song also featured Jackson&#x27;s famous brother and The Weather Girls on backing vocals. It reached number 4 on the Black Singles Chart and was subsequently certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. &quot;Centipede&quot; marked Michael&#x27;s first effort at writing and producing since the release of his successful &quot;Thriller&quot; (1982).

Other tracks from Rebbie&#x27;s album included cover versions of songs by Prince (&quot;I Feel for You&quot;) and Smokey Robinson and the Miracles (&quot;A Fork in the Road&quot;). The album received mixed reviews from journalists and music critics.&lt;ref name=&quot;An Oddly Compatible Couple: Johnny Mathis, Husker Du Pop Music/singles&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to &quot;Jet&quot; magazine, &quot;Centipede&quot; marked Jackson&#x27;s emergence as a &quot;legitimate recording artist&quot; and &quot;cleared the major hurdle of demonstrating that she [was] talented and marketable.&quot; With the album, Jackson became the last of her siblings to embark on a recording career and the last in line to release hit material.

Rebbie later revealed that several discussions occurred at the time of the release of &quot;Centipede&quot; over whether she should use the Jackson surname professionally or not. To begin with, Rebbie did not want to use her maiden surname, but later reasoned that it was silly to deny her heritage. Jackson stated that she did, however, compromise with the use of her family name on the &quot;Centipede&quot; album cover, explaining, &quot;Rebbie is large and Jackson is small.&quot; She further stated that the success of siblings Michael and Janet had not been a hindrance to her, but served as an enhancement to her career. Rebbie added that she did not have to worry about &quot;name recognition.&quot;

===&quot;Reaction&quot; and &quot;R U Tuff Enuff&quot;===
&quot;Reaction&quot; served as the follow-up album to &quot;Centipede&quot;, and was released in October 1986. It was recorded at Tito&#x27;s Ponderosa Studios in Los Angeles, California. Tito produced &quot;Reaction&quot; along with David Conley and David Townsend of the R&amp;B group Surface. Duets were featured on the album, including one with Cheap Trick lead singer Robin Zander, and another with Isaac Hayes. The Zander-Jackson collaboration (&quot;You Send the Rain Away&quot;) was released as a single, and peaked at number 50 on the R&amp;B singles chart. Jackson&#x27;s duet with Hayes, the ballad &quot;Tonight I&#x27;m Yours,&quot; was not released as a single, though received substantial airplay. &quot;Reaction&quot;&#x27;s title track (&quot;Reaction&quot;) was the most popular hit from the album, reaching number 16 on the R&amp;B singles chart.

The album &quot;R U Tuff Enuff&quot; succeeded &quot;Reaction&quot; upon its release in July 1988. Jackson was more involved with the production of this album than she had been on her previous releases. She stated at the time of &quot;R U Tuff Enuff&quot;&#x27;s distribution that the sound on the album differed from anything she had done previously. Jackson commented that the album was &quot;more versatile,&quot; while noting that it resembled other albums because it contained a lot of dance music. Two singles were released from the album and charted on the R&amp;B singles chart: &quot;Plaything,&quot; which made it into the top 10, and the title track &quot;R U Tuff Enuff,&quot; which peaked at number 78.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rebbie Jackson chart history: R&amp;B/hip-hop songs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-June 1988, &quot;R U Tuff Enuff&quot; had reportedly sold 300,000 copies. MTV later concluded that the album &quot;struggled&quot;. Jackson lent her vocals to &quot;2300 Jackson Street&quot; (the title track of her brothers&#x27; &quot;2300 Jackson Street&quot; album), before taking a hiatus from releasing music. Jackson later stated that she performed around the world during this break.

===Return to Music and &quot;Yours Faithfully&quot;===
 Following a 7-year break, Jackson returned with a cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Forever Young&quot; for the 1995 film &quot;Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home&quot;. She was later signed to her brother Michael&#x27;s record label MJJ Music and the first album in 10 years, &quot;Yours Faithfully&quot;, was released on March 31, 1998. It featured a remixed version of Jackson&#x27;s successful &quot;Centipede.&quot; Initially, the singer had not wanted to feature the track, believing that it was part of the past. After thinking about it for a while, Jackson felt that the inclusion of the remix—which features a rap by son Austin—would be a good way to return to the music scene. In addition, her two other children, Stacee and Yashi, contributed backing vocals for the album. Other tracks from the album included &quot;Fly Away,&quot; which was written and produced by brother Michael, who also served as co-executive producer for &quot;Yours Faithfully&quot;. Fellow producers included Keith Thomas and Eliot Kennedy. The album also featured a duet with Men of Vizion&#x27;s Spanky Williams on the Spinners&#x27; &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Lose You,&quot; which &quot;Jet&quot; described as being a &quot;sizzling&quot; rendition. &quot;Yours Faithfully&quot; title track was released as a single and peaked at number 78 on the R&amp;B chart. &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine&#x27;s Quohnos Mitchell expressed disappointment in the album, calling its content a &quot;mix of dated R&amp;B grooves dressed up with a few cleverly placed samples.&quot;

===Death of Michael Jackson===
Rebbie&#x27;s brother Michael died on June 25, 2009, after suffering a cardiac arrest. His memorial service was held 12 days later on July 7, and the finale featured group renditions of the Jackson anthems &quot;We Are the World&quot; and &quot;Heal the World.&quot; The singalong featured Michael&#x27;s siblings (including Rebbie) and the late singer&#x27;s children. Following the service—which was held at Los Angeles&#x27; Staples Center—Rebbie, along with sisters Janet and La Toya, addressed fans at the nearby L.A. Live entertainment complex, stating, &quot;We are extremely grateful for all the support. We love you all.&quot; In the weeks following Michael&#x27;s death, it was speculated by media sources that Rebbie would be the primary caregiver for her late brother&#x27;s children, Prince, Paris, and Blanket. It was stated that even if Michael and Rebbie&#x27;s mother Katherine were granted custody of the children, Rebbie would care for the siblings on a day-to-day basis at the Jackson family&#x27;s Encino home. Katherine was named their legal guardian in August 2009. In early 2011, Rebbie announced she&#x27;d begun recording tracks for a new album, her first in 14 years. She also performed throughout the U.S. with a setlist containing her best-known songs, some of her brothers&#x27; songs, and some Motown classics.

==Personal life==

The 18-year-old Rebbie&#x27;s announcement that she wanted to marry her childhood love Nathaniel Brown in November 1968 created division in the Jackson family. Jackson expressed her feelings for the man, and proclaimed that she wanted to move with him to Kentucky. Katherine encouraged her daughter to proceed, feeling that being a wife and mother were important roles for all of her daughters. 

However, Joseph opposed the marriage; he wanted Rebbie to follow in her brothers&#x27; footsteps and become a singer and felt that married life would stop her from becoming a success in the entertainment business. Rebbie had taken clarinet, piano, and dance lessons in her childhood, but had no interest in a music career, even though, according to Jermaine, she had won several singing contests dueting with Jackie. 

Rebbie had expressed that a happy home was more comforting and secure than the instability of show business. She also wanted to leave her family&#x27;s drama-filled home on Jackson Street and escape her abusive father. Arguments ensued for several weeks before her father relented and allowed Rebbie to marry Brown, but he refused to walk her down the aisle. Nathaniel Brown died of cancer on January 6, 2013.

Jackson and Brown had three children:

* Stacee Brown (born May 5, 1971). 
* Yashi Brown (born October 5, 1977). 
* Austin Brown (born November 22, 1985).

<text>Bayesian statistics ( or ) is a theory in the field of statistics based on the Bayesian interpretation of probability, where probability expresses a &quot;degree of belief&quot; in an event. The degree of belief may be based on prior knowledge about the event, such as the results of previous experiments, or on personal beliefs about the event. This differs from a number of other interpretations of probability, such as the frequentist interpretation, which views probability as the limit of the relative frequency of an event after many trials. More concretely, analysis in Bayesian methods codifies prior knowledge in the form of a prior distribution.

Bayesian statistical methods use Bayes&#x27; theorem to compute and update probabilities after obtaining new data. Bayes&#x27; theorem describes the conditional probability of an event based on data as well as prior information or beliefs about the event or conditions related to the event. For example, in Bayesian inference, Bayes&#x27; theorem can be used to estimate the parameters of a probability distribution or statistical model. Since Bayesian statistics treats probability as a degree of belief, Bayes&#x27; theorem can directly assign a probability distribution that quantifies the belief to the parameter or set of parameters.

Bayesian statistics is named after Thomas Bayes, who formulated a specific case of Bayes&#x27; theorem in a paper published in 1763. In several papers spanning from the late 18th to the early 19th centuries, Pierre-Simon Laplace developed the Bayesian interpretation of probability. Laplace used methods now considered Bayesian to solve a number of statistical problems. While many Bayesian methods were developed by later authors, the term &quot;Bayesian&quot; was not commonly used to describe these methods until the 1950s. Throughout much of the 20th century, Bayesian methods were viewed unfavorably by many statisticians due to philosophical and practical considerations. Many of these methods required much computation, and most widely used approaches during that time were based on the frequentist interpretation. However, with the advent of powerful computers and new algorithms like Markov chain Monte Carlo, Bayesian methods have gained increasing prominence in statistics in the 21st century.

== Bayes&#x27;s theorem ==

Bayes&#x27;s theorem is used in Bayesian methods to update probabilities, which are degrees of belief, after obtaining new data. Given two events formula_1 and formula_2, the conditional probability of formula_1 given that formula_2 is true is expressed as follows:

formula_5

where formula_6. Although Bayes&#x27;s theorem is a fundamental result of probability theory, it has a specific interpretation in Bayesian statistics. In the above equation, formula_1 usually represents a proposition (such as the statement that a coin lands on heads fifty percent of the time) and formula_2 represents the evidence, or new data that is to be taken into account (such as the result of a series of coin flips). formula_9 is the prior probability of formula_1 which expresses one&#x27;s beliefs about formula_1 before evidence is taken into account. The prior probability may also quantify prior knowledge or information about formula_1. formula_13 is the likelihood function, which can be interpreted as the probability of the evidence formula_2 given that formula_1 is true. The likelihood quantifies the extent to which the evidence formula_2 supports the proposition formula_1. formula_18 is the posterior probability, the probability of the proposition formula_1 after taking the evidence formula_2 into account. Essentially, Bayes&#x27;s theorem updates one&#x27;s prior beliefs formula_9 after considering the new evidence formula_2.

The probability of the evidence formula_23 can be calculated using the law of total probability. If formula_24 is a partition of the sample space, which is the set of all outcomes of an experiment, then,

formula_25

When there are an infinite number of outcomes, it is necessary to integrate over all outcomes to calculate formula_23 using the law of total probability. Often, formula_23 is difficult to calculate as the calculation would involve sums or integrals that would be time-consuming to evaluate, so often only the product of the prior and likelihood is considered, since the evidence does not change in the same analysis. The posterior is proportional to this product:

formula_28

The maximum a posteriori, which is the mode of the posterior and is often computed in Bayesian statistics using mathematical optimization methods, remains the same. The posterior can be approximated even without computing the exact value of formula_23 with methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo or variational Bayesian methods.

==Bayesian methods==

The general set of statistical techniques can be divided into a number of activities, many of which have special Bayesian versions.

=== Bayesian inference ===

Bayesian inference refers to statistical inference where uncertainty in inferences is quantified using probability. In classical frequentist inference, model parameters and hypotheses are considered to be fixed. Probabilities are not assigned to parameters or hypotheses in frequentist inference. For example, it would not make sense in frequentist inference to directly assign a probability to an event that can only happen once, such as the result of the next flip of a fair coin. However, it would make sense to state that the proportion of heads approaches one-half as the number of coin flips increases.

Statistical models specify a set of statistical assumptions and processes that represent how the sample data are generated. Statistical models have a number of parameters that can be modified. For example, a coin can be represented as samples from a Bernoulli distribution, which models two possible outcomes. The Bernoulli distribution has a single parameter equal to the probability of one outcome, which in most cases is the probability of landing on heads. Devising a good model for the data is central in Bayesian inference. In most cases, models only approximate the true process, and may not take into account certain factors influencing the data. In Bayesian inference, probabilities can be assigned to model parameters. Parameters can be represented as random variables. Bayesian inference uses Bayes&#x27; theorem to update probabilities after more evidence is obtained or known. Furthermore, Bayesian methods allow for placing priors on entire models and calculating their posterior probabilities using Bayes&#x27; theorem. These posterior probabilities 
are proportional to the product of the prior and the marginal likelihood, 
where the marginal likelihood is the integral of the sampling density over the prior distribution 
of the parameters. In complex models, marginal likelihoods are 
generally computed numerically.

===Statistical modeling===
The formulation of statistical models using Bayesian statistics has the identifying feature of requiring the specification of prior distributions for any unknown parameters. Indeed, parameters of prior distributions may themselves have prior distributions, leading to Bayesian hierarchical modeling, also known as multi-level modeling. A special case is Bayesian networks.

For conducting a Bayesian statistical analysis, best practices are discussed by van de Schoot et al. 

For reporting the results of a Bayesian statistical analysis, Bayesian analysis reporting guidelines (BARG) are provided in an open-access article by John K. Kruschke.

===Design of experiments===
The Bayesian design of experiments includes a concept called &#x27;influence of prior beliefs&#x27;. This approach uses sequential analysis techniques to include the outcome of earlier experiments in the design of the next experiment. This is achieved by updating &#x27;beliefs&#x27; through the use of prior and posterior distribution. This allows the design of experiments to make good use of resources of all types. An example of this is the multi-armed bandit problem.

===Exploratory analysis of Bayesian models===

Exploratory analysis of Bayesian models is an adaptation or extension of the exploratory data analysis approach to the needs and peculiarities of Bayesian modeling. In the words of Persi Diaconis: 
The inference process generates a posterior distribution, which has a central role in Bayesian statistics, together with other distributions like the posterior predictive distribution and the prior predictive distribution. The correct visualization, analysis, and interpretation of these distributions is key to properly answer the questions that motivate the inference process.

When working with Bayesian models there are a series of related tasks that need to be addressed besides inference itself:

* Diagnoses of the quality of the inference, this is needed when using numerical methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques
* Model criticism, including evaluations of both model assumptions and model predictions
* Comparison of models, including model selection or model averaging
* Preparation of the results for a particular audience

All these tasks are part of the Exploratory analysis of Bayesian models approach and successfully performing them is central to the iterative and interactive modeling process. These tasks require both numerical and visual summaries.

<text>The northern oriole (&quot;Icterus galbula&quot;), considered a species of North American bird from 1973 to 1995, brought together the eastern Baltimore oriole, &quot;Icterus galbula&quot;, and the western Bullock&#x27;s oriole, &quot;Icterus bullockii&quot;. Observations of interbreeding between the Baltimore and the Bullock&#x27;s oriole led to this classification as a single species. Research by James Rising, a professor of zoology at the University of Toronto, and others subsequently showed that the two birds did not interbreed significantly.

<text>Neustadt (Aisch)-Bad Windsheim (German: Landkreis Neustadt an der Aisch-Bad Windsheim, official Landkreis Neustadt a.d.Aisch-Bad Windsheim) is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the west and clockwise) the districts of Würzburg, Kitzingen, Bamberg, Erlangen-Höchstadt, Fürth and Ansbach, and by the state of Baden-Württemberg (district Main-Tauber).

==History==
The district was established in 1972 by merging the former districts of Neustadt (Aisch), Uffenheim and Scheinfeld.

==Geography==
The district is covered by the Steigerwald and Frankenhöhe nature parks, both comprising large forested and hilly areas. The Aisch, a small affluent of the Regnitz River, runs through the district from southwest to northeast, with all main towns of the district on its banks.

==Economy==
In 2017 (latest data available) the GDP per inhabitant was €29,307. This places the district 82nd out of 96 districts (rural and urban) in Bavaria (overall average: €46,698).

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays:
* the dog from the arms of the margraves of Nuremberg
* the eagle from the arms of the Hohenzollern dynasty
* the blue and white bars from the lords of Seinsheim

<doc id="404424" wikidata="Q3398760" url="?curid=404424" title="Bruce Andrews">
<text>Bruce Andrews (born April 1, 1948) is an American poet who is one of the key figures associated with the Language poets (or &quot;L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E&quot; &quot;poets&quot;, after the magazine that bears that name).

==Life and work==
Andrews was born in Chicago and studied international relations at Johns Hopkins University and political science at Harvard. His first book, &quot;Edge&quot;, was published in 1973.

===Language poetry===
Together with Charles Bernstein, he edited &quot;L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E&quot; Magazine, which ran to 13 issues between 1978 and 1981 and (along with other magazines such as &quot;This&quot;, &quot;A Hundred Posters,&quot; &quot;Big Deal,&quot; &quot;Dog City,&quot; &quot;Hills,&quot; &quot;Là Bas,&quot; &quot;Oculist Witnesses,&quot; &quot;QU,&quot; and &quot;Roof&quot;) was one of the most important outlets for Language poetry. In 1984 he and Bernstein published most of the contents of the 13 issues in &quot;The L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Book&quot;.

Andrews rejects the classical notion of poetry as the &#x27;direct treatment&#x27; of things in language, arguing that the only thing that can be so treated is language itself.

===Andrews and politics===
Andrews was a professor of political science at Fordham University from 1975 to 2013. He harshly criticized what he called the US government&#x27;s policies of oppression and subversion.

Andrews appeared on the O&#x27;Reilly Factor in November 2006 after a Fordham student who interned on the program complained about Andrews&#x27; leftist views.

===Publications===
Andrews has published about forty books of poetry, either on his own or in collaboration with other writers, as well as a number of books of essays. His books include &quot;I Don&#x27;t Have Any Paper So Shut Up (Or, Social Romanticism)&quot; (1992) and &quot;Ex Why Zee: Performance Texts, Collaborations with Sally Silvers, Word Maps, Bricolage &amp; Improvisation&quot; (1995). &quot;Designated Heartbeat&quot; (Salt Publishing, 2006; ) and &quot;Swoon Noir&quot; (Chax Press, 2007; ) bring Andrews well into the 21st century.

<doc id="404425" wikidata="Q1052665" url="?curid=404425" title="Patagonian toothfish">
<text>The Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), also known as Chilean sea bass, mero, and icefish, is a species of notothen found in cold waters () between depths of in the southern Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans and Southern Ocean on seamounts and continental shelves around most Subantarctic islands.

The average weight of a commercially caught Patagonian toothfish is , depending on the fishery, with large adults occasionally exceeding . They are thought to live up to 50 years and to reach a length up to . Several commercial fisheries exist for Patagonian toothfish, which are detailed below.

A close relative, the Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni), is found farther south around the edges of the Antarctic shelf, and a Marine Stewardship Council-certified fishery is active in the Ross Sea; it is also sometimes marketed as Chilean sea bass.

==Taxonomy==
The Patagonian toothfish was first formally described in 1898 by the Swedish zoologist Fredrik Adam Smitt with the type locality given as Puerto Toro at 55°24&#x27;S, 68°17&#x27;W on the Chilean part of Tierra del Fuego. Smitt also described the new genus &quot;Dissostichus&quot; for this new species, meaning that the Patagonian toothfish is the type species of this genus by monotypy. The specific name &quot;eleginoides&quot; means having the form of, i.e. having a similar shape to, &quot;Eleginops&quot;.

==Description==
The Patagonian toothfish has a streamlined, fusiform body that has a depth that fits into its standard length 5 to 6.4 times. It has a flattened head with a wide, flat area between the eyes. The snout is longer than the diameter of the eyes. The mouth is large, extending past the middle of the eye. There are two rows of teeth in the upper jaw, the teeth in the outer row being the larger and canine-like. The lower jaw has a row of spaced canine-like teeth. Additional canine-like teeth are found outside the teeth rows at the joint of the upper and lower jaws. There are two lateral lines; both made up of tubed scales, an upper one and another along the mid flanks. The upper lateral line has 88–104 scales while the lower line has 61–77 scales. The first dorsal fin has 8 to 10 spines; the second dorsal fin has 28 to 30 soft rays, while the anal fin also has 28–30 soft rays. The caudal fin is emarginate. The pectoral fins are large and shaped like fans. The head and body are covered in ctenoid scales except for the front of the head. This species attains a maximum total length of although is more typical, and a maximum published weight of . The overall colour is brownish-grey with darker blotches.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Patagonian toothfish is found in the southeastern Pacific and southwestern Atlantic Oceans. It occurs in southern Chile around the coast of Patagonia, in Argentina, and the Falkland Islands. It has also been recorded at Macquarie Island in the southwestern Pacific Ocean and the Southern Ocean at South Georgia and from the sub-Antarctic islands and seamounts of the Indian Sector. There is a single record of a vagrant from the Davis Strait in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean off Greenland, it is thought that this individual migrated over and that it transited across the tropical areas in deep, cold regions of the ocean. The juveniles are semi-pelagic, becoming demersal at depths between . Adults move to deeper habitats, being found at depths in excess of .

==Biology==
Patagonian toothfish spawn in deep water (around 1,000 m) during the austral winter, producing pelagic eggs and larvae. Larvae switch to a demersal habitat at around 100 m (1 year old) and inhabit relatively shallow water (&lt;300 m) until 6–7 years of age, when they begin a gradual migration into deeper water. As juveniles in shallow water, toothfish are primarily piscivorous, consuming the most abundant, suitably sized local prey. With increasing size and habitat depth, the diet diversifies and includes more scavenging of squid, fish, and crustaceans. In turn, toothfish constitute a small part of the diets of sperm whales, southern elephant seals, and colossal squid.

As most toothfish fisheries are managed in accordance with Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) regulations and conservation measures, CCAMLR adopts an &quot;ecosystem approach&quot;, which requires that all other living resources of the Southern Ocean are treated as an integrated system where effects on predator, prey, and related species are considered, and decisions on sustainable harvesting levels are made based on sound, internationally peer-reviewed scientific advice.

==Fisheries and fisheries management==
===Commercial name===
The Patagonian and the Antarctic toothfishes are sometimes sold under the culinary name &quot;Chilean sea bass&quot; in the United States and Canada.

The name &quot;Chilean seabass&quot; was invented by a fish wholesaler named Lee Lantz in 1977. He was looking for a name to make it attractive to the American market. He considered &quot;Pacific sea bass&quot; and &quot;South American sea bass&quot; before settling on &quot;Chilean sea bass&quot;. In 1994, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration accepted &quot;Chilean seabass&quot; as an &quot;alternative market name&quot; for Patagonian toothfish, and in 2013 for Antarctic toothfish.

In the UK, the approved commercial designations for &quot;D. eleginoides&quot; and &quot;D. mawsoni&quot; are &quot;icefish&quot; and &quot;toothfish&quot;. This has created some confusion, as a genuine &quot;icefish&quot; (&quot;Champsocephalus gunnari&quot;) caught in subantarctic waters does not resemble toothfish in any way.

In Singapore, the Patagonian toothfish is marketed as a type of cod fish.

===Management===
Commercial fishing of toothfish is managed by the CCAMLR inside the CCAMLR Convention Area, which spans the Antarctic continent and waters between the 45th and 60th parallels south. Some fisheries inside territorial waters within the convention area (e.g. Crozet, Prince Edward, and Marion Islands) are managed separately by countries with territorial waters taking CCAMLR management practices into account. Toothfish fisheries outside the CCAMLR Convention Area in the coastal waters of Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay are managed by the relevant coastal state. However, these fisheries are still subject to the CCAMLR Catch Documentation Scheme, which tracks the trade of toothfish from the point of unloading to the point of final consumption.

In the legal toothfish fisheries managed by CCAMLR and countries with territorial waters, the most common method is fishing by longlines (where a long &quot;mainline&quot; is set in the water, with many baited hooks coming off that line). A small quantity of toothfish is caught by trawling (where a net is towed behind the boat for short periods). For all methods of legal fishing for toothfish, the interactions with, and risks to, seabirds are minimal. This is a result of requirements for legal operators to use mitigation devices or approaches, such as:
* Seasonal fishery closures during the summer due to increases in seabird abundance for chick rearing
* No setting of hooks during the daytime
* No fishing without having a bird-scaring line trailing out the back of the boat to keep birds away from the hooks
* Bird exclusion devices or &quot;Brickle curtains&quot; to be used on 100% of hauls
* Boats must use weighted longlines so that the baits and hooks sink before the birds can grab them;
* Limitations on release of offal overboard at the same time as the setting or hauling of lines (to avoid attracting seabirds when they may otherwise be vulnerable to the baits and hooks)

In 2011, the CCAMLR Scientific Committee Chair, David Agnew, was quoted as saying, &quot;levels of seabird mortality are negligible in most areas&quot;, with the one region yet to achieve these &quot;near zero&quot; results, having reduced seabird interactions by over 98% from their peak levels, and have continued to improve each year. Nevertheless, interactions between the fishery and marine mammals such as sperm whales, orca, fur seals, and elephant seals are not uncommon and can be fatal.

Trawling generally catches toothfish in the smaller size range, which requires calculations to be made at the annual stock assessment meetings of CCAMLR to take these catches of smaller-sized fish into account, and lowers the overall available catch of toothfish by trawl. CCAMLR has prohibited all trawl fishing in high seas waters and exploratory fisheries.

===Compliance===
To minimize the risk of long-term adverse effects on target species, bycatch species, and marine ecosystems, CCAMLR uses several compliance systems to monitor fishing activities in the convention area. These include:
* Vessel licensing
* Monitoring of transhipments
* Vessel and port inspection systems
* Automated satellite-linked vessel-monitoring systems
* Catch document scheme (CDS): The scheme for Patagonian toothfish (&quot;Dissostichus eleginoides&quot;) and Antarctic toothfish (&quot;Dissostichus mawsoni&quot;) was one measure that ensured reductions in illegal fishing for toothfish and reduced the scope for trade in illegally caught fish. The CDS is an innovative online catch document information system (&quot;Dissostichus&quot; Catch Document) developed to identify legal toothfish harvested, which tracks toothfish from the point of landing throughout the trade cycle to the point of sale. The CDS requires verification and authorization by national authorities at regular intervals in the trade cycle. Identification of the origin of toothfish entering the ports and markets of CDS parties is essential.

===Legal fishing===
The Coalition of Legal Toothfish Operators, Inc. (COLTO) is a toothfish fishing industry group whose members represent around 80% of the legal toothfish catch worldwide. Seven of the fisheries that COLTO members fish are now independently certified by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) as sustainable and well-managed fisheries. Commercial fishing of Patagonian and Antarctic toothfish is managed by CCAMLR around most of the Subantarctic and Antarctic regions, but a fishery that lies within a nation&#x27;s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) is managed by that nation, taking into account management recommendations and approaches by CCAMLR.

In 2004, the South Georgia toothfish fishery (CCAMLR Statistical Division 48.3) was the first toothfish fishery to be MSC-certified and was recertified in 2009 and 2014, as all MSC-certified fisheries must be audited annually and fully reassessed every five years. The South Georgia fishery is managed by the UK overseas territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.

The Ross Sea fishery (CCAMLR Statistical Division 88.1 and 88.2) was the second toothfish fishery to be independently evaluated and certified by the MSC as sustainable and well-managed in 2010 and recertified in 2015. This fishery catches mainly Antarctic toothfish, a close relative of the Patagonian toothfish.

The Heard Island and McDonald Islands fishery (CCAMLR Statistical Division 58.5.2) was certified as a sustainable and well-managed fishery by the MSC in March 2012 (and recertified in 2017) and is operated under Australian jurisdiction in a manner consistent with CCAMLR regulations. Two Australian companies operate four vessels - Austral Fisheries and Australian Longline.

The Macquarie Island toothfish fishery is within the Australian EEZ and is situated outside the CCAMLR Convention Area within FAO Statistical Area 81, though it is managed in a complementary way with the conservation measures adopted by CCAMLR. In May 2012, this was the fourth toothfish fishery to gain MSC certification (and recertified in 2017). Two Australian companies are allocated quota in this fishery.

France regulates Patagonian toothfish in the waters surrounding the French islands in the South Indian Ocean, with scientific oversight from the National Museum of Natural History. These fisheries are located around the Kerguelen Islands (CCAMLR Statistical Division 58.5.1) and the Crozet Islands (CCAMLR Statistical Division 58.6). Six fishing companies based out of Reunion Island have been granted authorisations. The Kerguelen Island fishery was certified by the MSC in September 2013 (recertified in 2018) and the Crozet Islands fishery was certified by the MSC in 2017.

The Falkland Islands, a self-governing British Overseas Territory, also has a toothfish fishery and was awarded MSC certification in 2014. The Falklands do not fall in the CCAMLR Convention area, though regulations on fishing methods, science, and management mirror CCAMLR requirements. The Total Allowable Catch (TAC) is caught by a sole longline vessel.

Combined, over 50% of all legally harvested toothfish is independently assessed and certified by the MSC as being from sustainable and well-managed fisheries.

The Chilean toothfish fishery is separated into two separate fleets. The &quot;artisanal fleet&quot; of small boats operates in the region north of 47°S inside the Chilean EEZ, and six vessels from the &quot;industrial fleet&quot; operate south of 47°S inside the Chilean EEZ, as well as on the high seas both within and outside CCAMLR waters. The TAC for the industrial fleet is determined each year by the Chilean government based on biological studies carried out by both public and private, scientific bodies. Since 2006, artisanal fleet catches have fluctuated between 2,091t and 1,558t per annum.

The Argentine Federal Fisheries Council manages Argentina&#x27;s toothfish fishery off its coastline under recommendations from the National Fisheries Research Institute. The Argentine TAC is caught by five vessels.

The Prince Edward and Marion Islands toothfish fishery is managed and regulated by Branch Fisheries, part of the South African Minister of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries. The South African Marine Resource Authorities fully supports and follows all CCAMLR conservation measures. The TAC is fished by two vessels belonging to two fishing companies/cooperatives, with catches having been restricted significantly following excessive illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing in those waters in the late 1990s. TACs from this fishery have slowly started to increase as the stock begins to recover.

The global toothfish catch is around 30,000 tonnes, with around 80% of this coming from COLTO members and around half being independently certified as coming from sustainable and well-managed fisheries by the Marine Stewardship Council.

===Illegal fishing===
In the late 1990s to early 2000s, illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing for toothfish nearly collapsed some fisheries in the Southern Ocean. However, since 2005, because of CCAMLR member nations, government patrol vessels, NGOs, media exposure, and trade and port state measures, IUU fishing has been all but eliminated from within countries&#x27; EEZs, and until 2015, a relatively small portion of IUU fishing still occurred in high seas areas. In 2014 and 2015, several major campaigns tried to eliminate IUU fishing for toothfish. This included the Sea Shepherd campaign, &quot;Operation Icefish&quot;, which pursued one of the vessels, the &quot;Thunder&quot;, for 110 days before it was scuttled. Operations by the Royal New Zealand Navy, the Royal Australian Navy, Interpol, and governments of Spain, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia all combined to successfully apprehend, arrest and prosecute all of the remaining 6 IUU vessels fishing illegally for toothfish on the high seas.

At the peak of IUU fishing, illegal catches were estimated to be 32,000 tonnes in 1997, with about 55 vessels believed to be active. By 2010, IUU catches had fallen to an estimated 1,615 tonnes, all taken in high-seas areas, with just four IUU fishing vessels reported to be active. This decreased IUU fishing by over 95% since the mid-1990s. CCAMLR estimated in 2012 that 90% of IUU catches at the time were of Antarctic toothfish, not Patagonian toothfish.

CCAMLR annually reviews information on IUU fishing activities in the convention area and has established a contracting party and a noncontracting party IUU vessel list (CCAMLR Conservation Measure 10-06 and Conservation Measure 10–07). Vessels included on the IUU lists have engaged in IUU activities in the convention area and undermined the effectiveness of conservation measures, thereby threatening toothfish stocks, marine habitats, and bycatch species. Vessels are included on the IUU vessel lists after a consensus decision based on set criteria from the commission. This measure, combined with additional surveillance by member nations&#x27; catch documentation schemes, has played a significant part in the reduction of IUU fishing for toothfish.

In the past, France sold some fishing rights to Japanese and other foreign fisheries, but because of IUU fishing, rights are now reserved for French fishers based at Réunion Island. Because of the previous poaching, the French Navy and Australian Customs vessels still work in concert, patrolling both French and Australian EEZs, having made numerous arrests and seizures in the late 1990s to early 2000s. An Australian Customs vessel, the &quot;Southern Supporter&quot;, was involved in the renowned chase and apprehension of an IUU vessel in the 2003 &quot;Viarsa&quot; incident that stretched over 7,200 km.

TACs for legal operators in CCAMLR are set, taking into account the estimated IUU catches from past years and any IUU activity that may be occurring in the different fisheries. In some fisheries, this has meant a considerable reduction in legal catches – an example of this is the Australian Heard Island and McDonald Islands fishery, where the legal TAC was 3,800 t in 1996/97. This was dropped to a minimum of 2,427 t by 2006/07, with a substantial portion of that decline attributed to the IUU catches taken from the fishery between 1996 and 2002. Since then, no IUU fishing has occurred in that fishery, and the legal TAC has steadily increased.

In addition to the catch documentation system mentioned above, USA regulations do not allow toothfish imports without valid &quot;Dissostichus&quot; catch documents; dealer permits and preapproval certificates must be issued in advance by NOAA. In addition, toothfish must be caught from vessels equipped with satellite-linked automated VMSs that track vessel movements from port to port to ensure compliance with set quotas and boundaries. All vessel VMS data must be reported to the centralized CCAMLR system, with confirmation to USA required that it has occurred, for any products from those boats to be imported into the United States.

As revealed by the &quot;black spider memos&quot;, Charles, Prince of Wales, was worried about the future for the species. An open reply noted that sea birds had been protected in toothfish fisheries globally and that IUU fishing was virtually eliminated.

The EU has also imposed requirements against IUU fishing that include:
* Only marine fisheries products validated as legal by the relevant flag state or exporting state can be imported or exported from the EU.
* A European blacklist covers IUU vessels and states that turn a blind eye to illegal fishing activities.
* EU operators who fish illegally anywhere in the world, under any flag, face substantial penalties proportionate to the economic value of their catch, which deprive them of any profit.

===Seafood chooser organizations===
Patagonian toothfish is listed by the Monterey Bay Aquarium on its Seafood Watch list and pocket guides. In April 2013, Seafood Watch produced an updated report, indicating new ratings for some fisheries, which allocates about 78% of toothfish caught worldwide, which are:
* Best Choice – Heard Island and McDonald Islands Fishery (Australia), Macquarie Island Fishery (Australia), Falkland Islands Fishery
* Good Alternative – South Georgia Fishery, Kerguelen Islands Fishery (France), Ross Sea Antarctic toothfish Fishery
* Avoid – Prince Edward &amp; Marion Island Fishery (South Africa), Chile, Crozet Islands Fishery (France)
* Not Rated – Argentina

In 2010, Greenpeace International added the Patagonian toothfish to its seafood red list. &quot;The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.&quot; Greenpeace have not updated their rating of toothfish since the 2013 Monterey Bay Aquarium review.

<text>Meritaten, also spelled Merytaten, Meritaton or Meryetaten () (14th century BC), was an ancient Egyptian royal woman of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt. Her name means &quot;She who is beloved of Aten&quot;; Aten being the sun-deity whom her father, Pharaoh Akhenaten, worshipped. She held several titles, performing official roles for her father and becoming the Great Royal Wife to Pharaoh Smenkhkare, who may have been a brother or son of Akhenaten. Meritaten also may have served as pharaoh in her own right under the name Ankhkheperure Neferneferuaten.

==Family==
Meritaten was the first of six daughters born to Pharaoh Akhenaten and his Great Royal Wife, Nefertiti. Her sisters are Meketaten, Ankhesenpaaten, Neferneferuaten Tasherit, Neferneferure, and Setepenre. Meritaten is mentioned in diplomatic letters, by the name &quot;Mayati&quot;. She is mentioned in a letter from Abimilki of Tyre. The reference usually is thought to date to the period when Meritaten&#x27;s position at court became more important, during the latter part of the reign of Akhenaten. It is possible, however, that the letter refers to the birth of Meritaten.

She was married to Akhenaten&#x27;s successor, the Pharaoh Smenkhkare.

Inscriptions mention a young princess named Meritaten Tasherit, who may be the daughter of Meritaten and Smenkhkare. Inscriptions from Ashmunein suggest that Meritaten-tasherit is the daughter of Meritaten. The scene dates to the reign of Akhenaten, and this means the father of the young princess could be Akhenaten. If so, this means Akhenaten took his own daughters as wives. Another princess named Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit had been suggested as an additional daughter of Meritaten, but it is more likely that she is a daughter of Ankhesenpaaten.

==Biography==
===Early years in Thebes===
Meritaten most likely was born in Thebes, early in her father&#x27;s marriage to Nefertiti, perhaps before he assumed the throne, as she is shown officiating during year five of his reign. The royal family first lived in Thebes and the royal palace may have been part of the Temple Complex of Akhenaten at Karnak. The exact use of the buildings in Karnak is not known, but the scenes decorating the Teni-menu suggest it may have served as a residence. Meritaten is depicted beside her mother Nefertiti in reliefs carved into the &quot;Hut-Benben&quot;. The Hut-Benben was a structure associated with Nefertiti, who is the main officiant in the scenes, the great royal wife being the highest priestess. Meritaten appears behind her mother shaking a sistrum. Her younger sisters Meketaten and Ankhesenpaaten also appear in some of the scenes, but not so often as Meritaten.

===Amarna princess===
In year five of her father Akhenaten&#x27;s reign, Meritaten appears on the boundary stelae designating the boundaries of the new capital to which her father moved the royal family and his administrators. During Akhenaten&#x27;s reign, she was the most frequently depicted and mentioned of the six daughters. Her figure appears on paintings in temples, tombs, and private chapels. Not only is she shown among images showing the family life of the pharaoh, which were typical of the Amarna Period, but on those depicting official ceremonies, as well.

The two structures most associated with Meritaten at Amarna are the Northern Palace and the Maru-Aten. The Maru-Aten was located to the south of the city limits of Amarna. The structure consisted of two enclosures containing pools or lakes and pavilions set in an area planted with trees. An artificial island contained a pillared construction that held a painted pavement showing scenes from nature.

Meritaten&#x27;s name seems to replace that of another royal lady in several places, among them in the Northern Palace and in the Maru-Aten. This had been misinterpreted as evidence of Nefertiti&#x27;s disgrace and banishment from the royal court but, more recently, the erased inscriptions turned out to be the name of Kiya, one of Akhenaten&#x27;s secondary wives, disproving that interpretation.
===Great Royal Wife===

At some point, Meritaten married Smenkhkare and became his Great Royal Wife. She is depicted with him in the tomb of Meryre II, bestowing honors and gifts upon Meryre. The chronology of the final years of the Amarna Period is unclear, however Smenkhkare is believed to have served as a co-regent to Akhenaten. Meritaten was the Great Royal Wife to Smenkhkare, while Nefertiti continued as the Great Royal Wife of Akhenaten. Nefertiti still held the Great Royal Wife title in year 16, hence Smenkhkare must have been a co-regent at that time, or otherwise ruled with his wife Meritaten sometime after year 16 of Akhenaten.

Meritaten is mentioned on gold daisies that decorated a garment found in Tutankhamen&#x27;s tomb. She also is mentioned on a wooden box meant to contain linen garments. The box mentions two kings: Neferkheperure-Waenre (Akhenaten) and Ankhkheperure-mr-waenre, Neferneferuaten-mr-waenre and the Great Royal Wife Meritaten.

According to some scholars, such as J.P. Allen, Ankhkheperure Smenkhkare ruled together with Meritaten, but in the year following Akhenaten&#x27;s death, Smenkhkare died. The theory is, that Meritaten was the &#x27;king&#x27;s daughter&#x27; Akenkeres who is recorded in Manetho&#x27;s Epitome to have assumed the throne next, in her own right as king and bearing the name Neferneferuaten. Neferneferuaten is assigned a reign of two years and one month and is placed in Manetho&#x27;s account as the immediate predecessor of the king, &quot;Rathothis&quot;, who is believed to be Tutankhamun, her half-brother by another, unnamed wife of Akhenaten.

Archaeologist Alain Zivie asserts that Meritaten also became a foster mother to Tutankhamun, referred to as Maia in some ancient records. Zivie noted that Thutmose, the sculptor appointed vizier by Akhenaten and who was found to be the creator of the famous bust of Nefertiti also created one of Maïa (Bubasteion I.20), the foster mother of Tutankhamun and who, in fact, was &quot;Merytaten, the elder daughter of Akhenaten&quot;, &quot;who sat briefly on the throne&quot;.

==Death and burial==

The texts of a boundary stele mention that Meritaten was meant to be buried at Akhet-Aten (modern Amarna).
Let a tomb be made for me in the eastern mountain of Akhetaten. Let my burial be made in it, in the millions of jubilees which the Aten, my father, has decreed for me. Let the burial of the Great King&#x27;s Wife, Nefertiti, be made in it, in the millions of years which the Aten, my father, decreed for her. Let the burial of the King&#x27;s Daughter, Meritaten, [be made] in it, in these millions of years.

The royal tomb in Amarna was used for the burial of Meketaten, Tiye, and Akhenaten, and likely was closed after the death and burial of Akhenaten. After that, Meritaten&#x27;s burial may have been planned for one of the other royal tombs in Amarna.

<text>Alexius Meinong [[Ritter]] von Handschuchsheim (; 17 July 1853 – 27 November 1920) was an Austrian philosopher, a realist known for his unique ontology and theory of objects. He also made contributions to philosophy of mind and theory of value.
==Life==
Alexius Meinong&#x27;s father was officer Anton von Meinong (1799–1870), who was granted the hereditary title of Ritter in 1851 and reached the rank of Major General in 1858 before retiring in 1859.

From 1868 to 1870, Meinong studied at the Akademisches Gymnasium, Vienna. In 1870, he entered the University of Vienna law school where he was drawn to Carl Menger&#x27;s lectures on economics. In summer 1874, he earned a doctorate in history by writing a thesis on Arnold of Brescia. It was during the winter term (1874–1875) that he began to focus on history and philosophy. Meinong became a pupil of Franz Brentano, who was then a recent addition to the philosophical faculty. Meinong would later claim that his mentor did not directly influence his shift into philosophy, though he did acknowledge that during that time Brentano may have helped him improve his progress in philosophy. Meinong studied under Brentano with Edmund Husserl, who would also become a notable and influential philosopher. Both their works exhibited parallel developments, particularly from 1891 to 1904. Both are recognized for their respective contribution to philosophical research.

In 1882, Meinong became a professor at the University of Graz and was later promoted as chair of its philosophy department. During his tenure, he founded the Graz Psychological Institute (Grazer Psychologische Institut; founded in 1894) and the Graz School of experimental psychology. Meinong supervised the doctorates of Christian von Ehrenfels (founder of &quot;Gestalt&quot; psychology) and Adalbert Meingast, as well as the habilitation of Alois Höfler and Anton Oelzelt-Newin.

==Work==
===Ontology===

Meinong wrote two early essays on David Hume, the first dealing with his theory of abstraction, the second with his theory of relations, and was relatively strongly influenced by British empiricism. He is most noted, however, for his edited book &quot;Theory of Objects&quot; (full title: &quot;Investigations in Theory of Objects and Psychology&quot;, , 1904), which grew out of his work on intentionality and his belief in the possibility of intending nonexistent objects. Whatever can be the target of a mental act, Meinong calls an &quot;object.&quot;

His theory of objects, now known as &quot;Meinongian object theory,&quot; is based around the purported empirical observation that it is possible to think about something, such as a golden mountain, even though that object does not exist. Since we can refer to such things, they must have some sort of being. Meinong thus distinguishes the &quot;being&quot; of a thing, in virtue of which it may be an object of thought, from a thing&#x27;s &quot;existence&quot;, which is the substantive ontological status ascribed to—for example—horses but not to unicorns. Meinong called such nonexistent objects &quot;homeless&quot;; others have nicknamed their place of residence &quot;Meinong&#x27;s jungle&quot; because of their great number and exotic nature.

Historically, Meinong has been treated, especially by Gilbert Ryle, as an eccentric whose theory of objects was allegedly dealt a severe blow in Bertrand Russell&#x27;s essay &quot;On Denoting&quot; (1905) (see Russellian view). However, Russell himself thought highly of the vast majority of Meinong&#x27;s work and, until formulating his theory of descriptions, held similar views about nonexistent objects. Further, recent Meinongians such as Terence Parsons and Roderick Chisholm have established the consistency of a Meinongian theory of objects, while others (e.g., Karel Lambert) have defended the uselessness of such a theory.

Meinong is also seen to be controversial in the field of philosophy of language for holding the view that &quot;existence&quot; is merely a property of an object, just as color or mass might be a property. Closer readers of his work, however, accept that Meinong held the view that objects are &quot;indifferent to being&quot; and that they stand &quot;beyond being and non-being&quot;. On this view Meinong is expressly denying that existence is a property of an object. For Meinong, what an object is, its real essence, depends on the properties of the object. These properties are genuinely possessed whether the object exists or not, and so existence cannot be a mere property of an object.

===Types of objects===
Meinong holds that objects can be divided into three categories on the basis of their ontological status. Objects may have one of the following three modalities of being and non-being:
* Existence (&quot;Existenz&quot;, verb: &quot;existieren&quot;), or actual reality (&quot;Wirklichkeit&quot;), which denotes the material and temporal being of an object
* Subsistence (&quot;Bestand&quot;, verb: &quot;bestehen&quot;), which denotes the being of an object in a non-temporal sense.
* Absistence or being-given (&quot;Gegebenheit&quot;, as in the German use &quot;es gibt&quot;, i.e. &quot;there are&quot;, &quot;it is given&quot;), which denotes being an object but not having being.

Certain objects can exist (mountains, birds, etc.); others cannot in principle ever exist, such as the objects of mathematics (numbers, theorems, etc.): such objects simply subsist. Finally, a third class of objects cannot even subsist, such as impossible objects (e.g. square circle, wooden iron, etc.). Being-given is not a minimal mode of being, because it is not a mode of being at all. Rather, to be &quot;given&quot; is just to be an object. Being-given, termed &quot;absistence&quot; by J. N. Findlay, is better thought of as a mode of non-being than as a mode of being. Absistence, unlike existence and subsistence, does not have a negation; everything absists. (Note that all objects absist, while some subset of these subsist, of which a yet-smaller subset exist.) The result that everything absists allows Meinong to deal with our ability to affirm the non-being (&quot;Nichtsein&quot;) of an object. Its absistence is evidenced by our act of intending it, which is logically prior to our denying that it has being.

===Object and subject===
Meinong distinguishes four classes of &quot;objects&quot;:
* Object (&quot;Objekt&quot;), which can be real (like horses) or ideal (like the concepts of difference, identity, etc.)
* Objective (&quot;Objectiv&quot;), e.g. the affirmation of the being (&quot;Sein&quot;) or non-being (&quot;Nichtsein&quot;), of a being-such (&quot;Sosein&quot;), or a being-with (&quot;Mitsein&quot;), of an object—parallel to existential, categorical and hypothetical judgements. Objectives are close to what contemporary philosophers call states of affairs (where these may be actual—may &quot;obtain&quot;—or not)
* Dignitative, e.g. the true, the good, the beautiful
* Desiderative, e.g. duties, ends, etc.

To these four classes of objects correspond four classes of psychological acts:
* (Re)presentation (&quot;das Vorstellen&quot;), for objects
* Thought (&quot;das Denken&quot;), for the objectives
* Feeling (&quot;das Fühlen&quot;), for dignitatives
* Desire (&quot;das Begehren&quot;), for the desideratives

<doc id="404433" wikidata="Q1661152" url="?curid=404433" title="Indestructible (Rancid album)">
<text>Indestructible is the sixth studio album by the American punk rock band Rancid. It was produced by Brett Gurewitz (Bad Religion) and released by Hellcat Records with distribution through Warner Bros. Records on August 19, 2003. Despite critical acclaim, the band was criticized by some of its fans for &quot;Indestructible&quot;&#x27;s &quot;poppier&quot; sound on some of its tracks. It debuted at number 15 on the charts, selling 51,000 copies in its first week. It was Rancid&#x27;s highest debut at the time, which was surpassed six years later with their 2009 album, &quot;Let the Dominoes Fall&quot;. &quot;Indestructible&quot; marks the last recording by drummer Brett Reed, who left the band in 2006 and was replaced by current drummer Branden Steineckert (formerly of The Used). Additionally, it is the only album that features songwriting contributions from Reed.

==Writing and production==

Production of the album began with following a US tour with NOFX in April and concluded in November 2002. &quot;Indestructible&quot; was described as the band&#x27;s most personal album, covering personal issues including Tim Armstrong&#x27;s divorce from ex-wife Brody Dalle on songs such as &quot;Fall Back Down&quot;, &quot;Ghost Band&quot; and &quot;Tropical London&quot;. The album&#x27;s final track, &quot;Otherside&quot;, was written by Lars Frederiksen and dedicated to his brother Robert, who died in 2001. The album was also dedicated two of band&#x27;s mentors and influences: Joe Strummer and Joey Ramone, who both died during the making of the album. Strummer is mentioned in the album&#x27;s title track.

Post production of the album consisted of cutting the record down from 25 tracks to 19 tracks. The six tracks left off of the final album were &quot;Killing Zone&quot;, &quot;Stranded&quot;, &quot;Trouble&quot;, &quot;Road to Hell&quot;, &quot;Warfare&quot;, and &quot;Squatter House&quot;.&quot; Killing Zone&quot; and &quot;Stranded&quot; were used as b-sides and bonus tracks for the record. &quot;Trouble&quot; was reworked and released as a single on Pink&#x27;s third album &quot;Try This&quot;. That version of the song won Tim Armstrong and Pink a Grammy. &quot;Road to Hell&quot; was re-recorded and a Japanese bonus track on the 2nd Lars Frederiksen And The Bastards album &quot;Viking&quot;. &quot;Warfare&quot; and &quot;Squatter House&quot; remain unreleased.

==Release==
On June 6, 2003, the album&#x27;s track listing was posted online. From June to August 2003, the group went on the 2003 edition of Warped Tour. On July 24, &quot;Indestructible&quot;, &quot;Back Against the Wall&quot;, and &quot;Red Hot Moon&quot; were posted on the band&#x27;s website. &quot;Fall Back Down&quot; was released to radio on July 22, 2003. A music video for the song was posted on Yahoo! Launch on August 4, 2003.

The album was delayed a number of times before its official release. It was first scheduled for release in summer/fall 2002 beforing being delayed to early 2003, mid, and finally August 19, 2003. Chief among the reasons for the album&#x27;s delay were band members&#x27; other commitments. Singer/guitarist Tim Armstrong released an album with his then-new side project Transplants and second guitarist Lars Frederiksen released an album with Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards. Warner Bros. Records released the CD version while LP was released by Epitaph. In August and September, the band toured Europe, a few shows of which were as part of the Reconstruction Festival. On September 30, they appeared on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. They then embarked on a headlining US tour in November, with Tiger Army; Nekromantix, the Frisk, and Roger Miret and the Disasters appeared on select dates. In February 2003, Rancid toured across Japan. &quot;Red Hot Moon&quot; was released to radio on October 28, 2003; a music video for the song was released to days later, and was filmed at CBGBs in New York City. In December, the band went on the Hellcat Tour with Tiger Army and F-Minus. Tim Shaw of Ensign sang Skinhead Rob&#x27;s section of &quot;Red Hot Moon&quot; during the tour. Later in the month, the band performed at the KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas festival. &quot;Tropical London&quot; was released as a promotional single to radio on April 27, 2004. A music video was released for &quot;Spirit of &#x27;87&quot; however it was not released as a single.

Following the release of the album, the group went on hiatus while each of the members toured and recorded albums with other bands.

==Reception==

Prior to the album&#x27;s release the band signed a special distribution deal with Warner Bros. Records, which was met with major backlash from many of the band&#x27;s fans for abandoning their independent roots. To ease tension among the fans, the album was released with no mention of Warner Bros. on the album packaging. According to a label spokesman &quot;It&#x27;s a unique deal that doesn&#x27;t play by the traditional record biz rules. It&#x27;s Rancid putting out an album on Hellcat, with the possibility of additional support from [Warner Bros.].&quot; In a statement, Lars Frederiksen discussed the Warner Bros. deal by saying &quot;We have absolutely no complaints with Hellcat. Yes, we are considering additional support that Warner Bros. might be able to provide, but whatever happens, we&#x27;re sticking with Brett Gurewitz. All I care about and all I have is my music, my bandmates and my band. We are going to do whatever we need to do to survive.&quot;

The album was with mostly positive critical reviews, reaching #15 on the charts and making it the band&#x27;s biggest debut at the time. However, some fans criticized the album for its stylistic departure from earlier work, claiming that a major label had influenced the band&#x27;s music to appeal to mainstream listeners (despite the album being written prior to the band&#x27;s agreement with the label). Still others felt the album to be a mixture of &quot;...And Out Come the Wolves&quot; and &quot;Life Won&#x27;t Wait&quot;. The album&#x27;s first single &quot;Fall Back Down&quot;, a song written about Armstrong&#x27;s divorce and reliance on his close friends, was also met with some backlash from fans for featuring members of Good Charlotte and Kelly Osbourne in its music video.

Brody Dalle has never listened to the album. &quot;I had no desire to listen to [Tim&#x27;s] record [at the time it came out]. Someone said there was a song called &quot;Tropic London&quot;, which was maybe about me and Melbourne. I still haven&#x27;t heard it.&quot;

<text>The Battles of Narvik were fought from 9 April to 8 June 1940, as a naval battle in Ofotfjord and as a land battle in the mountains surrounding the north Norwegian town of Narvik, as part of the Norwegian Campaign of the Second World War.

The two naval battles in Ofotfjord on 10 April and 13 April were fought between the British Royal Navy and the German &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, while the two-month land campaign was fought by Norwegian, French, British, and Polish troops against German mountain troops, shipwrecked &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; sailors, and German paratroopers (&quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot;) from the 7th Air Division. Although defeated at sea off Narvik, losing control of the town of Narvik and being pushed back towards the Swedish border, the Germans eventually prevailed because of the Allied evacuation from Norway in June 1940 following the Battle of France.

Narvik provided an ice-free harbour in the North Atlantic for iron ore transported by rail from Kiruna in Sweden. Both sides in the war had an interest in securing this iron supply for themselves and denying it to the enemy, thereby setting the stage for one of the biggest battles since the Invasion of Poland.

Prior to the German invasion, British forces had considered Narvik as a possible landing point for an expedition to help Finland in the Winter War. Such an expedition also had the potential of taking control of the Swedish mines and opening up the Baltic for the Allies.

==German invasion==
On 1 March 1940, Adolf Hitler ordered the invasion of Norway, codenamed &quot;Operation Weserübung&quot; as a preventive manoeuvre against a planned, and openly discussed, Franco-British occupation of Norway. This operation would involve most of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. Participating units were divided into five groups, which were to occupy six of the main Norwegian ports.

Group I departed Bremerhaven on 6 April. It consisted of 10 German destroyers of the 1934A and 1936 classes &quot;Georg Thiele&quot;, &quot;Wolfgang Zenker&quot;, &quot;Bernd von Arnim&quot;, &quot;Erich Giese&quot;, &quot;Erich Koellner&quot;, &quot;Diether von Roeder&quot;, &quot;Hans Lüdemann&quot;, &quot;Hermann Künne&quot;, &quot;Wilhelm Heidkamp&quot; (flagship) and &quot;Anton Schmitt&quot;, commanded by &quot;Kommodore&quot; Friedrich Bonte. Each of the warships carried around 200 soldiers (a total of 1,900 mountain troops (&quot;Gebirgsjäger&quot;) from the 139th Mountain Regiment (&quot;Gebirgsjägerregiment&quot;) of the 3rd Mountain Division commanded by General Eduard Dietl). The troop-carrying destroyers were escorted most of the way by the battleships and .

In the early morning of 9 April, the destroyers of Group I passed the Vestfjorden and arrived at the Ofotfjorden leading to Narvik, in fog and heavy snow. In Ofotfjord, they captured three Norwegian patrol boats (&quot;Senja&quot;, &quot;Michael Sars&quot; and &quot;Kelt&quot;). Before capture &quot;Kelt&quot; managed to send a message to the coastal defence ship HNoMS &quot;Norge&quot;, alerting the local Norwegian naval commander of the incoming vessels. The German ships &quot;Wolfgang Zenker&quot;, &quot;Erich Koellner&quot; and &quot;Hermann Künne&quot; landed their soldiers in Herjangsfjord (a northern branch of Ofotfjorden) in order to capture a Norwegian regimental supply base at Elvegårdsmoen. &quot;Hans Ludemann&quot; and &quot;Hermann Künne&quot; also landed their troops in order to engage the nearby Norwegian forts (which turned out to be non-existent). &quot;Diether von Roeder&quot; remained in Ofotfjord in order to ensure German control of the sea. &quot;Erich Giese&quot; was delayed by engine trouble and did not join the main force for some time.

The main defence of Narvik were the old coastal defence ships &quot;Eidsvold&quot; and her sister ship &quot;Norge&quot;. Having been alerted by &quot;Kelt&quot;, both Norwegian ships prepared for combat: the guns were loaded and life preservers issued to the crew. Around 04:15, the Germans spotted &quot;Eidsvold&quot;, and &quot;Eidsvold&quot; immediately signalled the leading German destroyer with an aldis lamp. When the Germans failed to respond to the signal, a warning shot was fired across their bow.

The Germans had orders to occupy Norway peacefully if at all possible, so the German flagship &quot;Wilhelm Heidkamp&quot; stopped and signalled that it would send an officer to negotiate. A small launch ferried &quot;Korvettenkapitän&quot; Gerlach over to &quot;Eidsvold&quot;. Gerlach was taken to the bridge to speak to Captain Odd Isaachsen Willoch.

Gerlach tried to convince Willoch that the Germans had arrived as friends, but that the Norwegians had to hand over their warships to the German armed forces. Captain Willoch asked for time to consult his commander, Captain Per Askim, the commander of &quot;Norge&quot;. This request was refused by the Germans, but while Willoch had been talking to the German officer, the radio officer on board &quot;Eidsvold&quot; had communicated the events to Askim. Askim&#x27;s response to the German demands and order to Willoch came immediately; Willoch and &quot;Eidsvold&quot; was to open fire. Willoch responded to Askim; &quot;I am attacking.&quot; While this was going on, the German destroyer &quot;Wilhelm Heidkamp&quot; had positioned herself off the port side of &quot;Eidsvold&quot; and trained her torpedo launchers on the Norwegian ship.

Gerlach tried once again to convince Willoch to surrender, but Willoch refused. As Gerlach left &quot;Eidsvold&quot;, he fired a red flare, indicating that the Norwegians intended to fight. At this point, Captain Willoch shouted: (&quot;Man the guns. We&#x27;re going to fight, boys!&quot;). &quot;Eidsvold&quot; turned towards the closest destroyer and accelerated, closing the distance to &quot;Wilhelm Heidkamp&quot; to while the battery commander ordered the port battery (three guns) to open fire.

The Germans, afraid that &quot;Eidsvold&quot; might ram the destroyer, fired four torpedoes from &quot;Wilhelm Heidkamp&quot; at the old ship. Two of the torpedoes hit before the port guns could fire. The Norwegian ammunition magazine was ignited and &quot;Eidsvold&quot; was blown in two. The forward part of the ship sank in seconds, the stern followed in minutes, propellers still turning. At around 04:37, she was gone. 175 Norwegian sailors died in the freezing water, including Captain Willoch, with just eight surviving.

Deeper inside the fjord, the explosions were heard aboard &quot;Norge&quot;, but nothing could be seen until two German destroyers suddenly appeared out of the darkness and Captain Per Askim of &quot;Norge&quot; gave orders to open fire at 04:45. Four rounds were fired from the guns (one from the fore gun and three from the aft) as well as seven or eight rounds from the starboard guns, against the German destroyer &quot;Bernd von Arnim&quot;, at a range of about . Due to the difficult weather conditions, the guns&#x27; optical sights were ineffective: the first salvo fell short of the target and the next ones overshot it.

The German destroyers waited until they were alongside the pier before returning fire. &quot;Bernd von Armin&quot; opened fire with her guns as well as with machine guns, but the weather gave the Germans problems as well. The destroyer also fired three salvoes of two torpedoes each. The first two salvoes missed, but the last struck &quot;Norge&quot; midships and she sank in less than one minute. Ninety of the crew were rescued, but 101 perished in the battle which had lasted less than 20 minutes. The destruction of &quot;Norge&quot; signalled the end of Norwegian resistance in the port.

Much of the Norwegian garrison at Narvik awoke to the sound of gunfire and were unprepared to face the Germans. Many were surrounded and disarmed as they scrambled to occupy defensive positions. The commander-in-chief of the Narvik area, Colonel Konrad Sundlo, is often cited as the reason for the quick capitulation. Described by Kriegsmarine Admiral Erich Raeder as &quot;an officer with reportedly pro-German feelings&quot;, he quickly withdrew from the area following the naval engagement and began negotiations with the Germans. After the initial loss of Narvik, Norwegian general Carl Gustav Fleischer sent out a communiqué, part of which read:

Sundlo was charged with treason for the surrender of Narvik after the war, but these charges were dismissed. Instead he was found guilty of negligence for failing to adequately prepare for Narvik&#x27;s defence, and on charges of cooperating with the Germans during the occupation.

The morning of the German attack four Norwegian steamers were anchored in Narvik; the &quot;Cate B&quot;, the &quot;Eldrid&quot;, the &quot;Haalegg&quot; and the &quot;Saphir&quot;. In addition to the Norwegian vessels, four foreign, neutral ships were present; the Dutch steamer &quot;Bernisse&quot;, and the three Swedish steamships &quot;Boden&quot; (), &quot;Oxelösund&quot; () and &quot;Strassa&quot; (). As well as neutral ships, the warring parties had vessels at Narvik, riding anchor in the same port. The British had five steamers in the harbour; the &quot;Blythmoor&quot;, the &quot;Mersington Court&quot;, the &quot;North Cornwall&quot;, the &quot;Riverton&quot;, and the &quot;Romanby&quot;. As the German flotilla seized Narvik, there were 11 German merchant steamers at the port town; the &quot;Aachen&quot;, the &quot;Altona&quot;, the &quot;Bockenheim&quot;, the &quot;Hein Hoyer&quot;, the &quot;Martha Henrich Fisser&quot;, the &quot;Neuenfels&quot;, the &quot;Odin&quot;, the &quot;Lippe&quot;, the &quot;Frielinghaus&quot;, the &quot;Planet&quot;, and the replenishment oiler/maintenance ship . &quot;Jan Wellem&quot;, a converted former whale factory ship, awaited the arrival of the German warships, which she was tasked to refuel. Working in the harbour were the Swedish tugs &quot;Diana&quot; () and &quot;Styrbjörn&quot; (). As the German destroyers entered the harbour, the captain of &quot;Bockenheim&quot;, who assumed that the intruding warships were British, beached and scuttled his vessel. In total, 25 ore ships had been riding at anchor in Narvik at the outset of the fighting, 10 of which were German.

The German destroyers were now short of fuel and had only one fuel tanker in support, the ex-whale factory ship &quot;Jan Wellem&quot; that had been despatched to Narvik, according to some sources from the secret German naval base Basis Nord at Zapadnaya Litsa in the Soviet Union, where she had been based since 4 February 1940. Another source indicates that she departed Murmansk in the evening of the 6 April and that Basis Nord was never even established. She had arrived off Narvik from the north on 8 April, and had been stopped by the Norwegian patrol boat &quot;Kvitøy&quot;. &quot;Jan Wellem&quot; was allowed entry to Narvik by the regional Norwegian naval command, where she was inspected. Her captain claimed that she was carrying of fuel oil and 8,098 crates of food provisions and that she was on her way to Germany. A second tanker, the &quot;Kattegat&quot; which had sailed to Norway from Wilhelmshaven, had been sunk in the Glomfjord in the evening of 9 April. &quot;Kattegat&quot; had been stopped by the Norwegian fishery protection ship HNoMS &quot;Nordkapp&quot;, the Norwegian ship first trying to take the tanker as a prize, but due to the large German crew could not control it all the way to Bodø, in the end sinking &quot;Kattegat&quot; by firing four rounds into the tanker&#x27;s water line.

&quot;Kattegat&quot; had been delayed from reaching Narvik in time by the British 8 April mining operations off Norway (Operation Wilfred). A third tanker—&quot;Skagerrak&quot;—had also been despatched to Norway, in support of the German landings at Trondheim, but she was intercepted by the British cruiser , on 14 April, after she had been redirected by German naval command to a waiting position at sea. When the British warship tried to board &quot;Skagerrak&quot; her crew scuttled her at . Both &quot;Kattegat&quot; and &quot;Skagerrak&quot;, which were sister ships, were inspected at Kopervik by the Norwegian torpedo boat , on 5 and 7 April respectively. The captain of &quot;Kattegat&quot; told the Norwegians that he was headed to Narvik for further orders, and the captain of &quot;Skagerrak&quot; claimed Murmansk as their destination, and inspections revealed that both tankers had a full load of fuel oil. &quot;Skagerrak&quot; also carried of food provisions, which was claimed as supplies for German merchant ships. The food crates were labelled &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. According to the German plan the destroyers were supposed to have been refuelled by two tankers, &quot;Kattegat&quot; and &quot;Jan Wellem&quot;, each receiving some of fuel oil.

The flotilla was then to be on its way back to Germany by the evening of 9 April. The plan failed because only &quot;Jan Wellem&quot; made it to Narvik. Refuelling with just one tanker was difficult; only two destroyers could be refuelled simultaneously, taking seven or eight hours. At arrival in Narvik, the destroyers were almost out of fuel. Making the refuelling more challenging was the fact that &quot;Jan Wellem&quot; had only improvised refuelling arrangements and inferior pumping equipment. While two destroyers were being refuelled at a time, a third was on guard in fjord, the remaining seven being spread around in the nearby area. By 04:00 on 10 April, &quot;Jan Wellem&quot; had managed to fully refuel three of the German destroyers, and was in the process of refuelling two more.

In the meantime, British forces had tried to engage the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, but for the most part, unsuccessfully. On 8 April, the British G-class destroyer engaged the heavy cruiser and two destroyers, and was lost, ramming and damaging &quot;Hipper&quot; in the battle. On the 9 April morning, the British battlecruiser exchanged artillery salvos with the German battleships &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, which were screening the destroyers. During the battle one of the artillery shells from &quot;Renown&quot; damaged the fire control system on &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, the British battlecruiser was also hit two times and slightly damaged. After that the German battleships withdrew from the battle at high speed. The destroyers&#x27; main mission had been completed, however, as they had succeeded in landing the invasion force.

==First naval Battle of Narvik==
The day after the German invasion, the Royal Navy took an opportunity to defeat the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. The 2nd Destroyer Flotilla—under Commodore Bernard Warburton-Lee and comprising five H-class destroyers ( (leader), , , and —moved up the fjord in the early morning. The German destroyers &quot;Hermann Künne&quot; and &quot;Hans Lüdemann&quot; were anchored alongside the tanker &quot;Jan Wellem&quot; and refuelling when the British destroyer attack began at 04:30. The German picket ship (&quot;Diether von Roeder&quot;) had left its post to refuel, and as the British flotilla approached Narvik, they surprised and engaged a German force at the entrance to the harbour and sank the two destroyers &quot;Wilhelm Heidkamp&quot; (killing Commodore Bonte) and &quot;Anton Schmitt&quot;, heavily damaged &quot;Diether von Roeder&quot; and inflicted lesser damage on two others. They also exchanged fire with German invasion troops ashore but did not have a landing force aboard and therefore turned to leave. Before the destroyers left the scene, &quot;Hostile&quot; fired her torpedoes at the merchant ships in the harbour. In total, eleven merchant ships (six German, one British, two Swedish and two Norwegian) were sunk during the British sortie into the harbour.

The British flotilla was then engaged by three more German destroyers (&quot;Wolfgang Zenker&quot;, &quot;Erich Koellner&quot; and &quot;Erich Giese&quot;) emerging from the Herjangsfjord, led by Commander Erich Bey and then two more (&quot;Georg Thiele&quot; and &quot;Bernd von Arnim&quot;) coming from Ballangen Bay, under Commander Fritz Berger. In the ensuing battle, two British destroyers were lost: the flotilla leader HMS &quot;Hardy&quot;, which was beached in flames and HMS &quot;Hunter&quot;, which was torpedoed and sunk. A third—HMS &quot;Hotspur&quot;—was also damaged badly by a torpedo. &quot;Hotspur&quot; and the remaining British destroyers left the battlefield, damaging &quot;Georg Thiele&quot; as they did so. The German destroyers—now short of fuel and ammunition—did not pursue and the British ships were able to sink the ammunition supply ship which they encountered on their way out of the fjord. Soon, the German naval forces were blocked in by British reinforcements, including the cruiser . During the night of 11–12 April, while manoeuvring in Narvik harbour, &quot;Erich Koellner&quot; and &quot;Wolfgang Zenker&quot; ran aground. &quot;Wolfgang Zenker&quot; damaged her propellers and was restricted to a speed of . &quot;Erich Koellner&quot; was much more badly damaged, so the Germans planned—when she was repaired enough to move—to moor her at Tårstad in the same capacity as &quot;Diether von Roeder&quot;, as an immobile defence battery.

As the British destroyers left the Vestfjorden outside Narvik, two German submarines— and —fired torpedoes at them but German torpedoes at the time had severe problems with their magnetic detonator systems—possibly due to the high northern latitude: all of them failed and either did not detonate at all or detonated well before reaching their targets.

Both the German naval commander—&quot;Kommodore&quot; Friedrich Bonte (on &quot;Wilhelm Heidkamp&quot;)—and the British commander—Captain Bernard Warburton-Lee (on &quot;Hardy&quot;)—were killed in the battle. Warburton-Lee was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, Bonte the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross.

==Second naval Battle of Narvik==
The Royal Navy considered it imperative, for morale and strategic purposes, to defeat the Germans in Narvik, so Vice Admiral William Whitworth was sent with the battleship and nine destroyers; four Tribal-class (, , &quot;Punjabi&quot;, and ) and five others (HMS &quot;Kimberley&quot;, , , &quot;Forester&quot; and &quot;Foxhound&quot;), accompanied by aircraft from the aircraft carrier . These forces arrived in the Ofotfjord on 13 April to find that the eight remaining German destroyers—now under the command of &quot;Fregattenkapitän&quot; Erich Bey—were virtually stranded due to lack of fuel and were short of ammunition.

Before the battle, &quot;Warspite&quot; launched her catapult plane (a float-equipped Fairey Swordfish, L 9767), with the crew ordered to search for German ships and to bomb any targets of opportunity. After spotting and reporting several of the German destroyers, the crew spotted the U-boat , anchored just 50 yards off-shore in the Herjangsfjord near Bjerkvik. The Swordfish attacked and dropped two 100 lb anti-submarine bombs: one was a near-miss, but one hit and sank the submarine. Most of the crew survived and were rescued by German mountain troops. This was the first U-boat sunk by an aircraft during the war and the only instance of an aircraft launched from a battleship sinking a U-boat.
In the ensuing battle, three of the German destroyers were sunk by &quot;Warspite&quot; and her escorts and the other five were scuttled by their crews when they ran out of fuel and ammunition. The first lost was &quot;Erich Koellner&quot;, which tried to ambush the Allied forces but was spotted by &quot;Warspite&quot;″s Swordfish and subsequently torpedoed and shelled by the destroyers and battleship. The destroyer&#x27;s commander, Alfred Schulze-Hinrichs, and the surviving members of his crew, were captured by Norwegian forces. Then &quot;Wolfgang Zenker&quot;, &quot;Bernd von Arnim&quot;, &quot;Hans Ludemann&quot; and &quot;Hermann Künne&quot; engaged the British forces but only managed to lightly damage HMS &quot;Bedouin&quot; and &quot;Wolfgang Zenker&quot; tried to torpedo &quot;Warspite&quot;. The British launched a force of ten Swordfish from &quot;Furious&quot; to attack the German destroyers with 250lb bombs. They scored no hits and two aircraft were shot-down; the crew of one were lost, the crew of the other were picked up by &quot;Punjabi&quot; after making a forced-landing on the shore.


Finally, when the German destroyers were low on ammunition, they retreated, except for &quot;Hermann Künne&quot;, which had not received the order. &quot;Hermann Künne&quot; was fired upon by the pursuing HMS &quot;Eskimo&quot;, but she took no hits. Out of ammunition but undamaged, &quot;Hermann Künne&quot; was scuttled by her crew in &quot;Trollvika&quot; in the Herjangsfjord. After scuttling the ship, the crew placed demolition depth charges on the ship, attempting to sink her in Trollvika&#x27;s shallow waters. &quot;Eskimo&quot;, still in hot pursuit, launched a torpedo which hit &quot;Hermann Künne&quot;, setting her on fire. Whether the German ship&#x27;s own depth charges or the torpedo from &quot;Eskimo&quot; was the source of the explosion is unclear. &quot;Eskimo&quot; was in turn ambushed by &quot;Georg Thiele&quot; and &quot;Hans Ludemann&quot;, losing her bow but surviving. &quot;Diether von Roeder&quot; and &quot;Erich Giese&quot;, both suffering engine problems, fired upon the British forces while still docked, damaging &quot;Punjabi&quot; and &quot;Cossack&quot; but they were both sunk before they could cause further damage. That was the last German counter-attack.

Shore batteries and installations were also very badly damaged by &quot;Warspite&quot;″s guns. On the Allied side, the damage to HMS &quot;Eskimo&quot; kept her in Norway until 31 May 1940. German submarines again suffered torpedo failures, when and fired at the departing &quot;Warspite&quot; on 14 April. The remaining German destroyers (&quot;Wolfgang Zenker&quot;, &quot;Georg Thiele&quot;, &quot;Bernd von Arnim&quot; and &quot;Hans Lüdemann&quot;) retreated into Rombaksfjord and were scuttled soon after. The only German ship which survived within the port area was the submarine &quot;U-51&quot;.

The Germans lost over 1,000 men, a U-boat, and eight destroyers. With the losses from the previous battle this constituted 50% of the Kriegsmarine&#x27;s destroyer strength. The shipwrecked crew of &quot;Erich Giese&quot; and several other German destroyers reported that they were fired on during the engagement.

About 2,600 German survivors from the battle were organised into an improvised marine unit, the &quot;Gebirgsmarine&quot;, and fought with the 139th &quot;Gebirgsjäger&quot; Regiment in the subsequent land battle. Although unsuited for combat in the mountainous terrain around Narvik, the shipwrecked sailors manned the two &quot;FlaK&quot; guns and the 11 light anti-aircraft guns salvaged from the ships sunk during the naval battles and conducted defensive operations. The sailors were armed from the stocks captured at the Norwegian army base Elvegårdsmoen, more than 8,000 Krag-Jørgensen rifles and 315 machine guns intended for the mobilisation of Norwegian army units in the Narvik area.

==Later naval operations==
After the naval battles of Narvik, the port and its surroundings remained in German hands, as no Allied forces were available to be landed there. Naval operations were limited at this stage to shore bombardment, as Narvik was not a primary Allied objective.

Among others, the Polish destroyers &quot;Grom&quot;, &quot;Burza&quot; and &quot;Błyskawica&quot; took part in these operations, during which &quot;Grom&quot; was sunk by German aircraft on 4 May 1940, with the loss of 59 sailors.

==Land battle==

During the Norwegian Campaign, Narvik and its surrounding area saw significant fighting, initially from 9 April between German and Norwegian forces, subsequently between Allied and German forces, conducted by the Norwegian 6th Division of the Norwegian Army as well as by an Allied expeditionary corps until 9 June 1940. Unlike the campaign in southern Norway, the Allied troops in Narvik would eventually outnumber the Norwegian troops. Five nations participated in the fighting. From 5–10 May, the fighting in the Narvik area was the only active theatre of land war in the Second World War.

At the outset, the position of the German commander—Dietl—was not good: his 2,000 troops were outnumbered. After the German destroyers had been sunk, however, about 2,600 German sailors joined in the land battle. Another 290 German specialists travelled via Sweden posing as health care workers. During the last three to four weeks, the Germans were also reinforced by about 1,000 men air dropped over Bjørnfjell, thus bringing the total number of Germans to around 5,600. Their position and outlook changed from good to dire several times. On occasions, the entire operation was controlled directly from the German High Command in Berlin; Hitler&#x27;s mood was reportedly swinging heavily and he repeatedly contemplated withdrawal. Intelligence agents captured later in the war also stated that Dietl himself had been considering crossing the Swedish frontier with his troops to be interned, until the German agent Marina Lee infiltrated Auchinleck&#x27;s headquarters at Tromsø and obtained the British battle plan; however, the accuracy of this allegation has been questioned. The Norwegian force—under General Carl Gustav Fleischer—eventually reached 8,000–10,000 men after a few weeks. The total number of Allied troops in the campaign—in and around Narvik—reached 24,500 men.

The early phase of the invasion was marked by the German advantage of surprise. Norwegian troops in northern Norway had been called out on a three-month neutrality watch during the winter of 1939/1940, and so they had trained together. From 9–25 April, the Norwegian forces suffered three catastrophes. First, the forces protecting Narvik were unable to resist the Germans due to the commanding officer—the later NS &quot;Hird&quot; commander Colonel Konrad Sundlo—refusing to fight the invaders; second, around 200 soldiers from the Narvik garrison who had escaped capture and were blocking the railway to Sweden were caught by surprise while resting at Bjørnfjell, most of the men being captured; third, I/IR12 (1st battalion of Infantry Regiment 12) sent to hold Gratangsbotn was attacked by surprise while in camp, suffering casualties that ruined its spirit and effectively knocked it out of the remainder of the campaign.

From Denmark, a battalion-sized detachment of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s Regiment General Göring, commanded by &quot;Hauptmann&quot; Kluge was sent by sea to Oslo, in April, being engaged alongside the Army first in the advance to Trondheim, then north up into the Arctic Circle to take the port of Bodø and relieve the pressure on the beleaguered élite Gebirgsjäger further north at Narvik.

Due to mounting Norwegian pressure and difficulties with bringing up supplies to the forward lying troops, the Germans abandoned Gratangsbotn and withdrew from the hill Lapphaugen and the valley Gratangsdalen, following the Battle of Gratangen. In the beginning of May, the Norwegians started an advance southwards towards Narvik. Once it became clear that the Allies would mount the main invasion of Narvik itself in mid-May, the Norwegian direction altered towards Bjørnfjell. The British arrived first and set up headquarters in Harstad on 14 April. In the following days, three battalions were deployed mainly at Sjøvegan in Skånland Municipality (where a naval base was established) and at Bogen. Later, they were deployed south of the Ofotfjord, at Ballangen and Håkvik.
The initial British detachment was reinforced on 28 April by a French expeditionary force (&quot;Corps expéditionnaire français en Scandinavie&quot;, CEFS), led by General Antoine Béthouart and composed of mountain troops. Three battalions of Alpine troops and two battalions of 13th Demi-Brigade of the Foreign Legion were deployed both north and south of the Ofotfjord, but later, the north would be the main French area of operation. Four Polish battalions arrived on 9 May. They were first deployed north of the Ofotfjord, but later redeployed to the area south of the fjord. In early June they were formed into the Polish Podhale Independent Highland Brigade under General Zygmunt Bohusz-Szyszko and part of CEFS.

In addition, the Allies had difficulty in deciding how best to retake Narvik and the iron ore railway. There was no unified command for the troops facing the Germans at Narvik: the Norwegians and the Allies retained separate commanders and cooperation between them was not always smooth. Even within the British forces, the Army and Navy commanders—Major-General Pierse J. Mackesy and Admiral of the Fleet William Boyle, Lord Cork—had difficulty cooperating: Cork advocated a swift and direct attack from the sea while Mackesy advocated a cautious approach from both sides of the Ofotfjord. Consequent to this, on 21 April, Lord Cork was given supreme command of all Allied forces.
In the second week of May, the Norwegian advances against the Germans east of Gratangseidet were the most significant movements on the Narvik front. In addition, on the Norwegians&#x27; right flank French alpine troops advanced up the Laberg valley, supported by a company of Norwegian ski troops. In the south, the Allies did not have much success, and in the north of the Ofotfjord, they were not making any progress. The Norwegians continued their successful mountain campaign, and in mid-May the Allies took the initiative and achieved significant victories. Both Paris and London had been growing impatient with the slow progress in Narvik, and the French commander—Béthouart—had pressed for more action.

The cautious approach on land was abandoned and an amphibious attack was launched at around midnight on 12 May. This was directed at Bjerkvik and was preceded by a naval bombardment from British warships in Herjangsfjord. Then landing craft put ashore French Foreign Legionnaires, supported by five French Hotchkiss H39 light tanks of the 342e CACC (&quot;Compagnie Autonome de Chars de Combat/&quot; Independent Tank Company), which successfully attacked Bjerkvik, the Elvegårdsmoen army camp and advanced northeast to where the Germans were withdrawing and south along the east side of Herjangsfjord. The plan also required Polish troops to advance toward Bjerkvik from land on the west side of the fjord, but heavy terrain delayed them and they did not arrive before Bjerkvik was taken. It had also been part of the plan for French and Norwegian troops to advance from the north in order to box the Germans in, but cooperation problems between the Norwegian and French commanders left a gap through which the Germans escaped. Despite this, the Allies had a clear path north of Narvik and planned to attack over Rombaksfjord.

It had been anticipated in London that as the buildup of troops in Narvik slowly continued, a corps headquarters would be needed to exercise effective control. On 11 May, Lieutenant-General Claude Auchinleck arrived in Narvik, and on 13 May assumed leadership of the Allied land and air forces (under Lord Cork&#x27;s overall command), which at this time was designated the North-Western Expeditionary Force. It was clear to the Allies that once Narvik was captured, its long-term retention would depend on permanently holding the town of Bodø to the south in Nordland which was on the route of the German advance from Trondheim. Consequently, Auchinleck redeployed all British troops to concentrate on this southern enterprise, and appointed French Brigadier-General Béthouart—an expert in both mountain and winter warfare—to command the French and Polish troops, which would be responsible for operations in the Narvik area in conjunction with Norwegian forces.

Again, the attack was stalled while the Allies waited for air support to be fully established from Bardufoss. At 23:40 on 27 May, a naval bombardment commenced from the north. Two French and one Norwegian battalions would be transported across the Rombaksfjord and advance on Narvik from the north. In the south, the Polish battalions would advance toward Ankenes and inner Beisfjord. The maximum capacity of the landing barges was 290 men, and these troops could not be reinforced for 45 minutes. These first troops were able to get a foothold on Ornes by the time the rest of the French and the Norwegians were landed. The French moved west toward the city and east along the railway. The Norwegians moved toward Taraldsvik mountain, circled around and moved down toward the city. The German commander decided to evacuate before 07:00 and retired along the Beisfjord. This was the first major Allied victory on land.

==Operation Alphabet==

It seemed now that it was only a matter of time before the Germans would have to surrender. They were pushed from the north by the Norwegians, from the west by the French and from the southwest by the Poles. It appeared that Bjørnfjell would be the Germans&#x27; last stand, but events elsewhere in Europe came to their rescue. London had already secretly decided to evacuate on 24 May and that became apparent in the following days. On the night of 24/25 May, Lord Cork received orders to retreat, but under cover so the Germans would be prevented from interfering. The Allied commanders agreed that an attack on Narvik would disguise the retreat and allow the destruction of the iron ore harbour.

The Norwegian government and commanders were first told in early June and the news was met with disbelief and bitterness. The Norwegians still hoped to defeat the Germans alone and, as late as 5 June, one of the two Norwegian brigades was ordered to attack. The Norwegian government also explored the possibility of creating a neutral, but free Northern Norway. This plan proved futile, and on 7 June the King and government were evacuated to Britain. All Allied troops were evacuated from Narvik between 4 and 8 June.

Three Polish passenger ships, MS &quot;Sobieski&quot;, &quot;Batory&quot; and &quot;Chrobry&quot;, took part in the evacuation operation. &quot;Chrobry&quot; was sunk on 14–15 May by German bombers. On 8 June, General Dietl retook Narvik, and on 10 June the last Norwegian forces in Norway surrendered.

==Operation Juno==

On 7 June, the British aircraft carrier had taken on board 10 Gloster Gladiators and eight Hawker Hurricanes from 46 Squadron and 263 Squadron Royal Air Force (RAF). These were flown off from land bases to keep them from being destroyed in the evacuation. &quot;Glorious&quot; left a larger convoy to proceed independently. The next day, while sailing through the Norwegian Sea to return to Scapa Flow, the carrier and her escorts—the destroyers and —were intercepted by the German battlecruisers and . The carrier and her escorts were sunk with the loss of more than 1,500 men. &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was badly damaged by a torpedo from &quot;Acasta&quot; and both German vessels were hit by a number of medium shells. The damage to the German ships was sufficient to cause the Germans to retire to Trondheim, which allowed the safe passage of the evacuation convoy through the area later that day.

==Aftermath==

The British had drafted plans to land in Narvik before the German invasion; troops and supplies had been loaded onto ships when they executed their mining operation on 8 April. These had been hastily unloaded when German ships were spotted northbound because the British thought that the German ships were trying to break into the Atlantic to avoid being trapped in German ports and wanted all their ships available to intercept the German fleet. The confusion dogged the troops for weeks, men and equipment were shipped to Norway separately without clear landing sites and orders were changed while en route. It became apparent that the Allies were confused by the many small and large fjords and bays and could not decide where it would be best to start; British, French and Polish units rapidly relieved each other which added to the lack of local knowledge.

The cold and snow was a common enemy for all troops at Narvik but most of the Allies were poorly prepared for it. The Norwegians were the only ones fully equipped with skis and able to use them. The British tried skis but their troops were largely untrained and supply was scarce. German sailors faced the same problems, even within the &quot;Gebirgsjäger&quot; (mountain troops) and French mountain specialists, only a few units were equipped with skis and the Polish mountain brigade had no mountain training.

Most troops were untested in battle. The &quot;Gebirgsjäger&quot; had participated in the invasion of Poland and some of the troops that had been air dropped over Bjørnfjell had fought in the Netherlands. Some of the French Foreign Legionnaires came directly from fighting in North Africa and most of the Polish officers and many of the soldiers had participated in the defence of Poland, some even in the Spanish Civil War and were highly motivated.

The Allies had sea and air superiority until the very last stage of the operation, but did not take full advantage. The Germans lost the naval battle, but achieved the main goal of their operation: the successful Operation Weserübung and occupation of Norway. Around Narvik, German naval losses were high: they lost 10 destroyers (50 percent of their entire destroyer force), one submarine, and several support ships. In exchange, they sank one aircraft carrier, four Allied destroyers and damaged several others. The reason for their defeat lay in the German plans, which made it impossible for their destroyers to retire quickly, even if they had had adequate supplies. This was compounded by the design of German destroyers: despite their relatively large size and armament, they had inadequate fuel and ammunition storage. The British forces achieved an indisputable local naval victory but were unprepared to follow it up with any land operation. This allowed the Germans to consolidate their foothold in Norway and made the subsequent Allied counter-invasion more difficult.

===Post-war===
In 1964, a war museum opened in Narvik; since 2016, the collections have been displayed in the Narvik War Museum—located inside the Narvik War and Peace Centre.

Parts of the bow of the German destroyer &quot;Georg Thiele&quot; remain visible above the water in &quot;Rombaksbotn&quot; to this day. The wrecks at Narvik remain popular diving spots, although some are off-limits because they still contain undetonated ammunition. Three of the German destroyers were raised in 1964 and moved to Framnesodden, near Eidsvoid, to clear the shipping lane. The destroyers &quot;Anton Schmitt&quot;, &quot;Diether von Roeder&quot;, and &quot;Wilhelm Heidkamp&quot; rest in of water there and were opened for diving. A number of other wrecks are also accessible, but most have been preserved as historic sites and it is forbidden to dive to them.
==Medals==
At least 1,200 French, British, and Polish participants in the battle were awarded the Norwegian War Cross for their contribution to the battle. Among the Norwegians who took part in the battle, only the top two military leaders were awarded the medal. Norwegian media has complained about this limited award.

All German forces (8,577 military personnel) who partook in the battles of Narvik were awarded with the Narvik Shield.

<text>Zend, formerly Zend Technologies, is a Minneapolis, Minnesota-based software company. The company&#x27;s products, which include Zend Studio, assist software developers with developing, deploying, and managing PHP-based web applications.

The company was founded in 1999, and it was acquired in 2019 as part of Perforce&#x27;s acquisition of Zend&#x27;s parent, Rogue Wave Software.

==History==
Zend Technologies was founded by Andi Gutmans and Zeev Suraski who, along with other Israeli graduates of the Technion, the Israel Institute of technology, further developed PHP after its initial creation by Rasmus Lerdorf. The name Zend is a combination of Suraski&#x27;s and Gutmans&#x27; forenames, Zeev and Andi.

In 1997, Gutmans and Suraski rewrote the parser of PHP-FI, originally written by Lerdorf, resulting in PHP 3. In 1998 they redesigned that parser completely and named it the Zend Engine. PHP 4 is based on the first version of the Zend Engine.

In 1999, their company Zend Technologies was formally established and received initial funding from the Israeli venture capital funds Platinum Neurone Ventures and Walden Israel. Business executive Doron Gerstel was recruited to head the company as CEO.

In August 2006 Zend raised $20 million in a Series D funding.

In February 2009, Zend&#x27;s co-founder Andi Gutmans was appointed as CEO, after serving as the company&#x27;s VP of research and development. Zend also recruited Mark Burton, who had served as EVP of worldwide sales at MySQL, as executive chairman.

In October 2015, Louisville, Colorado-based software developer Rogue Wave Software acquired Zend.

Shortly after being acquired, co-founder Andi Gutmans left the company in February 2016.

In January 2019, Rogue Wave Software was acquired by Minneapolis, Minnesota-based application software developer Perforce. In April, Perforce&#x27;s Zend Framework was spun off as a separate project to the Linux Foundation, and was renamed Laminas.

==Products==
Zend branded products are designed to help PHP developers create applications. Products include Zend Server, Zend Studio and Zend Guard, as well as related PHP certification testing.

===Zend Server===
Zend Server is a web application server for running and managing PHP applications. Zend Server comes with built-in application monitoring, application problem diagnostics, caching and optimization capabilities and a Web-based administrator console. Zend Server&#x27;s installers are native to the OS (RPM/DEB/MSI) and include a tested PHP distribution, Zend Framework, out-of-the-box connectivity to all common databases, Java connectivity and a scalable and PHP-integrated download server (for Linux only).

Zend Server includes Z-Ray, a PHP debugging and productivity tool.

The company also develops a Zend Server Community Edition, supporting Linux, Windows, iSeries i5/OS, and Mac OS X, and available as a paid upgrade.

===Zend Studio===
Zend Studio is a commercial, proprietary integrated development environment (IDE) for PHP.

===Zend Guard===
Zend Guard was a tool to protect PHP 4 and 5 source code from being viewed, copied or modified. Development ended in 2016 without support for PHP 7 being added.

===Zend Certification Test===
Zend also provides a PHP Certification Test and certifies people succeeding on the exam as Zend Certified PHP Engineers (ZCE). The company publishes a directory of certified engineers for those passing the test.

==Sponsored projects==
Zend Technologies sponsors various projects to help PHP developers.

===Zend Engine===
Zend Engine is the heart of PHP, originally written by Andi Gutmans and Zeev Suraski. The first version of Zend Engine was shipped with PHP4. Zend sponsors some developers to actively contribute to the engine, while the main development of Zend Engine today comes from contributors to the PHP project.

===Laminas===

Laminas, formerly Zend Framework, is an open-source, object-oriented web application framework written in PHP5 and licensed under the BSD license. It was spun off as a separate project to the Linux Foundation in April 2019. Apigility was Zend&#x27;s API Builder, designed to simplify the creation and maintenance of APIs. It was spun off along with Zend Framework, and was renamed Laminas API Tools.

<text>The Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, also known as Soviet Georgia, the Georgian SSR, or simply Georgia, was one of the republics of the Soviet Union from its second occupation (by the Red Army) in 1921 to its independence in 1991. Coterminous with the present-day republic of Georgia, it was based on the traditional territory of Georgia, which had existed as a series of independent states in the Caucasus prior to the first occupation of annexation in the course of the 19th century. The Georgian SSR was formed in 1921 and subsequently incorporated in the Soviet Union in 1922. Until 1936 it was a part of the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, which existed as a union republic within the USSR. From November 18, 1989, the Georgian SSR declared its sovereignty over Soviet laws. The republic was renamed the Republic of Georgia on November 14, 1990, and subsequently became independent before the dissolution of the Soviet Union on April 9, 1991, whereupon each former SSR became a sovereign state.

Geographically, the Georgian SSR was bordered by Turkey to the south-west and the Black Sea to the west. Within the Soviet Union it bordered the Russian SFSR to the north, the Armenian SSR to the south and the Azerbaijan SSR to the south-east.

==History==

===Establishment===
On November 28, 1917, after the October Revolution in Russia, there was a Transcaucasian Commissariat established in Tiflis. On April 22 the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic was formed, though it only lasted for a month before being replaced by three new states: 
the Georgian Democratic Republic, the First Republic of Armenia and the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. The 1919 parliamentary elections saw the Social Democratic Party come to power in Georgia. It tried to establish a moderate left, multi-party system, but faced some internal and external problems. Georgia was dragged into wars against Armenia and remnants of the Ottoman Empire, while the rapid spread of ideas of revolutionary socialism in rural regions accounted for some Soviet-backed peasants&#x27; revolts in Racha, Samegrelo and Dusheti. In 1921, the crisis came to a head. The 11th Red Army invaded Georgia from the south and headed to Tbilisi. On 25 February, after a one-week offence by the Red Army, Tbilisi fell to the Bolsheviks. Georgian Bolsheviks took over the country and proclaimed the establishment of the Georgian SSR. Some small-scale battles between Bolshevik troops and Georgian Army also took place in Western Georgia. In March 1921 the government of the Georgian Democratic Republic was forced in exile. On March 2 of the following year the first constitution of Soviet Georgia was accepted.

On 13 October 1921 the Treaty of Kars was signed, which established the common borders between Turkey and the three Transcaucasian republics of the Soviet Union. Georgian SSR was forced to cede the Georgian-dominated Artvin Okrug to Turkey in exchange for keeping Adjara, which was granted political autonomy within the Georgian SSR under Soviet rule.

===Transcaucasian Soviet Federated Socialist Republics===
In 1922 the Georgian SSR was incorporated into Soviet Union. From March 12, 1922, to December 5, 1936, it was part of the Transcaucasian SFSR together with the Armenian SSR and the Azerbaijan SSR. During this period the province was led by Lavrentiy Beria, the first secretary of the Georgian Central Committee of the Communist Party of Georgia.
In 1936, the TSFSR was dissolved and Georgia became the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic.

Lavrentiy Beria became head of the Georgian branch of the Joint State Political Directorate (OGPU) and was transferred to Moscow in 1938.

===Purges===

The exact number of Georgians executed during the Great Purges is not estimated, but some scholars suggest it varies from 30,000 to 60,000. During the purges, many eminent Georgian intellectuals such as Mikheil Javakhishvili, Evgeni Mikeladze, Vakhtang Kotetishvili, Paolo Iashvili, Titsian Tabidze and Dimitri Shevardnadze were executed or sent to the Gulag. Party officials also suffered the purges. Many prominent Georgian Bolsheviks, such as Mikheil Kakhiani, Mamia Orakhelashvili, Sergo Ordzhonikidze, Budu Mdivani, Mikheil Okujava and Samson Mamulia were removed from office and killed.

===World War II===

Reaching the Caucasus oilfields was one of the main objectives of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s invasion of the USSR in June 1941, but the armies of the Axis powers never reached as far as Georgia. The country contributed almost 700,000 fighters (350,000 were killed) to the Red Army, and was a vital source of textiles and munitions. During this period Joseph Stalin, an ethnic Georgian, ordered the deportation of the Chechen, German, Ingush, Karachay, Karapapaks, Meskhetian Turks and Balkarian peoples from the Caucasus; they were transported to Siberia and Central Asia for alleged collaboration with the Nazis. He also abolished their respective autonomous republics. The Georgian SSR was briefly granted some of their territory until 1957.

===Post-Stalin period===

On March 9, 1956, about a hundred Georgian students were killed when they demonstrated against Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s policy of de-Stalinization that was accompanied by an offhanded remark he made about Georgians at the end of his anti-Stalin speech.

The decentralisation program introduced by Khrushchev in the mid-1950s was soon exploited by Georgian Communist Party officials to build their own regional power base. A thriving pseudo-capitalist shadow economy emerged alongside the official state-owned economy. While the official growth rate of the economy of the Georgia was among the lowest in the USSR, such indicators as savings level, rates of car and house ownership were the highest in the Union, making Georgia one of the most economically successful Soviet republics. Among all the union republics, Georgia had the highest number of residents with high or special secondary education.

Although corruption was hardly unknown in the Soviet Union, it became so widespread and blatant in Georgia that it came to be an embarrassment to the authorities in Moscow. Eduard Shevardnadze, the country&#x27;s interior minister between 1964 and 1972, gained a reputation as a fighter of corruption and engineered the removal of Vasil Mzhavanadze, the corrupt First Secretary of the Georgian Communist Party. Shevardnadze ascended to the post of First Secretary with the blessings of Moscow. He was an effective and able ruler of Georgia from 1972 to 1985, improving the official economy and dismissing hundreds of corrupt officials.

In the 1970s Soviet authorities adopted a new policy of forming a &quot;Soviet people&quot;. The &quot;Soviet people&quot; were said to be a &quot;new historical, social, and international community of people having a common territory, economy, and socialist content; a culture that reflected the particularities of multiple nationalities; a federal state; and a common ultimate goal: the construction of communism.&quot; Russian was meant to become the common language of this community, considering the role that Russian was playing for the nations and nationalities of the Soviet Union. However, in 1978, Soviet authorities had to face the opposition of thousands of Georgians, who gathered in downtown Tbilisi to hold mass demonstration after Soviet officials accepted removal of the constitutional status of the Georgian language as Georgia&#x27;s sole official state language. Bowing to pressure from mass street demonstrations on April 14, 1978, Moscow approved Shevardnadze&#x27;s reinstatement of the constitutional guarantee the same year. April 14 was established as a Day of the Georgian Language. In 1981, massive celebrations took place in honour of the republic&#x27;s 60th anniversary, with a mass event taking place in front of General Secretary Brezhnev on Tbilisi&#x27;s Constitution Square.

===End of the Soviet period===

Shevardnadze&#x27;s appointment as Soviet Foreign Minister in 1985 brought his replacement in Georgia by Jumber Patiashvili, a conservative and generally ineffective Communist who coped poorly with the challenges of perestroika. Towards the end of the late 1980s, increasingly violent clashes occurred between the Communist authorities, the resurgent Georgian nationalist movement and nationalist movements in Georgia&#x27;s minority-populated regions (notably South Ossetia). On 9 April 1989, Soviet troops were used to break up a peaceful demonstration at the government building in Tbilisi. Twenty Georgians were killed and hundreds wounded. The event radicalised Georgian politics, prompting many—even some Georgian communists—to conclude that independence was preferable to Soviet unity and would provide Georgia with a chance to fully integrate both South Ossetia and Abkhazia, whose peoples were still loyal to the Union.

On October 28, 1990, democratic parliamentary elections were held. On November 14 a transitional period was declared until the restoration of Georgia&#x27;s independence and in this regard, the republic changed its name to &quot;Republic of Georgia&quot;. Georgia (excluding Abkhazia) was one of the six republics along with Armenia, Moldova and the Baltic States who boycotted participation in the March 1991 union-wide preservation referendum. On 31 March 1991, a referendum was held on the restoration of Georgia&#x27;s independence on the basis of the Independence Act of 26 May 1918. The majority of voters voted in favor of the act.

Georgia declared independence on 9 April 1991 under Zviad Gamsakhurdia as one of the republics to secede just four months before the failed coup against Gorbachev in August, which was supported by a declining number of hardliners. However, this was unrecognized by the Soviet government and Georgia remained a part of the Soviet Union until its collapse in December 1991.

<text>The Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, also referred to as the Azerbaijani Soviet Socialist Republic, Azerbaijan SSR, Azerbaijani SSR, AzSSR, Soviet Azerbaijan or simply Azerbaijan, was one of the constituent republics of the Soviet Union between 1922 and 1991. Created on 28 April 1920 when the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic brought pro-Soviet figures to power in the region, the first two years of the Azerbaijani SSR were as an independent country until incorporation into the Transcaucasian SFSR, along with the Armenian SSR and the Georgian SSR.

In December 1922, the Transcaucasian SFSR became part of the newly established Soviet Union. The Constitution of Azerbaijan SSR was approved by the 9th Extraordinary All-Azerbaijani Congress of Soviets on 14 March 1937. On 5 February 1991, Azerbaijan SSR was renamed the Republic of Azerbaijan according to the Decision No.16-XII of Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan approving the Decree of the President of Azerbaijan SSR dated 29 November 1990, remained in the USSR for the period before the declaration of independence in October 1991. The Constitution of the Azerbaijan SSR ceased to exist in 1995, upon the adoption of the new Constitution of Azerbaijan.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Azerbaijan&quot; originates as the &quot;Land of Atropates&quot;, an Achaemenid then Hellenistic-era king over a region in present-day Iranian Azarbaijan and Iranian Kurdistan, south of the modern state. Despite this difference, the present name was chosen by the Musavat to replace the Russian names Transcaucasia and Baku in 1918. &quot;Azerbaijan&quot; derives from Persian &quot;Āzarbāydjān&quot;, from earlier &quot;Ādharbāyagān&quot; and &quot;Ādharbādhagān&quot;, from Middle Persian &quot;Āturpātākān&quot;, from Old Persian &quot;Atropatkan&quot;.

From its founding it was officially known as the &quot;Azerbaijan Socialist Soviet Republic&quot;. When the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic was abolished, the name was changed to the &quot;Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic&quot; according to the 1937 and 1978 Azerbaijan SSR constitutions. Upon independence, it was renamed to the &quot;Republic of Azerbaijan&quot; (or &quot;Azerbaijani Republic&quot;) in 1991. The current official name was retained after the new Constitution of Azerbaijan was adopted in 1995.

== History ==
===Establishment===

The Azerbaijan SSR was established on 28 April 1920 after the surrender of the government of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic to local Bolsheviks led by Mirza Davud Huseynov and Nariman Narimanov and the invasion of the Bolshevik 11th Red Army.

On 13 October 1921, the Soviet republics of Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia signed an agreement with Turkey known as the Treaty of Kars. The previously independent Nakhcivan SSR would also become an autonomous ASSR within Azerbaijan by the Treaty of Kars.

Borders of Azerbaijan and Armenia, like elsewhere in the USSR, were redrawn several times, yet neither side was completely satisfied with the results.

===Transcaucasian SFSR===

On 12 March 1922 the leaders of Azerbaijan, Armenian, and Georgian Soviet Socialist Republics established a union known as the Transcaucasian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic (TSFSR). This was the first attempt at a union of Soviet republics, preceding the USSR. The Union Council of TSFSR consisted of the representatives of the three republics – Nariman Narimanov (Azerbaijan), Polikarp Mdivani (Georgia), and Aleksandr Fyodorovich Miasnikyan (Armenia). The First Secretary of the Transcaucasian Communist Party was Sergo Ordzhonikidze.

In December 1922 TSFSR agreed to join the union with Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, thus creating the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics which would last until 1991. The TSFSR, however, did not last long. In December 1936, the Transcaucasian Union was dismantled when the leaders in the Union Council found themselves unable to come to agreement over several issues. Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia then each became a republic of the Soviet Union directly.

===Economy and development===
In the spring of 1921, a general change-over from revkoms and kombeds to Soviets took place. In order to help the Azerbaijani oil industry the Supreme Council of the National Economy decided in the same year to provide it with everything necessary out of turn. The new oilfields, like Ilyich bay, Qaraçuxur, Lökbatan and Qala have been discovered. By 1929, a significant kolkhoz movement had developed and Azerbaijan became the second Soviet tea producer after the Georgian SSR for the first time. On 31 March 1931, the oil industry of the Azerbaijan SSR, which supplied over 60% of the total Soviet oil production at the time, was awarded the Order of Lenin. The republic gained the second Order on 15 March 1935 during the observation of its 15th anniversary. By the end of the second five-year plan (1933–1937) Azerbaijan had become the 3rd republic in the Soviet Union by its capital investment size.

===World War II===
From 17 September 1939 to 21 June 1941, Nazi Germany, due to its non-aggression pact and relatively normalized trade relations with the USSR, was a major importer of oil produced in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic.

This changed when Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941. In the first year of the Soviet-German War, Azerbaijan produced 23.5 million tons of oil—a record for the entire history of its oil industry. By the end of 1941, thousands of Azerbaijanis had joined the People&#x27;s Volunteer Corps. Mobilization affected all spheres of life, particularly the oil industries. A week after fighting began, the oil workers themselves took the initiative to extend their work to 12-hour shifts, with no days off, including holidays and vacations, until the end of the war. 

In September 1942, Hitler&#x27;s generals presented him with a large decorated cake depicting the Caspian Sea and Baku. Baku then became the primary strategic goal of Hitler&#x27;s 1942 Fall Blau offensive. This offensive was unsuccessful, however. The German army reached the mountains of the Caucasus, but was at the same time decisively defeated at the Battle of Stalingrad and thus forced to retreat from the area, abandoning all hopes for a Reichskommissariat Kaukasien. In 1942, Azerbaijan also became the second-largest tea producer of the Soviet Army. By the decree of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in February 1942, the commitment of more than 500 workers and employees of the oil industry of Azerbaijan was awarded orders and medals. Of the estimated 600,000 Azerbaijanis who were recruited into the Soviet Army during the war, 290,000 died.

===Post-war period===

An event that greatly impacted Azerbaijanis on both sides of the border was the Soviet occupation of Iranian Azerbaijan in the summer of 1941. The Soviet military presence south of the Aras River led to a revival of Pan-Azerbaijani nationalism. During the Soviet occupation, a revival of the Azerbaijani literary language, which had largely been supplanted by Persian, was promoted with the help of writers, journalists, and teachers from Soviet Azerbaijan. In November 1945, with Soviet backing, an autonomous &quot;Azerbaijan People&#x27;s Government&quot; was set up at Tabriz under Jafar Pishevari, the leader of the Azerbaijani Democratic Party. Secular cultural institutions and education in Azerbaijani blossomed throughout Iranian Azerbaijan, and speculation grew rife about a possible unification of the two Azerbaijani republics, under Soviet control. As it turned out, the issue of Iranian Azerbaijan became one of the first conflicts of the Cold War, and under the pressure from the Western powers, the Soviet army was withdrawn. The Iranian government regained control over Iranian Azerbaijan by the end of 1946 and the Democratic Party leaders took refuge in Soviet Azerbaijan. Jafar Pishevari, who was never fully trusted by Stalin, soon died under mysterious circumstances.
Apart from the Oil Rocks, Azerbaijan&#x27;s first offshore oil field was opened in the early 1950s. Policies of de-Stalinization and improvement after the 1950s led to better education and welfare conditions for most of Azerbaijan. This also coincided with the period of rapid urbanization and industrialization. During this period of change, a new anti-Islamic drive and return to a policy of &quot;Russification&quot;, under the policy of &quot;sblizheniye&quot; (&quot;rapprochement&quot;), was instituted in order to merge all the peoples of the USSR into a new monolithic Soviet nation.

===Pre-secession===
In the 1960s, signs of a structural crisis in the Soviet system began to emerge. Azerbaijan&#x27;s crucial oil industry lost its relative importance in the Soviet economy, partly because of a shift of oil production to other regions of the Soviet Union and partly because of the depletion of known oil resources accessible from land, while offshore production was not deemed cost-effective. As a result, Azerbaijan had the lowest rate of growth in productivity and economic output among the Soviet republics, with the exception of Tajikistan. Ethnic tensions, particularly between Armenians and Azerbaijanis began to grow, but the violence was suppressed. In an attempt to end the growing structural crisis, the government in Moscow appointed Heydar Aliyev as the first secretary of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan in 1969. Aliyev temporarily improved the economic conditions and promoted alternative industries to the declining oil industry, such as cotton. He also consolidated the republic&#x27;s ruling elite, which now consisted almost entirely of ethnic Azerbaijanis, thus reverting the previous trends of &quot;sblizheniye&quot;. In 1982 Aliyev was made a member of the Communist Party&#x27;s Politburo in Moscow. In 1987, when &quot;perestroika&quot; was implemented, he was forced to retire by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, whose reform policies he opposed.

===Secession===
The late 1980s, during the Gorbachev era, were characterized by increasing unrest in the Caucasus, initially over the Nagorno-Karabakh issue. The ethnic strife revealed the shortcomings of the Communist Party as a champion of national interests and, in the spirit of &quot;glasnost&quot;, independent publications and political organizations began to emerge. Of these organizations, by far the most prominent was the Popular Front of Azerbaijan (PFA), which by the fall of 1989 had a lot of popular support. The movement supported independence from the USSR.
The unrest culminated in a crackdown by the Red army which aimed at silencing the demands for independence. At least 132 demonstrators were killed and other civilians in Baku injured on 20 January 1990.

Azerbaijan participated in the union-wide referendum to preserve the union as the Union of Soviet Sovereign Republics but with different constitutional arrangements. The referendum was passed by 93.3% of valid polls. The Armenian SSR did not participate in the referendum. The Supreme Soviet of the exclave of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic also decided not to participate in the referendum. The Azerbaijani Popular Front Party argued that only 15% of the electorate had participated in the referendum.

The &quot;Treaty of the Union of Sovereign States&quot; failed to be ratified because the 1991 Soviet coup d&#x27;état attempt accelerated declarations of independence by Soviet Socialist Republics between August and December. Azerbaijan adopted its declaration of independence on 18 October 1991. The final dissolution of the Soviet Union took place on 26 December 1991. Shortly before that date, the Azerbaijan SSR joined the Commonwealth of Independent States.

By the end of 1991 fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh had escalated into a full-scale war, which culminated into a tense 1994 cease-fire that persisted into the 21st centuru. Azerbaijani success in the war of 2020 and a further successful offensive in 2023 resulted in the restoration of Azerbaijan&#x27;s territorial extent to that which it had held as a Soviet Republic.

== Government ==
On 28 April 1920, Temporary Revolutionary Committee took control over the country, and formed a government named Council of People&#x27;s Commissars of Azerbaijan SSR.

After the approval of the Constitution of Azerbaijan SSR by the All-Azerbaijan Congress of Soviets in 1921, Azerbaijan Revolutionary Committee was revoked and Central Executive Committee was selected as a supreme legislative body.

According to the Constitution Azerbaijan SSR in 1937, the legislative body switched to a new phase. Central Executive Committee was replaced with Supreme Soviet.

==Military==
Under the military structure of the former Soviet Union, Azerbaijan shortly before gaining independence, was host to over 60,000 Soviet military personnel deployed throughout the country in units of the Ground Forces, Air Forces, Air Defense Forces, and Navy. The primary combat formation of Ground Forces in Azerbaijan was the 4th Army, which housed its headquarters and various support units in Baku. In addition to the independent surface-to-air missile (SAM), artillery, and SCUD brigades, the principal combat elements of the Fourth Army were the 23rd (Ganja), 295th (Lenkaran), 60th (Baku) and 75th (Nakhchivan) motorized rifle divisions (MRD), and the Ganja Helicopter Assault Regiment (Mi-24 Hinds and Mi-8 Hips). The only ground forces training establishment in Azerbaijan was the Baku Higher Combined Arms Command School. Military conscription in the Azerbaijan SSR was introduced only after the establishment of Soviet control, with the number of people being called up for service being minimal at first.
