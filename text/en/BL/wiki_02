<text>Mike Leigh (born 20 February 1943) is an English writer-director and former actor with film, theatre, and television career spanning nearly 60 years. He has received numerous accolades, including prizes at the Cannes Film Festival, the Berlin International Film Festival, and the Venice International Film Festival, three BAFTA Awards, and nominations for seven Academy Awards. He also received the BAFTA Fellowship in 2014, and was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1993 Birthday Honours for services to the film industry.

Leigh studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), the Camberwell School of Art, the Central School of Art and Design and the London School of Film Technique. His short-lived acting career included the role of a mute in the 1963 &quot;Maigret&quot; episode &quot;The Flemish Shop&quot;. He began working as a theatre director and playwright in the mid-1960s, before transitioning to making televised plays and films for BBC Television in the 1970s and &#x27;80s. Leigh is known for his lengthy rehearsal and improvisation techniques with actors to build characters and narrative for his films. His purpose is to capture reality and present &quot;emotional, subjective, intuitive, instinctive, vulnerable films&quot;.

Leigh&#x27;s early films include &quot;Bleak Moments&quot; (1971), &quot;Meantime&quot; (1983), &quot;Life Is Sweet&quot; (1990), and &quot;Naked&quot; (1993). He received Academy Award nominations for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay for &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot; (1996) and &quot;Vera Drake&quot; (2004). He received further Oscar nominations for &quot;Topsy-Turvy&quot; (1999), &quot;Happy-Go-Lucky&quot; (2008), and &quot;Another Year&quot; (2010). Other notable films include &quot;All or Nothing&quot; (2002), &quot;Mr. Turner&quot; (2014), &quot;Peterloo&quot; (2018), and &quot;Hard Truths&quot; (2024). His stage plays include &quot;Smelling A Rat&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s A Great Big Shame&quot;, &quot;Greek Tragedy&quot;, &quot;Goose-Pimples&quot;, &quot;Ecstasy&quot; and &quot;Abigail&#x27;s Party&quot;.

==Early life and education ==
Leigh was born on 20 February 1943 to Phyllis Pauline (&quot;née&quot; Cousin) and Alfred Abraham Leigh, a doctor. Leigh was born at Brocket Hall in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, at the time a maternity home. His mother, in her confinement, went to stay with her parents in Hertfordshire for comfort and support while her husband was serving as a captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps. Leigh was brought up in the Broughton area of Salford, Lancashire. He attended North Grecian Street Junior School. He is from a Jewish family; his paternal grandparents were Russian-Jewish immigrants who settled in Manchester. The family name, originally Lieberman, was anglicised in 1939 &quot;for obvious reasons&quot;. When the war ended, Leigh&#x27;s father began his career as a general practitioner in Higher Broughton, &quot;the epicentre of Leigh&#x27;s youngest years and the area memorialised in &quot;Hard Labour&quot;.&quot; Leigh went to Salford Grammar School, as did the director Les Blair, his friend, who produced Leigh&#x27;s first feature film, &quot;Bleak Moments&quot; (1971). There was a strong tradition of drama in the all-boys school, and an English master, Mr Nutter, supplied the library with newly published plays.

Outside school, Leigh thrived in the Manchester branch of Labour Zionist youth movement Habonim. In the late 1950s, he attended summer camps and winter activities over the Christmas break all round the country. During this time the most important part of his artistic consumption was cinema, although this was supplemented by his discovery of Picasso, Surrealism, &quot;The Goon Show&quot;, and even family visits to the Hallé Orchestra and the D&#x27;Oyly Carte. His father strongly opposed the idea that Leigh might become an artist or an actor. He forbade him his frequent habit of sketching visitors who came to the house and regarded him as a problem child because of his creative interests. In 1960, &quot;to his utter astonishment&quot;, Leigh won a scholarship to RADA. Initially trained as an actor at RADA, Leigh started to hone his directing skills at East 15 Acting School, where he met the actress Alison Steadman.

Leigh responded negatively to RADA&#x27;s agenda, finding himself being taught how to &quot;laugh, cry and snog&quot; for weekly rep purposes, and became a sullen student. He later attended Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts (in 1963), the Central School of Art and Design and the London School of Film Technique on Charlotte Street. When he had arrived in London, one of the first films he had seen was &quot;Shadows&quot; (1959), an improvised film by John Cassavetes, in which a cast of unknowns was observed &quot;living, loving and bickering&quot; on the streets of New York, and Leigh &quot;felt it might be possible to create complete plays from scratch with a group of actors&quot;. Other influences from this time included Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Caretaker&quot;—&quot;Leigh was mesmerised by the play and the (Arts Theatre) production&quot;—Samuel Beckett, whose novels he read avidly, and Flann O&#x27;Brien, whose &quot;tragi-comedy&quot; Leigh found particularly appealing. Influential and important productions he saw in this period included Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Endgame&quot;, Peter Brook&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot; and in 1965 Peter Weiss&#x27;s &quot;Marat/Sade&quot;, a production developed through improvisation, the actors basing their characterisations on people they had visited in a mental hospital. The visual worlds of Picasso, Ronald Searle, George Grosz, and William Hogarth exerted another kind of influence. Leigh had small roles in several British films in the early 1960s (&quot;West 11&quot;, &quot;Two Left Feet&quot;), and played a young deaf-mute, interrogated by Rupert Davies, in the BBC Television series &quot;Maigret&quot;. In 1964–65, he collaborated with David Halliwell, and designed and directed the first production of &quot;Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs&quot; at the Unity Theatre.

Leigh has been called &quot;a gifted cartoonist ... a northerner who came south, slightly chippy, fiercely proud (and critical) of his roots and Jewish background; and he is a child of the 1960s and of the explosion of interest in the European cinema and the possibilities of television.&quot;

==Career==
=== 1965–1979: Plays and television films ===
In 1965, Leigh went to work at the Midlands Art Centre in Birmingham as a resident assistant director and started to experiment with the idea that writing and rehearsing could be part of the same process. &quot;The Box Play&quot;, a family scenario staged in a cagelike box, &quot;absorbed all sorts of contemporary ideas in art such as the space frames of Roland Pichet..it was visually very exciting,&quot; and two more &quot;improvised&quot; pieces followed.

After the Birmingham interlude, Leigh found a flat in Euston, where he lived for the next ten years. In 1966–67, he worked as an assistant director with the Royal Shakespeare Company on productions of &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;Coriolanus&quot;, and &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;. He worked on an improvised play of his own with some professional actors called &quot;NENAA&quot; (an acronym for &quot;North East New Arts Association&quot;), which explored the fantasies of a Tynesider working in a café, with ideas of founding an arts association in the northeast.

In 1970, Leigh wrote, &quot;I saw that we must start off with a collection of totally unrelated characters (each one the specific creation of its actor) and then go through a process in which I must cause them to meet each other, and build a network of real relationships; the play would be drawn from the results.&quot; After Stratford-upon-Avon, Leigh directed a couple of London drama school productions that included Thomas Dekker&#x27;s &quot;The Honest Whore&quot; at E15 Acting School in Loughton—where he met Alison Steadman for the first time. In 1968, wanting to return to Manchester, he sublet his London flat and moved to Levenshulme. Taking up a part-time lectureship in a Catholic women teachers training college, Sedgley Park, he ran a drama course and devised and directed &quot;Epilogue&quot;, focusing on a priest with doubts, and for the Manchester Youth Theatre he devised and directed two big-cast projects, &quot;Big Basil&quot; and &quot;Glum Victoria and the Lad with Specs&quot;.

As the decade came to a close, Leigh knew he wanted to make films, and that &quot;The manner of working was at last fixed. There would be discussions and rehearsals. Plays or films would develop organically with actors fully liberated into the creative process. After an exploratory improvisation period, Leigh would write a structure, indicating the order in which scenes happened, usually with a single bare sentence: Johnny and Sophie meet; Betty does Joy&#x27;s hair; [etc.] And it was rehearsed and rehearsed until it achieved the required quality of &#x27;finish&#x27;.&quot;

In the 1970s, Leigh made nine television plays. Earlier plays such as &quot;Nuts in May&quot; (1976) and &quot;Abigail&#x27;s Party&quot; (1977) tended more toward bleak yet humorous satire of middle-class manners and attitudes. His plays are generally more caustic, stridently trying to depict society&#x27;s banality. &quot;Goose-Pimples&quot; and &quot;Abigail&#x27;s Party&quot; focus on the vulgar middle class in a convivial party setting that spirals out of control. The television version of &quot;Abigail&#x27;s Party&quot; was made at some speed; Steadman was pregnant at the time, and Leigh&#x27;s objections to flaws in the production, particularly the lighting, led to his preference for theatrical films.

===1980–1993: Early British films ===
In 1983, Leigh directed the comedy-drama film &quot;Meantime&quot;, starring Gary Oldman and Tim Roth. The project was shown on Channel 4 and premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival. For The Criterion Collection, Sean O&#x27;Sullivan wrote that the film was addressing &quot;the crisis of national identity triggered by Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s election in 1979&quot;.

There was something of a hiatus in Leigh&#x27;s career after his father died in February 1985. Leigh was in Australia at the time—having agreed to attend a screenwriters&#x27; conference in Melbourne at the start of 1985, he had then accepted an invitation to teach at the Australian Film School in Sydney—and he then &quot;buried his solitude and sense of loss in a busy round of people, publicity and talks&quot;. He gradually extended &quot;the long journey home&quot;, visiting Bali, Singapore, Hong Kong, and China. He has said, &quot;The whole thing was an amazing, unforgettable period in my life. But it was all to do with personal feelings, my father, where to go next, and my desire to make a feature film. I felt I was at the end of one stage of my career and at the start of another.&quot;

Leigh&#x27;s 1986 project code-named &quot;Rhubarb&quot;, for which he had gathered actors in Blackburn, including Jane Horrocks, Julie Walters and David Thewlis, was cancelled after seven weeks&#x27; rehearsals, and Leigh returned home. &quot;The nature of what I do is totally creative, and you have to get in there and stick with it. The tension between the bourgeois suburban and the anarchist bohemian that is in my work is obviously in my life, too...I started to pull myself together. I didn&#x27;t work, I simply stayed at home and looked after the boys.&quot; In 1987 Channel 4 put up some money for a short film and, with Portman Productions, agreed to co-produce Leigh&#x27;s first feature film since &quot;Bleak Moments.&quot;

In 1988, Leigh and producer Simon Channing Williams founded Thin Man Films, a film production company based in London, to produce Leigh&#x27;s films. They chose the company name because neither of them was thin. Later in 1988, Leigh made &quot;High Hopes&quot;, about a disjointed working-class family whose members live in a rundown flat and a council house. His later films, such as &quot;Naked&quot; and &quot;Vera Drake&quot;, are somewhat starker and more brutal, and concentrate more on the working class. Leigh&#x27;s stage plays include &quot;Smelling A Rat&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s A Great Big Shame&quot;, &quot;Greek Tragedy&quot;, &quot;Goose-Pimples&quot;, &quot;Ecstasy&quot;, and &quot;Abigail&#x27;s Party&quot;.

In the 1990s, Leigh enjoyed critical successes, including such films as the comedy &quot;Life Is Sweet&quot; (1990) starring Alison Steadman, Jim Broadbent, Timothy Spall, Claire Skinner, and Jane Horrocks. It was his third feature film, and follows a working-class North London family over a few summer weeks. Film critic Philip French in &quot;The Observer&quot; defended the film against criticism that it was patronising: &quot;Leigh has been called patronising. The charge is false. The Noël Coward/David Lean film &quot;This Happy Breed&quot;, evoked by Leigh in several panning shots across suburban back gardens, is patronising. Coward and Lean pat their characters on the back...Leigh shakes them, hugs them, sometimes despairs over them, but never thinks that they are other than versions of ourselves.&quot; Independent Spirit Awards nominated &quot;Life Is Sweet&quot; for Best International Film.

Leigh&#x27;s fourth feature film was the black comedy &quot;Naked&quot; (1993), starring David Thewlis. It premiered at the 46th Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or and won Best Director for Leigh and Best Actor for Thewlis. Derek Malcolm of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that the film &quot;is certainly Leigh&#x27;s most striking piece of cinema to date&quot; and that &quot;it tries to articulate what is wrong with the society that Mrs Thatcher claims does not exist.&quot;

=== 1996–2009: International recognition ===
In 1996, Leigh directed his fifth feature film, the drama &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot; (1996). Its ensemble cast included Leigh regulars Timothy Spall, Brenda Blethyn, Phyllis Logan, and Marianne Jean-Baptiste. The film premiered at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, where it received the Palme d&#x27;Or and the Best Actress award for Blethyn. It was a financial and critical success. Film critic Roger Ebert, writing for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, gave &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot; four out of four stars, writing, &quot;moment after moment, scene after scene, &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot; unfolds with the fascination of eavesdropping&quot;. He called the film &quot;a flowering of his technique. It moves us on a human level, it keeps us guessing during scenes as unpredictable as life, and it shows us how ordinary people have a chance of somehow coping with their problems, which are rather ordinary, too.&quot; In 2009, Ebert added the film to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list. It received five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director.

He followed that success with &quot;Career Girls&quot; (1997) and &quot;Topsy-Turvy&quot; (1999), a period drama about the creation of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Mikado&quot;. The anger inherent in Leigh&#x27;s material, in some ways typical of the Thatcher years, softened after her departure from the political scene. In 2005, Leigh returned to directing for the stage after many years with a new play, &quot;Two Thousand Years&quot;, at the Royal National Theatre. The play deals with divisions within a left-wing secular Jewish family when one of the younger members finds religion. It was the first time Leigh had drawn on his Jewish background for material. In 2002, Leigh directed the working-class drama &quot;All or Nothing.&quot; The same year, he became chairman for his alma mater, London Film School. He remained chair until March 2018, when he was succeeded by Greg Dyke.

In 2004, he directed his ninth feature film, &quot;Vera Drake&quot;, a period film about a working-class woman (Imelda Staunton) who performs illegal abortions during the 1950s. The film premiered at the 61st Venice International Film Festival to rapturous reviews, winning the Golden Lion for Best Film and the Volpi Cup for Best Actress for Staunton. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an approval rating of 92% with the consensus, &quot;with a piercingly powerful performance by Imelda Staunton, &quot;Vera Drake&quot; brings teeming humanity to the controversial subject of abortion.&quot; The film received 11 British Academy Film Award nominations, winning three awards, for Best Director, Best Actress in a Leading Role and Best Costume Design. The film was also nominated for three Academy Awards, for Best Director, Best Actress, and Best Screenplay.

In 2008, Leigh released a modern-day comedy, &quot;Happy-Go-Lucky&quot;, starring Sally Hawkins. It debuted at the Berlin International Film Festival, where Hawkins won the Silver Bear for Best Actress. The film was a critical success, with many praising Hawkins&#x27;s performance. She received many awards, including a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. The same year, Leigh was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.

===2010–present===

In 2010, Leigh released his film &quot;Another Year&quot;, starring Jim Broadbent, Ruth Sheen, and Lesley Manville. It premiered at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival in competition for the Palme d&#x27;Or. The film was shown at the 54th London Film Festival before its general British release date on 5 November 2010. The film was also a success in the U.S., with Ebert giving the film his highest rating, four out of four stars, and writing, &quot;Not quite every year brings a new Mike Leigh film, but the years that do are blessed with his sympathy, penetrating observation, and instinct for human comedy...Leigh&#x27;s &quot;Another Year&quot; is like a long, purifying soak in empathy.&quot; At the 83rd Academy Awards, Leigh was nominated for Best Original Screenplay, losing to &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot;.

In 2012, Leigh was selected to be jury president of the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival. Leigh released his 12th feature film, the biographical period film &quot;Mr. Turner&quot; (2014), based on the life and artworks of J. M. W. Turner, portrayed by Timothy Spall. The film premiered at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or and won rave reviews, with many critics praising Spall&#x27;s performance. Spall received the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor and the film won the Vulcan Award for its cinematography by Dick Pope. &quot;Observer&quot; critic Mark Kermode called the film a &quot;portrait of a man wrestling light with his hands as if it were a physical element: tangible, malleable, corporeal&quot;. That year, Leigh joined &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; for an hourlong roundtable discussion with other directors who had made films that year: Richard Linklater (&quot;Boyhood&quot;), Bennett Miller (&quot;Foxcatcher&quot;), Morten Tyldum (&quot;The Imitation Game&quot;), Angelina Jolie (&quot;Unbroken&quot;), and Christopher Nolan (&quot;Interstellar&quot;). &quot;Mr. Turner&quot; received Academy Award nominations for Cinematography, Production Design, and Costume Design.

In 2015, Leigh accepted an offer from English National Opera to direct the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; (with conductor David Parry, designer Alison Chitty, and starring Andrew Shore, Rebecca de Pont Davies and Jonathan Lemalu). The production then toured Europe, visiting Luxembourg (Les Théâtres de la Ville de Luxembourg), Caen (Théâtre de Caen) and Saarländisches Staatstheater. In 2018, Leigh released another historical feature, &quot;Peterloo&quot;, based on the 1819 Peterloo Massacre. The film was selected to be screened in the main competition section of the 75th Venice International Film Festival. It was distributed in the UK by Entertainment One and in the US by Amazon Video. It received mixed reviews; &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it a &quot;brilliant and demanding film&quot;.

In February 2020, it was reported that Leigh would begin shooting his latest film in the summer. After a delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was announced that the film, &quot;Hard Truths&quot;, would go into production in 2023. Set in contemporary times, it stars Marianne Jean-Baptiste and Michele Austin. In 2024, Leigh said he was struggling to secure funding for his next project.

==Style==
Leigh uses lengthy improvisations developed over several weeks to build characters and storylines for his films. He starts with some ideas of how he thinks things might develop, but does not reveal all his intentions to the cast, who gradually discover their fates and act out their responses. Initial preparation is in private with Leigh, and then the actors are introduced to each other in the order that their characters would have met in their lives. Intimate moments are explored that will not even be referred to in the final film to build insight and understanding of history, character and personal motivation. When an improvisation needs to be stopped, he tells the actors, &quot;Come out of character&quot;, before they discuss what happened or might have happened in a situation. According to critic Michael Coveney, Leigh&#x27;s films and stage plays &quot;comprise a distinctive, homogenous body of work which stands comparison with anyone&#x27;s in the British theatre and cinema over the same period.&quot;

Final filming is more traditional as a definite sense of story, action and dialogue is then in place. Leigh reminds the cast of material from the improvisations that he hopes to capture on film. &quot;The world of the characters and their relationships is brought into existence by discussion and a great amount of improvisation ... And research into anything and everything that will fill out the authenticity of the character.&quot; After months of rehearsal, or &quot;preparing for going out on location to make up a film&quot;, Leigh writes a shooting script, a bare scenario. Then, on location, after further &quot;real rehearsing&quot;, the script is finalized: &quot;I&#x27;ll set up an improvisation, ... I&#x27;ll analyse and discuss it, ... we&#x27;ll do another and I&#x27;ll ... refine and refine... until the actions and dialogue are totally integrated. Then we shoot it.&quot;

In an interview with Laura Miller, Leigh said, &quot;I make very stylistic films indeed, but style doesn&#x27;t become a substitute for truth and reality. It&#x27;s an integral, organic part of the whole thing.&quot; He strives to depict ordinary life, &quot;real life&quot;, unfolding under extenuating circumstances. He has said, &quot;I&#x27;m not an intellectual filmmaker. These are emotional, subjective, intuitive, instinctive, vulnerable films. And there&#x27;s a feeling of despair...I think there&#x27;s a feeling of chaos and disorder.&quot; Of the criticism &quot;Naked&quot; received, Leigh said: &quot;The criticism comes from the kind of quarters where &#x27;political correctness&#x27; in its worst manifestation is rife. It&#x27;s this kind of naive notion of how we should be in an unrealistic and altogether unhealthily over-wholesome way.&quot;

Leigh&#x27;s characters often struggle &quot;to express inexpressible feelings. Words are important, but rarely enough. The art of evasion and failure in communication certainly comes from Pinter, whom Leigh acknowledges as an important influence. He especially admires Pinter&#x27;s earliest work and directed &quot;The Caretaker&quot; while still at RADA.&quot;

Leigh has helped to create stars—Liz Smith in &quot;Hard Labour&quot;, Alison Steadman in &quot;Abigail&#x27;s Party&quot;, Brenda Blethyn in &quot;Grown-Ups&quot;, Antony Sher in &quot;Goose-Pimples&quot;, Gary Oldman and Tim Roth in &quot;Meantime&quot;, Jane Horrocks in &quot;Life Is Sweet&quot;, David Thewlis in &quot;Naked—&quot;and it has been said that the list of actors who have worked with him&quot;—&quot;including Paul Jesson, Phil Daniels, Lindsay Duncan, Lesley Sharp, Kathy Burke, Stephen Rea, and Julie Walters&quot;—&quot;&quot;comprises an impressive, almost representative, nucleus of outstanding British acting talent.&quot; His sensibility has been compared to those of Yasujirō Ozu and Federico Fellini. In &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, Ian Buruma wrote: &quot;It is hard to get on a London bus or listen to the people at the next table in a cafeteria without thinking of Mike Leigh. Like other wholly original artists, he has staked out his own territory. Leigh&#x27;s London is as distinctive as Fellini&#x27;s Rome or Ozu&#x27;s Tokyo.&quot;

==Influences==
Leigh has cited Jean Renoir and Satyajit Ray among his favourite film makers. In a 1991 interview, he also cited Frank Capra, Fritz Lang, Yasujirō Ozu and even Jean-Luc Godard, &quot;until the late &#x27;60s.&quot; When pressed for British influences in that interview, he referred to the Ealing comedies, &quot;despite their unconsciously patronizing way of portraying working-class people&quot; and the early &#x27;60s British New Wave films. Asked for his favourite comedies, he replied, &quot;One, Two, Three&quot;; &quot;La règle du jeu&quot;; and &quot;any Keaton&quot;. The critic David Thomson has written that, with the camera work in his films characterised by &quot;a detached, medical watchfulness&quot;, Leigh&#x27;s aesthetic may justly be compared to Ozu&#x27;s. Michael Coveney wrote: &quot;The cramped domestic interiors of Ozu find many echoes in Leigh&#x27;s scenes on stairways and in corridors and on landings, especially in &quot;Grown-Ups&quot;, &quot;Meantime&quot; and &quot;Naked&quot;. And two wonderful little episodes in Ozu&#x27;s &quot;Tokyo Story&quot;, in a hairdressing salon and a bar, must have been in Leigh&#x27;s subconscious memory when he made &quot;The Short and Curlies&quot; (1987), one of his most devastatingly funny pieces of work and the pub scene in &quot;Life Is Sweet&quot;&quot;.

== Favourite films ==

In 2012, Leigh participated in that year&#x27;s &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; film polls. Held every ten years to select the greatest films of all time, contemporary directors were asked to select ten films. Leigh named the following ten:

== Personal life ==
In September 1973, Leigh married actress Alison Steadman. They have two sons. Steadman appeared in seven of his films and several of his plays, including &quot;Wholesome Glory&quot; and &quot;Abigail&#x27;s Party&quot;. They divorced in 2001. Leigh then lived in central London with the actress Marion Bailey.

==Political activism==
Leigh is an atheist and a Distinguished Supporter of Humanists UK. He is also a republican. In 2014, Leigh publicly backed &quot;Hacked Off&quot; and its campaign for UK press self-regulation by &quot;safeguarding the press from political interference while also giving vital protection to the vulnerable.&quot;

In November 2019, along with other public figures, Leigh signed a letter supporting Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, calling him &quot;a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia and racism in much of the democratic world&quot; and endorsing him in the 2019 UK general election. In December 2019, along with 42 other leading cultural figures, Leigh signed a letter endorsing the Labour Party under Corbyn&#x27;s leadership in the 2019 general election. The letter stated: &quot;Labour&#x27;s election manifesto under Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s leadership offers a transformative plan that prioritises the needs of people and the planet over private profit and the vested interests of a few.&quot;

<text>Deneb () is a first-magnitude blue supergiant star in the constellation of Cygnus. Deneb is one of the vertices of the asterism known as the Summer Triangle and the &quot;head&quot; of the Northern Cross. It is the brightest star in Cygnus and the 19th brightest star in the night sky, with an average apparent magnitude of +1.25.

Deneb rivals Rigel, a closer blue supergiant, as the most luminous first-magnitude star. However, its distance, and hence luminosity, is poorly known; its luminosity is somewhere between 55,000 and 196,000 times that of the Sun. Its Bayer designation is α Cygni, which is Latinised to Alpha Cygni, abbreviated to Alpha Cyg or α Cyg. At a distance of 802 parsecs, it is the farthest star from Earth with a magnitude higher than 2.50.

==Nomenclature==
&quot;α Cygni&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Alpha Cygni&quot;) is the star&#x27;s designation given by Johann Bayer in 1603. The traditional name &quot;Deneb&quot; is derived from the Arabic word for &quot;tail&quot;, from the phrase ذنب الدجاجة &quot;Dhanab al-Dajājah&quot;, or &quot;tail of the hen&quot;. The IAU Working Group on Star Names has recognised the name &quot;Deneb&quot; for this star, and it is entered in their Catalog of Star Names.

&quot;Denebadigege&quot; was used in the &quot;Alfonsine Tables&quot;, other variants include &quot;Deneb Adige&quot;, &quot;Denebedigege&quot; and &quot;Arided&quot;. This latter name was derived from &quot;Al Ridhādh&quot;, a name for the constellation. Johann Bayer called it &quot;Arrioph&quot;, derived from &quot;Aridf&quot; and &quot;Al Ridf&quot;, &#x27;the hindmost&#x27; or &quot;Gallina&quot;. German poet and author Philippus Caesius termed it &quot;Os rosae&quot;, or &quot;Rosemund&quot; in German, or &quot;Uropygium&quot; – the parson&#x27;s nose. The names &quot;Arided&quot; and &quot;Aridif&quot; have fallen out of use.

An older traditional name is Arided , from the Arabic &quot;ar-ridf&quot; &#x27;the one sitting behind the rider&#x27; (or just &#x27;the follower&#x27;), perhaps referring to the other major stars of Cygnus, which were called &quot;al-fawāris&quot; &#x27;the riders&#x27;.

==Observation==

The 19th brightest star in the night sky, Deneb culminates each year on October 23 at 6 PM and September 7 at 9 PM, corresponding to summer evenings in the northern hemisphere. It never dips below the horizon at or above 45° north latitude, just grazing the northern horizon at its lowest point at such locations as Minneapolis, Montréal and Turin. In the southern hemisphere, Deneb is not visible south of 45° parallel south, so it just barely rises above the horizon in South Africa, southern Australia, and northern New Zealand during the southern winter.

Deneb is located at the tip of the Northern Cross asterism made up of the brightest stars in Cygnus, the others being Albireo (Beta Cygni), Gamma Cygni, Delta Cygni, and Epsilon Cygni. It also lies at one vertex of the prominent and widely spaced asterism called the Summer Triangle, shared with the first-magnitude stars Vega in the constellation Lyra and Altair in Aquila. This outline of stars is the approximate shape of a right triangle, with Deneb located at one of the acute angles.

The spectrum of Alpha Cygni has been observed by astronomers since at least 1888, and by 1910 the variable radial velocity had become apparent. This led to the early suggestion by E. B. Frost that this is a binary star system. In 1935, the work of G. F. Paddock and others had established that this star was variable in luminosity with a dominant period of 11.7 days and possibly with other, lower amplitude periods. By 1954, closer examination of the star&#x27;s calcium H and K lines showed a stationary core, which indicated the variable velocity was instead being caused by motion of the star&#x27;s atmosphere. This variation ranged from +6 to −9 km/s around the star&#x27;s mean radial velocity. Other, similar supergiants were found to have variable velocities, with this star being a typical member.
===Pole star===
Due to the Earth&#x27;s axial precession, Deneb will be an approximate pole star (7° off of the north celestial pole) at around 9800 AD. The north pole of Mars points to the midpoint of the line connecting Deneb and the star Alderamin.
==Physical characteristics==
Deneb&#x27;s adopted distance from the Earth is around . This is based on the distance to the Cygnus OB7 association. Another distance estimate using its bolometric magnitude implied by its effective temperature and surface gravity gives . The original derivation of a parallax using measurements from the astrometric satellite Hipparcos gave an uncertain result of 1.01 ± 0.57 mas that was consistent with this distance. However, the 2007 re-analysis gives a much larger parallax whose distance is barely half the current accepted value. This would result in a distance of , or . The controversy over whether the direct Hipparcos measurements can be ignored in favour of a wide range of indirect stellar models and interstellar distance scales is similar to the better known situation with the Pleiades.

Deneb&#x27;s absolute magnitude is estimated as −8.4, placing it among the visually brightest stars known, with an estimated luminosity of nearly . This is towards the upper end of values published over the past few decades. By the distance from Hipparcos parallax, Deneb has a luminosity of .

Deneb is the most luminous first magnitude star, that is, stars with a brighter apparent magnitude than 1.5. Deneb is also the most distant of the 30 brightest stars by a factor of almost 2. Based on its temperature and luminosity, and also on direct measurements of its tiny angular diameter (a mere 0.002 seconds of arc), Deneb appears to have a diameter about 100200 times that of the Sun; if placed at the center of the Solar System, Deneb would extend to the orbit of Mercury or Earth. It is one of the largest white &#x27;A&#x27; spectral type stars known.

Deneb is a bluish-white star of spectral type A2Ia, classifying it as a blue supergiant star with a surface temperature of 8,500 kelvin. Since 1943, its spectrum has served as one of the stable references by which other stars are classified. Its mass is estimated at 19 . Stellar winds causes matter to be lost at an average rate of per year, 100,000 times the Sun&#x27;s rate of mass loss or equivalent to about one Earth mass per 500 years.

===Evolutionary state===
Deneb spent much of its early life as an O-type main-sequence star of about , but it has now exhausted the hydrogen in its core and expanded to become a supergiant. Stars in the mass range of Deneb eventually expand to become the most luminous red supergiants, and within a few million years their cores will collapse producing a supernova explosion. It is now known that red supergiants up to a certain mass explode as the commonly seen type II-P supernovae, but more massive ones lose their outer layers to become hotter again. Depending on their initial masses and the rate of mass loss, they may explode as yellow hypergiants or luminous blue variables, or they may become Wolf-Rayet stars before exploding in a type Ib or Ic supernova. Identifying whether Deneb is currently evolving towards a red supergiant or is currently evolving bluewards again would place valuable constraints on the classes of stars that explode as red supergiants and those that explode as hotter stars.

Stars evolving red-wards for the first time are most likely fusing hydrogen in a shell around a helium core that has not yet grown hot enough to start fusion to carbon and oxygen. Convection has begun dredging up fusion products but these do not reach the surface. Post-red supergiant stars are expected to show those fusion products at the surface due to stronger convection during the red supergiant phase and due to loss of the obscuring outer layers of the star. Deneb is thought to be increasing its temperature after a period as a red supergiant, although current models do not exactly reproduce the surface elements showing in its spectrum. On the contrary, it is possible that Deneb has just left the main sequence and is evolving to a red supergiant phase, which is in agreement with estimates of its current mass, while its spectral composition can be explained by Deneb having been a rapidly rotating star during its main sequence phase.

===Variable star===

Deneb is the prototype of the Alpha Cygni (α Cygni) variable stars, whose small irregular amplitudes and rapid pulsations can cause its magnitude to vary anywhere between 1.21 and 1.29. Its variable velocity discovered by Lee in 1910, but it was not formally placed as a unique class of variable stars until the 1985 4th edition of the General Catalogue of Variable Stars. The cause of the pulsations of Alpha Cygni variable stars are not fully understood, but their irregular nature seems to be due to beating of multiple pulsation periods. Analysis of radial velocities determined 16 different harmonic pulsation modes with periods ranging between 6.9 and 100.8 days. A longer period of about 800 days probably also exists.

===Possible spectroscopic companion===
Deneb has been reported as a possible single line spectroscopic binary with a period of about 850 days, where the spectral lines from the star suggest cyclical radial velocity changes. Later investigations have found no evidence supporting the existence of a companion.

==Etymology and cultural significance==
Names similar to Deneb have been given to at least seven different stars, most notably Deneb Kaitos, the brightest star in the constellation of Cetus; Deneb Algedi, the brightest star in Capricornus; and Denebola, the second brightest star in Leo. All these stars are referring to the tail of the animals that their respective constellations represent.

In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;Celestial Ford&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting of Deneb, Gamma Cygni, Delta Cygni, 30 Cygni, Nu Cygni, Tau Cygni, Upsilon Cygni, Zeta Cygni and Epsilon Cygni. Consequently, the Chinese name for Deneb itself is (, ).

In the Chinese love story of Qi Xi, Deneb marks the magpie bridge across the Milky Way, which allows the separated lovers Niu Lang (Altair) and Zhi Nü (Vega) to be reunited on one special night of the year in late summer. In other versions of the story, Deneb is a fairy who acts as chaperone when the lovers meet.

===Namesakes===
USS &quot;Arided&quot; was a United States Navy &quot;Crater&quot;-class cargo ship named after the star. SS &quot;Deneb&quot; was an Italian merchant vessel that bore this name from 1951 until she was scrapped in 1966.

<text>The Coolidge effect is a biological phenomenon seen in animals, whereby males exhibit renewed sexual interest whenever a new female of reproductive availability is introduced, even after sex with prior but still available sexual partners. To a lesser extent, the effect is also seen among females with regard to their mates.

The Coolidge effect can be attributed to an increase in sexual responsiveness, and a shortening of the sexual refractory period. The evolutionary benefit to this phenomenon is that a male can fertilize multiple females. The male may be reinvigorated repeatedly for successful insemination of multiple females. This type of mating system can be referred to as polygyny, where one male has multiple female mates, but each female mates with only one or a few males. The Coolidge effect has been demonstrated to occur in humans across cultures and in both sexes.

==Origin of the term==
In a 1974 letter, behavioral endocrinologist Frank A. Beach claims to have introduced the term &quot;Coolidge effect&quot; in either 1958 or 1959. He attributed the neologism to an old joke about Calvin Coolidge when he was President of the United States.

The joke appears in a 1972 book (&quot;Aggression in Man and Animals&quot;, by Roger N. Johnson, p. 94).

== Empirical evidence ==
The original experiments with rats applied the following protocol: A male rat was placed into an enclosed large box with four or five female rats in heat. He immediately began to mate with all the female rats repeatedly until he eventually became exhausted. The females continued nudging and licking him, yet he did not respond. When a novel female was introduced into the box, he became alert and began to mate once again with the new female. This phenomenon is not limited to common rats.

The Coolidge effect is attributed to an increase in dopamine levels and the subsequent effect upon an animal&#x27;s limbic system. In a study conducted by Fiorino et al., male rats were used to study the role of the mesolimbic dopamine system on their sexual behaviour. In their experiment, microdialysis was used to monitor dopamine efflux from the nucleus accumbens during three stages of sexual behaviour, these included: copulation, sexual satiety, and the reinitiation of sexual behaviour. Behavioural testing for the Coolidge effect consisted of several phases including, copulation with a female, reintroduction to the same female, access to the same female, introduction to a novel female, and copulation with the novel female. During these phases, dopamine and its metabolites were monitored. Results from this study found that overall there was a significant increase in dopamine efflux in response to both the first female and the second female. During copulation with the first female, concentrations of dopamine in these male rats showed a significant increase, however, when the same female was presented again, a significant increase in dopamine was not observed. When a novel female was presented, initially, there was a small increase in the levels of dopamine, however, after continued copulation with the novel female, a significant increase in dopamine levels was observed. From these results, they concluded that an increase in mesolimbic dopamine efflux is associated with the appetitive and consummatory stages of sexual behaviour in male rats. Their data also suggest that stimuli associated with a novel female may increase dopamine transmission in a rat that is sexually satiated, and hence have a role in the reinitiation of sexual behaviour.

Additional studies have also provided further evidence for the role of the nucleus accumbens on sexual behaviour in rats. In a study conducted by Wood et al., male rats were divided into three conditions, and were presented with a cotton ball laden in either saline (control group), estrous vaginal smear of a familiar female (experimental group), and estrous vaginal smear of a novel female (experimental group). In this experiment, the role of the nucleus accumbens was characterized through recording neuronal activity of single cells in this area of the brain. Results from this study showed a greater proportion of neuronal activation when initially presented with a novel estrus stimulus in comparison to familiar estrus stimulus. Subsequent presentations of the novel estrus stimulus did not show an increase in neuronal activity.

== Allocating sperm ==
It has been observed that in certain species, males allocate sperm differently due to the Coolidge effect. The allocation is usually according to level of sperm competition, female novelty, and female reproductive quality. An experiment performed on an external fertilizing fish called &quot;Rhodeus amarus&quot;, also known as the European bitterling, was used to show that sperm can be allocated differently if a novel partner is around, but that it also happens if there is male-male competition. It is important to know that the European bitterling mating system works by females depositing their eggs into the gill filaments of freshwater mussels by her long ovipositor and then males proceed by ejecting their sperm into the gills of the mussel hosting the eggs. This means fertilization and development of the offspring relies on the quality and survival of the mussel. When the Coolidge effect was applied to this system, the experiment showed that it is the mussels, or the site of fertilization, that the males prefer to be novel. However, the takeaway from the experiment performed was that in male-male competition of the &quot;Rhodeus amarus,&quot; the dominant male will allocate more sperm when a novel mussel is present, while the subordinate male conserved its sperm until a proper opportunity came where it had a better chance of fertilization. A similar result was found in fowls, &quot;Gallus gallus&quot;, where the male showed a sperm allocation due to the Coolidge effect. The experiment found that male fowls reduce sperm investment in particular females they&#x27;ve encountered already, but increase sperm investment instantaneously if they encountered a new female.

Wedell et al. suggest a theory that when a male allocates sperm so that he can save sperm for novel partners, he limits himself and the mate by possibly investing too little sperm to their partners which in return can inseminate only a few eggs therefore making reproduction less successful. This could even possibly force females to seek more copulation to ensure successful reproduction. These types of evidence of sperm allocation would suggest that Coolidge effect will determine how much sperm is invested into females, and if possible, sperm will be allocated so that sperm can be evenly distributed for multiple mates. Overall, it is typically seen that allocation changes due to male-male competition and whether a novel partner is encountered or not.

== Absence ==
The Coolidge effect is typically found in most animals; however, there are instances where the Coolidge effect is absent. A study in decorated crickets, &quot;Gryllodes sigillatus&quot;, showed that even though females do display the Coolidge effect, the males in this species have no preference for novel mates. Because the females in this species control copulation, to test the Coolidge effect in males, two dead females were used. One female was already previously mated and the other was a novel female. To measure the Coolidge effect, the variables examined were the amount of courtship for the preferred mate and the size of the spermatophore transferred to the female. The size of the spermatophore was measured by weighing the mass after it was transferred to the female. The outcome of the experiment showed that there was no difference in the latency to re-mating of males confined with novel females and those paired with previous mates. There also was no difference in mass of the spermatophore. This experiment would suggest that the Coolidge effect is not applicable since the males of the &quot;Gryllodes sigillatus&quot; do not prefer novel females. Further research done on spiders also supports the possibility of absence of the Coolidge effect in certain species. Another study that focused on the Coolidge effect in simultaneously hermaphroditic species confirmed the validity of the Coolidge effect in freshwater snail &quot;Lymnaea stagnalis&quot;. &quot;Biomphalaria glabrata&quot;, another simultaneous hermaphrodite freshwater snail, does not exhibit sex-specific effects of partner novelty, and thus there is either no Coolidge effect in the species or no difference between the degrees to which the effect is expressed in the respective sexes.

== Means of sexual recognition for mates ==
Though there is not just a single reason why males will choose a novel partner, there have been experiments that show that the major determining factor for detecting a novel partner is olfactory preference. An experiment using Long-Evans rats, showed that odor played a major role in distinguishing the difference between a novel partner and familiar partner. In their experiment, Carr et al. paired each male rat with a female rat and allowed them to mate. Male rats were then tested for preference through the use of an apparatus that had two cylinders that were attached to their home cage and contained the familiar female and the novel female in each cylinder. Caps at the end of these cylinders prevented access to the females but had a hole in them to allow their odors to pass through to the male&#x27;s cage. Before the testing phase, the females were removed, and then the caps were removed to allow the male to explore both cylinders. From this experiment, they found that males preferred the scent of the novel female. While these males did not have access to these females to demonstrate mating preferences, this odor preference is believed to reflect promiscuous behavior, and therefore be important to the male mating strategy. 

In an earlier experiment, also conducted by Carr et al., they found that, unlike male rats, female rats preferred the odor of a familiar partner rather than the odor of a novel partner. 

Another study also examined not only olfactory preference but also what part of the brain targeted the olfactory preference. In this study, male hamsters were given lesions to either the hippocampus or the perirhinal-entorhinal cortex or received a sham treatment. Then the hamsters were allowed to mate with a female hamster until they became satiated. All subjects were then presented with two anesthetized females, one of whom was the female they had previously copulated with, while the other was a novel female. Hamsters with sham and hippocampal lesions investigated the anogenital region of the novel females for a significantly longer period in comparison to the familiar females. Males with lesions to the perirhinal-entorhinal cortex did not show a preference for either a familiar or novel female and spent a similar amount of time investigating the anogenital region of both females. The results from this study revealed that the perirhinal-entorhinal cortex region of the brain in golden hamsters is crucial for the recognition of familiar conspecifics and certain social behaviors. The conclusion from this experiment was also consistent in rats and monkeys, since damage to this region of the brain impaired standard recognition memory, which would suggest that the hippocampal region of the brain is not crucial in social behavior memory, but rather, the perirhinal-entorhinal cortex.

This effect of olfaction has also been observed in invertebrates such as flies. In a study conducted by Tan and colleagues, the role of olfaction in species recognition was examined using flies, &quot;Drosophila melanogaster,&quot; which processed a mutated &quot;Orco&quot; gene, which codes for a co-receptor that is important for olfaction. The result of this type of mutation renders these flies unable to discriminate between phenotypically familiar (i.e., from the same family and/or environment) and phenotypically novel (i.e., unrelated and from a different environment) females. When presented with a phenotypically familiar and phenotypically novel female, mutant flies did not show a preference towards either female, while wild-type flies (i.e., flies without the mutated &quot;Orco&quot; gene) did. The results from this experiment suggest that the &quot;Orco&quot; gene is important in discriminating between mates, and suggests an important role of olfactory cues in phenotypic familiarity.

== Sexual satiety ==
Although males typically will prefer novel mates every time the opportunity is present, there is a physical limit to the sex drive. An experiment performed on rats showed that when left to reproduce to sexual satiety, the motor ejaculatory behavior, intromission, and dislodging seminal plugs were all possible after multiple mates, but little to no sperm would be produced during ejaculation. The experiment also concluded that males that reached satiety and non-satiety males both had the similar amounts of intromissions and time spent dislodging the seminal plug. Another study performed on rats showed the same results, but found data that concluded that reaching optimal chances of impregnating their mates happened after resting for 15 days. These experiments would suggest that one of the major limitations on the Coolidge effect is the physical boundaries of gamete production.

== Potentiality in female animals ==
While the Coolidge effect is usually demonstrated by males—that is, males displaying renewed excitement with a novel female—the body of research into the phenomenon continues to explore the potentiality of the effect in females, specifically rodents. Research examining female rats has lent its support, wherein female rats showed a higher incentive motivation for unknown males over ones they had just copulated with.

In a study conducted in 2013, researchers conducted an experiment to test if the Coolidge effect could be observed in female rats. In their experiment, they assigned female rats to one of two conditions: paced or non-paced. In the paced condition, females were able to control the timing of copulation, while in the non-paced condition males regulated the timing of mating. Females in the paced condition were placed into an arena that was divided into two compartments which contained holes that only the female could pass through. The female was placed on one side of the divided arena, and the male was placed in the opposite side; this allowed the female to enter and exit the male&#x27;s side depending on the circumstances, therefore regulating the timing of copulation. In the non-paced condition, both the female and male rats were placed in an undivided arena and were allowed to mate. In both conditions, females were exposed to a constant, familiar male followed by a novel male. Their results found that females showed a significant increase in proceptive behaviours when a novel mate was present, but only if the female could regulate mating. Repeated mating with the same male also resulted in a decrease in proceptivity, which is thought to suggest sexual satiety. These results suggest that the Coolidge effect may also be present in female rats.

Lester and Gorzalka developed a model to determine whether or not the Coolidge effect also occurs in females. Their experiment, which used hamsters instead of rats, concluded that it does occur to a lesser degree in females, where the evolutionary advantage of mating with multiple partners is less straightforward. It is possible that the presence of the Coolidge effect in females could serve to optimize the female&#x27;s reproductive success, and prevent mating with a sterile male. Mating with multiple males may reduce the probability that the female&#x27;s gametes will not be successfully fertilized.

<doc id="393536" wikidata="Q155554" url="?curid=393536" title="Marc Ravalomanana">
<text>Marc Ravalomanana (; born 12 December 1949) is a Malagasy politician who served as the sixth President of Madagascar from 2002 to 2009. Born into a farming Merina family in Imerinkasinina, near the capital city of Antananarivo, Ravalomanana first rose to prominence as the founder and CEO of the vast dairy conglomerate TIKO, later launching successful wholesaler MAGRO and several additional companies.

He entered politics upon founding the Tiako Iarivo political party in 1999 and successfully ran for the position of mayor of Antananarivo, holding the position from 1999 to 2001. As mayor he improved sanitary and security conditions in the city. In August 2001 he announced his candidacy as an independent candidate in the December 2001 presidential election. He then took office as president in 2002 amidst a dispute over election results in which he successfully pressed his claim to have won a majority in the first round. Under the leadership of Jacques Sylla, Ravalomanana&#x27;s prime minister from 2002 to 2007, the political party &quot;Tiako I Madagasikara&quot; (TIM) was founded in 2002 to support Ravalomanana&#x27;s presidency and came to dominate legislative and local elections. He was re-elected in December 2006, again with a majority in the first round.

During Ravalomanana&#x27;s presidency, Madagascar made significant advances toward development targets and experienced an average of seven per cent growth per year. His administration oversaw the construction of thousands of new schools and health clinics. Road rehabilitation aided in improving rural farmers&#x27; access to markets. The establishment of the independent anti-corruption agency BIANCO, and the adoption of diverse supporting policies resulted in a decline in governmental corruption.
Opposition members criticized Ravalomanana in the later period of his presidency, accusing him of increasing authoritarianism and the mixing of public and private interests. In addition, the benefits of the country&#x27;s growth were not evenly spread, leading to increased wealth inequality, inflation and a decline in purchasing power for the lower and middle classes. In 2008 a controversial land lease agreement with Korean agricultural firm Daewoo, the purchase of a costly presidential jet and the closure of media channels owned by opposition leader and mayor of Antananarivo, Andry Rajoelina, strengthened popular disapproval of his policies. Rajoelina rallied popular support for the opposition, leading to a popular uprising that began in January 2009 and ended two months later with Ravalomanana&#x27;s resignation under pressure and Rajoelina taking control with military support in a power transfer viewed by the international community as a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;.

From 2009 to 2012 Ravalomanana lived in exile in South Africa, where he was engaged in active negotiations with Rajoelina and former heads of state Albert Zafy and Didier Ratsiraka to organize national elections. In December 2012 he declared he would not present himself as a candidate, then a precondition to the elections being viewed as legitimate by the international community. TGV candidate Hery Rajaonarimampianina was elected president in January 2014, defeating Jean-Louis Robinson, the candidate of Marc Ravalomanana&#x27;s camp. Upon attempting to return to Madagascar in October 2014 he was arrested, having been sentenced in absentia to lifelong hard labour for abuses of power by the Rajoelina administration. After his sentence was lifted and he was freed from house arrest in May 2015, Ravalomanana announced the re-opening of the Tiko business group and was re-elected the president of TIM.

== Early years ==
Marc Ravalomanana was born on 12 December 1949 in the village of Imerinkasinina, east of Antananarivo in Manjakandriana District. Ravalomanana&#x27;s parents worked as peddlers before opening a small shop in a rural village in Tamatave Province.

Ravalomanana&#x27;s family origins are Merina, the island&#x27;s largest and most politically prominent ethnic group.

From age five he began attending Anjeva Gara public primary school, located from Imerinkasinina. He walked this distance daily, often departing early with baskets of watercress to sell to train passengers at the nearby station. He completed his upper primary private school in Ambohimalaza. After completing his primary studies he attended the Swedish missionary-run technical secondary school in Ambatomanga.

== Entrepreneur ==
Upon completing his studies, Ravalomanana returned to Manjakandriana District, where he and his family began making and selling homemade yogurts, a common artisanal product in the highlands region. On his bicycle, he collected milk from farmers in neighboring towns, gradually increasing his production and clientele. He opened his first yogurt and cheese production center in 1977 in Sambaina on land he named &quot;Rova-Tiko&quot; (&quot;Tiko Palace&quot;), where he would build the first Tiko factory several years later.

Ravalomanana solicited a loan from the &quot;Agence Française de Développement&quot; to further expand his business, but this request was denied, souring his view of France. His subsequent request to the World Bank for 1.5 million US dollars was approved, and in 1982 he founded the Tiko company. The representative of the World Bank to Madagascar at the time, Jose Bronfman, secured the loan with exceptionally favorable reimbursement conditions that enabled Ravalomanana to sell his products at a lower cost than other small dairy producers, which gradually put his most significant competitors out of business. Bronfman later left his post at the World Bank to become a principal investor in the company, joined by private investors from South Africa, Germany and the United States. As Tiko continued to grow, the entrepreneur began incorporating imported ingredients such as powdered milk from South Africa (constituting 80 per cent of the composition of Tiko dairy products) and surplus butter from Europe, further improving the profitability of his business and enabling additional diversification. Tiko Group first concentrated exclusively on the production of dairy products before expanding into fruit juices, ice cream, cooking oil and carbonated beverages. The Tiko slogan printed on many of the group&#x27;s products, &quot;Vita Malagasy&quot; (&quot;Made in Madagascar&quot;).

Ravalomanana cultivated political relationships to facilitate the continued growth of Tiko in spite of an economic climate non-conducive to free enterprise under the Socialist administration of Ratsiraka. Early support in the 1980s came from the Supreme Counselor of the Revolution Manandafy Rakotonirina, then-Minister of Finance Rakotovao Razakaboana, and another minister, Justin Rarivoson. By the mid-1980s, the profitability of his Tiko enterprise enabled Ravalomanana to purchase a costly villa formerly owned by French colonial governor Leon Reallon in the central Faravohitra neighborhood of Antananarivo.

In 1997, under the pretext of concern about mad cow disease, Ratsiraka obstructed Ravalomanana&#x27;s plans to build a farm stocked with imported high-yield milk cows. Ravalomanana overcame the objection by breeding high-yield cows locally, thereby further boosting Tiko production. Later that same year, Ratsiraka&#x27;s daughters began competing with Tiko by importing and reselling vegetable oil under the brand name &quot;Eden&quot;. When Norbert Ratsirahonana declared himself a candidate in the 1997 presidential elections against Ratsiraka and Albert Zafy, Ravalomanana provided significant financial contributions to the Ratsirahonana campaign in return for tax exemptions on his edible oil products for a period of five years. The profits he consequently earned were reinvested to create the Magro wholesale company in 1998. By 2001, over a dozen principal warehouses throughout the country enabled widespread distribution of Tiko products to urban and rural areas, with a flagship warehouse in the Akorandrano neighborhood of Antananarivo.

The Ratsiraka administration launched an inquiry into Tiko business practices in September 2000 and issued an executive decision in June 2001 that the company should be shut down for failure to adhere to a 1996 agreement requiring Tiko to create jobs and produce low-cost vegetable oil; this ruling was overturned by the Supreme Court on 16 October 2002. A number of lawsuits have been filed over Ravalomanana&#x27;s business practices, including a court judgment on the eve of the 2001 presidential election requiring the payment of between 200 and 363 billion Malagasy francs in Tiko back taxes, but all were either dismissed or ended in an out-of-court settlement; none resulted in a criminal conviction.
At its height during the period of Ravalomanana&#x27;s presidency, Tiko provided direct salaried employment to between 1,000 and 3,000 staff and indirect employment to over 10,000. The group was the largest dairy producer in the country and a leader in the national agribusiness sector. The success of his enterprises made Ravalomanana a wealthy man. In the mandatory self-disclosure of wealth submitted to the High Constitutional Court in 2000 by all presidential candidates, Ravalomanana declared ownership of 27 properties valued at over two billion Malagasy francs. He owned 90 per cent of Tiko Inc., 80 per cent of Tiko Agri and 50 per cent of Tiko Oil Products, a portfolio worth 13.1 billion Malagasy francs, and declared 77 million Malagasy francs in annual revenues. Vivier (2007) demonstrates that the valuation of Ravalomanana&#x27;s holdings and his annual revenue in particular were significantly underestimated.

== Mayor of Antananarivo ==
In 1999, Ravalomanana ran as an independent candidate in the local elections, spending over $110,000 on his campaign—a level of expense then unheard of in a Malagasy mayoral race. 
He was elected with 45 per cent of the votes. His tenure stretched from December 1999 to his ascent to the Presidential office in May 2002. During his time as mayor, he balanced the city&#x27;s budget and improved its water quality and waste management, and drew criticism for an urban-restoration project that demolished houses that were still being lived in. He has been described as one of the most popular mayors in Antananarivo&#x27;s history.

== Presidency ==
=== Presidential election of 2001 ===

Ravalomanana ran for president in the election to be held on 16 December. His campaign promoted his image as a self-made man who would draw upon his business to develop the country and played upon his youth (aged 52) and his non-alliance with the elderly &quot;political dinosaurs&quot; who had dominated politics over the previous three decades. His origins as a village farmer inspired support among rural voters, who made up over four-fifths of the population. Many voters wished to see established in Madagascar in place of corrupt power networks dominated by nepotism. The Council of Christian Churches of Madagascar (FFKM) rallied behind Ravalomanana.

Ravalomanana&#x27;s announcement sparked retaliatory actions by the Ratsiraka administration, resulting in frequent defamatory attacks in the press and a court judgment fining him 300 billion Malagasy francs (55.6 million Euros) in relation to his management of Tiko, which were later settled out of court. These attacks were denounced by spokesmen for Ravalomanana&#x27;s campaign, &quot;Tiako iMadagasikara&quot; (TIM), and in speeches the candidate delivered in urban and rural areas across the island, by his considerable personal wealth and the airplane and seven helicopters registered to Tiko.

October 2001 polls showed Ravalomanana ahead of Ratsiraka. Following the December election, official results put Ravalomanana in first place, with 46 per cent, against Ratsiraka&#x27;s 40 per cent; without a majority. Ravalomanana, claiming to have won a majority in the first round, refused to participate in a run-off and after a recount, on 29 April 2002 the High Constitutional Court declared that Ravalomanana had won 51.3 percent of the vote, enough for a narrow first-round victory. The court&#x27;s decision was contested by Ratsiraka and his supporters. Some Ratsiraka supporters, mostly of the Betsimisaraka people, cut off routes from the port city of Tamative to the mostly Merina Antananarivo, initiating a months-long period of sporadic ethnic and political violence until Ratsiraka&#x27;s July 2002 concession of the race and exile to France.

=== First term ===

Upon election to the presidency, Ravalomanana sought to mitigate the negative economic impact of the eight-month political standoff with Ratsiraka, which had cost Madagascar millions of dollars He enacted a series of new laws, policies and reforms that sought to efface remaining traces of Ratsiraka&#x27;s socialist ideology and replace it with a firmly capitalist, market-driven economic environment. The new head of state moved away from reliance on its principal trading partner, France, and cultivated relationships with partners such as Germany, the United States and South Korea as part of his strategy for Madagascar&#x27;s economic development.
In 2004 the World Bank approved his administration&#x27;s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, entitled &quot;Madagascar Naturellement&quot; (Madagascar Naturally).

The protected natural areas were tripled on the island from to – ten per cent of the country&#x27;s land surface – over five years. In 2004 he established the &quot;Bureau Indépendant Anti-Corruption&quot; (BIANCO), leading to a decline in government corruption. 
That same year, the International Monetary Fund agreed to write off half Madagascar&#x27;s debt. In 2005 Madagascar became the first country to benefit from the Millennium Challenge Account, a new development fund managed by the United States.

Consequently, the economy grew at an average annual rate of seven per cent throughout his presidency. Under his administration, hundreds of kilometers of roads were paved in formerly isolated rural areas. Dramatic improvements in education and health were also achieved under his administration., thousands of new primary schools and additional classrooms were constructed, older buildings were renovated and tens of thousands of new primary teachers were recruited and trained. Primary school fees were eliminated and kits containing basic school supplies were distributed to primary students. Logging in protected areas was outlawed until January 2009.

Also after being elected in 2002, Ravalomanana remained a prominent player in the private sector. The 2003 privatisation of SINPA (&quot;Societe d&#x27;lnteret National Malgache des Produits Agricoles&quot;), the state agricultural corporation, and SOMACODIS (&quot;Société Malgache de Collecte et de Distribution&quot;), the national trading corporation, provided Ravalomanana the opportunity to purchase both entities, which he incorporated under Tiko. He also created a public roads construction company, &quot;Asa Lalana Malagasy&quot;.

The benefits of economic growth during the Ravalomanana administration were not evenly distributed, leading to higher costs of living for all Malagasy and a deepening poverty among much of the population with fewer able to increase their wealth. Detractors indicate a decline in purchasing power and dramatic inflation early in Ravalomanana&#x27;s presidency as evidence of a failure to reduce poverty. Ravalomanana&#x27;s critics remarked that the greatest beneficiary of his reforms and policies was the president himself, giving the example of road construction projects that enabled Tiko to distribute more efficiently as well as the farmers and other small businesspeople targeted by the initiative. Furthermore, his own companies tended to be awarded most of the government contracts for which they bid, although this occurred transparently and legally, due to a weak legal framework around conflict of interest. Critics condemned his tendency to make unilateral decisions and disregard the views of his entourage, a number of whom resigned or were dismissed. Many joined an opposition movement that had gained considerable strength by late 2007.

On 18 November 2006, Ravalomanana&#x27;s jet was forced to divert from Madagascar&#x27;s capital during a return trip from Europe following reports of a coup underway in Antananarivo and shooting near the airport. The attempted coup by General Andrianafidisoa was ultimately unsuccessful.

=== Presidential election of 2006 ===

Ravalomanana ran for a second term in the presidential election held on 3 December 2006. According to official results, he won the election with 54.79 per cent of the vote in the first round. In Antananarivo Province he won 75.39 per cent of voters.

=== Second term ===
During his second term, Ravalomanana oversaw revisions to the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Renamed the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP), this new strategy was intended to build on the successes of his first term to accelerate and expand national development. The plan focused on &quot;the eight commitments&quot;: accountable governance, more extensive and interconnected infrastructure, agriculture based rural development, family planning and health (particularly fighting HIV/AIDS), strong economic growth, environmental protection, and the traditional principle of &quot;fihavanana&quot; (solidarity). The plan&#x27;s targets were aligned with the United Nations&#x27; Millennium Development Goals.

As construction of schools and hiring of teachers continued in Ravalomanana&#x27;s second term, additional measures were adopted to improve education quality, including a shift to Malagasy as the language of instruction in grades one to five, expansion of primary schools to house grades six and seven for greater access to lower secondary schooling In the Constitution of 2007, English was added to Malagasy and French as an official language.

In the later half of his second term, Ravalomanana was criticized by domestic and international observers, who accused him of increasing authoritarianism and corruption.

=== Confrontation with Rajoelina ===
On 13 December 2008, the government closed Viva TV, owned by mayor of Antananarivo Andry Rajoelina, stating that a Viva interview with exiled former head of state Didier Ratsiraka was &quot;likely to disturb peace and security&quot;. This move catalyzed the political opposition and a public already dissatisfied with other recent actions undertaken by Ravalomanana, including a July 2008 deal with Daewoo Logistics to lease half the island&#x27;s arable land for South Korean cultivation of corn and palm oil, and the November 2008 purchase of a second presidential jet at a cost of 60 million U.S. dollars. Within a week, Rajoelina met with twenty of Madagascar&#x27;s most prominent opposition leaders (referred in the press as the &quot;Club of 20&quot;), to develop a joint statement demanding that the Ravalomanana administration improves its adherence to democratic principles. The demand was broadcast at a press conference, where Rajoelina promised to dedicate a politically open public space in the capital, which he would call &quot;Place de la democratie&quot; (&quot;Democracy Square&quot;).

Beginning in January 2009, Rajoelina led a series of political rallies in downtown Antananarivo where he gave voice to the frustration that Ravalomanana&#x27;s policies had triggered, particularly among the economically marginalized and members of the political opposition. On 3 February, Ravalomanana dismissed Rajoelina as mayor of Antananarivo and appointed a special delegation. Rajoelina incited demonstrators on 7 February to occupy the president&#x27;s office. The presidential guard opened fire on the advancing crowd, killing 31 and wounding more than 200.

Popular disapproval of Ravalomanana intensified, conflicts between pro-Rajoelina demonstrators and security forces continued over the following weeks, resulting in several additional deaths.
On 11 March, following a declaration of neutrality by army leadership, pro-opposition soldiers from the Army stormed the army headquarters and forced the army chief of staff to resign. Over the next several days the army deployed forces to enable the opposition to occupy key ministries, the chief of military police transferred his loyalty to Rajoelina and the army sent tanks against the presidential Iavoloha Palace. Rajoelina rejected Ravalomanana&#x27;s offer on 15 March to hold a national referendum. The following day, the army stormed the Ambohitsorohitra Palace and captured the Central Bank. Hours later, Ravalomanana transferred his power to a group of senior army personnel. Ravalomanana later declared he had been forced at gunpoint to relinquish power. A military council would have been charged with organizing elections within 24 months and re-writing the constitution for the &quot;Fourth Republic&quot;. However, Vice Admiral Hyppolite Ramaroson announced on 18 March that the council would transfer power directly to Rajoelina, making him president of the opposition-dominated High Transitional Authority (HAT) that he had appointed weeks earlier.

With the military&#x27;s backing Rajoelina was sworn in as president on 21 March at Mahamasina Municipal Stadium before a crowd of 40,000 supporters, a transfer of power that was considered illegitimate and unconstitutional by the international community and described as a coup d&#x27;état.

== Post-presidency ==
After coming to power, Rajoelina&#x27;s HAT pursued legal action against Ravalomanana. On 2 June 2009, Ravalomanana was fined 70 million US dollars (42 million British pounds) and sentenced to four years in prison for alleged abuse of office which, according to HAT Justice Minister Christine Razanamahasoa, included the December 2008 purchase of a presidential jet worth $60 million. Razanamahasoa claimed Ravalomanana &quot;mixed public interests with his personal interests&quot;.

===Exile===
The former head of state was in exile in Swaziland at the time, having been prevented from returning to Madagascar the previous month. Additionally, on 28 August, Ravalomanana was sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot; to hard labour for life for his role in the protests and ensuing deaths. 
Ravalomanana&#x27;s Tiko Group faced heavy pressure from the transitional government, which in April 2009 demanded that the company pay 35 million US dollars in back taxes or risk being shut down.

Both Ravalomanana and Rajoelina were requested by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to renounce participation in the 2013 Malagasy presidential elections in order to end the ongoing political crisis. On 10 December 2012, Ravalomanana announced that he would not participate in the elections, and encouraged Rajoelina to follow.

===Presidential elections 2018 ===

Marc Ravalomanana was candidate at the Malagasy presidential elections 2018. 
He qualified for the 2nd round, with 35,35 % of the votes. The 2nd round he lost with 44.34% of votes against Andry Rajoelina with 55,66 % of the votes.

===Presidential elections 2023 ===

Marc Ravalomanana ran as a candidate at the 2023 Malagasy presidential elections.

== Other activities ==
Ravalomanana is a fervent Christian. As a young adult he gradually took on increasingly responsible leadership roles within his church community. In 2000 he was elected vice-president of the FJKM.

Ravalomanana owns media group Malagasy Broadcasting System (MBS), which operates radio and television stations.

<text>Zeta Puppis (ζ Puppis, abbreviated Zeta Pup, ζ Pup), formally named Naos , is the brightest star in the constellation of Puppis.

The spectral class of O4 means this is one of the hottest, and most luminous, stars visible to the naked eye. It is one of the sky&#x27;s few naked-eye class O-type stars as well as one of the closest to Earth. It is a blue supergiant, one of the most luminous stars in the Milky Way. Visually it is over 10,000 times brighter than the Sun, but its high temperature means that most of its radiation is in the ultraviolet and its bolometric luminosity is over 500,000 times that of the Sun. It is also the 72nd brightest star in terms of apparent magnitude from Earth. It is a runaway star, meaning it has an unusually large space velocity, probably caused by being ejected from a close binary system when its companion exploded as a supernova.

Zeta Puppis is typical of O-type stars in having an extremely strong stellar wind, measured at 2,500 km/s, which sees the star shed more than a millionth of its mass each year, or about 10 million times that shed by the Sun over a comparable time period.

==Nomenclature==
&quot;ζ Puppis&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Zeta Puppis&quot;) is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation.

It bears the name &quot;Naos&quot;, from the Greek &quot;ναύς&quot; &quot;ship&quot;, and in Arabic &quot;Suhail Hadar&quot; (سُهَيْل حَضَار). In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name &quot;Naos&quot; for this star on 21 August 2016 and it is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

==Namesake==
USS Naos (AK-105) was a United States Navy Crater class cargo ship named after the star.

==Physical characteristics==

Zeta Puppis has been extensively studied because of the rarity of such hot massive stars and its relative closeness to Earth, but its physical parameters and distance are still poorly known. It would be a valuable step on the cosmic distance ladder, clarifying the distance of other high luminosity stars in the Milky Way galaxy and external galaxies.

The spectral type is O4If(n)p. O4 indicates a hot massive hydrogen-burning star, typically 40,000–44,000K. The &quot;f&quot; indicates that the spectrum has emission lines of ionised Helium and Nitrogen, not uncommon in somewhat evolved hot O stars and typically identified by the composite emission and absorption profile of the 468.6nm HeII spectral line. The &quot;n&quot; (for nebulous) indicates broadened absorption lines, caused by rapid rotation of the star, in this case over 220 km/s at the equator. The &quot;p&quot; is a general spectral indicator of peculiarity. This combination of spectral characters is unusual because evolved hot stars are expected to rotate relatively slowly after braking by a strong stellar wind, and only 8 stars of this type are known in the Milky Way. The spectral type complicates determination of physical parameters as the standard spectral luminosity indicator lines are peculiar and this type of star cannot be fully modelled. The enhanced Helium and Nitrogen and the lower surface gravity indicates some degree of evolution away from the zero age main sequence and Zeta Puppis is ranked as a supergiant.

The angular size of Zeta Puppis has been measured interferometrically to be 0.41 mas, and photometrically to be 0.38 mas.

==Variability==

The brightness of Zeta Puppis varies slightly but regularly. Its apparent magnitude varies between a peak of 2.24 and a minimum of 2.26 over 1.78 days. The variations had been thought to be the due to the pulsations of an α Cygni variable, but are too predictable and regular. The eclipse-like light curve is now thought to be due to rotation of the star which has large irregular features at the base of its dense stellar wind.

It also shows variations in Hα spectral line profiles and x-ray luminosity on timescales less than a day.

==Distance==
The distance of Zeta Puppis is disputed, most commonly being considered to be based on its Hipparcos parallax, or based on its expected physical properties. Its association with objects such as the Gum nebula and γ2 Velorum is also used as a method to establish its distance.

The physical properties of the star depend strongly on its distance, with its bolometric luminosity being at and only about at . Its rotational velocity and period constrain the possible distances and inclination of the star. The rotational period was long considered to be just over five days, being the period of certain variations observed in its spectrum. However, it is now thought that less obvious brightness variations with a period of 1.78 days are caused by bright areas on the surface of the star as it rotates. With the projected equatorial rotational velocity of , this means that the star is rotating at close to its break-up velocity and that the equator must be inclined less than about 33° to us.

==Helium==
In 1896, Williamina Fleming observed mysterious spectral lines from Zeta Puppis, which fit the Rydberg formula if half-integers were used instead of whole integers. It was later found that these were due to ionized helium.

==Origin==
Early suggestions for the birthplace of Zeta Puppis were the very young Vela R2 stellar association at around 800pc and the Vela OB2 association at 450pc. Neither origin is satisfactory. A distance of 800pc requires an abnormally high luminosity, while the Vela OB2 association is much older than Zeta Puppis and the space velocity does not lead back to that cluster.

Many physical models and the original Hipparcos parallax measurements did lead to a distance value of around 450pc, but the revised Hipparcos reduction gave a much lower distance near 333pc. A recent dynamical study points to Zeta Puppis originating in the Trumpler 10 OB association at around 300pc, but this is also a much older cluster and physical models still lead to a distance of 450-600pc.

Zeta Puppis shows a high space velocity and very high rotation rate, and it has been speculated that it is a runaway star resulting from a supernova in a binary system, possibly the progenitor of the Gum Nebula. Models of binary systems are able to reproduce the properties of Zeta Puppis following mass transfer from a companion which then exploded as a supernova. This can explain the observed properties which are inconsistent with single star evolution.

<text>The buff-breasted sandpiper (Calidris subruficollis) is a small shorebird. The species name &quot;subruficollis&quot; is from Latin &quot;subrufus&quot;, &quot;reddish&quot; (from &quot;sub&quot;, &quot;somewhat&quot;, and &quot;rufus&quot;, &quot;rufous&quot;) and &quot;collis&quot;, &quot;-necked/-throated&quot; (from &quot;collum&quot;, &quot;neck&quot;). It is a calidrid sandpiper.

==Description==
This species is brown above and has a buff face and underparts in all plumages. It has a short bill and yellow legs. Males are larger than females. Juveniles resemble the adults but may be paler on the rear underparts.

==Distribution and habitat==

&quot;C. subruficollis&quot; breeds in the open arctic tundra of North America and is a very long-distance migrant, spending the non-breeding season mainly in South America, especially Argentina.

It migrates mainly through central North America and is uncommon on the coasts. It occurs as a regular wanderer in Western Europe and is not classed as rare in Great Britain or Ireland, where small flocks have occurred. Only the pectoral sandpiper is a more common American shorebird visitor to Europe.

This species nests as far north as Canada including Alaska on the ground, laying four eggs. The male has a display which includes raising the wings to display the white undersides, which is also given on migration, sometimes when no other buff-breasted sandpipers are present. Outside the breeding season, this bird is normally found in short-grass habitats such as airfields or golf courses, rather than near water.

These birds pick up food by sight, mainly eating insects and other invertebrates. The buff-breasted sandpipers are known to prey on &quot;Bombus polaris&quot;, a species of bumblebee found within the Arctic Circle. They will either eat the bees or feed them to their young. They are often very tame.

Buff-breasted sandpipers are suspected to have hybridized with the white-rumped or Baird&#x27;s sandpiper.

===In South Asia and Australia===
This species has been sighted in South Asia on at least three occasions. It is believed that instead of going to Argentina, this bird might have been wind-blown from the Great Plains Flyway of North America and landed up in South Asia. In November 2011, this species was sighted near Kannur, Kerala in South India. The buff-breasted sandpiper has also been recorded in Australia on at least eight occasions. It was recorded again from Madayipara, Kannur in 2023.

In 1978, Phillips recorded the species from Sri Lanka, and after that, very few sightings were recorded. In 2001 a single bird was also recorded in Marievale, South Africa.

<text>Stephen Hales (17 September 16774 January 1761) was an English clergyman who made major contributions to a range of scientific fields including botany, pneumatic chemistry and physiology. He was the first person to measure blood pressure. He also invented several devices, including a ventilator, a pneumatic trough and a surgical forceps for the removal of bladder stones. In addition to these achievements, he was a philanthropist and wrote a popular tract on alcoholic intemperance.

==Life==
Stephen Hales was born in Bekesbourne, Kent, England. He was the sixth son of Thomas Hales, heir to Baronetcy of Beakesbourne and Brymore, and his wife, Mary (née Wood), and was one of twelve or possibly thirteen children. Thomas Hales (died 1692) predeceased his father, Sir Robert Hales; therefore Sir Robert&#x27;s grandson, Sir Thomas Hales, 2nd Baronet (Stephen Hales&#x27; brother) succeeded to the baronetcy in December 1693.

Hales was educated in Kensington and then at Orpington before attending Corpus Christi College, Cambridge (or St Benedict&#x27;s as it was then known) in 1696. Although he was an ordinand studying divinity, Hales would have received his degree in the Classics, mathematics, natural sciences and philosophy while in Cambridge. Hales was admitted as a Fellow of Corpus Christi in 1703, the same year as he obtained the degree of Master of Arts, and was ordained as Deacon at Bugden, Cambridgeshire. He continued his theological and other studies in Cambridge, where he became friends with William Stukeley who was studying medicine. He attended chemistry lectures by Giovanni Francisco Vigani while at Cambridge. His interest in biology, botany and physiology is presumed to date from that time.

In 1709 he was ordained Priest at Fulham and on 10 August 1709 he was appointed Perpetual curate of the parish of Teddington, Middlesex and left Cambridge, although he retained his Fellowship until 1718. He became a Bachelor of Divinity in 1711. Hales remained in Teddington for the rest of his life, except for occasional visits to his other parishes. He was an assiduous minister – in addition to parish duties he enlarged and repaired the church and commissioned a new water supply for the village – and well regarded although there is some evidence that his experimental work on animal physiology was viewed with misgivings. Thomas Twining included a verse in his poem The Boat on Hales:
:Green Teddington&#x27;s serene retreat
:For Philosophic studies meet,
:Where the good Pastor Stephen Hales
:Weighed moisture in a pair of scales,
:To lingering death put Mares and Dogs,
:And stripped the Skins from living Frogs,
:Nature, he loved, her Works intent
:To search or sometimes to torment.
In 1718, the poet Alexander Pope, a renowned dog lover, also criticized Hales&#x27;s work. In conversation with his friend, Joseph Spence, Pope reportedly said of Hales: &quot;He commits most of these barbarities with the thought of its being of use to man. But how do we know that we have a right to kill creatures that we are so little above as dogs, for our curiosity, or even for some use to us?&quot;. Pope, however was also a close friend of Hales and considered him the model of the man who loves his God.

In 1718 Hales was elected a fellow of the Royal Society and in the same year became rector of Porlock, Somerset, a post he held alongside the curacy of Teddington.

In 1720 he married Mary Newce, but she died the following year, probably in childbirth; there were no children and he never remarried. In 1723 he was installed as rector of Farringdon, Hampshire (which he held alongside Teddington by employing a curate in Farringdon). Hales spent his summers there and became a friend of Gilbert White, the naturalist, whose family lived nearby.

Hales&#x27;s fame as a scientist grew from 1718 onwards, and by the mid part of the 18th century he had achieved an international reputation. He was one of the eight Foreign Members of the Royal Academy of Sciences, Paris and was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences of Bologna. He received the Copley Medal in 1739 and also became a public figure as a result of his campaigns against the gin trade and his involvement in the Georgia Trust. He was made a Doctor of Divinity by Oxford University in 1733.

In his later years he received frequent visits from Frederick, Prince of Wales and his wife, Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, both of whom were interested in gardening and botany. He gave Princess Augusta advice on the development of Kew Gardens, and in 1751 he was appointed Clerk of the Closet to the Princess Dowager, following the death of Prince Frederick, a post he held until his death.

At the age of seventy Hales was chosen by the president and fellows of the Royal College of Physicians to preach the annual Crounian Sermon in the church of St Mary-le-Bow. He selected his favorite topic – &quot;The Wisdom and Goodness of God in the formation of Man&quot;. Hales died in his 84th year at Teddington on 4 January 1761 after a short illness. At his own request he was buried under the tower of the church where he had worked for so many years. A monument to Hales was raised by Princess Augusta in the south transept of Westminster Abbey after his death.

==Work ==
Hales is best known for his &quot;Statical Essays&quot;. The first volume, &quot;Vegetable Staticks&quot; (1727), contains an account of experiments in plant physiology and chemistry; it was translated into French by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1735 and into Italian by Maria Angela Ardinghelli in Naples in 1750-1752. The second volume, &quot;Haemastaticks&quot; (1733), describes experiments on animal physiology including the measurement of the &quot;force of the blood&quot;, i.e. blood pressure. Translated and annotated by Ardinghelli in 1756.

===Plant physiology and the chemistry of air===

In &quot;Vegetable Staticks&quot;, Hales studied transpiration – the loss of water from the leaves of plants. He estimated the surface area of the leaves of the plant and the length and surface area of the roots. This allowed Hales to compare the calculated influx of water into the plant with the amount of water leaving the plant by transpiration through the leaves. He also measured &#x27;the force of the sap&#x27; or root pressure. Hales commented that &quot;plants very probably draw through their leaves some part of their nourishment from the air&quot;. In Vegetable Staticks Hales prefigured the cohesion theory of water movement in plants, although his ideas were not understood at the time, so he did not influence the debate on water transport in plants in the 19th century. He also speculated that plants might use light as a source of energy for growth (i.e. photosynthesis), based on Isaac Newton&#x27;s suggestion that &quot;gross bodies and light&quot; might be interconvertible.

In &quot;Vegetable Staticks&quot; Hales also described experiments that showed that &quot;... air freely enters plants, not only with the principal fund of nourishment by the roots, but also thro&#x27; the surface of their trunks and leaves&quot;. While Hales&#x27; work on the chemistry of air appears primitive by modern standards, its importance was acknowledged by Antoine Lavoisier, the discoverer of oxygen. Hales&#x27; invention of the pneumatic trough to collect gases over water is also considered a major technical advance. Modified forms of the pneumatic trough were later used by William Brownrigg, Henry Cavendish and Joseph Priestley in their research.

===Animal physiology===
Hales began his work on animal physiology with William Stuckeley while in Cambridge, although much of it was published only after &quot;Vegetable Staticks&quot; appeared. Hales and Stuckeley performed a wide range of studies including making casts of the trachea and bronchial trees of dogs using molten lead and measuring the water lost due to breathing. Most famously, Hales made measurements of blood pressure in several animal species by inserting fine tubes into arteries and measuring the height to which the column of blood rose. Hales also described the effects of hemorrhage and hemorrhagic shock by progressive exsanguination of animals and accompanying measurement of blood pressure. In a horse he observed that as death approached &quot;the Mare fell into cold and clammy sweats&quot;. In addition, Hales took wax casts of the ventricle of the heart and estimated how much blood was pumped by the heart; correctly described the roles of the mitral valve and aortic valve during systole and diastole; explained the pulsations of arteries in terms of their elasticity and attributed the resistance to blood flow to friction due to the passage of blood through small blood vessels.

Hales also described a diverse range of work in &quot;Haemastaticks&quot; including his attempts to find substances that could be used to dissolve bladder stones or calculi. This aim was unsuccessful but as part of this work he developed a double lumen bladder catheter and devised special forceps to enable the removal of urinary stones.

Hales&#x27;s work on the growth pattern of long bones, demonstrating epiphyseal growth; his demonstration of spinal reflexes in the frog and his suggestion that electricity played a role in allowing nerves to control muscle function are also noteworthy.

===Inventions and other work===

Bad air was thought to be a cause of ill-health and death in the 18th century. Death and disease were common in overcrowded ships and prisons. Hales was one of several people in the early 18th century (other notable inventors being John Theophilus Desaguliers, Mårten Triewald and Samuel Sutton) who developed forms of ventilators to improve air quality. Hales&#x27; ventilators were large bellows, usually worked by hand, although larger versions were powered by windmills. They were widely installed in ships, prisons and mines and were successful in reducing disease, and aerating the lower decks of Royal Navy vessels to combat dry rot in the hulls. Hales&#x27; ventilators were also used in preserving foods and drying grain.

Hales also experimented with ways of distilling fresh water from sea water; preserving water and meat on sea-voyages; measuring depths at sea; measuring high temperatures; and wrote on a range of subjects including earthquakes; methods of preventing the spread of fires; and comparative mortality rates in relationship to rural and urban parishes.

===Philanthropy===
 After the death of his wife, Hales became increasingly involved in philanthropic causes. In 1722 he became a corresponding member of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, founded by Thomas Bray. In 1723 Bray became ill and appointed trustees, including Hales, to administer a bequest from Abel Tassin, Sieur d’Allone for &#x27;The Conversion of Negroes Slaves in the West Indies&#x27;. Subsequently, Hales was also appointed a trustee for Bray&#x27;s legacy for establishing parochial libraries in the American colonies. These charities became incorporated into a scheme led by James Oglethorpe to establish a charitable colony for the poor, &#x27;honest industrious debtors&#x27; and persecuted (Protestant) foreigners. Hales may well have felt a personal commitment to this scheme since his brothers had been imprisoned for debt following the failure of the South Sea Company and one, William, died of Gaol Fever in Newgate Prison.

In 1732 King George II granted a Charter for the foundation of the colony of Georgia and Hales was one of the twenty one members of the Board of Trustees. The colony of Georgia was notable for its prohibition of slavery and rum.

As a result of his involvement with the Board of Trustees of Georgia, Hales learnt of the problems resulting from overcrowding of ships and this spurred him to invent a ship ventilator and undertake experiments to distil fresh water from sea water and to use salt to preserve meat on board ship.

Hales was one of the co-founders of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (later the Royal Society of Arts) conceived by William Shipley. Hales was also active in the movement to promote the Gin Act 1736. He wrote a number of anonymous tracts against the consumption of gin and distilled spirits, most notably &#x27;A Friendly Admonition to the Drinker of Brandy and other Distilled Spirituous Liquors&#x27;. and also lobbied Parliament. Hales was not opposed to all alcoholic beverages but felt strongly that spirits, and gin in particular, were as he termed it &#x27;The Bane of the Nation&#x27;.

== Testimony ==
 From the Nobel Prize in Medicine acceptance speech given by Werner Forssmann in 1956:
The genus of trees &quot;Halesia&quot; was named after him by John Ellis in 1759. The American Society of Plant Biologists awards the Stephen Hales Prize annually to a scientist for work in plant biology.

<doc id="393545" wikidata="Q317107" url="?curid=393545" title="Bakili Muluzi">
<text>Elson Bakili Muluzi (born 17 March 1943) is a Malawian politician who was President of Malawi from 1994 to 2004. He was also chairman of the United Democratic Front (UDF) until 2009. He succeeded Hastings Kamuzu Banda as Malawi&#x27;s president. He also served in Banda&#x27;s cabinet as minister without portfolio, before retiring in 1980.

Muluzi served as minister and secretary general of the Malawi Congress Party for years until he was dismissed for abusing MCP party funds.

==Presidency==
Muluzi was the candidate of the opposition UDF in the May 1994 presidential election, the country&#x27;s first multiparty election. He won the election with 47% of the vote, defeating Malawi&#x27;s leader since independence, Hastings Kamuzu Banda. There was no provision for a runoff election in Malawi, so this was enough for him to end Banda&#x27;s 33-year rule (dating back to when Malawi was still a British colony).

He was re-elected in June 1999, taking 52.4% of the vote and defeating challenger Gwanda Chakuamba who was the leader of the opposition movement. In 2002 he proposed an amendment to Malawi&#x27;s constitution that would have allowed him to run for a third term, but this was abandoned in the face of demonstrations against him, as well as vigorous opposition from the legislature and courts. After serving two terms, he therefore handed over power to his successor after the May 2004 election, in which UDF candidate Bingu wa Mutharika (who was handpicked and groomed by Muluzi) was elected to succeed Muluzi as president.

Muluzi came to lead the UDF after leaving the Banda government, and he became an advocate for democracy. Muluzi&#x27;s time as president was marred by controversy and scandal, particularly due to the sale of Malawi&#x27;s reserves of maize to other countries shortly before the onset of a drought, which resulted in famine throughout the country. Despite international pressure, the millions of dollars realized from the sale of Malawi&#x27;s food reserves have never been turned over, and it is widely suspected that it wound up in foreign accounts belonging to Muluzi and his supporters.

==Post-presidency==
Even with the controversy and questionable dealings, Muluzi was a popular leader, particularly in the southern part of the country. He remained the chairman of the UDF. After a dispute with his successor as president, Mutharika, the latter left the UDF and formed his own party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), in February 2005. In April 2005, Muluzi apologized to Malawians for choosing Mutharika as his successor &quot;and imposing him on the country&quot;.

On July 27, 2006, Muluzi was arrested on fraud and corruption charges; he was released on bail later that day. Hours after his arrest, the chief investigator Gustav Kaliwo was suspended by President Mutharika; Director of Public Prosecutions Ishmael Wadi said he had no choice but to drop the charges. Muluzi was once more arrested on 26 February 2009 and initially charged with 86 counts of corruption and abuse of office. The charges claimed that he had allegedly diverted 1.7 billion Malawi Kwacha (US$11m) of donor money into his personal account, funds that came from, among others, the Republic of China, the Kingdom of Morocco and Libya.

As a former Commonwealth leader, Muluzi was invited by the Commonwealth Secretary-General to chair the Commonwealth Observer Group which observed the 2012 general election in Lesotho.

===2009 presidential candidacy===
In early March 2007, with many prominent members of the UDF calling for Muluzi to run for president in 2009, the party said that he would have until March 11 to declare whether he intended to run. Accordingly, on that date Muluzi announced that he would seek the party&#x27;s nomination as its presidential candidate. The question of whether Muluzi is eligible to run again has raised some controversy. Because the constitution refers to a limit of two consecutive terms, this could be regarded as enabling Muluzi to run again after being out of office for a term.

The Chairman of the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB), Alex Nampota, announced on March 17, 2008, that the ACB intended to prosecute Muluzi for allegedly diverting about 11 million dollars of donor money into his personal account; Nampota said that the ACB had asked the courts to lift an injunction that prevented it from questioning Muluzi. Kennedy Makwangwala, the Secretary-General of the UDF, denounced this as &quot;political persecution&quot;.

On April 24, 2008, a UDF convention chose Muluzi as the party&#x27;s 2009 presidential candidate. He received 1,950 votes against 38 for Vice-president Cassim Chilumpha.

On March 20, 2009, the Malawi Electoral Commission passed a judgement to bar Bakili Muluzi from running for the presidency for the third time. Muluzi challenged this, but on May 16, only three days before the election, the Constitutional Court ruled that Muluzi could not run again. By that point, Muluzi and the UDF had thrown their support behind the candidacy of John Tembo, the president of the Malawi Congress Party (MCP).

Muluzi announced on December 23, 2009, that he was retiring from active politics and that Friday Jumbe was replacing him as UDF leader.

===2008 arrest===
After Mutharika formed the DPP in 2005, over 70 Members of Parliament joined the DPP; the opposition, including the UDF, has sought to have these MPs expelled from their seats for switching parties. In May 2008, Mutharika said that Muluzi was trying to remove him from office by depriving the DPP MPs of their seats; to press its demand for the removal of the DPP MPs, the opposition had refused to debate any government bills. Mutharika called Muluzi a &quot;coward&quot; and accused him of treason. Speaking on Joy Radio, a station he owns, on May 12, 2008, Muluzi denied any plot against Mutharika and expressed exasperation with threats made by Mutharika.

Eight prominent associates of Muluzi were arrested shortly afterward in connection with the alleged plot to overthrow Mutharika; an arrest warrant was also issued for Muluzi, who was in the United Kingdom at the time on holiday. In connection with the investigation into this alleged plot, police attempted to search Muluzi&#x27;s home on May 14, but his guards barred them from entry. According to an aide to Muluzi, Humphrey Mvula, the police said that they wanted to remove guns from the home, but Mvula said that these guns had been issued by the police themselves for Muluzi&#x27;s protection. On the same day, Muluzi said on Joy Radio that he would return to Malawi from the United Kingdom regardless of the alleged plot. By May 25, all but one of the eight arrested associates of Muluzi had been released on bail.

When Muluzi returned on May 25, 2008, he was arrested at the airport in Lilongwe. Muluzi had planned to address a UDF rally upon his arrival, and police surrounded the stadium where the rally was to be held. Thousands of infuriated supporters of Muluzi clashed with the police and blocked roads following his arrest. Muluzi was promptly flown to Blantyre, placed under house arrest at his home in Limbe, near Blantyre, and interrogated. His home was also searched by the police. Muluzi was questioned for about two hours and was shown documents which purportedly linked him to the alleged plot. Speaking on Joy Radio on May 27, Muluzi said that the documents were &quot;laughable and fake&quot; and accused the government of attempting to &quot;intimidate and silence the opposition&quot;. His lawyers said on the same day that they would seek bail for Muluzi. According to one lawyer, the only people allowed into Muluzi&#x27;s home by the police were four lawyers and a bodyguard, and he had been asked to name family members and lawyers who would be given permission to visit.

On May 29, Muluzi, who had still not been charged, appeared at the High Court in Blantyre for his bail application. On his arrival, he declared that the government was &quot;useless&quot;. Fahad Assani, the head of Muluzi&#x27;s legal team, described the arrest as &quot;illegal and unconstitutional&quot; and demanded his release from house arrest. According to Assani, because more than 48 hours had passed and Muluzi had not been charged, it was necessary for him to be released &quot;without any conditions&quot;. Wezi Kayira, the director of public prosecutions, urged the court to reject the bail application, stressing that treason was &quot;a very serious offence which carries a heavy penalty&quot;; he said that investigations were continuing and expressed concern that they &quot;would be jeopardised and evidence tampered with&quot;. Kayira also requested that the court impose &quot;very strict conditions&quot; if it chose to grant bail.

Judge Joseph Manyumgwa granted Muluzi bail on May 30, saying that in the absence of any charges against Muluzi he had to be released. According to Manyumgwa, Muluzi had the right to bail regardless of &quot;the gravity of the alleged offence&quot;. Kayira said the investigation was ongoing and that charges would follow.

===Allegations of intimidation and 2009 legal charges===
Speaking to Capital Radio on 22 February 2009, Muluzi accused the government of using intimidation against his presidential candidacy and warned that such conduct could lead to &quot;problems&quot;. A few days later, he was charged by the Anti-Corruption Bureau with stealing 12 million dollars of aid money; he appeared before a court in Blantyre and was released on bail. He appeared in court again on 12 March 2009 but failed to enter a plea on the 86 graft charges against him. Kalekeni Kaphale, a lawyer for Muluzi, asked for a delay, arguing that &quot;this is the first time someone has been charged with such a volume of cases&quot; in Malawi and that, since the defense had not seen the charges until early March, it needed &quot;at least 14 days to study them to make proper responses&quot;.

On 10 July 2014, Muluzi was appointed Special Commonwealth Envoy to Swaziland, an appointment endorsed by the president of Malawi,
Peter Mutharika.

Muluzi was Malawi&#x27;s first Muslim president. He was married to Annie Chidzira Muluzi and then Patricia Shanil Muluzi while in office. After divorcing Annie Muluzi, he remarried Shanil Muluzi. His children include Austin Atupele Muluzi. He is father-in-law to Angela Zachepa.

Muluzi&#x27;s first born daughter, Esme Atweni Muluzi, died after being struck by lightning on 12 December 2016.

Muluzi outlived his wives; Patricia Shanil Muluzi (known by then as Shanil Dzimbiri) died on 10 June 2024 in a plane crash, while Annie Chidzira Muluzi died in 2021 due to lung cancer.

<text>William Buckland DD, FRS (12 March 1784 – 14 August 1856) was an English theologian, geologist and palaeontologist. 

His work in the early 1820s proved that Kirkdale Cave in North Yorkshire had been a prehistoric hyena den, for which he was awarded the Copley Medal. It was praised as an example of how scientific analysis could reconstruct events in the distant past. He pioneered the use of fossilised faeces in reconstructing ecosystems, coining the term coprolites. Buckland also wrote the first full account of a fossil dinosaur, which he named &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; in 1824.

Buckland followed the Gap Theory in interpreting the biblical account of &quot;Genesis&quot; as two widely separated episodes of creation. It had emerged as a way to reconcile the scriptural account with discoveries in geology suggesting the earth was very old. Early in his career Buckland believed he had found evidence of the biblical flood, but later saw that the glaciation theory of Louis Agassiz gave a better explanation, and played a significant role in promoting it.

Buckland served as Dean of Westminster from 1845 until his death 1856.

==Early life==
Buckland was born at Axminster in Devon and, as a child, would accompany his father, the Rector of Templeton and Trusham, on his walks where interest in road improvements led to collecting fossil shells, including ammonites, from the Early Jurassic Lias rocks exposed in local quarries.

He was educated first at Blundell&#x27;s School, Tiverton, Devon, and then at Winchester College, from where he won a scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, matriculating in 1801 and graduating BA in 1805. He also attended lectures of John Kidd on mineralogy and chemistry, developed an interest in geology, and carried out field research on strata during his vacations. He went on to obtain his MA degree in 1808, became a Fellow of Corpus Christi in 1809, and was ordained as a priest. He continued to make frequent geological excursions, on horseback, to various parts of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales.

In 1813, Buckland was appointed Reader in mineralogy, in succession to John Kidd, giving lively and popular lectures with increasing emphasis on geology and palaeontology. As an unofficial curator of the Ashmolean Museum, he built up collections, touring Europe and coming into contact with scholars including Georges Cuvier.

== Career, work and discoveries==
=== Rejection of flood geology and Kirkdale Cave ===

In 1818, Buckland was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. That year he persuaded the Prince Regent to endow an additional Readership, this time in Geology and he became the first holder of the new appointment, delivering his inaugural address on 15 May 1819. This was published in 1820 as &quot;Vindiciæ Geologiæ; or the Connexion of Geology with Religion explained&quot;, both justifying the new science of geology and reconciling geological evidence with the biblical accounts of creation and Noah&#x27;s Flood.

At a time when others were coming under the opposing influence of James Hutton&#x27;s theory of uniformitarianism, Buckland developed a new hypothesis that the word &quot;beginning&quot; in Genesis meant an undefined period between the origin of the earth and the creation of its current inhabitants, during which a long series of extinctions and successive creations of new kinds of plants and animals had occurred. Thus, his catastrophism theory incorporated a version of Old Earth creationism or Gap creationism. Buckland believed in a global deluge during the time of Noah but was not a supporter of flood geology as he believed that only a small amount of the strata could have been formed in the single year occupied by the deluge.

From his investigations of fossil bones at Kirkdale Cave, in Yorkshire, he concluded that the cave had actually been inhabited by hyaenas in antediluvian times, and that the fossils were the remains of these hyaenas and the animals they had eaten, rather than being remains of animals that had perished in the Flood and then carried from the tropics by the surging waters, as he and others had at first thought. In 1822 he wrote:

It must already appear probable, from the facts above described, particularly from the comminuted state and apparently gnawed condition of the bones, that the cave in Kirkdale was, during a long succession of years, inhabited as a den of hyaenas, and that they dragged into its recesses the other animal bodies whose remains are found mixed indiscriminately with their own: this conjecture is rendered almost certain by the discovery I made, of many small balls of the solid calcareous excrement of an animal that had fed on bones... It was at first sight recognised by the keeper of the Menagerie at Exeter Change, as resembling, in both form and appearance, the faeces of the spotted or cape hyaena, which he stated to be greedy of bones beyond all other beasts in his care.

While criticised by some, Buckland&#x27;s analysis of Kirkland Cave and other bone caves was widely seen as a model for how careful analysis could be used to reconstruct the Earth&#x27;s past, and the Royal Society awarded Buckland the Copley Medal in 1822 for his paper on Kirkdale Cave. At the presentation the society&#x27;s president, Humphry Davy, said:

by these inquiries, a distinct epoch has, as it were, been established in the history of the revolutions of our globe: a point fixed from which our researches may be pursued through the immensity of ages, and the records of animate nature, as it were, carried back to the time of the creation.

While Buckland&#x27;s analysis convinced him that the bones found in Kirkdale Cave had not been washed into the cave by a global flood, he still believed the thin layer of mud that covered the remains of the hyaena den had been deposited in the subsequent &#x27;Universal Deluge&#x27;. He developed these ideas into his great scientific work &quot;Reliquiæ Diluvianæ, or, Observations on the Organic Remains attesting the Action of a Universal Deluge&quot; which was published in 1823 and became a best seller. However, over the next decade as geology continued to progress Buckland changed his mind. In his famous Bridgewater Treatise, published in 1836, he acknowledged that the biblical account of Noah&#x27;s flood could not be confirmed using geological evidence. By 1840 he was very actively promoting the view that what had been interpreted as evidence of the &#x27;Universal Deluge&#x27; two decades earlier, and subsequently of deep submergence by a new generation of geologists such as Charles Lyell, was in fact evidence of a major glaciation.

===&quot;Megalosaurus&quot;===

He continued to live in Corpus Christi College and, in 1824, he became president of the Geological Society of London. Here he announced the discovery, at Stonesfield, of fossil bones of a giant reptile which he named &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; (&#x27;great lizard&#x27;) and wrote the first full account of what would later be called a dinosaur.

In 1825, Buckland was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. That year he resigned his college fellowship: he planned to take up the living of Stoke Charity in Hampshire but, before he could take up the appointment, he was made a Canon of Christ Church, a rich reward for academic distinction without serious administrative responsibilities.

===Marriage===

In December 1825 he married Mary Morland of Abingdon, Oxfordshire, an accomplished illustrator and collector of fossils. Their honeymoon was a year touring Europe, with visits to famous geologists and geological sites. She continued to assist him in his work, as well as having nine children, five of whom survived to adulthood. His son Frank Buckland became a well known practical naturalist, author, and Inspector of Salmon Fisheries.

On one occasion, Mary helped him decipher footmarks found in a slab of sandstone by covering the kitchen table with paste, while he fetched their pet tortoise and confirmed his intuition, that tortoise footprints matched the fossil marks. His daughter, author Elizabeth Oke Buckland Gordon, wrote a biography of her father that included appendices of positions held by Buckland, his membership in professional societies, and an index of his publications.

===The Red Lady of Paviland===

On 18 January 1823 Buckland walked into Paviland Cave in south Wales, where he discovered a skeleton which he named the Red Lady of Paviland, as he at first supposed it to be the remains of a local prostitute. Although Buckland found the skeleton in Paviland Cave in the same strata as the bones of extinct mammals (including mammoth), Buckland shared the view of Georges Cuvier that no humans had coexisted with any extinct animals, and he attributed the skeleton&#x27;s presence there to a grave having been dug in historical times, possibly by the same people who had constructed some nearby pre-Roman fortifications, into the older layers.

Carbon-data tests have since dated the skeleton, now known to be male as from circa 33,000 years before present (BP).
It is the oldest anatomically modern human found in the United Kingdom.

===Coprolites and the Liassic food chain===
The fossil hunter Mary Anning noticed that stony objects known as &quot;bezoar stones&quot; were often found in the abdominal region of ichthyosaur skeletons found in the Lias formation at Lyme Regis. She also noted that if such stones were broken open they often contained fossilised fish bones and scales, and sometimes bones from small ichthyosaurs. These observations by Anning led Buckland to propose in 1829 that the stones were fossilised faeces. He coined the name coprolite for them; the name came to be the general name for all fossilised faeces.

Buckland also concluded that the spiral markings on the fossils indicated that ichthyosaurs had spiral ridges in their intestines similar to those of modern sharks, and that some of these coprolites were black because the ichthyosaur had ingested ink sacs from belemnites. He wrote a vivid description of the Liassic food chain based on these observations, which would inspire Henry De la Beche to paint &quot;Duria Antiquior&quot;, the first pictorial representation of a scene from the distant past. After De le Beche had a lithographic print made based on his original watercolour, Buckland kept a supply of the prints on hand to circulate at his lectures. He also discussed other similar objects found in other formations, including the fossilised hyena dung he had found in Kirkdale Cave. He concluded:

In all these various formations our Coprolites form records of warfare, waged by successive generations of inhabitants of our planet on one another: the imperishable phosphate of lime, derived from their digested skeletons, has become embalmed in the substance and foundations of the everlasting hills; and the general law of Nature which bids all to eat and be eaten in their turn, is shown to have been co-extensive with animal existence on our globe; the Carnivora in each period of the world&#x27;s history fulfilling their destined office, – to check excess in the progress of life, and maintain the balance of creation.

Buckland had been helping and encouraging Roderick Murchison for some years, and in 1831 was able to suggest a good starting point in South Wales for Murchison&#x27;s researches into the rocks beneath the secondary strata associated with the age of reptiles. Murchison would later name these older strata, characterised by marine invertebrate fossils, as Silurian, after a tribe that had lived in that area centuries earlier. In 1832 Buckland presided over the second meeting of the British Association, which was then held at Oxford.

=== Bridgewater Treatise ===

Buckland was commissioned to contribute one of the set of eight &quot;Bridgewater Treatises&quot;, &quot;On the Power, Wisdom and Goodness of God, as manifested in the Creation&quot;. This took him almost five years&#x27; work and was published in 1836 with the title &quot;Geology and Mineralogy considered with reference to Natural Theology&quot;. His volume included a detailed compendium of his theories of day-age, gap theory and a form of progressive creationism where faunal succession revealed by the fossil record was explained by a series of successive divine creations that prepared the earth for humans. In the introduction he expressed the argument from design by asserting that the families and phyla of biology were &quot;clusters of contrivance&quot;:

The myriads of petrified Remains which are disclosed by the researches of Geology all tend to prove that our Planet has been occupied in times preceding the Creation of the Human Race, by extinct species of Animals and Vegetables, made up, like living Organic Bodies, of &#x27;Clusters of Contrivances,&#x27; which demonstrate the exercise of stupendous Intelligence and Power. They further show that these extinct forms of Organic Life were so closely allied, by Unity in the principles of their construction, to Classes, Orders, and Families, which make up the existing Animal and Vegetable Kingdoms, that they not only afford an argument of surpassing force, against the doctrines of the Atheist and Polytheist; but supply a chain of connected evidence, amounting to demonstration, of the continuous Being, and of many of the highest Attributes of the One Living and True God.

Following Charles Darwin&#x27;s return from the &quot;Beagle&quot; voyage, Buckland discussed with him the Galapagos land iguanas and Marine iguanas. He subsequently recommended Darwin&#x27;s paper on the role of earthworms in soil formation for publication, praising it as &quot;a new &amp; important theory to explain Phenomena of universal occurrence on the surface of the Earth—in fact a new Geological Power&quot;, while rightly rejecting Darwin&#x27;s suggestion that chalkland could have been formed in a similar way.

=== Glaciation theory ===

By this time Buckland was a prominent and influential scientific celebrity and a friend of the Tory prime minister, Sir Robert Peel. In co-operation with Adam Sedgwick and Charles Lyell, he prepared the report leading to the establishment of the Geological Survey of Great Britain.

Having become interested in the theory of Louis Agassiz, that polished and striated rocks as well as transported material, had been caused by ancient glaciers, he travelled to Switzerland, in 1838, to meet Agassiz and see for himself. He was convinced and was reminded of what he had seen in Scotland, Wales and northern England but had previously attributed to the Flood. When Agassiz came to Britain for the Glasgow meeting of the British Association, in 1840, they went on an extended tour of Scotland and found evidence there of former glaciation. In that year Buckland had become president of the Geological Society again and, despite their hostile reaction to his presentation of the theory, he was now satisfied that glaciation had been the origin of much of the surface deposits covering Britain.

In 1845 he was appointed by Sir Robert Peel to the vacant Deanery of Westminster (he succeeded Samuel Wilberforce). Soon after, he was inducted to the living of Islip, near Oxford, a preferment attached to the deanery. As Dean and head of Chapter, Buckland was involved in repair and maintenance of Westminster Abbey and in preaching suitable sermons to the rural population of Islip, while continuing to lecture on geology at Oxford. In 1847, he was appointed a trustee in the British Museum and, in 1848, he was awarded the Wollaston Medal by the Geological Society of London.

== Illness and death ==
Around the end of 1850, William Buckland contracted a disorder of the neck and brain, and died of it in 1856. Frank Buckland reported that an autopsy showed &quot;the portion of the base of the skull upon which the brain rested, together with the two upper vertebrae of the neck, to be in an advanced state of caries, or decay. The irritation...was quite sufficient cause to give rise to all symptoms.&quot; Frank Buckland attributed the cause of death of both his parents to a severe accident years earlier.

The plot for William&#x27;s grave had been reserved, but when the gravedigger set to work, it was found that an outcrop of solid Jurassic limestone lay just below ground level and explosives had to be used for excavation. This may have been a last jest by the noted geologist, reminiscent of Richard Whately&#x27;s &quot;Elegy intended for Professor Buckland&quot; written in 1820:

==Known eccentricities==
Buckland preferred to do his field palaeontology and geological work wearing an academic gown. His lectures were notable for their dramatic delivery. When he lectured indoors he would bring his presentations to life by imitating the movements of the dinosaurs under discussion. Buckland&#x27;s passion for scientific observation and experiment extended to his home, where he had a table inlaid with dinosaur coprolites. The original table top is exhibited at the Lyme Regis Museum.

Not only was William Buckland&#x27;s home filled with specimens – animal as well as mineral, live as well as dead – but he claimed to have eaten his way through the animal kingdom. Reportedly according to an anecdote recounted by Augustus Hare, the most distasteful animals Buckland consumed were in his opinion mole and bluebottle fly. Ostrich, hedgehogs, mice, frogs and snails, were among other animals reportedly served to guests. Buckland was followed in this hobby by his son Frank.

One story recounted by Peter Lund Simmonds in 1859 reports that Buckland served soup to his guests before claiming that it was an alligator that he had dissected earlier that day, to the guests significant discomfort. When asked if he had really served an alligator, he reportedly responded &quot;as good a calf&#x27;s head as ever wore a coronet&quot;.

According to one story, Buckland consumed, perhaps unintentionally, a portion of the mummified heart of the French King Louis XIV during a dinner at Nuneham House, though the veracity of this particular story has been questioned. The Louis XIV heart story goes back at least as far as an 1863 book by Nathaniel Hawthorne&quot;.&quot;

Charles Darwin criticised Buckland for his behaviour in his autobiography, saying that &quot;Buckland, who though very good-humoured and good-natured, seemed to me a vulgar and almost coarse man. He was incited more by a craving for notoriety, which sometimes made him act like a buffoon, than by a love of science.&quot; 

==Legacy==

Dorsum Buckland, a wrinkle ridge on the Moon, is named after him. Buckland Island (known today as Ani-Jima), in the Bonin Islands (Ogasawara-Jima), was named after him by Captain Beechey on 9 June 1827. In 1846, William Buckland was rector of St. Nicholas in Islip and is commemorated on a plaque in the south aisle of the church and the &quot;East Window&quot; was dedicated to the memory of Buckland and his wife in 1861. A plaque is dedicated to him near his summer home by the Old Rectory, The Walk, Islip (10 August 2008). There is also a bust by Henry Weekes in the south aisle at Westminster Abbey.

In 1972, botanist Heikki Roivainen circumscribed &quot;Bucklandiella&quot;, a genus of moss in the family Grimmiaceae, which was named in his honour. Buckland Peaks in New Zealand&#x27;s Paparoa Range was named after him.

The Iñupiat village of Buckland () in Alaska&#x27;s Northwest Arctic Borough takes its English name from William Buckland, being named by Royal Navy officer Frederick William Beechey in 1826.

<text>Amadou Toumani Touré (4 November 19489 November 2020), also popularly known in Mali by his initials ATT (), was a Malian politician. He supervised Mali&#x27;s first multiparty elections as chairman of the transitional government (1991–1992), and later became the second democratically elected President of Mali (2002–2012).

Touré was head of President Moussa Traoré&#x27;s personal guard (and parachute regiment) when a popular revolution overthrew the regime in March 1991; Colonel Touré then arrested the President and led the revolution onward. He presided over a year-long military-civilian transition process that produced a new Constitution and multiparty elections, then handed power to Mali&#x27;s first democratically elected president, Alpha Oumar Konaré, on 6 June 1992. Konaré promoted Touré to the rank of General.

Ten years later, after retiring from the army, Touré entered politics as a civilian and won the 2002 presidential election with a broad coalition of support. He was easily re-elected in 2007 to a second and final term. On 22 March 2012, shortly before his scheduled departure from office, disgruntled soldiers initiated a coup d&#x27;état that forced him into hiding. As part of the agreement to restore constitutional order to Mali, Touré resigned from the presidency on 8 April, and eleven days later he went into exile.

==Early life==
Amadou Toumani Touré was born on 4 November 1948, in Mopti, where he attended primary school, he is from the Arma subgroup of Songhai people. Between 1966 and 1969, he attended Badalabougou Standard Secondary School in Bamako in order to become a teacher. Eventually, he joined the army and attended the Kati Inter-Military College. As a member of the Parachute Corps, he rose quickly through the ranks and after numerous training courses in the Soviet Union and France, he became the commander of the parachute commandos in 1984.

==Political and military career==

In March 1991, after the violent suppression of anti-government demonstrations turned into a popular revolution against 23 years of military rule, the armed forces refused to fire any longer on the Malian people and Touré – head of the presidential guard – arrested President Moussa Traoré. Known universally by his initials ATT, Colonel Touré (as he then was) became leader of the Transitional Committee for the Welfare of the People and acting head of state throughout the committee&#x27;s efforts to transition the country&#x27;s government to democracy. He presided over the national conference that between 29 July and 13 August 1991 drew up the Constitution of Mali and scheduled the legislative and presidential elections of 1992. After the results of the elections became known, Touré handed over power to the newly elected president, Alpha Oumar Konaré. Following his voluntary departure from office, he gained the nickname &quot;The Soldier of Democracy.&quot;

In June 2001, Touré served briefly as a special envoy of UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to the Central African Republic, after the failed coup attempt that had occurred there.

=== Election and presidency (2002–2012) ===
In September 2001, he requested and was granted retirement from the military, entering politics as a candidate in the 2002 presidential election. In the first round of voting, he placed first with 28.71% of the vote, while in the second round he won 64.35% of the vote, defeating the ADEMA candidate, former cabinet minister Soumaïla Cissé, who obtained 35.65%. Touré was sworn in on 8 June 2002.

His presidency was atypical, in part due to the fact that he was not a member of any political party and that he included members from all of the country&#x27;s political parties in his government. Following his 2002 election, he appointed Ahmed Mohamed ag Hamani as Prime Minister, but on 28 April 2004, Hamani was replaced by Ousmane Issoufi Maiga, who in turn was replaced on 28 September 2007 by Modibo Sidibé.

In 2006 the government signed a peace deal with Tuareg rebels, giving them greater autonomy.
Touré announced on 27 March 2007, that he would run for a second term in the April 2007 presidential election. According to final results announced on 12 May, Touré won the election with 71.20% of the votes. The main opposition candidate, National Assembly President Ibrahima Boubacar Keïta, won 19.15%; the Front for Democracy and the Republic, a coalition including Keïta and three other candidates, rejected the official results. Foreign observers, however, endorsed the election as free and fair. Touré was sworn in for his second term as president on 8 June 2007, at a ceremony attended by seven other African presidents.

In addition to improving Mali&#x27;s infrastructure, Touré established the first national medical insurance system.

Conforming to the constitution of Mali, which has a two-term presidential limit, Touré confirmed at a press conference on 12 June 2011, that he would not stand in the 2012 presidential election.

===2012 coup d&#x27;état===

Early in 2012, elements of the Malian military protested the Touré government&#x27;s handling of the 2012 insurgency in northern Mali. The brutal massacre in Aguel Hoc (frontier with Niger) of more than 80 Malian soldiers led to unrest in the army, with soldiers and army wives accusing President Touré of mismanagement because of ammunition shortages. On 21 March, soldiers at a barracks in Kati, near Bamako, launched a revolt against the visiting defense minister, and their revolt turned into a coup d&#x27;état. A group of sergeants and corporals seized several locations in Bamako, including the presidential palace, state television headquarters, and some military barracks. They then formed a provisional governmental authority, the National Committee for the Restoration of Democracy and State (CNRDRE), under the leadership of Captain Amadou Sanogo, and declared that they had overthrown Touré, accusing his government of incompetence. President Touré was not taken into custody by the rebels.

For more than two weeks Touré&#x27;s whereabouts were unknown and CNRDRE never indicated that he was in its custody. The CNRDRE did, however, state that Touré was in &quot;good health&quot; and a statement from the Nigerian government, though supportive of Touré, claimed that he had been &quot;detained&quot; by the mutineers. According to soldiers loyal to Touré, however, he was safe, and guarded by pro-government military forces at a barracks somewhere outside of Bamako.

On 3 April, the junta announced that it was considering charges of treason and financial misconduct against Touré.

On 8 April, Touré reemerged to announce his resignation in accordance with an agreement brokered by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to return Mali to constitutional rule, telling ECOWAS mediators, &quot;More than anything, I do it out of the love I have for my country&quot;. On 19 April, Touré went into exile in neighboring Senegal.

Amadou Toumani Touré returned to Mali after five years, on 24 December 2017.

== Other work ==
In 1993, Touré founded Fondation pour l&#x27;enfance, a children&#x27;s health foundation. During his presidency, the foundation was managed by First Lady Toure Lobbo Traore.

Touré was a member of the Earth Charter International Commission.

== Personal life ==
Touré was married to Touré Lobbo Traoré. They had three daughters. He died in Istanbul, Turkey, on 9 November 2020, a week after his 72nd birthday.

<text>The Pistol Star is an extremely luminous blue hypergiant star, one of the most luminous and massive known stars in the Milky Way. It is one of many massive young stars in the Quintuplet cluster in the Galactic Center region. The star owes its name to the shape of the Pistol Nebula, which it illuminates. It is located approximately 25,000 light-years from Earth in the direction of Sagittarius. The star has a large mass comparable to V4998 Sagittarii and a luminosity 3.3 million times that of the Sun (). It would be visible to the naked eye as a 4th-magnitude star if it were not for the interstellar dust near the Center of the Milky Way that absorbs almost all of its visible light.

==Properties==

The Pistol Star was discovered using the Hubble Space Telescope in the early 1990s by Don Figer, an astronomer at UCLA.
The star is thought to have ejected almost 10 solar masses of material in giant outbursts perhaps 4,000 to 6,000 years ago (as observed from Earth). Its stellar wind is over 10 billion times stronger than the Sun&#x27;s. Its exact age and future are not known, but it is expected to end in a brilliant supernova or hypernova in 1 to 3 million years. The mass is equally uncertain, thought to have been up to 200 times the Sun when initially formed but now considerably less due to extreme mass loss although likely still over 100 times the Sun. Modelling the star itself to match its spectrum gives a mass of , while matching its current properties to an evolutionary model gives a much higher mass (). Earlier studies once claimed the Pistol Star as the most massive star known at around .
Later studies have reduced its estimated luminosity making it a candidate luminous blue variable about (one third as luminous as the binary star system Eta Carinae), hence a radius of based on an effective temperature around , or as high as , hence a correspondingly larger radius of . Even so, it radiates about as much energy in 10 seconds as the Sun does in a year.

A close point source has been discovered hidden in the surrounding nebulosity, but there has been no confirmation of this being a star or whether it is physically associated.

<text>Kessai Hesa Note (born August 7, 1950, in Ailinglaplap) is a Marshallese politician who was President of the Marshall Islands from 2000 to 2008.

Elected in 1979 alongside Litokwa Tomeing, Note is one of the two longest-serving members of Nitijeļā. He was the Minister of Internal affairs from 1985 to 1986, and Minister of Transportation and communications from 1986 to 1987. Having served as Speaker of the Nitijeļā since 1988, he was elected president in 2000. Note is the first commoner, rather than an Iroijlaplap or traditional chief, to be elected to the Presidency. He is a member of the United Democratic Party, and was reelected by parliament in January 2004, receiving 20 votes, while Justin deBrum received 9.

On January 7, 2008, following the November 2007 general election, he was defeated in his bid for re-election in a vote of Parliament, receiving 15 votes against 18 for Litokwa Tomeing.
Note is of Japanese-Marshallese descent, having inherited his Japanese heritage from his paternal grandfather. Note&#x27;s grandfather was a native of Niigata Prefecture, and settled in the Marshall Islands during the Japanese colonial era and married a Marshallese wife.

He was the Minister of Justice from 2020 to 2022.

In February 2023, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Note is under investigation by the Marshall Islands&#x27; attorney general. In December 2023, the United States Department of State barred Note from entering the US under the Global Magnitsky Act for accepting bribes.

<text>Joseph John &quot;Joe&quot; Urusemal (born March 19, 1951) is a Micronesian political figure who served as the sixth President of the Federated States of Micronesia from 2003 until 2007.

Urusemal is married to former First Lady Olania Latileilam, who is from Satawal. The couple have four children: B.J., Tarsis, Craig and Elenita.

==Early life==

Urusemal was born on the island of Woleai in the State of Yap. He attended secondary school on the island of Chuuk (then called Truk) at Xavier High School, a Jesuit institution. He would graduate from Xavier in 1976.

Urusemal went on to attend and graduate from Rockhurst University (then called Rockhurst College) in Kansas City, Missouri, United States. He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Administration of Justice from Rockhurst, a Roman Catholic Jesuit university. Upon graduation, Urusemal accepted a position with the Jackson County, Missouri, government, including the county Department of Corrections until he returned to Micronesia in 1982.

Following his return to Micronesia, Urusemal became a teacher and guidance counselor for the Outer Islands High School on his native Yap.

==Political career==
Urusemal was elected to four-year term in the Fifth Congress of the Federated States of Micronesia in 1987. He was elected as Yap&#x27;s at-large representative. Urusemal rose to leadership positions during his parliamentary career. He served as Floor Leader for twelve years during the Seventh until the Twelfth FSM congresses.

During his political career representing Yap, Urusemal served on several congressional committees including Health, Education and Social Affairs and the Judiciary and Governmental Operations committees.

The president and vice president of the Federated States of Micronesia are elected directly by Congress and must be a duly elected member at the time of election. Due to the defeat of the then-incumbent president, Leo Falcam, in the previous elections, Falcam was unable to stand for re-election. On May 11, 2003, Congress elected Urusemal as President and he took office immediately.

On May 11, 2007, the 15th Congress convened. A new presidential election was held and Manny Mori was elected president. He likewise took office immediately.

<text>Joaquim Alberto Chissano (born 22 October 1939) is a Mozambican politician who served as the second President of Mozambique, from 1986 to 2005. He is credited with transforming the war-torn country of Mozambique into a successful African democracy. After his presidency, Chissano became an elder statesman, envoy and diplomat for both his home country and the United Nations. Chissano also served as Chairperson of the African Union from 2003 to 2004.

==Early life==

Joaquim Chissano was born in the remote village of Malehice, Chibuto district, Gaza Province of the Portuguese colony of Mozambique (then called Portuguese East Africa). Chissano was the first black student to attend the only high school in the colony, Liceu Salazar in Lourenço Marques (present-day Maputo). After leaving secondary school, he went to Portugal to study medicine at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Lisbon. However, his political leanings caused him problems and he moved to France where he continued his studies at the University of Poitiers. In 1962, he went to Tanzania where he participated on the political movement that resulted in the foundation of the Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO) and a year later he abandoned his studies to move to Tanzania in order to serve on the fight for the independence of Mozambique.

==Career==
Chissano became &quot;one of the founding members&quot; of the Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO), which demanded autonomy from Portugal. Later, Chissano played a fundamental role in the negotiation of the Lusaka Accord of 1974, which paved the way for the country&#x27;s independence in 1975. The new President of Mozambique, Samora Machel, appointed him as Minister of Foreign Affairs.

===President of Mozambique===
Chissano succeeded to the presidency and became FRELIMO party leader in 1986 when Samora Machel&#x27;s presidential aircraft crashed in mountainous terrain in South Africa. Chissano ended the Mozambican Civil War in 1992 by negotiating a peace treaty with the rebel forces that &quot;promised no prosecutions or punishments&quot; and gave them 50% of the positions in the Mozambican army. The Renamo rebels later established their own political party.

In 1992, Chissano learned the Transcendental Meditation technique and introduced it to other government officials and their families. Two years later, Chissano and his generals ordered all police and military to &quot;meditate twice a day for 20 minutes.&quot; In addition, 16,000 soldiers and 30,000 civilians were taught Transcendental Meditation and its advanced TM-Sidhi Program including Yogic Flying. According to Transcendental Meditation literature, Chissano said the result was &quot;political peace and balance in nature in my country.&quot; According to Tobias Dai, the 2001 defence minister, &quot;the effect was overwhelming&quot; and included reduced crime, drought aversion and three times the expected level of economic growth. In 1993 Chissano received an honorary degree from Maharishi Vedic University in MERU, Holland and in 1994 negotiated an agreement with Maharishi Heaven on Earth Development for the agricultural development of 20 million hectares (49,000,000 acres) of &quot;unused land&quot; beginning with 2.5 million acres of timber, cotton and fruit. The 50-year contract promised 20% to 40% of the profits for the Mozambique government but other government officials refused the deal.
Chissano was reelected to the presidency in 1994 (53.3% of votes) and again in 1999 (52.9% votes), when he defeated the former rebel leader, Afonso Dhlakama. After winning re-election Chissano&#x27;s priority became poverty eradication but his efforts were complicated by a severe flood in 2000. However, Chissano had a fundamental role in convincing the G8 to write off £22 billion of Mozambique&#x27;s debt in 2005. Chissano chose not to run for a third term in the elections of 2004, although the constitution would have allowed him to do so. During Chissano&#x27;s presidency, almost 3 million people, about 15% of the country&#x27;s citizens, were removed from &quot;extreme poverty&quot; and the country achieved an economic growth rate of eight percent. In addition, child mortality rates for children under age five decreased by 35% and there was a 65% increase in primary school attendance.

===Post presidency===

Since leaving the presidency Chissano has assumed the role of elder statesman and has campaigned for peace through his work as an envoy and peace negotiator for the United Nations. Chissano served as Chairperson of the African Union from July 2003 to July 2004. On 4 December 2006, the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed Chissano the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General to Northern Uganda and Southern Sudan, to resolve the conflict with the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army (LRA). On Chissano&#x27;s 68th birthday in 2007, he was awarded the inaugural $5 million Prize for Achievement in African Leadership awarded by the Mo Ibrahim Foundation. Chissano was absent from the award ceremony because he was still working on his United Nations mission in southern Sudan. According to the award&#x27;s judges &quot;Mr Chissano&#x27;s decision not to seek a third presidential term reinforced Mozambique&#x27;s democratic maturity and demonstrated that institutions and the democratic process were more important than the person&quot;.

In 2010, Chissano wrote an article for &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; about water scarcity in Africa. Chissano is a member of the Fondation Chirac&#x27;s honour committee. He is also an independent non-executive director at Harmony Gold Mining, a South African underground and surface gold mining company, as well as an Eminent Member of the Sergio Vieira de Mello Foundation.

In 2014, Chissano has spoken out in favor of LGBT rights in Africa.

On July 3, 2023, he was appointed Honorary President of the new International Association of Friends of the Algerian Revolution. This organization aims to promote the principles of the Algerian Revolution and provide support to colonized peoples.
== Awards and nominations ==
* On 9 December 2004, he received the Order of the Athir, one of the National Order of Merits of Algeria.
* In February 2005, he received the Honoris Causa title from the University of Minho. The title was awarded with the institution justifying the tribute with the action developed by Chissano as President of the Republic and &quot;also for the role he played in the peace process in Mozambique, in the evolution and construction of a democratic and opening up the country to development&quot;.
* In 2006, he received the Chatham House Prize. 
* In 2007, Kofi Annan announced the former President of Mozambique as the winner of the Mo Ibrahim Prize for Achievement in African Leadership by the Mo Ibrahim Foundation. President Chissano received the inaugural Ibrahim Prize for his achievements in bringing peace, reconciliation, stable democracy and economic progress to his country following the 16-year civil war which lasted until 1992. The Prize also recognises the major contribution he has made outside his country’s borders.
* Chairs the Joaquim Chissano Foundation and the Forum of Former African Heads of State and Government.
* According to a UNISA statement, released in Maputo, the former head of state would be distinguished, on 24 May, with the title doctor &#x27;honoris causa&#x27; in Literature and Philosophy, for the &quot;political and diplomatic work developed in the last five decades.&quot; On 24 May 2011 he received it.

==Personal life==
Chissano is married to Marcelina Rafael Chissano. He is the father of four children and his son received a scholarship to Maharishi International University in Fairfield, Iowa. Chissano has been criticized for his continued friendship with Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and there have been allegations that Chissano&#x27;s son Nyimpine Chissano (who died in 2007) promised payment for the assassination of journalist Carlos Cardoso.

Chissano speaks fluent Portuguese, French, English, and Swahili. He speaks Changana as well.

<doc id="393562" wikidata="Q250421" url="?curid=393562" title="Killing Joke">
<text>Killing Joke are an English rock band formed in Notting Hill, London, in 1979 by Jaz Coleman (vocals, keyboards), Paul Ferguson (drums), Geordie Walker (guitar) and Youth (bass).

Their first album, &quot;Killing Joke&quot;, was released in 1980. After the release of &quot;Revelations&quot; in 1982, bassist Youth was replaced by Paul Raven. The band achieved mainstream success in 1985 with the album &quot;Night Time&quot; and particularly the single &quot;Love Like Blood&quot; which reached the top ten in Belgium, the Netherlands and New Zealand.

The band&#x27;s musical style emerged from the post-punk scene, but stood out due to their heavier approach, and has been cited as a key influence on industrial rock. Their style evolved over many years, at times incorporating elements of gothic rock, synth-pop and electronic music, but always featuring Walker&#x27;s prominent guitar and Coleman&#x27;s &quot;savagely strident vocals&quot;. Killing Joke have influenced many later bands and artists, such as Metallica, Nirvana, Nine Inch Nails and Soundgarden.

Following Raven&#x27;s sudden death in 2007, all four founding members returned to the band&#x27;s lineup the following year. Coleman and Walker were the only constant members of the band until Walker&#x27;s death in 2023.

== History ==
=== Formative years (1978–1982) ===
Paul Ferguson was the drummer in the band Matt Stagger when he met Jaz Coleman (from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire) in Notting Hill, London in late 1978. Coleman was briefly the keyboard player in that band. He and Ferguson then left to gradually piece together Killing Joke. In the following months, they placed advertisements in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and other music papers. Guitarist Geordie Walker joined them in March 1979, followed by bassist Youth. The band was formed in June 1979. Coleman said their manifesto at the time was to &quot;define the exquisite beauty of the atomic age in terms of style, sound and form&quot;. Coleman gave an explanation concerning their name: &quot;The killing joke is like when people watch something like Monty Python on the television and laugh, when really they&#x27;re laughing at themselves. It&#x27;s like a soldier in the first world war. He&#x27;s in the trench, he knows his life is gone and that within the next ten minutes he&#x27;s gonna be dead ... and then suddenly he realises that some cunt back in Westminster&#x27;s got him sussed—&#x27;What am I doing this for? I don&#x27;t want to kill anyone, I&#x27;m just being controlled&#x27;.&quot; The band played their debut gig on 4 August 1979 at Whitcombe Lodge in Brockworth, near Gloucester, supporting the Ruts and The Selecter.

By September 1979, shortly before the release of their debut EP, &quot;Turn to Red&quot;, they started the Malicious Damage record label with graphic artist Mike Coles as a way to press and sell their music. Island Records distributed the records (and released their debut single &quot;Nervous System&quot;), before they switched to E.G. Records with distribution through Polydor from 1980. Killing Joke&#x27;s early material &quot;fused together elements of punk, funk and dub reggae&quot;. &quot;Turn to Red&quot; came to the attention of BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, who was keen to champion the band&#x27;s urgent new sound and gave them extensive airplay. In October 1979, the band recorded their first session for Peel&#x27;s radio show. An &quot;NME&quot; concert review said that &quot;their sound is a bit like early [Siouxsie and the] Banshees without the thrilling, amoral imagination&quot;. Concerning their live performances, it was said that &quot;the only animation on stage is provided by Jaz who crouches behind his synthesizer, making forays like a Neanderthal man gripped by a gesturing, gibbering fury&quot;. The songs on the 1980 &quot;Wardance/Pssyche&quot; single were described as &quot;heavy dance music&quot; by the press. The band had changed their sound into something denser, more aggressive and more akin to heavy metal. Their debut album, &quot;Killing Joke&quot;, was released in October 1980; the band had considered calling it &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot;. The press started to criticise them for the lack of new material appearing on the B-sides of singles, which often featured different mixes. The group preferred to carry on working in the studio and released &quot;What&#x27;s THIS For...!&quot; just eight months after &quot;Killing Joke&quot;, in June 1981. For this second album, they hired sound engineer Nick Launay, who had previously recorded with Public Image Ltd. They toured extensively throughout the UK during this time, with fans of post-punk and heavy metal taking interest in Killing Joke via singles such as &quot;Follow the Leaders&quot;.

Killing Joke also became notorious largely due to the controversies that arose from their imagery. The images that appeared on their records and stage set were often bizarre and potentially shocking and inflammatory. Critics noted the band&#x27;s black humour and the use of musical and visual shock tactics to create a reaction. The &quot;Wardance&quot; sleeve had already depicted Fred Astaire dancing in a war field. One promotional poster featured an original photo, erroneously believed to be of Pope Pius XI. The picture was of German abbot Alban Schachleiter walking among rows of Nazi brownshirts offering Hitler salutes and appearing to return the salute; it was later used for the cover of the band&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Laugh? I Nearly Bought One!&quot;.

&quot;Revelations&quot; was recorded in 1982 in Germany near Cologne with producer Conny Plank, who had previously worked for Neu! and Kraftwerk. The album was supported by a pair of performances on BBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;The John Peel Show&quot; and a slot on UK TV show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; for &quot;Empire Song&quot;. It was the first time that one of their albums had entered the top 20 of the UK Albums Chart: &quot;Revelations&quot; peaked at No. 12 at its release. Members of the band, especially Coleman, had become immersed in the occult, particularly the works of occultist Aleister Crowley. In February of that year, Coleman, with Walker following shortly after, moved to Iceland to survive the Apocalypse, which Coleman predicted was coming soon. While in Iceland, Coleman and Walker worked with musicians from the band Þeyr in the project Niceland. Youth, who had stayed in England, left the band after a few months. He then began the band Brilliant with Ferguson, but the latter defected and travelled to Iceland to rejoin Killing Joke with new bassist Paul Raven.

=== Paul Raven and new direction (1982–1988) ===
The new Killing Joke line-up recorded again with Plank, yielding the single &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot; and a six-track 10&quot; EP&quot; Ha!&quot;, recorded live at Larry&#x27;s Hideaway in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in August. In 1983 the band released &quot;Fire Dances&quot; and its single, &quot;Let&#x27;s All Go (to the Fire Dances)&quot;, the first Killing Joke single to be promoted with a music video. Another non-album single, &quot;Me or You?&quot;, was released in October.

The following year brought the arrival of producer Chris Kimsey, who had previously worked with the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin. The first releases with Kimsey were &quot;Eighties&quot; (April 1984) and &quot;A New Day&quot; (July 1984). The band achieved mainstream success in January 1985 with the single &quot;Love Like Blood&quot;, which blended goth and new wave to pop and rock; it peaked at No. 16 in the UK charts. In Europe, it reached the No. 5 position in the Netherlands, No. 6 in New Zealand and No. 8 in Belgium. This song and the earlier single &quot;Eighties&quot; were both included on their fifth album, &quot;Night Time&quot;, released later that year. The album took the band&#x27;s songwriting in a more melodic, &quot;anthemic&quot; direction and reached No. 11 in the UK albums chart, their highest position to date. &quot;Night Time&quot; also became an international success, staying in the Dutch charts for nine weeks, reaching the top 10, and peaking at No. 8 in New Zealand during a 14-week stay. The band, still on the E.G. label, then quit their distribution deal with Polydor and signed a new one with Virgin Records.

The following album, &quot;Brighter than a Thousand Suns&quot; (1986) was also produced by Kimsey and saw the band&#x27;s style develop further. The label rejected Kimsey&#x27;s original mixes and had the album re-mixed against the wishes of the band, in an attempt to achieve more commercial success. The results have been retrospectively described as over-produced. Despite the intentions of the label, the album was a commercial failure compared to &quot;Night Time&quot;, failing to reach the top 50 in the UK chart. Its two singles fared little better: &quot;Adorations&quot; narrowly missed the UK Top 40 and &quot;Sanity&quot; peaked at number 70. However, the band continued touring successfully until the end of the year. Kimsey&#x27;s original mixes of &quot;Brighter Than A Thousand Suns&quot; were eventually restored on the 2008 re-release, to much more favourable response.

In 1987, Coleman and Walker began working on a new project, which was presented by Coleman and Walker as a studio project to the rest of the band. Raven took part in the sessions but ultimately asked for his name to be removed from the album credits. Ferguson recorded drums in Berlin but, according to Coleman, was dismissed because he was not able to manage the precise timings. Raven denied this version of events, stating, &quot;I know Paul and when he does something he does it properly. If it wasn&#x27;t right he would have stayed there &#x27;til it was&quot;. Session player Jimmy Copley was brought in to provide the drumming on the album, along with percussion player Jeff Scantlebury. Raven and Ferguson quit Killing Joke shortly afterwards, with Raven purportedly calling Coleman and Walker &quot;a pair of ego-strokers&quot;. Coleman then delivered a lecture at London&#x27;s Courtauld Institute about his method behind the songs, expounding on its origins in gematria and the occult, while Walker and Scantlebury provided a minimal acoustic musical backing. A recording of this event was released as &quot;The Courtauld Talks&quot;.

The resulting album, &quot;Outside the Gate&quot;, released the following June, is Killing Joke&#x27;s most controversial work to date due to its complex synth instrumentation and stylistic departure. It entered the UK Albums Chart at number 92 and stayed for just one week. No gigs were played in support of the album and it was not released in the US. Virgin dropped the band two months later, by which time Coleman and Walker had become embroiled in a lengthy legal battle to extricate themselves from their contract with E.G.

=== Revised line-up (1989–1991) ===
Towards the end of 1988, Coleman and Walker revived the band and began looking for full-time bass players and drummers. First on board was drummer Martin Atkins, who had gained notability in Public Image Ltd. A suitable bass player proved more difficult. Former Smiths member Andy Rourke was hired, then dismissed after only three days. Eventually the band settled on Welsh bass player Dave &quot;Taif&quot; Ball, and played their first gigs in almost two years in December 1988. Touring continued across the UK, Europe and the US until August 1989, when the band took a break to record new material in Germany and allow Coleman time to record &quot;Songs from the Victorious City&quot; with Anne Dudley of Art of Noise.

For reasons that remain unclear, the German sessions were shelved and bass player Taif left the band. He was replaced by former member Paul Raven and the revised line-up began recording again, this time in London. The result was Killing Joke&#x27;s eighth album, &quot;Extremities, Dirt &amp; Various Repressed Emotions&quot;, released on the German Noise International label in 1990. It marked a return to a heavier sound. &quot;Money Is Not Our God&quot; was the lead single. The band toured Europe and North America until unexpectedly disbanding again in mid-1991. Coleman emigrated to New Zealand to live on a remote Pacific island, and Killing Joke entered a hiatus.

Atkins continued with Walker, Raven and the band&#x27;s live keyboard player, John Bechdel, as the short-lived Murder, Inc., recruiting Scottish vocalist Chris Connelly and reuniting with Ferguson as second drummer.

=== &quot;Pandemonium&quot; and &quot;Democracy&quot; (1992–1996) ===

A Killing Joke anthology, &quot;Laugh? I Nearly Bought One!&quot;, was released in 1992; during its production, Walker became reacquainted with Youth, who suggested that they reform the band with himself back on bass. That same year, two singles (on cassette and CD) appeared featuring the early songs &quot;Change&quot; and &quot;Wardance&quot; remixed by Youth, who was by then a successful producer. In late 1993, Walker, Youth, and Coleman (alongside new drummer Geoff Dugmore) started work on Killing Joke&#x27;s ninth studio album. Portions of the album were recorded inside the King&#x27;s Chamber of The Great Pyramid of Giza.

&quot;Pandemonium&quot; was released in 1994 on Youth&#x27;s Butterfly Recordings label, featuring a heavy and diverse new style. Tom Larkin, of New Zealand band Shihad, performed additional drums on the album. Coleman had earlier produced Shihad&#x27;s 1993 debut album, but relations later soured due to a dispute over Coleman&#x27;s producer&#x27;s fee. &quot;Pandemonium&quot; also featured several Egyptian musicians that Coleman had previously worked with on &quot;Songs from the Victorious City&quot;, including percussionist Hossam Ramzy and violinist Aboud Abdel Al., and earned Killing Joke a memorable &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; appearance for the single &quot;Millennium&quot;, which was a UK Top 40 hit (the album itself made the Top 20). The title track was also released as a single and made the UK Top 30. The album itself became Killing Joke&#x27;s best-selling work.

In 1995, the band recorded the song &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot; for the &quot;Showgirls&quot; soundtrack of the Paul Verhoeven film of the same name.

A follow-up album, &quot;Democracy&quot;, was released in 1996 and also produced by Youth. &quot;Democracy&quot; introduced acoustic guitar to several songs and featured more explicitly political lyrics. The title track was released as a single and made the UK Top 40. Much of &quot;Pandemonium&quot; and all of &quot;Democracy&quot; featured drummer Dugmore, who also played live with the band during this era. Nick Holywell-Walker also joined the band on keyboards and programming for 11 years from 1994 to 2005, notably on &quot;Democracy&quot; and &quot;XXV Gathering&quot;. Youth bowed out of live performance early in the &quot;Democracy&quot; tour and was replaced by Troy Gregory, previously of Prong.

After the &quot;Democracy&quot; tour, the band went on their longest hiatus to date. Coleman and Youth produced a string of orchestral rock albums based on the music of classic rock artists such as Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and the Doors. Coleman became Composer in Residence for New Zealand and Czech symphony orchestras, and made his acting debut with the main role in the film &quot;Rok ďábla&quot; (&quot;Year of the Devil&quot;) by Czech filmmaker Petr Zelenka.

=== Reformation and death of Paul Raven (2002–2007) ===
In 2002, Coleman, Walker and Youth recorded their second self-titled album with special guest Dave Grohl on drums. Produced by Andy Gill and released to much acclaim in 2003, it was heralded as a powerful addition to their earlier classics. In 2003, the band played at the biggest open air festival in Europe—Przystanek Woodstock in Poland. The War on Terror and the invasion of Iraq were cited as major factors in their reforming, reflected in the lyrical content of much of the album, based on themes of war, government control and Armageddon. The album, which fell just short of the UK Top 40 and spawned two singles, &quot;Loose Cannon&quot; (a UK Top 25 hit) and &quot;Seeing Red&quot;. The songs were all credited to Coleman/Walker/Youth/Gill, although Raven&#x27;s name is also on the list of musicians on the liner notes, marking his return to the band after more than a decade. The album was accompanied by a tour of the United States, Europe and Australia in 2003–2004, with ex-Prong drummer Ted Parsons on board.

In February 2005, now with young drummer Ben Calvert (Twin Zero, Sack Trick), Killing Joke played two consecutive shows at London&#x27;s Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire to commemorate their 25th anniversary. DVD and CD recordings from these concerts were released in the fall of the same year as &quot;XXV Gathering: The Band that Preys Together Stays Together&quot;. In June, remastered and expanded editions of &quot;Pandemonium&quot; and &quot;Democracy&quot;, were released by Cooking Vinyl. These were followed in July by remasters of their first four albums (&quot;Killing Joke&quot; to &quot;Ha!&quot;) on EMI, who by then owned the E.G. Records catalogue. The second batch of EMI remasters would not appear until January 2008. That year, Reza Udhin joined the band on keyboards when they supported Mötley Crüe&#x27;s British tour; they then began work on their next album in Prague. Killing Joke&#x27;s contribution to the world of rock was recognised when they were awarded the &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; at the 2005 &quot;Kerrang&quot; Awards. The band recorded the new album in &quot;Hell&quot;, the basement rehearsal space of Studio Faust Records in Prague, opting for simplicity and raw energy through the use of live takes with a minimum of overdubs. The result was &quot;Hosannas from the Basements of Hell&quot;, released in April 2006, which made the UK Top 75.

During a European tour in April 2006, Paul Raven abruptly departed after a few dates to tour with Ministry, and was temporarily replaced by Kneill Brown. In October, it was announced that Coleman had been chosen as Composer in Residence for the European Union, to be commissioned to write music for special occasions.

Early in 2007, Killing Joke released three archival collections. The first, &quot;Inside Extremities&quot;, was a double album of material taken from the band&#x27;s preparations for the &quot;Extremities&quot; album, including rehearsals, rare mixes, previously unheard track &quot;The Fanatic&quot; and a full live show from the &quot;Extremities&quot; tour. This was followed by two volumes of &quot;Bootleg Vinyl Archive&quot;, each consisting of a 3-CD box set of live bootleg recordings originally released on vinyl in the 1980s, plus the Astoria gig from the &quot;Pandemonium&quot; tour (which was voted one of the greatest gigs of all time by &quot;Kerrang&quot;). The 1990 album &quot;Extremities, Dirt &amp; Various Repressed Emotions&quot;, which had long been out of print, was reissued in remastered form.

On 20 October, Paul Raven died of heart failure prior to a recording session in Geneva, Switzerland. In his honour, Coleman composed the track &quot;The Raven King&quot;, which appeared on the next album. In 2008, the second batch of albums, from &quot;Fire Dances&quot; to &quot;Outside the Gate&quot;, was reissued in remastered form with bonus tracks.

=== Reunion of the original line-up and death of Geordie Walker (2008–present) ===

After the death of Raven, the original line-up of Coleman, Youth, Walker and Ferguson reunited. Coleman told &quot;Terrorizer&quot; magazine how the return of Ferguson came up after 20 years of absence:

Everything came together when we all met at...Raven&#x27;s funeral. It was funny the unifying effect it had on all of us. It made us realise our mortality and how important Killing Joke is to all of us.

They assembled in Granada, Spain, to prepare a world tour consisting of two nights in various capital cities of the world, playing a programme of four complete albums. Recordings of the rehearsals were later released as &quot;Duende - The Spanish Sessions&quot;. The first night was dedicated to their first two albums, &quot;Killing Joke&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s THIS For...!&quot;, while the second night featured large parts of &quot;Pandemonium&quot; plus some early Island singles. The world tour began in September in Tokyo and concluded in Chicago in October.

An album of radio session recordings, &quot;The Peel Sessions 1979–1981&quot;, was released in September 2008. This was the second time all 17 tracks were released in their live session form.

The band then appeared at several festivals, including All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties, Sonisphere Festival, and Rebellion Festival, headlining the latter. They also performed in the Big Top Tent at the 2009 Isle of Wight Festival after being hand-picked by Tim Burgess, frontman for the Charlatans.

During October and November 2009, they recorded the album &quot;Absolute Dissent&quot; (2010), marking the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary. It was preceded by the &quot;In Excelsis&quot; EP in June 2010. In November, the band received the &quot;Innovator Award&quot; at the 2010 &quot;Classic Rock&quot; Roll of Honour; the award was presented to Killing Joke by Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, who stated, &quot;I go back a long way with Jaz Coleman and the band. I used to go and see the band, and it was a band that really impressed me because Geordie&#x27;s guitar sound was just really, really strong. And they were really tribal, the band, and it was really intense. It was just really good to hear something like that during the 80s, which sort of caved in a bit with haircuts and synthesizers&quot;. The band were also honoured by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; at their annual awards, receiving the Album of the Year award for &quot;Absolute Dissent&quot;.

In 2012, the group released &quot;MMXII&quot;. It reached No. 44 upon its first week of release, the band&#x27;s highest UK chart placement since their eponymous 2003 album, as well as charting across Europe.

The band released their 15th studio album, &quot;Pylon&quot;, in October 2015. The deluxe edition contained five additional tracks. A nine-date British tour followed to promote the record. &quot;Pylon&quot; entered the UK albums chart at No. 16, becoming the band&#x27;s first UK Top 20 album since 1994. In November 2016, the band played at the Brixton Academy in London, before embarking on a European tour, their longest to date. In 2018, the band did a worldwide tour to celebrate their 40th anniversary.

In March 2022 the band released a new EP, &quot;Lord of Chaos&quot;, their first new material for seven years.

Geordie Walker died in Prague on 25 November 2023, aged 64, after suffering a stroke.

== Style and influences ==
The band called their sound &quot;tension music&quot;. Co-founder Ferguson described it as &quot;the sound of the earth vomiting. I&#x27;m never quite sure whether to be offended by the question of &#x27;are we punk&#x27; or not, because, I loved punk music, but we weren&#x27;t. And I think our influences were beyond punk. Obviously before punk, there was Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and there was Yes even and King Crimson, and those had all influenced me as a player, and the other guys would say other things, but I&#x27;m sure they were all part of their history as well&quot;.

Coleman&#x27;s &quot;menacing&quot; vocal style and &quot;terrifying growl&quot; have been compared to Motörhead&#x27;s Lemmy. In the first part of their career, Coleman also played synth while singing, adding electronic atonal sounds to create a disturbing atmosphere.

Walker&#x27;s guitar style is metallic and cold. Walker stated that &quot;the guitar should convey some sort of emotion&quot;. He cited Siouxsie and the Banshees&#x27;s original guitarist John McKay who &quot;came out with these chord structures that I found very refreshing&quot;. According to critic Simon Reynolds, Walker took Keith Levene&#x27;s guitar sound from PiL to another, almost inhuman and extreme level. Ferguson&#x27;s tribal drum style has been compared to early Siouxsie and the Banshees. Coleman had stated in early 1980 that Ferguson listened to the Banshees.

The band has been experimenting on an industrial metal influenced sound since Pandemonium. and as of today, it still continues on recent albums.

== Legacy ==
Killing Joke have inspired artists of many genres. They have been namechecked by several heavy metal and rock bands such as Metallica and Soundgarden. Metallica covered &quot;The Wait&quot; and James Hetfield picked Coleman as one of his favourite singers. Soundgarden cited them as one of their main influences when they started playing. Jane&#x27;s Addiction said that the group was one of their influences; singer Perry Farrell was inspired by the percussive and tribal aspect of their music. Helmet frontman Page Hamilton, whose band covered &quot;Primitive&quot; and &quot;Requiem&quot;, has described Killing Joke as &quot;a huge-huge influence&quot;. Faith No More stated that all of their members liked the group, qualifying them as a &quot;great band&quot;. Walker&#x27;s style inspired Kurt Cobain&#x27;s work with Nirvana, according to Bill Janovitz of AllMusic, with the use of a metallic sound mixed with a shimmering chorused effect. Foo Fighters, Nirvana drummer Grohl&#x27;s subsequent band, covered &quot;Requiem&quot; in 1997. Metal band Fear Factory covered &quot;Millennium&quot; in 2005.

The band have inspired many industrial bands, including Nine Inch Nails and Ministry. They have been cited by Trent Reznor, Nine Inch Nails&#x27;s leader, who mentioned his interest in their early material, and said that he studied their music. Al Jourgensen of Ministry described himself as a &quot;big fan&quot; of the group. Marilyn Manson listened to them during his formative years. Godflesh frontman Justin Broadrick was particularly influenced by their early releases containing dub versions.

The group has also been cited by alternative music acts such as My Bloody Valentine and LCD Soundsystem. Shoegaze guitarist and composer Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine mentioned the band and specifically praised Walker&#x27;s touch, which he described as &quot;this effortless playing producing a monstruous sound&quot;. In 2002, James Murphy of dance-punk band LCD Soundsystem lifted the rhythm section of &quot;Change&quot; on his debut single, &quot;Losing My Edge&quot;.

== Film ==
Killing Joke were the subject of a feature-length documentary film, &quot;The Death and Resurrection Show&quot; (2013), by filmmaker Shaun Pettigrew; its genesis came from an earlier video work financed by Coleman called &quot;Let Success Be Your Proof&quot;. The film was shown in various festivals between 2013 and 2014. Co-produced by Coleman, it combined archive footage of Killing Joke over the previous decades with tour footage, recording sessions and interviews with subjects including the members of the band, Jimmy Page, Dave Grohl, Peter Hook and Alex Paterson. &quot;The Death and Resurrection Show&quot; was broadcast on Sundance TV and was then released on DVD via the film&#x27;s website in 2017. &quot;Uncut&quot; rated it 9 out of 10, saying &quot;Shaun Pettigrew&#x27;s film mixes outlandish anecdotes, arcane philosophy and blistering music&quot;.

<text>Enrique José Bolaños Geyer (; 13 May 1928 – 14 June 2021) was a Nicaraguan politician who served as President of Nicaragua from 10 January 2002 to 10 January 2007. 

From 1997 to 2002, Bolaños served as vice president under Arnoldo Alemán. On 4 November 2001 he defeated Daniel Ortega of the Sandinista National Liberation Front party in the presidential election and was sworn in as president on 10 January 2002. He was a member of the Constitutional Liberal Party (PLC) until he broke with it to help form the Alliance for the Republic (APRE). At the beginning of his term as president, he led an anti-corruption campaign that ultimately convicted his predecessor and head of the PLC, Arnoldo Alemán to 20 years in prison.

== Early life and career ==
Bolaños was born in Masaya, Nicaragua, on 13 May 1928. He received his primary and secondary education in Nicaragua at the Jesuit Colegio Centro América, and graduated from Saint Louis University in the United States with a degree in industrial engineering. He married Lila Teresita Abaunza in 1949. They had five children, a daughter and four sons, including Enrique Bolaños Abaunza who is head of INCAE Business School.

With his brothers Alejandro and Nicolás, in 1952 high cotton prices promoted him to begin an agro-production enterprise. This grew into the business, founded in 1964, SAIMSA (Industrial Agricultural Services of Masaya), a consortium that became one of the largest cotton producers in Central America by the 1970s. Bolaños served as an active member of the influential business chamber COSEP (Superior Council for Private Enterprise), and served as its president from 1983 to 1988. Under his leadership, COSEP was a vigorously anti-Sandinista institution; Bolaños described himself as anti-communist and believed investment was the way to lift the country out of poverty.

Bolaños publicly opposed Daniel Ortega&#x27;s Sandinista government during the 1980s. After COSEP sent a letter criticizing the Junta of National Reconstruction, Bolaños was one of the COSEP figures arrested, on 20 October 1981 and held for six days, though he was not yet part of the COSEP leadership which signed the aforementioned letter. One month later he was imprisoned again upon returning from an AIL (Association of Latin American Enterprises) conference in Venezuela. Under the government&#x27;s controversial agrarian reform program, in 1985 SAIMSA was confiscated by the government. Bolanos characterized the confiscation as a reprisal for his political activities. He worked as a computer programmer following the confiscation of his business.

In October 1995 Bolaños was elected campaign manager for the Liberal Constitutionalist Party (PLC) in the 1996 elections. The following May, he was chosen by presidential candidate and former mayor of Managua Arnoldo Alemán as the PLC&#x27;s vice-presidential candidate. The ticket defeated perennial Sandinista candidate Ortega with 51% of the vote, and Alemán and Bolaños were sworn in as president and vice president, respectively, on 10 January 1997.

==Presidency (2002–2007) ==
Bolaños was chosen as the presidential candidate for the 2001 elections at the Grand Convention of the Constitutionalist Liberal Party (PLC) meeting in 2001. Facing a country still recovering from the devastation wrought by Hurricane Mitch in 1998, Bolaños campaigned on the slogan “let’s roll up our sleeves”. He won the presidential elections with 56.3% of the vote, while Daniel Ortega received 42.3% and Conservative Party candidate Alberto Saborio received 1.4%.

Bolaños was sworn in as President of the Republic of Nicaragua on 10 January 2002 to serve a five-year term (2002–2007). Two days later, he began an anti-corruption campaign to investigate and prosecute all former and current state employees who engaged in corrupt behavior. In August this resulted in the prosecution, and ultimately the conviction of his predecessor Alemán with fraud, money laundering, and misuse of public funds, in sums totaling almost $100 million. The case, known as “la huaca”, is one of the largest in Nicaraguan history. Alemán served six of a 20-year sentence, mainly under house arrest, until he was acquitted by the Ortega administration in 2009. 

Throughout his administration, Bolaños faced obstacles from power based outside the Presidency, later citing what he characterized as three coup attempts against his government: the first, early in his tenure came when the Supreme Court of Justice of Nicaragua sent an accusation to the National Assembly that he had used funds from the &quot;huaca&quot; to finance his electoral campaign and asked to reverse it. The second came in 2004 when an opinion from the Comptroller&#x27;s Office sent to the National Assembly sought to remove him from office. Finally, in September 2005, Bolaños publicly denounced as a “slow motion coup” the joint efforts of Ortega, Alemán, the PLC, and the FSLN, together with the National Assembly, which attempted constitutional reforms to strip him of power. Demonstrations called by the FSLN backed the National Assembly’s actions. The executive branch was partially stripped of its powers to appoint ministers and public officials, but, facing pressure from the international community, particularly the OAS, the EU, and the United States, constitutional changes were postponed until the following year. 

Despite this crisis, he succeeded in negotiating the ratification of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) by the National Assembly; as well as the forgiveness of 80% of Nicaragua’s debts by creditors. Focused on macroeconomics, he set up investment incentives that spurred sustained economic growth at levels the country had not seen in decades; but this emphasis came at the expense of policies to help the poor, something his adversary Ortega seized on to fuel opposition.

A staunch conservative, Bolaños allegedly ordered the compilation of a list of public officials &quot;suspected&quot; of being part of the &quot;gay-lesbian world&quot;. In November 2006, abortion was outlawed under all circumstances and Bolaños proposed a 30-year prison sentence as punishment.

During the 2006 presidential election campaign, the Nicaraguan Constitution barred the incumbent from seeking re-election and Bolaños&#x27;s Alliance for the Republic party (APRE) joined the Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance, whose candidate Eduardo Montealegre took second place. Bolaños turned over the presidency to his longtime political opponent Daniel Ortega on 10 January 2007. As outgoing President, he was legally entitled to a seat in the new session of the National Assembly, a practice he had criticized after its creation in the 1990s as part of the “pact” between Alemán and Ortega. Bolaños instead left the political arena, formally resigning his seat in February 2007.

== Post-presidency ==
Following his retirement from politics, Bolaños ran the Enrique Bolaños Foundation, a non-profit educational foundation that provides free and democratic access to all documents from Bolaños&#x27; presidency as well as many digitized collections of Nicaraguan historical, political, cultural, and juridical documents, making it one of the main centers of historical documentation in the country. It is the first Nicaraguan presidential library, and one of Latin America&#x27;s first virtual presidential libraries, which Bolaños programmed and developed himself. 

Despite having left politics, he remained a critic of Ortega, who Bolaños said had never left power since he first toppled Somoza in 1979.

In 2017, Bolaños published &quot;The Struggle for Power&quot;, which both gave a political history of Nicaragua from 1821 to 2007 and also served as a memoir of his time in the presidency.

His wife Lila T. Abaunza died in 2008 of a brain hemorrhage. Three of Bolaños’s children also predeceased him. In August 2020, Bolaños’s family shared news that he was in poor health. He died on 14 June 2021 in his home outside Managua at the age of 93. He was interred at the family crypt at Monimbó cemetery.

<text>DC Thomson is a media company based in Dundee, Scotland. Founded by David Couper Thomson in 1905, it is best known for publishing &quot;The Courier&quot;, &quot;The Evening Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Post&quot; newspapers, and the comics &quot;Oor Wullie&quot;, &quot;The Broons&quot;, &quot;The Beano&quot;, &quot;The Dandy&quot; and &quot;Commando&quot;. It also owns the Aberdeen Journals Group which publishes the &quot;Press and Journal&quot;. The company owns several websites, including Findmypast, and owned the now defunct social media site Friends Reunited.

==History==
The company began as a branch of the Thomson family business when William Thomson became the sole proprietor of Charles Alexander &amp; Company, publishers of &quot;Dundee Courier and Daily Argus&quot;. In 1884, David Couper Thomson took over the publishing business, and established it as D.C. Thomson in 1905. The firm flourished, and took its place as the third J in the &quot;Three Js&quot;, the traditional summary of Dundee industry (&#x27;jute, jam and journalism&#x27;). 

Thomson was notable for his conservatism, vigorously opposing the introduction of trade unions into his workforce, and for refusing to employ Catholics. Among historians of popular culture, the firm has &quot;excited a good deal of interest precisely because it has always shrouded its activities in secrecy ... [it] has never allowed scholars access to its archives, and has declined to participate in exhibitions of juvenile literature.&quot;

By 2010, the company was producing more than 100 million comics, magazines, and newspapers every year from offices in Dundee, Glasgow, Manchester, and London. In June 2010, 350 jobs at DC Thomson were made redundant with the closure of the West Ward Printworks in Dundee, along with a section of the Kingsway Print Plant.

Although the principal offices are now located outside Dundee city centre at Kingsway, the Courier Building at Meadowside has been retained as the company headquarters. This 1902 building was designed to resemble an American red stone, steel reinforced office block. When a nine-storey tower extension was added in 1960, the architect T. Lindsay Grey kept the same style. The building underwent extensive renovation and reopened to employees in 2017, and is able to accommodate 600 workers.

In 2009 DC Thomson acquired the magazine company This England Publishing, which included &quot;This England&quot; magazine and &quot;Evergreen&quot; quarterly magazine. In the same year DC Thomson acquired the Friends Reunited website from ITV for £25.6m, but by 2011 it was valued at £5.2m and was eventually shut down completely in February 2016. In 2013, DC Thomson laid off 46 production staff at its Lang Stracht base in Aberdeen after printing was moved to Dundee.

As of 2016, the company posted an increase in pre-tax profits and revenue whilst employing over 2,000 workers. Despite the falling circulation of newspapers and magazines, DC Thomson attributed the rising profits to company-wide cuts to operating costs and good figures in digital revenues and events. The company went on to say that they would continue to branch out their brand into new areas to support the traditional newspaper and magazine divisions.

In February 2023, it was announced that several &quot;well-loved&quot; titles would be closed and employees would be made redundant as part of a wider restructuring. On 9 February 2023, it was announced that &quot;Shout&quot;, &quot;Living&quot;, &quot;Platinum Magazine&quot;, &quot;Evergreen&quot;, &quot;Animals &amp; You&quot; and &quot;Animal Planet&quot; would be closed with 300 employees being made redundant. In January 2024, the company announced plans to eliminate 55 jobs and shutter four titles: &quot;This England&quot;, &quot;My Weekly Pocket Novels&quot;, &quot;110% Gaming&quot; and &quot;Unicorn Universe&quot;.

<doc id="393569" wikidata="Q57331" url="?curid=393569" title="Qaboos bin Said">
<text>Qaboos bin Said Al Said (, ; 18 November 1940 – 10 January 2020) was Sultan of Oman from 23 July 1970 until his death in 2020. A fifteenth-generation descendant of the founder of the House of Al Said, he was the longest-serving leader in the Middle East and Arab world at the time of his death, having ruled for almost half a century.

The only son of Said bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Qaboos was educated in Suffolk, England. After graduating from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, he served briefly in the British Army. He returned to Oman in 1966 and was the subject of considerable restrictions from his father. In 1970, Qaboos ascended to the Omani throne after overthrowing his father in a coup d&#x27;état, with British support. The country was subsequently renamed the Sultanate of Oman.

As sultan, Qaboos implemented a policy of modernization and ended Oman&#x27;s international isolation. His reign saw a rise in the country&#x27;s living standards, the abolition of slavery, the end of the Dhofar Rebellion, and the promulgation of Oman&#x27;s constitution. Suffering from poor health in later life, Qaboos died in 2020. He had no children, so he entailed the royal court to reach consensus on a successor upon his death. As a precaution, he hid a letter which named his successor in case an agreement was not achieved. After his death, the royal court named his intended successor, his cousin Haitham bin Tariq, as sultan.

==Early life and education==

Qaboos bin Said was born in the southern city of Salalah in Dhofar on 18 November 1940 as the only son of Sultan Said bin Taimur Al Said and Mazoon bint Ahmad Al Mashani. He received his primary and secondary education at Salalah, and was sent to a private educational establishment at Bury St Edmunds in England at age 16. At 20, he entered the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. After graduating from Sandhurst in September 1962, he joined the British Army and was posted to the 1st Battalion The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles), serving with them in Germany for one year. He also held a staff appointment with the British Army.

After his military service, Qaboos studied local government subjects in England and then completed his education with a world tour chaperoned by Leslie Chauncy. Upon his return in 1966, he was placed under virtual house arrest in Al Hosn Palace in Salalah by his father. Here he was kept isolated from government affairs, except for occasional briefings by his father&#x27;s personal advisers. Qaboos studied Islam and the history of his country. His personal relationships were limited to a handpicked group of palace officials who were sons of his father&#x27;s advisors and a few expatriate friends such as Tim Landon. Sultan Said said that he would not allow his son to be involved with the developing planning process, and Qaboos began to make known his desire for change—which was quietly supported by his expatriate visitors.

== Rise to power ==
Qaboos acceded to the throne on 23 July 1970 following a successful coup against his father, with the aim of ending the country&#x27;s isolation and using its oil revenue for modernization and development. He declared that the country would no longer be known as Muscat and Oman, but would change its name to &quot;the Sultanate of Oman&quot; in order to better reflect its political unity.

The coup was supported by the British, with Ian Cobain writing that it was &quot;planned in London by MI6 and by civil servants at the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office&quot; and sanctioned by the Prime Minister, Harold Wilson.

The first pressing problem that Qaboos bin Said faced as sultan was an armed communist insurgency from South Yemen, the Dhofar Rebellion (1962–1976). The sultanate eventually defeated the incursion with help from the Shah of Iran, Jordanian troops sent by his friend King Hussein of Jordan, British Special Forces and the Royal Air Force.

== Reign ==
There were few rudiments of a modern state when Qaboos took power. Oman was a poorly developed country, severely lacking in infrastructure, healthcare, and education, with only of paved roads and a population dependent on subsistence farming and fishing. Qaboos modernized the country using oil revenues. Schools and hospitals were built, and a modern infrastructure was laid down, with hundreds of kilometres of new roads paved, a telecommunications network established, projects for a port and airport that had begun prior to his reign were completed and a second port was built, and electrification was achieved. The government also began to search for new water resources and built a desalination plant, and the government encouraged the growth of private enterprise, especially in development projects. Banks, hotels, insurance companies, and print media began to appear as the country developed economically. The Omani riyal was established as the national currency, replacing the Indian rupee and Maria Theresa thaler. Later, additional ports were built, and universities were opened. In his first year in power, Qaboos also abolished slavery in Oman.

The political system which Qaboos established was an absolute monarchy. The Sultan&#x27;s birthday, 18 November, is celebrated as Oman&#x27;s national holiday. The first day of his reign, 23 July, is celebrated as Renaissance Day.

Oman has no system of checks and balances, and thus no separation of powers. All power was concentrated in the Sultan during his reign, and he served as prime minister, minister of foreign affairs, minister of defence, chief of staff of the armed forces, and chairman of the board of the Central Bank of Oman. All legislation since 1970 has been promulgated through royal decrees, including the 1996 Basic Law. The sultan appoints judges, and can grant pardons and commute sentences. The sultan&#x27;s authority is inviolable.

Qaboos&#x27; closest advisors were reportedly security and intelligence professionals within the Palace Office, headed by General Sultan bin Mohammed al Numani.

===2011 Omani protests===

The 2011 Omani protests were a series of protests in the Persian Gulf country of Oman that occurred as part of the revolutionary wave popularly known as the &quot;Arab Spring&quot;. The protesters demanded salary increases, lower living costs, the creation of more jobs and a reduction in corruption. Protests in Sohar, Oman&#x27;s fifth-largest city, centered on the Globe Roundabout. The Sultan&#x27;s responses included the dismissal of a third of the governing cabinet.

According to CBS News, 19 June 2011, Several protest leaders have been detained and released in rolling waves of arrests during the Arab Spring, and dissatisfaction with the state of affairs in the country is high. While disgruntlement amongst the populace is obvious, the extreme dearth of foreign press coverage and lack of general press freedom there leaves it unclear as to whether the protesters want the sultan to leave, or simply want their government to function better. Beyond the recent protests, there is concern about succession in the country, as there is no heir apparent or any clear legislation on who may be the next Sultan.
The Sultan did give token concession to protesters yet detained social media activists. In August 2014, The Omani writer and human rights defender Mohammed Alfazari, the founder and editor-in-chief of the e-magazine Mowatin &quot;Citizen&quot;, disappeared after going to the police station in the Al-Qurum district of Muscat, only to be pardoned some time later.

===Foreign policy===
Under Qaboos, Oman fostered closer ties with Iran than other Arab states of the Persian Gulf, and was careful to appear neutral and maintain a balance between the West and Iran. As a result, Oman often acted as an intermediary between the United States and Iran. Qaboos helped mediate secret US–Iran talks in 2013 that paved the way to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action two years later.

In 2011, Qaboos facilitated the release of American hikers who were held by Iran, paying $1 million for their freedom.

Oman did not join the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen against the Houthis in 2015, and did not take sides in a Persian Gulf dispute that saw Saudi Arabia and its allies impose an embargo on Qatar in 2017.

In October 2018, Qaboos invited Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu to visit Oman, despite his country not having official diplomatic ties with Israel. Netanyahu was the first Israeli prime minister to visit Oman since Shimon Peres in 1996.

==Philanthropy==
Qaboos financed the construction or maintenance of a number of mosques, notably the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque, as well as the holy places of other religions.

Through a donation to UNESCO in the early 1990s, Qaboos funded the Sultan Qaboos Prize for Environmental Preservation, to afford recognition to outstanding contributions in the management or preservation of the environment. The prize has been awarded biannually since 1991.

==Personal life==
Qaboos was a Muslim of the Ibadi denomination, which has traditionally ruled Oman. Although Oman is predominantly Muslim, the Sultan granted freedom of religion in the country and financed the construction of four Catholic and Protestant churches in the country as well as several Hindu temples.

The Sultan was an avid fan and promoter of classical music. His 120-member orchestra consists entirely of young Omanis who, since 1986, audition as children and grow up as members of the symphonic ensemble. They play locally and traveled abroad with the Sultan. Argentine composer Lalo Schifrin was commissioned to compose a work entitled &quot;Symphonic Impressions of Oman&quot;. Qaboos was particularly enthusiastic about the pipe organ. The Royal Opera House Muscat features the second largest mobile pipe organ in the world, which has three specially made organ stops, named the &quot;Royal Solo&quot; in his honour. He was also a patron of local folk musician Salim Rashid Suri, whom he made a cultural consultant.

On 22 March 1976, Qaboos married his first cousin Sayyida Nawwal bint Tariq Al Said (born 1951), the daughter of his uncle Sayyid Tariq bin Taimur and Sayyida Shawana bint Nasir Al Busaidiyah. Nawwal was renamed Kamila at the time of her marriage and is the half-sister of Qaboos&#x27; successor, Haitham bin Tariq. The marriage ended in divorce in 1979 and produced no children.

In September 1995, Qaboos was involved in a car accident in Salalah just outside his palace, which killed one of his most prominent and influential ministers, the deputy prime minister for finance and economy, Qais Bin Abdul Munim Al Zawawi.

Qaboos owned several yachts administered by the Oman Royal Yacht Squadron, including &quot;Al Said&quot; and &quot;Fulk Al Salamah&quot;, two of the world&#x27;s largest yachts.

Qaboos was known for maintaining a degree of secrecy regarding his personal life. His choice to remain single, along with the rumors regarding his private relationships, added an element of ambiguity to his persona.

==Illness and death==
Qaboos had suffered from colon cancer since 2014, for which he received treatment. On 14 December 2019, he was reported to be terminally ill from the disease after being admitted to the UZ Leuven hospital in Belgium, and opted to return home because he wanted to die in his own country. He died on 10 January 2020 at the age of 79.

Following his death, the royal court declared three days of national mourning and halted all public and private official business for the same period, announcing the national flag would be flown at half-mast for a period of 40 days. Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Jordan, Lebanon, and Egypt all declared three days of mourning; India and Bangladesh declared one day of mourning. The United Kingdom lowered flags to half-mast as a sign of respect, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson described Qaboos as a &quot;father of the nation&quot;, and &quot;an exceptionally wise and respected leader&quot; who &quot;sought to improve the lives of the Omani people&quot; and contributed to the country&#x27;s development &quot;into a stable and prosperous nation&quot;.

==Succession==

Unlike the heads of other Arab states of the Persian Gulf, Qaboos did not publicly name an heir. Article 6 of the constitution says the Royal Family Council has three days to choose a new sultan from the date the position falls vacant. If the Royal Family Council fails to agree, a letter containing a name penned by Sultan Qaboos should be opened in the presence of the Defence Council of military and security officials, supreme court chiefs, and heads of the upper and lower houses of the consultative assemblies. Analysts saw the rules as an elaborate means of Qaboos securing his choice for successor without causing controversy by making it public during his lifetime, since it was considered unlikely that the royal family would be able to agree on a successor on its own.

Qaboos had no children, and only one sister, Sayyida Umaima (who predeceased him in 2002), but no male siblings; there are other male members of the Omani royal family including paternal uncles and their families. Using same-generation primogeniture, the successor to Qaboos would appear to be the children of his late uncle Sayyid Tariq bin Taimur, Oman&#x27;s first prime minister and the Sultan&#x27;s former father-in-law. Oman watchers believed the top contenders to succeed Qaboos were three of Tariq&#x27;s sons: Asa&#x27;ad bin Tariq, Deputy Prime Minister for International Relations and Cooperation and the Sultan&#x27;s special representative; Shihab bin Tariq, a retired commander of the Royal Navy of Oman; and Haitham bin Tariq, Minister of Heritage and National Culture.

On 11 January 2020, Oman state TV said the Royal Family Council, in a letter to the Defense Council, had decided to defer to the choice that Qaboos named in his will, and thus had opened the letter by Qaboos naming his successor, announcing shortly that Haitham bin Tariq is the country&#x27;s ruling sultan. Haitham has two sons and two daughters.

<text>A subvariety (Latin: subvarietas) in botanical nomenclature is a taxonomic rank. They are rarely used to classify organisms.

==Plant taxonomy==
Subvariety is ranked: 
*below that of variety (&quot;varietas&quot;)
*above that of form (&quot;forma&quot;).

Subvariety is an infraspecific taxon.

===Name===
Its name consists of three parts: 
#a genus name (genera)
#a specific epithet (species)
#an infraspecific epithet (subvariety)

To indicate the subvariety rank, the abbreviation &quot;subvar.&quot; is put before the infraspecific epithet.

<doc id="393576" wikidata="Q336285" url="?curid=393576" title="Thomas Remengesau Jr.">
<text>Thomas Esang &quot;Tommy&quot; Remengesau Jr. (born 28 February 1956) is a Palauan politician. In 2013, he was elected the ninth president of Palau and was re-elected to that office in 2016. Previously he served as the seventh president of the island nation from 2001 to 2009. He served as a Senator in the Palau National Congress between his two administrations. In sum, Remengesau was elected Vice-President of Palau in 1992 and 1996, then president in 2000, 2004, 2012 and 2016.

Intending to make Palau less dependent upon United States aid, Remengesau has promoted the expansion and growth of tourism in Palau with the slogan &quot;Preserve the Best and Improve the Rest&quot;. The &quot;best&quot; refers to Palau&#x27;s especially bountiful and diverse marine water resources surrounding the islands, and, as a venue of underwater attractions, its reputation among the very top in the world. In foreign affairs, Remengesau has actively advanced Palau&#x27;s presence in the United Nations, elevating Palau to leadership among the international community through such environmental initiatives as the Micronesian Challenge. He is also a leader among South Pacific nations in advocating awareness of global warming and its effects in the South Pacific Region.

==Early life==
Remengesau was born in Koror, Palau. His father was Thomas Remengesau Sr., who was District Administrator of Palau during the Trust Territory era, as well as Minister of Justice, Vice President, and briefly President of Palau. His mother, Ferista Esang Remengesau, also served as First Lady of Palau. Remengesau was educated at Grand Valley State University in Allendale, Michigan, in the United States, graduating from there in 1979.

==Political career==
===First service as senator, vice presidency, and first presidency===

At 28 years old, Remengesau targeted the youth voting bloc of Palau and successfully lobbied for their support, in the process becoming known as one of the forefront advocates for the youth of Palau. Remengesau was then elected in 1984 to the Palau National Congress (Olbiil Era Kelulau), carried by the youth and a grassroots campaign to become the youngest senator in the nation&#x27;s history at the age of 28. In 1992, he was elected Vice President of Palau and served two terms. He held the additional portfolio of Minister of Administration of Palau. In 2000, with the support of outgoing President Kuniwo Nakamura, he won the presidential election, defeating ex-senator Peter Sugiyama by a margin of 52% to 46%. He easily won re-election in 2004, defeating Polycarp Basilius by a margin of 66.5% to 33.5%, in a race dogged with rumors of improper financial influence from Taipei and Beijing.

===As Senator again===
Remengesau announced in 2008 that he would seek a senatorial seat in the Senate of Palau in the 2008 general election. He came in 11th in the election.

Remengesau was succeeded by President Johnson Toribiong on January 15, 2009.

In April 2009, Special Prosecutor Michael Copeland, who served as Assistant Attorney General of Palau, launched an investigation along with a Special Task Force, stating that &quot;office received information that gave probable cause to believe evidence of criminal activity is contained on the hard drives of seized computers.&quot; Senator Remengesau decried the whole process as an act of &quot;selective prosecution&quot;. After much speculation and media tabloid surrounding the investigation, Remengesau was found only to have been guilty of not filing properties of land and their values and accrued interest. Remengesau was charged with 19 counts of violating Palau&#x27;s code of ethics for failing to disclose his interests in real properties and other assets in 2002 and 2003. The charges bear on the lack of filing of the transfers and the values of said properties. Remengesau has said that, &quot;I am being charged for basically technical information related to the filing of personal assets under the
Code of Ethics law.&quot; “It was incomplete but it’s not like that we did not file anything. When we filed in years 2000-2002, we believed that what we were filing was in compliance with the law,” Remengesau said.

When asked about the verdict, he replied: “It is interesting because in our inquiries, roughly 90 percent filed the same way I did. And it is also an eye opener. I learned a lot from this trial and I hope other officials will also learn something from this because they will now change the way they disclose their assets.” He added, “From now on, everyone who acquired land through tradition will also disclose it in their financial disclosure.” In April 2010, Associate Justice Kathleen Salii imposed a fine of US$156,400 on Remengesau. Although prosecutor Michael Copeland recommended a fine of US$1,357,500, Copeland would go on to express his satisfaction with the sentence in media interviews.

===Second presidency===
He took office as President again in 2013, after defeating his successor Johnson Toribiong in the November 2012 Palauan election. Due to his work regarding Palau&#x27;s environment, Remengesau received the Pacific Champion Award in 2013, as well as the United Nations&#x27; Champion of the Earth title, the Inspiring Conservation Award, and the IGFA Conservation Award, all in 2014. In 2016, he received the Peter Benchley Ocean Award for Excellence in National Stewardship. He appeared in the 2016 documentary film &quot;Before the Flood&quot; to discuss the vulnerability of Palau to sea level rise.

He was challenged in his bid for a fourth term in the November 2016 election by his brother-in-law, Senator Surangel Whipps Jr. He received 5,109 votes compared to Whipps&#x27; 4,854. He succeeded his father as the Maderngebuked of Ngaraard.

== Personal life ==
He is married to Debbie Remengesau.

<text>Hocico () is a Mexican electro-industrial duo that was formed in 1993 in Mexico City.

== History ==
Hocico was officially formed in 1993 by cousins Eric Garcia (aka Erk Aicrag) and Oscar Mayorga (aka Racso Agroyam), with Eric writing lyrics and performing the vocals and Oscar responsible for the programming. They had experimented with electronic music since they were teenagers and were influenced by industrial artists such as Skinny Puppy. Their interest in the industrial and EBM genres led them to begin their musical career in 1989 in a group called Niñera Degenerada. In 1992 the two cousins left the band and went on to form Hocico de Perro.

Soon after they dropped the &quot;de Perro&quot; and continued simply as Hocico. The Spanish word &quot;hocico&quot; translates to &#x27;snout&#x27; or &#x27;muzzle&#x27; in English, and is used in Mexico as a disrespectful way to describe someone&#x27;s comments coming out of their mouth. In certain contexts, &quot;callate el hocico&quot; could be interpreted as, essentially, &quot;shut your fucking mouth,&quot; which the band thought described their musical attitude well.

Between 1993 and 1996 the band produced several cassette demos - &quot;Misuse, Abuse And Accident&quot;, &quot;Autoagresión Persistente&quot;, and &quot;Triste Desprecio&quot;. In 1997 the band released their first full CD, &quot;Odio Bajo El Alma&quot;, on the label Opción Sónica with European distribution through Out Of Line.

The release of &quot;Odio Bajo El Alma&quot; was well received in Europe and America but caught the Anglo- and Euro-centric scene by surprise, with many unaware that the band&#x27;s style of electronic music was happening in Mexico. In fact, before 1997, Hocico along with many other Mexico City based electronic bands had been part of a collective called La Corporación that attempted to support and promote their type of music across Mexico. Other bands involved in La Corporación included Cenobita, Ogo, Encefálisis, and Deus Ex Machina.

The end of the 1990s saw two more albums released on Out Of Line: the live album &quot;Los Hijos Del Infierno&quot;, recorded during the band&#x27;s 1998 European tour, and &quot;Sangre Hirviente&quot;. In 1999, the band played at the Zillo festival in Germany and the Euro Rock festival in Belgium. The band returned to Europe in 2000 to play the Elegi Festival in Paris and the Woodstage Festival in Germany, the latter having an attendance of more than 20,000 people. In 2001, Hocico opened for German band Rammstein during their Mexican tour.

In 2002, the band released the album &quot;Signos De Aberracion&quot; (translated: &quot;Signs of Aberration&quot;), the subject matter of which treated on disturbing events within their social environment at the time.

After the release of their 2004 album, &quot;Wrack And Ruin&quot;, the band went on a short hiatus. During this interlude, the band took time to finish their first DVD, &quot;A Través De Mundos Que Arden&quot;, and to help produce other Mexican bands, while Eric also focused on his solo project, Rabia Sorda. Eric also relocated during this time to Leipzig, Germany while Oscar remained primarily in Mexico City.

In 2008, Hocico returned with the album &quot;Memorias Atrás&quot;, with the theme of &quot;leaving memories behind.&quot; The album was released in three versions, one of which was a box set with 3D cover artwork.

Since 2008 the band has released an album roughly every two years, interspersed with various live albums, compilations, and singles. 2017&#x27;s release, &quot;The Spell of the Spider&quot;, reached #42 on the German national charts. 2019&#x27;s &quot;Artificial Extinction&quot; deals with the concept of artificial intelligence as a threat to humanity and features artwork by German artist Jochen Schilling. &quot;Artificial Extinction&quot; reached #30 on the German national charts.

==Style and influences==
Hocico&#x27;s songs are performed in both Spanish and English. The band prefers to use English in order to reach a greater audience, but also wrote songs in Spanish to connect specifically with their home audience.

The band is known for producing an aggressive style of electronic music, which they attribute to their experiences growing up and living in Mexico City. In a 2003 interview, the band stated:
Stylistically, the band&#x27;s music is centered in the electro-industrial and EBM genres and, in particular, the &quot;aggrotech&quot; sub-genre. In later years the band have also produced tracks in an aggressive, industrial style of drum and bass.

Hocico has toured extensively over their career with their live shows projecting the same sort of aggressive energy of their musical style, sometimes to the point of physical injury. Their two-person stage presence has taken more of a visual presence over the years including, at times, the addition of performers such as mariachi musicians and Aztec-themed dancers.

The band&#x27;s musical influences include electronic and industrial bands such as Skinny Puppy, Leæther Strip, Pouppée Fabrikk, Ministry, Cat Rapes Dog, and Depeche Mode as well as punk bands like Suicidal Tendencies and Dead Kennedys. The band also has an affinity for heavy metal and, although typically billed live with other industrial/EBM acts or similarly curated events, they have played at metal music festivals such as Force Metal Fest 2015 in Guadalajara along with Judas Priest and Overkill.

==Side projects and collaborations==
Aicrag has a side project called Rabia Sorda while Agroyam has one called Dulce Liquido.

In 2002, Aicrag contributed vocals to the Tristesse de la Lune track, &quot;Eiskalte Liebe&quot;.

In 2016, Aicrag contributed music and vocals to the Ost+Front album &quot;Ultra&quot; and their &quot;Fiesta De Sexo&quot; Maxi.

In April 2020, Blutengel and Hocico jointly created a track named &quot;Obscured&quot; and released it as a maxi single in preparation for their European &quot;Living the Darkness&quot; tour.

<text>A golf course is the grounds on which the sport of golf is played. It consists of a series of holes, each consisting of a tee box, a fairway, the rough and other hazards, and a green with a cylindrical hole in the ground, known as a &quot;cup&quot;. The cup holds a flagstick, known as a &quot;pin&quot;. A standard round of golf consists of 18 holes, and as such most courses contain 18 distinct holes; however, there are many 9-hole courses and some that have holes with shared fairways or greens. There are also courses with a non-standard number of holes, such as 12 or 14.

The vast majority of golf courses have holes of varying length and difficulties that are assigned a standard score, known as par, that a proficient player should be able to achieve; this is usually three, four or five strokes. Par-3 courses consist of holes all of which have a par of three. Short courses have gained in popularity; these consist of mostly par 3 holes, but often have some short par 4 holes.

Many older courses are links, often coastal. The first golf courses were based on the topography of sand dunes and dune slacks with a ground cover of grasses, exposed to the wind and sea. Courses are private, public, or municipally owned, and typically feature a pro shop. Many private courses are found at country clubs.

==History==
The golf course has its roots dating to the 18th century. The 18-hole course Old Course was established in 1764 at St Andrews, Scotland and has existed under its name since 1895.

In 2009, Nullarbor Links, the world&#x27;s longest golf course spanning 1,365 kilometres, was established along the Eyre Highway, in Australia.

In 2023, the golf course at Moundbuilders Country Club, was integrated into the world heritage-listed Hopewell Culture National Historical Park.

==Design==

Although a specialty within landscape design or landscape architecture, golf course architecture is considered a separate field of study. Some golf course designers become celebrities in their own right, such as Alister MacKenzie; others are professional golfers of high standing and demonstrated appreciation for golf course composition, such as Jack Nicklaus. The field is partially represented by the American Society of Golf Course Architects, the European Institute of Golf Course Architects, and the Society of Australian Golf Course Architects, although many of the finest golf course architects in the world choose not to become members of any such group, as associations of architects are not government-sanctioned licensing bodies, but private groups. While golf courses often follow the original landscape, some modification is unavoidable. This is increasingly the case as new courses are more likely to be sited on less optimal land. Bunkers and sand traps are always built in by architects unless the formation of such items is already in the course&#x27;s natural terrain.

The layout of a course follows certain traditional principles, such as the number of holes (nine and 18 being most common), their par values, and the number of holes of each par value per course. It is also preferable to arrange greens to be close to the tee box of the next playable hole, to minimize travel distance while playing a round, and to vary the mix of shorter and longer holes. Combined with the need to package all the fairways within what is frequently a compact square or rectangular plot of land, the fairways of a course tend to form an oppositional tiling pattern. In complex areas, two holes may share the same tee box, fairway, or even green. It is also common for separate tee-off points to be positioned for men, women, and amateurs, each one respectively lying closer to the green. Eighteen-hole courses are traditionally broken down into a &quot;front 9&quot; (holes 1–9) and a &quot;back 9&quot; (holes 10–18). On older courses (especially links courses, like the Old Course at St. Andrews), the holes may be laid out in one long loop, beginning and ending at the clubhouse, and thus the front 9 is referred to on the scorecard as &quot;out&quot; (heading out away from clubhouse) and the back 9 as &quot;in&quot; (heading back in toward the clubhouse). More recent courses (and especially inland courses) tend to be routed with the front 9 and the back 9 each constituting a separate loop beginning and ending at the clubhouse. This is partly for the convenience of the players and the club, as then it is easier to play just a 9-hole round, if preferred, or stop at the clubhouse for a snack between the front 9 and the back 9.

A successful design is as visually pleasing as it is playable. With golf being a form of outdoor recreation, the strong designer is an adept student of natural landscaping who understands the aesthetic cohesion of vegetation, water bodies, paths, grasses, stonework, and woodwork, among many other elements.

===Par===
Most golf courses have only par-3, −4, and −5 holes, although some courses include par-6 holes. The Ananti CC and the Satsuki golf course in Sano, Japan, are the only courses with par-7 holes.

Par is primarily determined by the playing length of each hole from the teeing ground to the putting green. Holes are generally assigned par values between three and five, which includes a regulation number of strokes to reach the green based on the average distance a proficient golfer hits the ball, and two putts. On occasion, factors other than distance are taken into account when setting the par for a hole; these include altitude, terrain and obstacles that result in a hole playing longer or shorter than its measured distance, e.g. route is significantly uphill or downhill, or requiring play of a stroke to finish short of a body of water before hitting over it.

Under the United States Golf Association, the typical distances for the various holes from standard tees are as follows:

Men
:*Par 3 – Under 
:*Par 4 – 
:*Par 5 – 
:*Par 6 – or longer

Women
:*Par 3 – Under 
:*Par 4 – 
:*Par 5 – 
:*Par 6 – or longer

==Features==
===Teeing area===

The first section of every hole consists of the teeing ground, or tee-box. There is typically more than one available box where a player places his ball, each one a different distance from the hole (and possibly with a different angle of approach to the green or fairway) to provide differing difficulty. The teeing ground is generally as level as feasible, with closely mown grass very similar to that of a putting green, and most are slightly raised from the surrounding fairway.

Each tee box has two markers showing the bounds of the legal tee area. The teeing area spans the distance between the markers, and extends two-club lengths behind the markers. A golfer may stand outside the teeing area, but the ball must be placed and hit from inside it. A golfer may place his ball directly on the surface of the teeing ground (called hitting it &quot;off the deck&quot;), or the ball may be supported by a manufactured tee (limited to a height of four inches), or by any natural substance, such as a mound of sand placed on the teeing surface.

===Fairway and rough===

After the first shot from the tee (&quot;teeing off&quot;), the player whose ball is farthest from the green hits the ball from where it came to rest; this spot is known as its &quot;lie&quot;. When the ball is in play and not out of bounds or in a hazard the player must play the ball as it lies. The area between the tee box and the putting green where the grass is cut even and short is called the &quot;&quot;. The area between the fairway and the out-of-bounds markers, and also between a mowed apron surrounding the green and out of bounds, is the &quot;rough&quot;; the grass there is cut higher and is often of a coarser strain than on the fairways, making roughs disadvantageous areas from which to hit. On par-3 holes, the player is expected to be able to drive the ball to the green on the first shot from the tee box. On holes longer than par 3, players are expected to require at least one additional shot to reach their greens.

While many holes are designed with a direct line-of-sight from the teeing ground to the green, a hole may bend either to the left or to the right. This is called a &quot;dogleg&quot;, in reference to the similarity to a dog&#x27;s ankle. The hole is called a &quot;dogleg left&quot; if the hole angles leftwards, and a &quot;dogleg right&quot; if the hole angles rightwards. A hole&#x27;s direction may bend twice, which is called a &quot;double dogleg&quot;.
Just as there are good-quality grasses for putting greens, there are good-quality grasses for the fairway and rough. The quality of grass influences the roll of the ball as well as the ability of the player to &quot;take a divot&quot; (effectively, the ability to hit down into the ball, hitting the ball first, then hitting the turf and removing a portion of it as the club continues its arc). Fairways on prestigious tours, like the PGA Tour, are cut low. Mowing heights influence the play of the course. For example, the grass heights at U.S. Open events are alternated from one hole to the next in order to make the course more difficult. One example of this is the infamous roughs at U.S. Opens, which are often 3 to 5 inches high, depending on how close to the fairway or green the section of grass will be. This makes it difficult for a player to recover after a bad shot.

Variants of grass used for fairways and roughs include bent grass, Tifway 419 Bermuda grass, rye grass, Kentucky bluegrass, and Zoysiagrass. As in putting-green grass types, not every grass type works equally well in all climate types.
===Greens===
The &quot;putting green&quot;, or simply the &quot;green&quot;, is an area of very closely trimmed grass on relatively even, smooth ground surrounding the hole, allowing players to make precision strokes on it. To &quot;putt&quot; is to play a stroke on this surface, usually with the eponymous &quot;putter&quot; club, which has very low loft so that the ball rolls smoothly along the ground, and hopefully into the cup. The shape and topology of the green can vary almost without limit, but for practical purposes the green is usually flatter than other areas of the course, though gentle slopes and undulations can add extra challenge to players who must account for these variations in their putting line. The green typically does not include any fully enclosed hazards such as sand or water; however, these hazards can often adjacent to the green, and depending on the shape of the green and surrounding hazards, and the location of the hole (which often changes from day to day to promote even wear of the turf of the green), there may not be a direct putting line from a point on the green to the cup.

Golfers use a method known as &quot;reading&quot; the green to enhance their chances of making a putt. Reading a green involves determining the speed, grain, incline, decline and tilt of the green on the line of the putt. Most putts are not struck directly at the hole, instead they must be struck to take into account the characteristics of the green to arrive at the hole at the proper angle and speed. The best players will read the green by walking around the green and studying the characteristics of the green before addressing the ball. Many golfers consider reading the green and putting to be the most difficult part of the game.

The green is typically surrounded by slightly higher grass, cut at a height between that of the green and fairway, and then by the fairway and/or rough. This longer grass surrounding the green is known as the &quot;fringe&quot; and is designed to slow and stop balls rolling along the green from an approach shot or errant putt, preventing them from exiting the green. Though putting strokes can be made on it, the higher grass can interfere with the path of the ball, so players often choose to use a lofted club such as an iron to make a &quot;chip shot&quot; or a &quot;bump and run&quot;, where the ball carries in the air for a few yards and then rolls along the green like a normal putt.

The grass of the putting green (more commonly just &quot;green&quot;) is cut very short so that a ball can roll for a long distance. The most common types of greens are for cold winter, but warmer summer regions (i.e., not extremely warm, as in the Southern and Southwestern United States) are bent grass greens. A green may consist of a thin carpet so that bad weather is not allowed to become a serious factor in maintaining the course. These are considered the best greens because they may be cut to an extremely low height, and because they may be grown from seed. Bent grass does not have grain, which makes it superior as a putting surface. However, bent grass may become infested with &quot;Poa annua&quot;, a costly and time-consuming weed. Augusta National is one of many golf courses to use this type of green. The original design of Augusta National did not include bent grass greens, but in the early 1980s the greens were converted from Bermuda to bent grass. This affected the speed of the greens, making them too quick, and several areas were subsequently remodelled to reduce the slopes and make them more playable. Many other golf courses subsequently made the decision to change from Bermuda to bent grass when they observed increased business at courses that had already changed over.

Another type of grass common for greens is TifDwarf Hybrid Bermuda (other variants exist, but TifDwarf is one of the most common), or simply Bermuda grass. Bermuda is more common in regions that have very warm summers and mild winters, such as the Southern and Southwestern United States. Red Bridge Golf Course was the first course in North Carolina to utilize a special Bermuda called Mini Verde. A green is generally established from sod which has had the soil washed off of it (to avoid soil compatibility problems) and which is then laid tightly over the green, then rolled and topdressed with fine sand. Another common and more economical approach for establishing a putting green is to introduce hybrid Bermuda sprigs (the stolon of the grass which are raked out at the sod farm), which are laid out on the green.

Two downside factors of Bermuda greens are cost of maintenance, and also the existence of grain (the growth direction of the blades of grass), which affects the ball&#x27;s roll and which is called &quot;the grain of the green&quot; and not to be confused with &quot;the rub of the green&quot; which are idiosyncrasies encountered getting through the hole. The slope or break of the green also affects the roll of the ball. The hole, or cup, is always found within the green and must have a diameter of and a depth of at least . Its position on the green is not fixed and typically is changed daily by a greenskeeper in order to prevent excessive localized wear and damage to the turf. A new hole will be cut by a device that removes a plug of the turf from the ground, and the reinforced cup is then moved, before the old hole is filled in with the plug cut from the new hole and levelled. The hole has a flag on a pole positioned in it so that it may be seen from a distance, but not necessarily from the tee. This location marker is officially called the &quot;flagstick&quot; but is also commonly referred to as the &quot;pin&quot;. Flagsticks are made of either coated fiberglass, metal, or wood and have a metal or synthetic bottom (called a ferrule) that is designed to fit in the hole cup.

Putting greens are not all of the same quality. The finest-quality greens are well-kept so that a ball will roll smoothly over the closely mowed grass. Excess water can be removed from a putting green using a machine called a water hog. Golfers describe a green as &quot;fast&quot; if a light stroke on the ball makes it roll a long distance; conversely, on a &quot;slow&quot; green a stronger stroke is necessary to roll the ball the same distance. The exact speed of a green can be determined with a stimp meter. By collecting sample measurements, golf courses can be compared in terms of average green speed. It is, however, illegal by the rules of golf to test the speed of a green while playing by rolling a ball on it, or by feeling or rubbing the green.

The cost of installing and maintaining grass greens constitutes a considerable proportion of the expense of installing and maintaining a golf course. To save money, many low budget courses catering to casual players have sand greens instead of real grass. In recent years, artificial turf has also become an increasingly popular surface as a less costly alternative to grass which more closely resembles the appearance and feel of real grass compared to a sand surface.
===Hazards===
Holes often include hazards, which are special areas that have additional rules for play, and are generally of two types: (1) water hazards, such as ponds, lakes, and rivers; and (2) bunkers, or sand traps.

Special rules apply to playing a ball that falls in a hazard. For example, a player may not touch the ground or water with their club before playing the ball, not even for a practice swing. A ball in any hazard may be played as it lies without penalty. If it cannot be played from the hazard, the ball may be hit from another location, generally with a penalty of one stroke. The Rules of Golf specify exactly the point from which the ball may be played outside a hazard. Bunkers are small to medium areas, usually lower than the fairway but of varying topography, that are filled with sand and generally incorporate a raised lip or barrier. It is more difficult to play the ball from sand than from grass, as the ball may embed itself into the sand, and the loose nature of the sand and more severe sloping of many bunkers make taking one&#x27;s stance more difficult. As in any hazard, a ball in a bunker must be played without touching the sand with the club except during the stroke, and loose impediments (leaves, stones, twigs) must not be moved before making the stroke.

Courses may also have other design features which the skilled player will avoid; there are earth bunkers (pits or depressions in the ground that are not filled with sand but require a lofted shot to escape), high grass and other dense vegetation, trees or shrubs, ravines and other rocky areas, steep inclines, etc.; while disadvantageous to play from, these are typically not considered &quot;hazards&quot; unless specifically designated so by the course (a ravine or creekbed may be termed a &quot;water hazard&quot; even if completely dry)

===Driving range===
Often, a golf course will include among its facilities a practice range or driving range, usually with practice greens, bunkers, and driving areas. Markers showing distances are usually included on a practice range for the golfer&#x27;s information. Driving ranges are also commonly found as separate facilities, unattached to a golf course, where players may simply hit balls into the range for practice or enjoyment.

There may even be a practice course (often shorter and easier to play than a full-scale course), where players may measure the distance they can obtain with a specific club, or in order to improve their swing technique. Practice courses often consist of old holes of a previous design that are kept and maintained for practice purposes or as substitute holes if one or more holes become unplayable; a 21-hole golf course, for instance, will have three additional holes that can be used for practice or as substitutes for a flooded or otherwise damaged hole.

===Signature hole===
Many golf courses have what may be referred to as a &quot;signature hole&quot;. This will commonly be the most memorable, aesthetically pleasing or photogenic hole.

==Types==

===Links===


Links is a Scottish term, from the Old English word hlinc : &quot;rising ground, ridge&quot;, describing coastal sand dunes and sometimes similar areas inland. It is on links land near the towns of central eastern Scotland that golf has been played since the 15th century.

The shallow top soil and sandy subsoil made links land unsuitable for the cultivation of crops or for urban development and was of low economic value. The links were often treated as common land by the residents of the nearby towns and were used by them for recreation, animal grazing and other activities such as laundering clothes.

The closely grazed turf and naturally good drainage of the links was ideal for golf, and areas of longer grass, heather, low growing bushes and exposed sand provided the hazards that are familiar on modern courses. Although early links courses were often close to the sea it was rarely used as a hazard, perhaps due to the instability of the dunes closest to the water and the high cost of hand-made golf balls precluding anything that could result in their irrecoverable loss. The land is naturally treeless and this combined with their coastal location makes wind and weather an important factor in links golf.

Traditional links courses are often arranged with holes in pairs along the coastline; players would play &quot;out&quot; from the town through a series of holes to the furthest point of the course, and then would return &quot;in&quot; along the second set of holes. The holes may share fairways and sometimes greens (such as at St Andrews to economize on land use, but in modern times this is rare due to the potential for injury from balls coming the other way.

Famous links courses include the Old Course at St. Andrews, often described as the &quot;Home of Golf&quot;, and Musselburgh Links, which is generally regarded as the first recorded golf course. The Open Championship, the oldest of golf&#x27;s major championships, is always played on a links course. Links and links-style golf courses have been developed throughout the world, reproducing the broken, treeless terrain with deep bunkers of their Scottish prototypes.

===Executive===
An &quot;executive course&quot; or &quot;short course&quot; is a course with a total par significantly less than that of a typical 18-hole course. Two main types exist:
* A &quot;9-hole course&quot;, typically the type referred to as an &quot;executive course&quot;, has only 9 holes instead of 18, but with the otherwise normal mix of par-3, par-4 and par-5 holes (typically producing a par score of between 34 and 36), and the course can be played through once for a short game, or twice for a full round.
* A &quot;par-3&quot; course has either 9 or 18 holes, and the distance of each hole is a par 3 rating (typically 240 yards or less from the &quot;men&#x27;s&quot; tee), with no par-4 or par-5 holes mandating shots through the green (though, occasionally, a &quot;par-3&quot; course may feature a par-4 or even a par-5 hole). As a result, the total par for 18 holes of a par-3 course would be 54 instead of a typical 68–72. Some par-3 courses still require the use of a wood on some tee shots, and thus a &quot;complete&quot; set of clubs is used.
** A common standardized type of par-3 course is the &quot;Pitch and Putt&quot; course, where each of the 9 or 18 holes has a distance from tee to cup of less than 100 yards, with an overall 18-hole course distance no more than 1,200 yards (so each hole averages 67 yards). This allows the course to be played without a full set of clubs; typically only wedges are needed, possibly a 9-iron for the longest holes, along with a putter, to play the course. The rules for formal Pitch and Putt competitions mandate a three-club limit, consisting of two irons and one putter.

These types of courses provide a faster pace of play than a standard course, and get their name from their target patronage of business executives who would play the course on a long lunch or as part of a meeting. They are also popular with young professionals, because during the normal golf season, the course can usually be played in the time between the end of the work day and sundown.

The popularity of the 9-hole course has waned in recent decades; a full 18-hole course still allows for the player to play only the &quot;front nine&quot; or &quot;back nine&quot; as a shorter game, while attracting more golfers seeking to play a traditional full round of 18 distinct holes. Many older executive courses have been upgraded &quot;in-place&quot; to 18 holes and a traditional par score, or the original course was sold for other development and new land was acquired and built into an 18-hole course. By contrast, par-3 courses, especially Pitch and Putt, are rising in popularity as a compromise between the long play time and high skill levels required of a traditional 18-hole course, and the artificial nature and single-minded putting focus of miniature golf. Pitch and Putt, specifically its governing association the IPPA, has received financial support and logo rights from the R&amp;A.

In 2014, the PGA Tour held a Champions Tour event on a nine-hole par-3 course, the Big Cedar Lodge Legends of Golf in Ridgedale, Missouri, with four (regular division) or three (over-65 division) rounds played over the par-3 course, and one round played on a nearby regulation 18-hole course with par of 71.

===Pitch and putt===

Pitch and putt is an amateur sport, similar to golf and is also known as chip and putt. The maximum hole length for international competitions is with a maximum total course length of . Players may only use three clubs; one of which must be a putter. The game is played from raised artificial teeing surfaces using a tee and it has its own handicap system.

==Ownership and management==
There are three main categories of ownership and management of a golf course: private, commercial, and municipal.

===Private===
A private course is owned and managed by a golf club on behalf of its members, on a non-profit basis. Many of the courses opened during the golf booms in the late 19th and early 20th centuries are of this type. Some courses, such as Augusta National, are highly exclusive and will only allow visitors to play at the invitation of and alongside a member of the club. Others allow visitors at certain times but may insist on advance booking and proof of golfing competency.

===Commercial===
A commercial course is owned and managed by a private organization and is operated for profit. They may be constructed to provide a core or supplementary attraction for visitors to a hotel or commercial resort, as the centrepiece to a real estate development, as an exclusive Country Club, or as a &quot;Pay and Play&quot; course open to the general public. Notable examples include Pinehurst in the US and Gleneagles in Scotland.

===Municipal===
A municipal course is owned and managed by a local government body for the benefit of residents and visitors. Some of the historic Scottish golf courses, including St Andrews and Carnoustie fall into this category along with Bethpage and Pebble Beach in the US and many others of less renown. It is increasingly common for the management of municipal courses to be contracted out to commercial or other organisations or the course to be sold or shut down completely.

===Associated clubs===
Many commercial and municipal establishments have associated golf clubs, who arrange competitions for their members on the courses and may provide clubhouse facilities. In the UK particularly, some older private members clubs have an associated &quot;Artisan&quot; club, originally established to provide low-cost golf with limited playing rights in exchange for unpaid work on the course. These associated clubs may be totally independent organizations from the course management, or may have various degrees of formal or informal links.

== Golf courses around the world ==
As per 2019 there were 38,864 golf courses around the world. A 2019 study revealed that 78% of the world&#x27;s supply of golf courses are located in 10 countries: the United States, Japan, Canada, England, Australia, Germany, France, South Korea, Sweden and Scotland.
==Environmental impact==
Environmental concerns over the use of land for golf courses have grown since the 1960s. Specific issues include the amount of water required for irrigation and the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers in maintenance, as well as the destruction of wetlands and other environmentally important areas during construction. These pesticides run off into bodies of water and cause over flowing of pesticides into water which causes algae blooms that destroys whole ecosystem shutdowns. The United Nations estimates that, worldwide, golf courses consume about 2.5 billion gallons/9.5 billion litres of water per day. The number one method of water use goes toward green regulations and the maintainment of courses. Many golf courses are now irrigated with non-potable water and rainwater. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prohibited the use of Diazinon on golf courses and sod farms because of its negative impact on bird species in 1988.

In 2022 the U.S. Geological Survey reported that the state of Utah uses about 38 million gallons of water on its golf courses per day - enough water to fill almost 58 Olympic-sized swimming pools. Studies have also found that golf courses take up 2,244,415 acres of land nationwide. A golf course&#x27;s carbon footprint is ten times greater than an average person&#x27;s everyday life.

Environmental concerns, along with concerns about cost and human health, have led to research into more environmentally sound practices and turf grasses. The USGA shares best management practices and case studies of U.S. golf courses, on topics such as irrigation efficiency, use of recycled water, stormwater infrastructure, native grasses, and increasing pollinator habitat. Golf course superintendents are often trained in the uses of these practices and grasses. This has led to significant reduction in the amount of water and chemicals on courses. Golf course turf is an excellent filter for water and has been used in communities to cleanse grey water, such as incorporating them into bioswales.

The use of natural creeks and ponds is generally desirable when designing a golf course for their aesthetics and the increase in playing difficulty. However, such areas also typically include wetlands within the flood plain that are unsuitable for golfing and are often filled in and raised to remain dry. In arid areas, dry creek beds can be marked as &quot;water hazards&quot;, but the importation of non-native grasses and other plant life can have a detrimental effect on native landscapes, often requiring non-native soil and large quantities of water and fertilizer to maintain the course. In these areas, course builders are often prohibited from growing and maintaining non-native grass on areas of the course other than the fairway, or even on the fairway itself, in which case only greens are allowed to have grass.

A result of modern equipment is that today&#x27;s players can hit the ball much farther than previously. As a result, because of demand from course customers who possess this enhanced equipment, and also out of an expressed concern for safety, golf course architects have had to lengthen and widen golf courses. Where a 7,000-yard course used to be a great rarity, courses measuring 7,500-yards are now not uncommon, and courses of 8,000-yards are being contemplated. The cause of modern science allows these specifications that cause more acreage to be used up. All this has led to a ten-percent increase in the acreage required to build a typical course. 
Water restrictions established by communities have forced courses to limit the amount of maintained turf grass. While most modern 18-hole golf courses occupy as much as of land, the average course has of maintained turf.

Golf courses can be built on sandy areas along coasts, on abandoned farms, among strip mines, and quarries, and in deserts and forests. Many Western countries have instituted environmental restrictions on where and how courses are allowed to be built. The problem in today&#x27;s society with building multibillion-dollar courses is that it takes the place for much better use of land. Those methods of use include building communities for the homeless and under privileged, national parks and foresty for tourism, growth of wildlife, and animals to roam free. There is also a problem with giving up farm land which is a top necessity in the US economy which causes problems in the supply chain.

In some parts of the world, attempts to build courses and resorts have led to protests, vandalism, and violence. Populists perceive golf as an elitist activity, and thus golf courses become a target for popular opposition. Resisting golf tourism and golf&#x27;s expansion has become an objective of some land-reform movements, especially in the Philippines and Indonesia.

In The Bahamas, opposition to golf developments has become a national issue. Residents of Great Guana Cay and Bimini, for example, are engaged in legal and political opposition to golf developments on their islands, for fear the golf courses will destroy the nutrient-poor balance on which their coral reef and mangrove systems depend.

In Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in arid regions, golf courses have been constructed on nothing more than oil-covered sand. Players may use a roller on the &quot;greens&quot; to smooth the intended path before putting. In November 2022, four Saudi Arabian golf courses were certified by the GEO foundation that solidifies those courses pledge and to higher the sustainability in the courses in the area and to improve economic output. This act was supported by very strict laws in Saudi Arabia including stewardship, carbon and climate footprint reduction, and restoration of the economy as well.

A course in Coober Pedy, Australia, consists of nine holes dug into mounds of sand, diesel fuel, and oil, with no grass appearing anywhere on the course. Players carry a small piece of astroturf from which they tee the ball. Other Australian golf courses in locations where water is scarce or water conservation is a priority sometimes feature &quot;scrapes&quot; in place of greens. These are made of fine dirt which requires raking between uses but does not require watering.

Audubon International has an educational and certification program for golf courses to achieve higher environmental standards and become a Certified Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary.

While golf courses are a big target of pollution and global warming, there has been good efforts of evolving golf into a game which helps the environment and not the latter of destroying it. Golf courses often create large green spaces that serve as habitats for various plants and animals. Some courses incorporate natural features and wildlife corridors, contributing to biodiversity. This is a big step forward in the movement towards a greener environment. Golf courses as a whole also typically require substantial water for irrigation. Properly managed courses can showcase efficient water management practices, such as the use of reclaimed water or sustainable irrigation systems. These are the first crucial stages to conquer environmental issues and the problems within the golf industry. The sustainability issue hits when animals and non invasive plant life are displaced and alteration and distortion to many prominent swamps, wetlands, and other prominent wildlife fixtures.

<text>In philately, a cachet () is a printed or stamped design or inscription, other than a cancellation or pre-printed postage, on an envelope, postcard, or postal card to commemorate a postal or philatelic event. There are both official and private (independent of postal authorities) cachets. They commemorate everything from the first flight on a particular route, to the Super Bowl. Cachets are also frequently made, either by private companies or a government, for first day of issue stamp events or &quot;second-day&quot; stamp events. They are often present on event covers.

The first cacheted FDC (first day cover) was produced by prominent philatelist and cachet maker George Ward Linn in 1923, for the Warren G. Harding memorial stamp issue.

Cachet-making is considered an art form, and cachets may be produced by using any number of methods, including drawing or painting directly onto the envelope, serigraphy, block printing, lithography, engraving, laser printing, attachment of photographs or other paper memorabilia, etc. Frequently, flight cachets (which have also been used in space and on the moon) are rubber-stamped.

The largest and best-known cachet-making companies, which typically produce thousands or tens of thousands of printed cachets for U.S. stamp issues, are ArtCraft (1939–2015), Artmaster, Fleetwood, House of Farnam, and Colorano.

<text>An aerogram, aerogramme, aérogramme, air letter or airletter is a thin lightweight piece of foldable and gummed paper for writing a letter for transit via airmail, in which the letter and envelope are one and the same. Most postal administrations forbid enclosures in these light letters, which are usually sent abroad at a preferential rate. Printed warnings existed to say that an enclosure would cause the mail to go at the higher letter rate.

The use of the term &quot;aerogramme&quot; was officially endorsed at the 1952 Universal Postal Union Postal Union Congress in Brussels. Thereafter, the term &quot;air letter&quot; quickly faded from use.

Most aerograms have an imprinted stamp indicating the prepayment of postage. As such, this meets the definition of being postal stationery. However, some countries such as Zimbabwe and Ireland, sell unstamped aerograms. Unstamped aerograms are referred to as &quot;formular&quot; aerograms and can be issued by either postal authorities or by private companies. Senders are required to write their name and address on the reverse.

==History==
Lieutenant Colonel R. E. Evans first saw the air letter form in Iraq, whilst touring the Commands after his arrival in the Middle East theatre. It had been introduced into the Iraqi postal service in 1933 by the then Inspector General of Posts and Telegraphs, Major Douglas William Gumbley CBE DSO Royal Engineers. The original form, on thin paper sized 124 mm x 99 mm, greyish in colour, with bluelined framing and with the designation legend on the front. It had an embossed effigy of Faisal I of Iraq and was printed by Bradbury Wilkinson.

The aerogram was largely popularized by its use during the Second World War (1939–1945). Lieutenant Colonel R. E. Evans, Royal Engineers, Assistant Director Army Postal Service Middle East Force (MEF), proposed that a lightweight self-sealing letter card that weighed only 1/10 oz (2.8 g) be adopted by the British Army for air mail purposes. He recommended its use to Anthony Eden, the Secretary of State for War during his visit to the Middle East, in late 1940. By January the following year, General Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell, the Commander-in-Chief, MEF was told by Eden that &quot;Your Assistant Director Army Postal Services may forthwith introduce an Air Mail Letter Card Service for the Middle East. Use British stamps from all countries, including Egypt.&quot;.

On 1 March 1941, the air mail service between the Middle East and the UK was started, using a combination of British Overseas Airways flying boats and military transport. The private nature of the air letter ensured its popularity among its users and that popularity, with its lightness, brought about its continued use as the civilian air letter (aerogramme) and the British military &quot;bluey&quot;. (see British Forces Post Office for further information). The aerogramme cost 6d to send anywhere in the world from 1943 to 1966, increasing to 9d until the decimalisation of British currency in 1971, then increasing gradually to 45p (decimal), 18 times the introductory price, in 2006.

On 29 April 1947, the US introduced a 10 cent &quot;Air Letter&quot; Sheet. The same imprinted stamp with the propeller plane was used until updated with a jet airliner image in 1958. The US issued a total of 25 aerograms until 1999. The production of United States aerograms has ceased. &quot;Linn&#x27;s Stamp News&quot; in late 2006 reported that the United States Postal Service had announced as the supply of aerograms on hand at post offices were exhausted the stock would not be replenished. It quotes David Failor, Postal Service executive director of stamp services as explaining, &quot;Demand for these has been next to nothing for the past five years.&quot;

With the decline in postal communication, aerograms have been withdrawn by various postal services. Royal Mail in the United Kingdom discontinued the aerogram in 2012. Japan Post Holdings announced its aerogram service would end on 30 September 2023. , they were still provided by Australia Post and Hongkong Post.

Historically, as the aerogram was the least expensive form of international postal communication, users often went to extreme lengths to make best use of the space available including writing in different colours, in different directions, and printing on the sheets minimising font size and margins.

<text>John Kidd (10 September 1775 – 7 September 1851) was an English physician, chemist and geologist who took a leading role in Oxford&#x27;s &quot;scientific awakening&quot; in the early years of the nineteenth century.

==Biography==
Kidd was born in Westminster, the son of a naval officer, and was educated at Christ Church, Oxford. He became reader in chemistry at Oxford in 1801, and in 1803 was elected the first Aldrichian Professor of Chemistry. He then voluntarily gave courses of lectures on mineralogy and geology. These were delivered in the dark chambers under the Ashmolean Museum, where William Conybeare, William Buckland, Charles Daubeny and others gained their first lessons in geology. Kidd was a popular and instructive lecturer, and through his efforts the geological chair, first held by Buckland, was established.

Kidd&#x27;s two geological publications—his &quot;Outlines of Mineralogy&quot; (1809) and &quot;Geological Essay on the Imperfect Evidence in Support of a Theory of the Earth&quot; (1815)—have been described as providing &quot;the seeds of an Oxford school of geology,&quot; characterized by a distinctive emphasis on diluvial theory. In 1818 he became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians; in 1822 Regius Professor of Medicine in succession to Sir Christopher Pegge; and in 1834 he was appointed keeper of the Radcliffe Library.

In March 1822 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1830 the president of the Royal Society appointed him as one of the eight authors of the Bridgewater Treatises &quot;on the Power, Wisdom, and Goodness of God as Manifested in the Creation.&quot; His treatise on the &quot;Adaptation of External Nature to the Physical Condition of Man,&quot; which was published in 1833, offered &quot;a popular rather than a scientific exposition of facts&quot; and set out to protect readers from materialism and the transmutation of species. Kidd refused to &quot;maintain an argument&quot; about natural theology, addressing himself &quot;exclusively to those who are believers.&quot; He delivered the Harveian Oration before the Royal College of Physicians in 1836.

<text>Andrew McLuckie White (27 July 1930 – 9 November 2015) was a Scottish drummer, primarily a session musician. He is best known for temporarily replacing Ringo Starr on drums for the Beatles&#x27; first single, &quot;Love Me Do&quot;. White was featured on the American 7&quot; single release of the song, which also appeared on the band&#x27;s debut British album, &quot;Please Please Me&quot;. He also played on &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot;, which was the B-side of &quot;Love Me Do&quot;.

White played with other prominent musicians and groups both in the United Kingdom and the United States, including Chuck Berry, Billy Fury, Herman&#x27;s Hermits and Tom Jones. AllMusic called White &quot;one of the busier drummers in England from the late 1950s through the mid-1970s&quot;.

Andrew McLuckie White was born in Stranraer on 27 July 1930, the son of a baker. At the age of 12, he started playing drums in a pipe band, and became a professional session musician at the age of 17. In the 1950s and early 1960s, White played drums with a number of swing and traditional jazz groups and musicians. In 1958 he formed a big band jazz outfit and took it to the American Northeast where he backed rockers like Chuck Berry, the Platters and Bill Haley &amp; His Comets.

White said, &quot;We used some big band arrangements and put a back beat to it to fit in with the rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll thing. I got the chance to hear rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll in the flesh. That was where I got a good idea about what it was supposed to happen, drumwise.&quot; In 1960 in London White recorded with Billy Fury on Fury&#x27;s first album, &quot;The Sound of Fury&quot;, which is generally regarded as Britain&#x27;s first rock and roll album.

In the early 1960s White lived in Thames Ditton and was married to the British Decca artist Lyn Cornell, who later became a member of the Vernons Girls, the Pearls, and also the Carefrees, who had the biggest selling Beatles novelty single ever with &quot;We Love You Beatles,&quot; peaking in the U.S. at No. 39 and staying on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts for five weeks.

==The Beatles==
In September 1962, White received a call from producer Ron Richards asking him to attend a Beatles recording session at the EMI Studios at Abbey Road in London. Richards was record producer George Martin&#x27;s assistant at the time and had used White in the past. The Beatles had recorded &quot;Love Me Do&quot; twice already: at an EMI session on 6 June 1962 with Pete Best on drums when he was still a member of the group; and again on 4 September 1962, now with Ringo Starr on drums, having replaced Best the previous month.

Martin had disapproved of Best&#x27;s drumming and was still unhappy with newcomer Starr&#x27;s drumming. On 11 September 1962, Richards, who was in charge of recording that day, wanted the song recorded again, and the Beatles played &quot;Love Me Do&quot; a third time, this time with White replacing Starr on drums and Starr relegated to playing tambourine. &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot; was also recorded during this session with White playing a &quot;lightweight cha-cha-chá beat&quot; on bongos rather than drums and Starr playing maracas. White says he was paid £5 for the session and 10 shillings for bringing his drum kit, and did not earn any royalties from the sale of the records.

The version of &quot;Love Me Do&quot; with Starr playing drums was used on the early British pressings of the single in 1962. The version with White on drums was used on the first American pressings of the single in 1964, all later releases of the single, on the Beatles&#x27; debut British album, &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, in 1963, and most subsequent albums that included the song. The version with Starr on drums has also been reissued on occasion; it appears on the &quot;Rarities&quot; (1980) compilation, which was released in North America, and received worldwide release on the &quot;Past Masters&quot; compilation in 1988.

A 1992 single includes both the Starr and White versions. An easy way to distinguish between the two versions is that White&#x27;s version features Starr on tambourine; Starr&#x27;s version does not include a tambourine. The Pete Best version of the song, initially thought to be lost, was released for the first time on &quot;Anthology 1&quot; (1995). &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot;, with White drumming, was released on the &quot;B&quot; side of the &quot;Love Me Do&quot; single, and on the &quot;Please Please Me&quot; album.

In a 2012 BBC interview, White claimed that during the 11 September session he also played on a recording of &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, and that this performance was used on the hit single: &quot;From the drum sound I can tell that I was on it, because it was a vastly different sound to Ringo&#x27;s drumset at that time. This was before he got the Ludwig kit. Each drummer gets an individual sound, first of all by the way they tune the drums and then by the way they play the drums.&quot; In any case, he did not participate in the final recording on 26 November, and was only hired for the 11 September session.

This was the only time White played with the Beatles, but it was enough to get him &quot;into the history books&quot;, and the distinction of being one of the so-called &quot;fifth Beatles&quot;. White said that on that day in the studio the only members of the Beatles he worked with were Paul McCartney and John Lennon, because they were the songwriters. &quot;They didn&#x27;t use any written music, and what I had to do was play the routines with them to get an idea what they wanted before we could even start recording.&quot;

==Other projects==
Later, White played on hit records by Herman&#x27;s Hermits, on Tom Jones&#x27;s hit song &quot;It&#x27;s Not Unusual&quot; and on &quot;Shout&quot; by Lulu. He also worked with many other musicians and groups, including Rod Stewart, Anthony Newley, Bert Weedon and the BBC Scottish Radio Orchestra in Glasgow. In the mid-1960s White toured the United States with Marlene Dietrich and performed in her cabaret shows, under the musical direction of the then-unknown composer Burt Bacharach, and, from 1965 until he retired in 1975, the British pianist and composer William Blezard.

White played drums on &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot; again in 2008, this time on a version by a New Jersey–based rock band, the Smithereens. In 2007 the band had recorded &quot;Meet the Smithereens!&quot;, a tribute to the Beatles, covering their entire &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot; album. After Beatles expert Tom Frangione introduced White to the band, they asked White to record with them on their next Beatles tribute album at their House of Vibes recording studio in Highland Park. White&#x27;s drumming on &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot; was released late in 2008 on &quot;B-Sides The Beatles&quot;, an album of Beatles B-side covers from 1962 to 1965. A Smithereens version of &quot;Love Me Do&quot; with White was also recorded during the session, but was left unreleased until a 2020 single release. White also played drums with the Smithereens in May 2008 at a &quot;We Get By with a Little Help from Our Friends&quot; charity health-care fundraiser at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn.

In the late 1980s White moved to United States and lived in Caldwell, New Jersey, where he taught Scottish pipe band drumming. He was also a judge for the Eastern United States Pipe Band Association (EUSPBA), and drum instructor for the New York City Department of Corrections Emerald Pipe Band. He was married to Thea White, a librarian who supplied the voice of Muriel on the Cartoon Network show &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot;. White had a bumper sticker on his car that read &quot;5THBEATLE&quot;. He said that &quot;One of my students gave that to me.&quot;

==Death==
White died after a stroke at his home in Caldwell, New Jersey, on 9 November 2015 at the age of 85.

<doc id="393593" wikidata="Q1231345" url="?curid=393593" title="Paul Kagame">
<text>Paul Kagame ( ; born 23 October 1957) is a Rwandan politician and former military officer who has been the President of Rwanda since 2000. He was previously a commander of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a rebel armed force which invaded Rwanda in 1990. The RPF was one of the main belligerents of the Rwandan Civil War and was the armed force which ended the Rwandan genocide. He was considered Rwanda&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; leader when he was Vice President and Minister of Defence under President Pasteur Bizimungu from 1994 to 2000 after which the vice-presidential post was abolished.

Born to a Tutsi family in southern Rwanda that fled to Uganda when he was two years old, Kagame spent the rest of his childhood there during the Rwandan Revolution, which ended Tutsi political dominance. In the 1980s, Kagame fought in Yoweri Museveni&#x27;s rebel army becoming a senior Ugandan army officer after many military victories led Museveni to the Ugandan presidency. Kagame joined the RPF, taking control of the group when previous leader Fred Rwigyema died on the second day of the 1990 invasion. By 1993, the RPF controlled significant territory in Rwanda and a ceasefire was negotiated. The assassination of Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana set off the genocide, in which Hutu extremists killed an estimated 500,000 to 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu. Kagame resumed the civil war and ended the genocide with a military victory.

During his vice presidency, Kagame controlled the national army and was responsible for maintaining the government&#x27;s power, while other officials began rebuilding the country. Many RPF soldiers carried out retribution killings. Kagame said he did not support these killings but failed to stop them. Hutu refugee camps formed in Zaire and other countries and the RPF attacked the camps in 1996, but insurgents continued to attack Rwanda. As part of the invasion, Kagame sponsored two rebel wars in Zaire. Rwandan- and Ugandan-backed rebels won the first war (1996–97), installing Laurent-Désiré Kabila as president in place of dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and returning Zaire to its former pre-Mobutu name, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The second war was launched in 1998 against Kabila, and later his son Joseph, following the DRC government&#x27;s expulsion of Rwandan and Ugandan military forces from the country. The war escalated into a conflict that lasted until a 2003 peace deal and ceasefire.

Bizimungu resigned in 2000, most likely having been forced to do so, following a falling out with the RPF. He was replaced by Kagame. Bizimungu was later imprisoned for corruption and inciting ethnic violence, charges that human rights groups described as politically motivated. Kagame&#x27;s rule is considered authoritarian, and human rights groups accuse him of political repression. Overall opinion on the regime by foreign observers is mixed, and as president, Kagame has prioritised national development, launching programmes which have led to development on key indicators including healthcare, education and economic growth. Kagame has had mostly good relations with the East African Community and the United States; his relations with France were poor until 2009. Relations with the DRC remain tense despite the 2003 ceasefire; human rights groups and a leaked United Nations report allege Rwandan support for two insurgencies in the country, a charge Kagame denies. Several countries suspended aid payments in 2012 following these allegations. Since coming to power, Kagame has won four presidential elections, but none of these have been rated free or fair by international observers. His role in the assassination of exiled political opponents has been controversial.

==Early life==
Kagame was born on 23 October 1957, the youngest of six children, in Tambwe, Ruanda-Urundi, a village located in what is now the Southern Province of Rwanda. His father, Deogratias Rutagambwa, was a member of the Tutsi ethnic group, from which the royal family had been derived since the 18th century or earlier. A member of the Bega clan, Deogratias Rutagambwa had family ties to King Mutara III, but he pursued an independent business career rather than maintain a close connection to the royal court. Kagame&#x27;s mother, Asteria Bisinda, descended from the family of the last Rwandan queen, Rosalie Gicanda, that is from the Hebera branch of the royal Nyiginya clan. 

At the time of Kagame&#x27;s birth, Rwanda was a United Nations Trust Territory which had been ruled, in various forms, by Belgium since 1916 under a mandate to oversee eventual independence. Rwandans were made up of three distinct groups: the minority Tutsi were the traditional ruling class, and the Belgian colonial administration had long promoted Tutsi supremacy, while the majority Hutu were agriculturalists. The third group, the Twa, were a forest-dwelling pygmy people descended from Rwanda&#x27;s earliest inhabitants, who formed less than of the population.

Tensions between Tutsi and Hutu had been escalating during the 1950s, and culminated in the 1959 Rwandan Revolution. Hutu activists began killing Tutsi, forcing more than 100,000 Tutsis to seek refuge in neighbouring countries. Kagame&#x27;s family abandoned their home and lived for two years in northeastern Rwanda, eventually crossing the border into Uganda. They moved gradually north, and settled in the Nshungerezi refugee camp in the Toro sub-region in 1962. It was around this time that Kagame first met Fred Rwigyema, the future leader of the Rwandan Patriotic Front.

Kagame began his primary education in a school near the refugee camp, where he and other Rwandan refugees learned how to speak English and began to integrate into Ugandan culture. At the age of nine, he moved to the respected Rwengoro Primary School, around 16 kilometres (10 mi) away. He subsequently attended Ntare School, one of the best schools in Uganda, which was also the alma mater of future Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. According to Kagame, the death of his father in the early-1970s, and the departure of Rwigyema to an unknown location, led to a decline in his academic performance and an increased tendency to fight those who belittled the Rwandan population. He was eventually suspended from Ntare and completed his studies at Old Kampala Secondary School.

After completing his education, Kagame made two visits to Rwanda, in 1977 and 1978. He was initially hosted by family members of his former classmates, but upon arrival in Kigali; he made contact with members of his own family. He kept a low profile on these visits, believing that his status as a well-connected Tutsi exile could lead to arrest. On his second visit, he entered the country through Zaire rather than Uganda to avoid suspicion. Kagame used his time in Rwanda to explore the country, familiarise himself with the political and social situation, and make connections that would prove useful to him in his later activities.

==Military career, 1979–1994==
===Ugandan Bush War===
In 1978, Fred Rwigyema returned to western Uganda and reunited with Kagame. During his absence, Rwigyema had joined the rebel army of Yoweri Museveni. Based in Tanzania, it aimed to overthrow the Ugandan government of Idi Amin. Rwigyema returned to Tanzania and fought in the 1979 war during which Museveni&#x27;s rebel group, FRONASA, allied with the Tanzanian army and other Ugandan exiles, defeated Amin. After Amin&#x27;s defeat, Kagame and other Rwandan refugees pledged allegiance to Museveni, who had become a cabinet member in the transition government. Kagame received training at the United States Army Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

Former incumbent Milton Obote won the 1980 Ugandan general election. Museveni disputed the result, and he and his followers withdrew from the new government in protest. In 1981, Museveni formed the rebel Popular Resistance Army (PRA); Kagame and Rwigyema joined as founding soldiers, along with 38 Ugandans. The army&#x27;s goal was to overthrow Obote&#x27;s government, in what became known as the Ugandan Bush War. Kagame took part in the Battle of Kabamba, the PRA&#x27;s first operation, in February 1981.

Kagame and Rwigema joined the PRA primarily to ease conditions for Rwandan refugees persecuted by Obote. They also had a long-term goal of returning with other Tutsi refugees to Rwanda; military experience would enable them to fight the Hutu-dominated Rwandan army. The PRA merged with another rebel group in June 1981, forming the National Resistance Army (NRA). In the NRA, Kagame specialized in intelligence-gathering, and he rose to a position close to Museveni&#x27;s. The NRA, based in the Luwero Triangle, fought the Ugandan army for the next five years, even after Obote was deposed in a 1985 coup d&#x27;état and the start of peace talks.

In 1986, the NRA captured Kampala with a force of 14,000 soldiers, including 500 Rwandans, and formed a new government. After Museveni&#x27;s inauguration as president he appointed Kagame and Rwigyema as senior officers in the new Ugandan army; Kagame was the head of military intelligence. In a 2018 paper, Canadian scholar and Rwanda expert Gerald Caplan described this appointment as a remarkable achievement for a foreigner and a refugee. Caplan noted Museveni&#x27;s reputation for toughness, and said that Kagame would have had to be similarly tough to earn such a position. He also commented on the nature of military intelligence work, saying &quot;it is surely unrealistic to expect that Kagame refrained from the kind of unsavory activities that military security specializes in.&quot; In addition to their army duties, Kagame and Rwigyema began building a covert network of Rwandan Tutsi refugees within the army&#x27;s ranks, intended as the nucleus for an attack on Rwanda. In 1989, Rwanda&#x27;s President Habyarimana and many Ugandans in the army began to criticise Museveni over his appointment of Rwandan refugees to senior positions, and he demoted Kagame and Rwigyema.

Kagame and Rwigeema remained &quot;de facto&quot; senior officers, but the change caused them to accelerate their plans to invade Rwanda. They joined an organisation called the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a refugee association which had been operating under various names since 1979. Rwigyema became the RPF leader shortly after joining and, while still working for the Ugandan army, he and Kagame completed their invasion plans.

===Rwandan Civil War===
In October 1990, Rwigyema led a force of over 4,000 RPF rebels into Rwanda at the Kagitumba border post, advancing south to the town of Gabiro. Kagame was not present at the initial raids, as he was in the United States, attending the Command and General Staff College in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. On the second day of the attack, Rwigyema was shot in the head and killed. The exact circumstances are disputed; the official line of Kagame&#x27;s government, and the version mentioned by historian Gérard Prunier in his 1995 book on the subject, was that Rwigyema was killed by a stray bullet. 

In his 2009 book &quot;Africa&#x27;s World War&quot;, Prunier says Rwigyema was killed by his subcommander Peter Bayingana, following an argument over tactics. According to this account, Bayingana and fellow subcommander Chris Bunyenyezi were then executed on the orders of Museveni. In a 2005 conversation with Caplan, Prunier provided a different account, stating that Bayingana and Bunyenyezi&#x27;s killers were recruited by Kagame. Caplan notes that lack of research means the truth of this is uncertain, but that if true, the &quot;tales of death and intrigue [offer] yet another insight into Kagame&#x27;s character&quot;. Rwigyema&#x27;s death threw the RPF into confusion. France and Zaire deployed forces in support of the Rwandan army, and by the end of October, the RPF had been pushed back into the far north east corner of the country.

Kagame returned to Africa and took command of the RPF forces, which had been reduced to fewer than 2,000 troops. Kagame and his soldiers moved west, through Uganda, to the Virunga Mountains, a rugged high-altitude area where the terrain worked in their favour. From there, he re-armed and reorganised the army, and carried out fundraising and recruitment from the Tutsi diaspora. Kagame restarted combat in January 1991, with an attack on the northern town of Ruhengeri. Benefiting from the element of surprise, the RPF captured the town and held it for a day before retreating back into the forests.

For the next year, the RPF waged a hit-and-run guerrilla war, capturing some border areas but not making significant gains against the Rwandan army. These actions caused an exodus of around 300,000 Hutu from the affected areas. Prunier wrote in 1995 that the RPF were surprised that Hutu peasants &quot;showed no enthusiasm for being &#x27;liberated&#x27; by them&quot;. In her 2018 book &quot;In Praise of Blood&quot;, however, Canadian journalist Judi Rever quoted witnesses who said that the exodus was forced by RPF attacks on the villages including the laying of landmines and shooting of children. Caplan&#x27;s paper questions the credibility of many of the witnesses Rever had spoken to, but noted that &quot;there are considerable other sources besides Rever that attest to RPF war crimes&quot;. 

Following the June 1992 formation of a multi-party coalition government in Kigali, Kagame announced a ceasefire and initiated negotiations with the Rwandan government in Arusha, Tanzania. In early-1993, groups of extremist Hutu formed and began campaigns of large-scale violence against the Tutsi. Kagame responded by suspending peace talks temporarily and launching a major attack, gaining a large swathe of land across the north of the country.

Peace negotiations resumed in Arusha, and the resulting set of agreements, known as the Arusha Accords, were signed in August 1993. The RPF were given positions in a broad-based transitional government (BBTG) and in the national army. The United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), a peacekeeping force, arrived and the RPF were given a base in the national parliament building in Kigali to use during the establishment of the BBTG.

===Rwandan genocide===

On 6 April 1994, Rwandan President Habyarimana&#x27;s plane was shot down near Kigali Airport, killing both Habyarimana and the President of Burundi, Cyprien Ntaryamira, as well as their entourage and three French crew members. The attackers remain unknown. Prunier, in his 1995 book, concluded that it was most likely a coup d&#x27;état carried out by extreme Hutu members of Habyarimana&#x27;s government who feared that the president was serious about honouring the Arusha agreement, and was a planned part of the genocide. This theory was disputed in 2006 by French judge Jean-Louis Bruguière, and in 2008 by Spanish judge Fernando Andreu. Both alleged that Kagame and the RPF were responsible. 

Rever also held Kagame responsible, giving as his motive a desire to plunge Rwanda into disorder and therefore provide a platform for the RPF to complete their conquest of the country. Evaluating the two arguments later in 2018, Caplan questioned the evidence used by Bruguière and Rever, stating that it has been repeatedly &quot;discredited for its methodology and its dependence on sources who have split bitterly with Kagame&quot;. Caplan also noted that Hutu extremists had made multiple prior threats to kill Habyarimana in their journals and radio stations, and cited eyewitness accounts of roadblocks being erected in Kigali and killings initiated within one hour of the crash – evidence that the shooting of the plane was ordered as the initiation of the genocide.

Following Habyarimana&#x27;s death, a military committee led by Colonel Théoneste Bagosora took immediate control of the country. Under the committee&#x27;s direction, the Hutu militia Interahamwe and the Presidential Guard began to kill Hutu and Tutsi opposition politicians and other prominent Tutsi figures. The killers then targeted the entire Tutsi population, as well as moderate Hutu, beginning the Rwandan genocide. Over the course of approximately 100 days, an estimated 206,000 to 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu were killed on the orders of the committee. On 7 April, Kagame warned the committee and UNAMIR that he would resume the civil war if the killing did not stop. 

The next day, the Rwandan government forces attacked the national parliament building from several directions, but the RPF troops stationed there successfully fought back. Kagame began an attack from the north on three fronts, seeking to link up quickly with the troops isolated in Kigali. An interim government was set up but Kagame refused to talk to it, believing that it was just a cover for Bagosora&#x27;s rule. Over the next few days, the RPF advanced steadily south, capturing Gabiro and large areas of countryside to the north and east of Kigali. They avoided attacking Kigali or Byumba at this stage, but conducted manoeuvres designed to encircle the cities and cut off supply routes.

Throughout April there were numerous attempts by UNAMIR to establish a ceasefire, but Kagame insisted each time that the RPF would not stop fighting unless the killings stopped. In late April, the RPF secured the whole of the Tanzanian border area and began to move west from Kibungo, to the south of Kigali. They encountered little resistance, except around Kigali and Ruhengeri. By 16 May, they had cut the road between Kigali and Gitarama, the temporary home of the interim government, and by 13 June, they had taken Gitarama, following an unsuccessful attempt by the Rwandan government forces to reopen the road. The interim government was forced to relocate to Gisenyi in the far north west. As well as fighting the war, Kagame was recruiting heavily to expand the army. The new recruits included Tutsi survivors of the genocide and refugees from Burundi, but were less well trained and disciplined than the earlier recruits.

Having completed the encirclement of Kigali, Kagame spent the latter half of June fighting to take the city. The government forces had superior manpower and weapons, but the RPF steadily gained territory, as well as conducting raids to rescue civilians from behind enemy lines. According to Roméo Dallaire, the force commander of UNAMIR, this success was due to Kagame being a &quot;master of psychological warfare&quot;; he exploited the fact that the government forces were concentrating on the genocide rather than the fight for Kigali, and capitalised on the government&#x27;s loss of morale as it lost territory. The RPF finally defeated the Rwandan government forces in Kigali on 4 July, and on 18 July took Gisenyi and the rest of the north west, forcing the interim government into Zaire and ending the genocide. At the end of July 1994, Kagame&#x27;s forces held the whole of Rwanda except for a zone in the south west, which had been occupied by a French-led United Nations force as part of &quot;Opération Turquoise&quot;.

Kagame&#x27;s tactics and actions during the genocide have proved controversial. Western observers such as Dallaire and Luc Marchal, the senior Belgian peacekeeper in Rwanda at the time, have stated that the RPF prioritised taking power over saving lives or stopping the genocide. Scholars also believe that the RPF killed many Rwandan civilians, predominantly Hutu, during the genocide and in the months that followed. The death toll from these killings is in the tens or even hundreds of thousands. In her book &quot;Leave None to Tell the Story: Genocide in Rwanda&quot;, written for Human Rights Watch, Rwanda expert Alison des Forges wrote that despite saving many lives, the RPF &quot;relentlessly pursued those whom they thought guilty of genocide&quot; and that &quot;in their drive for military victory and a halt to the genocide, the RPF killed thousands, including noncombatants as well as government troops and members of militia&quot;. 

Human rights violations by the RPF during the genocide have also been documented in a 2000 report compiled by the Organisation of African Unity, and by Prunier in &quot;Africa&#x27;s World War&quot;. In an interview with journalist Stephen Kinzer, Kagame acknowledged that killings had occurred but said that they were carried out by rogue soldiers and had been impossible to control. RPF killings continued after the end of the genocide, gaining international attention with the 1995 Kibeho massacre, in which soldiers opened fire on a camp for internally displaced persons in Butare Province. Australian soldiers serving as part of UNAMIR estimated at least 4,000 people were killed, while the Rwandan government claimed that the death toll was 338.

==Vice President and Minister of Defence==
The post-genocide Rwandan government took office in Kigali in July 1994. It was based loosely on the Arusha Accords, but Habyarimana&#x27;s party, MRND was outlawed. The positions it had been assigned were taken over by the RPF. The military wing of the RPF was renamed as the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA), and became the national army. Paul Kagame assumed the dual roles of Vice President of Rwanda and Minister of Defence while Pasteur Bizimungu, a Hutu who had been a civil servant under Habyarimana before fleeing to join the RPF, was appointed president. Bizimungu and his cabinet had some control over domestic affairs, but Kagame remained commander-in-chief of the army and was the de facto ruler of the country. German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle stated that &quot;Bizimungu was commonly seen as a placeholder for Kagame&quot;.

===Domestic situation===

The infrastructure and economy of the country suffered greatly during the genocide. Many buildings were uninhabitable, and the former regime had taken all currency and moveable assets when they fled the country. Human resources were also severely depleted, with over of the population having been killed or fled. Many who remained were traumatised; most had lost relatives, witnessed killings, or participated in the genocide. Kagame controlled the national army and was responsible for maintaining the government&#x27;s power, while other officials began rebuilding the country.

Non-governmental organisations began to move back into the country, and the international community spent US$1.5 billion on humanitarian aid between July and December 1994, but Prunier described this as &quot;largely unconnected with the real economic needs of the community&quot;. Kagame strove to portray the government as inclusive and not Tutsi-dominated. He directed removal of ethnicity from citizens&#x27; national identity cards, and the government began a policy of downplaying the distinctions between Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa.

The unity government suffered a partial collapse in 1995. The continuing violence, along with appointing of local government officials who were almost exclusively RPF Tutsi, caused serious disagreement between Kagame and senior Hutu government members, including prime minister Faustin Twagiramungu and interior minister Seth Sendashonga. Twagiramungu resigned in August, and Kagame fired Sendashonga and three others the next day. Pasteur Bizimungu remained president but the makeup of the new government was predominantly RPF Tutsi loyal to Kagame. 

Twagiramungu and Sendashonga moved abroad to form a new opposition party shortly after leaving the government. Sendashonga, who had also spoken out about the need for punishing killings by rogue RPF soldiers, moved to Kenya. Having survived an attempt on his life in 1996, he was assassinated in Nairobi in May 1998, when a UN vehicle in which he was travelling was fired upon. Many observers believe Kagame ordered the killing; as Caplan noted: &quot;the RPF denied any responsibility, which no one other than RPF partisans believed&quot;.

===Refugee crisis and insurgency===

Following the RPF victory, approximately two million Hutu fled to refugee camps in neighboring countries, particularly Zaire, fearing RPF reprisals for the Rwandan genocide. The camps were set up by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), but were effectively controlled by the army and government of the former Hutu regime, including many leaders of the genocide. This regime was determined to return to power in Rwanda and began rearming, killing Tutsi residing in Zaire, and launching cross-border incursions in conjunction with the &quot;Interahamwe&quot; paramilitary group. By late 1996, the Hutu militants represented a serious threat to the new Rwandan regime, and Kagame launched a counteroffensive.

Kagame first provided troops and military training to aid a rebellion against Zaire by the Banyamulenge, a Tutsi group living near Bukavu in the Zairian South Kivu province. With Rwandan army support, the Banyamulenge defeated local security forces and began attacking the Hutu refugee camps in the area. At the same time, Kagame&#x27;s forces joined with Zairian Tutsi around Goma to attack two of the camps there. Most refugees from the attacked camps moved to the large Mugunga camp. In November 1996, the Rwandan army attacked Mugunga, causing an estimated 800,000 refugees to flee. Many returned to Rwanda despite the presence of the RPF; others ventured further west into Zaire.

Despite the disbanding of the camps, the defeated forces of the former regime continued a cross-border insurgency campaign into Rwanda from North Kivu. The insurgents maintained a presence in Rwanda&#x27;s north western provinces and were supported by the predominantly Hutu population, many of whom had lived in the refugee camps before they were attacked. In addition to supporting the wars in the Congo, Kagame began a propaganda campaign to bring the Hutu to his side. He integrated former soldiers of the deposed genocidal regime&#x27;s military into the RPF-dominated national army and appointed senior Hutu to key local government positions in the areas hit by insurgency. These tactics were eventually successful; by 1999, the population in the north west had stopped supporting the insurgency and the insurgents were mostly defeated.

===Congo wars===

Although his primary reason for military action in Zaire was the dismantling of the refugee camps, Kagame also began planning a war to remove long-time dictator President Mobutu Sese Seko from power. Mobutu had supported the &quot;genocidaires&quot; based in the camps, and was also accused of allowing attacks on Tutsi people within Zaire. Together with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Kagame supported the newly created Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (ADFL), an alliance of four rebel groups headed by Laurent-Désiré Kabila, which began waging the First Congo War. 

The ADFL, helped by Rwandan and Ugandan troops, took control of North and South Kivu provinces in November 1996 and then advanced west, gaining territory from the poorly organised and demotivated Zairian army with little fighting. By May 1997, they controlled almost the whole of Zaire except for the capital Kinshasa; Mobutu fled and the ADFL took the capital without fighting. The country was renamed as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Kabila became the new president. The Rwandan Defence Forces and the ADFL were accused of carrying out mass atrocities during the First Congo War, with as many as 222,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees declared missing.

Kagame and the Rwandan government retained strong influence over Kabila following his inauguration, and the RPA maintained a heavy presence in Kinshasa. Congolese in the capital resented this, as did many in the eastern Kivu provinces, where ethnic clashes increased sharply. In July 1998, Kabila fired his Rwandan chief-of-staff, James Kabarebe, and ordered all RPA troops to leave the country. Kagame accused Kabila of supporting the ongoing insurgency against Rwanda from North Kivu, the same accusation he had made about Mobutu. He responded to the expulsion of his soldiers by backing a new rebel group, the Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD), and launching the Second Congo War. 

The first action of the war was a blitzkrieg by the RCD and RPA, led by Kabarebe. These forces made quick gains, advancing in twelve days from the Kivu provinces west to within of Kinshasa. The capital was saved by the intervention of Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe on Kabila&#x27;s side. Following the failure of the blitzkrieg, the conflict developed into a long-term conventional war, which lasted until 2003 and caused millions of deaths and massive damage. According to a report by the International Rescue Committee (IRC), this conflict led to the loss of between 3 million and 7.6 million lives, many through starvation and disease accompanying the social disruption of the war.

Although Kagame&#x27;s primary reason for the two wars in the Congo was Rwanda&#x27;s security, he was alleged to gain economic benefit by exploiting the mineral wealth of the eastern Congo. The 2001 United Nations &quot;Report of the Panel of Experts on the Illegal Exploitation of Natural Resources and Other Forms of Wealth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo&quot; alleged that Kagame, along with Ugandan President Museveni, were &quot;on the verge of becoming the godfathers of the illegal exploitation of natural resources and the continuation of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo&quot;. The report also claimed that the Rwandan Ministry of Defence contained a &quot;Congo Desk&quot; dedicated to collecting taxes from companies licensed to mine minerals around Kisangani, and that substantial quantities of coltan and diamonds passed through Kigali before being resold on the international market by staff on the Congo Desk. 

International NGO Global Witness also conducted field studies in early 2013. It concluded that minerals from North and South Kivu are exported illegally to Rwanda and then marketed as Rwandan. Kagame dismissed these allegations as unsubstantiated and politically motivated; in a 2002 interview with newsletter &quot;Africa Confidential,&quot; Kagame said that if solid evidence against Rwandan officers was presented, it would be dealt with very seriously. In 2010, the United Nations released a report accusing the Rwandan army of committing wide scale human rights violations and crimes against humanity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the First and Second Congo Wars, charges denied by the Rwandan government.

==Presidency==
===Accession===
In the late 1990s, Kagame began to disagree publicly with Bizimungu and the Hutu-led government in Rwanda. Kagame accused Bizimungu of corruption and poor management, while Bizimungu felt that he had no power over appointments to the cabinet and that the Transitional National Assembly was acting purely as a puppet for Kagame. Bizimungu resigned from the presidency in March 2000. Historians generally believe that Bizimungu was forced into resigning by Kagame after denouncing the National Assembly and attempting to sow discord within the RPF. However, Kagame told Kinzer that he was surprised by the development saying that he had received the &quot;startling news&quot; in a phone call from a friend. Following Bizimungu&#x27;s resignation, the Supreme Court ruled that Kagame should become acting president until a permanent successor was chosen.

Kagame had been de facto leader since 1994, but focused more on military, foreign affairs and the country&#x27;s security than day-to-day governance. By 2000, the threat posed by cross-border rebels was reduced and when Bizimungu resigned, Kagame decided to seek the presidency himself. The transitional constitution was still in effect, which meant the president was elected by government ministers and the Transitional National Assembly rather than by a direct election.

The RPF selected two candidates, Kagame and RPF secretary general Charles Murigande; the ministers and parliament elected Kagame by eighty-one votes to three. Kagame was sworn in as president in April 2000. Several Hutu politicians, including the prime minister Pierre-Célestin Rwigema, left the government at around the same time as Bizimungu, leaving a cabinet dominated by those close to Kagame. Bizimungu started his own party in 2001, but Kagame&#x27;s government banned it on the grounds that political campaigning was not permitted under the transitional constitution. The following year, Kagame issued a public statement to Bizimungu, warning him that the government&#x27;s patience with his continued involvement in party politics was &quot;not infinite&quot;, and Bizimungu was arrested two weeks later and convicted of corruption and inciting ethnic violence, charges which human rights groups said were politically motivated. He was imprisoned until 2007, when he was pardoned by Kagame.

===New constitution===
Between 1994 and 2003, Rwanda was governed by a set of documents combining President Habyarimana&#x27;s 1991 constitution, the Arusha Accords, and some additional protocols introduced by the transitional government. As required by the accords, Kagame set up a constitutional commission to draft a new permanent constitution. The constitution was required to adhere to a set of fundamental principles including equitable power sharing and democracy. The commission sought to ensure that the draft constitution was &quot;home-grown&quot;, relevant to Rwanda&#x27;s specific needs, and reflected the views of the entire population; they sent questionnaires to civil groups across the country and rejected offers of help from the international community, except for financial assistance.

The draft constitution was released in 2003; it was approved by the parliament, and was then put to a referendum in May of that year. The referendum was widely promoted by the government; ultimately, of eligible adults registered to vote and the turnout on voting day was . The constitution was overwhelmingly accepted, with voting in favour. The constitution provided for a two-house parliament, an elected president serving seven-year terms, and multi-party politics. 

The constitution also sought to prevent Hutu or Tutsi hegemony over political power. Article 54 states that &quot;political organizations are prohibited from basing themselves on race, ethnic group, tribe, clan, region, sex, religion or any other division which may give rise to discrimination&quot;. According to Human Rights Watch, this clause, along with later laws enacted by the parliament, effectively make Rwanda a one-party state, as &quot;under the guise of preventing another genocide, the government displays a marked intolerance of the most basic forms of dissent&quot;.

===Elections and referendum===
Since ascending to the presidency in 2000, Kagame has faced four presidential elections, in 2003, 2010, 2017 and 2024. On each occasion, he was re-elected in a landslide, winning more than 90 percent of the vote. A constitutional amendment referendum in 2015, which gave Kagame the ability to stand for additional terms, also passed by similar margins. International election monitors, human rights organisations and journalists generally regard these elections as lacking freedom and fairness, with interventions by the Rwandan state to ensure Kagame&#x27;s victory. According to Ida Sawyer, Central Africa director for Human Rights Watch, &quot;Rwandans who have dared raise their voices or challenge the status quo have been arrested, forcibly disappeared, or killed, independent media have been muzzled, and intimidation has silenced groups working on civil rights or free speech&quot;. Following the 2017 poll, Human Rights Watch released evidence of irregularities by election officials including forcing voters to write their votes in full view and casting votes for electors who had not appeared. The United States Department of State said it was &quot;disturbed by irregularities observed during voting&quot; as well as &quot;long-standing concerns over the integrity of the vote-tabulation process&quot;.

In their 2018 book &quot;How to Rig an Election&quot;, political scientists Nic Cheeseman and Brian Klaas said they were asked by journalists why Kagame went &quot;through the motions of organizing a national poll that he was predestined to win&quot;. The book gave likely reasons for the continuation of the polls, including the fact that elections are &quot;important to secure a base level of international legitimacy&quot; and that &quot;not even pretending to hold elections will get a country kicked out of the African Union&quot;. Law professor and human rights researcher Lars Waldorf wrote that the RPF&#x27;s manipulation of polls could be designed to make itself appear stronger. Waldorf said that the party&#x27;s margins of victory &quot;are not meant to be convincing; rather, they are meant to signal to potential opponents and the populace that Kagame and the RPF are in full control.&quot; Scholars are divided on whether Kagame would have won the elections had he not used manipulative tactics. Writing about RPF intimidation of opposition candidates in the run-up to elections, Caplan said &quot;what was most infuriating was that none of this was necessary for the RPF to hold on to power&quot;. Belgian academic Filip Reyntjens disagrees, however, stating that &quot;the RPF is fully aware that opening up the political system would eventually lead to a loss of power&quot;.

====Presidential election, 2003====
The first post-genocide election was held in August 2003, following the adoption of the new constitution. In May, the parliament voted to ban the Republican Democratic Movement (MDR), following a parliamentary commission report accusing the MDR of &quot;divisive&quot; ideology. The MDR had been one of the coalition parties in the transitional government of national unity, and was the second-largest party in the country after the RPF. Amnesty International criticised this move, claiming that &quot;the unfounded allegations against the individuals mentioned in the report appear to be part of a government-orchestrated crackdown on the political opposition&quot;. Kagame was the RPF candidate, while former prime minister Twagiramungu was his main challenger. Twagiramungu had intended to run as the candidate for the MDR, but instead sought the presidency as an independent following the party&#x27;s banishment. He returned to the country from Europe in June 2003 and began campaigning in August.

Kagame declared victory in the election one day after the poll, and his win was later confirmed by the National Electoral Commission. The final results showed that Kagame received of the vote, Twagiramungu , and the third candidate, Jean Nepomuscene Nayinzira, ; the voter turnout was . The campaign, election day, and aftermath were largely peaceful, although an observer from the European Union (EU) raised concerns about intimidation of opposition supporters by the RPF. Twagiramungu rejected the result of the election and also questioned the margin of victory, saying &quot;Almost 100 per cent? That&#x27;s not possible&quot;. He filed a petition at the Supreme Court to nullify the result, but was unsuccessful and he left Rwanda shortly afterwards, fearing that he would be arrested. The EU observer also questioned the result, citing &quot;numerous irregularities&quot;, but also describing the poll as a &quot;positive step&quot; in the country&#x27;s history.

====Presidential election, 2010====

Kagame ran for re-election in 2010, at the end of his first elected term. He was endorsed by the RPF national congress as their candidate in May 2010, and was accepted as a candidate in July. His highest-profile opponent was Victoire Ingabire, a Hutu who had been living abroad for some years, and returned to Rwanda in January 2010 to run for the presidency. After a series of criticisms of Kagame&#x27;s policies, she was arrested in April and prohibited from running in the election, as part of what Amnesty International&#x27;s Tawanda Hondora described as &quot;pre-electoral repression&quot;. Kagame began his campaign with a rally at Kigali&#x27;s Amahoro Stadium on 20 July, and held rallies across the country during the subsequent campaign period. The rallies attracted tens of thousands, shouting enthusiastically for Kagame, although reporters for &quot;The New York Times&quot; interviewed a number of Rwandans who said that they were &quot;not free to vote against him and that government officials down to the village level had put enormous pressure on them to register to vote; contribute some of their meager earnings to Mr. Kagame&#x27;s campaign; and attend rallies&quot;.

The election went ahead in August 2010 without Ingabire and two other banned candidates, Kagame facing three opponents described by Human Rights Watch as &quot;broadly supportive of the RPF&quot;. Kagame went on to receive of the vote in the election. Opposition and human rights groups said that the election was tainted by repression, murder, and lack of credible competition. Kagame responded by saying &quot;I see no problems, but there are some people who choose to see problems where there are not.&quot;

====Constitutional referendum, 2015====
As Kagame&#x27;s second term progressed, he began to hint that he might seek to rewrite the term-limit clause of the Rwandan constitution, to allow him to run for a third term in the 2017 elections. Earlier in his presidency he had ruled it out, but in a 2014 speech at Tufts University in the United States, Kagame said that he did not know when he would leave office, and that it was up to the Rwandan people to decide. He told delegates &quot;...let&#x27;s wait and see what happens as we go. Whatever will happen, we&#x27;ll have an explanation.&quot; The following year, a protest occurred outside parliament, and a petition signed by 3.7 million people—more than half of the electorate—was presented to lawmakers asking for Kagame to be allowed to stay in office. The parliament responded by passing an amendment to the constitution in November 2015, with both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate voting unanimously in favour. The motion passed kept the two-term limit in place, and also reduced the length of terms from 7 years to 5 years, but it made an explicit exception for Kagame, who would be permitted to run for a third 7-year term followed by two further 5-year terms, if he so desired. After the amendment was passed in parliament, a referendum was required for it to come into effect.

The referendum took place on 18 December 2015, with Rwandans overseas voting on 17 December. The amendment was approved by the electorate, with 6.16 million voters saying yes, approximately of the votes. The electoral commission stated that the vote had been peaceful and orderly. The Democratic Green Party, the most prominent domestic group opposing the change, protested that it had not been permitted to campaign openly against the amendment. Human Rights Watch executive director Ken Roth announced on Twitter that he did not believe the election to be free and fair, saying there was &quot;no suspense in Rwanda referendum when so many dissidents silenced, civil society stifled&quot;. The amendment itself was criticised by the European Union and also the United States, which released a statement saying that Kagame should respect the previous term limits and &quot;foster a new generation of leaders in Rwanda&quot;. Kagame responded that it was not his own decision to seek a third term, but that the parliament and the people had demanded it.

====Presidential election, 2017====

In accordance with the constitutional change, a presidential election was held in August 2017. The highest-profile opposition figure for the 2017 election was local businesswoman Diane Rwigara. Although she acknowledged that &quot;much has improved under Kagame&quot;, Rwigara was also critical of Kagame&#x27;s government, saying that &quot;people disappear, others get killed in unexplained circumstances and nobody speaks about this because of fear&quot;. Like Ingabire in 2010, Rwigara was barred from running in the election. Kagame was endorsed as the RPF&#x27;s candidate for the election in mid-June, and began his re-election campaign in mid-July with a rally in Ruhango.

After three weeks of campaigning, concluding with a large rally in Gasabo District, the election went ahead between Kagame and two opposition candidates. Kagame was re-elected for a third term with of the vote, his highest percentage to date. He was sworn in for another seven-year term on 18 August. As with his previous victories, independent monitors and human rights organisations cited irregularities and intimidation in the conduct of the election. Cheeseman and Klaas said in their book that he had &quot;not even bothered to try and manipulate the election in the clever ways&quot; he had used in previous campaigns.

===Domestic policy===
====Vision 2020 and Vision 2050====
In the late 1990s, Kagame began actively planning methods to achieve national development. He launched a national consultation process and also sought the advice of experts from emerging nations including China, Singapore and Thailand. Following these consultations, and shortly after assuming the presidency, Kagame launched an ambitious programme of national development called Vision 2020. The major purposes of the programme were to unite the Rwandan people and to transform Rwanda from a highly impoverished into a middle income country. The programme consists of a list of goals which the government aimed to achieve before the year 2020. These include reconstruction, infrastructure and transport improvements, good governance, improving agriculture production, private sector development, and health and education improvements.

In 2011, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MINECOFIN) issued a report indicating the progress of the Vision 2020 goals. The report examined the stated goals of the programme and rated each one with a status of &quot;on-track&quot;, &quot;on-watch&quot; or &quot;off-track&quot;. Of 44 goals, it found that were on-track, were on-watch, and were off-track. The major areas identified as off-track were population, poverty and the environment. By 2012, MINECOFIN&#x27;s review found that 26% of Vision 2020&#x27;s original indicators had already been achieved. While also highlighting key areas for improvement, the review made several upward revisions, including revising the GDP per capita target from $900 to $1,240. In the same year, an independent review of the strategy carried out by academics based in Belgium rated progress as &quot;quite encouraging&quot;, mentioning development in the education and health sectors, as well as Kagame&#x27;s fostering of a favourable business environment. The review also raised concerns about the policy of &quot;maximum growth at any cost&quot;, suggesting that this was leading to a situation in which the rich prospered while the rural poor saw little benefit.

Upon completion of the programme in December 2020, Kagame announced Vision 2050, remarking that &quot;Vision 2020 was about what we had to do in order to survive and regain our dignity. But Vision 2050 has to be about the future we choose, because we can, and because we deserve it.&quot; Vision 2050 focuses around the two main pillars of Economic Growth and Prosperity and High Quality of Life and Standards of Life for Rwandans. Vision 2050 is the programmatic articulation of Kagame&#x27;s ambition for Rwanda to become an upper-middle income country by 2035, and a high-income country by 2050.

====Economy====

Rwanda&#x27;s economy has grown rapidly under Kagame&#x27;s presidency, with per-capita gross domestic product (purchasing power parity) estimated at $2,214 in 2020, compared with $631 in 2000. Annual growth between 2000 and 2020 averaged per year. Kagame&#x27;s economic policy is based on liberalising the economy, reducing red tape for businesses, and transforming the country from an agricultural to a knowledge-based economy. Kagame has stated that he believes Rwanda can emulate the economic development of Singapore since 1960. Kagame, as set out in the national Vision 2050 Policy, believes that Rwanda can become an upper-middle income country by 2035, and a high-income country by 2050.

Kagame&#x27;s economic policy has been praised by many foreign donors and investors, including Bill Clinton and Starbucks chairman Howard Schultz. The country is also recognized internationally for its effective institutions and low levels of corruption.

Rwanda has also illegally exploited Congolese minerals, which is an important aspect of the success of Rwanda&#x27;s economy. Political economy researcher Stefaan Marysse estimated that in 1999, 6.1% of Rwanda&#x27;s GDP came from illegal resource extraction in the DRC. In 2013, foreign aid made up over 20 percent of GDP and nearly half of the budget. Economic growth has disproportionally accrued to elites in the capital while rural areas lag behind. Although the government officially has a policy of privatization, in practice it has increased state control of the economy using corporations with strong ties to the state and the ruling party.

Rwanda is a country of few natural resources, and the economy is heavily dependent on subsistence agriculture, with an estimated of the working population engaged in farming. Under Kagame&#x27;s presidency, the service sector has grown strongly. It makes up approximately half of the country&#x27;s GDP and is the second largest employer after agriculture. Key tertiary contributors include banking and finance, wholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants, transport, storage, communication, insurance, real estate, business services, and public administration, including education and health. Information and communications technology (ICT) is a Vision 2020 priority, with a goal of transforming Rwanda into an ICT hub for Africa. To this end, the government has completed a fibre-optic telecommunications network, intended to provide broadband services and facilitate electronic commerce. Tourism is one of the fastest-growing economic resources and became the country&#x27;s leading foreign exchange earner in 2011.

Rwanda ranks highly in several categories of the World Bank&#x27;s ease of doing business index. In 2005, after the country was ranked 158th on the Ease of Doing Business Index, Kagame set up a special unit to analyze the economy and provide solutions to easing business. As a result, the country topped the list of reformers in 2009. In 2012, the country&#x27;s overall ease of doing business index ranking was 52nd out of 185 countries worldwide, and third out of 46 in Sub-Saharan Africa. It was eighth on the 2012 rankings for ease of starting a business; the Rwanda Development Board asserts that a business can be authorised and registered in 24 hours. The business environment and economy also benefit from relatively low corruption in the country; in 2010, Transparency International ranked Rwanda as the eighth cleanest out of 47 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and sixty-sixth cleanest out of 178 in the world.

====Education and health====

Kagame has made education for youth in Rwanda a high priority for his administration, allocating of the annual budget to the sector. The Rwandan government provides free education in state-run schools for twelve years: six years in primary and six in secondary school. The final three years of free education were introduced in 2012 following a pledge by Kagame during his 2010 re-election campaign. Kagame credits his government with improvements in the tertiary education sector; the number of universities has risen from 1 in 1994 to 29 in 2010, and the tertiary gross enrollment ratio increased from in 2008 to in 2011. From 1994 until 2009, secondary education was offered in either French or English; since 2009, due to the country&#x27;s increasing ties with the East African Community and the Commonwealth of Nations, English has been the sole language of instruction in public schools from primary school grade 4 onward. The country&#x27;s literacy rate, defined as those aged 15 or over who can read and write, was in 2009, up from 58% in 1991 and 38% in 1978.

Rwanda&#x27;s health profile is dominated by communicable diseases, including malaria, pneumonia, and HIV/AIDS. Prevalence and mortality rates have sharply declined in the past decade but the short supply or unavailability of certain medicines continues to challenge disease management. Kagame&#x27;s government is seeking to improve this situation as one of the Vision 2020 priorities. It has increased funding, with the health budget up from of national expenditure in 1996 to in 2008. It also set up training institutes, including the Kigali Health Institute (KHI), and in 2008 effected laws making health insurance mandatory for all individuals; by 2010, over of the population was covered. These policies have contributed to a steady increase in quality of healthcare and improvement in key indicators during Kagame&#x27;s presidency. In 2010, 91 children died before their fifth birthday for every 1000 live births, down from 163 under five deaths for every 1000 live births in 1990. Prevalence of some diseases is declining, including the elimination of maternal and neonatal tetanus and a sharp reduction in malaria morbidity, mortality rate, and specific lethality. In response to shortages in qualified medical personnel, in 2011 the Rwandan government launched an eight-year US$151.8 million initiative to train medical professionals.

Kagame has garnered praise for the country&#x27;s response to the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the country having a relatively underdeveloped health care system, Rwanda has one of the lowest infection and mortality rates in the world, and is seen as a success story. Rwanda is currently the only nation in Africa whose residents are permitted to enter the Schengen Area for non essential travel. Rwanda&#x27;s response has not been without its criticisms, in particular the curbing of civil liberties and individual freedoms. By April 2022. Rwanda was one of the few countries in Africa to have fully vaccinated over 60% of its population against COVID-19.

===Foreign policy===

====Democratic Republic of the Congo====

The Second Congo War, which began in 1998, was still raging when Kagame assumed the presidency in 2000. Namibia, Angola, Zimbabwe, and Chad had committed troops to the Congolese government side, while Rwanda, Uganda, and Burundi were supporting rebel groups. The rebel group Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD) had split in 1999 into two factions: the RCD-Goma, supported by Rwanda, and the RCD-Kisangani, which was allied to Uganda. Uganda also supported the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo (MLC), a rebel group from the north. All these rebel groups were at war with Kabila&#x27;s government in Kinshasa, but they were also increasingly hostile to each other. Various peace meetings had been held, culminating in the July 1999 Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement which was signed by Kabila, Kagame and all the other foreign governments. The rebel groups were not party to the agreement, and fighting continued. The RPA continued to be heavily involved in the Congo War during 2000, fighting battles against the Ugandan army in Kisangani and against Kabila&#x27;s army in Kasai and Katanga.

In January 2001, Kabila was assassinated inside his palace. His son Joseph was appointed president and immediately began asserting his authority by dismissing his father&#x27;s cabinet and senior army commanders, assembling a new government, and engaging with the international community. The new government provided impetus for renewed peace negotiations, and in July 2002 a peace agreement was reached between Rwanda, Congo, and the other major participants, in which all foreign troops would withdraw and RCD-Goma would enter a power-sharing transitional government with Joseph Kabila as interim president until elections could be held. Kagame&#x27;s government announced at the end of 2002 that all uniformed Rwandan troops had left Congolese territory, but this was contradicted by a 2003 report by UN panel of experts. According to this report, the Rwandan army contained a dedicated &quot;Congo desk&quot; which used the armed forces for large-scale illegal appropriation of Congolese resources.

Despite the agreement and subsequent ceasefire, relations between Kagame and the Congolese government remained tense. Kagame blamed the DRC for failing to suppress the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), Rwandan Hutu rebels operating in North and South Kivu provinces. Kabila accused Rwanda of using the Hutu as a &quot;pretext for maintaining its control and influence in the area&quot;. There has been ongoing conflict in Congo&#x27;s eastern provinces since 2004, during which Kagame has backed two major insurgencies. This included a major rebellion from 2005 to 2009, led by Congolese Tutsi Laurent Nkunda, as well as the a rebellion carried out by the March 23 Movement (M23) under leader Bosco Ntaganda, beginning in 2012. A leaked United Nations report in 2012 cited Kagame&#x27;s defence minister James Kabarebe as being effectively the commander of the M23. Relations have improved since 2016, as Kagame held a bilateral meeting with Kabila in Gisenyi. When Félix Tshisekedi was elected DRC president in 2019, Kagame – the AU chairman at the time – unsuccessfully called for an AU investigation into the poll. Despite this, he has developed a close relationship with Tshisekedi since the latter&#x27;s election, with summits in both Kinshasa and Kigali. As of 2020, Kagame still faces accusations that Rwanda&#x27;s troops are active within the Kivu provinces. Congolese officials such as Walikale member of parliament Juvénal Munubo, as well as civilians, have reported sighting RDF soldiers in the DRC, but Kagame consistently denies these claims.

On 20 June 2024, Kagame declared to France 24, &quot;we are ready to fight&quot; against the DRC if necessary, while evading questions about Rwanda&#x27;s military presence in the region. Due to Rwanda&#x27;s support for the Goma offensive by the M23 rebels, the DRC severed diplomatic ties between the two countries on 26 January 2025. Kagame then claimed that South Africa is not in a position to mediate because South African peacekeepers in the region were working with &quot;genocidal armed groups&quot; that threaten Rwanda.

====Uganda and the East African Community====

Kagame spent most of his childhood and young adult years living in Uganda, and has a personal relationship with President Yoweri Museveni dating back to the late 1970s; they fought together in the Ugandan Bush War, and Kagame was appointed head of military intelligence in Museveni&#x27;s national army following the NRA victory in 1986. When the RPF soldiers abandoned the Ugandan army and invaded Rwanda in 1990, Museveni did not explicitly support them, but according to Prunier it is likely that he had prior knowledge of the plan. Museveni also allowed the RPF safe passage through Ugandan territory to the Virunga mountains after their early defeats in the war, and revealed in a 1998 heads of state meeting that Uganda had helped the RPF materially during the Rwandan Civil War. Following the RPF victory, the two countries enjoyed a close political and trade relationship.

Rwanda and Uganda were allies during the First Congo War against Zaire, with both countries being instrumental in the setting up of the AFDL and committing troops to the war. The two nations joined forces again at the beginning of the Second Congo War, but relations soured in late 1998 as Museveni and Kagame had very different priorities in fighting the war. In early 1999, the RCD rebel group split into two, with Rwanda and Uganda supporting opposing factions, and in August the Rwandan and Ugandan armies battled each other with heavy artillery in the Congolese city of Kisangani. The two sides fought again in Kisangani in May and June 2000, causing the deaths of 120 soldiers and around 640 Congolese civilians. Relations slowly thawed in the 2000s, and by 2011 the two countries enjoyed a close friendship once more. Further conflict between Kagame and Museveni arose in early 2019, as the two countries conflicted over trade and regional politics. Kagame accused Museveni&#x27;s government of supporting the FDLR and harassing Rwandan nationals in Uganda, leading Rwanda to set up a blockade of trucks at the border. Museveni accused Rwanda of sending troops into its territory, including an incident in Rukiga district in which a Ugandan citizen was killed. The Rwanda–Uganda border reopened on 31 January 2022.

In 2007, Rwanda joined the East African Community, an intergovernmental organisation for the East Africa region comprising Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Burundi, and Rwanda. The country&#x27;s accession required the signing of various agreements with the other members, including a defence intelligence sharing pact, a customs union, and measures to combat drug trafficking. The countries of the Community established a common market in 2011, and plan further integration, including moves toward political federation. The community has also set up an East African Monetary Institute, which aims to introduce a single currency by 2024.

====France====
France maintained close ties with President Habyarimana during his years in power, as part of its &quot;Françafrique&quot; policy. When the RPF launched the Rwandan Civil War in 1990, Habyarimana was immediately granted assistance from the President of France, François Mitterrand. France sent 600 paratroopers, who effectively ran the government&#x27;s response to the invasion and were instrumental in regaining almost all territory the RPF had gained in the first days of the war. France maintained this military presence throughout the war, engaging Kagame&#x27;s RPF forces again in February 1993 during the offensive that doubled RPF territory. In the later stages of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, France launched &quot;Opération Turquoise&quot;, a United Nations mandated mission to create safe humanitarian areas for protection of displaced persons, refugees, and civilians in danger; many Rwandans interpreted it as a mission to protect Hutu from the RPF, including some who had participated in the genocide. The French remained hostile to the RPF, and their presence temporarily stalled Kagame&#x27;s advance in southwestern Rwanda.

France continued to shun the new RPF government following the end of the genocide and the withdrawal of &quot;Opération Turquoise&quot;. Diplomatic relations were finally reestablished in January 1995, but remained tense as Rwanda accused France of aiding the &quot;genocidaires&quot;, while France defended its interventions. In 2006, French judge Jean-Louis Bruguière released a report on the assassination of President Habyarimana which concluded that Kagame had ordered the shooting of the plane. Bruguière subsequently issued arrest warrants for nine of Kagame&#x27;s close aides. Kagame denied the charges and immediately broke off diplomatic relations with France. Relations began to thaw in 2008, and diplomacy was resumed in late 2009. In 2010, Nicolas Sarkozy became the first French president to visit Rwanda since the genocide, admitting for the first time that France made &quot;grave errors of judgment&quot;. Kagame reciprocated with an official visit to Paris in 2011.

====United States, United Kingdom and the Commonwealth====

Since the end of the Rwandan genocide in 1994, Rwanda has enjoyed a close relationship with the English speaking world, in particular the United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK). The two countries have been highly supportive of the RPF programme of stabilisation and rebuilding, with the UK donating large sums each year in budget support, and the US providing military aid as well as supporting development projects. As president, Kagame has been critical of the West&#x27;s lack of response to the genocide, and the UK and US have responded by admitting guilt over the issue: Bill Clinton, who was President of the United States during the genocide, has described his failure to act against the killings as a &quot;personal failure&quot;. During the 2000s, Clinton and UK prime minister Tony Blair praised the country&#x27;s progress under Kagame, citing it as a model recipient for international development funds, and Clinton referred to Kagame as &quot;one of the greatest leaders of our time&quot;. Both Clinton and Blair have maintained support for the country beyond the end of their terms of office, Clinton via the Clinton Global Initiative and Blair through his role as an unpaid advisor to the Rwandan government.

As part of his policy of maintaining close relations with English speaking countries, Kagame sought membership of the Commonwealth of Nations, which was granted in 2009. Rwanda was only the second country, after Mozambique, to join the Commonwealth having never had colonial links to the British Empire. Kagame attended the subsequent Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth, Australia, addressing the Business Forum. Rwanda also successfully applied for a rotating seat on the United Nations Security Council in 2012, taking over the presidency of that organisation in April 2013.

Kagame&#x27;s relations with the US and UK came under strain in the early 2010s, following allegations that Rwanda is supporting the M23 rebel movement in Eastern Congo. The UK suspended its budgetary aid programme in 2012, freezing a £21 million donation. Other European nations such as Germany also suspended general budgetary support from 2008 onwards. Payments by these countries were gradually restored from 2013, but took the form of sector budgetary support and support for specific programmes. The US also froze some of its military aid programme for Rwanda in 2012, although it stopped short of suspending aid altogether. By 2020, the US remained supportive of Kagame&#x27;s government and was Rwanda&#x27;s largest bilateral donor.

====China and moves towards self-sufficiency====
China has been investing in Rwandan infrastructure since 1971, with early projects including hospitals in Kibungo and Masaka. Under Kagame&#x27;s presidency, trade between the two countries has grown rapidly. The volume of trade increased five-fold between 2005 and 2009, and it doubled again in the following three years, being worth US$160 million in 2012. Projects completed include the renovation of the Kigali road network, funded using a Chinese government loan and undertaken by China Road and Bridge Corporation; the Kigali City Tower, which was built by China Civil Engineering Construction; and a pay television service operated by Star Media.

Kagame has been vocal in his praise of China and its model for relations with Africa, saying in a 2009 interview that &quot;the Chinese bring what Africa needs: investment and money for governments and companies&quot;. This is in contrast to Western countries, whom Kagame accuses of focussing too heavily on giving aid to the continent rather than building a trading relationship; he also believes that they keep African products out of the world marketplace by the use of high tariffs. China does not openly involve itself in the domestic affairs of the countries with which it trades, hence has not followed the West in criticising Kagame&#x27;s alleged involvement in the war in the Congo.

Kagame&#x27;s ultimate goal in international relations is to shift Rwanda from a country dependent on donor aid and loans towards self-sufficiency, trading with other countries on an equal footing. In a 2009 article, Kagame wrote that &quot;the primary purpose of aid should ultimately be to work itself out&quot;, and should therefore focus on self-sufficiency and building private sector development. Kagame cited an example of donor countries providing free fertilisers to farmers; he believes this to be wrong because it undercuts local fertiliser businesses, preventing them from growing and becoming competitive. In 2012, Kagame launched the Agaciro Development Fund, following proposals made at a national dialogue session in 2011. Agaciro is a solidarity fund whose goal is to provide development finance sourced within Rwanda, supplementing aid already received from overseas. The fund invites contributions from Rwandan citizens, within the country and in the diaspora, as well as private companies and &quot;friends of Rwanda&quot;. The fund will allocate its funds based on consultations with the populace, as well as financing projects contributing to the Vision 2020 programme.

== Assassinations ==
Throughout Kagame&#x27;s tenure as vice president and president, he has been linked with murders and disappearances of political opponents, both in Rwanda and abroad. In a 2014 report titled &quot;Repression Across Borders&quot;, Human Rights Watch documents at least 10 cases involving attacks or threats against critics outside Rwanda since the late 1990s, citing their criticism of the Rwandan government, the RPF or Kagame. Examples include the killing of Sendashonga in 1998, the assassination attempts against Nyamwasa in South Africa, as well as the murder of former intelligence chief Patrick Karegeya in South Africa on 31 December 2013. Speaking about Karegeya&#x27;s killing, Kagame spoke of his approval, saying &quot;whoever betrays the country will pay the price, I assure you&quot;. In 2015, a former Rwandan military officer testified before the U.S. Congress that the Rwandan government had offered him $1 million to assassinate Karegeya as well as Kagame critic General Kayumba Nyamwasa. After his testimony, this officer himself faced threats in Belgium as did a Canadian journalist. In December 2017, a South African court found that the Rwandan government continued to plot the assassination of its critics overseas.

==Chairperson of the African Union==
Kagame was Chairperson of the African Union from 28 January 2018 to 10 February 2019. As Chair, Kagame promoted the Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM) and the African Continental Free Trade Area. The proposed Continental Free Trade Area was signed on 21 March 2018 by 44 of the 55 AU nations. By the time he left office in February 2019, the Continental Free Trade had already been ratified by 19 of the 22 nations needed for it to officially go into effect. Kagame also pushed through a reform of African Union structures in an effort to improve their effectiveness and make them financially sustainable.

==Public image and personality==

Views on his leadership vary widely among international scholars and journalists. According to political scientist Alexander Dukalskis, Kagame has been adept in developing a sophisticated positive image of Rwanda abroad. Dukalskis says that to suppress negative information, the Kagame regime has curtailed access to academics and journalists, and threatened and assassinated critics of the regime. Others, such as Philip Gourevitch, author of the 1998 book &quot;We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed with Our Families&quot;, focus on his achievements in ending the genocide after the international community failed to do so, as well as the reconciliation, economic growth, foreign investment, improved public health and education. This is countered by authors such as Judi Rever, who highlight war crimes committed by the RPF before, during, and after the 1994 genocide, the effects of the civil war, assassinations of opponents and the totalitarianism of his regime. In &quot;Rethinking the Rwandan Narrative for the 25th Anniversary&quot;, Gerald Caplan states that a new narrative is required to reconcile these conflicting viewpoints, incorporating aspects from both points of view and &quot;striking the proper balance between the old and the newly revised&quot;.

In Rwanda, Kagame&#x27;s RPF is seen as a Tutsi-dominated party, and in the years following the 1994 genocide, it was deeply unpopular with the Hutu, who constitute of the population. Approximately two million Hutu lived as refugees in neighbouring countries until 1996, when Kagame forced them to return home. Many Hutu also supported the late 1990s cross-border insurgency against Kagame by defeated forces of the former regime. By 1999, the RPF had weakened the insurgents and Tutsi and Hutu began living together peacefully in the northwest. Kayumba Nyamwasa, at the time still part of the Rwandan army, said that &quot;the mood had changed&quot;, attributing a shift in Hutu attitude to a shift in the &quot;balance of forces in the country&quot;, with the genocidaires having &quot;no chance of returning to power&quot;. As of 2021, with a lack of free speech in Rwanda, and elections which are generally regarded as lacking freedom and fairness, Kagame&#x27;s popularity among the Rwandan population is unknown. Journalists Jason Burke of &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;Al Jazeera&quot;&#x27;s Rashid Abdallah describe the president as &quot;authentically popular in Rwanda&quot; and as enjoying &quot;overwhelming public support&quot; respectively. British journalist and author Michela Wrong and Filip Reyntjens disagree, with Wrong saying that &quot;the level of invective Kagame dedicates to the Rwanda National Congress, the amount of energy he has expended trying to get Uganda and South Africa to expel or extradite or close down these players, suggests he sees them as a real threat&quot;.

Kagame&#x27;s image among foreign leaders was very positive until the late 2000s. He was credited with ending the genocide, bringing peace and security to Rwanda, and achieving development. Since 2010, the international community has increasingly criticized Kagame following a leaked United Nations report alleging Rwanda&#x27;s support for the rebel M23 movement in Congo. In 2012, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and several other countries suspended programmes of budget support to Rwanda, with many redirecting their aid to project-based assistance.
Describing Kagame&#x27;s personality, Roméo Dallaire has written that he has a &quot;studious air that didn&#x27;t quite disguise his hawk-like intensity&quot;. American journalist Stephen Kinzer, who wrote the biography &quot;A Thousand Hills: Rwanda&#x27;s Rebirth and the Man Who Dreamed It&quot; in collaboration with Kagame himself, describes him as &quot;one of the most intriguing leaders in Africa&quot;. Despite praising Kagame&#x27;s leadership skills, Kinzer also cites a personality of &quot;chronic impatience, barely suppressed anger, and impulsive scorn for critics&quot;. In an interview with the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;&#x27;s Richard Grant, Kagame said that he sleeps for only four hours per night, devoting the remainder of his day to work, exercise, family, and reading academic texts and foreign newspapers. When asked about his reputation for physically beating his subordinates by journalist Jeffrey Gettleman, Kagame said, &quot;I can be very tough, I can make mistakes like that&quot;.

Kagame has received many honours and accolades during his presidency. These include honorary degrees and medals from several Western universities, as well as the highest awards bestowed by the countries of Liberia and Benin. The Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations football tournament has been named the Kagame Interclub Cup since 2002, due to Kagame&#x27;s sponsorship of the event.

==Personal life==

Kagame married Jeannette Nyiramongi, a Tutsi exile living in Nairobi, Kenya, in Uganda on 10 June 1989. Kagame had asked his relatives to suggest a suitable marriage and they recommended Nyiramongi. Kagame travelled to Nairobi and introduced himself, persuading her to visit him in Uganda. Nyiramongi was familiar with the RPF and its goal of returning refugees to Rwanda. She held Kagame in high regard. The couple have four children.

His daughter, Ange Kagame Ndengeyingoma, completed her education abroad and was absent from the public eye for most of her childhood due to security and privacy reasons. She attended Dana Hall School, a private preparatory school located in Wellesley, Massachusetts in the United States. She attended Smith College where she majored in political science with a minor in African studies. She also holds a master&#x27;s degree in international affairs from Columbia University.

Kagame can speak three languages, English, Kinyarwanda, and French, and is a supporter of Arsenal F.C. He is Catholic and teetotal.

<text>The Harlon Hill Trophy is an award in American college football given to the individual selected as the most valuable player in NCAA Division II. The award is named for former University of North Alabama and National Football League player Harlon Hill. It was first given in 1986 to Jeff Bentrim of North Dakota State University. It is often considered to be the Division II equivalent of the Heisman Trophy.

==Selection process==
Nominations for the trophy are made by sports information directors (SIDs) from the 156 schools that participate in NCAA Division II football. All of the nominees are then presented to a four-member regional Advisory Committee, one for each competition region (Northeast, South, Midwest, and West). Each committee is composed of four SIDs familiar with the process, who select up to six players who they deem worthy of the award, and give their results to the Voting Coordinator.

The 24 players selected in the regional committees are referred to as &quot;Candidates&quot;. The regional candidates are then presented to the regions&#x27; SIDs, who vote for a first, second, and third place. Each first place vote earns the player three points, while second place votes earn two, and third place votes one point. The top two players selected in each region are the &quot;Finalists&quot; and are placed on a national ballot.

The national ballot is open to all of the SIDs, who vote for first, second, and third place amongst the eight finalists. The top three finishers are invited to the awards presentation held during the Division II Championship weekend on the North Alabama campus in Florence, Alabama. Even though the D-II title game moved to Kansas City, Kansas in 2016, the award ceremony continues to be held in Florence.

==Trophy==
The Harlon Hill Trophy is and weighs . The football on top is a life-size replica of an actual game football and sits on a solid walnut base. The approximate value of the trophy is $2,300. It was created by Herff Jones of Indianapolis, Indiana, which also makes such notable awards as the Heisman Trophy and the Medal of Honor. Each year&#x27;s winner of the Hill Trophy is awarded a trophy to keep. The original Hill Trophy remains on display in something or somewhere called &#x27;the Shoals&#x27; year-round and bears the names of each year&#x27;s recipient. The award was first presented in 1986.

Replicas of the Harlon Hill Trophy are on display at:
* The College Football Hall of Fame in Atlanta, Georgia.
* The Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in Birmingham, Alabama.

==History==
The trophy is named after Harlon Hill, who played at Florence State Teachers College (now the University of North Alabama) from 1950 to 1953, where he was named an NAIA All-American in his senior year. Hill was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the 15th round of the 1954 NFL draft. He played for the Chicago Bears (1954–61), Pittsburgh Steelers (1962), and Detroit Lions (1962). Hill was the NFL&#x27;s Rookie of the Year in 1954 and its most valuable player in 1955, both voted by the Newspaper Enterprise Association. He was a three-time All-Pro selection between 1954 and 1956.

Through 2009, only three winners have been selected in the NFL Draft. Three-time winner Johnny Bailey was selected by the Chicago Bears in the ninth round of the 1990 draft. Bailey played six seasons in the NFL and was selected to the 1993 Pro Bowl. Ronald Moore was taken by the Phoenix Cardinals in the fourth round in 1993 and played six seasons. Bernard Scott was selected by the Cincinnati Bengals in the sixth round in 2009 and debuted during his rookie season in 2010.

Others were signed in the NFL as undrafted free agents. Two-time winner Danny Woodhead made his NFL debut with New York Jets in 2009. Ronald McKinnon signed with the Arizona Cardinals, where he played from 1996 to 2004. He played an additional season for the New Orleans Saints for a total of ten seasons in the league, recording over 1,000 tackles.

As of 2009, three winners—Johnny Bailey, Jeff Bentrim, and Ronald McKinnon—have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.

Five players have won the award multiple times: Johnny Bailey in 1987, 1988, and 1989, Dusty Bonner in 2000 and 2001, Danny Woodhead in 2006 and 2007, Jason Vander Laan in 2014 and 2015, and Zach Zebrowski in 2023 and 2024. All but one winner (Ronald McKinnon, 1995) have been offensive positions.

==Winners==
== Trophies won by school ==
This is a list of the colleges and universities who have had a player win a Hill trophy: Central Missouri, Colorado Mines, Texas A&amp;M–Kingsville, Valdosta State, and Ferris State are tied for the most trophies at 3 each. Eight schools have had two different players claim the award—Bloomsburg, Central Missouri, Ferris State, North Alabama, North Dakota State, Pittsburg State, and Valdosta State. Texas A&amp;M–Kingsville boasts the only three-time winner, Johnny Bailey. Mines is the only program to have three different winners. In total, players from 20 different schools have won a Harlon Hill, while ten schools have more than one trophy.

<doc id="393595" wikidata="Q1878971" url="?curid=393595" title="Andy White (singer-songwriter)">
<text>Andy White (born 28 May 1962) is a Northern Irish singer-songwriter, poet and author, born in Belfast. He started writing poetry and music early, penning a poem called &quot;Riots&quot; aged nine. He attended Methodist College Belfast. He studied English Literature at Robinson College, Cambridge, graduating in 1984.

He released his first EP &quot;Religious Persuasion&quot; in 1985 on Stiff Records, and debut album &quot;Rave on Andy White&quot; in 1986. Since then he has released thirteen solo albums plus numerous compilations and live albums, and has collaborated with many other artists including Peter Gabriel, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor and English producer John Leckie. White won Ireland&#x27;s &quot;Hot Press&quot; Songwriter of the Year Award in 1993.

In 1995, he released an album (&quot;Altitude&quot;) with Tim Finn (of Split Enz) and Liam Ó Maonlaí (of Hothouse Flowers); the trio recorded as ALT.

His most recent solo studio album is &quot;This garden is only temporary&quot; (2022). In 2023, White and Tim Finn collaborated on the album &quot;AT&quot;.

A book of lyrics and poems, &quot;The Music Of What Happens&quot;, was published in 1999 by Belfast-based Lagan Press. In 2009, his first work of prose (&quot;21st Century Troubadour&quot;) was published, also by Lagan, with a second volume of poetry (&quot;Stolen Moments&quot;) (Another Lost Shark Press, Brisbane) following in 2011. A double CD collection &quot;21st Century Troubadour&quot; (2012), was based around the book of the same name.

After his first two albums with Decca/MCA, a long relationship with roots label Cooking Vinyl, and a live performance album for Real World Records/WOMAD, White currently records for ALT Recordings licensed through UK label Floating World.

White tours often. He has performed live at Glastonbury Festival and many international rock festivals including WOMAD UK (where he hosted the gala finale in 2005), performing at and MCing the main stage at the Fleadh in London, WOMAD festivals in South Africa, USA, Italy, Cacares, Madrid, Singapore and Womadelaide, international folk festivals including Cambridge (UK); Calgary, Winnipeg, Vancouver (Canada); Port Fairy and Woodford (Australia).

White is best known for songs such as &quot;Religious Persuasion&quot;, &quot;James Joyce&#x27;s Grave&quot;, &quot;Street Scenes From My Heart&quot;, &quot;Italian Girls on Mopeds&quot;, and noted for the political and literary content of his work.

In 2011, as a result of a continued friendship with the Canada-based songwriter Stephen Fearing, the two recorded a collaborative album, &quot;Fearing &amp; White&quot;, part of a collection of songs written at infrequent intervals over the course of a decade. The duo released their second album &quot;Tea And Confidences&quot; in March 2014.

On the 30th anniversary of &quot;Rave on Andy White&quot;, a career retrospective &quot;Studio Albums 1986–2016&quot; was released on Floating World Records, comprising all twelve studio albums in that period. Three subsequent albums have seen White expand his recording practice, with album content reflecting that of his early work. 

Since touring was curtailed in 2020, White has maintained a strong online presence and in 2022 started the podcast &quot;This podcast is only temporary&quot;. 

White lives in Melbourne with his son, Sebastian, where he teaches at Melbourne Polytechnic.

<doc id="393596" wikidata="Q317378" url="?curid=393596" title="Malietoa Tanumafili II">
<text>Malietoa Tanumafili II (4 January 1913 – 11 May 2007) was a Samoan paramount chief who was O le Ao o le Malo (head of state) of Samoa from its independence in 1962, and the holder of the Malietoa maximal lineage title from 1940, until his death in 2007.

After becoming the Malietoa, he worked as a civil servant and parliamentarian. When the state of Western Samoa was founded in 1962, gaining independence from New Zealand, he became joint head of state with Tupua Tamasese Meaʻole, who died on 15 April 1963, after which he remained the office&#x27;s sole occupant until his own death.

== Early life ==
Tanumafili was born on 4 January 1913 as the son and third child of his parents, Malietoa Tanumafili I and Momoe Lupeuluiva Meleisea.

He inherited the royal title of Malietoa in 1940, following the 1939 death of his father, Malietoa Tanumafili I, though some media reports claim that he received the title of Malietoa in 1939. The Malietoa is one of the four &quot;tamaʻāiga&quot; (maximal lineage) titles, alongside the Tupua Tamasese, Mataʻafa and Tuimalealiʻifano.

He was educated at the government-run Leififi School in Samoa. He went on to enroll at St. Stephen&#x27;s School and Wesley College in Pukekohe, both of which are in New Zealand.

== Public career ==
Soon after becoming Malietoa, he was appointed a special adviser (&quot;Fautua&quot;) to the New Zealand administration over Samoa. During his earlier career, he worked for several years alongside Tupua Tamasese Meaʻole, serving in multiple conventions related to constitutional reform as part of the transition to independence. Both were also members of the Legislative Assembly before their resignation in 1957. In 1959, Malietoa was appointed joint chairman of a committee advising New Zealand lawyers on drafting the Samoan constitution.

Upon Samoa&#x27;s independence in 1962, Malietoa and Tupua Tamasese became O Ao o le Malo (heads of state), jointly appointed under the constitution for a lifetime term. When Tupua Tamasese died sixteen months later in April 1963, Malietoa became the sole head of state.

Malietoa travelled extensively during his tenure as O le Ao o le Malo. He travelled to the People&#x27;s Republic of China for an official state visit in September 1976. Additionally, he visited Australia, Fiji, Tonga, Nauru, Hawaii, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and West Germany. He was among the foreign dignitaries who attended the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and the funeral of Japanese Emperor Shōwa in 1989.

In 1999, amid the fallout from the murder of a reformist politician and cabinet minister, Luagalau Levaula Kamu, Malietoa commuted the death sentences which were handed out to the two perpetrators to life imprisonment, and reportedly also visited them in prison. On 9 August 2004, he bestowed the chiefly Seiuli title upon professional wrestler and actor Dwayne Johnson, when the latter visited Samoa with his mother Ata Maivia.

== Death ==

Malietoa died at the age of 94 on 11 May 2007 after being treated for pneumonia, and was buried on 18 May. His death triggered the first election for an O le Ao o le Malo in Samoa&#x27;s post-independence history as required by the constitution.

== Honours and legacy ==
Malietoa was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1959. In 1977, Elizabeth II visited Samoa for a single day as part of her tour of the South Pacific on board the Royal Yacht &quot;Britannia&quot;. While in Samoa, she presented Malietoa with the Collar Badge and Star of a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George. He is often credited for providing much of the stability that Samoa has enjoyed post independence.

== Personal life ==
Malietoa was an active athlete during his younger years. His favourite sports included boxing, rugby and cricket. Malietoa&#x27;s interest in sports continued throughout his life and he was an avid golfer well into his nineties. He could often be seen driving his golf cart around Samoa.

In 1973, Malietoa became a follower of the Baháʼí Faith. He was the first serving head of state to be a member of the religion. In 1976, he visited the graveside of Shoghi Effendi, first and last Guardian of the Baháʼí Administrative Order, in London. In 1979 he laid the foundational cornerstone of the Baháʼí House of Worship in Tiapapata, eight kilometres from the capital of Apia. The temple was subsequently dedicated by him at completion in 1984.

His wife, Lili Tunu, whom he married in 1940, died in 1986. He had eleven children including Papaliʻi Laupepa, Papaliʻi Faʻamausili Molī (later Malietoa Moli II) and Papaliʻi Momoe Von Reiche, of which two sons and two daughters survived him when he died.

<text>The New Army, often referred to as Kitchener&#x27;s Army or, disparagingly, as Kitchener&#x27;s Mob,
was an (initially) all-volunteer portion of the British Army formed in the United Kingdom from 1914 onwards following the outbreak of hostilities in the First World War in late July 1914. It originated on the recommendation of Herbert Kitchener, then the Secretary of State for War to obtain 500,000 volunteers for the Army. Kitchener&#x27;s original intention was that these men would be formed into units that would be ready to be put into action in mid-1916, but circumstances dictated the use of these troops before then. The first use in a major action of Kitchener&#x27;s Army units came at the Battle of Loos (September–October 1915).

==Origins==

Contrary to the popular belief that the war would be over by Christmas 1914, Kitchener predicted a long and brutal war. He believed that arrival in Europe of an overwhelming force of new, well-trained and well-led divisions would prove a decisive blow against the Central Powers. Kitchener fought off opposition to his plan, and attempts to weaken or water down its potential, including piece-meal dispersal of the New Army battalions into existing regular or Territorial Force divisions (the view of the Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), Field Marshal French). Kitchener declined to use the existing Territorial Force (set up by Lord Haldane and Douglas Haig as part of the Army reforms of the Edwardian period) as the basis for the New Army, as many of its members had volunteered for &quot;Home Service&quot; only, and because he was suspicious of the poor performance of French &quot;territorials&quot; in the Franco-Prussian War 1870–1871. In the early days of the war, the Territorial Force could not reinforce the regular army, as it lacked modern equipment, particularly artillery. In addition, it took time to form first-line units composed only of men who had volunteered for &quot;General Service&quot;.

Those recruited into the New Army were used to form complete battalions under existing British Army regiments. These new battalions had titles of the form &quot;xxth (Service) Battalion, &lt;regiment name&gt;&quot;. The first New Army divisions were first used in August 1915 at Suvla Bay during the Gallipoli Campaign and also the Battle of Loos on the Western Front in the autumn of 1915; they were sorely tested in the Battle of the Somme. The initial BEF—a single army of five regular divisions in August 1914, grew to two field armies comprising 16 divisions by the end of 1914 when the Territorials had been deployed, and to five armies totalling around 60 divisions in strength by the summer of 1916; approximately 2 million men, of whom around half were infantry (the rest were gun crews, supply and logistics men etc.)

== Recruitment ==

All five of the full army groups (meaning a group of divisions similar in size to an army, not a group of armies) were made up of volunteer recruits, which included the famous Pals&#x27; Battalions. Due to the huge numbers of men wishing to sign up, in places queues up to a mile long formed outside recruitment offices, there were many problems in equipping and providing shelter for the new recruits. Rapidly the Government added many new recruitment centres, which eased the admissions burden, and began a programme of temporary construction at the main training camps. By 12 September, almost half a million men had enlisted. The priority placement of recruits was to make up the strength of K1 units, then the Reserve battalions, and then the K2 units. Almost 2.5 million men volunteered for Kitchener&#x27;s Army. The War Office stipulated that NCOs for these new formations should be selected from those men reenlisting.

By the beginning of 1916, enthusiasm for volunteering had waned. Great Britain resorted to conscription under the Military Service Act 1916, like the other great powers involved in the war. (Conscription was also applied &quot;in reverse&quot;, so that skilled workers and craftsmen who had volunteered early in the war could be drafted back into the munitions industry, where they were sorely needed.)

The first conscripts arrived in France in late 1916 to fill the gaps in the volunteer units, which had been greatly diminished during the Battle of the Somme. After the bloody battles of 1916 and 1917, many of the British Army facing the Ludendorff Offensive of 1918 were conscripts, many of whom were youths under 21 years of age, or in their late thirties or older. Many of the other soldiers were men of lower levels of fitness who had volunteered earlier in the war and had since been &quot;combed out&quot; of rear echelon jobs. Roughly half of those who served in the British Army throughout the war, including more than half of the five million men serving in the British Army in 1918, were conscripts.

== Training ==

The British Army traditionally recruited on a regimental basis, therefore a recruit accepted into the Army was first sent to his new regiment&#x27;s depot, where he received his kit and was introduced to army discipline and training. Next he was sent to the main training camps to join his battalion. In practice, no regiment had the required stocks of equipment, or the manpower to train the flood of recruits; men trained wearing their own clothes and shoes. To mitigate this problem, the army issued old stored uniforms, including First Boer War–vintage red jackets. Some regiments bought their own uniform and boots with money paid from public collections. Many regiments were also issued with emergency blue uniforms, popularly known as &quot;Kitchener Blue&quot;. Whilst this crisis went on, the soldiers wore regimental and unit badges or patches on their clothing. Many photographs from the era show uniformed soldiers drilling alongside civilian clothed soldiers, perhaps led by red-jacketed NCOs.

The Regiments also suffered from a lack of officers to train them. The government called up all reserve-list officers and any British Indian Army officer who happened to be on leave in the UK during the period. Men who had been to a recognised public school and university graduates, many of whom had some prior military training in Officer Training Corps, were often granted direct commissions. Commanding officers were encouraged to promote promising leaders and later in the war it was common for officers (&quot;temporary gentlemen&quot;) to have been promoted from the ranks to meet the demand, especially as casualty rates among junior infantry officers were extremely high. Many officers, both regular and temporary, were promoted to ranks and responsibilities far greater than they had ever realistically expected to hold.

The Army had difficulty supplying new units with enough weapons. No artillery pieces had been left in Britain to train new artillery brigades, and most battalions had to drill with obsolete rifles or wooden mockups. By early 1915 the Government had overcome many of these problems. Among its methods was pressing into use old ceremonial cannons and unfinished modern artillery pieces which lacked targeting sights. During 1915, it corrected such shortages.

==Later developments==
At the beginning of 1918, the shortage of manpower in the British Expeditionary Force in France became acute. The Army ordered infantry divisions to be reduced from twelve infantry battalions to nine. The higher-numbered battalions (in effect the New Army units, and some Second-Line Territorial units) were to be disbanded rather than the lower-numbered Regular and First-Line Territorial battalions. (Since Kitchener&#x27;s death in 1916, no other major figure opposed this fundamental change to the principles on which the New Army had been raised.) In some cases, New Army divisions had to disband about half of their units to make room for surplus battalions transferred from Regular or First-Line Territorial divisions. While the change reduced the unique sense of identity of some New Army formations, it developed the divisions in France into more homogeneous units. By this time there was no longer much real distinction between Regular, Territorial, and New Army divisions.

==Structure==
Kitchener&#x27;s New Army was made up of the following Army Groups (meaning a group of divisions similar in size to an army, not a group of armies) and Divisions:

===K1 Army Group===
* 9th (Scottish) Division
* 10th (Irish) Division
* 11th (Northern) Division
* 12th (Eastern) Division
* 13th (Western) Division
* 14th (Light) Division—originally &quot;8th (Light) Division&quot; but renumbered when the regular army 8th Division was formed in September 1914.

===K2 Army Group===
* 15th (Scottish) Division
* 16th (Irish) Division
* 17th (Northern) Division
* 18th (Eastern) Division
* 19th (Western) Division
* 20th (Light) Division

===K3 Army Group===
* 21st Division
* 22nd Division
* 23rd Division
* 24th Division
* 25th Division
* 26th Division

===Original K4 Army Group===
Kitchener&#x27;s Fourth New Army was formed from November 1914 with
* 30th Division
* 31st Division
* 32nd Division
* 33rd Division
* 34th Division
* 35th Division
The divisions were not fully formed when the decision was made to use them to provide replacements for the first three New Armies. The divisions were broken up on 10 April 1915; the infantry brigades and battalions became reserve formations and the other divisional troops were transferred to the divisions of the newly created Fourth and Fifth New Armies.

===K4/K5 Army Group===
Redesignated K4 following breakup of original K4.
* 30th Division—originally designated as &quot;37th Division&quot;
* 31st Division—originally designated as &quot;38th Division&quot;
* 32nd Division—originally designated as &quot;39th Division&quot;
* 33rd Division—originally designated as &quot;40th Division&quot;
* 34th Division—originally designated as &quot;41st Division&quot;
* 35th Division—originally designated as &quot;42nd Division&quot;

===K5 Army Group===
Following the re-designation of the previous K5 Army Group, a new K5 Army Group was formed.
* 36th (Ulster) Division—raised as the &quot;Ulster Division&quot;, numbered on 28 August 1914.
* 37th Division—originally designated as &quot;44th Division&quot;
* 38th (Welsh) Division—originally designated as &quot;43rd Division&quot;
* 39th Division
* 40th Division
* 41st Division

<text>Fradique Bandeira Melo de Menezes (born 21 March 1942) is a São Toméan politician who was the third president of São Tomé and Príncipe from 2001 to 2003 and again from 2003 to 2011.

==Early life==
Menezes was born on the then Portuguese colony of São Tomé in 1942, the son of a Portuguese man and a local woman. He attended high school in Portugal. He then studied at the Instituto Superior de Psicologia Aplicada in Lisbon, Portugal and Free University of Brussels.

==Career==
Menezes is a businessman. He was Foreign Minister of São Tome and Príncipe from 1986 until 1987. He was elected President in July 2001 with about 55.2% of the vote, defeating Manuel Pinto da Costa, who received about 40%. Menezes took office on September 3, 2001. His eligibility as a candidate was questioned, since he also held Portuguese citizenship, but he renounced this and his candidacy was approved. On July 16, 2003, while he was away in Nigeria, there was a military &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot; led by Fernando Pereira, but Menezes was restored to power on July 23, 2003, following an agreement.

Menezes was re-elected on July 30, 2006, winning 60.58% of the vote and defeating Patrice Trovoada, son of former president Miguel Trovoada.

The discovery of a coup plot allegedly involving Christian Democratic Front leader Arlecio Costa was announced on February 12, 2009. Costa and more than 30 others were arrested. At a press conference on February 24, Menezes said that he was &quot;touched&quot; by the support of the security forces; he also said that he would be willing to leave office if he was &quot;the reason that things are not working in this country&quot;.

Menezes received the World Peace Culture Award on July 13, 2002.

<text>The Barmy Army is a group of British cricket fans known for supporting the English cricket team in both domestic and international matches. 

The Barmy Army was at first an informal group but was later turned into a company limited by guarantee, registered in England and Wales. The name is also applied to followers of the team who join in with match day activities in the crowd, but do not necessarily travel as part of an organised tour. Collins dictionary defines the word barmy as &quot;slightly crazy or very foolish&quot;. They are known for their song that goes &quot;Barmy Army shout it out come on England&quot;. 

The group, then less organised, was given its name by the Australian media during the 1994–95 Test series in Australia, reportedly for the fans&#x27; hopeless audacity in travelling all the way to Australia in the near-certain knowledge that their team would lose, and the fact that they kept on chanting encouragement to the England team even when England were losing quite badly. It was co-founded by Paul Burnham.

==History==
On the first day of the 1994–95 Ashes Series at Adelaide Oval, a group of supporters of the English Cricket team during the lunch break headed to &#x27;T-Shirt City&#x27; on Hindley Street and ordered 50 shirts saying &quot;Atherton&#x27;s Barmy Army&quot; (after then-captain Michael Atherton) with the Union Jack emblazoned on the back. By the end of the Test over 200 shirts had been purchased, and by the end of the tour, 3,000 had been purchased. This Test is often cited as the catalyst for the formal establishment of the Barmy Army.

The Barmy Army, which is now a limited company, states that it wants to &quot;make watching cricket more fun and much more popular&quot;. The group uses flags, banners, songs and chants to encourage the team and crowd participation in their activities. In contrast to the reputations of some sports fans for hooliganism, the Barmy Army organisers actively discourage and avoid such behaviour.

The group engages in charity work and has gained a good reputation among most cricket administrators. However, many cricket followers find their constant chanting to be annoying and disruptive, particularly during the afternoon sessions of Test matches when the chanting of the Barmy Army, fuelled by their consumption of large amounts of alcohol, often becomes a repetitive, irritating background noise; among others, the renowned cricket writer/commentator Christopher Martin-Jenkins accused them of &quot;demeaning English cricket&quot;.

Throughout the 1990s, increased spending power, via a stronger British Pound at the time, enabled fans to take their &quot;Atherton&#x27;s Barmy Army&quot; song overseas when following tours of the English national cricket team. Because of that particular song, and the fact that it seemed to represent English fans&#x27; activity of standing in the hot sun, drinking lager all day until they were sunburnt and unwell, it became a description as well as a song. David Lloyd and Ian Botham used the tag to describe the supporters whilst commentating for Sky Sports during England&#x27;s tours from 1993 to 1995.

In the late 1990s, performers Richard Stilgoe and Peter Skellern recognised the need for an anthem for the loyal supporters of a team that regularly seemed to lose and wrote a stirring song called &quot;The Barmy Army&quot;, which they included in their touring repertoire. It can be found on their 1999 CD &quot;A Quiet Night Out&quot;, and humorously celebrates the English team&#x27;s skill at &quot;snatching defeat from the jaws of victory&quot;.
Most grounds except Lord&#x27;s reserve areas of seating for Barmy Army fans.

During the 2019–20 English tour of South Africa, Sky Sports filmed a feature story entitled &quot;25 Years of the Barmy Army&quot; to commemorate the group&#x27;s 25-year anniversary. Hosted by Atherton, it covers the group&#x27;s origins and characteristics, favourite countries to tour and favorite moments and features interviews with Nasser Hussain, Joe Root, and several members.

== In other sports ==
Supporters of English national teams in other sports are also subsidiaries of the Barmy Army. The rugby equivalent was formed in 2014, they also form part of the Army to support British and Irish Lions, while there is another separate subsidiary for Rugby League.
The term Barmy Army has also been used to describe the Devonshire football team Plymouth Argyle F.C., usually with a prefix of ‘Green and White’ during stadium-wide chants, although there is no association to the above groups.

One Barmy Army member, Neil Rowe, gained media attention for dressing up as England football manager Gareth Southgate both on England cricket tours and at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.

== Music ==
For the 1999 ICC Cricket World Cup, the Barmy Army recorded &quot;Come on England&quot;, released by Wildstar Records and set to the tune of &quot;Soul Limbo&quot;, the original &quot;Test Match Special&quot; theme by Booker T. &amp; the M.G&#x27;s. The music video included appearances from Ian Botham, Ronnie Irani, Dickie Bird and Chris Tarrant.

<doc id="393612" wikidata="Q546340" url="?curid=393612" title="Thunderbird (John Proudstar)">
<text>Thunderbird (John Proudstar) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Len Wein and artist Dave Cockrum, the character first appears in &quot;Giant-Size X-Men&quot; #1 (May 1975). Thunderbird was a short-lived member of the Second Genesis group of X-Men gathered together in this issue, as he died on their second mission, where they tried to chase down Count Nefaria. His death is also depicted in &quot;X-Men: Grand Design – Second Genesis&quot; #1, where his death is witnessed by Banshee, and felt deeply by the X-Men and Charles Xavier.

An Apache Native American and Human Mutant, John Proudstar possesses superhuman athletic ability. Since his death, Thunderbird was temporarily brought back to life during the Necrosha and Chaos War storylines, before being permanently resurrected after the establishment of Krakoa. His brother James Proudstar, known first as Thunderbird, and then as Warpath, is also a mutant and X-Men with similar capabilities.

In addition to his mainstream incarnations, Thunderbird has been depicted in other fictional universes. The most notable alternative version of the character is a member of the original Exiles team. In other media, Thunderbird is one of the main characters in the live-action television series &quot;The Gifted&quot;, portrayed by Blair Redford.

==Publication history==
Writer Len Wein and artist Dave Cockrum created Thunderbird for the new X-Men, specifically to be a member of the team who would fail the entrance exam. Having already decided that the previously introduced characters Sunfire and Banshee would fail the exam, Wein and Cockrum felt it would be unrealistic for only older characters to &quot;flunk out&quot;, and set about creating a new character to fit this role. After developing Thunderbird, however, they decided that they liked the character — his costume in particular — too much to write him off after only one issue, and decided to keep him on.

The character debuted in &quot;Giant-Size X-Men&quot; #1 (May 1975). While working on the first issues of the regular series, the creative team realized that having Thunderbird as a regular character was problematic. According to Cockrum, &quot;...we created him as an obnoxious loudmouth, and we already had an obnoxious loudmouth in Wolverine. So one of us decided to kill him off after all, just for shock value.&quot; Chris Claremont, who scripted the story, confirms that it was Wein who decided to kill the character, and added, &quot;He figured there are two ways to do this. One, you spend years, if not decades, building up a relationship between the audience and a character, building the emotional bonds between them so when something happens to that character the audience is devastated. Or you do it right off the bat, when no one is expecting it.&quot; The story culminating in Thunderbird&#x27;s death appeared in &quot;X-Men&quot; #94-95.

In 2000, for the 25th anniversary of the introduction of Thunderbird, writer Scott Lobdell and artist Aaron Lopresti did a two-issue series about the character, with a cover by Art Adams. Marvel Comics never published the series. At the same period, after nine years of absence, Chris Claremont returned to the X-Men to take over the titles. According to Brian Cronin from Comic Book Resources, there were likely two events that lead to the cancellation of this mini-series. Firstly, Claremont introduced a new X-Man character Neal Shaara with the codename Thunderbird. Secondly, Claremont had his own project for the 25th anniversary: &quot;X-Men: Black Sun&quot;, which had a spotlight comic on the various members of the All-New, All-Different X-Men, including one on Thunderbird with his partner Wolverine. In 2010, the character appeared in the front of a teaser featuring X-Men characters believed to be dead titled &quot;All New, All Different&quot;. Thunderbird was one of the feature characters in the 2011 two-issue limited series &quot;Chaos War: X-Men&quot;.

John Proudstar was finally resurrected in the main comics continuity in &quot;X-Men: The Trial of Magneto&quot; #5 (2021), over 45 years after his initial death in X-Men #95. He starred in a solo one-shot &quot;Giant-Size X-Men: Thunderbird&quot; #1 (2022), where he received a new costume.

Thunderbird will be getting a solo X-Men project.

==Fictional character biography==
John Proudstar was born into an Apache tribe on a reservation in Camp Verde, Arizona. As a teenager, he discovered he possessed the mutant abilities of superhuman senses, strength, speed, stamina, and sturdiness.

While he was a teenager, John&#x27;s mother Maria fell sick as Edwin Martynec lied to her that she had cancer. He also targeted John&#x27;s brother James only for John and his reporter friend to thwart him.

Proudstar was drafted into the United States Marine Corps during the Vietnam War and earned the rank of corporal. He returned to his tribe after the war, but he was unhappy and listless.

He was then recruited by Professor Charles Xavier to join his third group of X-Men. Eager to prove his prowess, Proudstar agreed and assumed the superhero codename Thunderbird. He assisted the other X-Men in rescuing the original X-Men from Krakoa the mutant island.

During the weeks of training that followed, the ill-tempered and individualistic Thunderbird often found himself going head to head with the X-Men&#x27;s leader Cyclops. The new team&#x27;s second mission took them to Valhalla Base, Colorado, to combat Count Nefaria and the Ani-Men. When Nefaria attempted to make his escape in a jet plane, Proudstar leapt on board. Disregarding Professor X&#x27;s orders to jump to safety, Thunderbird hammered at it with his bare fists. The plane exploded, killing Proudstar. Count Nefaria is later revealed to have survived the crash.

James Proudstar has similar powers, although to a much greater degree. He is also an X-Man who first used the codename Thunderbird and then switched to Warpath when he joined X-Force team.

When Warpath goes to visit Thunderbird&#x27;s grave during the &quot;Necrosha&quot; storyline, he encounters the Demon Bear. After defeating the creature, with the aid of Ghost Rider, he learns that former Purifier Eli Bard has dug up Thunderbird and everyone else buried there. It is revealed that Bard used a version of the Technarch virus to resurrect Thunderbird and the others as his servants. Thunderbird is later seen with Selene&#x27;s Inner Circle and Caliban being led to the ruins of Genosha, which she dubs Necrosha. Thunderbird fights Warpath, who snaps his neck and then kills Selene. Thunderbird&#x27;s spirit is seen departing, telling his brother that he &quot;can let go now&quot;.

During the &quot;Chaos War&quot; storyline, Thunderbird is among the fallen X-Men members (along with Banshee, Moira MacTaggert, Esme and Sophie of the Stepford Cuckoos, and three deceased dupes of Multiple Man) to return from the dead after what happened to the death realms. He remembers the last time he was revived briefly during the events of Necrosha, albeit faintly. Thunderbird leads the revived X-Men members to looking for a diary written by Destiny that might hold the key to defeating Amatsu-Mikaboshi while evading Carrion Crow, Eater of the Dead. Thunderbird called upon the mythical Thunderbird to get him and his group away from the Carrion Crow. He and the group discover that Moira MacTaggert has been possessed by Destiny&#x27;s ghost. In the aftermath of the defeat of the Chaos King, Thunderbird is returned to the afterlife after reality is restored by Hercules. Thunderbird contemplates that his life finally means something and hopes that next time he was resurrected, it will be with Sophie.

When the X-Men made Krakoa a mutant paradise, the resurrection protocols brought back many dead mutants including Thunderbird. He was seen at The Green Lagoon watching Dazzler&#x27;s concert. However, his resurrection is explicitly shown on-panel in the concluding chapter of the &quot;Trial of Magneto&quot; arc (during &quot;Reign of X&quot;) as a consequence of the Scarlet Witch&#x27;s magic.

After a flashback to his revival, John Proudstar pays a visit to the Apache reservation. Upon arrival, he learns from some kids about how the local law enforcement arrested some of the inhabitants when they would not give up the ones who are mutants. Becoming Thunderbird later that night, he went to the police station to demand the release of the people from Camp Gozhoo. When the local sheriff declined, Thunderbird went on the attack while driving away the punks awaiting to be detained. One hiding police officer contacts Edwin Martynec of the Heritage Initiative (which is secretly funded by Orchis) while mentioning that they are being attacked. Upon Thunderbird finding the detained people, Martynec arrives with some Heritage Initiative operatives where they plan to harvest the X-Genes from the Native Americans that he freed. While fighting Thunderbird, Martynec transforms into a coyote-like creature as the Native Americans watch. After flashing back to when he last died, Thunderbird subdues Martynec as his grandmother Lozen arrives. Thunderbird spares Martynec and throws him towards the Orchis operatives. When Martynec taunts Thunderbird, Lozen kicks him in the head as Thunderbird leaves with his fellow Native Americans. Back on the Apache reservation, Lozen agrees to keep the secret on how Thunderbird was revived. They are both visited by Warpath after the Krakoan Gate had been planted on the Apache reservation where Warpath meets Lozen.

==Powers and abilities==
Thunderbird is a mutant who possesses superhuman strength (sufficient to rip apart a fighter jet with his bare hands), speed (he is fast enough to outrun a bison, possibly much faster), and stamina due to his dense musculature. His senses are also enhanced, enabling him to be a highly adept tracker.

Thunderbird has military training in hand-to-hand combat.

==Analysis==
In &quot;Native Americans in Comic Books - A Critical Study,&quot; Michael A. Sheyahshe compared John Proudstar to Tupac Shakur, noting that &quot;Thunderbird becomes even more popular, posthumously, than he ever was while living.&quot;

In September 2001, Bill Rosemann, the marketing communications manager of Marvel Comics, announced that &quot;The death of Thunderbird!&quot;, &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #95 had been classed number 32 in the 100 best Marvel Comics.

==Reception==
* In 2014, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Thunderbird and Warpath 62nd in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever&quot; list.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the Age of Apocalypse universe, John Proudstar is at the head of the religious group Ghost Dance whose members perform nightly dances asking the ancient spirits to bring an end to Apocalypse&#x27;s reign. They also provided safe passage to Avalon through the Infernal Gallop. When Nightcrawler had the mission to travel to Avalon and bring back the mutant known as Destiny, he forced Proudstar to provide them passage. Betrayed by Danielle Moonstar, the Madri learned of Proudstar and the Infernal Gallop&#x27;s location at Ghost Dance. The Madri soldiers killed all the members of Ghost Dance.

===Earth X===
In the Earth X reality, John Proudstar&#x27;s life is very similar. Thunderbird is seen in the Realm of the Dead talking with Professor X both believing they are still alive.

===Exiles===
An alternate version of John Proudstar is an original member of the Exiles, a group of superhumans tasked with fixing damaged realities. This Thunderbird is captured by Apocalypse during his time with the X-Men and unwillingly transformed into one of his Four Horsemen, namely War.

Thunderbird&#x27;s time with this group is relatively short, several months at most. He serves mainly as the powerhouse of the group. In the third story arc, he meets another alternate version of himself, who has become the shaman of Alpha Flight, and this arc is largely centered on his internal conflicts. Later, Thunderbird sacrifices himself to hold an anti-matter bomb within the body of Galactus, which forces the world-devourer to leave Earth after the massive injury the bomb causes. Although his physical body heals from the damage caused by the detonation, he is left in a coma. He is replaced by Sasquatch and the team are forced to leave him behind. His body is later discovered in the Panoptichron, a crystal city that lies between realities, but has yet to be returned to his home reality.

During his time with the Exiles, he develops a romantic relationship with teammate Nocturne, who is pregnant with his child when he becomes comatose. (However, she later loses the child for unexplained reasons.) Issue #16 shows flashbacks of previously unseen scenes between the two characters that further develop their relationship.

This version of Thunderbird is considerably more powerful than the mainstream one, due to Apocalypse&#x27;s augmentations. His skin is covered by retractable armor plates that harden when he enters battle, considerably increasing his durability, and even at the base level, his power statistics are above his main continuity counterpart. His power increases with his rage, akin to the Hulk who he once defeated in close combat, and his appearance becomes more bestial as he does so.

A side-effect of Apocalypse&#x27;s modifications is that Thunderbird no longer has a sense of taste. He nevertheless enjoys smelling things.

Thunderbird wakes up and escapes the stasis wall in the Panoptichron. He helps Psylocke and Cat regain control of the Panoptichron during Doctor Doom&#x27;s assault, and is later reunited with Nocturne when the Exiles and New Excalibur team up to save Roma and the Captain Britain Corps. Thunderbird leaves the team shortly after to be with Nocturne on Heather&#x27;s earth.

===House of M===
In the &quot;House of M&quot; reality, John Proudstar appears as a police detective for the New York Police Department and as the leader of the strike force known as the &quot;Brotherhood.&quot; Proudstar eventually made a deal with Wilson Fisk to bring in Luke Cage&#x27;s gang as both a matter of pride and to end his criminal activities. Thunderbird&#x27;s efforts resulted in Cage&#x27;s Avengers battling the Brotherhood, in which their defeat caused Magneto to disband it.

===Ultimate Marvel===
The &quot;Ultimate Marvel&quot; version of John Proudstar operates as Shaman appears as a member of Alpha Flight debuting in &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #94 and this version of Shaman is a mutant who possesses superior strength, speed, agility, and senses which have been boosted through the mutant-enhancement drug Banshee instead of the magical abilities of his Marvel Universe counterpart.

===What If?===
Alternate versions of the character are present in some issues of &quot;What If?&quot; which is a series of comic books whose stories explore how the Marvel Universe might have unfolded if key moments in its history had not occurred as they did in mainstream continuity.

* In &quot;What If the X-Men Died on their First Mission?,&quot; Thunderbird was among the original line-up that died when Krakoa was hurtled into space.
* In &quot;What If Professor X Become the Juggernaut?,&quot; Thunderbird was part of Juggernaut&#x27;s X-Men.
* In &quot;What If an All-New All-Different X-Men Never Existed?,&quot; Thunderbird was never recruited by Professor X and was allied with Erik the Red. He was quickly frozen by Iceman.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Thunderbird appears in the &quot;Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends&quot; episode &quot;The X-Men Adventure&quot;, voiced by John Stephenson. This version is a member of the X-Men who possesses the ability to shapeshift into a variety of North American animals instead of his comic book abilities.
* Thunderbird makes non-speaking appearances in &quot;X-Men: The Animated Series&quot;. In the opening sequence, he appears as a member of Magneto&#x27;s Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, a decision made by series producers Larry F. Houston and Will Meugniot, who sought to find equilibrium between the X-Men and their adversaries. In the episode &quot;Slave Island&quot;, Thunderbird makes a cameo appearance as a resident of Genosha. In the book &quot;Previously on X-Men: The Making of an Animated Series&quot;, series showrunner Eric Lewald explained that Thunderbird was originally intended to die in the opening episodes, but was ultimately replaced with Kevin Sydney / Morph, who seemingly dies in the two-part pilot &quot;Night of the Sentinels&quot; and resurfaces alive in later episodes.
* Thunderbird appears in &quot;The Gifted&quot;, portrayed by Blair Redford. This version is the leader of the Mutant Underground who was previously in a relationship with Dreamer and eventually goes on to enter a relationship with Blink.

===Merchandise===
* Thunderbird received a bust from Dynamic Forces in 2003.
* Thunderbird received figures from Heroclix in their &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; line and &quot;Armor Wars&quot; line.
* Thunderbird received a figure from Marvel Legends as a part of a two-pack with Storm in their &quot;Giant Size&quot; costumes.

<text>Abdoulaye Wade (; born 29 May 1926) is a Senegalese politician who served as the third president of Senegal from 2000 to 2012. He is also the Secretary-General of the Senegalese Democratic Party (PDS), having led the party since it was founded in 1974. Assuming office at 74, Wade was the oldest person to occupy the post. 

A long-time opposition leader, he ran for president four times, beginning in 1978, before he was finally elected in the year 2000. He won re-election in 2007 with a majority in the first round, but was defeated in the second round in 2012 in a controversial bid for a third term. Wade also holds French citizenship.

==Early life==
Wade was born in Kébémer, Senegal, on 29 May 1926 in wolof Family from Gandiol and walo. officially, he was born in 1926, although some claim he was born several years earlier, and the record-keeping of the time is not considered particularly reliable. He studied and taught law at the Lycée Condorcet in France. He holds two doctorates in law and economics. He was also dean of the law and economics faculty at the University of Dakar in Senegal.

==Political career==
At a summit of the Organization of African Unity in Mogadishu in 1974, Wade told President Léopold Sédar Senghor that he wanted to start a new party, and Senghor agreed to this. The PDS was founded on 31 July 1974. The party—initially intended as a Labour party—adopted liberalism in 1976 due to the introduction of a law permitting the existence of only three parties with three distinct ideologies, two of which were taken by other parties (liberalism was therefore the only remaining option). Wade first ran for President in February 1978 against Senghor, taking 17.38% of the vote. Senghor gave Wade the nickname &quot;Diombor&quot; (Wolof for hare). Also in 1978, Wade was elected to the National Assembly, where he served until 1980. Wade attracted international attention in the wake of Senghor&#x27;s announcement in late 1980 that he would resign; as the Secretary General of the PDS, he issued a statement denouncing the process and calling instead for the army to oversee a new set of elections. Subsequently he ran in the presidential elections of 1983 and 1988, taking second place each time, behind Senghor&#x27;s successor Abdou Diouf. Following the 1988 election, he was arrested due to protests against the results and received a suspended sentence. Subsequently he went to France, but returned in 1990.

In April 1991, Wade and four other PDS members joined a national unity government together with the ruling Socialist Party (PS); Wade became Minister of State without portfolio. In October 1992, he and the other PDS ministers quit the government due to complaints about the manner in which the PS was said to control the government. In the February 1993 presidential election, Wade again took second place, with 32% of the vote, behind Diouf, who won with 58%. Following the May 1993 killing of Constitutional Council Vice-President Babacar Sèye, Wade, along with other PDS leaders, faced police questioning. On 1 October, Wade, his wife, and two PDS members of the National Assembly (Abdoulaye Faye and Ousmane Ngom), were charged with complicity in the murder, although they were not held in custody or put on trial. Following riots in February 1994, Wade was arrested along with many others for allegedly threatening state security. The charge of complicity in Sèye&#x27;s murder was dismissed in May 1994, and Wade and his co-defendants began a hunger strike on 30 June. He and his co-defendants were released on 4 July, and the remaining charges were dismissed on 30 August 1994.

Wade rejoined the government as Minister of State in March 1995, but he and the other PDS ministers left again in March 1998. Although he was elected to the National Assembly in the February 1998 parliamentary election, he announced his resignation from the National Assembly in late July 1998, saying that there were &quot;enough deputies to do the job in my place&quot;.

== Presidency (2000–2012) ==

===2000 election and first term===

Wade subsequently spent a year in France, returning to Senegal on 27 October 1999. In the first round of the 2000 presidential election, held on 27 February, he again took second place, receiving 31% of the vote, but for the first time, Diouf did not win a first round majority, and consequently a second round was held on 19 March. Wade won this round with 58.49% of the vote, having received the support of candidates from the first round, including third place candidate Moustapha Niasse. Wade became President on 1 April 2000 and appointed Niasse as his Prime Minister shortly afterwards. Wade initially cohabited with the PS, which held a majority in the legislature until the PDS and its allies (the Sopi Coalition) won a majority in the April 2001 parliamentary election.

A new constitution was adopted in 2001, reducing presidential terms to five years following the completion of Wade&#x27;s seven-year term in 2007.

In September 2002, Wade received the World Peace Culture Award.

In December 2004, he signed a peace accord with rebels in Casamance after 22 years of war with rebels.

===2007 election and second term===

On 15 October 2006, Wade was nominated as presidential candidate of the PDS for the February 2007 presidential election. One of Wade&#x27;s opponents in this election was his former prime minister Idrissa Seck, who was once considered Wade&#x27;s protégé, but was arrested in 2005. Final results released on 11 March 2007, showed Wade winning in the first round with 55.9% of the vote, far ahead of his nearest opponents, Seck with about 15% and Socialist Party leader Ousmane Tanor Dieng with about 13.6%. Dieng and another opposition candidate, Abdoulaye Bathily, filed appeals regarding the election, but these were rejected by the Constitutional Council. Wade was sworn in for his second term on 3 April at the Leopold Sedar Senghor Stadium in Dakar, with many African leaders and about 60,000 spectators in attendance.

The main opposition parties did not accept Wade&#x27;s 2007 victory and disputed his legitimacy as President; they boycotted elections to the National Assembly and the re-established Senate later in the year. Wade conclusively stated in an interview published by &quot;Le Soleil&quot; on 19 May 2008 that there was no longer any possibility of dialogue with the opposition unless it recognized him as the legitimate President. &quot;Let them do what they want, it doesn&#x27;t bother me,&quot; he said of the opposition, &quot;so long as they respect law and order.&quot;

At the July 2007 African Union summit in Accra, Ghana, Wade supported quick formation of the proposed United States of Africa and said: &quot;If we fail to unite, we will become weak, and if we live isolated in countries that are divided, we face the risk of collapsing in the face of stronger and united economies.&quot;

In March 2008 in the country of Comoros, the island of Anjouan decided to declare independence. Senegal would send troops to the islands of Comoros. They would later win the war with other support as well.

===2012 election for third term===

In July 2008, the National Assembly approved a constitutional amendment increasing the length of the presidential term to seven years, as it was prior to the adoption of the 2001 constitution. This extension would not apply to Wade&#x27;s 2007–2012 term, but Minister of Justice Madické Niang stressed on this occasion that Wade could potentially run for re-election in 2012 if he was still healthy. Later, on 17 September 2009, Wade confirmed that he planned to run for a third term in 2012 &quot;if God gives me a long life&quot;.

Wade, during a 14 July 2011 speech to supporters, used the Wolof phrase &quot;&quot; (&quot;I said it, I (can) take it back&quot;) in explaining his decision to go back on his 2007 pledge not to run for another term. The phrase subsequently became a popular rallying cry for the anti-Wade opposition.

On 27 January 2012, he was officially approved by the Constitutional Council to run for a highly controversial third term. Following this declaration, enraged mobs engaged in violent protests throughout the city. After the first round vote, Abdoulaye Wade acknowledged on 27 February 2012 that he had failed to win a majority in the election and would have to face a run-off. He subsequently lost the second round of voting, held on 25 March 2012, to the opposition candidate Macky Sall; Sall had received the backing of all of the candidates who were defeated in the first round, and he defeated Wade by a wide margin.

Wade was internationally praised for his handling of the 2012 presidential election, after congratulating his opponent on his victory and peacefully stepping down. Wade&#x27;s quick concession was praised by the African Union, European Union, United Nations and the United States. It was pointed out that the leaders ruling some of Senegal&#x27;s neighbors (including Guinea, Gambia and Guinea-Bissau) had all previously used the army to maintain their grasp on power. Because of this, Wade is considered among the rare African leaders who are committed to democracy. Sall succeeded Wade as President on 2 April 2012.

== Post-presidency (2012–present) ==
Following his defeat in the presidential election, Wade remained at the helm of the PDS, even as a number of the party&#x27;s key figures abandoned it. He chose not to stand as a candidate for the July 2012 parliamentary election. The PDS won 12 seats in the vote, marking a tremendous decrease in the party&#x27;s parliamentary representation, but Wade nevertheless said that he viewed the outcome as encouraging. He said that, contrary to expectations from some quarters that the PDS would disappear after losing power, it had emerged from the vote as the largest opposition party and the only one with enough seats to form a parliamentary group.

In 2015, despite being close to his 90th birthday, Wade brushed aside suggestions that he should retire, arguing that no credible younger men had come along to succeed him as head of the PDS and that his parents both lived and worked to an advanced age.

In the July 2017 parliamentary election, Wade planned to stand as a candidate at the head of the candidate list of an opposition coalition. Khalifa Sall, another prominent opposition leader, and his supporters decided to run separately due to disagreement about whether Wade or Sall should receive the top spot on the candidate list. The divided opposition performed poorly in the election; the coalition backing President Sall won 125 seats, a majority, while Wade&#x27;s coalition trailed distantly in second place with 19 seats. As the top candidate on his coalition&#x27;s candidate list, Wade himself won a seat, although he had no intention of actually serving as a Deputy; he announced his resignation on 10 September 2017, before the National Assembly even began meeting. He explained that his purpose in running was merely to support his coalition in the election.

As of 2019, Wade, although his power has waned somewhat, remains the Secretary-General of the Senegalese Democratic Party (PDS) and still exercises considerable influence within the party.

In the July 2017 parliamentary election, the Wades and the PDS joined a large opposition alliance, in particular with Ousmane Sonko&#x27;s Pastef and Khalifa Sall&#x27;s Taxawu Senegaal. However, Abdoulaye Wade decided to quickly leave this coalition in September 2021 and recreate a coalition (Wallu Senegal) that brought together roughly the same parties as the winning Manko Wattu coalition formed for the 2017 legislative elections. These local elections were a failure for the PDS, which failed to assert itself and found itself marginalized, while at the same time, the coalition led by Ousmane Sonko and Khalifa Sall asserted itself in major cities (Dakar, Ziguinchor, Kaolack).

==Criticism==
Wade&#x27;s presidency was marred by allegations of corruption, nepotism and constraints on freedom of the press and other civil liberties.

He was also criticized for excessive spending on what have been described as &quot;prestige projects&quot;. This includes commissioning a 160+ foot bronze statue (the African Renaissance Monument), for which Wade claims he is entitled to 35% of all tourist profits it generates because of the intellectual property for conceiving the idea.

In a parallel controversy, Wade has been criticized by Christian bishops in Senegal for publicly denying the divinity of Jesus Christ, comparing him to the statues found in the African Renaissance Monument, after local imams expressed their opposition to the monument. He later regretted that his comments had caused religious offense to Christians.

Wade also received criticism in 2009 for a &quot;goodbye present&quot; he reportedly gave to a departing IMF official after the two had dinner. The present turned out to be a bag of money worth almost US$200,000.
Widespread speculation and criticism centered on the possibility that Wade was grooming his son Karim to succeed him.

During the corruption charges levied against his son Karim Wade, Wade held a press conference at his home in 2015 in which he insulted and falsely accused his successor Macky Sall of being a &quot;descendant of slaves&quot;, and that Sall&#x27;s parents were &quot;cannibals&quot; who &quot;ate babies&quot; and &quot;were chased out of the village&quot; for cannibalism. He went on to say that his son (Karim Wade) &quot;will never accept that Macky Sall is above him&quot;, and if slavery still existed today in the country, he would have sold Macky Sall into slavery.

During his presidency, Wade&#x27;s land reform laws targeted the land owning Serer community of Senegal - who have inherited their lands since lamanic times, causing many Serer farmers to lose their lands and livelihood. His land reform was strongly criticised by certain quarters of the Senegalese media.

==Personal life==
Wade married Viviane Vert in 1963. Their son, Karim Wade, served as head of the national agency of the Islamic Organization Conference and subsequently was Minister of State for International Cooperation, Urban and Regional Planning, Air Transport, and Infrastructure from 2009 to 2012. Their daughter, Sindjely Wade, worked as a Special Assistant to the President and has participated in many Paris-Dakar rallies.

Wade never renounced his French nationality after the independence of Senegal.

In March 2012, Wade announced plans to go to Saudi Arabia for a religious pilgrimage.

<doc id="393614" wikidata="Q379550" url="?curid=393614" title="Edward Natapei">
<text>Edward Nipake Natapei Tuta Fanua`araki (17 July 1954 – 28 July 2015) was a Vanuatuan politician. He was the prime minister of Vanuatu on two occasions, and was previously the minister of Foreign Affairs briefly in 1991, the acting president of Vanuatu from 2 March 1999 to 24 March 1999 (during a time in which he was the speaker of Parliament) and the deputy prime minister. He was the president of the Vanua&#x27;aku Pati, a socialist, Anglophone political party.

==Politics==
Natapei was first elected to Parliament in 1983. In 1996, he was elected as speaker of Parliament, and in 1999 he was elected as President of Vanua&#x27;aku Pati. In a parliamentary vote on 25 November 1999, Natapei was a candidate for the position of prime minister, but was defeated by Barak Sopé, receiving 24 votes against 28 for Sope. When Sopé lost a vote of no confidence, Natapei became Prime Minister on 13 April 2001, receiving 27 votes in parliament, with one vote against him. He retained the position after the May 2002 election. Even though his party performed poorly in the July 2004 election, he was re-elected as a Member of Parliament for the Port Vila Constituency with the highest number of votes. He supported Ham Lini for the post of prime minister, but Lini was defeated; however, Serge Vohor was ousted in a motion of no confidence and Ham Lini was elected prime minister. Being Vanua&#x27;aku Party President entitled Natapei to the post of Speaker of the House, which he declined and referred to Sam Dan Avock, who was a Party Executive Member.

Natapei became minister for Infrastructure and Public Utilities in the Lini-led government in July 2005. A split in Vanua&#x27;aku Pati was resolved in August 2005, and Natapei was re-elected as its president, receiving 124 votes against 67 for Sela Molisa. In late July 2007 he became Minister of Public Utilities again, replacing Serge Vohor, as well as becoming Deputy Prime Minister.

==Second term as Prime Minister (2008–2011)==
Natapei was elected Prime Minister on 22 September 2008, by the Parliament of Vanuatu after three weeks of negotiations following the country&#x27;s September 2nd general election. Natapei received 27 of the 52 votes in Parliament to become prime minister for a second time and a second non-consecutive term. He narrowly beat his nearest opponent, Maxime Carlot Korman, another former Vanuatu Prime Minister and the leader of the Vanuatu Republican Party, who captured 25 votes in Parliament. Natapei succeeded Ham Lini as prime minister and headed a new coalition government encompassing his own Vanua&#x27;aku Pati, as well as Lini&#x27;s National United Party, independents and several smaller political parties, such as Namangi Aute.

Natapei pledged to continue the policies and reforms of the outgoing Lini government. He announced that some of his government&#x27;s primary policies would include transparency, good governance and fighting corruption.

Opposition leader Maxime Carlot Korman attempted a vote of no confidence motion just two days after Natapei became prime minister. The Opposition, led by Korman, claimed that two MPs had defected from the Natapei coalition and were now supporting Korman. However, the Speaker of the Parliament George Wells rejected Korman&#x27;s motion against Natapei on a technicality saying that one of the two MPs in question had not withdrawn their support for Natapei&#x27;s government. A no-confidence vote was nevertheless held on 3 October 2008, but the motion was defeated, with 20 votes in favor and 31 votes against. Because Natapei&#x27;s government won the vote by a substantial margin, it was expected that the political situation would be stabilized as a result. Nevertheless, another motion of no confidence was attempted on 25 November 2008; Natapei survived the vote by a narrow margin of 26 to 24. Three Vanua&#x27;aku Pati MPs signed the motion of no confidence, and after they refused to withdraw their signatures, Natapei suspended them from the party immediately prior to the vote.

In November 2009 Prime Minister Natapei, facing another vote of no confidence, organized a second major cabinet reshuffle. Natapei removed half of his cabinet members and cut ties with two political parties, the National United Party and the Vanuatu Republican Party, when it was revealed that the parties and their members were planning to launch a no confidence motion against his government.

Natapei replaced the sacked cabinet members with sixteen members from the opposition Alliance. Among the highest profile reshuffles, Ham Lini, Natapei&#x27;s predecessor and a member of the NUP, was replaced as Natapei&#x27;s deputy prime minister by the leader of the Alliance bloc, Sato Kilman. In 2010 Maxime Carlot Korman was replaced as the Speaker of parliament by George Wells only for Kormanti to return later and succeed Wells in the position again . Alliance leader Sato Kilman confirmed that because of the reshuffle the Natapei government now had the support of 33 of the 52 MPs in the House.

On 27 November 2009, Natapei became ineligible to continue serving as prime minister. His parliamentary seat was declared vacant as he had missed three parliamentary sittings without informing the Speaker of the House. Despite being overseas on legitimate parliamentary business, his staff had failed to file the necessary paperwork with the Speaker to give notice of his absence. Serge Vohor became the acting prime minister. On December 5, however, Chief Justice Vincent Lunabek ruled that &quot;the Speaker’s decision to unseat the PM on 27 November 2009 was ‘unconstitutional and of no legal effect’&quot;. On December 10, Parliament formally confirmed their confidence in Natapei, who thus remained Prime Minister.

As of June 2010 Natapei retained the prime ministership, with the support of 34 MPs (against 18 for the Opposition).

On December 2, 2010 Natapei was ousted by a vote of no confidence. He was succeeded by Sato Kilman.

On June 16, 2011 however, Chief Justice Vincent Lunabek ruled in a case put forward by Natapei, contesting the constitutionality of Kilman&#x27;s election. Lunabek ruled that Kilman&#x27;s election to office had indeed been unconstitutional, as &quot;[t]he speaker of Parliament Maxime Carlot Korman [had] appointed Mr Kilman prime minister without following article 41 of the constitution which required he be elected by secret ballot&quot;. Kilman&#x27;s premiership was annulled, and Natapei was restored as interim prime minister, instructed to convene Parliament for the election of a new prime minister. Natapei immediately indicated that he himself would not be a candidate for the position, and that he would support Serge Vohor&#x27;s candidacy.

During his interim premiership, Natapei cancelled Vanuatu&#x27;s diplomatic recognition of Abkhazia, issued by Kilman the previous month.

On June 26, Parliament elected Sato Kilman to the premiership, with 29 votes to Serge Vohor&#x27;s 23, thus ending Natapei&#x27;s interim duties.

===First cabinet===

Natapei named his government&#x27;s cabinet line-up on 22 September 2008, the day of his election as prime minister. His cabinet included members of his own Vanua&#x27;aku Pati (VP) as well as the National United Party (VNUP). Natapei&#x27;s predecessor, outgoing Prime Minister Ham Lini, was named as the new Minister for Public Utilities and Works.

Natapei&#x27;s full cabinet included:
* Bakoa Kaltongga as the Minister of Justice and Social Welfare (VP)
* Sela Molisa as Finance Minister (VP)
* Paul Telukluk as Lands Minister (Namangi Aute) (Telukluk is the lone member of Natapei&#x27;s cabinet from Namangi Aute.)
* Charlot Salwai as Minister of Education (Union of Moderate Parties)
* Serge Vohor as Minister for Infrastructure &amp; Public Utilities (UMP)
* Sato Kilman as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Commerce and Industries (People&#x27;s Progressive Party)
* Moana Carcasses Kalosil as the Minister for Internal Affairs (Greens)
* Moses Kahu as Minister of Health (VP)
* Stephen Kalsakau as Minister of Agriculture
* Joe Natuman as Minister of Foreign Affairs (VP)
* Raphael Worwor as Minister of Youth, Development and Training (UMP)

A few days before the motion of no confidence was debated in Parliament Prime Minister Natapei brought into the government side the Union Of Moderate Parties (UMP) and reshuffled his cabinet for the first time as follows:
* Bakoa Kaltongga as the Minister of Foreign Affairs (VP)
* Sela Molisa as Finance Minister (VP)
* Joe Natuman as Minister of Health (VP) (Replacing Roro Sambo (VNUP))
* Ham Lini as DPM and Minister for Justice and Social Welfare (Replacing Joshua Kalsakau)(VNUP)
* James Bule as Minister for Trade, Commerce &amp; Industries (VNUP)
* Patrick Crowby as the Minister for Internal Affairs (VNUP)
* Havo Moli as Minister of Agriculture
* Don Ken as Minister of Youth, Development and Training
* Serge Vohor as Minister of Infrastructure and Public Utilities (UMP)
* Raphael Worwor as Minister of Lands (UMP) (Replacing Joe Natuman)
* Charlot Salwai as Minister of Education (UMP) (Replacing Willie Ruben Abel)
* Esmon Saimon as Minister of Ni Vanuatu Business (Independent)

==Later career==
Natapei was Leader of the Opposition during Sato Kilman&#x27;s premiership (2011–2013). On 21 March 2013, Kilman resigned, after eight of his MPs (including two government ministers) had crossed the floor to join the Opposition. Natapei backed Moana Carcasses Kalosil (leader of the Green Confederation) as the new prime minister, and Carcasses appointed him deputy prime minister and minister for foreign affairs on 23 March. As Minister for Foreign Affairs, he applied Carcasses&#x27; policy in beginning a clean-up of the sale of diplomatic passports by previous governments. Within his first few days in office, he revoked the passports of &quot;about ten&quot; diplomats who are understood to have bought them. In a review praised by Transparency International, he indicated that more than two thirds of the country&#x27;s diplomats could lose their position, as their appointment had not followed proper procedures.

Natapei lost office when the Carcasses government was brought down by a motion of no confidence on 15 May 2014.

Natapei died on 28 July 2015 at the age of 61 following a long illness.

<doc id="393617" wikidata="Q336297" url="?curid=393617" title="Ahmad Tejan Kabbah">
<text>Alhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah (16 February 1932 – 13 March 2014) was a Sierra Leonean politician who served twice as the 3rd President of Sierra Leone, from 1996 to 1997 and again from 1998 to 2007. An economist and attorney by profession, Kabbah spent many years working for the United Nations Development Programme. He retired from the United Nations and returned to Sierra Leone in 1992.

In early 1996, Kabbah was elected leader of the Sierra Leone People&#x27;s Party (SLPP) and was the party&#x27;s presidential candidate in the country&#x27;s first free presidential election later that year. He was elected with 59% of the vote, defeating his closest rival, John Karefa-Smart of the United National People&#x27;s Party (UNPP), who had 40% in the runoff vote and conceded defeat. International observers declared the election free and fair. Kabbah campaigned on a promise to end the civil war if elected president. During his inauguration speech as president, Kabbah repeated the promise to end the civil war, which he indeed achieved later in his presidency.

A deeply devoted Muslim, Kabbah was born in Pendembu, Kailahun District in Eastern Sierra Leone, though he was raised in the capital Freetown. Kabbah was an ethnic Mandingo. Kabbah was Sierra Leone&#x27;s first and currently the only Muslim head of state of the country.

Kabbah&#x27;s first marriage, in 1965, was to Patricia Tucker, a devout Christian from the Sherbro ethnic group and a native of Bonthe District in Southern Sierra Leone. He and Patricia Kabbah had five children. The two were often seen together in public before his presidency. She was very influential during his presidency, focusing mainly on humanitarian issues, and was outspoken on the need to end the civil war. She died from an illness in 1998 and thus did not live to see the war&#x27;s end in 2002.

A year after he left office as president, and ten years after the death of his wife Patricia, Kabbah married Isata Jabbie Kabbah, an ethnic Mandingo and a Muslim in an Islamic wedding ceremony in Freetown. They remained married until he died in 2014.

Most of Kabbah&#x27;s time in office was influenced by the civil war with the Revolutionary United Front, led by Foday Sankoh, which led to him being temporarily ousted by the military Armed Forces Revolutionary Council from May 1997 to March 1998. He was soon returned to power after military intervention by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), led by Nigeria. Another phase of the civil war led to the United Nations and British involvement in the country in 2000.

As President, Kabbah opened direct negotiations with the RUF rebels to end the civil war. He signed several peace accords with the rebel leader Foday Sankoh, including the 1999 Lomé Peace Accord, in which the rebels, for the first time, agreed to a temporary ceasefire with the Sierra Leone government. When the cease-fire agreement with the rebels collapsed, Kabbah campaigned for international assistance from the British, the United Nations Security Council, the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States to help defeat the rebels and restore peace and order in Sierra Leone.

Kabbah declared the civil war officially over in early 2002. Tens of thousands of Sierra Leoneans across the country took to the streets to celebrate the end of the war. Kabbah went on to easily win his final five-year term in office in the presidential election later that year, defeating his main opponent Ernest Bai Koroma of the main opposition All People&#x27;s Congress (APC) with 70.1% of the vote–the largest margin of victory for a free election in the country&#x27;s history. International observers declared the election free and fair.

==Background==

===Youth and education===
Alhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah was born on February 16, 1932, in the rural town of Pendembu, Kailahun District in the Eastern Province of British Sierra Leone. Kabbah&#x27;s father, Abu Bakr Sidique Kabbah, who worked as a businessman and a deeply religious Muslim man, was an ethnic Mandingo of Guinean descent from Kambia District in northern Sierra Leone. Kabbah&#x27;s mother, Haja Adama Coomber Kabbah, was also a deeply religious Muslim and a member of the Mende ethnic group from the Coomber family, a Chieftaincy ruling house based in the rural town of Mobai, Kailahun District in eastern Sierra Leone. A devoted Muslim himself, Kabbah&#x27;s first name Ahmad means &quot;highly praised&quot; or &quot;one who constantly thanks God&quot; in Arabic language. Kabbah was a fluent speaker of several languages including English, French, Susu, Mende, Krio and his native Mandinka language. Though born in the Kailahun District, Kabbah grew up in the capital, Freetown.

Though a devoted Muslim, Kabbah received his secondary education at the St. Edward&#x27;s Secondary School, the oldest Catholic secondary school in Freetown. He also married a Catholic, the late Patricia Kabbah, who was an ethnic Sherbro from Bonthe District in Southern Sierra Leone. Together the couple had five children.

Kabbah received his higher education at the Cardiff College of Food Technology and Commerce and University College Aberystwyth, Wales, in the United Kingdom, gaining a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in Economics in 1959. He later studied law, and in 1969 he became a practicing Barrister-at-Law and a member of the Honourable Society of Gray&#x27;s Inn, London.

==Career==
Kabbah spent nearly his entire career in the public sector. He served in the Western Area and in all the Provinces of Sierra Leone. He was a District Commissioner in Bombali and Kambia (Northern Province), in Kono (Eastern Province) and in Moyamba and Bo (Southern Province). He later became Permanent Secretary in various Ministries, including Trade and Industry, Social Welfare, and Education.

===United Nations===
Kabbah was an international civil servant for almost two decades. After serving as deputy Chief of the West Africa Division of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) in New York City, he was reassigned in 1973 to head the Programme&#x27;s operation in the Kingdom of Lesotho, as Resident Representative. He also headed UNDP operations in Tanzania and Uganda, and just before Zimbabwe&#x27;s independence, he was temporarily assigned to that country to help lay the groundwork for cooperation with the United Nations system.

After a successful tour of duty in Eastern and Southern Africa, Kabbah returned to New York to head UNDP&#x27;s Eastern and Southern Africa Division. Among other things, he was directly responsible for coordinating UN system assistance to liberation movements recognized by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), such as the African National Congress (ANC) of South Africa, and the South West African People&#x27;s Organization (SWAPO) of Namibia.

Before his retirement in 1992, Kabbah held a number of senior administrative positions at UNDP Headquarters in New York, including those of deputy director and Director of Personnel, and Director, Division of Administration and Management.

==Political career in Sierra Leone==
After the military coup in 1992, he was asked to chair the National Advisory Council, one of the mechanisms set up by the military to facilitate the restoration of constitutional rule, including the drafting of a new constitution for Sierra Leone. He reputedly intended his return to Sierra Leone to be a retirement, but was encouraged by those around him and the political situation that arose to become more actively involved in the politics of Sierra Leone.

===First term as president===

Kabbah was seen as a compromise candidate when he was put forward by the Mende-dominated Sierra Leone People&#x27;s Party (SLPP) as their presidential hopeful in the 1996 Presidential and Parliamentary elections, the first multi-party elections in twenty-three years. The SLPP won the legislative vote overwhelmingly in the South and Eastern Province of the country, they split the vote with the UNPP in the Western Area and they lost in the Northern Province.

On March 29, 1996, Alhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah was sworn in as Sierra Leone&#x27;s first freely elected president. Guided by his philosophy of &quot;political inclusion&quot;, he appointed the most broad-based government in the nation&#x27;s history, drawing from all political parties represented in Parliament, and ‘technocrats’ in civil society. One minority party did not accept his offer of a cabinet post.

The President&#x27;s first major objective was to end the rebel war which, in four years had already claimed hundreds of innocent lives, driven thousands of others into refugee status, and ruined the nation&#x27;s economy. In November 1996, in Abidjan in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, he signed a peace agreement with the rebel leader, former Corporal Foday Sankoh of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF).

The rebels reneged on the Agreement, resumed hostilities, and later perpetrated on the people of Sierra Leone what has been described as one of the most brutal internal conflicts in the world.

===Coup and exile===
In 1996, a coup attempt involving Johnny Paul Koroma and other junior officers of the Sierra Leone Army was unsuccessful, but served as notice that Kabbah&#x27;s control over military and government officials in Freetown was weakening.

In May 1997, a military coup forced Kabbah into exile in neighbouring Guinea. The coup was led by the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council, and Koroma was freed and installed as the head of state. In his Guinea exile, Kabbah began to marshal international support. Just nine months after the coup, Kabbah&#x27;s government was revived as the military-rebel junta was removed by troops of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) under the command of the Nigerian led ECOMOG (ECOWAS Ceasefire Monitoring Group) and loyal civil and military defence forces, notably the Kamajors led by Samuel Hinga Norman.

===Return to Sierra Leone===

Once again, in pursuit of peace, President Kabbah signed the Lomé Peace Accord with the RUF rebel leader Foday Sankoh on 7 July 1999. Notwithstanding repeated violations by the RUF, the document, known as the Lomé Peace Agreement, remained the cornerstone of sustainable peace, security, justice and national reconciliation in Sierra Leone. On 18 January 2002, at a ceremony marking the conclusion of the disarmament and demobilization of ex-combatants under the auspices of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), he declared that the rebel war was over.

==Saved by Nigeria and Britain==
Although elected as president, he faced the task of fighting a brutal enemy. His most crucial military support was however from outside; Nigeria was the foremost participant as they crucially intervened under the leadership of General Sani Abacha, who was then the military head of his country. In February 1998, he sent his troops to push out the infamous military junta and rebel alliance of Johnny Paul Koroma and Sam Bockarie, known as Maskita. The rebels however continued their attempt to overthrow Kabbah&#x27;s government, despite signing numerous peace accords with President Kabbah. In May 2000, Foday Saybanah Sankoh, who was then part of Kabbah&#x27;s cabinet, kidnapped several UN troops, and then ordered his rebels to march to Freetown. Trouble was looming as the capital was once more threatened with another January 6, 1999, scenario. But with the timely intervention of the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, 800 British troops were sent to Freetown to halt the impending rebel march to the city. President Kabbah was very grateful to the British Prime Minister, calling his intervention &quot;timely&quot; and one that &quot;Sierra Leonean people will never forget&quot;.

==Ending of the Civil War==

As president, Kabbah opened direct negotiations with the RUF rebels in order to end the civil war. He signed several peace accords with the rebel leader Foday Sankoh, including the 1999 Lomé Peace Accord, in which the rebels, for the first time agreed to a temporary cease fire with the Sierra Leone government. When the cease fire agreement with the rebels collapsed, Kabbah campaigned for international assistance from the British, the United Nations Security Council, the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States to defeat the rebels and restore peace and order in Sierra Leone.

In October 1999, the United Nations agreed to send peacekeepers to help restore order and disarm the rebels. The first of the 6,000-member force began arriving in December, and the UN Security Council voted in February 2000 to increase the force to 11,000, and later to 13,000. The UN peacekeeping forces were made up mainly of soldiers from the British special forces, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. The African Union special forces sent to Sierra Leone to assist the government in fighting the rebels were made up mainly of soldiers from Nigeria, Guinea, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Zambia and The Gambia. The international forces, led by the British troops, launched a number of successful military operations to repel the RUF rebels and retake many of the areas of the country that were under the rebel control. The rebel lines of communication were severely disrupted and many senior rebel leaders were captured or fled the country, including the RUF leader Foday Sankoh, who was captured.

The rebels finally agreed to be disarmed; in return the Sierra Leone government, led by Kabbah, offered them amnesty and career opportunities and counselling. The child rebels were placed in public schools, also offered counselling and reunited with family members. In 2001, UN forces moved in rebel-held areas and began to disarm the rebels.

The civil war was officially declared over in early 2002 by Kabbah. Tens of thousands of Sierra Leoneans across the country took to the streets to celebrate the end of the war. Kabbah went on to easily win his final five years term in office in the presidential election later that year with 70.1% of the vote, defeating his main opponent Ernest Bai Koroma of the main opposition All People&#x27;s Congress (APC). International observers declared the election free and fair. After the contribution made by the Bangladesh UN Peacekeeping Force in the war, Kabbah declared Bengali an honorary official language in December 2002.

==End of term and post-presidency==
Kabbah left office in September 2007 at the end of his second 5-year term. Constitutionally, he was ineligible to seek re-election. His Vice-president, Solomon Berewa, ran as the SLPP candidate to succeed Kabbah but was defeated by opposition candidate Ernest Bai Koroma of the APC.

Kabbah was the head of the Commonwealth&#x27;s observer mission for the December 2007 Kenyan election, as well as the head of the African Union&#x27;s observer mission for the March 2008 Zimbabwean election which he condemned as being &quot;rife with fraud and abuse&quot; and &quot;plagued by outrageous violence.&quot;

==Death==
Kabbah died at his home in Juba Hill, a middle class neighborhood in the west end of Freetown at the age of 82 on March 13, 2014, after a short illness. Following the announcement of Kabbah&#x27;s death, Sierra Leone&#x27;s President Ernest Bai Koroma declared a week of national mourning; and he ordered the country&#x27;s flags to be flown at half mast throughout Sierra Leone.

A state funeral was held for Kabbah. The funeral service was attended by several former heads of state, international delegations, former and current government officials, regardless of their political parties, and members of the civil services.

On March 21, 2014, Kabbah&#x27;s coffin was carried by soldiers of the Sierra Leone Armed Forces into the Sierra Leone House of Parliament where members of parliament paid their last respects to the former head of state. On March 23, 2014, Kabbah&#x27;s coffin was brought to the National Stadium, as thousands of Sierra Leoneans lined the streets of Freetown to say goodbye to their former leader. Kabbah&#x27;s body was then carried by soldiers to the Mandingo Central Mosque in Freetown where an Islamic prayer service was held before he was laid to rest at the Kissi Road Cemetery, next to his mother Hajah Adama Kabbah&#x27;s grave.

==Personal life==
Kabbah&#x27;s wife Patricia, an ethnic Sherbro, died in 1998. He has five children: Mariama, Abu, Michael, and Tejan Jr., and six grandchildren: Simone, Aidan, Abubakarr Sidique, Mariama, Nkoya, Tejan, and Zainab Kabbah. In 2008 he married Isata Jabbie Kabbah, who was about 40 years his junior.

==Honors==
President Kabbah, as chancellor of the University of Sierra Leone in Freetown holds an honorary doctor of laws degree of the university. In September 2001 Southern Connecticut State University in the United States awarded him with an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws, in recognition of his effort to bring peace to his country. In July 2006, he received another honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of Bradford in the United Kingdom, for his contribution to restoring peace in his country after a decade of civil war, and for working towards political and economic reconstruction following the end of the war.

Kabbah was a grand commander of the Order of the Republic of Sierra Leone.

<doc id="393623" wikidata="Q10879145" url="?curid=393623" title="Kowloon Walled City Park">
<text>The Kowloon Walled City Park is a park in Kowloon City, Kowloon, Hong Kong. The Kowloon Walled City had been a military stronghold since the 15th century due to its coastal location and was a slum. Under an agreement between the Government of Hong Kong and the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Kowloon Walled City was demolished in the 1990s. Some historic buildings and features were preserved for incorporation into the new park.

The Kowloon Walled City Park is designed resembling a Jiangnan garden of the early Qing dynasty. The park, 31,000 square metres (7.66 acres) in total, is divided into eight theme zones with their own characteristic scenery, matching with the style of the whole park. The design was awarded a Diploma at the IGO Stuttgart Expo 93 (International Garden Exposition).

==History==

In the middle of the 19th century, the Qing government started to build an enclave beside Kowloon Bay, surrounded by stone walls. The Kowloon Walled City was initially used for military purposes, housing many soldiers and their families. During World War II, the stone walls were demolished by the Imperial Japanese Army. Part of them were buried and well preserved under the soil. By the 1970s, the population of the city had risen to 41,000. The number of buildings was 503 in 1994. By that time, the British colonial government found it increasingly difficult to manage and control the serious crime in the area related to drugs, illegal gambling, prostitution and quackery. Domestic factories, including textile, candy-making and production of jook-sing noodles, were situated in the area. After the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984, Britain and China embarked on a discussion about solving the problems in the Walled City, and subsequently announced its demolition on 14 January 1987. Between 1987 and 1989 residents were resettled, and demolition began in 1993.

By 1995 the site had been transformed into a park for nearby residents. Due to its proximity to the Kai Tak Airport, and so that the park could have a more open view, regulation of the height of buildings was strictly enforced.

==Featured facilities==
The park consists mainly of eight landscape features: the &quot;Yamen&quot; (), Old South Gate (), Eight Floral Walks (), Garden of Four Seasons (), Garden of Chinese Zodiac (), Chess Garden (), Mountain View Pavilion () as well as the Fei Sing Pavilion () and Guibi Rock ().

The &quot;Yamen&quot; () is located in the centre of the Park and is the only remaining old Qing building. It was built in 1847; its interior was dominated by the offices of the Commodore of the Dapeng Brigade () and the Kowloon Assistant Military Inspectorate (). It was designed with three rows and four wings of houses. Its walls and column bases are built from bricks and granite, while the roof is a traditional structure covered with cylindrical and flat tiles. After 1899 the &quot;Yamen&quot; was used for charitable purposes, like housing elderly. It is now officially classified as a declared monument in Hong Kong. Six exhibition rooms are housed inside.

The original site of the South Gate () has been designated as a declared monument and all related relics unearthed have been preserved. Flagstone pavement, cornerstones of the buildings, and a drain were discovered. Also, two granite plaques with Chinese characters for &quot;South Gate&quot; and &quot;Kowloon Walled City&quot; were unearthed at the site of the original gate when the Walled City was torn down in 1994.

The Garden features 12 Chinese zodiac sculptures. They are arranged according to the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches in Chinese astrology.

The Guibi Rock was carved from Taihu stone. It is named Guibi because its veins are similar to those of ancient jade. Fui Sing Pavilion symbolises a constellation of literature and wisdom. Guibi Rock also symbolises the hope of returning Hong Kong to China.

The Mountain View Pavilion provides a view of the Lion Rock, which resembles a lion sitting with its head facing the Pavilion.

There are four large chessboards built on the ground with pebbles for visitors to enjoy a game of chess.

Located to the west of &quot;Yamen&quot;, the Kwong Yam Square is a garden where flowers of the four seasons could be seen.

Since April 2009 there also is a permanent exhibition in the park about the history of the site. It consists of one outdoor display area and six exhibition rooms, which are located inside the &quot;Yamen&quot;.

The outdoor display area near the South Gate shows a bronze miniature model of the former Walled City in front of a wall. One side of the wall has an introductory article inscribed, whereas the other side presents a cross-section of the pre-demolished city and a depiction of the daily lives of its residents.

The six exhibition rooms illustrate the living environment inside the Walled City through interactive imagery and sound.

<doc id="393625" wikidata="Q57265" url="?curid=393625" title="Omar al-Bashir">
<text>Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir (born 1 January 1944) is a Sudanese former military officer and politician who served as Sudan&#x27;s head of state under various titles from 1989 until 2019, when he was deposed in a coup d&#x27;état. He was subsequently incarcerated, tried and convicted on multiple corruption charges. He came to power in 1989 when, as a brigadier general in the Sudanese Army, he led a group of officers in a military coup that ousted the democratically elected government of prime minister Sadiq al-Mahdi after it began negotiations with rebels in the south; he subsequently replaced President Ahmed al-Mirghani as head of state. He was elected three times as president in elections that have been under scrutiny for electoral fraud. In 1992, al-Bashir founded the National Congress Party, which remained the dominant political party in the country until 2019. In March 2009, al-Bashir became the first sitting head of state to be indicted by the International Criminal Court (ICC), for allegedly directing a campaign of mass killing, rape, and pillage against civilians in Darfur. On 11 February 2020, the Government of Sudan announced that it had agreed to hand over al-Bashir to the ICC for trial.

In October 2005, al-Bashir&#x27;s government negotiated an end to the Second Sudanese Civil War, leading to a referendum in the south, resulting in the separation of the south as the country of South Sudan. In the Darfur region, he oversaw the War in Darfur that resulted in death tolls of around 10,000 according to the Sudanese Government, but most sources suggest between 200,000 and 400,000. During his presidency, there were several violent struggles between the Janjaweed militia and rebel groups such as the Sudanese Liberation Army (SLA) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) in the form of guerrilla warfare in the Darfur region. The civil war displaced over out of a total population of 6.2 million in Darfur and created a crisis in the diplomatic relations between Sudan and Chad. The rebels in Darfur lost the support from Libya after the death of Muammar Gaddafi and the collapse of his regime in 2011.

In July 2008, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Luis Moreno Ocampo, accused al-Bashir of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes in Darfur. The court issued an arrest warrant for al-Bashir on 2009 on counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, but ruled that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him for genocide. However, on 12 July 2010, the court issued a second warrant containing three separate counts of genocide. The new warrant, like the first, was delivered to the Sudanese government, which did not recognize either the warrant or the ICC. The indictments do not allege that Bashir personally took part in such activities; instead, they say that he is &quot;suspected of being criminally responsible, as an indirect co-perpetrator&quot;. The court&#x27;s decision was opposed by the African Union, Arab League and Non-Aligned Movement as well as the governments of Libya, Somalia, Jordan, Turkey, Egypt, South Sudan, Djibouti, Eritrea, Pakistan, Algeria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Palestine, Ethiopia, Tunisia, Morocco, Lebanon, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.

From December 2018 onwards, al-Bashir faced large-scale protests which demanded his removal from power. On 11 April 2019, Bashir was ousted in a military coup d&#x27;état. In September 2019, Bashir was replaced by the Transitionary Military Council which transferred executive power to a mixed civilian–military Sovereignty Council and a civilian prime minister, Abdalla Hamdok. Two months later, the Forces of Freedom and Change alliance (which holds indirect political power during the 39-month Sudanese transition to democracy), Hamdok, and Sovereignty Council member Siddiq Tawer stated that Bashir would be eventually transferred to the ICC. He was convicted of corruption in December of that year and sentenced to two years in prison. His trial regarding his role in the coup that brought him into power started on 21 July 2020.

==Early and family life==

Al-Bashir was born on 1 January 1944 in Hosh Bannaga, a village on the outskirts of Shendi, just north of the capital, Khartoum, to a family that hails from the Ja&#x27;alin tribe of northern Sudan. His mother was Hedieh Mohamed al-Zain, who died in 2019. His father, Hassan ibn Ahmed, was a smalltime dairy farmer. He is the second among twelve brothers and sisters, his younger brother Othman was killed in South Sudan during his presidency. His uncle, Al Taib Mustafa, was a journalist, politician, and noted opponent of South Sudan. As a boy, he was nicknamed &#x27;Omeira&#x27; – Little Omar. He belongs to the Banu Bedaria, a Bedouin tribe belonging to the larger Ja&#x27;alin coalition, a Sudanese Arab tribe in middle north of Sudan (once a part of the Kingdom of Egypt and Sudan). As a child, Al-Bashir loved football. &quot;Always in defense,&quot; a cousin of Omar&#x27;s said. &quot;That&#x27;s why he went into the army.&quot; He received his primary education there, and his family later moved to Khartoum North where he completed his secondary education and became a supporter of Al-Hilal. Al-Bashir is married to his cousin Fatima Khalid. He also has a second wife named Widad Babiker Omer, who had a number of children with her first husband Ibrahim Shamsaddin, a member of the Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation who had died in a helicopter crash. Al-Bashir does not have any children of his own.

In 1975, al-Bashir was sent to the United Arab Emirates as the Sudanese military attaché. When he returned home, al-Bashir was made a garrison commander. In 1981, al-Bashir returned to his paratroop background when he became the commander of an armored parachute brigade.

The Sudanese Ministry of Defense website says that al-Bashir was in the Western Command from 1967 to 1969 and then the Airborne Forces from 1969 to 1987 until he was appointed commander of the 8th Infantry Brigade (independent) from the period 1987 to 30 June 1989.

==Presidency==

===Coup d&#x27;état===

When he returned to Sudan as a colonel in the Sudanese Army, al-Bashir led a group of army officers in ousting the unstable coalition government of Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi in a bloodless military coup on 1989. Under al-Bashir&#x27;s leadership, the new military government suspended political parties and introduced an Islamic legal code on the national level. He then became chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation (a newly established body with legislative and executive powers for what was described as a transitional period), and assumed the posts of chief of state, prime minister, chief of the armed forces, and Minister of Defence. Subsequent to al-Bashir&#x27;s promotion to the chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation, he allied himself with Hassan al-Turabi, the leader of the National Islamic Front, who, along with al-Bashir, began institutionalizing Sharia law in the northern part of Sudan. Further on, al-Bashir issued purges and executions of people whom he alleged to be coup leaders in the upper ranks of the army, the banning of associations, political parties, and independent newspapers, as well as the imprisonment of leading political figures and journalists. 

On 16 October 1993, al-Bashir&#x27;s increased his power when he appointed himself President of the country, after which he disbanded the Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation and all other rival political parties. The executive and legislative powers of the council were later given to al-Bashir completely. In the early 1990s, al-Bashir&#x27;s administration gave the green light to float a new currency called Sudanese dinar to replace the battered old Sudanese pound that had lost 90 percent of its worth during the turbulent 1980s; the currency was later changed back to pounds, but at a much higher rate. He was later elected president (with a five-year term) in the 1996 national election, where he was the only candidate legally allowed to run for election.

===Elections===

Omar al-Bashir was elected president (with a five-year term) in the 1996 national election and Hassan al-Turabi was elected to a seat in the National Assembly where he served as speaker of the National Assembly &quot;during the 1990s&quot;. In 1998, al-Bashir and the Presidential Committee put into effect a new constitution, allowing limited political associations in opposition to al-Bashir&#x27;s National Congress Party and his supporters to be formed. On 1999, al-Bashir sent troops and tanks against parliament and ousted Hassan al-Turabi, the speaker of parliament, in a palace coup.

He was reelected by popular vote for a five-year term during the 2000 Sudanese general election.

From 2005 to 2010, a transitional government was set up under a 2005 peace accord that ended the 21-year long Second Sudanese Civil War and saw the formation of a power-sharing agreement between Salva Kiir&#x27;s Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Movement (SPLM) and al Bashir&#x27;s National Congress Party (NCP).

Al-Bashir was reelected president in the 2010 Sudanese general election with 68% of the popular vote; while Salva Kiir was elected President of Southern Sudan. These elections were agreed on earlier in the 2005 peace accord. The election was marked by corruption, intimidation, and inequality. European observers, from the European Union and the Carter Center, criticised the polls as &quot;not meeting international standards&quot;. Candidates opposed to the SPLM said they were often detained or stopped from campaigning. Sudan Democracy First, an umbrella organisation in the north, put forward what it called strong evidence of rigging by al-Bashir&#x27;s NCP. The Sudanese Network for Democracy and Elections (Sunde) spoke of harassment and intimidation in the south, by the security forces of the SPLM.

Al-Bashir had achieved economic growth in Sudan. This was pushed further by the drilling and extraction of oil- However, economic growth was not shared by all. Headline inflation in 2012 approached the threshold of chronic inflation (period average 36%), about 11% up from the budget projection of 2012 reflecting the combined effects of inflationary financing, the depreciation of the exchange rate, and the continued removal of subsidies, as well as high food and energy prices. This economic downturn prompted cost of living riots that erupted into Arab Spring-style anti-government demonstrations, raising discontent within the Sudanese Workers&#x27; Trade Union Federation (SWTUF). They threatened to hold nationwide strikes in support of higher wages. The continued deterioration in the value of the Sudanese pound (SDG) posed grave downside risks to already soaring inflation. This, coupled with the economic slowdown, presents serious challenges to the implementation of the approved Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP).

===Tensions with Hassan al-Turabi===

In the mid-1990s, a feud between al-Bashir and al-Turabi began, mostly due to al-Turabi&#x27;s links to Islamic fundamentalist groups, as well as allowing them to operate out of Sudan, even personally inviting Osama bin Laden to the country. The United States had listed Sudan as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1993, mostly due to al-Bashir and Hassan al-Turabi taking complete power in the early 1990s. U.S. firms have been barred from doing business in Sudan since 1997. In 1998, the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum was destroyed by a U.S. cruise missile strike because of its alleged production of chemical weapons and links to al-Qaeda. However the U.S. State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research wrote a report in 1999 questioning the attack on the factory, suggesting that the connection to bin Laden was not accurate; James Risen reported in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Now, the analysts renewed their doubts and told Assistant Secretary of State Phyllis Oakley that the C.I.A.&#x27;s evidence on which the attack was based was inadequate. Ms. Oakley asked them to double-check; perhaps there was some intelligence they had not yet seen. The answer came back quickly: There was no additional evidence. Ms. Oakley called a meeting of key aides and a consensus emerged: Contrary to what the Administration was saying, the case tying Al Shifa to Mr. bin Laden or to chemical weapons was weak.&quot;

After being re-elected president of Sudan with a five-year-term in the 1996 election with 75.7% of the popular vote, al-Bashir issued the registration of legalized political parties in 1999 after being influenced by al-Turabi. Rival parties such as the Liberal Democrats of Sudan and the Alliance of the Peoples&#x27; Working Forces, headed by former Sudanese President Gaafar Nimeiry, were established and were allowed to run for election against al-Bashir&#x27;s National Congress Party, however, they failed to achieve significant support, and al-Bashir was re-elected president, receiving 86.5% of the popular vote in the 2000 presidential election. At the legislative elections that same year, al-Bashir&#x27;s National Congress Party won 355 out of 360 seats, with al-Turabi as its chairman. However, after al-Turabi introduced a bill to reduce the president&#x27;s powers, prompting al-Bashir to dissolve parliament and declare a state of emergency, tensions began to rise between al-Bashir and al-Turabi. Reportedly, al-Turabi was suspended as chairman of National Congress Party, after he urged a boycott of the president&#x27;s re-election campaign. Then, a splinter-faction led by al-Turabi, the Popular National Congress Party (PNC) signed an agreement with Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army, which led al-Bashir to believe that they were plotting to overthrow him and the government.

Further on, al-Turabi&#x27;s influence and that of his party&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;internationalist&#x27; and ideological wing&quot; waned &quot;in favor of the &#x27;nationalist&#x27; or more pragmatic leaders who focus on trying to recover from Sudan&#x27;s disastrous international isolation and economic damage that resulted from ideological adventurism&quot;. At the same time, Sudan worked to appease the United States and other international critics by expelling members of Egyptian Islamic Jihad and encouraging bin Laden to leave.

On al-Bashir&#x27;s orders, al-Turabi was imprisoned based on allegations of conspiracy in 2000 before being released in October 2003. Al-Turabi was again imprisoned in March 2004 and released in July 2005, at the height of the peace agreement in the civil war.

===Engagement with the U.S. and European countries===

From the early 1990s, after al-Bashir assumed power, Sudan backed Iraq in its invasion of Kuwait and was accused of harboring and providing sanctuary and assistance to Islamic terrorist groups. Carlos the Jackal, Osama bin Laden, Abu Nidal and others labeled &quot;terrorist leaders&quot; by the United States and its allies resided in Khartoum. Sudan&#x27;s role in the Popular Arab and Islamic Congress (PAIC), spearheaded by Hassan al-Turabi, represented a matter of great concern to the security of American officials and dependents in Khartoum, resulting in several reductions and evacuations of American personnel from Khartoum in the early to mid 1990s.

Sudan&#x27;s Islamist links with international terrorist organizations represented a special matter of concern for the American government, leading to Sudan&#x27;s 1993 designation as a state sponsor of terrorism and a suspension of U.S. Embassy operations in Khartoum in 1996. In late 1994, in an initial effort to reverse his nation&#x27;s growing image throughout the world as a country harboring terrorists, Bashir secretly cooperated with French special forces to orchestrate the capture and arrest on Sudanese soil of Carlos the Jackal.

In early 1996, al-Bashir authorized his Defense Minister at the time, El Fatih Erwa, to make a series of secret trips to the United States to hold talks with American officials, including officers of the CIA and United States Department of State about American sanctions policy against Sudan and what measures might be taken by the Bashir regime to remove the sanctions. Erwa was presented with a series of demands from the United States, including demands for information about Osama bin Laden and other radical Islamic groups. The US demand list also encouraged Bashir&#x27;s regime to move away from activities, such as hosting the Popular Arab and Islamic Congress, that impinged on Sudanese efforts to reconcile with the West. Sudan&#x27;s Mukhabarat (central intelligence agency) spent half a decade amassing intelligence data on bin Laden and a wide array of Islamists through their periodic annual visits for the PAIC conferences. In May 1996, after the series of Erwa secret meetings on US soil, the Clinton Administration demanded that Sudan expel Bin Laden. Bashir complied.

Controversy erupted about whether Sudan had offered to extradite bin Laden in return for rescinding American sanctions that were interfering with Sudan&#x27;s plans to develop oil fields in southern areas of the country. American officials insisted the secret meetings were agreed only to pressure Sudan into compliance on a range of anti-terrorism issues. The Sudanese insisted that an offer to extradite bin Laden had been made in a secret one-on-one meeting at a Fairfax hotel between Erwa and the then CIA Africa Bureau chief on condition that Washington end sanctions against Bashir&#x27;s regime. Ambassador Timothy M. Carney attended one of the Fairfax hotel meetings. In a joint opinion piece in the Washington Post Outlook Section in 2003, Carney and Ijaz argued that in fact the Sudanese had offered to extradite bin Laden to a third country in exchange for sanctions relief.

In August 1996, American hedge-fund manager Mansoor Ijaz traveled to Sudan and met with senior officials including al-Turabi and al-Bashir. Ijaz asked Sudanese officials to share intelligence data with US officials on bin Laden and other Islamists who had traveled to and from Sudan during the previous five years. Ijaz conveyed his findings to US officials upon his return, including Sandy Berger, then Clinton&#x27;s deputy national security adviser, and argued for the US to constructively engage the Sudanese and other Islamic countries. In April 1997, Ijaz persuaded al-Bashir to make an unconditional offer of counterterrorism assistance in the form of a signed presidential letter that Ijaz delivered to Congressman Lee H. Hamilton by hand.

In late September 1997, months after the Sudanese overture (made by al-Bashir in the letter to Hamilton), the U.S. State Department, under Secretary of State Madeleine Albright&#x27;s directive, first announced it would return American diplomats to Khartoum to pursue counterterrorism data in the Mukhabarat&#x27;s possession. Within days, the U.S. reversed that decision and imposed harsher and more comprehensive economic, trade, and financial sanctions against Sudan, which went into effect in October 1997. In August 1998, in the wake of the East Africa embassy bombings, the U.S. launched cruise missile strikes against Khartoum. U.S. Ambassador to Sudan, Tim Carney, departed post in February 1996 and no new ambassador was designated until December 2019, when U.S. president Donald Trump&#x27;s administration reached an agreement with the new Sudanese government to exchange ambassadors.

Al-Bashir announced in August 2015 that he would travel to New York in September to speak at the United Nations. It was unclear to date if al-Bashir would have been allowed to travel, due to previous sanctions.

===South Sudan===

When al-Bashir took power the Second Sudanese Civil War had been ongoing for nine years. The war soon effectively developed into a conflict between the Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army and al-Bashir&#x27;s government. The war resulted in millions of southerners being displaced, starved, and deprived of education and health care, with almost two million casualties. Because of these actions, various international sanctions were placed on Sudan. International pressure intensified in 2001, however, and leaders from the United Nations called for al-Bashir to make efforts to end the conflict and allow humanitarian and international workers to deliver relief to the southern regions of Sudan. Much progress was made throughout 2003. The peace was consolidated with the official signing by both sides of the Nairobi Comprehensive Peace Agreement 9 January 2005, granting Southern Sudan autonomy for six years, to be followed by a referendum on independence. It created a co-vice president position and allowed the north and south to split oil deposits equally, but also left both the north&#x27;s and south&#x27;s armies in place. John Garang, the south&#x27;s peace agreement appointed co-vice president, died in a helicopter crash on 2005, three weeks after being sworn in. This resulted in riots, but the peace was eventually re-established and allowed the southerners to vote in a referendum of independence at the end of the six-year period. On 9 July 2011, following a referendum, the region of Southern Sudan split off from Sudan to form South Sudan.

===War in Darfur===

Since 1968, Sudanese politicians had attempted to create separate factions of &quot;Africans&quot; and &quot;Arabs&quot; in the western area of Darfur, a difficult task as the population were substantially intermarried and could not be distinguished by skin tone. This internal political instability was aggravated by cross-border conflicts with Chad and Libya and the 1984–1985 Darfur famine. In 2003, the Justice and Equality Movement and the Sudanese Liberation Army –accusing the government of neglecting Darfur and oppressing non-Arabs in favor of Arabs – began an armed insurgency.

Estimates vary of the number of deaths resulting from attacks on the non-Arab/Arabized population by the Janjaweed militia: the Sudanese government claim that up to 10,000 have been killed in this conflict; the United Nations reported that about 300,000 had died as of 2010, and other reports place the figures at between 200,000 and 400,000. During an interview with David Frost for the Al Jazeera English programme Frost Over The World in June 2008, al-Bashir insisted that no more than 10,000 had died in Darfur.

The Sudanese government had been accused of suppressing information by jailing and killing witnesses since 2004, and tampering with evidence, such as covering up mass graves. The Sudanese government has also arrested and harassed journalists, thus limiting the extent of press coverage of the situation in Darfur. While the United States government has described the conflict as genocide, the UN has not recognized the conflict as such. (&quot;see List of declarations of genocide in Darfur&quot;)

The United States Government stated in September 2004 &quot;that genocide has been committed in Darfur and that the Government of Sudan and the Janjaweed bear responsibility and that genocide may still be occurring&quot;. On 29 June 2004, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell met with al-Bashir in Sudan and urged him to make peace with the rebels, end the crisis, and lift restrictions on the delivery of humanitarian aid to Darfur. Kofi Annan met with al-Bashir three days later and demanded that he disarm the Janjaweed.

After fighting stopped in July and August, on 2006, the United Nations Security Council had approved Resolution 1706 which called for a new UN peacekeeping force consisting of 17,300 military personnel and 3,300 civilians and named the United Nations–African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID). It was intended to have supplanted or supplemented a 7,000-troop African Union Mission in Sudan peacekeeping force. Sudan strongly objected to the resolution and said that it would see the UN forces in the region as &quot;foreign invaders&quot;. A day after rejecting the UN forces into Sudan, the Sudanese military launched a major offensive in the region. In March 2007, the United Nations Human Rights Council accused Sudan&#x27;s government of taking part in &quot;gross violations&quot; in Darfur and urged the international community to take urgent action to protect people in Darfur. A high-level technical consultation was held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on 11– 2007, pursuant to the 2007 letters of the secretary-general and the chairperson of the African Union Commission, which were addressed to al-Bashir. The technical consultations were attended by delegations from the Government of Sudan, the African Union, and the United Nations.

In 2009, General Martin Luther Agwai, head of the UNAMID, said the war was over in the region, although low-level disputes remained. &quot;Banditry, localised issues, people trying to resolve issues over water and land at a local level. But real war as such, I think we are over that,&quot; he said. This perspective is contradicted by reports which indicate that violence continues in Darfur while peace efforts have been stalled repeatedly. Violence between Sudan&#x27;s military and rebel fighters has beset South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since disputed state elections in May 2011, an ongoing humanitarian crisis that has prompted international condemnation and U.S. congressional hearings. In 2012, tensions between Sudan and South Sudan reached a boiling point when the Sudanese military bombed territory in South Sudan, leading to hostilities over the disputed Heglig (or Panthou) oil fields located along the Sudan-South Sudan border. Omar al-Bashir sought the assistance of numerous non-western countries after the West, led by America, imposed sanctions against him, he said: &quot;From the first day, our policy was clear: To look eastward, toward China, Malaysia, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, and even Korea and Japan, even if the Western influence upon some [of these] countries is strong. We believe that the Chinese expansion was natural because it filled the space left by Western governments, the United States, and international funding agencies. The success of the Sudanese experiment in dealing with China without political conditions or pressures encouraged other African countries to look toward China.&quot;

Chadian President Idriss Déby visited Khartoum in 2010 and Chad kicked out the Darfuri rebels it had previously supported. Both Sudanese and Chadian sides together established a joint military border patrol.

On 26 October 2011, al-Bashir said that Sudan gave military support to the Libyan rebels, who overthrew Muammar Gaddafi. In a speech broadcast live on state television, al-Bashir said the move was in response to Gaddafi&#x27;s support for Sudanese rebels three years ago. Sudan and Libya have had a complicated and frequently antagonistic relationship for many years. President al-Bashir said the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), a Darfuri rebel group, had attacked Khartoum three years ago using Libyan trucks, equipment, arms, ammunition and money. He said God had given Sudan a chance to respond, by sending arms, ammunition and humanitarian support to the Libyan revolutionaries. &quot;Our God, high and exalted, from above the seven skies, gave us the opportunity to reciprocate the visit,&quot; he said. &quot;The forces which entered Tripoli, part of their arms and capabilities, were 100% Sudanese,&quot; he told the crowd. His speech was well received by a large crowd in the eastern Sudanese town of Kassala. But the easy availability of weapons in Libya, and that country&#x27;s poorly guarded border with Darfur, are also of great concern to the Sudanese authorities.

Al-Bashir in his speech said that his government&#x27;s priority was to end the armed rebellion and tribal conflicts in order to save blood and direct the energies of young people towards building Sudan instead of &quot;killing and destruction&quot;. He called upon youth of the rebel groups to lay down arms and join efforts to build the country. Al Bashir sees himself as a man wronged and misunderstood. He takes full responsibility for the conflict in Darfur, he says, but says that his government did not start the fighting and has done everything in its power to end it.

Al Bashir had signed two peace agreements for Darfur: 
*The 2006 Darfur Peace Agreement, also known as the &quot;Abuja Agreement&quot;, was signed on 5 May 2006 by the government of Sudan along with a faction of the SLA led by Minni Minnawi. However, the agreement was rejected by two other, smaller groups, the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and a rival faction of the SLA led by Abdul Wahid al Nur.
*The 2011 Darfur Peace Agreement, also known as the &quot;Doha Agreement&quot;, was signed in July 2011 between the government of Sudan and the Liberation and Justice Movement. This agreement established a compensation fund for victims of the Darfur conflict, allowed the president of Sudan to appoint a vice-president from Darfur, and established a new Darfur Regional Authority to oversee the region until a referendum can determine its permanent status within the Republic of Sudan.
The agreement also provided for power sharing at the national level: movements that sign the agreement will be entitled to nominate two ministers and two four ministers of state at the federal level and will be able to nominate 20 members to the national legislature. The movements will be entitled to nominate two state governors in the Darfur region.

===Indictment by the ICC===


On 14 July 2008, the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Luis Moreno Ocampo, alleged that al-Bashir bore individual criminal responsibility for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes that had been committed in Darfur since 2003. The prosecutor accused al-Bashir of having &quot;masterminded and implemented&quot; a plan to destroy the three main ethnic groups—Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa—with a campaign of murder, rape, and deportation. The arrest warrant is supported by NATO, the Genocide Intervention Network, and Amnesty International.

An arrest warrant for al-Bashir was issued on 2009 by a pre-trial chamber composed of judges Akua Kuenyehia of Ghana, Anita Usacka of Latvia, and Sylvia Steiner of Brazil indicting him on five counts of crimes against humanity (murder, extermination, forcible transfer, torture and rape) and two counts of war crimes (pillaging and intentionally directing attacks against civilians). The court ruled that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him for genocide. However, Usacka wrote a dissenting opinion arguing that there were &quot;reasonable grounds to believe that Omar Al Bashir has committed the crime of genocide&quot;.

Sudan is not a state party to the Rome Statute establishing the ICC, and thus claims that it does not have to execute the warrant. However, United Nations Security Council Resolution 1593 (2005) referred Sudan to the ICC, which gives the court jurisdiction over international crimes committed in Sudan and obligates Government of Sudan to cooperate with the ICC, and therefore the court, Amnesty International and others insist that Sudan must comply with the arrest warrant of the International Criminal Court. Amnesty International stated that al-Bashir must turn himself in to face the charges, and that the Sudanese authorities must detain him and turn him over to the ICC if he refuses.

Al-Bashir was the first sitting head of state ever indicted by the ICC. However, the Arab League and the African Union condemned the warrant. Following the indictment Al-Bashir visited China, Djibouti, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and several other countries, all of which refused to have him arrested. ICC member state Chad also refused to arrest al-Bashir during a state visit in July 2010. He was also invited to attend conferences in Denmark and Turkey. On 28 November 2011, following a visit to Kenya, Kenya&#x27;s High Court Judge Nicholas Ombija ordered the Minister of Internal Security to arrest al-Bashir, &quot;should he set foot in Kenya in the future&quot;. In June 2015, while in South Africa for an African Union meeting, al-Bashir was prohibited from leaving that country while a court decided whether he should be handed over to the ICC for war crimes. He, nevertheless, was allowed to leave South Africa soon afterward. Luis Moreno Ocampo and Amnesty International claimed that al-Bashir&#x27;s plane could be intercepted in international airspace. Sudan announced that the presidential plane would always be escorted by fighter jets of the Sudanese Air Force to prevent his arrest. In March 2009, just before al-Bashir&#x27;s visit to Qatar, the Sudanese government was reportedly considering sending fighter jets to accompany his plane to Qatar, possibly in response to France expressing support for an operation to intercept his plane in international airspace, as France has military bases in Djibouti and the United Arab Emirates.

The charges against al-Bashir have been criticized and ignored in Sudan and abroad, particularly in Africa and the Muslim world. Former president of the African Union Muammar al-Gaddafi characterized the indictment as a form of terrorism. He also believed that the warrant is an attempt &quot;by (the west) to recolonize their former colonies&quot;. Egypt said, it was &quot;greatly disturbed&quot; by the ICC decision and called for an emergency meeting of the UN security council to defer the arrest warrant. The Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa expressed that the organization emphasizes its solidarity with Sudan and condemned the warrant for &quot;undermining the unity and stability of Sudan&quot;. The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation denounced the warrant as unwarranted and totally unacceptable. It argued that the warrant demonstrated &quot;selectivity and double standard applied in relation to issues of war crimes&quot;.

Al-Bashir has rejected the charges, saying &quot;Whoever has visited Darfur, met officials and discovered their ethnicities and tribes ... will know that all of these things are lies.&quot; He described the charges as &quot;not worth the ink they are written in&quot;. The warrant was to be delivered to the Sudanese government, which stated that they would not carry it out.

The Sudanese government retaliated against the warrant by expelling a number of international aid agencies, including Oxfam and Mercy Corps. President Bashir described the aid agencies as thieves who take &quot;99 percent of the budget for humanitarian work themselves, giving the people of Darfur 1 percent&quot; and as spies in the work of foreign regimes. Bashir promised that national agencies will provide aid to Darfur.

Al-Bashir was one of the candidates in the 2010 Sudanese presidential election, the first democratic election with multiple political parties participating since the 1986 election. It had been suggested that by holding and winning a legitimate presidential elections in 2010, al-Bashir had hoped to evade the ICC&#x27;s warrant for his arrest. On 26 April, he was officially declared the winner after Sudan&#x27;s election commission announced he had received 68% of the votes cast in the election. However, &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted the voting was &quot;marred by boycotts and reports of intimidation and widespread fraud&quot;.

In August 2013, Bashir&#x27;s plane was blocked from entering Saudi Arabian airspace when Bashir was attempting to attend the inauguration of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, whose country is the main supplier of weapons to Sudan.

A second arrest warrant for al-Bashir was issued on 12 July 2010. The ICC issued an additional warrant adding 3 counts of genocide for the ethnic cleansing of the Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa tribes. The new warrant included the court&#x27;s conclusion that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that al-Bashir acted with specific intent to destroy in part the Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa ethnic groups in the Darfur region. The charges against al-Bashir, in three separate counts, include &quot;genocide by killing&quot;, &quot;genocide by causing serious bodily or mental harm&quot; and &quot;genocide by deliberately inflicting on each target group conditions of life calculated to bring about the group&#x27;s physical destruction&quot;. The new warrant acted as a supplement to the first, whereby the charges initially brought against al-Bashir all remained in place, but now included the crime of genocide which was initially ruled out, pending appeal.
Al-Bashir said that Sudan is not a party to the ICC treaty and could not be expected to abide by its provisions just like the United States, China and Russia. He said &quot;It is a political issue and double standards, because there are obvious crimes like Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan, but [they] did not find their way to the International Criminal Court&quot;. He added &quot;The same decision in which [the] Darfur case [was] being transferred to the court stated that the American soldiers [in Iraq and Afghanistan] would not be questioned by the court, so it is not about justice, it is a political issue.&quot; Al Bashir accused Luis Moreno Ocampo, the ICC&#x27;s chief prosecutor since 2003 of repeatedly lying in order to damage his reputation and standing. Al-Bashir said &quot;The behavior of the prosecutor of the court, it was clearly the behavior of a political activist not a legal professional. He is now working on a big campaign to add more lies.&quot; He added, &quot;The biggest lie was when he said I have $9bn in one of the British banks, and thank God, the British bank and the [British] finance minister … denied these allegations.&quot; He also said: &quot;The clearest cases in the world such as Palestine and Iraq and Afghanistan, clear crimes to the whole humanity – all were not transferred to the court.&quot;

In October 2013, several members of the African Union expressed anger at the ICC, calling it &quot;racist&quot; for failing to file charges against Western leaders or Western allies while prosecuting only African suspects so far. The African Union demanded that the ICC protect African heads of state from prosecution.

===Military intervention in Yemen===

In 2015, Sudan participated in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen against the Shia Houthis and forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was deposed during the 2011–2012 Yemeni Revolution. Reuters reported that &quot;The war in Yemen has given Omar Hassan al-Bashir, a skilled political operator who has ruled Sudan for a quarter-century, an opportunity to show wealthy Sunni powers that he can be an asset against Iranian influence – if the price is right.&quot;

===Allegations of corruption===

During the Second Sudanese Civil War, Al-Bashir allegedly looted Sudan of much of its wealth. According to leaked US diplomatic cables, $9 billion of his siphoned wealth was stored in banks in London. Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the chief prosecutor of the ICC, stated that some of the funds were being held in the partially nationalized Lloyds Banking Group. He also reportedly told US officials it was necessary to go public with the scale of al-Bashir&#x27;s extortion to turn public opinion against him. One US official stated &quot;Ocampo suggested if Bashir&#x27;s stash of money were disclosed (he put the figure at $9bn), it would change Sudanese public opinion from him being a &#x27;crusader&#x27; to that of a thief.&quot; &quot;Ocampo reported Lloyd&#x27;s bank in London may be holding or knowledgeable of the whereabouts of his money,&quot; the report says. &quot;Ocampo suggested exposing Bashir had illegal accounts would be enough to turn the Sudanese against him.&quot; A leaked diplomatic cable allegedly reveals that the Sudanese president had embezzled US$9 billion in state funds, but Lloyds Bank &quot;insisted it was not aware of any link with Bashir,&quot; while a Sudanese government spokesman called the claim &quot;ludicrous&quot; and attacked the motives of the prosecutor. In an interview with the Guardian, al-Bashir said, referring to ICC Prosecutor Ocampo, &quot;The biggest lie was when he said I have $9 billion in one of the British banks, and thank God, the British bank and the [British] finance minister ... denied these allegations.&quot; The arrest warrant actively increased public support for al-Bashir in Sudan.

Part of the $8.9 billion fine the BNP Paribas paid for sanctions violations was related to their trade with Sudan. While smaller fines have also been given to other banks, US Justice Department officials said that they found the BNP particularly uncooperative, calling it Sudan&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; central bank.

===African space agency===

In 2012, al-Bashir proposed setting up a continent-wide space agency in Africa. In a statement he said, &quot;I&#x27;m calling for the biggest project, an African space agency. Africa must have its space agency... [It] will liberate Africa from technological domination&quot;. This followed previous calls in 2010 by the African Union (AU) to conduct a feasibility study that would draw up a &quot;road map for the creation of the African space agency&quot;. African astronomy received a massive boost when South Africa was awarded the majority shares of the Square Kilometre Array, the world&#x27;s biggest radio telescope. It will see dishes erected in nine African countries. But skeptics have questioned whether a continental body in the style of NASA or the European Space Agency would be affordable.

===Ousting from power===

On 11 April 2019, al-Bashir was removed from his post by the Sudanese Armed Forces after many months of protests and civil uprisings. He was immediately placed under house arrest pending the formation of a transitional council. At the time of his arrest al-Bashir had been the longest-serving leader of Sudan since the country gained independence in 1956, and was the longest-ruling president of the Arab League. The army also ordered the arrest of all ministers in al-Bashir&#x27;s cabinet, dissolved the National Legislature and formed a Transitional Military Council, led by his own First Vice President and Defense Minister, Lieutenant General Ahmed Awad Ibn Auf.

==Post-presidency==

On 17 April 2019, al-Bashir was moved from house arrest to Khartoum&#x27;s Kobar Prison. On 13 May 2019, prosecutors charged al-Bashir with &quot;inciting and participating in&quot; the killing of protesters. A trial for corruption (after $130 million was found in his home) and money laundering against al-Bashir started during the following months. On 14 December 2019, he was convicted for money laundering and corruption. He was sentenced to two years in prison.

On 21 July 2020, his trial regarding the coup that brought him to power started. About 20 military personnel were indicted for their roles in the coup. On 20 December 2022, al-Bashir said that he bears full responsibility for the events that took place in the country on June 30, 1989. The trial is expected to continue for several more months and if convicted, Bashir could face a death sentence.

===International Criminal Court===

On 5 November 2019, the Forces of Freedom and Change alliance (FFC), which holds indirect political power during the 39-month Sudanese transition to democracy, stated that it had reached a consensus decision in favor of transferring al-Bashir to the ICC after the completion of his corruption and money laundering trial. In the following days, Sudanese transition period Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and Sovereignty Council member Siddiq Tawer stated that al-Bashir would be transferred to the ICC. On 11 February 2020, Sudan&#x27;s ruling military council agreed to hand over the ousted al-Bashir to the ICC in The Hague to face charges of crimes against humanity in Darfur. In October 2020, ICC Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and a delegation arrived in Sudan to discuss with the government about Bashir&#x27;s indictment. In a deal with Darfurian rebels, the government agreed to set up a special war crimes court that would include Bashir.

===Detention===
On 26 April 2023, the Sudanese Armed Forces stated that al-Bashir, Bakri Hassan Saleh, Abdel Rahim Mohammed Hussein and two other former officials were taken from Kobar Prison to Alia Military Hospital in Omdurman due to the conflict that erupted earlier that month. Al-Bashir and other officials were later taken to a hospital at Wadi Seidna Air Base, where they remained until their transfer to a facility in Merowe in September 2024. Al-Bashir is reported to be suffering from heart problems.

<text>Ronald Runaldo Venetiaan (born 18 June 1936) is a former politician who served as the sixth president of Suriname.

==Biography==
Venetiaan was born in Paramaribo. In 1955, Venetiaan left Suriname to study mathematics and physics at the University of Leiden. In 1964, he obtained his doctorandus, and returned to Suriname to become a mathematics and physics teacher.

In 1973 Venetiaan was Minister of Education for the National Party of Suriname (NPS) in the government of Henck Arron. He was disposed by the 1980 Surinamese coup d&#x27;état. Venetiaan decided to teach at the Anton de Kom University.

In 1987, Venetiaan returned to politics as the Chairman of the National Party of Suriname, and as the Minister of Education.

His first term as president ran from 1991 to 1996, after which he lost in the elections to Jules Wijdenbosch. In 2000 however, he regained his former position on the New Front banner, receiving an absolute majority of 37 from 51 votes in the Parliament.

In 2005 he was re-elected to serve a third term as president and sworn in on August 12, 2005. Venetiaan relinquished the Chair of the NPS to Gregory Rusland in 2012, and retired from politics in 2013. Venetiaan thought that it was time that the younger generation take over.

==Personal life==
Venetiaan is a mathematician beside all political activity. His surname means &quot;Venetian&quot; (a person from Venice) in Dutch. Venetiaan published his first poetry under the pseudonym Vene in &quot;Mamio&quot; (1962). Most of his work was never published but was performed in theatre plays. Venetiaan had also used the pseudonym Krumanty. Venetiaan is a collaborator on Chan Santokhi&#x27;s &quot;We gaan Suriname redden&quot; (We are going to save Suriname) of 2020.

Ronald Venetiaan is married to Liesbeth Vanenburg, and has three daughters and one son.

<doc id="393630" wikidata="Q7119796" url="?curid=393630" title="PM (BBC Radio 4)">
<text>PM, sometimes referred to as the PM programme to avoid ambiguity, is BBC Radio 4&#x27;s long-running early evening news and current affairs programme. It is currently presented by Evan Davis and produced by BBC News.

Launched in 1970, &quot;PM&quot; became the first radio news programme to feature its theme tune. It is known for its serious news content and occasional satirical commentary. Evan Davis has served as the lead presenter since 2018. The show also spun off a programme called &quot;iPM&quot;, which allowed listeners to engage in discussions and influence content through a blog. PM has won awards at the Sony Radio Academy Awards, and its production team also work on other Radio 4 programmes.

==Broadcast times==
&quot;PM&quot; is broadcast from 5pm to 6pm from Monday to Friday and from 5pm to 5:30pm on Saturdays. On weekdays it is followed by another news programme, the &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, which is followed by a comedy show on Radio 4. Until 2024, the final five minutes of the weekday edition was only broadcast on the FM version of Radio 4, as the LW version broke away from the programme at 5.54pm to broadcast the teatime shipping forecast.

==History==
&quot;PM&quot; launched on 6 April 1970, with its first presenters, William Hardcastle and Derek Cooper, promising a programme that &quot;sums up the day, and your evening starts here&quot;. Radio 4&#x27;s 10pm news programme &quot;The World Tonight&quot; was launched on the same day.

&quot;PM&quot; made history for being the first radio news programme to feature its own theme tune. Three have been used, with the last ending in 1997 in the aftermath of the death of Princess Diana. The first &quot;PM&quot; theme tune was by John Baker and the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. The second was produced by Dudley Simpson, with the final one, used between 1988 and 1997, by George Fenton.

Notable presenters after William Hardcastle included Steve Race, Brian Widlake, Robert Williams, Chris Lowe, Roger Cook, Joan Bakewell, Susannah Simons, Rachael Heyhoe Flint and Valerie Singleton (a former &quot;Blue Peter&quot; presenter – in pre-interview chats, junior ministers &quot;inevitably&quot; claimed that they still had their Blue Peter badge).

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the programme&#x27;s main presenter was Gordon Clough, who would typically prepare for the programme by completing the &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;Guardian&quot; and &quot;FT&quot; crosswords.

Valerie Singleton and Hugh Sykes co-presented the show during the 1980s but had a difficult relationship. Singleton made a one-off return to &quot;PM&quot; on 29 February 2016 to co-present a special &#x27;Leap Day&#x27; programme, alongside Eddie Mair, and proposed marriage to him at the end of the programme.

On 12 April 1998, a Saturday edition of the programme was launched.

==Presenters==

==&quot;iPM&quot;==
On 12 October 2007, the programme started an additional blog for a spin-off programme called iPM, broadcast on Saturdays at 5:30pm (immediately after the Saturday edition of &quot;PM&quot;) until 22 December and available as a podcast. &#x27;Through the blog, &quot;iPM&quot; listeners could discuss ideas with the production team and comment on the stories being lined up for the following show – so what ended up on air was shaped by the listeners.

==Humour==
Though predominantly consisting of serious news, the programme is known for occasional satirical commentary, both from the presenters and in letters from listeners.

In 2008 the programme renamed its financial news slot &quot;Upshares, Downshares&quot; and used the title music of the television drama &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;, composed by Alexander Faris. In 2009, variations on the tune performed by &quot;PM&quot; listeners in a variety of styles from bossa nova to heavy metal became a regular feature. This ended when the UK statistically left recession early in 2010. In October 2010, a compilation was released in aid of the Children in Need charity appeal, for which it raised over £70,000.

==Production==
&quot;PM&quot; is currently edited by Owenna Griffiths. The production team also works on Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The World at One&quot;, &quot;The World This Weekend&quot; and &quot;Broadcasting House&quot;.

A &quot;Radio Times&quot; poll in 2005 named Mair as the fifth most powerful person in radio.

==Awards==
The programme won two accolades in the 2007 Sony Radio Academy Awards: Gold in the Interactive Programme Award, and Silver for Speech Programme.

<text>Wadi (, alternatively &quot;wād&quot;; , Maghrebi Arabic oued, ) is the Arabic term traditionally referring to a river valley. In some instances, it may refer to a wet (ephemeral) riverbed that contains water only when heavy rain occurs.

&quot;Arroyo&quot; (Spanish) is used in the Americas for similar landforms.

==Etymology==
The term &#x27; is very widely found in Arabic toponyms. Some Spanish toponyms are derived from Andalusian Arabic where &#x27; was used to mean a permanent river, for example: Guadalcanal from &quot;wādī al-qanāl&quot; (, &quot;river of refreshment stalls&quot;), Guadalajara from &quot;wādī al-ḥijārah&quot; (, &quot;river of stones&quot;), or Guadalquivir, from &quot;al-wādī al-kabīr&quot; (, &quot;the great river&quot;).

==General morphology and processes==
Wadis are located on gently sloping, nearly flat parts of deserts; commonly they begin on the distal portions of alluvial fans and extend to inland sabkhas or dry lakes. In basin and range topography, wadis trend along basin axes at the terminus of fans. Permanent channels do not exist, due to lack of continual water flow. They have braided stream patterns because of the deficiency of water and the abundance of sediments. Water percolates down into the stream bed, causing an abrupt loss of energy and resulting in vast deposition. Wadis may develop dams of sediment that change the stream patterns in the next flash flood.
Wind also causes sediment deposition. When wadi sediments are underwater or moist, wind sediments are deposited over them. Thus, wadi sediments contain both wind and water sediments.

==Sediments and sedimentary structures==
Wadi sediments may contain a range of material, from gravel to mud, and the sedimentary structures vary widely. Thus, wadi sediments are the most diverse of all desert environments.

Flash floods result from severe energy conditions and can result in a wide range of sedimentary structures, including ripples and common plane beds. Gravels commonly display imbrications, and mud drapes show desiccation cracks. Wind activity also generates sedimentary structures, including large-scale cross-stratification and wedge-shaped cross-sets. A typical wadi sequence consists of alternating units of wind and water sediments; each unit ranging from about . Sediment laid by water shows complete fining upward sequence. Gravels show imbrication. Wind deposits are cross-stratified and covered with mud-cracked deposits. Some horizontal loess may also be present.

==Hydrological action==
Modern English usage differentiates wadis from canyons or washes by the action and prevalence of water. Wadis, as drainage courses, are formed by water, but are distinguished from river valleys or gullies in that surface water is intermittent or ephemeral. Wadis are generally dry year round, except after a rain. The desert environment is characterized by sudden but infrequent heavy rainfall, often resulting in flash floods. Crossing wadis at certain times of the year can be dangerous as a result.

Wadis tend to be associated with centers of human population because sub-surface water is sometimes available in them. Nomadic and pastoral desert peoples will rely on seasonal vegetation found in wadis, even in regions as dry as the Sahara, as they travel in complex transhumance routes.

The centrality of wadis to water – and human life – in desert environments gave birth to the distinct sub-field of wadi hydrology in the 1990s.

===Deposits===
Deposition in a wadi is rapid because of the sudden loss of stream velocity and seepage of water into the porous sediment. Wadi deposits are thus usually mixed gravels and sands. These sediments are often altered by eolian processes.

Over time, wadi deposits may become &quot;inverted wadis,&quot; where former underground water caused vegetation and sediment to fill in the eroded channel, turning previous washes into ridges running through desert regions.

<doc id="393634" wikidata="Q57366" url="?curid=393634" title="Emomali Rahmon">
<text>Emomali Rahmon (; born Emomali Sharipovich Rahmonov, born 5 October 1952) is a Tajik politician who has served as the President of Tajikistan since 1994, having previously led the country as Chairman of the Supreme Assembly from 1992 to 1994 (the post of president was temporarily abolished during this period). 

Since 18 March 1998, he has also served as the leader of the People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Tajikistan, which dominates the Parliament of Tajikistan. On 30 September 1999, he was elected vice-president of the UN General Assembly for a one-year term.

He became better known in 1992 after the abolition of the presidency, when at the dawn of the civil war he became Chairman of the Supreme Soviet (Parliament) of Tajikistan as a compromise candidate between communists and neo-communists on the one hand and liberal-democratic, nationalist and Islamist forces (the United Tajik Opposition) on the other.

Rahmon has won five undemocratic presidential elections. In addition, he extended his powers via constitutional referendums in 1999 and 2003. Since 25 December 2015, he has held the lifetime titles of &quot;Founder of Peace and National Unity&quot; and &quot;Leader of the Nation&quot;. Following the results of another constitutional referendum in 2016, amendments were adopted that removed presidential term limits.

Rahmon heads an authoritarian regime in Tajikistan with elements of a cult of personality. Political opponents are repressed, violations of human rights and freedoms are severe, elections are not free and fair, and corruption and nepotism are rampant. Various important government positions are occupied by his family members, such as his -year-old son Rustam Emomali, who is the chairman of the country&#x27;s parliament and the mayor of its capital city, Dushanbe.

==Early life==
Rahmon was born as Emomali Sharipovich Rakhmonov to Sharif Rahmonov (–1992) and Mayram Sharifova (1910–2004), a peasant family in Danghara, Kulob Oblast (present-day Khatlon Region). His father was a Red Army veteran of World War II, and recipient of the Order of Glory in the 2nd and 3rd degrees. From 1971 to 1974, Rahmon served in the Soviet Union&#x27;s Pacific Fleet, during which he was stationed in the Primorsky Krai. After completing military service, Rahmon returned to his native village where he worked for some time as an electrician.

As a rising apparatchik in Tajikistan, he became a chairman of the collective state farm of his native Danghara. According to his official biography, Rahmon graduated from the Tajik State National University with a specialist&#x27;s degree in economics in 1982. After working for several years in the Danghara Sovkhoz, Rahmon was appointed chairman of the sovkhoz in 1987.

==Early politics==
In 1990, Rahmon was elected a people&#x27;s deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Tajik SSR. President Rahmon Nabiyev was forced to resign in the first months of the Civil War in August 1992. Akbarsho Iskandrov, Speaker of the Supreme Soviet, became acting president. Iskandarov resigned in November 1992 in an attempt to end the civil unrest. That same month, the Supreme Soviet met in Khujand for its 16th session and declared Tajikistan a parliamentary republic. Rahmon was then elected by the members of the Supreme Soviet as its chairman (as the parliamentary republican system adopted by Tajikistan did not provide for a ceremonial president, he was also head of state) and the head of government. Former Interior Minister Yaqub Salimov later recalled that Rahmon&#x27;s appointment was made because he was &quot;nondescript&quot;, in which other field commanders thought that he could be cast aside &quot;when he had served his purpose.&quot;

== Presidency (1994–present) ==

In 1994, a new constitution re-established the presidency. Rahmon was elected to the post on 6 November 1994 and sworn in ten days later. During the civil war that lasted from 1992 to 1997, Rahmon&#x27;s rule was opposed by the United Tajik Opposition. As many as 100,000 people died during the war. He survived an assassination attempt on 30 April 1997 in Khujand, as well as two attempted coups in August 1997 and November 1998.

Following constitutional changes, he was re-elected on 6 November 1999 to a seven-year term, officially taking 97% of the vote. 

On 22 June 2003, a referendum was passed allowing him to run for two more consecutive seven-year terms after his term expired in 2006. Rahmon was re-elected to a seven-year term in a controversial election on 6 November 2006, with about 79% of the vote, according to official results.

In a diplomatic cable that was leaked in 2010, the United States ambassador in Tajikistan reported that Rahmon and his family controlled the country&#x27;s major businesses, including the largest bank. On 6 November 2013, he was re-elected for with about 84% of the vote, in an election process which the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe said lacked &quot;genuine choice and meaningful pluralism&quot;.

In December 2015, a law passed by Tajikistan&#x27;s parliament gave Rahmon the title &quot;Founder of Peace and National Unity – Leader of the Nation&quot; (). The &quot;Leader of the Nation&quot; component is used frequently as a shorter title. In addition to granting Rahmon lifelong immunity from prosecution, the law also gave him a number of other lifelong privileges, including veto powers over all major state decisions, the freedom to address the nation and parliament on all matters he deems important, and the privilege of attending all government meetings and parliament sessions.

On 22 May 2016, a nationwide referendum approved a number of changes to the country&#x27;s constitution. Among the main changes were the removal of presidential term limits for Rahmon, a ban on religious political parties such as the Islamic Renaissance Party, and the reduction of the minimum eligibility age for presidential candidates from 35 to 30, enabling Rahmon&#x27;s older son, Rustam Emomali, to run for president any time after 2017. In January 2017, Rustam was appointed Mayor of Dushanbe, the country&#x27;s largest city and capital.

In November 2018, Rahmon launched a hydroelectric station to solve energy problems. In October 2020, he was once again re-elected as president for a fifth term with a margin of 90.92%, amid fraud allegations. In July 2021, over 1,000 Afghan troops and civilians fled to Tajikistan after Taliban insurgents took control of many parts of Afghanistan. In response, Rahmon ordered 20,000 reserve servicemen of the country&#x27;s Ground Forces to be sent to the Afghan–Tajik border.

=== Religion policy ===
Rahmon is a Sunni Muslim and has frequently stressed his Muslim background even though his administration has suppressed public display of Islamic devotion. The government imposed bans on beards; attendance at mosque for women and children under 18; hajj for people under 40; studying in Islamic schools outside Tajikistan; the production, import or export of Islamic books without permission, implemented in 2017; using loudspeakers to broadcast the adhan; veils; madrassas; Islamist political parties; and Arabic-sounding names, implemented in 2016. Furthermore, mosques are heavily regulated, providing unofficial Islamic teaching can lead to up to 12 years of imprisonment, and an arduous process is required to obtain a permit to establish an Islamic organisation, publish an Islamic book, or go on pilgrimage to Mecca. In January 2016, Rahmon performed an Umrah with a number of his children and senior members of his government. It was his fourth pilgrimage to Mecca.

His reply to critics of the election standards of the 2006 Tajikistani presidential election was: 

During a 2010 Organisation of Islamic Cooperation session in Dushanbe, Rahmon spoke against what he called the misuse of Islam for political ends, claiming that &quot;Terrorism, terrorists, have no nation, no country, no religion... Using the name &#x27;Islamic terrorism&#x27; only discredits Islam and dishonors the pure and harmless religion of Islam.&quot;

Membership in Hizb ut-Tahrir, a militant Islamic party that aims to overthrow secular governments and unify Muslims under one Islamic state, is illegal and members are subject to arrest and imprisonment.

The Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan (IRP) is a banned Islamist political party and has been designated a terrorist organization since 2015.

In 2017, the government of Tajikistan passed a law requiring people to &quot;stick to traditional national clothes and culture&quot;, which has been widely seen as an attempt to prevent women from wearing Islamic clothing, in particular the style of headscarf wrapped under the chin, in contrast to the traditional Tajik headscarf tied behind the head.

By 2024, the Salafi movement and polygamy became popular in Tajikistan, despite both officially being banned by the government.

==Personal life==
===Family===

He is married to Azizmo Asadullayeva and has nine children. Two of his children, Rustam Emomali and Ozoda Rahmon, are senior officials in his administration, while another, Zarina Rahmon, was appointed deputy head of Orienbank in January 2017. Rustam is widely believed to be his father&#x27;s successor.

Rahmon had a sister, who reportedly died in a hospital of COVID-19 on 20 July 2021. According to local media, her sons physically assaulted the national health minister and a senior doctor.

One of his grandchildren reportedly purchased a luxury three-bedroom beachfront apartment on Dubai&#x27;s Palm Jumeirah when he was just nine years old. The property, now valued at over $1.3 million, continues to generate approximately $55,000 in annual rental income.

===Name changes===

In March 2007, Rahmonov changed his surname to &quot;Rahmon&quot;, getting rid of the Russian-style &quot;-ov&quot; ending. He also removed the patronymic, &quot;Sharipovich&quot;, from his name altogether. Rahmon explained that he had done so out of respect for his cultural heritage. Following the move, scores of government officials, including members of parliament and civil servants, also removed Russian-style patronymics and &quot;-ov&quot; endings from their surnames. In April 2016, Tajikistan officially banned giving Russian-style patronymics and surnames to newborn children.

<doc id="393639" wikidata="Q167846" url="?curid=393639" title="Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan">
<text>Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan (; 6 May 1918 – 2 November 2004) was an Emirati royal, politician, philanthropist and the founder of the United Arab Emirates. Zayed served as the governor of Eastern Region from 1946 until he succeeded Sheikh Shakhbut as the ruler of Abu Dhabi in 1966, and then as the first president of the United Arab Emirates while he retained his position as Abu Dhabi&#x27;s ruler from 1971 until his death in 2004. He is revered in the United Arab Emirates as the &quot;Waalid al-Ummah&quot; (&quot;Father of the Nation&quot;), credited for being the principal driving force behind the unification of the United Arab Emirates.

Zayed replaced his older brother Sheikh Shakhbut bin Sultan as the ruler of Abu Dhabi on 6 August 1966 after Shakhbut was deposed through a bloodless coup by members of the ruling family with British support.

==Family and early life==
Zayed was the youngest of four sons of Sheikh Sultan bin Khalifa Al Nahyan. His father was the ruler of Abu Dhabi from 1922 until his death in 1926. Zayed was the youngest of his four brothers. His eldest brother, Sheikh Shakhbut bin Sultan Al Nahyan, became ruler of Abu Dhabi after their uncle, Saqr bin Zayed Al Nahyan. His mother was Sheikha Salama bint Butti. She extracted a promise from her sons not to use violence against each other, a promise which they kept. Sheikh Zayed was named after his grandfather, Sheikh Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan (&quot;Zayed the Great&quot;), who ruled the emirate from 1855 to 1909. At the time of Sheikh Zayed&#x27;s birth, the sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi was one of seven Trucial States along the lower coast of the Persian Gulf. He also showed interest in falconry.

Zayed was born at Qasr al-Hosn, Abu Dhabi, in 1918 and moved from Abu Dhabi to Al Ain in 1926, after the death of his father. As Zayed was growing up in Al-Ain, there were no modern schools anywhere along the coast. He only received a basic instruction in the principles of Islam, and lived in the desert with Bedouin tribesmen, familiarising himself with the life of the people, their traditional skills and their ability to survive under the harsh climatic conditions.

==Career and reign==

Zayed was appointed the governor of the Eastern Region of Abu Dhabi in 1946, and was based in the Muwaiji fort in Al Ain. At this time, the area was poor and prone to outbreaks of disease. When parties from Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) began exploring for oil in the area, Zayed assisted them.

In 1952, a small Saudi Arabian force led by Turki bin Abdullah Al-Otaishan occupied the village of Hamasa in the Buraimi Oasis (the &#x27;Buraimi Dispute&#x27;). Zayed was prominent in his opposition to Saudi territorial claims and reportedly rejected a bribe of about £30 million to allow Aramco to explore for oil in the disputed territory. As part of this dispute, Zayed and his brother Hazza attended the Buraimi arbitration tribunal in Geneva in September 1955 and gave evidence to tribunal members. When the tribunal was abandoned amid allegations of Saudi bribery, the British initiated the reoccupation of the Buraimi Oasis through a local military force, the Trucial Oman Levies. A period of stability followed during which Zayed helped to develop the region and took a particular interest in the restoration of the &quot;falaj&quot; system, a network of water channels which kept the plantations of the Buraimi Oasis irrigated and fertile.

The discovery of oil in 1958, and the start of oil exports in 1962, led to frustration among members of the ruling family about the lack of progress under Sheikh Shakhbut&#x27;s rule. Shakhbut was seen as averse to spending revenue from oil money to develop the emirate by other members of Al Nahyan and hence they requested British help to install Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan as the ruler of Abu Dhabi in his stead through a bloodless coup. On 6 August 1966, Shakhbut was deposed in a bloodless palace coup. The move to replace Shakhbut with Zayed had the unanimous backing of the Al Nahyan family. The news was conveyed to Shakhbut by British Acting Resident Glen Balfour-Paul who added the support of the British to the consensus of the family. Shakhbut finally accepted the decision and, with the Trucial Oman Scouts providing safe transport, left for Bahrain. He subsequently lived in Khorramshahr, Iran before returning to live in Buraimi.

In the late 1960s, Zayed hired Katsuhiko Takahashi, a Japanese architect, to design and plan the city of Abu Dhabi. Takahashi, working to instructions from Zayed, often marked out in sand with a camel stick, was responsible for a number of key buildings, while also introducing wide roads, the construction of corniches and also greening the city. Another architect, Egyptian Abdulrahman Makhlouf, also worked to render Zayed&#x27;s instructions into city plans and infrastructural projects following Takahashi&#x27;s departure.

Between 8–11 January 1968, the UK&#x27;s Foreign Office Minister Goronwy Roberts visited the Trucial States and announced to its shocked rulers that the United Kingdom would abrogate its treaties with them and intended to withdraw from the area. In a seminal meeting on 18 February 1968 at a desert highland on the border between Dubai and Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Zayed and Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum of Dubai shook hands on the principle of founding a Federation and attempting to invite other trucial rulers to join in order that a viable nation be formed in the wake of the British withdrawal.

In 1971, after occasionally difficult negotiations with the other six rulers of the Trucial States, the United Arab Emirates was formed. Zayed was appointed to the presidency of the UAE in 1971 and was re-elected on four more occasions: 1976, 1981, 1986, and 1991.

In 1974, Zayed settled the outstanding border dispute with Saudi Arabia by the Treaty of Jeddah by which Saudi Arabia received the output of the Shaybah oilfield and access to the lower Persian Gulf in return for recognising the UAE.

In 1976 he founded the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, which grew to be the world&#x27;s third-largest sovereign investment fund by 2020, with nearly a trillion US dollars&#x27; worth of assets under management.

==Attitudes==
Sheikh Zayed was determined to unite the Emirates into federation. His calls for cooperation extended across the Persian Gulf to Iran. He advocated dialogue as the means to settle the row with Tehran over three strategic Persian Gulf islands which Iran seized from the (future) UAE Emirate of Sharjah in 1971. The islands remain in Iranian hands, despite over three decades of UAE diplomatic initiatives.

The attitude of Zayed towards his neighbors can best be seen in his position regarding the &quot;Umm al Zamul&quot; dispute (1964), when he expressed a genuine wish that his brother Sheikh Shakhbut would accept &quot;the Sultan&#x27;s proposal for a neutral zone&quot;. He said in that regard: &quot;... it was ridiculous to squabble over a [water] well so bitter that few bedouin could stomach its waters, or to split hairs over a tiny area of barren, almost totally unfrequented desert. And even if there happened to be oil in the area, Abu Dhabi had so much already that she could well afford to spare some for her less fortunate neighbours&quot;.

Furthermore, during the negotiations between Abu Dhabi and Dubai that resulted in forming the Abu Dhabi — Dubai Union (which preceded the formation of the United Arab Emirates), Sheikh Zayed was extremely generous with the Sheikh Rashid of Dubai. Kemal Hamza, Sheikh Rashid&#x27;s envoy to the meeting between Sheikh Zayed and Sheikh Rashid in Sumeih remarked that &quot;Zayed was extremely &#x27;karim&#x27; (generous) throughout the negotiations and seemed prepared to give Rashid whatever he wanted&quot;. This amounted to Zayed giving Rashid &quot;oil rights in the sea-bed that might be worth milions a year&quot; even at the risk of criticism &quot;at home for giving so much...&quot; It also gave rise to comments that such concessions constituted &quot;an alienation of territory by Abu Dhabi&quot;. But the future course of events proved, none of these arguments stood the test of judgment in light of the much higher goal that Sheikh Zayed had in mind, and which in the ultimate analysis amply justified the sacrifices incurred by him. Such concessions are rare in the records of history and news of this generosity travelled far and wide.

He was considered a relatively liberal ruler, and permitted private media. However, they were expected to practice self-censorship and avoid criticism of Zayed or the ruling families. Freedom of worship was permitted, and to a certain extent allowances were made for expatriate cultures, but this did not always sit comfortably in the eyes of the wider Arab world with Zayed&#x27;s role as a Muslim head of state.

Zayed did not shy away from controversy when it came to expressing his opinions on current events in the Arab world. Troubled by the suffering of Iraqi civilians, he took the lead in calling for the lifting of economic sanctions on Iraq imposed by the United Nations in the aftermath of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, despite Kuwaiti displeasure and opposition.

Zayed was one of the wealthiest men in the world. A &quot;Forbes&quot; estimate put his fortune at around US$20 billion in 2004. The source of this wealth was almost exclusively due to the immense oil wealth of Abu Dhabi and the Emirates, which sit on a pool of a tenth of the world&#x27;s proven oil reserves. In 1988, he purchased, for £5m, Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill, Berkshire as his English home.

==Policies and charity==
At the time the British withdrew from the Persian Gulf in 1971, Zayed oversaw the establishment of the Abu Dhabi Fund for Arab Economic Development; some of its oil riches were channeled to some forty less fortunate Islamic nations in Asia and Africa during the decades that followed.

In 1970 Zayed donated £50,000 to British politician Christopher Mayhew to establish an Arab Frienship Foundation. He also donated £40,000 to Margaret McKay, then president of the Anglo-Jordanian Alilance, to purchase a house to be used as a cultural and recreational centre for Arab students.

Using the country&#x27;s enormous oil revenues, Zayed built institutions such as hospitals, schools and universities and made it possible for UAE citizens to enjoy free access to them. He was also known for making donations to the tune of millions [pounds sterling] for worthy causes around the Arab World as well as in the neighbouring countries and in the world at large.

When asked by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in April 1997 why there is no elected legislature, Zayed replied, Why should we abandon a system that satisfies our people in order to introduce a system that seems to engender dissent and confrontation? Our system of government is based upon our religion and that is what our people want. Should they seek alternatives, we are ready to listen to them. We have always said that our people should voice their demands openly. We are all in the same boat, and they are both the captain and the crew. Our doors are open for any opinion to be expressed, and this well known by all our citizens. It is our deep conviction that Allah has created people free, and has prescribed that each individual must enjoy freedom of choice. No one should act as if they own others.

Those in the position of leadership should deal with their subjects with compassion and understanding, because this is the duty enjoined upon them by Allah, who enjoins upon us to treat all living creatures with dignity. How can there be anything less for mankind, created as Allah&#x27;s successors on earth? Our system of government does not derive its authority from man, but is enshrined in our religion and is based on Allah&#x27;s Book, the Quran. What need have we of what others have conjured up? Its teachings are eternal and complete, while the systems conjured up by man are transitory and incomplete.

Land was also often distributed &quot;gratis&quot; (free). However, while this policy benefited many landless families, enormously wealthy clans and individuals were given free land grants in proportion to their status and influence with the royal family. His majlis (a traditional Arab consultation council) was open to the public. He allowed non-Muslim religious buildings, such as churches and a temple, to be built. Zayed was also in favour of certain rights for women, such as access to education and women&#x27;s labour rights, within traditional parameters. His views regarding women&#x27;s rights were considerably more liberal than his counterparts in the GCC nations.

Zayed was one of the founders of the Dar Al Maal Al Islami Trust which was initiated by Saudi royal Mohammed bin Faisal Al Saud, King Faisal&#x27;s son, in 1981. After floods ravaged Yemen&#x27;s Ma&#x27;rib Governorate in 1982, Zayed financed the construction of the current dam of Ma&#x27;rib in 1984. This was to replace the historical one that was damaged in antiquity, and support the country&#x27;s agriculture and economy. The area of Ma&#x27;rib is reportedly from where his ancestors migrated to what is now the UAE.

==Zayed Centre==

Controversy over the opinions of the Zayed Centre caused the Harvard Divinity School to return Sheikh Zayed&#x27;s $2.5 million gift to the institution in 2000 as &quot;tainted money.&quot; Former United States president Jimmy Carter accepted the Zayed International Prize for the Environment in 2001. The award included a monetary prize of $500,000 from the Zayed Centre, and Carter stated in his acceptance speech that the award carried extra significance to him, since it was named after his personal friend.

There was similar controversy when the London School of Economics accepted a large donation by the Zayed Centre, to build a new lecture theatre in the New Academic Building in 2008. The gift was accepted with the Sheikh Zayed Theatre being the second largest lecture hall on the campus.

Harvard&#x27;s equivocation, the Carter controversy, and the engendering negative publicity, prompted Sheikh Zayed to shut down the centre in August 2003, stating that the Zayed Centre &quot;had engaged in a discourse that starkly contradicted the principles of interfaith tolerance.&quot;

==Death==
On 2 November 2004, Zayed died at the age of 86. He had been suffering from diabetes and kidney problems. He was buried in the courtyard of the new Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi. His eldest son, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, took an increasing role in government beginning in the 1980s. Directly after his father&#x27;s death, he became the Ruler of Abu Dhabi, and was ratified as the president of the United Arab Emirates by his fellow rulers in the Supreme Council.

<text>Brent Mydland (October 21, 1952 – July 26, 1990) was an American keyboardist, songwriter and singer. He was a member of the rock band The Grateful Dead from 1979 to 1990, a longer tenure than any other keyboardist in the band.

Growing up in Concord, California, Mydland took up music while in elementary school. After graduation, he played with a number of bands and recorded one album with Silver before joining Bobby and the Midnites with Bob Weir and jazz veterans Billy Cobham and Alphonso Johnson. This led to an invitation to join the Dead in 1979, replacing Keith Godchaux who had decided to leave. Mydland quickly became an important member in the Dead, using a variety of keyboards including Hammond organ and various synthesizers and singing regularly. He wrote several songs on the band&#x27;s studio albums released while he was a member.

After a tour in the early summer 1990, Mydland died of an accidental drug overdose.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born in Munich, Germany, the child of a Norwegian U.S. Army chaplain, Mydland moved to San Francisco with his parents at the age of one. Mydland spent most of his childhood in Concord, California. He started piano lessons at age six and had formal classical lessons through his junior year in high school. In an interview he commented that &quot;My sister took lessons and it looked fun to me, so I did too. There was always a piano around the house and I wanted to play it. When I couldn&#x27;t play it I would beat on it anyway.&quot; His mother, a graveyard shift nurse, encouraged Mydland&#x27;s talents by insisting that he practice his music two hours each day. He played trumpet from elementary till his senior year in high school; his schoolmates remember him practicing on an accordion, as well as the piano, every day after school.

Mydland played trumpet in the school&#x27;s marching band, but was dismissed for having long hair. He graduated from Liberty High School, Brentwood, California, in 1971.

===Pre-Grateful Dead===
Mydland began playing rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll with friends in high school (Liberty High School), and was influenced by organists such as Lee Michaels, Ray Manzarek and Steppenwolf&#x27;s Goldy McJohn. He became a fan of the Grateful Dead in the late 1960s, though was less impressed by their 1970s material.

After graduation, Mydland lived in a quonset hut in Thousand Oaks, California, writing songs. He joined a band with Rick Carlos, who was invited by John Batdorf of Batdorf &amp; Rodney to join their band. Mydland was asked to join shortly after. He then formed the band Silver with Batdorf, releasing one album on Arista Records.

Mydland then got in touch with Bob Weir via a connection from Batdorf &amp; Rodney, and joined Weir&#x27;s side project Bobby and the Midnites as keyboardist and backing vocalist.

===Grateful Dead===
Mydland joined the Grateful Dead in April 1979, replacing Keith and Donna Godchaux, who had decided to start their own band. After two weeks of rehearsals, he played his first concert with the band at the Spartan Stadium, San Jose, on April 22.

Mydland quickly became an integral part of the Dead owing to his vocal and songwriting skills as much as his keyboard playing. He quickly combined his tenor singing with founding members Weir and Jerry Garcia to provide strong three-part harmonies on live favorites. He easily fit into the band&#x27;s sound and added his own contributions, such as in &quot;Go to Heaven&quot; (1980) which featured two of Mydland&#x27;s songs, &quot;Far From Me&quot; and &quot;Easy to Love You&quot;, the latter written with frequent Weir collaborator John Perry Barlow. On the next album, &quot;In the Dark&quot; (1987), Mydland co-wrote &quot;Hell in a Bucket&quot; with Weir and Barlow; he also penned the train song &quot;Tons of Steel&quot;.

&quot;Built to Last&quot; (1989) featured several more of Mydland&#x27;s songs: the moody &quot;Just a Little Light&quot;, the environmental song &quot;We Can Run&quot;, the live-performance-driven &quot;Blow Away&quot; and the poignant &quot;I Will Take You Home&quot;, a lullaby written with Barlow for Mydland&#x27;s two daughters.

Mydland wrote several other songs that were played live but not released on any studio albums, including &quot;Don&#x27;t Need Love&quot;, &quot;Never Trust A Woman&quot;, &quot;Maybe You Know&quot;, &quot;Only a Fool&quot;, all written solo, and &quot;Gentlemen Start Your Engines&quot;, with Barlow. Many of these were intended for a solo album that was started but never completed, along with &quot;Love Doesn&#x27;t Have to be Pretty&quot;, performed live solo, but not with the Grateful Dead. He also co-wrote &quot;Revolutionary Hamstrung Blues&quot; with Phil Lesh and Lesh&#x27;s lyrical collaborator Bobby Petersen, although the song was performed live only once.

His high, gravelly vocal harmonies and emotional leads added to the band&#x27;s singing strength, and he even occasionally incorporated scat singing into his solos. Monty Byrom, guitarist on Mydland&#x27;s unreleased solo album, said Mydland was &quot;one of the most talented guys I&#x27;ve ever met. I&#x27;ve never seen anybody that could sing with those kind of notes, night after night. He was a cross between Gregg Allman and Howlin&#x27; Wolf. It was crazy.&quot; Mydland&#x27;s vocals added color to old favorites such as &quot;Cassidy&quot;, &quot;Mississippi Half-Step Uptown Toodeloo&quot;, &quot;Ramble on Rose&quot;, the Band&#x27;s &quot;The Weight&quot;, and he even wrote his own verse for Willie Dixon&#x27;s &quot;Little Red Rooster&quot;. He sang lead on many covers, including Traffic&#x27;s &quot;Dear Mr. Fantasy&quot;, the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, the Meters&#x27; &quot;Hey Pocky Way&quot;, and, with Lesh, the Spencer Davis Group&#x27;s &quot;Gimme Some Lovin&#x27;. Mydland&#x27;s instrumental interactions with Garcia became an increasingly prominent factor in the Dead&#x27;s music over the years—their duo exchanges in &quot;Friend of the Devil&quot; were an early and lasting example.

Mydland&#x27;s last show with the Grateful Dead was on July 23, 1990, at the World Music Theater, in Tinley Park, Illinois.

In 1994, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Grateful Dead.

====Equipment====
While Keith Godchaux had preferred to play only piano at concerts, Mydland was keen to experiment with different sounds during live performances. He frequently changed his setup to add new sounds. He played several different electric pianos and synthesizers throughout his tenure. Upon joining the band in 1979, his piano sounds came from a Fender Rhodes. In 1982, he switched to a Yamaha CP-70 electric grand, though he only used it for about one year. During this time he also used analog synthesizers including a Minimoog, and a Sequential Circuits Prophet-5. In 1983, he replaced his analog synthesizers and electric piano with a Yamaha GS-1 digital piano. The GS-1 is an extremely rare synthesizer, with only about 100 ever produced. In the mid-eighties, he also added an E-mu Emulator II to his rig.

In mid 1987, Mydland&#x27;s synthesizer setup changed once again. Bob Bralove had been hired by the Grateful Dead to program and maintain new MIDI systems. The GS-1 and Emulator II were replaced by a new Kurzweil MIDIboard MIDI controller, which gave Mydland the ability to use voices from an array of different synthesizer modules, and blend them together using volume pedals and foot switches. The MIDIboard, like the GS-1 it replaced, was capable of polyphonic aftertouch, a relatively rare feature in MIDI controllers. The synthesizer racks included a Roland MKS-20 digital piano, a Kurzweil 250RMX (the rack-mounted version of the famous Kurzweil K250 synthesizer), a Roland S550 sampler, an Oberheim Matrix 1000, a Lexicon PCM41 digital delay, a Lexicon PCM70 reverb/effects processor, and an Akai mixing board.
A Roland D-50 keyboard was added in the fall of 1987, and a Korg M1 keyboard was added in the fall of 1989 after experimenting with the M1R module version on the 1989 summer tour. These keyboards could be controlled through the MIDIboard, or could be played independently.

Mydland regularly played the Hammond organ, and had a B-3 with ten modified Leslie speakers in his setup for his entire tenure. The Grateful Dead purchased three B-3 organs for his use when he joined the band, and he personally owned several B-3 organs at the time of his death. The B-3 he played for the majority of his tenure with the Grateful Dead, known for once being covered with stickers, is currently used by keyboardist Jeff Chimenti during live performances. It was present at the 50th anniversary Fare Thee Well concerts in July 2015.

===Other work===
In 1982, he recorded and mastered a solo studio album, but it was never released.

In the summer of 1985, he performed with Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann in their band Kokomo along with 707&#x27;s Kevin Russell and Santana&#x27;s David Margen.

In 1985, he performed at the Haight Street Fair with Weir, John Cipollina, and Merl Saunders, among others.

In 1986, Mydland formed Go Ahead with several San Francisco Bay area musicians, including Bill Kreutzmann, also former Santana members Alex Ligertwood on vocals and David Margen on bass, as well as guitarist Jerry Cortez. The band toured during the time Jerry Garcia was recovering from a diabetic coma, and also briefly reunited in 1988.

In 1988, Mydland performed at the Bay Area Music Awards, sharing an organ with Merl Saunders and performing alongside Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, John Fogerty, and others.

He also did numerous solo projects and performances, as well as duo performances with Bob Weir numerous times throughout the 1980s, with Weir on acoustic guitar and Mydland on grand piano.

===Death===
Brent Mydland died at his home in Lafayette, California, on July 26, 1990, shortly after completing the Grateful Dead&#x27;s summer tour. An autopsy conducted by the Contra Costa Coroner&#x27;s office revealed that Mydland had died of acute cocaine and morphine intoxication. Richard Rainey, Contra Costa County coroner, stated that &quot;Toxicology tests reveal lethal levels of morphine and cocaine in the blood&quot;, a mixture &quot;commonly referred to as a &#x27;speedball&#x27;.&quot; He was the third Dead keyboardist to die (after founding member Ron &quot;Pigpen&quot; McKernan in 1973 and Keith Godchaux in 1980); Garcia said Mydland&#x27;s death was &quot;crushing&quot; and it abruptly closed a chapter of the band&#x27;s career.

Mydland is buried at Oakmont Memorial Park in Lafayette, California.

===Legacy===
Weir has said that the late &#x27;80s and early &#x27;90s with Mydland was his favorite time playing in the band.

David Gans has described Mydland as &quot;a talented synthesist [sic], who was able to play all this beautiful synthesized string stuff, but he could still kick ass and take names on the Hammond organ.&quot;

Mydland&#x27;s younger daughter, Jennifer Mydland, is an aspiring singer-songwriter.

<doc id="393642" wikidata="Q1071810" url="?curid=393642" title="Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy">
<text>The Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy is a written statement of belief formulated by more than 200 evangelical leaders at a conference convened by the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy and held in Chicago in October 1978. The statement was designed to defend the position of biblical inerrancy against a trend toward liberal conceptions of Scripture.

The subsequent November 1982 Chicago Statement on Biblical Hermeneutics recognised the need to add a hermeneutical framework to the statement.

Finally the December 1986 conference adopted the Chicago Statement on Biblical Application.

==Inerrancy statement==
The Inerrancy Statement elaborates on various details in articles formed as couplets of &quot;We affirm...&quot; and &quot;We deny...&quot;. Under the statement, inerrancy applies only to the &quot;original manuscripts&quot; which no longer exist, but which, its adherents claim, &quot;can be ascertained from available manuscripts with great accuracy&quot; (Article 10). In the statement, inerrancy does &quot;not&quot; refer to a blind literal interpretation, and that &quot;history must be treated as history, poetry as poetry, hyperbole and metaphor as hyperbole and metaphor, generalization and approximation as what they are, and so forth.&quot; It also makes it clear that the signers deny &quot;that Biblical infallibility and inerrancy are limited to spiritual, religious, or redemptive themes, exclusive of assertions in the fields of history and science. We further deny that scientific hypotheses about earth history may properly be used to overturn the teaching of Scripture on creation and the flood.&quot;

Signatories to the statement came from a variety of evangelical Christian denominations, and included Robert Preus, James Montgomery Boice, Kenneth Kantzer, J. I. Packer, Francis Schaeffer, R. C. Sproul and John F. MacArthur.

==Hermeneutics statement==
The Hermeneutics Statement recognised that &quot;the values of a commitment [to inerrancy] are only as real as one&#x27;s understanding of the meaning of Scripture&quot;. It particularly aimed to address &quot;the meaning of the &#x27;grammatico-historical exegesis&#x27; mentioned in Article XIII&quot;.

==Biblical Application statement==
The foci of the summit on Biblical Application were &quot;the Trinitarian foundations that must give shape to all the church&#x27;s life and witness, and then on a number of community concerns that come under the heading of Christian social ethics. These themes were chosen partly for their intrinsic importance and partly because there is need to dispel doubts as to whether Bible believers can ever agree on how to respond to them. ... [It] offers a high degree of consensus as to how a trusted Bible directs prayer, planning and action in today&#x27;s drifting society.&quot;

==Reception==

===Criticism within evangelicalism===
Old Testament theologian Peter Enns was greatly critical of the statement saying, &quot;Much of what burdens CSBI can be summed up as failing to reflect adequately on the nature of inspiration. The irony is clear. In their efforts to protect biblical authority, the framers define inspiration in a way that does not account well for how the Bible actually behaves.&quot;

Theologian Roger Olson recognised the political elements of the statements: &quot;In all such efforts, projects, there is a perceived &#x27;enemy&#x27; to be excluded.&quot; He adds: &quot;When I look at the Chicago Statement on inerrancy and its signatories I believe it is more a political (in the broad sense) statement than a clear, precise, statement of perfect agreement among the signatories. In other words, what was really going on there... was driven by a shared concern to establish and patrol &#x27;evangelical boundaries&#x27;.&quot;

===Criticism of position on evolution===
The Hermeneutics statement specifically came out against what it called &quot;evolutionism&quot;:
* Article 19: &quot;WE DENY that Scripture should be required to fit alien preunderstandings, inconsistent with itself, such as naturalism, evolutionism, scientism, secular humanism, and relativism.&quot;
* Article 22: &quot;WE DENY that the teachings of Genesis 1-11 are mythical and that scientific hypotheses about earth history or the origin of humanity may be invoked to overthrow what Scripture teaches about creation.&quot;

The official commentary was forthright: &quot;...a recognition of the factual nature of the account of the creation of the universe, all living things, the special creation of man, the Fall, and the Flood. These accounts are all factual, that is, they are about space-time events which actually happened as reported in the book of Genesis. ... Likewise, the use
of the term &#x27;creation&#x27; was meant to exclude the belief in macro-evolution, whether of the atheistic or theistic varieties.

The Biblical Application statement was also forthright in its denial of evolutionary thought: &quot;Mainstream Protestantism ... provides a cautionary tale in this regard, for it has erred in a radical way by acquiring the habit of regularly relativizing biblical teaching to current secular fashion, whether rationalist, historicist, evolutionist, existentialist, Marxist, or whatever. But this is to forget how sin darkens and misdirects the human intellect...&quot; and &quot;for our secular society insists on judging itself, not by the revelation of the Creator that the Bible sets forth, but by evolutionary, permissive, materialistic, hedonistic, and this-worldly yardsticks...&quot;.

The statements&#x27; rejection of the scientific consensus about evolution has been strongly criticised by thinkers within the evangelical community itself, such as Richard Wright: &quot;the important Chicago Inerrancy statements simply miss the target when addressing the relationship between science and the bible. ... [D]iscussions on science and the bible touch upon very important and profound theological issues, which require some amount of expounding, but none was given. The statements supply a surprisingly large number of articles and other declarations that insist that all the bible is literal, historical truth, including Genesis. Those articles, combined with Geisler&#x27;s commentary to those articles, reveal contradictions, inconsistencies, and a healthy dose of lazy theology.&quot;

<text>The Joseph Smith Translation (JST), also called the Inspired Version of the Holy Scriptures (IV), is a revision of the Bible by Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, who said that the JST/IV was intended to restore what he described as &quot;many important points touching the salvation of men, [that] had been taken from the Bible, or lost before it was compiled&quot;. Smith was killed before he deemed it complete, though most of his work on it was performed about a decade beforehand. The work is the King James Version of the Bible (KJV) with some significant additions and revisions. It is considered a sacred text and is part of the canon of Community of Christ (CoC), formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and other Latter Day Saint churches. Selections from the Joseph Smith Translation are also included in the footnotes and the appendix of the Latter-day Saint edition of the LDS-published King James Version of the Bible. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&#x27; edition of the Bible includes selections from the JST in its footnotes and appendix. It has officially canonized only certain excerpts that appear in the Pearl of Great Price. These excerpts are the Book of Moses and Smith&#x27;s revision of part of the Gospel of Matthew.

==Translation==

===The work of revision===
As with Smith&#x27;s other translations, he reported that he was forced to &quot;study it out in [his] mind&quot; as part of the revelatory process. During the process, Smith occasionally revisited a given passage of scripture at a later time to give it a &quot;plainer translation.&quot;

Philip Barlow observes the six basic types of changes:

:*Long additions that have little or no biblical parallel, such as the visions of Moses and Enoch, and the passage on Melchizedek
:*&quot;Common-sense&quot; changes (e.g., Genesis 6:6 &quot;And it repented the Lord that he had made man&quot; is revised in Moses 8:25 to read: &quot;And it repented Noah, and his heart was pained that the Lord had made man&quot;. God, being perfect, needs no repentance.)
:*&quot;Interpretive additions&quot;, often signaled by the phrase &quot;or in other words,&quot; appending to a passage to clarify
:*&quot;Harmonization&quot;, reconciled passages that seemed to conflict with other passages
:*&quot;Not easily classifiable&quot;, frequently the meaning is changed, often idiosyncratically
:*Grammatical improvements, technical clarifications, and modernization of terms (by far the most common within the JST/IV)

The JST/IV was a work in progress throughout Smith&#x27;s ministry, the bulk between June 1830 and July 1833. Some parts of the revision (Genesis and the four Gospels) were completed from beginning to end, including unchanged verses from the KJV; some parts were revised more than once, and others revised one verse at a time. The manuscripts were written, re-written, and in some cases, additional edits were written in the columns, pinned to the paper or otherwise attached. Smith relied on a version of the Bible that included the Apocrypha, and marked off the Bible as verses were examined (the Apocrypha was not included in the JST).
By 1833, Smith said it was sufficiently complete that preparations for publication could begin, though continual lack of time and means prevented it from appearing in its entirety during his lifetime. He continued to make a few revisions and to prepare the manuscript for printing until he was killed in 1844. Regarding the completeness of the JST/IV as we have it, Robert Matthews has written:

[T]he manuscript shows that Smith went all the way through the Bible from Genesis to Revelation. But it also shows that he did not make all the necessary corrections in one effort. This situation makes it impossible to give a statistical answer to questions about how much of the Translation was completed or how much was not completed. What is evident, however, is that any part of the Translation might have been further touched upon and improved by additional revelation and emendation by Smith.

===Use of other texts===
Some scholars infer that Smith had access to Old Testament pseudepigrapha and included insights from these texts in his translation.

In March 2017, Brigham Young University (BYU) professor Thomas A. Wayment and his undergraduate research assistant Haley Wilson-Lemmón published a notice in BYU&#x27;s &quot;Journal of Undergraduate Research&quot; suggesting that Smith borrowed heavily from Methodist theologian Adam Clarke&#x27;s famous Bible commentary. They contend that &quot;direct parallels between Smith&#x27;s translation and Adam Clarke&#x27;s biblical commentary are simply too numerous and explicit to posit happenstance or coincidental overlap.&quot; They further posit that this evidence is sufficient to &quot;demonstrate Smith&#x27;s open reliance upon Clarke&quot; before suggesting Sidney Rigdon was likely responsible for urging the use of Clarke&#x27;s source material. In a May 2018 interview, Wilson-Lemmón indicated that she had provided copies of the research manuscript to the dean of BYU Religious Education. Wayment and Wilson-Lemmón subsequently provided copies to the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the LDS Church. This prompted a meeting between Wayment and unidentified church authorities, after which they &quot;got the green light&quot; to publish.
Wayment and Wilson-Lemmón&#x27;s findings were then published in full on June 26, 2020 in &quot;Producing Ancient Scripture: Joseph Smith&#x27;s Translation Projects in the Development of Mormon Christianity&quot; published through University of Utah Press.
Wayment then published another article on the topic in the July 2020 issue of the &quot;Journal of Mormon History&quot;. In October 2020, Latter-day Saint JST scholar and then-former BYU professor Kent P. Jackson published a rebuttal to the findings of Wayment and Wilson-Lemmón in &quot;Interpreter: A Journal of Latter-day Saint Faith and Scholarship&quot;. Jackson argues that &quot;none of the examples provide can be traced to Clarke&#x27;s commentary, and almost all of them can be explained easily by other means...The few overlaps that do exist are vague, superficial, and coincidental...I do not believe there is Adam Clarke-JST connection at all[.]&quot;

==Doctrinal development==
Many of Smith&#x27;s revisions to the Bible led to significant developments in the doctrines of Mormonism. During the process of translation, when he came across troubling biblical issues, Smith often dictated revelations relevant to himself, his associates, or the church. About half of the revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants are in some way connected to this translation process, including background on the Apocrypha (LDS D&amp;C section 91 CofC D&amp;C 88), the three degrees of glory (LDS section 76 CofC Section 85), the eternal nature of marriage and plural marriage (LDS section 132), teachings on baptism for the dead (LDS section 124 CofC Section 107), and various revelations on priesthood (LDS sections 84, 88, 107 CofC Sections 83, 104).

Overall, 3,410 verses in the printed editions of JST/IV differ in textual construction from the KJV (this uses the verse numbering of the JST/IV as the basis for comparison). Of the total of 1,289 verses changed in the Old Testament, 25 correspond to the additions of Book of Moses chapter 1, and 662 occur in the Book of Genesis. Hence, more than half of the changed verses in the JST/IV Old Testament and 20 percent of those in the entire JST/IV Bible are contained in Moses chapter 1 and Genesis, with the most extensive modifications occurring in Genesis chapters 1–24. As a proportion of page count, changes in Genesis occur four times more frequently than in the New Testament and twenty-one times more frequently than in the rest of the Old Testament. The changes in Genesis are not only more numerous, but also more significant in the degree of doctrinal and historical expansion. Jeffrey M. Bradshaw has suggested that one reason for this emphasis may have been &quot;early tutoring in temple-related doctrines received by Joseph Smith as he revised and expanded Genesis 1–24, in conjunction with his later translation of relevant passages in the New Testament and, for example, the stories of Moses and Elijah.&quot; Additional evidence suggests that the Book of Moses itself could be seen as a temple text, in the sense discussed by BYU professor John W. Welch.

== Publication and use by the Community of Christ ==

Smith was killed prior to the publication of the JST/IV. At his death, the manuscripts and documents pertaining to the translation were retained by his widow, Emma Smith, who would not give them to the Quorum of the Twelve, although Willard Richards, apparently acting on behalf of Brigham Young, requested the manuscript from her. Consequently, when Young&#x27;s followers moved to the Salt Lake Valley, they did so without the new translation of the Bible.

Following Smith&#x27;s death, John Milton Bernhisel asked permission of Emma Smith to use the manuscript to copy notes into his own KJV Bible. Bernhisel spent much of the spring of 1845 working on this project. The LDS Church has Bernhisel&#x27;s Bible in its archives, but it contains less than half of the corrections and is not suitable for publication. For many years the &quot;Bernhisel Bible&quot; was the only JST/IV source for LDS Church members living in the Salt Lake Valley.

In 1866, Emma Smith gave the manuscript into the custody of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church), of which she was a member, and her son Joseph Smith III, its prophet-president. In 1867, the RLDS Church published the first edition of the IV and obtained a copyright for it. The RLDS Church, now known as Community of Christ, publishes the &quot;Inspired Version of the Holy Scriptures&quot; through the Herald House, its publishing arm. The copyright has expired on the 1867 edition and a bound photo reproduction of that edition is published by a private concern. In 1944, the RLDS Church issued a &quot;new corrected edition&quot; that eliminated some of the errors made in the original 1867 edition.

In 2024, the Community of Christ transferred ownership of the original manuscripts and Bible used in the Joseph Smith Translation to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as part of a $192.5 million acquisition of historic sites, documents, and objects.

Today, Herald Publishing House, Community of Christ&#x27;s publishing arm, sells both the Inspired Version and the NRSV. Community of Christ considers the NRSV to be a &quot;good, recent translation&quot;.

==Scholarship on JST/IV manuscripts==
Because LDS scholars had not yet had an opportunity to compare the RLDS Church&#x27;s 1944 IV edition to the original manuscripts, its initial acceptance by LDS Church members was limited. Beginning in the 1960s, explorations of the textual foundations of the JST/IV began in earnest with the pioneering work of the CofC scholar Richard P. Howard and the LDS scholar Robert J. Matthews. Matthews&#x27;s summary of an exhaustive study corroborated the RLDS claims that the 1944 and subsequent editions of JST/IV constituted a faithful rendering of the work of Smith and his scribes—insofar as the manuscripts were then understood. With painstaking effort over a period of eight years, and with the full cooperation of Community of Christ, a facsimile transcription of the original manuscripts of the JST/IV was published in 2004.

==Viewpoints within the LDS Church==
The LDS Church initially viewed the RLDS-published Inspired Version with suspicion, and favoured the Authorized King James Version (KJV) over it, although this suspicion &quot;rapidly faded&quot; during the 1970s. Following polemics by J. Reuben Clark of the First Presidency in favour of the KJV and the Greek Textus Receptus, the KJV has been firmly established as the approved English-language bible of the LDS Church.

Today, the LDS Church describes the creation of the JST/IV as Smith dictating &quot;inspired changes and additions to scribes.&quot; However, the LDS church accepts only a portion of the changes found in the JST/IV as canon. Joseph Smith–Matthew and the Book of Moses, containing translations and revelatory expansions of Matthew 24 and Genesis 1–7, respectively, are contained in the LDS Pearl of Great Price; thus, they are the only portions of the JST/IV that the LDS Church has canonized as part of its standard works. Additionally, over 600 of the more doctrinally significant verses from the translation are included as excerpts in the current LDS Church edition of the KJV. This step has ensured an increase in the JST/IV&#x27;s use and acceptance in the LDS Church today. A 1974 editorial of the LDS Church-owned &quot;Church News&quot; stated:

&quot;The Inspired Version does not supplant the King James Version as the official Church version of the Bible, but the explanations and changes made by the Prophet Joseph Smith provide enlightenment and useful commentary on many biblical passages.&quot;
Regarding the JST/IV, Bruce R. McConkie (1915–1985) of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles said, &quot;The Joseph Smith Translation, or Inspired Version, is a thousand times over the best Bible now existing on earth&quot;.

Some Mormon scholars argue that the term &quot;translation&quot; was broader in meaning in 1828 than it is today, and Smith&#x27;s work was at the time considered a revision of the English text, rather than a translation between languages; one of &quot;ideas rather than language&quot;. It is known that Smith had not studied Hebrew or Greek to produce the JST/IV manuscript, although Smith did later study Hebrew from 1836 on.

LDS scholar Royal Skousen discusses whether one should assume that every change made in the JST/IV constitutes revealed text. Besides arguments that can be made from the actual text of the JST/IV, there are questions regarding the reliability and degree of supervision given to the scribes who were involved in transcribing, copying, and preparing the text for publication. Differences are also apparent in the nature of the revision process that took place at different stages of the work. For example, while a significant proportion of the Genesis passages that have been canonized as the Book of Moses &quot;[look] like a word-for-word revealed text,&quot; evidence from a study of two sections in the New Testament that were revised twice indicates that the later &quot;New Testament JST is not being revealed word-for-word, but largely depends upon Joseph Smith&#x27;s varying responses to the same difficulties in the text.&quot;

<text>Zener cards are cards used to conduct experiments for extrasensory perception (ESP). Perceptual psychologist Karl Zener (1903–1964) designed the cards in the early 1930s for experiments conducted with his colleague, parapsychologist J. B. Rhine (1895–1980). 
==Overview==
The Zener cards are a deck of 25 cards, five of each symbol. The five symbols are a hollow circle, a plus sign, three vertical wavy lines, a hollow square, and a hollow five-pointed star.

In a test for ESP, the experimenter picks up a card in a shuffled pack, observes the symbol, and records the answer of the person being tested, who would guess which of the five designs is on the card. The experimenter continues until all the cards in the pack are used.

Poor shuffling methods can make the order of cards in the deck easier to predict and the cards could have been inadvertently or intentionally marked and manipulated. In his experiments, J. B. Rhine first shuffled the cards by hand but later decided to use a machine for shuffling.

In his book, &quot;The New Apocrypha&quot;, John Sladek expressed incredulity at the tests, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s astonishing that playing cards should have been chosen for ESP research at all. They are, after all, the instruments of stage magicians and second-dealing gamblers; they can be marked and manipulated in many traditional ways. At the best of times, card-shuffling is a poor way of getting a random distribution of symbols.&quot;

Rhine&#x27;s experiments with Zener cards were discredited due to either sensory leakage, cheating, or both. The latter included the subject being able to read the symbols from slight indentations on the backs of cards, and being able to both see and hear the experimenter, which allowed the subject to note facial expressions and breathing patterns.

Terence Hines has written of the original experiments:

The methods the Rhines used to prevent subjects from gaining hints and clues as to the design on the cards were far from adequate. In many experiments, the cards were displayed face up, but hidden behind a small wooden shield. Several ways of obtaining information about the design on the card remain even in the presence of the shield. For instance, the subject may be able sometimes to see the design on the face-up card reflected in the agent’s glasses. Even if the agent isn’t wearing glasses, it is possible to see the reflection in his cornea.

Once Rhine took precautions in response to criticisms of his methods, he was unable to find any high-scoring subjects.

James Alcock notes, &quot;Despite Rhine’s confidence that he had established the reality of extrasensory perception, he had not done so. Methodological problems with his experiments eventually came to light, and as a result, parapsychologists no longer run card-guessing studies and rarely even refer to Rhine’s work.&quot;

The chemist Irving Langmuir called Rhine&#x27;s experiments an example of pathological science–&quot;the science of things that aren&#x27;t so,&quot; as he described it–and criticized its practitioners not as dishonest people but as ones that have sufficiently fooled themselves.

During James Randi&#x27;s TV special, &quot;Exploring Psychic Powers Live!&quot;, a psychic was tested on a deck of 250 Zener cards and was only able to predict 50 of them correctly, which is the expected result of random guessing the cards.

In 2016, Massimo Polidoro tested an Italian mother and daughter who were claiming a 90% and above success rate of psychic transmission using Zener cards. Upon restricting them from seeing each other&#x27;s faces and the use of a silent writing method, their success rate dropped to no better than chance. The women were cognizant of the fact that they required visual contact to achieve transmission of the symbols, saying, &quot;This kind of understanding is so natural to us, all this attention to us is also very surprising. There are no tricks, but surely we understand each other with looks. It always happens.&quot;

==Statistics==

The results of many tests using Zener cards fit with a typical normal distribution.

Probability predicts these test results for a test of 25 questions with five possible answers if chance is operating:
* 79.3% of people will get between 3 and 7 correct.
* 10.9% will get 8 or more correct.
* One person in 73,700 will get 15 or more correct.
* One person in 5.16 billion will get 20 or more correct.
* One person in 298 quadrillion will get all 25 correct.
