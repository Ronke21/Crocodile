<text>Fidesz – Hungarian Civic Alliance (; ) is a right-wing populist and national-conservative political party in Hungary led by Viktor Orbán. It has increasingly identified as illiberal.

Originally formed in 1988 under the name of Alliance of Young Democrats () as a centre-left and liberal activist movement that opposed the ruling Marxist–Leninist government. It was registered as a political party in 1990, with Orbán as its leader. It entered the National Assembly following the 1990 parliamentary election. Following the 1998 election, it successfully formed a centre-right government. It adopted nationalism in the early 2000s, but its popularity declined due to corruption scandals. It was in opposition between 2002 and 2010, and in 2006 it formed a coalition with the Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party (KDNP).

Fidesz won a supermajority in the 2010 election, adopted national-conservative policies, shifted further to the right and became Eurosceptic. The 2011 adoption of a new Hungarian constitution was highly controversial as it consolidated power with Fidesz. Having set Hungary on a path of democratic backsliding, its majority of seats remained after the 2014 election, and following the escalation of the migrant crisis, Fidesz began using right-wing populist and anti-immigrant rhetoric.

Following the 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election, it currently holds a majority in the National Assembly with 135 seats. It has also held the presidency since 2010, has endorsed the election of every president since 2000, and it enjoys majorities in all 19 county assemblies, while being in opposition in the General Assembly of Budapest. Fidesz was initially a member of the Liberal International until 2000, after which it joined the European People&#x27;s Party. It remained its member until 2021, and since then it has served with the Non-Inscrits group within the European Parliament. On 30 June 2024, the ANO 2011, the Freedom Party of Austria, and Fidesz, created a new alliance named Patriots for Europe.

==History==
=== 1988–1989: Liberal activist beginnings ===
The party was founded in the spring of 1988 and named &quot;Fiatal Demokraták Szövetsége&quot; &quot;(Alliance of Young Democrats)&quot; with the acronym &quot;FIDESZ&quot;. It grew out of an underground liberal student activist movement opposed to the ruling Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party. Founding such a movement was semi-illegal at the time, so the founders risked their careers by being involved in the opposition. The membership had an upper age limit of 35 years (this requirement was abolished at the 1993 party congress).

In 1989, Fidesz won the Thorolf Rafto Memorial Prize. The movement was represented at the award ceremony by one of its leaders, Péter Molnár, who later became a Member of Parliament in Hungary.

=== 1990–1998: Centre-left opposition and conservative turn ===
In the 1990 elections, the party entered the National Assembly after winning about 6% of the vote. They became a small, though quite popular oppositional party. In 1992, Fidesz joined the Liberal International. At the time, it was a moderate liberal centrist party, sometimes also described as social-liberal.

At the 1993 party congress, it changed its political position from liberal to civic-centrist (&quot;polgári centrumpárt&quot;). The turn in ideology caused a severe split in the membership. Péter Molnár left the party along with Gábor Fodor and Klára Ungár, who joined the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats. Viktor Orbán was elected party chairman.

After its disappointing result in the 1994 elections, Fidesz remained an opposition party but grew increasingly conservative. In 1995, it changed its name to &quot;Hungarian Civic Party&quot; (&quot;Magyar Polgári Párt&quot;) and sought connections to the national-conservative Hungarian Democratic Forum, a former governing party.

=== 1998–2002: First Orbán government ===
Fidesz gained power for the first time at the 1998 elections, with Viktor Orbán becoming prime minister. Their coalition partners were the smaller Hungarian Democratic Forum and the Independent Smallholders&#x27; Party. In 2000, Fidesz terminated its membership in the Liberal International and joined the European People&#x27;s Party. The government constituted a &quot;relatively conventional European conservative&quot; rule.

=== 2002–2010: Return to opposition ===

Fidesz narrowly lost the 2002 elections to the Hungarian Socialist Party, garnering 41.07% to the Socialists&#x27; 42.05%. Fidesz had 169 members of the National Assembly, out of a total of 386. Immediately after the election, they accused the opponents of electoral fraud. The 2002 Hungarian municipal elections saw again huge Fidesz losses.

In the spring of 2003, Fidesz took its current name, &quot;Fidesz – Hungarian Civic Union&quot;.

It was the most successful party in the 2004 European Parliamentary Elections: it won 47.4% of the vote and 12 of its candidates were elected as Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), including Lívia Járóka, the second Romani MEP.

Fidesz&#x27;s nominee, Dr. László Sólyom, was elected President of Hungary in the 2005 election. He was endorsed by Védegylet, an NGO including people from the whole political spectrum. A self-described &quot;conservative liberal,&quot; he championed elements of both political wings with a selective, but conscious choice of values.

In 2005, Fidesz and the Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party (KDNP) formed an alliance for the 2006 elections, which were won by the social-democratic and liberal coalition of Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) and the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ). Fidesz received 42% of the list votes and 164 of 386 representatives in the National Assembly.

On 1 October 2006, Fidesz won the municipal elections, which counterbalanced the MSZP-led government&#x27;s power to some extent. Fidesz won 15 of 23 mayoralties in Hungary&#x27;s largest cities—although its candidate narrowly lost the city of Budapest to a member of the SZDSZ—and majorities in 18 out of 20 regional assemblies.

In the 2009 European Parliament election, Fidesz won a landslide victory, gaining 56.36% of the vote and 14 of Hungary&#x27;s 22 seats.

In a closed-door party meeting in 2009, Orbán called for a &quot;central political forcefield&quot; to govern Hungary for up to 20 years to achieve political stability.

In January 2010, László Kövér, head of the party&#x27;s national board, told reporters the party was aiming at winning a two-thirds majority at the parliamentary elections in April. He noted that Fidesz had a realistic chance to win a landslide. However, this feat was threatened by the rise of the radical nationalist Jobbik party. Kövér said it was a &quot;lamentably negative&quot; tendency, adding that it was rooted in the &quot;disaster government&quot; of the Socialist Party and its former liberal ally Free Democrats.

=== 2010–present: In power ===
The strong and preeminent Fidesz has benefited from the fragmented and disjointed opposition that has proved inept at mounting a unified challenge to the ruling party in a country where a majority of parliamentary seats are allocated to the party that garners the plurality of votes in a constituency.

Government debt has fallen by 6% in the 8 years after Fidesz took power in 2010 while the country&#x27;s credit ratings have improved. Economic growth had almost quadrupled with wages rising by over 10% and destitution decreasing by almost 50% (though still considerable). According to official figures, unemployment had fallen by nearly two-thirds. However, as many as almost half of newly employed Hungarians had found work elsewhere in the EU. A public works program has also been criticized by some economists for artificially and deceptively reducing unemployment numbers while engaging in and compensating people for possibly unneeded or unnecessarily inefficient work. Hungary has been highly dependent on EU funds during Fidesz&#x27;s rule; these representing nearly 4% of the country&#x27;s GDP, more than for any other EU member.

==== 2010–2014: Second Orbán government ====
In a landslide victory in the 2010 parliamentary elections, the party won an outright majority in the first round on 11 April, with the Fidesz-KDNP alliance winning 206 seats, including 119 individual seats. In the final result, Fidesz 263 seats, of which 173 are individual seats. Fidesz held 227 of these seats, giving it an outright majority in the National Assembly by itself.

Fidesz was widely seen as propelled to a sweeping victory in large part due to the dissatisfaction with the ruling political establishment which was plagued by corruption scandals and by the 2007–2008 financial crisis. The socialist government had also imposed harsh austerity measures in an attempt to rein in its ballooning budget deficits even before the late 2000s’ crisis. In September 2006, a recording of the prime minister admitting to lying about the country&#x27;s dire economic prospects was revealed by the media and broadcast on radio. Steel barriers were erected around the parliament to protect it from tens of thousands of protesters.

After winning 53% of the popular vote in the first round of the 2010 parliamentary election, which translated into a supermajority of 68% of parliamentary seats, giving Fidesz sufficient power to revise or replace the constitution, the party embarked on an extraordinary project of passing over 200 laws and drafting and adopting a new constitution—since followed by nearly 2000 amendments.

The new constitution has been widely criticized by the European Commission for Democracy through Law, the Council of Europe, the European Parliament and the United States for concentrating too much power in the hands of the ruling party, for limiting oversight of the new constitution by the Constitutional Court of Hungary, and for removing democratic checks and balances in various areas, including the ordinary judiciary, supervision of elections, and the media.

In October 2013, Thorbjørn Jagland, Secretary General of the Council of Europe said that the council was satisfied with the amendments which had been made to the criticized laws.

==== 2014–2018: Third Orbán government ====
Fidesz won the nationwide parliamentary election in April 2014 and secured a second supermajority with 133 seats (of 199) in the legislature. Observers from The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe stated that Fidesz &quot;enjoyed an undue advantage, including in biased media coverage.”

This supermajority was lost, however, when Tibor Navracsics was appointed to the European Commission. His Veszprém County seat was taken by an independent candidate in a by-election. Another by-election on 12 April 2015 saw the supermajority lose a second seat, also in Veszprém, to a Jobbik candidate.

==== 2018–2022: Fourth Orbán government ====
Fidesz won the nationwide parliamentary election in April 2018 and secured a 3rd supermajority with 133 seats (of 199) in the legislature. Orbán and Fidesz campaigned primarily on the issues of immigration and foreign meddling, and the election was seen as a victory for right-wing populism in Europe.

With the start of 2019, the prime minister&#x27;s residence was relocated from the Hungarian Parliament Building to the Buda Castle, a former Carmelite monastery and former royal residence. The move was first planned in 2002 during the first Fidesz government, but was never carried out. Government representatives stated the move was necessary to uphold the separation of the executive and legislative branch by physically separating the two (in contrast to the Communist era when the two branches operated in the same building) while the opposition criticized the move as profligate (the renovation cost Ft21bn, or €65.5M) and as a symbolic revival of the Horthy era (Miklós Horthy also took up residence in the building).

In 2019 local elections, the party lost its majority in General Assembly of Budapest and numerous city councils.

==== 2022–present: Fifth Orbán government ====
Fidesz won the 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election and secured a supermajority for the fourth time with 135 seats (of 199) in the legislature. &quot;Reuters&quot; described it as a &quot;crushing victory&quot;. With 54.13% of the popular vote, Fidesz received the highest vote share by any party since Hungary returned to democracy in 1989.

In June 2024 it was revealed that Fidesz had become Google&#x27;s biggest advertiser in the whole of the European Union.

==Ideology and policies==

Fidesz&#x27;s position on the political spectrum has changed over time.

===Early years===
At its inception as a student movement in the late 1980s, the party was positioned on the centre-left on the political spectrum, and it advocated for liberalism and libertarianism. It was strongly committed towards anti-clerical and secular policies. As the Hungarian political landscape crystallized following the fall of Communism and the first free elections in 1990, Fidesz moved to the right four years later. Although Fidesz was in opposition to the Hungarian Democratic Forum&#x27;s national-conservative coalition government from 1990 to 1994, Fidesz became the most prominent liberal-conservative political force in Hungary by 1998. It adopted nationalism, national-liberalism, and Christian democracy in the early 2000s. It was positioned on the centre-right, although it moved more to the right as the decade progressed.

===Contemporary===
Fidesz is currently a right-wing party, and it is national conservative while favoring interventionist policies on economic issues like handling of banks, and has a strong conservative stance on social issues, a soft Eurosceptic vision towards European integration, and has been described as right-wing populist. In the late 2010s, the party has increasingly been described as far-right. Its ruling style has also been variously described as &quot;soft fascism&quot;, &quot;soft dictatorship&quot;, and &quot;soft autocracy&quot;. The Fidesz party has denied such accusations and distanced itself from the extreme right, criticizing such accusations as politically motivated opposition to its anti-immigrant policies and pursuit of illiberal democracy.

=== Illiberal democracy ===

Orbán and other Fidesz politicians have prominently described their model of government as a Christian illiberal democracy.

Orbán has described liberal democracy as having undemocratic characteristics because of &quot;being intolerant of alternative views&quot; and being incompatible with and antithetical to Christian democracy (saying: &quot;Christian democracy is, by definition, not liberal: it is, if you like, illiberal.&quot;). Orbán has praised Turkey, Russia, China, and Singapore as successful examples of illiberal states.

=== Economy ===

Like the Hungarian right in general, Fidesz has been more skeptical of the neoliberal economic policies than the Hungarian left. According to researchers, the elites of the Hungarian left (the Hungarian Socialist Party and the former Alliance of Free Democrats) have been differentiated from the right by being more supportive of the classical liberal economic policies, while the right (especially extreme right) has advocated more economic interventionist policies. In contrast, on issues like church and state and family policies, the liberals show alignment along the traditional left–right spectrum. In the past, Fidesz has implemented several economic liberal policies, including an income flat tax, reductions in the corporate tax rate, restrictions on unemployment benefits, and privatization of state-owned land.

The Fidesz government has embraced some government schemes, including &quot;public works job program, pension hikes, utility bill cuts, a minimum wage increase and cash gifts for retirees.&quot; It has also implemented a national public works program aimed in particular at assisting neglected rural communities. It has sought national control of key economic sectors while assuming a cautious stance on economic globalization.

===System of National Cooperation (NER)===

Clientelism plays a central role in Fidesz&#x27;s governance strategy. Fidesz uses European Union and Hungarian state monies to support an extensive network of infrastructure projects, commercial enterprises, nonprofits, academic or para-academic institutions (e.g., Mathias Corvinus Collegium), and religious and cultural institutions—including the established churches like the Catholic and Reformed Churches—both within Hungary and in the diaspora. Fidesz uses this network to attempt to create and preserve an ethnic Hungarian national bourgeoisie or &quot;Establishment&quot; with strong financial, ideological, and familial ties to the party leadership. In return, the party expects these groups&#x27; overt or tacit political support. In Hungary, this governance strategy is (originally pejoratively, but now primarily descriptively) called the System of National Cooperation (, NER).

=== Foreign policy ===

==== NATO intervention in Yugoslavia ====
During the NATO-led bombing of Yugoslavia, Orbán refused the requests of the United States and Great Britain to invade the northernmost territory of Serbia in order to hinder the intervention of Serbian forces in Kosovo. However, he expressed concern about the situation of the Hungarian minority in Serbia and had to cede airspace to NATO forces because Hungary had obtained NATO membership before the war.

==== Invasion of Iraq ====
Fidesz opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq and Hungarian participation in it, questioning the international legitimacy of the invasion.

==== European Union ====
Despite the conflict with the European People&#x27;s Party and European Union (EU) institutions, Fidesz and the Orbán government have claimed to be not in conflict with, but purportedly in line with pan-European values. As he struggled to maintain rapport with the EPP, Orbán began forming a right-wing populist alliance to electorally challenge the conservative EU establishment despite voicing a desire for Fidesz to remain a member. Orbán and his government have clashed with the EU over the handling of the 2014–2016 European migrant crisis and the death penalty, which is prohibited by EU rules.

==== Russia and Ukraine ====
Hungary was the only EU member state to vote against financial aid for Ukraine during its conflict with Russia-sponsored separatists, and has been a vocal critic of EU sanctions against Russia for its actions in Ukraine. The main cause is that since 2017, relations with Ukraine rapidly deteriorated over the issue of the Hungarian minority in Ukraine. Hungary has been obstructing Ukraine&#x27;s integration efforts in the EU and NATO, even though Hungary has also been continuously helping and supporting Ukraine, with an exceptional attention to Transcarpathia. Orbán has strongly criticized EU sanctions against Russia but abstained from vetoing them. The Fidesz government joined the UK-led diplomatic offensive after the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, expelling Russian embassy officials. Orbán has hailed Russia as an exemplary case of illiberal democracy.

During his presidency, Orbán has been described as drawing closer to Russian president Vladimir Putin. The closer relationship between the two leaders and nations has however largely been motivated by a tighter economic relationship, part of the government&#x27;s &quot;Eastern Opening&quot; strategy, announced in 2011.

The Fourth Orbán Government initially strongly condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine, aligning the country with NATO and the European Union on the matter: Orbán announced that Hungary would be sending humanitarian aid to Ukraine, but declined to send military equipment. President János Áder (also a Fidesz member) strongly condemned the Russian invasion, comparing it to the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary. However, Fidesz soon realigned with its formerly pro-Russian position: the party repeatedly opposed sanctions against the Russian Federation, prompting international press to describe Orbán as &quot;a key Putin&#x27;s ally&quot;. Orbán has called for Russia and the United States to negotiate a diplomatic resolution to the conflict, stating that the Ukrainians could not win the war militarily.

===Immigration===
Fidesz adopted anti-immigration stances and rhetoric in the mid-2010s in the context of the European migrant crisis. However, starting in the early 2020s, the Orbán government began admitting increasing numbers of foreign guest workers into Hungary due to a labor shortage resulting from strong economic growth, native population decline, and rising wages.

===Nativism===
Fidesz is opposed to multiculturalism. In a 2018 address, Orbán said: &quot;We must state that we do not want to be diverse and do not want to be mixed: we do not want our own color, traditions and national culture to be mixed with those of others. We do not want this. We do not want that at all. We do not want to be a diverse country.&quot; Orbán has &quot;often expressed a preference for a racially homogeneous society.&quot; The government has modified the country&#x27;s Constitution to make it illegal to &quot;settle foreign populations in Hungary.&quot;

Despite a very low fertility rate that has led to a demographic deficit, the Fidesz government has remained steadfastly opposed to economic immigration that has been harnessed by other European countries to relieve its worker deficits. Instead, the government announced pecuniary incentives (including eliminating taxes for mothers with more than 3 children, and reducing credit payments and easier access to government-subsidized mortgages), and expanding day care and kindergarten access. The Fidesz government&#x27;s child incentive program also offers a 10-million-forint government-subsidized zero-interest loan to married couples who are willing to have a baby after 1 July 2019.

=== Social policy ===
Changes passed by the Fidesz government have given citizens the right to use arms for self-defense on one&#x27;s own property. Fidesz has passed legislation criminalising homelessness. Fidesz has opposed proposals supported by Jobbik and LMP to require nightclubs in Budapest to close after midnight.

==== Christianity ====
Orbán has on multiple occasions emphasized upholding Christian values as central to his government, and has described his government as creating a Christian democracy. Hungarian Catholic bishop András Veres described some of Fidesz&#x27; policies, such as providing free IVF treatment for couples at state-run clinics, as being at odds with some Christian denominations, particularly the Roman Catholic Church, which opposes IVF. Orbán is a member of the Reformed Church in Hungary. However, the party has been described as taking a more secular position on abortion, the role of the church and education than its ally, the Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party.

==== Family policy ====
Fidesz is opposed to an abortion ban, instead preferring to promote natalism. However, the Fidesz government has introduced a requirement for women seeking abortions to listen to a pulse generated by the ultrasound monitor before making their decision.

The Fidesz government has introduced loan subsidies for married couples that have three or more children and a personal income tax exemption for women that have four or more children.

=== Other ===
==== Anti-communism ====
The party is anti-communist. In May 2018, the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker attended and spoke at a celebration of the deceased Karl Marx&#x27;s 200th birthday, where he defended Marx&#x27;s legacy. In response, MEPs from Fidesz wrote: &quot;Marxist ideology led to the death of tens of millions and ruined the lives of hundreds of millions. The celebration of its founder is a mockery of their memory.&quot;

The Fidesz government spokesman Zoltán Kovács justified the government&#x27;s controversial policies as an effort to &quot;get rid of the remnants of communism that are still with us, not only in terms of institutions but in terms of mentality.&quot;

During the party&#x27;s rule, statues of communists regarded as traitors have been removed with Fidesz politicians in attendance. In December 2018, Hungarian authorities removed a statue of Imre Nagy for renovation. Nagy was a Hungarian reformist communist politician who led the failed anti-Soviet 1956 Hungarian Revolution and was later executed for his role in the uprising; the statue was replaced with a memorial dedicated to the victims of the short-lived 1919 Hungarian Soviet Republic.

==== Poster campaigns and National Consultations ====
In addition to regular political advertising, Fidesz directs government organs to use taxpayer money to regularly produce and disseminate two major forms of political propaganda in Hungary: poster campaigns and so-called &quot;National Consultations.&quot; These two techniques are meant to influence public opinion about controversial issues outside of the legally demarcated campaign season.

Past poster campaign subjects have included a grinning George Soros while calling on the citizens to oppose his purported support of illegal immigration (many of the posters portraying Soros, who is Jewish, were defaced with antisemitic graffiti); Soros and President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker laughing together, with text suggesting Soros controls major European institutions (while also disseminating the accusation by letters sent to all Hungarian citizens); and the &quot;distracted boyfriend&quot; internet meme, retooled to promote family values. These &quot;information campaigns&quot; or &quot;national messaging initiatives,&quot; as successive Fidesz governments have called them, have been allocated annual budgets in the tens of millions of euros.

National Consultations, meanwhile, are questionnaires sent to all citizens that survey their opinions on government policy and legislation. By posing loaded questions, Fidesz uses these questionnaires to disseminate Fidesz&#x27;s ideological positions and agenda. A 2015 Consultation, for example, explicitly referred to a &quot;Soros plan&quot; to &quot;convince Brussels to resettle at least one million immigrants from Africa and the Middle East annually on the territory of the European Union, including Hungary,&quot; wrote that this &quot;is part of the Soros plan to launch political attacks on countries objecting to immigration and impose strict penalties on them,&quot; and then asked citizens whether they agree. Another questionnaire about family policy used the term &quot;Brussels bureaucrats.&quot; On other occasions, such as just prior to elections, the government sent letters notifying citizens that it will reduce their gas payments by €38 and sent pensioners gift vouchers.

== Organization ==

=== Leaders ===
=== Youth wing ===
The Fidesz youth affiliate Fidelitas was founded in 1996. In December 2022, Dániel Farkas was elected president, succeeding Boglárka Illés. Fidelitas is a member of European Democrat Students (EDS) and the International Young Democracy Union.

== International affiliations ==
Fidesz was a member of the Liberal International from 1992 to 2000. From 2000 to 2024, it was a member of the International Democracy Union. It is currently a member of Centrist Democrat International.

European Union

Following its ideological turn to conservatism, it joined the centre-right European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) but was suspended on 20 March 2019. Fidesz MEPs left the European People&#x27;s Party group in the European Parliament on 3 March 2021, after the EPP changed its rules to allow it to expel a party&#x27;s entire delegation. It has served with the Non-Inscrits since then.

In July 2021, Fidesz signed a joint declaration with National Rally, Law and Justice, Vox, the League, the Brothers of Italy, the Estonian Conservative People&#x27;s Party, the Freedom Party of Austria, Belgium&#x27;s Vlaams Belang, the Danish People&#x27;s Party, the Finns Party, VMRO – Bulgarian National Movement, Greek Solution, the Romanian Christian Democratic National Peasants&#x27; Party and Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania – Christian Families Alliance on the future of the EU.

In December 2021, the party participated in the Warsaw summit with Law and Justice, the Estonian Conservative People&#x27;s Party, the Finns Party, the Christian Democratic National Peasants&#x27; Party, Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania – Christian Families Alliance, the Freedom Party of Austria, Vox, National Rally, Vlaams Belang and the Dutch JA21, signing a document outlining new collaboration at the EU level between the parties.
In January 2022, the party participated in the Madrid summit, hosted by Vox, alongside National Rally, Law and Justice, Vlaams Belang, JA21, the Estonian Conservative People&#x27;s Party, the Freedom Party of Austria, VMRO - Bulgarian National Movement, the Christian Democratic National Peasants&#x27; Party and Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania – Christian Families Alliance, signing a joint declaration on policies towards the EU and Russia.

In November 2022, Fidesz MEPs signed a cooperation agreement with MEPs from Sovereign Poland, Vox, Lega, the Freedom Party of Austria and the National Rally to collaborate within the European Parliament.
In June 2024, Fidesz announced its intention to form the Patriots for Europe parliamentary group in the European Parliament, which subsequently included the Czech ANO 2011, Motorists for Themselves and Přísaha, the Freedom Party of Austria, the Portuguese Chega, the Dutch Party for Freedom, the French National Rally, the Italian Lega, the Danish People&#x27;s Party, the Belgian Vlaams Belang, the Spanish Vox, Latvia First and the Greek Voice of Reason. 

In September 2024, Fidesz joined the pan-European political party Patriots.eu, which includes the members of the Patriots for Europe group and the Estonian Conservative People&#x27;s Party.

European countries

;Austria

Orbán has more recently cultivated close ties between Fidesz and the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ), noting &quot;strategic cooperation&quot; between the parties and &quot;friendly ties based on mutual confidence and Christian-conservative values&quot;.

Prior to the 2019 Austrian legislative election, he held a joint press conference with FPÖ leader Norbert Hofer, where he wished the party success in the upcoming election and stressed the &quot;similar views&quot; of the two parties.

;Belgium

Hungarian Justice Minister Judit Varga addressed a rally in Antwerp hosted by Vlaams Belang in June 2022, alongside representatives of other Identity and Democracy Party member parties.

;Bosnia
Orbán released a video message endorsing Milorad Dodik, the leader of the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) and the President of Republika Srpska, ahead of the 2022 Bosnian general election. Orbán&#x27;s government has reportedly provided political and financial support to the SNSD.

;Czech Republic

Orbán sent a letter of support to Václav Klaus Jr.&#x27;s newly formed Tricolour Citizens&#x27; Movement in the Czech Republic in 2019. Orbán has a relationship with Klaus&#x27;s father, President Václav Klaus, who has expressed support for Orbán&#x27;s rule.

During the 2021 Czech parliamentary election, Orbán endorsed Czech Prime Minister and ANO 2011 leader Andrej Babiš, appearing alongside him at campaign events in the Czech Republic.

;Croatia

Orbán expressed strong support for Tomislav Karamarko&#x27;s leadership of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), having written a letter endorsing Karamarko for his stance on immigration that was read out at an HDZ rally during the 2015 Croatian parliamentary election campaign.

Fidesz later established contacts with the International Secretary of the Homeland Movement, Stephen Nikola Bartulica.

;France

Orbán initially rejected association with Marine Le Pen&#x27;s National Rally, and instead endorsed François Fillon, the candidate of The Republicans, in the 2017 French presidential election.

However, in 2021, Fidesz opened relations with National Rally, congratulating Le Pen on her re-election as the party&#x27;s leader. Orbán subsequently hosted Le Pen during her October 2021 visit to Budapest and had discussions with her regarding a formal alliance between the parties. Orbán released a video of support for Le Pen during the 2022 French presidential election, which was aired at one of her campaign rallies.

Orbán also has relations with Reconquête leader Éric Zemmour, hosting him in Budapest in September 2021.

;Germany

Fidesz initially rejected cooperation with Alternative for Germany (AfD), describing the Christian Democratic Union of Germany and the Christian Social Union in Bavaria as its natural allies there. 

However, in February 2025, Orbán invited AfD co-leader Alice Weidel to meet with him in Budapest. After the meeting, Orbán stated that with the rise in AfD&#x27;s support, the German government could no longer penalise cooperation with it, and expressed his belief that &quot;the AfD is the future&quot;.

;Italy

Orbán has praised the tenure of former Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, the leader of the League, declaring him an &quot;ally and our fellow combatant in the fight for the preservation of European Christian heritage and the tackling of migration&quot; after Salvini&#x27;s departure from the Italian government in August 2019.

Orbán previously urged closer political ties between the EPP and the League, and cooperated extensively on immigration with Salvini, describing Salvini as &quot;my hero&quot;.

Orbán has also fostered ties with Brothers of Italy leader Giorgia Meloni, but Meloni later blocked Fidesz joining the European Conservatives and Reformists.

;North Macedonia

Orbán has also fostered close political ties with right-wing Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization – Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity (VMRO-DPMNE) politician and former PM Nikola Gruevski. While awaiting a ruling on an appeal to a corruption conviction in early 2019, Gruevski fled to Hungary to evade a looming jail sentence. The whereabouts of Gruevski were revealed only 4 days after he failed to report to serve his prison sentence. Macedonian officials have suggested that Gruevski (for whom an international arrest warrant had been issued) was in contact with Hungarian officials in the days preceding his flight, and Macedonian authorities have launched an investigation into whether Gruevski was transported across the border in a Hungarian diplomatic vehicle. The Hungarian government denied accusations of impropriety.

Hungarian businesspeople close to Orbán that had previously invested into Slovenian right-wing media also entered into ownership of Macedonian right-wing media companies, propping up outlets friendly to Gruevski and his party. In May 2023, Orbán pledged that Fidesz would assist VMRO-DPMNE in &quot;various policy areas&quot; ahead of the 2024 Macedonian parliamentary election.

;Poland

Prior to the 2019 European Parliament election, Fidesz announced it would discuss an alliance with Poland&#x27;s Law and Justice (PiS) party if it leaves the EPP. The two nations&#x27; conservative governments have shared a close friendship and alliance for multiple years and the Polish government has pledged political support for Hungary within the EU.

Orbán and PiS leader Jarosław Kaczyński have vowed to wage a &quot;cultural counter-revolution&quot; within the EU together, with the Polish government seeing Hungary under Fidesz as a model for Poland.

The relationship between Fidesz and PiS deteriorated following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, after the two parties took different stances on the conflict. The relationship was later repaired after PiS lost power in Poland, with Mateusz Morawiecki inviting Fidesz to join the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group in the European Parliament in February 2024.

Although PiS initially negotiated with Fidesz&#x27;s Patriots for Europe group in June 2024, it later chose to remain in the ECR after disagreements over the ECR leadership were resolved. The Fidesz government also granted asylum to former PiS Deputy Minister of Justice Marcin Romanowski in December 2024.

Fidesz also developed ties with PiS&#x27;s former junior coalition partner, Zbigniew Ziobro&#x27;s Sovereign Poland party, particularly during the time period when relations with PiS were tense.

;Serbia

Orbán has a warm relationship with Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić and his Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), with the Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó campaigning for Vučić before the 2017 Serbian presidential election. Companies close to the Orbán government have won public contracts with the Serbian government. The Serbian government has also been accused of taking a similar approach to the Hungarian government towards the media.

In May 2023, Szijjártó once again addressed an SNS rally in support of President Vučić, ahead of the 2023 Serbian parliamentary election. Fidesz has also participated in conferences hosted by one of the SNS&#x27;s junior coalition partners, the Serbian People&#x27;s Party (SNP), and included the SNP in a working lunch of Fidesz-allied right-wing parties hosted by Orbán.

;Slovenia

Orbán has allied closely with Slovenian PM Janez Janša and the right-wing Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) he heads, going so far as to campaign for SDS during the 2018 Slovenian parliamentary election. Businesspeople close to Orbán also provided funds to SDS-affiliated media companies that then also used some of the funds to purchase campaign ads on behalf of SDS to circumvent Slovenian campaign finance laws.

After the election, and while SDS was struggling to secure political support to form a coalition government, Janša again met with Orbán on a private visit to Budapest; during the meeting, Orbán also conducted a conference call with former US president Donald Trump with Janša joining in. SDS&#x27;s unconditional backing of Fidesz within the EPP was reportedly pivotal in preventing Fidesz&#x27;s expulsion from EPP, resulting in a more lenient suspension. In a letter to EPP leader, Janša warned of an &quot;inevitable&quot; split in the EPP if the vote to expel Fidesz were to take place.

Despite its close links, in 2024 when Orbán formed the Patriots for Europe, a new EU political group. The SDS, which has four MEPs, ultimately remained part of the EPP Group, while noting that not all SDS MEPs agreed with this decision.
;Slovakia
Fidesz provided campaign advisers to Robert Fico&#x27;s Smer party ahead of the 2023 Slovak parliamentary election. Prior to the election, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó held a joint press conference with Fico. However, Smer declined to join Fidesz&#x27;s Patriots for Europe group in 2024, citing an ideological divide with the right-wing parties involved. In November 2024, Orbán gave a video address to a Smer party conference.

In 2020, Hungarian officials from the Fidesz government suggested it was in their interest that the Slovak National Party win seats during the 2020 Slovak parliamentary election. Szijjárto also praised the Slovak National Party following a 2022 meeting with its leader, Andrej Danko, stating that &quot;parties standing on national foundations always understand each other well&quot; and emphasising their shared &quot;Christian-conservative values&quot;.

Danko has close relations with Fidesz politicians, and has advocated for an alliance between the Slovak National Party, Smer, Hlas, Slovak PATRIOT and even Hungarian minority parties in order to form what he described as a &quot;Slovak Fidesz&quot;.

;Other

Orbán has also developed ties with Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) leader Geert Wilders, Vox leader Santiago Abascal, Conservative People&#x27;s Party of Estonia leader Mart Helme the Chega leader André Ventura, and Lithuanian National Alliance leader Vytautas Radžvilas.

As of 2024, the Finns Party rejects cooperation with Fidesz, strongly supporting the exclusion of Fidesz from the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group in the European Parliament. The Sweden Democrats initially ruled out cooperation with Fidesz altogether, but later insisted that Fidesz sign a declaration in support of Ukrainian territorial integrity prior to allowing formal cooperation.

Fidesz refuses cooperation with the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), describing it as &quot;anti-Hungarian&quot; and ceasing its attempts to join the ECR after AUR was admitted.

;Hungarian national minority parties

Some political parties of Hungarian minorities are said to be allies of the Fidesz like the Slovak Hungarian Alliance (MKP), the Serbian Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians (VMSZ), the Ukrainian KMKSZ – Hungarian Party in Ukraine, and Hungarian Democratic Party in Ukraine (UMDP), Democratic Union of Hungarians of Croatia (HMDK), the Slovenian Hungarian National Self-Government Association of Prekmurje (MMNÖK), the Romanian Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (RMDSZ), the Hungarian Civic Party (MPP) and the Hungarian People&#x27;s Party of Transylvania (EMNP). The Fidesz, the RMDSZ, MKP, VMSZ the HMDK and the Democratic Party of Vojvodina Hungarians (VMDP) support each other in the 2019 European Parliament election. The MKP, VMSZ and RMDSZ are members or associates of the EPP.

Non-European countries

Israel

Orbán and his government have also fostered close ties with the Israeli Likud government under Benjamin Netanyahu, with the two heads of government forging a cordial relationship, having known one another for decades. Netanyahu advised Orbán on economic reforms conducted by the Hungarian government in the early 2000s. Netanyahu later extended public political support to Orbán at a time when Orbán was confronting criticism for praising Miklós Horthy, Hungary&#x27;s former leader, whose government passed anti-Jewish legislation and collaborated with Nazi Germany, and for allegedly employing anti-Semitic tropes in his criticism of George Soros. The Israeli foreign ministry issued a statement condemning Soros in a show of solidarity with the Orbán government. A Likud lawmaker also introduced legislation modeled on Fidesz&#x27;s &quot;Stop Soros law&quot; in the Israeli Knesset.

United States of America

Orbán and his government have gained favor with US president Donald Trump and his Republican administration (in stark contrast to the policy of isolation practiced by the preceding Obama Administration). Orbán was the first European head of government to endorse Trump&#x27;s presidential bid during the 2016 United States presidential election.

Trump has praised Hungary&#x27;s immigration policies in a discussion with Orbán. The more amiable attitude of the Trump Administration toward the Hungarian government prompted criticism and a protest by 22 Democratic Party lawmakers that called for a more disciplinary policy towards the country&#x27;s government over what they perceived as a problematic track record.

Steve Bannon, former head of &quot;Breitbart News&quot; and a former close associate of President Trump who had an integral role in Trump&#x27;s electoral campaign and administration, has also praised Orbán and announced plans to work with Fidesz in orchestrating the party&#x27;s electoral campaign for the 2019 European parliament election.

Other

The Fidesz government had a strong relationship with former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro of the Liberal Party, including sheltering him at the Hungarian Embassy in Brazil after he faced criminal charges. Fidesz also has ties with the founder of the Chilean Republican Party, José Antonio Kast, María Fernanda Cabal of the Colombian Democratic Center party, and the Argentinian La Libertad Avanza.

Orbán&#x27;s Political Director, Balázs Orbán, suggested Fidesz has &quot;many things in common&quot; with the Indian Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) following meetings with BJP politicians, including sovereignty, opposing progressivism, and support for peace in the Russo-Ukrainian War.

== Criticism ==

Fidesz has been accused of exhibiting anti-democratic and authoritarian tendencies while in government. The Fidesz-led government has been accused of severely restricting media freedom, undermining the independence of the courts, subjugating and politicising independent and non-governmental institutions, spying on political opponents, engaging in electoral engineering, and assailing critical NGOs. The Fidesz-led government has been accused of engaging in cronyism and corruption. Fidesz has been accused of antisemitism, and the Fidesz-led government has been accused of passing legislation that violates the rights of queer persons. Due to its controversial actions, Fidesz and its government have come in conflict with the EU on multiple occasions.

<text>Intercrural sex, which is also known as coitus interfemoris, thigh sex, thighing, thighjob and interfemoral sex, is a type of non-penetrative sex in which the penis is placed between the receiving partner&#x27;s thighs and friction is generated via thrusting. It was a common practice in ancient Greek society prior to the early centuries AD, and was frequently discussed by writers and portrayed in artwork such as vases. It later became subject to sodomy laws and became increasingly seen as contemptible. In the 17th century, intercrural sex was featured in several works of literature and it took cultural prominence, being seen as a part of male-on-male sexual habits following the trial and execution of Mervyn Tuchet, 2nd Earl of Castlehaven, in 1631.

In modern times, intercrural sex is commonly practiced in relationships of various orientations; adult women are said to use it to stimulate orgasm and in Paris, it was commonly performed as a part of prostitution. In parts of Africa and Asia, the practice is normalised and is carried out among heterosexual and homosexual males. In South Africa, it was used to combat acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); this practice was eventually phased out.

Knowledge of intercrural sex that was extracted from studies and its relationship to AIDS and pregnancy is low. It has been reported as a means of safe sex for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients and has a lower risk of infection than peno-vaginal sex. Studies have found a fluctuating percentage of sexual assault cases have involved intercrural rape, with little to no physical evidence.

== Etymology ==
Kenneth Dover first introduced the term &quot;intercrural sex&quot; in his 1978 book &quot;Greek Homosexuality&quot;. Dover used the term to refer to sexual activity between an older man and a young boy. The Ancient Greek term for this practice was &quot;&quot; (&quot;to do [something] between the thighs&quot;). &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; defines intercrural sex as an act in which one partner &quot;plac[es his] penis ... between the other partner&#x27;s [closed] thighs ... [and thrusts] to create friction&quot;. Synonyms include coitus interfemoris, thigh sex and interfemoral sex.

Kang Tchou of Cambridge University notes Dover&#x27;s definition is similar to the idea of &quot;heavenly love&quot; articulated by Pausanias that &quot;encourages a stable life-long relationship between the boy and the man and enhances the intellectual development of the younger boy&quot;.

==History and modern practice ==

=== Ancient history and the Middle Ages ===

Intercrural intercourse was a common manifestation of pederasty in ancient Greece; young men were forbidden from having sex with older men in a manner beyond intercrural. It has been associated with &quot;Eromenos,&quot; although its prominence in such a relationship is undetermined and anal sex may have been more common. Intercrural sex was not exclusively executed by homosexual men; by the early-AD era, it fell out of practice as sex with women became more encouraged in Greek society.

Intercrural sex has been depicted on artworks such as vases, where they were called &quot;courting scenes&quot;, and was much discussed by writers. After the 5th century BC, visual depictions of it were sparse and almost exclusively found on black-figure pottery. Zeno of Citium and Aristophanes have been said to reference the act; the latter was the first to document intercrural sex being practiced in a heterosexual capacity. Aeschylus&#x27; play &quot;Myrmidons&quot; features the implication of adult men engaging in the act. Joan Roughgarden refers to intercrural intercourse as the &quot;gay male missionary position&quot; of Ancient Greece.

Historical sodomy laws have included intercrural intercourse within their purview. In 15th-century Italy, it was a part of sodomy&#x27;s infamous reputation; in renaissance Venice, capital punishment was considered against the partner initiating intercrural sex. Medieval penitentials often highlighted intercrural sex as sinful and gave instructions on ways to repent; early Christianity regarded intercrural intercourse as &quot;more respectable&quot; than anal sex. Islamic jurisprudents considered intercrural sex &quot;reprehensible,&quot; although its lesser status led to practitioners avoiding harsh punishments.

=== Modern history ===

In early modern English, writers referred to intercrural sex as &quot;rubbing&quot; or &quot;frigging&quot;. Literary works and satire depicted intercrural sex, possibly encouraging people to perform the act. Cases of sodomy, such as the trial of Mervyn Tuchet in 1631 that resulted in his execution, occasionally mentioned intercrural sex. Tuchet&#x27;s case took on significant cultural prominence and informed many people of gay male sexual habits, likely conjuring a cultural perception of intercrural sex as the main method of sex between men.

From 1660, intercrural intercourse was increasingly mentioned in literature. Richard Ellmann believed Oscar Wilde solely performed intercrural sex in the hope he could consequently declare his innocence against the allegation of &quot;posing as a sodomite&quot;. In 1885, the UK Parliament passed a statute penalizing &quot;gross indecency&quot; between men under the Labouchere Amendment; intercrural sex was within the law&#x27;s remit because it fell short of sodomy.
In both the Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany, intercrural sex between men was an indictable offense, although German South West African law did not see it punishable under sodomy. Female prostitutes in 18th-century Paris commonly performed intercrural sex, which was second only to vaginal intercourse. Malawians and Mozambiquean men practiced it in mines, as did South African men in &quot;mine marriages&quot;. Before European colonization, Azande warriors would only have intercrural sex with their young partners; it was a popular form of eroticism in pre-colonial Asia.

In Zulu intercrural sex is referred to as &quot;okusoma&quot;. It has a long history as an accepted practice for young people in southern Africa and was often practiced to prevent population growth. Traditional Zulu culture encouraged youth to engage in intercrural sex as a part of sexual socialisation—intercrural sex as practiced by young unmarried couples was also supported. A 1989 report regarding the city of Durban stated that in South Africa:

== Statistics ==

=== Sexual assault ===

Hickson &quot;et al.&quot;. (1994) found intercrural sex took place in five of 219 cases of male sexual assault reviewed in England and Wales. In 2014 in Sri Lanka, 270 instances of sexual assault were medically examined; 18 occurrences of intercrural intercourse were reported. No physical injuries to the victims occurred. These assaults reportedly occurred when the victim was between the age of 4 and 19 years. A more specific earlier study of boys between the ages of 14 and 19 living in Colombo District found intercrural sex to be the second-most common form of abuse before oral sex, as reported by the victims; 20 of the 52 reported cases consisted of intercrural sex.

A 1957 analysis of 148 sexual offenders in the United States who assaulted children under the age of 14 found that 6 percent committed their offences by means of intercrural intercourse. Another study, two decades later, observed &quot;intercrural ejaculation&quot; as a &quot;common way of sexual expression in paedophiles&quot;. In cases of child sexual abuse, there are usually no physical signs of intercrural intercourse.

=== Education ===

Ripley &quot;et al.&quot;. (1973), demonstrated only 3 out of every 10 boys and 4 of every 10 girls in the 14-year-old age group surveyed thought intercrural intercourse could not result in pregnancy – according to Ripley &quot;et al.&quot;. (1973), intercrural sex is not a recommended method of contraception. In Nigeria, 13 of 298 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive respondents said the disease could be transmitted through intercrural sex while a further 30 said &quot;no&quot; and the remaining 255 responded with uncertainty. Intercrural sex has been reported as a safe means of sex that prevents transmission of HIV and is &quot;lower-risk&quot; than peno-vaginal sex. Epprecht (2019) said that as mine marriages involved intercrural sex &quot;there was no danger of sexually transmitted infection&quot;. Mistry &amp; Jha (2015) wrote in regards to pregnancy; &quot;Because there is no anal or vaginal penetration, [intercrural sex] is regarded as a safe sexual practice&quot;.

In South Africa, intercrural sex has been seen as a method of preventing the transmission of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). From a 1997 study, 12.5 percent of girls who were asked how to avoid acquiring AIDS responded by suggesting intercrural sex. It was once the most common form of contraception for rural adults in South Africa. By 2012, Mary van der Riet of KwaZulu-Natal University noted; &quot;The shift from intercrural sex to the use of the injectable contraceptive set up particular conditions for condom use in response to HIV and AIDS&quot;.

=== Demographics ===
Shere Hite&#x27;s 1976 and 1981 research on female sexuality found some adult women reported being able to achieve orgasm via intercrural contact to stimulate the clitoris. Intercrural sex is popular in Sri Lanka; in a 2006 study, 4.2 percent of women reported having engaged in it while 20.7 percent of men said they had had homosexual intercrural sex. A 1997 report on the sexual health needs of males who have sex with males in the Calcutta suburbs found 73 percent of men they asked engaged in intercrural sex, though the frequency varied based on demographic factors. Only 54 percent of sex workers, 50 percent of lower-income men and 40 percent of Muslims reported having had intercrural sex while 82 percent of Hindus and 88 percent of middle-income men reported engaging in it.

<text>The Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland (, SRP) is a Christian socialist, populist, agrarian, and nationalist political party and trade union in Poland. The party promotes agrarian socialist and Catholic socialist economic policies combined with a left-wing populist, anti-globalization and anti-neoliberal rhetoric. The party describes itself as left-wing, although it stresses that it belongs to the &quot;patriotic left&quot; and follows Catholic social teaching. The party is sympathetic to Communist Poland, which led political scientists to label the party as neocommunist, post-communist, and far-left.

Though considered a &quot;political chameleon&quot;, Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland is generally regarded as a left-wing party by historians and political scientists. According to Andrzej Antoszewski, Self-Defence was a radical left-wing party that by postulating the need to stop privatisation and protect workers&#x27; interests, often overlapped with neo-communist parties. In English-language literature, the party is described as a radical left-populist party. In the wake of the SLD&#x27;s electoral defeat in 2005, Self-Defence was sometimes referred to as the &quot;new left&quot;. It was also called a left-wing party with a populist-agrarian face. Political scientists also described it as socialist, allowing it to form alliances with the Democratic Left Alliance. On the other hand, its anti-neoliberal and nationalist narrative also allowed it to briefly cooperate with PiS and LPR in 2005.

Founded by Andrzej Lepper in 1992, the party initially fared poorly, failing to enter the Sejm. However, it was catapulted to prominence in the 2001 parliamentary election, winning 53 seats, after which it gave confidence and supply to the Democratic Left Alliance government. It elected six MEPs at the 2004 European election, with five joining the Union for Europe of the Nations and one joining the PES Group.

It switched its support to Law and Justice (PiS) after the 2005 election, in which it won 56 seats in the Sejm and three in the Senate. Lepper was appointed Deputy Prime Minister in the coalition government with PiS and the League of Polish Families. In 2007, he was dismissed from his position and the party withdrew from the coalition. This precipitated a new election, at which the party collapsed to just 1.5% of the vote: losing all its seats. On August 5, 2011, the Party&#x27;s leader, Andrzej Lepper, was found dead in his party&#x27;s office in Warsaw. His death was ruled a suicide by hanging.

==History==
===Beginnings===
The origins of Samoobrona date back to a spontaneous protest movement of farmers from Western Pomerania (the Darlowo area is the hometown of A. Lepper) and the Zamojszczyzna region, which developed into a trade union. The very creation of the political party was originally aimed solely at supporting the &#x27;Samoobrona&#x27; Trade Union of Agriculture (ZZR &#x27;Samoobrona&#x27;), which had played a leading role for a long time. Samoobrona as a movement had communist origins, and it originally was a peasant movement associated with the Polish People&#x27;s Party, which back then was an agrarian socialist party associated with the fallen communist regime, and was considered one of the post-communist successor parties based on the nostalgia for the previous, socialist regime.

As Lepper reported many years later. Lepper, the idea to create a trade union, and then a political movement, was born after a meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Leszek Balcerowicz in the autumn of 1991: &quot;Everything that happened afterwards - with me and Samoobrona - I therefore owe, to some extent, to that two hours long conversation of 10 years ago&quot;. In January 1992, the Trade Union of Agriculture &quot;Samoobrona&quot; was registered. The political party, which initially appeared under the name Przymierze &quot;Samoobrona&quot;, was registered on 12 June 1992. In addition to representatives of ZZR &quot;Samoobrona&quot;, it also included activists from the Metalworkers&#x27; Trade Union and a Green faction headed by J. Bryczkowski. In its first political declaration, Samoobrona described itself as a &quot;radical&quot; party that represents the interests of the economically disadvantaged and those living in poverty.

The beginnings of party&#x27;s activities date to Lepper&#x27;s home village Darłowo, which has been plunged into poverty between 1989 and 1991 as a result of the neoliberal Balcerowicz Plan, which dismantled the socialist economy in Poland in favor of a capitalist free-market one. As the state sector of agricultures was dismantled and privatized, rural areas experienced an extreme spike of unemployment, poverty and social exclusion. Unfavourable prices of agricultural products on the market further aggravated the situation - between 1990 and 1991, agricultural prices increased threefold while industrial prices increased tenfold, drastically diminishing the purchasing power of Polish agriculture. This was combined with a huge decrease in farmers&#x27; real income. In Lepper&#x27;s region, the situation became particularly critical as a result of heavy rainfall, which caused local flooding.

On 18 January 1991, the first rally was organised in Darłowo, attended by local farmers and the unemployed, including Andrzej Lepper. During the rally, protesters formed the Self-Defence of the Unemployed Homeless Association of the Pomeranian Region Darłowo (). Samoobrona itself was then founded on 27 July 1991 as a trade union Protest Committee of Self-Defence of Farmers (), with Lepper being elected as its leader. First protest initiated by Lepper then took place on 5 August 1991, which demanded that the state of natural disaster be declared in Darłowo, along with demanding special aid and compensation to affected farmers. Lepper also made an appeal to the local voivode that the government temporarily suspends the enforcement of unpaid debts on local citizens. His plea was ignored.

In front of the Darlowo town hall on 24 September, farmers put up unpaid agricultural equipment, having fallen into a spiral of debt due to the introduction of variable interest rates as part of the implementation of Balcerowicz&#x27;s reform plan. Striking farmers announced the formation of the Farmers&#x27; Self-Defence Committee (). The blockade of Darłowo with agricultural machinery attracted press attention, and over a period of two months, the communal protest committee evolved into the &quot;Provincial Self-Defence Committee&quot; () of farmers in Koszalin with its headquarters in Darłowo. The farmers&#x27; protests were then supported by the Polish People&#x27;s Party and the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union &quot;Solidarity&quot; of Individual Farmers (. On 18 October 1991, A. Lepper headed the Farmers&#x27; Defence Committee established in Warsaw, which coordinated the protest of trade unionists in front of the Sejm building. The subsequent speeches were increasingly radical in nature; they were supported by a militant organisation created by the farmers called the Peasant Guard and groups of radical subcultural youth. On 14 November, an agreement was concluded between the protesters and the government, which provided for the suspension of bailiffs&#x27; executions threatening farmers and the establishment of a special Fund and the Restructuring and Debt Relief of Agriculture.

During the intense protests, Lepper made the first attempt in his political activity to participate in electoral competition. The electoral law for the Sejm and Senate, in force in 1991, allowed committees to register in only one electoral district, thus leading to an extreme fragmentation of the party system. However, the run in the 1991 Polish parliamentary election was unsuccessful - something that Lepper attributed to lack of his direct participation in the campaign. The list of the Provincial Farmers&#x27; Self-Defence Committee () opened by the party&#x27;s leader received only 3,247 votes in constituency number 21, covering the then Koszalin and Słupsk voivodeships. Registered in only one of 37 constituencies, the 3,247 votes won by the committee amounted to 0.03% of the nationwide popular vote. With Lepper being on top of the electoral list, other two candidates of the committee were Leszek Siudek and Józef Kołodziej. Lepper presented his committee as &quot;farmers&#x27; social movement emerged on the basis of farmers&#x27; disconent&quot;. Already in the program of the committee, Lepper appealed to populist policies and ideologies that would then shape Samoobrona - the tradition of the interwar peasant movement, Catholic social teaching, nationalism, and &quot;real socialism&quot; (the socialism of Polish People&#x27;s Republic). While unsuccessful, the electoral run spread the message of Samoobrona to a wider audience, and it was soon able to form associations with farmer movements across Poland.

Three months later, the second wave of farmer protests then emerged, with greater intensity than the protests of 1991. Already functioning as the National Council of the Trade Union &quot;Self-Defense&quot;, Samoobrona delivered a new ultimatum to the government in early 1992, including the clearing of farm debts and a program of &quot;cheap&quot; credit for farmers, with cheap defined as credits with an interest rate below the inflation level, which amounted to 40% in 1992. After the demands were ignored, Samoobrona was joined in with other trade unions and farmer associations in aummer 1992, organizing nationwide farmer protests that soon turned radical and even violent, earning Samoobrona its reputation as a radical formation. Samoobrona then started defining its ideological character, stating the need for farmers to stand against &quot;the dictatorship of the International Monetary Fund&quot; and arguing: &quot;Under communism, the Soviets ordered us Poles what to do, and now this dictatorship position has been taken over by international capitalism.&quot; Samoobrona extended its debt clearance demands to non-agricultural parts of the economy, and on 10 July, the protests reached its climax when farmers organizing a march in Warsaw, where the protesters clashed with anti-riot police deployed by the government.

In 1993, Andrzej Lepper took part in an interview with journalists Jan Ul and Henryk Gaworski, where Lepper introduced Samoobrona and the ideology of the party. Lepper identified with the rebel faction of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party that opposed the leading &quot;Jaruzelski-Rakowski&quot; wing and wanted to prevent the &quot;policy of selling out genuinely socialist ideals and values&quot;. He also stated that Samoobrona wished to replace the capitalism of Balcerowicz with &quot;a system that would satisfy human needs, that would prioritise man over labour and labour over capital, and would not be a system of the market but a system of social control over economic life through the state and trade unions&quot;; Lepper admitted that this system would be socialist, but stressed the &quot;indigenous&quot;, nationalist, &quot;patriotic&quot; and Catholic character of Samoobrona&#x27;s socialism, one that was to be inspired by Catholic social teaching and agrarian-socialist pre-WW2 peasant movements. As the movement expanded beyond its original local base in the north-western region of Poland as a result of high-profile violent protests in Warsaw, it became an actor beyond regional politics. While new regional offshoots emerged, Self-Defence was also involved in attempts to build a viable national protest movement. Its main allies in these ultimately futile efforts were extreme nationalist groups such as the Stronnictwo Narodowe „Ojczyzna”. Their joint demonstration in Warsaw on 2 April 1993, for example, turned violent and led to clashes with the police.

Agrarian protests of Samoobrona were attracting widespread media attention as well as popularity, and in April 1992 Lepper founded special paramilitary group of farmers called &quot;Peasant Battalions&quot; (), referring to a Polish agrarian WW2-era resistance movement of the same name. Samoobrona&#x27;s Peasant Battalions were to protect farmers against the bailiffs and evictions; after founding the group, Lepper stated: &quot;We will strengthen physical fortitude, develop patriotism and train our military troops. We don&#x27;t want war, but we have a lawless state, so we will fight the state offices - bailiffs, banks, tax offices - with weapons in hand. We are a radical party, open to all disadvantaged people who are starving at home.&quot; The &quot;Peasant Battalions&quot; successfully harassed bailiffs, even reportedly shaving their heads and battering them. The party was accused by media of planning a revolution against the government, to which Lepper provocatively responded by stating his plans to expand the Samoobrona coalition with pensioners and unemployed. Incendiary comments of Samoobrona members such as &quot;If someone has a billion or two or ten, they really couldn&#x27;t have made it through legal work&quot; became widely reported and known.

The emergence of Self-Defence as an organised political group was somewhat clouded by the alleged active involvement of former members of the communist security services who acted as advisers or activists, especially in the early days. In this context, the involvement of Soviet and Russian intelligence was also alleged. This led to calls for a parliamentary enquiry into the origins of the party and possibly its hidden agendas. One of the most striking features of Self-Defence was undoubtedly its clear longing for the former regime, which was identified with social stability and prosperity.

Samoobrona repeated slogans about the corruption of power, disregard for peasants and workers, accused the government of stealing Polish land and property and selling it to international capitalists, while Lepper also spoke of Poles starving in small towns and villages - pensioners, the unemployed, farmers. He demanded the departure of every successive government, especially ministers of agriculture. Some political commentators asserted that Lepper&#x27;s actions were radicalising and argued that the party should be banned because of the criminal cases pending against the Samoobrona trade union: concerning, among other things, the occupation of state administration buildings and blockades of public roads, preventing government officials from carrying out their legal duties, the use of blackmail and intimidation against bank and court officials, and the seizure of private property.

Lepper consistently dominated the headlines by organising spectacular protests, such as the one outside the Sejm on 19 February 1993, when farmers set up 19 large scythes and one small one - as a &quot;lady scythe&quot; that was intended for Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka. By this time, Lepper was emerging not only as a defender of farmers, but also of all those disadvantaged by the new system. Samoobrona appeared wherever there were protests or bailiffs tried to enforce court rulings. Media widely reported on Samoobrona preventing the sale of a state farm in Główczyce and the &quot;battle of the Sejm&quot;, when more than a thousand Samoobrona members turned up with banners &quot;Poland for Poles&quot; and &quot;We will not be a feeding ground for any party&quot;, sparking clashes with the police and causing several dozen people, including Andrzej Lepper to be detained. A few months aftwards, several thousand farmers from the &quot;Solidarity&quot; of Individual Farmers, Farmers&#x27; Circles and Samoobrona demonstrated in front of the government seat in Warsaw, throwing sacks of straw to symbolise poverty in the countryside. Finally, the mayor of Praszka, Włodzimierz Skoczek, was taken away in a wheelbarrow (which became Samoobrona&#x27;s speciality in the fight against officials) after refusing to sign the resignation submitted to him.

The leaders of the party frequently got into legal clashes and confrontations with the police and the judiciary because of their unruly protests. A joke became popular among Polish youth: &quot;I wish you as much luck as the number of convictions of Lepper&quot;. At the same time, they were also invited to negotiations by the country&#x27;s leaders. Self-Defence used its formal dual status as a party and a trade union, which allowed it to put on whatever hat was appropriate at the time. In the late 1990s, Lepper reportedly maintained a particularly close relationship with Artur Balazs, an agriculture minister who led the liberal-conservative Conservative People&#x27;s Party, which was part of the ruling AWS. Over the years, Balazs and Lepper together built up an extensive network of patronage in the state agricultural authorities. Balazs again served as a bridge between Lepper and the conservative right in 2005.

===Animal welfare activism===
In 1999, Samoobrona entered a coalition with the American-based Animal Welfare Institute against Smithfield Foods, American food company that wanted to enter the Polish market. After years of the neoliberal &quot;shock therapy&quot; that allowed foreign companies to outcompete Polish farms, the discontent of Polish farmers resulted in mass protests in 1999 organised by Samoobrona. The protests grew to 8000 protesting farmers and resulted in a total of 120 blockades. Samoobrona protesters became militant and clashed with the police, often resulting in confrontations which forced the police to use tear gas and water cannons. The Polish government capitulated to protesters&#x27; demands after a month, reforming its agricultural policy and imposing high tariffs on food imports. Surveys at the time showed that 75 percent of Polish population supported Samoobrona&#x27;s protests, and the party continued its protests and decided to participate in the &quot;Trojan Pig Tour&quot; organised by AWI.

After the success of Samoobrona&#x27;s protest and the implementation of some agricultural policy reforms intended to improve the conditions of impoverished farmers in, the Animal Welfare Institute (AWI) took interest in Samoobrona. The chairman of the organization, Tom Garrett, believed that an alliance with Polish farmers against corporate farming could be possible, given that the company that the AWI was currently protesting for its unethical and cruel treatment of animals, Smithfield Foods, was trying to expand its operations into Poland. Garrett wrote: “Why doesn’t AWI bring Polish farm leaders over to tour communities infested with hog factories? Polish farmers are militant and well organized. If they saw for themselves what corporate hog factories have done in America, they’ll stop Smithfield in its tracks.” AWI requested the help of Agnes Van Volkenburgh, a veterinarian who was born in Poland and emigrated to the USA as a teenager. With her help, AWI invited the representatives of 4 farmer parties, a Polish ministry agriculture official, animal welfare activists, and Polish press.

Initially, it appeared that no cooperation would be reached - Polish representatives were skeptical of the AWI&#x27;s extremely moralistic rhetoric on animal farming. During the meeting, AWI portrayed global corporations as an &quot;all-consuming enemy&quot; and &quot;cancer&quot; that had destroyed the American farmer and soil, along with mass murder of animals. Garrett recalled that the reception was “very negative” and “very hostile”. However, the radical Samoobrona was surprisingly receptive to AWI&#x27;s message; Lepper agreed that corporate farming poses a moral issue, and called Smithfield Foods farms &quot;hog concentration camps&quot;. Samoobrona and AWI settled on a common goal - &quot;protecting farm animals from the cruelties of industrialized farming and defending farmers from being shamelessly robbed by politicians and foreign corporations.&quot; Samoobrona also connected this struggle to its support for socialism, noting that foreign companies take over Polish farming by dismantling and privatizing the communist-era State Agricultural Farms. 

Lepper agreed to make anti-Smithfield lobbying a key plank of his presidential campaign, while also organising protests against Smithfield&#x27;s expansion into the Polish market. While Lepper only won 3 percent of the popular vote in the 2000 Polish presidential election, he succeeded in setting the stage for Samoobrona&#x27;s electoral success in 2001 parliamentary elections, and his anti-Smithfield campaigning mobilised Polish farmers against the company. Samoobrona organised a conference together with AWI in May 2000, promoting ecology and alternatives to industrial farming. At the same time, Samoobrona steadily incorporated more ecological and animal welfare themes into its program. Later in 2000, AWI-Samoobrona movement was endorsed by the president of Polish National Veterinary Chamber, Bartosz Winiecki, who recruited Polish veterinarians to the anti-Smithfield coalition. In the end, six thousands Polish doctors of veterinary medicine and twenty thousand veterinary technicians joined the coalition&#x27;s protests.

Environmental activism of Samoobrona and AWI bore fruit in July 2000, when Polish Minister of Agriculture, Artur Balazs, declared that the government will oppose Smithfield&#x27;s plans to introduce corporate farming in Poland. Smithfield conceded later that months, announcing that it was abandoning its plans to expand its activities into Poland. Samoobrona&#x27;s activities proved crucial to bringing about a corporate farming ban in Poland; according to Joe
Bandy and Jackie Smith, &quot;the coalition between AWI and Samoobrona represents one of the successful cases in the emerging global justice movement&quot;. For his environmental activism, Lepper was awarded the Albert Schweitzer Medal in 2000. The leader of Samoobrona stated his commitment to animal welfare, stressing that animals must be treated &quot;with respect, dignity and sympathy&quot; and condemning modern meat industry as &quot;concentration camps for animals&quot;.

The Albert Schweitzer Medal was awarded to Lepper by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.. Kennedy praised Lepper for “standing up to these bullies” who try to move industrial hog production all over the world, and for Lepper’s efforts
to protect “our environment, human dignity, the dignity of these animals and of future generations.” He also congratulated Lepper “for the successful battle that [he has] waged against this criminal, bullying, outlaw industry.” In 2002, Lepper and AWI organized a four-day tour to Poland by Kennedy, who &quot;exhorted Poles to defend their farms and countryside&quot;. In 2024, RFK Jr. discussed his cooperation with Lepper; he stated that in 2003, Smithfield Foods offered Lepper a bribe of 1 million dollars, but Lepper turned down the offer and revealed the bribery attempt.

After Samoobrona and AWI carried out its campaign, the image of Smithfield in Poland was tarnished. Samoobrona and AWI sent anti-Smithfield videos to every gmina government in Poland, along with a letter requesting them to deny building permits for Smithfield. This eventually made the Polish Agricultural Property Agency, a government institution, prohibit Smithfield from buying formerly state-owned farms. Farming corporations then shifted its strategy - instead of acquiring PGRs directly, they organized a web of contractual relations among nominally independent Polish companies, which allowed foreign companies like Smithfield to effectively control the farms nevertheless, bypassing the need to have Polish government&#x27;s permission. In response, Samoobrona broadened its strategy by opposing European integration and the European Union.
===In the government===
The party first started in parliamentary elections in 1993, gaining 2.78% votes and failing to enter the Sejm. It also took part in the 1994 local elections, where it did not play a significant role as party structures were not yet ready for an electoral campaign and were often in the preliminary state of organisation. The party won over 1.3% of the popular vote. The 1994 local elections are largely undocumented and were greatly affected by the lack of interest in Polish society, which translated into a very low turnout (33%). Samoobrona along with the Polish Socialist Party avoided forming local coalitions in the election. In the 1995 elections Andrzej Lepper ran for president and gained 1.32% of the votes; in parliamentary elections in 1997, the party took 0.08%. In 2000 Samoobrona organized a campaign of blocking major roads in order to get media attention. Lepper gained 3.05% votes in the presidential elections.

For the 1998 Polish local elections, Samoobrona founded the Social Alliance () together with Labour Union (UP), Polish People&#x27;s Party (PSL) and the National Party of Retirees and Pensioners (KPEiR). The coalition was mostly focused on protesting austerity and neoliberalism, which aligned perfectly with the main focus of Samoobrona. The coalition aimed to challenge the political dichotomy between post-communist SLD and anti-communist AWS, and was polling well. The coalition had internal conflicts however, as some wings of the PSL were concerned with the radical, far-left character of Samoobrona, whereas Labor Union protested Samoobrona&#x27;s opposition to the European Union. Nevertheless, the coalition performed well and won 89 seats.

Social Alliance was an unprecedented case of the PSL working together with much more radical Self-Defence, and there was speculation at the time about the possibility of a permanent alliance being formed on its basis, which in the long term could lead to the full unification of political structures representing Polish farmers and the rural population. However, this proposal failed as both parties started strongly competing with each other. In this situation, cooperation was limited to undertaking successive joint initiatives aimed at bringing together and working out common positions by the three largest agricultural trade unions; in June 1998 it was agreed that ZZR &quot;Samoobrona&quot; together with KZRKiOR and NSZZ &quot;Solidarność&quot; RI would work out a common position on the terms of Poland&#x27;s accession to the European Union.

The coalition also contributed to Samoobrona&#x27;s rise to relevance. Shortly before the 2001 Polish parliamentary election, there emerged a project of a &quot;Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Alliance&quot; () combining Samoobrona and the Polish Socialist Party of Piotr Ikonowicz. More significantly, Samoobrona then gained informal support from the SLD, keen to weaken the PSL, which allowed Samoobrona to play the role of an informal SLD coalition partner in the Sejm and, after the 2002 local elections, also in the provincial assemblies. Although Lepper continued to lavish criticism on SLD politicians, he distinguished the liberal wing associated with Kwasniewski from the democratic socialist group headed by Miller and Oleksy. This allowed Samoobrona to attract a sizable group of left-wing activists, both at the central and local level. After 2001, Lepper went as far as announcing that Samoobrona would become the only party of the socialist left in Poland.

At the end of January/beginning of February 1999, the whole of Poland was paralysed by road blockades and border crossings organised by farmers supporting the party. In addition to an increase in the purchase price of pork livestock, they demanded extensive government intervention in the cereal, meat and milk markets. The agreement concluded with the government on 8 February 1999 only emboldened the head of Samoobrona to further excesses. In June 1999, on the radio in Łódź, Andrzej Lepper called the then government &quot;an anti-Polish and anti-human regime&quot; and Deputy Prime Minister Tomaszewski &quot;a bandit from Pabianice&quot;. The prosecution proceedings initiated in this case ended in a failure after less than a year: when Lepper was returning from a trade union congress in India, he was spectacularly arrested after crossing the border in Kudowa (4 April 2000) and then released after three hours.

In February 2001, Samoobrona entered coalition negotiations with the Polish Socialist Party. The aforementioned &quot;Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Alliance&quot; was to be a &#x27;radical socialist&#x27; coalition between Samoobrona, PPS and the National Party of Retirees and Pensioners. PPS&#x27;s leader Piotr Ikonowicz announced that cooperation with Samoobrona would extend beyond the election campaign, and that all three parties would closely work together to fight capitalist economic reforms. The main concept behind the socialist coalition was almost identical to Samoobrona&#x27;s goal as a political party - to represent social groups that had been hurt by the capitalist transformation in Poland, which Ikonowicz listed as farmers, workers, pensioners, and students. Samoobrona was very supportive of a joint run with the PPS, and the party already cooperated with the socialist party in the 2000 Polish presidential election, when Samoobrona activists helped collect signatures for the PPS candidate, Piotr Ikonowicz. Lepper proposed PPS first 30 seats on the electoral lists and a possibility to form two separate parliamentary clubs in the Sejm. However, ultimately the Samoobrona-PPS-KPEiR coaliiton did not materialize because of the opposition of the PPS leadership, which considered Samoobrona an inappropriate political partner. After Samoobrona&#x27;s spectacular performance in the 2001 election, numerous prominent PPS activists defected to it.

The parliamentary elections in 2001 gave the party 53 seats in the Sejm, with 10.5% support, making it the third largest political force. In September 2001, the winner of the election, the social democratic Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), was looking for a coalition partner in order to form a working majority. Because of its left-wing and pro-communist profile, Samoobrona was considered and the SLD leadership almost made the government offer, but eventually the party settled with its old coalition partner instead - Polish People&#x27;s Party. Although officially a member of the opposition, Samoobrona backed the ruling social democratic Democratic Left Alliance in a number of key votes, giving them the majority needed to stay in power. The party has also marked its presence in the Sejm by unconventional disruptive behavior.

The 2001 election was a huge trump for the party, which unexpectedly became the third political force in Poland. The support for Lepper&#x27;s organisation in the Koszaliński district reached 23%; over 15% was recorded in the Sieradz, Chełm and Piotrków districts. Samoobrona still had weak support in big cities: in Warsaw it received 3%, in the Poznań district 5%, and in the districts of Gdańsk, Gliwice and Katowice - 6% each. The campaign itself was characterised by a much calmer tone and much less aggression. A breakthrough in the ratings of the Lepper movement occurred at the beginning of September, when it reached a borderline 4-5% support in polls, which jumped to 8-9% after just a few weeks.

Lepper achieved only 3 percent nationwide among voters with a university degree and only 8 percent among voters with a high school diploma, even though the majority of students trusted him, according to surveys. Surprisingly, 9.4 percent of the self-employed voters - i.e. those doing private business - voted for Samoobrona, most of them being small entrepreneurs who feared economic competition in the event of Poland joining the EU. Overall, Lepper was elected by eleven percent of male and seven percent of female voters. He received eight per cent of the votes from voters aged 18 to 24, ten per cent from 25 to 59 and seven per cent from voters over 60. Samoobrona received 16 per cent of the vote in rural areas, eight per cent in towns with up to 50,000 inhabitants, seven per cent in towns between 50,000 and 200,000 and five per cent in towns with over 200,000 inhabitants. Samoobrona was particularly popular after the 2001 election - the survey conducted for &quot;Rzeczpospolita&quot; showed that in March 2002, 11 percent of Poles supported Samoobrona. In May 2002, 17 percent of Poles wanted the party to take power. The analyses of the Pentor Institute show that in April 2002, 18 percent of those questioned, i.e. almost one in five Poles, supported Samoobrona. From January to May 2002, the party&#x27;s acceptance and popularity rose considerably from 9 to 17 per cent.

Despite the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) ultimately deciding against choosing Samoobrona as its coalition partner, Samoobrona initially supported the SLD-PSL government and entered a confidence and supply agreement with it. The SLD also nominated Genowefa Wiśniowska, a member of Samoobrona, as the chair of the Parliamentary Committee on National and Ethnic Minorities. This nomination initially faced backlash because of the radical image of Samoobrona, but after a few weeks Polish media acknowledged that Polish minority groups reported no bias in the committee&#x27;s work. This improved the image of Samoobrona and downplayed its nationalist reputation. Lepper continued to soften the image of his party in regards to national minorities, and visited the Belarusian Socio-Cultural Association in Białystok where he pledged to allocate additional funds to the Belarusian minority in Poland. He argued that &quot;the development of Belarusian culture in Poland is under threat; in the absence of adequate funding, it has no chance of survival.&quot; Samoobrona also had a notably high support amongst the Ukrainian minority in Poland, consistently winning the municipalities in West Pomeranian Voivodeship and Warmian–Masurian Voivodeship where Ukrainians constituted a significant minority or plurality. Samoobrona also spoke for regulation that would allow for easy legal employment of Ukrainian workers in Poland, as well as allow Ukrainian citizens to not require a work permit at all for temporary and seasonal jobs.

Both parties also worked with each other on local levels, and formed coalitions in voivodeship sejmiks. Local leaders emphasized the left-wing outlook of both parties. Samoobrona also hoped to persuade the SLD to soften its pro-European stance, especially on the issue of European integration. In 2003, SLD also supported Andrzej Lepper&#x27;s candidacy for the parliamentary inquiry committee regarding the Rywin affair; SLD explained that &quot;Samoobrona was, is and will probably remain the SLD&#x27;s main de facto ally and this is no surprise.&quot; Surprisingly, Lepper was also supported by the far-right and anti-capitalist League of Polish Families.

However, later in 2003, Samoobrona rebelled against the SLD and broke both the local coalitions as well as the confidence and supply agreement in the Sejm. Lepper stated that the &quot;SLD presented a different program before the elections, after the elections it started to implement a different program, and today practically nothing remains of both the first one and the other one.&quot; Samoobrona accused SLD of betraying its social-democratic principles and did not turn the tide after the previous neoliberal government, continuing austerity and privatization reforms instead. The party also pointed out to the fact that the SLD responded to farmer protests with police forces and suppression, instead of trying to improve the agrarian situation in Poland; Lepper listed &quot;the arrogance of the SLD, the disregard of Samoobrona&#x27;s program objectives and the brutality of the government towards the protesters&quot; as the main reasons for his hostility towards SLD. In its declaration of terminating the agreement with SLD, Samoobrona leadership in Łódź wrote that it could never work with a party responsible for breaking up farmers&#x27; protests. The SLD-PSL government fell shortly after, as the PSL left the coalition after the minister of economy, Jacek Piechota from SLD, abolished custom duties on some food products; PSL and Samoobrona decried this decision as &quot;the nail in the coffin for farmers&quot;. SLD then entered a new coalition with the pro-European Labour Union that lasted until 2004.

The involvement of Piotr Tymochowicz&#x27;s professional image creation company resulted, among other things, in a more attractive appearance for Andrzej Lepper (a solarium tan to mask blushing in moments of nervousness, well-tailored suits). He was also given lessons in rhetoric, eristic and retorting, and his tone of voice was lowered. The Self-Defence candidates appeared in the media wearing distinctive white and red ties, which not only made political identification easier for the voters, but also encouraged them to perceive the party as a strong and cohesive patriotic team. According to contemporary newspapers, election spots of the Lepper movement were also among the best presented in the campaign by all parties.

Among their numerous exploits there are such diverse incidents as using their own loudspeakers after being cut off for exceeding the permitted time, or claiming that the largest opposition party (Civic Platform) met with members of the Taliban in Klewki (a village near Olsztyn) to sell them anthrax. Several Samoobrona members of parliament were subject to criminal investigations on charges ranging from forgery to banditry.

In early 2005, Democratic Party of the Left, a left-wing anti-capitalist that split from Democratic Left Alliance, declared that their former party had &quot;shown that they have nothing to do with the left&quot;. In wake of this, the party entered a formal agreement with Samoobrona, together with the National Party of Retirees and Pensioners. Both parties became close allies of Samoobrona, and their activists ran on Samoobrona&#x27;s electoral list in 2005.

In the 2005 elections, Samoobrona received a total of 56 seats with 11.4% support. Andrzej Lepper ran for president of Poland in the 2005 election. He received third place and 15% of the vote, a great improvement over his past performances. After the elections, Samoobrona temporarily shelved its most radical demands and along with the League of Polish Families entered into a coalition with the center-right Law and Justice party.

Despite being a part of a right-wing government, the party doubled down on its left-wing rhetoric. Jarosław Tomasiewicz wrote: &quot;This joint front with the right, however, did not mean a turn of the SRP to the right. On the contrary, Lepper&#x27;s plan was for Samoobrona to take over the hegemony on the left&quot;. On the next party convention, Lepper stated: &quot;I set myself the aim to convince the electorate of the left in such a way that they understand that the only left-wing, pro-social and patriotic party is currently Samoobrona&quot;.

To this end, the party started cooperating with minor left-wing parties such as the Democratic Left Party, the Working People&#x27;s Movement and the National Party of Retirees and Pensioners. The ranks of Self-Defence included activists from the Democratic Left Alliance (e.g. Grzegorz Tuderek, Bolesław Borysiuk) and the Labour Union (Andrzej Aumiller). To a large extent, Lepper&#x27;s plan succeeded - while right-leaning voters defected to the League of Polish Families, this was compensated by further gains amongst left-wing voters - mainly pensioners, workers of bankrupt workplaces and former officers of the uniformed services.

According to contemporary polls, Self-Defence overtook Democratic Left Alliance in terms of popularity. Contemporary commentators speculated that Self-Defence might emerge as the new main left-wing party in Poland. Parallel to its parliamentary activity, the SRP tried to be active in the social sphere. The party started to cooperate with organisations of disabled people (even appointing a special plenipotentiary for contacts with them) and the circles of single mothers. Commenting on the developments in Poland, Bulgarian political scientist Maria Spirova argued that Samoobrona is a serious contender for becoming the &quot;successor party&quot; of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party and the main representative of the Polish left:
However, scandals that rocked the party made its popularity collapse. In December 2006, a scandal broke out when Aneta Krawczyk, a local party ex-leader accused Samoobrona leaders, notably Andrzej Lepper and Stanisław Łyżwiński of sexual harassment. Subsequently, the accusation was supported by other females from within the party ranks and the issue of gaining governmental posts in exchange for sex produced a major outcry after &quot;Gazeta Wyborcza&quot; published the claims. Krawczyk also claimed her then 3-year-old daughter was Stanisław Łyżwiński&#x27;s child, which proved to be incorrect following DNA testing.

The criminal trial in this case began in 2008 before the District Court of District Court in Piotrków Trybunalski, which in February 2010 sentenced Lepper to two years and three months&#x27; imprisonment and Łyżwiński to five years of imprisonment. Both have maintained that they were innocent. In March 2011, the Court of Appeal in Łódź overturned the verdict against Lepper in the sex affair and referred the case for retrial by the Regional Court. Afterwards, Aneta Krawczyk filed a court accusation that Lepper was the father of her youngest child. However, an examination of his DNA ruled out this allegation. These events caused not only politicians, but also the public public condemned the Samoobrona activists. It lost a part of its electorate. Lepper almost disappeared from the media. Rarely invited to interviews, he generally focused on criticising the right-wing Law and Justice party.

At the beginning of July 2007, then Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński named Lepper as a person in the circle of suspicion in connection with the so-called &quot;land affair&quot;. This concerned a CBA (Central Anti-Corruption Bureau) operation concerning the controlled payment of bribes to two people accused of citing influence in the Ministry of Agriculture. They offered a substituted CBA agent, for a bribe, the de-agglomeration of land in Muntów in the municipality of Mrągowo. The operation ended inconsistently with the CBA&#x27;s plan, because - as the prosecution initially assumed - Lepper had been warned about the action and cancelled the meetings. However, at the request of Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński, President Lech Kaczyński dismissed Lepper from the post of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture. This decision marked the end of the coalition.

As the sting operation against Lepper failed, it sparked an outrage. It was questioned whether the operation was ordered by Kaczyński himself, or if it initiated by the Polish secret services on their own volition. Some experts, such as the Lithuanian sociologist Zenonas Norkus, assert that the operation was a political move by Jarosław Kaczyński, who already planned to end the coalition and needed a reason that implicating Lepper in bribery activities would give him. The operation also compromised the entire cabinet of Kaczyński, as his Minister of Interior, Janusz Kaczmarek, was arrested and accused of leaking information on the sting operation to Lepper. Ultimately the investigation against Kaczmarek was dropped in 2009, putting into question whether Lepper was warned beforehand at all, or if he cancelled the meetings for other reason.

The party&#x27;s position towards the scandal was that it was a &quot;coup attempt&quot;, as the presence of Samoobrona in the government supposedly thratened powerful &quot;interest groups&quot;, including corporations controlling large-format shops, investment fund owners, land speculators and property development groups. Lepper also argued that the scandals and investigations started against him were aimed at eliminating competition for Lech Kaczyński for future presidential elections. After unsuccessful attempts of Law and Justice to convince some of the Samoobrona MPs to defect, the PiS-Samoobrona-LPR coalition was officially dissolved on 5 August 2007. Reasons cited were ideological differences between PiS and Samoobrona on fundamental levels.

===Downfall===
Following the collapse of the ruling coalition, a proposal of a joint front between Samoobrona and right-wing League of Polish Families was born, known as League and Self-Defence (). The Polish abbreviation for this party was LiS (&quot;fox&quot; in Polish), and leaders of both parties brought a plush fox to the press conference, which was shown as the mascot of the new party. However, despite their populist character, LPR and Samoobrona were fundamentally different from each other, as Samoobrona was left-wing and aligned with socialist ideals, while LPR was a National-Catholic, far-right party. Andrzej Lepper himself admitted that the alliance was a bad idea, and argued that the alliance was purely situation and tactical in nature.

The idea was highly unpopular amongst Samoobrona supporters, as a majority of them identified as left-wing and desired a return to a socialist economy. A chunk of the Catholic socialist wing of the party known as Social Movement seceded to form a new party called Self-Defence Social Movement (), which then became Self-Defence Rebirth.

The idea of the LiS party was then soon abandoned, and the party doubled down on its left-wing rhetoric, inviting Leszek Miller and the leader of the New Left, Piotr Ikonowicz, to its electoral lists. Despite this, numerous scandals heavily damaged the image of the party, while forming a government with right-wing parties and the LiS caused distrust among the party&#x27;s overwhelmingly left-wing electorate. As a result, the party gained less than 2% of the popular vote in the 2007 Polish parliamentary election, failing to win any seats and being excluded from government funding.

The last bill proposed by Samoobrona before losing all of its seats in the 2007 election was a proposal from 7 September 2007 to recognize the Silesian language as a regional language of Poland. Along with the MPs of Samoobrona, the bill was also supported by the members of LPR, People&#x27;s National Movement and the Polish People&#x27;s Party. However, the Sejm was dissolved on the same day, prompting a snap election. The bill was therefore rejected. After 17 years, the Sejm voted in favor of a bill recognizing Silesian as a regional language in Poland on 26 April 2024. However, on 29 May 2024, the President Andrzej Duda vetoed the bill, claiming that Silesian is not a language and does not deserve its own status.

In November 2007, the regionalist wing of the party seceded and formed Party of Regions, further weakening local structures of the party. Lepper accepted responsibility for the party&#x27;s electoral defeat and announced an extraordinary congress of Self-Defence in the first half of 2008. Lepper also announced that he did not intend to challenge or clash with the Party of Regions. In party congress, Lepper stressed that Samoobrona&#x27;s goals from the time when it was a classic protest party, such as the reversal of privatisation processes, had not been realised and were still a political task for the party.

The party also reestablished its reputation as an unequivocally left-wing party. Talks were initiated with the Polish Socialist Party led by Piotr Ikonowicz and the democratic-socialist National Party of Retirees and Pensioners, proposing to establish &quot;a worker–peasant alliance&quot;. There was also an attempt to establish a new party that would represent socialist left, with a view to prepare for the 2009 European Parliament election in Poland. However, the party went bankrupt by the end of 2007 as it was unable to pay for its 2007 electoral campaign. The party was also unable to cover its bills, and electricity and the alarm system were disconnected from the party headquarters. Lepper founded a new party known as &quot;Self-Defence&quot; (as opposed to &quot;Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland&quot;) in 2010, which sustained itself solely on membership fees and had no commitments.

In 2009, as the two-party system of right-wing populist Law and Justice and centre-right neoliberal Civic Platform started consolidating itself, Samoobrona entered an &quot;anti-neoliberal&quot; media pact together with Law and Justice and Democratic Left Alliance. Informally known as the &quot;media coalition&quot;, the pact was based on filling the managerial positions in Telewizja Polska (TVP) (Polish state media) with PiS-aligned persons that would exclude Samoobrona and Democratic Left Alliance from criticism and attacks in favour of focusing solely on the rising Civic Platform. On 29 July 2009, four out of five members of the National Broadcasting Council: Barbara Babula (recommended by Law and Justice), Piotr Boroń (representing President Lech Kaczyński), Tomasz Borysiuk (recommended by Samoobrona), Witold Kołodziejski (recommended by Law and Justice), elected the Supervisory Board of Telewizja Polska, which included people associated with the three parties of the &quot;media coalition&quot;. All three heads of Telewizja Polska (Szwedo, Szatkowski, Orzeł) were associated with the Law and Justice party - the informal arrangement assumed that the position of TVP president went to PiS, and of two vice-presidents - to Samoobrona and Democratic Left Alliance.

In February 2010, he was inconvicably sentenced to two years and three months in prison for the sex affair. The leader of Self-Defence was also plagued by the troubles of his son Tomasz - in October 2010, the bank sold the agricultural machinery for non-payment of the lease. Nevertheless, Lepper was registered as a presidential candidate in the 2010 Polish presidential election. Lepper&#x27;s support was highly localized - he was leading in rural and poor regions such as in Suwałki. Lepper was also the most popular candidate online, and his supporters dominated Polish social media such as NK.pl. However, this did not translate into widespread support, as Lepper was polling only 1% nationwide.

Lepper ran a traditionally leftist campaign, emphasizing that he and his party are ideological opponents of liberalism and privatisation, and proposing a socialised economy and nationalization of important industries. He promoted his concept of a Natural Disaster Fund, which would be a state-run program guaranteeing welfare and housing for victims of natural disasters, particularly floods. This harkened back to the Lepper&#x27;s beginning in politics from 1991, when he emerged as the leader of local farmers impoverished by transition to capitalism as well as local flooding. Lepper also planned to renegotiate the conditions of Polish membership in the European Union, arguing that Poland is being untreated unfairly and that the subsidies for farmers are insufficient. Lepper relied on personal meetings with the voters and had a low-budget campaign at around 200.000 PLN. Lepper also stressed his opposition towards NATO, and argued for a complete withdrawal of Polish forces from Afghanistan, condemning the American operation in Afghanistan. He proposed that Poland prioritize cooperation with India, Russia and China rather than the United States. Otherwise, Lepper focused on socioeconomic issues and his economic populism, noting that other presidential candidates provide little mention of pensions, unemployment and the situation of the disabled. One of his main focus became healthcare, where Lepper proposed to suspend the debts of all hospitals, and strongly attacked privatization plans, arguing that they would further aggravate wealth inequality in Poland.

When questioned, Lepper stressed his opposition to abortion as well as euthanisation, but took a supportive stance same-sex partnerships. He also emphasized his anti-EU and anti-NATO views throughout the campaign, and decried numerous privatization proposals present in the Polish political discourse. When criticized for his numerous convictions and investigations, Lepper stated that he is proud of his criminal record, as &quot;99 percent were trials for blockades, for defending factories and people&#x27;s jobs against their executions and bailiffs&quot;. In the end, Lepper won 1.28% of the popular vote and did not make it to the second round; he offered to endorse one of the main presidential candidates, Kaczyński and Komorowski, and wrote to them asking for their opinions on increasing the minimum wage, raising pensions and annuities, as well as their agricultural policy and international affairs. In the end, Lepper endorsed neither of the candidates as their replies were similar, and ultimately unsatisfactory, to Lepper. However, Lepper did stress his opposition to Jarosław Kaczyński, accusing him of deliberately ruining his career via sting operation that the Central Anticorruption Bureau illegally attempted to incriminate Lepper with in July 2007. Shortly after the election, Lepper went to Belarus and was an international observer in the 2010 Belarusian presidential election.

Despite the disheartening performance, Lepper stated that he will seek to gain a seat in the parliament once again. In 2011, Lepper was already preparing for the next election, believing that he retains a support base that he needs to mobilize. Unexpectedly, Lepper was found dead in his office on 5 August 2011, in what was ruled to be suicide. According to the official investigation, Lepper was planning to return to Polish politics. Co-workers of Lepper such as Janusz Maksymiuk also confirmed that the politician was already planning an election campaign for his party. On the day of his suicide, the television in his room showed a paused frame from a conference between Donald Tusk and the Minister of National Defence at 13:14. The caption on the news bar read: &quot;It&#x27;s time for the campaign to begin&quot;.

In August 2011, news of the death of Andrzej Lepper reached the public. According to media reports, the leader of Samoobrona was to have hanged himself in his office, which was the party&#x27;s headquarters. Before Lepper&#x27;s funeral took place, the media eagerly reconstructed his last moments and the accompanying circumstances and alleged reasons for his suicide. Journalists&#x27; attention was particularly absorbed by the last hours of Lepper&#x27;s life.

Death of Lepper remains a huge controversy, with the co-workers of Lepper insisting that he would not have killed himself. On the day of his suicide, Lepper arranged an interview with a journalist; the interviewer came to Lepper&#x27;s headquarters at 14:00, but left after half an hour after repeatedly calling Lepper. Janusz Maksymiuk, a co-worker of Lepper, claims that he could not have committed suicide as Lepper asked him to prepare documents for his legal process several hours before his death. Some of the investigators of the Internal Security Agency also expressed doubts about Lepper&#x27;s suicide, arguing that the circumstances of his death are &quot;puzzling&quot;.

===After 2011===

After Lepper&#x27;s death, the political significance of the party greatly declined, even though formally the party still existed. The party was never able to recover from the loss of its leader, and did not develop further - Samoobrona&#x27;s socio-economic program posted on its website is still signed by Andrzej Lepper, and the ideology of the party greatly narrowed to continuing the legacy of Lepper.

Political scientists and media highly speculated about the effect that Samoobrona&#x27;s downfall had on Polish politics, with many speculating that most of the party&#x27;s former voters went to right-wing populist Law and Justice. However , according to Radosław Markowski, roughly half of Samoobrona voters stopped voting in elections. Amongst the other half that continued voting, only a quarter switched to Law and Justice, while the majority went to social-democratic SLD and agrarian PSL. Markowski argues that amongst all political parties, it is PSL that benefited the most from the collapse of Samoobrona.

In September 2013, Samoobrona participated in a protest named &quot;In defence of Syria!&quot; The declaration of the protest stated: &quot;I support Syria against the war that is being financed, rearmed and planned by Western forces and their allies in the region, opposing the expansion of imperialism in the Middle East. NOT the destruction of Syria. NO repetition of the imperialist invasion in Iraq and Libya! Victory for Syria!&quot; The protest was supported by the Polish Communist Party.

In 2014, SLD gained a substantial number of the party&#x27;s voters after the son of Andrzej Lepper, Tomasz Lepper, agreed to run on its electoral list. Tomasz Lepper failed to gain a seat, despite winning the highest share of votes in his powiat. In February 2016, the party signed a cooperation agreement with the ruling party in Belarus, Belaya Rus.

In 2018, a new political party AGROunia was founded, which is an agrarian socialist party aiming to appeal to farmers and rural voters disillusioned with Law and Justice. The leader of the party Michał Kołodziejczak called his party a spiritual successor to Samoobrona and openly admitted that his political career is inspired by Andrzej Lepper. Kołodziejczak argued that the downfall of Samoobrona left an empty space in Polish political scene and resulted in voters having no left-wing party to vote for, dismissing Lewica as &quot;urban, secular left&quot; that no longer represents the working class. He presented AGROunia as a &quot;normal, real left, which represents trade unions, represents workers and demands their rights&quot; and called Lepper a &quot;prophet&quot;, stating: &quot;Andrzej Lepper turned out to be a prophet of what will happen in Poland. What we see today - high prices, lack of housing, hard work that unfortunately does not equal a decent salary, and still the same bunch of thieves at the trough, which has not changed since then. Lepper talked about all this in detail, and he did it in a very effective way, which we appreciate very much today.&quot;

On 5 August 2023, the 12th anniversary of Lepper&#x27;s death, Kołodziejczak visited the grave of Andrzej Lepper together with the remaining members of Samoobrona and announced a Samoobrona-AGROunia coalition for the 2023 Polish parliamentary election. Announcing a join electoral list with Samoobrona, Kołodziejczak argued: &quot;Today it is necessary to avenge what Law and Justice did to Andrzej Lepper. This is one of the motives of the people who work and operate with us.&quot; He also released a statement praising Lepper and promising to uphold his legacy: &quot;Let us forever remember him who, when others were turned away, stood up for the Poles and their rights. He was supremely brave, though many lacked decency and courage. He was honourable, among politicians without honour. He served Poland, though many served only themselves and big business. He was with us, true to principle, in a world full of hatred and betrayal.&quot;

The coalition fell apart on 16 August as AGROunia announced its cooperation with the Civic Coalition under the leadership of Donald Tusk and his Civic Platform. The alliance was formally announced during the National Council meeting of the Civic Platform. Polish political scientist Rafał Chwedoruk praised this decision, arguing that a coalition with AGROunia would help the Civic Platform appeal to rural voters, who hitherto considered the party elitist and urban-centric. Kołodziejczak argued that the coalition is necessary to prevent vote splitting and to ensure the defeat of the United Right government; Kołodziejczak stated: &quot;No vote must go to waste, and we must show everyone in Poland that, despite our different views, we are looking in one direction - towards a future Poland that will be strong, rich and here people will build it together. This is what I am here for, I believe in it and I will do everything: we will win with PiS, we will take back the countryside from PiS&quot;.

The party registered an electoral list for the 2023 Polish parliamentary election, but did not field any candidates for the Sejm or Senate seats. On 13 October 2023, the chairman of the party Krzysztof Prokopczyk published a statement declaring that Samoobrona does not endorse any political party and asked its supporters and sympathizers to vote according to their own conscience. The party also encouraged its supporters to participate in the 2023 Polish referendum. Despite stating its neutrality, Samoobrona also made a remark referencing the 2005 Polish presidential election: &quot;Samoobrona RP remembers how Andrzej Lepper, winning 15% of the vote in the presidential elections, handed it over to Lech Kaczyński, who won those elections. We all remember how it ended.&quot; This remark referenced the ill-fated PiS-LPR-Samoobrona government coalition that lasted from 2005 to 2007; by the 2007 Polish parliamentary election, PiS had expelled Samoobrona from the coalition and is credited with causing the electoral downfall of Samoobrona, as PiS effectively overshadowed Samoobrona&#x27;s socialist appeal with its social populist rhetoric.

The party registered two electoral committees for the 2024 Polish local elections, one for Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland and another as just &quot;Self-Defence&quot;; the first committee only contested seats in the Masovian Voivodeship Sejmik, whereas the second one ran in 6 voivodeships. In Kruklanki, a local electoral committee &quot;National Self-Defence of the Polish Fatherland&quot; () was also registered; the name alludes to the Self-Defence of the Polish Nation, a right-wing split from Samoobrona that functioned between 2003 and 2023. In the 2024 Polish local elections, Self-Defence received 0.94% of the popular vote and won no seats in the voivodeship sejmiks. However, the party managed to win seats in municipal councils, winning seats in the Gmina Czastary, Gmina Igołomia-Wawrzeńczyce, Gmina Mielnik, Gmina Nurzec-Stacja, and Gmina Sokoły. The committee &quot;National Self-Defence of the Polish Fatherland&quot; also won the seat it contested in Kruklanki.

In the 2024 European Parliament election in Poland, the party registered an electoral committee, but did not field any candidates. On 28 May 2024, the party published its demands &quot;10 priorities for Polish farming&quot; and offered to endorse any candidate that signed it. The demands of the party included preventing trade liberalisation, objecting to raising taxes on agricultural products, and reforming or repealings parts of the European Green Deal. While Samoobrona did not directly participate in the election, a member of the party, Krzysztof Sarecki, ran on the list of a populist party Repair Poland Movement. He won 260 votes, and did not gain a seat.

On 5 August 2024, the 13th anniversary of Andrzej Lepper&#x27;s death, the party wrote a letter to the prime minister Donald Tusk, asking him to intervene in the case of recompensation for Lepper&#x27;s family. The relatives of Lepper requested that they be compensated from the government&#x27;s Justice Fund (, as the former head and deputy head of the Central Anticorruption Bureau, Mariusz Kamiński and Maciej Wąsik, were convincted in 2023 for organizing an unlawful sting operation against Lepper in 2007. The Polish Minister of Justice Adam Bodnar did not answer the request, which led to Samoobrona announcing interventions at government offices, as well as protests outside the Ministry of Justice or the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office as last resort.

In December 2024, another party aiming to be a successor of Samoobrona, the Self-Defence Rebirth of Andrzej Lepper () was founded in Lublin. The founders of the party include the members of the pro-Russian Polish Antiwar Movement (), as well as former members of Samoobrona. According to Rzeczpospolita, the creation of the party is associated with a larger revival of interest in Andrzej Lepper - since 2022, Polish rural trade unions have been organizing popular campaign to build a monument to Andrzej Lepper, and mainstream parties such as Konfederacja have been requesting to relaunch the investigation into Lepper&#x27;s death, which many speculate to be murder than suicide.

On 25 January 2025, Samoobrona held party congress on which it announced its own candidate for the 2025 Polish presidential election - Aldona Anna Skirgiełło. Skirgiełło is a Polish farmer living in Podlasie that became famous through her appearance in the TTV series &quot;Wives of Podlasie&quot; (), where she played a star role. It is the first time since 2010 that the party fielded its own candidate. Skirgiełło&#x27;s views are anti-capitalist, socially conservative and pro-Russian, including her declarations to protect &quot;traditional Christian values&quot; and to introduce mandatory parliamentary representation for ethnic and religious minorities in Poland. When asked about her prospect of victory, she stated: &quot;I won&#x27;t win the election anyway, but I will stir things up.&quot;

==Ideology== 

Samoobrona espouses protectionist, nationalist and socialist views, representing a synthesis of the Polish peasant movement, Catholic social teaching and the socialist tradition of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic. Samoobrona is considered a radical, agrarian and populist party representing the interests of social groups impoverished by the capitalist transition; the party appeals to the nostalgia for communist Poland, particularly the era of Edward Gierek and the communitarian way of life from that period, represented by institutions such as the State Agricultural Farms. Samoobrona is classified as a far-left party based on the poorest economic classes, and has explicitly communist origins. It is widely considered socialist - political scientists such as Sarah de Lange, Gerrit Voerman, Klaus Bachmann and Rafał Pankowski also described the party as socialist. The party was described as socialist by the media as well, such as the Gość Niedzielny, Newsweek Polska, and The Guardian. Samoobrona is also Eurosceptic, anti-globalization and opposes USA, which it accuses of &#x27;colonizing&#x27; Poland.

The socialism of the party was also subclassed by some political scientists and the media - Sarah de Lange classified the party as agrarian socialist, while others also described the party as Christian socialist. Other classifications include &quot;farmer socialism&quot;, and &quot;peasant socialism&quot; comparable to that of István Csurka, described as a mixture of &quot;ultra-left-wing&quot; and nationalist elements. Samoobrona was also described as socialist-populist, and compared to the Communist Party of Slovakia in that regard. Additionally, the party was described as patriotic socialist as to encompass the nationalist and socialist nature of the party, as well as to fit the party&#x27;s self-description; Samoobrona describes itself as &quot;patriotic left&quot;. Similarly, Jarosław Tomasiewicz described Samoobrona as socialist nationalist, classifying the party as one of the post-communist successors of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party, explaining that Samoobrona became the party national communists found refuge in. The party rejects capitalism altogether and demands state-funded agriculture, expansive social programs, an end to repayments of the foreign debt, additional transaction taxes and the use of financial reserves to obtain funding, as well as the nationalisation of foreign capital. Samoobrona consistently emphasised its left-wing identity, referring to itself as &quot;patriotic, progressive and modern left&quot;, &quot;national left&quot;, &quot;Catholic left&quot;, and also &quot;socialist left&quot;. The party&#x27;s leader Andrzej Lepper stated that &quot;the traditions from which Samoobrona draws are the pre-war Polish Socialist Party and the Polish People&#x27;s Party &quot;Wyzwolenie&quot;, so the parties of the patriotic left, that this grassroots movement of Poles who have been wronged for 20 years wants to represent on the Polish political scene&quot;.

Samoobrona has been described as left-wing, &quot;ultra-leftist&quot;, &quot;left-nationalist&quot;, populist, &quot;combining socialism and agrarian populism&quot;, &quot;radical peasant&quot;, &quot;leftist-populist&quot; and &quot;populist-nationalist&quot;. Polish political scientist Olga Wysocka describes Samoobrona as &quot;social populists (. . .) [who] combine socialism and populism, and represent a form of left-wing populism&quot;. Leaders and members of the party generally described Samoobrona as a broad patriotic social movement based on Catholic social teaching, with some using labels such as &quot;left-patriotic&quot;, &quot;patriotic&quot;, &quot;progressive&quot;, &quot;nationalist&quot; and even &quot;genuinely centrist&quot; as well. Andrzej Lepper himself ultimately described himself as left-wing, stating &quot;I have always been and will always be a man of the left&quot;. Marek Borowski, a left-wing politician, criticised Samoobrona as a &quot;political chameleon&quot;, but described the party as socialist and nationalist. Describing the Polish political scene of 2006, the Leibniz Institute of Agricultural Development in Transition Economies classified Samoobrona as the leading &quot;populist left wing&quot; party. German political scientist Nikolaus Werz described Samoobrona as an anti-globalization and anti-capitalist party that promotes protectionist, socialist and nationalist policies, combined with &quot;a noticeable nostalgia for the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland&quot;. Sociologist Heinrich Best described the party as &quot;extreme populists and proponents of radical welfarism (...) and state socialism&quot;. In news reports, the party was consistently described as socialist - New York Times described Samoobrona as a leftist party which was &quot;a conglomeration of farmers and socialists who favor continued heavy state subsidies&quot;, whose leader Andrzej Lepper &quot;combined socialist policies with populist rhetoric&quot;. Conversely, Slate described the party&#x27;s ideology as a &quot;frightening mixture of nationalism and socialism&quot;.

Political scientists of both English-language and Polish-language literature also described the party as far-left. Paul G. Lewis and Zdenka Mansfeldová categorised Samoobrona as a post-communist Eastern European party with communist and socialist leanings, comparing it to the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia, Hungarian Labour Party and the Communist Party of Slovakia. Polish political scientist Andrzej Antoszewski argues that the postulates of Samoobrona are consistent with those of other neocommunist parties, although the party shows unique ethical socialist and Christian socialist leanings not found in other far-left parties of Eastern Europe. The party&#x27;s program proposes a &#x27;great national programme of economic revival&#x27;, marked by a retreat from &quot;satanic values&quot; defined as the pursuit of maximum profits, getting rich, ruthless competition, degenerate consumerism, total commercialisation and contempt for the weak. The party also calls for the abandonment of &quot;savage capitalism, the free market, fiscal terror and monetarist-bank parasitism&quot;; Antoszewski described this rhetoric as particularly characteristic of neo-communist parties.

Ryszard Herbut compares Samoobrona to a fellow far-left populist and agrarian party Union of the Workers of Slovakia - both parties praised &quot;the economic and social principles of communism (while verbally dissociating itself from some of the mistakes of the past), criticised the capitalist development model adopted after 1989, negatively assessed the process of political, economic and military integration of Europe and protested against globalisation&quot;. Samoobrona was known for its positive attitude towards Communist Poland; Sławomir Drelich called the party &quot;the most post-communist party on the Polish political scene&quot;. Bartek Pytlas argues that Samoobrona did not draw back to historical nationalist parties and movements in its political tradition, but rather looked to communist Poland and continued its socialist legacy. At the same time, the party sought to define itself as Catholic.

Some media reports tended to call Samoobrona right-wing, often to equate it with the League of Polish Families, a fellow anti-establishment and populist party in Poland. However, most political scientists classified Samoobrona as left-wing. Sarah de Lange and Gerrit Voerman stated that Samoobrona formed a distinct form of left-wing populism and agrarian socialism, drifting towards conventional left in the mid-2000s. Comparing Samoobrona to the League of Polish Families, Rafał Pankowski argued that Samoobrona voters were most concerned about economic hardship and supported the party over economic issues, while the right-wing LPR attracted motivated by nationalist values instead; LPR supporters were by far,the most religious group of all Polish party constituencies, while supporters of Samoobrona reported the lowest income. Olga Wysocka also points out that Samoobrona aspired to be a &quot;voice of the disadvantaged&quot;, and focused on economic issues.

The party stated its commitment to Catholic social teaching and opposed the legalisation of euthanasia, abortion and soft drugs. However, Samoobrona also promoted legalising same-sex partnerships in Poland and animal welfare, ultimately undermining its agrarian image and changing the stance of nationalist circles towards it from ambivalent to hostile. Karol Kostrzębski argues that Samoobrona had much more in common with other post-communist left-wing parties than right-wing ones such as LPR or PiS, classifying as a staunchly left-wing party. Kostrzębski also highlights that Samoobrona was heavily involved in trade unions, was the most popular party amongst Polish unionised workers and called for abolition of capitalism. Polish columnist Marek Migalski classifies Samoobrona as a left-wing &quot;populist-etatist&quot; party, while Polish political scientist Andrzej Antoszewski places Samoobrona among the Central European extreme left and &quot;neo-communist&quot; groupings, although at the same time he emphasises that Samoobrona is the only case in this group with a non-communist origin. Tadeusz Piskorski highlights that in the 2000s Samoobrona transitioned from a protest party to a &quot;stabilised left-wing party&quot;, which competed with other left-wing parties for voters. In a 2005 survey of Samoobrona members, over 50% identified as politically left-wing , while only 26% members identified as right-wing.

Rafał Pankowski classified Samoobrona as a left-wing populist party that utilised anti-globalisation and anti-liberal rhetoric to appeal to those left behind by the Polish transition to capitalism and integration with Western markets. Pankowski wrote: &quot;it was first of all a voice of social protest against liberalism, appealing to those who were economically worse off as a result of the capitalist transition&quot;. While researching the party and its ideology in the 2000s, Ola Wysocka recalls: &quot;in 2006 at the V National Congress of Self-Defence, I asked members of the party to indicate who the party represented. Most of them pointed to “the people”. When prompted to be more specific, they added “disadvantaged people”&quot;.

Poland&#x27;s June 2003 referendum on membership of the European Union was an uncomfortable experience for Samoobrona. On one hand, the party&#x27;s isolationism and Euroscepticism led it to call officially for a &quot;no&quot; vote. In 2002, the party even declared: &quot;When they are in the European Union, the Poles will be slaves. They will wipe the buttocks of German women or else sweep the streets of this country.&quot; On the other hand, most political observers believed (correctly) that the Polish would vote in favour of membership, and as a populist party Samoobrona was unhappy about the likelihood of being on the losing side. In the end, the party fought a rather ambiguous campaign, with its posters carrying the slogan &quot;the decision belongs to you&quot;. As a result, Andrzej Lepper promoted a flexible stance on the European Union where he often criticised the organisation, yet was not inherently opposed to joining it; he explained:

In 2005, Samoobrona was a founding member of the EUDemocrats (EUD) pan-European political party, which professes to unite &quot;EU-critical&quot; parties committed to increased democratization and decentralization. The EUDemocrats&#x27; political platform argued that European integration was leading Europe towards a centralised unitary state. Integration was seen as the consequence of a permissive consensus of &quot;furtive elites who had blindfolded citizens&quot;. The party sought to restore the principle of subsidiarity, believing that too much had already been ceded to the EU and had to be recovered. It promoted the concept of &quot;flexible integration&quot;, which would allow countries to use enhanced cooperation procedures only when they wished, without the possibility of forcing cooperation on all members. Only &quot;truly cross-border issues&quot; were to be dealt with at the EU level, defined as guaranteeing the four fundamental freedoms and a common environmental policy. In its program, the EUD also wanted to exclude several policy areas from the competences of the EU, notably common trade policy, education, cultural policy and common foreign policy. The party was described as presenting a position of &quot;minimalist Eurorealism&quot;, seeking to transform the EU into a free trade area with minimal supranational competences. A cooperation agreement between states was to replace the EU Constitution, with the option for states to opt for a simple free trade agreement without other EU obligations. The party was concerned about parliamentary control, the environment and minimum social standards, and strongly distrusted any European military role. It was seen as a key statement of left-wing Euroscepticism, in line with Samoobrona&#x27;s political position.

Samoobrona sought support from these social groups that found themselves impoverished in the new capitalist, post-community Polish economy. As such, low-skilled workers, those living in rural or impoverished areas and unemployed were the main base of the party. The support of the party was strongest in rural and agricultural areas. Samoobrona failed to win the support of strongly conservative constituencies, and a significant number of Samoobrona were left-wing or formerly socialist. Agricultural and blue-collar workers built the backbone of the party&#x27;s voting base, while white-collar workers generally held negative views of the party. A correlation to religion was also found - devout Catholics were much more likely to vote for Samoobrona than atheists or those with ambiguous attitude towards religion. The party&#x27;s electorate was overwhelmingly left-wing as Samoobrona appealed to groups that felt alienated by all other political parties - this included left-wing Eurosceptics and the poorest layers of Polish society. The electorate of Samoobrona was much more left-wing than that of any other Polish political party and non-voters.

Throughs its radical populism and confrontational, direct action in &quot;protection of the &quot;poor and the disadvantaged&quot;, Samoobrona distinguished itself as a party that appealed to the &quot;losers&quot; of the capitalist transition. Samoobrona was labeled as a radical populist-left party and focused on socio-economic issues, sidelining religious and cultural aspects in favor of targeting socially marginalized and economically struggling groups. The party was considered &quot;anti-elitist, anti-institutional, anti-procedural and de facto anti-democratic, in the sense attached to democracy in liberal representative democracies&quot;. While some political commentators disparagingly called Samoobrona &quot;a party of losers&quot; and claimed that it was mainly supported by failed entrepreneurs and unsuccessful middle class, the party was mostly supported by the &quot;excluded, lost, and helpless&quot;. Samoobrona had a similar voter base with the far-right League of Polish Families, with both parties being overwhelmingly supported by poor rural voters and other groups languishing under free market reforms. However, whereas support for the League of Polish Families was strongly determined by church attendance, support for Samoobrona was determined by low income instead.

===Economics===
Samoobrona had a protectionist attitude toward the country&#x27;s economy. They wanted to take higher custom tariffs on foreign goods. Party opted for controlling of Narodowy Bank Polski by Sejm. Additionally, the party&#x27;s leader Andrzej Lepper was in favor of reintroducing PGRs which were state-owned and controlled homesteads existing during the communist era in Poland. Samoobrona called itself &quot;the voice of all social groups which, as a result of the reforms of the 1990s, have found themselves on the edge of poverty and despair&quot; and in 2002, Andrzej Lepper stated: &quot;I am the voice of the poor, deprived and humiliated … Self-Defence and Andrzej Lepper never were, are not, and never will be ‘them’. We are ‘us’.&quot; Samoobrona became famous for its disdain towards the minister that carried out a neoliberal transformation of Polish economy into a capitalist one, Leszek Balcerowicz; Samoobrona coined the slogan &quot;Balcerowicz must go&quot; (), and denounced Balcerowicz as &quot;the greatest pest, destroyer, traitor&quot;.

The party also expressed vehement opposition to capitalism, stating that &quot;capitalism is the primacy of capital and profit over labour and man&quot; and arguing that &quot;capitalism is that system which has already outlived itself&quot;. Lepper declared that Samoobrona was an anti-capitalist party, arguing that capitalism results in &quot;degenerate consumerism&quot;. Samoobrona stated that it desires &quot;a strong state that will deservedly command the respect of all citizens, as a guarantor of their security, and thus create a structure with which they will want to identify&quot;. The party promotes an economic program that mixes agrarianism with economic nationalism, socialism, and religious elements. Central to the party&#x27;s economic agenda is its complete rejection of capitalism - Samoobrona rejects both commerce and the market itself. According to Vít Hloušek and Lubomír Kopeček, the program of the party also incorporates anarchist elements. The party is very close ideologically to radical left-wing agrarian formations from the era of Second Polish Republic. Rhetorically, Samoobrona also includes a strongly Catholic moralist message, calling for a return of supposedly abandoned Catholic and humanitarian values, and wishes to fight &quot;satanic&quot; values in society such as consumerism.

According to Luke March, the party promoted a radical anti-globalisation and anti-neoliberal rhetoric and closely embraced trade unions, with the resulting economic program being an agrarian socialist and left-wing populist vision. Samoobrona promoted a highly interventionist system and wanted to replace materialism and consumerism with a closer relationship with the natural environment, including &quot;the preservation of small-scale
family farms and a humane treatment of animals&quot;. Party members made reference to terms such as &quot;eco-development&quot; and &quot;econology&quot;, which aimed to promote ecology, Catholic ethics and morality in both economics and politics. The main concept of the party&#x27;s economic ideology was social justice; in its 1999 manifesto the party stated: &quot;We want a Poland, in which there will not be such drastic material differences: no so-called ‘ocean of destitution’ with tiny islands of wealth and well-being&quot;.

In 1994, the program of Samoobrona stated: &quot;Capitalism is not a perpetual system. It must give way to new concepts of human relations, to a new ecological morality. A new post-capitalist era is already being born&quot;. The postulates of Andrzej Lepper and his party were egalitarian, emphasising above all the need for a fair redistribution of wealth and the subordination of the economy and its mechanisms to serve social and common good. The party strongly demanded state intervention in the economy, and stressed the need to apply protectionist customs aimed at protecting the interests of domestic producers. Lepper argued that in the light of the experience of capitalist countries, it was dangerous to &quot;succumb to dogmatic thinking consisting in an unwavering belief in the superiority of capitalist free market mechanisms in all areas of economic life&quot;. Samoobrona argued that the adherence of post-communist Polish governments to dogmatic capitalism had led to the abandonment of the basic tasks of the state and the violation of essential human rights.

The party is generally considered to have been the most critical, and even negative, of the post-1989 transition into a market economy. Samoobrona strongly opposed deregulation and privatisation, and wanted to reverse these actions. Samoobrona also promoted anti-globalization rhetoric, believing that neoliberal economics first and foremost serves the international financial institutions and leads to a situation where &quot;a few hundred companies in the world want to dominate everything&quot;. Referring to the Marxist doctrine, Lepper believed that &quot;he who has power has ownership of the means of production&quot;. The party believed that public ownership should have supremacy over any kind of private property, arguing that &quot;private property cannot be treated as privileged, sacred and inviolable&quot;. The party also proposed restoration of state monopolies, including total state ownership of raw materials, mining industries, the energy sector, armaments, transport infrastructure, banking and insurance, as well as lottery, spirits and tobacco industry, regarded by the party as important sources of budget revenue.

Samoobrona attributed great importance to trade unions and cooperatives, arguing that its heritage dating back to the 19th century was destroyed in 1990. The party accused Polish politicians of destroying Polish cooperatives, including entities with such long-standing traditions as &quot;Społem&quot; and &quot;Samopomoc Chłopska&quot;, arguing that individual governments did not try to counteract the discriminatory practices applied to cooperatives by banks and other institutions. Co-operatives, according to Samoobrona, should benefit from fiscal facilities and the state should undertake the task of stimulating the dying co-operative movement. Samoobrona argued that trade unions and rural cooperatives are to fulfill a very important economic role, and credited these groups with enforcing several pro-worker reforms in Western countries.

One of the key properties of the party&#x27;s economic ideology was its positive assessment of socialism and communism. Lepper believed that there is no point in &quot;ritual condemnations of Soviet Communism&quot; and argued that the atrocities of Joseph Stalin should be seen as degeneration of communist doctrine rather than the result of it. In regards to the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, Lepper stated: &quot;...I do not agree (...) that those 45 years were lost for Poland, that today we are starting from scratch&quot;. The party had a particularly high opinion of Edward Gierek&#x27;s rule, which was regarded as a time of modernisation based on Western models. The intransigent critics of the communist period, located in the Law and Justice party and the Solidarity movement, were described by Samoobrona as &quot;extreme right-wing&quot;. Mirosław Karwat considered Samoobrona to be &quot;probably the only political party that speaks well of Communist Poland&quot;.

===Social issues===
Because of the diverse nature of the party that tried to mix Catholic, socialist, agrarian and populist currents, Samoobrona often avoided taking a clear stance on social issues. Samoobrona was based on the social teaching of Catholic Church, but at the same time presented an eclectic stance on social issues and tried to incorporate both political Catholic and socially left-wing thought. As the result, the program of the party was not linked to an authoritarian position on socio-cultural matters, and the leader of the party claimed to support freedom of religion and conscience. However, some political scientists argue that Samoobrona espouses &quot;a kind of social conservatism&quot; similar to one of Polish communists of the late 1980s, represented by the Patriotic Movement for National Rebirth. Political scientists Michael Minkenberg and Pascal Perrineau noted that while Samoobrona evades easy programmatic classification on social issues, a part of its agrarian appeal and &quot;common-man&quot; identity was built on nationalism, &quot;cultural traditionalism&quot; and authoritative protectionism.

Samoobrona argued that the values of the Catholic Church should be embedded in the Polish education and law; consequently, the party opposed abortion, euthanasia and decriminalization of drugs such as marijuana. It opposed death penalty, likewise citing the need to follow Catholic social teaching. As a part of its anti-abortion stance, the party advocated for full protection of life from conception to natural death as a constitutional provision. In 2005, one of demands to President-elect Lech Kaczyński was to add this provision, together with implementing minimum subsistence benefits for the unemployed, abolishing taxes for incomes below the subsistence level, and withdrawing Polish troops from Iraq. The party had more defined, leftist positions on other matters. Samoobrona was declared in its party platform to legalize civil unions to same-sex couples. Alongside SLD it was the only party who voted in favor of a bill embracing civil unions in 2004. The party also opposed decommunization policies, with both members and supporters of Samoobrona being most opposed to decommunization out of all parties. In October 2002, Samoobrona passed a bill that exempted communist intelligence and counter-intelligence collaborators from lustration (exclusion from civil service positions). This made the party be considered as the &quot;most post-communist&quot; party in Polish politics.

On social issues, Samoobrona was considered to be highly flexible; Lepper mainly focused on pressing his anti-establishment credentials, promoting Catholic social values and courting Catholic media such as Radio Maryja. At the same time, Lepper expressed his support for legalizing same-sex partnerships, an anathema to Christian conservatives. Lepper also made overtures with left-wing parties such as the Polish Socialist Party led by Piotr Ikonowicz and the democratic-socialist National Party of Retirees and Pensioners, proposing to establish &quot;a worker–peasant alliance&quot;. Perhaps the best illustration of the Samoobrona&#x27;s ideological flexibility is that despite leading an agrarian and anti-liberal movement, Lepper also promoted environmentalism. Lepper received the Albert Schweitzer Medal from New York-based Animal Welfare Institute in the early 2000s, and Samoobrona was praised by American animal activists. Lepper stated that animals must be &quot;treated with respect, dignity and sympathy&quot; and condemned modern methods of meat production as &quot;concentration camps for animals&quot;.

Because of the overwhelmingly diverse electorate and the impossibility of developing a unified position in the most intense debates regarding ethics and religion within the party, Samoobrona tries not to proclaim an unequivocal view on social issues, often simply avoiding taking any position in the public debate. Lepper only emphasised that Catholic ethics and the achievements of the Church are an important element of the cultural heritage shaping national and regional identity. Mateusz Piskorski argued that on social matters, Samoobrona often presented moderate or centre-left views. The party had the most left-wing electorate out of all Polish political parties, including social-democratic and socialist ones. The party made constant appeals to social justice and poor living conditions while dismissing complaints of moral decline as false and alarmist. The party supported milder sentences and argued that it is pointless to see the new generation and cultural currents as the source of crime; instead, Samoobrona stated that crime is caused &quot;no education, no job, no vision for the future&quot; and decried capitalist transition in Poland for creating a &quot;criminogenic&quot; environment.

One of the most debates social topics in Polish politics was the issue of abortion. Samoobrona&#x27;s position on this issue is rather moderate; as in many other cases, Andrzej Lepper pointed to the social sources of the large number of abortions, related to social exclusion and poverty. Jacek Raciborski argues that statements by the leader of Samoobrona indicated that he was closer to a moderate liberal position on this issue. As such, Samoobrona made statements regarding not only the ethical aspects of the issue, but also the demographic dimension of the problem was emphasised. In 2005, the party was in favour of retaining the wording of the abortion legislation at the time, considering it a valuable compromise reached on this issue. The contemporary system for the protection of children&#x27;s rights and the prevention of domestic violence has also provoked discussions on the possibility of additional criminalisation of violence against children. Samoobrona in 2005 supported a bill prepared by the offices of the Commissioner for Equal Status of Women and Men to introduce a ban on physical punishment of minors.

Regarding the issue of the LGBT community, Piskorski argued that &quot;it is rather difficult to find any homophobic themes in the program enunciations and speeches of Samoobrona politicians&quot;. Lepper stressed that he was in favour of allowing the organisation of pride parades, although he stipulated that they should not provide an opportunity for speech that could be considered &quot;demoralising&quot;. Lepper argued that the existence of sexual minorities was a normal phenomenon that there was no point in stigmatising in any way, and stated his neutrality on the issue of granting homosexual couples the possibility to marry and adopt children. Unlike politicians of the far right, Lepper did not regard homosexuality as a disease, and called it &quot;a certain genetic predisposition that occurs in every era&quot;. Nevertheless, the problem of sexual minorities was sometimes consciously marginalised by Samoobrona politicians; it was argued that some left-wing formations gave it too much importance, and thus pushed far more important issues concerning the social and economic rights of the majority of citizens into the background.

Although Samoobrona has repeatedly been accused of nationalist or even xenophobic tendencies, the party did not devote much space in its public activities to the issue of national and ethnic minorities. The understanding of the nation preferred by the party leaders was not ethnocentric and exclusivist in nature; the national community was treated as &quot;a collectivity constituted by ties of culture, tradition and history, and not by common origin&quot;. Lepper argued for the necessity of equal rights for all minorities with other Polish citizens, deeming property claims based on nationality to be unjustified. The party also had a notable regionalist movement, and some Samoobrona politicians discussed the problem of Silesians, regarded as a nation on its own that was often marginalised or suppressed. In 2007, Samoobrona proposed to recognize the Silesian language as an official regional language in Poland. Starting in the early 2000s, Lepper also became a spokesman for the Belarusian minority in Poland, pledging to fight for the subsidies taken away from the Belarusian Socio-Cultural Association as part of the austerity measures imposed by the Polish government. He argued that the development of ethnic minorities in Poland is endangered as they had no chance of survival in the absence of adequate funding. Lepper also stated that Samoobrona wants to be an advocate for national minorities, which sparked speculation in the media that Samoobrona wants to replace other left-wing parties in the role of an advocate for Polish minorities. This was reflected by Samoobrona becoming the preferred party of the Ukrainian minority in Poland. The regionalist wing split off from Samoobrona in 2007, creating the Party of Regions.

The party also spoke in favour of gender equality while in the Sejm, surprising political commentators with its progressive stance, as the party assigned the blame for social ills on systemic problems, rather than the decline of the traditional family. In 2004, Samoobrona&#x27;s member of parliament Włodzimierz Czechowski said:

In regards to electoral law, the party was a staunch supporter of proportional representation. Samoobrona spoke on 2000s attempts to reform the Polish electoral law by right-wing Law and Justice (PiS); in July 2006, PiS submitted the electoral reform to the Speaker of the Sejm - the law introduced blocks of lists in municipalities with over 20 000 inhabitants, with the simultaneous application of the d&#x27;Hondt method in the intra-group distribution of votes for seats and the rule that groups of lists which received at least 10% of the validly cast votes could participate in the distribution of seats at all levels of local government elections. This law was criticised for undeservedly favouring the strongest parties of the bloc, giving them a significant over-representation in future councils and assemblies. Despite forming a coalition government with PiS at the time, Samoobrona also opposed this law, and called for abandonment of the D&#x27;Hondt method in favour of a more proportional apportionment method; Sainte-Laguë method used in the 2001 Polish parliamentary election was seen as the best and more proportional alternative at the time.

The party was considered to have some disdain for democracy. This was expressed through Lepper&#x27;s remark that &quot;There&#x27;s too much talk about democracy - people can see it&#x27;s only for elites. Only 5% of the population have made any money out of it at the expense of all the others. People have had enough...&quot; While Samoobrona was considered anti-institutional, anti-procedural and anti-democratic, its opposition to democracy specifically applied to opposing liberal democracy in particular. The party called Polish regime a &quot;sham democracy&quot; that they portrayed as a de facto oligarchy, where &quot;Poles voted for different parties and still Balcerowicz popped out of the ballot box&quot;. Samoobrona proposed a new parliamentary form of democracy where the president would be elected by universal suffrage but limited by a special &quot;presidential council&quot; appointed by the parliament. Polish Senate was to be replaced with a special, socio-professional chamber consisting of local governments and trade unions. Lastly, Samoobrona emphasized the need to introduce local self-government, especially to culturally unique regions and nations such as Silesia and Kashubia.

===Foreign policy===
One of the leading demands of Samoobrona in the field of foreign policy was the demand for its full economisation. This process was to involve a move away from ideological principles to a calculation based solely on estimating the benefits of trade with specific countries. The political assessment of a foreign economic partner was not to be given any importance; the only binding criterion for assessing foreign policy should be the growth of Polish exports and the possibilities for Polish entities to derive financial benefits. Samoobrona opposed integration of Poland into EU and NATO, and instead promoted strong relationship with Russia, Belarus and China. The party called for defence of Polish sovereignty from international corporations and financial institutions, seeing them as instruments of foreign interests. Samoobrona denounced the European Union as a form of colonialism, and instead promoted autarky. It warned against Polish membership in the EU, arguing that Poland would become &quot;a third-class country, and in a semi-colonial way, a provider of young workers for the ageing EU societies and a market for the production surpluses of the EU countries&quot;.

An additional, complementary field of action for diplomacy was to combat negative stereotypes of Poles in other countries, described by Samoobrona as anti-Polish. According to the party, it should be the duty of Polish diplomats, as well as politicians sitting in the European Parliament, to oppose negative stereotypes and historical falsifications, such as the use of the phrase &quot;Polish concentration camps&quot; in foreign journalism. An important role as ambassador of Polish interests abroad was attributed to the Polish diasporas scattered around the world. It was postulated that Polish diasporas should be covered by state aid and be given the opportunity to return to their homeland. Samoobrona supported a bill providing the possibility for representatives of the Polish minority abroad to obtain Karta Polaka, arguing that the survival of Polish culture and language should be a reason for respect for Poles living abroad. The repatriation operation of Kazakhstan residents of Polish origin also met with the party&#x27;s support.

Many authors and commentators, both Polish and foreign ones, considered Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland to be a Eurosceptic party. This was due to the party&#x27;s protectionist and nationalist program, which many commentators considered Eurosceptic by nature. According to some authors, labelling Samoobrona as a Eurosceptic party was legitimate given opinion polls, which showed that in terms of opposition to Poland&#x27;s accession to the EU, Samoobrona were only slightly less hostile to EU than the LPR voters. However, while for the LPR the issue of European integration was one of the most important ones, in the case of Samoobrona, the issue of EU did not play an important role.

Lepper argued that Samoobrona&#x27;s criticism of the EU accession was exclusively related to the conditions of Poland&#x27;s membership in the Union, and not a negation of the purposefulness of integration processes as such. The basis of Samoobrona&#x27;s position was based on a set of beliefs characteristic of the so-called economic Euroscepticism. The party&#x27;s declared pragmatism in assessing the consequences of possible membership was characteristic, and the inconsistency of views and assessments on European integration was most likely linked to the existence of diverse attitudes on the issue among both party members and supporters themselves, which became particularly evident after 1 May 2004, when some Samoobrona members became beneficiaries of the EU Common Agricultural Policy. Because of the lack of decisive and conclusive enunciations on Poland&#x27;s membership in the Union, J. Sielski described the party&#x27;s position on European integration as &quot;Euro-populist&quot;.

The leader of Samoobrona himself preferred to call his stance on Poland&#x27;s participation in the European integration process &quot;Eurorealism&quot;, and directed his criticism of the unfavourable provisions of the Accession Treaty at Polish governments and negotiators rather than European Commission officials. According to Piskorski, given the presence of a number of features which would indeed make it possible to classify the party into the Eurorealist camp (an ambivalent attitude to the accession, the secondary role of this issue in programme pronouncements, variability of rhetoric resulting from the assessment of the mood of the electorate), &quot;such self-identification seems to be largely justified&quot;.

The party took a moderately sceptical stance on the introduction of a common European currency in Poland. According to Lepper, accession to the Monetary Union would be advisable only on the condition that Poland achieves a level of economic development similar to that of Western European countries; otherwise, depriving the National Bank of Poland of the ability to shape monetary policy poses a threat to the country&#x27;s sovereignty in this fundamental area. In addition, it was argued that the price effects of the introduction of the euro would be unacceptable to Polish society. The party&#x27;s experts argued that the countries that had not decided to join the euro area maintained a higher level of economic development while avoiding the price increases that the introduction of the common currency would have caused.

The party declared its support for the process of further enlargement of the European Union, in contrast to right-wing parties, allowing membership to be granted not only to Ukraine, but also to Turkey. The commencement of negotiations with the latter country was supported by the majority of Samoobrona MEPs, who voted in favour of the relevant resolution. Unlike some right-wing parties, Samoobrona did not make support for a country&#x27;s EU membership dependent on its cultural face and civilisational affiliation, but only on the fulfilment of formal membership conditions. On the other hand, it declared that the country&#x27;s admission to the EU should not be at the expense of the funds allocated to Poland, which led R. Czarnecki to conclude that rather unhurried negotiations were necessary.

The participation of Polish soldiers in the NATO operation in Afghanistan was consistently contested by Samoobrona. The main arguments cited were the cost of warfare and the risk of loss of life of Polish soldiers. Samoobrona was very consistently and strongly opposed to the Iraq War. It was the only Polish party which as late as at the turn of 2002 and 2003 (before the invasion began) stated its expression to war. After the invasion of Iraq and the overthrow of Hussein&#x27;s government, Lepper suggested that the forces of the international coalition should be replaced by peacekeeping formations operating under the aegis of the United Nations. In a petition addressed to then President Aleksander Kwaśniewski, Samoobrona also drew attention to the contradictory nature of the operation in Iraq against international law. It was emphasised that a sovereign country, posing no threat, even potential, to Poland&#x27;s security, had been attacked. The war in Iraq was described as &quot;aggressive&quot; and constituting a violation of international standards.

The party was also described as pro-Russian, anti-NATO and anti-EU. Describing the party, German political scientist Nikolaus Werz wrote that Samoobrona &quot;rejects globalisation, criticises the free market economy and strikes a protectionist, socialist and nationalist tone. There are also pro-Russian tendencies and a noticeable nostalgia for the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland. Lepper is an opponent of Poland&#x27;s membership of NATO and the EU.&quot; Marijuš Antonovič wrote that League of Polish Families and Samoobrona were two Polish parties &quot;which did not hide their pro‑Moscow foreign policy views&quot;; Andrzej Lepper was awarded two honoris causa doctoral titles in Russia, and Samoobrona members were invited to Russia by the Russian government for common projects. In its program, Samoobrona also emphasized that it attached particular importance to Polish relations with Russia, and condemned emerging tensions between two countries as an attempt to cut off Poland from trade and make it fall into economic domination of the Western countries. The party&#x27;s deputy, Bolesław Borysiuk, presented a plan of establishing &quot;Joint Polish-Russian Commission for Trade and Economic Cooperation&quot;, which would foster cooperation with Russia at regional level and also establish a joint Polish-Russian bank that would finance trade.

Samoobrona promoted ties with Russia in culture and science; this sympathy was extended to Ukraine as well as Belarus, with Lepper stating that Poland should only enter the EU together with Ukraine, stressing the &#x27;brotherhood&#x27; of both countries. In regards to Belarus, Samoobrona wanted to normalise Polish relations with the Belarusian president Lukashenko, and thus persistently distanced itself from any negative assessments of the Belarusian government, often condemning allegations of human and civil rights violations as either fake or exaggerated. In 2005, the party condemned &quot;ethnic hatred&quot; incited by the Union of Poles in Belarus and declared its support for Lukashenko. In 1999, Samoobrona also protested NATO attacks on Yugoslavia, stating that &quot;NATO rejected the mask of a defence pact and became a gendarme, guarding the interests of international finance&quot;. In 2005, Russian philosopher Aleksandr Dugin referred to Samoobrona as &quot;the only pro-Russian party in Poland&quot;. Similar conclusion was reached by the Czech political scientist Marek Čejka, who wrote that Samoobrona &quot;was often considered the party in parliament most favourable to the idea of Polish-Russian cooperation.&quot; The party was also critical of Americanism and Atlanticism of the Polish government, and promoted friendly relations with China in addition to supporting Russia.

Commenting on the 2023 Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, Samoobrona called the Gaza Strip &quot;a strip of shame for the US and for the world&quot;. The party also declared its support for Catalan independence and Scottish independence. In its 2024 program, the party praised Palestine and Kurdistan, calling them &quot;great nations&quot; that are &quot;constantly fighting for land, territory and the international community is deaf to these efforts.&quot;

===Religion===
Samoobrona strongly emphasised its attachment to Roman Catholicism, particularly valuing the authority of Pope John Paul II; the leader of Samoobrona highlighted his visits to the Vatican, emphasising that he considered the Pope to be a morally unquestionable authority. In numerous party programme documents issued over the course of several years, there were frequent references to the achievements of John Paul II and attempts to interpret Polish socio-economic reality in terms of the pope&#x27;s proposed ethical standards. In interpreting the Pope&#x27;s teaching, Samoobrona particularly accentuated those that included criticism of capitalism.

The party was particularly attached to the declaration of Pope John Paul II from 1991, stating: &quot;It is unacceptable to claim that, after the defeat of real socialism, capitalism remained the only model of economic organisation&quot;. Samoobrona often repeated and highlighted this quote. The party argued that the downfall of communist Poland was not caused by its socialist economy, but rather by state atheism and its hostility towards the Catholic Church and its social teaching. Samoobrona contrasted this with its own socialism, which it described as based on agrarianism, patriotism and the Catholic social teaching. The party believed that this kind of Polish socialism, based on nationalist and religious tradition, would be the best possible system for Poland. The party promoted an utopian vision of &quot;Polish socialism&quot; based on small family farms, rural co-operatives, an end to the exploitation of the countryside and nationalised industry, with peasants being considered the &quot;healthiest element of society, both biologically and morally&quot;.

In the party&#x27;s program there is a whole series of declarations and sometimes direct references to the concepts proclaimed by Catholic social teaching. In 1995, Lepper declared that &quot;the indications in the Encyclicals of John Paul II, especially in the Encyclical &quot;Laborem Exercens&quot;, became an inspiration for us in the formulation of our professional and social programmes&quot;, lamenting the insufficient presentation of the achievements of Catholic social teaching in the mass media. The social teaching of the Church was to provide an alternative to capitalism and neoliberalism; in this case, reference was made not only to papal encyclicals, but also to the sermons of Cardinal Wyszyński, in which the postulate of Poland&#x27;s embarking on its own path of social and economic development, resulting from its specific tradition, was found. The party&#x27;s program from 2003 also stated: &quot;The Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland is guided by the social teaching of the Church and fully shares the indications of the greatest moral authority of our times, Pope John Paul II, contained in his encyclicals&quot;.

Samoobrona also self-identified as Christian left, claiming to represent a broad group of both Catholic and secular left; Lepper stated: &quot;A social economy, free education, culture, education and health care, decent living conditions for pensioners, blocking the negative effects of globalisation, caring for the environment - these are just selected examples of leftism in state policy.&quot; However, the party rejected National Catholicism, and Lepper rejected the view of National Catholic circles that the Church and Roman Catholics are being discriminated and excluded from the public life of Poland, calling such criticisms &quot;too alarmist and exaggerated&quot;.

The party used a lot of religious rhetoric in regards to economic issues, presenting anti-capitalist, anti-liberal, anti-&quot;cosmopolitan&quot; and anti-market ideas. The key foundation of economic ideology of Samoobrona was a combination of socialism with the principles of Catholic social teaching, rejecting capitalism as &quot;fiscal repression and total commercialisation&quot; while also strongly attacking a &quot;reductionist&quot; economic-theoretical approach, typical of the &quot;Anglo-Germanic mentality&quot; and based on the &quot;Protestant dogma of predestination&quot;. As a counter-proposal, the party praised &quot;econology&quot;, defined as the prioritisation of ecology in economic thinking. The post-1989 socioeconomic situation in Poland was described as &quot;socio-economic satanism&quot; or &quot;economic genocide&quot;, and the party manifesto read: &quot;All the tragedies that the Poles are experiencing ... are the consequence of the loss of their own sovereignty and the subordination of the country to foreign interests, as carried out by a group of venal politicians who, thanks to political fraud and by lying to the Polish people, have been able to make their own decisions. are the consequence of the loss of their own sovereignty and the subordination of the country to foreign interests, as carried out by a group of venal politicians who have brought themselves to power thanks to political fraud and by lying to the voters.&quot; However, Samoobrona is explicitly socialist and not only sympathises with the former People&#x27;s Republic of Poland, but openly identifies with its communist form of society and socialist ideals.

Despite its attachment to Catholicism, the party also made statements critical of the church. Lepper deplored the attitude of a part of the Catholic hierarchy, for example by criticising the lack of interest of Primate Józef Glemp in a meeting with the party&#x27;s delegation. During the transformation period, the Polish bishops were accused of lacking social sensitivity, and of being materialistic and building a financial empire; Lepper went as far as stating that &quot;they value money more than God&quot;. Glemp was criticised by Samoobrona for his lack of concern for the fate of Polish farmers, above all in the context of the Primate&#x27;s statements suggesting support for police interventions against participants of agricultural blockades. Additionally, Andrzej Lepper expressed some understanding for the demands appearing in the 1990s in the circles of secular left for excluding religious instruction from public schools.

Political scientists compared Samoobrona to socialist and far-left movements of Latin America. Paweł Przyłęcki argued that the party &quot;had all the main elements of the populist and socialist policies pursued in Latin American countries, particularly Argentina&quot;. One of the elements typical for far-left Latin American political discourse that Samoobrona was seen as incorporating is liberation theology. While conceptually communism was considered incompatible with Catholicism as it disrupted sociocultural traditions that the Church relied on, the relationship of between Catholicism and communist policies was complex and widely differed depending on the attitude of the local regime towards religion. While liberation theology was much less influential in Poland than in Latin America, highly popular Polish Pope John Paul II espoused liberation theology that avoided Marxist language. Gerald J. Beyer wrote in The American Journal of Economics and Sociology that social teaching of John Paul II echoed central points of liberation theology; John Paul II wrote that the Church tradition is “in clear opposition to capitalism as a socioeconomic system as well as a general system of values” and affirmed that despite its flaws, communism correctly recognizes humans as social being while condemning liberalism for seeing humans as “isolated” being who enter into relationships only for “egocentric interests”. While rejecting its atheistic and materialistic characteristics, John Paul II stated that Marxism had a “kernel of truth” regarding the need for common possession of goods and rejection of capitalism as an inherently inhumane and exploitative system. Samoobrona represented a radicalized version of papal teaching, fully endorsing the social teaching of John Paul II on one hand, while praising the communist Polish People&#x27;s Republic on the other.

On the other hand, the group supported the ratification of the concordat with the Holy See, accepting &quot;the unique position of the Catholic Church vis-à-vis other confessions in Poland&quot;. Given the much higher level of religiosity in rural areas, Samoobrona&#x27;s leaders often appeared at religious ceremonies without political risk and even gained some support, for example on the occasion of the Jasna Góra Harvest Festival. This did not prevent them from criticising those representatives of the Episcopate who were critical of the agricultural protests co-organised by Samoobrona. On the other hand, party politicians emphasised that they boasted the sympathy of a large proportion of parish priests in rural parishes. The party&#x27;s electorate, according to available surveys, was heterogeneous on issues related to the desirable nature of state-church relations. While it was possible to discern among party sympathisers supporters of limiting the role of the Church as an institution in public life (e.g. those advocating the abolition of the Church Fund), anticlerical sentiments did not turn into attempts to negate the ethical message of the Roman Catholic Church.

===Ecology===
Besides Samoobrona&#x27;s invocations of Catholic socialism and &#x27;patriotic socialism&#x27;, Lepper also made remarks towards green socialism. He stressed the environmentalist character of the party, explaining that he founded Samoobrona &quot;because the spectre of economic and biological doom is staring us in the face&quot;. In a 1993 interview, he stated:

Despite its agrarian character, Samoobrona also identified with the green movement, and environmentalists were an important part of Lepper&#x27;s social and political circle; Samoobrona was founded not only by agrarian trade unions, but a minor Polish green party as well. Party&#x27;s program promoted the concepts of &quot;eco-development&quot; and &quot;econology&quot;, which were described as replacement of consumerism and materialism in favour of &quot;a closer relationship with the natural environment, the preservation of small-scale family farms and a humane treatment of animals&quot;. Samoobrona stated that it desired to introduce new ways of thinking into Polish economics that would encompass ecology, social ethics and Catholic morality. Concrete environmentalist proposals included in the party&#x27;s program were opposition to agroindustrial development and &#x27;intensive farming methods&#x27;.

Rafał Soborski listed Samoobrona as an example of an anti-globalization environmentalist movement, using rhetoric aligned with green movements - Samoobrona attacked corporations for pursuing profit-driven policies that are harmful to both the environment and the well-being of the society. Both greens and Samoobrona considered international corporations responsible for global inequality and exploitation, imprisoning &quot;the majority of people in impoverished enclaves [in order to] move production there&quot;. This anti-corporation rhetoric also had cultural and nationalist themes, as anti-globalization and ecological movements attacked the progressing &quot;McDonaldization of society&quot; that contradicted and threatened national and local identities. Samoobrona mixed environmentalist undertones with agrarian issues, accusing big companies of destroying Polish farming by flooding the Polish market with foreign, poor-quality products. The party campaigned for expelling foreign capital in Poland in order to protect native farms and local products.

In 1999, Samoobrona entered a coalition with the American-based Animal Welfare Institute against Smithfield Foods, American food company that wanted to enter the Polish market. Samoobrona organised a conference together with AWI in May 2000, promoting ecology and alternatives to industrial farming. At the same time, Samoobrona steadily incorporated more ecological and animal welfare themes into its program. Later in 2000, AWI-Samoobrona movement was endorsed by the president of Polish National Veterinary Chamber, Bartosz Winiecki, who recruited Polish veterinarians to the anti-Smithfield coalition. In the end, six thousands Polish doctors of veterinary medicine and twenty thousand veterinary technicians joined the coalition&#x27;s protests. 

Samoobrona&#x27;s activities proved crucial to bringing about a corporate farming ban in Poland; according to Joe Bandy and Jackie Smith, &quot;the coalition between AWI and Samoobrona represents one of the successful cases in the emerging global justice movement&quot;. For his environmental activism, Lepper was awarded the Albert Schweitzer Medal in 2000. The leader of Samoobrona stated his commitment to animal welfare, stressing that animals must be treated &quot;with respect, dignity and sympathy&quot; and condemning modern meat industry as &quot;concentration camps for animals&quot;. Regarding animal rights, Lepper stated: &quot;The motto that I have adopted and that is adopted by the rest of Samoobrona says that if a person is not capable of loving animals and nature they will never be capable of loving another human being.&quot; He stressed that farm animals have &quot;the right to dignity&quot; and &quot;the right to live without suffering and without being isolated from their natural environment&quot;. He spoke of corporate farming: &quot;[These farms are] concentration camps for hogs. We had concentration camps in Poland before. We will not allow them again.&quot;

The party connected its environmentalist and anti-globalization cause with other elements of its ideology. Samoobrona highlighted that industrial farming companies have no respect for Polish tradition and way of life, noting that such companies destroy the nests of white storks which are considered a national symbol of Poland. On behalf of Samoobrona, an AWI representative stated: &quot;People never destroy them, they believe if you have a nest, lightning will never strike.&quot; Lepper also played on nostalgia towards communist Poland and his party&#x27;s socialist appeal, stating that the industrial farms of foreign corporations are built off the privatization of state-owned farms, the State Agricultural Farms. These farms collapsed in the early 1990s, which led to very high unemployment in the Polish countryside. Samoobrona decried industrial farming and the corporations introducing it in Poland as &quot;cancer&quot;, with Lepper stating that &quot;the company ravages the environment, destroys jobs and traditional society&quot;. Once farming corporations shifted their tactic away from buying Polish land outright (which requires permission from the Polish government) to indirectly controlling farms through taking control of minor Polish companies through EU rules, Samoobrona adopted opposition to the European integration and the European Union as a part of its environmentalist cause.

In line with its alliance with the Animal Welfare Institute, Samoobrona opposes industrial farms of pigs, cattle and poultry; it denounces the practice as unethical and a cause of animal suffering, and also argues that agricultural companies cause significant pollution of the environment and lead to the collapse of small farmers. Lepper criticized the officials of other countries for neglecting environmental causes - in his 1999 Capitol speech, he stated: &quot;I have read Vice President Gore&#x27;s book on environmental protection, but I can see that he writes one thing and does another.&quot; Samoobrona tied its defence of animal rights and Polish small farmers to a larger struggle against international corporations, of which the party wanted trade unionists and environmentalists to also be a part of. Lepper stressed that he &quot;the spokesman for the poor - no longer only the rural poor&quot;, and called for a new &#x27;worker-peasant alliance&#x27; that would incorporate green politics.

Samoobrona was also supported by and collaborated with many minor environmentalist movements in Poland. It worked together with the Federation of the Greens (), the eco-anarchist Federacja Anarchistyczna, as well as the eco-socialist Anticapitalist Offensive (). Common actions that these movements cooperated with Samoobrona with were anti-globalization as well as animal welfare protests. Polish ecologist journal &quot;The Green Brigades&quot; () argued that the alliance of Samoobrona and environmentalists should be not seen as &quot;exotic&quot;, as &quot;it is the peasants and not the representatives of the McWorld on Poland from the only right parties who are our natural allies&quot;. In its statement endorsing the agrarian protests of Samoobrona, Federation of the Greens noted that the economic pressure applied on Polish farmers will exacerbate unemployment and housing shortages as the Polish countryside is already impoverished and lacks access to essential services such as sewerage, well-maintained roads, segregation systems, as well as education and healthcare. It urged environmentalists activists to solidarize with Polish farmers and not &quot;divide trade unions into right and wrong&quot;, and to fight climate change and environmental destruction in alliance with the disadvantaged rather than for the &quot;interests of the import lobby&quot;.

==Successors==
Samoobrona had a profound influence on Polish politics and the party&#x27;s populist rhetoric left a permanent mark on Polish political culture. Sociologist Remigiusz Okraska recalled: &quot;Lepper was the sword that kept hovering over the heads of the complacent scoundrels of Warsaw and Krakow and reminded them - and all of us - that another world existed. A world of closed-down state-owned farms, small towns in decay, which are experiencing civilisational decline, closed-down factories, rural and urban poverty, hungry children and vegetating old people. It is largely thanks to him that today even the establishment media have stopped pretending that it is OK, that we are catching up and overtaking Europe, that there are no real, entrenched and growing social problems. Just 15 years ago, the same media only featured &#x27;successful people&#x27; and the &#x27;hard-working middle class&#x27; and a handful of &#x27;choosing losers&#x27;.&quot; Similarly, historian Jarosław Tomasiewicz described Samoobrona as &quot;plebeian left, organically growing out of the everyday problems of ordinary people&quot; and a &quot;genuinely popular movement, born of grassroots social struggles and not of ideological inspiration, a movement that did not need to &#x27;stylise&#x27; itself and, like the mythological Antaeus of mother-earth, drew its power directly from the people.&quot; The surprising, dark-horse success of Samoobrona and its subsequent downfall continue to be a heavily researched and unique phenomenon in Polish politics, which gave birth to movements that would base themselves off Samoobrona and its rhetoric.

The party had also undergone a major change during its existence in terms of both public perception and ideology. The party started as a loose organization that engaged in a non-conventional and protest profile that brought together workers, the unemployed, pensioners and the poor; the party had both socialists and former communists along with military men and ultranationalists in its ranks. However, the party gradually eschewed its big-tent character in favour of a radically left-wing outlook, which led to Andrzej Lepper dismissing the nationalist wing of the party and calling for a &quot;worker-peasant alliance&quot; that envisioned Samoobrona cooperating together with other left-wing and post-communist parties. This made the party transition from a protest party to a consolidated, extreme-left party based on economic class rhetoric. 
Lepper would call for return to socialism during his 1999 presidential campaign, arguing that it had &quot;not yet reached full maturity&quot;. Consequently, the international media came to see Lepper as &quot;Polish Hugo Chávez&quot;, comparing and finding similarities with their socialist and populist rhetoric. By 2007, the party was considered to be on the extreme end of left-wing spectrum in Poland. This political and ideological transition, in addition to numerous scandals and conflicting decisions such as party&#x27;s choice to cooperate with both left-wing (such as SLD and UP) and right-wing (PiS and LPR) parties resulted in multiple conflicts and splits within Samoobrona, with many dissident groups founding their own political parties. These include:
===Selbstverteidigung===

On 23 August 2002, a sister party of Samoobrona known as Self-Defence (, SV) was founded in Berlin, Germany. It was created by the German businessman of Polish ancestry Heinz Klimczak, who invited Andrzej Lepper to participate in the founding congress of his party and stated that it would be explicitly modelled on the Polish Samoobrona. Lepper attended the founding congress and expressed his delight at how much his views and party had been appreciated and used by Selbstverteidigung. Lepper also stated he had already received similar applications from other Central European countries, and announced his plans to form a &quot;Samoobrona Internationale&quot;, which would unite socialist populist countries across Europe.

Selbstverteidigung adopted the exact same status and program as Samoobrona, and was mainly composed of impoverished East German entrepreneurs, farmers and intellectuals. Klimczak stated that the party serves the &quot;people left to their own devices, cheated by the state&quot;, and explained that the main reasons for the formation of the party in Germany is the very bad situation of the inhabitants of the eastern German states, especially the unemployed. Klimczak himself was a struggling construction entrepreneur and condemned the effects that the capitalist transformation of East German economy had on the poorer parts of the society. Selbstverteidigung decried the economic consequences of the German reunification and argued that it had caused massive layoffs, collapse of Eastern industries, extreme income inequality as well as poverty and hunger. The founding of the party and Lepper&#x27;s participation were initially ignored by local Berlin media. However, the party soon organized public protests and hunger strikes in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.

Lepper stressed the anti-capitalist character of the party, and stated that the founders of the party had been in contact with Samoobrona for a long time. He praised the diverse nature of Selbstverteidigung, composed of struggling entrepreneurs but also farmers and intellectuals. The party noted the growing disproportion between the East Germany and the dominant Western states, and noted the inequal treatment not only on an economic level, but also cultural discrimination which instils the feeling of cultural inferiority amongst East Germans. Lepper also noted that the situation of East Germany is similar to the one of Poland which makes the program of Samoobrona applicable - much like Poland, East Germany had also gone through a transformation from a socialist system to a capitalist market economy, with the subsequent economic growth benefitting the very few while leaving behind millions of financially struggling and unemployed people. The main postulate of the party was to be protection of trade unions and protesting the capitalist transformation of East German states.

Selbstverteidiung used a left-wing and populist-socialist rhetoric that mimicked the one of Samoobrona, demanding a new economic system in Germany that would create conditions for &quot;ordinary people to live with dignity&quot;, and decrying the capitalist order as one that divided society into &quot;very poor and very rich&quot;. The party also stated that it seeks to protect the poorest, as well as the farmers and the middle class, from large corporations. It also proposed an establishment of an economic &quot;third way&quot;, which would restore the positive aspects of the socialist East German system that now impoverished groups depended on, while avoiding the negative excesses. Selbstverteidiung accentuated that the economy should be based on the principle of prioritizing &quot;the human being, the family, a decent life and work&quot;.

In its statement on Selbstverteidigung party, Samoobrona stated that it will support its sister party while also respecting its autonomy and the unique East German conditions, which are nevertheless similar to the Polish situation. Selbstverteidigung was planning to gather at least 10,000 members within 3 months, and contest the 2002 German federal election. However, criminal proceedings were initiated against the party&#x27;s leader, Heinz Klimczak. After Klimczak was accused of economic fraud, Samoobrona decided to keep its communication with its German sister party private, which made the topic disappear from the headlines. The fate of the Selbstverteidigung is unknown. Klimczak was released in December 2002 and stated that the fraud charges were connected to a business partner that Selbstverteidigung wanted to cooperate with. In 2004, Klimczak founded a company in Oberschöneweide that sells traditional Polish delicacies. Andrzej Lepper also developed ties in the Czech Republic, where an attempt to develop a Czech sister party of Samoobrona was made.

<text>Mythologies () is a 1957 book by Roland Barthes. It contains a collection of fifty-three short essays written between 1954 to 1956, most of which were first published in the French literary review &quot;Les Lettres nouvelles&quot;. In these essays, Barthes examines the tendency of contemporary social value systems (specifically that of the bourgeoisie) to create modern myths. In the book Barthes also analyzes the semiology of the process of myth creation itself, updating Ferdinand de Saussure&#x27;s system of sign analysis by adding a second level where signs are elevated to the level of myth.

&quot;Mythologies&quot; was first published in English in abridged form in 1972. In 2012, Hill &amp; Wang published a new English language edition of the book, &quot;Mythologies: The Complete Edition, in a New Translation&quot;, translated by Richard Howard (Part I: Mythologies) and Annette Lavers (Part II: Myth Today). 

==Mythologies==

&quot;Mythologies&quot; is divided into two parts: Mythologies and Myth Today, with the first section consisting of a collection of short essays on selected modern myths, and the second section offering an extended analysis of the concept. Each of the &quot;mythologies&quot; describes a modern cultural phenomena, ranging from &quot;Einstein&#x27;s Brain&quot; to &quot;Soap Powders and Detergents,&quot; chosen for their status as modern myths and for the meaning that has been conferred upon them.

In a typical example, Barthes describes the image that has been built up around red wine and how it has been adopted as a French national drink, how it is seen as a social equaliser and the drink of the proletariat, partly because it is seen as blood-like (as in Holy Communion) and points out that very little attention is paid to red wine&#x27;s harmful effects to health, but that it is instead viewed as life-giving and refreshing — &#x27;in cold weather, it is associated with all the myths of becoming warm, and at the height of summer, with all the images of shade, with all things cool and sparkling.&#x27;

In another chapter, Barthes explores the myth of professional wrestling. He describes how, unlike in the sport of boxing, the aim of theatrical stunt fighting is not to discover who will win or &#x27;a demonstration of excellence&#x27;, it is a staged spectacle acting out society&#x27;s basic concepts of good and evil, of &#x27;Suffering, Defeat and Justice&#x27;. The actors pretending to be wrestlers, like characters in a pantomime, portray grossly exaggerated stereotypes of human weakness: the traitor, the conceited, the &#x27;effeminate teddy-boy&#x27;. The audience expects to watch them suffer and be punished for their own transgressions of wrestling&#x27;s rules in a theatrical version of society&#x27;s ideology of justice.

==Myth today==
In the second half of the book Barthes addresses the question of &quot;What is a myth, today?&quot; with the analysis of ideas such as: myth as a type of speech, and myth as a type of politics.
Following on from the first section, Barthes justifies and explains his choices and analysis. He calls upon the concepts of semiology developed by Ferdinand de Saussure, who described the connections between an object (the signified) and its linguistic representation (such as a word, the signifier) and how the two are connected. Working with this structure Barthes continues to show his idea of a myth as a further sign, with its roots in language, but to which something has been added. So with a word (or other linguistic unit) the meaning (apprehended content) and the sound come together to make a sign. To make a myth, the sign itself is used as a &quot;signifier&quot;, and a new meaning is added, which is the &quot;signified&quot;. But according to Barthes, this is &quot;not&quot; added arbitrarily. Although we are not necessarily aware of it, modern myths are created with a reason. As in the example of the red wine, mythologies are formed to perpetuate an idea of society that adheres to the current ideologies of the ruling class and its media.

Barthes demonstrates this theory with the example of a front cover from &quot;Paris Match&quot; edition no. 326, of July 1955, showing a young black soldier in French uniform saluting. The &quot;signifier&quot;, a saluting soldier, cannot offer us further factual information of the young man&#x27;s life. But it has been chosen by the magazine to symbolise more than the young man; the picture, in combination with the &quot;signifieds&quot; of Frenchness, militariness, and relative ethnic difference, gives us a message about France and its citizens. The picture does not explicitly demonstrate &#x27;that France is a great empire, that all her sons, without any colour discrimination, faithfully serve under her flag,&#x27; etc., but the combination of the signifier and signified perpetuates the myth of imperial devotion, success and thus, a property of &#x27;significance&#x27; for the picture.

=== Myth and power ===
Exploring the concept of myth, Barthes seeks to grasp the relations between language and power. He assumes that myth helps to naturalize particular worldviews.

According to Barthes, myth is based on humans’ history, and myth cannot naturally occur. There are always some communicative intentions in myth. Created by people, myth can easily be changed or destroyed. Also, myth depends on the context where it exists. By changing the context, one can change the effects of myth. At the same time, myth itself participates in the creation of an ideology. According to Barthes, myth doesn&#x27;t seek to show or to hide the truth when creating an ideology, it seeks to deviate from the reality. The major function of myth is to naturalize a concept, a belief. Myth purifies signs and fills them with a new meaning which is relevant to the communicative intentions of those who are creating the myth. In the new sign, there are no contradictions that could raise any doubts regarding the myth. Myth is not deep enough to have these contradictions; it simplifies the world by making people believe that signs have inherent meaning. Myth “abolishes the complexity of human acts, it gives them the simplicity of essences…”

Why do people believe in myth? The power of myth is in its impressive character. It seeks to surprise the audience. This impression is far more powerful than any rational explanations which can disprove the myth. So, myth works not because it hides its intentions, but because the intentions of myth have been naturalized. Through the usage of myths, one can naturalize “the Empire, [the] taste for Basque things, the Government.”

Speaking of myth and power, Barthes asserts that myth is a depoliticized speech. He uses the term ex-nomination (or exnomination), by which he &quot;means &#x27;outside of naming&#x27;. Barthes&#x27; point was that dominant groups or ideas in society become so obvious or common sense that they don&#x27;t have to draw attention to themselves by giving themselves a name. They&#x27;re just the &#x27;normality&#x27;, against which everything else can be judged.&quot; For example, he says, &quot;[the bourgeoisie] makes its status undergo a real &quot;ex-nominating operation&quot;: the bourgeoisie is defined as &quot;the social class which does not want to be named&quot;&quot; (italics in original). Myth removes our understanding of concepts and beliefs as created by humans. Instead, myth presents them as something natural and innocent. Drawing upon Karl Marx, Barthes states that even the most natural objects include some aspect of politics. Depending on how strong the political side of myth is, Barthes defines the strong and the weak myths (&quot;des mythes forts et des mythes faibles&quot;). Depoliticization of the strong myths happens abruptly, as the strong myths are explicitly political. The weak myths are the myths which have already lost their political character. However, this character can be brought back by “the slightest thing”. 
Barthes also provides a list of rhetorical figures in bourgeoisie myths:
* The inoculation. The government admits the harm brought by one of the institutes. Focusing on one institute, myth hides the inconsistency of the system. Inoculation consists in &quot;admitting the accidental evil of a class-bound institution in order to conceal its principal evil.&quot; A &quot;small inoculation of acknowledged evil&quot; protects against &quot;the risk of a generalized subversion.&quot;
* The privation of History. A history standing behind a myth gets removed. People don&#x27;t wonder where the myth comes from; they simply believe it.
* Identification. The ideology of the bourgeoisie seeks sameness and denies all concepts that don&#x27;t fit into its system. The bourgeoisie either ignores subjects that differ from them, or they strive to make this subject the same as the bourgeoisie.
* Tautology. The myths of the bourgeoisie define the concepts through the same concepts (Barthes provides an example of theatre, “Drama is drama”)
* Neither-Norism (&quot;le ninisme)&quot;. Two concepts are defined by each other, and both of the concepts are considered inconsistent.
* The quantification of quality. Myth measures reality by numbers, not by quality. This way, myth simplifies reality.
* The statement of fact. Myth doesn&#x27;t explain the reality. Myth asserts a certain picture of the world without explanation just like a proverb does.

The model of semiosis suggested by Barthes seeks to link signs with the social myths or ideologies that they articulate.

==Mythologisation and cultural studies==
Barthes refers to the tendency of socially constructed notions, narratives, and assumptions to become &quot;naturalized&quot; in the process, that is, taken unquestioningly as given within a particular culture. Barthes concludes &quot;Mythologies&quot; by examining how and why myths are established by the bourgeoisie in its various manifestations. He returns to this theme in later works, including &quot;The Fashion System&quot;.

There are analogies between &quot;Mythologies&quot; (1957) and Marshal McLuhan&#x27;s &quot;The Mechanical Bride&quot; (1951), in which a series popular mass culture products (such as advertisements and magazine articles) are exhibited and critically analyzed.

== English language editions ==
&quot;Mythologies&quot; was first published in English in 1972, translated by Annette Lavers and issued by Jonathan Cape in England and by Hill &amp; Wang in the United States. This abridged English language edition included the book’s explanatory analysis, “Myth Today,” in full, but excluded twenty-five of the book’s original fifty-three essays.

In 2012, Hill &amp; Wang published a new unabridged edition of the book, &quot;Mythologies: The Complete Edition, in a New Translation&quot;, with all fifty-three essays newly translated by Richard Howard, some of which appear in English for the first time. This edition retains Annette Lavers’ full translation of Barthes’ explanatory analysis, “Myth Today,” as the second part of the book.

<text>The Liberal Forum (, LiF) was a centrist, liberal political party in Austria. The party was active from February 1993 to January 2014, when the party merged into NEOS – The New Austria.

A member of the Liberal International and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party, it was founded as a classical liberal split from the FPÖ due to its right-wing populist stances and was placed on the libertarian/post-materialist on a two-axis political spectrum, alongside The Greens – The Green Alternative, in a 2000 comparative analysis among Austrian political parties.

==Founding==
The Liberal Forum (LiF) was founded on 4 February 1993, when liberals in the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ), including five members of the National Council of Austria, left the party. The five &quot;Nationalrat&quot; members were Heide Schmidt, Klara Motter, Friedhelm Frischenschlager, Hans Helmut Moser, and Thomas Barmüller. Heide Schmidt (who was third president of the &quot;Nationalrat&quot; until 1994) became the party&#x27;s first chairperson.

The reason for the split within the FPÖ was growing disagreements between the liberal wing and the nationalist camp. Jörg Haider launched a petition-drive against foreign immigrants in Austria, the so-called Austria First Referendum (&quot;Österreich Zuerst Volksbegehren&quot;). This in turn was unacceptable to Heide Schmidt and her followers. The founders of the new party wanted to be a liberal party in the classical sense, which the FPÖ had ceased to be since the resignation of Norbert Steger and the rise of Haider.

LiF was the first party in the history of the Second Republic (since 1945) to achieve immediate seats in parliament without prior elections. After some initial confusion, the chairs of the house accepted the new formation as an official party, thereby granting access to public financial means of support. The FPÖ left the Liberal International and LiF took over its membership in its place. The party managed to gain 11 seats in the 1994 parliamentary elections, and with 5.51% of all votes cast 10 seats in the 1995 elections.

However, following the resignation of Schmidt as chairperson and the elections in 1999, the party&#x27;s support plummeted, and it failed to gain any seats. In the elections of 3 October 1999, the party obtained 3.65% of all votes and therefore failed to surmount the 4% mandatory threshold in order to enter parliament. In the elections of 2002, it obtained 1% of the vote and got no seats. As a consequence, it also lost votes in state elections and is only represented on the communal level. In Vienna the party lost all seats on the district level in the elections of 2005.

LiF decided not to contest the 2009 European election, focussing on refounding and building up the party instead. The Young Liberals (JuLis), the LIF&#x27;s student and youth organisation, contested the election independently instead.

LiF contested the 2013 legislative election in an electoral alliance with newly formed NEOS – The New Austria. On 25 January 2014, LiF merged into NEOS, which took the full name of NEOS – The New Austria and Liberal Forum.

==Ideology==
According to its founding charter, the LiF propagated political liberalism and advocated a free market economy. Furthermore, the party wanted environmental protection and supported world peace. The party supported:
* Promotion of privatisation
* Legalisation of cannabis
* Equalisation of homosexuals
* Liberalisation of shopping hours
* Increase of the voting age

==Chairpersons since 1993==
The chart below shows a timeline of the Liberal chairpersons and the Chancellors of Austria. The left bar shows all the chairpersons (&quot;Bundessprecher&quot;, abbreviated as &quot;CP&quot;) of the Liberal party, and the right bar shows the corresponding make-up of the Austrian government at that time. The red (Social Democratic Party of Austria, SPÖ) and black (Austrian People&#x27;s Party, ÖVP) colours correspond to which party led the federal government (&quot;Bundesregierung&quot;, abbreviated as &quot;Govern.&quot;). The last names of the respective chancellors are shown, the Roman numeral stands for the cabinets.

==Parliamentary election results==
===National Council===
===European Parliament===
==Notes==
On 7 June 2005, MEP Karin Resetarits left the party of Hans-Peter Martin, following several disagreements with him. She crossed the floor and has taken her seat with the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. Subsequently, In 2006 she also joined the Liberal Forum and represented them in the European Parliament.

In the 2006 elections, the Liberal Forum did not stand, but chairman Alexander Zach instead ran on the Social Democratic Party of Austria electoral list as an independent.

The Liberal Forum participated in the 2008 elections, its Electoral list led by the former chairperson Heide Schmidt. Shortly before the elections, there were allegations that Zach had lobbied for EADS, leading to his resignation in order to protect the party&#x27;s integrity; Schmidt took over as interim leader.

<text>Austin Sean Healey (born 26 October 1973 in Wallasey (now part of Merseyside, formerly Cheshire), is a former English rugby union player who played as a utility back for Leicester Tigers, and represented both England and the British &amp; Irish Lions.

He has 51 England caps and 2 Lions caps. He played for England at scrum half, fly-half, fullback and wing, and was often used as a replacement (or substitute) because of his versatility. He is a famously competitive and &quot;outspoken&quot; character, gaining the nickname &quot;The Leicester Lip&quot;.

Since retiring he has worked in the media.

==Early life and education==

Austin attended Bidston Avenue Primary School in Claughton, Birkenhead, during his primary years. He passed the entrance exam and attended St Anselm&#x27;s College, Birkenhead (Edmund Rice Trust) then Leeds Polytechnic.

His Youth Rugby was with Birkenhead Park FC where he returned with His Big Tackle Programme in 2009 which featured Park&#x27;s Junior Colts.

==Rugby career==

===Early career===
Healey played for England U21 in 1992 and went on to represent England A and the Barbarians &#x27;96 tour of Japan. After spells at Waterloo and Orrell, Healey initially signed for Leicester as a scrum half, having played at wing and outside centre for Orrell. He made his full England début against Ireland during the 1997 Five Nations tournament, and toured with the British Lions in 1997, making two appearances.

He has played in the Five/Six Nations tournaments (‘98-&#x27;02) and in the 1999 World Cup. In the 1999/00 season he was voted both Leicester Tigers&#x27; and Allied Dunbar&#x27;s Player of the Season. 

Leicester coach Bob Dwyer switched him to the wing to accommodate Fijian Waisale Serevi at scrum half. Healey was then selected on the wing for England.

After an injury to Tigers&#x27; South African fly-half Joel Stransky, and the unsuitability of others such as Pat Howard and Andy Goode to fill the role, Healey was switched to fly-half. In this position, however, he was unable to make much of an international impression, his sole appearance at fly-half coming in the 2000 tour to South Africa in the first test, after Jonny Wilkinson fell victim to food poisoning.

In 2001 he made the break during the Heineken Cup final that resulted in the winning try - Healey had started the match at scrum half with Andy Goode at 10, but was switched to fly-half in the closing minutes. He also scored the second and decisive try against Munster when Tigers retained the cup the following year.

His form for Tigers during the 2001 season, was rewarded with a call up to England&#x27;s starting line-up during the Six Nations, and selection for the British &amp; Irish Lions squad to tour Australia, where he put in some good performances for the mid-week team but missed out on further caps due to injury.

However, for many people the abiding memory of this tour will be the controversy caused by his comments on Wallaby lock Justin Harrison in his column in the &quot;Guardian&quot;. The comments backfired after Harrison was selected to make his debut for the Third and deciding test of the series, and stole a crucial lineout - sealing the series victory for Australia. There was some suggestion that Healey&#x27;s comments had served as motivation for the Wallabies team.

On his return from Australia he played in every game for England until he was rested for the summer 2002 tour to Argentina, showing his versatility by starting at fullback, scrum half, and wing and came on twice as a replacement.

He returned to international action appearing as a replacement in all three of the following season&#x27;s autumn internationals when England recorded a series of victories over Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.

Healey flew out to Australia as injury cover for the victorious 2003 Rugby World Cup, however he was never officially added to the squad after certain players recovered, meaning he was unable to pick up a medal for the success despite flying out to Australia.

===2004/2005 season===

In the 2004/05 season Healey hit form again, and with the failings of the England backline, there were calls for him to be reinstated to ignite it. England coach Andy Robinson humoured the press that there was a chance of a recall, but it never came. Instead Healey turned his attention to the 2005 Lions&#x27; tour. He was included in the long list, but not the tour party (having not played international rugby for 3 years). He wrote a column for the Guardian on the tour, which included the quote &#x27;Have you heard the latest from the Lions&#x27; camp? Clive&#x27;s sending Andy Robinson to a fancy dress party tonight. He&#x27;s going as a pumpkin, they&#x27;re hoping when it gets to midnight he&#x27;ll turn into a real coach!&#x27;

===2005/2006 season===
Tigers finished top of the league. A notable performance for Healey was Away at Wasps, where he scored in the last minute to steal a draw. However, Wasps hammered Tigers in the final.
In the 05/06 season, Healey was handed club vice-captaincy and regularly captained the team from scrum half and fly half during the international period. He looked back to near his best form and pressed both Harry Ellis and Andy Goode out of their respective regular slots of 9 and 10 at different times throughout the season. Leicester made the premiership final again and were beaten by Sale Sharks, Healey claims to have thrown his silver medal away in disgust at the end of the game, claiming that he didn&#x27;t do &#x27;losers medals&#x27;.

==Retirement==
Following retirement from Leicester Tigers at the end of the 2005/6 season, Healey planned to start a new career as a banker with Credit Suisse and to also continue working as a BBC analyst. 

==Television appearances==
Healey competed in the sixth series of the BBC competition series &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; with professional dancer Erin Boag. He was eliminated in week 12 of the competition to come 4th overall.

He joined Gary Lineker on &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; Christmas Special, on 23 December 2008. Together they won £50,000 for their chosen charity - Nicholls Spinal Injury Foundation.

Healey presented &quot;The Big Tackle&quot; on ITV in March 2009, aimed at promoting and assisting rugby clubs around the country. In January 2009, he obtained his basic coaching qualifications, in order to put him in a better position from which to advise clubs. During the filming, he returned to his roots and visited his former local club, Birkenhead Park. Some of the other teams that he coached on the series included; Bristol Barbarians, Witney Angels RFC, Rosslyn Park, and University of Sussex.

He competed on show one of the new series of &quot;Beat the Star&quot; in April 2009. He won 4/8 games, and ended up with 22 points overall, beating his opponent; Factory Manager, Glenn Clarke, who had 14 points overall.

Healey appeared as one of the team captains for the second series of &quot;Hole in the Wall&quot; along with ex-EastEnders star Joe Swash.

Austin is the host of the ITV gameshow &quot;The Fuse&quot;, which began on 13 July 2009.

In 2011 Healey appeared on the Chase, a celebrity edition, reaching the final with Joe Pasquale. Shaun Wallace was the Chaser and the pair won with the Chaser needing two more questions in the final chase.

He also appeared on BBC gameshow, &quot;Mastermind&quot;, on 4 January 2013. His specialist subject was &quot;Everton Football Club&quot;.

==Autobiography==
Healey&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Lions, Tigers and Roses&quot;, was published by Oxford University Press in 2001.

<doc id="404682" wikidata="Q1322751" url="?curid=404682" title="Brazilian Democratic Movement">
<text>The Brazilian Democratic Movement (, MDB) is a Brazilian political party. It is considered a &quot;big tent party&quot; and it is one of the parties with the greatest representation throughout the national territory, with the most numbers of senators, mayors and city councillors, always having formed a large part of the National Congress since 1988, and also has the largest number of affiliates, with 2,043,709 members .

Originally, the MDB was founded on 1965 as part of an enforced two party system by the Brazilian military dictatorship, providing an official, if controlled, opposition. With political opening, in the early 1980s the former members of the MDB created the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (, PMDB), the name by which the party was known until 2018. It was the party of former Presidents of Brazil Tancredo Neves, José Sarney, Itamar Franco and Michel Temer, as well providing support for the governments of Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Luíz Inácio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff, as well as unofficial support for the government of Jair Bolsonaro.

After the redemocratization of Brazil, MDB became a big tent party without a clear ideological program, seeking to have many members from various positions and different interest groups under its wing. As such, MDB has been criticized and accused of being a cronyistic &quot;physiological party&quot;, aiming at ensuring proximity to the executive branch in order to guarantee advantages and allow them to distribute privileges through clientelistic networks. This has been shown by the support to multiple governing parties since the beginning of the Sixth Brazilian Republic. As such, the MDB has been considered one of the core members of the &quot;Centrão&quot;.

== History ==

Under military rule from 1965 to 1979, Brazil had a legally enforced two party system, with supporters of the regime gathered under the National Renewal Alliance Party (ARENA) umbrella, and the official opposition making up the MDB. Essentially, the MDB comprised nearly all of the Brazilian Labour Party and the main body of the Social Democratic Party.

For much of the first decade-and-a-half of the military dictatorship, ARENA had large majorities in the federal and state legislatures, and the MDB was virtually powerless. Since the president was indirectly elected by Congress, ARENA&#x27;s candidate—in practice, selected by the military high command—could not possibly be defeated. The MDB did not even put forward candidates in the first post-coup elections, in 1966 and 1969. While the MDB did put forward presidential candidates in 1974 and 1978, they were soundly defeated.

Starting in 1979, multipartyism was reintroduced to Brazil by the military government. A restricted number of parties were allowed and the two original parties were officially disbanded, with ARENA became officially known as the Democratic Social Party. Many of the MDB left into multiple new opposition parties such as the Democratic Labour Party (PDT), Brazilian Labour Party and the Workers&#x27; Party (PT). Even though the country was redemocratizing, the military government sought to weaken the future successor of the MDB by demanding that new parties have &quot;Party&quot; on their official designations, thus forcing a rebranding. The group which remained reorganized the old MDB as the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (&quot;&quot;; PMDB).

The MDB had been a big tent party uniting nearly all of the opposition to the military dictatorship. As such, it harboured elements ranging across the political spectrum. PMDB had a similar character to its predecessor, including a range of politicians from conservatives such as José Sarney to liberals such as Pedro Simon, leftists like Roberto Requião, populists like Íris Resende, nationalists like Orestes Quércia and the former guerrilla movement MR-8.

In 1985, party leader Tancredo Neves won the presidential election, but died before taking office. His running mate José Sarney, who had recently joined the party after defecting from the political wing of the military, became president, serving until 1990. Up until 2016, he was the only president of Brazil to come from the party. In recent presidential elections the party has not run candidates of its own, preferring to focus on congressional and gubernatorial elections.

At the legislative elections on 6 October 2002, the party won 74 out of 513 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 19 out of 81 seats in the Senate, making it one of the biggest parties in Brazil.

The party decided not to launch a candidate for the 2006 presidential election in order to be free to join any coalition in the states. Under Brazilian electoral law then, parties launching presidential candidates could not form alliances at the state level that differed at the national level (this norm was subsequently repealed). At the congressional elections in October 2006, PMDB won 89 of 513 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, becoming its biggest party; and in the Senate it had 15 of the 81 seats after its one-third renovation, becoming the third-largest party. PMDB also won seven state gubernatorial elections in the same election.

In 2010, the party made gains in the Senate, winning 16 of the elected seats for a total of 20. It was somewhat weakened in other elections, winning 79 seats in the Chamber of Deputies (becoming the second largest party) and winning five state governorships.

Notable PMDB members included: Wanderlei Silva, Tancredo Neves, Ulysses Guimarães, Itamar Franco, Orestes Quércia, Michel Temer, Anthony Garotinho, José Sarney, Renan Calheiros, Pedro Simon, Roberto Requião, Germano Rigotto, Paulo Skaf, Ramez Tebet, Marcelo Fortuna, Iris Rezende and Maguito Vilela.

On 29 March 2016, PMDB announced that it was leaving the coalition with the Workers&#x27; Party following accusations against President Dilma Rousseff and former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of corruption. The PMDB supported the impeachment process against Dilma Rousseff. After the impeachment process began, vice president Michel Temer formed a new center-right liberal coalition government with PSDB and other parties. He was confirmed as president as Dilma was permanently removed from office by the Senate on August, 31st 2016, thus becoming the second Brazilian president to hail from PMDB.

On 19 December 2017, the party reverted to its former name, Brazilian Democratic Movement (, MDB). The move was seen as an attempt to renew party identity. The initials PMDB had become associated with corruption and cronyism, while the original acronym was associated with the struggle for democracy, according to party leader, Romero Jucá. The party announced a program based on economic liberalism, fiscal conservatism and greater openness to sectors of civil society such as evangelicals and environmentalists. The party also made it clear that it will prioritize parliamentarians who agree with the new positions of the party, which has been interpreted by many as a warning that rebel parliamentarians, especially the senator from Paraná, Roberto Requião, strongly associated with the Brazilian nationalist left (and who eventually left the party in the summer of 2021 and eventually joined the Workers&#x27; Party), and even Renan Calheiros, the President of the Federal Senate, considered one of the most powerful personalities of Brazilian politics, but who shows little alignment with Temer&#x27;s government and propositions of economic liberalism, can be excluded from the party. A few days earlier, Senator Kátia Abreu of Tocantins was expelled from the party for her support of the opposition, especially for her firm stance against the pension reform, as an alignment to the PT of whom she had been allied in the mandate of Dilma Rousseff.

The PMDB is the Brazilian political party that received the most bribes from Odebrecht. The company&#x27;s &quot;institutional relations&quot; manager, Melo Filho, says he can find among the PMDB senators &quot;the parliamentarians most devoted to the group&#x27;s interests&quot;, but also those &quot;who asked for the highest contributions&quot;.

== Ideology ==

The original MDB was founded as a legal, civil movement of opposition to Brazilian military government. Without a clear program except the democratization of the country, the party was an umbrella of opponents of military regime, ranging from liberal conservatives and Christian democrats from parties like Christian Democratic Party and Social Democratic Party to former labourists, socialists and communists, of Brazilian Labour Party, Brazilian Socialist Party and Brazilian Communist Party. With the redemocratization, many centrists and leftists left the party and joined other parties with more consistent ideologies.

Many Christian democrats, social liberals and social democrats broke with the party in 1988 to form the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, led by Mario Covas, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, José Serra and Franco Montoro. Other PMDB members exited the party to more established left-wing parties, like the new incarnation of Brazilian Socialist Party, Communist Party of Brazil and Democratic Labour Party. In 2009, the last left-wing section of the party abandoned it and formed the Free Fatherland Party, a far left party descending from the MR-8 guerrilla. Some strong leftists, however, like senator Roberto Requião, remained in the party, but more isolated and less powerful (Requião too would eventually leave the party in July 2021). Other powerful politicians within the party, like former Rio de Janeiro governor Sérgio Cabral Filho and senator Renan Calheiros, established a neutral political stance, sometimes described as &quot;physiological&quot; by critics.

The left-wing loss was strong, and as such, the positions of those who left were replaced eventually by dissidents of centrist, centre-left and even right-wing parties, who joined to avoid falling out of power (as independent candidates are not allowed to run in elections in Brazil) and/or losing feuds with local or national party leadership. This replacement changed the character of the party from a catch-all party to a centrist one with a visible centre-right tendency. The party denied the centre-right character or any strict adherence to any political ideology. The party maintains that it is an open party for any and all Brazilians committed to democracy.

The party&#x27;s programme from 2015 is based on the document &quot;Bridge to the Future&quot; detailing the measures to be taken to modernise Brazil, including reform of the labour code, overhaul of the pension system, privatisation of some public companies and reduction of some social rights.

<doc id="404685" wikidata="Q8034801" url="?curid=404685" title="Workers Party of New Zealand">
<text>The Workers Party of New Zealand (previously known as the Anti-Capitalist Alliance) was a socialist political party in New Zealand. It published a monthly magazine called &quot;The Spark&quot;. In February 2013 the party was transformed from a &quot;mass workers party&quot; to a &quot;fighting propaganda group&quot;. The organisation was subsequently renamed Fightback.

Its last national organiser and secretary was Rebecca Broad.

==Platform==
According to the party&#x27;s official website,

The five-point policy platform of the Workers Party is as follows:

# Opposition to all New Zealand and Western intervention in the Third World and all Western military alliances.
# Secure jobs for all with a living wage and a shorter working week.
# For the unrestricted right of workers to organise and take industrial action and no limits on workers&#x27; freedom of speech and activity.
# For working class unity and solidarity – equality for women, Maori and other ethnic minorities and people of all sexual orientations and identities; open borders and full rights for migrant workers.
# For a working people&#x27;s republic.

The party&#x27;s magazine &quot;The Spark&quot; states that the party wants: &quot;A world without poverty and war, a world of material abundance where human potential can be expressed in full,&quot; adding that &quot;While these ideas appear untenable today, they were the notions that inspired revolutions in the 20th century.&quot;

==History==

The party was founded in 2002. It was formed by an electoral alliance of the original Workers&#x27; Party (pro-Mao, Marxist-Leninist) and the pro-Trotsky Revolution group, with the intention of fielding candidates in the 2002 New Zealand general election. The party was unregistered, and so could not contest the party vote in New Zealand&#x27;s Mixed Member Proportional electoral system.

In 2004, the original Workers&#x27; Party and Revolution merged to become the Revolutionary Workers&#x27; League (RWL), which describes itself as a &quot;Marxist current&quot;.
Subsequently, publications formerly published by the RWL became Workers&#x27; Party publications.

==Elections==

In the 2002 elections, the Anti-Capitalist Alliance stood four candidates, the highest number for an unregistered party that year. The candidates gained a total of 336 votes between them, placing the party in fourth place amongst the unregistered parties which contested.

In the 2005 election the ACA stood eight candidates, again the highest number for an unregistered party. The ACA won a combined total of 582 votes, placing them first amongst the unregistered parties.
A nationwide recruitment campaign entitled &quot;Let’s Make Workers’ Issues Hi-Viz&quot; began in 2006 as an attempt to gain the necessary members to register and contest the party vote in the 2008 general election.

In the 2007 local elections, the Workers Party stood four mayoral candidates in Christchurch, Dunedin, Waitakere City, and Wellington.
The Workers Party received 4,705 votes nationwide, with 2,101 of those votes being for Waitakere candidate Rebecca Broad.

In July 2008, the party announced four electorate candidates for the 2008 general election.

On 3 October 2008 the party was registered by the Electoral Commission, allowing it to contest the party vote. In the 2008 New Zealand election, it ultimately received 932 party votes (0.04% of the vote), and 480 electorate votes.

In the leadup to the 2011 election the leadership of the party resigned. The party subsequently failed to apply for broadcasting funding, and its registration was cancelled at its own request on 20 May 2011. The party announced that it would not stand candidates, saying that the previous election &quot;gave quite clear evidence&quot; that trying to using electoral participation to &quot;raise the profile of both socialist ideas and our own organisation&quot; was not working, however on their website they stated that they are backing the Mana Party in the elections.

==Electoral results==

===Parliament===
==Notable members==
In 2003 Paul Hopkinson (who subsequently stood as a candidate for the Anti-Capitalist Alliance in the 2005 election) became the first person charged under the Flags, Emblems, and Names Protection Act of 1981 after burning a New Zealand flag at an anti-war demonstration. In 2008 Hopkinson also became the first school teacher suspended without pay for challenging the provisions of the 1993 Electoral Act relating to public servants, when he refused to voluntarily take unpaid leave in order to contest the seat of Christchurch East in that year&#x27;s general election as the Workers Party candidate.

Another party member, Joel Cosgrove, won the presidency of Victoria University of Wellington Students&#x27; Association (VUWSA) in 2008.

The Party expelled Jasmine Freemantle in May 2009 – she had contested the Mana electorate seat on behalf of the Anti-Capitalist Alliance in the 2005 general election, stood for Parliament for the Workers Party as a list candidate in the 2008 general election and succeeded Joel Cosgrove as VUWSA President in 2009.

<text>Hege Riise (born 18 July 1969) is a Norwegian football coach and former midfield player. She is considered one of the best footballers of her generation, having won the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, the Olympic Games, and the UEFA Women&#x27;s Euro with the Norway women&#x27;s national football team.

==Playing career==

===Club===
Riise started playing football at age six and played on a boys&#x27; team until age 14. She won the Norwegian Cup competition with Setskog-Høland in 1992. In late 1995 along with four other Norwegians she joined Nikko Securities Dream Ladies football club in Japan. Nikko won the Japanese league and cup competitions in 1996 and the cup in 1997, after which Riise moved back to Norway to play again with Setskog-Høland.

She joined Asker FK, in 2000, and again won the cup competition with Asker the same year. Drafted by the Carolina Courage in the Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association 2000 foreign draft, Riise was the team&#x27;s MVP two times and led the Courage to a WUSA Founders Cup title in 2002, before her involvement was curtailed by an anterior cruciate ligament injury. In 2003 the Norwegian Football Association named Riise the best female Norwegian footballer ever.

Returning to Norway in 2005 Hege Riise joined Team Strømmen of Oslo and became the club&#x27;s playing assistant trainer in 2006. She played her last top-level match with Team Strømmen on 28 October 2006 aged 37 and retired from football as a player.

===International===
Riise made her international debut with the Norwegian national team in 1990. Norway won the UEFA Women&#x27;s Championship in 1993. Two years later with Norway she won the Women&#x27;s World Cup and was awarded the Golden Ball after the competition.

Riise&#x27;s biggest achievement with Norway was winning the gold medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, to become one of only three women in the world to win the Olympics, the World Cup and the European Championship (with Gro Espeseth and Bente Nordby).

She retired from international football in September 2004 with 188 caps and 58 goals.
==International goals==
==Coaching career==
Riise retired as a player at the end of the 2006 season with 188 international caps to her credit, the record for all Norwegian footballers. In 2007, she became the chief trainer at Team Strømmen, in the Norwegian women&#x27;s premier league, the Toppserien. In the 2008 season, Team Strømmen were runners-up in both the league and the Cup competitions.

On 28 January 2009, Riise was appointed Assistant Trainer to the U.S. women&#x27;s national team.

Riise was appointed interim head coach of the England women&#x27;s national football team in January 2021. Her tenure bridged the gap between the resignation of Phil Neville, who had originally agreed to see out his contract, and his already-agreed-upon replacement, the incumbent Netherlands head coach Sarina Wiegman due to start in September 2021. Due to the reduced international schedule as a result of the COVID-19, Riise only took charge of three friendlies: defeating Northern Ireland 6–0 in her debut before losing to France and Canada. On 10 March 2021, she was also announced as the manager for Team GB at the delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The team progressed as group winners with seven points in three games before being eliminated in the first knockout round by Australia 4–3 in extra-time.

After her stint in the United Kingdom, Riise fulfilled a prior agreement to take charge of the Norway women&#x27;s national under-19 football team. In the 2022 UEFA Under-19 Championship, Norway won their group and came second overall, after being defeated 2-1 in the final by Spain.

On 3 August 2022, Riise was officially appointed as Norway head coach replacing Martin Sjögren. The rest of the coaching team consists of the assistant coaches Monica Knudsen and Ingvild Stensland, and the goalkeeping coach Jon Knudsen.

On 1 September 2023, Riise stood down from her role as Norway head coach following an unsuccessful 2023 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup campaign. She subsequently moved into a different role at the Norwegian Football Federation (NFF).

<text>The Justicialist Party (, ; abbr. PJ) is a major political party in Argentina, and the largest branch within Peronism. Following the 2023 presidential election, it has been the largest party in the opposition against President Javier Milei.

Founded by Juan Perón and his wife, First Lady Eva Perón, it was previously called the Peronist Party after its founder. Under Perón, the party followed a left-wing agenda based on his policies. It is overall the largest party in Congress, but the party&#x27;s factual position was undermined by divisions that emerged in the 1990s and lasted until 2020. The PJ was rocked by a conflict between two Peronist tendencies, Kirchnerism, the main, left-wing populist faction of the party, and Federal Peronism, which was located on the centre and centre-right of the political spectrum. The division ended with the failure of Federal Peronism to challenge the dominating Kirchnerist faction in 2019. This was completed by Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, the icon of Kirchnerism, being elected the leader of the party, and the creation of a separate dissident party - the Federal Consensus.

Aside Juan Perón, who governed Argentina on three occasions from 1946 to 1955 and later from 1973 to 1974, eleven presidents of Argentina have belonged to the Justicialist Party: Héctor Cámpora, Raúl Alberto Lastiri, Isabel Perón, Carlos Menem, Ramón Puerta, Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, Eduardo Camaño, Eduardo Duhalde, Néstor Kirchner, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and Alberto Fernández. Justicialists have been the largest party in Congress almost consistently since 1987.
==History==

=== Overview ===

The Justicialist Party was founded in 1946 by Juan and Eva Perón, uniting the Labour Party, the Radical Civic Union Renewal Board and the Independent Party, the three parties that had supported Peron in the election. After the enactment of women&#x27;s suffrage, the Female Peronist Party, led by the First Lady, was also established. All Peronist entities were banned from elections after 1955, when the &quot;Revolución Libertadora&quot; overthrew Perón, and civilian governments&#x27; attempt to lift Peronism&#x27;s ban from legislative and local elections in 1962 and 1965 resulted in military coups.
Basing itself on the policies espoused by Perón as Argentine president, the party&#x27;s platform has from its inception centered on populism, and its most consistent base of support has historically been the General Confederation of Labor, Argentina&#x27;s largest trade union. Perón ordered the mass nationalization of public services, strategic industries, and the critical farm export sector; enacted progressive labor laws and social reforms; and accelerated public works investment.

His tenure also favored technical schools, harassed university staff, and promoted urbanization as it raised taxes on the agrarian sector. Those trends earned Peronism the loyalty of much of the working and lower classes but helped alienate the upper and middle classes of society. Censorship and repression intensified, and following his loss of support from the influential Argentine Catholic Church, Perón was ultimately deposed in a violent 1955 coup.

The alignment of groups as supporting or opposing Peronism has largely endured, but the policies of Peronism itself varied greatly over the subsequent decades, as did increasingly those put forth by its many competing figures. During Perón&#x27;s exile, it became a big tent party united almost solely by its support for the aging leader&#x27;s return. A series of violent incidents, as well as Perón&#x27;s negotiations with both the military regime and diverse political factions, helped lead to his return to Argentina in 1973 and to his election in September that year.

An impasse followed in which the party had a place both for leftist armed organizations such as &quot;Montoneros&quot;, and far-right factions such as José López Rega&#x27;s Argentine Anti-Communist Alliance. Following Perón&#x27;s death in 1974, however, the tenuous understanding disintegrated, and a wave of political violence ensued, ultimately resulting in the March 1976 coup. The Dirty War of the late 1970s, which cost hundreds of Peronists (among thousands more) their lives, solidified the party&#x27;s populist outlook, particularly following the failure of conservative Economy Minister José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz&#x27;s free trade and deregulatory policies after 1980.

In the first democratic elections after the end of the dictatorship of the National Reorganization Process, in 1983, the Justicialist Party lost to the Radical Civic Union (UCR). Six years later, it returned to power with Carlos Menem, during whose term the Constitution was reformed to allow for presidential reelection. Menem (1989–1999) adopted neoliberal right-wing policies which changed the overall image of the party.

The Justicialist Party was defeated by a coalition formed by the UCR and the centre-left FrePaSo (itself a left-wing offshoot of the PJ) in 1999, but regained political weight in the 2001 legislative elections, and was ultimately left in charge of managing the selection of an interim president after the economic collapse of December 2001. Justicialist Eduardo Duhalde, chosen by Congress, ruled during 2002 and part of 2003.

The 2003 elections saw the constituency of the party split in three, as Carlos Menem, Néstor Kirchner (backed by Duhalde) and Adolfo Rodríguez Saá ran for the presidency leading different party coalitions. After Kirchner&#x27;s victory, the party started to align behind his leadership, moving slightly to the left.

The Justicialist Party effectively broke apart in the 2005 legislative elections when two factions ran for a Senate seat in Buenos Aires Province: Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (then the First Lady) and Hilda González de Duhalde (wife of former president Duhalde). The campaign was particularly vicious. Kirchner&#x27;s side allied with other minor forces and presented itself as a heterodox, left-leaning Front for Victory (FpV), while Duhalde&#x27;s side stuck to older Peronist tradition. González de Duhalde&#x27;s defeat to her opponent marked, according to many political analysts, the end to Duhalde&#x27;s dominance over the province, and was followed by a steady defection of his supporters to the winner&#x27;s side.

Néstor Kirchner proposed the entry of the party into the Socialist International in February 2008. His dominance of the party was undermined, however, by the 2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector, when a bill raising export taxes was introduced with presidential support. Subsequent growers&#x27; lockouts helped result in the defection of numerous Peronists from the FpV caucus, and further losses during the 2009 mid-term elections resulted in the loss of the FpV absolute majorities in both houses of Congress.

In 2015, the PJ, with its presidential candidate Daniel Scioli, was defeated by the Cambiemos coalition. Mauricio Macri was inaugurated as President of Argentina, ending 12 years of Kirchnerism.

However, in the elections of 2019, the PJ joined the Frente de Todos, which won the presidential elections. The PJ returned to power, with Alberto Fernández as President of the nation. On 10 December 2019, the Centre-left Alberto Fernández of the Justicialist Party was inaugurated president, after defeating the incumbent Mauricio Macri in the 2019 Argentine general election.

The success of the party in the 2019 elections was juxtaposed with the failure of dissident Federal Peronists to challenge the Kirchnerist majority within the party. The Federal Peronists failed to distinguish themselves from anti-Peronist movements, and their bid to put up its own electoral lists to compete with Kirchnerists failed. The election resulted in a &quot;dismantling of the Federal Peronism alternative&quot;.

On 22 March 2021, Fernández was elected by the national congress of the Justicialist Party as the party&#x27;s new national chairman, succeeding José Luis Gioja. Fernández ran unopposed, heading the &quot;Unidad y Federalismo&quot; list, which received the support of diverse sectors in the Peronist movement, including La Cámpora.

The Union for the Homeland (Unión por la Patria, UP) is a Centre-left political and electoral coalition of Peronist political parties in Argentina, formed to compete in the 2023 general election. The coalition is a successor to the previous Frente de Todos coalition. The coalition is centered on the Justicialist Party and its allies both on the federal and provincial levels, including the Renewal Front of Sergio Massa.

In April 2023, President Alberto Fernandez announced that he would not seek re-election in the next presidential election. In the primary elections on August of that year, Sergio Massa defeated Juan Grabois by a margin of nearly 16 percentage points, although it became the worst result for a ruling Peronist coalition since the PASO was first implemented in 2009.

In the runoff in November 2023, Libertarian candidate Javier Milei defeated Massa with 55.7% against 44.35% of the vote, the highest percentage of the vote since Argentina&#x27;s transition to democracy. Massa conceded defeat shortly before the official results were published.

=== Beginning ===
The Justicialist party was created in November 1946, 10 months after Juan D. Perón was elected president of the nation, with the name Single Revolutionary party; previously this would be called the Peronist party. The party was a result of the fusion of three parties that had been created in 1945 in order to sustain the presidential candidacy of Perón: the Labor party, the Radical Renovating Together Civic Union, and the Independent party.

=== Peronism ===
Peronism is a political current that was established between November 1943 and October 1945, as a result of an alliance between a large number of unions, principally of socialist and revolutionary union ideology, and two soldiers – Juan Domingo Perón and Domingo Mercante, whose initial objective was to run the National Labor Department – later elevated to the level of Secretary of Labor and Social Security – and to drive until there were laws and measures for the worker&#x27;s benefit. The Secretary was run by Perón, who in the course of those years was converted into the leader of a new political movement that would take the name Peronism in the course of 1945.

Since 1943, the country was governed by a military dictatorship self-designated as the Revolution of ‘43, made of a very heterogeneous composition, that had overthrown at its time a fraudulent regime, known as the Infamous Decade. At the start of 1945, the US ambassador to Argentina, Spruille Braden, organized a broad movement that was defined as anti-peronist, with the goal of opposing Perón and the sanctioned labor laws. Largely as a reaction to the union movement, principally the socialist and revolutionary union majority started to define themselves as peronists.

On 8 October 1945, at the loss of the vote from the officials of Campo de Mayo, Perón renounced, being later detained. Nine days later, a big worker mobilization known as Loyalty Day, compelled the military government to prepare Perón’s liberation and call elections. That day is the most cited as the date of peronism’s birth.

=== Party Organization until 1955 ===
Many union leaders opposed him, but their political inexperience and Perón’s charisma before the masses made them unsuccessful. Lewinsky characterizes the Peronist party (PP) as a popular party that will differ from other European, union based parties in four aspects.

The first of them is that they had been created from above by agents of the State, destined to retain power more than to obtain it; operated in major part by their own government using State resources whereas PP never developed their own organization. The second is that they were an extremely personalist party that in the statutes of 1954 declared Perón is their “Supreme Leader” and gave him the authority to “modify or declare null and void the decision of the party authorities… to inspect, intervene, and replace” the leaders of the party and even prohibited party headquarters from displaying photographs that were not Perón or Eva Perón. The national party management intervened in permanent form in the provincial subsidiaries and used to choose the local candidates. Usually the leaders with independent support were displaced and replaced by those “loyal to the death” that followed Perón&#x27;s directives exclusively. In this form, the political career inside the party depended exclusively on the bonds with Perón; there was not a structure for political promotion nor a stable bureaucratic hierarchy. For example, the reorganization of the party in 1947 signified the replacement of the entirety of the highest party leadership members.

Third, the party had a fluid structure that was maintained until the final days of the decade of 1940. In 1951, Perón once again reorganized the party structure creating a parallel hierarchy with a “strategic national command” and provincial “tactical commands” that would have representatives of the three party branches – masculine, feminine, and union – but in practice Perón and Eva Perón exercised strategic leadership, and the governors and “inventors” arrived ahead of the tactics. Lastly, differently from the English Labor party, the PP did not initially have rules about their relation with the unions. In the decade of 1950, the union was recognized as one of the three branches and, as such, was attributed to them by tradition – without a written norm – a right to a third of the candidacies, but until 1955 it was not complied with rigor.

==Ideology==
The Justicialist Party was historically left-wing populist. Founded by Juan Perón (who rose to Argentinian presidency in the 1940s with the support of his wife Eva Perón), the party was composed of Perón&#x27;s loyalists and was a personification of populism in the form of a strong charismatic leader. The reforms carried out by Perón in 1940s and 1950s were described as socialist and populist. Christopher Wylde defines Peronism as &quot;a form of leftist–populist nationalism, rooted in an urban working-class movement that was allied to elements of the domestic bourgeoisie as well as the military.&quot; Writing on Perón and his ideology, Charles D. Ameringer argued that &quot;The rise to power of Juan Perón in 1943 was not the end of the socialist impulse in Argentina; it was the culmination&quot; and added that &quot;much of the social legislation either introduced or implemented by Perón . . . originated with the Socialist Party.&quot;

The basic principles of Peronism and the Justicialist Party were economic independence, political sovereignty, and social justice, as formulated by Perón. Economically, Perón expanded public spending and gave the state a dominating role in production and distribution (economic nationalism), implemented egalitarian distribution of national income (therefore Peronism is considered to represent syndicalism and/or non-Marxist socialism), and implemented a system of incentives and rewards that would direct economic activities towards local markets while severely limiting production for international markets (protectionism). Peronism rejected individualism in favor of communitarianism and sought a system that would reject both capitalism and liberalism in favor of an economic system that would be oriented around &quot;social equity, rather than the individual pursuit of wealth.&quot; This was combined with Peronist redefinition of citizenship, as Perón attracted and empowered groups that were previously excluded socially and economically - urban poor, immigrant communities and unionised workers. 

Socially, Peronism was authoritarian, yet it also implemented free suffrage and promoted causes such as feminism, indigenous rights and emancipation of the working class. Peter Ranis wrote that &quot;paradoxically, Perón democratized Argentina in the sense of bringing the working class more fully into the political process, though his administrations often placed cultural and political restrictions on the opposition that severely compromised that democracy.&quot; The legitimacy of Peronism derived from trade unions who gave Perón their support, and his ideology was a reflection of demands and expectations of the Argentinian labor movement. According to historian Daniel James, the reliance of Peronism on trade unions was so strong, that in the Peronist movement, &quot;the initiative very much lay with the trade union movement; Perón was more its creature than the labor movement was his.&quot; 

Following the overthrow of Perón in 1955, Peronism would gradually shift further to the left, something that was influenced by political developments in Latin America such as the Cuban Revolution and the development of far-left liberation theology amongst Latin American Catholics, as well as by Perón&#x27;s tactical endorsement and promotion of socialist and leftist currents within his movement. In 1956, exiled Perón picked left-wing activist John William Cooke to represent the Peronist movement in Argentina in his absence. Cooke promoted socialism and presented Peronism as a movement that was &quot;antibureaucratic, socialist, profoundly national, and sister to all the world&#x27;s exploited [peoples]&quot;, and praising Perón as the &quot;leader of national liberation&quot;. In 1960, Cooke moved to Revolutionary Cuba, where he combined Peronism with Guevarism, Castroism and the foco theory.

Perón approved of Cooke&#x27;s activism and wrote positively of Marxism himself, identifying Peronist struggle with the Cuban Revolution. With Perón&#x27;s encouragement, Peronist youth formed left-wing, revolutionary organizations such as the Montoneros and the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army. Perón supported their struggle as a realisation of his justicialist doctrine, agreeing with the Montoneros&#x27; conclusion that &quot;the only possible road for the people to seize power and install national socialism is total, national, and prolonged revolutionary war . . . [following] the methods of rural and urban guerrillas.&quot; Following Vatican II that led to development of anti-capitalist, revolutionary and Marxist-aligned rhetoric amongst Latin American clergy, Perón also gained support of left-wing Catholics who supported the far-left liberation theology. Left-wing priests praised Peronism as a precursor to liberation theology, and the Movement of Priests for the Third World argued that &quot;the Peronist movement, revolutionary, with its massive force... will necessarily lead to the revolution which will make possible an original and Latin American socialism.&quot; 

From the return of Perón in 1973 and under the leadership of Isabel Perón, the Justicialist Party was no longer characterized by anti-imperialist and revolutionary tones but by a strong focus on Orthodox Peronism and anti-communism (of which it became the main bulwark in South America).

That line continued even after the military dictatorship of the National Reorganization Process, with the government of Carlos Menem until that of Eduardo Duhalde. The party moved from Orthodox Peronism to the centre-right, while its rival Radical Civic Union acted as a centre-left party.

Since 2003, the party has undergone an abrupt revolution, with the rise of a faction known as the Front for Victory, led by Néstor Kirchner. The policies and ideology of that faction were dubbed Kirchnerism, a mix of anti-neoliberalism, left-wing nationalism and radicalism. Kirchner was elected President of Argentina and soon became a popular left-wing figure. The party shifted to being left-wing populist, while the Radical Civic Union joined with other anti-Kirchnerist centrist and center-right parties including Republican Proposal. After his death in 2010, his wife, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, took over the leadership of the Front for Victory, which continues to be a major faction of the Justicialist Party.

<text>Gerrards Cross is a town and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England. It lies immediately south of Chalfont St Peter and a short distance west of the London Borough of Hillingdon, from which it is separated by the parish of Denham. Other neighbouring villages include Fulmer, Hedgerley, Iver Heath and Stoke Poges. It is west-north-west of central London. The town stands on the lower slopes of the Chiltern Hills, and the River Misbourne flows through the parish, north-east of the town. Bulstrode Park Camp was an Iron Age fortified encampment. The town is close to M25 motorway and the M40 motorway, the latter running beside woodland on the town&#x27;s southern boundary.

==History==
The site of a minor Iron Age hillfort, Bulstrode Park Camp, is to the south-west of the town centre. It is a scheduled ancient monument.

The area which is now Gerrards Cross was historically an area of wasteland known as Chalfont Heath, which later became known as Gerrards Cross Common. In the medieval period, there was no village in the area, which straddled the edges of five different parishes. The name Gerrards Cross, sometimes spelled Jarretts Cross, is recorded from at least 1448, and may relate to an early landowner, Gerard of Chalfont, who is recorded as having owned land in the area in the 14th century.
The origin of the &#x27;cross&#x27; element of the name is uncertain; a cross is marked on early maps near the Bull Hotel and Latchmoor Pond at the western end of the common, but whether it was a standing cross marking a boundary or meeting place, or a name for a crossroads is unclear. The modern crossroads of the Oxford Road (the A40) and Windsor Road / Packhorse Lane (B416) was not created until 1707, when an old north-south road through Bulstrode Park was diverted, which was many years after the name Gerrards Cross was first recorded.
Until the 19th century, development in the area was limited to a small number of buildings immediately adjoining the common, most of which were in the parish of Chalfont St Peter.

In 1859, St James&#x27; Church was built on Oxford Road. It was initially a chapel of ease for the parish of Fulmer in which it lay, but in 1861 it became parish church of a new ecclesiastical parish called St James, Gerrard&#x27;s Cross, created from parts of the parishes of Chalfont St Peter, Fulmer, Iver, Langley Marish, and Upton-cum-Chalvey. The creation of the ecclesiastical parish did not change the civil parish boundaries. A new civil parish of Gerrards Cross matching the ecclesiastical parish was subsequently created in 1895.

Gerrards Cross remained a relatively small village at the turn of the 20th century. The parish had a population of 552 at the 1901 census. In 1906, Gerrards Cross railway station opened on the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway, a new line jointly built by the two companies to improve their routes from the Midlands to London. The station is to the north-east of Gerrards Cross Common, and the area around the station was developed soon after the station opened; by 1911, the population of the parish had grown to 1,612, and it then grew steadily throughout the 20th century.

==Facilities==

The large and distinctive parish church is dedicated to St. James. It was built in 1859 as a memorial to Colonel George Alexander Reid who was MP for Windsor, and designed by Sir William Tite in yellow brick with a Byzantine-style dome, Chinese-looking turrets and an Italianate Campanile. In 1969 the singer Lulu married Maurice Gibb of the Bee Gees in the church. The actress Margaret Rutherford is buried with her husband Stringer Davis in the St James Church graveyard.

The town has its own library and its own cinema, the Everyman Gerrards Cross, which originally opened in 1925.

Independent schools include St Mary&#x27;s (all girls- through to sixth form). Students of secondary school age attend either one of the local grammar schools, such as Dr Challoner&#x27;s Grammar School (Boys with co-educational Sixth Form), Dr Challoner&#x27;s High School (Girls), The Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe (Boys), John Hampden Grammar School (Boys), and Beaconsfield High School (Girls) Chesham Grammar School (Co-ed), and the local Upper School, Chalfonts Community College, which is the catchment school.

On the south side of the town is the Gerrards Cross Memorial Building, on the site of the former vicarage. The building was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and unveiled in 1922 to commemorate the town&#x27;s losses during the First World War. It is the only example of a Lutyens war memorial designed with a functional purpose.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Gerrards Cross, at civil parish (town) and unitary authority level: Gerrards Cross Town Council and Buckinghamshire Council. The town council meets at the Gerrards Cross Memorial Centre on East Common and has its offices at the adjoining South Lodge.

From the creation of the civil parish of Gerrards Cross in 1895 until 1974 it was included in the Eton Rural District. The parish then became part of the Beaconsfield district in 1974, which was renamed South Bucks in 1980. The district was abolished in 2020, when Buckinghamshire Council was created, also taking the functions of the abolished county council.

Since 1974, parish councils have had the right to declare their parishes to be a town. Gerrards Cross Parish Council declared the parish to be a town with effect from 1 January 2016. The council therefore became Gerrards Cross Town Council.

==Transport==
The town has a railway station on the Chiltern Main Line which opened on 2 April 1906. This provides services to London, High Wycombe and Oxford with a commuting time of 18 minutes on the fast train to London Marylebone. A new arch over the section of deep railway cutting to allow Tesco to build a supermarket collapsed on 30 June 2005 at 19:30. Nobody was injured but the line was closed for over six weeks. Compensation by Tesco to Chiltern was reported as £8.5m and the retailer compensated by funding a media campaign to reinstate business immediately lost by the closure. Construction of a correctly constructed arch began in January 2009.

The 11.36am from London Paddington to Gerrards Cross was an official or &#x27;parliamentary train&#x27; recognised as an outlandish loss-making service to prevent the link to that terminus being closed or re-allocated. This train now terminates at West Ruislip. In 2011, National Rail was lobbied to phase the service out.

The town lies north west of London&#x27;s Heathrow Airport.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census, the largest religious affiliations in Gerrards Cross were Christian (46.2%), those with no religion (22.4%), Sikh (10.5%), Hindu (7.5%), Muslim (6.4%), Jewish (0.8%), Buddhist (0.5%) and Other (0.5%).

It was reported 65.5% of people living in Gerrards Cross were reported as White (65.5%), Asian (25.5%), Mixed (4.0%), Black (4.0%) and Other (1.1%).

==Recent history==
Many houses built during development in the 1950s had defective tiles, leading to the highest court reported judgment &quot;Young &amp; Marten Ltd v McManus Childs Ltd&quot;, holding that a person who contracts to do work and supply materials implicitly warrants that the materials will be fit for purpose, even if the purchaser specifies the materials to be used.

<text>Landmark court decisions, in present-day common law legal systems, establish precedents that determine a significant new legal principle or concept, or otherwise substantially affect the interpretation of existing law. &quot;Leading case&quot; is commonly used in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth jurisdictions instead of &quot;landmark case&quot;, as used in the United States.

In Commonwealth countries, a reported decision is said to be a &quot;leading decision&quot; when it has come to be generally regarded as settling the law of the question involved. In 1914, Canadian jurist Augustus Henry Frazer Lefroy said &quot;a &#x27;leading case&#x27; [is] one that settles the law upon some important point&quot;.

A leading decision may settle the law in more than one way. It may do so by: 
* Distinguishing a new principle that refines a prior principle, thus departing from prior practice without violating the rule of &quot;stare decisis&quot;;
* Establishing a &quot;test&quot; (that is, a measurable standard that can be applied by courts in future decisions), such as the &quot;Oakes test&quot; (in Canadian law) or the &quot;Bolam test&quot; (in English law).
* Sometimes, with regard to a particular provision of a written constitution, only one court decision has been made. By necessity, until further rulings are made, this ruling is the leading case. For example, in Canada, &quot;[t]he leading case on voting rights and electoral boundary readjustment is &quot;Carter&quot;. In fact, &quot;Carter&quot; is the only case of disputed electoral boundaries to have reached the Supreme Court.&quot; The degree to which this kind of leading case can be said to have &quot;settled&quot; the law is less than in situations where many rulings have reaffirmed the same principle.

== Landmark decisions in Australia ==

Decisions in leading cases in Australia have usually been made by the High Court of Australia, although historically some have been made by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London.

*&quot;Amalgamated Society of Engineers v Adelaide Steamship Co. Ltd.&quot; (Engineers&#x27; Case) (1920): Rejected the doctrines of implied intergovernmental immunities and reserved State powers and determined that each head of federal power should be interpreted simply on the words of the grant.
*&quot;Re Judiciary and Navigation Acts (1921)&quot;: dealt with what is a matter for the court and what the court can hear.
* In 1948, the High Court of Australia found that the Chifley government&#x27;s legislation to nationalise Australia&#x27;s private banks was unconstitutional.
* In 1951, the High Court of Australia found that Robert Menzies&#x27; attempts to ban the Communist Party of Australia were unconstitutional.
* In &quot;Commonwealth v Tasmania&quot; &quot;(Tasmanian Dams Case)&quot;, the High Court held that the Commonwealth was able to invoke its external affairs power to give effect to Australia&#x27;s obligations under international law, including to prevent the construction of the Franklin Dam in a World Heritage Zone. 
* In &quot;Eddie Mabo &amp; Ors v The State of Queensland (No.2)&quot; invalidated the declaration of terra nullius.
* &quot;Dietrich v The Queen&quot;, it was found that Australians accused of serious offences have a limited right to legal representation in order to guarantee a fair trial.
* In &quot;Plaintiff M70/2011 v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship&quot; &quot;(The Malaysian Solution Case)&quot; the High Court held that refugees could not be deported to countries that did not meet certain human rights protection standards.
* In &quot;Commonwealth v the ACT&quot; &quot;(Same-Sex Marriage Case)&quot; the High Court held that only the Commonwealth had the necessary legislative head of power to reform marriage laws to encompass same-sex marriage.
* In &quot;Williams v Commonwealth&quot; and &quot;Williams v Commonwealth (No 2)&quot; &quot;(School Chaplains Case)&quot; the High Court held that the Commonwealth did not have the necessary constitutional head of legislative power to fund the National School Chaplaincy Programme.
* In &quot;Re Canavan&quot; &quot;(The Citizenship Seven Case)&quot;, the High Court&#x27;s earlier ruling in &quot;Sykes v Cleary&quot; was clarified and it was found that a dual citizen, irrespective of whether they knew about their citizenship status, will be disqualified from sitting in Parliament unless they are irremediably prevented by foreign law from renouncing their foreign citizenship as a result of the operation of s 44(i) of the Australian Constitution. 15 members of the 45th Parliament were either ruled ineligible to serve, or resigned on the basis of holding foreign citizenship.
* In &quot;NZYQ v Minister for Immigration&quot;, the High Court overturned its earlier ruling in &quot;Al-Kateb v Godwin&quot; and affirmed the separation of powers under the Constitution, holding that indefinite detention of non-citizens that have no realistic prospect of removal from Australia in the foreseeable future is unlawful due to its punitive nature.

== Landmark decisions in Canada ==
There is no universally agreed-to list of &quot;leading decisions&quot; in Canada.

One indication, however, as to whether a case is widely regarded as being &quot;leading&quot; is its inclusion of the ruling in one or more of the series of compilations prepared over the years by various authors. One of the earlier examples is Augustus Henry Frazer Lefroy&#x27;s &quot;Leading Cases in Canadian Constitutional Law&quot;, published in 1914. More recently, Peter H. Russell and a changing list of collaborators have published a series of books, including:
* &quot;Leading Constitutional Decisions&quot; (first published 1965, with several later editions);
* &quot;Federalism and the Charter: Leading Constitutional Decisions&quot; (published in 1989, co-edited by Russell, F.L. Morton and Rainer Knopff);
* &quot;The Court and the Charter: Leading Cases&quot; (published in 2008, co-edited by Russell, Morton, Knopff, Thomas Bateman and Janet Hiebert); and
* &quot;The Court and the Constitution: Leading Cases&quot; (published in 2008, co-edited by Russell, Morton, Knopff, Bateman and Hiebert).

Decisions in leading cases in Canada have usually been made by the Supreme Court of Canada. Prior to the abolition of appeals of Supreme Court decisions in the 1940s, most landmark decisions were made by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London.

== Landmark decisions in India ==
The Supreme Court of India, which is the highest judicial body in India, has decided many leading cases of Constitutional jurisprudence, establishing Constitution Benches for hearing the same. Given below are a list of some leading cases:
* Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalvaru &amp; Ors. v. State of Kerala &amp; Anr., (W.P. (C) 135 of 1970), was a case in which the Court formally adopted the Basic structure doctrine.
* Three Judges Cases (in which the Court established precedent regarding appointment of judges while ensuring absolute independence of the judiciary from the Legislature and the Executive):
# S.P. Gupta v. Union of India &amp; Anr. (Transfer Case (civil) 19 of 1981; 1982 2 SCR 365)
# Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association &amp; Anr. v. Union of India (W.P. (C) 1303 of 1987)
# In re Special reference 1 of 1998
* Justice K. S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) &amp; Anr. v. Union of India &amp; Ors. (W.P. (C) 494 of 2012), wherein the Court held that Right to Privacy was a fundamental right under the Constitution of India.

==Landmark decisions in Italy==
The criminal case against the operator of the Italian fake review business PromoSalento in 2018 has been described as a &quot;landmark ruling&quot;.

== Landmark decisions in New Zealand ==

Decisions in leading cases in New Zealand were made by the Court of Appeal of New Zealand before the establishment of the Supreme Court of New Zealand, although historically some have been made by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London.

* In 1976, the Wellington Supreme Court in &quot;Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others&quot; held that Prime Minister Robert Muldoon had purported to suspend laws in a manner contrary to the Bill of Rights 1689.
* In 1987, the Court of Appeal in &quot;New Zealand Maori Council v Attorney-General&quot; recognised the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi.
* In 2022, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Make It 16 Incorporated v Attorney-General&quot; that restricting 16 and 17 year olds from voting was unjustified age discrimination under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act.

== Landmark decisions in the United Kingdom ==

Decisions in leading cases in the United Kingdom have usually been made by the House of Lords, or more recently the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom; in Scotland by the Court of Session or High Court of Justiciary; in England and Wales by the Court of Appeal or the High Court of Justice of England and Wales.

==Landmark decisions in the United States==
Landmark cases in the United States come most frequently (but not exclusively) from the Supreme Court of the United States. United States Courts of Appeals may also make such decisions, particularly if the Supreme Court chooses not to review the case, or adopts the holding of the court below. Although many cases from state supreme courts are significant in developing the law of that state, only a few are so revolutionary that they announce standards that many other state courts then choose to follow.

<text>Gibraltar is a hamlet in the parish of Dinton-with-Ford and Upton in Buckinghamshire, England. It is located on the modern main road that links Aylesbury with Thame.

The hamlet is named after the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar.

In 2003, the public house in Gibraltar, called the Bottle and Glass, was gutted when the thatch of the pub roof caught fire following an electrical fault in the upper storey of the building. Following extensive rebuilding the Bottle and Glass reopened on 27 April 2007.

<text>.edu is a sponsored top-level domain (sTLD) in the Domain Name System of the Internet. The domain was implemented in 1985 to create a domain name hierarchy for organizations with a focus on education. At the time, it was open for registration for entities from any region. Since 2001, new registrants for second-level domain names have been required to be United States–affiliated institutions of higher education.

==History==

The domain &quot;edu&quot; was implemented in April 1985 as a generic top-level domain. Six universities were the initial registrants that month. UCLA was among this group of the first schools to have their URLs registered. And while the first ARPAnet message was sent from UCLA to Stanford, Stanford did not have their URL registered until half a year after these first schools, becoming the 18th .edu site.

Until 2001, Network Solutions served as registrar for &quot;edu&quot; under an arrangement with the U.S. Department of Commerce. Domain registration was done at no cost to educational institutions. In 2001, the Commerce Department entered into a five-year agreement with Educause making that organization the registrar for the .edu domain. The agreement with Educause was extended for an additional five-year period in 2006; at that time Educause was authorized to begin charging a yearly administrative fee to registrants.

The domain &quot;edu&quot; was originally intended for educational institutions anywhere in the world. However, most of the institutions that obtained edu registrations were in the United States, while non-U.S. educational institutions typically used country-level domains. In 1993, a decision attributed to Jon Postel limited new registrations in the edu domain to four-year postsecondary educational institutions. This prevented new edu registrations by community colleges and other institutions offering less than four years of postsecondary schooling.

Enforcement of the restrictions in the 1990s was not entirely effective. The webmaster for the Exploratorium, a San Francisco science museum, recalled in 2006 that the museum obtained its edu domain name at a time in the early 1990s &quot;when there were about 600 websites and only one for a museum.&quot; The museum&#x27;s Internet registrar allowed it to sidestep the then-extant domain-naming rules by using &quot;edu&quot; despite not being an academic institution and by using a name with more than 12 characters. Some community colleges were reported to have registered edu second-level names after 1993. In 1999 an article in &quot;Mother Earth News&quot; quoted an authority on distance education as saying, &quot;Anyone who has the necessary $70 can register an edu domain name and use it to archive any type of enterprise on the Internet.&quot;

In 2001, the domain was restricted to U.S.-accredited postsecondary educational institutions. Subsequent changes expanded its use beyond four-year institutions, allowing registrations by accredited community colleges as well as by university systems, community college districts, and similar entities.

Between 2004 and 2019, the number of registered names in domain edu remained relatively persistent, with more than 7,000 but fewer than 8,000 names registered at any given time.

==Eligibility==
Since October 29, 2001, only postsecondary institutions and organizations that are institutionally accredited by an agency on the U.S. Department of Education&#x27;s list of nationally recognized accrediting agencies are eligible to apply for an domain. To be eligible, an institution must be located in the U.S., legally organized in the U.S., or recognized by a U.S. state, territorial, or federal agency. University system offices, community college district offices, and other entities within the United States that are organized to manage and govern multiple accredited postsecondary institutions may also register .edu domain names. Each eligible institution is limited to registering one .edu domain name, but institutions may also use names in other top-level domains.

==Grandfathered uses==
Domains that were already registered in &quot;edu&quot; as of October 29, 2001, were grandfathered into the system. Holders of such domain names can retain their edu domain names without regard to the current eligibility criteria.

In 2003, Educause undertook an initiative to clear the edu registry of domain names that were not accurately registered by removing names whose registrants did not respond to requests that they log into the registry and review their whois entries. Through this effort, Educause expected to eliminate a number of domains that did not appear to qualify for registration in the edu domain, such as &quot;oracle.edu&quot;, &quot;geraldine.edu&quot;, and &quot;jedi.edu&quot;. Since 2006, Educause has been authorized to implement measures to prevent edu domain name owners from transferring their domain names to other entities. These measures, together with the imposition of registration fees, were intended to reduce the number of inactive or ineligible edu domain names.

The U.S. Department of Education notes that some &quot;suspect&quot; or &quot;illegitimate&quot; educational institutions continue to use edu addresses that were registered before the stringent eligibility criteria were adopted in 2001.

==Related domains==
Many countries operate edu or .ac namespaces within their country code top-level domains that serve the same purpose as the edu top-level domain. In the United States, community colleges and technical and vocational schools also have the option of registering fourth-level domains under the .cc.&quot;state&quot;.us and .tec.&quot;state&quot;.us affinity namespaces, while elementary and secondary schools and school districts may register under the .k12.&quot;state&quot;.us namespace.

In September 2015, the .college top-level domain emerged as an option for organizations that do not meet edu&#x27;s more stringent criteria, such as non-accredited institutions and institutions based outside the United States.&lt;br&gt;

<text>The People&#x27;s Party ( ; known mostly by its acronym, PP ) is a conservative and Christian democratic political party in Spain.

The People&#x27;s Party was a 1989 re-foundation of People&#x27;s Alliance (AP), a party led by former minister Manuel Fraga. It was founded in 1976 as alliance of post-Francoist proto-parties. The new party combined the conservative AP with several small Christian democratic and liberal parties (the party calling this fusion of views &quot;the Reformist Centre&quot;). In 2002, Manuel Fraga received the honorary title of &quot;Founding Chairman&quot;. The party&#x27;s youth organisation is New Generations of the People&#x27;s Party of Spain (NNGG).

The PP is a member of the centre-right European People&#x27;s Party (EPP), and in the European Parliament its 16 MEPs sit in the EPP Group. The PP is also a member of the Centrist Democrat International and the International Democracy Union. The PP was also one of the founding organisations of the Budapest-based Robert Schuman Institute for Developing Democracy in Central and Eastern Europe.

On 24 May 2018, the National Court found that the PP profited from the illegal kickbacks-for-contracts scheme of the Gürtel case, confirming the existence of an illegal accounting and financing structure that ran in parallel with the party&#x27;s official one since the party&#x27;s foundation in 1989; the court ruled that the PP helped establish &quot;a genuine and effective system of institutional corruption through the manipulation of central, autonomous and local public procurement&quot;. This prompted a no confidence vote on Mariano Rajoy&#x27;s government, which was brought down on 1 June 2018 in the first successful motion since the Spanish transition to democracy. On 5 June 2018, Rajoy announced his resignation as PP leader. 

On 21 July 2018, Pablo Casado was elected as the new leader of the PP. Under his leadership, the party was claimed to take a right-wing turn, including forging local alliances with the far-right Vox party. However, Casado later bet on breaking ties with Vox, and caused an unprecedented leadership crisis inside PP. After this there were rumors that Casado had ordered to spy on the popular president of the community of Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, for alleged irregularities, which collapsed popular support for PP according to opinion polls for future national elections, being resolved with the resignation of Casado and the appointment of the veteran Alberto Núñez Feijóo as the new leader, which improved the electoral expectations of the party. The party won the most votes in the 2023 general election, but it failed to secure a parliamentary majority.

==History==
===Political genealogy===
The party has its roots in the People&#x27;s Alliance founded on 9 October 1976 by former Francoist minister Manuel Fraga. Although Fraga was a member of the reformist faction of the Franco regime, he supported an extremely gradual transition to democracy. However, he badly underestimated the public&#x27;s distaste for Francoism. Additionally, while he attempted to convey a reformist image, the large number of former Francoists in the party led the public to perceive it as both reactionary and authoritarian. In the June 1977 general election, the AP garnered only 8.3 percent of the vote, putting it in fourth place.

In the months following the 1977 elections, dissent erupted within the AP over constitutional issues that arose as the draft document was being formulated. Fraga had wanted from the beginning to brand the party as a traditional European conservative party, and wanted to move the AP toward the political centre in order to form a larger centre-right party. Fraga&#x27;s wing won the struggle, prompting most of the disenchanted reactionaries to leave the party. The AP then joined with other moderate conservatives to form the Democratic Coalition (&quot;Coalición Democrática,&quot; CD).

It was hoped that this new coalition would capture the support of those who had voted for the Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD) in 1977, but who had become disenchanted with the Adolfo Suárez government. In the March 1979 general election, however, the CD received 6.1 percent of the vote, again finishing a distant fourth.

At the AP&#x27;s Second Party Congress in December 1979, party leaders re-assessed their involvement in the CD. Many felt that the creation of the coalition had merely confused the voters, and they sought to emphasise the AP&#x27;s independent identity. Fraga resumed control of the party, and the political resolutions adopted by the party congress reaffirmed the conservative orientation of the AP.

In the early 1980s, Fraga succeeded in rallying the various components of the right around his leadership. He was aided in his efforts to revive the AP by the increasing disintegration of the UCD. In the general elections held in October 1982, the AP gained votes both from previous UCD supporters and from the far right. It became the major opposition party to the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party, securing 25.4 percent of the popular vote. Whereas the AP&#x27;s parliamentary representation had dropped to nine seats in 1979, the party allied itself with the small Christian democratic People&#x27;s Democratic Party (PDP) and won 106 seats in 1982.

The increased strength of the AP was further evidenced in the municipal and regional elections held in May 1983, when the party drew 26 percent of the vote. A significant portion of the electorate appeared to support the AP&#x27;s emphasis on law and order as well as its pro-business policies.
Subsequent political developments belied the party&#x27;s aspirations to continue increasing its base of support. Prior to the June 1986 elections, the AP joined forces with the PDP and the Liberal Party (PL) to form the People&#x27;s Coalition (CP), in another attempt to expand its constituency to include the centre of the political spectrum. The coalition called for stronger measures against terrorism, for more privatisation, and for a reduction in public spending and in taxes. The CP failed to increase its share of the vote in the 1986 elections, however, and it soon began to disintegrate.

When regional elections in late 1986 resulted in further losses for the coalition, Fraga resigned as AP chairman, although he retained his parliamentary seat. At the party congress in February 1987, Antonio Hernández Mancha was chosen to head the AP, declaring that under his leadership the AP would become a &quot;modern right-wing European party&quot;. But Hernández Mancha lacked political experience at the national level, and the party continued to decline. When support for the AP plummeted in the municipal and regional elections held in June 1987, it was clear that it would be overtaken as major opposition party by Suárez&#x27;s Democratic and Social Centre (CDS).

After the resignation of Manuel Fraga and the successive victories of the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) in the general election of 1982 and 1986 general election, the Popular Alliance entered a period of deep crisis. Fraga then took the reins and, at the Congress of January 1989, the constituent parties of the CP were folded into a new party, the People&#x27;s Party. While the AP was the nucleus of the merged party, the PP tried to bill itself as a more moderate party than the AP. Fraga was the first chairman of the party, with Francisco Álvarez Cascos as the secretary general.

=== Refoundation ===
====Aznar years (1989–2004)====

On 4 September 1989, and at the suggestion of Fraga himself, José María Aznar (then premier of the Autonomous Region of Castile and León) was named the party&#x27;s candidate for Prime Minister of Spain at the general elections. In April 1990, Aznar became chairman of the party. Fraga would later be named Founding Chairman of the People&#x27;s Party.

The PP joined the European People&#x27;s Party in 1991.

The PP became the largest party for the first time in 1996, and Aznar became Prime Minister with the support of the Basque Nationalist Party, the Catalan Convergence and Union and the Canarian Coalition. In the 2000 elections, the PP gained an absolute majority.

=====Foreign policy=====
Known to have a strong Atlanticist ideology, the People&#x27;s Party fostered stronger ties to the United States.

====Rajoy years (2004–2018)====

In August 2003, Mariano Rajoy was appointed Secretary General by Aznar. Thus, Rajoy became the party&#x27;s candidate for Prime Minister in the 2004 general election, held three days after the 11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings, and which Rajoy lost by a big margin to Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) leader José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero.

The PP under Mariano Rajoy opposed the PSOE government after the PP lost the general election in 2004, arguing that this victory was influenced by the Madrid bombings of 11 March 2004. At a national level, its political strategy has followed two main axes, both linked to Spain&#x27;s delicate regional politics: Firstly, opposing further administrative devolution to Catalonia by means of the newly approved &quot;Estatut&quot; or Statute of Catalonia that lays out the powers of the Catalan regional government. Secondly, opposition to political negotiations with the Basque separatist organisation ETA.

The People&#x27;s Party has supported the Association of Victims of Terrorism (AVT) with respect to the Government&#x27;s actions concerning ETA&#x27;s ceasefire, and was able to mobilise hundreds of thousands of people in demonstrations against Government policies that, in its opinion, would result in political concessions to ETA. Nevertheless, the end of the ceasefire in December 2006 ended prospects for government negotiations with ETA.

The prospect of increased demands for autonomy in the programs of Catalan and Basque parties, and Zapatero&#x27;s alleged favouring of them, became a focus for the party&#x27;s campaign for the March 2008 general election. Basque President Juan José Ibarretxe&#x27;s proposal for a unilateral referendum for the solution of the Basque Conflict was another important issue.

The People&#x27;s Party under Rajoy has an increasingly patriotic, or nationalist, element to it, appealing to the sense of &quot;Spanishness&quot; and making strong use of national symbols such as the Spanish flag. Prior to the national celebrations of Spanish Heritage Day, Rajoy made a speech asking Spaniards to &quot;privately or publicly&quot; display their pride in their nation and to honor their flag, an action which received some criticism from many political groups of the Congress.
=====2008 elections and convention=====

On 9 March 2008, Spain held a general election, with both main parties led by the same candidates who competed in 2004: 154 People&#x27;s Party MPs were elected, up six on the previous election. However, the failure to close the gap with the ruling Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (which increased its number of MPs by five) provoked a party crisis, in which some internal groups and supportive media questioned the leadership of Rajoy, who was said to be close to resigning.

After an impasse of three days, he decided to stay, and summoned a Party Convention to be held in June 2008 in Valencia. Speculation about alternative candidates erupted in the media, with discussion of the possible candidacies of Madrid Mayor Alberto Ruíz Gallardón and Madrid autonomous community Premier Esperanza Aguirre creating a national debate, calls for support and opposition from the media, etc.

In the end neither one stood, with Gallardón explicitly backing Rajoy and Aguirre refusing to comment on the issue. The only politician who explicitly expressed his intention to stand was Juan Costa, who had been a minister under Aznar, but he was unable to garner the 20% support required to stand in the election because of the support Rajoy had received prior to his nomination. At the convention, Mariano Rajoy was re-elected chairman with 79% of the vote, and in order to &quot;refresh the negative public image of the party&quot;, which had been a major factor in the electoral defeat, its leadership was controversially renewed with young people, replacing a significant number of politicians from the Aznar era.

Among the latter, most resigned of their own accord to make room for the next generation, like the PP Spokesman in the Congress of Deputies Eduardo Zaplana, replaced by Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría; and the party Secretary-General Ángel Acebes, whose office was taken by María Dolores de Cospedal.

The convention also saw significant reforms to the Party Statutes, including the reform of election to the office of Party Chairperson, which was to be open to more competition; and linking that office to the party candidacy in the general elections, etc. María San Gil, Chairwoman of the Basque PP, left the party (even resigning from her Basque Parliament seat) over disagreements on the party policies towards regional nationalisms in Spain, and particularly over the deletion of a direct reference to the Basque Nationalist Party accusing them of being too passive and &quot;contemptuous&quot; regarding the armed Basque group ETA. Most PP members rallied behind San Gil at first, but when it became clear that her decision was final the national leadership called a regional party election, in which Antonio Basagoiti was chosen as the new Basque PP leader.
The PP won a clear victory in the 2011 general elections, ousting the PSOE from government. With 44.62% of the votes, the conservatives won 186 seats in the &quot;Congreso de los Diputados&quot;, the biggest victory they have ever had. On the other hand, the centre-left PSOE suffered a huge defeat, losing 59 MPs. The PP, under Mariano Rajoy&#x27;s leadership, returned to power after 7 years of opposition.

In May 2018, the Audiencia Nacional declared the PP as guilty part &quot;on a lucrative basis&quot; in the Gürtel corruption scheme, understanding the profited from the corruption scheme &quot;to the detriment of the State&#x27;s interests&quot;. This led to a motion of no confidence to the prime minister Mariano Rajoy, led by socialist leader Pedro Sánchez, which eventually succeeded, thus forcing Rajoy to quit his position, and ultimately resign as the party&#x27;s leader. His substitute would be determined in July 2018.

====Leadership of Casado (2018–2022)====
Pablo Casado&#x27;s victory in the July 2018 PP leadership election was considered a party swing towards the right.

Polls indicated a continual decline in support for the PP in the lead-up to the April 2019 general election. Ultimately, the party achieved the worst result in its history, winning just 16.7% of the national vote – a decline of almost 16% from the 2016 election – and losing over half its seats. Though becoming only the second largest party in the Congress of Deputies, it held almost half as many seats as first placed PSOE, and was less than a single percentage point and just nine seats ahead of third placed Ciudadanos. Casado refused to resign following the poor result, and proposed a sudden U-turn of the party back into the moderate centre-right under pressure from party regional leaders one month ahead of the regional and local elections.

The party enjoyed a partial revival in 2019 European elections, winning 20.15% of votes. The party increased its support in the November 2019 election, scoring 20.82% of votes and electing 89 deputies and 83 senators. 

===== 2022 internal organisational crisis =====

After a few months of confrontation between the president of the Community of Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, and the leadership of the national branch of the party, on 16 February 2022, information appeared about an alleged payment (in the form of a commission) of Díaz Ayuso&#x27;s brother for health material and also about alleged spying on the president&#x27;s family by the party leadership through the City Council of Madrid. The president herself accused in an appearance the following day the national leadership of the PP of wanting to destroy her politically. That afternoon, the secretary general, Teodoro García Egea, appeared to deny all the information related to the attempt to spy on the president&#x27;s entourage; in this appearance, Egea informed of the opening of an informative file on the actions of the president of Madrid, which was closed the following day, considering the documentation provided valid. A few hours later, that same day, Ángel Carromero, a trusted person of the Mayor of Madrid, José Luis Martínez-Almeida, resigned after the release of some audios in which one of the detectives claimed to have been contacted from the Empresa Municipal de la Vivienda y Suelo (Municipal Housing and Land Company).

The following day, President Pablo Casado stated on the Cadena COPE radio channel that Díaz Ayuso should provide all the necessary documentation to clear doubts about his honorability, questioning at the same time his honesty by stating whether &quot;it is logical to award a commission to your brother in April 2020, when 700 people were dying in Spain due to the pandemic&quot;.

This led to a schism in the leadership of the PP, in which regional leaders and popular leaders demanded political responsibilities and a change of leadership and responsibilities in the apparatus. On 22 February there was a cascade of resignations of senior party officials and the demand by the majority of territorial barons and the Popular Parliamentary Group for the holding of an Extraordinary Congress, in addition to the request for the resignation of the Secretary General, which took place that same day. Casado finally agreed to convene the National Board of Directors on 1 March to set in motion an Extraordinary Congress of the PP. Casado was subsequently replaced as leader by Alberto Núñez Feijóo, the president of Galicia.

====Alberto Núñez Feijóo&#x27;s leadership (2022–present)====
After becoming the party&#x27;s leader, Feijóo designated Cuca Gamarra, the PP&#x27;s spokesperson in the Congress of Deputies, as the new Secretary General. After the PP took several regions—including Aragon, the Balearic Islands, and Valencia—from the PSOE in Spain&#x27;s 2023 regional and local elections, Sánchez called for a snap general election. The conservative party gained forty-eight seats in Congress and an absolute majority in the Senate, winning the elections. The PP failed to secure a parliamentary majority with its allies, Canarian Coalition, Navarrese People&#x27;s Union (UPN), and VOX; however, King of Spain Felipe VI requested that Feijóo try to form a government.

==Ideology==

Once described as the main liberal-conservative party of Spain, political scientists Vít Hlousek and Lubomír Kopeček have observed that under the leadership of José María Aznar the party evolved into a conservative party with elements of Christian democracy and economic liberalism. It has also been described as Christian humanist and conservative liberal. On the other hand, sociologist Vicenç Navarro considered the PP a conservative-neoliberal coalition with a neoliberal economic policy.

The party supports the regional structure in autonomous communities enshrined in the Constitution of 1978, as well as the constitutional monarchy.

When Spain first legalised same-sex marriage in 2005, the party was opposed to the same-sex marriage law. It did, however, support marriage-like civil unions for same-sex couples. The party organised demonstrations against the same-sex marriage law. After the law was deemed constitutional in 2012, the PP government announced that it would no longer seek the repeal of same-sex marriage. While the party has a strong socially conservative faction, some politicians from the People&#x27;s Party now support same-sex marriage. Some PP regional governments have introduced legislation against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

==Illegal financing==
In early 2009, a scandal involving several senior members of the party came to the public&#x27;s attention. The Gürtel case resulted in the resignation of the party&#x27;s treasurer Luis Bárcenas in 2009. The case against him was dropped in July 2011 but reopened the following year.

The leader of the party in the Valencia region, Francisco Camps, stepped down in July 2011 because of a pending trial. He was accused of having received gifts in exchange for public contracts, but was found to be not guilty.

===Bárcenas affair===

In January 2013, the judges&#x27; investigation discovered an account in Switzerland controlled by Luis Bárcenas with €22 million euros and another €4.5 million in the United States. Allegations appeared in the media regarding the existence of supposed illegal funds of the PP, used for the undercover monthly payments to VIPs in the party from 1989 to 2009, including the former government presidents, Mariano Rajoy and José María Aznar. The existence of such illicit funding has been denied by the PP.

=== Lezo Case ===
Judge Eloy Velasco instructing the Lezo Case in the Spanish National Court is investigating former President of the Community of Madrid, Ignacio González, former Work Minister, Eduardo Zaplana, Vice-councilor of the presidency of the Community of Madrid and implicated in Gürtel Case Alberto López Viejo, businessmen Juan Miguel Villar Mir (OHL) and PricewaterhouseCoopers among others for embezzlement of public funds to presumably finance People&#x27;s Party (PP) campaigns in the Community of Madrid.

<text>Socialist Alliance (SA) is an Australian socialist political party and activist organisation. It was founded in 2001 as an alliance of various socialist organisations and activists, initiated by the Democratic Socialist Perspective and the International Socialist Organisation.

Engaging in a combination of grassroots activism and electoral politics, Socialist Alliance has one elected officeholder in Australia, Sue Bolton in the City of Merri-bek.

The party is involved with the trade union, environmentalist and student movements in Australia. It takes strong left-wing stances on numerous issues, including refugee rights, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander rights, anti-racism, and public ownership. Socialist Alliance also proposes nationalising the banking, energy and mining sectors. On workers&#x27; rights, the party supports raising the minimum wage, implementing wage theft and industrial manslaughter laws, increasing trade union bargaining to industry-wide status and reducing the working week to 30 hours. It opposes the building of new coalmines and any attempts to privatise public services such as Medicare. The party supports expansion of the public healthcare system to cover dental services and the cessation of public funding to private schools. Policies of state branches include support for public housing, public transport, public education and publicly owned utilities, as well as advocating for less militarised and hard-line policing and justice systems.

The party participated within the Victorian Socialists electoral alliance in Victoria, until it withdrew from it in May 2020.

==History==

=== Formation and growth ===
Socialist Alliance was founded in 2001 as a loose alliance of socialist organisations and individuals. The project was initiated by the Democratic Socialist Perspective and the International Socialist Organisation. Seven other organisations were included in the initial exploratory meeting: the Freedom Socialist Party, Socialist Alternative, Socialist Democracy, Worker-communist Party of Iraq, Workers League, Worker&#x27;s Liberty, and Worker&#x27;s Power. The aim of the merger was to create greater left unity in the aftermath of the S11 protests of the World Economic Forum in Melbourne on 11–13 September 2000.

Many non-aligned socialists were attracted by the idea of left unity, and soon after its formation Socialist Alliance grew to a point where a majority of its members were not members of any of the affiliate organisations.

=== Debate on form ===
In response to this growth, the Democratic Socialist Perspective and many non-aligned members won a majority at successive national conferences for measures that would move Socialist Alliance in the direction of becoming a united socialist party, rather than simply an alliance of groups and individuals.

Most of the affiliate organisations, however, in particular the International Socialist Organisation, preferred to keep Socialist Alliance as a broad left-wing electoral front for socialist organisations and individuals.

In late 2003, the Democratic Socialist Party resolved to become &quot;a Marxist tendency in the Socialist Alliance&quot;, renaming itself the &quot;Democratic Socialist Perspective&quot; as a step towards turning the Socialist Alliance into a &quot;Multi-Tendency Socialist Party&quot;. This move was supported by some 75% of conference delegates at Socialist Alliance&#x27;s national conference that year, although other affiliates remained opposed.

The 2005 National Conference saw the emergence of a number of particularly sharp political differences. These centred on: the extent to which Socialist Alliance should criticise the Australian Labor Party; whether the organisation should have a formal relationship with the newspaper associated with the Democratic Socialist perspective, &quot;Green Left Weekly&quot;, as a step towards Socialist Alliance itself having its own newspaper; and whether non-aligned members should have an automatic majority on the organisation&#x27;s national executive.

=== Mergers and withdrawals ===
Following this conference three of the leading members of a &quot;Non-Aligned Caucus&quot; and most of the active affiliate organisations gradually withdrew from the Socialist Alliance. The &quot;Non Aligned Caucus&quot; was an &quot;ad hoc&quot; grouping of members who weren&#x27;t aligned to any affiliated organisation which formed in the lead up to the 2003 national conference.

In 2006, Workers Power left the Alliance. In 2007, the International Socialist Organisation also left.

In January 2010, the Democratic Socialist Perspective voted to merge into the Socialist Alliance, in effect ceasing to exist as an affiliate organisation.

In September 2012 the Socialist Alliance initiated unity discussions with Socialist Alternative. At the time, Socialist Alternative were in unity discussions with the Revolutionary Socialist Party (Australia) which led to a merger in early 2013.

After approximately a year of leadership discussions, joint forums and participation by Socialist Alliance at Socialist Alternative&#x27;s &quot;Marxism&quot; conference, the Socialist Alternative leadership publicly announced that they were pulling out unity discussions in November 2013, but remained open to ongoing collaboration. Socialist Alternative claimed the Socialist Alliance&#x27;s approach to a transitional program and electoral politics was &quot;not sufficiently similar to carry through a sustained and productive unity.&quot;

While the Socialist Alliance welcomed the opportunity for ongoing collaboration, it was critical of Socialist Alternative&#x27;s reasons for withdrawal. Leading Socialist Alliance member Dave Holmes accused the Socialist Alternative of &quot;sticking with its very narrow, propagandist view of socialist politics&quot; rather than seeking to unite to appeal to socialists more broadly. The Socialist Alliance published the full correspondence on the unity discussions in its discussion bulletin, &quot;Alliance Voices&quot;.

At its national conference in 2014, the socialist youth organisation Resistance voted to merge with the Socialist Alliance and become its official youth organisation. The new organisation renamed itself Resistance: Young Socialist Alliance.

Resistance elects its own leadership body to coordinate the party&#x27;s youth work and organise its youth conference, Radical Ideas.

===Victorian Socialists===

On 5 February 2018, it was announced that Socialist Alliance, the Socialist Alternative, community activists and trade unionists would work together to form an electoral alliance named the Victorian Socialists in order to contest the 2018 Victorian state election. The leading candidates for the Northern Metropolitan Region included Yarra councillor Stephen Jolly, and also featured Moreland councillor Sue Bolton (Socialist Alliance) and asbestos lawyer Colleen Bolger (Socialist Alternative). Socialist Alliance&#x27;s Tim Gooden, former Geelong Trades Hall Secretary and CFMEU organiser, led the ticket for the Western Victoria Region. Although the party gained 4.6% of the vote, the highest of any minor party in the Northern Metropolitan Region, it failed to win a seat following preference deals.

The Victorian Socialists ran candidates in the electorates of Calwell, Wills, and Cooper during the 2019 federal election, gaining 4.6%, 4.5%, and 4.2% of the vote respectively.

In 2020 Socialist Alliance withdrew from Victorian Socialists.

==Branches and membership numbers==

In addition to having branches in major capital cities Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Canberra, and Hobart. The Socialist Alliance also maintains branches in and around a number of minor cities and regional areas, including in the Blue Mountains, Cairns, Geelong, Illawarra, New England and Newcastle. The Socialist Alliance also has individual members spread across rural and regional Australia.

A branch in Fremantle existed, it included a branch office and a library.

The Socialist Alliance is a registered political party at a federal level, and annually maintains electoral registration in New South Wales and in Victoria.

Federal registration requires 500 members, Victorian registration also requires 500 members in Victoria, and 750 members are needed for NSW registration.

These figures reflect electorally registered members, however, and may not be an accurate measure of active or financial membership. A Socialist Alliance Perspectives resolution published in &quot;Alliance Voices&quot; in February 2012, suggests a membership figure of approximately 600.

Socialist Alliance members are generally organised in branches of at least 7 voting members who &quot;...must pay an annual membership fee.&quot;, however the party Constitution allows for &quot;at large&quot; members living in areas with no nearby branch structure to join.

==Publications==
Socialist Alliance&#x27;s policy and constitution can be found on its website.

The newspaper &quot;Green Left Weekly&quot; – which is politically associated with the Socialist Alliance – runs a weekly Socialist Alliance column called &quot;Our Common Cause&quot;. The Socialist Alliance also has a close working relationship with &quot;Links – International Journal of Socialist Renewal&quot;. The Brisbane local newspaper &quot;The Westender&quot; has also run a column written by the Socialist Alliance, and its members have been published on sites such as ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Drum&quot; and &quot;Online Opinion&quot;.

For around one year the Socialist Alliance published a quarterly journal, &quot;Seeing Red&quot;, the final issue of which came out in March 2006.

The Socialist Alliance and its members have also published a large number of pamphlets and books, primarily through Resistance Books, on a range of historical, political and social justice issues.

Before Green Left&#x27;s website became the dominant means by which Socialist Alliance published written material online, they maintained a variety of blogs. Their internal discussion bulletin and national newsletter &#x27;Alliance Voices&#x27; was maintained until 2014. Their West Australian branch maintained a blog until 2016. Socialist Alliance local councillors Sam Wainwright and Sue Bolton maintained individual websites until 2009 and 2013 respectively.

== Grassroots campaigning ==
While Socialist Alliance, its affiliates and non-aligned members continue to put forward and argue for socialist politics in the electoral arena, the organisation places a stronger emphasis on building successful grassroots campaigns as a way of promoting socialist politics. In the recent unity discussions with Socialist Alternative, the Socialist Alliance re-emphasised its support for this &quot;transitional method&quot; towards campaigns, arguing that campaign work is key to leading people to understanding the need to transform the whole capitalist system.

Socialist Alliance has been involved in a broad range of campaigns since its formation, reflecting both its own developing political orientation, as well as the activities and politics of its affiliates. These include in trade union movement, education, and environmentalist movements, as well as numerous other grass roots campaigns including refugee rights, same-sex marriage rights, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander rights, climate change, and international solidarity with movements such as the Palestinian struggle for national self-determination, the Rojava revolution and the Bolivarian Revolution in Latin America, and social-justice and pro-democracy movements in South East Asia.

=== Industrial ===

Socialist Alliance places great importance on strengthening the union movement, with members active in a range of unions including, amongst others, the Australian Services Union, the Australian Education Union, the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, the Australian Nursing Federation, the Community and Public Sector Union, the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, the Electrical Trades Union, the Finance Sector Union, the National Tertiary Education Union, the National Union of Workers, the New South Wales Teachers Federation, the Rail, Tram and Bus Industry Union, the Transport Workers Union and United Voice.

In line with its criticism that the ALP is holding back and bureaucratising the union movement, Socialist Alliance encourages workers and unions to become independent of the ALP, to strengthen democracy in the unions and to set up a &quot;new workers&#x27; party&quot;. However, it also works alongside rank-and-file union members on industrial campaigns, regardless of political affiliation.

In 2005 and 2006, the Socialist Alliance initiated and helped organise trade union &quot;fight-back&quot; conferences, in response to the Federal Government&#x27;s &quot;WorkChoices&quot; legislation, attracting hundreds of union militants and members of other socialist groups. The Socialist Alliance was involved in the Your Rights at Work campaign against WorkChoices that followed, as well as the campaign to abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission (ABCC).

Socialist Alliance has been highly critical of the Australian Labor Party&#x27;s industrial policy for not returning enough rights to workers and for retaining the ABCC, describing the Rudd government&#x27;s Fair Work Australia as little more than &quot;WorkChoices-lite&quot;.

Notable Socialist Alliance trade union leaders have included Chris Cain, Western Australian State Secretary of the Maritime Union of Australia; Tim Gooden, former secretary of the Geelong Trades and Labour Council; and Craig Johnston, former Victorian State Secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, who was jailed for 9 months in 2004 after an industrial dispute at Johnson Tiles in 2001.

===Anti-war and civil liberties===
Socialist Alliance is opposed to US and Australian military interventions such as the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. Socialist Alliance, its affiliates and members played a central role in the campaigns against these wars in 2001 and 2003. Socialist Alliance also played a leading role in founding the Stop the War Coalition in a number of cities, and organising protests in the years that followed.

Socialist Alliance members are also active in promoting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign against Israel.

Socialist Alliance opposes the &quot;war on terror&quot;, claiming that it leads to increased racism against Arab and Muslim communities, and to government policies that threaten civil liberties. Socialist Alliance members were central to organising the protests in Sydney against APEC in 2007, and the visit of Pope Benedict XVI in 2008, in the face of increased police powers that were heavily criticised for violating civil liberties.

The party conducts this work alongside other activist and community groups as well as individual activists in broader coalitions like the Stop the War Coalition, and the Gaza Defence Committee.

===The environment===

Socialist Alliance is involved in a variety of campaigns around environmental issues, most notably climate change, helping to organise the 2006 Walk Against Warming rallies in some cities, and producing detailed policies on combating climate change which have been created through an open wiki process with broad membership input. Since the 2007 Federal Election, the environmental website VoteClimate has rated Socialist Alliance environmental policy number 1 (ahead of the Greens).

Socialist Alliance members also helped to organise the Climate Action Summit in Canberra on 31 January – 1 February 2009, and is involved in building the new national Climate Action Network that grew out of that summit.

Socialist Alliance argues that no solution to the crisis caused by global warming is possible without overthrowing capitalism, and criticises &quot;market mechanisms&quot; such as carbon trading as being unworkable, profit-driven and reinforcing the capitalist relations that it alleges caused the pollution to begin with.

===Indigenous rights===
Socialist Alliance has played a role in recent campaigns for justice for indigenous Australians, particularly around the inquiries into the deaths-in-custody of TJ Hickey in Redfern and Mulrunji Doomadgee on Palm Island. In the case of Mulrunji, leading indigenous activist, academic and Socialist Alliance member Sam Watson played a key role in organising the protests that led to the re-opening of the inquiry.

Socialist Alliance also opposes the Federal Government&#x27;s Northern Territory intervention, and helped to organise the 12 February 2008 protests outside Parliament House in Canberra.

===Anti-racism and immigrants rights===
Socialist Alliance has been able to build growing support among some ethnic community sectors in urban Australia such as among Somali youth, the Tamil community and from within the Latin American community. In the latter case, the Socialist Alliance has been an active supporter of the Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela and is affiliated to the Australia Venezuela Solidarity Network.

Socialist Alliance members have also been involved in the struggle for refugee rights, opposing mandatory detention of illegal immigrants, and calling for Australia to pursue a more humane policy on refugees.

===Public services===

Socialist Alliance advocate the provision of quality public services by all levels of government, calling for increased funding in public education, healthcare, housing and transport. They also advocate expanding the public sector with the nationalisation of large multinational corporations. Furthermore, the party calls for capitalist enterprises that have received taxpayer-subsidies to either repay their subsidies back to the taxpayers in full or be nationalised without compensation.

Socialist Alliance is involved in campaigns against privatisation like those planned by the New South Wales Government (for example electricity and prisons), alongside the Greens, unions, ALP members and community groups. They maintain that all privatisations must be reversed with nationalisation.

===Social justice===
Socialist Alliance is also active in a number of other social justice campaigns, including LGBTI rights, women&#x27;s liberation, welfare rights, and prison reform, as well as around local issues. After an editorial by OUTinPerth accusing socialists of taking over the movement for equal marriage rights, prominent LGBTIQ campaigner and Socialist Alliance member Farida Iqbal issued a reply arguing that the Socialist Alliance and others had played a prominent role in the Australian movement for marriage equality since it began in 2004.

===International solidarity===
The party also places a large emphasis on international socialist solidarity. It is actively involved in supporting many left-wing movements around the world, such as those relating to Venezuela and the Bolivarian Revolution in Latin America, Palestinian resistance, Kurdish self-determination in North Syria. Socialist Alliance also actively campaigns in solidarity with international pro-democracy movements as far ranging as Latin America,
the Middle East,
Western Sahara, Zimbabwe, South East Asia, and elsewhere.

==Election results==
While the Socialist Alliance participates in elections, standing candidates at a range of levels, it does not see electoral politics as the most important vehicle for building socialism. Rather, it sees its participation in elections not as a way &quot;to &quot;represent&quot; people&#x27;s movements, but as a way to strengthen them and help them win their demands&quot;. Socialist Alliance candidates also pledge to take only an average wage if elected, donating the remainder into the social movements.

===Federal===
The Socialist Alliance first campaigned in the 2001 federal election, however, candidates were listed as independents on the ballot as its application for electoral registration was suspended when the election was called early.

===State===
====New South Wales====
====Victoria====
The Socialist Alliance first ran in the 2002 Victorian state election, securing 3,274 votes or 0.11% of the vote. In 2006, the party&#x27;s vote dropped to 1,102 or 0.04%. In 2010 the party won 1,787 votes, or 0.06%. The results were stable for the next election in 2014 at 1,728 votes, 0.05% of the vote. For the 2018 election, the Socialist Alliance ran as part of the Victorian Socialists, which won 15,442 votes (0.44%) in the Legislative Assembly and 32,603 votes (0.91%) in the Legislative Council.

===Council===
In the 2004 Victorian local government elections, Socialist Alliance did relatively well in two councils in Melbourne. In the Moreland City Council elections, two candidates exceeded 4%. In the election in the Boroondara City Council, a Socialist Alliance candidate won over 12% of the vote (in the absence of an Australian Labor Party-endorsed candidate) in Cotham ward.

The 2008 Victorian local government election results were also positive. The Socialist Alliance polled almost 19% in the Stoney Creek ward of the Melbourne municipality of Maribyrnong and polled over 10% in all wards bar one that it contested across the state.

In October 2009 the Socialist Alliance won its first election when Sam Wainwright was elected for the Hilton Ward of the Fremantle City Council. In October 2013, Sam Wainwright was re-elected to Fremantle&#x27;s Hilton Ward with an outright majority of 58.33%.

In October 2012 The Socialist Alliance won its second election when Sue Bolton was elected to Moreland City Council in Melbourne&#x27;s northern suburbs.
Merri-bek Council (renamed from Moreland in 2022) gained a second Socialist Alliance councillor in March 2022 when Monica Harte was elected on a countback to replace disgraced Labor property developer Milad el-Halabi.

Bolton, Harte, and Wainwright, along with Stephen Jolly in Yarra City Council and the Victorian Socialists&#x27; Jorge Jorquera in Maribyrnong City Council, are currently the only politicians in Australia elected on an explicitly socialist platform.

<doc id="404733" wikidata="Q6638318" url="?curid=404733" title="List of sex-related court cases in the United States">
<text>The United States Supreme Court and various U.S. state courts have decided several cases regarding pornography, sexual activity, and reproductive rights. The trend has been one of courts striking down states&#x27; attempts to regulate sex.

The following is a list of noteworthy sex-related court cases in order by date. (Note that in the legal sense, the term &quot;sodomy&quot; often applies not only to anal sex but also to oral sex and other sex acts.)

*&quot;Buck v. Bell&quot;, *. A law which allowed the state to sterilize the mentally handicapped is constitutional.
* &quot;United States v. One Package of Japanese Pessaries&quot;, 86 F.2d 737 (2nd Cir. 1936). The Comstock act&#x27;s prohibition against birth control products or information as obscene/lewd or lascivious was held to not apply to shipments from a physician. The federal government could not interfere with doctors providing contraception to their patients.
*&quot;Skinner v. State of Oklahoma Ex Rel. Williamson&quot;, *. A law punishing certain classes of criminals with sterilization is unconstitutional.
* &quot;Roth v. United States&quot;, *. Obscenity is defined as material that &quot;to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material, taken as a whole, appeals to prurient interest&quot;.
* &quot;One, Inc. v. Olesen&quot;, *. Applying the Roth test, the Court rules that homosexual content is not by definition obscene.
*&quot;Poe v. Ullman&quot;, *. In the absence of an actual threat of prosecution, plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge Connecticut law making use of contraceptives illegal.
*&quot;McLaughlin v. Florida&quot;, *. The law prohibiting an unmarried interracial couple from habitually living in and occupying the same room in the nighttime that does not apply to couples of the same race violates equal protection clause.
*&quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot;, , 85 S.Ct. 1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 *. Laws prohibiting the distribution of condoms to married persons are unconstitutional.
*&quot;Stanley v. Georgia&quot;, *. Mere possession of obscene material in one&#x27;s home cannot be made a crime.
* &quot;Franklin v. State&quot;, 257 So.2d 21 (Fla. 1971) *. Florida Supreme Court finds law against &quot;crimes against nature&quot; unconstitutionally vague in the case of consensual sodomy, thus the crime could now only be charged under a different, lesser statute, reducing the penalty from a felony to a misdemeanor.
*&quot;Eisenstadt v. Baird&quot;, *. Overturned Massachusetts law that made giving contraceptives to unmarried persons a felony.
*&quot;Miller v. California&quot;, *. For a publication to be considered obscene, taken as a whole, it must appear to &quot;the average person, applying contemporary community standards&quot;, to appeal to the prurient interest, depict sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.
*&quot;Jenkins v. Georgia&quot;, *. Theatre manager&#x27;s conviction of &quot;the crime of distributing obscene material&quot; for showing the film &quot;Carnal Knowledge&quot; overturned as the film is not obscene.
*&quot;Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn&quot;, A law that prohibits releasing the name of a rape victim is generally unconstitutional.
*&quot;State of Iowa v. Robert Eugene Pilcher&quot;, 242 N.W.2d 348 (Iowa 1976)*. A law against consensual sodomy with someone not one&#x27;s spouse is unconstitutional.

*&quot;Carey v. Population Services International&quot;, *. Statute prohibiting sale or distribution of contraceptives to a minor under 16; for anyone other than a licensed pharmacist to distribute contraceptives to persons 16 or over; and for anyone, including licensed pharmacists, to advertise or display contraceptives, is unconstitutional.
*&quot;Stump v. Sparkman&quot;, *. A judge who ordered the sterilization of an allegedly retarded young woman was immune from civil suit even though he did not hold a hearing to receive evidence or appoint an attorney to represent the woman&#x27;s interests.
*&quot;People v. Onofre&quot;, 415 N.E.2d 936 (N.Y. 1980) *. A New York State law against consensual sodomy is unconstitutional.
*&quot;Commonwealth v. Sefranka&quot;, 414 N.E.2d 602, (Mass. 1980) *. The term &quot;lewd, wanton and lascivious person&quot; used in a Massachusetts sex crime statute was unconstitutionally vague as it applied to consenting adults.

*&quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot;, *. Sodomy between people of the same sex in the privacy of one&#x27;s home may be made illegal. (The statute was later struck down on State Constitutional grounds; see &quot;Powell v. Georgia&quot; below. This case was later overturned; see &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; below.)
*&quot;State v. Henry&quot;, 302 Or. 510, 732 P2d 9 (1987) * The Oregon Supreme Court ruled that the concept of obscenity violated the free speech clause of the state constitution and abolished the offense of obscenity in that state.

*&quot;State of Idaho v. Holden&quot;, 890 P.2d 341 (Idaho Ct. App. 1995)*. A statute prohibiting private consensual oral sodomy between married persons is unconstitutional, because it infringes upon the constitutional right of privacy.

*&quot;Gryczan v. Montana&quot;, 942 P.2d 112 (1997)*. The Montana State Supreme Court finds law against consensual sodomy unconstitutional.

The Georgia State Supreme Court finds the law making consensual sodomy a crime which was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Bowers&quot; to be unconstitutional as violating the &quot;state&quot; Constitution&#x27;s privacy protections.

<text>Granborough (previously Grandborough) is a village and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England. It is around north of Waddesdon and south-east of Buckingham. The nearest town is Winslow.

The village name is Anglo-Saxon in origin, and means &#x27;green hill&#x27;. In the Domesday Book of 1086 the village was recorded as &quot;Grenesberga&quot;.

Anciently the manor of Granborough was owned by the abbey at St Albans, though in the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1547 ownership passed automatically to the Crown.

The ancient parish church, dedicated to St John the Baptist, was demolished during the English Civil War, though was rebuilt shortly after the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1685.

The village is still one of the possessions of the Crown.

There is a public house, logically called the Crown. After the parish church the most interesting building is the neat half-timbered Arts and Crafts village hall. Granborough still has very many thatched cottages and houses, many of them in Green End, a hamlet attached to the village.

<text>The Democratic Party of Turkmenistan (, , TDP) is a political party in Turkmenistan founded in 1991. It has been the ruling party of the country since its foundation.

The party was led by former Soviet provincial party leader Saparmurat Niyazov from the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s until his death in 2006. In 2013, President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow suspended his party membership for the duration of his presidency. The current leader is Ata Serdarow. The party&#x27;s rule is described as authoritarian or totalitarian.

==History==
The TDP was created following the dissolution of the Soviet Union as a successor party to the Communist Party of Turkmenistan. The internal structure of the old party was effectively unchanged in the transition, as was the old guard. The TDP has faced limited and sporadic challenges from alternative political parties in the past but have never faced a significant challenge during an election because of the often repressive nature of politics in the country. Opposition parties are usually crushed before they make any significant grounds in public opinion. This has been the case even after the formal legalisation of opposition parties in 2010.

==Policies==
Due to the lack of opposition parties to contest for government, the TDP controls most, if not all, industries of significant revenue directly. Central planning is a key element of party policy and serves as the basis of functionality for government services. The party&#x27;s ideology of &quot;Turkmen nationalism&quot; was theorised by former party leader Saparmurat Niyazov for the purpose of an authoritarian state ideology in Turkmenistan.

==Chairmen==
==Election results==

Turkmenistan elects on the national level a head of state - the president - and a legislature. Elections in Turkmenistan have been widely criticised for being completely fraudulent and attempting to give an appearance of legitimacy to what is in reality a dictatorship.

=== Presidential elections ===
The last presidential election was held in 2022.
===Legislative elections===
The Assembly is a 125-member legislative body officially led by the president of Turkmenistan. The DPT, not unlike every other facet of political life in Turkmenistan, holds a majority of seats, with accusations that the multi-party system established in the early 2010s only consists of bloc parties, nominally independent but loyal to the DPT. The last election for the assembly was held in 2023.

<text>Tissue culture is the growth of tissues or cells in an artificial medium separate from the parent organism. This technique is also called micropropagation. This is typically facilitated via use of a liquid, semi-solid, or solid growth medium, such as broth or agar. Tissue culture commonly refers to the culture of animal cells and tissues, with the more specific term plant tissue culture being used for plants. The term &quot;tissue culture&quot; was coined by American pathologist Montrose Thomas Burrows. This is possible only in certain conditions. It also requires more attention. It can be done only in genetic labs with various chemicals.

== Historical use ==

In 1885 Wilhelm Roux removed a section of the medullary plate of an embryonic chicken and maintained it in a warm saline solution for several days, establishing the basic principle of tissue culture. In 1907 the zoologist Ross Granville Harrison demonstrated the growth of frog embryonic cells that would give rise to nerve cells in a medium of clotted lymph. In 1913, E. Steinhardt, C. Israeli, and R. A. Lambert grew vaccinia virus in fragments of guinea pig corneal tissue. In 1996, the first use of regenerative tissue was used to replace a small length of urethra, which led to the understanding that the technique of obtaining samples of tissue, growing it outside the body without a scaffold, and reapplying it, can be used for only small distances of less than 1 cm.

Gottlieb Haberlandt first pointed out the possibilities of the culture of isolated tissues, plant tissue culture. He suggested that the potentialities of individual cells via tissue culture as well as that the reciprocal influences of tissues on one another could be determined by this method. Since Haberlandt&#x27;s original assertions, methods for tissue and cell culture have been realized, leading to significant discoveries in biology and medicine. His original idea, presented in 1902, was called totipotentiality: &quot;Theoretically all plant cells are able to give rise to a complete plant.&quot;

==Modern usage==
In modern usage, &quot;Tissue culture&quot; generally refers to the growth of cells from a multicellular organism &quot;in vitro&quot;. These cells may be cells isolated from a donor organism (primary cells) or an immortalised cell line. The cells are bathed in a culture medium, which contains essential nutrients and energy sources necessary for the cells&#x27; survival. Thus, in its broader sense, &quot;tissue culture&quot; is often used interchangeably with &quot;cell culture&quot;. On the other hand, the strict meaning of &quot;tissue culture&quot; refers to the culturing of tissue pieces, i.e. explant culture.

Tissue culture is an important tool for the study of the biology of cells from multicellular organisms. It provides an &quot;in vitro&quot; model of the tissue in a well defined environment which can be easily manipulated and analysed. In animal tissue culture, cells may be grown as two-dimensional monolayers (conventional culture) or within fibrous scaffolds or gels to attain more naturalistic three-dimensional tissue-like structures (3D culture). Eric Simon, in a 1988 NIH SBIR grant report, showed that electrospinning could be used to produce nano- and submicron-scale polymeric fibrous scaffolds specifically intended for use as &quot;in vitro&quot; cell and tissue substrates. This early use of electrospun fibrous lattices for cell culture and tissue engineering showed that various cell types would adhere to and proliferate upon polycarbonate fibers. It was noted that as opposed to the flattened morphology typically seen in 2D culture, cells grown on the electrospun fibers exhibited a more rounded 3-dimensional morphology generally observed of tissues &quot;in vivo&quot;.

Plant tissue culture in particular is concerned with the growing of entire plants from small pieces of plant tissue, cultured in medium. The technique of plant tissue culture, i.e., culturing plant cells or tissues in artificial medium supplemented with required nutrients, has many applications in efficient clonal propagation (true to the type or similar) which may be difficult via conventional breeding methods. Tissue culture is used in creating genetically modified plants, as it allows scientists to introduce DNA changes to plant tissue via &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot; or a gene gun and then generate a full plant from these modified cells.

Tissue cultures are commonly used in plant propagation. The advantage of such vegetative propagation is that it obtains a large amount of homogeneous material, which is of great importance in the propagation of valuable cultivars of ornamental plants, and rootstocks for fruit trees. In addition, fruit plants or flowers can be obtained free of viruses, phytoplasmas, viroids.

Because plant cells are totipotent, adding growth hormones to the media can trigger the callus cells to develop roots, shoots and entire plants.

== Animal tissue culture ==
There are three common methods to establish cell culture from animals. The first is organ culture where whole organs from embryos or partial adult organs are used to initiate the organ culture &quot;in vitro&quot;. These cells retain their differentiated character and functional activity in organ culture. The second method is primary explant culture, in which fragments derived from animal tissue are attached to a surface using an extracellular matrix component (ECM), such as collagen or a plasma clot. This culture is known as a primary explant, and migrating cells are known as outgrowth. This has been used to analyze the growth characteristics of cancer cells in comparison to their normal counterparts. The third method is cell culture, of which there are three types: (1) precursor cell culture, i.e. undifferentiated cells that are to be differentiate, (2) differentiated cell culture, i.e. completely differentiated cells that have lost the capacity to further differentiate, and (3) stem cell culture, i.e. undifferentiated cells that can develop into any kind of cell.&quot;

== Applications of animal cell culture ==
Animal cell culture is used for many research purposes and commercial business also as:

* Vaccine production 
* Monoclonal antibody production 
* Enzymes and hormones production 
* In vitro skin and other tissues and organs by stem culturing 
* Viral cultivation

== Establishing a cell line ==
A cell line can be defined as a permanently established cell culture which will propagate forever. Investigators mostly get cell lines from other investigators or from cell banks (such as the American Type Culture Collection) , because its much easier than creating new one. In special cases, investigators are obligated to establish a cell line. To do this you must use one of the following cells:

Transformed cell lines, Tumor tissue or Transforming normal cell in vitro

== Subculture ==
Subculture is the transfer of cells from one culture to start a new one. During this process the proliferating cells are subdivided, to form new cell lines.

== Stem cell technology ==
The most advanced tissue culture science is now focused on stem cells, stem cells can be used for tissue replacement or either organs. stem cell is a primitive type of cell which has the ability to differentiate to all the 220 cell types found in human body. Stem cells can be obtained from blood, brain, or muscle tissue but the most important one is from early embryos which has the capability to differentiate to any other cell.

<text>The Communist Party of Turkmenistan (; ) was the ruling communist party of the Turkmen SSR which operated as a republican branch of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. From 1985, it was led by Saparmurat Niyazov. On 16 December 1991, as the Soviet Union was in the process of dissolving, Niyazov reorganized the CPT as the Democratic Party of Turkmenistan. The current Communist Party of Turkmenistan was made illegal during the presidency of Niyazov after independence and remains banned.

<text>Constance (Breton: &quot;Konstanza&quot;; c. 1161c. 5 September 1201) was Duchess of Brittany from 1166 to her death in 1201 and Countess of Richmond from 1171 to 1201. Constance was the daughter of Duke Conan IV by his wife, Margaret of Huntingdon, a sister of the Scottish kings Malcolm IV and William I.

==Life and reign==
Constance&#x27;s father Conan IV had reunited the Duchy of Brittany in wars with Henry II of England. After the wars with Henry II, Conan IV faced rebellions from some Breton nobles. He appealed to Henry II for assistance in putting down those rebellions.

In 1166, Henry invaded Brittany in order to punish the local barons&#x27; revolt. In order to gain complete control over the duchy, he forced Conan IV into abdicating in Constance&#x27;s favor and betrothing her to his fourth legitimate son Geoffrey. Five-year-old Constance succeeded him as Duchess of Brittany.

She spent her youth at the English court.

In February 1171, Conan IV died. Although his daughter Constance was the heiress of the Earldom of Richmond, she did not enter her inheritance until 1183/1184.

In 1181, twenty-year-old Constance was forced into marriage with Geoffrey. On 19 August 1186 Geoffrey was trampled to death in a riding accident during a tournament in Paris. Constance thereafter became the effective ruler of Brittany.

However, on 3 February 1188, Henry II of England arranged for Constance to marry Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester, one of the most powerful earls in England. Though Ranulf called himself, not consistently, duke of Brittany, he never had the control of the duchy, and is not known to have played an important role there, and the Bretons, as well as Constance, never acknowledged him as duke, and excluded him from the government of the duchy.

After King Richard I ascended the English throne, he strengthened his intervention in Brittany. Maintaining custody of Geoffrey&#x27;s and Constance&#x27;s daughter, Eleanor, might have been a condition for him to allow Constance to continue ruling. In 1190, Constance appeared at Richard&#x27;s court at Tours.

In 1191, Richard officially proclaimed his nephew, Constance&#x27;s son, Arthur, as his heir in a treaty signed with Philip II of France.

To promote her son Arthur&#x27;s position and inheritance, Constance included him in the government of the duchy in 1196. In response to this act that thwarted his projects, Richard summoned her to Bayeux and had her abducted by Ranulf in Pontorson and imprisoned in Saint-James de Beuvron. He spread the rumour that Constance had been imprisoned for matrimonial reasons. As a result, rebellions were sparked across Brittany on her behalf and Arthur was sent to Brest. Richard demanded that hostages were delivered to him in exchange for Constance&#x27;s freedom. The Bretons agreed but Constance and the hostages remained imprisoned and rebellions went on. Richard eventually bowed to growing pressure and had the Duchess released in 1198. Back in Brittany, Constance had her marriage annulled.

On 1 June 1199, Pope Innocent III eventually decided that the Archbishopric of Dol should be subordinated to the Metropolitan of Tours and deprived the archbishop of his title and pallium. The archbishopric then became a bishopric again. Constance disagreed with this decision, which gave an advantage to Philip Augustus over Brittany, and was consequently excommunicated.

Constance took Guy of Thouars as her next husband in September or October 1199.

Between 1198 and the time of her death due to complications from delivering twin daughters, Constance ruled with her son Arthur as co-ruler. Throughout these years, Constance advised her son towards a French alliance, pursuing the policy of her late husband Geoffrey II. 

At her request Eleanor was released from royal custody and united with her and Arthur in France.

==Family==

As a girl, Constance could not inherit the duchy at her father&#x27;s death if she had a brother. A charter by Margaret, Constance&#x27;s mother, seems to show that she and Conan had more than one child. However, two charters made by Constance and her son Arthur towards 1200 mention a brother of Constance, William &quot;clericus&quot;. As a boy, William should logically have inherited the duchy after Conan, as the Duchy of Brittany followed male-preference primogeniture at the time. According to Everard, Henry II&#x27;s forcing Constance&#x27;s father into abdicating in 1166 was meant to prevent any son of the Duke from inheriting the duchy. Henry also probably used the precedent created by Conan III himself when he disinherited his son Hoël in favour of his daughter Bertha to impose Constance&#x27;s succession.

Constance and Geoffrey had three children:
*Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany (1182/1184–1241)
* Matilda (c. 1185 – bef. 1189)
*Arthur I, Duke of Brittany (1187–1203) - Geoffrey&#x27;s posthumous son

Constance and Guy had two daughters: 
* Alix of Thouars (1200–1221); she married Peter Mauclerc, the first Breton ruler of the House of Dreux; and 
* Catherine of Thouars (1201c. 1240), Dame of Vitre; she married Andrew III, Baron of Vitré, son of Andrew II, Baron of Vitré and Eustacie of Rays; her husband was noteworthy for rebuilding the Château de Vitré

Several sources indicate that Constance might have had a third daughter by Guy:
* Margaret of Thouars (12011216/1220); she was the first wife of Geoffrey, Viscount of Rohan

==Death and Burial==
Constance died, age 40, on 5 September 1201 at Nantes. She was buried at Villeneuve Abbey near Nantes, which she had founded earlier that year.

Constance&#x27;s cause of death is debated. The &quot;Chronique de Tours&quot; indicated that she died of leprosy but this statement is doubtful. It is also believed that she died from complications of childbirth, shortly after delivering twin daughters. 

== Portrayals ==
=== In literature ===
Constance of Brittany appears in several literary works, including:
* &quot;The Troublesome Reign of King John&quot; (c.1589) anonymous tragedy
* &quot;King John&quot; (1593–1596) tragedy by William Shakespeare
* &quot;Jean sans Terre ou la mort d’Arthur&quot; (1791) by Jean-François Ducis
* &quot;King John&quot; (1800) by Richard Valpy
* &quot;La Mort d’Arthur de Bretagne&quot; (1826) poem by Alexis Fossé
* &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; (2005), &quot;Devil&#x27;s Brood&quot; (2008), &quot;Lionheart&quot; (2011) and &quot;A King&#x27;s Ransom&quot; (2014) novels by Sharon Kay Penman

Constance is also mentioned in the poem &quot;Le petit Arthur de Bretagne à la tour de Rouen&quot; (1822) by Marceline Desbordes-Valmore, the drama &quot;Arthur de Bretagne&quot; (1885) by Louis Tiercelin and the novels &quot;Le Loup blanc&quot; (1843) by Paul Féval, &quot;Le Poids d’une couronne (légende bretonne)&quot; (1867–1868) by Gabrielle d’Étampes, the second volume of the trilogy &quot;Le Château des Poulfenc&quot; (2009) by Brigitte Coppin and, along with her daughters Matilda, Alix and Catherine and her third husband Guy of Thouars in the novel &quot;Dans l’Ombre du Passé&quot; (2020) by Léa Chaillou.

=== In theatre and television ===
Constance is a character in the play &quot;King John&quot; by William Shakespeare, in which she has several very eloquent speeches on grief and death. On screen, she has been portrayed by Julia Neilson in the silent short &quot;King John&quot; (1899), which recreates John&#x27;s death scene at the end of the play, Sonia Dresdel in the &quot;BBC Sunday Night Theatre&quot; version (1952), and Claire Bloom in the BBC Shakespeare version (1984). In the ITC series &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;, she appeared in five episodes variously played by Dorothy Alison (series 1 and 2), Pamela Alan (series 3) and Patricia Marmont (series 4). She was also played by Paula Williams (as a girl) and Nina Francis (as an adult) in the BBC TV drama series &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Crown&quot; (1978).

<doc id="404748" wikidata="Q19079" url="?curid=404748" title="Republican People's Party">
<text>The Republican People&#x27;s Party (, , acronymized as CHP , or RPP) is a Kemalist and social democratic political party in Turkey. It is the oldest political party in Turkey, founded by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the first president and founder of the modern Republic of Türkiye. The party is also cited as the founding party of modern Turkey. Its logo consists of the Six Arrows, which represent the foundational principles of Kemalism: republicanism, reformism, laicism (Laïcité/Secularism), populism, nationalism, and statism. It is currently the second largest party in Grand National Assembly with 133 MPs, behind the ruling conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP).

The political party has its origins in the various resistance groups founded during the Turkish War of Independence, most of whom were previously members of the Committee of Union and Progress. Under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, they united in the 1919 Sivas Congress. In 1923, the &quot;People&#x27;s Party&quot;, soon adding the word &quot;Republican&quot; to its name, declared itself to be a political organisation and announced the establishment of the Turkish Republic, with Atatürk as its first president. As Turkey moved into its authoritarian one-party period, the CHP was the apparatus of implementing far reaching political, cultural, social, and economic reforms in the country.

After World War II, Atatürk&#x27;s successor, İsmet İnönü, allowed for multi-party elections, and the party initiated a peaceful transition of power after losing the 1950 election, ending the one-party period and beginning Turkey&#x27;s multi-party period. The years following the 1960 military coup saw the party gradually trend towards the center-left, which was cemented once Bülent Ecevit became chairman in 1972. The CHP, along with all other political parties of the time, was banned by the military junta of 1980. The CHP was re-established with its original name by Deniz Baykal on 9 September 1992, with the participation of a majority of its members from the pre-1980 period. Since 2002 it has been the main opposition party to the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). Özgür Özel is the chairman of the CHP since 5 November 2023.

CHP is an associate member of the Party of European Socialists (PES), a member of the Socialist International, and the Progressive Alliance. Many politicians of CHP have declared their support for LGBT rights and the feminist movement in Turkey. The party is pro-European and supports Turkish membership to European Union and NATO.

== History ==
===Establishment: 1919–1923===

The Republican People&#x27;s Party has its origins in the resistance organizations, known as Defence of Rights Associations, created in the immediate aftermath of World War I in the Turkish War of Independence. In the Sivas Congress, Mustafa Kemal Pasha (Atatürk) and his colleagues united the Defence of Rights Associations into the Association for the Defence of National Rights of Anatolia and Rumelia (&quot;Anadolu ve Rumeli Müdâfaa-i Hukuk Cemiyeti&quot;) (A–RMHC), and called for elections in the Ottoman Empire to elect representatives associated with the organization. Most members of the A–RMHC were previously associated with the Committee of Union and Progress.

After the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies, A–RMHC members proclaimed the Grand National Assembly as a counter government from the Ottoman government in Istanbul. The Grand National Assembly forces militarily defeated Greece, France, and Armenia, overthrew the Ottoman government, and abolished the monarchy. After the 1923 election, the A–RMHC was transformed into a political party called the People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Halk Fırkası&quot;) soon changing its name to Republican People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Cumhuriyet Halk Fırkası&quot;, and then &quot;Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi&quot;) (CHP). With a united parliament, the republic was proclaimed with Atatürk as its first president, the Treaty of Lausanne was ratified, and the Caliphate was abolished the next year.

===One-party period: 1923–1950===
==== Atatürk era ====

Mustafa Kemal Atatürk&#x27;s People&#x27;s Party began as a &quot;de facto&quot; successor of the Young Turks and the CUP. In 1924, a right-wing opposition to Atatürk led by Kâzım Karabekir, reacting against the abolition of the Caliphate, formed the Progressive Republican Party. The life of the opposition party was short. The Progressive Republican Party faced allegations of involvement in the Sheikh Said rebellion and for conspiring with remaining members of the CUP to assassinate Atatürk in the İzmir Affair. Atatürk&#x27;s prime minister, İsmet İnönü, proposed the passage of the Law on Ensuring Peace which gave the government extraordinary powers. Martial law was declared, all political parties except the CHP were banned, all newspapers beyond state approved papers were banned (this ban would be lifted by 1930), and Karabekir&#x27;s supporters were purged from the government. Republican Turkey was the third one-party state of Interwar Europe, after the Soviet Union and Fascist Italy. For the next two decades Turkey was under a paternalist one-party authoritarian dictatorship, with one interruption; another brief experiment of opposition politics through the formation of the Liberal Republican Party.

From 1924 to 1946, the CHP introduced sweeping social, cultural, educational, economic, and legal reforms that transformed Turkey into a republican nation state. Such reforms included the adoption of Swiss and Italian legal and penal codes, the acceleration of industrialization, land reform and rural development programs, nationalization of foreign assets, forced assimilation policies, strict secularism, women&#x27;s suffrage, and switching written Turkish from Perso-Arabic script into Latin script, to name a few. In the party&#x27;s second ordinary congress in 1927, Atatürk delivered a thirty-six hour long speech of his account of the pivotal last eight years of Turkish history, which ended with an appeal to the Turkish youth to protect the Republic. Its narrative has served as the basis of a growing cult of personality associated with Atatürk and the historiography of the transition to the Republic from the Sultanate. In the period of 1930–1939, Atatürk&#x27;s CHP clarified its ideology from a vague left-wing-Unionism for &#x27;The Six Arrows&#x27;: republicanism, reformism, laïcité (secularism), populism, nationalism, and statism, as well as borrowing tenets from Communism and (Italian) Fascism. They defined Atatürk&#x27;s principles, which were soon known as Kemalism, and were codified into the constitution on 5 February 1937. 

With the Ottomanism question settled, Turkish nation-building was prioritized which saw nationalist propaganda, language purification, and pseudo-scientific racial theories propagated. Opposition to Atatürk&#x27;s reforms were suppressed by various coercive institutions and military force, at the expense of religious conservatives, minorities, and communists. The party-state cracked down on Kurdish resistance to assimilation, suppressing multiple rebellions and encouraging the denial of their existence. Anti-clerical and anti-veiling campaigns peaked in the mid-1930s. In the party&#x27;s third convention, it clarified its approach towards the religious minorities of the Christians and the Jews, accepting them as real Turks as long as they adhere to the national ideal and use the Turkish language. However under the state sanctioned secularist climate Alevis were able to make great strides in their emancipation, and to this day make up a core constituency of the CHP. With the onset of the Great Depression, the party divided into statist and liberal factions, being championed by Atatürk&#x27;s prime minister İnönü and his finance minister Celal Bayar respectively. Atatürk mostly favored İnönü&#x27;s policies, so economic development of the early republic was largely confined to state-owned enterprises and five-year plans. Further left-wing Republicans centered around the &quot;Kadro&quot; circle were deemed to be impermissible, so they were closed down.

==== İnönü era ====
On 12 November 1938, the day after Atatürk&#x27;s death, his ally İsmet İnönü was elected the second president and assumed leadership of the Republican People&#x27;s Party. İnönü&#x27;s presidency saw heavy state involvement in the economy and further rural development initiatives such as Village Institutes. On foreign affairs, the Hatay State was annexed and İnönü adopted a policy of neutrality despite attempts by the Allies and Axis powers to bring Turkey into World War II, during which extensive conscription and rationing was implemented to ensure an armed neutrality. Non-Muslims especially suffered when the CHP government implemented discriminatory &quot;wealth taxes,&quot; labor battalions, and peon camps. Over the course of the war, the CHP eventually rejected ultranationalism, with pan-Turkists being purged in the Racism-Turanism Trials.

In the aftermath of World War II, İnönü presided over the democratization of Turkey. With the crisis of war over, factionalism between the liberals and statists again broke out. The Motion with Four Signatures resulted in the resignation of some CHP members, most prominently Bayar, who then founded the Democrat Party (DP). İnönü called for a multi-party general election in 1946 – the first multi-party general election in the country&#x27;s history, in a contest between the DP and CHP. The result was a victory for the CHP, which won 395 of the 465 seats, amid criticism that the election did not live up to democratic standards. Under pressure by the new conservative parliamentary opposition and the United States, the party became especially anti-communist, and retracted some of its rural development programs and anti-clerical policies. The period between 1946 and 1950 saw İnönü prepare for a pluralistic Turkey allied with the West. A more free and fair general election was held in 1950 that led to the CHP losing power to the DP. İnönü presided over a peaceful transition of power. The 1950 election marked the end of the CHP&#x27;s last majority government. The party has not been able to regain a parliamentary majority in any subsequent election since.

=== Road to the center-left: 1950–1980 ===
Due to the winner-take-all system in place during the 1950s, the DP achieved landslide victories in elections that were reasonably close, meaning the CHP was in opposition for 10 years. In the meantime, the party began a long transformation into a social democratic force. Even before losing power İnönü created the ministry of labor and signed workers protections into law, and universities were given autonomy from the state. In its ninth congress in 1951, the youth branch and the women&#x27;s branch were founded. In 1953, the establishment of trade unions and vocational chambers was proposed, and support for a bicameral parliament, the establishment of a constitutional court, election security, judicial independence, and the right to strike for workers was added to the party program.

Though the DP and CHP were rivals, the DP was founded by Republicans and mostly continued Kemalist policies. But despite its name, the Democrat Party became increasingly authoritarian by the end of its rule. İnönü was harassed and almost lynched multiple times by DP supporters, and the DP government confiscated CHP property and harassed their members. The DP blocked the CHP from forming an electoral alliance with opposition parties for the 1957 snap election. By 1960, the DP accused the CHP of plotting a rebellion and threatened its closure. With the army concerned by the DP&#x27;s authoritarianism, Turkey&#x27;s first military coup was performed by junior officers. After one year of junta rule the DP was banned and Prime Minister Adnan Menderes and two of his ministers were tried and executed. Right-wing parties which trace their roots to the DP have since continuously attacked the CHP for their perceived involvement in the hanging of Menderes.

The CHP emerged as the first-placed party at the general election of 1961, and formed a grand coalition with the Justice Party, a successor-party to the Democrat Party. This was the first coalition government in Turkey, which endured for seven-months. İnönü was able to form two more governments with other parties until the 1965 election. His labor minister Bülent Ecevit was instrumental in giving Turkish workers the right to strike and collective bargaining. As leader of the Democratic Left faction in the CHP, Ecevit contributed to the party adopting the Left of Centre (&quot;Ortanın solu&quot;) programme for that election, which they lost against the Justice Party.

İnönü favored Ecevit&#x27;s controversial faction, resulting in Turhan Feyzioğlu leaving the CHP and founding the Reliance Party. When asked about his reasoning for his favoring Ecevit, İnönü replied: &quot;Actually we are already a left-to-center party after embracing Laïcité. If you are populist, you are [also] at the left of center.&quot; With Feyzioğlu&#x27;s departure, the CHP participated in the 1969 election with a Democratic Left program without qualms, though it achieved a similar result as its performance from last election due to the growing perception that the party primarily appealed to the educated urban elite. İnönü remained as opposition leader and the leader of the CHP until 8 May 1972, when he was overthrown by Ecevit in a party congress, due to his endorsement of the military intervention of 1971.
Ecevit adopted a distinct left wing role in politics and, although remaining staunchly nationalist, attempted to implement democratic socialism into the ideology of CHP. His arrival saw support for the party increase in the 1973 election. After establishing a coalition arrangement with an Islamist party, Ecevit made the decision to invade Cyprus in an atmosphere of deteriorating order on the island. The 1970s saw the party solidify its relations with trade unions and leftist groups in an atmosphere of intense polarization and political violence. The CHP achieved its best ever result in a free and fair multi-party election under Ecevit, when in 1977, the party received 41% of the vote, but not enough support for a stable government. Ecevit and his political rival Süleyman Demirel would constantly turnover the premiership as partisan deadlock took hold. This ended in a military coup in 1980, resulting in the banning of every political party and major politicians being jailed and banned from politics.

===Recovery period: 1980–2002===
Both the party name &quot;Republican People&#x27;s Party&quot; and the abbreviation &quot;CHP&quot; were banned until 1987. Until 1999, Turkey was ruled by the centre-right Motherland Party (ANAP) and the True Path Party (DYP), unofficial successors of the Democrat Party and the Justice Party, as well as, briefly, by the Islamist Welfare Party. CHP supporters also established successor parties. By 1985, Erdal İnönü, İsmet İnönü&#x27;s son, consolidated two successor parties to form the Social Democratic Populist Party (SHP), while the Democratic Left Party (, DSP) was formed by Rahşan Ecevit, Bülent Ecevit&#x27;s wife (Bülent Ecevit later took over the DSP in 1987).

After the ban on pre-1980 politicians was lifted in 1987, Deniz Baykal, a household name from the pre-1980 CHP, reestablished the Republican People&#x27;s Party in 1992, and the SHP merged with the party in 1995. However, Ecevit&#x27;s DSP remained separate, and to this day has not merged with the CHP. Observers noted that the two parties held similar ideologies and split the Kemalist vote in the nineties. The CHP held an uncompromisingly secularist and establishmentalist character and supported bans of headscarves in public spaces and the Kurdish language.

From 1991 to 1996, the SHP and then the CHP were in coalition governments with the DYP. Baykal supported Mesut Yılmaz&#x27;s coalition government after the collapse of the Welfare-DYP coalition following the 28 February &quot;post-modern coup.&quot; However, due to the Türkbank scandal, the CHP withdrew its support and helped depose the government with a no confidence vote. Ecevit&#x27;s DSP formed an interim-government, during which the PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan was captured in Kenya. As such, in the election of 1999, the DSP benefited massively in the polls at the expense of CHP, and the party failed to exceed the 10% threshold (8.7% vote), not winning any seats.

=== Main opposition under Baykal: 2002–2010 ===
In the 2002 general election, the CHP came back with 20% of the vote but 32% of the seats in parliament, as only it and the new AKP (Justice and Development Party) received above the 10% threshold to enter parliament. With DSP&#x27;s collapse, CHP became Turkey&#x27;s main Kemalist party. It also became the second largest party and the main opposition party, a position it has retained since. Since the dramatic 2002 election, the CHP has been racked by internal power struggles, and has been outclassed by the AKP governments of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Many of its members were critical of the leadership of CHP, especially Baykal, who they complained was stifling the party of young blood by turning away the young who turn either to apathy or even vote for the AKP.
In 2007, the culmination of tensions between Turkey&#x27;s secularist establishment and AKP politicians turned into a political crisis. Since Baykal proclaimed the party to be the bulwark of the secularist establishment, the CHP assisted undemocratic attempts by the army and judiciary to shut down the newly elected AKP. The crisis began with massive protests by secularists supported by the CHP in reaction to the AKP&#x27;s candidate for that year&#x27;s presidential election: Abdullah Gül, due to his background in Islamist politics and his wife&#x27;s wearing of the hijab. The CHP&#x27;s campaign focused on the alleged &quot;İrtica&quot; (Islamic reaction) that the AKP victory would bring into government, which served to alienate liberals and democrats from the party. The CHP chose to boycott the (indirect) election. Without quorum, Erdoğan called for a snap election to increase his mandate, in which the CHP formed an electoral alliance with the declining DSP, but gained only 21% of the vote. During the campaign season, a memorandum directed at the AKP was posted online by the Turkish Armed Forces. The CHP boycotted Gül&#x27;s second attempt to be voted president, though this time Gül had the necessary quorum with MHP&#x27;s participation and won. The swearing-in ceremony was boycotted by the CHP and the Chief of the General Staff Yaşar Büyükanıt.

The party also voted against a package of constitutional amendments to have the president elected by the people instead of parliament, which was eventually put to a referendum. The &quot;no&quot; campaign, supported by the CHP, failed, as a majority of Turks voted in favor of direct presidential elections. The final challenge against the AKP&#x27;s existence was a 2008 closure trial which ended without a ban. Following the decision, the AKP government, in a covert alliance with the Gülen movement, began a purge of the Turkish military, judiciary, and police forces of secularists in the Ergenekon and Sledgehammer trials, which the CHP condemned.

Between 2002 and 2010, Turkey held three general elections and two local elections, all of which the CHP received between 18 and 23% of the vote.

In the lead up to the US-lead coalition invasion of Iraq, AKP leadership failed to come to a consensus whether to participate. By a thin margin, parliament vetoed invading Iraq, due to half of the AKP&#x27;s parliamentary group voting with the CHP against war. CHP leadership briefly held a soft Euroscepticism as the AKP government came close to an assension plan with the European Union (see Ulusalism).

=== Main opposition under Kılıçdaroğlu: 2010–2023 ===
On 10 May 2010, Deniz Baykal announced his resignation as leader of the Republican People&#x27;s Party after a sex tape of him was leaked to the media. Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu was elected to be the new party leader. Kılıçdaroğlu returned the CHP to its traditional social-democratic image and cast away its secularist-establishmentalist character. This involved building bridges to voters it has traditionally not attracted: the devout, Kurds, and right-wing voters. However even with Kılıçdaroğlu at the helm, after five general elections, the CHP still did not win an election, receiving between only 22 and 26% of the vote in parliamentary elections. The CHP supported the unsuccessful &quot;no&quot; campaign in the 2010 constitutional referendum. In his first general election in 2011, the party increased its support by 25% but not enough to unseat the AKP. The 2013 Gezi Park protests found much support in the CHP.

The 2014 presidential election was the first in which the position would be directly elected and came just after a massive corruption scandal. The CHP and MHP&#x27;s joint candidate Ekmeleddin İhsanoğlu still lost to Erdoğan with only 38% of the vote. The two parties were critical of the government&#x27;s negotiations for peace with the PKK, which lasted from 2013–July 2015. In the June 2015 general election, the AKP lost its parliamentary majority due to the debut of the pro-Kurdish People&#x27;s Democratic Party (HDP), which was possible because of strategic voting by CHP voters so the party could pass the 10% threshold. Coalition talks went nowhere. MHP ruled out partaking in a government with HDP in a CHP lead government and the CHP refused to govern with the AKP after weeks of negotiations. In a snap election held that November, the AKP regained their parliamentary majority as well as MHP&#x27;s support.

Kılıçdaroğlu supported the government in the 2016 coup d&#x27;état attempt, the subsequent purges, and incursions into Syria. This support went so far as to help the government pass a law to lift parliamentary immunities, resulting in the jailing of MPs from the HDP, including Selahattin Demirtaş, as well as CHP lawmakers. The party lead the unsuccessful &quot;no&quot; campaign for the 2017 constitutional referendum.
By 2017, dissidents from MHP founded the Good Party. Kılıçdaroğlu was instrumental in the facilitating the rise of the new party by transferring MPs so they would have a parliamentary group to compete in the 2018 election. In the 2018 general election the CHP, Good Party, Felicity, and Democrat Party established the Nation Alliance to challenge the AKP and MHP&#x27;s People&#x27;s Alliance. Though CHP&#x27;s vote was reduced to 22%, strategic voting for the other parties yielded the alliance 33% of the vote. Their candidate for president: Muharrem İnce, lost in the first round, receiving only 30% of the vote. The Nation Alliance was re-established for the 2019 local elections, which saw great gains for the CHP, capturing nearly 30% of the electorate. A tacit collaboration with the HDP allowed for CHP to win the municipal mayoralties of İstanbul and Ankara.

Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu was nominated as the CHP and the Nation Alliance candidate for the 2023 presidential election. Ekrem İmamoğlu and Mansur Yavaş, mayors of İstanbul and Ankara respectively, along with other party leaders in Nation Alliance, ran to be his vice-presidents. Despite the government&#x27;s lackluster response to the economic crisis, COVID-19 pandemic, and the Kahramanmaraş earthquake, Kılıçdaroğlu lost his bid to Erdoğan after taking the race to a run-off and receiving 48% of the vote. The Nation Alliance again lost the parliamentary election to the ruling People&#x27;s Alliance. Smaller parties to the CHP&#x27;s right ran on its lists, which resulted in them receiving 35 seats in parliament for minimal electoral gains. At the 38th ordinary party congress held shortly after the election, Özgür Özel was elected leader of the CHP, defeating the incumbent Kılıçdaroğlu who had held the position since 2010.

=== Main opposition under Özel: 2023–present ===
The party won a major victory in the 2024 local elections. CHP mayors were reelected in Istanbul and Ankara, along with new victories in rural Aegean and Central Anatolian provinces. Since 1977, this was the first time the CHP won the popular vote winning 37.8% of the electorate, and was the AKP&#x27;s first nation-wide defeat.

== Factions ==

=== Reformists ===
Reformists (Turkish: &quot;Değişimciler&quot;) is a colloquial term for the social democratic and progressive opposition to Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu that emerged following the 2023 Turkish presidential election. The morning after the election, Ekrem İmamoğlu posted a video on his official Twitter account, calling for &quot;change&quot; in the CHP and Turkey. On 19 July 2023, a 14-minute part of the Zoom conference between İmamoğlu and other prominent CHP officials, discussing the future strategies of the party, was leaked on YouTube. The meeting was held without the knowledge of the then-CHP leader, Kılıçdaroğlu, and it sparked outrage of some factions in the party.

In the meanwhile, reformists announced a website called &quot;İktidar İçin Değişim&quot;, expressing the future plans for both the CHP and Turkey. The manifesto focused on change in the opposition and emphasized democratization, inclusivity, and mass participation in the decision-making process.

The 38th Republican People&#x27;s Party Ordinary Convention was originally set for summer 2022, but the Party Assembly postponed it to November 2023, in accordance with the national COVID-19 measures. The convention was held on 4–5 November 2023, which was won by Özgür Özel, by first a slight margin, but then a landslide victory in the runoff. Following the change in the office, CHP introduced many changes in its bylaw, including a term limit for MPs, a 50% women and 30% youth quota in internal bodies, wider representation for disabled people, and primaries.

Under the reformist leadership, CHP achieved an unexpected victory by defeating Erdoğan&#x27;s AK Party in the 2024 Turkish local elections, for the first time in two decades. In addition to mayors, the party also guaranteed majority in the municipal councils of many key cities, such as Istanbul and Ankara. It alleviated the ruling AK Party&#x27;s obstructions to municipalities already held by CHP. Days after the elections, with the refreshed delegates, Ekrem İmamoğlu was elected the President of the Turkish Municipalities Union by a landslide margin, handing over a central government body to CHP for the first time since 1977.

=== Nationalists ===
Nationalists (Turkish: &quot;Ulusalcılar&quot;) are a vague group within the CHP that encompasses of hardliner Kemalists and populists who draw attention to the safeguarding of the secular republic and the Turkish Revolution. Nationalists disagreed with the then-CHP leadership in regards of Kurds and the military, and consolidated grounds to run against Kılıçdaroğlu. They were eventually defeated at the 18th Republican People&#x27;s Party Extraordinary Convention, causing most prominent figures to leave the CHP. Muharrem İnce, who ran for president in 2018, founded the Homeland Party, a populist and self-identified Kemalist political party that was proposed as an alternative to the CHP.

Though the nationalists do no longer pose a united front, there are still some politicians that confront the CHP leadership. Tanju Özcan, the Mayor of Bolu, is an instance. He is known for excessive xenophobist policies against Syrian migrants, such as raising water bills and marriage fees merely for the residents of foreign origin. A criminal investigation was eventually carried out by the Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office, in which he admitted that his actions were against law. Özcan was dismissed from the CHP in 2022, but the new reformist leadership pardoned him.

=== Y-CHP ===

The New Republican People&#x27;s Party (Turkish: &quot;Yeni Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi&quot;), abbreviated Y-CHP, is a term that was first derived from the New Labour and is nowadays used in a pejorative sense to denote the fundamental reforms under Kılıçdaroğlu leadership to liberalize the CHP into becoming a centrist political party that addresses broader communities.

== Ideology and political positions ==
The Republican People&#x27;s Party is a centre-left political party that espouses social democracy and Kemalism. The CHP describes itself as a &quot;modern social-democratic party, which is faithful to the founding principles and values of the Republic of Turkey&quot;.

The distance between the party administration and many leftist grassroots, especially left-oriented Kurdish voters, contributed to the party&#x27;s shift away from the political left. 
Some leftists critical of Kemalism criticize the party&#x27;s continuous opposition to the removal of Article 301 of the Turkish penal code, which caused people to be prosecuted for &quot;insulting Turkishness&quot; including Elif Şafak and Nobel Prize winner author Orhan Pamuk, its conviction of Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink, its attitude towards minorities in Turkey, as well as its Cyprus policy.

Numerous politicians from the party have espoused support for LGBT rights, and the feminist movement in Turkey.

Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu and then Özgür Özel have repeatedly called for Selahattin Demirtaş and Osman Kavala to be released from jail.

=== Foreign policy ===

The party holds a significant position in the Socialist International, Progressive Alliance and is an associate member of the Party of European Socialists. In 2014, the CHP urged the Socialist International to accept the Republican Turkish Party of Northern Cyprus as a full member.

During its latest war with Hamas, Chairman Özgür Özel accused Israel of committing state sanctioned terrorism on the Palestinian people, declaring &quot;The Turkish left is never far from the Palestinian cause.&quot; Özel considers Hamas&#x27; October 7 attack against Israeli civilians &quot;an act of terrorism.&quot;

The CHP has supported Turkey&#x27;s interventions in the Middle East. While it still supports Turkish intervention in Libya, it has voted against intervention in Iraq since 2021; since 2023, it has also voted against intervention in Syria.

The party is pro-European and supports Turkish membership to the European Union. They also support Turkish membership to NATO and the expansion of the alliance. The party MPs voted overwhelmingly in favor of both Finland&#x27;s and Sweden&#x27;s accession into NATO.

== Electorate ==

The CHP draws its support from professional middle-class secular and liberally religious voters. It has traditional ties to the middle and upper-middle classes such as white-collar workers, retired generals, and government bureaucrats as well as academics, college students, left-leaning intellectuals and labour unions such as DİSK. The party also appeals to minority groups such as Alevis. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;to the dismay of its own leadership the CHP&#x27;s core constituency, as well as most of its MPs, are Alevis.&quot; The party&#x27;s former leader, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, was also an Alevi.

The CHP also draws much of their support from voters of big cities and coastal regions. The party&#x27;s strongholds are the west of the Aegean Region (İzmir, Aydın, Muğla), the northwest of the Marmara Region (Turkish Thrace; Edirne, Kırklareli, Tekirdağ, Çanakkale), the east of the Black Sea Region (Ardahan and Artvin), and the Anatolian college town of Eskişehir.

<text>USS &quot;Triton&quot; (SS-201) was the fourth &quot;Tambor&quot;-class submarine to be commissioned in the United States Navy in the years leading up to the country&#x27;s December 1941 entry into World War II. Her wartime service was in the Pacific Ocean. She completed five patrols in the following 14 months, and is credited with the sinking of over 20,000 tons of Japanese shipping and warships. She was lost with all hands on or around 15 March 1943. Of the twelve Tambor-class submarines, only five survived the war.

Her keel was down on 5 July 1939 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard. She was launched on 25 March 1940 sponsored by Mrs. Martha E. King, wife of Rear Admiral Ernest J. King, and commissioned on 15 August 1940 with Lieutenant Commander Willis A. &quot;Pilly&quot; Lent (Class of 1925) in command. She was the first submarine and third ship of the United States Navy to be named for Triton, a mythological Greek god, the messenger of the sea.

The new submarine held her shakedown training in the Caribbean Sea from 14 January to 26 March 1941 and then conducted training and minelaying exercises in the Portsmouth, New Hampshire - New London, Connecticut area. &quot;Triton&quot; departed Portsmouth on 1 July, transited the Panama Canal on 12 July, and arrived at San Diego, California, on 20 July. Nine days later, she and sister ship headed for Hawaii and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 4 August 1941.

==First patrol==
Assigned to Submarine Division 62, &quot;Triton&quot; made a training cruise to Midway from 30 August to 15 September, then participated in local and fleet operations in the Hawaiian area. On 19 November, the submarine headed west to conduct a practice war patrol and arrived off Wake Island on 26 November. On 8 December, she saw columns of smoke rising over the island but assumed it was caused by construction work being done ashore. That night, when she surfaced to charge her batteries, she was informed by radio Wake that Pearl Harbor had been bombed and was ordered to stay out of range of Wake&#x27;s guns. The next morning, &quot;Triton&quot; observed the Japanese bombing the island. On the night of 10 December, she was surfaced, charging her batteries, when flashes of light from Wake revealed a destroyer or light cruiser on a parallel course. The submarine was silhouetted against the moon, and the enemy ship turned towards her. &quot;Triton&quot; went deep and began evasive action. When the Japanese ship slowed astern, the submarine came to and fired four stern torpedoes—the first American torpedoes shot during World War II—on sonar bearings. She heard a dull explosion 58 seconds later and believed one had hit the target, then went to and cleared the area. (No sinking was recorded, and she was not credited with one.) After their initial repulse on 11 December, the Japanese returned with two aircraft carriers, &quot;Hiryū&quot; and &quot;Sōryū&quot;; &quot;Triton&quot; was not informed, and made no attacks on them. Neither did she make any effort to evacuate the 350 Marines. On 21 December, the submarine was ordered to return to Hawaii, and she arrived back at Pearl Harbor on 31 December.

==Second patrol==
On 25 January 1942, &quot;Triton&quot; got underway for the East China Sea and her second war patrol, covering the sealanes to Dairen, Shanghai, and Korea. She was off Kyūshū on 17 February when she contacted a freighter. The submarine launched four torpedoes and scored one hit in the stern. The target stopped for a few minutes and then slowly got underway. That evening, &quot;Triton&quot; attacked another freighter with two torpedoes at a range of . One hit the Japanese cargo ship aft of her well deck, and the maru went dead in the water and began settling. Soon, several heavy explosions marked the end of &quot;Shinyo Maru Number 5&quot;. Four days later, the submarine intercepted two cargo ships. She sank &quot;Shokyu Maru&quot; with two torpedoes but could not attack the second ship because of its speed and the appearance of a four-engine patrol plane. On the night of 27 February, the submarine was on the surface for a battery charge when she sighted a ship approximately three miles away. She closed to attack and launched two torpedoes. One torpedo hit, but haze over the water and smoke from the damaged ship prohibited a second attack. &quot;Triton&quot; made no further contacts and returned to Pearl Harbor on 17 March, where she was praised for an aggressive patrol, earning credit for two ships totalling 12,000 tons (reduced to 5,982 tons postwar), but criticized for excessive use of torpedoes, which were in extremely short supply.

==Third patrol==
&quot;Triton&quot; (now in the hands of C.C. Kirkpatrick, Class of 1931) got underway on 13 April to return to the East China Sea. Ten days later, the submarine contacted a 2,000-ton trawler near Marcus, astonishingly stopped and not blacked out. After missing with two torpedoes (at point blank range), she surfaced to engage with her deck guns, firing 19 rounds of three-inch (76 mm) and &quot;a hurricane of small-arms&quot;, leaving the trawler a sinking wreck, giving &quot;Triton&quot; the first confirmed sinking of an enemy vessel by deck gun fire by an American submarine.

Amid shallow, glassy seas and poor sonar conditions, on 1 May, she sighted six freighters, in two columns, escorted by a single torpedo boat. She launched two torpedoes, and both hit the leading ship, &quot;Taei Maru&quot; (2,200 tons), which sank, then two more at the next freighter; both missed. She fired at a third cargoman but the torpedo ran deep; a second torpedo, set shallow and aimed at a different ship, broke the back of &quot;Calcutta Maru&quot; (5,300 tons), which promptly sank.

&quot;Triton&quot; contacted an escorted convoy on 6 May and launched two torpedoes at the trailing ship; one sank soon after leaving the tube, the other missed ahead. She next spotted a destroyer coming to the rear of the convoy, fired two more (both set shallow) at this same ship from , and went deep to elude. Her sonar heard two violent explosions; &quot;Taigen Maru&quot; (5,600 tons) had sunk. At that point, the submarine maneuvered around and ahead of the convoy to position for another attack. When she attained the desired position, she launched four torpedoes—two at the third ship and two at a fourth. &quot;Triton&quot; heard two explosions from the first spread (one in the third ship), none from the second (which had avoided), as she was forced to take evasive action from the escort. The submarine later returned to periscope depth, but no ships were in sight. The convoy had cleared the area. On 15 May, she sank two deep-sea fishing boats with her deck guns.

The next day, after monitoring orders to other boats attempting to intercept without success, &quot;Triton&quot; ran into position and at 15.20 spotted the crippled &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and a destroyer, returning from the Battle of the Coral Sea. At , with the target making , &quot;Triton&quot; could not close the range, despite surfacing and bending on 19½ knots (36 km/h). She sent a contact report, but it was not acknowledged.

One day later, 17 May, in &quot;one of the luckiest finds of the war&quot;, &quot;I-64&quot; surfaced right in front of &quot;Triton&quot;; she fired her last bow torpedo from and parts of the target were blown into the air. &quot;I-64&quot; (1,700 tons), the fourth Japanese sub sunk by the Pacific Fleet Sub Force, went down by the stern. Four days later, &quot;Triton&quot; fired her last four torpedoes at another enemy submarine; all missed. The patrol earned her credit for five ships of 24,200 tons (reduced to 15,800 postwar), terminating at Pearl Harbor on 4 June, as the Battle of Midway began.

==Fourth patrol==

&quot;Triton&quot;&#x27;s fourth war patrol took her to Alaskan waters and lasted from 25 June to 24 August. On 4 July, she was patrolling in a heavy fog, in the vicinity of Cape Sabok, when the fog lifted enough to reveal a Japanese destroyer. The submarine trailed the enemy for ten hours, in and out of patches of fog, until she had closed the range to . &quot;Triton&quot; then launched two torpedoes, and one hit amidships. The Japanese destroyer &quot;Nenohi&quot; {right} (1,370 tons) capsized to port and slid under the waves in five minutes. &quot;Triton&quot; sighted a freighter on 28 July, but lost it in a fog bank. The same thing happened the next day. On 9 August, &quot;Triton&quot; saw an enemy submarine&#x27;s periscope and prepared to attack. However, the Japanese sub struck first, forcing &quot;Triton&quot; to go deep as enemy torpedoes passed overhead. On 15 August, &quot;Triton&quot; launched four torpedoes at a darkened ship from a range of . There were two consecutive explosions, and flames shot over into the air. To &quot;Triton&quot;, the enemy ship appeared to be larger than a destroyer. However, there is no official record of a sinking on that date. The submarine made no further contacts before returning to Pearl Harbor on 7 September, and was credited with two ships for 3,100 tons (postwar, only &quot;Nenohi&quot;, at 1,600 tons). She then entered Pearl Harbor Navy Yard for an overhaul until 6 December.

==Fifth patrol==
On 16 December, &quot;Triton&quot; got underway for a position east of Wake on the Midway–Wake route. She was one of three submarines stationed between the two islands to mark the way for United States Army Air Forces B-24 Liberator bombers in strikes on Wake and to rescue the crews of any planes forced down at sea. She made no rescues, but, on the night of 23 December, she aided in guiding the Liberators in a night bombing attack on the island. On 24 December, the submarine sighted the mast of a ship on the horizon, headed for Wake anchorage. &quot;Triton&quot; (alerted by ) closed to and launched two torpedoes. One hit under the stack, the other under the foremast. &quot;Amakasu Maru Number 1&quot; was obliterated in a cloud of smoke and steam as she went under. The submarine then set a course for Brisbane. On 28 December, she sighted an enemy ship, closed to , and launched three torpedoes into the transport . The ship sank almost immediately and, although there was much wreckage, no survivors were seen.

&quot;Triton&quot; was then ordered to patrol the Truk–Rabaul–New Guinea shipping lanes, north and northwest of New Ireland, arriving on 30 December 1942. On 10 January 1943, &quot;Triton&quot; stalked an unidentified vessel but withheld her attack upon observing it was marked as a hospital ship. Three days later, she launched four torpedoes at a tanker and scored one hit. When the enemy began firing at her periscope, she went deep to begin an end around. About 20 minutes later, the submarine returned to periscope depth and launched a spread of four torpedoes. Two geysers of water rose amidships as high as the target&#x27;s bridge, but no explosions followed. The next day, &quot;Triton&quot; attempted to attack a freighter, but an escort forced her down where she was subjected to a two-hour depth charge attack. On 16 January, she attacked two cargo ships, scoring two hits on the first and one on the second; but her victims forced her to submerge before she could evaluate the damage. Later that day, &quot;Triton&quot; fired her last three torpedoes at a large freighter but heard no explosions. She then headed for Australia and reached Brisbane on 26 January, with a total of 6,500 tons for the trip.

==Final patrol==

Falling under the strict tactical control of Admiral James Fife, Jr., &quot;Triton&quot; (now in the hands of George K. MacKenzie) on 16 February began her sixth and final war patrol, hoping to destroy enemy shipping between the Shortland Basin and Rabaul. She reported smoke on 22 February and a new Japanese radar at Buka. On 6 March, the submarine attacked a convoy of five destroyer-escorted ships, sinking the cargo ship &quot;Kiriha Maru&quot; and damaging another freighter. One of her torpedoes made a circular run, and &quot;Triton&quot; went deep to evade it. She attacked another convoy on the night of 8 March and claimed that five of the eight torpedoes she had fired scored hits. She could not observe the results or make a follow-up attack because gunfire from the escorts forced her down. On 11 March, &quot;Triton&quot; reported she was chasing two convoys, each made up of five or more ships. She was informed was operating in an adjoining area and ordered to stay south of the equator. On 13 March, &quot;Triton&quot; was warned that three enemy destroyers, including the &quot;Akikaze&quot; were in her area either looking for a convoy or hunting American submarines.

On 15 March, &quot;Triton&quot; reported she had attacked a convoy and had been depth charged. Even though attacks on her ceased, she could still hear distant depth charging for about an hour. No further messages from &quot;Triton&quot; were ever received. Post-war examination of Japanese records revealed on 15 March 1943, three Japanese destroyers attacked a submarine a little northwest of &quot;Triton&quot;&#x27;s assigned area and subsequently observed an oil slick, debris, and items with American markings. On 10 April 1943, &quot;Triton&quot; was reported overdue from patrol and presumed lost, one of three lost in a month. This gave her 6,500 tons for the trip to Brisbane.

==Awards==
&quot;Triton&quot; received five battle stars for World War II service.

==Legacy==
&quot;Triton&quot; is the subject of an episode of the syndicated television anthology series, &quot;The Silent Service&quot;, which aired in the United States during the 1957–1958 season.

&quot;Triton&quot;′s ship&#x27;s bell was not aboard the submarine when she was lost. It was located in 2011 and is on display at Naval Station Great Lakes in Lake County, Illinois.

<text>USCGC &quot;Triton&quot; (WPC-116), a steel-hulled, diesel-powered &quot;Thetis&quot;-class patrol boat of the United States Coast Guard, was the fourth commissioned ship of the United States to be named for Triton, a Greek demigod of the sea who was the son of Poseidon and Amphitrite. She served almost simultaneously with the submarine of the same name. Today, she serves as a tour boat in New York City for Circle Line Sightseeing Cruises, and carries the name Circle Line XVII.

==History==
===Coast Guard service===
The contract for her construction was let on 17 November 1933 to the Marietta Manufacturing Company, Point Pleasant, West Virginia. She was commissioned as Coast Guard Patrol Boat No. 16 on 20 November 1934.

Assigned to the homeport of Gulfport, Mississippi, &quot;Triton&quot; operated in the Gulf of Mexico from at least 1 January 1935. On 1 July 1941, four months in advance of the directive whereby the United States Coast Guard was transferred from the United States Department of the Treasury to the United States Navy, &quot;Triton&quot; and five of her sister ships were turned over to the Navy. This action occurred simultaneously with the establishment of the four Sea Frontiers.

Four &quot;Thetis&quot;-class patrol boats, including &quot;Triton&quot;, were assigned to the East Coast Sound School, Key West, Florida, for duty as patrol and training vessels. Their collateral duties included operating under the aegis of Commander, Task Force 6, on Gulf patrol duties.

====World War II====
At the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, 7 December 1941, &quot;Triton&quot; was operating out of Key West. In or around February 1942, &quot;Triton&quot; was classified as a patrol craft and given the hull classification symbol WPC-116.

Although American warships had been actively engaged in patrol and escort missions in the Battle of the Atlantic even before Pearl Harbor, their techniques for combating the dangerous German U-boats were, in January and February 1942, still far from adequate. U-boats operating off the eastern seaboard experienced what they called &quot;the happy time,&quot; before American convoys could be organized. In some cases, Allied ships would be sunk because they were silhouetted by lights in non-blacked out cities along the shoreline.

&quot;Triton&quot;″s antisubmarine warfare (ASW) training missions were conducted along with local patrol and escort duties out of Key West from 1941 into 1945. She had her first brush with what she presumed to be an enemy submarine on 21 February 1942. On that day, she made one attack but without success. Over the next few days, upon occasion joined by and , &quot;Triton&quot; conducted more attacks but did not make any strikes.

On 9 June 1942, when reported an enemy submarine on the surface in her vicinity, &quot;Triton&quot; directed &quot;Thetis&quot; to make the search. &quot;Triton&quot;, meanwhile, contacted the submarine &quot;R-10&quot; which had been conducting exercises with the patrol vessels in that same area. When took over the job of escorting &quot;R-10&quot; back to Key West, Florida, &quot;Triton&quot; joined &quot;Thetis&quot; in search of the submarine. Eventually, &quot;PC-518&quot; and &quot;Noa&quot; joined the hunt. &quot;Triton&quot; attacked with depth charges but, after a further search, concluded that the target was probably a tidal rip in the Gulf Stream, not a submarine.

&quot;Triton&quot;″s next recorded ASW operation came soon thereafter, during the concentrated search and destroy mission mounted to find the U-boat which torpedoed the American steamer on the night of 10 June. The hunt, which involved radar-equipped United States Army Air Forces B-18 Bolo bombers, three destroyers, several PCs, and &quot;Triton&quot; and &quot;Thetis&quot;, took three days. On 12 June, in an area well known for false contacts, &quot;Triton&quot; attacked what she thought to be a submarine but later evaluated to be otherwise. Later that day, although not picking up propeller noises, the contact seemed strong to &quot;Triton&quot;″s sonar operator, and the ship attacked. Again, the result was the same—negative.

The next day, however, was different. &quot;Thetis&quot; picked up trying to escape the &quot;dragnet&quot; and destroyed her in a single depth charge attack. That patrol craft recovered two pairs of leather submariner&#x27;s pants and a tube of lubricant marked &quot;made in Düsseldorf.&quot; There were no survivors. &quot;Triton&quot; took part in further attacks, along with the other ships of the hunter-killer group based on Key West; but, by that point, the enemy submersible had already been killed.

&quot;Triton&quot; remained with the Sound School, apparently, into 1945. On 10 February, while was engaged in &quot;Robot Bomb Patrol,&quot; she picked up what she evaluated as a submarine contact. She and &quot;Triton&quot;, also in the vicinity, then conducted attacks but found no evidence that a kill had been made.

====Post World War II====
&quot;Triton&quot; apparently remained in the Gulf of Mexico region for the remainder of her active service in the Coast Guard. Reverting to Treasury Department control after the end of World War II, &quot;Triton&quot; was reclassified from WPC-116 to WMEC-116 (Medium Endurance Cutter) sometime in 1966. Her post-war duty station was at Corpus Christi, Texas, until 1967.

===Tour ship===
She was sold as government surplus and converted into a twin-deck passenger excursion vessel for Circle Line Sightseeing in New York City. Her two Winton 158-6 direct-drive diesels were replaced with two quad sets of four GM 6-71 diesels per shaft. Her electrical system was converted to AC with two 60 kW generators each powered by a GM 6-71. She has been a passenger excursion vessel named &quot;Circle Line XVII&quot; since 1973 and is still running as of March 2016.

<text>USS &quot;Triton&quot; (SSRN/SSN-586), the only member of her class, was a nuclear powered radar picket submarine in the United States Navy. She had the distinction of being the only Western submarine powered by two nuclear reactors. &quot;Triton&quot; was the second submarine and the fourth vessel of the United States Navy to be named for the Greek god Triton (the nomenclature being unusual at the time in that U.S. Navy submarines were usually named for various species of fish). At the time of her commissioning in 1959, &quot;Triton&quot; was the largest, most powerful, and most expensive submarine ever built at $109 million (equivalent to $ billion in ) excluding the cost of nuclear fuel and reactors.

In early 1960, the boat became the first vessel to execute a submerged circumnavigation of the Earth in Operation Sandblast. &quot;Triton&quot; accomplished this objective during her shakedown cruise while under the command of Captain Edward L. &quot;Ned&quot; Beach Jr. &quot;Triton&quot;″s mission as a radar picket submarine was made obsolete after two years by the introduction of the carrier-based Grumman WF-2 Tracer airborne early warning aircraft. She was converted to an attack submarine in 1962 and became the flagship for the Commander, Submarine Forces, U.S. Atlantic Fleet () in 1964. She was decommissioned in 1969, the first U.S. nuclear submarine to be taken out of service.

&quot;Triton&quot;&#x27;s hull was moored at the St. Julien&#x27;s Creek Annex of Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia as part of the reserve fleet until 1993, though she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register in 1986. In 1993, she was towed to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to await the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program. &quot;Triton&quot; landed on the keel resting blocks in the drydock basin on 2007 to begin this recycling process, which was completed effective 30 November 2009. &quot;Triton&quot;″s sail superstructure was saved from the recycling process and is now part of the USS &quot;Triton&quot; Submarine Memorial Park located on Port of Benton Boulevard in Richland, Washington.

==Design history==

===General characteristics===
&quot;Triton&quot; was a first-generation U.S. nuclear-powered submarine, along with , , , and (and her three sisters). While serving as fully operational units of the U.S. Navy, the vessels also played key developmental roles. &quot;Nautilus&quot; introduced the use of nuclear power for ship propulsion. &quot;Seawolf&quot; utilized a liquid-metal nuclear reactor using liquid sodium as an alternative heat exchange medium to pressurized water. &quot;Halibut&quot; was the first nuclear-powered submarine to perform a strategic nuclear deterrence patrol armed with Regulus cruise missiles. The &quot;Skate&quot;-class submarines were the first nuclear-powered submarine class with more than one boat built. &quot;Triton&quot;″s unique contribution to the development of nuclear power for naval propulsion was her dual reactor plant, which provided the speed required for radar picket missions.

Radar picket submarines (Navy classification &quot;SSR&quot;) were developed during the post-war period to provide intelligence information, electronic surveillance, and fighter aircraft interception control for forward-deployed naval forces. Unlike destroyers used as radar picket ships during World War Two, these submarines could avoid attack by submerging if detected. The U.S. Navy&#x27;s MIGRAINE program involved converting existing fleet submarines into radar picket vessels, and the Navy also ordered two purpose-built diesel-electric SSRs, and . However, these were incapable of sustaining the high submerged or surfaced speeds necessary to operate with fast carrier task forces and therefore unsuitable to the task.

Nuclear power offered the only possible solution. &quot;Triton&quot; was designed in the mid-1950s as a radar picket submarine capable of operating at high speed, on the surface, in advance of an aircraft carrier task force. &quot;Triton&quot;″s high speed came from her twin-reactor nuclear propulsion plant, with a designed speed, surfaced and submerged, of . On 27 September 1959, &quot;Triton&quot; achieved &quot;well in excess of&quot; during her initial sea trials.

To meet her radar picket role, &quot;Triton&quot;″s main air search radar initially used the AN/SPS-26, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s first electronically scanned, three-dimensional search radar which was laboratory tested in 1953. The first set was installed on board the destroyer leader prior to its installation on board &quot;Triton&quot; in 1959. Since it was scanned electronically in elevation, the AN/SPS-26 set did not need a separate height-finding radar. A submarine version of SPS-26, designated BPS-10, was under development, and it was slated for installation on &quot;Triton&quot;. To process her radar, electronic, and air traffic data, &quot;Triton&quot; had a Combat Information Center (CIC) located in a separate air control compartment, situated between &quot;Triton&quot;″s reactor and operations compartments.
Design work on a nuclear-powered radar picket submarine (SSRN) began in 1954–1955. As initially designed, &quot;Triton&quot; had a three-level hull, with the Combat Information Center (CIC) (&quot;see image&quot;) located on the middle level. The overall length was initially , with a beam of . Also, as initially designed, her displacement was 4,800 tons surfaced and 6,500 tons submerged. January 1955 performance estimates called for the SAR propulsion plant to produce , with a surfaced speed of and a submerged speed of . &quot;Triton&quot; initially had the same dual radar system installed on the non-nuclear radar picket submarines (&quot;i.e.&quot;, BPS-2 search radar and BPS-3 height-finder set) housed in a large, stepped sail (&quot;see image&quot;). Construction cost was initially estimated at $78 million. Subsequent growth of the SAR propulsion plant necessitated the overall increase in &quot;Triton&quot;″s length and tonnage, although without any loss in speed, while the installation of the AN/SPS-26 3-D search radar allowed the elimination of a separate height-finder.

&quot;Triton&quot; was to be the lead boat of a proposed class of nuclear-powered radar picket submarines. A December 1955 long-range naval planning report envisioned five carrier strike groups, each supported by two radar picket submarines. The total force included two non-nuclear &quot;Sailfish&quot;-class submarines and eight nuclear submarines. With construction costs for &quot;Triton&quot; escalating, this long-range requirement was revised in 1957 to provide four nuclear-powered radar picket submarines for a single nuclear-powered carrier group, with the four remaining conventionally powered carrier groups supported by two diesel-electric radar picket submarines each.
At the time of her construction, &quot;Triton&quot; was the largest submarine ever built. Her knife-like bow, with its bulbous forefoot, provided improved surfaced sea-keeping for her radar picket role. Her surface sea-keeping was further enhanced by high reserve buoyancy (30%), provided by 22 ballast tanks, the most ever in an American submarine. She was the last submarine to have a conning tower, as well as the last American submarine to have twin screws or a stern torpedo room. Her sail was the largest ever aboard an American submarine, measuring long, tall, and wide, and designed to house the large AN/SPS-26 3-D air-search radar antenna when not in use. She also had a compartment solely for crew berthing, with 96 bunks, and two separate chief petty officers&#x27; (CPOs&#x27;) quarters. With an overall length of , &quot;Triton&quot; was the longest submarine in the history of the United States Navy until the nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine was commissioned in 1981.

===Propulsion===
&quot;Triton&quot; was the only submarine outside of the Soviet Union designed with a two-reactor propulsion plant. Her S4G reactors were seagoing versions of the land-based S3G reactor prototype. Both reactors composed the Submarine Advanced Reactor (SAR) program, a joint venture between the U.S. Navy, Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), and General Electric. As originally designed, &quot;Triton&quot;″s total reactor output was rated at . However, &quot;Triton&quot; achieved during her sea trials (&quot;pictured&quot;), and her first commanding officer, Captain Edward L. Beach Jr., believed &quot;Triton&quot;″s plant could have reached &quot;had that been necessary&quot;.

Both of &quot;Triton&quot;″s reactors share the same compartment, with the number one reactor located forward and the number two reactor located aft within that compartment. The number one reactor supplied steam to the forward engine room and the starboard propeller shaft. The number two reactor supplied steam to the after engine room and the port propeller shaft. Each reactor could individually supply steam for the entire ship, or the reactors could be cross-connected as required. It is this enhanced reliability, redundancy, and dependability of a dual-reactor plant that was a key factor in the selection of &quot;Triton&quot; to undertake the first submerged circumnavigation of the world.

&quot;Triton&quot;″s dual-reactor plant met a number of operational and engineering objectives, specifically the high speed requirement to meet her radar picket mission, which continues to be a source of speculation and controversy to this day. During the early 1950s, many engineers at Naval Reactors branch of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) were concerned about depending on single-reactor plants for submarine operations, particularly involving under-the-ice Arctic missions. The presence of two de-aerating feed tanks, which are used only on surface warships, suggested that &quot;Triton&quot;″s twin-reactor plant may have served as a testbed for future multi-reactor surface warships. The SAR program was the first production naval reactor developed by General Electric for the U.S. Navy, and GE used this SAR experience for the High Power Reactor (HPR) program that led to the development of the D1G and D2G naval reactors used on &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, and &#x27; classes of nuclear-powered surface ships.

Finally, the U.S. Navy was debating the best approach to optimize performance, particularly underwater speed, for its nuclear submarine fleet. &quot;Triton&quot; achieved high speeds through brute horsepower, rather than the more hydrodynamically efficient teardrop-shaped hull form pioneered by which, when combined with nuclear power, allowed to achieve higher speed with less horsepower.

===Combat systems===

====Weapon systems====
&quot;Triton&quot;″s armament consisted of six Mark 60 torpedo tubes, four bow and two stern. The Mark 60 system was a -long hydraulic-launch tube that did not have power handling capability. The standard torpedo carried by &quot;Triton&quot; was the Mark 37, with a weapon load of ten forward and five aft. &quot;Triton&quot;″s first commanding officer, &quot;Ned&quot; Beach, noted the torpedo load in the forward torpedo room could have been doubled with the removal of a single support girder.

====Fire control and electronics====
&quot;Triton&quot;″s main air search radar was the electronically scanned, three-dimensional AN/SPS-26. This system had a range of and was capable of tracking aircraft up to an altitude of . Since it scanned electronically in elevation, it did not need a separate height-finding set. When not in use, the SPS-26 radar was lowered into its fairwater housing for stowage within &quot;Triton&quot;″s massive sail (&quot;pictured&quot;). A submarine version of SPS-26, designated BPS-10, was under development at the time of &quot;Triton&quot;″s construction, slated for eventual installation on &quot;Triton&quot;.

&quot;Triton&quot;″s long-range, passive detecting-ranging sonar was the AN/BQR-7, which had a listening range up to for surfaced or snorkeling submarines, optimized to , with target tracking capability within 5 degrees of accuracy. The chin-mounted AN/BQR-2 passive sonar array supplemented the active BQS-4, with a range up to and a bearing accuracy of 1/10 of degree, allowing the BQR-2 to be used for fire control in torpedo attacks.

&quot;Triton&quot;″s target fire-control system (TFCS) was the Mark 101, a post-war development that incorporated target tracking and ranging data into a position keeper, with a pair of analyzers that automatically revised torpedo gyros and settings as the target position changed. This automation greatly simplified a targeting solution for a plotting party. Previously targeting solutions were manually estimated target bearings which were then fed into the Torpedo Data Computer (TDC), a method used throughout the Pacific War. However, while entirely capable of providing efficient fire control solutions against post-war non-nuclear hunter-killer submarines, the Mark 101 proved to be less responsive to the rapid changes associated with nuclear submarine operations.

The Number One periscope was &quot;Triton&quot;″s navigational periscope, and it had a built-in sextant developed by the Kollmorgen Optical Company that allowed navigators to observe celestial bodies in order to obtain an accurate star fix to plot the ship&#x27;s course and position.

==Construction history==
===Authorization===
The U.S. Navy ordered a &quot;large radar picket using the advanced two-reactor system&quot;, designated SCB 132, in October 1955 under the United States Department of Defense appropriation for Fiscal Year 1956. This 1956 shipbuilding program was significant because it included authorization for the construction of eight submarines in total, the largest such order since World War II. Along with &quot;Triton&quot;, the FY-56 program included four additional nuclear-powered submarines – guided missile submarine &quot;Halibut&quot;, the lead ship for the , and the final two s, and . The 1956 program not only completed the final authorization for all of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s first-generation nuclear submarines, but with &quot;Skipjack&quot;, it also marked the initial authorization for a second-generation nuclear submarine. Finally, the 1956 program included the three submarines of the Diesel-electric , the last non-nuclear attack submarines to be built for the U.S. Navy. Henceforth, the U.S. Navy submarine service would be a nuclear-powered force.

===Keel-laying===
&quot;Triton&quot;″s keel was laid down on 29 May 1956 in Groton, Connecticut, by the Electric Boat Division of the General Dynamics Corporation. Her length presented Electric Boat with many problems during her construction. She was so long her bow obstructed the slipway&#x27;s railway facility, used for transporting material around the yard. Consequently, the lower half of her bow was cut away to facilitate yard operations and was re-attached just days prior to her launch. Similarly, the last of her stern was built on an adjoining slip and attached to the rest of the hull before &quot;Triton&quot;″s launch. Her sail was found to be too high to go under the scaffolding, so the top was cut away and re-attached later.

Even before her launch, there was considerable discussion of &quot;Triton&quot;″s role beyond her radar picket mission. An internal Navy memorandum set forth four options for the submarine&#x27;s extended use. These included configuration to serve as a command ship (SSCN) for a fleet or force commander, an advanced sonar scout for the fleet, a Regulus missile submarine (SSGN), or a minelaying submarine. However, with the exception of the command ship option, all of these proposed configurations required extensive modification of her original design.

Another potential mission was as an underwater tug, able to rescue disabled submarines under the Arctic ice pack. &quot;Triton&quot;″s first commanding officer, Captain Edward L. Beach Jr., requested plans be drawn up for this modification, which he characterized as &quot;easy and inexpensive&quot;. Although there was consideration for a deployment to Arctic waters, there is no evidence that &quot;Triton&quot; was ever employed as an underwater tug.

===Launching===

&quot;Triton&quot; was launched on 19 August 1958, with Louise Willis, the wife of Vice Admiral John Wills USN (ret.), as her sponsor. The principal address was delivered by Admiral Jerauld Wright, the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Atlantic Command (), the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet () and Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic () for NATO. Over 35,000 guests attended, the largest crowd to witness a submarine launching up to that time.

===Fitting out===
On 1 February 1959, &quot;Triton&quot; was provisionally accepted for service in the U.S. Navy, with Captain Beach, the Prospective Commanding Officer (PCO), now designated as Officer-in-Charge. &quot;Triton&quot; met several key milestones before her commissioning. On 8 February 1959, reactor No. 2 achieved initial criticality, while reactor No. 1 achieved this milestone on 3 April 1959.

Two shipboard accidents occurred during &quot;Triton&quot;″s post-launch fitting-out. On 2 October 1958, prior to the nuclear reactor fuel being installed, a steam valve failed during testing, causing a large cloud of steam that filled the number two reactor compartment, and on 7 April 1959, a fire broke out during the testing of a deep-fat fryer and spread from the galley into the ventilation lines of the crew&#x27;s mess. Neither incident was nuclear related and both were quickly handled by the boat&#x27;s personnel, with Lieutenant Commander Leslie D. Kelly, the prospective chief engineering officer, being awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his quick action during the incident on 2 October.

===Sea trials===
&quot;Triton&quot; began her sea trials on 27 September 1959. Over the next five days, the boat&#x27;s systems and equipment were thoroughly tested under the overall direction of Admiral Hyman G. Rickover of the Bureau of Ships&#x27; Naval Reactors branch and Captain A. C. Smith, the Supervisor of Shipbuilding at Electric Boat. &quot;Triton&quot; generated on sea trials, reaching her design surface speed of , and achieved a surface speed well in excess of . &quot;Triton&quot; subsequently executed a four-hour, full-power submerged run and a crash-back maneuver. The only significant problem encountered during her initial sea trials was the overheating of the lubricating oil system for the starboard propeller shaft spring bearing. At the recommendation of Admiral Rickover, a hose was rigged to spray the bearing housing with a steady stream of sea water to keep the shaft cool, as well as a special watch set to monitor the temperature of the lube oil.

&quot;Triton&quot; began her preliminary acceptance trials (PAT) on 20 September 1959. These trials were conducted under the supervision of Rear Admiral Francis Douglas McCorkle of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Board of Inspection and Survey (INSURV). After three days of at-sea tests, &quot;Triton&quot; was passed by the INSURV as being ready to enter service as a U.S. naval vessel.

==Operational history==

===Commissioning===
&quot;Triton&quot; was commissioned on 10 November 1959 with Captain Edward L. Beach Jr. in command. Vice Admiral Bernard L. Austin, the Deputy CNO for Plans and Policy, made the keynote address, noting:

As the largest submarine ever built, her performance will be carefully followed by naval designers and planners the world over. For many years strategists have speculated on the possibilities of tankers, cargo ships and transports that could navigate under water. Some of our more futuristic dreamers have talked of whole fleets that submerge. &quot;Triton&quot; is a bold venture into this field.

The widow of the late Rear Admiral Willis A. &quot;Pilly&quot; Lent presented the original ship&#x27;s bell from the first &quot;Triton&quot; at the new commissioning ceremony. The late Admiral Lent had been the earlier &quot;Triton&quot;″s first commanding officer. A watercolor painting of the submarine also was presented by the American Water Color Society. The final cost of building &quot;Triton&quot;, less her reactors, nuclear fuel, and other related costs paid by the AEC, was US$109,000,000, making &quot;Triton&quot; the most expensive submarine ever built at the time of her commissioning.

&quot;Triton&quot; was assigned to Submarine Squadron 10, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s first all-nuclear force, based at State Pier in New London, Connecticut, under the command of Commodore Tom Henry. &quot;Triton&quot; subsequently completed torpedo trials at Naval Station Newport and conducted other special tests at the Norfolk Navy Base before returning to Electric Boat on 7 December 1959 in order to install special communications equipment, including a prototype of the BRA-3 towed communications buoy system housed in a large fairing located on the after end of the main deck. Work on &quot;Triton&quot; at Electric Boat was delayed as priority was given to completing the Navy&#x27;s first two fleet ballistic missile (FBM) submarines, and , with the objective for both vessels to start their first nuclear deterrence patrols before the end of 1960.

On 20 January 1960, &quot;Triton&quot; got underway to conduct an accelerated series of at-sea testing. &quot;Triton&quot; returned on 1 February as preparations continued for her forthcoming shakedown cruise, scheduled for departure on 16 February 1960, which involved operating with the command ship , flagship of the U.S. Second Fleet, in northern European waters. On 1 February, Captain Beach received a message from Rear Admiral Lawrence R. &quot;Dan&quot; Daspit () instructing Beach to attend a top secret meeting at The Pentagon on 4 February 1960 that led to the execution of Operation Sandblast, the first submerged circumnavigation of the world.

===Shakedown cruise===


During her shakedown cruise, &quot;Triton&quot; successfully executed the first submerged circumnavigation of the world, code named Operation Sandblast, following the same track as the first circumnavigation led by Ferdinand Magellan. The mission&#x27;s objectives were set forth in the published ship&#x27;s log (&quot;pictured&quot;):

For purposes of geophysical and oceanographic research and to determine habitability, endurance and psychological stress – all extremely important to the Polaris program – it had been decided that a rapid round-the-world trip, touching the areas of interest, should be conducted. Maximum stability of the observing platform and unbroken continuity around the world were important. Additionally, for reasons of the national interest it had been decided that the voyage should be made entirely submerged undetected by our own or other forces and completed as soon as possible. TRITON, because of her size, speed and extra dependability of her two-reactor plant, had been chosen for the mission.

The actual mission was summarized by the U.S. Navy&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships&quot;:

&quot;Triton&quot; put to sea on her shakedown cruise on 15 February 1960, bound for the South Atlantic. She arrived in the middle Atlantic off St. Peter and St. Paul Rocks on 24 February to commence a history-making voyage. Having remained submerged since her departure from the east coast, Triton continued on south towards Cape Horn, rounded the tip of South America, and headed west across the Pacific. After transiting the Philippine and Indonesian archipelagos and crossing the Indian Ocean, she rounded the Cape of Good Hope and arrived off the St. Peter and Paul Rocks on 25 April – 60 days and 21 hours after departing the mid-ocean landmark. Only once did her sail break the surface of the sea, when she transferred a sick sailor to USS &quot;Macon&quot; (CA-132) off Montevideo, Uruguay, on 6 March. She arrived back at Groton, Connecticut, on 10 May, having completed the first submerged circumnavigation of the earth.

&quot;Triton&quot;″s globe-girdling cruise proved invaluable to the United States. Politically, it enhanced the nation&#x27;s prestige. From an operational viewpoint, the cruise demonstrated the great submerged endurance and sustained high-speed transit capabilities of the first generation of nuclear-powered submarines. Moreover, during the voyage, the submarine collected reams of oceanographic data. At the cruise&#x27;s conclusion, &quot;Triton&quot; received the Presidential Unit Citation and Captain Beach received the Legion of Merit from President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

&quot;Triton&quot;″s commanding officer during Operation Sandblast, Captain Edward L. Beach, also provided a unique perspective on the circumnavigation in the published log:

The noted historian Bern Dibner placed the significance of Operation Sandblast into historical context:

Also, in his 2000 book &quot;Ships of Discovery And Exploration&quot;, historian Lincoln P. Paine further noted:

The actual submerged circumnavigation occurred between 24 February and 25 April 1960, covering in 60 days and 21 hours at the average speed of while crossing the Equator on four different occasions. Also, the total duration of &quot;Triton&quot;″s shakedown cruise was 84 days 19 hours 8 minutes, covering , and &quot;Triton&quot; remained submerged for a total of 83 days 9 hours, covering during her maiden voyage.

The &quot;New York Times&quot; described &quot;Triton&quot;″s submerged circumnavigation of the world as &quot;a triumph of human prowess and engineering skill, a feat which the United States Navy can rank as one of its bright victories in man&#x27;s ultimate conquest of the seas&quot;.

===Initial deployments===

Following her post-shakedown availability (PSA), &quot;Triton&quot; assumed her duties as a radar picket submarine in August 1960. She deployed to northern European waters with the Second Fleet to participate in NATO exercises oriented around detecting and intercepting Soviet bombers overflying the Arctic. &quot;Triton&quot; also participated in NATO exercises against British naval forces led by the aircraft carriers and under the command of Rear Admiral Sir Charles Madden, RN. For 2 days during these NATO exercises, Rear Admiral Thomas H. Moorer and his flag lieutenant, Lt. William P. Lawrence, were aboard &quot;Triton&quot; to observe the submarine&#x27;s radar-picket operations. At the time, Moorer was serving as Commander Carrier Division Six which included the carriers and . &quot;Triton&quot; completed her first overseas deployment with a port visit to Bremerhaven, West Germany, the first by a nuclear-powered vessel to a European port, from 2–9 October 1960, with an estimated 8,000 touring the boat during this port-call.

For the first half of 1961, &quot;Triton&quot; conducted operational patrols and training exercises with the Atlantic Fleet. This included an at-sea exercise involving low-power testing in support of the development of a proposed natural circulation reactor (NCR). She also deployed to monitor the Soviet 50-megaton hydrogen bomb initiation at Novaya Zemlya in the Arctic Ocean during late October 1961.

During this period, the rising threat posed by Soviet submarine forces increased the Navy&#x27;s demands for nuclear-powered attack submarines with antisubmarine warfare (ASW) capability. Following the development of the carrier-based Grumman WF-2 Tracer airborne early warning aircraft, &quot;Triton&quot;″s AN/SPS-26 3-D long-range air search radar was no longer needed, and the development of the submarine version of this 3-D radar system, the BPS-10, was canceled in 1960. Accordingly, upon the demise of the Navy&#x27;s radar picket submarine program, &quot;Triton&quot; was redesignated SSN-586 on 1 March 1961.

===Overhaul and conversion===

&quot;Triton&quot; entered the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in June 1962 for conversion to an attack submarine. Her crew complement was reduced from 172 to 159. She was overhauled and refueled at Groton, Connecticut, from September 1962 to January 1964, which included modification to serve as the flagship for . Since the Navy no longer had any plans to use &quot;Triton&quot;″s radar picket capability, her SPS-26 radar set was replaced by a two-dimensional AN/BPS-2 air search radar, with &quot;Triton&quot; now providing the fleet with an at-sea air strike control capability.

Because she subsequently served as &#x27;s flagship following her overhaul, one area of continuing speculation is whether &quot;Triton&quot; was part of the National Emergency Command Post Afloat (NECPA) program. NECPA was tasked to provide afloat facilities for the President of the United States in case of an emergency or war, with the command cruisers and assigned to perform this mission.

&quot;Triton&quot; had a number of attributes that made her a potential NECPA platform. Her size allowed ample room for additional shipboard systems and personnel accommodations. Her designed speed provided the capability for rapid transit, and her nuclear power plant offered virtually unlimited endurance and range. The Combat Information Center (CIC) provided substantial command and control capabilities as did the communication buoy system that could receive and send radio transmissions while submerged. As she was a submarine, &quot;Triton&quot; offered superior protection against nuclear-biological-chemical (NBC) contaminants over surface ships or an airborne command centre. However, the record remains unclear if such an explicit NECPA conversion was ever undertaken for &quot;Triton&quot;.

===Subsequent operations===
In March 1964, upon completion of her overhaul, &quot;Triton&quot;″s home port was changed from New London, to Norfolk. On 13 April 1964, she became the flagship for . On 20 January 1965, &quot;Triton&quot; rescued the pilot and a passenger of a charter aircraft that had ditched in the Atlantic Ocean off St. Croix in the Virgin Islands. &quot;Triton&quot; was relieved as &#x27;s flagship by the on 1 June 1967. 11 days later, &quot;Triton&quot; was shifted to her original home port of New London, Connecticut.

==Decommissioning and final disposition==

Due to cutbacks in defense spending, as well as the expense of operating her twin nuclear reactors, &quot;Triton&quot;″s scheduled 1967 overhaul was canceled, and the submarinealong with 60 other vesselswas slated for inactivation. While &quot;Triton&quot;″s twin reactor plant was designed to be refueled by a submarine tender like other U.S. nuclear submarines, because of the complexity of her zirconium-clad fuel elements, &quot;Triton&quot;″s previous re-fueling had been done in a shipyard during her 1962–1964 overhaul. Although new fuel elements were procured and available for installation, &quot;Triton&quot;″s overhaul was canceled, a source of controversy. One speculation suggests that the cancellation of &quot;Triton&quot;″s overhaul allowed funds to be redirected for the repairs to the supercarrier , which had been extensively damaged off Vietnam.
From October 1968 through May 1969, she underwent preservation and deactivation processes, and she was decommissioned on 3 May 1969. &quot;Triton&quot; became the U.S. Navy&#x27;s first nuclear-powered submarine to be taken out of service, and second in the world, after the Soviet Navy&#x27;s submarine in 1968. On 6 May 1969, &quot;Triton&quot; departed New London under tow and proceeded to Norfolk, Virginia, where she was placed in the reserve fleet. She remained berthed at Norfolk or at the St. Julien&#x27;s Creek Annex of Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia, into 1993. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Registry on 30 April 1986. In August 1993, the hulks of the ex-&quot;Triton&quot; and the ex-&quot;Ray&quot; were towed by the salvage tug to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNS), in Bremerton, Washington, arriving on 3 September 1993, to await their turn in the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program (SRP).

Effective 1 October 2007, ex-&quot;Triton&quot; landed on the keel resting blocks in the drydock basin to begin recycling (&quot;pictured&quot;). The long delay in the disposal of ex-&quot;Triton&quot; has been attributed to the complexity of her dual reactor plant. Final recycling was completed effective 30 November 2009.

==Honors and awards==

===Presidential Unit Citation===
On 10 May 1960, Secretary of the Navy William B. Franke presented the Presidential Unit Citation (PUC) to &quot;Triton&quot; for Operation Sandblast, the first submerged circumnavigation of the world. Chief Torpedoman&#x27;s Mate Chester Raymond Fitzjarrald, the chief of the boat, accepted the PUC on behalf of &quot;Triton&quot;″s officers and crew. The citation reads:

For meritorious achievement from 16 February 1960 to 10 May 1960. During this period the TRITON circumnavigated the earth submerged, generally following the route of Magellan&#x27;s historic voyage. In addition to proving the ability of both crew and nuclear submarine to accomplish a mission which required almost three months of submergence, TRITON collected much data of scientific importance. The performance, determination and devotion to duty of the TRITON&#x27;s crew were in keeping with the highest traditions of the naval service. All members of the crew who made this voyage are authorized to wear the Presidential Unit Citation ribbon with a special clasp in the form of a golden replica of the globe.

Up to that time, this was only the second time that a U.S. Navy vessel had been awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for a peacetime mission, with the nuclear submarine receiving the first peacetime PUC in recognition of Operation Sunshine, the first submerged voyage under the North Pole in 1958. To commemorate the first submerged circumnavigation of the world, all &quot;Triton&quot; personnel who made that voyage were authorized to wear their Presidential Unit Citation ribbon with a special clasp in the form of a golden replica of the globe (&quot;pictured&quot;).

===Naval Unit Commendation===
The citation reads:

For exceptionally meritorious service during a period in 1967. USS &quot;Triton&quot; conducted important and arduous independent submarine operations of great importance to the national defense of the United States. The outstanding results achieved during the highly successful operations attest to the exceptional professional skill, resourcefulness and ingenuity of &quot;Triton&quot;″s officers and men. Their inspiring performance of duty throughout was in keeping with the highest traditions of the naval service.

==Legacy==
===Triton plaque===

In the eight days prior to &quot;Triton&quot;″s departure on her around-the-world submerged voyage, Captain Beach approached Lt. Tom B. Thamm, &quot;Triton&quot;″s Auxiliary Division Officer, to design a commemorative plaque for their upcoming voyage, as well as the first circumnavigation led by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan. The plaque&#x27;s eventual design consisted of a brass disk about in diameter, bearing a sailing ship reminiscent of Magellan&#x27;s carrack, &quot;Trinidad&quot;, above the submarine dolphin insignia with the years 1519 and 1960 between them, all within a laurel wreath. Outside the wreath is the motto &quot;AVE NOBILIS DUX, ITERUM FACTUM EST&quot; (&quot;Hail Noble Captain, it is Done Again&quot;).

Commodore Tom Henry, commanding Submarine Squadron 10, supervised the completion of the plaque. The carving of the wooden form was done by retired Chief Electrician&#x27;s Mate Ernest L. Benson at New London. The actual molding of the plaque was done by the Mystic Foundry.

During the homeward leg of her around-the-world voyage, &quot;Triton&quot; rendezvoused with the destroyer on 2 May 1960 off Cadiz, Spain, the departure point for Magellan&#x27;s earlier voyage. &quot;Triton&quot; broached, and &quot;John W. Weeks&quot; transferred the finished plaque to &quot;Triton&quot; for transport back to the United States. The plaque was subsequently presented to the Spanish government by John Davis Lodge, the United States Ambassador to Spain. This plaque is located at the City Hall in Sanlúcar de Barrameda, Spain, and it is mounted on the wall of the city hall with a marble slab memorializing the 1960 &quot;Triton&quot; submerged circumnavigation.

Duplicates of the Triton Plaque were also presented to the Mystic Seaport Museum in Mystic, Connecticut, and the Naval Historical Association in Washington, D.C., as well as the U.S. Navy Submarine School and the U.S. Navy Submarine Force Library and Museum, both located in Groton, Connecticut.

===&quot;Triton&quot; memorials===

Triton Light is a navigational beacon on the seawall of the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, where the Severn River meets Spa Creek and the Annapolis harbor. It was donated to the Academy and named for the Greek god by the United States Naval Academy Class of 1945. The crew of &quot;Triton&quot; provided samples of water taken from the 22 seas through which their boat had sailed during their submerged 1960 circumnavigation. These samples filled a globe built into the Triton Light, and the naming of the light and significance of the globe are explained in a commemorative marker.

Beach Hall is the new headquarters for the United States Naval Institute which was dedicated on 21 April 1999 (&quot;pictured&quot;). The facility is named after Captain Edward L. Beach Sr., who served as the institute&#x27;s secretary-treasurer, and his son, Edward L. Beach Jr., who commanded &quot;Triton&quot; during Operation Sandblast. The dive wheel from &quot;Triton&quot;″s conning tower is on display in the lobby of Beach Hall.

&quot;Triton&quot; was the 2003 inductee into the Submarine Hall of Fame following her nomination by the Tidewater chapter and Hampton Roads Base of the United States Submarine Veterans, Inc. (USSVI). A shadow box filled with &quot;Triton&quot; memorabilia was placed in Alcorn Auditorium of Ramage Hall located at the U.S. Navy Submarine Learning Center, Naval Station Norfolk.

USS &quot;Triton&quot; Recruit Barracks (Ship 12) was dedicated in ceremonies at the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Recruit Training Command, Naval Station Great Lakes, near North Chicago, Illinois, on 25 June 2004. The facility honors the memory of two submarines named &quot;Triton&quot; and includes memorabilia from both. Triton Hall is the fifth barracks constructed under the RTC Recapitalization Project, covering 172,000 square feet (15,979 square meters) in floor space. The facility is designed to accommodate 1056 recruits, and it includes berthing, classrooms, learning resource centers, a galley, a quarterdeck, and a modern HVAC system. On 17 May 2012, in a dedication ceremony, the long-missing ship&#x27;s bell was added to the collection of artifacts in Recruit Training Command&#x27;s USS Triton recruit barracks quarterdeck (&quot;pictured&quot;).

The USS &quot;Triton&quot; Submarine Memorial Park is located on the Columbia River, at the end of Port of Benton Boulevard in north Richland, Washington. Its purpose is &quot;to establish a permanent park in north Richland in recognition of all the decommissioned reactor cores off-loaded at the Port&#x27;s barge slip, transported and stored at the Hanford Site&quot;.

The park features &quot;Triton&quot;″s sail superstructure (&quot;pictured&quot;) and an information display on the history of &quot;Triton&quot;. The park also serves as a tourist attraction, especially due to its location, since Hanford is the resting place of spent reactor cores from several Navy ships. Planning called for the sail to be cut up for transport and reassembled at the park site. Ground-breaking was initially scheduled to take place on 3 April 2008, with the dedication ceremony set for 19 August 2008 and a Fall 2009 start-date for construction. On 23 October 2009, the Port of Benton encased &quot;Triton&quot;″s conning tower in concrete at its new USS &quot;Triton&quot; Submarine Memorial Park in north Richland, Washington. In mid-December 2009, the final pieces of &quot;Triton&quot;″s sail were welded together at the park&#x27;s site. During the 11 August 2010 Port of Benton commission meeting, it was reported that bids for the first phase, which includes the park&#x27;s electrical lighting system and the pouring the concrete around &quot;Triton&quot;″s sail, would be announced shortly by the port authority. The second phase would involve the park&#x27;s landscaping, and the third phase would be the installation of a parking lot. The park is part of the Richland Riverfront Trail, a marked hiking trail that focuses on the state of Washington&#x27;s contribution to the nuclear history of the United States, and it connects to the Sacagawea Heritage Trail. The USS &quot;Triton&quot; Submarine Memorial Park is located off George Washington Way near the Columbia River, and it was formally dedicated on 10 November 2011, the 52nd anniversary of the commissioning of the USS &quot;Triton&quot;.

In 2011, the USS &quot;Triton&quot;, Operation Sandblast, and Captain Edward L. Beach Jr., were included in the Technology for the Nuclear Age: Nuclear Propulsion display for the Cold War exhibit at the U.S. Navy Museum in Washington, D.C.

===Cultural references===

&quot;Triton&quot;″s submerged circumnavigation, Operation Sandblast, was the subject of the ABC television series &quot;Expedition!&quot; broadcast on Tuesday, 14 February 1961. Hosted by John D. Craig, this episode was titled &quot;Saga of the &quot;Triton&quot;&quot;, and it featured film footage from Operation Sandblast with voice-over narration extracted from Captain Beach&#x27;s logbook.

&quot;Triton&quot; is referenced briefly in three popular Cold War novels. In &quot;The Last Mayday&quot; by Keith Wheeler (1968), &quot;Triton&quot; is depicted as participating in a submarine training exercise at the beginning of the novel, with special notice made of her large, rectangular sail. In the 1978 novel &quot;Cold is the Sea&quot; by Edward L. Beach, the second sequel to his 1955 best-seller &quot;Run Silent, Run Deep&quot;, &quot;Triton&quot; is mentioned several times. Also, the under-ice towing capability that was considered for &quot;Triton&quot; served as a key plot point for the novel. Finally, in &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; by Tom Clancy, the biographical background for Marko Ramius mentions that, while commanding a &quot;Charlie&quot;-class submarine, Ramius had &quot;hounded [&quot;Triton&quot;] mercilessly for twelve hours&quot; in the Norwegian Sea. Subsequently, Ramius &quot;would note with no small satisfaction that the &quot;Triton&quot; was soon thereafter retired, because, it was said, the oversized vessel had proven unable to deal with the newer Soviet designs&quot;.

Two films of the period, &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; and &quot;Around the World Under the Sea&quot;, dramatized globe-circling submerged voyages similar to Operation Sandblast. Also, in the teaser of the episode &quot;Mutiny&quot; of the &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; television series, broadcast on 11 January 1965, the fictional nuclear submarine &quot;Neptune&quot; is on her shakedown cruise, under the supervision of Admiral Harriman Nelson (Richard Basehart), and when the submarine&#x27;s port shaft bearing begins overheating, Admiral Nelson orders a hose be rigged to cool the port shaft down with sea water, the same solution Admiral Rickover had suggested during &quot;Triton&quot;″s sea trials.

The 1960 &quot;The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart&quot; comedy album included a sketch entitled &quot;The Cruise of the U.S.S. Codfish&quot; which was a monologue involving the final address by the captain to the crew of a nuclear-powered submarine after completing a two-year-long, around-the-world underwater voyage. Bob Newhart noted in a 2006 interview that:

Captain Beach reportedly played &quot;The Cruise of the U.S.S. Codfish&quot; over the ship&#x27;s public address system during &quot;Triton&quot;″s first overseas deployment in the Fall of 1960.

Antigua-Barbuda issued a commemorative stamp of &quot;Triton&quot;″s 1960 submerged circumnavigation. Also, &quot;Triton&quot; was the name of one of the submersibles featured in the Submarine Voyage attraction at Disneyland which operated from 1959 to 1998.

===50th anniversary of Operation Sandblast===

The 50th anniversary of Operation Sandblast and &quot;Triton&quot;″s submerged circumnavigation of the world was celebrated on 10 April 2010, during the 2010 Submarine Birthday Ball held at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Mashantuket, Connecticut, with Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy (MCPON) Rick D. West delivering opening remarks (&quot;pictured&quot;) to the 2,200 attendees. The U.S. Navy Submarine Force Library and Museum sponsored additional events and activities, entitled &quot;9,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot;, between 10 and 12 April and 14–18 April 2010.

Also, on 9 April 2010, retired Admiral Henry G. Chiles Jr., who served in &quot;Triton&quot; from 1963 to 1966, was the keynote speaker at the graduation class of the Basic Enlisted Submarine School at the New London Naval Submarine Base in Groton, Connecticut. The graduation class was named in honor of &quot;Triton&quot;, and each graduate received a certificate of course completion and a commemorative coin celebrating the 50th anniversary of &quot;Triton&quot;″s submerged circumnavigation. The Dolphin Scholarship Foundation used the 50th anniversary of Operation Sandblast to promote its &quot;Race Around the World&quot; fund-raising program to support its Dolphin Scholarship program. Finally, former members of &quot;Triton&quot;″s crew received commemorative souvenirs of the ship&#x27;s pressure hull at their 2010 re-union.

On 25 April 2010, the University of Texas Marine Science Institute posted a radio program article on its Science and the Sea web site commemorating Operation Sandblast and &quot;Triton&quot;.

For the 50th anniversary of Operation Sandblast, writer-historian Carl LaVO wrote &quot;Incredible Voyage&quot; for the June 2010 edition of &quot;Naval History&quot; magazine, and John Beach wrote &quot;The First Submerged Circumnavigation&quot; for the April 1960 issue of &quot;The Submarine Review&quot;, the official magazine of the Naval Submarine League. Mr. Beach is the nephew of Captain Edward L. Beach, the commanding officer of the USS &quot;Triton&quot; during Operation Sandblast. Finally, the Naval Institute Press published &quot;Beneath the Waves&quot; by Dr. Edward F. Finch, a 2010 biography of the late Captain Beach, which includes extensive coverage of Operation Sandblast.

The legacy of Operation Sandblast on its 50th anniversary was summarized by retired Captain James C. Hay who had served on &quot;Triton&quot; during the historic submerged around-the-world voyage. On the editorial page of the April 1960 issue of &quot;The Submarine Review&quot;, the official magazine of the Naval Submarine League, Captain Hay noted:

It is truly a cruise which tested the crew&#x27;s mettle and proved the skipper&#x27;s &quot;tenacity&quot;. More than that, however, it again proved to all who cared to listen that the U.S. Navy could go anywhere, at any time, and do what ever was required. It&#x27;s a good sea story about doing what had to be done. On the fiftieth anniversary of the First Submerged Circumnavigation it&#x27;s a good thing to do to re-read about one of the forerunners of all we&#x27;re done since.

<doc id="404765" wikidata="Q5255829" url="?curid=404765" title="Democratic Socialist Perspective">
<text>The Democratic Socialist Perspective (DSP) was an Australian socialist political group. It was founded in 1972 as the Socialist Workers League (SWL), changing its name to the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) a few years later. In the early 1990s it was once again renamed, as the Democratic Socialist Party, and in 2003 it became the Democratic Socialist Perspective. 

The DSP operated as the largest component of a broad-left socialist formation, the Socialist Alliance, until in 2010, it voted to merge into the Socialist Alliance.

== History ==

=== Formation ===
The DSP started as the orthodox Trotskyist Socialist Workers League (SWL), founded in 1972 by members of the radical Socialist Youth Alliance (previously, and also currently, called Resistance) which grew out of the student radicalisation surrounding Australian involvement in the Vietnam War. Separate to this, the Labor Action Group formed in Brisbane. Led by John and Sue McCarthy (who had recently returned after working with the International Marxist Group in England) and Di and Larry Zetlin, it fused with the SWL at the SWL founding conference in January 1972. The SWL affiliated to the reunified Fourth International, under the influence of the American section, the Socialist Workers Party. It was also undoubtedly due to this influence that the SWL itself took the name Socialist Workers Party (SWP).

The unity between the former Labor Action Group members and their supporters in other states (generally seen as supporters of the European-based International Majority Tendency of the Fourth International) within the SWL and the majority of the SWL, which supported the positions of the minority faction within the Fourth International, known as the Leninist Trotskyist Faction, was short-lived. A minority of SWL/Socialist Youth Alliance members split in August 1972 and went on to form the Communist League as a national organisation.

The Communist League in Australia was co-founded by Queensland doctor John McCarthy (1948–2008), who later played a major role in integrating the CL and the SWP. Author Peter Robb was the second main driving force, and helped to produce its newspaper, &quot;Militant&quot;. Activist and later academic Marcia Langton was the third member of the CL committee. McCarthy broke away from the SWP (then Socialist Workers League) to create CL, and then, along with Robb and Langton, rejoined the SWP four years later, in November 1976.
Both the Socialist Workers League and the Communist League were recognised as sympathising organisations of the Fourth International in Australia, a situation which remained until the two groups re-united as the Socialist Workers Party in January 1978.

=== Abandonment of Trotskyism ===
In 1986 the American SWP broke with orthodox Trotskyism and disaffiliated from the Fourth International. While maintaining Leon Trotsky&#x27;s critique of the USSR, the party replaced Trotsky&#x27;s theory of permanent revolution with the view that socialist revolution in Third World countries (countries in which, according to Marxist theory, the development of capitalism has been distorted by colonialism and imperialism) will take place in two connected stages. The SWL followed suit. In the early 1990s it was renamed the Democratic Socialist Party. It contested the 1998 federal election as part of the Democratic Socialist Electoral League. 

The Democratic Socialist Electoral League espoused a left-wing position on most issues, including privatisation, the environment, immigration and civil rights. The party also had a comprehensive preferencing arrangement, supporting the Greens and some other left-wing groups. It differentiated itself from the Greens by claiming that the latter had no clear economic policy. It supported Labor over the Liberal Party, and was particularly opposed to the rise of One Nation.

A smaller group of loyalists to the American SWP split from the DSP and use the name Communist League to the present day. In 2022, Communist League members from throughout Australia and New Zealand relocated to Sydney to consolidate the organization.

=== Socialist Alliance ===

In 2001, the DSP, along with several other socialist parties including the International Socialist Organisation, formed the Socialist Alliance, initially an electoral vehicle. In 2002 the DSP championed the idea of turning Socialist Alliance into more of a party formation, although at first it had to withdraw this proposal as the ISO&#x27;s opposition threatened to destroy the alliance. In 2003 the DSP became the first (and so far only) Socialist Alliance affiliate to become an internal tendency within the Alliance, changing its name to the Democratic Socialist Perspective, in line with its view that SA should become a &quot;Multi-Tendency Socialist Party&quot;, a view that the May 2003 National Conference of the Socialist Alliance subsequently adopted.

Each of these changes of name and tactics has been accompanied, like in many far-left groups, with a turnover of members. While the SWP and DSP recruited many activists from the radical student movement of the 1970s and from various social movements since, it failed to retain most of them for long as the sixties and seventies radicalisation wave has receded. Nonetheless, the DSP has retained a core membership drawn from each upsurge of political struggle, some of whom are founding members of the party back in 1972. The SWP, and then DSP, was led by Jim Percy as National Secretary from 1972 until his death in 1992.

The Socialist Alliance had been created in alliance with other forces in the hopes of using joint electoral work amongst Australian socialists to increase trust and collaboration between socialists, and in the process making socialist organisation a more attractive option to the left. But although it contested the 2001 federal election and the 2004 federal election, as well as several state elections, it has failed to attract significant support. The Socialist Alliance has had two electoral successes, electing Sam Wainwright to Fremantle City Council in 2009 and Sue Bolton to Moreland City Council in 2012.

A debate broke out in the DSP in 2005 about its Socialist Alliance orientation but the minority viewpoint that opposed continuing with the Alliance orientation was soundly defeated at the DSP&#x27;s January 2008 congress. This caused a split, after the opposition was expelled subsequently forming a new organisation the same year, the Revolutionary Socialist Party.

In October 2009, the DSP National Committee proposed that the organisation merge itself into the Socialist Alliance. At the DSP National Congress in January 2010, the membership voted to go ahead with the merger.

<doc id="404766" wikidata="Q500983" url="?curid=404766" title="Faisal Mosque">
<text>The Faisal Mosque () is the national mosque of Pakistan, located in the capital city, Islamabad. It is the sixth-largest mosque in the world, the largest mosque outside the Middle East, and the largest within South Asia, located on the foothills of Margalla Hills in Islamabad. It is named after the late King Faisal of Saudi Arabia. The mosque features a contemporary design consisting of eight sides of concrete shell and is inspired by the design of a typical Bedouin tent.

A major tourist attraction in Pakistan, the mosque is a contemporary and influential piece of Islamic architecture. 
Famous spots like the Faisal Mosque, a masterpiece of modern Islamic architecture, and the Pakistan Monument, which represents the country’s cultural history, add to the city’s charm.

Construction of the mosque began in 1976 after a $28 million grant from Saudi King Faisal, whose name the mosque bears. The unconventional design by Turkish architect Vedat Dalokay was selected after an international competition. Without a typical dome, the mosque is shaped like a Bedouin tent, surrounded by four tall minarets. The design features eight-sided shell shaped sloping roofs forming a triangular worship hall which can hold 10,000 worshippers.

Combined the structure covers an area of , the mosque dominates the landscape of Islamabad. It is situated at the north end of Faisal Avenue, putting it at the northernmost end of the city and at the foot of Margalla Hills, the westernmost foothills of the Himalayas. It is located on an elevated area of land against a picturesque backdrop of the national park. Faisal Mosque was the largest mosque in the world from 1986 until 1993 when it was overtaken by the mosques in Saudi Arabia. Faisal Mosque is now the sixth largest mosque in the world in terms of capacity.

== History ==

The impetus for the mosque began in 1966 when King Faisal bin Abdul-Aziz supported the initiative of the Pakistani Government to build a national mosque in Islamabad during an official visit to Pakistan. 
In 1969, an international competition was held in which architects from 17 countries submitted 43 proposals. The winning design was that of Turkish architect Vedat Dalokay. Forty-six acres of land were assigned for the project and the execution was assigned to Pakistani engineers and workers. Construction of the mosque began in 1976 by National Construction Limited of Pakistan, led by Azim Khan and was funded by the government of Saudi Arabia, at a cost of over 130 million Saudi riyals (approximately 120 million USD today). King Faisal bin Abdul Aziz was instrumental in the funding, and both the mosque and the road leading to it were named after him after his assassination in 1975. King Faisal bin Abdulaziz&#x27;s successor King Khalid laid the foundation stone for the mosque in October 1976 and signed the construction agreement in 1978. Basic information about the mosque can be found written on the foundation stone. On 18 June 1988, the first prayer was held, although the mosque was completed in 1986. The mosque grounds along with being a building for prayer also used to house the International Islamic University some years ago but has since relocated to a new campus in 2000. Some traditional and conservative Muslims criticised the design at first for its unconventional design and lack of a traditional dome structure.

==Capacity==

The Faisal Mosque can accommodate about 300,000 worshippers. Each of the Mosque&#x27;s four minarets are 79 m (230 ft) high (the tallest minarets in South Asia) and measure 10×10 meters in circumference. The main areas have the capacity to hold up to 74000 people in the main areas including the inner hall, and the courtyards. The grounds around the mosque have the capacity to contain up to 200,000 people.

==Architecture==
Instead of using traditional domes, Vedat Dalokay designed an eight-sided main hall that looked like an Arab&#x27;s Bedouin desert tent. Additionally, he added four minarets on all four corners of the main hall, which are of high, the tallest minarets in South Asia. The main structure of the building is the main prayer hall, which is supported by four concrete girders. The four unusual minarets are inspired by Turkish architecture. Vedat Dalokay also believed that the design of the Masjid represents Kaaba in an abstract manner. Entrance is from the east, where the prayer hall is fronted by a courtyard with porticoes. The International Islamic University was housed under the main courtyard but now has relocated to a new campus. The mosque still houses a library, lecture hall, museum, and cafe. The interior of the main tent-shaped hall is covered in white marble and decorated with mosaics and calligraphy by the famous Pakistani artist Sadequain, and a Turkish-style chandelier. The mosaic pattern adorns the west wall and has the Kalimah written in early Kufic script, repeated in mirror image pattern.

The Qibla Wall is covered with blue and white calligraphic tiles designed by a Turkish artist Mengu Ertel. The interior of the mosque uses Turkish and Pakistani inspired decorations. The mosque takes an unusual route to its design by combining contemporary and classic Islamic architecture. The unique design takes most of its elements from nomadic Bedouin tent, but it still manages to keep in contact with Islamic architecture by using Ottoman style minarets and square shape form the Kaaba.
== Topography ==
Located at the foot of the Margalla Hills, the location plays a significant role in Faisal Mosque. The Mosque is visible from miles away and sits on a higher surface compared to the main city. The mosque faces the city and is backed by green mountain ranges, giving it a scenic view. One of the main highways of Islamabad, Faisal Avenue leads straight to the Mosque showing the importance of the landmark. The shining white color in comparison to the dark green background makes the mosque stand out and reveal its significance to the city of Islamabad.

==References in literature==
The Faisal Mosque is described in the book &quot;The Kite Runner&quot; by Khalid Hosseini. It is frequently referenced in the work of Michael Muhammad Knight, who came to the mosque to study Islam as a teenager.

<doc id="404767" wikidata="Q1144610" url="?curid=404767" title="Republican Party of Armenia">
<text>The Republican Party of Armenia (RPA, ; , &quot;HHK&quot;) is a national-conservative political party in Armenia led by the third president of Armenia, Serzh Sargsyan.

It was the first political party in independent Armenia to be founded (April 2, 1990) and registered (May 14, 1991). It is the largest party of the right-wing in Armenia, and claims to have had 140,000 members at its heyday. It was the ruling party of Armenia from 1999 to 2018. After the latest parliamentary elections in June 2021, the party entered parliament as a part of the opposition I Have Honor Alliance.

&quot;The Economist&quot; magazine has described the RPA as a &quot;typical post-Soviet &#x27;party of power&#x27; mainly comprising senior government officials, civil servants, and wealthy business people dependent on government connections.&quot; It has been described by political commentators as essentially lacking political ideology.

==Ideology==
The Republican Party&#x27;s national-conservative ideology is based on &quot;tseghakron&quot;, an early 20th-century Armenian nationalist ideology (roughly translated as &quot;nation-religion&quot;). It was formulated by Garegin Nzhdeh and holds that the Armenian national identity and state should carry religious significance for all ethnic Armenians. &quot;Tseghakron&quot; literally means &quot;carrier of race&quot;, referring to those who represent and carry what is the spiritual and biological essence of the &quot;classical&quot; Armenian. However, it is often erroneously interpreted to mean &quot;race-religion&quot;.

The Republican Party of Armenia was established in 1990 by Ashot Navasardyan. Navasardyan and several other founding members of the RPA were veterans of the National United Party and its successor, the Union for National Self-Determination, which engaged in underground activities aimed at achieving Armenia&#x27;s independence from the Soviet Union.

The RPA was founded in the context of the national awakening that occurred in Armenia in 1988, the fight for Armenian independence and the struggle for the unification of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) with Armenia. The armed group known as the Army of Independence (), which was founded by Ashot Navasardyan and his comrades in late 1989, became the organizational basis for the establishment of the RPA. On April 2, 1990, a founding council composed of the detachment commanders of the Army of Independence proclaimed the establishment of the Republican Party of Armenia in Yerevan, which became the first officially registered socio-political organization in Armenia (registered on May 14, 1991). Party founder Ashot Navasardyan was elected to the Supreme Soviet (parliament) of Armenia in the 1990 Armenian Supreme Soviet elections.

During the First Nagorno-Karabakh War, first as the Army of Independence and later as detachments detachments composed of RPA members, members of the party actively participated in defense of the borders of Armenia and the hostilities in Artsakh. On May 27, 1990, these detachments were among the first to resist the Soviet troops in Nubarashen. They were also actively involved in seizing Soviet Army weaponry and transferring it to the border regions of Armenia to arm militias fighting Soviet and Azerbaijani forces.

The RPA was among the founders of the first Armenian military cemetery – Yerablur pantheon.

The RPA has convened nine ordinary (in 1992, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009) and three extraordinary congresses (in 1996, 2002, and 2006). In 1999 the office of the party chairperson was abolished, and restored later in 2005.

The RPA has constantly focused on inter-party ties and has been actively involved in setting up different political alliances. The party was among the founders of the National Alliance formed in 1992 after the deterioration of the situation in Artsakh. The RPA actively participated in the work of the Civil Accord constitutional council formed in 1993.

In 1995, the RPA joined the Republican Bloc electoral coalition with the ruling Pan-Armenian National Movement party and two other parties to run in the 1995 Armenian parliamentary elections. However, due to the disagreements on the Nagorno-Karabakh issue, the RPA left the Republican Bloc in February 1998.

The party was led by Ashot Navasardyan from its foundation until his death in November 1997. After his death and until March 2007, Andranik Margaryan headed the party.

===Ruling party===
In July 1998 the RPA issued a joint statement with the powerful Yerkrapah Volunteers&#x27; Union and the latter&#x27;s faction in parliamentary, which commenced the process of political consolidation within the RPA. The politically active wing of the Yerkrapah Volunteers’ Union united with the Republican Party. Vazgen Sargsyan, Armenia&#x27;s influential defense minister and chairman of the Yerkrapah Volunteer&#x27;s Union, became the party leader. In 1999 the Republican Party set up the Unity electoral alliance with Karen Demirchyan&#x27;s People&#x27;s Party of Armenia. The Unity Bloc won a majority of seats in the 1999 parliamentary elections.

Following the parliamentary elections in 1999 the role of the RPA in the Armenian political life increased greatly. While the RPA was represented by only one member (Ashot Navasardyan) in the Supreme Soviet (parliament) formed in 1990 and won five seats in the National Assembly in the 1995 elections, after the 1999 elections the RPA was the largest party in parliament with 30 MPs. Functioning within the ruling Unity Bloc, the RPA was enabled to participate in forming the government of Armenia for the first time in 1999. Vazgen Sargsyan was appointed prime minister, with several RPA members appointed to ministerial positions in his cabinet.

Following the assassination of Vazgen Sargsyan in the 1999 Armenian parliament shooting, RPA representative Aram Sargsyan (brother of Vazgen Sargsyan) was appointed prime minister. Later, in May 2000, Andranik Margaryan, chairman of the RPA council and the leader of the Unity Bloc in parliament, was appointed prime minister. In 2001, Aram Sargsyan and several other former members of the RPA founded the Hanrapetutyun (Republic) Party.

The RPA published an official newspaper, &quot;Hanrapetakan&quot; (&quot;The Republican&quot;). Claiming allegiance to the nationalist ideology of Armenian military leader and thinker Garegin Nzhdeh, the RPA&#x27;s has made various publications Nzhdeh&#x27;s life, work and the ideologies related to him, Tseghakronism and Taronism, including the book series &quot;The Nationalist.&quot; In 2001, on the initiative of Prime Minister Andranik Margaryan, Garegin Nzhdeh&#x27;s 115th anniversary was celebrated at the state level.

The RPA increased its number of seats in parliament to 40 in the 2003 parliamentary elections, again becoming the largest faction in parliament. In 2003, as a result of negotiations, the three political forces supporting President of Armenia Robert Kocharyan—the Republican Party of Armenia, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation and the Rule of Law Party (Orinats Yerkir)—formed a parliamentary coalition. Andranik Margaryan continued to head the Armenian government, with seven ministers nominated by the RPA. The deputy speaker of parliament and three out of the six chairpersons of parliamentary standing committees were also elected from the Republican Party.

In May 2006 the Rule of Law Party left the parliamentary majority, and the National Assembly was subject to rearrangements of political forces, which resulted in RPA Chairman Tigran Torosyan becoming the Speaker of the Parliament.

The RPA 10th extraordinary congress of July 2006 proclaimed the Republican Party of Armenia a national conservative party. The congress decided to restore the office of the party council chairperson, which had been abolished in 2005. Serzh Sargsyan was elected the chairperson of the RPA Council.

On March 25, 2007, the RPA chairman Andranik Margaryan died, and the council chairman Serzh Sargsyan assumed the duties of the RPA chairman. On April 4, 2007, Serzh Sargsyan was appointed prime minister.

The RPA won 33.9% of the vote in the 2007 Armenian parliamentary elections. The RPA parliamentary faction was formed with 64 MPs. RPA Vice Chairman Tigran Torosyan was elected Speaker of the Parliament. The Republican Party signed a coalition memorandum with the Prosperous Armenia Party, and a memorandum of cooperation with the Armenian Revolutionary Federation.

On 10 November 2007 the 11th ordinary congress of the RPA was held, and some amendments to the Charter were made. The office of the party council chairperson was abolished, and the RPA Executive body was elected as the permanently functioning governing body, while the RPA Council was elected as the party&#x27;s representative body. Serzh Sargsyan was elected RPA chairman.

Serzh Sargsyan was elected President of Armenia in the controversial 2008 Armenian presidential elections. The Republican Party of Armenia, the Prosperous Armenia Party, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation and the Rule of Law Party signed a coalition agreement, and a government was formed with Tigran Sargsyan as prime minister.

At the 12th congress of the RPA held in November 2009 RA President Serzh Sargsyan was re-elected as party chairman.

The party scored well in the 2012 parliamentary election, winning 69 seats and retaining its absolute majority.

=== Cancellation of EU Association Agreement ===

The government led by the Republican Party, concluded negotiations for an Association Agreement which included a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area with the European Union in July 2013. However, in September 2013, the party led by Serzh Sargsyan suddenly decided not to sign the agreement and declared that Armenia would instead join the Russian-led Eurasian Union. Despite not signing an Association Agreement with the EU, the party insists that it does support developing closer political and economic relations with the EU, as well as maintaining strong relations with both Russia and the United States. Other political parties criticized the government&#x27;s last-minute decision to cancel the Association Agreement with the EU and vocally opposed Armenia&#x27;s membership in the Eurasian Union. Many criticized Russia for pressuring Sargsyan to abandon the deal with the EU.

=== Velvet Revolution and loss of power ===

The 2017 parliamentary election saw another victory for the Republican Party, winning 58 seats of 105. Soon after the election, a coalition government was formed together with the Armenian Revolutionary Federation.

In April 2018, Prime Minister Karen Karapetyan resigned and former president Serzh Sargsyan was proposed by the RPA as prime minister, despite Sargsyan&#x27;s promises not to become Armenia&#x27;s new leader following the end of his presidency. The move sparked mass protests in the country, starting the so-called Velvet Revolution.

The National Assembly approved Sargsyan as the new prime minister on 16 April 2018, causing furious protests in the streets of Yerevan. On 23 April, Sargsyan resigned from his post, while on 25 April the Armenian Revolutionary Federation withdrew from the government coalition and went into opposition. Karen Karapetyan was appointed as acting prime minister.

On 8 May 2018, opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan was elected prime minister by the National Assembly and formed a coalition government comprising all political forces (Tsarukyan Alliance, Way Out Alliance and the Armenian Revolutionary Federation) except the Republican Party of Armenia, which thus went into opposition.

The 2018 snap election saw the collapse of the Republican Party of Armenia, which only scored 4.7% of the votes and lost all political representation in the National Assembly for the first time since Armenia&#x27;s independence.

=== 2020–2021 Armenian protests ===
On 9 November 2020, the party signed a joint declaration with the other member parties of the Homeland Salvation Movement calling on Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan to resign during the 2020–2021 Armenian protests.

In May 2021, the Republican Party of Armenia and the Homeland Party announced that they would form their own political alliance, known as the I Have Honor Alliance, to run in the 2021 snap parliamentary elections. Following the election, the alliance received 5.22% of the popular vote, gaining 6 seats in the National Assembly.

==Allegations of political corruption==
Most of Armenia&#x27;s so-called &quot;oligarchs&quot; (government-connected entrepreneurs who enjoy &quot;de facto&quot; monopoly on lucrative forms of economic activity) are affiliated with the RPA.

In an RPA congress held in Yerevan in November 2007, then Prime Minister and presidential candidate Serge Sargsyan acknowledged that bribery, nepotism, and other corrupt practices are widespread in Armenia. &quot;Tax evasion and corruption must be regarded as a disgraceful and condemnable phenomenon,&quot; said Sargsyan. &quot;We must not take into account family ties and friendship and must not regard as friends and supporters those people who will avoid paying taxes and tolerate this vicious phenomenon.&quot; However, his opponents have long accused him of sponsoring the oligarchs enjoying the economic kickbacks.

===RPA-affiliated oligarchs===
RPA-affiliated entrepreneurs who enjoy &quot;de facto&quot; monopolies in Armenia include:
*Samvel Aleksanyan (Lfik Samo), a former member of parliament with close ties to former President Robert Kocharyan and former President Serzh Sargsyan, whose Salex Group has a monopoly on imports of sugar, flour, cooking oil, butter and other basic foodstuffs. Aleksanyan has been accused of hiding his true income, declaring his income for 2015 was 10 million AMD in addition to his 6.2 million AMD salary as an MP. His wife Shogherina Mkrtchyan declared her cash assets for 2016 as 3.7 billion AMD and 8.8 million US dollars, and had purchased property at over 4 million US dollars. The Aleksanyan family also owns the Yerevan City supermarket chain.
*Aleksandr Sargsyan (Sashik), brother of President Serzh Sargsyan and former member of parliament who has a fifty percent stake in Multi Lion, Armenia&#x27;s leading supplier of liquefied gas to households, cars and buses (the other fifty percent is owned by Gagik Tsarukyan&#x27;s Multi Group).
*Ruben Hayrapetyan (Nemets Rubo), a former parliament member with close ties to former President Robert Kocharyan and former President Serzh Sargsyan. Ruben Hayrapetyan resigned from parliament in June 2012 following the controversial death of an army doctor, Vahe Avetyan, at a restaurant owned by him. Hayrapetyan served as the President of the Football Federation of Armenia from 2002 to 2018.
*Mher Sedrakyan (Tokhmakhi Mher), a former member of parliament.

===RPA official accused in corruption===
In September 2008, the Audit Chamber of Armenia accused Suren Khachatryan, governor of the southeastern Syunik Province, and government officials subordinated to him of embezzling 575  million drams (US$1.9  million) worth of public funds and property. Khachatryan claims he is innocent.

<doc id="404769" wikidata="Q4216473" url="?curid=404769" title="Moortown, Leeds">
<text>Moortown is a suburb of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. It is a civil parish and sits in the Moortown ward of Leeds City Council in the north east of the city.

It is situated between Roundhay and Gledhow on the east and Weetwood on the west, with Chapel Allerton to the south, and Alwoodley to the north. It is synonymous with Moor Allerton, and institutions in the area use both names. Moortown lies in the LS17 postcode district, which was reported to contain the most expensive housing area in Yorkshire and the Humber by &quot;The Times&quot; in 2007. 

==General description==

The suburb is located around the junction of the (north-south) Harrogate Road A61 road and the Leeds Outer Ring Road (A6120) (west-east), at that point called the Moortown Ring Road, and overlooked by a Water Tower. Scott Hall Road (A61) and Harrogate Road lead southwards to Leeds city centre. The Leeds City Council boundary for Moortown ward is the Ring Road, with properties to the north in the Alwoodley ward. The Church of England parish includes areas north of the Ring Road. Woodland north and south of the Ring Road and by the water tower is called the &quot;Moortown Plantation&quot;. A post office, petrol station and other shops are located on Harrogate Road at the northern end of Moortown.

Moortown includes small estates of council housing around the junction of King Lane and the Moortown Ring Road.

==Moortown Corner==
Moortown Corner is the junction between Street Lane and Harrogate Road, a local shopping area and geographical reference. The building known as the Corner House was built as a cinema (1938–1940), ballroom and restaurant but now contains shops. From 1968 to 2008 it contained a casino. Nearby is a large Marks and Spencer Simply Food supermarket which serves the surrounding area. Branches of Leeds Building Society and Virgin Money (formerly Yorkshire Bank) can also be found at Moortown Corner. Halifax closed its local branch on 9 January 2024.

Moortown Corner is served by First Leeds service 2, which is represented red on the 10-minute frequency Overground network. Less regularly, services 7A, 7S, 38, and 48 run through Moortown Corner. Harrogate Bus Company&#x27;s distinctive route 36 also serves Moortown Corner, currently running between central Leeds and Harrogate every 15 minutes.

==Moor Allerton District Centre==
Moor Allerton District Centre is adjacent to the Moortown estate (west), north of the Ring Road and west of the junction with King Lane, which opened in 1982. Primarily a shopping centre, with a large Sainsbury&#x27;s, and a Homebase, it also includes a public library. A public house, the &quot;King on the Lane&quot;, was called the &quot;Penny Fun&quot; until 2019; its name relates to the history of the area as follows. The word &#x27;pen&#x27; comes from the Celtic for &#x27;hill&#x27;. What is now Tunnel How Hill is visible from the Centre to the south-west. It was previously &quot;Pen-how-fyn&quot;, and a hamlet around what is now the Centre was &quot;Paenfynaen&quot; (where &quot;fynaen&quot; means settlement). Tunnel How Hill was referred to as Penny Fun in the 19th century and several houses in the vicinity used the name. There is a Penny Field nearby in Meanwood Park.
==Housing estates==

===Black Moor and Cranmer Bank===

To the north of the ring road and west of King Lane is the Moortown estate (west) and Cranmer Bank is part of the estate, named after the moor on which Moortown was situated. This has varied housing from the 1950s to recent along Black Moor road. There is a parade of shops on Cranmer Bank as well as Moortown Social Club at the top of the hill, along with St Stephen&#x27;s Church (C of E). The main areas on the estate are Blackmoor, Tynwald, Deanswood, Scotland Wood, Cranmer Bank, Alderton and Saxon.

===Lingfield===

To the north of the ring road and east of King Lane is the Lingfield Estate comprising mainly semi-detached tenant properties and council flats.

===Queenshill===
To the south of the ring road and east of King Lane is the Queenshill estate, mainly low-rise flats, which was opened in 1962 by Sir Keith Joseph. This area contains a small row of shops, a fire station, Moortown Baptist Church, and the offices of the Leeds Jewish Housing Association.

===Leafield===
A smaller development of public housing lies to the south of the ring road and west of King Lane, essentially in the grounds of a former mansion, Leafield House, later Leafield Clinic, where the former Leeds North Clinical Commissioning Group&#x27;s offices were located, and which is now a nursery.

Leafield House was built around 1873 and was known initially as Albert House. In the 1920s, it was the family home of William Powell Bowman (1862-1955), the owner of Goodall, Backhouse &amp; Co., who described his profession as a “wholesale druggist and manufacturer of the celebrated Yorkshire Relish&quot;. Millions of bottles of Yorkshire Relish – a piquant, cold sauce – were manufactured in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Leafield House was bought in 1951 and two years later, the Leeds Corporation Health Committee submitted a planning application to turn the building into a maternity and child welfare centre. When clinical services were moved to more modern surroundings in 2012, Leafield House was refurbished to provide office space.

===Darkwood===

A small 1990 development low-rise flats off Shadwell Lane, in woods known as Blackwoods, part of the Forest of Leeds. The property was originally a large private estate called &quot;Blackwood&quot;. It was acquired by the City of Leeds sometime prior to 1963 and converted into several large flats with the extensive grounds preserved until the subsequent development of low rise flats in the 1990s.

==Religion==

Moortown and neighbouring Alwoodley are the main centres of the Leeds Jewish community. There are three synagogues in the Moortown area: the Beth Hamidrash Hagadol Synagogue on Street Lane, Etz Chaim Synagogue on Harrogate Road and the UHC Synagogue on Shadwell Lane. The Marjorie and Arnold Ziff Community Centre opened in 2005, providing facilities for the Jewish community in Leeds and district, with the only Kosher restaurant in Leeds and providing offices for some Jewish organisations. The Church of England parish church is St John the Evangelist on the corner of Harrogate Road and the ring road; the Catholic church is the Immaculate Heart of Mary Church. There is also a Baptist church on King Lane. Moortown Methodist Church Centre is located in the Black Moor area: it is currently used by Showers of Mercy Ministries International, Lighthouse Chapel and Leeds Independent Seventh Day Adventist Church, but there are no regular Methodist services there. There are three mosques which also act as Muslim community centres, including one in the former &quot;Lingfield&quot; public house on Lingfield Hill, which opened in 2016.

==St Gemma&#x27;s Hospice==

Moortown is home to St Gemma&#x27;s Hospice, a charity hospice founded by the Sisters of the Cross and Passion in 1978. It is named after St Gemma&#x27;s School which formerly occupied the site, in turn named after Italian Saint Gemma Galgani. This is situated to the south of Moortown Corner on Harrogate Road. In 2017 it became a University Teaching Hospice in association with the University of Leeds to give instruction in palliative care for health professionals. St Gemma&#x27;s Hospice operates 24 charity shops around Leeds.

==Sport==
There is a Rugby Union football club. Moortown Golf Club hosted the 1929 Ryder Cup, but is well north of the Ring Road and is now in the Alwoodley ward. Moor Allerton Sports and Social Centre has bowls, tennis and indoor activities. North Leeds FC&#x27;s home pitch is situated on Cranmer Bank, next to Moortown Social Club.

==Governance==
As of July 2022 there are three Labour Councillors and one Labour MP who are responsible for raising concerns / issues from the Moortown community. Moortown Community Group has a history on interacting with local councillors on behalf the local community, for example in working on the Council&#x27;s Neighbourhood Design Statement.

<doc id="404772" wikidata="Q908639" url="?curid=404772" title="Case citation">
<text>Case citation is a system used by legal professionals to identify past court case decisions, either in series of books called reporters or law reports, or in a neutral style that identifies a decision regardless of where it is reported. Case citations are formatted differently in different jurisdictions, but generally contain the same key information.

A legal citation is a &quot;reference to a legal precedent or authority, such as a case, statute, or treatise, that either substantiates or contradicts a given position.&quot; Where cases are published on paper, the citation usually contains the following information:
* Court that issued the decision
* Report title
* Volume number
* Page, section, or paragraph number
* Publication year

In some report series, for example in England, Australia and some in Canada, volumes are not numbered independently of the year: thus the year and volume number (usually no greater than 4) are required to identify which book of the series has the case reported within its covers. In such citations, it is usual in these jurisdictions to apply square brackets &quot;&quot; to the publication year (which may not be the year that the case was decided: for example, a case decided in December 2001 may have been reported in 2002).

The Internet brought with it the opportunity for courts to publish their decisions on websites and most published court decisions now appear in that way. They can be found through many national and other websites, such as WorldLII and AfricanLII, that are operated by members of the Free Access to Law Movement.

The resulting flood of non-paginated information has led to numbering of paragraphs and the adoption of a medium-neutral citation system. This usually contains the following information:
* Year of decision
* Abbreviated title of the court
* Decision number (not the court file number)
Rather than utilizing page numbers for pinpoint references, which would depend upon particular printers and browsers, pinpoint quotations refer to paragraph numbers.

==Pronunciation of case titles==
In common law countries with an adversarial system of justice, the names of the opposing parties are separated in the case title by the abbreviation &quot;v&quot; (usually written as &quot;v&quot; in Commonwealth countries and usually as &quot;v.&quot; in the U.S.) of the Latin word &quot;versus&quot;, which means &quot;against&quot;. When case titles are read out loud, the &quot;v&quot; can be pronounced, depending on the context, as &quot;and&quot;, &quot;against&quot;, &quot;versus&quot;, or &quot;vee&quot;.

===Commonwealth pronunciation===
Most Commonwealth countries follow English legal style:

* Civil cases are pronounced with &quot;and&quot;. For example, &quot;Smith v Jones&quot; would be pronounced &quot;Smith Jones&quot;.
* Criminal cases are pronounced with &quot;against&quot;. For example, &quot;R v Smith&quot; would be pronounced &quot;the Crown Smith&quot;. The Latin words &quot;Rex&quot;, &quot;Regina&quot;, and &quot;versus&quot; are all rendered into English.
* In Australia and the United Kingdom, &quot;versus&quot; and &quot;vee&quot; are arguably incorrect.
* In Scotland, both civil and criminal cases are pronounced using &quot;against&quot; in the place of &quot;v&quot;.

===American pronunciation===
In the United States, there is no consensus on the pronunciation of the abbreviation &quot;v.&quot; This has led to much confusion about the pronunciation and spelling of court cases:

* &quot;Versus&quot; is most commonly used, leading some newspapers to use the common abbreviation &quot;vs.&quot; in place of the legal abbreviation &quot;v.&quot;
* &quot;Against&quot; is a matter of personal style. For example, Warren E. Burger and John Paul Stevens preferred to announce cases at the Supreme Court with &quot;against&quot;.
* &quot;And&quot; is used by some law professors, but other law professors regard it as an affectation.
* Pronouncing the letter &quot;vee&quot; () is used almost exclusively for &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, probably due to its widespread invocation in American culture. This pronunciation—which is discouraged within the legal profession—is otherwise rare among the general public, even when referring to other well-known cases like &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;.

During oral arguments in &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot; (1992), the participants demonstrated the lack of consensus on the pronunciation of &quot;v.&quot;, using different pronunciations. Solicitor General Ken Starr even managed to use all three of the most common American pronunciations interchangeably:
==Australia==
Legal citation in Australia generally mirrors the methods of citation used in England. A widely used guide to Australian legal citation is the &quot;Australian Guide to Legal Citation&quot;, commonly known as AGLC, published jointly by the &quot;Melbourne University Law Review&quot; and the &quot;Melbourne Journal of International Law&quot;.

The standard case citation format in Australia is:

As in Canada, there has been divergence among citation styles. There exist commercial citation guides published by Butterworths and other legal publishing companies, academic citation styles and court citation styles. Each court in Australia may cite the same case slightly differently. There is presently a movement in convergence to the comprehensive academic citation style of the Australian Guide to Legal Citation published jointly by the &quot;Melbourne University Law Review&quot; and the &quot;Melbourne Journal of International Law&quot;.

===Reports===

===Neutral citation===
Australian courts and tribunals have now adopted a neutral citation standard for case law. The format provides a naming system that does not depend on the publication of the case in a law report. Most cases are now published on AustLII using neutral citations.

The standard format looks like this:

So the above-mentioned &quot;Mabo&quot; case would then be cited like this: &quot;Mabo v Queensland (No 2)&quot; [1992] HCA 23.

There is a unique court identifier code for most courts. The court and tribunal identifiers include:

=== Citation standards in Canada ===
There are a number of citation standards in Canada. Many legal publishing companies and schools have their own standard for citation. Some courts have produced their own citation guides. For example, the courts in Saskatchewan have produced a bilingual citation guide that is to be used in all three Saskatchewan courts: &quot;Citation Guide for the Courts of Saskatchewan&quot;. Since the late 1990s, however, much of the legal community has converged to a single standard—formulated in &quot;The Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation / Manuel canadien de la référence juridique&quot;, commonly known as the &quot;McGill Guide&quot; after the &quot;McGill Law Journal&quot;, which first published it.

More recently, in June 2024, CanLII announced a new, open access legal citation guide: the &quot;Canadian Open Access Legal Citation Guide&quot; (&quot;COAL&quot;), which is available at no charge on the CanLII system. The COAL follows a similar system for citing cases.

The following format reflects these standards:

:&quot;Hunter v Southam&quot;, [1984] 2 SCR 145.

Broken into its component parts, the format is:
The &quot;Style of Cause&quot; is italicized as in all other countries and the party names are separated by &quot;v&quot; (English) or &quot;c&quot; (French). Prior to 1984 the appellant party would always be named first. However, since then case names do not switch order when the case is appealed.

Undisclosed parties to a case are represented by initials (e.g., &quot;R v RDS&quot;). Criminal cases are prosecuted by the Crown, which is always represented by &quot;R&quot; for &quot;Regina&quot; (queen) or &quot;Rex&quot; (king). Reference questions (advisory opinions) are always entitled &quot;Reference re&quot; followed by the subject title.

If the year of decision is the same as the year of the report and the date is a part of the reporter&#x27;s citation, then the date need not be listed after the &quot;style of cause&quot;. If the date of the decision is different from the year of the report, then both should be shown.

Where available, cases should be cited with their neutral citation immediately after the &quot;style of cause&quot; and preceding the print citation. For example,

:&quot;Chaoulli v Quebec (Attorney General)&quot;, 2005 SCC 35, [2005] 1 SCR 791.

This format was adopted as the standard in 2006, in the sixth edition of the McGill Guide. Prior to this format, the opposite order of parallel citation was used.

The seventh edition of the McGill Guide, published 2010-08-20, removes most full stop/period (&quot;.&quot;) characters from the citations, e.g., a citation to the Supreme Court Reports that previously would have been [2005] 1 S.C.R. 791, is now [2005] 1 SCR 791. Most full stops are also removed from styles of cause. The seventh edition also further highlights the significance of neutral citations (i.e., tribunal-assigned citations that are publisher-independent).

====Reports====

===Neutral citation===
In 1999 the Canadian Judicial Council adopted a neutral citation standard for case law. The format provides a naming system that does not depend on the publication of the case in a law report.

The standard format looks like this:
==== Court identifiers ====
There is a unique court identifier code for most courts. 
== Denmark ==
Denmark has no official standard or style guide governing case citation. However, most case citations include the same elements.

=== Published decisions ===
Citations of decisions published in a reporter usually consist of the &quot;name or abbreviation of the reporter&quot;, the &quot;year or volume&quot;, the &quot;page number&quot; where the decision begin (sometimes followed by an &quot;identifying number&quot; if more than one judgment is on a page), as well as the &quot;name or abbreviation of the court which decided the case&quot;. As an example, the &quot;Aalborg Kloster-judgment&quot;, a precedent-setting Supreme Court judgment regarding strict liability, is published in Ugeskrift for Retsvæsen volume 1968 as the second judgment on page 84. A citation of this case could take the form , , , or something similar. In this case &quot;U&quot;, &quot;UfR&quot; and &quot;Ugeskrift for Retsvæsen&quot; identify the reporter, &quot;1968&quot; identifies the year or volume, &quot;84&quot; identifies the starting page, &quot;/2&quot; indicates that the judgment is the second one on that particular page, and &quot;H&quot; identifies the court which decided the case.

Certain reporters, such as Tidsskrift for Skatter og Afgifter, do not identify published decisions by page number, but by a serial number. Citations to these reporters use the serial number in place of a page number.

=== Unpublished decisions ===
If a decision has not been published in a reporter, more identifying information is needed. Generally, citations to unreported cases involve the &quot;name of the court&quot;, the &quot;date of the decision&quot; and the &quot;case number&quot; assigned by the court. For example: Sø- og Handelsrettens dom af 3. maj 2018 i sag nr. V-17-17 (The Maritime and Commercial Court&#x27;s judgment of May 3 in case no. V-17-17). Certain authors format these citations to mimic the &quot;short citation&quot; of published cases.

=== Neutral citations and the ECLI ===
The Danish Court Administration is currently working on a public database which will make all judgments available to the public (currently only the Supreme Court as well as the Maritime and Commercial Court do this). The database is expected to implement the European Case Law Identifier, which will make uniform, neutral citations of decisions possible.

==Germany==

In Germany there are two types of citation: the full citation of a case and its shortened form. In e.g. scientific articles, the full citation of a particular case is only used at its first occurrence; after that, its shortened form is used. In most law journals, the articles themselves only use the shortened form; the full citations for all articles sometimes are summarized at the beginning of that journals edition.

A third type (yet not too widely spread) is the citation by using the European Case Law Identifier, a ″neutral″ citation system introduced by the Council of the European Union in 2011, which Germany is participating in.

===Federal Constitutional Court===
The most important cases of the Federal Constitutional Court are published by the court in its official collection. This collection is abbreviated &quot;BVerfGE&quot;, whereas &quot;BVerfG&quot; is short for , the German court name, and &quot;E&quot; stands for (decision).

Starting in 2004, the court also publishes the BVerfGK collection, containing decisions made only by a , a specific panel of the court.

The so-called &quot;&quot; for example could be cited
:BVerfGE 65, 1 (43), Urteil des Ersten Senats vom 15. Dezember 1983 auf die mündliche Verhandlung vom 18. und 19. Oktober 1983, Az. 1 BvR 209, 269, 362, 420, 440, 484/83.
in full and
:BVerfGE 65, 1 (43).
in short.

For the meaning of the different case numbers of the BVerfG see the German article.

If decisions are not yet published by the court, or will not be published at all, law journals can be cited, e.g.,
:BVerfG, NJW 2009, 1234 (1235 f.).
Where &quot;NJW&quot; stands for the law journal &quot;Neue Juristische Wochenschrift&quot;, 2009 is the year, 1234 the page of the beginning and 1235 the cited page(s) – &quot;f.&quot; stands for &quot;seq.&quot;. In general, citations of the official collections are preferred.

===Federal Court of Justice===
The Federal Court of Justice (, short BGH) publishes the official collections for its criminal law decisions and for those in private law.

The &quot;&quot; e.g. would be cited
:BGHSt 35, 347 ff., Urteil des 4. Strafsenats vom 15. September 1988, Az. 4 StR 352/88.
in full and
:BGHSt 35, 347 ff.
in short (in this example, the page cited is not specifically page 347 but that and those which follow, as indicated by the abbreviation &quot;ff.&quot;).

===Other federal courts===
The official collection of the Federal Social Court (, BSG) is abbreviated .

The official collection of the Federal Fiscal Court (, BFH) is .

The official collection of the Federal Labour Court (, BAG) is .

The official collection of the Federal Administrative Court (, BVerwG) is .

===Other courts===
For other courts, generally the same rules apply, though most do not publish an official collection, so they must be cited from a law journal.

===European Case Law Identifier===
According to the ECLI system the &quot;Volkszählungsurteil&quot; would be cited as
and the &quot;Katzenkönigfall&quot; as 

==India==
India&#x27;s vast federated judicial system admits to a large number of reporters, each with their own style of citation. There are over 200 law reports in India – subject-wise and state (province)-wise, authorized and unauthorized.

===Supreme Court of India===
The official reporter for Supreme Court decisions is the Supreme Court Reports. These reports however lag behind other journals in the speed of reporting. While decisions themselves are uploaded by the Supreme Court itself on &quot;www.courtnic.nic.in&quot;, the edited versions with headnotes in the official reporter take years to compile. However, some reporters have been authorised to publish the Court&#x27;s decisions. The &quot;All India Reporter&quot; (AIR) is an old and respected reporter that, in addition to the Supreme Court, also reports decisions of the various State High Courts. Other popular reporters include &quot;Supreme Court Cases&quot;, which has become the most cited report in the Supreme Court, the &quot;Supreme Court Almanac&quot;, and &quot;Judgements Today&quot;.

&quot;Sebastian Hongray v. Union of India&quot;:
* AIR 1984 SC 571 – &quot;AIR&quot; refers to the &quot;All India Reporter&quot;, &quot;1984&quot; is the year of judgement (AIR does not use a volume-based classification), &quot;SC&quot; refers to the Supreme Court of India, and &quot;571&quot; is the first page number of the report within the volume;
* (1984) 1 SCC 339 – &quot;1984&quot; is the year of publication, &quot;1&quot; is the volume number of the reporter, &quot;SCC&quot; stands for &quot;Supreme Court Cases&quot; (the name of the reporter), and &quot;339&quot; is the first page number of the report within the volume; and
* 1984 Cri LJ 289 (SC) – &quot;1984&quot; is the year of publication, &quot;Cri LJ&quot; is an abbreviation for the &quot;Criminal Law Journal&quot; (the name of the reporter), and &quot;289&quot; is the first page number of the report within the volume. The &quot;SC&quot; in parentheses indicates that the case was heard by the Supreme Court.

A citation of the &quot;Supreme Court Almanac&quot;:
* &quot;Additional Secretary, Government of India v. Alka Subhash Gadia&quot; (1990) 2 Scale 1352

A citation in &quot;Judgements Today&quot;:
* &quot;Premium Granites v. State of Tamil Nadu&quot; JT (1994) 1 SC 374

The &quot;Supreme Court Cases (SCC)&quot; published supplementary reports for a few years in the early 1990s. Those citations looked like this:
* &quot;Federation of Mining Associations v. State of Rajasthan&quot; 1992 Supp (2) SCC 239, which points to page 239 of the Second Supplementary Volume of the SCC reports in the year 1992. From 1996 the Supplementary Volumes were numbered in sequence after the regular volumes.

The SCC also have a separate series of subject-based reporting of the decisions of the Supreme Court:
* &quot;Rathinam Nagbhushan Patnaik v. Union of India&quot; 1994 SCC (Cri) 740, which refers to the SCC Criminal Reports
* &quot;Delhi Transport Corporation v. Mazdoor Congress&quot; 1991 SCC (L&amp;S) 1213, which refers to the SCC Labour &amp; Services Reports

===National Judicial Reference System (NJRS)===

National Judicial Reference System (NJRS) is a project started by the Income-tax Department, Government of India. It has been envisaged as a tool to achieve efficiency in the tax litigation process of Income Tax Department (ITD). Within this project the Judicial Research &amp; Reference System (JRRS) – JRRS is a repository of judicial orders as a single, indexed, searchable, cross-linked, database of Judgments / orders of ITAT, Authority of Advance Ruling (AAR), HC and SC.

The Citation nomenclature followed within NJRS :
* &quot;Chandra Ranganathan &amp; Ors. v. Commissioner of Income-tax&quot; 2009-LL-1021, which refers to NJRS citations.

This Citation further allows to add the Authority where the judgment / order was pronounced.
* &quot;Chandra Ranganathan &amp; Ors. v. Commissioner of Income-tax&quot; 2009-LL-1021-SC, which refers to NJRS citations.

==New Zealand==
The standard case citation format in New Zealand is:

Several leading law reviews in New Zealand have also adopted the &quot;Australian Guide to Legal Citation&quot; (AGLC) such as the &quot;Canterbury Law Review&quot;. The AGLC style is also rather similar to citation style in New Zealand.

===Reporters===
Additionally, a number of other report series exist for specialist areas such as Family, Employment and Tax Law. 

===Neutral citation===
New Zealand courts and tribunals have begun to adopt a neutral citation standard for case law. The format provides a naming system that does not depend on the publication of the case in a law report.

The standard format looks like this:
There is a unique court identifier for each court or tribunal. These identifiers are:
Where both a neutral citation and a reporter citation exist, the neutral citation should come first e.g. &quot;R v AM&quot; [2010] NZCA 114, [2010] 2 NZLR 750

==Norway==
The Norwegian standard case citation format for published court decisions is:

:Rt. 1952 s. 989 &quot;(Telefonsjikanedommen)&quot;

where:

* Rt. identifies the report series.
** All supreme court judgments are published in Retstidende (Court Times), abbreviated Rt.
** Many judgments and decisions from lower courts are published in Rettens gang (RG).
* 1952 is the year of reporter
* s. is the Norwegian abbreviation for page. This is optional.
* 989 is the first page number of the decision in the reporter.
* Finally, one can add the popular name of the decision. It is unusual to refer to name of the plaintiff(s) and defendant(s), but often there is an unofficial name. &quot;Telefonsjikanedommen&quot; refers to a 1952 case where the Supreme Court ruled that telephone harassment (&quot;telefonsjikane&quot;) was not illegal under the current criminal code.

==Philippines==
Despite the long-standing civil law tradition in the Philippines, reliance on judicial precedents has become indispensable since the period of American rule. Supreme Court decisions are expressly recognized as part of the internal law, and are thus frequently cited in court decisions and legal pleadings. Though there is only one Supreme Court in the Philippines, the citation of its decisions varies, depending on which reporter of a case is relied on by the person citing that case.

=== Supreme Court ===

==== &quot;Philippine Reports&quot; ====
The &quot;Philippine Reports&quot; is the official reporter of decisions of the Supreme Court of the Philippines. The standard format for citation of the &quot;Philippine Reports&quot; is:

:&quot;Disini v. Secretary of Justice&quot;, 727 Phil. 28 (2014)

where:

* &quot;Disini v. Secretary of Justice&quot; is the name of the case
* &quot;727&quot; is the volume number of the &quot;Philippine Reports&quot; where the case may be found
* &quot;Phil.&quot; is the standard abbreviation of &quot;Philippine Reports&quot;
* &quot;28&quot; is the page number in the &quot;Philippine Reports&quot; that contains the beginning of the decision. If this number is followed by a comma then another page number (i.e., &quot;727 Phil. 28, 30&quot;), the latter number indicates the particular page where the annotated text can be found
* &quot;(2014)&quot; is the year the case was decided.

As of present, Philippine cases are contained in quarterly issues.

==== &quot;Supreme Court Reports Annotated&quot; ====
In the last few decades, the &quot;Philippine Reports&quot; has suffered from production problems, resulting in long delays in publication, as well as significant gaps within its published series. As a result, the privately published &quot;Supreme Court Reports Annotated&quot; (published by Central Professional Books, Inc.) has become more widely used than the &quot;Philippine Reports&quot;, even by the courts. The proper format for citation of the &quot;Supreme Court Reports Annotated&quot; is:

:&quot;Neri v. Senate&quot;, G.R. No. 180643, 25 March 2008, 549 SCRA 77

where:

* &quot;Neri v. Senate&quot; is the name of the case
* &quot;G.R. No. 180643&quot; is the case docket number originally assigned by the Supreme Court at the time the action was filed with the Court (G.R. stands for General Register)
* &quot;25 March 2008&quot; is the exact date the decision of this case was promulgated
* &quot;549&quot; is the volume number of the &quot;Supreme Court Reports Annotated&quot; where the case may be found
* &quot;SCRA&quot; is the standard abbreviation of &quot;Supreme Court Reports Annotated&quot;
* &quot;77&quot; is the page number in the &quot;Supreme Court Reports Annotated&quot; that contains the beginning of the decision. If this number is followed by a comma then another page number (i.e., &quot;549 SCRA 77, 79&quot;), the latter number indicates the particular page where the annotated text can be found

When citing cases not yet reported in the SCRA or &quot;Philippine Reports&quot;, the above citation without reference to the SCRA is preferred (i.e., &quot;Neri v. Senate&quot;, G.R. No. 180643, 25 March 2008).

===Lower court decisions===
As there are no official or unofficial reporters that regularly publish decisions of the Court of Appeals and other lower courts, citation of their decisions hews to the same format as cases not reported either in the Philippine Reports or the SCRA. Thus: (case name), (docket number), (date of promulgation of decision). For the Court of Appeals, docket numbers begin as CA-G.R. No., followed by either CR for criminal, CV for civil, and SP for the &quot;Special Cases Section&quot;.

==South Africa==
===Cape===
====Eastern Districts====
====Griqualand====
===Natal===
===Orange===
===Transvaal===
==Switzerland==
Citations vary by court and by language. Cases of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court are cited as follows:

Officially published cases are cited as &quot;BGE 133 II 292 [E. 3.2 S. 296]&quot; (German: &quot;Bundesgerichtsentscheide&quot;) or &quot;ATF 133 II 292 [consid. 3.2 p. 296]&quot; (French: &quot;arrêts du tribunal fédéral&quot;). In this example, 133 is the annual issue of the court reports, II the part indicating the division of the Court, and 292 the page on which the decision begins. Optionally, &quot;E. 3.2&quot; and &quot;S. 296&quot; are the section and page specifically cited.

Supreme Court decisions not selected for official publication are cited as &quot;Urteil [des Bundesgerichts] 5C.260/2006 vom 30. März 2007&quot; or &quot;arrêt [du Tribunal fédéral] 5C.260/2006 du 30 mars 2007&quot; respectively. In this example, 5C is the division of the Court, 260 the case number and 2006 the year in which the case was opened.

The citation style for cases of the inferior federal courts of Switzerland is similar.

==United Kingdom==

===Neutral citation===

Since 2001, judgments in the House of Lords, Privy Council, Court of Appeal and Administrative Court have been issued with neutral citations. This system was extended to other parts of the High Court in 2002. Judgments with neutral citations are freely available on the British and Irish Legal Information Institute website (www.bailii.org).
Neutral citations identify judgments independently of any series of reports, and cite only parties, year of judgment, court and case number. For example, &quot;Rottman v MPC&quot; [2002] UKHL 20 identifies the 20th judgment in 2002 in the UK House of Lords. UKHL stands for UK House of Lords. EWHC and EWCA identify the England and Wales High Court and Court of Appeal respectively. These abbreviations are generally followed by an abbreviation indicating the court or division (e.g. Admin, Ch, Crim, Pat).

===How to cite a case===

If a neutral citation is available for a judgment, it should immediately follow the party names. If the judgment has also been reported in a law reports series, follow the neutral citation with the &quot;best report&quot;, which is usually from the official Law Reports series (Appeals Cases – AC, Chancery – Ch, Family – Fam, Queen&#x27;s Bench – QB etc.).

The case of &quot;Rottman v MPC&quot; was reported in the Appeals Cases, so the citation should be:
*&quot;Rottman v MPC&quot; [2002] UKHL 20, [2002] 2 AC 692.

This means that a report of the case and the judgment can be found in the 2002 volumes, vol 2, of the Law Reports series called Appeals Cases, beginning at page 692.

To cite a particular paragraph from the judgment, add the paragraph number in square brackets at the end of the citation:
*&quot;Rottman v MPC&quot; [2002] UKHL 20, [2002] 2 AC 692 [58].

If a case is not reported in the Law Reports, the next best report is the Weekly Law Reports (e.g. [2002] 2 WLR 1315), and then the All England Reports (e.g., [2002] 2 All ER 865). In some situations, it might be preferable to cite a specialist series, e.g., &quot;Rottman v MPC&quot; was also cited in the Human Rights Law Reports, at [2002] HRLR 32.

For cases before 2001, cite the best report. If referring to a particular page of the judgment, give that page number after the page number on which the report begins. The following citation refers to page 573 of the &quot;Donoghue v Stevenson&quot; judgment:

*&quot;Donoghue v Stevenson&quot; [1932] AC 562, 573.
*See Oxford Standard for the Citation of Legal Authorities

===England and Wales===
The standard case citation format in England and Wales is:

In England and Wales as with certain Commonwealth countries, the abbreviation &quot;R&quot; for &quot;rex&quot; (king) or &quot;regina&quot; (queen), is used for cases in which the state is a party (typically criminal cases or judicial review cases). If the Attorney General for England and Wales or the Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales) prosecute the case, the abbreviation &quot;AG&quot; or &quot;DPP&quot; will be used instead of &quot;R&quot;

Square brackets &quot;[ ]&quot; are used when the year is essential to locating the report (e.g., the official law reports either—as with &quot;Donoghue v Stevenson&quot;, above—do not have volume numbers or, if there are multiple volumes in a single year, they are numbered 1, 2, etc.). Round brackets &quot;( )&quot; are used when the year is not essential but is useful for information purposes, e.g., in reports that have a cumulative volume number such as &quot;R v Dudley and Stephens&quot;, above.

===Law reports===
The term &quot;reporter&quot;, meaning a law report or a series of them, is not widely used in England and Wales. Before 1865, English courts used a large number of privately printed reports, and cases were cited based on which report they appeared in. (This system was also used in the United States and other common law jurisdictions during that period.)

Two main unofficial law reports report all areas of law: the &quot;Weekly Law Reports&quot; (WLR) and the &quot;All England Reports&quot; (All ER). In addition, a number of unofficial specialist law reports focus on particular areas, e.g., &quot;Entertainment and Media Law Reports&quot; (EMLR) or the &quot;Criminal Appeal Reports&quot; (Cr App R).

For the citation of &quot;The Law Reports&quot; of the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting, see Law Reports. These have been published since 1865. They have always been split into a number of different series, the current series being the Appeal Cases (AC), Chancery (Ch), Family (Fam), and Queen&#x27;s Bench (QB) (or King&#x27;s Bench—KB—depending on the monarch of the time). These four series are cited in preference to all others in court.

The table below is an incomplete list of law reports other than &quot;The Law Reports&quot;, nominate reports and reprints.

The table below is a list of series that are reprints of earlier reports.

For nominate reports, see Nominate reports.

===Scotland===
The standard case citation formats in Scotland are:
The Supreme Court has issued a practice note on the use of neutral citation. The &quot;Scots Law Times&quot; is cited as &quot;SLT&quot;.

==United States==
The standard case citation format in the United States is:
:&quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, 410 U.S. 113 (1973)
where:
*&quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; is the abbreviated name of the case. Generally, the first name (here, &quot;Roe&quot;) is the surname of the plaintiff, who is the party who filed the suit for an original case, or the appellant, the party appealing in a case being appealed from a lower court, or the petitioner when litigating in the high court of a jurisdiction; and the second name (here, &quot;Wade&quot;) is the surname of the defendant, the party responding to the suit, or the appellee, the party responding to the appeal, or the respondent, when defending in the high court of the jurisdiction. Litigants are generally referred to by their last name (when they are natural persons), and a case is generally referred to by the first named litigant on each side of the case. In this example, &quot;Roe&quot; refers to &quot;Jane Roe,&quot; a pseudonym commonly used when it is appropriate to keep the identity of a litigant out of the public spotlight, and &quot;Wade&quot; refers to Henry Wade, the Dallas County District Attorney at the time.
*410 is the volume number of the &quot;reporter&quot; that reported the Court&#x27;s written opinion in the case titled &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;.
*U.S. is the abbreviation of the reporter, or printed book of court opinions. Here, &quot;U.S.&quot; stands for &quot;United States Reports&quot;.
*113 is the page number (in volume 410 of &quot;United States Reports&quot;) where the opinion begins.
*1973 is the year when the court rendered its decision.
*The abbreviated name of the court is included inside the parenthesis before the year if the name of the court is not obvious from the reporter. This rule comes into play because certain reporters, such as members of the West National Reporter System, publish opinions originating from multiple courts. In this example, the name of the court (United States Supreme Court) is obvious (since only decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court are published in &quot;United States Reports&quot;) and is thus omitted as a matter of convention.

Case citations are used to find a particular case, both when looking up a case in a printed reporter and when accessing it via the Internet or services such as LexisNexis or Westlaw.

This format also allows different cases with the same parties to be easily differentiated. For example, looking for the U.S. Supreme Court case of &quot;Miller v. California&quot; would yield four cases, some involving different people named Miller, and each involving different issues.

===Supreme Court of the United States===
Cases from the Supreme Court of the United States are officially printed in the &quot;United States Reports&quot;. A citation to the &quot;United States Reports&quot; looks like this:

*&quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, 347 U.S. 483 (1954).
*&quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot;, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).

Many court decisions are published in more than one reporter. A citation to two or more reporters for a given court decision is called a &quot;parallel citation&quot;. For U.S. Supreme Court decisions, there are several unofficial reporters, including the &quot;Supreme Court Reporter&quot; (abbreviated S. Ct.) and &quot;United States Supreme Court Reports, Lawyers&#x27; Edition&quot; (commonly known simply as &quot;Lawyers&#x27; Edition&quot;) (abbreviated L. Ed.), which are printed by private companies and provide further annotations to the opinions of the Court. Although a citation to the latter two is not required, some attorneys and legal writers prefer to cite all three case reporters at once:

*&quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot;, 381 U.S. 479, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1965)

The &quot;2d&quot; after the L. Ed. signifies the second series of the &quot;Lawyers&#x27; Edition&quot;. United States case reporters are sequentially numbered, but the volume number is never higher than 999. When the 1,000th volume is reached (the threshold in earlier years was lower), the volume number is reset to 1 and a &quot;2d&quot; is appended after the reporter&#x27;s abbreviation. Some case reporters are in their third series, and a few are approaching their fourth.

Some very old Supreme Court cases have odd-looking citations, such as &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot;, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803). The &quot;(1 Cranch)&quot; refers to the fact that, before there was a reporter series known as the &quot;United States Reports&quot; compiled by the Supreme Court&#x27;s Reporter of Decisions, cases were gathered, bound together, and sold privately by the Court&#x27;s Reporter of Decisions. In this example, &quot;Marbury&quot; was first reported in an edition by William Cranch, who was responsible for publishing Supreme Court reports from 1801 to 1815. Such reports, named for the individual who gathered them and hence called &quot;nominative reports&quot;, existed from 1790 to 1874. Beginning in 1874, the U.S. government created the &quot;United States Reports&quot;, and at the same time simultaneously numbered the volumes previously published privately as part of a single series and began numbering sequentially from that point. In this way, &quot;5 U.S. (1 Cranch)&quot; means that it is the 5th overall volume of the &quot;United States Reports&quot; series, but the first that was originally published by William Cranch; four volumes of opinions prior to that were (for example) published by Alexander Dallas (for example, &quot;4 U.S. (4 Dall.)&quot;), and after Cranch&#x27;s 9 volumes, 12 more were published by Henry Wheaton (e.g., &quot;15 U.S. (2 Wheat.)&quot;). See the Supreme Court of the United States Reporter of Decisions for other edition names. The name of the reporter of decisions has not been used in citations since the U.S. government began printing the &quot;United States Reports&quot;.

When a case has been decided, but not yet published in the case reporter, the citation may note the volume but leave blank the page of the case reporter until it is determined. For example, &quot;Golan v. Holder,&quot; 565 U.S. 302 (2012) was properly cited as &quot;Golan v. Holder&quot;, before publication.

In the caption of a Supreme Court case, the first name listed is the name of the petitioning (appealing) party, followed by the party responding (respondent) to the appeal. In most cases, the appealing party was the losing party in the prior court. This is no longer the practice used in cases in the federal courts of appeal, in which the original alignment of parties from the lower court is preserved.

===Lower federal courts===

United States court of appeals cases are published in the &quot;Federal Reporter&quot; (F., F.2d, or F.3d). United States district court cases and cases from some specialized courts are published in the &quot;Federal Supplement&quot; (F. Supp., F. Supp. 2d, or F. Supp. 3d). Both series are published by Thomson West; they are technically unofficial reporters, but have become widely accepted as the &quot;de facto&quot; &quot;official&quot; reporters of the lower federal courts because of the absence of a true official reporter. (Of the federal appeals and district courts, only one, the D.C. Circuit, has an official reporter, &quot;United States Court of Appeals Reports&quot;, and even that one is rarely used today.)

When lower federal court opinions are cited, the citation includes the name of the court. This is placed in the parentheses immediately before the year. Some examples:

*&quot;Geary v. Visitation of Blessed Virgin Mary School&quot;, 7 F.3d 324 (3d Cir. 1993) – a 1993 case in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit
*&quot;Glassroth v. Moore&quot;, 229 F. Supp. 2d 1290 (M.D. Ala. 2002) – a 2002 case in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama

U.S. circuit and district court cases from 1789 to 1880 were reported in Federal Cases, abbreviated F. Cas. An example of the citation form is: &quot;Wheaton v. Peters&quot;, 29 F. Cas. 862 (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1832) (No. 17,486).

===State courts===
State court decisions are published in several places. Many states have their own official state reporters, which publish decisions of one or more of that state&#x27;s courts. Reporters that publish decisions of a state&#x27;s highest court are abbreviated using the traditional abbreviation for the state&#x27;s name (i.e., not the postal abbreviation), regardless of what the actual title of the reporter is. Thus, the official reporter of decisions of the California Supreme Court (titled &quot;California Reports&quot;) is abbreviated &quot;Cal.&quot; (or, for subsequent series, &quot;Cal. 2d,&quot; &quot;Cal. 3d&quot;, or &quot;Cal. 4th&quot;).

*&quot;Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co.&quot;, 248 N.Y. 339 (1928), a case in the New York Court of Appeals, reported in &quot;New York Reports&quot;. Note that the New York Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York. Because the &quot;New York Reports&quot; only report opinions of the New York Court of Appeals, there is no need to repeat the court designation before the year.
*&quot;Green v. Chicago Tribune Company&quot;, 286 Ill. App. 3d 1 (1996) – a case in the Illinois Appellate Court, reported in &quot;Illinois Appellate Court Reports&quot;. Note that, in contrast to New York, the Illinois Appellate Court is only the intermediate court of appeals in Illinois; decisions of the Illinois Supreme Court are reported in &quot;Illinois Reports&quot;, abbreviated &quot;Ill.&quot; (or &quot;Ill. 2d&quot;). Because the &quot;Illinois Appellate Court Reports&quot; are dedicated solely to reporting decisions of the Illinois Appellate Court, there is no need to repeat the court designation before the year.
*&quot;Harte v. Hand&quot;, 438 N.J. Super. 545 (Ch. Div. 2014). Note that although all published opinions of the New Jersey Superior Court are published in the &quot;New Jersey Superior Court Reports&quot;, the organization of the Superior Court into three divisions (the Law Division, the Chancery Division, and the Appellate Division) means the citation must specify which division issued the opinion. This is especially salient as the Appellate Division hears appeals from the Law and Chancery Divisions, as occurred with the example case (a rehearing on remand of &quot;Harte v. Hand&quot;, 433 N.J. Super. 457 (App. Div. 2013)).
In addition to the official reporters, Thomson West publishes several series of &quot;regional reporters&quot; that cover several states each. These are the &quot;North Eastern Reporter&quot;, &quot;Atlantic Reporter&quot;, &quot;South Eastern Reporter&quot;, &quot;Southern Reporter&quot;, &quot;South Western Reporter&quot;, &quot;North Western Reporter&quot;, and &quot;Pacific Reporter&quot;. California, Illinois, and New York also each have their own line of Thomson West reporters, because of the large volume of cases generated in those states (titled, respectively, &quot;West&#x27;s California Reporter&quot;, &quot;Illinois Decisions&quot;, and &quot;West&#x27;s New York Supplement&quot;). Some smaller states (like South Dakota) have stopped publishing their own official reporters, and instead have certified the appropriate West regional reporter as their &quot;official&quot; reporter.

Here are some examples of how to cite West reporters:

*&quot;Jackson v. Commonwealth&quot;, 583 S.E.2d 780 (Va. Ct. App. 2003) – a case in the Virginia Court of Appeals (an intermediate appellate court) published in the &quot;South Eastern Reporter&quot;&#x27;s 2nd series
*&quot;Foxworth v. Maddox&quot;, 137 So. 161 (Fla. 1931) – a case in the Florida Supreme Court published in the &quot;Southern Reporter&quot;
*&quot;People v. Brown&quot;, 282 N.Y.S.2d 497 (N.Y. 1967) – a case in the New York Court of Appeals (New York&#x27;s highest court) published in &quot;West&#x27;s New York Supplement&quot;&#x27;s 2nd series. The case also appears in West&#x27;s regional reporter: &quot;People v. Brown&quot;, 229 N.E.2d 192 (N.Y. 1967). Note, in both forms, that &quot;N.Y.&quot; is placed in the parenthetical, because both &quot;West&#x27;s New York Supplement&quot; and the &quot;North Eastern Reporter&quot; report the opinions of more courts than only the New York Court of Appeals. A citation to the officially published reports, &quot;People v. Brown&quot;, 20 N.Y.2d 238 (1967), however, does not require the court name in the parenthetical, because the official &quot;New York Reports&quot; only report opinions of the New York Court of Appeals.

Abbreviations for lower courts vary by state, as each state has its own system of trial courts and intermediate appellate courts. When a case appears in both an official reporter and a regional reporter, either citation can be used. Generally, citing to the regional reporter is preferred, since out-of-state attorneys are more likely to have access to these. Many lawyers prefer to include both citations. Some state courts require that parallel citations (in this case, citing to both the official reporter and an unofficial regional reporter) be used when citing cases from any court in that state&#x27;s system.

Like the United States Supreme Court, some very old state case citations include an abbreviation of the name of either the private publisher or the reporter of decisions, a state-appointed officer who originally collected and published the cases. For example, in &quot;Hall v. Bell&quot;, 47 Mass. (6 Met.) 431 (1843), the citation is to volume 47 of &quot;Massachusetts Reports&quot;, which, like &quot;United States Reports&quot;, was started in the latter half of the 19th century and incorporated into the series a number of prior editions originally published privately, and began numbering from that point; &quot;6 Met.&quot; refers to the 6th volume that had originally been published privately by Theron Metcalf. An example of a case cited to a reporter that has not been subsequently incorporated into an officially published series is &quot;Pierson v. Post&quot;, 3 Cai. 175 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1804), reported in volume 3 of &quot;Caines&#x27; Reports&quot;, page 175, named for George Caines, who had been appointed to report New York cases; the case was before the New York Supreme Court of Judicature (now defunct). Most states gave up this practice in the mid-to-late 19th century, but Delaware persisted until 1920.

Some states, notably California and New York, have their own citation systems that differ significantly from the various federal and national standards. In California, the year is placed &quot;between&quot; the names of the parties and the reference to the case reporter; in New York, the year is wrapped in brackets instead of parentheses, while California uses brackets for parenthetical explanations of a case&#x27;s holding or relevance. Both New York and California styles wrap an entire citation in parentheses when used as a stand-alone sentence to support the preceding sentence, although New York places the terminating period outside the parentheses, whereas California places it inside. New York wraps just the reporter and page references in parentheses when the citation is used as a clause. 

Either way, both state styles differ from the national/Bluebook style of simply dropping in the citation as a separate sentence without further adornment. Both systems use less punctuation and spacing in their reporter abbreviations.

For example, assuming that it is being placed as a stand-alone sentence, the &quot;Brown&quot; case above would be cited (using the official reporter) to a New York court as:

*(&quot;People v. Brown&quot;, 20 NY2d 238 [1967]).

And, again, as a stand-alone sentence, the famous &quot;Greenman&quot; product liability case would be cited to a California court as:

*(&quot;Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc.&quot; (1963) 59 Cal.2d 57.)

===Unpublished decisions===

A growing number of court decisions are not published in case reporters. For example, only 7% of the opinions of the California intermediate courts (the Courts of Appeal) are published each year. This is mainly because judges certify only significant decisions for publication, due to the massive number of frivolous appeals flowing through the courts and the importance of avoiding information overload.

It is also argued that this is in part because in many states, especially California, the legislature has failed to expand the judiciary to keep up with population growth (for various political and fiscal reasons). To deal with their crushing caseloads, many judges prefer to write shorter-than-normal opinions that dispose of minor issues in the case in a sentence or two. They avoid publishing such abbreviated opinions, however, so as not to risk creating bad precedents. 

Attorneys have several options in citing &quot;unpublished&quot; decisions:
* For cases that have not been published or put in an electronic database, or very recently decided cases that have not &quot;yet&quot; been published or put in an electronic database, a citation to the case&#x27;s docket number before the court that decided it is required.
**&quot;Groucho Marx Prods. v. Playboy Enters.&quot;, No. 77 Civ. 1782 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 30, 1977) – a decision of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York; the docket number and specific date allow a researcher to track down the printed copy maintained by the court if needed (legal citation forms strongly prefer citations to traditional printed resources).
* Even though only some decisions of the U.S. Courts of Appeal are considered &quot;published&quot; (those appearing in &quot;Federal Reporter&quot;), Thomson West has recently started making available all decisions officially considered &quot;unpublished&quot; in a separate publication called &quot;Federal Appendix&quot; (abbreviated &quot;F. App&#x27;x&quot;).
* Cases intentionally left officially unpublished are nonetheless often &quot;published&quot; on computer services, such as LexisNexis and Westlaw. These services have their own citation formats based on the year of the case, an abbreviation indicating the computer service (or a specific database of that computer service), and an identification number; citations to online databases also usually include the case&#x27;s docket number and the specific date when it was decided (due to the preference for citation to traditional printed resources). Examples include:
**&quot;Fuqua Homes, Inc. v. Beattie&quot;, No. 03-3587, 2004 WL 2495842 (8th Cir. Nov. 8, 2004) – a case found on the Westlaw electronic database, decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit; the citation includes the case&#x27;s original docket number (No. 03-3587), and a citation to the electronic database that indicates the date of decision, the database (WL for Westlaw) and a unique serial number in that database (2495842).
**&quot;Chavez v. Metro. Dist. Comm&#x27;n&quot;, No. 3:02CV458(MRK), 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11266 (D. Conn. June 1, 2004) – a case decided by the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut; the citation includes the case&#x27;s original docket number (No. 3:02CV458(MRK)), the date of decision, the database (U.S. Dist. LEXIS, indicating the LexisNexis database for U.S. District Court cases), and a unique serial number in that database (11266).

Some court systems—such as the California state court system—forbid attorneys to cite unpublished cases as precedent. Other systems allow citation of unpublished cases only under specific circumstances. For example, in Kentucky, unpublished cases from that state&#x27;s courts can only be cited if the case was decided after January 1, 2003, and &quot;there is no published opinion that would adequately address the issue before the court&quot;. From 2004 to 2006, federal judges debated whether the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure (FRAP) should be amended so that unpublished cases in all circuits could be cited as precedent. In 2006, the Supreme Court, over the objection of several hundred judges and lawyers, adopted a new Rule 32.1 of FRAP requiring that federal courts allow citation of unpublished cases. The rule took effect on January 1, 2007.

===Vendor-neutral citations===
With the rise of the web, many courts placed new cases on websites. Some were published while others never lost their &quot;unpublished&quot; status. The major legal citation systems required cites to the officially published page numbers, in which publishers such as West Publishing claimed a copyright interest.

A vendor-neutral citation movement led to provisions being made for citations to web-based cases and other legal materials. A few courts modified their rules to specifically take into account cases &quot;published&quot; on the web.

An example of a vendor-neutral citation:
*&quot;Equal. Found. of Greater Cincinnati, Inc. v. City of Cincinnati&quot;, 1997 FED App. 0318P (6th Cir.) – a 1997 case decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit; the citation to the numbering system adopted by the court (&quot;1997 FED App. 0318P&quot;) eliminates the need to cite to a specific vendor&#x27;s product, in this case Thomson West&#x27;s &quot;Federal Reporter&quot; (i.e., 128 F.3d 289).

===Pinpoint citations===
In practice, most lawyers go one step farther, once they have developed the correct citation for a case using the rules discussed above. Most court opinions contain holdings on multiple issues, so lawyers need to cite to the page that contains the specific holding they wish to invoke in their own case. Such citations are known as pinpoint citations, &quot;pin cites&quot;, or &quot;jump cites&quot;.

For example, in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the word &quot;person&quot; as used in the Fourteenth Amendment does not include the unborn. That particular holding appears on page 158 of the volume in which the &quot;Roe&quot; decision was published. A full pin cite to &quot;Roe&quot; for that holding would be as follows:

* &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, 410 U.S. 113, 158 (1973).

And a parallel cite to all three U.S. Supreme Court reporters, combined with pin cites for all three, would produce:

* &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, 410 U.S. 113, 158, 93 S. Ct. 705, 729, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147, 180 (1973).

But in its opinions, the Court usually provides a direct pin cite only to the official reporter. The two unofficial reporters, when they reprint the Court&#x27;s opinions, add on parallel cites to each other, but do not add pin cites. Therefore, a citation to &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; in a later Supreme Court decision as viewed on Lexis or Westlaw would appear as follows:

* &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, 410 U.S. 113, 158, 93 S. Ct. 705, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1973).

Even then, such citations are still quite lengthy, and may look quite mysterious and intimidating to laypersons when they read court opinions. Since the 1980s, there has been an ongoing debate among American judges as to whether they should relegate such lengthy citations to footnotes to improve the readability of their opinions, as strongly urged by Bryan A. Garner, one of the leading authors on legal writing and style. Most judges do relegate &quot;some&quot; citations to footnotes, but jurists such as Justice Stephen Breyer and Judge Richard Posner refuse to use footnotes in their opinions.

===Types of citations===
There are two types of citations: proprietary and public domain citations. There are many citation guides; the most commonly acknowledged is called &quot;The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation&quot;, compiled by the &quot;Columbia Law Review&quot;, &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot;, &quot;University of Pennsylvania Law Review&quot;, and &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;. &quot;Public domain citations&quot; refer to the official reporters, rather than a publication service such as Westlaw, LexisNexis, particular legal journals, or specialization-specific reporters. States with their own unique style for court documents and case opinions also publish their own style guides, which include information on their citation rules.

<doc id="404773" wikidata="Q168620" url="?curid=404773" title="Trefoil knot">
<text>In knot theory, a branch of mathematics, the trefoil knot is the simplest example of a nontrivial knot. The trefoil can be obtained by joining the two loose ends of a common overhand knot, resulting in a knotted loop. As the simplest knot, the trefoil is fundamental to the study of mathematical knot theory.

The trefoil knot is named after the three-leaf clover (or trefoil) plant.

== Descriptions ==
The trefoil knot can be defined as the curve obtained from the following parametric equations:
:formula_1

The (2,3)-torus knot is also a trefoil knot. The following parametric equations give a (2,3)-torus knot lying on torus formula_2:
:formula_3


Any continuous deformation of the curve above is also considered a trefoil knot. Specifically, any curve isotopic to a trefoil knot is also considered to be a trefoil. In addition, the mirror image of a trefoil knot is also considered to be a trefoil. In topology and knot theory, the trefoil is usually defined using a knot diagram instead of an explicit parametric equation.

In algebraic geometry, the trefoil can also be obtained as the intersection in C2 of the unit 3-sphere &quot;S&quot;3 with the complex plane curve of zeroes of the complex polynomial &quot;z&quot;2 + &quot;w&quot;3 (a cuspidal cubic).

If one end of a tape or belt is turned over three times and then pasted to the other, the edge forms a trefoil knot.

== Symmetry ==
The trefoil knot is chiral, in the sense that a trefoil knot can be distinguished from its own mirror image. The two resulting variants are known as the left-handed trefoil and the right-handed trefoil. It is not possible to deform a left-handed trefoil continuously into a right-handed trefoil, or vice versa. (That is, the two trefoils are not ambient isotopic.)

Though chiral, the trefoil knot is also invertible, meaning that there is no distinction between a counterclockwise-oriented and a clockwise-oriented trefoil. That is, the chirality of a trefoil depends only on the over and under crossings, not the orientation of the curve.

But the knot has rotational symmetry. The axis is about a line perpendicular to the page for the 3-coloured image.

== Nontriviality ==
The trefoil knot is nontrivial, meaning that it is not possible to &quot;untie&quot; a trefoil knot in three dimensions without cutting it. Mathematically, this means that a trefoil knot is not isotopic to the unknot. In particular, there is no sequence of Reidemeister moves that will untie a trefoil.

Proving this requires the construction of a knot invariant that distinguishes the trefoil from the unknot. The simplest such invariant is tricolorability: the trefoil is tricolorable, but the unknot is not. In addition, virtually every major knot polynomial distinguishes the trefoil from an unknot, as do most other strong knot invariants.

== Classification ==
In knot theory, the trefoil is the first nontrivial knot, and is the only knot with crossing number three. It is a prime knot, and is listed as 31 in the Alexander-Briggs notation. The Dowker notation for the trefoil is 4 6 2, and the Conway notation is [3].

The trefoil can be described as the (2,3)-torus knot. It is also the knot obtained by closing the braid σ13.

The trefoil is an alternating knot. However, it is not a slice knot, meaning it does not bound a smooth 2-dimensional disk in the 4-dimensional ball; one way to prove this is to note that its signature is not zero. Another proof is that its Alexander polynomial does not satisfy the Fox-Milnor condition.

The trefoil is a fibered knot, meaning that its complement in formula_4 is a fiber bundle over the circle formula_5. The trefoil K may be viewed as the set of pairs formula_6 of complex numbers such that formula_7 and formula_8. Then this fiber bundle has the Milnor map formula_9 as the fibre bundle projection of the knot complement formula_10 to the circle formula_5. The fibre is a once-punctured torus. Since the knot complement is also a Seifert fibred with boundary, it has a horizontal incompressible surface—this is also the fiber of the Milnor map. (This assumes the knot has been thickened to become a solid torus Nε(K), and that the interior of this solid torus has been removed to create a compact knot complement formula_12.)

== Invariants ==

The Alexander polynomial of the trefoil knot is
formula_13
and the Conway polynomial is
formula_14
The Jones polynomial is
formula_15
and the Kauffman polynomial of the trefoil is
formula_16
The HOMFLY polynomial of the trefoil is
formula_17
The knot group of the trefoil is given by the presentation
formula_18
or equivalently
formula_19
This group is isomorphic to the braid group with three strands.

As the simplest nontrivial knot, the trefoil is a common motif in iconography and the visual arts. For example, the common form of the triquetra symbol is a trefoil, as are some versions of the Germanic Valknut.
In modern art, the woodcut &quot;Knots&quot; by M. C. Escher depicts three trefoil knots whose solid forms are twisted in different ways.

<doc id="404782" wikidata="Q486080" url="?curid=404782" title="Prophet's Mosque">
<text>The Prophet&#x27;s Mosque () is the second mosque built by the Islamic prophet Muhammad in Medina, after the Quba Mosque, as well as the second largest mosque and holiest site in Islam, after the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, in the Saudi region of the Hejaz. The mosque is located at the heart of Medina, and is a major site of pilgrimage that falls under the purview of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.

Muhammad himself was involved in the construction of the mosque. At the time, the mosque&#x27;s land belonged to two young orphans, Sahl and Suhayl, and when they learned that Muhammad wished to acquire their land to erect a mosque, they went to Muhammad and offered the land to him as a gift; Muhammad insisted on paying a price for the land because they were orphaned children. The price agreed upon was paid by Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, who thus became the endower or donor () of the mosque, on behalf or in favor of Muhammad. al-Ansari also accommodated Muhammad upon his arrival at Medina in 622.

Originally an open-air building, the mosque served as a community center, a court of law, and a religious school. It contained a raised platform or pulpit (&quot;minbar&quot;) for the people who taught the Quran and for Muhammad to give the Friday sermon (&quot;khutbah&quot;). Subsequent Islamic rulers greatly expanded and decorated the mosque, naming its walls, doors and minarets after themselves and their forefathers. After an expansion during the reign of the Umayyad caliph al-Walid I (), it now incorporates the final resting place of Muhammad and the first two Rashidun caliphs Abu Bakr () and Umar (). One of the most notable features of the site is the Green Dome in the south-east corner of the mosque, originally Aisha&#x27;s house, where the tomb of Muhammad is located. Many pilgrims who perform the Hajj also go to Medina to visit the Green Dome.

In 1909, under the reign of Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II, it became the first place in the Arabian Peninsula to be provided with electrical lights. From the 14th century, the mosque was guarded by eunuchs, the last remaining guardians were photographed at the request of then-Prince Faisal bin Salman Al Saud, and in 2015, only five were left. It is generally open regardless of date or time, and has only been closed to visitors once in modern times, as Ramadan approached during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

== History ==

=== Under Muhammad and the Rashidun (622–660 AD) ===
The mosque was built by Muhammad in 622 AD after his arrival in Medina. Riding a camel called Qaswa, he arrived at the place where this mosque was built, which was being used as a burial ground. Refusing to accept the land as a gift from the two orphans, Sahl and Suhayl, who owned the land, he bought the land which was paid for by Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, and it took seven months to complete the construction of the mosque. It measured . The roof which was supported by palm trunks was made of beaten clay and palm leaves. It was at a height of . The three doors of the mosque were the &quot;Bāb ar-Raḥmah&quot; (, &quot;Gate of the Mercy&quot;) to the south, &quot;Bāb Jibrīl&quot; (, &quot;Gate of Gabriel&quot;) to the west, and &quot;Bāb an-Nisāʾ&quot; (, &quot;Gate of the Women&quot;) to the east. At this time point in the history of the mosque, the wall of the &quot;qiblah&quot; was facing north to Jerusalem, and the Suffah was along the northern wall. In the year 7 AH, after the Battle of Khaybar, the mosque was expanded to on each side, and three rows of columns were built beside the west wall, which became the place of praying. The mosque remained unaltered during the reign of Abu Bakr.

Umar demolished all the houses around the mosque, except those of Muhammad&#x27;s wives, to expand it. The new mosque&#x27;s dimensions became . Sun-dried mud bricks were used to construct the walls of the enclosure. Besides strewing pebbles on the floor, the roof&#x27;s height was increased to . Umar constructed three more gates for entrance. He also added &quot;Al-Buṭayḥah&quot; () for people to recite poetry.

The third Rashidun caliph Uthman demolished the mosque in 649. Ten months were spent in building the new rectangular shaped mosque whose face was turned towards the Kaaba in Mecca. The new mosque measured . The number of gates as well as their names remained the same. The enclosure was made of stones laid in mortar. The palm trunk columns were replaced by stone columns which were joined by iron clamps. Teakwood was used in reconstructing the ceiling filza.

=== Under subsequent Islamic states (660–1517) ===
In 706 or 707, the Umayyad caliph al-Walid I () instructed his governor of Medina, the future caliph Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz, to significantly enlarge the mosque. According to the architectural historian Robert Hillenbrand, the building of a large scale mosque in Medina, the original center of the caliphate, was an &quot;acknowledgement&quot; by al-Walid of &quot;his own roots and those of Islam itself&quot; and possibly an attempt to appease Medinan resentment at the loss of the city&#x27;s political importance to Syria under the Umayyads.

It took three years for the work to be completed. Raw materials were procured from the Byzantine Empire. Al-Walid lavished large sums for the mosque&#x27;s reconstruction and supplied mosaics and Greek and Coptic craftsmen. The area of the mosque was increased from the area of Uthman&#x27;s time, to . Its redevelopment entailed the demolition of the living quarters of Muhammad&#x27;s wives and the expansion of the structure to incorporate the graves of Muhammad, Abu Bakr and Umar. The vocal opposition to the demolition of Muhammad&#x27;s home from local religious circles was dismissed by al-Walid. A wall was built to segregate the mosque and the houses of the wives of Muhammad. The mosque was reconstructed in a trapezoid shape with the length of the longer side being . For the first time, porticoes were built in the mosque connecting the northern part of the structure to the sanctuary.

According to the 10th-century writer Ibn Rusta, minarets were also built for the first time during al-Walid&#x27;s expansion as four towers were added to the mosque&#x27;s corners. They may be the first minarets in Islamic architecture, though it is not clear exactly what purpose these towers served in this early period. At the time of Ibn Rusta&#x27;s writing, only one of the original four towers remained standing. The southwest minaret was demolished in 716 on the orders of Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik.

The Abbasid caliph al-Mahdi () extended the mosque to the north by . His name was also inscribed on the walls of the mosque. He also planned to remove six steps to the &quot;minbar&quot;, but abandoned this idea, fearing damage to the wooden platforms on which they were built. The project required the demolition of the two northern minarets of al-Walid&#x27;s time but they were replaced by two new towers at the northern corners of the new expansion. According to an inscription of Ibn Qutaybah, the caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun () did &quot;unspecified work&quot; on the mosque. Al-Mutawakkil () lined the enclosure of Muhammad&#x27;s tomb with marble.

In 1269, the Mamluk sultan Baybars sent dozens of artisans led by the eunuch Emir Jamal al-Din Muhsin al-Salihi to rebuild the sanctuary, including enclosures around the tombs of Muhammad and of Fatima. The Mamluk sultan al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghuri () built a dome of stone over his grave in 1476.

=== Ottoman period (1517–1805 and 1840–1919) ===

Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent (r. 1520–1566) rebuilt the east and west walls of the mosque, and added the northeastern minaret known as &quot;Süleymaniyye&quot;. He added a new altar called Ahnaf next to Muhammad&#x27;s altar, Shafi&#x27;iyya, and placed a new steel-covered dome on the tomb of Muhammad. Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent wrote the names of the Ottoman sultans from Osman Ghazi to himself (Kanuni) and revived the &quot;Gate of Mercy&quot; (&quot;Bab ur-Rahme&quot;) or the west gate. The pulpit that is used today was built under Sultan Murad III (r. 1574–1595).

In 1817, Sultan Mahmud II (r. 1808–1839) completed the construction of &quot;the Purified Residence&quot; (&quot;Ar-Rawdah Al-Muṭahharah&quot; () in Arabic, and &quot;Ravza-i Mutahhara&quot; in Turkish) on the southeast side of the mosque, and covered with a new dome. The dome was painted green in 1837, and has been known as the &quot;Green Dome&quot; (&quot;Kubbe-i Khadra&quot;) ever since. Sultan Mahmud II&#x27;s successor, Sultan Abdulmecid I (), took thirteen years to rebuild the mosque, beginning in 1849. Red stone bricks were used as the main material in reconstruction of the mosque. The floor area of the mosque was increased by .

The entire mosque was reorganized except for the tomb of Muhammad, the three altars, the pulpit and the Suleymaniye minaret. On the walls, verses from the Quran were inscribed in Islamic calligraphy. On the northern side of the mosque, a &quot;madrasah&quot; was built for teaching the Qur&#x27;an. An ablution site was added to the north side. The prayer place on the south side was doubled in width, and covered with small domes. The interiors of the domes were decorated with verses from the Qur&#x27;an and couplets from the poem &quot;Kaside-i Bürde&quot;. The &quot;qibli&quot; wall was covered with polished tiles with lines inscribed from the Qur&#x27;an. The places of prayer and courtyard were paved with marble and red stone. The fifth minaret, &quot;Mecidiyye&quot;, was built to the west of the surrounded area. Following the &quot;Desert Tiger&quot; Fakhri Pasha&#x27;s arrest by his own officers having resisted for 72 days after the end of the Siege of Medina on 10 January 1919, 550 years of Ottoman rule in the region came to an end.

==== Saudi insurgency (1805–1811) ====
When Saud bin Abdul-Aziz took Medina in 1805, his followers, the Wahhabis, demolished nearly every tomb and dome in Medina to prevent their veneration, except the Green Dome. As per the sahih hadiths, they considered the veneration of tombs and places, which were thought to possess supernatural powers, as an offence against &quot;tawhid&quot;, and an act of &quot;shirk&quot;. Muhammad&#x27;s tomb was stripped of its gold and jewel ornaments, but the dome was preserved either because of an unsuccessful attempt to demolish its complex and hardened structure, or because some time ago, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, founder of the Wahhabi movement, wrote that he did not wish to see the dome destroyed.

=== Saudi rule and modern history (1925–present) ===
The Saudi takeover was characterized by events similar to those that took place in 1805, when the Prince Mohammed ibn Abdulaziz retook the city on 5 December 1925. After the foundation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932, the mosque underwent several major modifications. In 1951, King Abdulaziz (1932–1953) ordered demolitions around the mosque to make way for new wings to the east and west of the prayer hall, which consisted of concrete columns with pointed arches. Older columns were reinforced with concrete and braced with copper rings at the top. The &quot;Suleymaniyya&quot; and &quot;Mecidiyye&quot; minarets were replaced with two minarets in Mamluk revival style. Two additional minarets were erected to the northeast and northwest of the mosque. A library was built along the western wall to house historic Qurans and other religious texts.

In 1974, King Faisal added to the mosque. The area of the mosque was also expanded during the reign of King Fahd in 1985. Bulldozers were used to demolish buildings around the mosque. In 1992, when it was completed, the mosque took over of space. Escalators and 27 courtyards were among the additions to the mosque. A$6 billion project to increase the area of the mosque was announced in September 2012. After completion, the mosque should accommodate between 1.6 million to 2 million worshippers. In March of the following year, the &quot;Saudi Gazette&quot; reported that demolition work had been mostly complete, including the demolition of ten hotels on the eastern side, in addition to houses and other utilities.

== Architecture ==
The modern-day mosque is situated on a rectangular plot and is two stories tall. The Ottoman prayer hall, which is the oldest part of the mosque, lies towards the south. It has a flat paved roof topped with 27 sliding domes on square bases. Holes pierced into the base of each dome illuminate the interior when the domes are closed. The sliding roof is closed during the afternoon prayer (&quot;Dhuhr&quot;) to protect the visitors. When the domes slide out on metal tracks to shade areas of the roof, they create light wells for the prayer hall. At these times, the courtyard of the Ottoman mosque is also shaded with umbrellas affixed to freestanding columns. The roof is accessed by stairs and escalators. The paved area around the mosque is also used for prayer, equipped with umbrella tents. The sliding domes and retractable umbrella-like canopies were designed by the German Muslim architect Mahmoud Bodo Rasch, his firm SL Rasch GmbH, and Buro Happold.

=== The Green Dome ===

The chamber adjacent to the &quot;Rawdah&quot; holds the tombs of Muhammad and two of his companions and father-in-laws, Abu Bakr and Umar. A fourth grave is reserved for ʿĪsā (Jesus), as Muslims believe that he will return and will be buried at the site. The site is covered by the Green Dome. It was constructed in 1817 CE during the reign of the Ottoman sultan Mahmud II and painted green in 1837 CE.

=== The Rawdah ===
&quot;Ar-Rawḍah ash-Sharīfah&quot; () is an area between the &quot;minbar&quot; and the burial-chamber of Muhammad. It is regarded as one of the &quot;Riyāḍ al-Jannah&quot; (). A green carpet was used to distinguish the area from the red carpet used in the rest of the mosque, though it is now also green.

=== Mihrabs ===
There are two mihrabs or niches indicating the &quot;qiblah&quot; in the mosque, one was built by Muhammad and another was built by Uthman. The one built by the latter was larger than that of Muhammad&#x27;s, and it acts as the functional mihrab, whereas Muhammad&#x27;s mihrab is a &quot;commemorative&quot; mihrab. Besides the &quot;mihrab&quot;, the mosque also has other niches which act as indicators for praying. This includes the &quot;Miḥrāb Fāṭimah&quot; () or &quot;Miḥrāb at-Tahajjud&quot; (), which was built by Muhammad for the late-night prayer.

=== Minbars ===

The original &quot;minbar&quot; () used by Muhammad was a block of date palm wood. This was replaced by him with a tamarisk one, which had dimensions of . In 629 CE, a three staired ladder was added to it. Abu Bakr and Umar did not use the third step as a sign of respect to Muhammad, but Uthman placed a fabric dome over it, and the rest of the stairs were covered with ebony. The &quot;minbar&quot; was replaced by Baybars I, by Shaykh al-Mahmudi in 1417, and by Qaitbay in 1483. In 1590 it was replaced by the Ottoman sultan Murad III with a marble &quot;minbar&quot;, while Qaytbay&#x27;s minbar was moved to the Quba Mosque. As of 2013, the Ottoman minbar is still used in the mosque.

=== Minarets ===

The first recorded minarets, four in number, were constructed between 707 and 709 during the reign of al-Walid I. They were high. In 1307, a minaret titled &quot;Bāb as-Salām&quot; (, &quot;Gate of the Peace&quot;) was added by al-Nasir Muhammad which was renovated by Mehmed IV. After the renovation project of 1994, there were ten minarets which were high. The minarets&#x27; upper, middle, and bottom portions are cylindrical, octagonal, and square shaped respectively.
