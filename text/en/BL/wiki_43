<text>Cisleithania, officially The Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the Imperial Council (), was the northern and western part of Austria-Hungary, the Dual Monarchy created in the Compromise of 1867—as distinguished from &quot;Transleithania&quot; (i.e., the Hungarian Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen east of [&quot;beyond&quot;] the Leitha River). This name for the region was a common, but unofficial one.

The Cisleithanian capital was Vienna, the residence of the Austrian emperor. The territory had a population of 28,571,900 in 1910. It reached from Vorarlberg in the west to the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria and the Duchy of Bukovina (today part of Ukraine and Romania) in the east, as well as from the Kingdom of Bohemia in the north to the Kingdom of Dalmatia (today part of Croatia and Montenegro) in the south. It comprised the current States of Austria (except for Burgenland), as well as most of the territories of the Czech Republic and Slovenia (except for Prekmurje), southern Poland, Trieste, Gorizia, Tarvisio, Trentino, and South Tyrol, Croatia, Istria, Dalmatia, Montenegro (Kotor Bay), Romania (Southern Bukovina), and Ukraine (Northern Bukovina and Galicia).

==Term==

The Latin name &quot;Cisleithania&quot; derives from that of the Leitha River, a tributary of the Danube forming the historical boundary between the Archduchy of Austria and the Hungarian Kingdom in the area southeast of Vienna (on the way to Budapest). Much of its territory lay west (or, from a Viennese perspective, on &quot;this&quot; side) of the Leitha.

After the constitutional changes of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, the Cisleithanian crown lands (&quot;Kronländer&quot;) continued to constitute the Austrian Empire, but the latter term was rarely used to avoid confusion with the era before 1867, when the Kingdom of Hungary had been a constituent part of that empire. The somewhat cumbersome official name was &quot;Die im Reichsrat vertretenen Königreiche und Länder&quot; (&quot;The Kingdoms and Lands represented in the Imperial Council&quot;). The phrase was used by politicians and bureaucrats, but it had no official status until 1915; the press and the general public seldom used it and then with a derogatory connotation. In general, the lands were just called Austria, but the term &quot;Austrian lands&quot; (&quot;Österreichische Länder&quot;) originally did not apply to the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (i.e., Bohemia proper, the Margraviate of Moravia and Duchy of Silesia) or to the territories annexed in the 18th-century Partitions of Poland (Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria) or the former Venetian Dalmatia (Kingdom of Dalmatia).

From 1867, the Kingdom of Hungary, the Kingdom of Croatia, the Kingdom of Slavonia and the Principality of Transylvania were no longer &quot;Austrian&quot; crown lands. Rather, they constituted an autonomous state, officially called the &quot;Lands of the Holy Hungarian Crown of St Stephen&quot; ( or &quot;A Magyar Szent Korona Országai&quot;, ) and commonly known as &quot;Transleithania&quot; or just Hungary. The Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina, occupied in 1878, formed a separate part. Both the &quot;Austrian&quot; and &quot;Hungarian&quot; lands of the Dual Monarchy had large Slavic-settled territories in the north (Czechs, Slovaks, Poles and Ruthenians) as well as in the south (Slovenes, Croats and Serbs).

==Crown lands==
Cisleithania consisted of 15 crown lands which had representatives in the Imperial Council (&quot;Reichsrat&quot;), the Cisleithanian parliament in Vienna. The crown lands centered on the Archduchy of Austria (&quot;Erzherzogtum Österreich&quot;) were not states, but provinces in the modern sense. However, they were areas with unique historic political and legal characteristics and were therefore more than mere administrative districts. They have been conceived of as &quot;historical-political entities&quot;.

Each crown land had a regional assembly, the Landtag, which enacted laws (&quot;Landesgesetze&quot;) on matters of regional and mostly minor importance. Until 1848, the &quot;Landtage&quot; had been traditional diets (assemblies of the estates of the realm). They were disbanded after the Revolutions of 1848 and reformed after 1860. Some members held their position as &quot;ex officio&quot; members (e.g., bishops), while others were elected. There was no universal and equal suffrage, but a mixture of privilege and limited franchise. The executive committee of a Landtag was called &quot;Landesausschuss&quot; and headed by a &quot;Landeshauptmann&quot;, being president of the Landtag as well.

From 1868 onwards Emperor Franz Joseph himself (in his function as monarch of a crown land, being king, archduke, grandduke, duke or count) and his Imperial–Royal (&quot;k.k.&quot;) government headed by the Minister-President of Austria were represented at the capital cities of the crown lands—except for Vorarlberg which was administered with Tyrol, and Istria and Gorizia-Gradisca which were administered together with Trieste under the common name of Austro-Illyrian Littoral— by a stadtholder (&quot;Statthalter&quot;), in few crown lands called &quot;Landespräsident&quot;, who acted as chief executive.

==Politics==
According to the &quot;December Constitution&quot;, a redraft of the emperor&#x27;s 1861 February Patent, the Austrian government was generally responsible in all affairs concerning the Cisleithanian lands, except for the common Austro-Hungarian Army, the Austro-Hungarian Navy and the Foreign Ministry, these &quot;k.u.k.&quot; matters remained reserved for the Imperial and Royal Ministers&#x27; Council for Common Affairs of Austria-Hungary.

The Austrian &quot;Reichsrat&quot;, a bicameral legislature implemented in 1861, became the Cisleithanian parliament. Originally consisting of delegates of the &quot;Landtage&quot;, in 1873 direct election of the House of Deputies (&quot;Abgeordnetenhaus&quot;) was introduced with a four-class franchise suffrage for male landowners and bourgeois. Equal, direct, secret and universal suffrage—for men—was not introduced until a 1907 electoral reform. In this Lower House (with 353 members in 1873 and 516 in 1907), at first German-speaking deputies dominated, but with the extension of the suffrage the Slavs gained a majority. An ethnic nationalist struggle between German-speaking and Slavic deputies, especially in the context of the Czech National Revival, was played out. Leaders of the movement like František Palacký advocated the emancipation of the Slavic population within the Monarchy (Austroslavism), while politicians of the Young Czech Party principally denied the right of the &quot;Reichsrat&quot; to put any decisions relevant for the &quot;Czech lands&quot;, and used means of filibustering as well as absence to torpedo its work. They were antagonized by radical German nationalists led by Georg von Schönerer, demanding the dissolution of the Monarchy and the unification of the &quot;German Austrian&quot; lands with the German Empire.

After 1893, no &quot;k.k.&quot; government was able to rely on a parliamentary majority. Nevertheless, Polish members of parliament and politicians like Count Kasimir Felix Badeni achieved some success involving Galician Poles by special regulations for this &quot;developing country&quot;; thence the &quot;Polenklub&quot; played a constructive role most of the time. Politics were frequently paralysed because of the tensions between different nationalities. When Czech obstruction at the Reichsrat prevented the parliament from working, the emperor went on to rule autocratically through imperial decrees (&quot;Kaiserliche Verordnungen&quot;) submitted by his government. The &quot;Reichsrat&quot; was prorogued in March 1914 at the behest of Minister-President Count Karl von Stürgkh, it did not meet during the July Crisis and was not reconvened until May 1917, after the accession of Emperor Karl in 1916.

For representation in matters relevant to the whole real union of Austria-Hungary (foreign affairs, defence, and the financing thereof) the &quot;Reichsrat&quot; appointed delegations of 60 members to discuss these matters parallel to Hungarian delegations of the same size and to come, in separate votes, to the same conclusion on the recommendation of the responsible common ministry. In Cisleithania, the 60 delegates consisted of 40 elected members of the House of Representatives (&quot;Abgeordnetenhaus&quot;) and 20 members of the Upper House (&quot;Herrenhaus&quot;). The delegations convened simultaneously, both either in Vienna or in Budapest, though spatially divided. In case of not getting the same decision in three attempts, the law permitted the summoning of a common session of both delegations and the eventual counting of the votes in total, but the Hungarians, who averted any Imperial &quot;roof&quot; over their part of the dual monarchy, as well as the common ministers, carefully avoided reaching this situation. Austria-Hungary as a common entity did not have its own jurisdiction and legislative power, which was shaped by the fact that there was no common parliament. The common diplomatic and military affairs were managed by delegations from the Imperial Council and the Hungarian parliament. According to the compromise, the members of the delegates from the two parliaments had no right to debate, they had no right to introduce new perspectives and own ideas during the meetings, they were nothing more than the extended arms of their own parliaments. All decisions had to be ratified by the Imperial council in Vienna and by the Hungarian parliament in Budapest. Without the Austrian and Hungarian parliamentary ratifications, the decisions of the delegates were not valid in Austria or in Kingdom of Hungary.

==Population==

The largest group within Cisleithania were Austrian Germans (including Yiddish-speaking Jews), who made up around a third of the population. German-speakers and Czechs made up a majority of the population. Almost 60% of Cisleithania&#x27;s population was ethnically Slavic.
== Religion ==
Religion groups in Cisleithania included Roman Catholics, Greek Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Evangelicals, Muslims and Jews. Roman Catholics were the largest religious group in the country that accounted for 79% of the population. While on the other hand, Greek Catholics accounted for 12% of the population. In the Austrian half, Orthodox church had 770,000 believers mostly concentrated in Dalmatia and Bukovina which represented 2.3% of the population. The Evengelical churches had 600,000 believers that represented 2% of the population in Cisleithania. Muslims, predominantly Sunni, became the citizens of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after the occupation in 1878 and later annexation in 1908. At the time they were called the Mohammedans and they were accounted for 1.2% of the population. Jews, according to the resource, represented 4.6% of the whole Austro-Hungarian population.

<text>Richard Glover (1712 – 25 November 1785) was an English poet and politician.

==Life==
The son of Richard Glover, a Hamburg merchant, he was born in London and educated at Cheam in Surrey. His mother was a sister of Richard West, Lord Chancellor of Ireland. The young Richard was said to have been something of a favourite of his uncle.

In 1739 he became one of the founding governors for the Foundling Hospital, a charity dedicated to saving children from the plight of abandonment. The success of Glover&#x27;s &quot;Leonidas&quot; led him to take an interest in politics, and in 1761 he entered parliament as member for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis. Glover was one of the reputed authors of the &quot;Letters of Junius&quot;; but his claims, advocated in 1825 by Richard Duppa, are slight.

==Works==
He wrote in his sixteenth year a poem to the memory of Sir Isaac Newton, which was prefixed by Henry Pemberton to his &quot;View of Newton&#x27;s Philosophy&quot;, published in 1728.

In 1737, he published an epic poem, &quot;Leonidas&quot;, which proved highly successful. It retells the story of the Battle of Thermopylae of 480 BC, drawing heavily on ancient accounts of Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus. It was commended by the prince of Wales and his court, and celebrated by leading literary figures such as Alexander Pope, Henry Fielding, and Jonathan Swift. Translations into German, French and Danish followed, as did several stage adaptions; and a number of writers across Europe, including Willem van Haren, Abbé Prévost, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock and Friedrich Schiller cited and praised the poem.

In 1739, Glover published a poem entitled &quot;London, or the Progress of Commerce&quot;; and in 1740 he published a ballad, &quot;Admiral Hosier&#x27;s Ghost&quot;, popular in its day. The ballad&#x27;s real target was not the Spanish but Sir Robert Walpole.

He was also the author of two tragedies, &quot;Boadicea&quot; (1753) and &quot;Medea&quot; (1761), written in close imitation of Greek models. The &quot;Athenaid&quot;, an epic in thirty books, was published in 1787, and his diary, entitled &quot;Memoirs of a distinguished literary and political Character from 1742 to 1757&quot;, appeared in 1813.

In May 1774, shortly after the death of Oliver Goldsmith, Glover published his &quot;Authentic Anecdotes&quot; on the poet in &quot;The Universal Magazine&quot;. Edmund Burke included the piece in &quot;The Annual Register&quot; for that year, and when Edmond Malone in 1776 worked on a biographical memoir for &quot;Poems and Plays by Oliver Goldsmith&quot; (1777) he based it on Glover&#x27;s &quot;Anecdotes&quot; as well as first-hand information from Dr. Thomas Wilson, Senior Fellow at Trinity College, Dublin.

<text>The Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA, , , , ), so named since 1979, is one of the seven Departments of the Swiss government federal administration of Switzerland, and corresponds in its range of tasks to the ministry of foreign affairs in other countries. The department is always headed by one of the members of the Swiss Federal Council. Since 1 November 2017, the department is headed by Federal Councillor Ignazio Cassis.

==Mission==
The mission of the FDFA is to safeguard Switzerland&#x27;s interests abroad and its relations with other countries, as stipulated in Art. 54, para. 1 of the Swiss Federal Constitution. The subsequent paragraph further outlines the parameters by which Swiss foreign policy is to be conducted: 

&quot;The Confederation shall ensure that the independence of Switzerland and its welfare is safeguarded; it shall in particular assist in the alleviation of need and poverty in the world and promote respect for human rights and democracy, the peaceful co-existence of peoples as well as the conservation of natural resources.&quot;

At the beginning of every parliamentary legislature, the FDFA submits a foreign policy strategy to the Federal Council, setting out the main focus areas and foreign policy priorities for the term. For the 2020-23 period, these focus areas include: 

* Peace and security
* Prosperity
* Sustainability
* Digitalisation

== History ==
The FDFA has been one of the key Swiss ministries since the creation of the modern Swiss federal state in 1848. 

Originally, what was then known as the &quot;Federal Political Department&quot; (FPD) was led by whomever held the rotating presidency, meaning the responsibility for foreign affairs changed on a yearly basis. With very limited means at its disposal, it comprised a meagre staff of officers in Bern and a very limited diplomatic and consular network abroad.

In 1887, the department was restructured by then-president Numa Droz, who then assumed leadership of what was thereafter known as the Federal Department of the Exterior for five years. Beginning in 1896, the Federal Council reprised the previous rotating system, which would be maintained until 1914 with the passage of the Federal Administration Act. From that moment forward, the head of the FPD would no longer change from year to year, and the Department, in liaison with the Department of the Economy (present-day known as the Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research) accrued increased competence in commercial matters. With Switzerland&#x27;s accession to the League of Nations in the aftermath of the First World War, the FPD&#x27;s responsibilities were further expanded and in particular as Geneva was transformed into a major hub for international diplomacy, marked in particular by the construction of the &quot;Palais des Nations&quot; in to serve as headquarters for the League in that city. 

Following the Second World War, in which Switzerland remained neutral, the orientation of Swiss foreign policy adjusted to the new paradigms of the Cold War. Switzerland did not join the newly created United Nations, which succeeded the League of Nations. The reason for this refusal was that it was impossible to obtain explicit recognition from the organisation of its status as a neutral country. In 1961, specific structures were created within the FDP for the administration of official development assistance and for fostering relations with other countries in Europe and, in particular, the various European cooperation organisations that emerged in that period, such as the European Coal and Steel Community.

With the expanding portfolio of responsibilities assigned to the ministry, in 1979 the FDP was once again reorganised and renamed, this time to the present name, Federal Department of Foreign Affairs. At the same time, the position of FDFA state secretary — the number-two person at the Department – was created, and competences of the Department were increased to cover areas such as disarmament, science policy and human rights. 

In 2002, Switzerland joined the United Nations, following the endorsement of its accession through a popular referendum. In 2023, it assumed a seat as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.

<doc id="401458" wikidata="Q444327" url="?curid=401458" title="Rotary Rocket">
<text>Rotary Rocket Company was a rocketry company that developed the Roton concept in the late 1990s as a fully reusable single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) crewed spacecraft. The design was initially conceived by Bevin McKinney, who shared it with Gary Hudson. In 1996, Rotary Rocket Company was formed to commercialize the concept. The Roton was intended to reduce costs of launching payloads into low Earth orbit by a factor of ten.

The company gathered considerable venture capital from angel investors and opened a factory headquartered in a facility at Mojave Air and Space Port in Mojave, California. The fuselage for their vehicles was made by Scaled Composites, at the same airport, while the company developed the novel engine design and helicopter-like landing system. A full-scale test vehicle made three hover flights in 1999, but the company exhausted its funds and closed in early 2001.

== Origins ==

Bevin McKinney had been thinking about the idea of a launch vehicle using helicopter blades for several years, when Wired magazine asked Gary Hudson to write an article on the concept. The resulting article resulted in a commitment of funding from billionaire Walt Anderson, which was combined with an initial investment from author Tom Clancy and allowed the company to get started. Hudson and McKinney were joined by co-founders Frederick Giarrusso, Dan DeLong, James Grote, Tom Brosz, and Anne Hudson, who together launched the company in October 1996.

== Design evolution ==

=== Helicopter to orbit ===

Gary Hudson&#x27;s and Bevin McKinney&#x27;s initial concept was to merge a launch vehicle with a helicopter: spinning rotor blades, powered by tip jets, would lift the vehicle in the earliest stage of launch. Once the air density thinned to the point that helicopter flight was impractical, the vehicle would continue its ascent on pure rocket power, with the rotor acting as a giant turbopump.

Calculations showed that the helicopter blades modestly increased the effective specific impulse (&quot;I&quot;sp) by approximately 20–30 seconds, essentially only carrying the blades into orbit &quot;for free&quot;. Thus, there was no overall gain from this method during ascent. However, the blades could be used to soft land the vehicle, so its landing system carried no additional cost.

One problem found during research at Rotary was that once the vehicle left the atmosphere additional thrust would be necessary. Thus multiple engines would be needed at the base as well as at the rotor tips.

This initial version of the Roton had been designed with the small communications satellite market in mind. However, this market crashed, signaled by the failure of Iridium Communications. Consequently, the Roton concept needed to be redesigned for heavier payloads.

=== Helicopter from orbit ===

The revised and redesigned Roton concept was a cone-shaped launch vehicle, with a helicopter rotor on top for use only during landing. An internal cargo bay could be used both for carrying payloads to orbit and bringing others back to Earth. The projected price to orbit of this design was given as $1,000 per kg of payload, less than one-tenth of the then-current launch price. Payload capacity was limited to a relatively modest .

The revised version would have used a unique rotating annular aerospike engine: the engine and base of the launch vehicle would spin at high speed (720 rpm) to pump fuel and oxidizer to the rim by the rotation. Unlike the landing rotor, due to the shallow angle of the nozzles in the base rotor, the rotation speed self limited and required no control system. Since the density of the LOX (liquid oxygen) was higher than that of the kerosene, extra pressure was available with the LOX, so it would have been used to cool the engine&#x27;s throat and other components, rather than using the kerosene as the coolant as in a conventional LOX/kerosene rocket. However, at the high G levels at the outer edge of the rotating engine block, clarity on how LOX would work as a coolant was both unknown and difficult to validate. That added one layer of risk.

In addition, the rotating exhaust acted as a wall at the outer edge of the engine base, lowering the temperature of the base to below ambient due to ejector pump effect and creating a suction cup at the bottom in atmosphere. This could be alleviated using makeup gas to develop base pressure, requiring an additional rocket engine to fill up the base of the main rocket engine. (Similar problems would have occurred in a conventional aerospike engine, but there, natural recirculation plus use of the turbopump gas-generator&#x27;s exhaust as the makeup gas would have largely alleviated the problem &quot;for free.&quot;)

At the rim, 96 miniature jets would exhaust the burning propellants (LOX and kerosene) around the rim of the base of the vehicle, which gained the vehicle extra thrust at high altitude – acting as a zero-length truncated aerospike nozzle. A similar system with non-rotating engines was studied for the N1 rocket. That application had a much smaller base area, and did not create the suction effect a larger peripheral engine induces. The Roton engine had a projected vacuum ISP (specific impulse) of ~, which is very high for a LOX/kerosene engine – and a thrust to weight ratio of 150, which is extremely light.

During reentry, the base also served as a water-cooled heatshield. This was theoretically a good way to survive reentry, particularly for a lightweight reusable vehicle. However, using water as a coolant would require converting it into superheated steam, at high temperatures and pressures, and there were concerns about micrometeorite damage on orbit puncturing the pressure vessel, causing the reentry shield to fail. These concerns were resolved using a failure-resistant massively redundant flow system, created using thin metal sheets chemically etched with a pattern of micropores forming a channel system that was robust against failure and damage.

In addition, cooling was achieved two different ways; one way was the vaporization of the water, but the second was even more significant, and was due to the creation of a layer of &quot;cool&quot; steam surrounding the base surface, reducing the ability to heat. Further, the water metering system would have to be extremely reliable, giving one drop per second per square inch, and was achieved via a trial/error design approach on real hardware. By the end of the Roton program, some hardware had been built and tested. The reentry trajectory was to be trimmed, similar to the Soyuz, to minimize the G loads on the passengers. And the ballistic coefficient was better for the Roton and could be better tailored. When the Soyuz trim system failed and it went full ballistic, the G levels did rise significantly but without incident to the passengers.

The vehicle was also unique in planning to use its helicopter-style rotors for landing, rather than wings or parachutes. This concept allowed controlled landings (unlike parachutes), and it was 1/5 the weight of fixed wings. Another advantage was that a helicopter could land almost anywhere, whereas winged spaceplanes such as the Space Shuttle had to make it back to the runway. The rotor blades were to be powered by peroxide tip rockets. The rotor blades were to be deployed before reentry; some questions were raised about whether the blades would survive until landing.

The initial plan was to have them almost vertical, but that was found to be unstable as they needed to drop lower and lower and spin faster for stability, the heating rates went up dramatically and the air flow became more head on. The implication of that was that the blades went from a lightly heated piece of hardware to one that either had to be actively cooled or made of SiC or other refractory material. The idea of popping out the blades became much more attractive at this point, and initial studies were made for that option. This rotor design concept was not without precedent. In 1955, one of five Soviet designs for planned suborbital piloted missions was to include rocket-tipped rotors as its landing system. On May 1, 1958 these plans were dropped as a decision was made to proceed directly to orbital flights.

Rotary Rocket designed and pressure-tested an exceptionally lightweight but strong composite LOX tank. It survived a test program which involved it being pressure cycled and ultimately deliberately shot to test its ignition sensitivity.

=== A new engine ===
In June 1999, Rotary Rocket announced that it would use a derivative of the Fastrac engine under development at NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center, instead of the company&#x27;s own unconventional spinning engine design. Reportedly, the company had been unable to convince investors that its engine design was viable; the composite structure and gyrocopter reentry was an easier sell.

At the same time as this change, the company laid off about a third of its employees, lowering approximate headcount from 60 to 40. At this point, the company planned to begin its commercial launch service sometime in 2001. Although the company had raised $30 million, it still needed to raise an additional $120 million before entering service.

== Atmospheric Test Vehicle (ATV) ==
A full size, 63 ft (19 m) tall, Atmospheric Test Vehicle (ATV) was built under contract by Scaled Composites for use in hover test flights. The $2.8 million ATV was not intended as an all-up test article, since it had no rocket engine and no heat shielding. The ATV was rolled out of its Mojave hangar on March 1, 1999, bearing an FAA registry of N990RR.

The rotor head was salvaged from a crashed Sikorsky S-58, at a price of $50,000 – as opposed to as much as $1 million for a new head. Each rotor was powered by a 350-lbf (1,560 N) hydrogen peroxide jet, as intended for the orbital vehicle. The rotor assemblage was tested in a rock quarry before installation on the ATV.

The ATV flew three successful test flights in 1999. The pilot for these three flights was Marti Sarigul-Klijn and the copilot was Brian Binnie (who later gained fame as pilot of Scaled Composites&#x27; SpaceShipOne on its second X-Prize flight).

The ATV made its first flight on July 28. This flight consisted of three vertical hops totaling 4 min 40 sec in duration and reaching a maximum altitude of 8 ft (2.4 m). The pilots found the flying extremely challenging for a number of reasons. Visibility in the cockpit was so restricted that the pilots nicknamed it the Batcave. The view of the ground was entirely obstructed, so the pilots had to rely on a sonar altimeter to judge ground proximity. The entire craft had a low rotational inertia, and torque from the spinning rotor blades made the body spin, unless counteracted by yaw thrust in the opposite direction.

The second flight, on September 16, was a continuous hover flight lasting 2 min 30 sec, reaching a maximum altitude of 20 ft (6.1 m). The sustained flight was made possible by the installation of more powerful rotor tip thrusters and an autothrottle.

The third and last flight was made on October 12. The ATV flew down the flightline at Mojave Air and Space Port, covering 4,300 ft (1,310 m) in its flight and rising to a maximum altitude of 75 ft (23 m). The speed was as high as 53 mph (85 km/h). This test revealed some instability in translational flight.

A fourth test was planned to simulate a full autorotative descent. The ATV would climb to an altitude 10,000 ft (3,050 m) under its own power, before throttling back and returning for a soft landing. At this point, given that further funding was then unlikely, safety considerations prevented the test being attempted.

== Criticism of the design ==

Rotary Rocket failed due to lack of funding, but some have suggested that the design itself was inherently flawed.

The Rotary Rocket did fly three test flights and a composite propellant tank survived a full test program, however these tests revealed problems. For instance, the ATV demonstrated that landing the Rotary Rocket was tricky, even dangerous. Test pilots have a rating system, the Cooper-Harper rating scale, for vehicles between 1 and 10 that relates to difficulty to pilot. The Roton ATV scored a 10 — the vehicle simulator was found to be almost unflyable by anyone except the Rotary test pilots, and even then there were short periods where the vehicle was out of control.

Other aspects of the flight plan remained unproven and it is unknown whether Roton could have developed sufficient performance to reach orbit with a single stage, and return – although on paper this might have been possible.

== Last days ==
Engine development ceased in 2000, reportedly two weeks before a full-scale test was due. The vehicle failed to secure launch contracts and Rotary Rocket closed in 2001.

The timing of the venture was unfortunate: the Iridium Communications venture was nearing bankruptcy, and the space industry in general was experiencing financial stress. Ultimately, the company did not attract sufficient funding – even though numerous individuals provided a total of $33 million of support, including writer Tom Clancy.

The Atmospheric Test Vehicle was to be displayed at Classic Rotors Museum, a helicopter museum near San Diego, California, but an attempt to move it there on May 9, 2003 via a short-line sling-load under an Army Reserve CH-47 Chinook failed when the Roton began to oscillate at airspeeds above . Instead, the vehicle was kept at Mojave, and on November 10, 2006, the Roton was moved to its permanent display location at the intersection of Airport Blvd and Sabovich Road.

<text>Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) is a UK charity that works to alleviate poverty and social exclusion.

==History==
The Group first met on 5 March 1965, at a meeting organised by Harriett C. Wilson. It followed the publication of Brian Abel-Smith and Peter Townsend&#x27;s work &quot;Poor and the Poorest&quot;: both men were founding members of the Group.

At the second meeting one of the points raised was &quot;That although increased family allowance might be the simplest and most equitable way of overcoming the poverty of large families, there was likely to be considerable difficulties in bringing about a change of this kind, partly because of the fear that this would tend to encourage people to have large families.&quot;

One of its first actions was to send a letter to the Prime Minister, on 22 December 1965, signed by a number of distinguished public figure, which stated:&quot;The signatories of this letter would probably not all agree on the precise details of a scheme for reform: we are agreed, however, that action should be taken to achieve a radical improvement in the standard of living of families in poverty and we wish to bring this memorandum to your attention. We ask that the present arrangements for family allowances and the allowances for children be reconsidered and revised, and that bigger direct allowances be paid in respect of children in the poorest families.&quot;Tony Lynes was the first full-time secretary of the Group in 1966. Frank Field served as Director of the Group from 1969 to 1979 and was followed by Ruth Lister (1979–1987) and Fran Bennett, and later by Kate Green (2004–2009).

== Activities ==
CPAG programmes include:
* Research and publish the latest facts and figures of family and child poverty in the UK
* Lobby the UK government, lead and support campaigns for effective policies to prevent, alleviate and abolish child and family poverty
* Provide up to date information and reliable advice on the UK social security and tax credits systems
* Conduct training courses in Welfare Rights, for both new and experienced advisers, to help them keep up to date with developments in social security and tax credits
* Undertake test-cases to extend the interpretation of law in favour of claimants in social security, tax credits and related law using, where appropriate the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights.

<doc id="401463" wikidata="Q7098958" url="?curid=401463" title="Optimist International">
<text>Optimist International is an international service club organization with almost 3,000 clubs and over 80,000 members in more than 20 countries. The international headquarters is located in St. Louis, Missouri, United States. Optimist International is also the sponsor of Junior Optimist International, designed for elementary school through high school aged youth.

==Organization==
Optimist International is an organization comprising self-governing Optimist Clubs that engage in community service work. Every club raises its funds and independently selects service initiatives aimed at enhancing the well-being of children. Examples of typical projects include sponsoring youth athletic leagues, holding essay and oratorical contests for scholarships, and supporting local schools.

==History==
The international organization was founded at a convention in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1919. It united various local and regional clubs, the first of which had been founded in Buffalo, New York, in 1911. At the convention, the &quot;first official charter&quot; of the international organization was awarded to the club in Downtown Indianapolis, Indiana which had been founded in 1916.
Several Optimist clubs participated in the June 1917 organization meeting of the Lions Clubs International held in Chicago, Illinois. However, the delegates sent by the clubs opted not to join the new organization and withdrew from the meeting.

==Organizational philosophy==
Optimist International delineates its mission, vision, and purpose to encapsulate its objective of promoting and fostering the development of youth. These statements serve as a concise representation of the organization&#x27;s goals.

In 1922, the Optimist Creed was adopted as the official creed of the organization. The Optimist Creed was developed by Christian D. Larson. It details a number of pledges to which members attempt to adhere.

<text>The Socialist Party of Albania (, PS or PSSh) is a social-democratic political party in Albania. It has been described as centre-left. It is the inheriting force of the Communist Party of Albania, which was founded on 8 November 1941 and later became known as the Party of Labour of Albania (Partia e Punës e Shqipërisë). After the fall of communism in Albania, the Party of Labour of Albania rebranded itself as the Socialist Party of Albania in an effort to adapt to the new political landscape. This is the reason why the Socialist Party is claimed to have been founded on 13 June 1991. The PS is an associate of the Party of European Socialists and a member of the Socialist International, and it claims to hold pro-European views.

== History ==

Established in 1991, the Socialist Party of Albania emerged in the aftermath of the fall of communism in Albania that had dominated Albanian politics since the end of World War II. The dissolution of the People&#x27;s Socialist Republic prompted a reevaluation of political ideologies and a quest for democratic governance, paving the way for the rise of multiple political entities. The roots of the Socialist Party can be traced back to the Party of Labour of Albania under its founder Enver Hoxha, which had been the ruling party for over four decades. Hoxha&#x27;s successor Ramiz Alia was forced to introduce limited reforms in the late 1980s. On 11 December 1990, Alia announced that the PPSh had given up its monopoly of power. The PPSh won the 1991 Albanian Constitutional Assembly election, the first free elections held in the country in almost 80 years. By this time, it was no longer a Marxist–Leninist party. At an extraordinary congress on 10–13 June 1991, the PPSh voted to change its name to the PS in an effort to survive in the new system.

Fatos Nano, a man from the intelligentsia, was elected the new chairman. Nano helped to reform the old Communist party and made it a member of the Socialist International. A faction of the party, led by Ilir Meta, split away from the PS in 2004 and formed the Socialist Movement for Integration (&quot;Lëvizja Socialiste për Integrim&quot;, LSI).

On 10 October 2005, Nano resigned as the chairman of the PS after losing the 2005 Albanian parliamentary election, and was succeeded by Edi Rama. Under Rama&#x27;s lead, the PS formed the &quot;Alliance for a European Albania&quot;, which united several political parties. The alliance won the 2013 Albanian parliamentary election, thus returning the Socialists to the government after 8 years.

The Socialist Party, now running alone, again won the 2017 election and the 2021 election, winning 74 seats in both of them and is thus currently able to rule Albania alone, although it is externally supported by the Social Democratic Party in parliament.

== Political positions ==

In its 2013 party platform, the party has pledged to replace the flat tax with a progressive tax, and also supports universal health care. Party leader Edi Rama has indicated that he supports LGBT rights in Albania. The party is also pro-European, supports the accession of Albania to the European Union, NATO membership, and considers Kosovo &quot;Albania&#x27;s main strategic partner and ally&quot;. Rama has also said that he strives to follow the Third Way approach of former British prime minister Tony Blair.

<text>Thomas Pownall (bapt. 4 September 1722 N.S. – 25 February 1805) was a British colonial official and politician. He was governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay from 1757 to 1760, and afterwards sat in the House of Commons from 1767 to 1780. He travelled widely in the North American colonies prior to the American Revolutionary War, opposed Parliamentary attempts to tax the colonies, and was a minority advocate of colonial positions until the Revolution.

Classically educated and well-connected to the colonial administration in London, Pownall first travelled to North America in 1753. He spent two years exploring the colonies before being appointed Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey in 1755. He became governor of Massachusetts in 1757 after helping engineer the recall of longtime Governor William Shirley. His administration was dominated by the French and Indian War (the Seven Years&#x27; War) in which Pownall was instrumental in raising Massachusetts provincial militia for the war effort. He opposed military interference in colonial administration, including attempts to quarter British troops in private homes, and had a generally positive relationship with the colonial assembly.

Returning to England in 1760, Pownall continued to be interested in colonial affairs, publishing widely read materials on conditions in the colonies, including several editions of &quot;The Administration of the Colonies&quot;. As a Member of Parliament he regularly advocated for colonial positions, without much success, but supported the war effort once the Revolutionary War began. In the early 19th century he became an early advocate of the reduction or removal of trade barriers, and the establishment of a solid relationship between Britain and the United States. Several writers have proposed that Pownall was Junius, a pseudonymous writer of letters critical of British governmental practices.

John Adams wrote, &quot;Pownall was the most constitutional and national Governor, in my opinion, who ever represented the crown in this province.&quot;

==Early life==

Thomas Pownall was the eldest son of William and Sarah (Burniston) Pownall, daughter of John Burniston and his wife. His father was a country gentleman and soldier whose poor health and early death in 1735 caused the family to fall upon hard times. Baptised 4 September 1722 (New Style) in Lincoln, England, Thomas was educated at Lincoln Grammar School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1743. His education exposed him to classic and current philosophers, and the sciences. His first publication, a treatise on the origins of government published in 1752, began as notes developed at Cambridge.

==Early Career==
During Thomas&#x27;s years at Cambridge, his younger brother John acquired a job at the Board of Trade, which oversaw British colonial affairs, and rapidly rose in the bureaucracy. The brothers were influential supporters of each other in their efforts to advance. John secured a job for Thomas in the colonial office, where he became aware of the possibilities for advancement and influence in colonial postings. In 1753 he went to America as private secretary to Sir Danvers Osborn, just appointed governor of New York. Osborn committed suicide several days after reaching New York, leaving Pownall without a job and a sponsor. Pownall chose to remain in America, devoting himself to studying the condition of the American colonies. In the following months he travelled widely, from Maryland to Massachusetts. He was introduced into the highest circles of leadership and society in the colonies, and established relationships with a number of influential people, including Benjamin Franklin and Massachusetts Governor William Shirley.
Governor Osborn had been instructed particularly to deal with the rising discontent among the six Iroquois nations whose territory abutted New York (and is encompassed by central and western Upstate New York and part of Pennsylvania). Pownall had studied the matter, and he was consequently invited by his Pennsylvania connections to attend the 1754 Albany Congress as an observer. His observations on the nature of colonial dealings with the Indians (including political infighting for control of the Indian trade, and the corrupt and fraudulent acquisition of Indian lands) led him to draft a number of proposals related to colonial administration. He proposed the establishment of a crown-appointed superintendent of Indian affairs, specifically William Johnson, New York&#x27;s commissioner for Indian affairs who was highly influential with the Iroquois nations. He also articulated visions for managing the expansion of the colonies to the west.

After the conference Pownall returned to Philadelphia. In this time he apparently deepened a close friendship with Franklin, with whom he began to invest in business ventures. Franklin, who had unsuccessfully proposed colonial union at the Albany conference, may have contributed to Pownall&#x27;s writings, although the exact nature of his influence is unclear. While in Philadelphia Pownall also established a close collaboration with cartographer Lewis Evans, both of whom recognized the need for accurate maps of the inland regions of North America then being disputed with New France in the French and Indian War. The map Evans published in 1755 was dedicated to Pownall, and brought the latter wide publicity. Pownall&#x27;s recommendation of William Johnson as superintendent of Indian affairs was implemented by the crown in 1755.

==Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey==

Pownall had been living at his own expense, in the hopes that a posting would eventually come his way. In May 1755 he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey, with little responsibility beyond anticipating the death of the aging governor, Jonathan Belcher, and attending military conferences concerning the ongoing war. Belcher, however, proved to be longer lived than expected (he died in 1757), and Pownall was restless. The military conferences drew him into an ongoing power struggle between Johnson and Shirley (who rose to become military commander-in-chief upon the death of General Edward Braddock in July 1755) over the management of Indian affairs. Johnson capitalized on Pownall&#x27;s concern over frontier security to draw him into his camp. Pownall already harboured some dislike of Shirley over an earlier snub, and his reports to New York Governor Sir Charles Hardy, combined with damaging allegations provided by other Johnson supporters, led to Shirley&#x27;s dismissal as commander-in-chief. Pownall returned to England in early 1756, where he confirmed the Johnson allegations, and was rewarded with a post as &quot;Secretary Extraordinary&quot; (a title of Pownall&#x27;s creation) to the new commander-in-chief, Lord Loudoun.

While Pownall was in England, Shirley&#x27;s reputation was further damaged by allegations (not apparently furthered by Pownall&#x27;s action) that he had let military information fall into enemy hands, and the Board of Trade decided to recall him. Pownall was also offered the governorship of Pennsylvania by its proprietors; however, his demands for wide-ranging powers in the post led them to retract the offer. Pownall turned this to his own advantage, widely publicizing the fact that he had turned down the offer because of the &quot;unreasonable, unenlightened attitude of the proprietors.&quot;
He accompanied Lord Loudoun back to America in July 1756, but again returned to England to represent Loudoun in hearings on Shirley&#x27;s military leadership.
Lord Loudoun also instructed Pownall on his military plans and objectives.
In London he became closely involved in informing members of the new Pitt-Newcastle Ministry of the state of affairs in North America. 

His performance in these matters resulted in his appointment as governor of Massachusetts in March 1757. Although he was admired for his competence in colonial affairs, he was also criticised for his vanity and temper, as well as his role in bringing about Shirley&#x27;s fall.

==Governor of Massachusetts Bay==
Pownall arrived in Boston in early August 1757. He was well received and assumed his duties on 3 August.
He was immediately thrust into a war-related crisis. A French force was reported to be moving toward Fort William Henry, in northern New York, and the military commander there had made an urgent call for militia. Pownall was energetic in organizing the militia, but the call to arms came too late, since Fort William Henry fell after a brief siege that was followed by some of the worst atrocities by Indians of the war.
In September 1757 Pownall travelled to New Jersey to attend the funeral of Governor Jonathan Belcher and stopped in New York to meet with Lord Loudoun. 

The commander-in-chief was upset that the Massachusetts General Court had not fully implemented a variety of demands that he had made, and he held Pownall responsible. Pownall objected to the interference of the military in civilian affairs, the threat of which Loudoun used to implement his agenda, by maintaining that it was necessary for the governor to lead, not drive, the provincial assembly.
The meeting was acrimonious, and Loudoun afterward wrote a letter to London that harshly criticised Pownall&#x27;s position and called his ideas on governance &quot;high-handed&quot;.
Loudoun encountered opposition in the General Court, the provincial assembly, to a demand for British troops to be billeted with civilians in Boston, and he threatened to march additional troops into the province and take housing by force.
Pownall requested for the General Court to accede in some way to Loudoun&#x27;s demands and eventually signed a bill authorizing the quartering of troops in inns and other public spaces. The bill was unpopular, and Pownall was negatively cast in the local press as supportive of Loudoun and his policies.
Pownall&#x27;s exchanges with Loudoun, however, show that he was keenly aware of the colonists&#x27; position: &quot;the inhabitants of this province are intitled to the natural rights of English born subjects... the enjoyment of these rights... will animate and encourage them to resist... a cruel, invading enemy.&quot;
He was equally clear on the relationship between the royal governor and his assembly: &quot;a governor must endeavour &quot;to lead&quot; those people for he cannot &quot;drive&quot; them and must lead them step by step as he can &quot;gett &quot;[sic]&quot; footing&quot;&quot;.
He was so committed to his ideas that he offered to resign, but Loudoun encouraged him to remain in the post.
Pownall would later author portions of the 1765 Quartering Act, a parliamentary bill whose implementation was widely resisted in the colonies.

In January 1758, Pownall wrote several letters to William Pitt the Elder to outline the difficult issues surrounding relations between the colonial government and the military and civil administrations of the British establishment.
He specifically recommended for London to offer to pay more of the colonial expenses of the war; the implementation of that idea led to a significant increase in militia recruitment for the remaining years of the war, including 7,000 men from Massachusetts for the 1758 campaign.
Pownall was able to move a bill through the General Court to implement reforms of the militia system. The bill did not include all of the changes that Pownall had sought to achieve a more flexible and less costly organization, and its terms also handed more power over the militia in the hands of local officials and reduced the governor&#x27;s control.
Despite the reforms, recruiting for the militia proved difficult, and recruiting parties were often harassed and stoned, which led to rioting on several occasions.
Pownall was, however, successful in recruiting the province&#x27;s full quota of militia, and his energetic assistance in the war effort earned him approbation from Pitt; the Board of Trade; and the new commander-in-chief, James Abercrombie.
Flush with success, Pownall proposed to General Jeffery Amherst the idea of establishing a fort on Penobscot Bay to contest potential French movements in the area.
The area had been the site of periodic frontier raids since 1755, including a major attack on St. George in spring 1758.
The idea developed into a major expedition to the area, which received not only Amherst&#x27;s approval but also the assembly&#x27;s. Pownall led the expedition, oversaw the construction of Fort Pownall and counted it as a major success of the year. Its success kicked off a minor land rush in the area.

Although Pownall&#x27;s start in power was somewhat rocky, his popularity in the province grew as his term progressed. He assiduously saw to the needs of its many fishermen, successfully convinced the military authorities to eliminate burdensome red tape and courted local merchants. He invested in ventures managed by Thomas and John Hancock and was lauded by a group of Massachusetts merchants upon his departure.
A bachelor, he was reported to be a ladies&#x27; man who was highly engaged in the social scene.
Although he was not strongly religious, he regularly attended Anglican services but was also a frequent visitor to local Congregational services.
He successfully finessed contentious issues surrounding the recruitment, deployment, and provisioning of militia by negotiating compromises between military and provincial demands.
He, however, had a strained relationship with his lieutenant governor, Thomas Hutchinson. The two men never trusted each other, and Pownall regularly excluded Hutchinson from his inner council meetings but instead sent him on missions such as to deal with militia recruitment issues.
One of Pownall&#x27;s last acts before leaving the colony was to approve the appointment of James Otis Sr., a longtime Hutchinson adversary, as speaker of the assembly.

In the later months of 1759, Pownall wrote a letter to Pitt to request leave to return to England because &quot;I might be of some service&quot; there. The biographer John Schutz speculates that the underlying reason for Pownall&#x27;s request was related to frustration with his exclusion from the major military actions of the later war years, which was possibly compounded br his desire to acquire a more significant post, such as a governor-generalship of the conquered New France. The historian Bernard Bailyn is of the opinion that Pownall&#x27;s divisive dislike and distrust of Shirley supporters like Thomas Hutchinson and ensuing local political infighting contributed to the request, as did his difficult relationships with the military commanders.

Whatever the reason, the Board of Trade engaged in a reshuffling of colonial positions after King George II died, and Pownall was given the governorship of South Carolina and permission first to take leave in England. His departure from Boston was delayed by militia-recruiting issues and the need to deal with the aftermath of a major fire in the city, and he did not leave until June 1760.

==&quot;The Administration of the Colonies&quot;==
Although he held the governorship of South Carolina, he never actually went there. He characterised his term in Massachusetts as &quot;arduous&quot; and informed the colonial office in November 1760 that he would accept another governorship only if the recently-acceded King George III directly ordered it. Pitt appointed him to the military commissary&#x27;s office in the Electorate of Hanover, where he served until the Seven Years&#x27; War ended in 1763. The position did not further his career ambitions in colonial administration, however, and led to allegations of financial irregularities of which he was cleared.

Upon his return to England he prepared for publication a treatise entitled &quot;The Administration of the Colonies&quot;. First published anonymously in 1764, Pownall revised the work and republished the work several times between 1765 and 1777. The work, a dry and complex treatise on the situation in North America that included commentary on the burgeoning tensions in the Thirteen Colonies, was intended by Pownall to explore how the colonies could properly be incorporated into a larger empire.

Pownall&#x27;s work identified him as supportive of American liberty. Although he feared that Britain was losing control of its colonies, he wrote that the Americans were entitled to the same rights of representative government as their fellow subjects in England, Scotland and Wales. At the same time, he insisted that the military protection that the colonists received from Britain created equally extensive obligations to help pay for some of the cost. He was also convinced of the need for a strong central legislature capable of making common policies that would be binding for every member of the British Empire, including the fractious provinces in North America. Pownall eventually decided that the only solution lay in creating an imperial parliament with representatives from both Britain and the colonies. Although he was not the only British commentator to embrace the idea of an imperial parliament, most Americans found it anathema, so much so that the pamphleteers James Otis Jr. and John Dickinson singled out his centralized plan of legislative reform for particular criticism in Dickinson&#x27;s influential &quot;Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania&quot; (1768). and Otis&#x27;s &quot;Rights of the British Colonies&quot;.

==Colonial supporter==
Pownall continued to communicate with political allies in Massachusetts and was on several occasions called to appear before parliamentary committees to comment on colonial affairs. He considered returning to Massachusetts if a post could be found, and he began investing in property in Nova Scotia by extending his colonial property interests beyond those he had been granted in Maine during his governorship. In 1765, he married Harriet Fawkener, widow of Everard Fawkener and daughter to Lieutenant General Charles Churchill. That gave him a connection to the aristocratic Dukes of Marlborough. Pownall raised her four children as his own.

A gracious and intelligent woman, she became a partner in advancing his political career, hosting social events and encouraging his intellectual pursuits. She may have encouraged him to stand for Parliament in 1767, when he won a seat representing Tregony.
He renewed correspondence with officials in Massachusetts in the hopes of winning appointment as an agent representing the province&#x27;s interests but was unsuccessful. He regularly received visitors from the colonies, and Benjamin Franklin, his old friend from Pennsylvania, was a frequent guest. He observed with alarm the rise in tension in the colonies and the missteps of parliamentary leadership and colonial administration that exacerbated, rather than reduced, them. He used his position in Parliament to highlight the colonial objections to the Quartering Act of 1765 and other unpopular legislation. When troops were sent to Boston in 1768 after protests against the Townshend Acts had turned violent, he took to the floor of Parliament to warn that the connections between Britain and the colonies were unraveling and that the end result could be a permanent breach.

Pownall was opposed to Lord North&#x27;s partial repeal in 1770 of the hated Townshend Acts in which the tax on tea was retained as a symbol of parliamentary power. In debate on the act, Pownall pointed out that retention of the tax would be a &quot;millstone&quot; around English necks, rather than a yoke on American ones, and that it would lead to civil war. His speech was delivered on 5 March 1770, the day of the Boston Massacre. Dispirited by his view that Parliament failed to understand the American colonial issues, he urged his colonial correspondents to continue to press constitutional issues and to avoid violence.

Colonial American issues then briefly subsided from the stage. In 1772, Pownall introduced legislation reforming food production and distribution in Great Britain. It passed the House of Commons but was amended by the Lords, which led the Commons to reject the amended bill as a violation of its prerogatives. The bill passed the next year and was called &quot;Governor Pownall&#x27;s Bill&quot;. It received much praise, including some from influential figures such as Adam Smith. Pownall was also honoured with membership in the Society of Antiquaries and the Royal Society.

==Revolution==

Following the Boston Tea Party in December 1773, Parliament passed a series of bills designed to punish Massachusetts. Pownall was unable to sway opinion toward more conciliatory measures. He was also implicated in the Hutchinson letters affair as someone who may have delivered private letters of Thomas Hutchinson to Benjamin Franklin, but Franklin never identified his source for the letters. Pownall was unable to retain his seat since in 1774, he was voted out of office. Seeking to remain active, Pownall ended up appealing to Lord North, who secured a seat for him in a by-election, representing Minehead. The apparent turn towards Toryism alarmed a number of Pownall&#x27;s colonial supporters; there is also some evidence that North may have engineered Pownall&#x27;s defeat to gain his support.

Pownall supported North&#x27;s attempts at reconciliation in debates leading to the start the American Revolutionary War. However, once hostilities had begun in April 1775, his conciliatory views were dismissed by war-supporting Tories, who opposed them, as well as by Whigs, who saw his proposals as attempts to undercut their positions. Pownall remained nominally in support of North until 1777, when he openly made declarations in support of the peace party. The entry of France to the war on the American side returned him firmly to the pro-war Tory position. His support was, however, nuanced since he continued to argue for some sort of conciliation with the Americans and remaining resolutely patriotic with respect to the French. He was not alone among British politicians in being unable reconcile those positions and refused to stand for re-election in 1780.

During the war years, he published several revisions to &quot;The Administration of the Colonies&quot;, updating and expanding the work to reflect changing conditions. He also worked to update and revise the Evans map by soliciting data and updated maps from colonial correspondents. He withdrew to some extent in the later years after the death of his wife in 1777 but continued to appear in Parliament.

==Later life==

In July 1780, Pownall anonymously published an essay titled &quot;A Memorial Most Humbly Addressed to the Sovereigns of Europe&quot;. The widely published document gained Pownall attention throughout Europe; the anonymity of its author was compromised by the use of extended passages from &quot;Administration of the Colonies&quot;. The essay propounded instructions to Europe&#x27;s leaders on how to deal with a newly independent United States by pointing out that America&#x27;s independence and rapid population growth would have a transformative effect on world trade. He proposed that European leaders meet to establish worldwide regulations for what was essentially free trade.

Pownall continued to maintain an interest in the United States after the war ended although he never returned. He sought without success a commission in the Massachusetts militia, mostly as a formality so that he could present it during his European travels. He continued to write essays (new ones and revisions to older ones) and published an updated version of his 1755 map. In his later years, Pownall was introduced to Francisco de Miranda, a Venezuelan colonial general who favoured Latin American independence from Spain. According to the historian William Spence Robertson, significant arguments advanced by Miranda in his later efforts are traceable to Pownall&#x27;s influence. Pownall also assisted Miranda explicitly by cultivating connections in the British government as he attempted to advance the independence agenda. Pownall&#x27;s last major work was a treatise again arguing for free trade and explicitly called for British support of Latin American independence as a way to open those markets to British and American trade. Pownall died at Bath on 25 February 1805 and was interred in the church at Walcot.

==Antiquary==

While Thomas Pownall is well known as an American colonial governor and an English politician, he was also an important figure in the late-18th-century antiquarian and archaeological studies. In her study of Pownall, Bryony Orme remarks that he &quot;is perhaps one of the most neglected of our early antiquaries, and undeservedly so.&quot; He inherited these interests from his father Captain William Pownall, who lived at No. 5 Pottergate in the Minster Yard, which surrounds Lincoln Cathedral. His father had corresponded with William Stukeley about ancient finds in and around Lincoln, and Thomas Pownall&#x27;s brother John was also a writer on archaeological subjects. Pownall was already demonstrating his interest in archaeology before he left for America, when, in 1752, he recorded evidence for a Roman villa at Glentworth in Lincolnshire

After his return from America, he became a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1770, and he contributed extensively to early issues of the journal &quot;Archaeologia&quot;. Some of his writings describe discoveries around Lincoln. But more importantly he wrote more widely on New Grange in Ireland in 1773 and Braich-y-Dinas at Penmaenmawr, on the North Wales coast. He was to follow this with descriptions of Roman remains in France when he was living there, and, on moving to Bath he again provided descriptions of Roman discoveries.

==Family and legacy==
Pownall married twice. His first wife was Harriet Churchill, widow of Sir Everard Fawkener and illegitimate daughter of Lieutenant General Charles Churchill. In 1784 Pownall married Hannah (Kennet) Astell, acquiring in the process significant estates and the trappings of landed gentry.

The towns of Pownal, Maine and Pownal, Vermont are named after Thomas Pownall. Dresden, Maine was once named Pownalborough in his honour; this recognition survives in the Pownalborough Courthouse, an historic property built there in 1761. The remains of Fort Pownall, named for him, survive in Maine&#x27;s Fort Point State Park.

==Junius==

Between 1769 and 1772, a series of letters was published in London&#x27;s &quot;Public Advertiser&quot;, written by someone using the pseudonym Junius. Many of the letters contained accusations of corruption and abuse of power on the part of British government officials, subjects Pownall also spoke and wrote about. The identity of Junius has since been the subject of contemporary and historical debate. In 1854 Frederick Griffin wrote &quot;Junius Uncovered&quot;, in which he advanced the argument that Pownall was Junius; this argument was again raised by Pownall descendant Charles A. W. Pownall in his 1908 biography of Pownall. Modern scholars dispute the notion, currently favouring Philip Francis as the writer of the letters based on several lines of evidence.

<doc id="401475" wikidata="Q1400609" url="?curid=401475" title="William Roth">
<text>William Victor Roth Jr. (July 22, 1921 – December 13, 2003) was an American lawyer and politician from Wilmington, Delaware. He was a veteran of World War II and a member of the Republican Party. He served from 1967 to 1970 as the lone U.S. Representative from Delaware and from 1971 to 2001 as a U.S. Senator from Delaware. He is the last Republican to serve as and/or be elected a U.S. Senator from Delaware.

Roth was a sponsor of legislation creating the Roth IRA, an individual retirement plan that can be set up with post-tax dollars, offering tax-free withdrawals.

==Early life and family==
Roth was born in Great Falls, Montana, the son of Clara (&quot;née&quot; Nelson) and William Victor Roth, who ran a brewery. His paternal grandparents were German and his maternal grandparents were Swedish. He attended public schools in Helena, Montana, graduating from Helena High School. Roth started college at Montana State University before moving on to graduate from the University of Oregon in 1943, Harvard Business School in 1947, and Harvard Law School in 1949. During World War II he served in a United States Army intelligence unit from 1943 until 1946.

After being admitted to the California Bar in 1950, he moved permanently to Delaware in 1954, and began his work as an attorney for the Hercules Corporation. He married Jane Richards in 1965 and they had two children, William III and Katharine. Jane Richards Roth was U.S. District Court judge for the District of Delaware from 1985 until 1991 and then a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. They were members of the Episcopal Church.

Roth became active in politics as a Republican, and served as secretary of the Delaware Republican Party and a vice president of the Active Young Republicans of New Castle County. In addition, Roth served as a member of Delaware&#x27;s &quot;Little Hoover Commission&quot;, which studied state government and made recommendations for modernizing and reforming it.

==Professional and political career==
After losing the election for Lieutenant Governor of Delaware in 1960, Roth was named chair of the Delaware Republican Party on April 10, 1961. He replaced incumbent Ellwood S. Leach. He served until May 13, 1964, when he lost his reelection bid to Clayton S. Harrison Jr. by a 32–24 vote. In 1966, he defeated incumbent U.S. Representative Harris McDowell, and went on to serve two terms in the United States House of Representatives from January 3, 1967, until December 31, 1970. Roth voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1968.

He then began his five terms in the United States Senate, succeeding the retiring incumbent senator John J. Williams. He served in the U.S. Senate from January 1, 1971, having been appointed when Williams left office two days early, until January 3, 2001, having been defeated in the 2000 election by the Democratic candidate, Governor Tom Carper. Many consider Roth&#x27;s defeat due to his age and health, as he collapsed twice during the campaign, once in the middle of a television interview and once during a campaign event.

Roth was known for fiscal conservatism. Critics blamed him for national deficits during the presidency of Ronald Reagan. He was a longtime member of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs and the Senate Committee on Finance, serving as chairman from September 12, 1995, through January 3, 2001. He was best remembered as a strong advocate of tax cuts, and he co-authored the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, also known as the Kemp-Roth Tax Cut with Jack Kemp. Roth was also the legislative sponsor of the individual retirement account plan that bears his name, the Roth IRA. It is a popular individual retirement account that has existed since 1998. The Roth 401(k), which did not become available until 2006, is also named after Roth. He was also one of the few Republicans to vote for the Brady Bill and the ban on semi-automatic weapons. Roth strongly supported environmental protections. Roth was also very engaged in international affairs and policy. He served as the president of NATO&#x27;s parliament, the North Atlantic Assembly, from 1996 to 1998.

In 1977, Roth was one of nine senators to vote against the Senate adopting a stringent code of ethics intended to assist with the restoration of public confidence in Congress.

On December 2, 1981, Roth was one of four senators to vote against an amendment to President Reagan&#x27;s MX missiles proposal that would divert the silo system by $334 million as well as earmark further research for other methods that would allow giant missiles to be based. The vote was seen as a rebuff of the Reagan administration.

Roth voted in favor of the bill establishing Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday and the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (as well to override President Reagan&#x27;s veto). Roth voted in favor of the nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court.

During the 1999 impeachment of Bill Clinton Roth voted to convict the President on both charges of impeachment. However Clinton was acquitted on both charges.

Roth was a witty man but not a natural campaigner. To help himself, he would ease himself into public appearances by bringing along a Saint Bernard dog. His succession of St. Bernards through his 34-year political career became a trademark of sorts.

==Death==
On December 12, 2003, Roth fell ill while visiting his daughter in Washington, and was admitted to George Washington University Hospital, where he died from heart failure the following day. The Chesapeake &amp; Delaware Canal Bridge carrying Delaware Route 1 was dedicated as the Senator William V. Roth Jr. Bridge, and a celebration was held on July 9, 2007. The bridge is a cable-stayed bridge and notable landmark in northern Delaware. Roth helped secure its funding.

<doc id="401478" wikidata="Q1186135" url="?curid=401478" title="Democratic Alliance Party (Albania)">
<text>The Democratic Alliance Party () is a liberal political party in Albania. The party was formed in 1992 by Neritan Ceka and other dissidents of the Democratic Party of Albania. They opposed the leadership of the party&#x27;s leader Sali Berisha. 

== History ==
PAD was founded in early 1992 by including two of the original founders Gramoz Pashko and Arben Imami. The reason for the split is still disputed by the principals involved. Although the Democratic Alliance Party had six deputies in the 23rd Legislature of Albania, the number needed to form a parliamentary group, they were denied such recognition by the leadership of parliament. The Democratic Alliance Party blamed the government for an incident that occurred in January 1994, when the leader of the Shkoder branch of the party was shot and killed after a rally.

<text>John Herkimer (1773 Tryon County, New York – June 8, 1848 Danube, Herkimer County, New York) was an American lawyer and politician from New York.

==Life==
Herkimer was the son of George Herkimer (brother of Gen. Nicholas Herkimer and Johan Jost Herkimer).

He was a member from Montgomery County of the New York State Assembly in 1800, 1804 and 1806. He was a delegate to the New York State Constitutional Convention of 1801.

During the War of 1812, he served in the State Militia as a Major, leading a battalion in the defense of Sackets Harbor, New York.

In 1817, the Town of Danube (in which area Herkimer&#x27;s home was located) was created from a part of the Town of Minden, and the area transferred from Montgomery to Herkimer County. Afterwards Herkimer was an associate judge of the Herkimer County Court for some years.

Herkimer was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the 15th and the 18th United States Congresses, holding office from March 4, 1817, to March 3, 1819; and from March 4, 1823, to March 3, 1825.

He was buried at the General Herkimer Cemetery in Danube.

<doc id="401482" wikidata="Q1215018" url="?curid=401482" title="The Mill on the Floss">
<text>The Mill on the Floss is a novel by English author George Eliot, pen name of Mary Ann Evans, first published in three volumes on 4 April 1860 by William Blackwood and Sons. The first American edition was published by Harper &amp; Brothers, Publishers, New York.
Spanning a period of 10 to 15 years, the novel details the lives of Tom and Maggie Tulliver, siblings who grow up at Dorlcote Mill on the River Floss. The mill is at the confluence of the Floss and the smaller River Ripple, near the village of St Ogg&#x27;s in Lincolnshire, England. Both the rivers and the village are fictional.

==Plot==
The novel begins in the late 1820s or early 1830s – several historical references place the events in the book after the Napoleonic Wars but before the Reform Act 1832. (In chapter 3, the character Mr Riley is described as an &quot;auctioneer and appraiser thirty years ago&quot;, placing the opening events of the novel in approximately 1829, thirty years before the novel&#x27;s composition in 1859. In chapter 8, Mr Tulliver and Mr Deane discuss the Duke of Wellington and his &quot;conduct in the Catholic Question&quot;, a conversation that could only take place after 1828, when Wellington became Prime Minister and supported a bill for Catholic Emancipation). The novel includes many autobiographical elements and reflects the disgrace that George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans) experienced while in a lengthy relationship with a married man, George Henry Lewes.

Maggie Tulliver is the protagonist and the story begins when she is 9 years old, 13 years into her parents&#x27; marriage. Her relationship with her older brother, Tom, and her romantic relationships with Philip Wakem (a hunchbacked, sensitive and intellectual friend) and with Stephen Guest (a vivacious young socialite in St Ogg&#x27;s and assumed fiancé of Maggie&#x27;s cousin Lucy Deane) constitute the most significant narrative threads.

Tom and Maggie have a close yet complex bond, which continues throughout the novel. Their relationship is coloured by Maggie&#x27;s desire to recapture the unconditional love of her father before his death. Tom&#x27;s pragmatic and reserved nature clashes with Maggie&#x27;s idealism and fervor for intellectual gains and experience. Various family crises, including bankruptcy, Mr Tulliver&#x27;s rancorous relationship with Philip Wakem&#x27;s father, which results in the loss of the mill and Mr Tulliver&#x27;s death, intensify Tom&#x27;s and Maggie&#x27;s differences and highlight their love for each other. To help his father repay his debts, Tom leaves school to devote himself to a life of business. He eventually finds a measure of success, restoring the family&#x27;s former estate. Maggie languishes in the impoverished Tulliver home, her intellectual aptitude wasted in her socially isolated state. She passes through a period of tough spirituality, during which she renounces the world, motivated by her reading of Thomas à Kempis&#x27;s &quot; The Imitation of Christ&quot;.

This renunciation is tested by a renewed friendship with Philip Wakem, with whom she had developed a friendship while he and Tom were students. Against the wishes of Tom and her father - who both despise the Wakems - Maggie secretly meets Philip and they go for long walks through the woods. The relationship they forge is founded partly in Maggie&#x27;s heartfelt pity for broken and neglected human beings but it also serves as an outlet for her intellectual romantic desires. Philip&#x27;s and Maggie&#x27;s attraction is, in any case, inconsequential because of the family antipathy. Philip manages to coax a pledge of love from Maggie. When Tom discovers the relationship between the two, he forces his sister to renounce Philip and with him her hopes of experiencing the broader, more cultured world he represents.

Several years pass, during which Mr Tulliver dies. Lucy Deane invites Maggie to come and stay with her and experience the life of cultured leisure that she enjoys. This includes long hours conversing and playing music with Lucy&#x27;s suitor, Stephen Guest, a prominent St Ogg&#x27;s resident. Stephen and Maggie, against their rational judgments, become attracted to each other. The complication is compounded by Philip Wakem&#x27;s friendship with Lucy and Stephen; he and Maggie are reintroduced and Philip&#x27;s love for her is rekindled, while Maggie, no longer isolated, enjoys the clandestine attentions of Stephen Guest, putting her past profession of love for Philip in question. Lucy intrigues to throw Philip and Maggie together on a short rowing trip down the Floss but Stephen unwittingly takes a sick Philip&#x27;s place.

When Maggie and Stephen find themselves floating down the river, negligent of the distance they have covered, he proposes that they board a passing boat to the next substantial city, Mudport and get married. Maggie is too tired to argue about it. Stephen takes advantage of her weariness and hails the boat. They are taken on board and during the trip to Mudport, Maggie struggles between her love for Stephen and her duties to Philip and Lucy, which were established when she was poor, isolated and dependent on them for what good her life contained. Upon arrival in Mudport, she rejects Stephen and makes her way back to St Ogg&#x27;s, where she lives for a brief period as an outcast, Stephen having fled to Holland. Although she immediately goes to Tom for forgiveness and shelter, he sends her away, telling her that she will never again be welcome under his roof. Lucy and Philip forgive her, in a moving reunion and in an eloquent letter, respectively.

Maggie&#x27;s brief exile ends when the river floods. Having struggled through the waters in a boat to find Tom at the old mill, she sets out with him to rescue Lucy Deane and her family. In a brief tender moment, the brother and sister are reconciled from all past differences. When their boat capsizes, the two drown in an embrace.

==Themes==

Like other novels by George Eliot, &quot;The Mill on the Floss&quot; articulates the tension between circumstances and the spiritual energies of individual characters struggling against those circumstances. A certain determinism is at play throughout the novel, from Mr Tulliver&#x27;s inability to keep himself from &quot;going to law&quot;, and thereby losing his patrimony and bankrupting his family, to the series of events that sets Maggie and Stephen down the river and past the point of no return. Characters such as Mr Tulliver are presented as unable to determine their own course rationally, while various external forces, be it the drift of the river or the force of a flood, are presented as determining the courses of people for them. On the other hand, Maggie&#x27;s ultimate choice not to marry Stephen, and to suffer both the privation of his love and the ignominy of their botched elopement demonstrates a final triumph of free will.

Critics have asserted that Maggie&#x27;s need for love and acceptance is her underlying motivation throughout &quot;The Mill on the Floss&quot;, claiming that the conflicts that arise in the novel stem from her frustrated attempts at gaining this acceptance. Alan Bellringer has claimed that &quot;[t]he two main themes of the novel, growing up and falling in love, lend themselves to amusement, but it is stunted growth and frustrated love that are emphasized.&quot; Commentators have often focused on the constant rejection of Maggie&#x27;s talents and mannerisms by her family and society. Even the cultural norms of her community deny her intellectual and spiritual growth. According to Elizabeth Ermarth, &quot;[t]hey are norms according to which she is an inferior, dependent creature who will never go far in anything, and which consequently are a denial of her full humanity.&quot;

==Adaptations==
The story was adapted as a film, &quot;The Mill on the Floss&quot;, in 1937, and as a BBC series in 1978 starring Christopher Blake, Pippa Guard, Judy Cornwell, Ray Smith and Anton Lesser.

In 1994, Helen Edmundson adapted the book for the stage, in a production performed by Shared Experience.

A television film adaptation of the novel was first aired on 1 January 1997. Maggie Tulliver is portrayed by Emily Watson and Mr Tulliver by Bernard Hill. The production was filmed at the historic Chatham Dockyard in Kent for exterior street scenes.

A radio dramatisation in five one-hour parts was broadcast on BBC7 in 2009.

<text>War bonds (sometimes referred to as victory bonds, particularly in propaganda) are debt securities issued by a government to finance military operations and other expenditure in times of war without raising taxes to an unpopular level. They are also a means to control inflation by removing money from circulation in a stimulated wartime economy. War bonds are either retail bonds marketed directly to the public or wholesale bonds traded on a stock market. Exhortations to buy war bonds have often been accompanied by appeals to patriotism and conscience. Retail war bonds, like other retail bonds, tend to have a yield which is below that offered by the market and are often made available in a wide range of denominations to make them affordable for all citizens.

==Before World War I==
Governments throughout history have needed to borrow money to fight wars. Traditionally they dealt with a small group of rich financiers such as Jakob Fugger and Nathan Rothschild, but no particular distinction was made between debt incurred in war or peace. An early use of the term &quot;war bond&quot; was for the $ raised by the US Congress in an Act of 14 March 1812, to fund the War of 1812, but this was not aimed at the general public. Until July 2015, perhaps the oldest bonds still outstanding as a result of war were the British Consols, some of which were the result of the refinancing of incurring debts during the Napoleonic Wars, but these were redeemed following the passing of the Finance Act 2015.

==World War I==
===Austria and Hungary===
The government of Austria-Hungary knew from the early days of the First World War that it could not count on advances from its principal banking institutions to meet the growing costs of the war. Instead, it implemented a war finance policy modeled upon that of Germany: in November 1914, the first funded loan was issued. As in Germany, the Austro-Hungarian loans followed a prearranged plan and were issued at half yearly intervals every November and May. The first Austrian bonds paid 5% interest and had a five-year term. The smallest bond denomination available was 100 kronen.

Hungary issued loans separately from Austria in 1919, after the war and after it had separated from Austria, in the form of stocks that permitted the subscriber to demand repayment after a year&#x27;s notice. Interest was fixed at 6%, and the smallest denomination was 50 korona. Subscriptions to the first Austrian bond issue amounted to $; those of the first Hungarian issue amounted to $.

The limited financial resources of children were tapped through campaigns in schools. The initial minimum Austrian bond denomination of 100 kronen still exceeded the means of most children, so the third bond issue, in 1915, introduced a scheme whereby children could donate a small amount and take out a bank loan to cover the rest of the 100 kronen. The initiative was immensely successful, eliciting funds and encouraging loyalty to the state and its future among Austro-Hungarian youth. Over kronen was collected in the first three &quot;child bond&quot; issues.

===Canada===

Canada&#x27;s involvement in the First World War began in 1914, with Canadian war bonds called &quot;Victory Bonds&quot; after 1917. The first domestic war loan was raised in November 1915, but not until the fourth campaign of November 1917 was the term Victory Loan applied. The First Victory Loan was a 5.5% issue of 5, 10 and 20 year gold bonds in denominations as small as $50. It was quickly oversubscribed, collecting $ or about $50 per capita. The Second and Third Victory Loans were floated in 1918 and 1919, bringing another $. For those who could not afford to buy Victory Bonds, the government also issued War Savings Certificates. The government awarded communities who bought large amounts of bonds Victory Loan Honour Flags.

===Germany===

Unlike France and Britain, at the outbreak of the First World War Germany found itself largely excluded from international financial markets. This became most apparent after an attempt to float a major loan on Wall Street failed in 1914. As such, Germany was largely limited to domestic borrowing, which was induced by a series of war credit bills passing the Reichstag. This took place in many forms; however, the most publicised were the public war bond () drives.

Nine bond drives were conducted over the length of the war and, as in Austria-Hungary, the loans were issued at six-month intervals. The drives themselves would often last several weeks, during which there was extensive use of propaganda via all possible media. Most bonds had a rate of return of 5% and were redeemable over a ten-year period, in semi-annual payments. Like war bonds in other countries, the German war bonds drives were designed to be extravagant displays of patriotism and the bonds were sold through banks, post offices and other financial institutions.

As in other countries, the majority investors were not individuals but institutions and large corporations. Industries, university endowments, local banks and even city governments were the prime investors in the war bonds. In part because of intense public pressure and in part due to patriotic commitment the bond drives proved extremely successful, raising approximately marks in funds. Although extremely successful the war bond drives only covered two-thirds of war-related expenditures. Meanwhile, the interest payable on the bonds represented a growing expense which required further resources to pay it.

===United Kingdom===

In August 1914, the gold reserves of the Bank of England, and effectively of all banking institutions in Great Britain, amounted to £. The banks feared the declaration of war would trigger a run on the banks, so the Chancellor David Lloyd George extended the August bank holiday for three days to allow time for the passing of the Currency and Bank Notes Act 1914, by which Britain left the gold standard. Under this Act the Treasury issued £ (equivalent to £ in 2013) of paper banknotes, without the backing of gold, with which the banks could repay their obligations. Leading banker Walter Leaf described these Treasury notes as &quot;essentially a War Loan free of interest, for an unlimited period, and as such was a highly profitable expedient from the point of view of the Government&quot;.

The first interest-bearing War Loan was issued in November 1914 at an interest rate of 3.5%, to be redeemed at par value in 1925–28. It raised £; £ at face value as it was issued at a 5% discount. It was revealed in 2017 that public subscriptions amounted to £91m, and the balance had been subscribed by the Bank of England, under the names of then governor, John Gordon Nairne, and his deputy Ernest Harvey. It was followed by £ of a second War Loan in June 1915, at 4.5%. £ of this was accounted for by conversion of the 3.5% issue, and a further £ by holders of 2.5% and 2.75% Consols, who were also allowed to transfer to the higher interest rate. The government also pledged that if they issued War Loans at even higher interest, holders of the 4.5% bonds might also convert to the new rate. In his memoirs Lloyd George stated his regret that his successor Reginald McKenna increased the interest rate at a time when investors had few alternatives. Not only did it directly increase the nation&#x27;s annual interest payments by £ but it meant interest rates were higher throughout the economy during the post-war depression.

Compared to France, the British government relied more on short-term financing in the form of treasury bills and exchequer bonds during World War I. Treasury bills provided the bulk of British government funds in 1916, and were available for terms of 3, 6, 9 and 12 months at an interest rate of 5%. Although these were not formally designated as war bonds, advertising was explicit about their purpose. This April 1916 advertisement for 5% Exchequer bonds was typical of the time: &quot;Lend Your Money to Your Country. The soldier does not grudge offering his life to his country. He offers it freely, for his life may be the price of Victory. But Victory cannot be won without money as well as men, and your money is needed. Unlike the soldier, the investor runs no risk. If you invest in Exchequer Bonds your money, capital and interest alike, is secured on the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom, the premier security of the world.&quot;

Policy changed when Asquith&#x27;s government fell in December 1916 and Bonar Law became Chancellor in the new coalition government. The third War Loan was launched in January 1917 at a 5% discount to face value and paying 5% interest (or 4% tax-free for 25 years), a rate Lloyd George described as &quot;penal&quot;. Holders of existing War Loans, Treasury Bills and War Expenditure Certificates could convert to the 5% issue. Of the £ raised by the 5% War Loan, only £ was new money; the rest was conversions of £ of 4.5% Loan, £ of Exchequer Bonds and £ of Treasury Bills. Labour politician Tom Johnston would later write of the 1917 War Loan &quot;No foreign conqueror could have devised a more complete robbery and enslavement of the British Nation&quot;.

On 30 June 1932 Neville Chamberlain announced that the Government would exercise its right to call in the 5% War Loan, offering a choice of taking cash or continuing the loan at 3.5%. Although they were obliged to give 90 days&#x27; notice of such a change, a 1% tax-free cash bonus was offered to holders who acted by 31 July. This conversion saved the government about £ net per year. On 3 December 2014 the UK Government announced it would redeem the outstanding war loans on 9 March 2015.

===United States===
In 1917 and 1918, the United States government issued Liberty Bonds to raise money for its involvement in World War 1. An aggressive campaign was created by Secretary of the Treasury William Gibbs McAdoo to popularize the bonds, grounded largely as patriotic appeals. The Treasury Department worked closely with the Committee on Public Information in developing Liberty Bond campaigns. The resulting propaganda messages often borrowed heavily from military colloquial speech.

The government used famous artists to make posters and used movie and stage stars to host bond rallies. Al Jolson, Ethel Barrymore, Marie Dressler, Elsie Janis, Theda Bara, Fatty Arbuckle, Mabel Normand, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin were among the celebrities who made public appearances promoting the patriotic element of purchasing Liberty Bonds. Chaplin also made a short film, &quot;The Bond&quot;, at his own expense for the drive. Even the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts sold bonds under the slogan &quot;Every Scout to Save a Soldier&quot;. The campaign spurred community efforts across the country to sell the bonds and was a great success resulting in over-subscriptions to the second, third, and fourth bond issues. According to the Massachusetts Historical Society, &quot;Because the first World War cost the federal government more than $ (by way of comparison, total federal expenditures in 1913 were only $), these programs became vital as a way to raise funds.&quot;

==World War II==

===Canada===
Canada&#x27;s involvement in the Second World War began when Canada declared war on Nazi Germany on September 10, 1939, one week after the United Kingdom. Approximately half of the Canadian war cost was covered by War Savings Certificates and war bonds known as &quot;Victory Bonds&quot; as in World War I. War Savings Certificates began selling in May 1940 and were sold door-to-door by volunteers as well as at banks, post offices, trust companies and other authorised dealers. The certificates matured after seven years, providing a return of $5 for every $4 invested. Initially, individual ownership was limited to $500 in maturities per year, though this cap was later raised to $600. Although the effort raised $ in funds and was successful in financially involving millions of Canadians in the war effort, it only provided the Government of Canada with a fraction of what was needed.

The sale of Victory Bonds proved far more successful financially. There were ten wartime and one postwar Victory Bond drives. Unlike the War Savings Certificates, there was no purchase limit to Victory Bonds. The bonds were issued with maturities of between six and fourteen years with interest rates ranging from 1.5% for short-term bonds and 3% for long-term bonds and were issued in denominations of between $50 and $100,000. Canadians bought $ worth of Victory Bonds or some $550 per capita with businesses accounting for half of all Victory Bond sales. The first Victory Bond issue in February 1940 met its goal of $ in less than 48 hours, the second issue in September 1940 reaching its goal of $ almost as quickly.

When it became apparent that the war would last a number of years the war bond and certificate programs were organised more formally under the National War Finance Committee in December 1941, directed initially by the president of the Bank of Montreal and subsequently by the Governor of the Bank of Canada. Under the more honed direction the committee developed strategies, propaganda and the wide recruitment of volunteers for bonds drives. Bond drives took place every six months during which no other organization was permitted to solicit the public for money. The government spent over $ on marketing which employed posters, direct mailing, movie trailers (including some by Walt Disney in cooperation with the newly established National Film Board of Canada&#x27;s animation department that the former partner helped establish), radio commercials and full page advertisements in most major daily newspapers and weekly magazines. Realistic staged military invasions, such as the If Day scenario in Winnipeg, Manitoba, were even employed to raise awareness and shock citizens into purchasing bonds.

===Germany===
The Nazi regime never attempted to convince the general populace to buy long-term war bonds as had been done during the First World War. The Reich government did not want to present any perceived form of public referendum on the war, which would be the indirect result if a bond drive did poorly. Rather, the regime financed its war efforts by borrowing directly from financial institutions, using short-term war bonds as collateral. German bankers, with no demonstration of resistance, agreed to taking state bonds into their portfolios. Financial institutions transferred their money to the Finance Department in exchange for promissory notes. Through this strategy, 40 million bank and investment accounts were quietly converted into war bonds, providing the Reich government with a continuous supply of money. Likewise, German bank commissioners compelled occupied Czechoslovakia to buy up German war bonds. By the end of the war, German war bonds accounted for 70% of investments held by Czechoslovakian banks.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, the National Savings Movement was instrumental in raising funds for the war effort during both world wars. During World War II a &quot;War Savings Campaign&quot; was set up by the War Office to support the war effort. &quot;Local savings weeks&quot; were held which were promoted with posters with titles such as &quot;Lend to Defend the Right to Be Free&quot;, &quot;Save Your Way to Victory&quot; and &quot;War Savings Are Warships&quot;.

===United States=== 

By the summer of 1940, the victories of Nazi Germany against Poland, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, and Luxembourg brought urgency to the government, which was discreetly preparing for possible United States involvement in World War II. Of principal concern were issues surrounding war financing. Many of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s advisers favored a system of tax increases and enforced savings program as advocated by British economist John Maynard Keynes. In theory, this would permit increased spending while decreasing the risk of inflation. However, Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr. preferred a voluntary loan system and began planning a national defense bond program in the fall of 1940. The intent was to unite the attractiveness of the baby bonds that had been implemented in the interwar period with the patriotic element of the Liberty Bonds from the First World War.
Henry Morgenthau Jr. sought the aid of Peter Odegard, a political scientist specialised in propaganda, in drawing up the goals for the bond program. On the advice of Odegard the Treasury began marketing the previously successful baby bonds as &quot;defense bonds&quot;. Three new series of bond notes, Series E, F and G, would be introduced, of which Series E would be targeted at individuals as &quot;defense bonds&quot;. Like the baby bonds, they were sold for as little as $18.75 and matured in ten years, at which time the United States government paid the bondholder $25. Large denominations of between $50 and $1000 were also made available, all of which, unlike the Liberty Bonds of the First World War, were non-negotiable bonds. For those who found it difficult to purchase an entire bond at once, 10-cent savings stamps could be purchased and collected in Treasury-approved stamp albums until the recipient had accumulated enough stamps for a bond purchase. The name of the bonds was eventually changed to War Bonds after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, which resulted in the United States entering the war.

The War Finance Committee was placed in charge of supervising the sale of all bonds, and the War Advertising Council promoted voluntary compliance with bond buying. Popular contemporary art was used to help promote the bonds such as &quot;Any Bonds Today?&quot;, a 1942 Warner Bros. theatrical cartoon. More than a quarter of a billion dollars&#x27; worth of advertising was donated during the first three years of the National Defense Savings Program. The government appealed to the public through popular culture. Norman Rockwell&#x27;s painting series, the &quot;Four Freedoms&quot;, toured in a war bond effort that raised $. Bond rallies were held throughout the country with famous celebrities, usually Hollywood film stars, to enhance the bond advertising effectiveness. Many motion pictures during the time, especially war dramas (a form of propaganda itself), included a graphic shown during the closing credits advising patrons to &quot;Buy War Bonds and Stamps&quot;, which were sometimes sold in the lobby of the theater. The Music Publishers Protective Association encouraged its members to include patriotic messages on the front of their sheet music like &quot;Buy U.S. Bonds and Stamps&quot;. Over the course of the war 85 million Americans purchased bonds totalling approximately $.

Named after the 1942 Hollywood Victory Caravan, a 1945 Paramount-produced film promoted bond sales after the end of World War II. The short subject included Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Alan Ladd, William Demarest, Franklin Pangborn, Barbara Stanwyck, Humphrey Bogart, and others.
Aside from movies and music, there were countless other programs held throughout the states to encourage the purchasing of war bonds. One such promotion that was held, at the least, in Nebraska and Montana, allowed for citizens to &quot;get Hitler&#x27;s goat,&quot; a play on the phrase &quot;to get someone&#x27;s goat&quot; meaning to make someone angry or annoyed. The goat would be held up for &quot;auction&quot; with the money going directly towards war bonds. According to one source, the auctioning of &quot;Hitler&#x27;s goat&quot; in Nebraska in 1942 raised $90,000 in War Bond sales.

The National Service Board for Religious Objectors offered civilian bonds in the United States during World War II, primarily to members of the historic peace churches as an alternative for those who could not conscientiously buy something meant to support the war. These were U.S. Government Bonds not labelled as defense bonds. In all, 33,006 subscriptions were sold for a total value of $, mostly to Mennonites, Brethren, and Quakers.

Research has shown that parties to a conflict at the beginning of warfare can obtain cheap financing. As the conflict develops, bond yields increase but only to a certain level. Once a certain threshold is exceeded, there is no increase in the yield. The phenomenon was explained by the clientele effect, i.e., the differentiation of groups that purchase financial instruments. The first issuances of war bonds are mainly covered by investors seeking profit and the so-called &quot;patriotic demand&quot;. As the conflict develops, the risk increases, and only patriotic demand persists.

==After World War II==
=== South Africa ===
In the late 1970s and 1980s South Africa issued Defence Bonus Bonds in order to fund the border wars in Angola and Namibia and to fund the Defence Industry that was necessary due to sanctions.

===Iraq===
During the Iran-Iraq War, the Iraqi government issued war bonds to finance the war. Each war bond cost 100 dinars.

===Ukraine===
On 1 March 2022, following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian government announced it would issue war bonds to pay its armed forces. Between March and May 2022, around $270 million equivalent of bonds were sold, maturing in one year and yielding 11 percent. The bonds were sold in small units of 1,000 hryvnias, with over 70,000 buyers.

=== Canada ===
On 28 October 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Canada announced that they would sell government-backed, 5-year bonds to raise money for Ukraine. Canada completed issuing C$500 million of the Ukraine Sovereignty Bond at the end of November 2022.

<doc id="401487" wikidata="Q275633" url="?curid=401487" title="Margaret Mahy">
<text>Margaret Mahy (21 March 1936 – 23 July 2012) was a New Zealand author of children&#x27;s and young adult books. Many of her story plots have strong supernatural elements but her writing concentrates on the themes of human relationships and growing up. She wrote more than 100 picture books, 40 novels and 20 collections of short stories. At her death she was one of thirty writers to win the biennial, international Hans Christian Andersen Medal for her &quot;lasting contribution to children&#x27;s literature&quot;.

Mahy won the annual Carnegie Medal twice. It recognises the year&#x27;s best children&#x27;s book by a British subject, and she won for both &quot;The Haunting&quot; (1982) and &quot;The Changeover&quot; (1984). (As of 2012 just seven writers have won two Carnegies, none three.) She was also a highly commended runner up for &quot;Memory&quot; (1987).

Among her children&#x27;s books, &quot;A Lion in the Meadow&quot; and &quot;The Seven Chinese Brothers&quot; and &quot;The Man Whose Mother was a Pirate&quot; are considered national classics. Her novels have been translated into Te Reo Māori, German, French, Spanish, Dutch, Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, Finnish, Italian, Japanese, Catalan and Afrikaans. In addition, some stories have been translated into Russian, Chinese and Icelandic.

The Margaret Mahy Playground in the Christchurch Central City is named in her honour.

==Early life==
Mahy was born in 1936, the eldest of five children. She was raised in her birthplace of Whakatāne. Her father, Francis George Mahy, was a bridge builder and often told his children adventure stories which later influenced Mahy&#x27;s writing. Mahy&#x27;s mother Helen Penlington was a teacher. She was regarded as a &#x27;slow learner&#x27;, and particularly hated mathematics. Her first published story was &quot;Harry is Bad&quot;, written at age seven (published in the children&#x27;s page of the &quot;Bay of Plenty Beacon&quot;). Later she showed it to children when she visited schools, to let them know that they could write stories at any age.

She went to the local high school, where she was acknowledged as a talented swimmer.

==Education==
Mahy completed her B.A. at Auckland University College (1952–1954) and Canterbury University College, graduating in 1955. In 1956 she trained at the New Zealand Library School, Wellington as a librarian.

==Personal life==
From around 1965, Mahy lived at Governors Bay on the Banks Peninsula, Canterbury, in the South Island of New Zealand. She was a solo mother and raised two daughters there. At age 62, Mahy had her right shoulder tattooed with the picture of a skull with a rose in its teeth. She was writing about a person being tattooed and considered the tattoo research to enable her to describe the experience convincingly.

In 2007, Mahy adopted a cavoodle puppy she named Honey, because of her colour. Mahy died at the Nurse Maude Hospice in St Albans, Christchurch on 23 July 2012, aged 76. She had been diagnosed with an inoperable cancerous jaw tumour in April 2012 and had been moved to a hospice about nine days before her death.

Her final book &quot;Tale of a Tail&quot;, published posthumously in 2014, was commissioned by Polish photographer Tomasz Gudzowaty.

==Career==

She worked as a librarian in Petone, the School Library Service in Christchurch, and in 1976 was appointed Children&#x27;s Librarian at Canterbury Public Library. During this time many of her stories were published in the &quot;New Zealand School Journal&quot; and her first book saw her become known internationally. &quot;A Lion in the Meadow&quot; was a &quot;School Journal&quot; story from 1965. It was published in 1969 by J.M. Dent in the U.K. and Franklin Watts in the U.S., as a large-format picture book illustrated by Jenny Williams. Also in 1969, William Heinemann Ltd and Watts published another large-format picture book, &quot;The Dragon of an Ordinary Family&quot; with illustrations by Helen Oxenbury, who won the Greenaway Medal from the British librarians recognising the year&#x27;s best illustrated children&#x27;s book. There were three others in that same year.

Mahy wrote several fantasy novels, including &quot;The Haunting&quot; and &quot;The Changeover&quot;.

Mahy became a full-time writer in 1980. She went on to win numerous book awards and honours for her contributions to New Zealand and to children&#x27;s literature. One was an honorary Doctor of Letters from the University of Canterbury. In 1985 she established the Margaret Mahy Fees Scholarship at the University of Canterbury.

The Margaret Mahy Medal Award was established by the New Zealand Children&#x27;s Book Foundation in 1991 to provide recognition of excellence in children&#x27;s literature, publishing and literacy in New Zealand.

On 6 February 1993, Mahy was appointed a Member of the Order of New Zealand, for her contributions to children&#x27;s literature. In March 2009 she was commemorated as one of the Twelve Local Heroes and a bronze bust of her was unveiled outside the Christchurch Arts Centre.

In 2010 her book &quot;Kaitangata Twitch&quot; was adapted for television and aired on Māori Television. Directed by Yvonne Mackay and produced by The Production Shed.TV, the series includes a cameo appearance by Margaret Mahy in a library scene.

==Awards==
The biennial Hans Christian Andersen Award conferred by the International Board on Books for Young People is the highest recognition available to a writer or illustrator of children&#x27;s books. Mahy received the writing award in 2006. Jury president Jeffrey Garrett wrote in the press release:

In awarding the 2006 Hans Christian Andersen Medal for Writing to Margaret Mahy, the jury has recognized one of the world&#x27;s most original re-inventors of language. Mahy&#x27;s language is rich in poetic imagery, magic, and supernatural elements. Her oeuvre provides a vast, numinous, but intensely personal metaphorical arena for the expression and experience of childhood and adolescence. Equally important, however, are her rhymes and poems for children. Mahy&#x27;s works are known to children and young adults all over the world.

Mahy won the Carnegie Medal in 1982 for &quot;The Haunting&quot;. In 1984 she won the medal again for &quot;The Changeover&quot;. In 2005 she won the Phoenix Award for The Catalogue of the Universe.

The Margaret Mahy Award, named for Mahy, is presented annually to &quot;a person who has made a significant contribution to the broad field of children&#x27;s literature and literacy&quot;. Mahy was the first recipient of the award in 1991. Lectures by the winners are published, the standard of which was set by Mahy&#x27;s inaugural lecture, &quot;Surprising Moments&quot;.

In 2013, the top prize for young adult fiction at the New Zealand Post Children&#x27;s Book Awards was renamed the Margaret Mahy Book of the Year award. Also in 2013, a playground based on her work was commissioned to be built in Christchurch&#x27;s East Frame.

* Italian Premier Grafico Award, &quot;The Wind Between the Stars&quot;, 1976
* Dutch Silver Pencil Award, &quot;The Boy Who Was Followed Home&quot;, 1977

* New Zealand Post Children&#x27;s Book Awards, Children&#x27;s Book of the Year, 2011, &quot;The Moon and Farmer McPhee&quot;—picture book written by Mahy and illustrated by David Elliot

The Phoenix Award from the Children&#x27;s Literature Association designates the best English-language children&#x27;s book that did not win a major award when it was originally published twenty years earlier. It is named for the mythical bird phoenix, which is reborn from its ashes, to suggest the book&#x27;s rise from obscurity. Mahy is one of three authors to win it twice (1985 to 2012).

==Works==
Mahy wrote more than 100 picture books, 40 novels and 20 collections of short stories published between 1969 and 2014.

<text>Ruritan National is a service club located in small towns and rural areas in the United States. It aims to achieve &quot;Fellowship, Goodwill and Community Service&quot;. The local clubs are autonomous from the national organization. Many Ruritan clubs sponsor local clubs or chapters of 4-H, the National FFA Organization, or a Boy Scouts of America troop.

== History ==
The first Ruritan Club, the Holland Ruritan Club, was founded on April 16, 1928 at the Hollland Hotel in Holland, Virginia, now part of Suffolk, Virginia. Its founders, Thomas V. Downing and Jack Gwaltney, wanted to establish a civic organization for rural communities. Its purpose was &quot;to make the rural community a better place in which to live by bringing together farmers and business and professional men in a community in the interest of community service, fellowship, and goodwill.&quot;

Ruritan was chartered on May 21, 1928; this is recognized by the group as its founding date. Along with Downing and Gwaltney, some of the charter members were W. E Beale, L. H. Gardner, J. D. Rawles, Hugh V. White, and H. L. Worrell Sr. 

Almost immediately, the club added chapters in nearby counties. It was known as the National Order of Ruritans by 1930. Dr. J. M. Bland of Boykins, Virginia was its first national president. It held its first annual convention on January 15, 1932, in Suffolk, Virginia. Ten clubs and 200 delegates attended the convention. In 1935, the club spread outside of Virginia with the founding of a chapter in Sunbury, North Carolina. 

On May 25, 1958, a nine-foot-tall granite monument was dedicated in Holland, Virginia to commemorate the founding of Ruritan National. By 1958, Ruritan National had more than 700 clubs in seventeen states, with more than 24,000 members who were a mixture of farmers and businessmen. Its diverse areas of service were reflected by its standing committees of the era:

* Welfare, Health, and Sanitation
* Recreation and Community Goodwill
* Agriculture and Farm Income
* Rural Church
* Rural Utilties
* Public Highways, Streets, and Buildings
* Education
* Industry and Business Methods
* Home and Home Beautification
* Conservation and Forestry
* Youth
* Safety

On January 17, 1965, the Ruritan held its 35th national convention in Philadelphia with World War I ace Eddie Rickenbacker as the keynote speaker. That year, it was the sixth largest civic club in the United States with more than 1,000 clubs in nineteen states.

In 2024, Ruritan National has over 23,000 members in more than 900 local clubs. Its national headquarters is located in Dublin, Virginia. Its publication is the &quot;Ruritan Magazine&quot;.

== Symbols ==
The club&#x27;s name was suggested by Daisy Nurney, a reporter for &quot;The Virginian-Pilot&quot;. The name Ruritan was created from the Latin words for country (&quot;run&quot;) and small town (&quot;tan&quot;). Its motto is &quot;Fellowship, Community Service, and Goodwill&quot;.

In 1930, the club selected its official insignia, a round gold pin with the words Ruritan and National in black, surrounding a black circle with the words &quot;Rus&quot; and &quot;Urbs&quot; that encircle the letter &quot;R&quot; in gold.

== Activities ==
Ruritan Clubs meet monthly. Unlike most community service organizations, Ruritan rarely has national programs, instead setting priorities based on the needs of its local communities. Many clubs provide and supervise community recreational centers, sponsor Little League and other athletic programs, build community parks and sports pitches, sponsor anti-litter campaigns, help the sick and needy, and provide a wide range of other activities to help improve their communities. Many Ruritan clubs sponsor local clubs or chapters of 4-H, the National FFA Organization, or a troop of the Boy Scouts of America or Girl Scouts of the USA.

== Organization ==
The Ruritan organization is made up of Ruritan Clubs. Club officers consist of a president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer, immediate past president, and 1st-, 2nd- and 3rd-year directors. Clubs are organized into zones, overseen by a zone governor, and zones are organized into districts.

<doc id="401493" wikidata="Q845743" url="?curid=401493" title="Democratic Party of Albania">
<text>The Democratic Party of Albania (, PDSH or PD) is a conservative political party in Albania. It has been the largest opposition party in the country since 2013.

The Democratic Party of Albania was founded in 1990 as a strongly anti-communist party with the majority of its followers being from politically persecuted dissidents of the Communist dictatorial regime of Enver Hoxha. In international relations, it is an associate member of the European People&#x27;s Party and a full member of International Democracy Union.

==History==

===Foundation===
The Democratic Party was founded on 12 December 1990 with major involvement from Avdyl Matoshi, Azem Hajdari, Sali Berisha and Gramoz Pashko, and Arben Imami, Edmond Budina, Eduart Selami, Genc Ruli, Merita Zaloshnja, Aleksandër Meksi involved only in the early stages of the formation of the party. It is the first opposition party in Albania after more than 45 years of a communist leadership. The party was created as an anti-communist movement.

===1991: First pluralist elections===
The First Pluralist would be the first elections since 1923 to allow more than one Party. The Ruling Labour Party of Albania during the 1991 Elections had the biggest advantage during the election. Including the influence over the media. There was no opportunity for the Democratic party and other Anti-Communist parties in the election to influence the rural country side. The Democratic Party platform had promised the transformation of living standards through membership in the European Community, strong connection with the United States and other Western nations, &quot;Gastarbeiter&quot; in German factories abroad, and immediate steps towards a free-market economy. Which resulted in the Democratic Party coming in second place in results. The Democratic party would ultimately win in the next Election.

===1992: Second pluralist parliamentary presidential elections===
The Democratic Party of Albania won the parliamentary elections of 22 March 1992, the second free and fair elections after many decades of mandatory and single communist party candidate elections. Sali Berisha its leader was elected as the second President of Albania, which at the time had executive powers, and Aleksandër Meksi as Prime Minister. Sali Berisha with significant contribution in the formation of the party, and Aleksandër Meksi with minor contribution. The second pluralist government of Albania governed by the Democratic Party and its leader was tasked with executing reforms to turn the country from a communist style everything in the hands of the government rule into a democratic country based in free markets, property rights, individual rights, and without interference of the government in the private lives of its citizens.

===1996 Presidential elections===
Four years after the second free and fair elections, new free and fair election in respect to the new Constitution of Albania adopted in 1991, conform other democratic western and European countries were due. The elections were held on 26 May 1996. The main and well known political leaders of the party that governed the Republic of Albania for more than 45 years, under a ruthless regime, were no longer a major participant in the election. However, the party itself and its new and less known leaders at the time of the former Labor Party, the main political party during the communist regime was reformed, changed its platform conform to other parties that held the same beliefs, mainly left-wing philosophies, conform democratic standards, and its name to the Socialist Party of Albania. It was the only serious opponent and challenger to the Democratic Party of Albania in the 26 May 1996 presidential elections. During these elections the international election observers were limited in numbers. 

The Democratic Party of Albania and its allies were able to win more than 71 seats in the parliament, on the presidential election of 26 May 1996, enough to form the majority and stay in government. Sali Berisha and Aleksandër Meksi respectively remained President and Prime Minister of the Republic of Albania, until new parliamentary election were called due to the Ponzi-Schemes crisis, held on 29 June 1997.

===1997 parliamentary elections===
The Ponzi-Schemes lead to civil unrest that culminated in early spring of 1997. The crisis was deeply severe. The government led by the Democratic Party of Albania and its leader due to civil unrest was not able to function properly in many parts of the country, especially in the south of Albania. The fact that these Ponzi-Schemes were endorsed by the government (led by the Democratic Party of Albania) or suggested people to invest in these schemes and the majority of the people who invested in these Ponzi-Schemes blamed the Democratic Party&#x27;s government for the failure of the Ponzi-Schemes. As a result of this crisis and internal civil unrest new parliamentary election were called on 29 June 1997 to sooth the situation. As a result of these elections the Democratic Party of Albania lost its elections to its opposition party, Socialist Party of Albania.

A little more than a year after the Socialist Party of Albania took control of the government on 12 September 1998 Azem Hajdari one of the founding members of the Democratic Party of Albania and a very important political figure within the party was assassinated. His assassination lead to further unrest in Albania. The Democratic Party of Albania was in opposition and its leader, the former President of Albania (with executive powers), who was in the leadership of the party during this time, Sali Berisha, accused the government of the Socialist Party of Albania as the perpetrator of the assassination of Azem Hajdari.

===2001 parliamentary elections===
On 24 June 2001, the next parliamentary elections on the due date as provided by the constitution were held. These elections were also lost by the Democratic Party of Albania although not as deeply as the previous elections. The Democratic Party alleged irregularities and did not accept the result of the elections. ODHIR and OSCE which were involved in monitoring the elections and as an independent party declared on their final report that the elections were marked by irregularities and that repeated voting in some electoral zones increased the violations and irregularities of the election. To what extent these irregularities and violations helped the Socialist Party of Albania win in such a wide range was not determined or conclusive in the election report.

===2005 parliamentary elections===
In the 2005 parliamentary elections, the Democratic Party won 56 of the 140 seats and its allies won 18 under the call &quot;Time to Change&quot; (&quot;Koha per Ndryshim&quot;). Two other parties also joined the new coalition (PAA of the left wing &amp; PBDNJ of the Greek minority, with 4 and 2 seats, respectively). This meant that with a combined total of 79 seats, the Democratic Party and its allies were able to form a government with Sali Berisha becoming Prime Minister. One of his priorities was Albanian integration to NATO, an objective he accomplished in 2009 when Albania and Croatia were accepted as members. 

The biggest tragedy after the 1997 Albanian civil unrest happened in Saturday 15 March 2008 which is known as 2008 Gërdec explosions. Officially, Albanian authorities confirmed 26 deaths in the explosions. Officials report the number of injured people at over 300. According to figures published by the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office, 2,306 buildings were damaged or destroyed in the explosions. Of these, 318 houses were destroyed completely, 200 buildings were seriously damaged, and 188 buildings were less seriously damaged.

===2009 parliamentary elections===
On 28 June 2009, the next elections that were due on the date provided were held. The elections were won by the Democratic Party with its electoral alliance. Alliance of Change (&quot;Aleance e Ndryshimit).&quot; The alliance consisted of mostly Right Wing parties. Shortly before the election the Ethnic Greek unity party had switched to join the Center Left alliance of Edi Rama Unification for Change (&quot;Bashkimi për Ndryshim)&quot;. Due to the PDIU, a party representing the interest of Cham Albanians whose properties in Greece were seized after the Second world war. Nevertheless the Democratic party with its alliance had won 70 out of the 140 seats. It was unclear whether the Democratic party and its alliance had won 70 or 71. On 4 July 2009, Ilir Meta leader of LSI announced he had accepted a deal to form a working majority coalition. Making PD and its alliance have 74 out of 140.

===2013 parliamentary elections===
After the defeat in the 2013 parliamentary election, Berisha announced his resignation as party leader. A one-member-one-vote election was held for the first time on 23 July 2013, in which Lulzim Basha defeated his opponent Sokol Olldashi and was elected Chairman of the Democratic Party.

On 30 September 2014, a national congress of the Democratic Party was held to elect a new leadership and to announce a tough reform of the party. On the 26th anniversary of the Democratic Party, party leader Basha announced his program for the further modernization and democratisation of the party ahead of the 2017 parliamentary elections. After previously promising that 35% of the parliamentary candidates would consist of members from the youth movement of the Party, Basha now announced a limitations of all mandates of the party leaders to a two-year term, and the full democratisation of the internal election process.

===2017 parliamentary elections===
On 18 February 2017, members of the Democratic Party and other opposition parties, under the leadership of Basha pitched a giant tent outside the Prime Minister&#x27;s office in Tirana after thousands of protesters rallied to demand free elections and a technocrat government. The opposition protest further escalated into a larger political conflict. The Democratic Party and its allies refused to register to take part in the 25 June general election, until the government will accept their conditions to secure a free and democratic election.

===2021 parliamentary elections===
On 16 February 2019, the Albanian opposition led by Lulzim Basha protested for three years under his leadership, with the goals of removing Edi Rama from power. The opposition coalition consists of the Democratic Party (PD), the Socialist Movement for Integration, the Party for Justice, Integration and Unity, the Republican Party and other minor opposition parties. After the first protests opposition MPs decided to resign in mass from parliament, more than 40 seats were vacated. Due to the protests the opposition parties decided to boycott the local elections that were previously set to be held on 30 June 2019. Lulzim Basha formed an alliance with minority parties, forming the Democratic Party Alliance for Change (&quot;Partia Demokratike - Aleanca për Ndryshim).&quot; However this was not enough to deliver the Democratic Party a victory, it did however increase its seats in Parliament and the 2021 Albanian parliamentary election would be the third loss in a row for the Democratic Party. 

Following the election aftermath Sali Berisha had been declared Persona Non Grata by the United States. Which resulted in Lulzim Basha expelling Berisha from the parliamentary group and begun causing party internal fighting between members of Basha&#x27;s faction and Berisha&#x27;s faction. On 11 December at Arena Kombëtare, the Berisha faction held a &quot;national council&quot; to remove Basha and his members from the party leadership. More than 4,446 voted for the removal of Lulzim Basha from party leader of the Democratic Party. However, Basha did not recognize the results and the party internal feuds continued. 

On 6 March 2022, Partial Local elections for specifically, Shkodër, Durrës, Dibër, Vorë, Rrogozhinë, and Lushnjë. Many supporters had left to support Sali Berisha&#x27;s coalition &quot;House of Freedom&quot; during the party internal feuds. Which resulted in the Democratic Party being placed third and second. While Sali Berisha and his coalition coming first place in Shkodër. Following the defeats in the partial local elections, Lulzim Basha stepped down which resulted in Sali Berisha and Enkelejd Alibeaj having disputes over leadership of the party. Although not just Alibeaj and Berisha, members of Berisha&#x27;s factions as well began to have disputes between each other, specifically between Belind Këlliçi and Evi Kokalari. Këlliçi had accused Kokalari that she had been attacking him and claimed that &quot;Kokalari took time to hit me with some of the accusations and slanders used by the Socialists against me.&quot; As a result Këlliçi had taken Kokalari to trial and responded to the accusations that Evi Kokalari has made against him with a defamation lawsuit, where he demands 1 million Lek in compensation. 

On 7 July 2022, a big protest was held in Tirana in front of the Prime Minster&#x27;s Office, Sali Berisha as &quot;de facto&quot; Chairman of the party had called it weeks before. The protest was called under the motto and slogan &quot;Albania in Danger&quot; (Shqipëria në rrezik). Sali Berisha stated that the future of Albania and the Albanians was at risk and the stake of the fatherland was in their hands. On 17 May 2023, Enkelejd Alibeaj resigned from every post of the Democratic Party of Albania. Gazment Bardhi would succeed Alibeaj which would continue the party split. On 24 May 2023, Lulzim Basha would make an appearance claiming he was the leader of the Democrats again succeeding Bardhi who served as interim.

== Ideology ==
The Democratic Party of Albania is considered to be a centre-right party that holds conservative and conservative liberal views. However, the party also has members that hold national conservative views. The Democratic Party supports NATO and are pro-European, and support the accession of Albania to the European Union.

==Headquarters==
The party&#x27;s headquarters are located in Tirana, capital city of Albania, not too far away from the Albanian Parliament (approximately 50 meters away). The newspaper Rilindja Demokratike, the Democratic Party&#x27;s main news organ, is located at the same headquarters building.

==Election results==
== Party split (2021–2024) ==
Originally Gazment Bardhi was on the side of Lulzim Basha as leader of the Democrats. However, on 4 September 2023 he ordered all Albanian democrat politicians and even opposition members who were elected on the Democratic Party list to meet him on 5 September 2023, just one day before Lulzim Basha expelled 500 members for going against his leadership. 40 of the 59 elected showing up in person and 3 showing up to the meeting online. While one was pro for the unification was not able to be neither online or in person. Bardhi argued that this unification is needed. Stating that the party has seen too many failures now. Both Berisha and Bardhi agreed to settle their differences and united their groups. However, Lulzim Basha was against this unified opposition. 
==Party chairs==
== Appeal in the General Judicial Court (2024) ==
The Court of Appeal decided not to accept Enkelejd Alibeaj&#x27;s complaint about the seal and leadership of the Democratic Party, thus affirming the official Democratic Party&#x27;s emblem and logo as belonging to Sali Berisha. By rejecting Alibeaj&#x27;s appeal, the Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the First Instance, presided over by Judge Agron Zhukri, which recognized the decisions made during the Assembly held on December 11, as convened by the Re-establishment faction.

This decision establishes that the chairman of the official Democratic Party is former Prime Minister Sali Berisha, who is currently under the security measure of &quot;House Arrest&quot; following investigations initiated by SPAK.

The Appellate panel&#x27;s decision was rendered by Judges Alma Ahmeti, Iliba Bezati, and Elona Toro, and is final. At the onset of the session, the Re-establishment faction submitted a preliminary request to dismiss Alibeaj&#x27;s appeal, arguing that they were not a legitimate party.

The legal representative, Ivi Kaso, urged the enforcement of the &quot;Zhukri&quot; decision and the acknowledgment of the resolutions passed during the National Assembly of December 11, 2021, a position upheld by the court. Kaso stated, &quot;The right of annulment belongs only to the party that initiated the legal proceedings.&quot;

Reacting to the media at the conclusion of the Appeal session, Flamur Noka expressed that truth prevailed and urged all Democrats to unite within the Democratic Party. &quot;Today is a momentous day for all Democrats. Despite facing injustice, honorable judges have emerged to uphold the truth that had been obscured for three years. The truth is that Democrats determine all matters concerning the Democratic Party through their own will. Our message is clear: Democrats stand united and are pleased with the decision.&quot;

&quot;However, today marks a setback for the ruling regime, as united Democrats now have a singular mission: to dismantle this narco-regime and restore hope to Albanians. The era of a divided opposition has ended, giving way to a united front. Today, Albania has a resolute Democratic Party and a unified opposition that will amplify the voice of the people,&quot; concluded Noka.

<doc id="401494" wikidata="Q1933828" url="?curid=401494" title="Shadow volume">
<text>Shadow volume is a technique used in 3D computer graphics to add shadows to a rendered scene. It was first proposed by Frank Crow in 1977 as the geometry describing the 3D shape of the region occluded from a light source. A shadow volume divides the virtual world in two: areas that are in shadow and areas that are not.

The stencil buffer implementation of shadow volumes is generally considered among the most practical general purpose real-time shadowing techniques for use on modern 3D graphics hardware. It has been popularized by the video game &quot;Doom 3&quot;, and a particular variation of the technique used in this game has become known as Carmack&#x27;s Reverse.

Shadow volumes have become a popular tool for real-time shadowing, alongside the more venerable shadow mapping. The main advantage of shadow volumes is that they are accurate to the pixel (though many implementations have a minor self-shadowing problem along the silhouette edge, see &quot;construction&quot; below), whereas the accuracy of a shadow map depends on the texture memory allotted to it as well as the angle at which the shadows are cast (at some angles, the accuracy of a shadow map unavoidably suffers). However, the technique requires the creation of shadow geometry, which can be CPU intensive (depending on the implementation). The advantage of shadow mapping is that it is often faster, because shadow volume polygons are often very large in terms of screen space and require a lot of fill time (especially for convex objects), whereas shadow maps do not have this limitation.

== Construction ==

In order to construct a shadow volume, project a ray from the light source through each vertex in the shadow casting object to some point (generally at infinity). These projections will together form a volume; any point inside that volume is in shadow, everything outside is lit by the light.

For a polygonal model, the volume is usually formed by classifying each face in the model as either facing toward the light source or facing away from the light source. The set of all edges that connect a toward-face to an away-face form the &quot;silhouette&quot; with respect to the light source. The edges forming the silhouette are extruded away from the light to construct the faces of the shadow volume. This volume must extend over the range of the entire visible scene; often the dimensions of the shadow volume are extended to infinity to accomplish this (see &quot;optimization&quot; below.) To form a closed volume, the front and back end of this extrusion must be covered. These coverings are called &quot;caps&quot;. Depending on the method used for the shadow volume, the front end may be covered by the object itself, and the rear end may sometimes be omitted (see &quot;depth pass&quot; below).

There is also a problem with the shadow where the faces along the silhouette edge are relatively shallow. In this case, the shadow an object casts on itself will be sharp, revealing its polygonal facets, whereas the usual lighting model will have a gradual change in the lighting along the facet. This leaves a rough shadow artifact near the silhouette edge which is difficult to correct. Increasing the polygonal density will minimize the problem, but not eliminate it. If the front of the shadow volume is capped, the entire shadow volume may be offset slightly away from the light to remove any shadow self-intersections within the offset distance of the silhouette edge (this solution is more commonly used in shadow mapping).

The basic steps for forming a shadow volume are:

# Find all silhouette edges (edges which separate front-facing faces from back-facing faces)
# Extend all silhouette edges in the direction away from the light-source
# Add a &quot;front-cap&quot; and/or &quot;back-cap&quot; to each surface to form a closed volume (may not be necessary, depending on the implementation used)

== Stencil buffer implementations ==

After Crow, in 1991 Tim Heidmann showed how to use the stencil buffer to render shadows with shadow volumes quickly enough for use in real time applications. There are three common variations to this technique, depth pass, depth fail, and exclusive-or, but all of them use the same process:

# Render the scene as if it were completely in shadow.
# For each light source:
## Using the depth information from that scene, construct a mask in the stencil buffer that has holes only where the visible surface is not in shadow.
## Render the scene again as if it were completely lit, using the stencil buffer to mask the shadowed areas. Use additive blending to add this render to the scene.

The difference between these three methods occurs in the generation of the mask in the second step. Some involve two passes, and some only one; some require less precision in the stencil buffer.

Shadow volumes tend to cover large portions of the visible scene, and as a result consume valuable rasterization time (fill time) on 3D graphics hardware. This problem is compounded by the complexity of the shadow casting objects, as each object can cast its own shadow volume of any potential size onscreen. See &quot;optimization&quot; below for a discussion of techniques used to combat the fill time problem.

=== Depth pass ===

Heidmann proposed that if the front surfaces and back surfaces of the shadows were rendered in separate passes, the number of front faces and back faces in front of an object can be counted using the stencil buffer. If an object&#x27;s surface is in shadow, there will be more front facing shadow surfaces between it and the eye than back facing shadow surfaces. If their numbers are equal, however, the surface of the object is not in shadow. The generation of the stencil mask works as follows:

# Disable writes to the depth and color buffers.
# Use back-face culling.
# Set the stencil operation to increment on depth pass (only count shadows in front of the object).
# Render the shadow volumes (because of culling, only their front faces are rendered).
# Use front-face culling.
# Set the stencil operation to decrement on depth pass.
# Render the shadow volumes (only their back faces are rendered).

After this is accomplished, all lit surfaces will correspond to a 0 in the stencil buffer, where the numbers of front and back surfaces of all shadow volumes between the eye and that surface are equal.

This approach has problems when the eye itself is inside a shadow volume (for example, when the light source moves behind an object). From this point of view, the eye sees the back face of this shadow volume before anything else, and this adds a −1 bias to the entire stencil buffer, effectively inverting the shadows. This can be remedied by adding a &quot;cap&quot; surface to the front of the shadow volume facing the eye, such as at the front clipping plane. There is another situation where the eye may be in the shadow of a volume cast by an object behind the camera, which also has to be capped somehow to prevent a similar problem. In most common implementations, because properly capping for depth-pass can be difficult to accomplish, the depth-fail method (see below) may be licensed for these special situations. Alternatively one can give the stencil buffer a +1 bias for every shadow volume the camera is inside, though doing the detection can be slow.

There is another potential problem if the stencil buffer does not have enough bits to accommodate the number of shadows visible between the eye and the object surface, because it uses saturation arithmetic. (If they used arithmetic overflow instead, the problem would be insignificant.)

Depth pass testing is also known as z-pass testing, as the depth buffer is often referred to as the z-buffer.

=== Depth fail ===
Around the year 2000, several people discovered that Heidmann&#x27;s method can be made to work for all camera positions by reversing the depth. Instead of counting the shadow surfaces in front of the object&#x27;s surface, the surfaces behind it can be counted just as easily, with the same end result. This solves the problem of the eye being in shadow, since shadow volumes between the eye and the object are not counted, but introduces the condition that the rear end of the shadow volume must be capped, or shadows will end up missing where the volume points backward to infinity.

# Disable writes to the depth and color buffers.
# Use front-face culling.
# Set the stencil operation to increment on depth fail (only count shadows behind the object).
# Render the shadow volumes.
# Use back-face culling.
# Set the stencil operation to decrement on depth fail.
# Render the shadow volumes.

The depth fail method has the same considerations regarding the stencil buffer&#x27;s precision as the depth pass method. Also, similar to depth pass, it is sometimes referred to as the z-fail method.

William Bilodeau and Michael Songy discovered this technique in October 1998, and presented the technique at Creativity, a Creative Labs developer&#x27;s conference, in 1999. Sim Dietrich presented this technique at both GDC in March 1999, and at Creativity in late 1999. A few months later, William Bilodeau and Michael Songy filed a US patent application for the technique the same year entitled &quot;Method for rendering shadows using a shadow volume and a stencil buffer&quot;. John Carmack of id Software independently discovered the algorithm in 2000 during the development of &quot;Doom 3&quot;.

=== Exclusive-or ===
Either of the above types may be approximated with an exclusive-or variation, which does not deal properly with intersecting shadow volumes, but saves one rendering pass (if not fill time), and only requires a 1-bit stencil buffer. The following steps are for the depth pass version:

# Disable writes to the depth and color buffers.
# Set the stencil operation to XOR on depth pass (flip on any shadow surface).
# Render the shadow volumes.

== Optimization ==

* One method of speeding up the shadow volume geometry calculations is to utilize existing parts of the rendering pipeline to do some of the calculation. For instance, by using homogeneous coordinates, the &quot;w&quot;-coordinate may be set to zero to extend a point to infinity. This should be accompanied by a viewing frustum that has a far clipping plane that extends to infinity in order to accommodate those points, accomplished by using a specialized projection matrix. This technique reduces the accuracy of the depth buffer slightly, but the difference is usually negligible. See 2002 paper &quot;Practical and Robust Stenciled Shadow Volumes for Hardware-Accelerated Rendering&quot;, C. Everitt and M. Kilgard, for a detailed implementation.
* Rasterization time of the shadow volumes can be reduced by using an in-hardware scissor test to limit the shadows to a specific onscreen rectangle.
* NVIDIA has implemented a hardware capability called the &quot;depth bounds test&quot; that is designed to remove parts of shadow volumes that do not affect the visible scene. (This has been available since the GeForce FX 5900 model.) A discussion of this capability and its use with shadow volumes was presented at the Game Developers Conference in 2005.
* Since the depth-fail method only offers an advantage over depth-pass in the special case where the eye is within a shadow volume, it is preferable to check for this case, and use depth-pass wherever possible. This avoids both the unnecessary back-capping (and the associated rasterization) for cases where depth-fail is unnecessary, as well as the problem of appropriately front-capping for special cases of depth-pass.
* On more recent GPU pipelines, geometry shaders can be used to generate the shadow volumes.
* On systems that do not support geometry shaders, vertex shaders can also be used to create shadow volumes by selectively extruding vertices that already reside within GPU memory.

<text>Sir Philip Francis, GCB (22 October 1740 – 23 December 1818) was a British Whig politician, pamphleteer and colonial administrator best known for being the possible identity the anonymous writer Junius. A strong opponent of East India Company official Warren Hastings, Francis&#x27; accusations against him led to Hastings&#x27; impeachment by the Parliament of Great Britain.

==Early life==
Born in Dublin, he was the only son of Dr Philip Francis (c. 1708–1773), a man of some literary celebrity in his time, known by his translations of Horace, Aeschines and Demosthenes. He received the rudiments of an excellent education at a free school in Dublin, and afterwards spent a year or two (1751–1752) under his father&#x27;s roof at Skeyton Rectory, Norfolk, and elsewhere, and for a short time he had Edward Gibbon as a fellow-pupil. In March 1753, he entered St Paul&#x27;s School, London, where he remained for three and a half years, becoming a proficient classical scholar.

In 1756, immediately on his leaving school, he was appointed to a junior clerkship in the secretary of state&#x27;s office by Henry Fox (afterwards Lord Holland), with whose family Dr Francis was at that time on intimate terms; and this post he retained under the succeeding administration. In 1758 he was employed as secretary to General Bligh in the expedition against Cherbourg; and in the same capacity he accompanied the Earl of Kinnoull on his special embassy to the court of Portugal in 1760.

In January 1769 Philip Francis returned to London from a &#x27;riotous fortnight&#x27; in Bath where he lived as a &#x27;raike&#x27;; later that year he became one of the original shareholders in the project to build a new Assembly Rooms in the city.

==Entry into politics==
In 1761, he became personally known to William Pitt the Elder who, recognising his ability and discretion, made use of his services as private amanuensis from time to time. In 1762 he was appointed to a principal clerkship in the war office, where he formed a warm friendship with Christopher D&#x27;Oyly, Deputy-Secretary at War, whose dismissal from office in 1772 was hotly resented by Junius. On 27 February 1762 he married Elizabeth Macrabie, the daughter of a retired London merchant. His daughter, Catherine Francis (d. 11 September 1823) married George James Cholmondeley (b. 22 February 1752, d. 5 November 1830), the son of Mary Woffington.

His official duties brought him into direct relations with many who were well versed in the politics of the time. In 1763 the great constitutional questions arising out of the arrest of Wilkes began to be sharply canvassed. It was natural that Francis, who from a very early age had been in the habit of writing occasionally to the newspapers, should be eager to take an active part in the discussion, though his position as a government official made it necessary that his intervention should be carefully disguised.

==Political career==

He is known to have written to the &quot;Public Ledger&quot; and &quot;Public Advertiser&quot;, as an advocate of the popular cause, on many occasions about and after the year 1763; he frequently attended debates in both Houses of Parliament, especially when American questions were being discussed; and between 1769 and 1771 he is also known to have been favourable to the scheme for the overthrow of the Grafton government and afterwards of that of Lord North, and for persuading or forcing Lord Chatham into power. In January 1769 the first of the Letters of Junius appeared, and the series continued till 21 January 1772. They had been preceded by others under signatures such as &quot;Candor&quot;, &quot;Father of Candor&quot;, &quot;Anti-Sejanus&quot;, &quot;Lucius&quot;, and &quot;Nemesis&quot;.

The authorship of the letters has been assigned to Francis on a variety of grounds, including a computer-aided analysis of the Junius texts in the 1960s. Comparing stylistic patterns from the letters with attributed writings of the period allowed a reasonable statistical conclusion to be drawn that Francis was by far the most likely author. Some evidence to support the claim of Sir Philip Francis is given in Macaulay&#x27;s History of England in which Macaulay mentions the likely reference to Henry Luttrell, who although obscure to the British of the 1770s, would have been well known to the Irish and particularly to Sir Philip Francis who spent the early part of his life near Luttrellstown.

In March 1772 Francis finally left the war office, and in July of the same year he left England for a tour through France, Germany and Italy, which lasted until the following December. On his return he was contemplating emigration to New England, when in June 1773 Lord North, on the recommendation of Lord Barrington, appointed him a member of the newly constituted supreme council of Bengal at a salary of 10,000 pounds per annum. Along with his colleagues Monson and Clavering he reached Calcutta in October 1774, and a long struggle with Warren Hastings, the governor-general, immediately began. These three, actuated probably by petty personal motives, combined to form a majority of the council in harassing opposition to the governor-general&#x27;s policy; and they even accused him of corruption, mainly on the evidence of Nuncomar.

The death of Monson in 1776, and of Clavering in the following year, made Hastings again supreme in the council. But a dispute with Francis, more than usually embittered, led in August 1780 to a minute being delivered to the council board by Hastings, in which he stated that he judged of the public conduct of Mr Francis by his experience of his private, which he had found to be &quot;void of truth and honor&quot;; such an opinion was aggravated by the various affairs Francis had during his stay in Calcutta, including one with Catherine Grand. A duel was the consequence, in which Francis received a dangerous wound. Though his recovery was rapid and complete, he did not choose to prolong his stay abroad. He arrived in England in October 1781, and was received with little favour.

Little is known of the nature of his occupations during the next two years, except that he was untiring in his efforts to procure first the recall, and afterwards the impeachment, of his hitherto triumphant adversary. In 1783 Fox produced his India Bill, which led to the overthrow of the coalition government. In 1784 Francis was returned to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for the borough of Yarmouth, Isle of Wight; and although he took an opportunity to disclaim every feeling of personal animosity towards Hastings, this did not prevent him, on the return of the latter in 1785, from doing all in his power to bring forward and support the charges which ultimately led to the impeachment resolutions of 1787. Although excluded by a majority of the House of Commons from the list of the managers of that impeachment, Francis was nonetheless its most energetic promoter, supplying his friends Edmund Burke and Richard Sheridan with all the materials for their eloquent orations and burning invectives.

At the general election of 1790 he was returned member for Bletchingley. He sympathised warmly and actively with the French revolutionary doctrines, expostulating with Burke on his vehement denunciation of the same. In 1793 he supported Earl Grey&#x27;s motion for a return to the old constitutional system of representation, and so earned the title to be regarded as one of the earliest promoters of the cause of parliamentary reform; and he was one of the founders of the Society of the Friends of the People.

==Later life==
The acquittal of Hastings in April 1795 disappointed Francis of the governor-generalship, and in 1798 he had to submit to the additional mortification of a defeat in the general election. He was once more successful, however, in 1802, when he sat for Appleby, and it seemed as if the great ambitions of his life were about to be realised when the Whig party came into power in 1806. His disappointment was great when the governor-generalship was, owing to party exigencies, conferred on Sir Gilbert Elliot (Lord Minto); he declined, it is said, soon afterwards the government of the Cape, but accepted a KB. Though re-elected for Appleby in 1806, he failed to secure a seat in the following year; and the remainder of his life was spent in comparative privacy.

Among the later productions of his pen were, besides the Plan of a Reform in the Election of the House of Commons, pamphlets entitled:
*&quot;Proceedings in the House of Commons on the Slave Trade&quot; (1796),
*&quot;Reflections on the Abundance of Paper in Circulation and the Scarcity of Specie&quot; (1810),
*&quot;Historical Questions Exhibited&quot; (1818), and 
*&quot;Letter to Earl Grey on the Policy of Great Britain and the Allies towards Norway&quot; (1814).

His first wife, by whom he had six children, died in 1806, and in 1814 he married his second wife, Emma Watkins, who long survived him, and who left voluminous manuscripts relating to his biography. In his domestic relations he was exemplary, and he lived on terms of mutual affection with a wide circle of friends.

<doc id="401500" wikidata="Q3809451" url="?curid=401500" title="John Manners, 3rd Duke of Rutland">
<text>John Manners, 3rd Duke of Rutland KG PC (21 October 1696 – 29 May 1779) was an English nobleman, the eldest son of John Manners, 2nd Duke of Rutland and Catherine Russell. Styled Marquess of Granby from 1711, he succeeded to the title in 1721, cutting short a brief career in the House of Commons, where he had represented Rutland as a Whig.

==Biography==
He held a variety of government and court positions including Lord Lieutenant of Leicestershire 1721–1779, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster 1727–1736, Lord Steward of the Household 1755–1761, and Master of the Horse 1761–1766.

He represented Rutland in the British Parliament from January 1719 to February 1721. He was one of the directors of the Royal Academy of Music, establishing a London opera company which commissioned numerous works from Handel, Bononcini and others.

In 1722 he became a Knight of the Order of the Garter and in 1727 was sworn of the Privy Council. He supported the creation of London&#x27;s Foundling Hospital and was one of its founding governors when it received its royal charter in 1739. The city of Rutland, Vermont is named after him.

==Art collection==
John Manners, the 3rd Duke, was a collector of art. He started buying in 1742 and for two decades bought paintings, drawings and prints at the London art auctions. Agents bought for him at other auctions and he bought privately too, through dealers. On the death of his father, John, the 2nd Duke of Rutland, in 1721, the 3rd Duke had inherited the family collection of paintings acquired by his forebears including Old Masters and an uninterrupted run of ancestral portraits.

He liked small pictures and was reported to have said that &quot;A man did not deserve a good picture that would not carry it home himself&quot;. As a result, he spent less on his collection than other collectors who preferred bigger, more expensive paintings. For example, he did not buy on par with his grandson, Charles, the 4th Duke of Rutland, friend and patron of Sir Joshua Reynolds. Nevertheless, he was a serious collector whose eye and temperament led him to buy smaller works of all the major European painters including Raphael, Titian, Bassano, Veronese, Guido Reni, and the Italianate northerners, especially Claude and the two Poussins. He is known to have spent some £3,210 on paintings but this figure must be taken as approximate and open to revision if new records come to light. By way of comparison, the building of his London townhouse in the same period, cost some £4,432.

For an unknown reason, the Duke sold 200 paintings in 1758–1759.

==Chess variant==
In 1747 the Duke launched into the world an expanded form of the game of chess, on a board with 140 squares (ten ranks and fourteen files), each player having, in addition to the usual array, a concubine (combining the moves of rook and knight), two crowned rooks (rooks with the added power of taking a diagonal step), two extra bishops, an extra knight, and six extra pawns. This game became popular among the leading players of the time (Abraham Janssen, for example), and is still played.

==Family==
In 1717 he married Bridget Sutton, the 17-year-old heiress of Robert Sutton, 2nd Baron Lexinton. They had eleven children, most of whom died young:
*Lady Catherine Rachel Manners (b. 1718), died young
*Lady Caroline Manners (b. spring 1719), died young
*Lady Frances and Lady Bridget Manners (d. 30 December 1719), twins died young
*John Manners, Marquess of Granby (1721–1770)
*Lord Robert Manners-Sutton (1722–1762)
*Lord George Manners-Sutton (1723–1783)
*Lord William Manners (29 July 1724 – 11 March 1730), died young
*Lady Leonora Manners (d. June 1740), died young
*Lady Frances Manners (c. 1726 – 3 February 1739), died young
*Lord Frederick Manners (b. 17 February 1728)

He died in 1779 at the age of 82 at Rutland House, Knightsbridge, London and was buried in the Belvoir Castle mausoleum.

<doc id="401502" wikidata="Q81661" url="?curid=401502" title="Elefant">
<text>Elefant (German for &quot;elephant&quot;) was a heavy tank destroyer (self propelled anti-tank gun) used by German &quot;Panzerjäger&quot; (anti-tank units) during World War II. Ninety-one units were built in 1943 under the name Ferdinand (after its designer Ferdinand Porsche) using VK 45.01 (P) tank hulls which had been produced for the Tiger I tank before the competing Henschel design had been selected.

Following their use at the battle of Kursk, in January to April 1944 the surviving &quot;Ferdinand&quot;s received modifications and upgrades. They were renamed &quot;Elefant&quot; in May 1944. The official German designation was Panzerjäger Tiger&quot; (P)and the [[List of Sd.Kfz. designations|ordnance inventory designation]] was Sd.Kfz.&quot; 184.

==Development history==

Porsche GmbH had manufactured about 100 chassis for their unsuccessful proposal for the Tiger tank, the &quot;Porsche Tiger&quot;, in the Nibelungenwerk factory in Sankt Valentin, Austria. Both the successful Henschel proposal and the Porsche design used the same Krupp-designed turret—the Henschel design had its turret more-or-less centrally located on its hull, while the Porsche design placed the turret much closer to the front of the superstructure. Since the competing Henschel Tiger design was chosen for production, the Porsche chassis were no longer required for the Tiger tank project. It was therefore decided that the Porsche chassis were to be used as the basis of a new heavy panzerjäger, &quot;Ferdinand&quot;, mounting Krupp&#x27;s newly developed &quot;Panzerjägerkanone 43/2&quot; (PaK 43) anti-tank gun. This precise long-range weapon was intended to destroy enemy tanks before they came within their own range of effective fire.

The &quot;Ferdinand&quot; was intended to supplant previous light &quot;panzerjägers&quot;, such as the &quot;Marder II&quot; and &quot;Marder III&quot;, in the offensive role. A similar gun was used in the lightly armored &quot;Hornisse&quot; (later known as &quot;Nashorn&quot;) tank destroyer and was also used in the Tiger II heavy tank, built at the same time.

==Design==
===Chassis===
The petrol–electric transmission made it much easier to relocate the engines than would be the case on a mechanical-transmission vehicle (the engines can be mounted anywhere, and only the length of the power cables needs to be altered, as opposed to re-designing the driveshafts and locating the engines for the easiest routing of powershafts to the gearbox), so without the forward-mounted turret of the Porsche Tiger prototype, the twin engines were relocated to the front, where the turret had been, leaving room ahead of them for the now-isolated driver and assistant-driver only. The now empty rear half of the hull was covered with a heavily armored, full five-sided casemate with slightly sloped upper faces and armored solid roof, and turned into a crew compartment, mounting a single 8.8 cm Pak 43 cannon in the forward face of the casemate. The initial &quot;Ferdinand&quot; conversions were thus among the first physical examples of what became known as the dedicated &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; tank destroyers, all of which had completely enclosed casemates, but most of which were designed with the casemate as an integral component of the vehicle&#x27;s hull armor from the start; the Ferdinand was more of a cross between the earlier, thinly armored, high-profile, &quot;three-side&quot; (open-top/rear) &quot;Panzerjäger&quot; and the later, more heavily armored, lower-profile, rear-engined &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot;. The driver and assistant driver were in a separate compartment at the front. As the engines were placed in the middle, the assistant driver and the driver were isolated from the rest of the crew and could be addressed only by intercom.

Add-on armor of 100 mm was bolted to the front plates, increasing the plate&#x27;s thickness to 200 mm and adding another 5 tonnes of weight.

===Drive===
The two Porsche Type 101 15-litre gasoline V-10 air-cooled engines each developing 310 PS in each vehicle had considerable problems with cooling difficulties and excess oil consumption during testing. An improved type 101/2 engine with better cooling seems not to have been installed. The Porsche engines were replaced by two 300 PS (296 hp; 221 kW) Maybach HL120 TRM engines. The engines drove a single Siemens-Schuckert 500 kVA generator each, which powered two Siemens 230 kW (312.7 PS) individual-output electric motors, one each connected to each of the rear sprockets. The electric motors also acted as the vehicle&#x27;s steering unit. This &quot;petrol–electric&quot; drive delivered 0.11 km/L (909 litres/100 km or 0.26 miles per gallon) off-road and 0.15 km/L (667 litres/100 km or 0.35 mpg) on road at a maximum speed of 10 km/h off-road and 30 km/h on road. In addition to this high fuel consumption and poor performance, the vehicle was maintenance-intensive; the sprockets needed to be changed every 500–900 km. Furthermore, the radiators for the water-cooled Maybach engines took up extra space in the cramped engine compartment, and the engines often over-heated.

Porsche had experience of this form of petrol–electric transmission extending back to 1901, when he designed a car that used it.

Suspension for the &quot;slack track&quot; equipped &quot;Ferdinand&quot; consisted of six twin bogies (three per side) with longitudinal torsion bars, without any overlapping wheels or return rollers. There are sprockets at both ends of the vehicle. The drive sprockets are at the rear, while the front pair contain a drum brake system.

===Armament===
The vehicle was fitted with an 88 mm &quot;Panzerjägerkanone&quot; 43/2 gun (early designation &quot;8,8 cm Stu.K. 43/1&quot;). This 71 caliber-long gun had originally been developed as a replacement for the well-known 88 mm anti-aircraft gun that had been used against Allied tanks in the Western Desert Campaign and on the Eastern Front. It had a much longer barrel than the L/56 guns, which gave it a higher muzzle velocity, and fired a different, longer cartridge. These improvements gave the 88 mm L/71 significantly improved armor penetration ability over the earlier 88 mm. Although it lost the competition to the 8.8 cm Flak 41 and never became an anti-aircraft weapon, it was turned into the very successful Pak 43 anti-tank gun.

As fitted, the gun was capable of 28° traverse and -8° and +14° depression/elevation.

==Production==
Ninety-one existing &quot;Porsche Tiger&quot; chassis were converted (chassis number 150010 to 150100). The work was completed in just a few months from March to May 1943. Three Bergepanzer Ferdinands (the recovery vehicle variant of the Ferdinand tank destroyer) were produced at the Nibelungenwerke in summer 1943.

==Combat history==
===Kursk===
&quot;Ferdinand&quot;s first saw combat in the Battle of Kursk, where eighty-nine were committed, the largest deployment of the vehicle during its service.

The &quot;Ferdinand&quot; was optimized for destroying Soviet T-34 medium tanks and 76.2 mm anti-tank guns from behind the front line with its 88 mm gun at a range of over 3 kilometres, a role which it performed well. Its most significant problem at Kursk was mine damage and mechanical failure. Any damage to the tracks or suspension negated the protection of the armor, as crews were forced to dismount and attempt repairs. The immense weight of the &quot;Ferdinand&quot; made towing difficult: the standard armored recovery vehicle in German service at the time was the &quot;Bergepanzer IV&quot;, a variant of the Panzer IV tank. Although it could tow a single Panzer IV without assistance it was insufficient for larger vehicles; a Tiger I heavy tank required three Bergepanzer IVs to be towed, and the &quot;Ferdinand&quot; needed five linked together to pull the vehicle off the field.

In addition, the &quot;Ferdinand&quot; was hampered by flaws such as the lack of peripheral vision blocks, or a machine gun as secondary defensive armament. Apocryphal reports say that Soviet infantry, quickly recognizing this flaw, could easily hide in their trenches until the &quot;Ferdinand&quot; advanced through their lines, then swarm the vehicle with their grenades and Molotov cocktails from the sides. However, losses to Soviet infantry are disputed in after-action reports. On the other hand, Heinz Guderian himself complained in his autobiography that the &quot;Elefant&quot;, much as other failed designs, suffered from lack of close-range protection against infantry assaults.

In the initial stages of the Kursk battle, when the Germans were on the offensive, vehicles could be recovered and repaired with relative peace at night; this at first allowed the majority of knocked-out &quot;Ferdinand&quot;s to be rescued, repaired and returned to duty. However, once the tide of battle had turned against the Germans and they fell back on the defensive, with fewer vehicles to spare, functional &quot;Ferdinands&quot; with minor damage to their tracks or suspensions had little hope of recovery, and crews were usually forced to destroy the vehicle to prevent a mostly intact &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; from falling into the hands of the Soviets.

The units were deployed at a company level, sometimes sub-divided into platoons, with infantry or tanks in accompaniment to protect the flanks and rear of the vehicles. On the attack, this &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; was a first-strike vehicle; while in defence, they often comprised a mobile reserve used to blunt enemy tank assaults.

===Post-Kursk modifications===
The surviving &quot;Ferdinands&quot; fought various rear-guard actions in 1943 until they were recalled to be modified and overhauled, partially based on battle experience gained at Kursk. Returned to the Nibelungenwerke factory in Austria, on 2 January 1944, upgrades commenced on 48 of the 50 surviving vehicles. The most visible exterior upgrades were 1) the addition of a ball-mounted MG 34 in the hull front, 2) a new commander&#x27;s cupola (modified from the standard StuG III cupola) for improved vision, 3) re-designed armored engine grates (for better bullet and shrapnel protection) and 4) the application of &quot;Zimmerit&quot; anti-magnetic mine paste.

The first eleven complete and updated &quot;Ferdinand&quot;s were ready in February 1944. They were issued to the 1st company of the 653rd Heavy Panzerjäger Battalion (German: &quot;schwere Panzerjäger-Abteilung 653&quot;, &quot;sPzJgrAbt 653&quot;), which was immediately deployed in Italy in response to the Allied landing at Anzio-Nettuno. The remaining 37 vehicles were completed in April, issued to the 2nd and 3rd companies of &quot;sPzJgrAbt&quot; 653, and sent by train to the Tarnopol battles in Ukraine.

On 1 May 1944, the Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH, the German Army High Command,) issued an order to formally change the name from &quot;Ferdinand&quot; to &quot;Elefant&quot;. This order forbade future use of &quot;Ferdinand&quot; and even directed units in the field to edit their records. Though there is a belief that the name change was linked to the January–April mechanical upgrades to the &quot;Ferdinand&quot; panzerjäger; the name change was purely administrative in nature.

Three &quot;Bergepanzer Elefant&quot; armoured recovery vehicles were converted from Ferdinand/Elefant hulls and issued with the 2nd and 3rd companies of sPzJgrAbt 653 to the Eastern Front in the summer of 1944.

Although the modifications improved the vehicles, some problems could never be fully fixed. In 1944, &quot;Elefant&quot;s served on the Italian front, but were rather ineffective as their weight of nearly 70 tonnes did not allow them to use most Italian roads and bridges. As at Kursk, most losses were not as a direct result from combat, but resulted when mechanical breakdowns and lack of spare parts compelled their crews to destroy and abandon them. One company of &quot;Elefant&quot;s saw action during the Soviets&#x27; January 1945 Vistula–Oder offensive in Poland, and the last surviving vehicles were in combat at Zossen during the Battle of Berlin.

==Conclusions==
The &quot;Ferdinand&quot;/&quot;Elefant&quot; may have been the most successful mass-produced tank destroyer employed during the war in kills per loss, reaching an average claimed ratio of approximately 10:1. During the Battle of Kursk, sPzJgrAbt 653 claimed to have knocked out 320 enemy tanks, for the loss of 13 &quot;Ferdinands&quot;. This impressive average ratio was due to its superior firepower and protection, which gave it an enormous advantage when used in head-on combat or a static defensive role. However, poor mobility and mechanical unreliability greatly diminished its operational capability.

The &quot;Elefant&quot; and &quot;Nashorn&quot; were both superseded by the &quot;Jagdpanther&quot;. All three vehicles mounted the same gun, with only some minor differences between them. The &quot;Jagdpanther&quot;—a true &quot;jagdpanzer&quot;—was a successor to the other two, combining acceptable mobility and good, sloped armour while retaining the excellent gun, mostly solving the reliability, mobility, and/or protection problems that the earlier vehicles had.

==Survivors==
Only two of these vehicles survived the war.

One &quot;Ferdinand&quot; was captured by Soviet forces at Kursk, and it was sent to NII BT testing facility in Kubinka, Moscow for testing. It was on display at the Kubinka Tank Museum outside Moscow. Its gun mantlet was painted red. Its chassis number was unknown, either No. 150090 or No. 501.

An &quot;Elefant&quot;, numbered &quot;102&quot; of sPz. Jgr. Abt 653, was captured at Anzio by the Americans, and is now part of the United States Army Ordnance Training Support Facility&#x27;s collection at Fort Gregg-Adams, VA. This example was restored to display condition in 2007–2008, as documented on the show &quot;Tank Overhaul&quot;, but not in its original paint scheme. The &quot;Elefant&quot; was loaned to the Bovington Tank Museum in Dorset, UK as part of the museum&#x27;s &quot;Tiger Collection&quot; display from April 2017 until January 2019, and later returned to the United States. This display brought all the members of the Tiger family together in one place for the first time (the Sturmtiger was represented by its gun).

<text>The Liberal Democratic Union () is a political party in Albania.

==History==
It was founded in 1995 with the name Social Democratic Union of Albania. The party began as a breakaway faction of the Social Democratic Party of Albania. The break-away was motivated by the Social Democratic Party leaving the governing coalition with the Democratic Party and the desire of some members to maintain their ministerial posts or other high governmental appointments. Initially, the break-away faction, consisting of those wanting to keep their posts, was known as the Social Democratic Union, later changing its name to the Liberal Democratic Union.

In the 2001 elections it was part of the Union for Victory (&quot;Bashkimi për Fitoren&quot;) coalition which received 37.1% of the vote and 46 members of parliament. On its own, the Liberal Democratic Union consistently has received under 1% of the vote in general elections.

In the 2005 elections, BLD was part of the Alliance for Freedom, Justice, and Welfare. BLD won one seat through the proportional quota of the Democratic Party of Albania. It did not itself receive sufficient votes for any representation in Parliament.

<text>The National Urban League (NUL), formerly known as the National League on Urban Conditions Among Negroes, is a nonpartisan historic civil rights organization based in New York City that advocates on behalf of economic and social justice for African Americans and against racial discrimination in the United States. It is the oldest and largest community-based organization of its kind in the nation. Its current president is Marc Morial. 

==History==

The Committee on Urban Conditions Among Negroes was founded in New York City on September 29, 1910, by Ruth Standish Baldwin and Dr. George Edmund Haynes, among others. It merged with the Committee for the Improvement of Industrial Conditions Among Negroes in New York (founded in New York in 1906) and the National League for the Protection of Colored Women (founded in 1905), and was renamed the National League on Urban Conditions Among Negroes. Haynes served as the organization&#x27;s first Executive Director.

In 1918, Eugene K. Jones took the leadership of the organization. Under his direction, the League significantly expanded its multifaceted campaign to crack the barriers to black employment, spurred first by the boom years of the 1920s, and then by the desperate years of the Great Depression.

In 1920, the organization took its present name, the National Urban League. The mission of the Urban League movement, as stated by the National Urban League, is &quot;to enable African Americans to secure economic self-reliance, parity, power and civil rights.&quot; When the organization expanded its facilities to conduct more research in 1920, the new Department of Research came under the charge of Lillian Anderson Turner Alexander, a rising civil rights activist recruited by Jones.

Jones played a significant role in President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s administration, taking leave from the League to head the Department of Commerce unit for the study of &quot;Negro problems&quot;, and serving as part of a group of African-American advisors known as the &quot;Black Cabinet&quot;.

In 1941, Lester Granger was appointed Executive Secretary and led the NUL&#x27;s effort to support the March on Washington proposed by A. Philip Randolph, Bayard Rustin and A. J. Muste to protest racial discrimination in defense work and the military. A week before the March was scheduled to take place, President Roosevelt issued an executive order creating the Fair Employment Practices Committee.

In the wake of World War II, Black veterans who fought racial hatred overseas returned to the United States determined to fight it at home, giving new energy to the Civil Rights Movement. As hundreds of thousands of new jobs opened up, shifting the economy from industrial manufacturing to a white-collar, service-oriented economy, the National Urban League turned its attention to placing HBCU graduates in professional positions.

In 1961, Whitney Young became executive director amidst the expansion of activism in the civil rights movement, which provoked a change for the League. Young substantially expanded the League&#x27;s fund-raising ability and made the League a full partner in the civil rights movement. In 1963, the League hosted the planning meetings of A. Philip Randolph, Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders for the August March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. During Young&#x27;s ten-year tenure at the League, he initiated programs such as &quot;Street Academy&quot;, an alternative education system to prepare high school dropouts for college; and &quot;New Thrust&quot;, an effort to help local black leaders identify and solve community problems. Young also pushed for federal aid to cities.

Clarence M. Pendleton, Jr., was, from 1975 to 1981, the head of the Urban League in San Diego, California. In 1981, U.S. President Ronald W. Reagan tapped Pendleton as the chairman of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, a position which he held until his sudden death in 1988. Pendleton sought to steer the commission in the conservative direction in line with Reagan&#x27;s views on social and civil rights policies.

In 1994, Hugh Price was appointed as president of the Urban League.

=== 21st century ===
In 2003, Marc Morial, former mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana, was appointed the league&#x27;s eighth President and Chief Executive Officer. He worked to reenergize the movement&#x27;s diverse constituencies by building on the legacy of the organization and increasing the profile of the organization.

The National Urban League is an organizational member of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, which advocates gun control. In 1989, it was the beneficiary of all proceeds from the Stop the Violence Movement and their hip hop single, &quot;Self Destruction&quot;.

In May 2017, the National Urban League produced the State of Black America TV Town Hall, which aired on TV One in 2017 and 2018. The TV Town Hall elevated social issues related to African Americans through an interview style format with celebrity guests. The show was executive produced by Rhonda Spears Bell.

In February 2018, the National Urban League launched a weekly podcast, &quot;For the Movement&quot;, which discusses persistent policy, social and civil rights issues affecting communities of color.

As of 2022, the National Urban League has 92 affiliates serving 300 communities, in 36 states and the District of Columbia. The National Urban League provides direct services in the areas of education, health care, housing, jobs, and justice—providing services to more than 3 million people nationwide. The organization also has a Washington Bureau that serves as its research, policy and advocacy arm on issues relating to Congress and the Administration.

=== Lawsuit with the Trump Administration ===

On February 19, 2025, the National Urban League joined civil rights organizations National Fair Housing Alliance and the AIDS Foundation of Chicago in a lawsuit against the executive orders 14151, 14168, and 14173 of the Trump administration, on the grounds that these infringe upon civilians&#x27; rights to free speech and due process.

==&quot;State of Black America&quot;==

The &quot;State of Black America&quot; is an annual report published by the league.

<doc id="401516" wikidata="Q2259685" url="?curid=401516" title="Burnham, Buckinghamshire">
<text>Burnham is a large village and civil parish that lies north of the River Thames in Buckinghamshire, between the towns of Maidenhead and Slough, about 24 miles west of Charing Cross, London. It is probably best known for the nearby Burnham Beeches woodland.

The village is served by Burnham railway station on the main line between and . The M4 motorway passes through the south of the parish.

==History==

The toponym is derived from the Old English for &quot;homestead on a stream&quot;. 
It was first recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Burneham&quot;, when the manor was held by Walter FitzOther.

Burnham was once a very important village. The Great West Road from London to Bath passed through the extensive parish of Burnham and as a result, in 1271, a Royal charter was granted to hold a market and an annual fair. However, when the first Maidenhead Bridge crossing the Thames opened c.1280, the road was diverted to the south of Burnham (the route of the modern A4), and Burnham fell into relative decline. The market was then transferred to Maidenhead.

Today the village is nearly contiguous with west Slough, though green-buffered by parkland. At the 2011 census the civil parish had a population of 11,630 and Burnham is the traditional village nucleus.

===Parish Church===

The Church of England parish church of Saint Peter dates in part from the 12th century but has been substantially expanded, refurbished and altered, with major restorations in 1863–64 and 1891 and the construction of the Cornerstone Centre in 1986.

===Burnham Abbey===
In 1265 a Benedictine women&#x27;s abbey was founded near the village by Richard, Earl of Cornwall. The community was dispersed under King Henry VIII in the dissolution of the monasteries. Since 1916, a contemplative order of Church of England Augustinian nuns has been based in the restored remains of the original abbey.
The abbey is now up for sale at a price of around £3 million.

===Hamlets===
The parish of Burnham included a number of communities: in the 18th century the liberties assessed for the poor rate were Burnham Town, East Burnham, Boveney, Britwell, Cippenham and Wood. Boveney became a separate civil parish in 1866 Cippenham was transferred to Slough in 1930, and therefore became part of Berkshire in 1974. Britwell was transferred to the borough of Slough and to Berkshire in 1974.

The current civil parish now includes Lent Rise, Rose Hill, East Burnham, Hitcham, Littleworth and Littleworth Common.

==Schools==
The selective Burnham Grammar School provides secondary education

==Amenities==

The village has a traditional High Street, with many buildings dating from the 18th and 19th century. There are two small supermarkets 
and five pubs on or near the High Street, and many small independent cafes and shops. At the south end of the High Street is a large park, which contains the community centre of Burnham Park Hall and a small public library.

Burnham Football Club is a non-League football team that plays at the 1878 Stadium.

Burnham has a Local nature reserve on the eastern border of the village called Haymill Valley.

Burnham Beeches National Nature Reserve, an area of of protected ancient woodland, lies just north of the village. Owing to its proximity to Pinewood Film &amp; TV Studios, Burnham and its surrounding areas (in particular Burnham Beeches) feature in films, notably main scenes in &quot;Carry On&quot; films and for the 1991 film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.

The major National Trust estate of Cliveden is about three miles northwest, in the neighbouring parish of Taplow. Dorneywood, currently the country home of the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, is in Burnham parish.

The River Thames is about two miles south and west of the village centre. The major rowing venue of Dorney Lake is nearby. There are three golf courses (Huntswood, Lambourne, Burnham Beeches) to the north and west of the village.

== Transport links ==

In addition to Burnham railway station (Elizabeth Line) and the nearby M4, 
the Chiltern Main Line and the M40 are accessible about 5 miles north at Beaconsfield while Heathrow Airport is about 12 miles east.

<text>Cadmore, also known as Cadmore End, is a village in the civil parish of Lane End in the English county of Buckinghamshire.

Historically Cadmore End was in two parishes and two counties. Part was a detached part of the parish of Lewknor in Oxfordshire, part of a division of the parish known as Lewknor Uphill consisting of three detached parts. Part of Cadmore End was a manor in the parish of Fingest in Buckinghamshire. In 1852 it became the separate ecclesiastical parish of Cadmore End, and in 1896 the Oxfordshire part of the parish was transferred to Buckinghamshire.

The parish church of St Mary le Moor was built in 1851 and is a Grade II listed building. It replaced the mediaeval chapel with the same dedication at Ackhampstead.

<text>The Republican Party of Albania (, PR or PRSH) is a national-conservative political party in Albania. It currently holds 3 of the 140 seats in the Parliament of Albania, in alliance with the Democratic Party of Albania.

==History==
The party was founded on 10 January 1991 under the leadership of the writer Sabri Godo, who was also its first Chairman. The party was formed with the backing of the Italian Republican Party. After the Democratic Party, it was the second party to be founded in Albania after the anti-communist revolution in the autumn of 1990. 

In the 1992 elections the party received 2.9% of the national vote and won a single seat. They joined a coalition with the Democratic Party, but had little influence on the policies being shaped. The 1996 elections saw the party almost double its share of the vote to 5.9%, winning three seats. After the 1997 uprising, in which the center-right coalition was overthrown by socialist supporters, the party became an opposition party. In the 1997 elections the party was reduced to a single seat.

Before the 2001 elections, the party joined the Union for Victory Coalition under the leadership of the Democratic Party, which won 46 seats. In the 2005 elections the party received 20% of the vote in the national voting for the proportional seats, putting it in first place. Although it won 11 proportional seats, it failed to win a single constituency seat, resulting in the party only being the third largest in Parliament. For the 2009 elections the party was part of the &quot;Alliance for Changes&quot; coalition. However, it was reduced to a single seat, after seeing its vote share fall to just 2.1% of the national total. In the 2011 local elections the party won a total of 67,039 votes throughout the country, twice the amount they had received in the 2009 Albanian parliamentary election.

<text>Derrida is a 2002 American documentary film directed by Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering Kofman about the French philosopher Jacques Derrida. It premiered at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival before being released theatrically on October 23, 2002.

==Synopsis==

The film uses interviews shot by the filmmakers, footage of Derrida&#x27;s lectures and speaking engagements, and personal footage of Derrida at home with his friends and family. In several scenes, Ziering Kofman also reads excerpts from Derrida&#x27;s work or otherwise describes aspects of his life.

&quot;Derrida&quot; also focuses on Derrida&#x27;s thesis that scholars tend to ignore important biographical information when discussing philosophers&#x27; lives. In one scene, Derrida comments that he would be most interested in hearing about famous philosophers&#x27; sex lives because this topic is seldom addressed in their writings. The filmmakers respond to many of these criticisms by probing Derrida on various aspects of his own personal life, though he usually refuses to answer directly questions about himself.

The film also follows Derrida during a trip to South Africa where he visits Nelson Mandela&#x27;s former prison cell and discusses forgiveness with university students. Derrida states that his own childhood experiences with anti-Semitism have heightened his sensitivity to racial issues.

==Analysis==

At several points, &quot;Derrida&quot; shows the philosopher applying his theory of deconstruction to the film itself. Derrida often challenges the filmmaking process and argues against the capability of any film to portray him accurately. The film also includes metacinematic scenes in which Derrida analyzes previously recorded footage of himself. In one such scene, Derrida telescopically watches a video of himself analyzing footage of himself.

Nicholas Royle argues that the film&#x27;s labyrinthine, Ouroboros-like structure reinforces several key Derridean tenets:

:&quot;If Dick and Ziering Kofman follow Derrida, Derrida is also following them. &quot;Derrida&quot; is a film about following, about the compulsiveness and ghostliness of following, of following the camera, of following the story, of following a film. But &quot;Derrida&quot; is also a film about the impossibility of following, about the consequences and effects of Derrida&#x27;s work vis-à-vis the &#x27;story of a life&#x27;, about the idea that Derrida cannot tell a story.&quot;

==Reception==

Film critics generally gave &quot;Derrida&quot; positive reviews; the film has an 82% &quot;fresh&quot; rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised the film for its sophisticated style and said it was &quot;the cinematic equivalent of a mind-expanding drug&quot; while &quot;Film Threat&quot; Tim Merrill described it as &quot;a priceless historical record.&quot; Other critics, like &quot;The Guardian&quot; Peter Bradshaw, found the film whimsical and entertaining but lamented Derrida&#x27;s evasive and mysterious demeanor.

Derrida received the Golden Gate Award at the 2002 San Francisco Film Festival and screened in competition for the Grand Jury Prize at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival.

==Post-Release==

Derrida enjoyed the film and appeared at several promotional events to discuss the film and answer questions about the project.

Derrida died in October 2004.

In 2005, Routledge published a companion book, &quot;Derrida&quot;, which includes the film&#x27;s screenplay, several essays on the film, and interviews with Derrida, Dick, and Ziering Kofman. The book describes many of the events that followed the film&#x27;s release, including Derrida&#x27;s unexpected celebrity status on the streets of New York City. This phenomenon prompted Derrida&#x27;s wife to remark to the filmmakers, &quot;I hear you&#x27;ve made him into Clint Eastwood.&quot;

<doc id="401531" wikidata="Q154240" url="?curid=401531" title="Yemelyan Pugachev">
<text>Yemelyan Ivanovich Pugachev (also spelled Pugachyov; ; ) was an ataman of the Yaik Cossacks and the leader of the Pugachev&#x27;s Rebellion, a major popular uprising in the Russian Empire during the reign of Catherine the Great.

The son of a Don Cossack landowner, Pugachev served in the Imperial Russian Army during the Seven Years&#x27; War and the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774. In 1770 he deserted the Russian military and spent years as a fugitive, gaining popularity among the peasants, Cossacks and Old Believers against a backdrop of intensified unrest. In 1773, he initiated open revolt against Catherine. Claiming to be Catherine&#x27;s late husband Tsar Peter III, Pugachev proclaimed an end to serfdom and amassed a large army. His forces quickly overran much of the region between the Volga and the Urals, and in 1774 they captured Kazan and burned the city to the ground. In August 1774, General Johann von Michelsohnen inflicted a crushing defeat on the rebels at Tsaritsyn. Pugachev was captured soon after by his own Cossacks and turned over to the authorities. He was then sent to Moscow and executed in January 1775. Alexander Pushkin wrote a notable history of the rebellion, &quot;The History of Pugachev&quot;, and recounted the events of the uprising in his novel &quot;The Captain&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1836).

==Early life==
Pugachev, the son of a small Don Cossack landowner, was the youngest son of four children. Born in the stanitsa Zimoveyskaya (in present-day Volgograd Oblast), he signed on to military service at the age of 17. One year later, he married a Cossack girl, Sofya Nedyuzheva, with whom he had five children, two of whom died in infancy. Shortly after his marriage, he joined the Russian Second Army in Prussia during the Seven Years&#x27; War under the command of Count Zakhar Chernyshov. He returned home in 1762, and for the next seven years divided his time between his home village and several service assignments. During this period, he was recognised for his military skill and achieved the Cossack rank of khorunzhiy, which would be roughly equivalent to the post of company commander. It was also during this period, in 1770 at the siege of Bender during the Russo-Turkish War, that he first displayed a flair for impersonation, boasting to his comrades that his sword was given to him by his &quot;godfather&quot;, Peter I.

==Life as a fugitive==

In 1770, Pugachev requested leave to return home to recover from a severe illness, later seeking permanent discharge. Despite urging from military commanders, Pugachev refused to be treated in a military infirmary or return to the front. Convinced by his brother-in-law, Simon Pavlov, he joined a dissatisfied Cossack group who were fleeing eastward for an independent Cossack community on the Terek River. After they were safely across the Don River, he returned home to Zimoveyskaya. The fleeing Cossacks were caught soon after by the authorities, and Pavlov implicated Pugachev in the desertion, causing his arrest. He was held for 48 hours before he managed to escape, beginning his fugitive career.
Fleeing for the Cossack community on the Terek River, he arrived in early January 1772. During his six weeks in the area, he joined a protest group and was elected their official representative. On his way to St. Petersburg to make an official complaint, his fugitive status was discovered in Mozdok, and he was again arrested. He escaped on 13 February and returned home, only to be arrested once again.
Dispatched to Cherkassk for investigation, he met Lukyan Ivanovich Khudiakov, whom he tricked into releasing him, after which he fled to Vetka, a Polish border settlement, with the help of many raskol&#x27;niki. He returned to Russia in the autumn of 1772 by pretending to be an Old Believer wishing to return home. He received a visa to settle in the Malykovka district (present day Vol&#x27;sk), where he most likely first heard of the Yaik Cossacks rebellion.

==Insurrection 1773–1774==
The idea of impersonating the late Emperor Peter III occurred to Pugachev early on, even before he reached the Yaik Cossacks. It is of no surprise, given another recent peasant impersonator, Fedot Bogmolov, and Russia&#x27;s history of impersonators.
Pugachev, posing as a wealthy merchant, reportedly tested the feelings of the Cossacks at the Yaitsk by suggesting that he led a mass exodus into Turkey. When the majority seemed to agree with his plan, he deemed it the right time to begin his rebellion.
Though he was arrested shortly after once again, and this time held for five months at Kazan, he escaped once more and returned to the Yaitsk to start his revolt.
By promising to return several privileges to the Cossacks and to restore the Old Belief, he was able to gain the support he needed to promote his identity as Peter III.
The story of Pugachev&#x27;s strong resemblance to the Tsar Peter III, who in 1762 was overthrown and murdered by his wife&#x27;s supporters, the future empress Catherine II, comes from a later legend. Pugachev told the story that he and his principal adherents had escaped from the clutches of Catherine.

Having amassed an army through propaganda, recruitment and promise of reform, Pugachev and his generals were able to overrun much of the region stretching between the Volga River and the Urals. Pugachev&#x27;s greatest victory of the insurgency was the taking of Kazan. As well as amassing large numbers of Cossacks and peasants, Pugachev also acquired artillery and arms and was able to supply his force better than the Russian army would have predicted.
In response, General Peter Panin set out against the rebels with a large army, but difficulty of transport, lack of discipline, and the gross insubordination of his ill-paid soldiers paralysed all his efforts for months, while Pugachev&#x27;s innumerable and ubiquitous bands gained victories in nearly every engagement. Not until August 1774 did General Michelsohn inflict a crushing defeat upon the rebels near Tsaritsyn, when they lost; ten thousand were killed or taken prisoner. Panin&#x27;s savage reprisals, after the capture of Penza, completed their discomfiture. On 14 September 1774, Pugachev&#x27;s own Cossacks delivered him to Yaitsk. Alexander Suvorov had him placed in a metal cage and sent first to Simbirsk and then to Moscow for a public execution, which took place on . In Bolotnaya Square in the centre of Moscow, he was decapitated and then drawn and quartered in public.

==Legacy==

The Pugachev rebellion had a long-lasting effect on Russia for years to come. While Catherine II tried to reform the provincial administration, the horrors of the revolt caused her to drop other reforms, particularly attempts to emancipate the peasant serfs of Russia. The Russian writer Alexander Radishchev, in his &quot;Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow&quot;, attacked the Russian government, in particular the institution of serfdom. In the book, he refers to Pugachev and the rebellion as a warning.

The term &quot;Pugachevs of the University&quot; was frequently used to describe the generation of the Russian Nihilist movement.

The village (&quot;stanitsa&quot;) in which Pugachev was born, whose original name &quot;Zimoveyskaya&quot; was changed after his defeat to Potemkinskaya, was renamed Pugachevskaya in his honor in 1917, following the October Revolution.

The central square in the Kazakh town of Uralsk is named Pugachev Square.

Yemelyan Pugachev&#x27;s House Museum in Uralsk, was established in 1991.

Authors such as Boris Akunin have referred to Pugachevshchina as a tendency in the Russian culture toward rebellious discontent.

A fictionalised account of the rebellion is presented in Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s 1836 novella &quot;The Captain&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. This was in part the basis of the 1958 film &quot;Tempest&quot;, which starred Van Heflin as Pugachev.

The 1928 silent film &quot;Bulat-Batyr&quot; (directed by Yuri Tarich) is devoted to the Pugachev rebellion.

In the Hulu series &quot;The Great&quot;, Pugachev (played by Nicholas Hoult) is portrayed as a decoy of Peter III (also played by Hoult) who often steals things from the palace. He is stabbed seemingly to death by Catherine at the end of the second season, but is then revealed to be alive, setting the stage for his rebellion in the third season.

<text>The Unity for Human Rights Party (, ) is a social-liberal political party in Albania supporting the Greek minority. Founded in 1992, it represents Albania&#x27;s minorities and is mainly related to the Greek minority, and is the political continuation of Omonoia. It works with Omonoia, MEGA and other Greek parties in Albania at national elections, under a Greek bloc. The party is currently led by Vangjel Dule, who holds the party&#x27;s only seat in Parliament.

==History==
The party first contested national elections in 1992, when it received 2.7% of the national vote and won two seats. The 1996 elections saw the party increase its share of the vote to 4%, winning three seats. Although the party&#x27;s vote share dropped to 3.2% in the early elections in 1997, it gained an additional MP, winning four seats. However, another drop in the party&#x27;s support in the 2001 elections saw it reduced to three seats. Despite again increasing its vote share to 4.1% in the 2005 elections, the party lost another MP as it was reduced to two seats. The 2009 elections saw the party reduced to one seat.

In the 2011 local elections the party lost its councillors in Gjirokastër and Delvinë and one of its two municipal seats in Sarandë, maintained its seat Shkodër and gained one of the seats in Korçë in addition to the mayoralty in nine communes. In the 2013 parliamentary elections it retained its single seat, running as part of the Alliance for a European Albania headed by the Socialist Party.

In the 2015 local elections the party failed to win any mayoralties, losing seats to other Greek parties such as MEGA/EEM, as well as the Socialist Party.

In the parliamentary elections of 2017 it joined forces with the Democratic Party and fielded two candidates: the party leader Vangjel Dule in Vlorë and one in Korçë County, with the former being elected. It continued its alliance with the Democratic Party in the 2021 parliamentary elections, in which it won a single seat on the Democratic Party&#x27;s list.

<doc id="401538" wikidata="Q1780383" url="?curid=401538" title="Calverton, Buckinghamshire">
<text>Calverton is a civil parish in the unitary authority area of the City of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England and just outside the Milton Keynes urban area, situated roughly south of Stony Stratford, and west of Central Milton Keynes. The parish consists of one village, Lower Weald, and two hamlets, Upper Weald and Middle Weald. Lower Weald is the largest of the three settlements, and Manor Farm, the parish church and the former parochial school are within its boundaries.

The settlement name is Old English, and means &#x27;farm where calves are reared&#x27;. In the Domesday Book of 1086 the village was recorded as &quot;Calvretone&quot;.

The west side of nearby Stony Stratford was once included with the ecclesiastic parish of Calverton (the east side being in Wolverton). &quot;The manorial rights over the west side were held with those of Calverton, [which] led to the manor of Calverton being often called &#x27;the manor of Calverton with Stony Stratford&#x27;, and the fair and market of Stony Stratford were included among its appurtenances, until an Act of Parliament in the 18th century separated them.

The parish of Calverton was part of Stratford and Wolverton Rural District from 1894 to 1919, when the rural district became an urban district, subsequently renamed Wolverton urban district in 1920. The area was re-established as a separate parish in 2001.

The parish church is dedicated to All Saints. &quot;It was rebuilt in stone in the 12th- and 14th-century styles between 1818 and 1824, when some of the old details were re-used&quot;.

== Lower Weald ==

Lower Weald is the location of the parish church and Calverton Manor; the hamlets are located to the south east of the village centre, on the road to Whaddon.

On 2 August 2011, Calverton Manor house featured in BBC2&#x27;s Restoration Home television series. The manor was acquired in 1616 by Sir Thomas Bennett, who had been Lord Mayor of London in 1603. The house was extended in 1659 by his grandson Sir Simon Bennett. The manor house is reputedly haunted by the ghost of Simon&#x27;s wife, Lady Grace Bennett, who was murdered there in 1694. The Bennett family also owned the neighbouring manor of Beachampton. The titles of the Lord de Calverton and Lord de Beachampton, but not the formerly-associated lands, of these two manors remain in the Bennett family to the present day.

== Middle Weald == 
Middle Weald is a hamlet of about ten dwellings, about half a mile (1 km) from the parish church.

== Upper Weald == 
Upper Weald is a hamlet of about twenty dwellings, a little over a mile (about 2 km) from the parish church. The hamlet includes the farmhouse of Fairfield Farm, which gives its name to the modern neighbourhood and civil parish, Fairfields, being developed on part of its former lands adjacent to Watling Street.

== Listed buildings and structures ==
The parish has two grade II* listed buildings (Calverton Manor farm house and the parish church), and a further 24 buildings and structures with grade II listings.

<text>Herman Merivale CB (8 November 1806 – 8 February 1874) was an English civil servant and historian. He was the elder brother of Charles Merivale, and father of the poet Herman Charles Merivale.

He was born at Dawlish, Devon to John Herman Merivale (1770–1844) and Louisa Heath Drury. He was educated at Harrow School. In 1823 he entered Oriel College, Oxford. In 1825 he became a scholar of Trinity College and also won the Ireland scholarship, and three years later he was elected fellow of Balliol College. He became a member of the Inner Temple and practised on the western circuit, being made in 1841 recorder of Falmouth, Helston and Penzance.

From 1837 to 1842 he was professor of political economy at the University of Oxford. In this capacity he delivered a course of lectures on the British Colonies in which he dealt with questions of emigration, employment of labour and the allotment of public lands. The reputation he secured by these lectures had much to do with his appointment in 1847 as Assistant Under-Secretary for the colonies, and in the next year he became Permanent Under-Secretary. In 1859 he was transferred to the permanent under-secretaryship for India, receiving the distinction of CB. In 1870, Merivale was awarded the degree of DCL by Oxford University. He died in 1874 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.

Besides his &quot;Lectures on Colonization and Colonies&quot; (1841), he published &quot;Historical Studies&quot; (1865), and completed the &quot;Memoirs of Sir Philip Francis&quot; (1867); he wrote the second volume of the &quot;Life of Sir Henry Lawrence&quot; (1872) in continuation of Sir Herbert Edwardes&#x27;s work.

A tribute to his powers as an original thinker by his chief at the Colonial Office, Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton, is printed with a notice of his career which his brother contributed to the &quot;Transactions&quot; (1884) of the Devonshire Association.

== Family ==
On 29 October 1834 he married Caroline Penelope Robinson, daughter of William Villiers Robinson and Anne Brooksbank.
&quot;Children&quot;

<text>STS-75 was a 1996 NASA Space Shuttle mission, the 19th mission of the &quot;Columbia&quot; orbiter.

==Crew==

=== Crew seat assignments ===
==Mission objective==
===Tethered Satellite System===
The primary objective of STS-75 was to carry the Tethered Satellite System Reflight (TSS-1R) into orbit and to deploy it spaceward on a conducting tether. The mission also flew the United States Microgravity Payload (USMP-3) designed to investigate materials science and condensed matter physics.

The TSS-1R mission was a reflight of TSS-1 which was flown onboard Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; on STS-46 in July/August 1992. The Tether Satellite System circled the Earth at an altitude of 296 kilometers, placing the tether system within the rarefied electrically charged layer of the atmosphere known as the ionosphere.

STS-75 mission scientists hoped to deploy the tether to a distance of . Over of the tether were deployed (over a period of 5 hours) before the tether broke. Many pieces of floating debris were produced by the plasma discharge and rupture of the tether, and some collided with it. The satellite remained in orbit for a number of weeks and was easily visible from the ground.

The electric conductor of the tether was a copper braid wound around a nylon (Nomex) string. It was encased in teflon-like insulation, with an outer cover of kevlar, inside a nylon (Nomex) sheath. The culprit turned out to be the innermost core, made of a porous material which, during its manufacture, trapped many bubbles of air, at atmospheric pressure.

Later vacuum-chamber experiments suggested that the unwinding of the reel uncovered pinholes in the insulation. That in itself would not have caused a major problem, because the ionosphere around the tether, under normal circumstance, was too rarefied to divert much of the current. However, the air trapped in the insulation changed that. As air bubbled out of the pinholes, the high voltage of the nearby tether, about 3500 volts, converted it into a relatively dense plasma (similar to the ignition of a fluorescent tube), and therefore made the tether a much better conductor of electricity. This plasma diverted to the metal of the shuttle and from there to the ionospheric return circuit. That current was enough to melt the cable.

The specific TSS-1R mission objectives were: characterize the current-voltage response of the TSS-orbiter system, characterize the satellite&#x27;s high-voltage sheath structure and current collection process, demonstrate electric power generation, verify tether control laws and basic tether dynamics, demonstrate the effect of neutral gas on the plasma sheath and current collection, characterize the TSS radio frequency and plasma wave emissions and characterize the TSS dynamic-electrodynamic coupling.

TSS-1R Science Investigations included: TSS Deployer Core Equipment and Satellite Core Equipment (DCORE/SCORE), Research on Orbital Plasma Electrodynamics (ROPE), Research on Electrodynamic Tether Effects (RETE), Magnetic Field Experiment for TSS Missions (TEMAG), Shuttle Electrodynamic Tether System (SETS), Shuttle Potential and Return Electron Experiment (SPREE), Tether Optical Phenomena Experiment (TOP), Investigation of Electromagnetic Emissions by the Electrodynamic Tether (EMET), Observations at the Earth&#x27;s Surface of Electromagnetic Emissions by TSS (OESSE), Investigation and Measurement of Dynamic Noise in the TSS (IMDN), Theoretical and Experimental Investigation of TSS Dynamics (TEID) and the Theory and Modeling in Support of Tethered Satellite Applications (TMST).

===Other mission objectives===
The USMP-3 payload consisted of four major experiments mounted on two Mission Peculiar Experiment Support Structures (MPESS) and three Shuttle Mid-deck experiments. The experiments were: Advanced Automated Directional Solidification Furnace (AADSF), Material pour l&#x27;Etude des Phenomenes Interessant la Solidification sur Terre et en Orbite (MEPHISTO), Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS), Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment (OARE), Critical Fluid Light Scattering Experiment (ZENO) and Isothermal Dendritic Growth Experiment (IDGE).

==Alternating use of bunk bed==
Astronauts Jeffrey A. Hoffman and Scott J. Horowitz, both Jewish, had alternating use of the same bunk bed, to which Hoffman attached, upon Horowitz&#x27;s request, a mezuzah, using Velcro.

==Operating system==
STS-75 also was the first use of an operating system based on the Linux kernel on orbit. An older Digital Unix program, originally on a DEC AlphaServer, was ported to run Linux on a laptop. The next use of Linux was a year later, on STS-83.

==Fictional STS-75 mission==
STS-75 was the shuttle mission described in the fictional NASA Document 12-571-3570, although this document was disseminated several years before STS-75 was launched. The document purports to report on experiments to determine effective sexual positions in microgravity. Astronomer and scientific writer Pierre Kohler mistook this document for fact and is responsible for a major increase in its redistribution in the early 21st century. Conspiracy theories first made in the early beginnings of the Shuttle era of sex in space were suddenly made rampant again, causing a minor press debacle among tabloids.

<doc id="401544" wikidata="Q57681" url="?curid=401544" title="José Antonio Primo de Rivera">
<text>José Antonio Primo de Rivera y Sáenz de Heredia, 1st Duke of Primo de Rivera, 3rd Marquess of Estella GE (24 April 1903 – 20 November 1936), often referred to simply as José Antonio, was a Spanish fascist politician who founded the Falange Española (&quot;Spanish Phalanx&quot;), later Falange Española de las JONS.

The eldest son of General Miguel Primo de Rivera, who governed Spain as dictator from 1923 to 1930, Primo de Rivera worked as a lawyer before entering politics, an enterprise he initially engaged in vowing to defend his deceased father&#x27;s memory. He founded Falange Española in October 1933, shortly before running as a candidate in the 1933 general election, in which he won a seat in the Congress of Deputies of the Second Spanish Republic. He assumed the role of messianic leader and charged himself with the task of saving Spain in founding a fascist party, but he encountered difficulties widening his support base during his whole political life.

In 1936, he endorsed the Spanish nationalist military coup against the republic that led to a civil war that he later tried to stop. Imprisoned before the start of the war, he was accused of conspiracy and military rebellion against the government of the republic and was sentenced to death and executed during the first months of the war.

In life, he held the nobiliary title of 3rd Marquess of Estella, Grandee of Spain. In 1948, he was posthumously given the title of Duke of Primo de Rivera, which was subsequently passed to his brother Miguel. The image of José Antonio was revered during the war by the Nationalist faction, and after the establishment of Francoist Spain he was regarded as a martyr, and used as a tool of the Francoist propaganda apparatus. The inscription of &quot;José Antonio ¡Presente!&quot; could be found in many churches all across Spain.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
José Antonio Primo de Rivera was born on Calle de Génova (Madrid) on April 24, 1903, the eldest son of the military officer Miguel Primo de Rivera y Orbaneja (who would later govern Spain as dictator from 1923 to 1930) and Casilda Sáenz de Heredia y Suárez de Argudín. From his father he inherited the title of Marquess of Estella. He never married.
His mother died when he was five years old, and he was subsequently raised by his father&#x27;s sister. He was privately taught at home, and learned English and French. When at university, he did not attend lectures until the second year of his undergraduate studies. He spent his summer holidays at the country estate of an uncle, where he practiced horseriding and hunting.

Primo de Rivera went on to study law at the University of Madrid between 1917 and 1923. He helped to organize the student union there, &quot;Federación Universitaria Escolar&quot;, which opposed the higher-education policies of his father. He took undergraduate and graduate courses simultaneously and he obtained both his Bachelor and Doctor degrees in the same year, 1923.
After graduating, he chose the &quot;One-Year Volunteer&quot; option to do his military service while his father was dictator. He served with the Ninth Dragoons of St. James cavalry regiment, stationed at Barcelona. He was court-martialed for punching a superior officer, the future Nationalist army leader, Brigadier General Gonzalo Queipo de Llano.

Queipo de Llano had written a defamatory letter against an uncle of José Antonio and against the Dictator himself. José Antonio, ready to defend the honour of his family abused by the Republican general, went to the café where the latter used to socialize, and after asking whether he was the author of the writing, and after receiving the general&#x27;s affirmative reply, delivered a spectacular punch that made the general roll on the floor, sparking a free-for-all between the companions of José Antonio and the companions of the general.
Queipo de Llano had been a Republican in the time of the Rivera dictatorship, but is today remembered mostly as a notorious Francoist war criminal in the Civil War.

Primo de Rivera became a registered lawyer in 1925, and opened an office on a side street of Madrid very near the confluence of three principal avenues.

A relatively successful lawyer not involved nor expected to be involved in politics before 1930, the impetuous José Antonio Primo de Rivera decided to do so after the death of his father in his Parisian self-exile in 1930; this was for him the best way to defend the memory of his father, whose work at government had often been derided.

In 1931, he was invested &quot;Perpetual Dean of the Illustrious College of Lawyers of Madrid&quot;.

He ran for office under the banner of the National Monarchist Union but failed to get elected.

He was detained briefly in 1932 for collaboration in General José Sanjurjo&#x27;s attempted coup.

=== Falangist leader ===

On October 29, 1933, Primo de Rivera launched the Falange Española (&quot;Spanish Phalanx&quot;), a nationalist party, inspired in part with some ideas, such as the necessity of authority, hierarchical order of society, and grassroots populism, that were being expounded in Italy in the Fascist movement. The foundational convention was held in the Teatro de la Comedia of Madrid. He was the keynote speaker and his first address was a criticism of liberal democracy.

Since the liberal state was a servant of [Rousseau] it became not just the trustee of a nation&#x27;s destiny but also the spectator of electoral contests. What alone mattered to the liberal state was that a certain number of gentlemen be sitting at the polling station, that the voting start at eight o&#x27;clock and end at four, that the ballot boxes not get smashed—when being smashed is the noblest aspiration of all ballot boxes—and then to respect the outcome of the voting, as if the outcome was a matter of complete indifference to it. In other words liberal governments did not even believe in their mission, that theirs was a respectable duty, but rather they believed that anyone who disagreed with them and decided to attack the state, whether with good or ill intentions, had the same right as they did to defend it.

During the speech he made his noted remark on the recourse to fists and guns when needed,

And in closing, that if what we want must in some circumstance be attained through the use of violence, that we demur not before the prospect of violence. For who has said, when they say, &quot;Every available means except violence,&quot; that the supreme hierarchy of moral values resides in kindness? Who has said that when our feelings are insulted, rather than react like men, we are called upon to reply amiably? Dialogue as a first step of communication is well and good. But there is no option left except fists and guns when someone offends the precepts of justice or the fatherland.
Stanley G. Payne argues that Rivera&#x27;s view that violence was acceptable if done for a just cause was paralleled by that of the Spanish Left, who held similar views on the use of violence; unlike the Italian fascists, the Falange never developed a sophisticated theory for their doctrine of violence. Payne argues that because his father had ruled as a dictator with relatively minimal violence during the quieter 1920s, Rivera naively assumed he could impose a new authoritarian system with relatively limited violence, but he would eventually find himself caught in a spiral of killing that he could not control. When he founded the Falange, Antonio was more reluctant to use violence than other leading members of the party; he did not seem to expect violence from the political Left to be directed against the party. However, after Juan Cuéllar&#x27;s death, he seemed to overcome his reluctance and thus intermittent killings on both sides would continue.

Rivera&#x27;s closing words made explicit his Romantic nationalism:

In a poetic sweep we will raise this fervent devotion to Spain; we will make sacrifices, we will renounce the easy life and we will triumph, triumph that—you know this well—we shall not obtain in the upcoming elections. In these elections vote the lesser evil. But your Spain will not be born out of them, nor does our frame for action reside there. That is a murky atmosphere, spent, like a tavern&#x27;s after a night of dissipation. Our station is not there. I am a candidate, yes, but I take part in these elections without faith or respect. And I say this now, when so doing may rest me every vote. I couldn&#x27;t care less. We are not going to squabble with the establishment over the unsavory left-overs of a soiled banquet. Our station is outside though we may provisionally pass by the other one. Our place is out in the clear air, beneath a moonlit sky, cradling a rifle, and the stars overhead. Let the others party on. We outside in tense vigil; earnest and self-confident we divine the sunrise in the joy of our hearts.

He was a candidate in the general election of November 19 for the umbrella organization &quot;Unión Agraria y Ciudadana,&quot; part of the broad conservative coalition Confederación Española de Derechas Autónomas (CEDA). He was elected to the Parliament as a representative of Cádiz.

In his first parliamentary intervention he answered Gil-Robles—the founder of CEDA—who had just spoken out against all totalitarian forms of government for arrogating to themselves the attributes of God and crushing the personality of the individual: 

We believe that the state does not have to justify its behaviour at every turn, just as no individual or social class does, in so far as it holds to a guiding principle all the time. All the while the state is made out to be God by Rousseau&#x27;s idea that the state, or the will of those it represents, is always right. What makes the state like God is the belief that the will of the state, embodied by absolute monarchs in the past and now by the popular vote, is always right. The monarch may have erred; the popular vote may err because neither truth nor goodness derives from an act or assertion of the will. Goodness and truth are perennial tributaries of reason, and to ascertain whether one is in the right it is not enough to ask the king—whose dictate seemed always just to his supporters—nor enough to canvass the people—whose decision is always right according to the disciples of Rousseau. What must be done rather is to verify whether our actions and our thoughts are in agreement at every step with a permanent aspiration.
On February 11, 1934, Falange merged with Ramiro Ledesma&#x27;s Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista to create the Falange Española de las JONS under José Antonio&#x27;s leadership. The antisemitic positions within FE de las JONS were mainly led by Onésimo Redondo, with Ledesma and Primo de Rivera largely indifferent to the issue; however, Falangists attacked the Jewish-owned SEPU department stores in the spring of 1935; In the view of Gonzalo Álvarez Chillida, both José Antonio and Ledesma probably thought that such antisemitic raids could enhance mobilization within the purportedly threatened small-business sector. He shared with other rightists the belief that violence was legitimate against a Republic that he perceived as influenced by communists, Jews and Freemasons.

The upper-class José Antonio abandoned the tie and suit and took on the new blue-shirt Falange uniform (despite later mocking JAP militants because of this, the Falangists were originally dressed in suit and tie); the uniform, adopted in October 1935, was deliberately chosen as a reference to Italian Fascism.

In 1935 Primo de Rivera collaborated in editing the lyrics of the Falangist anthem, &quot;Cara al Sol&quot; (Face to the Sun).

Every member of the Falange had to obey unquestioningly. They were told: 

The honour and task of Falange must be gauged by those who carry the burden of leadership on their shoulders. Do not forget that one of the rules of our code of ethics is to have faith in the leaders. Your leaders are always right.
Prior to general elections of February 16, 1936, Primo discussed with Gil-Robles the question of Falange joing CEDA-led electoral alliances. He was offered 3 places, including the one in Salamanca which virtually guaranteed the mandate. However, Primo was not satisfied with the proposal, rejected it and decided that Falange candidates would run on their own.

Primo fielded his personal candidature in 13 electoral districts, always as individual non-aligned Falange candidate. In total, he won 24,017 votes. He performed best in Cádiz (he was supported by 7,499 voters, it is 4.66% of all voters), followed by Cáceres (4,427; 2.30%), Valladolid (2,793; 2.15%), Madrid city (4,995; 1.20%), Seville city (942; 0.79%), Toledo (1,479; 0.67%), Huesca (260; 0.27%), Oviedo (818; 0.25%), Ciudad Real (269; 0.14%), Orense (141; 0.08%), La Coruña (217; 0.07%), Albacete (87; 0.06%), and Baleares (90; 0.06%).

In Cuenca (where Primo did not run) the elections were initially declared invalid due to massive irregularities; they were to be repeated on May 3. This time the agreement with Gil-Robles was successfully concluded and Primo de Rivera was fielded on the list of a joint counter-revolutionary bloque. At this point electoral authorities changed the original decision and declared that the Cuenca elections, scheduled for May, would not be repeated elections, but the second round of indecisive February 16 elections. The change rendered Primo&#x27;s candidature invalid, as in the second round only candidates running in the first round were allowed to stand (in case of repeated elections an entirely new set of candidates was possible). Some scholars claim that the decision was taken exactly to prevent Primo from standing. Despite this, Primo did not withdraw (peculiarity of the electoral regime was that invalid candidates were allowed on the list). There were 45,828 voters (44.38%) who supported Primo, even though most of them were probably aware that their votes would be discounted.

Falange won only 0.1% of the vote; but the wave of instability which greeted the victory of the Popular Front—a left-wing coalition of anarchists, communists, socialists, liberal republicans like the radicals, and others—caused an influx of new members, and the minuscule party grew to more than 40,000 members by July.

=== Imprisonment and death ===
On March 14, 1936, he was arrested in Madrid and charged with illegal possession of firearms (at that time, Spain was awash in privately held weapons on the part of all political factions). Nine weeks later he was transferred to the prison in Alicante. In both Madrid and in Alicante, he was able to maintain intermittent secret contact with the Falange leadership and, several times, with General Emilio Mola. On October 3 he was charged with conspiracy against the Republic and military insurrection, both capital offences, even though he had been imprisoned long before the insurrection of July 18. Primo de Rivera conducted his own defence. On November 18 he was found guilty by a people&#x27;s tribunal and sentenced to death by firing squad. The three career judges who participated in the trial, along with the popular tribunal, asked for the death sentence be commuted to life imprisonment but this was rejected by the majority of government ministers (the two ministers from &quot;Izquierda Republicana&quot; voted against the death sentence). The sentence was carried out on November 20 by local authorities in Alicante.

It is said by some that the Republic offered the Nationalists a prisoner exchange involving Primo de Rivera and a son of the Republic&#x27;s head of government Francisco Largo Caballero and that Franco turned down the offer. Others contend that it was the Republican government who rejected the deal of the Nationalists and that General Franco approved several failed commando raids on the Alicante prison to try to rescue José Antonio. Either way the death of the founder of Falange rid the general of a formidable rival. Perhaps tellingly, it was well known that the two men disliked each other. After one of the two meetings they had, Franco dismissed José Antonio as &quot;a playboy pinturero&quot; (a foppish playboy). Elizabeth Bibesco&#x27;s last novel, &quot;The Romantic&quot;, published in 1940, starts with a dedication to José Antonio Primo de Rivera, whom she had known during her stay in Madrid where her husband, Prince Antoine Bibesco, was a diplomat from Romania in Spain between 1927 and 1931: &quot;To José Antonio Primo de Rivera. I promised you a book before it was begun. It is yours now that it is finished – Those we love die for us only when we die–&quot;.

== Post-mortem relevance ==

Falange joined the military uprising against the Republic. The initially marginal party gained ascendancy over the course of the war, partly as a result of its prominent role in the brutal repression that took place behind Nationalist lines. Nevertheless, the party lost autonomy, and in 1937 was made wholly subservient to the will of General Franco when he had Primo de Rivera&#x27;s temporary replacement, Manuel Hedilla Larrey, thrown in jail, tried and sentenced to death (although his sentence was commuted). Franco decreed the merging of the Falange Española de las JONS with the Carlist traditionalists through the Unification Decree, and became the national chief of the new party, FET y de las JONS.

The reign of Francisco Franco nurtured a convenient cult of personality around the dead figure of Primo de Rivera whom Falangists dubbed &quot;El Ausente&quot; (The Missing One). This name was created during the period after de Rivera&#x27;s execution but before this was officially confirmed to the Nationalist public at large by its leadership on 18 July 1938. While the Falangist leadership knew the truth, they chose to keep it a secret for fear of the impact it would have on morale, though rumours of his death would continue to circulate for the period. Thus until this date many Falangists had lived in hope that de Rivera would still return (commonly saying &quot;when José Antonio comes back&quot;) and began referring to him as &quot;The Absent One&quot;, a reference to the Falange&#x27;s tradition of calling &quot;present!&quot; when the names of the fallen were read out. The founder of Falange was anointed a martyr of the &quot;crusade against Marxism.&quot; Notwithstanding the apparent veneration by the Francoist State, it remains true that the Missing One&#x27;s demise had removed a dangerous opponent: Primo de Rivera had been Marquess, a doctor of civil law, a political thinker; Franco owned no comparable pedigree, no comparable education and no personal ideology.

The postwar cult of personality had two ubiquitous icons. The first, a funereal slab placed on the external wall of many churches and cathedrals which bore the crowning inscription, &quot;Caídos por Dios y por España&quot; (&quot;Fallen for God and for Spain&quot;), followed by a list of local Nationalists killed during the war; Primo de Rivera&#x27;s name headed every list. The second was the rallying cry, &quot;&quot;José Antonio—¡Presente!&quot;,&quot; a figurative reply to an imaginary roll call invoking his ghostly attendance or immanence.

With the arrival of democratic rule, the legacy of Primo de Rivera and the cult of personality created by the Spanish state started to wane circumspectly. In 1981, the Madrid City Council moved to reinstate the original name of its grand avenue, the Gran Vía, which Franco had renamed &quot;Avenida José Antonio Primo de Rivera&quot; in 1939. However, as late as March 2005, the Guadalajara City Council removed a memorial to the founder of Falange under cover of darkness.

=== Burial ===
At the end of the war in 1939, the remains of Primo de Rivera were carried on the shoulders of Falangist relay teams from Alicante to Madrid (a 300-kilometre journey) and provisionally interred at El Escorial. The church had contained the pantheon of Spanish monarchs but Primo de Rivera was buried directly in front of the altar.

==== Reburial at the Valley of the Fallen ====
In 1959, Primo de Rivera was exhumed and re-interred 13 km away in the basilica of the Valley of the Fallen, located in the Guadarrama mountain range.
Between 1975 and 2019 Francisco Franco was buried nearby.

In the context of making the site less partisan, Franco&#x27;s remains were removed from the Valley. This did not establish a clear precedent for moving Primo de Rivera, given that he died a victim of the Civil War like most of the other burials at the site. However, in late 2022 it was reported that Primo de Rivera&#x27;s family had requested the exhumation of his remains on the grounds that the deceased wanted a Catholic burial. The Democratic Memory Law of 2022 envisaged the future of the Valley of the Fallen as a civil cemetery, and accordingly the government proposed to deconsecrate the crypt of the church in order to promote national reconciliation.

==== Reburial at San Isidro cemetery, Madrid ====
Primo de Rivera&#x27;s family arranged for his remains to be exhumed from the Valley in April 2023 and reburied in Saint Isidore Cemetery in Madrid.

==Ideology==

He espoused an elitist understanding of politics, influenced by the ideas of Ortega y Gasset. His political thought fascistised as he progressively radicalised in an anti-conservative direction. Primo de Rivera put much faith on corporatism, one of the few early Falangist tenets framed in positive terms, adopted from Italian Fascism.

Regarding political violence, he early alluded to what he famously termed as the &quot;dialectics of fists and guns&quot;, already stating during the Falange foundation event at the Teatro de la Comedia, that in order to fulfill the desired cultural and historical regeneration of Spain, &quot;if this has to be achieved through violence, we shall not be stopped by violence&quot;. Willing to offer an alternative to the most basic fundamentals behind liberal democracy, he also non-accidentally addressed some words of scorn to &quot;that terrible man who was called Juan Jacobo Rousseau&quot; during the foundational meeting of the Falange.

Like other Falangists, Primo de Rivera partially embraced the sense of Castilianist essentialism from the Generation of &#x27;98, but, conversely, he was also distinctly aware of the cultural plurality of the peoples in Spain, and thus the Falangist national project for Spain was framed following the &quot;orteguian&quot; legacy as one of &quot;unity of destiny in the universal&quot;. It has been noted that at some point he benignly put his hopes on politicians far from his own Fascist stances such as republican Manuel Azaña (in this case for a very brief time) or socialist Indalecio Prieto as potential candidates to alleviate his self-imposed burden for &quot;saving&quot; the country.

According to Álvarez Chillida, Primo de Rivera&#x27;s written works did not feature a marked antisemitism when compared to other Falangist leaders.

<text>Chackmore is a hamlet in the parish of Radclive-cum-Chackmore, in north Buckinghamshire, England. The hamlet is approached using the avenue that links Buckingham with Stowe Park.

==History==
The hamlet name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means &#x27;Ceacca&#x27;s moor&#x27;. It has been suggested though that the first part of the name could stem from the ancient word &quot;ceacce&quot;, meaning &#x27;hill&#x27;. The hamlet was first recorded in manorial rolls in 1241 as &quot;Chakemore&quot;. It has also occasionally been recorded as &quot;Chalkmore&quot;.

Main Street in Chackmore was originally flanked by thatched cottages, only two of which retain thatched roofs following a fire that swept the entire length of the village some one hundred and fifty years ago. The main thoroughfare was dissected by a huge tree known as the Cross Tree, which served as a moot or meeting place for the villagers. This was removed some time during the last 20 years and replaced by a roundabout.

A lane running off the main street eventually becomes a cul-de-sac called The Maltings. This suggests there was once a brewery somewhere nearby though no records exist to that effect. Opposite the primary school a cobbler named Billy Ayers used to work from a small shed in his garden and his clientele included not only the local residents but also the pupils and staff of Stowe School. This provided an extremely busy and important cottage industry and was operational up until the mid-1970s.

There are several listed buildings located on Main Street, some dating from the 17th and 18th century.

==Education And Amenities==
The village is home to St James and St John Church of England Primary School which was formed in September 2006 by merging Akeley Church of England School and Chackmore Church of England School, and by extending the merged school from a first school to a combined school.

Chackmore also has a playschool situated within the grounds of St. James and St. John Primary School. The playschool is run by a voluntary committee and takes children from 2 years old to 4 years old. The playschool was founded in 2002 with the help of Lottery funding.
The village also has a pub called the Queens Head and a parish hall, which was re-done in 2010 with a sum of money from the will of Mr T.Clinton. The parish hall is also used for polling stations.

==Parish==
Chackmore is located in the civil parish of Radclive-cum-Chackmore, in the district of Aylesbury Vale. Chackmore is the larger of the two villages and is estimated to have a population of around 180 out of a combined parish total of 236. The parish church is located in Radclive, and is part of the Buckingham Benefice. The A422 bisects the parish, with Chackmore to the north and Radclive to the south.

<doc id="401548" wikidata="Q58275" url="?curid=401548" title="Henry Lawrence (Indian Army officer)">
<text>Brigadier General Sir Henry Montgomery Lawrence, (28 June 1806 – 4 July 1857) was a British military officer, surveyor, administrator and statesman in British India. He is best known for leading a group of administrators in the Punjab affectionately known as Henry Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Young Men&quot;, as the founder of the Lawrence Military Asylums and for his death at the Siege of Lucknow during the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

==Background==
Lawrence was born in June 1806 into an Ulster-Scots family at Matara in Ceylon. Both his parents were from Ulster, the northern province of Ireland. His mother Letitia was the daughter of the Rev. George Knox from County Donegal, while his father, Lieutenant-Colonel Alexander William Lawrence, was born the son of a mill owner from Coleraine, County Londonderry, entered the service of the British Army and achieved distinction at the 1799 Siege of Seringapatnam. The Lawrences had seven sons, the first died in infancy and the fifth at the age of eighteen. The remaining five all achieved distinction in India; of them Sir George Lawrence and Lord Lawrence would achieve particular fame.

In 1812, Lawrence, along with his elder brothers Alexander and George, was sent to Foyle College in Derry, a city in Ulster, where their uncle Rev. James Knox was headmaster. In 1818 he rejoined his parents in Bristol where they had since settled, and completed his schooling there. In August 1820 he again followed his elder brothers by entering the East India Company Military Seminary in Addiscombe, Surrey. (His father, having felt slighted by the lack of recognition afforded to him for his service in the British Army, encouraged his sons to instead enter the service of the East India Company in India.) Whilst at the seminary, he was saved from drowning by a fellow cadet Robert Guthrie MacGregor. On another occasion, he developed sympathy for a lady in poverty, and begged old clothes from his family which he then carried to her through the streets of London. That same lady would be remembered in his will some thirty-five years later. Contemporaries in his class at Addiscombe included Sir Frederick Abbott.

==Early career==
On passing out from Addiscombe in 1822 he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Bengal Artillery, arriving in India the following year. He was based at the Calcutta suburb of Dum Dum, where Henry Havelock was also stationed about the same time. He soon saw action in the First Anglo-Burmese War, and at the age of 18 Lawrence commanded a battery forming part of the Chittagong column which General Joseph Morrison led over the jungle-covered hills of Arakan. He served for two years in Burma, until the expedition was decimated by fever, and Lawrence nearly perished of the illness. He returned to Dum Dum, before being sent first to Penang and then Canton to convalesce. As these changes in climate failed to affect his health for the better, he was invalided back to England. During his furlough in England, he resided with his family in Bristol, where he would first meet his future wife Honoria Marshall, until the opportunity arose in the autumn of 1828 to assist in the trigonometrical survey in Ireland.

Lawrence set sail for India on 2 September 1829 with his brother John, who had recently completed his studies at the East India Company College. The brothers parted company in Calcutta, and Lawrence rejoined his regiment in Karnal on the Sikh frontier, where his elder brother George was now stationed. In 1831 he was transferred to the horse artillery in Cawnpore and the following year he passed examinations in Hindustani and Persian with the aim of earning a civil service posting.

===Revenue Survey of India===

In 1833 he was appointed an assistant to the Revenue Survey of India by Lord William Bentinck based at Gorakhpur. He was tasked with mapping out and marking the boundaries of villages and fields in certain large districts, classifying them in accordance with the quality of soil and extent of holdings and to investigate and record the rights of claimants. He soon perceived the urgent need for more canals, and more and better roads, urging that &quot;the farmer, the soldier, the policeman, the traveller, the merchant, all want more roads. Cut roads in every direction.&quot; During his time with the Survey, Lawrence was known for his zeal, discouragement of cheating and at times harsh treatment of bribe taking. In 1837, the secretary to the Board of Revenue remarked to the Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Provinces:

Lawrence went on to successfully accomplish this guarantee, and earned the nickname &quot;Gunpowder&quot; from James Thomason for his &quot;explosive force which shattered all obstacles&quot;. In 1835 his father died, and as such his military pension also ceased, leaving his mother Letitia penniless. Lawrence, along with his brothers, took on the responsibility of remitting allowances for their mother. In July 1837, his sweetheart Honoria Marshall arrived in Hooghly and they married at the Mission Church in Calcutta on 21 August. Honoria accompanied Lawrence to Gorakpur where she became an enthusiastic assistant in his work. By the close of 1837, Lawrence had completed his work in Gorakpur and set out for Allahabad the next district on his list. He continued with the survey until August 1838 when he was ordered to stand ready to rejoin his troop amid talk of war with Afghanistan.

===Ferozepore===
In October 1838, in the run up to the First Anglo-Afghan War, Lawrence departed Allahabad to join Alexander Burnes&#x27;s Horse Artillery, part of an &#x27;Army of the Indus.&#x27; At the time he received an offer of a hundred rupees a month from a Calcutta paper to act as a correspondent during the war, agreeing on the condition of anonymity, that he would not supply any information that was not above board, and that the money would be divided between the Calcutta Orphan Asylum and the Benevolent Institution. When the army was ordered to stand fast, he instead became assistant to Sir George Russell Clerk, adding to his political experience in the management of the district of Ferozepore. At Ferozepore, Lawrence was collector, magistrate, civil and military engineer, universal provider and paymaster to troops that passed through the district. He was called upon to settle a boundary dispute on the British side of the Sutlej, and so impressed where neighbouring chiefs of his sagacity and fairness a number of barons across the border and in the Cis-Sutlej states sought his assistance to settle their own boundary disputes. In June 1839 Maharaja Ranjit Singh died and talk of war with the Sikh Empire began. Lawrence, spent much of the period acquainting himself with knowledge of the history and culture of the Sikh Empire, and penned a romance of the Punjab to aid those who cared to learn more about the region.

===Peshawar===

When news of disaster came from Kabul in November 1841 he was at first tasked with pushing up supports for the relief of Sir Robert Sale and the garrison of Jalalabad. He was to prepare the way for a relief force through the four hundred miles between Ferozepur and the Khyber. He requested the assistance of guns from the Sikh authorities, who agreed on the condition of the willingness of the gunners themselves, who at first proved unwilling. He relocated to Peshawar where he was responsible for getting the Sikh allies in hand, and helping to prepare the army of Sir George Pollock. He had hoped to accompany Pollock in the Kabul Expedition in 1842, however his fellow agent Frederick Mackeson was preferred. Instead he was allowed to remain with his old corps until the Khyber Pass was won. At the conclusion of the war, he returned to Ferozepur where the Governor General of India met the armies of Pollock, Sale and Nott.

In January 1843, Lawrence left Ferozepur when he was appointed superintendent of Dehradun. It soon emerged that military officers were barred from this post, and so he was instead transferred to Ambala as the assistant to the envoy at Lahore. Soon after taking charge, he was instructed to lead a military expedition in Khytul and was thereafter ordered to administer the region. Despite his short time in Khytul, Lawrence introduced a number of reforms including reduced taxes, the abolition of forced labour, a prompt system of justice and punishing bribery and corruption. In addition where required he remitted the land tax owed by a cultivator until he could improve his condition, and made the cultivator undertake public works such as digging wells in lieu of payment. Lawrence soon became somewhat disappointed by his lack of recognition for his contribution in the war and constant moving between jobs. Later that year however he was elevated to the rank of Major and appointed to the well-salaried and prestigious post of the Resident of Nepal.

==Resident at Nepal==
Lawrence arrived in Kathmandu in November 1843, leaving his wife behind as European women were not allowed to enter the Kingdom at that present time. Shortly after arriving, as a gesture of goodwill, Honoria was granted a rare exception to join her husband. During his time in Nepal, under instruction not to interfere in the internal administration of the Kingdom, Lawrence devoted much of his time to literary pursuits, ably assisted by his wife. He wrote a defence of Sir William Macnaghten which included passages foreshadowing the later mutiny of 1857, in which he lamented the blind self-confidence of British policy in India, the unpreparedness for disaffection, a lack of supplies, and the weakness of British garrisons. He also became a contributor to the Calcutta Review edited by Sir John Kaye. In an article titled the Military Defence of our Indian Empire, he insisted on the need for the Government to be ready for war at all times, a view which was challenged by his editor. It was whilst in Kathmandu that Lawrence and his wife first proposed the idea of homes in the cooler hills for the children of serving British officers.

==Punjab==

In 1845, instability in the Sikh Empire led to growing tensions with neighbouring provinces. Lawrence&#x27;s articles in the Calcutta Review had caught the attention of Henry Hardinge, the new Governor-General of India, who was impressed by his knowledge of the region. Hardinge appointed Lawrence as his political assistant following the death of Major George Broadfoot at the start of the First Anglo-Sikh War. He was present at the decisive Battle of Sobraon which brought the war to a conclusion. As political agent, he responded to allegations that leading Sikh chiefs had betrayed their countrymen at Sobraon and sold the battle to the British, denying any knowledge of treachery on the part of the Sikh chiefs and interference by British officials.

===Lahore Durbar===
Following Sobraon, Lawrence counselled the Governor-General not to annex the Punjab but instead reconstruct the Sikh Empire, fenced in and fortified by British bayonets. This was provided for in the Treaty of Lahore, whereby a British garrison was to be based in Lahore to further this purpose. Lawrence spent the next three months as the agent in Lahore. In his diaries, Lawrence would later write of his intentions in his role:

During this time, he assisted in the sale of Kashmir to Gulab Singh, the Raja of Jammu as war indemnity, a move which caused considerable unrest in Lahore. When a rebellion broke out, presumed to have been instigated by Lal Singh in support of the existing Sikh governor, Lawrence personally accompanied a body of Sikh troops to Kashmir in support of Gulab Singh. Through his support of Gulab Singh, Lawrence was able to wield significant power over the new Maharajah of Jammu and Kashmir, inducing the leader to abolish sati, female infanticide and child slavery throughout his dominions, and attracting considerable financial support for his later philanthropic endeavours.

The terms of the initial treaty had permitted British troops to remain until the end of 1846. However at the request of the Lahore Durbar that troops remain until the new Maharajah reached 16, the Treaty of Bhairowal was signed. A key condition of the Treaty was that a Resident British officer, with an efficient establishment of assistants, was to be appointed by the Governor-General to remain at Lahore, with &quot;full authority to direct and control all matters in every Department of the State. Maulvi Sayed Rajab Ali of Jagraon (Ludhiana Dist) a close confidant of Sir Henry Lawrence played an important role in these negotiations&quot;. Lawrence was appointed to the role of Resident, and began assembling a team of officer assistants, who would become known as Henry Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Young Men&quot;.

===Interlude===
In 1848, following a year of relative peace in the Punjab, Lawrence was granted sick leave and accompanied Henry Hardinge to England where he was made a Knight Commander of the Bath on Hardinge&#x27;s recommendation. In March, Lawrence was officially replaced as the British Resident at Lahore by Sir Frederick Currie. The murder of two of his assistants, Patrick Vans Agnew and W. A. Anderson in Multan, and the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Sikh War hastened his return to India. He was present at the Battle of Chillianwala, and although lacking an official capacity, he played a key role in persuading Lord Gough not to withdraw his troops after the battle. The war was won by the East India Company and the Punjab became a province of the Bengal Presidency.

===Board of Administration===
The new Punjab province was to be administered under the superintendence of a Board of Administration and Lawrence was made its president. He was assisted on the Board by his brother John and Charles Grenville Mansel, under whom he retained his troop of hand picked assistants. As President, Lawrence travelled extensively in the province, each year travelling three or four months, each day riding usually thirty to forty miles. At each station he would visit public offices, gaols, bazaars, receive visitors of all ranks, inspect the Punjab regiments and police, and receive daily petitions sometimes numbering in the hundreds. In his diary he noted that under his administration they had raised five regiments of fine cavalry and infantry, six regiments of very good military police and 2,700 cavalry police, planted thousands of trees, ensured serais were ever-present on main roads, police posts every two or three miles, and steps were taken in education.

Despite the success of the Board of Administration, internal tensions had arisen and the new Governor General, Lord Dalhousie, preferred to invest power in the hands of single administrator. Part of the reason for this was Lawrence&#x27;s insistence on compensating the Sikh nobility and aristocracy who had suffered ruin following defeat in the Second Anglo-Sikh War. Lawrence, mindful of the potential for discontent to be sewn by disgruntled aristocrats, liberally offered financial assistance, a policy opposed by both his brother John and Dalhousie Both Lawrence and his brother John tendered their resignation, however Dalhousie chose John as his new Lieutenant-Governor. Dalhousie explained his decision by stating that after some years of military administration in the Punjab, there was now a need for a civil administration to which John Lawrence would be more suited. The decision deeply hurt Henry who felt he had proved his self-taught civil administrative abilities over the course of the previous twenty years.

==Oude and Rajputana==
Lawrence began his new role as the Governor-General&#x27;s Agent in Rajputana in 1853. Much of his energy was devoted to two principal causes, the abolition of widow-burning in Rajputana and reforming the prison system. Whilst in Rajputana his wife Honoria died and his health began to fail, prompting first a desire to succeed Sir James Outram as Resident at Lucknow, for which he was overlooked for a civilian, and thereafter a desire to undertake leave to England.

In 1856, Oudh had been annexed by the East India Company on the grounds of internal maladministration. The following March, Lawrence was appointed to the prestigious post of Chief Commissioner of Oudh. Under his predecessor Colville Coverley Jackson, much of the local aristocracy had fallen from grace and widespread unrest had come to the fore. An added concern was growing discontent amongst the Sepoys of the Bengal Army, a large proportion of whom were drawn from Oudh, and thus able to command support in the province. Lawrence had long taken an interest in the sepoy army, noting its defects, and advising successive Governor-Generals of the need to listen to concerns of the soldiery and implement reform, and as such was wary that any insurrection amongst the sepoys could instigate a wider civil unrest.

==Siege of Lucknow==


In May 1857, two months after assuming his post in Oudh, the Indian Rebellion of 1857 commenced. Lawrence earned praise for the prompt and decisive handling of an insurrection of an irregular native regiment near Lucknow, and was in turn awarded full military and civil authority by the Governor-General, Lord Canning. He arranged for a garrison in Lucknow of some 1700 men, and took refuge in the British residency. Such was his assured handling of the crisis, that the British government and Board of Directors of the East India Company found it necessary to nominate him as provisional Governor-General of India in the event of the death or resignation of Lord Canning.

On the morning of 30 June, despite being weak and exhausted with illness, he led a march towards Nawabgunj to confront some mutinous regiments approaching Lucknow. Around six or seven miles from Lucknow he encountered 15,000 soldiers with thirty guns and soon after the artillery of the Oude irregular force deserted his command and joined the mutineers. Significantly outnumbered Lawrence was forced into a retreat, suffering heavy losses. On their return, the Residency was soon besieged by mutineers and the Siege of Lucknow commenced. On 1 July, a shell burst into his quarters in the upper part of the Residency, and despite pleas from his officers he refused to move his quarters to a safer area. The following day, whilst lying on a couch, a shell burst beside him and shattered his thigh. Dr Joseph Fayrer was summoned to provide consultation, and decided that amputation would only increase his suffering, and was likely to shorten his life. Fayrer gave him three days to live. Lawrence lingered until the second day, and died at approximately eight in the morning on 4 July 1857.

He was buried that same evening in a soldier&#x27;s grave, and it is said that not a single officer saw the lowering of his body into the ground so furious was the fighting raging at the time. When Lawrence was critically injured and aware he was dying, he gave final orders to his nominated successor at Lucknow, Major John Banks, who immediately recorded them in writing. The twelfth among his fourteen directions was &quot;Put on my tomb only this; Here lies Henry Lawrence who tried to do his duty.&quot; This epitaph appears on his tombstone at the Residency graveyard.

==Educational institutions==
Lawrence established institutions for the education of the children of British soldiers, known as the Lawrence Military Asylums, at four places in British India. Three of these institutions survive today as the prestigious Lawrence School, Sanawar (HP, India), Lawrence School, Lovedale (TN, India) and Lawrence College, Ghora Gali (Murree, Pakistan): the fourth, which does not survive, was at Mount Abu, in present-day Rajasthan.

Following the Disruption of 1843, along with Sir James Outram, Lawrence supported Reverend Alexander Duff in establishing the Free Church Institution in Calcutta, as a rival institution to the General Assembly&#x27;s Institution, which had been founded by Duff in 1830. These two institutions would later be merged to form the Scottish Churches College, known since 1929 (when the Church of Scotland was unified) as Scottish Church College.

==Family life==
Lawrence married Honoria Marshall at St. John&#x27;s Church, Calcutta, on 21 August 1837. They had four children. In 1858, his eldest son Alexander was created 1st Baronet Lawrence, of Lucknow, in consideration of his father&#x27;s services.

==Works==
*
*Lawrence also contributed to the &quot;Calcutta Review&quot;.

==Commemoration==
Lawrence is commemorated by a high cross in the cemetery adjacent to the Residency in Lucknow. There is a monument to him by J.G. Lough in the south transept of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London and a memorial by J.H. Foley at St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in Calcutta.

He is also remembered in the names of: 
* Henry Lawrence Island in the Indian Ocean, at 12N 93E.
* The town of Lawrence in New Zealand.
* The Lawrence Arms public house in Southsea, Hampshire.

<text>The National Space Centre is a museum and educational resource covering the fields of space science and astronomy, along with a space research programme in partnership with the University of Leicester. It is located on the north side of the city in Belgrave, Leicester, England, next to Space Park Leicester and the River Soar. Many of the exhibits, including upright rockets are housed in a tower with minimal steel supports and a semi-transparent cladding of ETFE &#x27;pillows&#x27;, which has become one of Leicester&#x27;s most recognisable landmarks. The National Space Centre contains the United Kingdom&#x27;s largest planetarium. It is a registered charity with a board of trustees.

==History==

The initial idea of a space centre as a research facility but with public access, attached to the University of Leicester, was first conceived in the 1980s – the idea of Professor Alan Wells, the Director of the University of Leicester&#x27;s Space Research Centre, and Professor Ken Pounds of the university. The plan was not taken further due to lack of funds.

The Space Centre as a museum was then put forward in 1995 – by Professor Alan Wells; Professor Alan Ponter, the University of Leicester&#x27;s pro vice-chancellor; and Nigel Siesage, the university&#x27;s principal assistant registrar.

Funding for the project came from the Millennium Commission, who provided 50% of the £52miliion capital cost, four major partners; Leicester City Council, the University of Leicester, East Midlands Development Agency and BT; along with contributions from exhibition sponsors, Walkers, the Met Office, Omega, BNSC and Astrium.

The first element of the project was the Challenger Learning Centre which opened at Leicester University in December 1999 and moved to the National Space Centre site a year later. It was the first such centre outside North America, where 42 similar centres existed. The centre was split in two, with one half replicating the inside of a spacecraft and the other, mission control.

Originally it was to be called the National Space Science Centre, but in December 2000 the word science was dropped from the name for marketing reasons. (The National Space Centre was often confused with the British National Space Centre, until they changed their name to the UK Space Agency)

== Opening ==
On 30 June 2001, former NASA astronaut Jeffrey A. Hoffman opened the National Space Centre officially to the general public. In its first five months, the National Space Centre received 165,000 visitors, 25% ahead of its targets and was named museum of the year by the Good Britain Guide, 2002.

At opening, the centre was the base for more than 60 scientists and astronomers working on projects in a Space Science Research Unit (SSRU).

Although this was his first physical visit, during his mission he linked live from space to the National Space Centre on two occasions, answering questions from school children and the media.

== Architecture ==
Nicholas Grimshaw, the architects of the Eden Project, won an architectural competition to design the National Space Centre in September 1996 beating four other architects. The fit out of the building was undertaken by C-Beck Group. Structural and services engineer was Arup, Quantity surveyor was Capita Property Services, project manager was Gardiner and Theobold +Management services and main contractor was Sir Robert McAlpine. Landscape architect was Land Use Consultants, Cladding consultant was Montressor Partnership and acoustics engineer was Sandy Brown Associates. The tower is tall and claims to be the only place to house upright space rockets indoors.

=== Building ===
The 7,360m2 scheme occupies a former storm water tank, which now forms the foundations of the building, reducing costs and maximising the reuse of the existing structure. The main rocket tower is clad in inflated pillows made of ETFE – the same material used on the Eden Project domes. This material is 1% of the weight of the equivalent amount of glass. The building was described by The Guardian as &quot;One of the most distinctive and intriguing new buildings in Britain&quot; The main building is a 7200m2 box built on a 14m grid steel frame, clad in a perforated metal skin that conceals the windows and louvres in the profiled steel cladding behind. The roof of the main building is overlaid with gravel in three colours to form a crab nebulae design.

Construction began on the site in March 1999.

==Galleries==
The National Space Centre has six main galleries, a welcome hall, an area for space talks, a planetarium and a spaceflight simulator. It also has a café and various conference and teaching rooms.
=== Welcome Hall ===

This entrance area contains a Soyuz spacecraft, and a set of spacesuits including Tim Peake&#x27;s spacesuit, Buzz Aldrin&#x27;s underwear and a spacesuit from &quot;The Martian&quot; film.

=== Into Space ===
A gallery dedicated to space flight which includes a mock-up of the &quot;Columbus&quot; module from the International Space Station and a space toilet.

=== The Universe ===
This gallery covers the formation of the universe, how humans observe it and the search for alien life.

=== Our Solar System ===
The planets of the Solar System are the subject of this gallery which includes the TinyTarium, a planetarium especially for the very young visitor.

=== Home Planet ===
A gallery with the planet Earth as its subject - how it is observed how it is changing, and the consequences of human actions.

=== Space Oddities ===
This is an area where selected artefacts from the National Space Centre&#x27;s collection are exhibited. The gallery is updated regularly by the curator in order to display lesser known objects with unique histories.

=== Rocket Tower ===

The rocket tower features stories from the space race, and the two upright rockets it was specially designed to house, a PGM-17 Thor Able and a Blue Streak. The Rocket Tower also displays a piece of Moon rock.

=== LIVE Space ===
LIVE Space is an area where talks, live link-ups, news from space and science demonstrations are presented.

In July 2005 it opened the Human Spaceflight Gallery, a lunar base set in the year 2025, dubbed Tranquillity Base. Visitors received a barcode and undertook a number of interactive tasks. It also included a space ride.

=== Sir Patrick Moore Planetarium ===

On 26 January 2012, Sir Patrick Moore visited the National Space Centre to launch the planetarium, newly renamed in his honour. He also launched a new planetarium show, &quot;Tour of the Night Sky&quot;, that included a series of &#x27;best-of&#x27; clips hosted by Sir Patrick himself.
A full dome planetarium which is used to project a variety of immersive shows many of which are created by NSC Creative who are based at the National Space Centre. The planetarium has 192 seats and 6 accessible spaces.

=== Tetrastar Spaceport ===
Launched in 2022, this is a simulated low Earth orbit cruise onboard a spacecraft.

== Notable exhibits ==
A selection of objects held in the National Space Centre&#x27;s collections can be viewed online at the National Space Centre Collections Online.

=== Moon rock ===
A piece of real Moon rock prised from a fractured boulder near the rim of Shorty Crater. This was collected by Gene Cernan in December 1972 during Apollo 17, the last crewed mission to the Moon. The fragment weighs 120g and is encased in a protective atmosphere.

=== Sputnik ===

A mock Sputnik, whose manufacture was overseen by creator Sergei Korolev, who demanded perfectionism; he once berated a junior technician with the words “This will be exhibited in museums”

=== Space toilet ===

A demonstration example of a Russian space toilet, constructed by NPP Zvezda. The appearance and size are the same as the type of toilet used on the Russian Mir space station. As a demonstration model it lacks the technological units needed for processing liquid and solid waste.

=== Martian spacesuit ===

An EVA Spacesuit used during the filming of Ridley Scott&#x27;s 2015 film, &quot;The Martian&quot;. Worn by Matt Damon and various stunt performers, it was used with a rigging system to simulate floating in space. The costumes used in the film were designed to be accurate reflections of the sort of spacesuits that might be used in a near-future Mars mission. Academy Award-winning costume designer Janty Yates worked with NASA and Scott to ensure that this Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) spacesuit worked for the film, but also imagined the future of NASA spacesuit design.

=== Beagle 2 Operations Centre ===
Mission control for the Beagle 2 mission to Mars was based at the National Space Centre and was the first NASA or ESA mission to be run in the full view of the public. Beagle 2&#x27;s robotic arm, known as the PAW, was developed by a team led by the University of Leicester Space Research Group who also led on the technical design and the flight operations development.
== Education ==
The National Space Centre provides education programmes that support parents and teachers to inspire children to learn about science.

=== e-missions ===
In 2004, working with the Challenger Center for Space Science Education, the National Space Centre launched e-Missions™ which included a mission to Europa where pupils have to save a crewed mission to Jupiter’s moon that is in trouble and Operation Montserrat, where pupils take the role of a military response team tasked to evacuate a population in the face of a hurricane and a potential volcanic eruption.

== National Space Academy ==
In 2008 a collaboration between the National Space Centre, University of Leicester, Nottingham University and East Midlands Development Agency resulted in the creation of the Space Academy.

The Space Academy collaborated with NASA’s Aerospace Educator Service Project and in 2010 led a session at the annual Space Exploration Educators Conference (SEEC) which draws in more than 600 teachers, space scientists and engineers from all over the United States, Canada, Europe and Japan. The Space Academy’s presentation on the ESA’s &quot;Rosetta&quot; mission was chosen to be streamed on the Internet by Space Center Houston.

Subsequently, the National Space Centre on behalf of the UK Space Agency, the Science &amp; Technology Facilities Council (STFC), the UK Space Education Office (ESERO-UK), and the European Space Agency, launched the National Space Academy in February 2011. It was set up to promote excellence in science and technology by training teachers, offering teaching resources, hosting career events and developing apprenticeship courses.

As of 2022 a Space Engineering course provides A-levels in physics and mathematics, plus a BTEC Extended Diploma in engineering. The course is delivered by Loughborough College and the National Space Centre, including physics and mathematics delivery in the National Space Academy Science Lab in Leicester.

The National Space Academy’s resources page includes lesson starter clips on astrobiology, space-themed videos in support of STEM lessons and videos and interactive experiences for home learning.

==Facilities==

===Digital visualisation===
The centre&#x27;s own digital visualisation team, NSC Creative, make all the &quot;fulldome&quot; planetarium shows shown at the centre. By 2011, NSC Creative fulldome shows are playing in over 220 planetaria in 27 countries worldwide. These productions include the official International Year of Astronomy (IYA2009) planetarium show &quot;We are Astronomers&quot; which was funded by the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC).

=== Near Earth Objects Information Centre ===
The NEO Information Centre&#x27;s launch was announced in January 2002 by the science minister, Lord Sainsbury. Based at the National Space Centre in Leicester, it was set up as part of the UK Government&#x27;s response to the report of the task force on Potentially Hazardous Near Earth Objects. It provided information to the public, media, educators and scientists on Near Earth Objects, the science behind them and the potential hazard they pose to life on Earth.

Government funding for the NEO Information Centre was not renewed in 2010 and the Leicester-based Centre was closed. Monitoring of near-Earth objects is currently undertaken by the Spaceguard Centre.

The National Space Centre receives no day-to-day funding from the government and generates revenue primarily from commercial activity such as ticket sales, café and gift shop revenue, venue hire and sponsorship.

Accounts for 2020 show that income was £5.4 million and expenditure was £5.9 million, of which £5 million was spent on charitable activities and the rest on activities to raise funds. As a charity the National Space Centre makes grants to organisations, provides human resources, provides buildings, facilities and open space, provides advocacy, advice and information and acts as an umbrella or resource body.

<doc id="401556" wikidata="Q252480" url="?curid=401556" title="Bamse">
<text>is a Swedish cartoon created by Rune Andréasson. The highly popular children&#x27;s cartoon first emerged as a series of television short films as well as a weekly half-page Sunday strip in 1966, before being published periodically in its own comic magazine since 1973.

Andréasson did all the artwork himself until 1975 and wrote all the comics until 1990. Francisco Tora did all the illustrations from 1976 until he was joined by Bo Michanek in 1983. Several new writers and illustrators were hired in the early 1990s, including Claes Reimerthi, Olof Siverbo, Johan Wanloo and Tony Cronstam. Andréasson continued to do the magazine cover illustrations until 1992.

The series somewhat changed direction when Bamse had children, specifically triplets, in 1982. He had a fourth child in 1986, and his friend Lille Skutt had one at the same time; this saw the series focus more on family, while also discussing other values such as gender equality. In 1989, the character Skalman noticed that Bamse&#x27;s fourth child Brumma had some intellectual disability, later defined as her being on the Autism spectrum, which again brought up the subject of equality. The children did develop in real time within the magazine, but seem to have been fixed in age since around 1990. They are now around nine years old, in a narratively advantageous eternal state as third-graders.

Both the early Sunday strips and the early magazines have since been reprinted as glossy hardbound volumes.

In 1998, the theme park (&#x27;Bamse&#x27;s World&#x27;) started as an attraction at the Kolmården Wildlife Park, with theater performances, restaurants and houses from the comic.

== Characters ==
=== Protagonists ===
* Bamse, the main character, is a brown bear who becomes the world&#x27;s strongest bear by eating a type of honey called (), specially prepared for him by his grandmother. Almost anyone else who eats it, apart from Bamse&#x27;s pet bee and his daughter Nallemaja, ends up with three days of stomach ache. Bamse is also the kindest bear in the world (according to the comic), and is often seen helping those in need. The name comes from a Scandinavian word for &#x27;bear&#x27; or &#x27;teddy bear&#x27;. can also translate to &#x27;giant&#x27; or &#x27;big one&#x27;, though that would be something of a misnomer, as Bamse is rather diminutive in size compared to many of the other characters.
* Brummelisa (&#x27;Growlelisa&#x27;) is the daughter of a forester who could always rely on Bamse helping out; soon they fell in love. In 1981, they all went on a boat trip to the north of Scandinavia (financed by individual odd jobs), climaxing in a view of the midnight sun (an anti-climax to grandma&#x27;s cat and mouse who expected it to look different). Back home, Brummelisa and Bamse staged a secret wedding and became parents to triplets: Brum (&#x27;Growl&#x27;), Teddy, Nalle-Maja (&#x27;Teddy-Maja&#x27;). Brum is artistically gifted, but somewhat shy. Teddy spends a lot of time by himself, and loves reading and learning. Nalle-Maja is the most extrovert kid, and loves sports and activities. Once their personalities began to shine through Teddy gravitated towards Skalman who noticed what the others failed to; Teddy&#x27;s clumsiness stems from his eyesight and only needed a pair of glasses. Nalle-Maja has inherited more than just her father&#x27;s looks; she also inherited his ability to get strong from the &#x27;. To prevent her from injuring herself or her brothers, Bamse&#x27;s grandmother attempted a new &#x27; recipe to avoid making her strong. She partially succeeded; Nalle-Maja draws strength from it, but also winds up with the stomach ache. In late 1985 the triplets were informed on the arrival of another sibling; Brumma (&#x27;Growla&#x27;), who – when eating &quot; – neither gets strong nor is affected by the stomach ache.
* Lille Skutt (&#x27;Little Hop&#x27;) is Bamse&#x27;s and Skalman&#x27;s best friend. He is a very fast but notoriously frightened white rabbit with a red bow tie. However, his ability to run quick and jump far (not to mention braving his fears whenever someone he cares about is in danger) has saved his friends&#x27; skins on more than one occasion. Lille Skutt is the village postman, albeit on a part-time basis. He also works part-time as the head chef of the local restaurant. Like Bamse, Skutt ended up marrying his girlfriend, Nina Kanin (&#x27;Nina Rabbit&#x27;), best friend of Brummelisa. Nina and Skutt became parents to a son, Mini-Hopp (&#x27;Mini-Hop&#x27;), a hyperactive child with an apparent lack of fear. He has eight siblings, including Happ. Happ is a gay rabbit. He and his life-partner Lille Sixten have adopted a little girl named Suddan, who is slightly younger than Mini-Hopp.
* Skalman (&#x27;Shellman, Shellback&#x27;) is an ingenious tortoise who invents all sorts of things, including spacecraft and time machines. He stores just about anything in his carapace except for locomotives, spaceships or atlantic steamboats (and also firewood, due to him getting splinters in the back). Skalman seems to be a polyphasic sleeper, and according to himself, his best invention is the food-and-sleep clock, whose calls he follows slavishly, even at times when sleep seems highly inappropriate. To this date, he has only ignored the alarm call a few times, including the discovery of a dinosaur&#x27;s egg, the birth of Bamse&#x27;s children, and a state of deep depression due to the false belief that his carelessness had caused the death of Bamse&#x27;s children. Also, he has once mentioned that he is in one way unlike everyone else – if he would actually eat sleeping draught, he cannot sleep at all for a quite long time – not even when the alarm calls. None of the other characters come close to Skalman&#x27;s intellectual level and he is sometimes seen playing chess with himself (he has stated that he has met and beaten the chess world champion). Rune Andréasson said that he brought the food-and-sleep clock into the series for much the same reason as the &quot;; during a dangerous adventure, Skalman could just pull something out of his carapace to save them, or help the trio with his intellect. That is when the food-and-sleep clock calls Skalman to sleep, forcing Bamse and Lille Skutt to think on their own.
* Vargen (&#x27;The Wolf&#x27;) is a black wolf who was the original main villain (later antihero) of the comic; a criminal and a bully who at one point was named &quot;World Champion of Evil&quot; by his colleagues, but later on proved to not be such a bad person if given a chance. Vargen grew up on the wrong side of the tracks and was introduced to a life of crime by his villainous stepfathers. When they eventually ended up in prison he knew that it was time to make a fresh start but his past turned against him as nobody wanted to give him the chance to better his life. Bamse, however, did, and eventually managed to reform the wolf by consistently treating him with kindness. Vargen occasionally slips back into his old ways, but as far as the other wolves are concerned he blew it by joining Bamse&#x27;s club.

=== Antagonists ===
* Krösus Sork (&#x27;Croesus Vole&#x27;) is an often cruel capitalist and secondary villain of the comic; born as a banker&#x27;s son he was forced to play second fiddle to his brother Slösus (rough translation &#x27;Wasteus&#x27;) who could not put a foot wrong. After Slösus later won a lottery (ticket number 88), Krösus forged his own ticket (number 89), switched the tickets, claimed Slösus&#x27; prize and let the unknowing Slösus get detained for forgery while using the prize to build up his criminal empire. Slösus was devastated to discover the truth after his release and they had a falling-out. While Krösus has on occasion showed some small shred of conscience and generally commits crimes for self-profit and not out of cruelty, he seems the most amoral of the series&#x27; classic villains, willing to do just about anything that will improve his net worth. He displays an opulent lifestyle, regularly smoking expensive cigars (which he frequently swallows, while burning, when Bamse unexpectedly thwarts his schemes) and is never seen without his signature top hat, striped trousers and wingtip shoes, and decorates his office with gold and artworks, but seems to primarily enjoy hoarding wealth rather than enjoy a life of luxury (one of several characteristics he shares with Scrooge McDuck). Krösus employs an army of voles for tasks such as burglary and fencing, generally avoiding punishment due to keeping his hands clean from dirt, on one occasion literally (disposing his gloves to avoid marks from handling inked money). As Bamse&#x27;s children remarks on one occasion he does not seem to have friends, with all his relationships (with the partial exception of his brother) being strictly transactional and any conversation not disclosing information or concluding an obligation is quickly terminated, with the moniker &quot;time is money!&quot;. In short, Krösus represents a crude image of the capitalist system and its logic, which featured prominently in early Bamse comics. 
* Kapten Buster (&#x27;Captain Buster&#x27;) and his three clumsy sideman pirates, Rusken, Slusken and Stollen (approximate translation: &#x27;Rover, Sloven and Silly&#x27;). They are largely incompetent and unsuccessful, and have mostly given up their life at sea thanks to a tendency towards seasickness.
* Knocke &amp; Smocke (&#x27;Knocker &amp; Socker&#x27;) are two large thugs with flat caps who have performed several unsuccessful criminal attempts. They usually rely mainly on brute force and are generally outwitted by Skalman or others.
* Reinard is a sly fox and the newest main villain of the comic, who became an addition to the crew in 2006. He is shown to engage in all kinds of villainy, from shoplifting to explicit attempts on Bamse&#x27;s life (which, curiously, has resulted in no retribution, or even rebuking, from Bamse&#x27;s side). Reinard is narcissistic, completely selfish with no seeming regard for others&#x27; well-being; in addition, he frequently manipulates other characters into committing immoral acts seemingly for his own amusement, which make him the perhaps most vile (or even psychotic) character in the Bamse universe. While Reinard may appear irredeemable, his &quot;weak spot&quot; is his romantic attachment to Mickelina, also a fox, which has blurred his evil schemes on numerous occasions.

== Moral values and criticism ==
The magazine has educational goals. On special &quot;school&quot; pages, the characters educate the reader about animals, cultures, the Universe, and other subjects. They often deal with superstition, and Skalman&#x27;s sceptical views (&quot;I only believe in what I know&quot;) wins over those of his more naive friends. On the other hand, beings like trolls, tomtar and dragons exist on a very real plane in most of the stories. As the series has evolved, the values expressed have become more general and less ideological. A fact sheet written and published by Andreasson in 1983 following a trip to the People&#x27;s Republic of China became controversial as it seemed to praise Mao Zedong&#x27;s dictatorial rule as a &quot;liberation&quot; and claimed that &quot;nobody&#x27;s starving anymore&quot; in China under Communist single-party rule. It was later edited heavily when the adventure was reprinted in 2004.

Bamse and his friends are very clear about their views. They are strongly opposed to racism, bullying and violence. Bamse is not only the strongest bear in the world, but also the kindest, often repeating his slogan &quot;Nobody gets better from being beaten&quot;. Bamse&#x27;s own world seems to have strong implications of anarchism or libertarian socialism, combining private ownership with communitarian solidarity (from most of the characters), though a single policeman, Pontus Kask (named for his classic-style policeman&#x27;s helmet, or in Swedish) and a small prison exists.

The original villain, a black wolf simply called Vargen (&#x27;The Wolf&#x27;), became a friend of Bamse after consistently being treated kindly. The only villain that is depicted as unredeemable is Krösus Sork (&#x27;Croesus Vole&#x27;), a crude capitalist who will do practically anything for money. Later, the fox Reinard Räv (&#x27;Reinard the Fox&#x27;) was introduced, which contradicted this earlier narrative. While shown as on the edge of society, Reinard is intelligent but uses his skills and efforts at disrupting the social order as a good in itself. By enjoying turning people &quot;on the edge&quot; to a life of crime he displays outright antisocial characteristics, roughly mirroring Batman&#x27;s antagonist &quot;The Joker&quot; or Shakespeare&#x27;s Iago in this regard.

== Films and other media ==
Six animated black-and-white short films were produced for television in 1966. In 1972, seven more animated shorts were shown in colour. Another two shorts were released in 1981, and a direct-to-video film became available in 1991.

The later colour films have aired frequently on TV in Sweden, and have been released on VHS and DVD. The black and white films had been unavailable to the general public for a long time, but were released on DVD by late 2006. The colour films were low-budget productions with actor Olof Thunberg narrating and voicing all characters, but are considered to be classics. The musical theme, composed by Sten Carlberg, is easily recognised by most Swedes.

In 1993, a Game Boy game (in Swedish) was released, loosely based on the Bamse characters. The game was little more than a sprite replacement of Beam Software&#x27;s &quot;Baby T-Rex&quot; and received generally poor reviews. The &quot;Bamse version&quot; has not been officially released outside Sweden.

In October 2006, forty years after Bamse was created, Ola Andréasson, the son of creator Rune Andréasson announced an animated feature film, featuring better animation, a full voice cast, and a budget of SEK 25 million. The film was released in 2014 as &quot;Bamse and the City of Thieves&quot;. It was followed by &quot;Bamse and the Witch&#x27;s Daughter&quot; in 2016, &quot;Bamse and the Thunderbell&quot; in 2018, &quot;Bamse and the Volcano Island&quot; in 2021 and &quot;Bamse and the World&#x27;s Smallest Adventure&quot; in 2023.

== Translations ==
In the 1960s, there were a few translations of the series &#x27;Bamse&#x27;s school&#x27;, where the characters were given English names:

* Bamse &quot;– Bamsy&quot;
* Skalman – &quot;Professor Shellback&quot;
* Lille Skutt – &quot;Little Frisky&quot;
* Vargen – &quot;Willie&quot;
* Farmor – &quot;Granny&quot;
* Katten Janson (literally &#x27;Janson the Cat&#x27;) – &quot;Sooty&quot;

In this translation, the &quot;&quot; was given the name &quot;magic honey&quot;. However, in the 1980s, Andréasson referred to it in English as &quot;thunder-honey&quot;, which is the literal translation also used in the Netherlands and Belgium ().

In the cancelled film &quot;Bamse and the Time-Travel Machine&quot; from 2009, the names were translated differently:

* Bamse – &quot;Bamse&quot;
* Skalman – &quot;Shellman&quot;
* Lille Skutt – &quot;Little Skip&quot;
* Krösus Sork – &quot;Victor Vole&quot;
* &quot;&quot; – &quot;Superhoney&quot;

<text>ABC () is a Spanish national daily newspaper. Along with and , it is one of Spain&#x27;s three newspapers of record.

==History and profile==
&quot;ABC&quot; was first published in Madrid on 1 January 1903 by Torcuato Luca de Tena y Álvarez-Ossorio. The founding publishing house was Prensa Española, which was led by the founder of the paper, Luca de Tena. The paper started as a weekly newspaper, turning daily in June 1905. In 1928 ABC had two editions, one for Madrid and the other for Seville. The latter was named &quot;ABC de Sevilla&quot;.

On 20 July 1936, shortly after the Spanish Civil War began, &quot;ABC&quot; in Madrid was seized by the republican government, which changed the paper&#x27;s politics to support the Republicans. The same year &quot;Blanco y Negro&quot;, a magazine, became its supplement. The &quot;ABC&quot; printed in Seville was supportive of the Nationalists. In 1939 &quot;ABC&quot; in Madrid was given back to its original owners by Francisco Franco. During this period the paper was one of two major dailies in the country together with &quot;La Vanguardia Española&quot;.

&quot;ABC&quot; publishes in compact-sized stapled sheets, noticeably smaller than the loose tabloid format favoured by most Spanish dailies, including &quot;El País&quot; and &quot;El Mundo&quot;. Its cover distinctively features a full-size picture. In the late 1970s and 1980s, &quot;ABC&quot; had close connections with first Popular Alliance and later Popular Party. In the 1990s, the publisher of &quot;ABC&quot; was Editorial Española. The paper later moved from its historic landmark offices in Madrid by &quot;Paseo de la Castellana&quot;, which is now a shopping mall. The paper is part of Grupo Vocento, which also owns &quot;El Correo Español&quot;, &quot;El Diario Vasco&quot;, &quot;La Verdad&quot; and &quot;Las Provincias&quot;, among others.

=== Editorial stance ===
&quot;ABC&quot; is known for generally supporting conservative political views, and defending the Spanish monarchy. The paper has also a right-wing stance. Its director since 1983, Luis María Ansón, left the paper in 1997; he founded another daily, &quot;La Razón&quot;, which initially catered to even more conservative readers. Historically, it was noted in its heavy use of photography, and the front page is typically a large photo taking up to one third of the area. It has been recognized for its coverage of Spanish culture and arts.

===Archives===
On 25 September 2009, &quot;ABC&quot; made its complete archives, dating back to 1903, available online, giving modern readers a chance to see contemporaneous news about the Spanish Civil War or Francisco Franco&#x27;s death.

==Circulation and readership==
In February 1970 &quot;ABC&quot; had a circulation of 212,536 copies. It was 178,979 copies in February 1975, 171,382 copies in 1976, 145,162 copies in 1977. and 126,952 copies in 1978. The circulation of the paper was 135,380 copies in February 1980.

The 1993 circulation of &quot;ABC&quot; was 334,317 copies, making it the second-best-selling newspaper in Spain. In 1994. it was again the second-best-selling newspaper in the country with a circulation of 321,571 copies. In the period of 1995–1996 the paper had a circulation of 321,573 copies, making again it the second-best-selling paper in the country.

The circulation of &quot;ABC&quot; was 292,000 copies in 2001 and 262,874 copies in 2002. The paper had a circulation of 263,000 copies in 2003, being the fourth best-selling newspaper in the country. Based on the findings of the European Business Readership Survey &quot;ABC&quot; had 5,685 readers per issue in 2006. Between June 2006 and July 2007 the daily had a circulation of 230,422 copies. The 2008 circulation of the paper was 228,258 copies. It was 243,154 copies between July 2010 and June 2011.

Loughlin attended Oaks School No. 3 Elementary School in Oceanside, New York, and graduated from Hauppauge High School.

==Career==
Loughlin became interested in acting as a young child; she began her career at age 11 as a print model, recalling: 

At 15, she was cast in the ABC soap opera &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, playing the part of Jody Travis, an aspiring dancer, appearing in the series from 1980 to 1983. From 1983 to 1988, Loughlin appeared in more than a dozen feature films and television guest spots. She starred in the 1986 BMX classic, Rad.

From 1988 to 1995, Loughlin was cast in the ABC sitcom &quot;Full House&quot; as Rebecca &quot;Aunt Becky&quot; Donaldson, Danny Tanner&#x27;s (Bob Saget) co-host, and later, Jesse Katsopolis&#x27;s (John Stamos) wife. She was initially set for a six-episode arc, but then became a regular after becoming a popular character on the series. A few months after &quot;Full House&quot; ended, Loughlin co-starred with Tony Danza in the ABC sitcom &quot;Hudson Street&quot; (1995–96). The series was cancelled after one season.

In 1993, she starred in the television adaptation of Sidney Sheldon&#x27;s novel &quot;A Stranger in the Mirror&quot;, a on Groucho Marx and Erin Fleming, in which Loughlin plays Fleming&#x27;s role.

In 2007, Loughlin co-starred in the ABC sitcom &quot;In Case of Emergency&quot; with David Arquette.

Loughlin also was in attendance at Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;The Roast of Bob Saget&quot; which was hosted by John Stamos and premiered on August 17, 2008. At her table were &quot;Full House&quot; co-stars Dave Coulier and Jodie Sweetin. In 2010, Loughlin starred in the television film &quot;Meet My Mom&quot;, which premiered on the Hallmark Channel on Mother&#x27;s Day. For the network, she most notably starred in the drama &quot;When Calls the Heart&quot; and the telefilm series &quot;Garage Sale Mystery&quot; before she was fired in 2019. On April 10, 2019, it was reported that &quot;When Calls The Heart&quot; would be returning after a production hiatus without Loughlin&#x27;s character.

She co-starred in seasons one through three of the &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; spin-off &quot;90210&quot; as Debbie Wilson from 2008 to 2011. She reprised her role in the season five premiere episode in 2012.

Loughlin made a brief appearance as Aunt Becky, alongside John Stamos as Jesse Katsopolis, on a July 2013 episode of &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;, following a reunion performance by Jesse and The Rippers. She has since made several appearances as Rebecca on the &quot;Full House&quot; sequel series &quot;Fuller House&quot;, which premiered its first season on Netflix on February 26, 2016.

As a result of her involvement in the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal, the Hallmark Channel terminated their on-going business relationship with Loughlin on March 14, and edited out her previously recorded scenes from the yet un-aired season six of &quot;When Calls the Heart&quot;. On March 16, Netflix dropped her from &quot;Fuller House&quot;, and technology firm Hewlett-Packard announced it would remove Loughlin and her daughter Olivia Jade Giannulli from its advertising.

When the spinoff series &quot;When Hope Calls&quot; was renewed for a second season by GAC Family, however, Loughlin appeared in the late 2021 season premiere—her first television acting appearance since her arrest—reprising her role as Abigail Stanton, her character from &quot;When Calls the Heart&quot;. She later appeared in other GAC original movies.

In 2020, Loughlin and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud in connection with the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal. She was sentenced to two months in prison and was released in December 2020.

On Thanksgiving 1997, Loughlin eloped with fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, the creator of the Mossimo clothing line, whom she met in 1995. They have two daughters, Isabella Rose and Olivia Jade, and Loughlin is a stepmother to Gianni, Giannulli&#x27;s son from a previous marriage. Olivia has a YouTube channel and an Instagram account, both with more than 1 million subscribers/followers .

In 2020, Loughlin and her husband Giannulli sold their Bel Air estate for $18.75 million to Tinder co-founder Justin Mateen. The home was built in 1929 and was previously lived in by Harry Cohn, Johnny Hyde and Charles Bronson.

===2019 arrest===

Loughlin and her husband Giannulli were indicted by the FBI and U.S. Attorney for fraud and bribery offenses on March 12, 2019, in a nationwide college bribery scandal. The following day, Loughlin and her husband surrendered to federal authorities in Los Angeles. On May 22, 2020, Loughlin pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud, and her husband pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud and honest services wire and mail fraud.

Sentencing took place on August 21, 2020. Loughlin was sentenced to two months in prison while her husband was sentenced to five months. She served her two-month prison sentence at FCI Dublin in northern California from October 30, 2020 to December 28, 2020. At that time she was given a two-year supervised release, which expired in December 2022. In addition, she was fined $150,000 and ordered to complete 100 hours of community service upon her release. Giannulli was sentenced to five months in prison, fined $250,000 and ordered to complete 250 hours of community service. Giannulli reported to prison on November 19, 2020. On April 2, 2021, he was released to home confinement before completing his sentence on April 16, 2021. Loughlin&#x27;s daughters were able to remain enrolled at USC.

Additional fall-out occurred when Loughlin and Giannulli were named as defendants in a private class-action lawsuit brought by Stanford University graduates, who alleged their education and degrees had been devalued due to their school&#x27;s association with the case.

Loughlin poked fun at herself and the scandal in a cameo appearance in &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; (Season 12, Episode 6, &quot;The Gettysburg Address&quot;), where having been sponsored to get into an exclusive golf club she then fakes having a disability, cheats at the game, and issues bribes to get popular tee times.

<doc id="401577" wikidata="Q3111452" url="?curid=401577" title="Mui Wo">
<text>Mui Wo is a rural town on the eastern coast of Lantau Island in Hong Kong. The 2011 Census recorded 5,485 people living in Mui Wo and its environs.

Mui Wo (English: Mui Wo), formerly known as Mei Wo or Mei Wei (Cantonese: Wo and Wei are homophones), is located in the eastern part of Lantau Island in the New Territories of Hong Kong. Mui Wo has a beautiful environment and is a good place for vacationing in Hong Kong.

As early as the 16th century during the Ming Dynasty, farmers were already living in Mui Wo Valley. By the 19th century, it had developed into six villages. Mui Wo is located on Silvermine Bay, so named for the silver mines that were once worked along the Silver River () which flows through the village. The main beach in Mui Wo is known as Silver Mine Bay Beach (). The town is known for the feral water buffalos and cows that roam the area.

Prior to the Airport Core Programme and the subsequent development of Tung Chung and North Lantau into a new town, Mui Wo was the principal point for day-trippers setting out to explore Lantau Island. Today, it is still the principal way of reaching South Lantau – from the beaches in Cheung Sha to the fishing village of Tai O and the Tian Tan Buddha. With the opening of Ngong Ping 360 and the new, smoother Tung Chung Road, this may change.
==History==
The recorded history of Mui Wo dates back to the last days of the Southern Song dynasty. Fleeing south from the invading Yuan dynasty, in 1277 the Southern Song imperial court sought refuge in Silvermine Bay (at that time known as Mei Yu or 梅蔚). In March 1278, whilst attempting a further escape from the Mongols, the penultimate Song emperor Duanzong fell from a boat and almost drowned. After his rescue, he became ill and died a few months later at Mui Wo. Duanzong&#x27;s successor, Zhao Bing, was enthroned at Mui Wo on 10 May 1278.

Mui Wo is one of five villages of Lantau that were resettled when the coastal restriction of the Great Clearance was lifted in 1669. The other villages are Tung Sai Chung, Lo Pui O, Shek Pik and Tai O.

===Mining===
A silver and lead mine, close to the settlement of Pak Ngan Heung and Sivermine Waterfall, formally opened in March 1886. It had closed by the time China leased the New Territories to Britain in 1898. The main entrance is now called Silvermine Cave. People can only enter the first ten metres or so as the rest of the tunnels have been blocked off for safety reasons, and to prevent disturbance to the rare species of bats who live there.

===19–27 August 1945: Mui Wo massacre===
Japanese soldiers killed at least nine people and arrested 300 Mui Wo villagers in the weeks after Japan surrendered on 15 August 1945, ending the Second World War. Many victims were beaten and tortured. Some were beheaded.

Twelve Japanese soldiers who took part in the massacre were convicted of war crimes in 1946, and three of them hanged. The rest were sentenced to between two and ten years in jail. In their defence, the Japanese soldiers said they had been responding to a guerrilla attack after Japan&#x27;s capitulation. Their actions were to maintain law and order until they could formally surrender to Allied forces. The judge rejected their arguments, stating that the Mui Wo residents were not responsible for the guerrillas&#x27; actions.

==Villages==

Villages in the vicinity of Mui Wo include:
* Luk Tei Tong
* Mui Wo Kau Tsuen ()
* Pak Ngan Heung
* Tai Tei Tong
* Tung Wan Tau ()
* Wang Tong (橫塘)
* Wo Tin

==Sights==
Nearby attractions include Silver Mine Bay Beach, Silver Mine Waterfall and a temple dedicated to Man Mo, originally built during the reign of Wanli, emperor of the Ming dynasty (1573–1620). There is a small local museum with old photos of Mui Wo and rural artefacts located behind the Silvermine Bay Resort Hotel. The museum is open only on Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday afternoons.

===Silver Mine Bay Beach===

The beach is one of the five gazetted beaches on Lantau. Leisure and Cultural Services Department life guards patrol it and there is a shark net to protect swimmers April through October. There were 69,580 visitors during the seven-month-long official bathing season in 2012—an average of 201 on weekdays and 461 on weekends and public holidays. There were 4,550 visitors on the busiest day, and 16,900 during the busiest month.

Facilities include a fast food kiosk, BBQ pits(24nos), changing room, shower facilities, toilet, family changing room, babycare room and beach volleyball court. There is even a resort nearby.

==Education==
Heung Yee Kuk New Territories South District Secondary School

Closed in 2007. In 2009, residents protested against and blocked a plan for a rehabilitation centre for drug offenders—the Christian Zheng Sheng College—to take over the site. There is a campaign to reopen the school for local students, but the school was still empty in January 2025. Buddhist Fat Ho Memorial College attempted to obtain the site.

Mui Wo Primary School
The school celebrated its 70th anniversary in 2009.

Most of Lantau Island, Mui Wo/Silver Mine Bay included, is in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 98, which contains multiple aided schools on Lantau Island, including two in Tung Chung; no government primary schools are in this net.

Silvermine Bay School is a private Kindergarten and Primary School in Mui Wo.

==Future development==
The First-term Work Report of the Lantau Development Advisory Committee (LanDAC) was released in early 2016. The report proposes a new expressway linking Kennedy Town to Mui Wo, and the development of an &quot;East Lantau Metropolis&quot; at Mui Wo. In all, the report proposes housing up to one million residents on Lantau Island, up from the current figure of approximately 100,000.

==Notable residents==
The cartoonist Larry Feign, who wrote and drew &quot;The World of Lily Wong&quot;, lives in Wang Tong (橫塘), a village in Mui Wo.

==Transport==

===Sea===
Mui Wo is connected by ferry to Central (Central ferry pier number 6). Other ferry services link Mui Wo to Discovery Bay, Peng Chau, Chi Ma Wan and Cheung Chau.

===Land===
Buses operate from Mui Wo to other places on Lantau, including Tung Chung (3M) and thus Hong Kong Airport (A35) and the rail network. The major road South Lantau Road begins with Mui Wo and ends in Tai O, with Tung Chung Road branching from Cheung Sha to Tung Chung.

The South Lantau and Tung Chung Roads connect Mui Wo to the rest of Hong Kong&#x27;s road network. They are closed to private vehicles but local residents and businesses can apply for permits to use them.

Numerous hiking trails lead from Mui Wo to other parts of the island. The long hiking trail on the island, Lantau Trail, starts from Mui Wo. A much-frequented route leads north-east from Mui Wo to Discovery Bay via a pagoda, the Trappist Haven Monastery, and then either up the mountain via the Discovery Bay golf course or by the ocean via Nim Shue Wan.

===Air===
The Hong Kong Air Cadet Corps operate a helipad at the end of Mui Wo Ferry Pier Road that is close to the sewage plant.

==In popular culture==
MIRROR&#x27;s reality show &#x27;Be a Better MIRROR&#x27; by ViuTV is filmed in Mui Wo.

<text>Chartridge is a village in Buckinghamshire, England situated two miles north-west of Chesham.

Chartridge is also the name of a civil parish in Chiltern District which also includes the village of Bellingdon and the hamlets of Pednor, Hundridge and Asheridge. It was created in 1899 having previously been part of the parish of Chesham. The village is 34 miles northwest of London and the closest town is Chesham to the south with which it is closely associated. Until 1899 Chartridge was part of Chesham parish and post-Second World War residential housing has resulted in ribbon development stretching out along the Chartridge Road from the town to the village. 11 miles to the northwest is the county town of Buckinghamshire, Aylesbury.

==History==
The village name is Anglo Saxon in origin, &#x27;Cærdan-hrycg&#x27; means Caerda&#x27;s ridge, referring to the fact that the settlement sits on the top of a hill. There is no specific mention of Chartridge in the Domesday Book. In manorial rolls of 1191 it is recorded as &#x27;Charderuge&#x27; presumed linked to the purchase of lands by Robert de Charderugge. By the late 12th century parts of Chartridge were owned by the Sifrewast family. By the 13th century it has become incorporated into the names of local landowners and is referred to in conveyances.

There was no church in Chartridge village as it was historically part of the ecclesiastical parish of Chesham. However, as early as 1311 a private house, Great Hundridge Manor, was recorded as providing a chapel dedicated to King Edward the Martyr. There has been a Baptist Chapel in the village since the 18th century. In 1811 a house was registered for meetings of the Lower Baptist Church in Chesham, now known as the Trinity Baptist Church. Today the Baptist Chapel in the village is a branch of Broadway Baptist Church in Chesham. Services commenced in the early 19th century and in 1844 land close to the Bell pub was given for a chapel which was subsequently replaced by a new chapel in 1885 that was financed by public subscription.

Chartridge Lodge was greatly extended by the Franklin family who lived there from 1899. Today it is home to Chartridge Park, an 18-hole golf course, and a large Conference Centre. The Franklin family were also responsible for the building of several cottages within the village and conversion of a blacksmith&#x27;s shop into a Reading Room in 1903 to mark the coronation of King Edward VII. Subsequently, it was given by the family to the village and on becoming the village hall was used as a concert room, clubhouse and lending library and has been overseen from that time until the present by the Trustees of Chartridge Reading Room. Due to the absence of a parish church, from its earliest days the Reading Room was also used for religious services and a Sunday School associated with St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Chesham. Regular services ran from 1964 until 1974 during which it was known as St Christopher&#x27;s.

During the 19th century the vast majority of employment was provided by agriculture. Directly employing labourers as well as supporting trades such as blacksmiths. Income earned would have been spent in the licensed public houses, the Bell and Portobello Arms, the latter now a private house. In the early part of the 20th century there were four pheasant breeding farms due to the popularity of game shooting and convenience of improved travel by railway from London to Chesham. At least one farm continued in business until the Second World War.

From 1783 there are records of a Pest house in operation. The predominant infection of the time being small pox.

==Education==
An infant school opened in the 1850s providing education for 30 children. Today it is known as Chartridge Combined School and takes children from ages 5–11. The catchment area secondary schools are:- Chiltern Hills Academy and Chesham Grammar School in Chesham, Dr Challoner&#x27;s Grammar School for boys in Amersham and – Dr Challoner&#x27;s High School for girls in Little Chalfont.

<text>Major-General Sir Herbert Benjamin Edwardes (12 November 1819 – 23 December 1868) was a British administrator, soldier, and statesman active in the Punjab region of British India. He is best known as the &quot;Hero of Multan&quot; for his pivotal role in securing British victory in the Second Anglo-Sikh War.

==Background and early life==
Edwardes was born at Frodesley in Shropshire on 12 November 1819, the 2nd son of the Rev. Benjamin Edwardes (1790/1-1823), rector of Frodesley, a younger son of Sir John Thomas Cholmondeley Edwardes, 8th Baronet, of Shrewsbury (1764–1816). The Edwardes Baronetcy of Shropshire had been conferred on his ancestor Sir Thomas Edwardes by King Charles I in 1644/5.The baronetcy eventually became dormant on the death of the 10th Baronet Sir Henry Hope Edwardes to extant with Edwardes-Iddon which Edwardes are descended claiming succession to the title.

Edwardes&#x27;s mother died during his infancy, and from the age of four, following his father&#x27;s death in 1823, he was brought up in the household of a deeply religious aunt, from whom he developed his own strongly Protestant Christian faith. At the age of ten, he was sent to a boarding school at Richmond, Surrey, where he did not early distinguish himself. He went on to study Classics and Mathematics at King&#x27;s College, London, and developed there a great interest in modern literature, composing poetry and drawing. He played a prominent role in the debating society.

==Early service in India==
Having been prevented from going up to Oxford by pressure from his guardians, Edwardes determined himself on a career in India. He applied directly to Sir Richard Jenkins, of Bicton Hall, Salop, a deputy chairman of the East India Company, formerly of the Bombay Civil Service, Member of Parliament for Shrewsbury in 1837, and family friend, for a cadetship in the Bengal Infantry. He landed at Calcutta early in 1841, aged 22, and from July 1842 served as a Second Lieutenant in the 1st Bengal European Regiment, first at Dinapore and then at Karnal, a frontier station. He remained with this regiment about five years, during which time he obtained a good knowledge of the Hindustani, Urdu and Persian languages, passing exams in all 3 subjects, which qualified him for the position of interpreter, which he obtained in November 1845, aged 26. He developed a deep understanding of military, political and social affairs in India, which showed itself in his many literary contributions to the &quot;Delhi Gazette&quot; entitled &quot;Brahminee Bull&#x27;s letters to his Cousin John Bull&quot;, expressing bold political opinions often critical of British Indian policy. His essays became well-read throughout British India and particularly impressed the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army himself, Sir Hugh Gough, who appointed Edwardes a member of his personal staff.

==First Anglo-Sikh War==

Edwardes served as aide-de-camp to Gough during the First Anglo-Sikh War and fought at Mudki on 18 December 1845, where he was wounded, and at the final bloody rout of the Sikhs at Sobraon on 10 February 1846. Following the British victory, the Punjab came to be ruled by a British Resident seated at the historic capital of Lahore, supported by a Regency Council acting for the infant Maharaja Duleep Singh. In 1846, aged 27, Edwardes was appointed by the new British Resident Sir Henry Lawrence, as Assistant Resident. After three months at Lahore he was posted to the court of the Maharaja of Jammu, recently established by the British as ruler of Kashmir, divested from Punjab territorial lands following the Treaty of Lahore in 1846. Here he helped to suppress a local rebellion against the Maharaja, Gulab Singh.

==Founding of Edwardesabad==
In February 1847, aged 28, Edwardes was detached on special duty as Political Agent to the remote trans-Indus district of Bannu, where he was to improve the district&#x27;s tax-revenue yield to Lahore, much lessened of late by evasion and non-payment. Here backed by a small force of Sikh troops, but largely on the strength of his own personality, he completely reformed the administration. He settled local feuds and demolished local fortresses, built roads and canals and encouraged agriculture. The town established by him was named after his death in his honour &quot;Edwardesabad&quot;, a name which gave way after independence to Bannu, unlike the surviving name of Abbottabad, which commemorates Edwardes&#x27;s contemporary, General Sir James Abbott.

==Second Anglo-Sikh War==
The events and disturbances which grew into the Second Anglo-Sikh War of 1848–49 started at Multan, in southern Punjab, under the governorship of Dewan Mulraj, near which fortified town Edwardes found himself at the time, devoid of military support. Sensing that time was of the essence to prevent the rebellion spreading rapidly to the whole of the Punjab, and having no senior officer to consult, Edwardes made his response at first on his own initiative. He immediately raised a body of Pathan Irregulars and on 18 June 1848, having been joined by a force of Sikh troops, at Kineyri he routed a rebel force loyal to Dewan Mulraj. Subsequently, on 3 July, with reinforcements from his neighbouring District Officer Lieutenant Lake, and with troops sent by the Nawab of Bahawalpur from south of Multan, he defeated the rebels a second time at Sadusam, near Multan. Here he permanently injured his right hand in an accident with his pistol. Edwardes then forced the rebels to retreat to the fort of Multan, where they remained contained until the arrival of General William Sampson Whish and the Bombay column, whereupon, assisted by the further action of Edwardes&#x27;s force, a siege was established. On 22 January 1849 Dewan Mulraj surrendered, following negotiations directed by Edwardes. Sir Henry Lawrence praised Edwardes&#x27;s pivotal role in the war, stating that &quot;Since the days of Clive no man had done as Edwardes&quot;. All had been achieved by personal initiative, without formal military training. He was commended by Gough and the Government, promoted brevet major in September 1848 and made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB), in October 1849. The East India Company awarded him a specially struck gold medal for services in the Punjab.

He returned to a hero&#x27;s welcome in England and Shropshire, was thanked by both Houses of Parliament and on 12 June 1850 was awarded the degree of Doctor of Civil Law (DCL) by Oxford University. He was entertained at civic banquets in London and Liverpool, and made many well-received public speeches. While in England, on 9 July 1850, aged 31, he married Emma Sidney, daughter of James Sidney of Richmond, Surrey. It was most probably at this time his portrait was painted by Henry Moseley, showing him dressed as an Indian nobleman, which was presented by his widow in 1905 to the National Portrait Gallery. He published in 1851 an account in 2 volumes of his experiences during the war entitled &quot;A Year on the Punjab Frontier.&quot;

==Treaty with Afghanistan==
Edwardes believed that the security of British India against the designs of Russia would be improved on the North-Western Frontier by the existence of a strong and independent Afghanistan and he urged the signing of a British Treaty of Friendship with the Amir Dost Mohammad Khan. Although opposed by Sir John Lawrence, then Chief Commissioner of the Punjab, as the new ruling magistrate was known following the 1849 British annexation of Punjab, Edwardes&#x27;s suggestion received the approval of the Governor General of India Lord Dalhousie. The treaty was signed by Lawrence and the Amir on 30 March 1855. It contained a strict non-interference clause which turned out to be vital in maintaining calm in the Punjab during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 2 years later, thus allowing Punjab troops to be sent away to assist in the relief of Delhi and in subsequent operations.
A second treaty was signed in January 1857.

==Indian Rebellion of 1857==

On the outbreak of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 at far away Meerut and Delhi, Edwardes received the sanction of Sir John Lawrence, the successor in the chief magistracy of the Punjab to his elder brother Sir Henry Lawrence, to raise native troops in the Punjab to form a moveable column to maintain order in the Punjab. Lawrence later sent the large part of these troops and other units previously raised by his brother and new units raised by himself to assist in the Siege of Delhi. It was this decisive action of Sir John Lawrence&#x27;s, in taking the risk to leave the Punjab undefended, a policy opposed by Edwardes, which earned for him the sobriquet &quot;The Saviour of India&quot;.

==Interlude in England==

Aged 40, in mid-1859 Edwardes once more returned to England, his health so greatly impaired by the continual strain of arduous work that it was doubtful whether he could ever return to India. During his stay he was created KCB, with the rank of brevet colonel; and the degree of LL.D. was conferred upon him by the University of Cambridge. In 1860, he was invited to speak at the Wenlock Olympian Games, when he praised their founder William Penny Brookes and the local Olympian Society&#x27;s work but showed disagreement with the Greek influence of the name by publicly suggesting the games be called &quot;&#x27;The Shropshire Class of British Work and Play&#x27;, or anything else you will; but let it tell of English men and women.&quot;

==Commissioner of Ambala==
Early in 1862, aged 43, with improved health he again returned to the Punjab, and was appointed to the prestigious Commissionership of Ambala and as agent for the Cis-Sutlej states. After he had held the posts for 3 years, the health of both him and his wife deteriorated and on 1 January 1865, aged 46, he left British India for the last time.

==Later life and death==
Following his final return to England he was made Knight Commander of the Star of India (KCSI) on 24 May 1866 and promoted Major-General on 22 February 1868. He received a &quot;good conduct&quot; pension of £100.

He had been engaged for some time on writing a biography of his old chief Sir Henry Lawrence, and high expectations were held for the work, which he did not, however, live to complete, which task was performed by Herman Merivale. He suffered a bad attack of pleurisy in March 1868 from which he temporarily recovered, upon which he was offered the post of Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab in March 1868. His recovery however relapsed and he died in London on 23 December 1868, aged 49, after a severe haemorrhage.

He was buried in &quot;the Meadow&quot; on the western side of Highgate Cemetery and is commemorated by a mural tablet in Westminster Abbey and a stained glass window in the chapel of King&#x27;s College London. 

He was survived by his wife, Emma (nee Sydney), whom he had married in 1850.

==Christian Evangelism==
Edwardes was a devout Christian of the Protestant anti-ritualist variety. A contemporary point of contention on his career could be stated to be his propensity to evangelise amongst the indigenous populations of India. After the Indian Rebellion of 1857–8, caused in some measure by the sepoys&#x27; belief that their ancient religions were under attack with the sanction of the British-Indian regime, he continued, on his return to India in 1862, to enthusiastically urge the Government of India to publicly support the propagation of Christianity in India. Reputable biographers have gone so far as to call this attitude of his &quot;a considerable lack of common sense&quot;. He shared his strong evangelical Christian attitudes with his brother officer and close friend Brigadier-General John Nicholson. During his final period in England, he served as vice-president of the Church Missionary Society.

On 19 December 1853, a meeting was arranged under the Commissioner of Peshawar, Sir Herbert Edwardes, to discuss a Christian Mission to the city. The very first school in the province was established in 1853 by one of the first missionaries, Robert Clarke, under the patronage of Edwardes, today the High School, Kohati Gate Peshawar, Pakistan.

<doc id="401584" wikidata="Q3157271" url="?curid=401584" title="Jack McDowell">
<text>Jack Burns McDowell (born January 16, 1966) is an American former baseball player. A right-handed pitcher, McDowell played for the Chicago White Sox, New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians, and Anaheim Angels of the Major League Baseball (MLB). Nicknamed &quot;Black Jack&quot;, he was a three-time All-Star and won the American League Cy Young Award in 1993.

McDowell has also been a professional musician, most notably with the rock band stickfigure.

==Baseball career==

===Amateur career===
McDowell attended Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks, California. He was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the 20th round of the 1984 MLB draft, but did not sign.

He chose to attend Stanford University, where he was the co-Freshman of the Year in 1985, a second-team All-American in 1986 and a third-team All-American in 1987. He led the Cardinal to the 1987 College World Series championship.

===Chicago White Sox===
McDowell was drafted by the Chicago White Sox in the first round (fifth pick) of the 1987 amateur draft. After only six games in the minor leagues, he made his Major League debut on September 15, 1987. He pitched seven shutout innings against the Minnesota Twins that day to pick up the win. In four starts, he was 3-0 with a 1.93 ERA.

In 1988, he was 5-10 with a 3.97 ERA in 26 starts for the White Sox, but in 1989, while dealing with various injuries he did not pitch in the Majors, making 16 starts for the AAA Vancouver Canadians, where he was 5-6 with a 6.13 ERA.

By the early 1990s, he had established himself as one of the most dependable pitchers in the game, pitching effectively and recording over 250 innings each season from 1991 to 1993, he was selected to the Major League Baseball All-Star Game each of those years. He won 20 games in 1992 and 22 in 1993, when he won the American League Cy Young Award and led the White Sox to the postseason (they lost in the 1993 American League Championship Series to the Toronto Blue Jays). From 1988 until 1995, his season ERA was consistently between 3.00 and 4.00, well below the league average. In 1993, he set a modern (post-1950) record by recording a decision in each of his first 27 starts.

===New York Yankees===
After the 1994 season, McDowell was traded to the New York Yankees for minor league pitcher Keith Heberling and outfielder Lyle Mouton. McDowell spent one season in New York with the Yankees, ending the season 15-10 with a 3.93 ERA in 30 starts. He was perhaps best known for giving the finger to the fans at Yankee Stadium while being booed off the field after getting bombed by the White Sox on July 18, 1995, in the second game of a doubleheader. McDowell was also the pitcher who gave up the walk-off, series-winning hit to Edgar Martínez in Game 5 of the 1995 American League Division Series, scoring Joey Cora and Ken Griffey Jr. to eliminate the Yankees from the playoffs and send the Seattle Mariners to the American League Championship Series. This, coupled with the emergence of Andy Pettite who became the Yankees&#x27; ace the following season, resulted in McDowell becoming a free agent in the offseason.

===Cleveland Indians===
McDowell spent 1996–1997 with the Cleveland Indians. In 1996, he was 13-9 with a 5.11 ERA in 30 starts, but in 1997 he made only six starts due to an injury, which may have been made worse by his trying to pitch through it. McDowell&#x27;s injury resulted in the emergence of rookie Jaret Wright.

===Anaheim Angels===
He signed as a free agent with the Anaheim Angels in 1998 but was hampered with injuries during his time with the team. He was 5-7 with a 5.68 ERA in 18 starts over two seasons with Anaheim. He was released by the Angels after the 1999 season and retired from baseball.

===Coaching career===
On January 29, 2014, McDowell announced on his Facebook page that he had been hired to manage the Los Angeles Dodgers Rookie League affiliate, the Ogden Raptors, in the Pioneer League. In 2015, he was named manager of the Arizona League Dodgers. The Dodgers dismissed him after the season.

On March 2, 2017, Queens University of Charlotte, in Charlotte, North Carolina, announced that McDowell would be the head coach of its new baseball team. The team competed in its first season in 2018 as a club sport before entering Division II competition in 2019. On March 27, 2020, Queens University announced that McDowell stepped down as the head coach.

He has spent the 2021 summer season as the manager of the collegiate summer team the Burlington Sock Puppets.

==Music career==
During his baseball career, McDowell played guitar in various groups in the alternative rock genre, usually performing during the off-season.

McDowell&#x27;s first band, V.I.E.W., which consisted of him and fellow baseball players Lee Plemel and Wayne Edwards, had two albums, &quot;Extendagenda&quot; and &quot;Replace the Mind&quot;. The band was formed in 1989 and disbanded in 1992. Their most notable accomplishment was touring with The Smithereens in 1992.

His second band, stickfigure, consisted of McDowell, Michael Hamilton, Mike Mesaros and Frank Funaro. They produced the albums &quot;Just a Thought&quot;, &quot;Feedbag&quot;, &quot;Ape of the Kings&quot; and &quot;Memonto Mori&quot;, before the group disbanded in 2003.
In November 1993, McDowell and Pearl Jam vocalist Eddie Vedder were involved in a barroom brawl in New Orleans, Louisiana that resulted in Vedder being arrested for public drunkenness and disturbing the peace.

==In popular culture==
In 2008, musicians Scott McCaughey (of The Minus 5), Steve Wynn, Linda Pitmon, and Peter Buck formed The Baseball Project to pay homage to America&#x27;s greatest pastime. Their album &quot;Volume 1: Frozen Ropes and Dying Quails&quot; contains the song &quot;The Yankee Flipper&quot;, a tribute to their friend McDowell and a confession that a long night of drinking with the musicians may have led to the infamous finger to the crowd.

<text>Chearsley is a village and civil parish within the Buckinghamshire district in the ceremonial county of Buckinghamshire, England. It is situated about seven miles south west of Aylesbury, and about four miles north of Thame, in Oxfordshire.

==History==
The village was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Cerdeslai&quot;. It was originally a hamlet in the nearby parish of Crendon. It was established as a parish in its own right by the Bishop of Lincoln in 1458.

==Etymology==
The village name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means &#x27;Cerdic&#x27;s clearing&#x27; or &#x27;Cerdic&#x27;s lea&#x27;.

===Elite personal names===
The incidence of Brittonic personal names in the royal genealogies of a number of &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; dynasties is significant. The Wessex royal line was traditionally founded by a man named Cerdic, an undoubtedly Brittonic name ultimately derived from Caratacus. This may indicate that Cerdic was a native Briton, and that his dynasty became anglicised over time.

==Notability==
The village was used as a location in the television series Midsomer Murders – ep. Country Matters, ITV.

<text>Louis Henry Saban (October 13, 1921 – March 29, 2009) was an American football player and coach. He played for Indiana University in college and as a professional for the Cleveland Browns of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) between 1946 and 1949. Saban then began a long coaching career. After numerous jobs at the college level, he became the first coach of the Boston Patriots in the American Football League (AFL) in 1960. He joined the Buffalo Bills two years later, and led the team to consecutive AFL championships in 1964 and 1965. Saban was the first head coach to win multiple AFL championships, with only Hank Stram passing him. After serving briefly as head coach at the University of Maryland, he was hired as head coach of the Denver Broncos in 1967, where he remained for five years. Saban returned to the Bills—by then in the National Football League (NFL) following the AFL–NFL merger—from 1972 to 1976, reaching the playoffs once but failing to bring Buffalo another championship.

Following his departure from Buffalo, Saban returned to college coaching. He coached teams including the University of Miami, Army, University of Central Florida and Peru State College. He also coached at the high school level and for two Arena Football League teams. Saban switched jobs frequently and developed a reputation as an itinerant. At Central Florida, he was nicknamed Lou &quot;two point two&quot; Saban because he typically stayed in a coaching job for about 2.2 years. Saban initially dismissed this characterization, but came to accept it later in life. He held 21 coaching jobs during his 50-year career (lasting an average of 2.38 years for each job), which ended with a job at Chowan University in North Carolina between 2001 and 2002. Saban&#x27;s combined record as a coach in the AFL and NFL was 95–99–7. His college football record was 94–99–4. Saban suffered from heart problems and had a fall in his home that required hospitalization in 2009. He died in March of that year.

==Playing career==
===High school and college===
Saban was the son of immigrants from Croatia and grew up near La Grange, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. His first job, at age nine, was as a caddy for Al Capone&#x27;s brother Ralph at a Chicago golf course. He was the brother of John Saban. He attended Lyons Township High School and joined the school&#x27;s football team. A runner and passer, he led his high school&#x27;s athletic conference in scoring as a senior and was named an all-state and all-conference halfback.

Saban&#x27;s high school coach was an Indiana University alumnus and convinced him to enroll there. Saban played for the Indiana Hoosiers football team starting in 1940. He was used as a quarterback in 1941, his sophomore year. He also played as a linebacker and a placekicker. Saban was named to the Associated Press All-Big Ten second team as a quarterback in 1942. He was the captain of Indiana&#x27;s 1942 team and was selected as its most valuable player. Saban was also a standout shot putter, winning a Big Ten Conference competition at Illinois Institute of Technology in 1943 with a throw of 48 feet and 11 1/2 inches.

Later in 1943, Saban joined the U.S. Army as World War II intensified following the attack on Pearl Harbor. In 1944, he was selected to compete in the College All-Star Game, a now-defunct annual contest between the National Football League champion and a selection of the best college players from around the country. Saban, then stationed at Fort Benning in Georgia, was named the college team&#x27;s second Most Valuable Player after quarterback Glenn Dobbs of the University of Tulsa. He kicked three extra points and played on the defensive line in the all-stars&#x27; 24–21 loss to the Chicago Bears. Saban played for Fort Benning&#x27;s 1944 Third Infantry Cockades football team, while stationed there. He also studied Chinese for five months at the University of California and served in China and India as an Army interpreter.

===Cleveland Browns===
Saban was selected in the 10th round of the 1944 NFL draft by Card-Pitt, a temporary merger between the Chicago Cardinals and Pittsburgh Steelers made necessary after the teams were gutted by players&#x27; military service. Saban, however, did not sign with Card-Pitt, and instead joined the Cleveland Browns, a team under formation in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and coached by Paul Brown. Brown said Saban would be used exclusively on defense as a linebacker and as a kicker of extra points. Saban was one of the first arrivals at the Browns&#x27; training camp in Bowling Green, Ohio, having left China just three weeks before.

Despite Brown&#x27;s intentions, Saban was used occasionally on the Browns&#x27; offense in 1946. He caught a 44-yard pass from quarterback Otto Graham in a September game against the Buffalo Bisons. He was mainly used as a linebacker, however, and had four interceptions as the Browns won the first AAFC championship. In the offseason, he worked for Browns owner Mickey McBride&#x27;s Yellow Cab Company; many of his teammates spent the offseason either at college making up for time lost to the war or taking jobs to supplement their football incomes.

Saban was named the Browns&#x27; captain in 1946 after Jim Daniell, the first team captain, was arrested in a scuffle with Cleveland police and was kicked off the team at the end of the season. The following year, he filled in to kick extra points when the team&#x27;s regular placekicker, Lou Groza, was injured. The Browns amassed a 12–1–1 regular-season record in 1947 and won the AAFC championship for the second time in a row.

Never having finished his degree at Indiana, Saban enrolled that summer at Baldwin Wallace University in Berea, Ohio. After the 1948 season, in which Cleveland won all of its games and a third championship, Saban was named to two news outlets&#x27; all-AAFC teams. Saban came into his own as a linebacker in 1948. &quot;Saban has been regarded as the best in football at his position for two years&quot;, Brown said in November. &quot;If anything, he&#x27;s even better this year. He has improved on covering pass receivers.&quot; He was a unanimous all-AAFC selection in 1949, when the Browns won their fourth AAFC championship in a row. Saban announced his retirement before the championship game and said in December that he was seeking the head coaching job at the Case Institute of Technology in Cleveland before its merger with the Western Reserve University forming the Case Western Reserve University.

==Coaching career==
===College===
Saban beat more than 50 applicants to win the head coaching job at Case in February 1950, thanks to what the university&#x27;s president called his &quot;unusually sound knowledge of football&quot; and his &quot;leadership qualities&quot;. Saban &quot;possesses the sort of personality and character that is of great value in work with young men&quot;, the president said. Saban was 28 years old at the time, and the appointment made him one of the youngest college head coaches in the country. Saban borrowed coaching techniques from Brown, alongside his version of the T formation offense.

Saban&#x27;s team finished the 1950 season with four wins and four losses. By 1951, he was already under consideration for coaching jobs at bigger schools, including Indiana University and Toledo University, where he was mentioned as a &quot;dark horse&quot; candidate to replace former Browns teammate Don Greenwood. His Case teams compiled a 10–14–1 record during his tenure as head coach from 1950 to 1952. Saban resigned in March 1953 to become an assistant at the University of Washington under head coach John Cherberg. He spent just one year at Washington before getting a job as an assistant coach at Northwestern University, saying he wanted to return to the Midwest.

In February 1955, Saban was promoted to head coach at Northwestern, succeeding Bob Voigts and becoming the youngest coach in the Big Ten Conference at 33 years old. Saban hired George Steinbrenner as one of his assistant coaches. Saban&#x27;s tenure as coach of the Northwestern Wildcats football team, however, was brief and unsuccessful. Hampered by injuries, the team lost all of its games in 1955, and calls intensified for Saban&#x27;s firing as the season wore on. In December, Saban and his entire staff were fired by new athletic director Stu Holcomb. Ara Parseghian was named as his replacement.

Saban moved on to a job as head coach at Western Illinois University in 1957, where he quickly built up a successful team. The Western Illinois Leathernecks finished with a record of 6–1–1 in 1958, followed by an undefeated 9–0 season in 1959, when Saban also served as an assistant under Otto Graham in the College All-Star Game. Having built up a 20–5–1 record over three seasons as coach, Saban drew interest from the professional ranks, and the Boston Patriots of the newly formed American Football League (AFL) hired him as head coach before the circuit&#x27;s inaugural season in 1960.

===Professional===
Led by quarterback Butch Songin, Saban&#x27;s Patriots posted a 5–9 record in their first season. The following April, Saban brought in quarterback Babe Parilli, who formerly played for the Browns and Green Bay Packers, as a backup in the AFL&#x27;s biggest-ever trade at the time. Five games into the 1961 season, however, with the Patriots at 2–3, Saban was fired and replaced by assistant Mike Holovak. Patriots owner Billy Sullivan said the decision was made by a majority vote of the team&#x27;s board of directors, who &quot;just simply felt all the talent on our team had not been used and felt Mike was the man who would be able to use the talent we had to the extent that it is capable of performing.&quot;

In January 1962, Saban was named the coach of the Buffalo Bills, another AFL team, signing a one-year contract worth $20,000 ($ in dollars). The Bills had a 7–6–1 record in Saban&#x27;s first season and came in third in the AFL&#x27;s eastern division behind the Houston Oilers and the Patriots. Cookie Gilchrist, a running back who signed with the Bills after nine years in the Canadian Football League, won most valuable player honors that year and recorded the AFL&#x27;s first 1,000-yard rushing season. Saban also acquired Jack Kemp, a quarterback, from the San Diego Chargers, who had put him out on waivers while he recovered from a finger injury. Sportswriter Randy Schultz called it one of the biggest bargains in professional football history.

The Bills posted a 7–6–1 record again in 1963, but this time it was enough to tie with the Patriots for the best record in the eastern division. This set up the AFL&#x27;s first-ever playoff game to decide which of the teams would win the division and compete in the championship. The Bills lost the game, 26–8.

Helped by Gilchrist&#x27;s running and quarterback Kemp&#x27;s passing, the Bills finished the 1964 season with a 12–2 record and won the AFL championship. The team won despite drama involving Gilchrist, who came into conflict with Saban frequently and asked to be traded on numerous occasions. The Bills released him on waivers in November 1964, but canceled the move when Gilchrist apologized. After the 1964 AFL championship win over the Chargers, Saban was named the league&#x27;s coach of the year.

Gilchrist was traded to the Denver Broncos in February 1965, but the Bills continued to win, ending with a 10–3–1 record and winning the AFL championship for the second year in a row. In the 1965 AFL championship game against the Chargers, when offensive linemen Billy Shaw and Dave Behrman were injured, Saban inserted veteran Ernie Warlick opposite rookie Paul Costa in a double tight end formation, which helped the Bills win the game, 23–0. Saban was named coach of the year for the second time in a row, silencing critics who had said he was indecisive, did not use his players properly and was not a good play-caller. On January 2, 1966, Saban unexpectedly departed from the Bills for the University of Maryland. He said he was leaving because &quot;there can be little left to conquer in professional football&quot;. Saban later stated that a variety of factors all came to play in deciding to leave, ranging from his satisfaction in having two great years to believing the Maryland job would be best for his family over the grind of pro football. His record at Buffalo was 36–17–3.

Saban, however, only stayed at Maryland for one season in which the team posted a 4–6 record. He returned to professional football as coach of the AFL&#x27;s Denver Broncos in December 1966, signing a 10-year contract with an annual salary of $50,000 ($ in dollars). When he joined, the Broncos had yet to have a winning season in seven years of existence. He replaced Ray Malavasi, an assistant who took over after Saban&#x27;s former Browns teammate, Mac Speedie, resigned from the post after the first two games of the season.

Saban engineered a number of trades before the 1967 season. He brought Gilchrist to the team from Miami in a seven-player deal; Denver had sent Gilchrist to Miami the previous season. He also acquired quarterback Steve Tensi from the Chargers in August for first-round draft picks in 1968 and 1969. Denver won its first game, but proceeded to lose nine in a row and finish with a 3–11 record. The team improved only marginally in the ensuing years, posting losing records in 1968 and 1969. The AFL and National Football League completed their merger in 1970, but the Broncos continued to lose, posting a 5–8–1 record. Saban resigned after the Broncos got off to a 2–6–1 start in 1971. He said resigning was &quot;my responsibility to the team&quot; and what while the club made progress, &quot;my only regret is that we have not been able to give Denver a championship&quot;. Saban&#x27;s record as Denver&#x27;s coach was 20–42–3. Although he was not successful in Denver, he was cited by team owner Gerald Phipps as bringing in the &quot;basic organization that we have now--administrative, scouting, coaching, the whole thing.&quot; Saban became well known for his intensity and occasional temper tantrums. A much-watched clip of him bemoaning to Denver line coach Whitey Dovell that &quot;They&#x27;re killin&#x27; me out there, Whitey, they&#x27;re killin&#x27; me!&quot; introduced Saban to a wider audience when it was aired by NFL Films.

Saban was named head coach of the Bills for a second time in late 1971. When he arrived, Buffalo was coming off a 1–13 season, although the team had players including running back O. J. Simpson, who had run for 742 yards and five touchdowns that year. While the Bills had a 4–9–1 record, Simpson led the NFL in rushing yards in 1972. Under Saban, Simpson continued to improve in 1973, setting a single-game rushing record with 250 yards in the season opener against the New England Patriots. He surpassed the single-season rushing record later in the year with more than 2,000 yards. Before Saban&#x27;s arrival, Simpson had never rushed for more than 742 yards in a season. Simpson credited Saban with helping him reach his potential. &quot;He saved my career&quot;, Simpson said in 1973, when he was named the NFL&#x27;s most valuable player. &quot;He promised me he&#x27;d give me the football and give me an offensive line, and he sure kept his word.&quot; The Bills had a 9–5 record that year but came in second in the AFC East and missed the playoffs.

Buffalo finished the 1974 season with another 9–5 record and made the playoffs as the AFC&#x27;s wildcard team. The Bills, however, lost their first playoff game against the Pittsburgh Steelers and were eliminated. Saban said after the game that the Steelers&#x27; offensive domination was the deciding factor. &quot;I&#x27;m not sure how they did what they did against us, but they blew us out&quot;, he said. Buffalo went on to an 8–6 season in 1975, failing to make the playoffs. After the Bills got out to a 2–3 start in 1976, Saban resigned. He was reportedly angry about how Bills owner Ralph Wilson handled the re-signing of Simpson, who had demanded a trade at the beginning of the season. Saban was replaced by Jim Ringo, who he had hired as an assistant in 1972. Wilson held a grudge against Saban for the rest of his life after his second resignation, refusing to put Saban on the Bills&#x27; Wall of Fame because, in Wilson&#x27;s words, &quot;he quit on me twice!&quot; Walt Patulski, the Bills&#x27; first overall draft pick in 1972, also held ill will toward Saban after Buffalo, believing that Saban tried to force his personality onto Patulski and that the effort effectively ruined his career; Patulski would never speak to Saban again after their respective times in Buffalo, despite multiple opportunities to do so.

===Return to college ranks===
Following his resignation from the Bills, Saban took a post as athletic director at the University of Cincinnati in November 1976. He resigned 19 days later, however, and took a job as the head coach at the University of Miami, reportedly for a $375,000 salary ($ today). He had double-bypass heart surgery at the Cleveland Clinic in the summer of 1977, but recovered by the time Miami&#x27;s season began later that year. When Saban came to Miami, the football team had won just five games in the previous two seasons.

Miami posted a 3–8 record in Saban&#x27;s first year, but improved to 6–5 in 1978. Saban instituted an extensive recruiting network to rebuild Miami&#x27;s program, and was named the school&#x27;s athletic director in early 1978. One of his recruits was quarterback Jim Kelly, who starred at Miami and went on to a Pro Football Hall of Fame career with the Bills.

Despite Miami&#x27;s improvement in 1978, Saban departed the school amid controversy. That April, three freshman Miami players attacked a 22-year-old Jewish man wearing a yarmulke who was walking to religious services on campus. They threw the man, who worked at a campus gathering place for UM&#x27;s Jewish community, into Lake Osceola at the center of campus. When Saban returned to campus a few days later, he was unaware the man was Jewish and reportedly said &quot;Getting thrown in the lake? Sounds like fun to me.&quot; Miami&#x27;s Jewish community complained, and despite numerous apologies, Saban offered to resign mid-season. Saban was convinced to remain through the end of the season, however, before leaving to coach at Army.

By the time Saban joined Army, he had developed a reputation as an itinerant coach, a &quot;notorious job-hopper&quot; who was nevertheless respected for rebuilding teams in poor condition. Saban said he wanted to stay at Army &quot;until they put me out to pasture&quot;. Saban stayed at Army for only one season. He said he was unhappy with the academy&#x27;s unwillingness to invest more in its football program. &quot;This is a desperate situation&quot;, he said near the end of the 1979 season. &quot;To fight alone as a football staff is impossible.&quot; He resigned in July 1980 after leading Army to a 2–8–1 record the previous season.

Saban next worked for George Steinbrenner, first in 1980 as an executive at Steinbrenner&#x27;s Tampa Bay Downs racetrack and the following year as president of the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball. He took the post as a favor to Steinbrenner, a close friend who had served on his coaching staff at Northwestern in 1955.

At the end of 1982, Saban left the Yankees to take a job as head football coach at the University of Central Florida (UCF), a Division II school that aspired to move its program to the top of the college ranks. He took over a team that had gone 0–10 in 1982 and led the Knights to a 5–6 record in 1983. He resigned midway through the 1984 season with UCF&#x27;s record at 1–6. Saban, by then 63 years old, said he had a meeting with school officials and felt he &quot;had no part in their plans for the future&quot;. At UCF, Saban was playfully referred to as Lou &quot;two point two&quot; Saban because his average tenure as a coach was 2.2 years. He was replaced by his assistant, Jerry Anderson.

Saban retired in 1985 to Hendersonville, North Carolina. He came out of retirement in 1986, however, to coach high school football in Stuart, Florida, serving as the defensive coordinator for the Martin County High School Fighting Tigers. He left after two seasons and was appointed head football coach at South Fork High School, a rival of Martin County that had a record of 1–9 the previous year. After just one season at South Fork, Saban resigned in March 1989 to take a job as head coach at Georgetown High School in Georgetown, South Carolina. Saban said he was there to have fun and enjoy life, and that his reputation as a coaching &quot;nomad&quot; bothered him. &quot;I&#x27;ve had no chance but to continue on&quot;, he said.

Saban was hired in 1990 to coach the Middle Georgia Heat Wave, a semipro team in Macon, Georgia, but he left after just four games. Team officials said it was &quot;not a firing&quot;, while Saban said there were differences in philosophy and it was &quot;not a resignation.&quot; Saban next took a job in 1991 as head coach at Peru State College in Nebraska, compiling a 7–4 record. He resigned in January 1992 because of a new rule that required him to teach at the school, a responsibility he did not want to take on.

Saban next signed on as an assistant with the Tampa Bay Storm of the Arena Football League. Two years later, he was named as the coach of the arena league&#x27;s expansion Milwaukee Mustangs but was fired after the team started 0–4. The team&#x27;s general manager said he wanted to be competitive and thought the club &quot;needed a change&quot;. Shortly after his firing, Saban signed on to help start a football program at Alfred State College, a two-year technology school southeast of Buffalo. In 1995, Saban was named the first head football coach at SUNY Canton, a two-year college where he stayed for six seasons. His Canton team was an immediate success, posting a 7–0 record in 1995 and a 34–16 overall record during Saban&#x27;s time as coach. The school named its football field after Saban in the late 1990s.

Saban&#x27;s final job, which he took at 80 years old, was as head coach at Chowan University in Murfreesboro, North Carolina. He compiled a 2–13 record at Chowan between 2001 and 2002.

==Personal life==
In his later years, Saban had heart problems and a fall in his home that required hospitalization. He died at his home in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, on March 29, 2009. He was married to his first wife, Lorraine, and had a son, Thomas, and 3 daughters, Patricia, Barbara, and Christine. Lorraine committed suicide at their home in Orchard Park, New York, in the summer of 1977 while readying to join Lou at his new job in Miami. He shared seven children with his second wife, Joyce but they did not have any children together.

Lou Saban shares his last name with another famous football coach, Nick Saban. They were called &quot;distant cousins&quot; in a 2005 article where Lou comments on the younger Saban&#x27;s success. Upon the death of Lou Saban, his widow, Joyce Saban, said the two men might have been second cousins. Lou Saban stated he is a cousin of Nick Saban. Like Lou Saban, Nick Saban is of Croatian descent.

==Legacy==
Including his stops at both two- and four-year schools, Saban&#x27;s overall collegiate coaching record was 94–99–4. Including playoffs, his professional football record stands at 97–101–7. Saban had periods of success as a player and as a coach at the college and professional levels, but his constant moves from job to job eventually came to define him. &quot;I have been known as a peripatetic coach&quot;, he said in 1994. &quot;The first time I was called that, I thought it was a dirty word. I looked it up in the dictionary and found it meant I moved around a lot.&quot; Saban was inducted into the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame in 1994 and, in a surprise move, was added to the Buffalo Bills Wall of Fame in 2015, which occurred after Ralph Wilson&#x27;s death in 2014 and his estate selling the team to current owner Terry Pegula. In 2011, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Saban to the PRFA Hall of Very Good Class of 2011.

<text>John Davis ( – 29 December 1605) was one of the chief navigators of Queen Elizabeth I of England. He led several voyages to discover the Northwest Passage and served as pilot and captain on both Dutch and English voyages to the East Indies. He discovered the Falkland Islands in August 1592.

==Life and career==
Davis was born in the parish of Stoke Gabriel in Devon circa 1550, and spent his childhood in Sandridge Barton nearby. It has been suggested that he learned much of his seamanship as a child while playing boats along the river Dart, and went to sea at an early age. His childhood neighbours included Adrian Gilbert and Humphrey Gilbert and their half-brother Walter Raleigh. From early on, he also became friends with John Dee.

 He began pitching a voyage in search of the Northwest Passage to the queen&#x27;s secretary Francis Walsingham in 1583. Two years later, in 1585, the secretary relented and funded the expedition, which traced Frobisher&#x27;s route to Greenland&#x27;s east coast, around Cape Farewell, and west towards Baffin Island. In 1586 he returned to the Arctic with four ships, two of which were sent to Greenland&#x27;s iceberg-calving eastern shore; the other two penetrated the strait which came to bear his name as far as 67°N before being blocked by the Arctic ice cap. &quot;Sunshine&quot; attempted (and failed) to circumnavigate the island from the east. The initially amiable approach Davis adopted to the Inuit bringing musicians and having the crew dance and play with them changed after they stole one of his anchors; they were likely irate at having been interrupted during one of their religious ceremonies. Inuit also attacked his ships in Hamilton Inlet (Labrador). A third expedition in 1587 reached 72°12&#x27;N and Disko Island before unfavorable winds forced it back. On his return, Davis charted Davis Inlet on the coast of Labrador. The log of this trip remained a textbook model for later captains for centuries.

In 1588 he seems to have commanded &quot;Black Dog&quot; against the Spanish Armada. In 1589 he joined the Earl of Cumberland as part of the Azores Voyage of 1589. In 1591 he accompanied Thomas Cavendish on Cavendish&#x27;s last voyage, which sought to discover the Northwest Passage &quot;upon the back parts of America&quot; (i.e., from the western entrance). After the rest of Cavendish&#x27;s expedition returned unsuccessful, Davis continued to attempt on his own account the passage of the Strait of Magellan; though defeated by foul weather, he apparently discovered the Falkland Islands in August 1592 aboard &quot;Desire&quot;. His crew was forced to kill hundreds of penguins for food on the islands, but the stored meat spoiled in the tropics and only fourteen of his 76 men made it home alive.

From 1596 to 1597 Davis seems to have sailed with Sir Walter Raleigh to Cádiz and the Azores as master of Raleigh&#x27;s ship; from 1598 to 1600 he accompanied a Dutch expedition to the East Indies as pilot, sailing from flushing and returning to Middleburg, while carefully charting and recording geographical details. He narrowly escaped destruction from treachery at Achin on Sumatra.

From 1601 to 1603 he accompanied Sir James Lancaster as Pilot-Major on the first voyage of the English East India Company. For his part Davis was to receive £500 (around £1.5 million at 2015 values) if the voyage doubled its original investment, £1,000 if three times, £1,500 if four times and £2,000 if five times.

Before departure, Davis had told London merchants that pepper could be obtained in Aceh at a price of four reals of eight per hundredweight - whereas it actually cost 20. When the voyage returned, Lancaster complained that Davis had been wrong about both the price and availability of pepper. Unhappy at being made a scapegoat for the situation, on 5 December 1604 Davis sailed again for the East Indies as pilot to Sir Edward Michelborne, an &quot;interloper&quot; who had been granted a charter by James I despite the supposed East India Company monopoly on trade with the East. On this journey he was killed off Bintan Island near Singapore by one of his captive &quot;Japanese&quot; pirates whose disabled vessel he had just seized. The pirates had taken the English in through several days of friendly discourse prior to the surprise attack in which the subject was &#x27;dragged back, hacked and slashed, and thrust out again&#x27;. He died almost immediately after the attack.

In the centuries after his death, the importance of Dutch whalers actually led the settlements along Greenland&#x27;s western coast to be called &quot;Straat Davis&quot; after their name for the Strait, while the name &quot;Greenland&quot; was used to refer to the eastern shore, erroneously presumed to be the site of the Norse Eastern Settlement.

==Publications==
Davis&#x27;s explorations in the Arctic were published by Richard Hakluyt and appeared on his world map. Davis himself published a valuable treatise on practical navigation called &quot;The Seaman&#x27;s Secrets&quot; in 1594 and a more theoretical work called &quot;The World&#x27;s Hydrographical Description&quot; in 1595. The account of Davis&#x27;s last voyage was written by Michelborne on his return to England in 1606.

==Inventions==

His invention of the backstaff and double quadrant (called the Davis quadrant after him) remained popular among English seamen until long after Hadley&#x27;s reflecting quadrant had been introduced.

==Personal life==

On 29 September 1582, Davis married Mistress Faith Fulford, daughter of Sir John Fulford (the High Sheriff of Devon) and Dorothy Bourchier, the daughter of the Earl of Bath. They had four sons and a daughter. On his return from the 1592 voyage, Davis discovered his wife had taken up with a &quot;sleek paramour&quot;; conspiring with this man, a counterfeiter, Faith &quot;brought false and unavailing charges&quot; against Davis.

Davis was also involved a plot to entrap Thomas Aufield, a Catholic priest. Likely acting as an &quot;agent provocateur&quot; at the direction of his patron, Francis Walsingham, Davis claimed to be a Catholic convert and offered to hand over a number of English ships to the Pope or to Spain to aid the Catholic cause. He met Aufield in Rouen to discuss the proposal. Negotiations failed and he returned to England where Aufield was arrested for circulating Catholic texts. Aufield was tortured and found guilty distributing a book in which found fault with the queen&#x27;s religion. He was hanged on 6 July 1585 at Tyburn.
