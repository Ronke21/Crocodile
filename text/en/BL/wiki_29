<text>James Gadsden (May 15, 1788December 26, 1858) was an American diplomat, soldier and businessman after whom the Gadsden Purchase is named, pertaining to land which the United States bought from Mexico, and which became the southern portions of Arizona and New Mexico. James Gadsden served as Adjutant General of the U.S. Army from August 13, 1821 – March 22, 1822. Between 1853 and 1856, he served as U.S. Minister to Mexico. He was known commonly as General Gadsden, although he never had a rank above colonel.

==Biography==
Little is known about the life of Gadsden, especially his early life. It is known that he was born in Charleston, South Carolina, during 1788, and that he was grandson of the American Revolutionary War hero Christopher Gadsden, for whom the Gadsden flag was named. It is also known that Gadsden earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Yale University in Connecticut, completing this degree in 1806. In university, he was a member of the debating and secret society, Brothers in Unity. One of his siblings, John Gadsden, served two terms as the Mayor of Charleston, and another sibling, Christopher Edwards Gadsden, was the fourth Episcopal Bishop of South Carolina.

===Army service===
Gadsden joined the U.S. Army in December 1812. He served as a commissioned officer commanded by General Andrew Jackson, who was later elected president in 1828. Gadsden served Gen. Jackson both during the War of 1812 against the British Army, and, from 1816 to 1821, in protecting the southern U.S. border from raiders — Native Americans, maroons (escaped slaves and their descendants) — based in Spanish Florida. As part of this effort, Jackson directed Gadsden, a member of the Army Corps of Engineers, to build a fort on the Prospect Bluff site. Jackson subsequently named it Fort Gadsden. Gadsden also helped to establish Fort Brooke with George Mercer Brooke at the site of the present-day city of Tampa, Florida. He was appointed Adjutant General in August 1821, but this appointment was not confirmed by the Senate, causing it to expire the following year.

===Seminole expulsion===
Gadsden next decided to quit the U.S. Army, and became a planter in Florida; he served in the Florida Territorial Legislature. Gadsden was appointed as a commissioner during 1823 to help with the organization and the expulsion of most of the Seminole Indian Tribe from their homes in Florida and southern Georgia, along the Trail of Tears to land reservations that had been reserved for them in what is now Oklahoma.

Years later Gadsden County, Florida, was named in his honor, and also the city of Gadsden, Alabama, and the town of Gadsden, Arizona.

===Railroad executive===
Later, Gadsden served as the president of the South Carolina Railroad company from 1840 to 1850. When first completed in 1833, the line was the longest railroad in the world under one management. As an engineer he directed the construction of the branch to Columbia, completed 1842, surveyed a proposed extension to the Ohio River, and helped promote the Memphis &amp; Charleston Railroad, incorporated 1845 (completed in 1857, it was the first U.S. railroad link between the Atlantic and the Mississippi River, but long after Gadsden had turned his attention elsewhere).

By 1846, Gadsden and his associates promoted the construction of a southern transcontinental railroad from the Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans. He urged Georgia and South Carolina to abandon their rivalry and to &quot;discover their true policy in the harmony of a free and unrestricted trade.&quot; A late 1840s map shows this railroad would hypothetically have been by way of the southern route from Charleston through Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas to El Paso, Texas, and then through Mexico to the coast, in what in a few years would be newly acquired American land, after the 1846–1848 war with Mexico. In 1852, the SCRR followed the philosophy laid out by Gadsden during his tenure and moved the railroad&#x27;s terminus from Hamburg, South Carolina, signaling the end of South Carolina&#x27;s focus on economic sovereignty.

Much of the boundary between the United States and Mexico had been left unreasonably vague by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that had been signed and ratified by the United States and Mexico during 1848. Gadsden would play an important role in revising the boundary, with the aim to build a southern transcontinental railroad (see below and the article on the Gadsden Purchase).

===California===
During 1850, Gadsden advocated secession by South Carolina when California was admitted to the Union as a free state. Gadsden considered slavery &quot;a social blessing&quot; and abolitionists &quot;the greatest curse of the nation.&quot;

When the secession proposal failed, Gadsden, working with his cousin Isaac Edward Holmes, a lawyer in San Francisco since 1851, and the California state senator Thomas Jefferson Green, attempted to divide California in two. They proposed that the southern half would allow slavery. Gadsden planned to establish a slaveholding colony there based on rice, cotton, and sugar. He would use slave labor to build a railroad and highway, originating in either San Antonio or on the Red River, that would transport people to the California gold fields. Toward this end, on December 31, 1851, Gadsden asked Green to secure from the California state legislature a large land grant located between the 34th and 36th parallels; it would eventually serve as the dividing line for the two California states.

A few months after this, Gadsden and 1,200 potential settlers from South Carolina and Florida submitted a petition to the California legislature for permanent citizenship and permission to establish a rural district that would be farmed by &quot;not less than Two Thousand of their African Domestics&quot;. The petition stimulated some debate, but it finally expired in committee.

===Gadsden Purchase===

Following the war between Mexico and the United States, disputes over the boundary line brought the two nations near to renewed conflict in the Mesilla Valley of New Mexico, north of El Paso. In May 1853, President Franklin Pierce appointed Gadsden as the Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Mexico, with instructions to purchase more land from Mexico as part of a settlement of the Mesilla controversy, for the prospective railroad route across southernmost parts of what are today New Mexico and Arizona, to end the possibility of disputes concerning control of the Apache along the border, and other more minor issues.

Gadsden successfully performed this mission by negotiating with the Mexican government in Mexico City for the purchase of more land from Mexico for southmost New Mexico and Arizona, and by establishing the boundary between the United States and Mexico as two long line segments between the Rio Grande at the westmost tip of Texas all the way to the River Colorado at the eastern boundary of California. This treaty is known as the &quot;Gadsden Treaty&quot;, and it resulted in the Gadsden Purchase from Mexico of about of land in northmost Mexico for $10,000,000.

In the fall of 1856 Gadsden retired as minister to Mexico, and returned to Charleston where he died in 1858. The sectional crisis of the late 1850s and subsequent Civil War delayed construction of a proposed southern transcontinental railroad to California along the 32d parallel, just to the north of the Mexican border. Between 1878 and 1881, though, the Southern Pacific Railroad (now part of the Union Pacific Railroad) built the section of the southern transcontinental between Yuma and El Paso within the Gadsden Purchase territory. At the same time, 1880–1882, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad completed a transcontinental link through the Gadsden Purchase and then southwest to a terminus at the port of Guaymas, in the state of Sonora, Mexico. Completed October 25, 1882, this line was later acquired by the Southern Pacific. Today, the rail link across the Gadsden Purchase on the southern transcontinental is one of the busiest in the Western Hemisphere.

The land bought by the Gadsden Purchase contained the site of Arizona&#x27;s second largest city, Tucson, a one-time Spanish presidio town, the minor cities and towns of Casa Grande, and Yuma, Arizona, Lordsburg, Deming, New Mexico, and New Mexico&#x27;s second largest metro area at Las Cruces, New Mexico, in the Mesilla Valley, and it defined the status of the area north of the Gila River, that later became the metropolitan area of Phoenix, Scottsdale, Mesa, Glendale, and Tempe, Arizona. Most of the land south of Phoenix where tentative plans had been made to build a transcontinental railroad is desert land that is not suitable for much human inhabitation. Nearly all of this federally owned land was eventually reserved as a large, sparsely inhabited American Indian reservation, testing and combat-practice ranges for the U.S. Air Force, Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, Coronado National Forest, Sonoran Desert National Monument, Ironwood Forest National Monument, Saguaro National Park, and the Fort Huachuca Military Reservation of the U.S. Army.

<text>Hans Karl Friedrich Anton Graf von Diebitsch und Narten (; 13 May 1785 – 10 June 1831) was a German-born soldier serving as Russian field marshal.

== Career ==
Hans Karl was educated at the Berlin cadet school, but by the desire of his father, Frederick II&#x27;s aide-de-camp who had passed into the service of Russia, he also did the same in 1801. He served in the campaign of 1805 against Napoleon and the Grand Armee, and was wounded at Austerlitz, fought at Eylau and Friedland, and after Friedland was promoted captain.

During the next five years of peace, he devoted himself to the study of military science, engaging once more in active service in the War of 1812. He distinguished himself very greatly in Wittgenstein&#x27;s campaign, and in particular at Polotsk (18 and 19 October), after which combat, he was raised to the rank of major-general. In the latter part of the campaign, he served against the Prussian contingent of General Yorck (von Wartenburg), with whom, through Clausewitz, he negotiated the celebrated convention of Tauroggen, serving thereafter with Yorck in the early part of the German Campaign of 1813.

After the battle of Lützen (1813) he served in Silesia and took part in negotiating the secret treaty of Reichenbach. Having distinguished himself at the battles of Dresden and Leipzig he was promoted lieutenant-general. At the crisis of the campaign of 1814, he strongly urged the march of the allies on Paris; and after their entry the emperor Alexander conferred on him the order of St. Alexander Nevsky.

In 1815 he attended the Congress of Vienna and was afterwards made adjutant-general to the emperor, with whom, as also with his successor Nicholas, he had great influence. By Nicholas he was created baron, and later count. In 1820 he had become chief of the general staff, and in 1825 he assisted in suppressing the Decembrist revolt.

His greatest exploits were in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829, which, after a period of doubtful contest, was decided by Diebitsch&#x27;s brilliant campaign of Adrianople; this won him the rank of field-marshal and the victory title of Zabalkansky (meaning &quot;Trans-Balkan&quot;) to commemorate his crossing of the Balkans.

In 1830 he was appointed to command the great army destined to suppress the November Uprising in Poland. After the inconclusive battle of Grochow on 25 February, he won the battle of Ostrołęka on 26 May, but soon afterwards died of cholera at Kleszewo near Pułtusk, on 10 June 1831.

<text>Renovationism (; from &#x27;renovation, renewal&#x27;)—also called the Renovated Church () or, by metonymy, the Living Church ()—officially named Orthodox Russian Church (), and later Orthodox Church in the USSR (), was the schism in the Russian Orthodox Church, sanctioned by the Soviet authorities, the movement ceased operations in the late 1940s. In 1927, the movement was blessed by the future Patriarch Sergius of Moscow, a political move that enabled the reformation of the modern Russian Orthodox Church in 1943 by Sergius (Stragorodsky).

This movement originally began as a grassroots movement among the Russian Orthodox clergy for the reformation of the Church, but was quickly influenced by the support of the Soviet secret services (Cheka, then GPU, NKVD), which had hoped to split and weaken the Russian Church by instigating schismatic movements within it. The beginning of actual schism is usually considered to be in May 1922, when a group of Renovationist clergy laid claims to higher ecclesiastical authority in the Russian Church. Three days after the establishment of the new Church, the Soviet authorities arrested Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow on May 19. Both factions were calling each other names &quot;Renovationites&quot; and &quot;Tikhonovites&quot; (). The movement is considered to have ended with the death of its leader, Alexander Vvedensky, in 1946, although the last unrepentant Renovationist hierarch, Philaret (Yatsenko), died in 1951.

While the entire movement is often known as the &quot;Living Church&quot;, this was specifically the name of just one of the groups that comprised the larger Renovationist movement. By the time of the Moscow Council of 1923, three major groups had formed within the movement, representing different tendencies within Russian Renovationism: &quot;The Living Church&quot; of Vladimir Krasnitsky lobbied for the interests of married clergy; the &quot;Union of the Communities of the Ancient Apostolic Church&quot; (Союз общин древнеапостольской церкви - Содац SODATs) of Alexander Vvedensky; and the &quot;Union for the Renewal of the Church&quot; (Союз церковного возрождения) – the group of bishop Antonin Granovsky, whose interest was in liturgical reform; along with several minor groups.

== History of the Renovationist Church ==

=== Beginnings and first period (1920s–1930s)===
In 1919–1920, the Cheka officials began actively seeking contacts with those representatives of the Orthodox clergy who, in their opinion, were suitable for the role of destroyers of the unity of the Russian Orthodox Church. The first attempts to introduce an element of disorganization into the church environment, acting through hierarchs (or former hierarchs) from the patriarch&#x27;s entourage, were not crowned with success. Therefore, the Cheka decided to act through the young white parish clergy, who are revolutionary in relation to possible intra-church transformations, leading the case to eventually quarrel between &quot;the priests and the episcopate&quot;, married (&quot;white&quot;) and monastic (&quot;black&quot;) clergy. The special VI branch of the GPU became the coordinating center of all efforts to split the Church through the GPU (OGPU since 15 November 1923) headed by Yevgeny Tuchkov. The general management of the process of the split of the Church was concentrated (although not immediately) in the hands of the Politburo of the Central Committee (personally responsible – Leon Trotsky). By the spring of 1922, the necessary organizational preparations for striking the Church were completed. The right moment to start was needed.

Such an opportune moment soon presented itself on the occasion of the launch of a campaign to seize church valuables. As a special representative of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars, Leon Trotsky led the work of the Commission on Accounting and Concentration of Values. On January 23, 1922, the members of the Commission agreed that work on the removal of valuables from existing religious institutions should begin in the near future in the two or three most important regions of the country (Moscow, Petrograd, Novgorod). Among the preparatory activities included work with representatives of the Church: &quot;If necessary, individual representatives of the clergy may be involved, who, contrary to the anti-Soviet clergy, would sharply defend the government&#x27;s measures, thus introducing a split among the clergy.&quot; After the events in Shuya on March 15, 1922, where the commission for the seizure of valuables faced massive and stubborn resistance of believers, Leon Trotsky on March 17, 1922, in a letter to Lev Kamenev, Vyacheslav Molotov and Timofei Sapronov, formulated 17 theses containing detailed instructions to the party-Soviet and Chekist bodies regarding the forms and methods of expropriation of church valuables (the leadership of the campaign was henceforth in the hands of party organs). Among other things, it was proposed to &quot;decisively split the clergy&quot; by taking under the protection of state power those clergy who openly advocate the transfer of church wealth to the state.

In the same month, the so-called &quot;Petrograd Group of Progressive Clergy&quot; was formed. The first program document of the group was the declaration on famine relief dated March 24, 1922, was signed by 12 clergymen. The participants of the Petrograd group immediately became active: Alexander Vvedensky and Alexander Boyarsky made reports almost daily, urging them to give away church values. Vladimir Krasnitsky did not make reports, but he tied ties with various institutions, in particular with the Cheka, which was then located on Gorokhovaya Street, 2. It was Krasnitsky who became the main organizer among the participants of the Petrograd group. Under his leadership, which, however, was disputed by Vvedensky and Boyarsky, the Petrograd group became the center of the nascent renovationist movement.

This move was quickly (18 June 1922) denounced by Agathangel as unlawful and uncanonical. However, for a brief time it seemed that the Renovationists had gotten the upper hand. The Renovationists, with full support of Soviet authorities, seized many church buildings and monasteries, including the famous Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow. In many dioceses, the married (&quot;white&quot;) clergy was encouraged to take church government into their own hands, without approval of their diocesan bishops. Simultaneously, these bishops were often threatened and pressed to recognize the authority of the Supreme Church Administration (SCA). In effect, this resulted in &quot;parallel&quot; church administrations existing in one diocese and one city, one supporting the SCA and the other supporting the canonical bishop.

This campaign of terror had its effects: by the summer of 1922, more than 20 hierarchs had recognized the canonical authority of HCA, the most notorious of whom was Metropolitan Sergius (Stragorodsky) of Nizhny Novgorod, the future Patriarch. In many large cities, all of Orthodox church properties were in the hands of Renovationists. Before convening any general council to discuss their measures, the Renovationists began to implement radical reforms aimed at what they perceived to be the interests of the married clergy. Among the measures, changing the traditional order of ecclesiastic life were:

:* Permission for monastics (including bishops) to marry, while retaining their episcopal and clerical ranks;
:* Permission for the clergy to marry after their ordination, to remarry or to marry widows;
:* Permission for the married priests to be consecrated as bishops (Christian Orthodox tradition is that only monastics may be Bishops).

The last decision sparked a number of consecrations of &quot;married bishops&quot; throughout the country, especially in Siberia. As a result of its promulgation, of 67 bishops that arrived to the &quot;Second Moscow Council&quot; in April 1923, only 20 had been ordained before the schism. The consecration of the &quot;married bishops&quot; without waiting for a conciliar decision on changing appropriate Canons met with opposition even among many Renovationist leaders and those &quot;married bishops&quot; later received a second laying on of hands before the Council opened.
The &quot;I Renovationist&quot; (or officially &quot;&quot;II All-Russian&quot; Council&quot;) met in Moscow between 29 April and 8 May 1923. Its most controversial and infamous decision was to put Patriarch Tikhon (who was under house arrest, awaiting trial) on ecclesiastic trial &quot;in absentia&quot; for his opposition to Communism, and to strip him of his episcopacy, priesthood and monastic status. The council allowed the marriage for episcopate and second marriage for priests. Monasteries &quot;as having deviated from the pure monastic idea&quot; were ordered to be closed. The Council then resolved to abolish the Patriarchate altogether and to return to the &quot;collegial&quot; form of church government. The Supreme Church Administration was renamed to the Supreme Church Council, still under the chairmanship of Antonin (Granovsky). Patriarch Tikhon, who was visited by delegation from the council, refused to recognize the authority of this council and the validity of the &quot;court&quot; decision, due to many irregularities in canonical procedure: essentially, the decision had no effect on the life of the Patriarchal or &quot;Tikhonite&quot; Church.

On June 24, 1923, a power struggle among the factions resulted in the forced resignation of Metropolitan Antonin (Granovsky). On June 29, 1923, he declared his &quot;Union for Church Renewal&quot; autocephalous and soon reverting to his previous title of &quot;bishop&quot;, engaged in a series of radical liturgical experiments: e.g., moving the altar table to the middle of the church, among other changes. He made one of the first translations of the Divine Liturgy into modern Russian. His group disintegrated in 1929.

The telling blow against Renovationism was the return of Patriarch Tikhon to active duty in June 1923 when, under international pressure, he was released from house arrest. Already by that time, large passive resistance to the Renovationists, especially in rural areas, had undermined their efforts to &quot;take over&quot; the Russian Church. On 15 July 1923, the Patriarch declared all Renovationist decrees, as well as all their sacramental actions (including ordinations) to be without grace, due to the &quot;trickery&quot; by which they tried to seize power in the Church and to their complete disregard for the canons. In August 1923, the council of Russian Orthodox bishops, returned from exile and imprisonment, confirmed Tikhon&#x27;s decision, proclaiming the Renovationist hierarchy as &quot;unlawful and without grace&quot;. Some of the churches were returned to the &quot;Tikhonites&quot; (as Renovationists called the &quot;Patriarchal&quot; Church at that time), and many bishops and priests who had been pressed to support the schism, repented and were received back into communion.

In addition to ecclesiological experimentation, the 1920s, the Renovationist Church had some activity in the fields of education and apologetics. Particularly, in 1924 the church was allowed to open two institutions of higher learning: the Moscow Theological Academy and the Theological Institute in Leningrad. Some contacts were made with other portions of the Christian East: thus, the &quot;II Renovationist Council&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;III All-Russian Council&quot;), convened in Moscow in 1–9 October 1925, was marked by the presence of the representatives from the Patriarchates of Constantinople and Alexandria who concelebrated the eucharist with other members of the Renovationist Synod.

In the second half of the 1920s, the canonical Russian Orthodox Church started making steps toward some form of &quot;rapprochement&quot; with the Soviet regime. Significantly, in 1927, the Deputy Patriarchal &quot;Locum Tenens&quot;, Metropolitan Sergius Stragorodsky issued a &quot;Declaration&quot; proclaiming absolute loyalty of the Church to the Soviet government and its interests. Subsequently, a Synod formed by Sergius, received recognition from the Soviets. This had effectively put the Renovationist Synod out of place as the chief spokesman for the alliance between the Church and the Soviet state, and it was then that the Renovationist movement began its rapid decline.

=== Decline (1930s–1940s)===
By the mid-1930s the general failure of the movement had become evident. Having failed to attract the majority of the faithful, the movement ceased to be useful for the Soviet regime and, consequently, both the &quot;Patriarchal&quot; Church and the Renovationists suffered fierce persecution at the hands of Soviet secret services: church buildings were closed down and often destroyed; active clergy and laity were imprisoned and sometimes executed. At the same time, trying to &quot;win back&quot; more traditional Russian Orthodox, the church had abandoned all attempts at ecclesiastical or liturgical reform, with the exception of the concessions previously made to married clergy. Instead, the Renovationist Church made attempts at imitating external liturgical and organizational forms of their opponents from the &quot;Patriarchal&quot; Church.

In 1934, the Renovationist Synod issued an infamous decision declaring the &quot;allegiance to the old church&quot; (&quot;староцерковничество&quot;), i.e., the Patriarchal Church, to be a &quot;heresy&quot; and a &quot;schism&quot;. The mastermind behind that decision, Metropolitan Nikolai (Platonov) of Leningrad resigned from episcopacy in 1938, publicly denounced the faith and became an infamous propagator of atheism. The Renovationist church continued to dwindle in numbers; the process intensified starting in 1939, when the Synod forbade the diocesan bishops to do any priestly ordinations without its approval.

The final blow to the movement came with the beginning of the Second World War in 1941. The Metropolitan&#x27;s residence had to be relocated due to evacuation. Therefore, the Synod had difficulties contacting and controlling its clergy in the parishes. More importantly, in its efforts to seek moral and financial support from the Eastern Orthodox Church, Joseph Stalin decided to turn to the more popular and traditional Russian Orthodox Church led by Sergius, rather than to its largely unsuccessful rivals. On 8 September 1943, Stalin met with three chief hierarchs of the &quot;Patriarchal&quot; Church and promised to make concessions to the Church and religion in general in exchange for its allegiance and support.

One of the effects of this unlikely concordat was that the days of the Renovationist movement were numbered. What followed was a deluge of Renovationist clerics seeking reconciliation with Sergius. As a general rule, the Patriarchal Church considered all sacraments celebrated by Renovationists &quot;null and void&quot;, hence these receiving clergy were received in those orders in which they happened to be upon the moment when they joined the schism (i.e. 1922). The only exception was made for Metropolitan Alexander Vvedensky, who was regarded as the ‘father-founder’ of the schism. Vvedensky refused to come into the Moscow Patriarchy as a layman, and died unreconciled.

In 1943, the Renovationist church had 13 active hierarchs and 10 more bishops, retired or in exile. By 1945 only three bishops remained, one of whom was retired. In Moscow, only one church remained under Renovationist control; the rest of the church properties had been returned by the Soviet government to the Moscow Patriarchy while Vvedensky was in evacuation. Vvedensky died of a stroke on July 8, 1946, with his church in complete disarray. By this time, almost all the Renovationist parishes and clergy had been annexed to the Moscow Patriarchate. After that scattered and isolated communities left in the country, headed by priests, who, in case of repentance, were defrocked for canonical reasons. The last Renovationist bishops to recognize the patriarchal Church were Archbishop Gabriel (Olkhovik) (1948) and Seraphim (Korovin) (August 1, 1948) and Alexander (Shcherbakov) (April 17, 1949). The last Renovationist hierarch in the USSR was Metropolitan Philaret (Yatsenko) of Krutitsy, who considered himself the head of the Renovationist Church. He died in early 1951, leaving no successors.

== Leadership and administration ==
The central administrative body of the Renovationist Church, as well as its entire administration, was in a state of constant flux and changed names several times in the 28-year period of its existence. Initially it was called the &quot;Supreme Church Administration&quot; (&quot;Высшее церковное управление&quot;), then &quot;Supreme Church Council&quot; (1922–23). Thereafter it assumed a more traditional style: &quot;The Holy Synod of the Orthodox Church in the USSR&quot; (1923–1935). Its President was usually considered a chief hierarch of the church, regardless of the see that he occupied.

In its later years, the Renovationist administration started to lean more toward more &quot;traditionalist&quot; titles. In 1933, the position of the &quot;First Hierarch&quot; (&quot;Первоиерарх&quot;) was introduced, in opposition to the &quot;Tikhonite&quot; Church, which was not to have a Patriarch until 1943. The position was given to the then-President of Synod Vitaly Vvedensky; however, since the mid-1920s all power in the Renovationist Church had consolidated in the hands of its actual leader, Metropolitan Alexander Vvedensky. Toward the latter part of the 1930s, A. Vvedensky bore a very peculiar conglomerate of titles, invented specially for him: &quot;Metropolitan - Apologete - Evangelizer&quot; and &quot;Deputy First Hierarch&quot;. In the fall of 1941 he himself assumed the title of the First Hierarch and made an abortive attempt to declare himself a &quot;Patriarch of all Orthodox Churches in the USSR&quot;. The attempt was not received well by his fellow clergy, and in December 1941 he reverted to his previous titles.

<text>Christopher Gadsden (February 16, 1724 – August 28, 1805) was an American politician who was the principal leader of the South Carolina Patriot movement during the American Revolution. He was a delegate to the Continental Congress, a brigadier general in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina, a merchant, and the designer of the Gadsden flag. He is a signatory to the Continental Association.

==Early life==
Gadsden was born in 1724 in Charleston, South Carolina. He was the son of Thomas Gadsden (b. 1701), who had been in the Royal Navy before becoming customs collector for the Port of Charleston. His grandfather, Edward Gadsden, was born in Wiltshire, England in 1672 and emigrated to South Carolina in 1695. He was sent to school near Bristol, England. He returned to America in 1740 and served as an apprentice at a counting house in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He inherited a large fortune from his father who died in 1741. From 1745 to 1746 he was a purser on a British warship during King George&#x27;s War. He entered into mercantile ventures and by 1747 had earned enough to return to South Carolina and buy back the land his father had sold because he needed the money to pay off debts. He built Beneventum Plantation House in about 1750. 

=== Views on slavery ===
While Gadsden vehemently supported John Adams, who was opposed to slavery and promoted a gradual approach to abolition, the U.S. National Park Service writes that &quot;by 1774, Christopher Gadsden owned four stores, several merchant vessels, two rice plantations, a residential district in Charleston called Gadsdenboro, and a large wharf on the Cooper River.&quot; Of all the colonies, South Carolina received the highest number of slaves from Africa, and most of these came ashore on Gadsden&#x27;s Wharf in Charleston. Gadsden himself held slaves, as did many rice plantation owners in South Carolina who used the labor of enslaved Africans to grow and sell agricultural products. In &quot;A Forgotten Founder: The Life and Legacy of Christopher Gadsden&quot;, Kelcey Eldridge states that, &quot;at the time of his death, he owned enough slaves to &#x27;divide my Estate real and personal as well as my negroes as otherwise into nineteen equal parts or shares; but it is unknown just how many enslaved people he purchased, owned, or used.

===Seven Years&#x27; War===

Gadsden began his rise to prominence as a merchant and patriot in Charleston. He prospered as a merchant and built the wharf that bears his name. Between its completion in 1767 until 1787 and 1803 to 1808, it is estimated that 40% of all African slaves (about 100,000 enslaved people) were brought to America through his wharf. He was captain of a militia company during a 1759 expedition against the Cherokee. He was first elected to the Commons House of Assembly in 1757 and began a long friction with autocratic royal governors. His re-election to the Commons in 1762 was beset with minor voting irregularities, which resulted in Governor Boone refusing to administer the oath of office for Gadsden and dissolving the entire Commons. This perceived excess of gubernatorial power led to a political culture in South Carolina of legislative dominance over the executive branch. 

In 1766, the assembly made him one of their delegates to the Stamp Act Congress in New York City, which was called to protest the Stamp Act. While his fellow delegates Thomas Lynch and John Rutledge served on committees to draft appeals to the House of Lords and Commons respectively, Gadsden refused any such assignment, since in his view the British parliament had no rights in the matter. He was outspoken in his support of the Declaration of Rights and Grievances produced by the Congress. His addresses brought him to the attention of Samuel Adams of Massachusetts, and the two began a long correspondence and friendship. Gadsden was eventually known as &quot;the Sam Adams of the South&quot;.

==Revolutionary years==
On his return from New York, Gadsden became one of the founders and leaders of the Charleston Sons of Liberty. He had risen to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the militia. He was elected as a delegate to the First Continental Congress in 1774 and the Second Continental Congress the following year. He left Congress early in 1776 to assume command of the 1st South Carolina Regiment of the Continental Army and to serve in the Provincial Congress of South Carolina.

In February 1776, South Carolina President John Rutledge named him a brigadier general in charge of the state&#x27;s military forces. As the British prepared to attack Charleston, Major General Charles Lee ordered outlying positions abandoned. Rutledge and the local officers disagreed. A compromise was reached and as William Moultrie prepared the defenses on Sullivan&#x27;s Island, Gadsden paid for, and his regiment built, a bridge that would allow their escape if the position were threatened. The British attack was repulsed.

In 1778, Gadsden was a member of the South Carolina convention that drafted a new state constitution. That same year he was named the lieutenant governor, to replace Henry Laurens who was away at the Continental Congress. He served in that office until 1780. For the first year and a half, his office was called &quot;Vice President of South Carolina,&quot; but when the new constitution was adopted, the title was changed to the modern usage.

When the British laid siege to Charleston in 1780, John Rutledge, as president of the council, fled to North Carolina to ensure a &quot;government in exile&quot; should the city fall. Gadsden remained, along with Governor Rawlins Lowndes. General Benjamin Lincoln surrendered the Continental Army garrison on May 12 to General Henry Clinton. At the same time, Gadsden represented the civil government and surrendered the city. He was sent on parole to his Charleston house.

===Prisoner of war===
After Clinton returned to New York, the new British commander in the South, General Charles Cornwallis, changed the rules. On August 27, 1780, he arrested about 20 of the civil officers then on parole. They were marched as prisoners to a ship and taken to St. Augustine, Florida. When they arrived, Governor Patrick Tonyn offered the freedom of the town if they would give their parole. Most accepted, but Gadsden refused claiming that the British had already violated one parole, and he could not give his word to a false system. As a result, he spent the next 42 weeks in solitary confinement in a prison room at the old Spanish fortress of Castillo de San Marcos. When they were released in 1781, they were sent by merchant ship to Philadelphia. Once there, Gadsden learned of the defeat of Cornwallis&#x27; subordinate Banastre Tarleton at Cowpens and Cornwallis&#x27; subsequent movement to Yorktown. Gadsden hurried home to help the restoration of South Carolina&#x27;s civil government.

==Later life==

Gadsden was returned to South Carolina&#x27;s House of Representatives, then meeting at Jacksonboro. At this session, Governor Randolph and de facto President Rutledge both surrendered their offices. Gadsden was elected as the governor but felt he had to decline. His health was still impaired from his imprisonment, and an active governor was needed since the British had not yet given up Charleston. So in 1782, John Mathews became the new governor. Gadsden was also a member of the state convention in 1788 and voted for ratification of the United States Constitution.

In 1798, he built the imposing house at 329 East Bay Street in the Ansonborough area of Charleston that remained in the family for more than a century; famous ironworker Philip Simmons built the gates that incorporate a snake motif, drawn from the &quot;Don&#x27;t Tread on Me&quot; flag that Gadsden designed.

Gadsden was married three times and had four children with his second wife. Three of his grandsons, all brothers, were also notable:
* Christopher Edwards Gadsden, who served as the fourth Episcopal Bishop of South Carolina
* James Gadsden, for whom the Gadsden Purchase of Arizona was named
* John Gadsden, who served two terms as the Mayor of Charleston

Gadsden died from an accidental fall on August 28, 1805, in Charleston, and is buried there in St. Philip&#x27;s Churchyard.

== Legacy ==
The Gadsden flag has come to symbolize individualism, the American Revolution, and liberty.

Battery Gadsden, an extension of Fort Moultrie on Sullivan&#x27;s Island, is named after him.

<text>North Hamgyong Province (Hamgyŏngbukdo, ) is the northernmost province of North Korea. The province was formed in 1896 from the northern half of the former Hamgyong Province.

==Geography==
The province is bordered by China (Jilin) to the north, South Hamgyong to the southwest and Ryanggang to the west. To the east is the Sea of Japan. The province is home to the Musudan-ri rocket launching site and the Hoeryong concentration camp. In 2004, Rason was reabsorbed back into the province and since 2010, Rason has been a special city of North Korea.

==Economy==
In critical studies of North Korea, North Hamgyong has a reputation as a neglected and underdeveloped region even by the country&#x27;s standards. It was where the 1990s famine hit hardest, and food shortages persist even in the 2020s. The majority of North Korean defectors who live in South Korea came from the province after crossing the relatively shallow Tumen River into China. Therefore, the conditions of the province, which analyst Fyodor Tertitskiy has described as &quot;not only a very grim, but also a very boring place,&quot; tend to be projected onto the whole country, even though they are not representative.

==Administrative divisions==
North Hamgyong is divided into three cities (&quot;si&quot;) and 12 counties (&quot;kun&quot;). These are further divided into villages (&quot;ri&quot;) in rural areas and &quot;dong&quot; (neighborhoods) in cities. Some cities are also divided into wards known as &quot;kuyŏk&quot;, which are administered just below the city level.

===Cities===
* Chongjin (Capital)청진시/
* Hoeryong회령시/
* Kimchaek김책시/

===Counties===
==In popular culture==
* Cha Ki-seong (played by Kim Joo-hyuk), the main antagonist of the 2017 South Korean action comedy film &quot;Confidential Assignment&quot; is revealed to be a native of Hoeryong, one of the main cities of North Hamgyong Province.
* One of the main characters of Netflix&#x27;s famous South Korean thriller series &quot;Squid Game&quot;, Kang Sae-byeok (played by Jung Ho-yeon) is a North Korean defector who is originally from North Hamgyong Province and lived there before defecting with her younger brother Kang Cheol to South Korea.

<text>Boyd Kenneth Packer (September 10, 1924 – July 3, 2015) was an American religious leader and educator who served as president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 2008 until his death. He also served as the quorum&#x27;s acting president from 1994 to 2008 and was an apostle and member of the Quorum of the Twelve from 1970 until his death. He served as a general authority of the church from 1961 until his death.

==Early life and education==
Packer was born on September 10, 1924, in Brigham City, Utah, the tenth of eleven children born to Ira Wight Packer and Emma Jensen. As a young boy, he contracted polio. After graduating from high school, he enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces in the spring of 1943. He graduated as a pilot in September 1944 and was assigned to bomber training. He was on Okinawa when World War II ended, and his unit remained stationed on Japan until 1946. After leaving the military, Packer initially attended Weber College (now Weber State University), where he met his future wife, Donna Smith (1927-2022). They married in the Logan Temple in 1947 and had ten children, including emeritus LDS general authority Allan F. Packer. After their marriage, Packer attended Utah State University, earning a B.S. degree in 1949 and an M.S. degree in 1953. He later earned an Ed.D. from Brigham Young University (BYU) in 1962. Packer was also an artist and enjoyed painting birds. In 2014, BYU&#x27;s Monte L. Bean Life Science Museum installed an exhibit featuring many of Packer&#x27;s paintings and sculptures.

== Career ==

===LDS Church employment and service===
In his career as an educator, Packer worked for the Church Educational System, where he held various administrative positions overseeing seminary and institute programs, including as assistant supervisor of the church&#x27;s Native American seminary programs, general assistant administrator of seminaries and institutes, and later as supervisor of church&#x27;s seminaries and institutes. Packer served a four-year term on the Brigham City City Council.

In 1961, Packer was called by LDS Church president David O. McKay to serve as a general authority as an Assistant to the Twelve (a position that no longer exists). While serving in the position, Packer was assigned to serve as president of the church&#x27;s New England States Mission. He also served for a time as the managing director of the church&#x27;s military relations committee.

Following McKay&#x27;s death in January 1970, Packer, then 45 years old, was called by new church president Joseph Fielding Smith as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles at the church&#x27;s April 1970 general conference. Between 1979 and 1981, he was on the committee that produced the new editions of the LDS Church scriptures. On September 12, 1991, Packer dedicated Ukraine &quot;for the preaching of the restored gospel.&quot; In 1993, Packer read the dedicatory prayer in the Spanish language at the dedication of the San Diego California Temple.

When Howard W. Hunter, who had been President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, succeeded to the presidency of the church in 1994, he called Gordon B. Hinckley and Thomas S. Monson as his counselors in the First Presidency. Packer was the fourth apostle in seniority among the ranks of the church, behind Hunter, Hinckley, and Monson. This created a situation where the only apostles senior to Packer were members of the First Presidency. As a result, Packer was named Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve. When Hunter died in 1995 and was succeeded by Hinckley, Monson was again retained in the First Presidency and Packer was again asked to be Acting President of the Twelve. Of the six acting presidents of the Quorum in the church&#x27;s history, Packer served the longest in that capacity and is the only one to serve under two different church presidents.

In 1999, Packer dedicated the Regina Saskatchewan Temple. Packer became President of the Quorum of the Twelve on February 3, 2008, when Monson became church president. In 2012, Packer dedicated the Brigham City Utah Temple.

===Teachings and legacy===
Packer was well known for several talks and teachings, and several of his stories have been adapted into short films. His sermon about singing a hymn to drive off bad thoughts was adapted into the video &quot;Worthy Thoughts&quot;. His Parable of the Mediator (Jesus Christ) was adapted into the short film &quot;The Mediator&quot;. &quot;The Candle of the Lord&quot; (1982) contained an analogy of trying to describe what salt tastes like to trying to describe what promptings from the Holy Ghost are like. Packer also taught the importance of following the rule before the exception and of hymn-centered prelude music for worship services.

Packer blamed “immorality” in the United States for its loss in the Vietnam War. Items he cited as immoral included “unmarried couples, abortion, the elimination of prayer from public life, addictive drugs, and the placing of the collective rights of the majority in subjugation to any citizen’s individual rights.”

Packer served as an advisor to the Genesis Group, a social organization of the LDS Church for African-American members and their families, and was also active in obtaining genealogical records on microfilm for the church through its Genealogical Society of Utah. In 1977, Packer was a key figure in getting Native American-related records filmed from the federal records centers in Los Angeles, Fort Worth, Seattle, and Kansas City. He was involved in negotiations that same year with archivists and scholars at Jerusalem to microfilm Jewish records.

===Controversy===

In a General Conference Priesthood Session in October 1976, Packer gave a sermon entitled &quot;To Young Men Only&quot;, in which he discouraged boys of the Young Men organization in the Aaronic priesthood from pursuing activities which the LDS Church defines as immoral, including masturbation, the use of pornography, and homosexual activities. The sermon has been criticized for encouraging homophobia and gay bashing. Packer also addressed homosexuality in a 1978 speech, &quot;To the One&quot;, directed to &quot;those few, those very few, who may be subject to homosexual temptation&quot;; and comments during his October 2010 General Conference address, &quot;Cleansing the Inner Vessel&quot;, were interpreted as pertaining to homosexuality and generated a petition by the Human Rights Campaign. The church responded to this petition by reaffirming its doctrinal position on marriage while reiterating the universal need to follow &quot;Jesus Christ&#x27;s second great commandment—to love one another.&quot; Following the conference, Packer altered the published text of the sermon to &quot;clarif[y] his intent.&quot; In 2013, amid a nationwide shift toward acceptance and legalization of same-sex marriage, Packer attracted some attention for comments critical of &quot;legalized acts of immorality&quot; and warning of a &quot;tolerance trap.&quot;

In 1981, Packer advocated that Latter-day Saint historians and educators should use discretion in discussing history that does not promote faith. In a speech to educators in the LDS Church Educational System, he cautioned, &quot;There is a temptation for the writer or teacher of Church history to want to tell everything, whether it is worthy or faith-promoting or not. Some things that are true are not very useful.&quot; Teaching that teachers should &quot;give milk before meat&quot;, he stated that &quot;Teaching some things that are true, prematurely or at the wrong time, can invite sorrow and heartbreak instead of the joy intended to accompany learning.… [S]ome things are to be taught selectively and some things are to be given only to those who are worthy.&quot; Packer&#x27;s opinion applied to all historians who were members of the LDS Church: Packer&#x27;s comments raised criticism by some prominent Mormon and non-Mormon scholars. Soon after Packer&#x27;s 1981 speech, Mormon historian D. Michael Quinn gave a speech highly critical of Packer&#x27;s views, and suggested that a historian who followed Packer&#x27;s advice would sacrifice their honesty and professional integrity. Quinn also discussed what he viewed as a Mormon tradition of portraying LDS leaders as infallible people. C. Robert Mesle has criticized Packer as having created a false dichotomy &quot;between the integrity of faith and the integrity of inquiry.&quot;

==Recognition==
In May 2013, Weber State University, where Packer received an associate degree in 1948 and where he met his wife, designated a public service center for families the &quot;Boyd K. and Donna Smith Packer Family and Community Education Center&quot;. Packer was also interviewed by PBS for its documentary on the LDS Church titled &quot;The Mormons&quot;.

==Death==
Packer died at his home on July 3, 2015. At the time of his death, he was the second-most senior apostle among the ranks of the church and the fifth-longest serving general authority in the church&#x27;s history. His funeral was held on July 10, 2015, and he was buried in Brigham City.

<doc id="398920" wikidata="Q7304796" url="?curid=398920" title="Red Rider">
<text>Red Rider, later known as Tom Cochrane &amp; Red Rider, is a Canadian rock band popular in the 1980s. While they achieved significant success in Canada, the band never had a song in the top 40 in the United States, although &quot;Lunatic Fringe&quot; from their second album, 1981&#x27;s &quot;As Far as Siam&quot;, became popular on US album-oriented rock radio. They also charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with &quot;White Hot&quot; from their debut album &quot;Don&#x27;t Fight It&quot; (1979) and &quot;Young Thing, Wild Dreams (Rock Me)&quot; from &quot;Breaking Curfew&quot; (1984), and charted comparably to &quot;Lunatic Fringe&quot; on Mainstream Rock (AOR) with &quot;Big League&quot;, &quot;Human Race&quot;, and &quot;Power&quot;, the latter two tracks off 1983&#x27;s &quot;Neruda&quot;.

== Band history ==
===As Red Rider ===
Red Rider was formed in Toronto in 1975 when Peter Boynton (keyboards, synthesizers, vocals), Ken Greer (guitars, keyboards, backing vocals) and Rob Baker (drums) joined up with Arvo Lepp (guitar) and Jon Checkowski (bass) and began playing around Toronto, performing both original and cover music.

In 1978, their manager at that time was contacted by Capitol Records about adding singer/guitarist/composer Tom Cochrane to the group. Cochrane was invited to one of the band&#x27;s gigs in London, Ontario to rehearse with them. Boynton, Greer and Baker were impressed with his playing and songwriting but Lepp and Checkowski were not as enthused and decided to leave the band. Jeff Jones (formerly with Ocean and who briefly played for Rush) was then brought in on bass, and it was the lineup of Cochrane, Boynton, Greer, Baker and Jones that were signed to Capitol and released their first album &quot;Don&#x27;t Fight It&quot; in October 1979. With the singles &quot;White Hot&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Fight It&quot;, the album quickly reached gold status.

Their second album, &quot;As Far as Siam&quot;, was released in June 1981 and featured the hit &quot;Lunatic Fringe&quot;, which featured steel guitarist Greer. The song was used in the 1985 movie &quot;Vision Quest&quot;, appeared in the &quot;Miami Vice&quot; episode &quot;Smuggler&#x27;s Blues&quot; and saw high rotation on the United States cable network MTV. It is now a mainstay on American classic rock radio.

Peter Boynton was replaced by keyboardist Steve Sexton on Red Rider&#x27;s third album &quot;Neruda&quot;, released in March 1983, and the track &quot;Napoleon Sheds His Skin&quot; would become one of the more popular songs from the album, while &quot;Human Race&quot; picked up considerable FM radio airplay in the US, becoming their second best known song there after &quot;Lunatic Fringe&quot;. Moreover, the song &quot;Can&#x27;t Turn Back&quot; was used in the &quot;Miami Vice&quot; episode &quot;Tale of the Goat&quot;.

For their next release, &quot;Breaking Curfew&quot; (September 1984), John Webster (formerly with Canadian soft rockers Stonebolt) replaced Sexton on keyboards. The album did not sell as well as &quot;Neruda&quot; and a dispute with Bruce Allen, the band&#x27;s manager, over the future direction of the band resulted in Red Rider&#x27;s departure from the Bruce Allen camp and a change in band members, as Jeff Jones and Rob Baker left. The album did contain the band&#x27;s top-charting single in the US, &quot;Young Thing, Wild Dreams (Rock Me)&quot;, which reached number 71 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

=== As Tom Cochrane &amp; Red Rider ===

In what became a strong signal regarding the future of the band, they officially became known as Tom Cochrane &amp; Red Rider. The line-up consisted of Cochrane, Greer and Webster with new member Ken &quot;Spider&quot; Sinnaeve on bass. For the first album under this revised name (their fifth overall), the group issued the self-titled &quot;Tom Cochrane and Red Rider&quot; LP in May 1986. Sessioneer Graham Broad (Go West and Roger Waters&#x27; band) played drums on the album, recorded in Wales at Rockfield Studios and Metalworks Studios in Mississauga, Ontario over the early months of 1985, produced by Patrick Moran. After the release of the album, Randall Coryell was added to the official lineup for live dates, as was guitarist Peter Mueller; this six-piece version of the band would last through early 1990.

In 1987 Capitol released a compilation CD titled &quot;Over 60 Minutes with Red Rider&quot;, covering the band&#x27;s first four albums. Also in 1987, the band, who had been nominated 11 times for Juno Awards, finally was awarded one for Group of the Year.

In the fall of 1988, the band (now a sextet) released their sixth album, &quot;Victory Day&quot;, which contained the track &quot;Big League&quot;, about the death of a young hockey player. The young man&#x27;s father approached Cochrane on the day of a concert, mentioning that his son was a big fan of Red Rider&#x27;s song &quot;Boy Inside The Man&quot;. Cochrane asked the man if his son was going to be attending the concert and the man responded that his son had recently died in a car accident. Cochrane wrote the song as a memorial, and it became a big hit in Canada (reaching #4), as well as a top 10 hit on US rock radio.

Red Rider&#x27;s final album, &quot;The Symphony Sessions&quot;, which was recorded on March 17 and 18, 1989, and released in December 1989, saw the band performing with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra, as Procol Harum had done seventeen years before. The band broke up in early 1990, shortly after the album was released. Cochrane embarked on a successful solo career, employing Webster and Sinnaeve as part of his backing band.

The three-CD box set &quot;Ashes to Diamonds&quot;, which includes material by both Red Rider and Cochrane as a solo artist, was released in 1993.

===Reformation (2002–present)===
Cochrane, Greer, and Jones reunited as Red Rider in 2002 to play a benefit show after their 1980s guitar tech, John Garrish, was mugged and stabbed to death in the Yorkville section of Toronto. Since that time, Tom Cochrane and Red Rider have continued to tour annually, with Cochrane, Greer, and Jones being the mainstays of this revived version of the group. Keyboardist Webster was involved for a time between 2003 and 2006; current members Davide Direnzo (drums) and Bill Bell (guitar) both joined in 2006, though Bell dropped out for several years (2012-2016) before rejoining.

Professional wrestler Kurt Angle used an instrumental version of &quot;Lunatic Fringe&quot; as his entrance music in TNA. UFC fighter and former Pride Champion Dan &quot;Hendo&quot; Henderson also uses &quot;Lunatic Fringe&quot; as his intro song.

<text>In mathematics, a measure-preserving dynamical system is an object of study in the abstract formulation of dynamical systems, and ergodic theory in particular. Measure-preserving systems obey the Poincaré recurrence theorem, and are a special case of conservative systems. They provide the formal, mathematical basis for a broad range of physical systems, and, in particular, many systems from classical mechanics (in particular, most non-dissipative systems) as well as systems in thermodynamic equilibrium.

==Definition==
A measure-preserving dynamical system is defined as a probability space and a measure-preserving transformation on it. In more detail, it is a system

:formula_1

with the following structure:

*formula_2 is a set,
*formula_3 is a σ-algebra over formula_2,
*formula_5 is a probability measure, so that formula_6, and formula_7,
*formula_8 is a measurable transformation which preserves the measure formula_9, i.e., formula_10.

==Discussion==
One may ask why the measure preserving transformation is defined in terms of the inverse formula_11 instead of the forward transformation formula_12. This can be understood intuitively. 

Consider the typical measure on the unit interval formula_13, and a map formula_14. This is the Bernoulli map. Now, distribute an even layer of paint on the unit interval formula_13, and then map the paint forward. The paint on the formula_16 half is spread thinly over all of formula_13, and the paint on the formula_18 half as well. The two layers of thin paint, layered together, recreates the exact same paint thickness.

More generally, the paint that would arrive at subset formula_19 comes from the subset formula_20. For the paint thickness to remain unchanged (measure-preserving), the mass of incoming paint should be the same: formula_21.

Consider a mapping formula_22 of power sets:
:formula_23
Consider now the special case of maps formula_22 which preserve intersections, unions and complements (so that it is a map of Borel sets) and also sends formula_2 to formula_2 (because we want it to be conservative). Every such conservative, Borel-preserving map can be specified by some surjective map formula_27 by writing formula_28. Of course, one could also define formula_29, but this is not enough to specify all such possible maps formula_22. That is, conservative, Borel-preserving maps formula_22 cannot, in general, be written in the form formula_32.

formula_33 has the form of a pushforward, whereas formula_34 is generically called a pullback. Almost all properties and behaviors of dynamical systems are defined in terms of the pushforward. For example, the transfer operator is defined in terms of the pushforward of the transformation map formula_35; the measure formula_9 can now be understood as an invariant measure; it is just the Frobenius–Perron eigenvector of the transfer operator (recall, the FP eigenvector is the largest eigenvector of a matrix; in this case it is the eigenvector which has the eigenvalue one: the invariant measure.)

There are two classification problems of interest. One, discussed below, fixes formula_37 and asks about the isomorphism classes of a transformation map formula_35. The other, discussed in transfer operator, fixes formula_39 and formula_35, and asks about maps formula_9 that are measure-like. Measure-like, in that they preserve the Borel properties, but are no longer invariant; they are in general dissipative and so give insights into dissipative systems and the route to equilibrium.

In terms of physics, the measure-preserving dynamical system formula_1 often describes a physical system that is in equilibrium, for example, thermodynamic equilibrium. One might ask: how did it get that way? Often, the answer is by stirring, mixing, turbulence, thermalization or other such processes. If a transformation map formula_35 describes this stirring, mixing, etc. then the system formula_1 is all that is left, after all of the transient modes have decayed away. The transient modes are precisely those eigenvectors of the transfer operator that have eigenvalue less than one; the invariant measure formula_9 is the one mode that does not decay away. The rate of decay of the transient modes are given by (the logarithm of) their eigenvalues; the eigenvalue one corresponds to infinite half-life.

==Informal example==
The microcanonical ensemble from physics provides an informal example. Consider, for example, a fluid, gas or plasma in a box of width, length and height formula_46 consisting of formula_47 atoms. A single atom in that box might be anywhere, having arbitrary velocity; it would be represented by a single point in formula_48 A given collection of formula_47 atoms would then be a &quot;single point&quot; somewhere in the space formula_50 The &quot;ensemble&quot; is the collection of all such points, that is, the collection of all such possible boxes (of which there are an uncountably-infinite number). This ensemble of all-possible-boxes is the space formula_2 above.

In the case of an ideal gas, the measure formula_9 is given by the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. It is a product measure, in that if formula_53 is the probability of atom formula_54 having position and velocity formula_55, then, for formula_47 atoms, the probability is the product of formula_47 of these. This measure is understood to apply to the ensemble. So, for example, one of the possible boxes in the ensemble has all of the atoms on one side of the box. One can compute the likelihood of this, in the Maxwell–Boltzmann measure. It will be enormously tiny, of order formula_58 Of all possible boxes in the ensemble, this is a ridiculously small fraction.

The only reason that this is an &quot;informal example&quot; is because writing down the transition function formula_35 is difficult, and, even if written down, it is hard to perform practical computations with it. Difficulties are compounded if there are interactions between the particles themselves, like a van der Waals interaction or some other interaction suitable for a liquid or a plasma; in such cases, the invariant measure is no longer the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. The art of physics is finding reasonable approximations.

This system does exhibit one key idea from the classification of measure-preserving dynamical systems: two ensembles, having different temperatures, are inequivalent. The entropy for a given canonical ensemble depends on its temperature; as physical systems, it is &quot;obvious&quot; that when the temperatures differ, so do the systems. This holds in general: systems with different entropy are not isomorphic.

==Examples==
Example of a ([[Lebesgue measure]]) preserving map: &quot;T&quot; : [0,1) → [0,1), formula_60 Unlike the informal example above, the examples below are sufficiently well-defined and tractable that explicit, formal computations can be performed.

* μ could be the normalized angle measure dθ/2π on the unit circle, and &quot;T&quot; a rotation. See equidistribution theorem;
* the Bernoulli scheme;
* the interval exchange transformation;
* with the definition of an appropriate measure, a subshift of finite type;
* the base flow of a random dynamical system;
* the flow of a Hamiltonian vector field on the tangent bundle of a closed connected smooth manifold is measure-preserving (using the measure induced on the Borel sets by the symplectic volume form) by Liouville&#x27;s theorem (Hamiltonian);
* for certain maps and Markov processes, the Krylov–Bogolyubov theorem establishes the existence of a suitable measure to form a measure-preserving dynamical system.

==Generalization to groups and monoids==
The definition of a measure-preserving dynamical system can be generalized to the case in which &quot;T&quot; is not a single transformation that is iterated to give the dynamics of the system, but instead is a monoid (or even a group, in which case we have the action of a group upon the given probability space) of transformations &quot;Ts&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;X&quot; parametrized by &quot;s&quot; ∈ Z (or R, or N ∪ {0}, or [0, +∞)), where each transformation &quot;Ts&quot; satisfies the same requirements as &quot;T&quot; above. In particular, the transformations obey the rules:
* formula_61, the identity function on &quot;X&quot;;
* formula_62, whenever all the terms are well-defined;
* formula_63, whenever all the terms are well-defined.

The earlier, simpler case fits into this framework by defining &quot;Ts&quot; = &quot;Ts&quot; for &quot;s&quot; ∈ N.

==Homomorphisms==
The concept of a homomorphism and an isomorphism may be defined.

Consider two dynamical systems formula_64 and formula_65. Then a mapping

:formula_66

is a homomorphism of dynamical systems if it satisfies the following three properties:

# The map formula_67 is measurable.
# For each formula_68, one has formula_69.
# For formula_9-almost all formula_71, one has formula_72.

The system formula_65 is then called a factor of formula_64.

The map formula_75 is an isomorphism of dynamical systems if, in addition, there exists another mapping

:formula_76

that is also a homomorphism, which satisfies

# for formula_9-almost all formula_71, one has formula_79;
# for formula_80-almost all formula_81, one has formula_82.

Hence, one may form a category of dynamical systems and their homomorphisms.

==Generic points==
A point &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; is called a generic point if the orbit of the point is distributed uniformly according to the measure.

==Symbolic names and generators==
Consider a dynamical system formula_83, and let &quot;Q&quot; = {&quot;Q&quot;1, ..., &quot;Qk&quot;} be a partition of &quot;X&quot; into &quot;k&quot; measurable pair-wise disjoint sets. Given a point &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot;, clearly &quot;x&quot; belongs to only one of the &quot;Qi&quot;. Similarly, the iterated point &quot;Tnx&quot; can belong to only one of the parts as well. The symbolic name of &quot;x&quot;, with regards to the partition &quot;Q&quot;, is the sequence of integers {&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;} such that

:formula_84

The set of symbolic names with respect to a partition is called the symbolic dynamics of the dynamical system. A partition &quot;Q&quot; is called a generator or generating partition if μ-almost every point &quot;x&quot; has a unique symbolic name.

==Operations on partitions==
Given a partition Q = {&quot;Q&quot;1, ..., &quot;Q&quot;&quot;k&quot;} and a dynamical system formula_83, define the &quot;T&quot;-pullback of &quot;Q&quot; as

:formula_86

Further, given two partitions &quot;Q&quot; = {&quot;Q&quot;1, ..., &quot;Qk&quot;} and &quot;R&quot; = {&quot;R&quot;1, ..., &quot;R&quot;&quot;m&quot;}, define their refinement as

:formula_87

With these two constructs, the &quot;refinement of an iterated pullback&quot; is defined as

:formula_88

which plays crucial role in the construction of the measure-theoretic entropy of a dynamical system.

==Measure-theoretic entropy==

The entropy of a partition formula_89 is defined as

:formula_90

The measure-theoretic entropy of a dynamical system formula_83 with respect to a partition &quot;Q&quot; = {&quot;Q&quot;1, ..., &quot;Q&quot;&quot;k&quot;} is then defined as

:formula_92

Finally, the Kolmogorov–Sinai metric or measure-theoretic entropy of a dynamical system formula_93 is defined as

:formula_94

where the supremum is taken over all finite measurable partitions. A theorem of Yakov Sinai in 1959 shows that the supremum is actually obtained on partitions that are generators. Thus, for example, the entropy of the Bernoulli process is log 2, since almost every real number has a unique binary expansion. That is, one may partition the unit interval into the intervals [0, 1/2) and [1/2, 1]. Every real number &quot;x&quot; is either less than 1/2 or not; and likewise so is the fractional part of 2&quot;n&quot;&quot;x&quot;.

If the space &quot;X&quot; is compact and endowed with a topology, or is a metric space, then the topological entropy may also be defined.

If formula_35 is an ergodic, piecewise expanding, and Markov on formula_96, and formula_9 is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure, then we have the Rokhlin formula (section 4.3 and section 12.3 ):formula_98This allows calculation of entropy of many interval maps, such as the logistic map.

Ergodic means that formula_99 implies formula_100 has full measure or zero measure. Piecewise expanding and Markov means that there is a partition of formula_2 into finitely many open intervals, such that for some formula_102, formula_103 on each open interval. Markov means that for each formula_104 from those open intervals, either formula_105 or formula_106.

==Classification and anti-classification theorems==
One of the primary activities in the study of measure-preserving systems is their classification according to their properties. That is, let formula_37 be a measure space, and let formula_108 be the set of all measure preserving systems formula_1. An isomorphism formula_110 of two transformations formula_111 defines an equivalence relation formula_112 The goal is then to describe the relation formula_113. A number of classification theorems have been obtained; but quite interestingly, a number of anti-classification theorems have been found as well. The anti-classification theorems state that there are more than a countable number of isomorphism classes, and that a countable amount of information is not sufficient to classify isomorphisms.

The first anti-classification theorem, due to Hjorth, states that if formula_108 is endowed with the weak topology, then the set formula_113 is not a Borel set. There are a variety of other anti-classification results. For example, replacing isomorphism with Kakutani equivalence, it can be shown that there are uncountably many non-Kakutani equivalent ergodic measure-preserving transformations of each entropy type.

These stand in contrast to the classification theorems. These include:
* Ergodic measure-preserving transformations with a pure point spectrum have been classified.
* Bernoulli shifts are classified by their metric entropy. See Ornstein theory for more.

<doc id="398932" wikidata="Q268930" url="?curid=398932" title="Meninges">
<text>In anatomy, the meninges (; meninx ; ) are the three membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord. In mammals, the meninges are the dura mater, the arachnoid mater, and the pia mater. Cerebrospinal fluid is located in the subarachnoid space between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater. The primary function of the meninges is to protect the central nervous system.

==Structure==

===Dura mater===
The dura mater (), is a thick, durable membrane, closest to the skull and vertebrae. The dura mater, the outermost part, is a loosely arranged, fibroelastic layer of cells, characterized by multiple interdigitating cell processes, no extracellular collagen, and significant extracellular spaces. The middle region is a mostly fibrous portion. It consists of two layers: the endosteal layer, which lies closest to the skull, and the inner meningeal layer, which lies closer to the brain. It contains larger blood vessels that split into the capillaries in the pia mater. It is composed of dense fibrous tissue, and its inner surface is covered by flattened cells like those present on the surfaces of the pia mater and arachnoid mater. The dura mater is a sac that envelops the arachnoid mater and surrounds and supports the large dural sinuses carrying blood from the brain toward the heart.

The dura has four areas of infolding:
* Falx cerebri, the largest, sickle-shaped; separates the cerebral hemispheres. Starts from the frontal crest of frontal bone and the crista galli running to the internal occipital protuberance.
* Tentorium cerebelli, the second largest, crescent-shaped; separates the occipital lobes from cerebellum. The falx cerebri attaches to it giving a tentlike appearance.
* Falx cerebelli, vertical infolding; lies inferior to the tentorium cerebelli, separating the cerebellar hemispheres.
* Diaphragma sellae, smallest infolding; covers the pituitary gland and sella turcica.
===Arachnoid mater===
The middle element of the meninges is the arachnoid mater, or arachnoid membrane, so named because of its resemblance to a spider web. It cushions the central nervous system. This thin, transparent membrane is composed of fibrous tissue and, like the pia mater, has an outer layer of tightly packed flat cells, forming the arachnoid barrier.

The shape of the arachnoid does not follow the convolutions of the surface of the brain and so looks like a loosely fitting sac. In particular, in the region of the brain a large number of fine filaments called arachnoid trabeculae pass from the arachnoid through the subarachnoid space to blend with the tissue of the pia mater. The arachnoid barrier has no extracellular collagen and is considered to represent an effective morphological and physiological meningeal barrier between the cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space and the blood circulation in the dura.

The arachnoid barrier layer is characterized by a distinct continuous basal lamina on its inner surface toward the innermost collagenous portion of the arachnoid reticular layer.

===Pia mater===

The pia mater () is a very delicate membrane. It is the meningeal envelope that firmly adheres to the surfaces of the brain and spinal cord, following all of the brain&#x27;s contours (gyri and sulci). It is a very thin membrane composed of fibrous tissue covered on its outer surface by a sheet of flat cells thought to be impermeable to fluid. The pia mater is pierced by blood vessels to the brain and spinal cord, and its capillaries nourish the brain.

=== Subarachnoidal lymphatic-like membrane ===

===Leptomeninges===
The arachnoid and pia mater are sometimes together called the &quot;leptomeninges&quot;, literally &quot;thin meninges&quot; ( &quot;leptos&quot;—&quot;thin&quot;). Acute meningococcal meningitis can lead to an exudate within the leptomeninges along the surface of the brain. Because the arachnoid is connected to the pia by cob-web like strands, it is structurally continuous with the pia, hence the name pia-arachnoid or leptomeninges. They are responsible for the production of beta-trace protein (prostaglandin D2 synthase), a major cerebrospinal fluid protein.

===Subarachnoid space===

The subarachnoid space is the space that normally exists between the arachnoid and the pia mater. It is filled with cerebrospinal fluid and continues down the spinal cord. Spaces are formed from openings at different points along the subarachnoid space; these
are the subarachnoid cisterns, which are filled with cerebrospinal fluid.

The dura mater is attached to the skull, whereas in the spinal cord, the dura mater is separated from the vertebrae by a space called the epidural space, which contains fat and blood vessels. The arachnoid is attached to the dura mater, while the pia mater is attached to the central nervous system tissue. When the dura mater and the arachnoid separate through injury or illness, the space between them is the subdural space. There is a subpial space underneath the pia mater that separates it from the glia limitans.

==Clinical significance==
Injuries involving the meninges, can result in a hemorrhage and two types of hematoma.
* A subarachnoid hemorrhage is acute bleeding under the arachnoid; it may occur spontaneously or as a result of trauma.
* A subdural hematoma is a hematoma (collection of blood) located in a separation of the arachnoid from the dura mater. The bridging veins that connect the dura mater and the arachnoid are torn, usually during an accident, and blood leaks into this area.
* An epidural hematoma, bleeding between the dura mater and the skull, may arise after an accident or spontaneously.

Other medical conditions that affect the meninges include meningitis (usually from a fungal, bacterial, or viral infection) and meningiomas that arise from the meninges, or from meningeal carcinomatoses (tumors) that form elsewhere in the body and metastasize to the meninges.

==Other animals==
In fish, there is a single membrane known as the primitive meninx. Amphibians and reptiles have two meninges, and birds and mammals have three. In the early 1900s, Giuseppe Sterzi, an Italian anatomist, carried out comparative studies on the meninges from the lancelet to the human. Contrary to previous reports, the spinal meninges were seen to be very simple, both in the adult lower vertebrates and in the early developmental stages of the more advanced vertebrates. From the mesenchyme surrounding the neural tube, only a single leaflet forms the primitive meninx. In the following phylogenetic and ontogenetic stages, the latter divides into an internal leaflet: the secondary meninx, and into an external one: the dura mater. Finally, in higher vertebrates, even the secondary meninx divides into the arachnoid and the pia. In the same animals, Sterzi demonstrated that, while in the spinal medulla the dura keeps its identity, in the skull it fuses with the periosteum. He also demonstrated the continuity of all meninges with the envelopes of nerves and with the filum terminale.

Mammals (as higher vertebrates) retain the dura mater, and the secondary meninx divides into the arachnoid and pia mater.

<doc id="398933" wikidata="Q2617336" url="?curid=398933" title="Redwall (novel)">
<text>Redwall is a fantasy novel by Brian Jacques. Originally published in 1986, it is the first book of the &quot;Redwall&quot; series. The book was illustrated by Gary Chalk, with the British cover illustration by Pete Lyon and the US cover by Troy Howell. It is also one of the three &quot;Redwall&quot; novels to be made into an animated television series (which is aired on PBS, but produced by the Canadian studio Nelvana), along with &quot;Mattimeo&quot; (Season 2) and &quot;Martin the Warrior&quot; (Season 3).

==Plot summary==
A young anthropomorphic mouse named Matthias is a novice monk at Redwall Abbey, where he was adopted as a young orphan, though he dreams of a life of adventure, inspired by the legends of Martin the Warrior, the founder of Redwall. One summer, Redwall Abbey is surrounded by the army of Cluny the Scourge, an infamously evil one-eyed rat. Matthias is guided by visions of Martin the Warrior, while the abbey inhabitants prepare the defense of their home against Cluny&#x27;s impending attack. Matthias seeks Martin&#x27;s famous sword, supposedly hidden somewhere within the abbey, helped particularly by Methuselah, an ancient and grizzled mouse who serves as Redwall&#x27;s historian. Cluny, meanwhile, attempts to gain entrance to the abbey and murders a defector from his horde, Sela the red fox. Sela&#x27;s son, Chickenhound, seeks refuge at Redwall but ends up accidentally killing Methuselah after being caught stealing. Driven from the abbey, Chickenhound is maimed in the wilderness by the venomous adder Asmodeus Poisonteeth, a local terror in Mossflower Wood, the forest that surrounds the abbey.

Clues to the location of Martin&#x27;s sword and shield have been built into the abbey, allowing Matthias to recover the shield, though he discovers the sword has been stolen by a wild house sparrow tribe, the Sparras, that dwell on Redwall&#x27;s roof. He learns from the violent sparrows that the sword was stolen from them in turn by Asmodeus. The king of the sparrows attacks Matthias but dies when the two plummet together off the abbey roof. Matthias recovers and ventures to Asmodeus&#x27;s lair with his new allies Log-a-Log, a shrew, and Warbeak Sparra, the new and just queen of the aforementioned Sparras. Matthias, Log-a-Log, and two other Shrews succeed in retrieving the sword from Asmodeus&#x27;s cave, Asmodeus kills the latter two, and Matthias subsequently kills Asmodeus. Alerted to the fall of the abbey by the Sparra tribe, Matthias rushes back to Redwall to save his friends.

The Redwall inhabitants have been using boiling water, oil, barrels of hornets, and fire to repel Cluny&#x27;s horde, but the abbey finally falls when Cluny threatens the family of the gatekeeper, who allows Cluny&#x27;s forces access to the abbey. Matthias, his allies now including the Mossflower shrews and the whole Sparra tribe, along with the newly captive Redwall population, battles against Cluny&#x27;s minions. Cluny strikes his poison-barb tail at the father abbot, Mortimer, but Matthias quickly avenges the abbot&#x27;s injury by dropping the abbey&#x27;s giant bell on top of Cluny, crushing him to death and cracking the bell in the process. Abbot Mortimer proclaims Matthias the Warrior of Redwall and dies from his wound. The battle ends in victory for the defenders of Redwall.

An epilogue reveals that Matthias has married the fieldmouse Cornflower and she has given birth to their son, Mattimeo, an abbreviated version of the name Matthias Methuselah Mortimer. The cracked Joseph Bell has been reshaped into two new bells called Matthias and Methuselah.

== Discrepancies ==
As &quot;Redwall&quot; was the first book set in the Redwall world, many of its defining traits were not yet developed, and are different from all subsequent books in the series:

=== The world ===
*&quot;Redwall&quot; appeared to take place in the real world. Cluny was referred to as a Portuguese water rat at one point. Additionally, Methuselah claimed that one of the accounts of Cluny comes from a town dog. The horse present in the early chapters was the size of a normal horse, and the wagon it pulled was scaled to the same size – an entire army of rats was able to ride in it. Also there was a mention of cows that trampled through a village. However, Brian Jacques did not expect the book to be published, and excluded references to humans and many larger animals in later books.
* Aside from the setting of the story—an Abbey with an abbot but no apparent religious observances—the St. Ninian&#x27;s Church is the only reference to any kind of religion in any of the Redwall series, implying that at one point the residents of Mossflower practised Christianity. (Although later in the series, it is rumoured that originally, the sign outside the church said &quot;This ain&#x27;t Ninian&#x27;s!&quot;, and some of the letters wore away.) Jacques firmly stated that the inhabitants of Redwall Abbey practice no religion of any kind. Cluny and his soldiers also mention Satan (&quot;by Satan&#x27;s nose&quot; or &quot;Hell&#x27;s teeth&quot;), referring to a belief in Hell. No other religious mentionings have happened in any of the later books. However, evil characters sometimes use the word &quot;Hellgates&quot; as a reference to death or dying. Dark Forest&#x27;s Gates, or just Dark Forest refers to a place that characters&#x27; souls go after death.

=== Species discrepancy ===
*&quot;Redwall&quot; is the only book in the entire series that makes any mention of domesticated animals. Animals mentioned in this book – but never again in the series – include horse, dog, cow, and pig. Additionally, the Abbot mentions a &quot;village where the dog and pigs reside&quot;, perhaps implying human habitation. In the books following this, the world of Redwall is inhabited only by wild fauna. However, in &quot;Eulalia!&quot; an owl refers to a cow in a song he sings. Moreover, various kinds of milks and cheeses are consumed by the inhabitants of Redwall, though no direct description of such farming or manufacture is ever made.
*The beaver in &quot;Redwall&quot; is the only one to appear in the entire series. Its species has not been mentioned since.
*Bees can communicate in &quot;Redwall&quot;, indicated by a statement at the end of the book where the Guerilla Shrews learned to speak the bee language so they could trade and argue. This was not noted in other books.
*Foxes are indicated in &quot;Redwall&quot; as not inherently evil. It is mentioned that Abbot Mortimer used to trade tomes with &quot;wandering healer foxes&quot;. Sela the vixen&#x27;s brood of foxes was referred to as a bad lot, indicating that they were an exception and not the norm. In all later books, foxes are a &quot;vermin&quot; species.
*Brother Methuselah mentions that it was Martin who gave the first Foremole his title; however, in &quot;Mossflower&quot;, Foremole is already known as such before Martin&#x27;s arrival, though this is most likely because &quot;Mossflower&quot;, Martin&#x27;s debut book, was published after &quot;Redwall&quot;.
*In &quot;Redwall&quot;, the cat is scaled to real life compared to Matthias and Constance the Badger is depicted pulling a cart by herself, but in later books, badgers and wildcats are roughly the size of the other animals (if large).
*In &quot;Redwall&quot;, Guosim was a character, a member of the Guerilla Shrews. In later books, the shrews themselves were referred to as the Guosim, and no mention of the character Guosim was made, even in &quot;Mattimeo&quot;. The Shrews did not rename themselves after her, either, indicated by the fact that they were referred to as Guosim in books chronologically earlier than &quot;Redwall&quot;. Furthermore, while the shrews appear in &quot;Redwall&quot; as an independent tribe with no alliance with the other &quot;good&quot; creatures, in books chronologically earlier they are shown as frequent allies. Log-a-Log, in addition, is always shown as their chief, while he is a mere ferry-shrew in &quot;Redwall&quot;. The customs of the tribe also changed dramatically: In &quot;Redwall&quot; the Guosim are democratic and the actions of the tribe are carried out by votes. In the books following, there is no voting, in fact the actions of the tribe fall primarily on the chieftain&#x27;s decision. (However, it is unofficially mentioned in &quot;Redwall&quot; that &quot;Guosim&quot; stands for &quot;Guerilla Union of Shrews in Mossflower.&quot;

<text>10 Things I Hate About You is a 1999 American teen romantic comedy film directed by Gil Junger in his film directorial debut and starring Julia Stiles, Heath Ledger, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Larisa Oleynik. The screenplay by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith is a modernization of William Shakespeare&#x27;s comedy &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, retold in a late-1990s American high school setting. The film follows new student Cameron James (Gordon-Levitt) who is smitten with Bianca Stratford (Oleynik) and attempts to get bad boy Patrick Verona (Ledger) to date her antisocial sister Kat (Stiles) in order to get around her father&#x27;s strict rules on dating. Named after a poem Kat writes about her romance with Patrick, the film was mostly shot in the Seattle metropolitan area, with many scenes filmed at Stadium High School in Tacoma, Washington.

Released on March 31, 1999, &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; grossed $53.7 million and received generally positive reviews from critics. It provided breakthrough roles for Stiles, Ledger, and Gordon-Levitt, all of whom were nominated for various teen-oriented awards. Ten years later, it was adapted into a television reboot, which ran for twenty episodes and featured Larry Miller reprising his role as Walter Stratford. Since release, it has gained popularity as a cult classic, often being cited as one of the greatest romantic comedies of all time.

==Plot==
Cameron James, a new student at Padua High School in the Seattle area, immediately becomes smitten with beautiful and popular sophomore Bianca Stratford. Geeky Michael Eckman warns him that she is vapid and conceited, and that her overprotective single father Walter, an obstetrician worried about teenage pregnancy, does not allow her or her shrewish older sister Kat, a senior, to date. Kat is accepted to Sarah Lawrence College in New York, but Walter wants her to stay close to home and attend his alma mater, the University of Washington. Bianca wishes to date affluent senior Joey Donner, but Walter will not allow his daughters to date until they graduate. Frustrated by Bianca&#x27;s insistence and Kat&#x27;s rebelliousness, Walter relents and declares that Bianca may date only when Kat does, knowing that Kat&#x27;s antisocial attitude will greatly complicate it.

When Cameron asks Bianca out, she informs him of her father&#x27;s new rule and suggests he find someone willing to date Kat so that she can freely date Joey. He selects Australian &quot;bad boy&quot; Patrick Verona, who initially frightens him with his attitude. Michael assists by convincing Joey to pay Patrick to take Kat out, believing that it will allow Joey to date Bianca. Patrick agrees to the deal, but Kat initially rebuffs his first few advances. After Michael and Cameron assist him by probing Bianca for information on Kat&#x27;s preferences, Patrick begins to win Kat&#x27;s interest. She goes to a party with him, which enables Bianca to tag along, greatly upsetting Walter.

At the party, Kat becomes upset upon seeing Bianca with Joey, and responds by getting intoxicated. Patrick attends to her, and she starts to open up to him, expressing her interest in forming a band. When Kat attempts to kiss him, Patrick pulls away, causing her to depart, infuriated. Meanwhile, Bianca upsets Cameron by ignoring him for Joey, but soon realizes that Joey is indeed shallow and self-absorbed. When she asks Cameron to drive her home, he admits his feelings for her are indeed genuine and her treatment of him has frustrated him, and she reconciliatorily kisses him in response.

Joey offers to pay Patrick to take Kat to the prom so he can take Bianca. He initially refuses, but relents when Joey offers him more money. Although Kat is still angry with Patrick, he eventually wins her over by serenading her, accompanied by the Padua High School marching band, with a performance of &quot;Can&#x27;t Take My Eyes Off You&quot; by Frankie Valli, and she returns the favor by assisting him in sneaking out of detention. Their subsequent date turns romantic, but Kat becomes suspicious when Patrick insists that she accompany him to the prom, which she adamantly opposes.

Irritated at not being asked to the prom by Cameron, Bianca accepts Joey&#x27;s invitation, but Walter declines to allow it unless Kat accompanies her. Kat confesses to Bianca that she dated Joey when they were freshmen and, succumbing to peer pressure, had sex with him, later regretting it. After Joey dumped her, she vowed against doing anything out of peer pressure. Bianca insists that she can decide her own life, so Kat agrees to attend the prom with Patrick, and Bianca decides to go with Cameron instead of Joey. At the prom, Bianca learns that Joey planned to have sex with her that night. Angry that Bianca has spurned him for Cameron, Joey reveals his arrangement with Patrick, which causes Kat to leave, heartbroken. Joey then shoves Michael and punches Cameron, but Bianca then assaults him for having hurt her, Kat, and Cameron. Bianca and Cameron share another kiss.

The following day, Bianca reconciles with Kat and begins dating Cameron. Comfortable that Kat can handle herself, Walter permits her to attend Sarah Lawrence College. For an assignment in which the students were tasked to write their own versions of William Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnet 141, Kat reads aloud a poem she composed, entitled &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot;, revealing that she still loves and cares for Patrick. He surprises her with a Fender Stratocaster that he bought with the money Joey paid him, and confesses that he has fallen for her. Kat forgives him, and they reconcile with a kiss.

==Production==
=== Background ===
Writing duo Karen McCullah and Kirsten Smith were inspired to write &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; after watching &quot;Clueless&quot; (1995). Being a fan of teen films, the pair set out to find a classic play or myth to turn it into a contemporary high-school movie, eventually settling on &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, a comedy by William Shakespeare. They wanted to write a strong-willed, feminist character. Patrick Verona was inspired by Judd Nelson&#x27;s character in &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; (1985). The script was finalized in November 1997. The screenplay was eventually picked up by The Walt Disney Company, with Gil Junger attached to direct.

=== Casting ===
Junger was keen to find unknown actors for the movie. Josh Hartnett and Ashton Kutcher were in the running to play Patrick Verona. Eliza Dushku auditioned for the role of Kat Stratford. Katie Holmes was also considered for the role. Kate Hudson was offered the part but her mother, Goldie Hawn, did not like the script, so she passed on the role. Casting director Marcia Ross contacted Junger, and recommended Julia Stiles for the role. Junger met her that evening and was &quot;immediately taken&quot;; after the 10 minute meeting, he gave her the role. Casting for Patrick Verona was a long process, with Junger reporting he had seen over a 1,000 boys for the role. Three and a half weeks before filming was due to start, Ross brought Heath Ledger into a casting session, who charmed Junger and was immediately cast.

=== Filming ===
Filming took place in 1998, between June 8 and August 6. Many of the scenes were filmed on location at Stadium High School and at a house in the North End of Tacoma, Washington. The prom sequence was shot over three days in Seattle. Ledger&#x27;s singing scene in the high-school bleachers, regarded as one of the most iconic scenes of the movie, had just three takes. The song for the scene changed numerous times, almost being &quot;I Touch Myself&quot; by Australian rock band Divinyls, before &quot;Can&#x27;t Take My Eyes Off You&quot; by Frankie Valli was settled on.

Costume designer Kim Tillman designed original dresses for Larisa Oleynik and Julia Stiles, as well as the period outfits for Susan May Pratt and David Krumholtz. Gabrielle Union&#x27;s snakeskin prom dress is a Betsey Johnson design. Heath Ledger&#x27;s and Joseph Gordon-Levitt&#x27;s vintage tuxedos came from Isadora&#x27;s in Seattle.

==Reception==
===Box office===
In its opening weekend, the film grossed $8.3 million in 2,271 theaters domestically, finishing second at the box office, behind &quot;The Matrix&quot;. It earned $21 million in the first five days of release. The movie grossed a total of $38.2 million in the U.S. and Canada, and $15.3 million in other territories, for $53.7 million worldwide.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 71% based on 92 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus states: &quot;Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger add strong performances to an unexpectedly clever script, elevating &quot;10 Things&quot; (slightly) above typical teen fare.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 70 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Geoff Andrew from &quot;Time Out&quot; praised the film&#x27;s leads, writing, &quot;Stiles grows into her character, and Ledger is effortlessly charming.&quot; Brad Laidman of &quot;Film Threat&quot; said the film was &quot;pure of heart and perfectly executed.&quot; Ron Wells, also of &quot;Film Threat&quot;, wrote, &quot;Of all the teen films released this year, this one is, by far, the best.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying that he &quot;liked the movie&#x27;s spirit, the actors and some of the scenes. The music, much of it by the band Letters to Cleo, is subtle and inventive while still cheerful. The movie almost but not quite achieves liftoff against the gravitational pull of the tired story formula.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; put the film 49th on its list of Best High School Movies. The costuming was praised by &quot;Vogue&quot; for being stylish and helping illustrate the divide between the Stratford sisters, referring to the movie as a &quot;time capsule&quot; for 90&#x27;s fashion.

===Accolades===
&quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; provided breakthrough roles for Stiles, Ledger, and Gordon-Levitt. Gordon-Levitt, Stiles, and Oleynik each received YoungStar Award nominations for Best Actor/Actress in a Comedy Film. The movie was nominated for seven Teen Choice Awards: Choice Movie: Breakout Star (Stiles), Choice Movie: Comedy, Choice Movie: Funniest Scene (featuring Krumholtz), Choice Movie: Love Scene (featuring Stiles and Ledger), Choice Movie: Hissy Fit (Gordon-Levitt), Choice Movie: Villain (Andrew Keegan) and Choice Movie: Soundtrack at the 1999 Teen Choice Awards. The film&#x27;s casting directors Marcia Ross and Donna Morong were nominated for Best Casting for Feature Film, Comedy at the Casting Society of America&#x27;s Artios Awards in 1999. In 2000, Stiles won the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Most Promising Actress (tied with Émilie Dequenne in &quot;Rosetta&quot;) at the 1999 CFCA Awards and an MTV Movie Award for Breakthrough Female Performance at the 2000 MTV Movie Awards. Ledger was also nominated for an MTV Movie Award for Best Musical Performance for the song &quot;Can&#x27;t Take My Eyes Off You&quot;.

==Soundtrack==
The film&#x27;s soundtrack album, featuring Letters to Cleo performing cover versions of Cheap Trick&#x27;s &quot;I Want You to Want Me&quot; and Nick Lowe&#x27;s &quot;Cruel to Be Kind&quot;, stayed on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart for seven weeks, peaking at no. 52. Reviewer S. Peeples of AllMusic rated it 3 stars out of 5, calling it &quot;one of the best modern rock soundtracks of the spring 1999 season&quot;.

===Certifications===


== Legacy and cultural impact ==
The film is often considered one of the greatest teen and romantic comedies of all time, receiving praise for subverting expectations and having a feminist lead character. The film has been cited as an influence for Netflix&#x27;s romcom revival. Kat&#x27;s defiance for conventional feminine attitudes was seen as an &quot;extreme&quot; brand of feminism at the time, however is now retrospectively regarded as a progressive portrayal of an independent female character that challenged the traditional teen movie archetypes, aligning more closely with modern feminist ideals. The film is often regarded to be a cult classic due to the unconventional stereotypes resonating throughout generations and in youth culture years later. &quot;Teen Vogue&quot; ranked the movie number one on their list for best teen romance movies. &quot;GQ&quot; had the movie for their list of the best 90&#x27;s movies, and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; had the film on their list of the best movies that defined the 90&#x27;s.

In 2024, during the Drake–Kendrick Lamar feud, Drake responded to Lamar&#x27;s diss track &quot;Euphoria&quot; by sharing a clip of the movie on Instagram, showing Stiles&#x27; reading the titular poem.

===Adaptations===
In June 1999, the Scholastic Corporation published a novelization of the story, adapted by David Levithan. The story is retold as it is in the film, with each chapter written from the point of view of either Bianca, Cameron, Kat, Patrick, or Michael.

In October 2008, ABC Family ordered a pilot episode of &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot;, a half-hour, single-camera comedy series based on the film. Larry Miller is the only actor from the film to reprise his role of Walter Stratford in the TV series. The director of the film, Gil Junger, directed many of the episodes, including the pilot; the film&#x27;s composer, Richard Gibbs, also returned to do the show&#x27;s music. The series was adapted and produced by Carter Covington. The show premiered on July 7, 2009, and ended on May 24, 2010, lasting 20 episodes.

<doc id="398940" wikidata="Q769220" url="?curid=398940" title="Paresthesia">
<text>Paresthesia, also known as pins and needles, is an abnormal sensation of the skin (tingling, pricking, chilling, burning, numbness) with no apparent physical cause. Paresthesia may be transient or chronic, and may have many possible underlying causes. The phenomenon can occur in people of any age. Paresthesias are usually painless and can occur anywhere on the body, but most commonly occur in the arms and legs.

The most familiar kind of paresthesia is the sensation known as &quot;pins and needles&quot; after having a limb &quot;fall asleep&quot;. A less well-known and uncommon paresthesia is formication, the sensation of insects crawling on the skin.

==Causes==
===Transient===
Paresthesias of the hands, feet, legs, and arms are common transient symptoms. The briefest electric shock type of paresthesia can be caused by tweaking the ulnar nerve near the elbow; this phenomenon is colloquially known as bumping one&#x27;s &quot;funny bone&quot;. Similar brief shocks can be experienced when any other nerve is tweaked (e.g. a pinched neck nerve may cause a brief shock-like paresthesia toward the scalp). In the older age group, spinal column irregularities may tweak the spinal cord briefly when the head or back is turned, flexed, or extended into brief uncommon positions (Lhermitte&#x27;s sign).

The most common everyday cause is temporary restriction of nerve impulses to an area of nerves, commonly caused by leaning or resting on parts of the body such as the legs (often followed by a pins and needles tingling sensation). Other causes include conditions such as hyperventilation syndrome and panic attacks. A cold sore outside the mouth (not a canker sore inside the mouth) can be preceded by tingling due to activity of the causative herpes simplex virus. The varicella zoster virus (shingles) also notably may cause recurring pain and tingling in skin or tissue along the distribution path of that nerve (most commonly in the skin, along a dermatome pattern, but sometimes feeling like a headache, chest or abdominal pain, or pelvic pain).

Other common examples occur when sustained pressure has been applied over a nerve, inhibiting or stimulating its function. Removing the pressure typically results in gradual relief of these paresthesias. Most pressure-induced paraesthesia results from awkward posture, such as engaging in cross-legged sitting for prolonged periods of time.

Reactive hyperaemia, which occurs when blood flow is restored after a period of ischemia, may be accompanied by paresthesia, e.g. when patients with Raynaud&#x27;s disease rewarm after a cold episode.

Cases of paresthesia have also been reported at varying frequencies following anthrax, flu, HPV and COVID-19 vaccine intake. Benzodiazepine withdrawal may also cause paresthesia, as the drug removal leaves the GABA receptors stripped bare and possibly malformed. 

===Chronic===
Chronic paresthesia (Berger&#x27;s paresthesia, Sinagesia, or Bernhardt paresthesia) indicates either a problem with the functioning of neurons, or poor circulation.

In the elderly, paresthesia is often the result of poor circulation in the limbs (such as in peripheral vascular disease), most often caused by atherosclerosis, the build-up of plaque within artery walls over decades, with eventual plaque ruptures, internal clots over the ruptures, and subsequent clot healing, but leaving behind narrowing or closure of the artery openings, locally and/or in downstream smaller branches. Without a proper supply of blood and nutrients, nerve cells can no longer adequately send signals to the brain. Because of this, paresthesia can also be a symptom of vitamin deficiency or other malnutrition, as well as metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, or hypoparathyroidism. It can also be a symptom of mercury poisoning.

Irritation to the nerve can also come from inflammation to the tissue. Joint conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and carpal tunnel syndrome are common sources of paresthesia. Nerves below the head may be compressed where chronic neck and spine problems exist, and can be caused by, among other things, muscle cramps that may be a result of clinical anxiety or excessive mental stress, bone disease, poor posture, unsafe heavy lifting practices, or physical trauma such as whiplash.

Another cause of paresthesia may be direct damage to the nerves themselves, i.e., neuropathy, which itself can stem from injury, such as from frostbite; infections such as Lyme disease; or may be indicative of a current neurological disorder. Neuropathy is also a side effect of some chemotherapies, such as in the case of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Chronic paresthesia can sometimes be symptomatic of serious conditions, such as a transient ischemic attack; or autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, complex regional pain syndrome, or lupus erythematosus. The use of fluoroquinolones can also cause paresthesia. Stroke survivors and those with traumatic brain injury (TBI) may experience paresthesia from damage to the central nervous system.

===Acroparesthesia===
Acroparesthesia is severe pain in the extremities, and may be caused by Fabry disease, a type of sphingolipidosis.

It can also be a sign of hypocalcemia.

===Dentistry===
Dental paresthesia is loss of sensation caused by maxillary or mandibular anesthetic administration before dental treatment.

Potential causes include trauma introduced to the nerve sheath during administration of the injection, hemorrhage about the sheath, more side-effect-prone types of anesthetic being used, or administration of anesthetic contaminated with alcohol or sterilizing solutions.

===Other===
Other causes may include:

* Autonomous sensory meridian response (&quot;ASMR&quot;)
* Carpal tunnel syndrome
* Cerebral amyloid angiopathy
* Chiari malformation
* Coeliac disease 
* Complex regional pain syndrome
* Cubital tunnel syndrome
* Decompression sickness
* Dehydration
* Erythromelalgia
* Fabry disease
* Fibromyalgia
* Fluoroquinolone toxicity
* Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS)
* Heavy metals
* Herpes zoster
* Hydroxy alpha sanshool, a component of Sichuan peppers
* Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar)
* Hyperkalemia
* Hyperventilation
* Hypocalcemia, and in turn:
** Hypermagnesemia, a condition in which hypocalcemia itself is typically observed as a secondary symptom
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
* Hypothyroidism
* Immunodeficiency, such as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP)
* Lupus erythematosus
* Lyme disease
* Magnesium deficiency, often as a result of long-term proton-pump inhibitor use
* Menopause
* Mercury poisoning
* Migraines
* Multiple sclerosis
* Nerve compression syndrome
* Obdormition
* Oxygen toxicity, especially breathing oxygen under pressure, such as in scuba diving
* Pyrethrum or pyrethroid pesticides
* Post-polio syndrome
* Rabies
* Radiation poisoning
* Sarcoidosis
* Sciatica
* Scorpion stings
* Spinal disc herniation or injury
* Spinal stenosis
* Stinging nettles
* Syringomyelia
* Transverse myelitis
* Variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (AKA &quot;mad cow disease&quot;)
* Vitamin B5 deficiency
* Vitamin B6 excess
* Vitamin B12 deficiency
===Drugs===
* Anticonvulsant pharmaceutical drugs, such as topiramate, sultiame, or acetazolamide
* Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome
* Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome
* Beta alanine
* Dextromethorphan (recreational use)
* Intravenous administering of strong pharmaceutical drugs acting on the central nervous system (CNS), mainly opiates, opioids, or other narcotics, especially in non-medical use (drug abuse)
* Ketorolac
* Lidocaine poisoning
* Lomotil
* Nitrous oxide, long-term exposure
* Ritonavir

==Diagnostics==
A nerve conduction study usually provides useful information for making a diagnosis. An MRI or a CT scan is sometimes used to rule out certain causes stemming from central nervous system issues.

==Treatment==
Medications offered can include the immunosuppressant prednisone, intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG), anticonvulsants such as gabapentin or tiagabine, or antiviral medication, depending on the underlying cause.

In addition to treatment of the underlying disorder, palliative care can include the use of topical numbing creams, such as lidocaine or prilocaine. Ketamine has also been successfully used, but is generally not approved by insurance. Careful consideration must be taken to apply only the necessary amount, as excess can contribute to these conditions. Otherwise, these products generally offer extremely effective, but short-lasting relief from these conditions.

Paresthesia caused by stroke may receive some temporary benefit from high doses of baclofen multiple times a day. HIV patients who self-medicate with cannabis report that it reduces their symptoms.

Paresthesia caused by shingles is treated with appropriate antiviral medication.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;paresthesia&quot; (; British English &quot;paraesthesia&quot;; plural paraesthesiae or paraesthesias) comes from the Greek &quot;para&quot; (&quot;beside&quot;, &quot;i.e.&quot;, abnormal) and &quot;aisthesia&quot; (&quot;sensation&quot;).

<text>Ryanggang Province (Ryanggangdo; , ) is a province in North Korea. The province is bordered by China (Jilin) to the north, North Hamgyong to the east, South Hamgyong to the south, and Chagang to the west. Ryanggang was formed in 1954, when it was separated from South Hamgyŏng. The provincial capital is Hyesan. In South Korean usage, &quot;Ryanggang&quot; is spelled and pronounced as &quot;Yanggang&quot; , ).

==Description==
Along the northern border with China runs the Yalu River and the Tumen River. In between the rivers, and the source of both, is Paektu Mountain, revered by both the Koreans and Manchurians as the mythic origin of each people. The North Korean government claims that Kim Jong-il was born there when his parents were at a Communist anti-Japanese resistance camp at the mountain. The North Korean-Chinese border for east of the mountain is &quot;dry, remote and mountainous, barely patrolled,&quot; making it one of the crossing areas for refugees from North Korea into China, although most, including refugees from Ryanggang itself, prefer to cross over the Tumen River.

Although all of North Korea is economically depressed after Soviet dissolution, Ryanggang province, along with neighboring North Hamgyong and South Hamgyong provinces, are the poorest, forming North Korea&#x27;s &quot;Rust Belt&quot; of industrialized cities with factories now decrepit and failing. The worst hunger of the 1990s famine years occurred in these three provinces, and most refugees into China come from the Rust Belt region.

===Ryanggang explosion===

An explosion and mushroom cloud was reportedly detected in Kimhyŏngjik-gun on 9 September 2004, the 56th anniversary of the creation of North Korea. This was reported a few days later on 12 September.

===Power supply issues===
In recent years, power supply problems have become prevalent in Ryanggang.

==Administrative divisions==
Ryanggang is divided into 2 cities (&quot;si&quot;) and 10 counties (&quot;kun&quot;). Each entity is listed below in English, Chosŏn&#x27;gŭl, and Hanja.

<text>Shaken baby syndrome (SBS), also known as abusive head trauma (AHT), is a controversial and scientifically disputed medical condition in children younger than five years old, hypothesized to be caused by blunt trauma, vigorous shaking, or a combination of both.

According to literature, the condition is caused by violent shaking with or without blunt impact that can lead to long-term health consequences for infants or children. Diagnosis can be difficult as symptoms may be nonspecific. A CT scan of the head is typically recommended if a concern is present. If there are concerning findings on the CT scan, a full work-up for child abuse often occurs, including an eye exam and skeletal survey. Retinal hemorrhage is highly associated with AHT, occurring in 78% of cases of AHT versus 5% of cases of non-abusive head trauma, although such findings rely on poor methodology including circular reasoning. Diagnosis is generally characterized by a triad of findings: retinal hemorrhage, encephalopathy, and subdural hematoma. A 2023 review concluded &quot;research has shown the triad is not sufficient to infer shaking or abuse and the shaking hypothesis does not meet the standards of evidence based medicine&quot;.
The concept is controversial in child abuse pediatrics, with critics arguing it is an unproven hypothesis that has little diagnostic accuracy. Diagnosing the syndrome has proven to be both challenging and contentious for medical professionals because objective witnesses to the initial trauma are generally unavailable, although when independent witnesses to shaking are available, the associated injuries do not actually occur. This is said to be particularly problematic when the trauma is deemed &#x27;non-accidental.&#x27; Some medical professionals propose that SBS is the result of respiratory abnormalities leading to hypoxia and swelling of the brain. whilst it has also been shown that the findings associated with SBS may just be non specific markers of the degree of intracranial pathology. 

The courtroom has become a forum for conflicting theories with which generally accepted medical literature has not been reconciled. There are often no outwardly visible signs of trauma, despite the presence of severe internal brain and eye injury. Complications include seizures, visual impairment, hearing loss, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, cognitive impairment, cardiac arrest, coma, and death.
According to proponents, SBS is the leading cause of fatal head injuries in children under two, with a risk of death of about 25%. This figure has been criticized for circular reasoning, selection bias and that violent shaking very rarely causes serious injury. The most common symptoms are said to be retinal bleeds, multiple fractures of the long bones, and subdural hematomas (bleeding in the brain). Educating new parents appears to be beneficial in decreasing rates of the condition, although other studies have shown that education does not change rates. SBS is estimated to occur in three to four per 10,000 babies per year.

Retinal hemorrhage (bleeding) occurs in around 85% of SBS cases and the severity of retinal hemorrhage correlates with severity of head injury. Although again, that result is based on circular reasoning and selection bias. In fact, RHs are very rare when infants are actually witnessed to have been shaken. The type of retinal bleeds are often believed to be particularly characteristic of this condition, making the finding useful in establishing the diagnosis, although again such patterns are not found when shaking is independently witnessed, and is almost certainly due to selection bias. 

Fractures of the vertebrae, long bones, and ribs may also be associated with SBS. Infants may display irritability, failure to thrive, alterations in eating patterns, lethargy, vomiting, seizures, bulging or tense fontanelles (the soft spots on a baby&#x27;s head), increased size of the head, altered breathing, and dilated pupils, although all these clinical findings are generic and are known to have a range of causes, with shaking certainly not the most common cause of any of them.

==History==
In 1971, Norman Guthkelch proposed that whiplash injury caused subdural bleeding in infants by tearing the veins in the subdural space. The term &quot;whiplash shaken infant syndrome&quot; was introduced by Dr. John Caffey, a pediatric radiologist, in 1973, describing a set of symptoms found with little or no external evidence of head trauma, including retinal bleeds and intracranial bleeds with subdural or subarachnoid bleeding or both. Development of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging techniques in the 1970s and 1980s advanced the ability to diagnose the syndrome. In 1997, shaken baby syndrome was brought into the national spotlight with the trial of Louise Woodward.

==Epidemiology==
The incidence of shaken baby syndrome is unknown due to difficulty in diagnosis, which may be caused by lack of centralized reporting system, absent signs of maltreatment, unclear presentation, and acute head trauma being classified under chronic neglect. Incidence is estimated to be 35 out of 100,000 infants, 65% of these infants have significant neurological disabilities, and 5 to 35% of infants die as a result of sustained injuries. For children under the age of one, US-based studies have found rates of 27.5 out of 100,000 infants for the years 1997 and 2000 and a rate of 32.2 out of 100,000 in the year 2003. However, these statistics are presumably underestimates of the actual incidence of SBS, because there are children whose injuries may not be perceived as serious enough to be hospitalized, and those who have been hospitalized but diagnosis was missed. On the other hand, there may be significant overdiagosis of SBS, which would make these findings an over-estimate. 

Small children are at particularly high risk for abuse associated with SBS given the large difference in size between the small child and the caretaker. SBS is primarily observed in children under the age of two but may occur in those up to age five. The majority of cases typically occur before the infant&#x27;s first birthday with the average victim age between three and eight months old. In the US, deaths due to SBS constitute about 10% of deaths due to child abuse.

==Risk factors==
Common risk factors for shaken baby syndrome include perceived excessive crying, behavioral health problems, domestic violence history, frustration intolerance, lack of childcare experience, young infant age, young maternal age, multiple births, having a male infant, full-time working, postpartum depression, single parent families and economic adversity. The perpetrators of acute head trauma typically involve the father, stepfather, mother&#x27;s boyfriend, female babysitter and the mother. The age group from child birth to the age of 4 are at greater risk of SBS due to multiple factors, including disproportionate anatomy, lack of or inability to communicate needs, and inability to protect self from a larger adult.

Episodes of colic are greatest at 6 to 8 weeks of age, and studies have shown a peak in SBS incidence during this time as parents may perceive these episodes as excessive crying. Caregivers that are at risk for becoming abusive often have unrealistic expectations of the child and may display &quot;role reversal&quot;, expecting the child to fulfill the needs of the caregiver. Substance abuse and emotional stress, resulting for example from low socioeconomic status or family instability, are other risk factors for aggression and impulsiveness in caregivers. Caregivers of any gender can cause SBS, but cases of SBS have been reported to be more common amongst younger parents. Studies have shown increased prevalence of SBS among parents 34 years old or younger, especially 24 years old or younger. Although it had been previously speculated that SBS was an isolated event, evidence of prior child abuse is a common finding. In an estimated 33–40% of cases, evidence of prior head injuries, such as old intracranial bleeds, is present.

At the community level, risk factors for shaken baby syndrome include social isolation, lack of recreational facilities, lack of external support from family or governmental agencies, unsafe neighborhoods and societal factors such as poverty.

==Mechanism==
Shaken Baby Syndrome, also called as Shaken Impact Syndrome, is a severe form of child abuse. It occurs when parents or caregivers shake a baby. There is a strong association between crying and SBS, where studies indicate 1-6% of parents have shaken their babies to stop crying. Furthermore, the caregiver&#x27;s worries and views on crying are more predictive of shaking than the objective amount of crying. Evidence indicates early crying pattern as the common trigger for SBS, and it results from a failure in what is usually a normal interaction between infants and caregivers.

Effects of SBS are thought to be diffuse axonal injury, oxygen deprivation and swelling of the brain, which can raise pressure inside the skull and damage delicate brain tissue, although witnessed shaking events have not led to such injuries. Direct injuries include skull fractures, cortical contusions, diffuse axonal injuries, and hemorrhages. Indirect injuries includes brain edema and herniation.

Traumatic shaking occurs when a child is shaken in such a way that its head is flung backwards and forwards. This swift movement resulted in collision of brain to the skull, potentially tearing blood vessels and leading to bleeding around the brain, resulting in the formation of hematoma. As the hematoma enlarges, it can increase pressure within the skull, causing further injury to the brain. The In 1971, Guthkelch, a neurosurgeon, hypothesized that such shaking can result in a subdural hematoma, in the absence of any detectable external signs of injury to the skull. The article describes two cases in which the parents admitted that for various reasons they had shaken the child before it became ill. Moreover, one of the babies had retinal hemorrhages. The association between traumatic shaking, subdural hematoma and retinal hemorrhages was described in 1972 and referred to as &quot;whiplash shaken infant syndrome&quot;. The injuries were believed to occur because shaking the child subjected the head to acceleration–deceleration and rotational forces. However in the 50 years since that time, no scientifically reliable evidence has been found to support this hypothesis. 

=== Injuries ===
The mechanical basis for SBS comes from a combination of babies having weaker neck muscles and larger heads. For example, shaking the baby can lead to veins and nerves stretching and shearing due to the head extending beyond what the baby&#x27;s neck can support. Other types of injuries that can occur when shaking a baby, with or without the sudden deceleration of the head, are the following:

* Subdural hematoma, a collection of blood between the brain&#x27;s surface and the dura, due to overstretching of the veins connecting the brain to the dura, leading to tears and bleeding.
* Subarachnoid hemorrhage, bleeding between the brain and arachnoid
* Direct brain trauma, due to the brain striking the inner surfaces of the skull.
* Eye injury, retinal hemorrhage caused by to and from oscillation of the lens
* Skeletal injury, posterior rib fracture caused by squeezing the chest as the child is tightly gripped.

=== Signs and symptoms of SBS ===
Possible signs and symptoms of Shaken Baby Syndrome include lethargy, decreased muscle tone, and extreme irritability. Affected infants may show a decreased in appetite, poor feeding, or vomiting without an apparent reason. Physical signs can include grab-type bruise on the arms or chest, and lack of smiling or vocalization. Other symptoms includes poor sucking or swallowing, rigidity or posturing, and difficulty breathing. There may be a decreased level of consciousness. The soft spot on the head may appear bulging, and the infant might struggle to lift their head. In addition, the infant&#x27;s eyes might not focus or track movement properly, and the pupils may be of unequal size.

=== Consequences of SBS ===
The consequences of SBS can be severe and long-lasting. They include learning disabilities, physical disabilities, visual impairment or blindness, and hearing impairments. Affected individuals may also experience speech disabilities, cerebral palsy, seizures, and behavior disorders. Cognitive impairments are common, and in the most severe cases, it can result in death.

===Force===
There has been controversy regarding the amount of force required to produce the brain damage seen in SBS. There is broad agreement, even amongst skeptics, that shaking of a baby is dangerous and can be fatal.

A biomechanical analysis by F. A. Bandak published in 2005 reported that &quot;forceful shaking can severely injure or kill an infant, this is because the cervical spine would be severely injured and not because subdural hematomas would be caused by high head rotational accelerations... an infant head subjected to the levels of rotational velocity and acceleration called for in the SBS literature, would experience forces on the infant neck far exceeding the limits for structural failure of the cervical spine. Furthermore, shaking cervical spine injury can occur at much lower levels of head velocity and acceleration than those reported for SBS.&quot; Other authors were critical of the mathematical analysis by Bandak, citing concerns about the calculations the author used concluding &quot;In light of the numerical errors in Bandak&#x27;s neck force estimations, we question the resolute tenor of Bandak&#x27;s conclusions that neck injuries would occur in all shaking events.&quot; Other authors critical of the model proposed by Bandak concluding &quot;the mechanical analogue proposed in the paper may not be entirely appropriate when used to model the motion of the head and neck of infants when a baby is shaken.&quot; Bandak responded to the criticism in a letter to the editor published in &quot;Forensic Science International&quot; in February 2006.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis can be difficult as symptoms may be nonspecific. Symptoms may include altered mental status, trouble breathing, and vomiting. As a result, about 31% of true SBS cases may go unnoticed initially. However, imaging can provide valuable information about a potential SBS diagnosis. Imaging must be performed within at least 24 hours of the suspected injury to detect brain edema characteristic of SBS. A CT scan of the head is typically recommended if a concern is present. If there are concerning findings, a brain MRI is also recommended, which can further reveal parenchymal injuries and hemorrhages. It is unclear how useful subdural haematoma, retinal hemorrhages, and encephalopathy are alone at making the diagnosis.

===Triad===

While the findings of SBS are complex and many, they are often incorrectly referred to as a &quot;triad&quot; for legal proceedings; distilled down to retinal hemorrhages, subdural hematomas, and encephalopathy. A 2023 review concluded &quot;research has shown the triad is not sufficient to infer shaking or abuse and the shaking hypothesis does not meet the standards of evidence based medicine&quot;.

SBS may be misdiagnosed, underdiagnosed, and overdiagnosed, and caregivers may lie or be unaware of the mechanism of injury. Commonly, there are no externally visible signs of the condition. Examination by an experienced ophthalmologist is critical in diagnosing shaken baby syndrome, as particular forms of ocular bleeding are strongly associated with AHT. Magnetic resonance imaging may also depict retinal hemorrhaging but is much less sensitive than an eye exam. Conditions that are often excluded by clinicians include hydrocephalus, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), seizure disorders, and infectious or congenital diseases like meningitis and metabolic disorders. CT scanning and magnetic resonance imaging are used to diagnose the condition. Conditions that often accompany SBS/AHT include classic patterns of skeletal fracturing (rib fractures, corner fractures), injury to the cervical spine (in the neck), retinal hemorrhage, cerebral bleed or atrophy, hydrocephalus, and papilledema (swelling of the optic disc).

The terms &quot;non-accidental head injury&quot; or &quot;inflicted traumatic brain injury&quot; have been used in place of &quot;abusive head trauma&quot; or &quot;SBS&quot;.

=== Classification ===
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identifies SBS as &quot;an injury to the skull or intracranial contents of an infant or young child (&lt; 5 years of age) due to inflicted blunt impact and/or violent shaking&quot;. In 2009, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended the use of the term &quot;abusive head trauma&quot; (AHT) to replace SBS, in part to differentiate injuries arising solely from shaking and injuries arising from shaking as well as trauma to the head. AHT is a more internationally-recognized term, as it encompasses various mechanisms of injury, such as impact alone or impact due to shaking.

The Crown Prosecution Service for England and Wales recommended in 2011 that the term &quot;shaken baby syndrome&quot; be avoided and the term &quot;non accidental head injury&quot; (NAHI) be used instead.

===Differential diagnosis===

====Vitamin C deficiency====
Some authors have suggested that certain cases of suspected shaken baby syndrome may result from vitamin C deficiency. This contested hypothesis is based upon a speculated marginal, near scorbutic condition or lack of essential nutrient(s) repletion and a potential elevated histamine level. However, symptoms consistent with increased histamine levels, such as low blood pressure and allergic symptoms, are not commonly associated with scurvy as clinically significant vitamin C deficiency. A literature review of this hypothesis in the journal &quot;Pediatrics International&quot; concluded the following: &quot;From the available information in the literature, concluded that there was no convincing evidence to conclude that vitamin C deficiency can be considered to be a cause of shaken baby syndrome.&quot;

The proponents of such hypotheses often question the adequacy of nutrient tissue levels, especially vitamin C, for those children currently or recently ill, bacterial infections, those with higher individual requirements, those with environmental challenges (e.g. allergies), and perhaps transient vaccination-related stresses. At the time of this writing, infantile scurvy in the United States is practically nonexistent. No cases of scurvy mimicking SBS or sudden infant death syndrome have been reported, and scurvy typically occurs later in infancy, rarely causes death or intracranial bleeding, and is accompanied by other changes of the bones and skin and invariably an unusually deficient dietary history.

In one study vaccination was shown not associated with retinal hemorrhages.

==== Vitamin D deficiency ====
Some authors have also suggested that suspected symptoms of SBS may actually be caused by vitamin D deficiency. Infants that are vitamin D deficient during gestation or experience physical impact during delivery may present with a fracture commonly seen in SBS cases.

====Gestational problems====
Gestational problems affecting both mother and fetus, the birthing process, prematurity and nutritional deficits can accelerate skeletal and hemorrhagic pathologies that can also mimic SBS, even before birth.

==Prevention==
Interventions by pediatric practitioners and prenatal providers are recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Educating expecting parents about how to soothe an inconsolable child, as well as the dangers of physical impact to an infant, may reduce rates of SBS. Interventions by neonatal nurses include giving parents information about abusive head trauma, normal infant crying and reasons for crying, teaching how to calm an infant, and how to cope if the infant was inconsolable may reduce also rates of SBS. Educating babysitters, nannies, and other caretakers about SBS and encouraging them to reach out for help with an inconsolable infant may also reduce its rates.

==Treatment==
Treatment involves monitoring intracranial pressure (the pressure within the skull). Treatment occasionally requires surgery, such as to place a cerebral shunt to drain fluid from the cerebral ventricles, and, if an intracranial hematoma is present, to drain the blood collection.

==Prognosis==
Prognosis depends on severity and can range from total recovery to severe disability to death when the injury is severe. One third of patients diagnosed with SBS die, one third survives with a major neurological condition, and only one third survives in good condition; therefore shaken baby syndrome puts children at risk of long-term disability. The most frequent neurological impairments experienced by 70% of SBS survivors are learning disabilities, seizure disorders, speech disabilities, hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy, and visual disorders. Endocrine dysfunction is not uncommon. It is recommended that survivors of SBS be referred to medical homes for continuous follow-up by pediatricians and their healthcare team.

==Disputed validity and legal issues==
The association of diagnosed SBS with deliberate assault is a matter of legal and medical contention, with conflicting opinions as to whether one necessarily implies the other. One of the main contentions is that many medical definitions create a biased picture of the defendants, marking them as the aggressor and implicitly providing a guilty verdict. Simply, this diagnosis blurs the line between diagnosis and verdict.

According to Gabaeff (2018), shaken baby syndrome is an &quot;unproven hypothesis&quot;. Scientific challenges to its validity have been increasing.

A 2017 review concluded that there is insufficient scientific evidence to assess the accuracy of diagnosing traumatic shaking. 

A 2023 academic review by Squier states: &quot;There is insufficient scientific evidence to assume that an infant with the triad of subdural haemorrhage (SDH), retinal haemorrhage, and encephalopathy must have been shaken&quot;, and that &quot;research has shown the triad is not sufficient to infer shaking or abuse and the shaking hypothesis does not meet the standards of evidence based medicine.

While it is widely accepted that physical abuse can lead to SBS, there is debate on if the reverse is true. In other words, can an SBS diagnosis prove that violent, intentional abuse occurred? This debate arises from the difficulty of diagnosing this condition as well as the possibility of non-abuse related causes, such as neglect, an unintentional accident, or even the trauma of birth. 

The concern when combining these two factors is that it allows physicians to provide a definite cause for a condition which can have life-changing legal implications for the person accused of causing it. This is problematic since in many states, such legal sentencing is typically rendered by multidisciplinary child-abuse-prevention teams (physicians, social workers, and law enforcement). 

The President&#x27;s Council of Advisers on Science and Technology (PCAST) noted in its September 2016 report that there are concerns regarding the scientific validity of forensic evidence of abusive head trauma that &quot;require urgent attention&quot;. Similarly, the Maguire model, suggested in 2011 as a potential statistical model for determining the probability that a child&#x27;s trauma was caused by abuse, has been questioned. A proposed clinical prediction rule with high sensitivity and low specificity, to rule out abusive head trauma, has been published.

In July 2005, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales heard four appeals of SBS convictions: one case was dropped, the sentence was reduced for one, and two convictions were upheld. The court found that the classic triad of retinal bleeding, subdural hematoma, and acute encephalopathy are not 100% diagnostic of SBS and that clinical history is also important. In the Court&#x27;s ruling, they upheld the clinical concept of SBS but dismissed one case and reduced another from murder to manslaughter. In their words: &quot;Whilst a strong pointer to NAHI [non-accidental head injury] on its own we do not think it possible to find that it must automatically and necessarily lead to a diagnosis of NAHI. All the circumstances, including the clinical picture, must be taken into account.&quot;

The court did not believe the &quot;unified hypothesis&quot;, proposed by British physician J. F. Geddes and colleagues, as an alternative mechanism for the subdural and retinal bleeding found in suspected cases of SBS. The unified hypothesis proposed that the bleeding was not caused by shearing of subdural and retinal veins but rather by cerebral hypoxia, increased intracranial pressure, and increased pressure in the brain&#x27;s blood vessels. The court reported that &quot;the unified hypothesis [could] no longer be regarded as a credible or alternative cause of the triad of injuries&quot;: subdural haemorrhage, retinal bleeding and encephalopathy due to hypoxemia (low blood oxygen) found in suspected SBS.

On 31 January 2008, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals granted Audrey A. Edmunds a new trial based on &quot;competing credible medical opinions in determining whether there is a reasonable doubt as to Edmunds&#x27;s guilt.&quot; Specifically, the appeals court found that &quot;Edmunds presented evidence that was not discovered until after her conviction, in the form of expert medical testimony, that a significant and legitimate debate in the medical community has developed in the past ten years over whether infants can be fatally injured through shaking alone, whether an infant may suffer head trauma and yet experience a significant lucid interval prior to death, and whether other causes may mimic the symptoms traditionally viewed as indicating shaken baby or shaken impact syndrome.&quot;

In 2012, Norman Guthkelch, the neurosurgeon often credited with &quot;discovering&quot; the diagnosis of SBS, published an article &quot;after 40 years of consideration,&quot; which is harshly critical of shaken baby prosecutions based solely on the triad of injuries. Again, in 2012, Guthkelch stated in an interview, &quot;I think we need to go back to the drawing board and make a more thorough assessment of these fatal cases, and I am going to bet ... that we are going to find in every – or at least the large majority of cases, the child had another severe illness of some sort which was missed until too late.&quot; Furthermore, in 2015, Guthkelch went so far as to say, &quot;I was against defining this thing as a syndrome in the first instance. To go on and say every time you see it, it&#x27;s a crime... It became an easy way to go into jail.&quot;

Teri Covington, who runs the National Center for Child Death Review Policy and Practice, worries that such caution has led to a growing number of cases of child abuse in which the abuser is not punished.

In March 2016, Waney Squier, a paediatric neuropathologist who has served as an expert witness in many shaken baby trials, was struck off the medical register. Squier appealed the tribunal&#x27;s decision to the High Court of England and Wales during October 2016. On 3 November 2016, the court published a judgment which concluded that &quot;the determination of the MPT is in many significant respects flawed&quot;. The judge found that she had committed professional misconduct but was not dishonest. She was reinstated to the medical register but was not allowed to give expert evidence in court for three years.

Squier denied the allegations and appealed the decision to strike her off the medical register. As her case was heard by the High Court of England and Wales in October 2016, an open letter to the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; questioning the decision to strike off Squier, was signed by 350 doctors, scientists, and attorneys. On 3 November 2016, the court published a judgment which concluded that &quot;the determination of the MPT is in many significant respects flawed&quot;. The judge found that she had committed serious professional misconduct but was not dishonest. She was reinstated to the medical register but prohibited from giving expert evidence in court for the next three years.

In 2022, Channel 4 in the UK broadcast a documentary called &quot;The Killer Nanny: Did She Do It?&quot; concerning the Louise Woodward case. In it, civil rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith stated, &quot;shaken baby syndrome is bullshit&quot;.

In 2023, a New Jersey appellate court upheld a lower court&#x27;s decision to bar the inclusion of SBS in two recent child abuse cases. In the decision, several reasons cited. First, there was a split in the pediatrics and biomechanics community over whether shaking alone is sufficient to cause the syndrome. This resulted in expert testimony being dismissed. Additionally, in each case, SBS was difficult to conclude and there was difficulty proving assault otherwise. However, these cases only set precedent for a narrow subsection of cases of SBS where there is no sign of impact to the babies head as well as no other means to demonstrate abuse. There has been pushback against the decision. One such critique expresses that while the court may not have found diagnosis by exclusion to be convincing enough for diagnosis and thus conviction, differential diagnosis is an acceptable diagnostic technique as ruled by other courts. Additionally, other conditions can still be reliably diagnosed without confirmation of the original insult, such as asbestos and sports-related injuries.

Robert Leslie Roberson III, a resident of Texas sentenced to death for the 2002 murder of his daughter, was convicted on the grounds of shaken baby syndrome, and it was ruled by the courts that his arguments of innocence and the invalid theory of shaken baby syndrome was insufficient to overturn his conviction. He was scheduled to be executed on October 17, 2024, which would have made him the first person to face execution for murder related to shaken baby syndrome. However, the Texas Supreme Court granted a stay of execution to allow his testimony before the Texas House Committee on Criminal Jurisprudence.

<text>Bandar-e Anzali () is a city on the Caspian Sea in the Central District of Bandar-e Anzali County, Gilan province, Iran, serving as the capital of both the county and the district.

== History ==
Anzali is an old city in ancient Iran, first settled by the Cadusii. Owing to their pleasant relationship with Cyrus the Great, King of Anshan (Persia), and their military cooperation in Cyrus&#x27;s founding of the Achaemenian Empire, the Cadusii adopted the name &quot;Anshan-e Pars&quot; (&quot;Ανσνάν&quot; in Greek), meaning &quot;the Anshans of Persia&quot;.

This word in Middle Persian is &quot;Anzalag&quot;; a variant Persian form is &quot;Anzalazh&quot;. Anzali Gulf was a safe harbour for trade ships and fishing boats. It was renamed to &quot;Pahlavi&quot; in 1935.

In 1919, with the collapse of General Anton Denikin&#x27;s White Russian army, eighteen of his ships sought refuge in Anzali. On 18 May 1920, a Soviet flotilla of thirteen ships launched a surprise attack on Anzali, capturing the British garrison and the eighteen White Russian ships. This allowed for the establishment of the short-lived Persian Socialist Republic and the Persian Communist Party. Soviet authorities denied responsibility for the attack, blaming the local Russian naval commander for attacking under his own authority.

==Demographics==
===Language===
The people of Anzali speak Gilaki
 and Azerbaijani languages.

The people of Anzali speak Persian as the national language.
Specific Anzali Accent of Western Gilaki language is the main language of Anzali.

Linguistic composition of the city.

===Religion===
The majority of Anzalis are adherents of Shia Islam, although there is a sizeable Armenian Christian minority.

===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city&#x27;s population was 109,687 in 32,424 households. The following census in 2011 counted 116,664 people in 38,128 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 118,564 people in 41,053 households.

==Overview==
Anzali is one of the most important cities in Iran in terms of tourism, economics, and athletics. Bandar-e Anzali is the biggest Gilaki speaking city in the world after Rasht, the capital of Gilan province. The city was home to the first and biggest port on the southern shores of the Caspian Sea. Bandar-e Anzali consists of an island called &quot;Mianposhteh&quot; and the surrounding lands. Tourist attractions include a clock tower called &quot;Manareh&quot;, the long harbour promenade, and the water-logged delta and beach along the Sefid Rud.

Its wonderful lagoon, Customs and City Hall edifice (Shahrdari), Mian Poshte Palace, and Motamedi Edifice are its tourist attractions. Anzali was the site of the Caspian University of Naval Science until 1980, when it was moved to Nowshahr. Naser-al-din Shah&#x27;s Shams-ol-Emareh tower (not to be confused with the Tehran building of the same name) was built by Moayer al Mamalek. The famous Sangi Bath was destroyed by people and natural factors.

The Sangi Bath was noted for its marvelous durable system of basins with heated water. Some groups think that Motamedi Edifice had been changed; it is now its police office. This Ghajar Structure built in two floors with the help of Mirza Abd-ol-Vahab.

==Geography==
The Anzali Lagoon divides the Anzali Port in two parts. The city is connected by two bridges to the &quot;Beheshti Island&quot;. There is a caviar processing factory in Bandar-e Anzali, some old ruins from 19th century and the popular &quot;Shanbeh Bazaar&quot;. &quot;Tourbebar&quot; is a village about 40 kilometers from Bandar-e Anzali, near the Anzali Lagoon.

===Climate===
Bandar-e Anzali has a humid subtropical climate, with (&quot;Cfa&quot;) designation under the Köppen climate classification and (&quot;Cf&quot;) designation under the Trewartha climate classification. The weather is hot and humid in summers and cool, damp and rainy in winters. It has the most humid climate of any city in Iran, similar in its heavy autumn and early winter rainfall, persistent high humidity and low sunshine to the Sea of Japan coast of Japan, though it receives much less summer rainfall than that region. The warm and humid weather has allowed this region to grow crops such as rice and tea that require very large amounts of moisture, especially with the extra water draining from the Elburz Mountains.


== Economy ==
Historically Anzalis were mostly involved in the fish trade. Rice farming and agriculture are the other traditional jobs in Anzali, and are practiced in the villages surrounding the city.

Bandar-e Anzali is a center of caviar production. The preparation and marketing of which is a state monopoly, handled through the Iranian Fishing Company under the control of the Finance Ministry. The public is not admitted to the immense refrigerated hangars where tons of sturgeons, some as large as 3 meters long and weighing 100 kilograms, are stored after the removal of the caviar, usually equivalent to about one tenth of their weight.

<doc id="398946" wikidata="Q156723" url="?curid=398946" title="Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz">
<text>Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (Luise Auguste Wilhelmine Amalie; 10 March 1776 – 19 July 1810) was Queen of Prussia as the wife of King Frederick William III. The couple&#x27;s happy, though short-lived, marriage produced nine children, including the future monarchs Frederick William IV of Prussia and William I, German Emperor.

Her legacy became cemented after her extraordinary 1807 meeting with French Emperor Napoleon I at Tilsit – she met with him to plead unsuccessfully for favorable terms after Prussia&#x27;s disastrous losses in the War of the Fourth Coalition. She was already well loved by her subjects, but her meeting with Napoleon led Louise to become revered as &quot;the soul of national virtue&quot;. Her early death at the age of thirty-four &quot;preserved her youth in the memory of posterity&quot;, and caused Napoleon to reportedly remark that the king &quot;has lost his best minister&quot;. The Order of Louise was founded by her grieving husband four years later as a female counterpart to the Iron Cross. In the 1920s, conservative German women founded the Queen Louise League.

==Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1776–1793)==
Duchess Luise Auguste Wilhelmine Amalie of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (&quot;Louise&quot; in English) was born on 10 March 1776 in a one-storey villa, just outside the capital in Hanover. She was the fourth daughter and sixth child of Duke Charles of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and his wife Princess Friederike of Hesse-Darmstadt. Her father Charles was a brother of Queen Charlotte and her mother Frederike was a granddaughter of Louis VIII, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt. Her maternal grandmother, Princess Maria Louise of Hesse-Darmstadt, and her paternal first-cousin Princess Augusta Sophia of the United Kingdom served as sponsors at her baptism; her second given name came from Princess Augusta Sophia.

At the time of her birth, Louise&#x27;s father was not yet the ruler of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (he would not succeed his brother as duke until 1794), and consequently she was not born in a court, but rather in a less formal home. Charles was field marshal of the household brigade in Hanover, and soon after Louise&#x27;s birth he was made Governor-General of that territory by his brother-in-law George III, Elector of Hanover (husband of his sister, Queen Charlotte). The family subsequently moved to Leineschloss, the residence of Hanoverian kings, though during the summer they usually lived at Herrenhausen.

Louise was particularly close to her sister Frederica, who was two years younger, as well as with their only brother George. Louise and her siblings were under the care of their governess Fräulein von Wolzogen, a friend of their mother&#x27;s. When Louise was only six years old, her mother died in childbirth, leaving a permanent mark on the young duchess; she would often give away pocket change to other children who experienced similar losses, stating &quot;she is like me, she has no mother&quot;. After Duchess Friederike&#x27;s death, the family left Leineschloss for Herrenhausen, sometimes called a &quot;miniature Versailles&quot;. Duke Charles remarried two years later to his first wife&#x27;s younger sister Charlotte, producing a son, Charles. Louise and her aunt and new stepmother became close until Charlotte&#x27;s early death the year after their marriage, also from childbirth complications. The twice widowed and grieving duke went to Darmstadt, where he gave the children into the care of his mother-in-law and Louise&#x27;s grandmother, the widowed Princess Maria Louise.

===Education===
Marie Louise preferred to raise her grandchildren simply, and they made their own clothes. A new governess from Switzerland, Madame Gelieux, was appointed, giving the children lessons in French; as was common for royal and aristocratic children of the time, Louise became fluent and literate in the language, while neglecting her own native German. She received religious instruction from a clergyman of the Lutheran Church. Complementary to her lessons was an emphasis on charitable acts, and Louise would often accompany her governess when visiting the houses of the poor and needy. Louise was encouraged to give out as much as was in her means, although she often got into trouble with her grandmother for donating too much for charity. From the age of ten until her marriage at 17, Louise spent most of her time in the presence of her grandmother and governess, both well-educated and refined. When only nine years old, Louise was present when the poet Friedrich Schiller read from the first act of &quot;Don Carlos&quot; for the entertainment of the assembled court, thus sparking her love for German as a literary language, especially works of Schiller. Louise loved history and poetry, and not only enjoyed reading Schiller, but also came to like the works of Goethe, Paul, Herder and Shakespeare, as well as ancient Greek tragedies.

In 1793, Marie Louise took the two youngest duchesses with her to Frankfurt, where she paid her respects to her nephew King Frederick William II of Prussia. Louise had grown up into a beautiful young woman, possessing &quot;an exquisite complexion&quot; and &quot;large blue eyes,&quot; and was naturally graceful. Louise&#x27;s uncle, the Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, hoped to strengthen ties between his house and Prussia. Consequently, on one evening carefully planned by the duke, seventeen-year-old Louise met the king&#x27;s son and heir, Crown Prince Frederick William. The crown prince was twenty-three, serious-minded, and religious. She made such a charming impression on Frederick William that he immediately made his choice, desiring to marry her. Frederica caught the eye of his younger brother Prince Louis Charles, and the two families began planning a double betrothal, celebrating a month later, on 24 April 1793 in Darmstadt. Frederick and Louise were subsequently married on 24 December that same year, with Louis and Frederica marrying two days later.

==Crown Princess of Prussia (1793–1797)==
In the events leading up to her marriage, Louise&#x27;s arrival in Berlin, the Prussian capital, caused quite a sensation, and she was greeted with a grand reception by the city&#x27;s joyful citizens. When she broke protocol and stopped to pick up and kiss a child, Prussian writer Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué remarked that &quot;The arrival of the angelic Princess spreads over these days a noble splendor. All hearts go out to meet her, and her grace and goodness leaves no one unblessed.&quot; Another wrote &quot;The more perfectly one becomes acquainted with the Princess the more one is captivated by the inner nobility, and the angelic goodness of her heart.&quot;

Louise&#x27;s father-in-law King Frederick William II gave the couple Charlottenburg Palace, but the crown prince and his new wife preferred to live at Paretz Palace, just outside Potsdam, where Louise kept herself busy with household affairs. Paretz was far from the bustle of court, as the couple were most content in the &quot;rural retirement&quot; of a country life. The marriage was happy, and Louise was well-beloved by the king, who called her &quot;the princess of princesses&quot; and gave her Oranienburg Palace. The crown princess saw it as her duty to support her husband in all his pursuits, and the couple enjoyed singing together and reading from Shakespeare and Goethe. Louise soon became pregnant, giving birth to a stillborn girl on 1 October 1794 at the age of eighteen. Nine healthy children would follow in quick succession, though two died in childhood: Crown Prince Frederick William (1795), Prince William (1797), Princess Charlotte (1798), Princess Frederica (1799), Prince Charles (1801), Princess Alexandrine (1803), Prince Ferdinand (1804), Princess Louise (1808), and Prince Albert (1809). The couple also used the Crown Prince&#x27;s Palace in the capital.

Louise&#x27;s charitable giving continued throughout her life, and on one occasion, while attending a harvest festival, she purchased presents and distributed them to local children. On her first birthday after her marriage in Berlin, when King Frederick William II asked his daughter-in-law what she desired for a present, Louise replied she wanted a handful of money to let the city&#x27;s people share her joy; he smilingly gave her a large quantity for the task.

==Queen consort of Prussia (1797–1810)==
On 16 November 1797, her husband succeeded to the throne of Prussia as King Frederick William III after the death of his father. Louise wrote to her grandmother, &quot;I am now queen, and what rejoices me most is the hope that now I need no longer count my benefactions so carefully.&quot; The couple had to abandon their solitude at Paretz and begin living under the restraints of a royal court. They began a tour of the country&#x27;s eastern provinces for two purposes: the king wanted to acquaint himself with their new subjects, and despite the unusualness of a consort accompanying the king further than the capital, Frederick William wanted to introduce the queen as well to their people. Louise was received everywhere with festivities. For the first time in Prussian history, the queen emerged as a celebrated public personality in her own right, as she occupied a much more prominent role than her predecessors. Louise&#x27;s presence on her husband&#x27;s eastern journey was a break from the traditional role of the consort – importantly however the queen&#x27;s power and enduring legacy did not stem from holding a separate court and policy than her husband&#x27;s, but rather the opposite: she subordinated her formidable intelligence and skill for her husband&#x27;s sole advantage. She also became a fashion icon, for instance starting a trend by wearing a neckerchief to keep from getting ill.

After her husband&#x27;s accession, Louise developed many ties to senior ministers and became a powerful figure within the government as she began to command universal respect and affection. The queen went out of her way to stay informed about political developments at court, and from the very beginning of his reign the new king consulted Louise on matters of state. Frederick William was hesitant and cautious, and hated war, stating in 1798, &quot;I abhor war and... know of nothing greater on earth than the preservation of peace and tranquility as the only system suited to the happiness of human kind&quot;. In keeping with the later foreign policy of his father&#x27;s, Frederick William favored neutrality during the early years of the conflict with the revolutionary French First Republic, which evolved into the Napoleonic Wars (1803–15); he refused the various pressures to pick a side in the War of the Second Coalition. Louise supported this view, warning that if Prussia were to side with the coalition powers of Austria, Great Britain, and Russia, it would lead to dependence on the latter power for military support. She foresaw that because Prussia was by far the weakest of the great powers, and it would not have been able to ensure it benefited from the results of such an alliance. French aggression caused the king to eventually consider entering the wars, but his indecision prevented him from choosing a side, either France or the coalition powers. He consulted the many differing opinions of Queen Louise and his ministers, and was eventually compelled into an alliance with Napoleon, who was recently victorious from the Battle of Austerlitz (1805).

Baron vom Stein, a member of the bureaucracy, having abhorred the country&#x27;s former neutrality, sought to reform the organization of the government from favor-based cronyism into a responsible ministerial government. He prepared a document for the king detailing in strong language what administrative reforms were needed, such as establishing clearer lines of responsibility among ministers; this work however never reached Frederick William, as Stein passed it first to General Ernst von Rüchel, who in turn passed it onto the queen in the spring of 1806. Though Louise agreed with its contents, she thought it &quot;too violent and passionate&quot; for the king, and consequently helped suppress it.

===War with France===
Among the king&#x27;s advisers, members of his family, such as the queen (an open advocate of war) and Prince Louis Ferdinand, led the militaristic faction in favor of war against France; those against neutrality but in favor of reform were led by Baron vom Stein and Karl August von Hardenberg. Knowing the temperament of the king, Hardenberg appealed directly to the queen for desired reform – wisely as it turned out, as Frederick William viewed the demands to remove his trusted advisers in the Kabinett as a &quot;mutiny&quot; similar to the &quot;Fronde&quot;.

Though Prussia had not fought in a war since 1795, its military leaders confidently expected that they could win against Napoleon&#x27;s troops. After a small incident concerning an anti-French pamphlet occurred, King Frederick William was finally pressured by his wife and family to break off his uneasy peace and enter the war against the French emperor. The Prussian Army began mobilizing, culminating in the October 1806 Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, which was a disaster for Prussia, as the ability of its armed forces to continue the war were effectively wiped out. The king and queen had accompanied their troops into battle at Jena (with Louise apparently dressed &quot;like an Amazon&quot;), but had to flee from French troops.

Napoleon himself occupied Berlin, causing the king, queen and the rest of the royal family to flee, despite Louise&#x27;s illness, in the dead of winter to Memel in the easternmost part of the kingdom. On the journey there, there was no food or clean water, and the king and queen were forced to share the same sleeping arrangements in &quot;one of the wretched barns they call houses&quot;, according to one witness traveling with them.

After various events took place, Napoleon demanded, from a highly superior position, peace terms in what was to be called the Peace of Tilsit (1807). In the midst of these negotiations, the emperor agreed to keep half of Prussia intact. The men were joined by Queen Louise; Frederick William had sent for his wife, then pregnant with her daughter Princess Louise, to beg for a better settlement for Prussia, with Louise advising her husband, &quot;For God&#x27;s sake no shameful peace...[Prussia] should at least not go down without honor.&quot; As the king felt that her presence might put Napoleon in a &quot;more relaxed mood&quot;; Louise reluctantly agreed to meet the emperor at Tilsit, but only to save Prussia. Napoleon had previously attempted to destroy her reputation by questioning Louise&#x27;s marital fidelity, but the queen met him anyway, attempting to use her beauty and charm to flatter him into more favorable terms. Formerly Louise had regularly referred to him as &quot;the Monster&quot;, but nevertheless made a request for a private interview with the emperor, whereon she threw herself at his feet; though he was impressed by her grace and determination, Napoleon refused to make any concessions, writing back to his wife Empress Joséphine that Louise &quot;is really charming and full of coquettishness toward me. But don&#x27;t be jealous...it would cost me too dearly to play the gallant.&quot; Napoleon&#x27;s attempts to destroy Louise&#x27;s reputation failed however, and they only made her more beloved in Prussia. Queen Louise&#x27;s efforts to protect her adopted country from French aggression secured for her the admiration of future generations.

===Remaining years===
Harsh restrictions were imposed on Prussia, such as a massive indemnity of one hundred and twenty million francs and the quartering of troops. At the time, one hundred and twenty million francs was equivalent to the entire yearly budget of Prussia. As the perceived symbol of Prussia&#x27;s former grandeur and pride, the French occupation of Prussia had a particularly devastating effect upon Louise, as the queen endured personal insults – Napoleon himself gave her a backhanded compliment when he called her &quot;the only real man in Prussia&quot;. The queen recognized that her adopted country depended on her for moral strength, and as a consequence Louise regained her old sense of optimism, often taking time to prepare their eldest son for his future role as king. In the following few years Louise supported the reforming efforts of government carried out by Stein and Hardenberg, as well as those of Gerhard von Scharnhorst and August Neidhardt von Gneisenau, to reorganize the army. After the disaster at Tilsit, Louise was instrumental in Stein&#x27;s reappointment (the king had previously dismissed him), telling Frederick William &quot;[Stein] is my last hope. A great heart, an encompassing mind, perhaps he knows remedies that are hidden to us.&quot;

By 1808 it was still considered unsafe to return to Berlin, and the royal family consequently spent the summer near Königsberg; Louise believed that the hard trials of her children&#x27;s early lives would be good for them: &quot;If they had been reared in luxury and prosperity they might think that so it must always be.&quot; In the winter of 1808, Tsar Alexander I invited the king and queen to St. Petersburg, where she was treated to sumptuously decorated rooms; &quot;Nothing dazzles me anymore&quot;, she exclaimed on her return to Germany. Near the birth of her youngest child Princess Louise in 1809, Louise wrote to her father, &quot;Gladly...the calamities which have befallen us have not forced their way into our wedded and home life, rather have strengthened the same, and made it even more precious to us.&quot; Louise was sick for much of that year, but returned with the king to Berlin near the end of it after an absence of three years; the queen arrived in a carriage accompanied by her two daughters Charlotte and Alexandrine and younger son Charles, and was greeted by her father at Charlottenburg Palace – the residence was ransacked however, as Napoleon and his commanders had stripped its rooms of paintings, statues, manuscripts, and antiquities. Returning to a much different Prussia than she left, a preacher observed that &quot;our dear queen is far from joyful, but her seriousness has a quiet serenity... her eyes have lost their former sparkle, and one sees that they have wept much, and still weep&quot;.

On 19 July 1810, while visiting her father in Strelitz, the queen died in her husband&#x27;s arms from an unidentified illness. Lieutenant-General Baron Marcellin Marbot, in his memoirs, records that the queen in later life always wore a thick wrapping around her neck. It was to conceal a botched operation for goitre, which left an open sore, which eventually killed her. The queen&#x27;s subjects attributed the French occupation as the cause of her early death. &quot;Our saint is in heaven&quot;, exclaimed Prussian general Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher. Louise&#x27;s untimely death left her husband alone during a period of great difficulty, as the Napoleonic Wars and need for reform continued. 
Louise was buried in the garden of Charlottenburg Palace, where a mausoleum, containing a fine recumbent statue by Christian Daniel Rauch, was built over her grave. Frederick William did not remarry until 1824, when he entered into a morganatic marriage with Countess Auguste von Harrach, explaining &quot;Womanly companionship and sympathy have become necessary to me, therefore I must marry again.&quot; After his death on 7 June 1840, Frederick William was buried by her side.
==Legacy==

Queen Louise was revered by her subjects as the &quot;soul of national virtue&quot;, and some historians have written that Louise was &quot;Prussian nationalism personified.&quot; According to Christopher Clark, Louise was &quot;a female celebrity who in the mind of the public combined virtue, modesty, and sovereign grace with kindness and sex appeal, and whose early death in 1810 at the age of only thirty-four preserved her youth in the memory of posterity.&quot; Her reputation as a loving and loyal supporter of her husband became crucial to her enduring legacy; the cult that eventually surrounded Louise became associated with the &quot;ideal&quot; feminine attributes: prettiness, sweet nature, maternal kindness, and wifely virtue.

On the anniversary of her birth, in 1814, the widowed King Frederick William instituted the Order of Louise (&quot;Luisenorden&quot;) as a complementary decoration for the Iron Cross. Its purpose was to be given to those women who had made a significant contribution to the war effort against Napoleon, though it was subsequently awarded to future members of the House of Hohenzollern unrelated to the French emperor, such as her granddaughter-in-law, Empress Victoria of Germany, and her great-granddaughter, Queen Sophia of Greece. In 1880 a statue of Queen Louise was erected in the Tiergarten in Berlin.

Louise inspired the establishment of a conservative women&#x27;s organization known as &quot;Königin-Luise-Bund&quot;, often shortened to &quot;Luisenbund&quot; (&quot;Queen Louise League&quot;) in which her person achieved an almost cult-like status. The group&#x27;s main purpose was to promote patriotic feelings among German women, and it emphasized the family and German morality. The Königin-Luise-Bund was active during the time of the Weimar Republic and the first years of Nazi Germany. Despite having actively supported the National Socialist movement since its early stages all through their accession to power in 1933, the Queen Louise League was nonetheless disbanded by the Nazis in 1934, as they viewed it as a hostile organization.

===Popular culture===

The character of Queen Louise was the popular subject of countless films released in German cinema. These included &quot;Der Film von der Königin Luise&quot; (1913), &quot;Die elf schillschen Offiziere&quot; (1926), and &quot;Vivat – Königin Luise im Fichtelgebirge&quot; (2005), &quot;Luise – Königin der Herzen&quot; (2010 documentary). She was played by Mady Christians in the 1927 silent film &quot;Queen Louise&quot;, by Henny Porten in &quot;Louise, Queen of Prussia&quot; (1931) and by Ruth Leuwerik in the 1957 film &quot;Queen Louise&quot;.

She was also briefly portrayed in an extremely reverential manner in the 1945 propaganda film &quot;Kolberg&quot;. The 1951 film &quot;The African Queen&quot; involves a British covert mission to sink the &quot;Königin Luise&quot; (&quot;Queen Louise&quot;), a German warship patrolling Lake Victoria at the start of World War I.

Louise became the subject of a series of novels by 19th century German historical fiction writer Luise Mühlbach, which included &quot;Louisa of Prussia and her Times&quot; and &quot;Napoleon and the Queen of Prussia&quot;.

==Issue==

<doc id="398950" wikidata="Q5377873" url="?curid=398950" title="Engineering and Research Corporation">
<text>Engineering and Research Corporation (ERCO) was started by Henry Berliner in 1930. Berliner was the son of Emile Berliner, who had patented numerous inventions relating to sound and acoustics, and pioneer of helicopter development with the experimental Berliner Helicopter.

The younger Berliner founded ERCO to produce tools for the manufacture of metal aircraft and propellers. He founded the company in a shed at 2014 5th Street NW Washington D.C. Berliner met Fred Weick, an aeronautical engineer, who worked with National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics in cowlings and propellers on a 1926 while developing the propellers for the USS Akron. Weick also worked on an experimental aircraft that incorporated the up-to-date safety features.

In 1935, the company moved to 6100 Sligo Blvd.

In 1936, Weick left NACA to work for ERCO on his &quot;safety airplane&quot;. In 1937, Berliner purchased 50 acres of land in Riverdale, Maryland near the College Park Airport and built the large ERCO factory and airstrip. One of ERCO&#x27;s most significant achievements was the development of the Ercoupe aircraft.

The first experimental model of the Ercoupe was test-flown at College Park airport in 1937. It had a single tail (unlike the eventual production Ercoupes, with their characteristic twin tails) and was known as the &quot;Jeep&quot;. In late 1938, ERCO searched unsuccessfully for a suitable engine for its new airplane. ERCO hired Harold Morehouse, former engineer in charge of small engine design at Continental Motors, to design a new engine. He came up with the inverted, in-line I-L 116, which provided good pilot visibility and enhanced aircraft streamlining. ERCO installed the I-L 116 in the prototype Ercoupe Model 310 in 1939. The engine performed well, but ERCO discontinued it when Continental introduced the A-65 engine in 1940, which generated comparable horsepower at half the cost. Construction of the production prototype was completed in 1939, and certification by the CAA was completed in 1940. The first Ercoupe, serial No. 1, was owned by George Brinckerhoff, the operator of the College Park Airport, and flown there. It now is at the National Air and Space Museum.

During World War II, the ERCO factory made several products under contract with the U.S. government, including gun turrets. ERCO earned an &quot;E&quot; award for excellence in meeting manufacturing goals in its war contracts.

In 1947, Berliner decided to leave the aviation industry and sold the drawings, tools, parts, materials and distribution rights for the Ercoupe to Sanders Aviation, although the small aircraft market had fallen into decline.

In all, ERCO and Sanders Aviation sold just over 5,000 Ercoupes.

In 1948, ERCO started producing aircraft simulators, becoming its main line of business. In November 1954, ERCO became part of ACF.

<text>Civil Force () is a pro-Beijing, district-based political party in Hong Kong. Since 2014, the Civil Force has entered an alliance with the New People&#x27;s Party of Regina Ip. Headed by chairman Pun Kwok-shan, it had its stronghold in the Sha Tin and Sai Kung Districts and had once the majority of seats in the Sha Tin District Council until its total defeat in 2019.

==History==
It was established in 1993 by a former member of United Democrats of Hong Kong, Lau Kong-wah and 8 other Sha Tin District Board members.

Lau was defeated by Emily Lau in both the 1991 LegCo elections and the 1995 LegCo elections. In 1996, Lau secured a seat in the Provisional Legislative Council. He was elected into LegCo in since 1998 LegCo elections in the New Territories East geographical constituency, after he joined the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB).

In 2003, due to the pro-government stance of DAB especially on the issue of implementing Article 23 of the Basic Law, the popularity of Lau, being a member of the DAB, was affected, and the Civil Force performed not as well in the 2003 District Council elections. Campaigns of some of the members emphasise more on the banner of Civil Force and their local contributions, and did not mention the convenor&#x27;s connection with the DAB. Lau himself lost the seat in the Kam To constituency for the Sha Tin District Council despite his long service in the district. The Civil Force retained 14 seats in the Sha Tin District Council, and 3 seats in the Sai Kung District Council.

In the 2012 Legislative Council election, Lau Kong-wah lost in the District Council (Second) functional constituency election while the newly joined member Scarlett Pong failed to win a seat in the New Territories East constituency. Civil Force had not been represented in the Legislative Council for the first time. It returned to the legislature with one seat when LegCo member Lam Tai-fai joined the Civil Force on 1 January 2013.

The Civil Force formed a political alliance with the New People&#x27;s Party (NPP), headed by Regina Ip, in February 2014. Civil Force leader Pun Kwok-shan was appointed Vice-Chairman of the New People&#x27;s Party, while members of either parties can acquire membership of the other party. The alliance fielded 23 candidates to contest the 2015 District Council elections and won 11 seats. Some Civil Force district councilors withdrew from NPP to avoid the political impact.

Eunice Yung won a seat for Civil Force and NPP in the 2016 Legislative Council election in New Territories East.

In 2019, amidst the ongoing social movement against the extradition bill, the pro-Beijing camp suffered unprecedented defeat in the District Council elections. The NPP-Civil Force alliance fielded 28 candidates but did not win any seats. As a result, Civil Force was eliminated from all the district councils for the first time since its establishment.

<text>==WWII and the Boeing era: 1945–1970==
From World War II until 1970, Seattle underwent what amounted to a long, sustained economic boom, although not without occasional reverses. Boeing was hiring, the economy was booming, and while there had been no successful regional planning, the city had not yet grown quite large enough.

The Boeing airplane company grew out of the fortune of William &quot;Bill&quot; Boeing&#x27;s boat company and his fascination with airplanes and flying. In 1917, before American entry into World War I, Boeing employed only 28 people, but when the war orders started coming in, Boeing grew to &quot;an enterprising firm with the one customer airplane builders had in those days, the federal government. Employing about four thousand people, with sales just under ten million dollars a year, it was a good if unspectacular business for Seattle.&quot; The company struggled through the period between the wars, and &quot;began to build dressers, counters and furniture for a corset company and a confectioner&#x27;s shop, as well as flat-bottomed boats called sea sleds.&quot; However, when World War II started, the government suddenly desired tens of thousands of planes a year, and Boeing was positioned to provide them. Working under fixed-fee contracts, Boeing churned out airplanes and became by far the largest employer in Seattle.
However, Boeing spawned few local spin-off industries; only 5% of the subcontracted work was in the Puget Sound. Boeing was, by intention, a place where engineers designed the planes and line workers assembled parts that were imported from all over the world. Ostensibly, this would reduce the dependency of Seattle&#x27;s economy on the fortunes of the airline business. The problem was that Seattle was still dependent on the airline business, without enjoying any of the spin-off industries that might have diversified the economy. When the war ended, &quot;the military canceled its bomber orders; Boeing factories shut down and 70,000 people lost their jobs,&quot; and initially it appeared that Seattle had little to show for the wartime Boeing boom. While the war was on, almost all production went either towards Boeing factories or Boeing planes. After the war, the crash ensured that no one would have much money for new local development.

This period of stagnation soon ended with the rise of the jet airplane and Boeing&#x27;s reincarnation as the world&#x27;s leading producer of commercial passenger planes. With the Boeing 707-120, Seattle became Boeing&#x27;s company town; &quot;in 1947 Boeing employed about one out of every five of King County&#x27;s manufacturing workers, in 1957 about every other one.&quot; As Boeing boomed, so did Seattle. From 1940 to 1950, the population increased 99,289 or 27% from 368,302 to 467,591. From 1950 to 1960, the population increased 89,496 or 20% to 557,087. All of those people had to live somewhere, and the Fifties saw a huge housing boom. Population density all over Seattle exploded as people filled the boundaries of settlement in the city and began to move north. Most of the development was in single-family houses, since land was plentiful.
At the same time, the freeways were being built to compensate for all this new growth. The community of Mercer Island, the &quot;Eastside&quot; (east of Lake Washington) communities of Bryn Mawr, Newport, Bellevue, Clyde Hill, Hunts Point, Medina, Juanita, and the northern suburbs of Kenmore, Lake Forest Park, and Lake Hills all came into being during the Boeing boom. Interstate 5 (I-5) cut the city in half on a north–south axis, while I-90 crossed east–west, connecting with Mercer Island via the floating Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge. SR 520 skirted the north end of Montlake just south of the Montlake Cut, and paralleled I-90 with its own floating bridge. I-5 neatly cut off Downtown Seattle from Capitol Hill, First Hill, and even from part of the historic downtown, including the Tony Sorrento Hotel, which was left stranded on the &quot;wrong&quot; side of the freeway. I-90 was perhaps less disruptive (unless, of course, you were living in its path), since it is partly routed through a tunnel and skirts a more-or-less unbuildable edge of Beacon Hill, avoiding slicing the city into north and south halves. Freeway Park was eventually built over I-5 in 1976, restoring something of a link between Downtown and First Hill, but was not heavily enough used to provide much mitigation. The R.H. Thompson Expressway, planned to connect SR 520 with I-90 and SR 167 via the Central District, and the Bay Freeway, connecting I-5 with the Seattle Center via Mercer Street, were canceled by citizen referendums as part of nationwide freeway revolts.

With all this postwar growth came growing pollution of the lakes and rivers that provided much of the beauty that had been Seattle&#x27;s appeal to its recent immigrants. Also, the sprawl constantly demanded more roads, since the ones already built had terrible traffic. (Naturally, new roads simply led to new development and were soon as snarled as those they were intended to relieve.) A group of Seattle natives, anxious to preserve the city in which they grew up, came together to institute the Metropolitan Problems Committee, or METRO, intended to manage and plan the metropolitan area. The driving force behind this movement was Jim Ellis, who headed the committee and repeatedly brought the planning issue before the voters and city governments. The logic was that a regional transit system would require a regional political body; the same held for regional sewage and pollution control or regional growth planning. The original, comprehensive METRO regional plan was defeated in a vote by suburbanites who seemed to view the problem not as one of pollution, transit, sprawl, or lack of planning: in what some Seattleites referred to as the &quot;Pave the Lake&quot; strategy, they just wanted more bridges across Lake Washington.

METRO came back, scaled down to a sewage treatment and transport organization, and prevailed with an overwhelming majority in Seattle and a decent showing in the suburbs. METRO, despite repeated attempts by Jim Ellis, never did manage to get authority for planning, and to this day there is no single body responsible for planning the Seattle metropolitan area and its transportation systems. (METRO was eventually merged into the King County government.) Seattle and King County have, at times, seemed better at coming up with money for stadiums and other large public works than for broader projects.

During this period, Seattle&#x27;s downtown was in decline (as were many other downtowns across the nation, for much the same reason): people shopped in the suburbs, not in the city. The market for goods in the city&#x27;s center was drying up. Seattle&#x27;s solution was to host the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World&#x27;s Fair. The area directly north of downtown was slumping very badly—some of it to the point of being known as the &quot;Warren Avenue slum&quot;—and the city owned a lot of property almost adjacent to that &quot;slum&quot;. The fair, given a futuristic science theme, was designed to leave behind a civic center, now known as Seattle Center, containing arts buildings, a food court, museums, and the like and serving also as a fairground. The United States Science Pavilion (now the Pacific Science Center) was one of the central attractions. Boeing performed one of its few altruistic public actions: they &quot;created and installed in the United States Science Pavilion a space age Spacearium, a permanent addition to the center and one of the most attractive features of the fair.&quot;
In conjunction with the fair, a demonstration monorail line was constructed, running from the center of downtown to the fair, a distance of 0.9 miles; it was constructed at no cost to the city and was paid for out of ticket sales, and then turned over to the city for $600,000. &quot;(See Seattle Center Monorail).&quot; It is currently the only monorail in the United States to turn a profit. It is now almost exclusively a tourist attraction, as the distance covered is too small to be of much practical use unless you are living in a hotel downtown and visiting the Seattle Center. The World&#x27;s Fair also granted Seattle the landmark Space Needle, also a continuing tourist attraction. Seattle also acquired an Opera House, a Coliseum, and a refurbished Arena (all of which have since been replaced or significantly remodeled), and a great location for future carnivals and fairs. Today, Seattle Center is host to the Bite of Seattle, Bumbershoot, a music and art festival that draws crowds in the hundreds of thousands every Labor Day Weekend, Northwest Folklife Festival on Memorial Day Weekend, a comparably large folk music and folk culture festival, which somehow manages to stay in the black despite being free to all comers, and PrideFest, a finali of the much larger event Seattle Gay Pride Parade like many other cities every year in late June in honor of the 1969 Stonewall Riots proudly flying the pride flag atop the Space Needle for the first time in 2010. The Pacific Science Center continues to draw crowds, along with a small amusement park that operates all summer – *Needs updating, amusement park removed years ago as part of the Experience Music Project (now Mo-Pop, Musium of Pop Culture) construction on the site. The World&#x27;s Fair arguably reenergized the downtown of Seattle, and was generally a smashing success, even finishing with a profit.

After the war, the University of Washington also took a step forward, finally fulfilling the promise of its name. Charles Odegaard, as president of the University, used his office to press for the creation of community colleges and other four-year colleges in Washington, so that the University of Washington could concentrate on research. By the time Odegaard retired, the UW was second only to MIT in the size of its federal grants, and the number of students attending had swelled. Because the University of Washington campus is open, its impact on the University District as well as the rest of the city was quite significant; &quot;In remaining a largely commuter school, the university has diminished its ability to withdraw as a community in itself and has maintained thereby its ability to the larger and more amorphous community.&quot;

==Counterculture==
Starting in the late 1950s, Seattle was one of the centers of the emergence of the American counterculture and culture of protest. Before grunge there were beats, fringies (a local Seattle term), hippies, and batcavers. Opened in 1967, one counterculture haven in Seattle was the Last Exit on Brooklyn coffeehouse located near the University of Washington. At the University itself, Parrington Lawn became known as &quot;Hippie Hill&quot;, due in part to UW President Charles Odegaard&#x27;s &quot;outstandingly tolerant attitude toward the hippie element on and near his jurisdiction&#x27;s campus, as well as his ongoing refusal to allow Seattle city police onto UW property.&quot;

The Seattle counterculture played a role in early urban environmentalism. In the early 1970s, the Northwest Tilth Association promoted alternative modes of production and consumption of food, laying the foundation for an organic food economy in the Pacific Northwest region.

==Political emergence of non-white minorities==
Despite Seattle being one of the &quot;whitest&quot; major cities in the United States, it has had an African-American mayor (Norm Rice), at least four African-American city council members, and at least half a dozen Asian-American city council members including Wing Luke, the first Asian American elected to public office in Washington (in 1962). It has also been the political base for figures such as former King County Executives Gary Locke—who went on to be the first Chinese-American governor of a U.S. state—and Ron Sims, an African American who went on to become the Deputy Secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. After World War II, many African-Americans moved into the Central District. This neighborhood began to gentrify in the 1990s and today, the city&#x27;s African American population is more focused on the South End of the city.

==Boeing bust: 1970–1985==
Due to changing external demand and the cancellation of the SST program, &quot;the Boeing workforce was cut from 80,400 to 37,200 between early 1970 and October 1971&quot;. After 1973, Seattle was in good company for its recession, since the rest of the country was also experiencing the energy crisis. However, Seattle was hit harder than most cities due to its over-reliance on Boeing as an employer, and had the worst post-Depression unemployment for any major US city, nearly 12%. As with most periods of downturn, there was not much private investment or construction. However, despite the crushing unemployment and the infamous billboard saying &quot;Will the last person leaving Seattle – Turn out the lights,&quot; the outflux of people was &quot;never more than 15% of those laid off,&quot; and was promptly countered by new arrivals taking advantage of the now-underpriced housing stock.

Quite likely, Seattle evaded the fate of Detroit through being a port city with a large number of highly educated, skilled workers. Seattle industry did slightly better than the national average during the rest of the 1970s; nonetheless the boom decades of the 1950s and 1960s had been brought to a decisive end.
The Pike Place Market, arguably Seattle&#x27;s most significant tourist attraction, gained its modern form in the aftermath of the Boeing crash. The market had been founded in 1907 with a great deal of early success, but, like most public markets in America, had suffered a decline as corporations took over food distribution. The deportation of the Japanese from Seattle during World War II hit the market particularly hard, since 80% of its &quot;wet stall&quot; vendors had been ethnically Japanese. The city council wanted to make a &quot;Pike Place Plaza&quot; by demolishing the mostly derelict market and replacing it with &quot;a new hotel, a 32-story apartment building, four 28-story office buildings, a hockey arena, and a 4,000-car parking garage.&quot; A &quot;Keep the Market&quot; initiative, led by architect Victor Steinbrueck, was passed in 1971, pushing for adaptive reuse. A promotional committee was created, historical district status attained, and vendors were convinced to move in and sell wares. The project was wildly successful, and today the Pike Place Market pulls nine million visitors each year.

A similar story occurred with Pioneer Square. An old neighborhood, largely built after the Great Seattle Fire, it had fallen into derelict status after the war. However, with a reenergized downtown, businesses started to look for buildings that could be acquired cheaply. When offices moved into renovated buildings, suddenly there was a market for facilities to service them, leading to a &quot;flood of other restaurants, galleries, boutiques.&quot; Seattle was definitely recovering from the blow dealt by the Boeing recession, refilling areas that had threatened to become slums.

==Silicon Forest: 1985–present==

Bill Gates and Paul Allen, founders of Microsoft Corporation, attended the Lakeside School, a private middle and high school in Haller Lake, at the northern Seattle city limits. This turned out to have rather dramatic consequences for the entire Seattle area. Microsoft&#x27;s first product, Microsoft BASIC, came out in 1976. The company was incorporated in New Mexico the same year. By 1978 sales exceeded one million dollars a year. In 1979, Microsoft moved its offices back to Redmond from Albuquerque, New Mexico—they had gone to New Mexico to be near a client who no longer dominated their business, Gates and Allen wanted to go back where they were from, and it was easier to entice quality programmers to the Seattle area than the deserts of New Mexico. By 1985, sales were over $140 million, by 1990, $1.18 billion, and by 1995, Microsoft was the world&#x27;s most profitable corporation, Allen and Gates were billionaires, and literally thousands of their past and present employees were millionaires. Microsoft had grown from a two-man operation to a company with 11,000 employees in 1992 and 48,030 (about half of them in the Seattle area) in 2001.

Microsoft spawned a host of other companies in the Seattle area: millionaire employees often left to found their own companies, and Allen, after his own departure from Microsoft, became a major investor in new companies. Seattle-area companies that owe their origins at least indirectly to Microsoft include RealNetworks, Attachmate, InfoSpace, and a host of others. Quite unlike Boeing, Microsoft has served as a catalyst for the creation of a whole realm of industry. Microsoft has also taken a much more active hand than Boeing in public works in the area, donating software to many schools (including the University of Washington).

During this era, Seattle has also experienced quite good growth in the biotechnology and coffee sectors, and Seattle-based Nordstrom became a national brand.

Paul Allen, whose fortune was made through Microsoft though he has long since ceased to be an active participant in the company, has been a major force in Seattle politics. He attempted a voter initiative to build the Seattle Commons, a huge park in South Lake Union and the Cascade District, and even offered to put up his own money to endow a security force for the park, but it was defeated at the polls. (Allen is now the leader of the movement to redevelop this same area as a biotech center.) He did get a football stadium for the Seattle Seahawks through a successful statewide ballot initiative, and founded the Experience Music Project (originally intended as a Jimi Hendrix museum) on the grounds of Seattle Center.

One other piece of urban design in this era is the Washington State Convention and Trade Center, completed in 1988 and expanded in 2003, which bridges the freeway and adjoins Freeway Park, connecting First Hill to downtown. Arguably, the convention center has helped fuel further downtown growth and has (at least to some extent) reconnected both sides of the freeway. Paralleling the Microsoft and Internet boom, Downtown Seattle underwent a revival; at the height of the boom, downtown office space was described as &quot;Number four or five on the national hit parade [of real estate prices], and climbing.&quot; After an increase in vacancy to double-digit levels in the Internet Bust, occupancy began to return. The return of the downtown retail district appears to be a more lasting phenomenon, although at the expense of having a retail district dominated by national chain stores, many of them gathered in mall complexes. The growth of the tech industry such as Amazon and its expansion to the downtown area also resulted in a record level construction boom following the Great Recession, with a total of 68 major projects underway from Sodo to South Lake Union at the end of 2016, the most since 2005. Much of the development was residential which comprise up to 2/3 of all projects, most of which were centered at South Lake Union. As a result, twice as many apartments in Seattle opened in 2017 than any other year in the city&#x27;s history. The pace of development is expected to increase slightly until 2019.

==N30==

Seattle&#x27;s bid for the world stage by hosting the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 did not play out as planned. Instead, the city became the site of the first great street confrontation between the anti-globalization movement and the World Trade Organization on November 30, 1999. While many of those in the streets, and most of those in the suites, were from out of town or even out of country, much of the groundwork of Seattle hosting both the event and the protests against it can be attributed to local forces.


==Music==

Seattle has long had a rich musical heritage, as many of rock&#x27;s top names since the &#x27;60s have hailed from the area.
In the mid-20th century the thriving jazz scene in the city&#x27;s Skid Road and Central Districts launched the careers of musicians including Ray Charles and Quincy Jones. Both Jones and, later, Jimi Hendrix attended Garfield High School, and in the &#x27;60s, such garage rock/proto punk bands as the Sonics and the Wailers emerged, and in the &#x27;70s, Heart. The &#x27;80s saw such Seattle heavy metal acts as Queensrÿche and Metal Church gain popularity, while Seattle native Duff McKagan went on to massive success with Guns N&#x27; Roses after relocating to Los Angeles. But it was perhaps the early &#x27;90s grunge movement for which Seattle is best known from a musical perspective. During this time such acts as Mother Love Bone, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Temple of the Dog, Alice in Chains, and Mudhoney scored massive worldwide hits, and turned the musical tide from glam metal to a style that borrowed equally from garage rockers (the Sonics), punk (the Stooges), and &#x27;70s heavy metal (Black Sabbath).

==Environmental sustainability==
In 1971, Weldon Robison along with Ron Ralph established a community based non-profit glass recycling effort in the Eastlake Community of Seattle. It was simply called &quot;The Glass Barrel&quot; and was registered and incorporated as a non-profit enterprise with the City of Seattle. Three sites were established on Fairview Ave East and one above the houseboats on Portage Bay. Glass was separated in three colors and deposited in three separate oil drums.

Seattle was voted the United States&#x27; most &quot;green&quot; city by the NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council), which gave the following reasons for the designation (among others):

# Seattle mayor Greg Nickels founded the United States Conference of Mayors&#x27; Climate Agreement in 2005. Since then over 900 cities have signed on. The charter of the Agreement is to reduce the environmental impact of U.S. cities on the environment and meet the Kyoto environmental protocols, sidestepping the Bush administration&#x27;s refusal to sign on.
# Over 90% of the city&#x27;s electric demand is fed by hydroelectric power.
# Comprehensive recycling and sustainable resource use practices.
# The most successful car- and van-pool program in the country.
# Expansion of the city&#x27;s light rail system.

The city&#x27;s populace is also environmentally conscious, stemming from the natural beauty and landscape surrounding the area. Land use policies and natural geography have led to an increase in property value as the aforementioned boom in population with the arrival of Microsoft, new business for Boeing, and the foundation of Starbucks as a global corporation, has put a strain on availability of single family home property.

<text>History of Seattle, Washington 1900–1940: Seattle experienced rapid growth and transformation in the early 20th century, establishing itself as a leader in the Pacific Northwest. The Klondike Gold Rush led to massive immigration, diversifying the city&#x27;s ethnic mix with arrivals of Japanese, Filipinos, Europeans, and European-Americans. The city expanded geographically through annexations and ambitious regrade projects, most notably the Denny Regrade which leveled more than 120 feet of Denny Hill. Major infrastructure projects shaped the city, including the construction of the Lake Washington Ship Canal and the development of an extensive park system designed by the Olmsted Brothers. The Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition of 1909 celebrated the city&#x27;s rise, while the completion of Smith Tower in 1914 gave Seattle the tallest building west of the Mississippi River.

The interwar period brought significant challenges to Seattle. World War I initially boomed the economy, particularly in shipbuilding and lumber, but the city faced a sharp downturn when the war ended. The Seattle General Strike of 1919 marked a period of labor unrest, and the city was hit hard by the Great Depression. Despite economic difficulties, Seattle developed as an arts center during this time. The Frye Art Museum and Henry Art Gallery were established, and artists like Mark Tobey and Morris Graves gained national recognition. The Prohibition era saw a thriving speakeasy scene, and by mid-century, Seattle&#x27;s Jackson Street jazz scene would launch the careers of musicians including Ray Charles and Quincy Jones. Despite the challenges, the city maintained its character, with affordable housing and extensive parks making it an attractive place to live for those who remained employed.

==Leader of the Northwest: 1900 to 1915==

The gold rush &quot;(see History of Seattle before 1900)&quot; led to massive immigration, with major arrivals of Japanese, Filipinos, immigrant Europeans, and European-Americans from back east. The arrival of Greeks and Sephardic Jews broadened the city&#x27;s ethnic mix.

Many of Seattle&#x27;s neighborhoods got their start around this time. At first, the city grew mainly along the water to the north and south of downtown to avoid steep grades. However, the new rich soon developed the land on First Hill that overlooks downtown &quot;because it was close to downtown without being a part of it, and because it occupied a commanding position.&quot;

Downtown Seattle was bustling with activity; as quickly as previous inhabitants moved out to newly created neighborhoods, new immigrants came in to take their place in the city core. There was an enormous apartment boom in the years after 1905. A 1905 city directory lists only 19 apartment buildings. The 1911 directory has twelve columns of such listings.

The last great manhunt of the Wild West was the search for Harry Tracy in Seattle in 1902.

In 1908, the Great White Fleet visited Seattle and the US West Coast, &quot;to demonstrate to the world America&#x27;s naval prowess.

Construction on the Smith Tower was completed in 1914. It was the tallest building west of the Mississippi River from its completion in 1914 until the Space Needle overtook it in 1962. It remained the tallest office building west of the Mississippi River until the Humble Building (now Exxon Building) was built in 1963.

Following the vision of city engineer R.H. Thomson, who had already played a key role in the development of municipal utilities, a massive effort was made to level the extreme hills that rose south and north of the bustling city. From 1900 to 1914 the Denny Regrade to the north and the Jackson Regrade to the south leveled more than of Denny Hill and parts of First and Beacon Hills. The Denny Regrade continued in spurts until 1930. Dirt from the Jackson Regrade filled in the swampy tidelands that are now occupied by the SoDo neighborhood as well as Safeco Field and Qwest Field. A seawall containing dirt from the Denny Regrade created the current waterfront. More dirt from the Denny Regrade went to build the industrial Harbor Island at the mouth of the Duwamish River, south of Downtown. 

The Denny Regrade wasn&#x27;t the only radical reshaping of Seattle&#x27;s topography in this period. The 1911–1917 construction of the Lake Washington Ship Canal included two major &quot;cuts&quot; (the Montlake Cut and the Fremont Cut, four bascule bridges, and the Government Locks (now Hiram M. Chittenden Locks). The level of Lake Washington dropped; the Black River, which formerly ran out of the south end of the lake, dried up completely, and Seward Island became the Seward Peninsula, now the site of Seward Park.

After the obvious geographical expansion from downtown, &quot;other neighborhoods… [came]… into existence… [as]… the result of streetcar lines moving north and east from downtown and providing opportunities for settling that were obviously attractive to all but the poorest.&quot; Several lines, running to most of central Seattle&#x27;s modern neighborhoods, created the communities of Capitol Hill, Queen Anne, Madrona, Madison Park, and Leschi. All of the expansion was happening without zoning, leading to &quot;different land uses and economic classes everywhere [being] mixed.&quot;

Seattle also grew by annexation in this period, annexing areas including the previously separately incorporated Columbia City, Ballard, South Park, and West Seattle in 1907 and Georgetown in 1910.

At the same time as the city was expanding dramatically, the city planners began to put in parks. &quot;Four million dollars worth of bonds were sold between 1905 and 1912 to develop the parks and build the boulevards designed by the Olmsteds to connect them.&quot; Almost all of Seattle&#x27;s large parks were constructed during this period: Woodland Park (which includes the Woodland Park Zoo), Volunteer Park, Green Lake, Washington Park (now the site of the University of Washington Arboretum), Ravenna Park, Leschi Park, Seward Park. The Olmsted plan for boulevards was carried out nearly in full. The form of the plan was &quot;a winding parkway of about which would link most of the existing and planned parks and greenbelts within the city limits.&quot; Then, as now, no main park or particular area of Seattle that stood out above the rest. Much of the ambiance of Seattle derives from the fact that whole of the city (with the notable exception of the industrial area in the center of the city, south of downtown, and extending to South Park and Boeing Field; and to a lesser extent, downtown itself) is filled with small parks, hills, and lakes.

Where there had so recently been wilderness, increasingly there was the reality of a major city. The Seattle Symphony was founded in 1903, and while few, if any, other comparably important arts institutions were established, the story was different in more popular entertainments. Vaudeville impresarios Alexander Pantages, John Considine, and John Cort (the last also involved in legitimate theater) were all based in Seattle in this era.

Seattle trumpeted and celebrated its rise with the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition of 1909, but the city&#x27;s rapid growth had led to much questioning of the social order. Not only the labor left, but also progressives calling for &quot;good government&quot; challenged the hegemony of the captains of industry. Rail baron James J. Hill, addressing Seattle business leaders in 1909, noted and regretted the change. &quot;Where,&quot; he asked, &quot;are the man who used to match your mountains…?&quot;

==World War I and the Bogue Plan: 1914–1920==
In 1910, Seattle voters approved a referendum to create a development plan for the whole city. However, the result, known as the Bogue plan, was never to be implemented.

Virgil Bogue had worked for Olmsted and was intimately familiar with the land in Seattle. The Bogue plan had at its heart a grand civic center in Belltown and the Denny Regrade connected to the rest of the city by a rapid transit rail system, with a huge expansion of the park system, crowned by the total conversion of Mercer Island into parkland. Striking in Bogue&#x27;s plan is his grasp of the consequences of growth; he foresaw that the city&#x27;s residents would eventually number in the millions and that such a grand park or efficient transit system could put in place early in the development at much lower cost.

However, the Bogue plan was defeated by an alliance of fiscal conservatives who opposed such a grandiose plan on general principles and populists who argued that the plan would mainly benefit the rich: for example, the proposed massive Mercer Island park could, at that time, only be reached by boat. The Bogue plan sat on the shelf, never to be used. Ultimately, a few of the sites proposed for public parks were developed as such; more became private golf courses and such. The rail system was never built, and Mercer Island is now an upper middle class suburb, connected to the city by an Interstate Highway floating bridge.

At the same time as the government stopped investing for the future, private enterprise also began to stiffen. The war hid this, because it &quot;boomed and expanded Seattle&#x27;s economy phenomenally, but in false ways.&quot; The growth in the size of the economy was unprecedented, increasing nearly tenfold. However, it was almost all in wartime shipbuilding and lumber, and there was very little growth in new industries.

==Seattle between the Wars==
When the war ended, so did Seattle&#x27;s prosperity. Economic output crashed as the government stopped buying boats, and there were no new industries to pick up the slack. Seattle stopped being a place of explosive growth and opportunity. Western Washington was a center of radical labor agitation. Most dramatically, a general strike occurred in 1919. The Industrial Workers of the World played a prominent role in the strike. After surviving the general strike, Seattle mayor Ole Hanson became a prominent figure in the First Red Scare, and made an unsuccessful attempt to ride that backlash to the White House in an unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination for the presidential election of 1920.

Things picked up in the late 1920s, but then came the Great Depression. Times were rough all over the country, but Seattle was hit particularly hard because the manufacturing industries had been crowded out by the war. For example, Seattle issued 2,538 permits for housing construction in 1930, but only 361 in 1932.

Seattle saw some of the country&#x27;s harshest labor strife of the Depression. During the Maritime Strike of 1934, striking longshoremen faced off with police and strikebreakers in a series of daily skirmishes that became known as &quot;The Battle of Smith Cove&quot;. As a result of the violence of the strike, Seattle lost much of its maritime traffic to the Port of Los Angeles. This was followed by the temporary ascendancy of the New Order of Cincinnatus, a &quot;conservative and moralistic reform group&quot; that challenged both the Democratic and Republican parties, and was widely accused of &quot;fascist&quot; or &quot;proto-fascist&quot; tendencies.

Despite this, and despite enormous police corruption, Roger Sale argues that the Seattle between the wars was a pretty nice place to live, especially to grow up in. The city was still full of single-family wood houses and parks from the Olmstead development, but because of the crash they were affordable—at least to those who still had jobs. Seattle between the wars, writes Sale &quot;is what suburbs try to be, but never achieve because they cannot stand things so jammed together, all for a family whose income could be well under two thousand dollars a year.&quot; Seattle settled down into a kind of stasis between the wars, as growth subsided while those who lived in the city stayed.

Although no longer the economic powerhouse it had been around the start of the 20th century, it was in the 1920s that Seattle first began seriously to be an arts center. The Frye and Henry families put on public display the collections that would become the core of the Frye Art Museum and Henry Art Gallery, respectively. Nellie Cornish had established the Cornish School (now Cornish College of the Arts) in 1914. Australian painter Ambrose Patterson arrived in 1919; over the next few decades Mark Tobey, Morris Graves, Kenneth Callahan, Guy Irving Anderson, and Paul Horiuchi would establish themselves as nationally and internationally known artists. Bandleader Vic Meyers and others kept the speakeasies jumping through the Prohibition era, and by mid-century the thriving jazz scene in the city&#x27;s Skid Road district would launch the careers of musicians including Ray Charles and Quincy Jones.

<text>The Rideau Centre () (corporately styled as CF Rideau Centre) is a three-level shopping centre on Rideau Street in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It borders on Rideau Street, the ByWard Market, the Rideau Canal, the Mackenzie King Bridge, and Nicholas Street in Downtown Ottawa. Over 20 million people visit the mall annually. It is the largest shopping mall in the National Capital Region and the sixth largest mall, by area, in Canada. The Rideau Centre complex has approximately 180 retailers and is connected to a rooftop park, a Westin Hotel, the Shaw Centre, the Freiman Mall and the Major-General George R. Pearkes Building.

==History==
During its construction from 1981 to 1982, the construction of the Rideau Centre is speculated to have been largely controversial and widely opposed by local residents and business owners, as a whole block of stores south of Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s &quot;The Bay&quot; on Rideau Street would have required demolishing, solely to make room for the new building, and vehicle traffic was most likely to increase substantially upon its completion. The Eaton&#x27;s department store chain, one of the partners in the development, faced intense local opposition when it attempted to rename the mall the &quot;Rideau Eaton Centre&quot; while it was under construction, eventually backing down as a result of the backlash. The mall was officially opened on March 16, 1983.

On September 26, 2013, Cadillac Fairview began the expansion of the 30-year-old shopping centre. The redevelopment project expanded the Rideau Centre by 230,000 square feet and renovated retail and dining spaces. A key feature of the redevelopment project was a 35,000-square-foot dining hall offering 16 eating establishments, seating for 850 people, and reusable dinnerware, glassware, and metal cutlery. The projected cost of the redevelopment project was .

As part of the renovation, Tiffany &amp; Co., Kate Spade New York, and Stuart Weitzman opened locations in the mall. Large retailers added during the redevelopment included a 153,725 sq. ft. Nordstrom and a 103,874 sq. ft. Simons. Across the street, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company announced plans for major renovations following the announcement of Nordstrom&#x27;s opening; the 335,000 sq. ft. downtown flagship will be completely overhauled. This expansion has prompted many retailers already in the Rideau Centre to pursue renovations. Stores such as Harry Rosen have undergone major renovations, capitalizing on the Ottawa area&#x27;s density of high income salaried government employees. While the Rideau Centre does not have plans to focus on high-end luxury, the company says that the city is more of an &quot;aspirational luxury&quot; marketplace, one step removed from shops such as Louis Vuitton and Prada. Aside from the retail and interior space additions and renovations, the redesigned centre included significant façade enhancements along Rideau Street including a refurbished Charles Ogilvy heritage façade. The interior renovation included new quartz flooring, enhanced lighting, glass guardrails and improved amenities. The two pedestrian bridges crossing Rideau St were taken down, with one being demolished and the other renovated. The expansion at the Rideau Centre opened to the public on August 11, 2016, bringing the total retail floor area to over 969,000 sq. ft. Nordstrom announced in March 2023 that it will close all of its Canadian stores in the summer.

==Incidents==
Rideau Centre security and maintenance staff have been the subject of a number of controversies. In 2002, security staff handcuffed and detained two men for carrying an Israeli flag to enforce a mall rule prohibiting political signs. The men claimed that abusive comments were made towards them as Jews, but a police investigation was unable to sustain the allegations of anti-semitic abuse. In 2011, security staff handcuffed and detained a man who was attempting to cancel a gym membership. The man was released when police arrived, and the Rideau Centre&#x27;s tenant GoodLife Fitness suffered a media backlash over the incident. That year, nine people, including a former Speaker of the House of Commons and other dignitaries, were trapped for more than an hour and a half in the mall elevator. A former senator criticized the Rideau Centre for its slow response time.

In May 2016, a 19-year-old man was stabbed in the abdomen in the mall&#x27;s rooftop garden.

On the morning of June 8, 2016, the Rideau Centre was evacuated after a sinkhole opened up on Rideau Street.

On January 29, 2022, at approximately 3 p.m., the mall was forced to close when protesters from the convoy protest entered the mall, confronting employees following mask mandates. The mall re-opened on February 22 after police cleared the protesters out of the area. That same day, the Rideau Centre was evacuated and forced to temporarily close once again when Ottawa Police converged on the mall. A 50-year-old man was arrested and charged with robbery and &quot;several&quot; firearms-related offences. The mall re-opened on February 23.

==Transport==
Rideau Centre is served by Rideau station on OC Transpo&#x27;s Confederation Line. Two of the station&#x27;s four entrances are located within the mall; one near the intersection of Colonel By Drive and Rideau Street, and an accessible entrance near a crosswalk to Hudson&#x27;s Bay.

Rideau Centre and the adjacent Major-General George R. Pearkes Building are served by a stop located on Mackenzie King Bridge, which was the mall&#x27;s major transit hub until the opening of the Confederation Line in 2019. It is now served by OC Transpo routes 11, 16 and 19 as well as several STO routes.

<text>Baltiysk ( ) is a seaport town and the administrative center of Baltiysky District in Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia, located on the northern part of the Vistula Spit, on the shore of the Strait of Baltiysk separating the Vistula Lagoon from Gdańsk Bay. It had a population of 

Baltiysk, the westernmost town in Russia, is a major base of the Russian Navy&#x27;s Baltic Fleet and is connected to St. Petersburg by ferry.

==History==
===Old Prussian village===
Baltiysk was originally the site of an Old Prussian fishing village that was established on the coast of the Vistula Spit at some point in the 13th century. The village was named as &quot;Pile&quot; or &quot;Pil&quot; in several documents, possibly taking its name from &quot;pils&quot; the Old Prussian language word for fort. It was eventually conquered by the Teutonic Knights, with the name evolving into the German form of Pillau. In 1497, a storm surge dug a new gat in front of the village, and another large storm created the navigable Strait of Baltiysk through the gat on September 10, 1510. This fostered the growth of Pillau into an important port of the Duchy of Prussia, a vassal duchy of Poland, and a blockhouse was constructed in 1537, followed by a system of storehouses in 1543, and the earliest fortifications in 1550. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the harbor was occupied by Sweden in the aftermath of their victory over the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and King Gustavus Adolphus landed there with his reinforcements in May 1626. After the Truce of Altmark in 1629, the Swedes retained Pillau and set out upgrading its fortifications, constructing a star fort which remains one of the town&#x27;s landmarks. In 1635, the citizens of Pillau paid the ransom of 10,000 thalers, whereupon Swedish forces handed over the settlement to the Elector of Brandenburg.

===Prussian town===

By the end of the 17th century, Pillau had expanded considerably, and a lighthouse and a stone church were built. Peter the Great, the Tsar of Russia, visited Pillau on three occasions, the first being in 1697 in connection with his Grand Embassy to Western Europe. A statue of Peter the Great currently stands next to the lighthouse. After Pillau was granted town privileges in 1725, the Baroque-style town hall was constructed and inaugurated in May 1745 but was destroyed at the end of World War II. Russian forces occupied the town during the Seven Years&#x27; War and built a small Orthodox church there, with the event commemorated by the equestrian statue of Empress Elizabeth, unveiled in 2004. In the late 18th century, the present-day southern part of the town, the part located on the Vistula Spit, was annexed by Prussia in the Partitions of Poland. In June 1807, Pillau was stormed by Napoleon&#x27;s Grande Armée during the Napoleonic Wars, although no outstanding events took place during the rest of the 19th century. Records of a Scottish &quot;colony&quot; established in Pillau in 1815 appeared in an 1890 publication, although their authenticity is questionable. The lighthouse was built up to a height of and the entire fortress was updated and rebuilt by the Prussians in 1871. In 1886, the town had a population of 3,434, apart from the fortress garrison.

The importance of Pillau declined from 15 November 1901, when a shipping canal was opened linking the Vistula Lagoon near Zimmerbude (now Svetly) to Königsberg. Pillau&#x27;s economy was heavily based on large shipping vessels being forced to dock in the town due to the shallow depth of the lagoon near Königsberg, the capital and the largest city of East Prussia, and the goods would then be transported from Pillau to Königsberg by other means. Constructed at a huge cost of thirteen million marks, the canal allowed vessels of a draught to moor alongside the city or to sail directly to Königsberg without stopping at Pillau, causing a serious decline to the town&#x27;s economy.

===World War II===
During World War II, Pillau had a U-boat training facility, and on 16 April 1945, the was sunk by Red Army
artillery fire while she was docked near the electricity supply pier in Pillau port, and was the only U-boat to be ever sunk by land-based forces in World War II. As the Red Army entered East Prussia, more than 450,000 refugees were ferried from Pillau to central and western Germany. The town was eventually captured by Soviet forces on 25 April 1945, only a few days before the end of the war and as the last part of East Prussia to be abandoned by Germany.

===Modern Baltiysk===
After the war, Pillau was included in the northern part of East Prussia passed to the Soviet Union that became Kaliningrad Oblast, and the German inhabitants were expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. During the Russification campaign, the town&#x27;s name was changed to Baltiysk in 1946.
In 1952, the Soviet authorities inaugurated a naval base for the Baltic Fleet of the Soviet Navy at Baltiysk, and as a result, it became a closed town with access forbidden to foreigners or those without a permit. During the Cold War it was served by the Baltiysk Air Base. The town, along with Kaliningrad, remains one of only two year-round ice-free ports along the Baltic Sea coastline available to Russia.
In 2019, on a wave of anti-Western sentiment following Russia&#x27;s annexation of Crimea, there were calls to change the town&#x27;s German-era coat of arms, which features a sturgeon wearing the crown of King Frederick William I of Prussia. The historic arms had been granted to the town, then known as Pillau, in 1725.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Baltiysk serves as the administrative center of Baltiysky District. As an administrative division, it is, together with two rural localities, incorporated within Baltiysky District as the town of district significance of Baltiysk. As a municipal division, the town of district significance of Baltiysk is incorporated within Baltiysky Municipal District as Baltiyskoye Urban Settlement.

==Geography==
The town is located on the northern part of the Vistula Spit, on the shore of the Strait of Baltiysk separating the Vistula Lagoon from Gdańsk Bay.

===Climate===
Baltiysk has a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot; borders on &quot;Dfb&quot;). Winters are cold to mild, while summers are warm. In July and August, the warmest season, high temperatures average and low temperatures average . In January and February, the coldest season, high temperatures average with low temperatures averaging .

==Landmarks==

Historical buildings in and around the town include the pentagonal , founded by the Swedes in 1626, completed by the Prussians in 1670, renovated in 1870, and currently holding a naval museum; the ruins of the 13th-century Lochstadt Castle; a maze of 19th-century naval fortifications; the Naval Cathedral of St. George (1866); the Expressionist observation tower (1932); the Gothic Revival building of the Baltic Fleet Museum (1903); and an elegant lighthouse, dating from 1813 to 1816. A stone cross, erected in 1830 to commemorate the supposed spot of St. Adalbert of Prague&#x27;s martyrdom, was destroyed by the Soviets and restored a millennium after the event, in 1997. There is a seaside monument of Empress Elizabeth of Russia, erected postwar by the Russian sculptor Georgy Frangulyan.

<text>This article lists political parties in Bangladesh.

Since the restoration of parliamentary democracy in 1991, Bangladesh has a fading two-party system, which means that two political parties dominate the general elections, the Awami League (AL) and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), with extreme difficulty for anybody to achieve electoral success under the banner of another party.

Although the AL and BNP dominated Bangladeshi politics for a long time, the two have led coalitions of like-minded parties multiple times, with traditionally the AL leading the left-of-centre parties and the BNP rallying the right-of-centre parties.

==Alliances==

===Grand Alliance===

The Grand Alliance () is an alliance of political parties in Bangladesh that was formed in 2008. It consist of the Awami League, Jatiya Party (Ershad), Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal, Workers Party,
Liberal Democratic Party,
Jatiya Party (Manju),
Bangladesh Tarikat Federation,
Ganatantri Dol,
Communist Party of Bangladesh (Marxist-Leninist) (Barua) and
Bikalpa Dhara Bangladesh.

The Liberal Democratic Party left the Grand Alliance before the election and contested independently. It joined the 18 Party Alliance in 2012.

===Left Democratic Alliance===

The Left Democratic Alliance is an alliance of eight leftist political parties including Communist Party of Bangladesh, Socialist Party of Bangladesh, Revolutionary Workers Party of Bangladesh, Revolutionary Communist League of Bangladesh, Ganatantrik Biplobi Party, Bam Gonotantrik Andolon and Ganosanhati Andolan.

<doc id="398969" wikidata="Q5866440" url="?curid=398969" title="History of Seattle before 1900">
<text>Two conflicting perspectives exist for the early history of Seattle. There is the &quot;establishment&quot; view, which favors the centrality of the Denny Party (generally the Denny, Mercer, Terry, and Boren families), and Henry Yesler. A second, less didactic view, advanced particularly by historian Bill Speidel and others such as Murray Morgan, sees David Swinson &quot;Doc&quot; Maynard as a key figure, perhaps &quot;the&quot; key figure. In the late nineteenth century, when Seattle had become a thriving town, several members of the Denny Party still survived; they and many of their descendants were in local positions of power and influence. Maynard was about ten years older and died relatively young, so he was not around to make his own case. The Denny Party were generally conservative Methodists, teetotalers, Whigs, and Republicans, while Maynard was a drinker and a Democrat. He felt that well-run prostitution could be a healthy part of a city&#x27;s economy. He was also on friendly terms with the region&#x27;s Native Americans, while many of the Denny Party were not. Thus Maynard was not on the best of terms with what became the Seattle Establishment, especially after the Puget Sound War. He was nearly written out of the city&#x27;s history until Morgan&#x27;s 1951 book &quot;Skid Road&quot; and Speidel&#x27;s research in the 1960s and 1970s.

==Founding==

What is now Seattle has been inhabited since at least the end of the last glacial period (—10,000 years ago). Archaeological excavations at what is now called West Point in Discovery Park, Magnolia confirm settlement within the current city for at least 4,000 years and probably much longer. The area of (&quot;herring house&quot;) and later (&quot;where there are horse clams&quot;) at the then-mouth of the Duwamish River in what is now the Industrial District had been inhabited since the 6th century CE. The &quot;Dkhw&#x27;Duw&#x27;Absh&quot; (People of the Inside), and the &quot;Xachua&#x27;bsh&quot; (People of the Large Lake), of the (Skagit-Nisqually) Lushootseed Coast Salish Native American Nations occupied at least 17 villages in the mid-1850s (13 within what are now the city limits), living in some 93 permanent longhouses (&quot;khwaac&#x27;ál&#x27;al&quot;) along the lower Duwamish River, Elliott Bay, Salmon Bay, Portage Bay, Lake Washington within what is now Seattle, as well as Lake Sammamish, and the Duwamish, Black, and Cedar Rivers in what is now metropolitan Seattle. The &quot;Dkhw&#x27;Duw&#x27;Absh&quot; and &quot;Xachua&#x27;bsh&quot; are today represented by the Duwamish Tribe.

George Vancouver was the first European to visit the Seattle area in May 1792 during his 1791–95 expedition to chart the Pacific Northwest; the first White forays for sites in the area were in the 1830s.

The founding of Seattle is usually dated from the arrival of the Denny Party on November 13, 1851, at Alki Point. The group had travelled overland from the Midwest to Portland, Oregon, then made a short ocean journey up the Pacific coast into Puget Sound, with the express intent of founding a town. The next April, Arthur A. Denny abandoned the original site at Alki in favor of a better-protected site on Elliott Bay, near the south end of what is now downtown Seattle. Around the same time, Doc Maynard began settling the land immediately south of Denny&#x27;s. Charles C. Terry and others hung on at Alki for a few more years, but eventually it became clear that Maynard and Denny had chosen the better location.

The first plats for Seattle were filed on May 23, 1853. Nominal legal land settlement was provisionally established in 1855 (with treaty terms for what is now Seattle not implemented). Doc Maynard&#x27;s land claim lay south of today&#x27;s Yesler Way, encompassing most of today&#x27;s Pioneer Square Historical District and the International District. He based his street grid on strict compass bearings. The more northerly plats of Arthur A. Denny and Carson D. Boren encompassed Pioneer Square north of what is now Yesler Way; the heart of the current downtown; and the western slope of First Hill. These had street grids that more or less followed the shoreline. The downtown grid from Yesler Way north to Stewart Street is oriented 32 degrees west of north; from Stewart north to Denny Way the orientation is 49 degrees west of north. The result is a tangle of streets where the grids clash. (&quot;See also Street layout of Seattle.&quot;)

Both Alki and the settlement that was to become Seattle relied in their early decades on the timber industry, shipping out logs (and, later, milled timber) to build and rebuild San Francisco which, as Bill Speidel points out, kept burning down. Seattle and Alki offered plenty of trees to build San Francisco and plenty of hills to slide them down to water. A climax forest of trees up to 1,000–2,000 years old and towering as high as nearly covered much of what is now Seattle. Today, none of that size remain anywhere in the world.

==Relations with Native Americans==

&quot;This section draws heavily on Bill Speidel,&quot; Sons of the Profits &quot;(1967) and&quot; Doc Maynard&quot; (1978).&quot; Doc Maynard &quot;and Murray Morgan,&quot; Skid Road &quot;(1951, 1960, 1982) are especially useful on the events regarding resistance nominally led by Kamiakim in the January 1856 attack on the town.&quot;

=== Before the Treaty of Point Elliott (1855) ===

Early European-American settlers in Seattle had a sometimes rocky relationship with local Native Americans since they were steadily taking away Native lands and, in many cases, mistreating Native people. There were numerous deadly attacks by white settlers against Native Americans and by Native Americans against white settlers.

Bill Speidel writes of white settlers in &quot;Sons of the Profits&quot;, &quot;The general consensus of the community was that killing an Indian was a matter of no graver consequence than shooting a cougar or a bear...&quot; Against this background, Doc Maynard stands out for his excellent relations with Native people. He and Chief Seattle (Suquamish/Duwamish, c. 1786–1866) were friends and allies. Maynard profited greatly from this friendship. During an 1856 violent outbreak of hostilities, Maynard risked the wrath of his fellow white settlers by protecting neutral American Indians. However, outside of some old-time trappers and traders, he held a minority perspective.

Denny Lander and Edward Lander, the first local federal judge, also stood out in that they believed that the law should be applied fairly and equally: to them, murder was murder, regardless of the race of the victim. However, they found it was impossible to get this view upheld by white juries of the time. In &quot;Sons of the Profits&quot;, Speidel recounts a case of two vigilantes who had hanged a Native American man. After a series of (possibly deliberate) irregularities in their trial, the jury acquitted these obviously guilty men on a technicality.

Territorial Governor Isaac Stevens probably did more damage to relations between settlers and Native Americans than any one other person. He put a bounty on scalps of &quot;bad Indians&quot;. He declared martial law to prevent Lander from issuing writs of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; for people who were held in jail for little other reason than sympathizing with Native people. On at least two occasions, he actually had Lander himself jailed.

Perhaps worst of all in its consequences for relations, he dealt dishonestly in treaties, among other things making verbal promises that were not matched by what was written down. Local tribes had at least a three-decade history of dealing with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, who had developed a reputation for driving a hard bargain, but sticking honestly to what they agreed to, and for treating Whites and Indians impartially. This continued through the dealings of the local Bureau of Indian Affairs Superintendent General, Joel Palmer, who (along with Maynard&#x27;s brother-in-law, Indian Agent Mike Simmons) was among the few even-handed men in the BIA.

Consequently, when Stevens, in drafting treaties, acted in a manner that Judge James Wickerson would characterize 40 years later as &quot;unfair, unjust, ungenerous, and illegal&quot;, some Native people, quite unprepared for such behavior by the official representatives of the white man&#x27;s power, were angered to the point of war. The unjust and deliberately confusing Western Washington treaties, including the Treaty of Medicine Creek (1854) and Treaty of Point Elliott (1855) were followed by the yet more provocative Treaty of Walla Walla (1855). Stevens ignored federal instructions to focus on sorting out the areas where Native peoples and European-American settlers found themselves immediately adjacent to one another, or, from the other perspective, where settlers moved onto Native land.

=== After the Treaty of Point Elliott (1855) ===
By the time of the Treaty of Point Elliott, Maynard had already made an ally of Chief Seattle by arranging to have him somewhat compensated for the use of his name for the new town. Chief Seattle&#x27;s ancestral religion and Coast Salish culture have beliefs opposed to speaking or using a person&#x27;s name after that person&#x27;s death and prior to protocols, so this was not a simple matter, although Chief Seattle soon converted to a somewhat eclectic Roman Catholicism. At Point Elliott, Maynard cemented this alliance (and greatly benefited his emerging town) by negotiating for Chief Seattle and the Duwamish a separate, more favorable treaty, which, in exchange for a relatively large reservation (promised, not yet ever fulfilled), Natives abandoned all aboriginal title to , constituting an area almost identical to the eventual twentieth-century city limits of the City of Seattle, for nearly nothing at the time.

With Stevens in Eastern Washington sowing discord, Secretary of State Charles Mason was left in charge of the state government. Yakama Chief Kamiakim had effectively declared war and told nations such as the Duwamish that they could either join him or would be treated as enemies. By autumn, there had been an exchange of massacres by Whites and settlers, in which both sides seemed ready to kill whichever people of the other race were at hand, with no regard for whether these particular individuals had in any way previously wronged them. (This cycle of retaliatory violence would reach its logical conclusion two years after the war, when &quot;si&#x27;ab&quot; Lescay (Chief Leschi) was tried and condemned to death for murder, and hanged before his appeal could be properly heard.)

Maynard got Mike Simmons to deputize him as a Special Indian Agent, then—in a complex, multi-way transaction—cemented a relationship with acting governor Mason and some other key figures by selling them some prime Seattle real estate at a good price. He then used the money from the transaction to buy supplies and a boat to ferry Chief Seattle and his Duwamish to what was effectively a privately funded reservation at Port Madison, west of Puget Sound. He also, at enormous personal risk, spent the first several weeks of November 1855 traveling around eastern King County, which was already penetrated by some of Kamiakim&#x27;s men, informing several hundred other neutral natives that there was a safe place they could go. Most of them took him up on it. Induced fear effected abandonment of places Natives were otherwise loath to leave.

(In &quot;Doc Maynard&quot;, Bill Speidel reports that not all of the Seattle businessmen were pleased with his getting the local Indians out of the way. Henry Yesler and others found themselves deprived of much of their labor force and wrote letters of protest to the territorial government.)

Shortly before Stevens returned to Olympia January 16, 1856, Captain E.D. Keyes had managed an uneasy informal truce by communicating with, among others, Chief Leschi. Stevens promptly undercut the truce, saying of the natives, &quot;Nothing but death is mete punishment for their perfidy&quot;.

On January 25, 1856, Stevens announced, &quot;The town of Seattle is in as much danger of an Indian attack as are the cities of San Francisco or New York&quot;.

On January 26, 1856, natives attacked the Seattle settlement. Friendly Indians permitted to stay in Seattle had warned the Whites, and sentries had been put on patrol. In the morning, acting on tip, a shell was lobbed into the forest above the town, what is now First Hill. First fire. The Indians fired back, small arms. Settlers rushed from their cabins to the blockhouse. The defenses were based on a large wooden blockhouse, a five-foot-high wood-and-earth breastwork, various ravines—and the cannon just offshore zeroed (bearing and range laid in). The settlement was defended at the time by the 150 man, 566 ton, 16 gun sloop-of-war &quot;Decatur&quot;, the bark &quot;Bronte&quot;, seven out-of-town civilian volunteers, fifty local volunteers, and at least 6 Marines from the &quot;Decatur&quot;. The number of attackers is impossible to establish: estimates range from a mere thirty to 2000 with more than a hundred killed, another hundred wounded. Not so much as a single Indian body was ever found, not even a sign of blood. The Indians had made no attempt to storm the stockade. No one in the blockhouse was much interested in venturing out on attack. Both sides had paused for dinner. There were two known fatalities: a young volunteer and a 14-year-old boy, both of whom had neglected to stay behind cover. No one who kept inside the stockade was wounded. A few things do seem clear in this fog of war: nearly all of the local volunteers hardly left the blockhouse, the Navy took no combat casualties in this land battle, and Kamiakim&#x27;s forces were successfully driven off, but also took few (if any) fatalities. Still, they seem to have drawn the conclusion that attacking a major settlement wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble. The only remaining major battle of the war was to occur March 10 at Connell&#x27;s Prairie near Puyallup.

=== After the skirmish &quot;Battle of Seattle&quot; ===
The cessation of general hostilities did not diminish Stevens&#x27; crusading zeal against the natives. He encouraged fratricidal war by offering the &quot;good Indians&quot; a bounty for scalps of the &quot;bad Indians&quot;. The largest collector of such rewards was Chief Seattle&#x27;s sworn rival, Chief Patkanim, a leader among the Snoqualmie and Snohomish. According to Speidel, Patkanim was not above killing and scalping his own slaves as a means of generating income. Speidel also narrates (in &quot;Sons of the Profits&quot;) that on one occasion this led to a native being killed and scalped in Stevens&#x27; own office.

Stevens continually attempted to recruit Chief Seattle and the Duwamish to this cause. Maynard and Chief Seattle, who had already gone to great lengths to help keep the Duwamish at a safe distance from Patkanim, never actually refused the Governor&#x27;s request, but instead maintained a successful pattern of stalling and passive resistance to avoid ever providing any Duwamish fighters to further Stevens&#x27; scheme.

The 1862 Pacific Northwest smallpox epidemic killed roughly half of the native population. Documentation in archives and historical epidemiology demonstrates that Governmental policies furthered the progress of the epidemic among the natives.

The Seattle Establishment, including &#x27;Doc&#x27; Maynard, petitioned the Territorial Delegate to Congress in 1866 to deny treaty rights to the Duwamish. The commitments made by the United States government in the Point Elliott Treaty have not yet been met.

==Yesler&#x27;s Mill==

Seattle&#x27;s topography was rugged compared to Alki, which hampered initial development. However, when Henry Yesler brought financial backing from a Massillon, Ohio capitalist, John E. McLain, to start a steam sawmill, he chose a location in Seattle on the waterfront, where Maynard and Denny&#x27;s plats met. Thereafter, Seattle would dominate the lumber industry.

Yesler selected this location because of a critical flaw with Alki as a port: the tides sweeping down south through the Sound from Canada, which made it impossible to build out into the water.

The road leading down the hill to that mill, later called Mill Street and now known as Yesler Way, was originally known as the Skid Road, the route for skidding logs down to the mill, hence the term &quot;Skid Road&quot; or corrupted as &quot;Skid Row&quot; for a rundown or dilapidated urban area, as the mill declined and the area collapsed with the Crash and Great Depression.

Via the bargaining power of his mill, Yesler wrangled about of prime land from some of the original settlers. Besides his mill, Yesler opened a cookhouse that set much of the city&#x27;s activity firmly within his land. Though the mill was never lucrative, the strategic location of Yesler&#x27;s land still made him a millionaire. Like many of Seattle&#x27;s early entrepreneurs, Yesler was not always the most scrupulous about how he made his money; he borrowed $30,000 at 8% interest to build the mill, and repaid McLain only after McLain took him to court three times.

==A city grows==

The first Seattle fortunes were founded on logs, and later milled timber, shipped south for the construction of buildings in San Francisco. Seattle itself, in the early years, was, of course, also a place of wooden buildings, and remained so until the Great Fire of June 6, 1889. Even the early system of delivering water to the settlement used hollowed-out logs for pipes. Seattle in its early years relied on the timber industry, shipping logs (and, later, milled timber) to San Francisco.

Terry sold out Alki (which, after his departure barely held on as a settlement), moved to Seattle and began acquiring land. He either owned or partially owned the first ships that allowed Seattle&#x27;s timber industry to exist by providing a means to move the product to market. He eventually gave a land grant to the University of the Territory of Washington that housed its original campus and today makes the University of Washington a downtown landlord collecting rents of more than $1 million a year. He worked in politics to establish street grades, a water system, and a host of other services (which, not coincidentally, benefited him as one of the city&#x27;s largest landholders).

Meanwhile, Arthur Denny became the second richest man in town, after Yesler, and got himself elected to territorial legislature. From that position, he tried unsuccessfully to get the territorial capital moved to Seattle from its then supposedly temporary location in Olympia. The other potential money prizes were the territorial penitentiary and the territorial university. When the politics all played out, Vancouver wound up as the proposed capital, Port Townsend was supposed to get the penitentiary, and Seattle got the university. Apparently, Seattle was the only real winner in this deal: to this day, Olympia remains the capital of Washington; the main state penitentiary is in Walla Walla.

The legislature had tacked on the requirement that a grant of of land would be required for the university to be built, which they presumably thought would be sufficient to prevent its construction. However, Denny wanted his town to grow and donated the land, creating what would be &quot;one of the biggest and most effective central core properties in the United States&quot;. The University of the Territory of Washington (later the University of Washington) opened on November 4, 1861. There were barely enough students to run it as a high school, let alone as a university, but over time it grew into its originally grandiose name.

The logging town developed rapidly into a small city. Despite being officially founded by the Methodists of the Denny Party, Seattle quickly developed a reputation as a wide-open town, a haven for prostitution, liquor, and gambling. Some attribute this, at least in part, to Maynard, who arrived separately from the Denny Party, and who had a rather different view of what it would take to build a city, based on his experience in growing Cleveland, Ohio. By selling some of his land cheaply on condition that businesses be soon built upon them, he recruited professionals, such as blacksmiths and purveyors of vice, who enhanced the value of his remaining land. The city&#x27;s first brothel dated from 1861 and was founded by one John Pinnell (or Pennell), who was already involved in similar business in San Francisco. Real estate records show that nearly all of the city&#x27;s first 60 businesses were on, or immediately adjacent to, Maynard&#x27;s plat.

Seattle was incorporated as a town January 14, 1865. The incorporators were Charles C. Terry, Henry L. Yesler, David T. Denny, Charles Plummer and Hiram Burnett, manager of the largest Puget Sound lumber company predecessor to Pope &amp; Talbot. That charter was voided January 18, 1867, in response to unrest. Seattle was re-incorporated as a city on December 2, 1869. At the times of incorporation, the population was approximately 350 and 1,000, respectively.

== Railroad rivalry and encroaching civilization ==

On July 14, 1873, the Northern Pacific Railway announced that they had chosen the then-small town of Tacoma over Seattle as the Western terminus of their transcontinental railroad. The railroad barons appear to have been gambling on the advantage they could gain from being able to buy up the land around their terminus cheaply instead of bringing the railroad into a more established Pacific port town.

Unwilling to be bypassed, the citizens of Seattle chartered their own railroad, the Seattle &amp; Walla Walla, to link with the Union Pacific Railroad in eastern Washington. The S&amp;WW never got beyond Renton, but that was far enough to connect with new coal mines, fueling industry in Seattle. The later Seattle, Lake Shore &amp; Eastern Railway was only moderately more successful, although it did provide a route for logs to come to the city from as far away as Arlington, Washington, boost development of towns, and help Seattle hit the jackpot with the Northern Pacific. The Great Northern Railway chose Seattle as the terminus for its transcontinental road in 1893, winning Seattle a place in competition for freight traffic to California and across the Pacific. The Seattle, Lake Shore &amp; Eastern was, over the years, incorporated into the Northern Pacific and then the Burlington Northern railways. The line was abandoned as a railroad in 1971 with the general decline in rail, and became in 1978 a foot and bicycle route renamed the Burke-Gilman Trail, then gradually greatly extended.

As has been remarked, Seattle in this era was an &quot;open&quot; and often relatively lawless town. Although it boasted two English-language newspapers (and, for a while, a third in Norwegian), and telephones had arrived in town, lynch law sometimes prevailed (there were at least four lynchings in 1882), schools barely operated, and indoor plumbing was a rare novelty. In the low mud flats where much of the city was built, sewage was almost as likely to come in on the tide as to flow away. Potholes in the street were so bad that legend has it there was at least one fatal drowning.

The 1882 lynchings are well described in Murray Morgan&#x27;s book &quot;Skid Road&quot;. The events involved a mob defying an armed sheriff, successfully disarming the sheriff&#x27;s deputies, and assaulting Judge Roger Sherman Greene, who attempted to slash the ropes by which the lynching victims were to be hanged. Judge Greene, while not doubting the actual guilt of the lynched men, was later to write that &quot;the lynchers were co-criminal with the lynched&quot;.
In an era during which the Washington Territory was one of the first parts of the U.S. to (briefly) allow women&#x27;s suffrage, Seattle women attempted to counter these trends and to be a civilizing influence. On April 4, 1884, 15 Seattle women founded The Ladies Relief Society to address &quot;the number of needy and suffering cases within the limits of the city&quot;. This eventually resulted in the founding of the Seattle Children&#x27;s Home, still in operation today.

Other signs of encroaching civilization were the city&#x27;s first bathtub with plumbing in 1870, and first streetcar in 1884, followed by a cable car from downtown over First Hill to Leschi Park in 1887. In 1885, the city passed an ordinance requiring attached sewer lines for all new residences. In 1886, the city got its first YMCA gymnasium, and in 1888 the exclusive Rainier Club was founded. On December 24, 1888, ferry service was inaugurated, connecting Seattle to West Seattle, near the location of the Denny Party&#x27;s first attempt at settling at Alki and reviving that settlement. A year later, a bridge was built across Salmon Bay, providing a land route to the nearby town of Ballard, which after 17 years would be annexed to Seattle.

The relative fortunes of Seattle and Tacoma clearly show the nature of Seattle&#x27;s growth. Though both Seattle and Tacoma grew at a rapid rate from 1880 to 1890, based on the strength of their timber industries, Seattle&#x27;s growth as an exporter of services and manufactured goods continued for another two decades, while Tacoma&#x27;s growth dropped almost to zero. The reason for this lies in Tacoma&#x27;s nature as a company town and Seattle&#x27;s successful avoidance of that condition.

Both Seattle and Tacoma in the 1880s were essentially lumber towns, built on the resulting export income. All over the Puget Sound there are communities that started with the same assets, timber and a port. However, Seattle&#x27;s early lead with Yesler&#x27;s mill and other enterprises meant that its economy was based on manufacturing as well as lumber, and was thus far more diversified than Tacoma&#x27;s. The Northern Pacific Railway terminus only increased Tacoma&#x27;s lumber trade instead of diversifying the economy. Meanwhile, Seattle became the hub for the region and the railroad &quot;had&quot; to come.

==Relations between whites and Chinese==

Chinese first arrived in Seattle around 1860. The Northern Pacific Railway completed the project of laying tracks from Lake Superior to Tacoma, Washington, in 1883, leaving many Chinese laborers without employment. In 1883, Chinese laborers played a key role in the first effort at digging the Montlake Cut to connect Lake Union&#x27;s Portage Bay to Lake Washington&#x27;s Union Bay.

Seattle&#x27;s Chinese district, located near the present day Occidental Park, was a mixed neighborhood of residences over stores, laundries, and other retail storefronts. In fall 1885, with a shortage of jobs in the West, many workers turned violently anti-Chinese, complaining of overly cheap labor competition. In the Pacific Northwest, this had the unusual character that the anti-Chinese mobs included significant numbers of the native Indians as well as European-Americans.

The first massacre of Chinese occurred at Rock Springs, Wyoming, September 2, 1885. On September 7, Chinese hop-pickers were massacred in the Squak valley near present-day Issaquah. Similar incidents occurred in the nearby mining camps at Coal Creek and Black Diamond. Many Chinese headed from these isolated rural areas into the cities, but it did them little good: on October 24, a mob burned a large portion of Seattle&#x27;s Chinatown; on November 3, a mob of 300 expelled the Chinese in Tacoma (loading them into boxcars with surprisingly little actual violence) before moving on to force similar expulsions in smaller towns.

Violent opposition to the Chinese at this time was inseparable from labor union organizing. The pro-labor &quot;Seattle Call&quot; routinely described the Chinese in brutally racist terms; leading figures in the anti-Chinese movement included Knights of Labor organizer Dan Cronin and Seattle socialist agitator Mary Kenworthy; the utopian socialist George Venable Smith was also of this party. Nor did the Chinese have many strong defenders among the wealthier classes, who, however, mostly favored a more orderly departure of the Chinese to massacre and riot (the policy of Henry Yesler, who was serving as mayor at this time).
Among the few defenders of the rule of law were the Methodist Episcopal Ministers&#x27; Association and Judge Thomas Burke. Burke, generally a friend of labor, was nonetheless a stronger defender of the Constitution; he also spoke out that his fellow Irish should identify with the Chinese as fellow immigrants, a view which fell almost entirely on deaf ears.

On February 7, 1886, well-organized anti-Chinese &quot;order committees&quot; descended on Seattle&#x27;s Chinatown, claiming to be health inspectors, declaring Chinese-occupied buildings to be unfit for habitation, rousting out the residents and herding them down to the harbor, where the &quot;Queen of the Pacific&quot; was docked. The police were willing to intervene only to the point of preventing the Chinese from being physically harmed, not to challenging the mob. It is quite probable that if ship&#x27;s captain Jack Alexander had been willing simply to board the Chinese and take them away, the mob would entirely have ruled the day; however, he was not in the business of hauling non-paying passengers. The mob raised several hundred dollars, 86 Chinese were boarded, but this delay gave the mayor, Judge Burke, the U.S. Attorney, and others time both to rally the Home Guard and to serve Alexander with a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. A plot to deport the Chinese by rail was foiled when Sheriff McGraw threatened to prosecute the railroad superintendent for kidnapping.

The following day, Judge Greene made it clear that those Chinese who wished to remain would be protected, but by now, after what they had been through, all but sixteen preferred to leave. Alexander, by now, &quot;was anxious to keep his operations strictly legal&quot;, and would board only the 196 passengers for which his ship was rated, slightly more than half of the Chinese who were ready to leave. Possibly due to poor communication, the anti-Chinese faction were unsatisfied; a resulting scuffle resulted in one dead and four others wounded among the anti-Chinese faction, and martial law was imposed. Ultimately, the bulk of the Chinese remained in Seattle, and the U.S. government &quot;out of humane consideration and without reference to liability&quot; paid out $276,619.15 to the Chinese government, but nothing to the victims themselves.

==The Great Seattle Fire==
The early Seattle era came to a stunning halt with the Great Seattle Fire of June 6, 1889. It burned 29 city blocks, destroying most of the central business district; no one, however, perished in the flames, and the city quickly rebounded from the destruction. Thanks in part to credit arranged by Jacob Furth (as well as, according to Speidel, brothel-owner Lou Graham), Seattle rebuilt from the ashes with astounding rapidity. A new zoning code resulted in a downtown of brick and stone buildings, rather than wood. In the single year after the fire, the city grew from 25,000 to 40,000 inhabitants, largely because of the enormous number of construction jobs suddenly created.

==Labor history in 19th century Seattle==
The Pacific Northwest economy during the nineteenth century was heavily rooted in extractive industries, mainly logging. Still, Seattle was becoming a city, and union organizing arrived first in the form of a skilled craft union. In 1882, Seattle printers formed the Seattle Typographical Union Local 202. Dockworkers followed in 1886, cigarmakers in 1887, tailors in 1889, and both brewers and musicians in 1890. Even the newsboys unionized in 1892, followed by more organizing, mostly of craft unions.

According to various analyses and as evident through general readings in news coverage of the time, the history of labor in this period is inseparable from the issue of anti-Chinese vigilantism, as discussed above. A rough-and-ready approach to labor organizing was typical of the period, and there is no question that white Seattle-area laborers at this time saw cheap Chinese labor as their prime competition and strove to eliminate it by eliminating the Chinese immigrants.

==The Klondike Gold Rush==
Seattle, as well as the rest of the nation, was hard hit by the Panic of 1893 and, to a lesser extent, the Panic of 1896. Unlike many other cities, it soon found salvation in the form of becoming the main transportation and supply center for stampeders heading for the Klondike gold rush. When the steamer SS &quot;Portland&quot; arrived at Schwabacher&#x27;s Wharf in Seattle July 17, 1897, the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; scooped all other U.S. newspapers with the story that a &quot;ton of gold&quot; had arrived from Alaska. A publicity campaign engineered largely by Erastus Brainerd successfully convinced the world that Seattle was the place to be outfitted for the journey to Alaska, and Seattle became a household name, literally overnight. The miners mined the gold. Seattle mined the miners.

Seattle&#x27;s relationship with Alaska during this period was generally one of rapacity. Besides the mining, on October 18, 1899, in Pioneer Square, a Chamber of Commerce &quot;Committee of Fifteen&quot;, just back from a goodwill visit to Alaska, proudly unveiled a totem pole from Fort Tongass. The problem was, the pole had been stolen from the Tlingit village of Gaash on Cape Fox. A federal grand jury in Alaska indicted eight of Seattle&#x27;s most prominent citizens for theft of government property. A nominal fine was assessed. The village was repaid when the original burned and the Chamber of Commerce commissioned a replacement—and paid twice. &quot;Thank you for the check&quot;, wrote the Gaash village leaders. &quot;That was payment for the first one. Send another check for the replacement&quot;.

<text>Macaronesia (; ) is a collection of four volcanic archipelagos in the North Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of North Africa and Europe. Each archipelago is made up of a number of Atlantic oceanic islands, which were formed by seamounts on the ocean floor whose peaks have risen above the ocean&#x27;s surface.

Each of the archipelagos is a distinct political entity: the Azores and Madeira are autonomous regions of Portugal, the Canary Islands is an autonomous community of Spain, while Cape Verde is a sovereign state and member of the United Nations. Politically, the islands belonging to Portugal and Spain are parts of the European Union, while Cape Verde is a member of the African Union. Geologically, most of Macaronesia is part of the African tectonic plate. The Azores are located in the triple junction between the African, Eurasian, and North American plates.

In one biogeographical system, the Cape Verde archipelago is in the Afrotropical realm while the other three archipelagos are in the Palearctic realm. According to the European Environment Agency, the three archipelagos within the European Union constitute a unique bioregion, known as the Macaronesian Biogeographic Region. The World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions places the whole of Macaronesia in its botanical continent of Africa.

In 2022, Macaronesia had an estimated combined population of 3,222,054 people; 2,172,944 (67%) in the Canary Islands, 561,901 (17%) in Cape Verde, 250,769 (8%) in Madeira, and 236,440 (7%) in the Azores.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Macaronesia&quot; was originally used by Ancient Greek geographers to refer to any islands west of the Strait of Gibraltar. It is derived from the Greek words meaning &#x27;islands of the fortunate&#x27; (, ). The term fell out of use until it was revived in 1917 with its current meaning.

The name is occasionally misspelled &quot;Macronesia&quot; in false analogy with Micronesia, an unrelated group of archipelagos in the Pacific Ocean whose name is also derived from Greek.

== Archipelagos ==

Macaronesia consists of four main archipelagos. In alphabetical order, these are:

* : autonomous region of Portugal
* : autonomous community of Spain
* : sovereign state, a member of the United Nations
* (including the Savage Islands): autonomous region of Portugal

==Geography and geology==

The islands of Macaronesia are volcanic in origin, and are thought to be the product of several geologic hotspots. Due to the geographic location, varied relief and altitudinal ranges, the Macaronesian mountains represent a wide range of climates. These climates include oceanic, Mediterranean, and humid subtropical climates in the Azores; the tropical savanna climates in Madeira; the desert and semi-desert climates in the Canary Islands; and a tropical climate in Cape Verde.

In some locations, there are variations in climate due to the rain shadow effect. The laurisilva forests of Macaronesia are a type of mountain cloud forest with relict plant species of a vegetation type that originally covered much of the Mediterranean Basin, when the climate of that region was more humid. These plant species, many of which are endemic, have evolved to adapt to the islands&#x27; variable climatic conditions.

The Macaronesian islands have a biogeography that is unique in the world. They are home to several distinct plant and animal communities. Notably, the jumping spider genus &quot;Macaroeris&quot; is named after Macaronesia. Because none of the Macaronesian islands were ever part of any continent, all of the native plants and animals reached the islands via long-distance dispersal. Laurel-leaved forests, called &quot;laurisilva&quot;, once covered most of the Azores, Madeira, and parts of the Canaries at an altitude of between , the eastern Canaries and Cape Verde being too dry.

These forests resemble the ancient forests that covered the Mediterranean Basin and northwestern Africa before the cooling and drying of the ice ages. Trees of the genera &quot;Apollonias&quot;, &quot;Clethra&quot;, &quot;Dracaena&quot;, &quot;Ocotea&quot;, &quot;Persea&quot;, and &quot;Picconia&quot;, which are found in the Macaronesian laurel forests, are also known, from fossil evidence, to have flourished around the Mediterranean before the ice ages.

==Conservation issues==

Much of the original native vegetation has been displaced because of human activity, including felling forests for timber and firewood, clearing vegetation for grazing and agriculture, and introducing foreign plants and animals into the islands. The laurisilva habitat has been reduced to small disconnected pockets. As a result, many of the endemic biota of the islands are now seriously endangered or extinct.

Introduced predators – in particular domestic cats, many in feral populations – currently pose one of the most serious threats to the endemic fauna. Even though cats prey mostly on other foreign-introduced mammals, such as rodents and rabbits, the abundance of such prey sustains such a large feline population that it has initiated a so-called hyperpredation process, which further increases that population&#x27;s negative impact on the number of endemic reptiles and birds.

Since 2001, the European Union&#x27;s conservation efforts, mandated by its Natura 2000 regulations, have resulted in the protection of large stretches of land and sea in the Azores, Madeira, and the Canary Islands, totalling .

<doc id="398975" wikidata="Q949103" url="?curid=398975" title="List of political parties in Algeria">
<text>Algeria has a multi-party system with numerous political parties, in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form coalition governments. The Algerian Constitution of 1996 bans the formation of any party &quot;founded on a religious, linguistic, racial, sex, corporatist or regional basis&quot; or violating &quot;the fundamental liberties, the fundamental values and components of the national identity, the national unity, the security and integrity of the national territory, the independence of the country and the People&#x27;s sovereignty as well as the democratic and republican nature of the State.&quot;

In Arabic, French, and English, major Algerian political parties are typically referred to by the three or four initials of their French names. (The Movement of Society for Peace, which uses an Arabic acronym, is an exception.) In formal contexts, however, their full names are used.

<doc id="398976" wikidata="Q3296220" url="?curid=398976" title="Mary Morello">
<text>Mary Morello (born October 1, 1923) is an American activist who founded the anti-censorship group Parents for Rock and Rap in 1987.

==Early life==
Morello was born in 1923 in Marseilles, Illinois. In 1954, she earned a master&#x27;s degree in African and Latin American/Peru history at Loyola University in Chicago. She spent the rest of the decade teaching English in Germany, Peru, and Japan while once circling the globe on a freighter.

From 1960–63, Morello lived in Kenya where she married Ngethe Njoroge (brother of Njoroge Mungai and Jemimah Gecaga), an activist who promoted Kenyan independence from the British during the Mau Mau Uprising (1952–1960) and later became the first Kenyan delegate to the United Nations.

==Career==
In the 1960s, Morello was involved in the Civil Rights movement and the NAACP. She is a long-time activist for the Chicago Urban League. In 1964, she and her husband moved to Harlem, New York, where she gave birth to their son, Tom.

Morello and Ngethe divorced when Tom was one year old in 1965. Morello then moved with her son to Libertyville, Illinois, a small suburb north of Chicago. She took a job at Libertyville High School teaching social studies and US history. In 1987, she quit her teaching job of twenty-two years and founded Parents for Rock and Rap, an anti-censorship counterweight to Tipper Gore&#x27;s Parents Music Resource Center. She made three trips to the Soviet Union, through Siberia and Mongolia.

In 1991, Morello and many others battled against legislation being proposed in Congress titled &quot;Pornography Victims Compensation Act&quot;, numbered S. 983, or, later, S. 1521. The legislation was not enacted, in part because of grass-roots activism. On June 24, 1996, she received the Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award in Arts and Entertainment for her work with Parents for Rock and Rap.

In the fall of 1991, Morello began a volunteer teaching job at the Salvation Army Rehabilitation Center in Waukegan, Illinois, where she taught adult literacy. She was involved in the Cuba Coalition in Chicago, which works toward lifting the U.S. embargo against Cuba.

Morello is also known for her involvement in the 1999 debate on the incarceration of death row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal, convicted of the 1982 shooting of a Philadelphia police officer. In an editorial, she said: 

In 2007, Morello had a podcast together with Cindy Sheehan called &quot;The Mary Morello and Cindy Sheehan Show&quot;.

==Personal life==
Morello was married to Ngethe Njoroge, a Kenyan journalist and diplomat. They had one son, Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello in 1964, but divorced a year after he was born.

Morello turned 100 years old in October 2023.

==Public appearances==
Before Rage Against the Machine hit the stage at the Pinkpop Festival in 1994, Morello introduced them as the &quot;Best Band in the Fucking Universe&quot;. On August 24, 2007, for the Rage Against the Machine reunion, she appeared again. On September 13, 2016, at a Prophets of Rage concert, she introduced them as &quot;The best fucking band in the universe.&quot;

<doc id="398977" wikidata="Q5440242" url="?curid=398977" title="Federal Heights, Salt Lake City">
<text>Federal Heights is a neighborhood in Salt Lake City, Utah. It is generally considered as the residential area to the east of Virginia Street and to the north of South Temple Street in Salt Lake City. It abuts the Wasatch Mountains to the north, and the University of Utah to the south and east. Federal Heights is one of the more affluent neighborhoods in Salt Lake City, with many of the homes in the area dating to the early 20th century.
The name &quot;Federal Heights&quot; originates from the period between the Mormon settlers&#x27; establishment of Salt Lake City in 1847 and Utah&#x27;s admittance to the United States as a state in 1896. During this period of time, the federal government of the United States established Fort Douglas in the foothills of the Wasatch Mountains above Salt Lake City (not far from the present-day neighborhood) in order to keep an eye on the settlers. Through the efforts of Utah&#x27;s U.S. Senator Thomas Kearns (1901–1905), Fort Douglas became a regimental post. The officers of the fort established their homesteads to the north-east, creating the Federal Heights neighborhood.

Like much of the lower Avenues and Yalecrest areas, Federal Heights is largely made up of early 20th century revivalist style homes, with Tudor, Spanish Colonial, Norman/Romanesque, English Colonial, Moorish, and Mediterranean styles being the most common.

It gained notoriety when Elizabeth Smart disappeared from the neighborhood on June 5, 2002, and was later rescued (March 12, 2003) from her abductors, two homeless adults known as Brian David Mitchell and Wanda Ileen Barzee.

<text>YouthBuild Global is a non-profit organization that serves as headquarters for a network of more than 320 local YouthBuild programs around the world. These programs provide education, job training and leadership development to opportunity youth — young people between the ages 16 and 24 who are out of school or out of work. The headquarters are in Roxbury, Massachusetts.

The YouthBuild program has five components: construction, education, counseling, leadership, and graduate opportunity. Students spend every other week on a job site, learning the construction trade by building homes for their own communities. This creates housing for low-income people, and also gives the students marketable job skills. The alternate weeks are spent on education in the YouthBuild classroom, with the goal of attaining a GED or completing their high school diploma. Many YouthBuild students come directly from the streets or from difficult life situations, so counseling is available to help them deal with anger management, family responsibilities, and other adjustment / life direction issues. Leadership is taught explicitly in YouthBuild programs, based on the philosophy that young people are not a burden, but rather a resource to be tapped. This, combined with ensuring opportunity and placement for graduates, means that many YouthBuild graduates go on to college, work in the non-profit sector, serve on committees, or even run in local politics.

Funding for YouthBuild previously came primarily from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, but has transitioned to the Department of Labor. Other funding sources for programs are widely varied, but include other government agencies, private foundations, corporations, and individual donors.

Founded and directed by Dorothy Stoneman and John Bell, one of the main purposes of YouthBuild is to build affordable housing for low-income families. Since 1994, more than 19,000 homes have been built by 92,000 YouthBuild students.

<text>Scott Douglas Meyers (born April 9, 1959) is an American author and software consultant, specializing in the C++ computer programming language. He is known for his &quot;Effective C++&quot; book series. During his career, he was a frequent speaker at conferences and trade shows.

==Biography==
He holds a Ph.D. in computer science from Brown University and an M.S. in computer science from Stanford University.
He conceived and, with Herb Sutter, Andrei Alexandrescu, Dan Saks, and Steve Dewhurst, co-organized and presented the boutique (limited-attendance) conference, &quot;The C++ Seminar&quot;, which took place three times in 2001-2002. He also conceived and, with Sutter and Alexandrescu, co-organized and presented another boutique conference, &quot;C++ and Beyond&quot; annually in 2010-2014.

Meyers has expressed opposition to asking programmers to solve design or programming problems during job interviews:&quot;I hate anything that asks me to design on the spot. That&#x27;s asking to demonstrate a skill rarely required on the job in a high-stress environment, where it is difficult for a candidate to accurately prove their abilities. I think it&#x27;s fundamentally an unfair thing to request of a candidate.&quot;

In December 2015, Meyers announced his retirement from the world of C++.

<doc id="398985" wikidata="Q3271432" url="?curid=398985" title="List of political parties in Angola">
<text>The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) has ruled Angola since independence in 1975. From 1975 to 1991, it was the sole legally existing party in a political system inspired by the model then practised by the socialist countries of Eastern Europe. Since 1991/1992, a multiparty system exists, where the MPLA has been dominant because of the majority it won in the 1992 parliamentary and presidential elections. In the latter, it failed to obtain the required absolute majority for its candidate, José Eduardo dos Santos, and according to the constitution, a second round would have been necessary. The outbreak of the Angolan Civil War made this impossible, and José Eduardo dos Santos exercised presidential functions without a legal basis. For the same reason, the regular parliamentary elections stipulated by the constitution did not take place, and the parliament elected in 1992 remained in place for 16 years. While large sections of the interior were for years controlled by the armed forces of the rival movement National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) under the leadership of Jonas Savimbi, UNITA&#x27;s elected MPs were a regular part of the parliament, and for some years a government of national unity, led by the MPLA, also included members from the UNITA as well as from the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA), the third movement that had fought the independence war against Portuguese colonial rule.

In total, in 1992 as well as in 2008, the year of the second parliamentary elections, there were more than 120 registered political parties; only a handful had national constituencies, and only a few of them succeeded in having MPs elected for the National Assembly; see Elections in Angola. After any parliamentary elections, all parties that had not succeeded in receiving at least 0,5% of the votes were by law considered as automatically dissolved. Most of them become effectively defunct, while others re-emerge under different names.

==Current parties==
===Parties represented in the National Assembly===
MPLA. UNITA, and FNLA are outcomes of the three nationalist movements that fought the anti-colonial war against Portugal, 1961 to 1974, and then fought each other in the civil war, 1975–2002. While the MPLA became a political party at independence, in 1975, the two others acquired this status in 1991, on the basis of the democratic constitution adopted at that stage. In the 1992 parliamentary elections, the MPLA obtained an absolute majority (53%), but the FNLA, and particularly UNITA, also conquered substantial numbers of seats—keeping the newly formed parties at a distance. However, in the 2008 elections the victory of the MPLA (82%) was overwhelming, so that UNITA (10%) was reduced to the category of a smaller party. Since then, the MPLA won a majority in every parliamentary election, however the majority got smaller with every single election. UNITA on the other hand has over the years risen in popularity and became the biggest opposition to MPLA. In the latest election in 2022 the MPLA (51%) won a majority once again, and UNITA (44%) has remained the second biggest party. All the other parties (PRS, FNLA, PHA) currently represented in parliament got around 1% of the votes. 

===Other parties===

*Party of the United Struggle for Africans in Angola (&quot;Partido da Luta Unida dos Africanos de Angola&quot;)
NB: With the exception of FpD (now refunded as Democratic Forum), these were not organizations constituted as political parties in terms of the 1991 constitution, and thus did not take part in any elections since the first multi-party elections in 1992.

<doc id="398987" wikidata="Q560751" url="?curid=398987" title="Radbod of Frisia">
<text>Radbod (died 719) was the king (or duke) of Frisia from c. 680 until his death. He is often considered the last independent ruler of Frisia before Frankish domination. He defeated Charles Martel at Cologne. Eventually, Charles prevailed and compelled the Frisians to submit. Radbod died in 719, but for some years his successors struggled against the Frankish power.

== King or duke ==
What the exact title of the Frisian rulers was depends on the source. Frankish sources tend to call them dukes; other sources often call them kings.

== Reign ==
While his predecessor, Aldgisl, had welcomed Christianity into his realm, Radbod attempted to extirpate the religion and gain independence from the kingdom of the Franks. In 689, however, Radbod was defeated by Pepin of Herstal in the battle of Dorestad and compelled to cede Frisia Citerior (Nearer Frisia, from the Scheldt to the Vlie) to the Franks.

Between 690 and 692, Utrecht fell into the hands of Pepin. This gave the Franks control of important trade routes on the Rhine to the North Sea. Some sources say that, following this defeat, Radbod retreated, in 697, to the island of Heligoland. Others say he retreated to the part of the Netherlands that is still known as Friesland.

Around this time there was an Archbishopric or bishopric of the Frisians founded for Willibrord and a marriage was held between Grimoald the Younger, the oldest son of Pepin, and Thiadsvind, the daughter of Radbod in 711.

On Pepin&#x27;s death in 714, Radbod took the initiative again. He forced Saint Willibrord and his monks to flee and advanced as far as Cologne, where he defeated Charles Martel, Pepin&#x27;s natural son, in 716. Eventually, however, Charles prevailed and compelled the Frisians to submit. Radbod died in 719, but for some years his successors struggled against the Frankish power.

As an example of how powerful King Radbod still was at the end of his life, the news that he was engaged in assembling an army was reportedly enough to fill the Frankish kingdom with fear and trembling.

== Relation with the Catholic Church ==
During the second journey of Saint Boniface to Rome, Wulfram, a monk and ex-archbishop of Sens, tried to convert Radbod, but after an unsuccessful attempt he returned to Fontenelle. It is said that Radbod was nearly baptised but refused when he was told that he would not be able to find any of his ancestors in Heaven after his death. He said he preferred spending eternity in Hell with his pagan ancestors than in Heaven with a pack of beggars. This legend is also told with Wulfram being replaced with bishop Willibrord.

== Legacy ==
Saint Radboud was a descendant of Radbod. Saint Radboud was a bishop of Utrecht who adopted his ancestor&#x27;s native name. The Nijmegen University and its corresponding medical facility were named after him in 2004.

In Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot; a certain &quot;Radbod, ruler of the Frisians&quot; is mentioned as Ortrud&#x27;s ancestor.

In Harry Harrison&#x27;s &quot;The Hammer and the Cross&quot; series of novels, Radbod becomes the founder of &quot;the Way&quot;, an organized pagan cult, created to combat the efforts of Christian missionaries.

Black metal band Ophidian Forest recorded a concept album &quot;Redbad&quot; in 2007.

Dutch folk metal band &#x27;Heidevolk&#x27; recorded a song &#x27;Koning Radboud&#x27; (King Radbod) on their 2008 album &#x27;Walhalla Wacht&#x27; singing about the legend of Wulfram and Radbod.

In 2015 the Frisian Folk-Metal band Baldrs Draumar released a full album on the life and deeds of king Redbad called Aldgillissoan. It is based on the book Rêdbâd, Kronyk fan in Kening (Chronicles of a King) by Willem Schoorstra.

In 2018, Dutch production company Farmhouse released a film, &quot;Redbad&quot;, based on Radbod. It is directed by Roel Reiné and stars Jonathan Banks and Søren Malling alongside a variety of Dutch actors.

<text>Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík (MR; official name in English: Reykjavik Junior College) is a junior college in Iceland. It is located in Reykjavík.

The school traces its origin to 1056, when a school was established in Skálholt, and it remains one of the oldest institutions in Iceland. The school was moved to Reykjavík in 1786, but poor housing conditions forced it to move again in 1805 to Bessastaðir near Reykjavík. In 1846 the school was moved to its current location, and a new building was erected for it in Reykjavík. This was the largest building in the country at the time and can be seen on the 500 Icelandic krona bill. It was used initially when Althing began to meet again in Reykjavík after a few years hiatus and thus it is in this building where Icelandic independence leader Jón Sigurðsson led the MPs in their famous phrase, &quot;Vér mótmælum allir&quot;.

The school has previously been known as &quot;Lærði skólinn&quot; (The Learned School), &quot;Latínuskólinn&quot; (The Latin School) and by the Latin title &quot;Schola Reykjavicensis&quot;; it received its present name in 1937.

Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík offers a three-year course of study. It usually ends with a degree (&quot;stúdentspróf&quot;) which gives the graduating student the right to advance to an Icelandic university.

Many Icelandic politicians, including the first prime minister Hannes Hafstein, former Prime Minister Davíð Oddsson, former President of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson and current president, Guðni Th. Jóhannesson all attended MR. Almost every Prime Minister of Iceland has been educated at the school apart from Halldór Ásgrímsson, Ólafur Jóhannesson, Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson, Þorsteinn Pálsson, Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir and Katrín Jakobsdóttir. Geir H. Haarde, Davíð&#x27;s successor as chairman of the Independence Party and former Prime Minister, also took over from him as chairman of student body, &quot;Skólafélagið&quot; (inspector scholae). In 1879 Hannes Hafstein was the school&#x27;s first inspector scholae, and in 1940 his grandson Einar Ragnarsson Kvaran achieved the position. The former President of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, was also the president of the main student body, &quot;Framtíðin&quot;.

==Culture and traditions==
School traditions include a hall fight and the singing of the Brevitate Vitae. Six dances are held every year, including the costume-ball and the freshman-ball. Many clubs have been founded in MR, these include: An Art club (with five divisions for: Visual art, music, dancing, literature and films), Herranótt acting guild (the oldest theatric club in northern Europe), Computer academy and a Nerd club (which merged and became known as The Academy), Traveller&#x27;s club, Sport&#x27;s club, Riding club, Science club, Novelist club, Chess club and the Rowing club (which was historically a club for rowing, but is now a male/female-cheerleading team).

===The Hall Fight===
Every year at the end of spring semester the students of MR organize a fight in the halls of the main building. A bell is placed on the ground floor of the building and the seniors aim to reach that bell and ring it while other students try to fight them and prevent them from doing so. Should the seniors succeed in their task, the younger students are to attend next class. During the fight, some or all senior students are covered in dirt. This event was cancelled permanently after the 2008-2009 Inspector Platearum (a senior student who is responsible for ringing the school bells and is furthermore the leader of the seniors in the Hall Fight) broke his neck in the fight, resulting in a 9 million ISK lawsuit.

===The Freshmen Day===
One day in the first weeks of school is a special day for newcomers (Icelandic: busadagur), this day is held in all junior colleges in the country and is not only the tradition of Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík, although the traditions regarding this day vary greatly between schools. The day starts with the seniors dressing up in white toga cloaks and painting their faces. The seniors then march around the school and gather the newcomers out to the school grounds where they are then thrown high into the air. The tradition of throwing newcomers into the air is old - but the part of dressing up in toga was added by seniors in 1991 (graduating in 1992). On this day (and the next few days after) students tend to sing the song &quot;De Brevitate Vitae.&quot; The following night a freshman ball is held.

===The Violin Dance (Fiðluballið)===
The violin dance is by many described as a fancy promenade ball where live violin music is played and students wear their best garments while dancing elegantly. The tradition was started in the 1960s and was meant to be an iconoclasm to the hippie culture at the time. Reverend Geir Waage is rumored to have been the originator of the dance. It was only held once, although in 1992 it was resurrected by Dagur B. Eggertsson, inspector scholae. It is now an annual event for graduating students.

===Publications===
The two student bodies maintain a number of periodic publications. Amongst them are:
* Skólablaðið Skinfaxi - Articles about the past year; published annually. Contains two publications, &quot;Skólablaðið&quot; and &quot;Skinfaxi&quot;, respectably, which have been published jointly since 2009. &quot;Skinfaxi&quot; was first published in 1898 and &quot;Skólablaðið&quot; in 1925.
* Loki Laufeyjarson - A similar publication to Menntaskólatíðindi, but published by Framtíðin, the student body.
* Menntaskólatíðindi - A newspaper about daily life and events in the school; published roughly once every month by the new student body Skólafélagið.
* De Rerum Natura - A scientific magazine published by the science club every year. Named after Lucretius&#x27; De Rerum Natura. It was first published in 1960, under the presidency of Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, who later became president of Iceland.
* Yggdrasill &amp; The Novelist News - Two magazines published by the Novelist club every year.
* Vetur - An annual photographic newspaper with pictures of students, daily life and social life in MR.
* Businn - A monthly newspaper for freshmen, written by juniors for juniors.
* Idus Martii - An annual magazine about history, ancient languages and classics. Published by 2nd year students of the classical language department on the Ides of March.
* Morkinskinna - Published annually in the beginning of autumn. A handbook containing information about the school and its students and a study diary. Named after Morkinskinna.

===Debating===
Framtíðin, the oldest student body in Iceland, is a member of &quot;Mælsku- og rökræðukeppni framhaldsskóla á Íslandi&quot; (MorfÍs, The Icelandic Junior College Debating Society), which holds an annual debating competition between Icelandic junior colleges. Since its foundation in 1983, MR has won the finals eight times. The students of MR regularly hold debating competitions among themselves. These competitions are held very often and a lot of traditions have evolved around them. &quot;Framtíðin&quot; administers the debating society for MR students and it is also one of the oldest clubs in Iceland (founded in 1883). Sólbjartur is an annual debating competition in which each class of MR is free to send one or more teams to debate. The winning team receives the title &quot;Sólbjartur&quot; (Literally: Sun-bright) and the best debater of the winning team receives the title &quot;Orator Scholae&quot; (Latin: Spokesman of the school). Another annual competition is held, called &quot;Orator Minor&quot; (Latin: The next-best spokesman). Orator Minor is a competition where people debate about randomly selected subjects in one-on-one battles and only have ten minutes to prepare their speeches. However, Orator Minor, from the year 2007, is held more than once every year, even up to five times.

===Quizzing===
MR has been the most successful school on RÚV&#x27;s academic quiz competition &quot;Gettu betur&quot;; it has been champion in 23 series of the programme, with its most recent occurring in 2023. This included an 11-year winning streak from 1993 to 2003. An annual quiz competition is held, for which each class sends in one or more teams to compete against others. This competition is called &quot;Ratatoskur&quot;, named after the famous squirrel from Nordic mythology.

===MR-ví===
One day in October each year, the students of MR and its rival school, &quot;Verzlunarskóli Íslands&quot; (Commercial College of Iceland) or &quot;Verzlo&quot; as it is often referred to as, meet in the &quot;Hljómskálagarður&quot; park, located in downtown Reykjavík, where various games and competitions are held. These include: sprinting, soccer, rowing, giant-chess (later replaced with ordinary chess), screaming, tug-o-war, competitive eating, arm wrestling, car stuffing and the infamous Mexican-run. The night of that day, a debating competition between the two schools is held.

== Education ==
MR is renowned for its traditional and classical style of education.

MR offers two separate &quot;paths&quot; which students choose when enrolling in the school. These are a natural science path and a language path. The natural science path divides into a biology department and a physics department on the second year, while the language path divides into modern language department and a classical language department. MR is the only school in Iceland which teaches mandatory Latin in some form and the only one which teaches Ancient Greek.

In earlier years the school offered a six years course of study before it was shortened into four years. Thus the first year is called &quot;third form&quot;, the second year is called &quot;fourth form&quot; and so on. However, in 2016 the school was shortened even more to only three years, with the first three-years graduates graduating May 2019 along with the last round of graduates in the four years system.

==Housing==
The number of students has grown rapidly since the founding of the school. This has led to the expanding of the school&#x27;s housing. The flagship and main building of the school is still the front house, Gamli Skóli (literally: The Old School), which was built in 1846. Several houses and additions have been built since. These buildings include:
* Íþaka (Ithaca) is the library and study hall of MR. It was built in 1867 as a gift to Icelanders from Charles Kelsall, a wealthy English merchant. It takes its name from Ithaca, New York, the home of professor Willard Fiske that started a book club at the school. It went under major restorations from 2018 to 2020 where most of its interior was rebuilt. After the restoration, the reading hall and library swapped floors. The library is now located at the ground floor and the reading hall moved to the attic.
* Fjósið (The Cowshed) is a small wooden house with two classrooms. It was originally used to store fire-fighting equipment and later used to house the rector&#x27;s cows.
* Íþróttahöllin (The Sports-Palace) is the oldest sports hall in Iceland and for a long time it was the biggest one, although it is thought to be very small and outdated by today&#x27;s standards. In fact it is so small that the basketball penalty boxes overlap.
* Þrælakistan (The Sweatshop) is a very small building connected to the Sports-Palace. It is a small gym and currently contains modern weight-lifting equipment but has historically contained antiquated equipment.
* Casa Christi (Latin: House of Christ) is an old building with several classrooms. It is relatively big compared to other houses in the area. This building was once used by the Reykjavík YMCA, thus the name &quot;Casa Christi&quot;. It is thought to be ugly and in bad condition and has been noted by the students and faculty as smelling distinctly of chlorine. The building is due for demolition in the near future for a new and better building to be constructed. A movement within the school has surfaced, demanding a change of name for this building. One suggestion is &quot;Casa Sophiae&quot;, (Greek: House of Wisdom), which reflects how the nation is becoming more and more secular.
* Casa Nova (Latin: New House) is a relatively young building and the largest one in the complex. It has many classrooms and is also the center for the students&#x27; social gatherings. A comfort lounge and a cafeteria is located in the basement of the building. It was originally built in the 1960s but underwent major restoration in 2006.
* Villa Nova (Latin: New Apartment) is the groundskeeper&#x27;s shed and a storage room for the school. It also used to house the offices of the student bodies before Amtmannsstígur 2 was taken into service.
* Elísabetarhús (Elizabeth&#x27;s House) also known as &quot;Minni Elísabetar&quot; (Memoirs of Elizabeth) is the latest addition to the school&#x27;s housing. It has several classrooms, including some of the most perfect educational laboratories in Iceland. Known as &quot;Casa Subuculae&quot; before it was fully taken into service. It was a gift from the former owner of the house, whose wife, Elísabet, had recently died.
* Amtmannsstígur 2 is the teachers&#x27; lounge. It also houses offices and serves as a meeting place for the student bodies.
* Menntaskólaselið or simply &quot;selið&quot;, built 1938, is a house little outside of Reykjavík (around 45 minutes), close to the southern town of Hveragerði. It is a rural dwelling used for student trips and vacations. It was used for the first time in ten years in 2011 after having been closed due to its bad state. Since then it has been used extensively by the school&#x27;s choir, and a geology trip for the freshmen once per year.

<text>Zelenogradsk (; ; ; Lithuanian and Old Prussian: &quot;Krantas&quot;) is a town and the administrative center of Zelenogradsky District in Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia, located north of Kaliningrad, on the Sambian coastline near the Curonian Spit on the Baltic Sea. Population: 

In its heyday, Zelenogradsk (as &quot;Cranz&quot;) was a popular seaside resort on Germany&#x27;s eastern Baltic coast, comparable to Bognor Regis in England. However, at the end of World War II, the Soviets took over the town, and much of its tourist traffic has been diverted to nearby Svetlogorsk.

==History==
The site of today&#x27;s Zelenogradsk was originally an Old Prussian fishing village, in the proximity of Kaup, a Prussian town on the coast of the Baltic Sea in the Viking era. The area became controlled by the Teutonic Order and settled with Germans. The German name &quot;Cranz&quot;, originally &quot;Cranzkuhren&quot;, derives from the Old Prussian word &quot;krantas&quot;, meaning &quot;the coast&quot;. In 1466, the territory became a part of Poland as a fief held by the Teutonic Knights. For most of its history, it remained a small village.
From the 18th century it formed part of the Kingdom of Prussia, in 1758–1762 it was under Russian control, and from 1871 it was also part of Germany, within which it was administratively located in the province of East Prussia. During the 19th century, Cranz became the primary seaside resort for the Kingdom of Prussia on the East Prussian coastline, especially after the construction of a railway line connecting it with Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) in 1885. From 1816 to 1895, it was known as &quot;das königliche Bad&quot;, or &quot;the royal bathing resort&quot;. In the late 19th century, the settlement was inhabited by more than 1,000 people, mainly living off tourism, however, the fishing industry remained strong. There was trade in flounder and salmon; smoked flounder was a regional delicacy. Two annual fairs were held, usually in July and August. Although Cranz had over 6,000 inhabitants by the start of World War II, it has not yet received a town charter.

The area was overrun by the Soviet Red Army during World War II and annexed to the Russian SFSR, although it suffered minimally through warfare. The German population fled during the evacuation of East Prussia or was subsequently expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. Cranz was renamed Zelenogradsk in 1946 and was granted town status in the subsequent years.

In 2015, a monument of poet Adam Mickiewicz was erected in the town to commemorate his visit in 1824.

==Administrative and municipal status==

Within the framework of administrative divisions, Zelenogradsk serves as the administrative center of Zelenogradsky District. As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Zelenogradsky District as the town of district significance of Zelenogradsk.

Within the framework of municipal divisions, since May 15, 2015, the territories of the town of district significance of Zelenogradsk and of four rural okrugs of Zelenogradsky District are incorporated as Zelenogradsky Urban Okrug. Before that, the town of district significance was incorporated within Zelenogradsky Municipal District as Zelenogradskoye Urban Settlement.
==Tourism==

The tourism industry was neglected during the Cold War and Zelenogradsk&#x27;s tourism primacy was relinquished to nearby Svetlogorsk.

==Notable people==
*Adolf Tortilowicz von Batocki-Friebe (1868–1944), politician
*Abel Ehrlich (1915–2003), composer

<text>Svetlogorsk (; ; ) is a coastal resort town and the administrative center of Svetlogorsky District of Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia, located on the coast of the Baltic Sea on the Sambia Peninsula, northwest of Kaliningrad. In the 2021 census, it had a population of: .

==History==
Svetlogorsk is situated in the historical region of Sambia in Prussia. It was established in 1258 as a Sambian fisherman settlement named Ruse-moter (lit. &quot;region of cellars&quot;). The Teutonic Order that conquered the land gradually corrupted the name into Rause-moter, Raushe-moter, and finally &quot;Rauschen&quot;. The Teutonic Order set a new direction for the life of the village: they blocked off the Katzenbach stream, which flows into the lake, and installed a mill on the stream. From that time on, the lake became known as Mühlen-teich (Mill Pond), and the mill business became the main one for the inhabitants of the village. During the Order&#x27;s times it was the largest mill in Sambia. After the subsequent Thirteen Years&#x27; War (1454–1466), the settlement was a part of the Polish fief held by the Teutonic Knights until 1525, and by secular Ducal Prussia until 1657. From 1701 it was part of the Kingdom of Prussia.

In the early 19th century, the place became fashionable among German vacationers. Since access to the sea was hampered by a sand dune, the picturesque corners of the lake were the place of residence and recreation. A tavern was opened near the mill, new villas and boarding houses were built. On June 24, 1820, it was officially recognized as a spa town. During his visit to Rauschen in 1840, King Frederick William IV of Prussia ordered the sea embankment to be beautified. From 1871, it was part of the German Empire. The popularity of the town as a resort has grown significantly since 1900, when a railway was built from Königsberg to Rauschen / Orth station, extended in 1906 to Rauschen / Dune station, which made the resort more accessible for many residents of Königsberg. The city’s development as a resort was enhanced when the equestrian society built a hippodrome. The town began to divide into the lower section - near the lake, and the upper section (40–50 m higher) by the sea. The upper village was approximately 60 m above sea level. In 1912 a funicular was built: a 90-meter inclined railroad to transport patrons to the sea and back.

In 1908, the resort was further enhanced by improving the beach areas with a wooden promenade built on the seashore on stilts, with several serpentine descents accessing the walkway. Otto Nicolai, Wilhelm von Humboldt, Käthe Kollwitz and Thomas Mann were among the celebrities who stayed there.

In the early years of the 20th century, private individuals launched an intensive construction in Rauschen of country houses, villas and boarding houses, especially in the upper part of the resort. The architecture of these buildings included half-timbered, neo-Gothic, and fashionable historicism, added to the beauty of the resort. In 1928, the villa of the architect Goering (namesake of the Reichsmarschall) was built in the center of Rauschen, becoming a kind of symbol of the city.

In 1900-1908, a tower of a hydrotherapy was erected in the style of national romanticism.

In addition to water treatment, sea, carbon dioxide and other baths, the sanatorium institutions of the city practiced mud, electric light treatment and therapeutic massage. Under the helmet-shaped roof of the tower there was an observation deck for viewing the countryside. Some buildings of the city were built by a charitable society, which consisted of local and visiting entrepreneurs and a wealthy part of the intelligentsia. They built, for example, a home for elderly teachers and a church erected in 1903-1907. The church was consecrated on July 7, 1907, it was built according to the project of architects Vihman and Kukuk in the neo-Romanesque style with elements of Art Nouveau. The attraction of the church was a carved wooden altar. Since 1841, this charitable society, together with the resort residents, has been printing the newspaper &quot;Hospitable Raushenets&quot;.

During the First World War, Rauschen became a &quot;branch&quot; of the German military department — civilians were almost displaced by German officers who were being treated and were recuperating.

On 14 April 1945, Rauschen was conquered by the Soviet Union in the course of World War II. It became a part of Kaliningrad Oblast and on 17 June 1947 was given its present name of Svetlogorsk.

On 16 May 1972, a tragedy occurred when an Antonov An-24 crashed into the Svetlogorsk kindergarten, killing 33 people.

In 1994, an urban district was formed, which also included the village of Yantarny and the Primorye settlement Council. The boundaries of the district were clarified in 1999. In 2007, the Svetlogorsk city district was granted the status of a municipal district, and Svetlogorsk was defined as its administrative center, three urban settlements were formed as part of the district, including the urban settlement of the city of Svetlogorsk. In 2018, the urban settlements were merged. In 2019, Svetlogorsk was awarded the status of a city of regional significance.

Today, it is a moderately popular summer resort town thanks to its beachfront and many spas, clubs, and attractions. It has arguably the best preserved Prussian heritage and architecture amongst former Soviet towns that were once Prussian and was spared the destruction suffered by Königsberg and other settlements in World War II.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Svetlogorsk serves as the administrative center of Svetlogorsky District. As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Svetlogorsky District as the town of district significance of Svetlogorsk. As a municipal division, the town of district significance of Svetlogorsk is incorporated within Svetlogorsky Municipal District as Svetlogorskoye Urban Settlement.

==Attractions ==

=== Water Tower ===

The water tower built in the early 20th century according to the project of the Prussian architect Otto Kukkuk from reinforced concrete structures. Being the tallest building of Raushen at that time, the 25-meter tower became the central point organizing the space of the city center, a kind of &quot;town hall&quot;. The water in the hospital came from a tank, where it was previously pumped directly from the sea. Warm baths were intended mainly for those patients who could not go down to the water on their own on a steep slope.

=== The Zodiac sundial ===

Zodiac sundial with a diameter of 10.1 meters. The work was carried out by a team of authors under the direction of sculptor Nikolai Pavlovich Frolov. It was installed in Svetlogorsk on the embankment in 1974 for the originality of the composition and the accuracy of the time display.

=== Nymph ===

The sculpture of a young nymph girl is a memorable symbols of Svetlogorsk. The statue stands on the promenade, decorating the exit to the embankment from a long staircase leading from the city center.Sculpture created by Herman Branch “Nymph”. The creator of the sculpture is the German sculptor Herman Brachert, who lived and worked in the village of Otradnoye for more than 10 years.

=== Promenade ===
The embankment of the promenade with a length of over 1 km is decorated with unusual sculptural compositions — a bronze statue of a mermaid surrounded by fish and a statue of a naked nymph in a mother-of-pearl shell resting on mosaic waves of turquoise hue. The space separating the sculptural forms is filled with benches with semicircular canopies to protect from the sun and rain: here you can access the Internet for free via Wi-Fi.

=== Frog Princess ===
The sculpture &quot;Frog Princess&quot;, created by the artist Oleg Melekhov, is a symbol of the city of modern times. An elegant and thin female figure, depicted in the form of a frog, is installed in a park near the railway station. The sculpture is a symbol of incessant movement, emphasized by the plasticity of a young girl. For Svetlogorsk, sculpture has become an image of rebirth, a new stage in the life of the city.

=== Quiet lake ===

The first vacationers came here for the sake of a mild therapeutic climate and settled on the shore of the Mullenteich pond — the current lake Tikhoe. They lived in the houses of local fishermen, enjoyed nature and occasionally climbed a sand dune to get to the sea water. In the middle of the 19th century, the first hotel and cafe were already opened near the lake, and soon they began to build up the current city center, where all the infrastructure was gradually moved. And the lake remained a quiet and peaceful corner with clean air and rich coastal vegetation.

=== Wheel of History ===
The exhibition-museum &quot;Wheel of History&quot; opened in Svetlogorsk on February 1, 2014, there is a permanent exhibition &quot;Raushen - Svetlogorsk&quot;, telling about the history of the city.The exhibition presents cultural and everyday objects, rare photographs and other exhibits that tell about life, recreation, crafts and people who lived, created and loved this wonderful place on the Sambia Peninsula.

=== Cable car ===

The Svetlogorsk cable car is one of the main symbols of this resort city. With the help of it, you can climb from the sandy beach to the hills with the main urban infrastructure. If for young healthy people it is rather an attraction, then for the elderly, sick or just tired it is a necessity, because the height difference in Svetlogorsk reaches 40 m, the descent and ascent are very steep. The funicular overcomes the 175 m long path in one direction in 5 minutes. The cabins are closed, each can withstand a weight of up to 160 kg. Usually there is a queue in front of the entrance, so it&#x27;s worth getting ready to wait about 15 minutes.

== Transportation ==
The Svetlogorsk-1 and Svetlogorsk-2 stations of the Kaliningrad Railway are located in Svetlogorsk. These stations belong to two railway branches of the Kaliningrad — Pereslavskoye — Pionersky — Svetlogorsk-1 — Svetlogorsk-2 direct line and the Kaliningrad — Zelenogradsk — Pionersky — Svetlogorsk-1 — Svetlogorsk-2 rokadnaya line. At the peak of the popularity of Svetlogorsk in the 1980s, in the summer, every day, full-composite trains went from Kaliningrad to Svetlogorsk and back every 20 minutes, they traveled an average of 45 minutes, a ticket cost 35 kopecks, a travel ticket for a month — 2 rubles. 20 kopecks. Then many Kaliningrad residents, having bought a monthly travel ticket, went to the sea in the summer not only on weekends, but also after work: in the evening to sunbathe for a couple of hours-to swim. In 2013, in the summer, only nine 4-6-car trains a day plied from Kaliningrad (Yuzhny Railway Station) to Svetlogorsk and back, they travel an average of 1 hour. The Svetlogorsk — Zelenogradsk — Kaliningrad train runs once a day. This provides additional opportunities for lovers of high-quality and diverse beach holidays. There is a bus stop near the Svetlogorsk-2 train station, from which buses run to Kaliningrad, Otradnoye.

In August 2008, the construction of the Primorsky Ring highway began, which significantly shortened the way from Svetlogorsk to Khrabrovo Airport, about 30 km. In 2012, the Primorsky Ring was completed to Svetlogorsk and has a branch to Pionerskoye. Further construction of the Primorsky Ring in the direction of the Amber is frozen. The launch of the Primorsky Ring made it possible to unload the old German highway Svetlogorsk — Pereslavskoye — Kaliningrad, which had the fame of a very dangerous road. Despite the slightly longer length of the highway, 45 kilometers on the new road versus 35 kilometers on the old road, the permitted speed of 110 km/ h will significantly reduce the travel time to Kaliningrad. Two lanes in each direction and separated oncoming traffic make driving along the Primorsky Ring much safer and more enjoyable for drivers and passengers.

The city is connected by bus with Kaliningrad, Baltic, Zelenograd and Khrabrovo International Airport.

<text>Margalit Ruth &quot;Maggie&quot; Gyllenhaal ( , ; born November 16, 1977) is an American actress and filmmaker. Part of the Gyllenhaal family, she is the daughter of filmmakers Stephen Gyllenhaal and Naomi Achs, and the older sister of actor Jake Gyllenhaal.

She began her career as a teenager with small roles in several of her father&#x27;s films, and appeared with her brother in the thriller &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; (2001). She then appeared in &quot;Adaptation,&quot; &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot; (both 2002), and &quot;Mona Lisa Smile&quot; (2003). Gyllenhaal received praise for her leading performances in the dramas &quot;Secretary&quot; (2002) and &quot;Sherrybaby&quot; (2006), each of which earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination. She had commercial success in the thriller &quot;World Trade Center&quot; (2006), and received wider recognition for playing Rachel Dawes in the superhero film &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; (2008).

For her performance as a single mother in &quot;Crazy Heart&quot; (2009), she received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She subsequently starred in the films &quot;Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang&quot; (2010), &quot;Hysteria&quot; (2011), &quot;Won&#x27;t Back Down&quot; (2012), &quot;White House Down&quot; (2013), &quot;Frank&quot; (2014), and &quot;The Kindergarten Teacher&quot; (2018). She has starred in several television series, including the BBC political-thriller miniseries &quot;The Honourable Woman&quot; (2014), which won her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress and a nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award. She also produced and starred in the HBO period drama series &quot;The Deuce&quot; (2017–2019). 

Gyllenhaal made her writing and directing debut with the psychological drama &quot;The Lost Daughter&quot; (2021), for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. She has also appeared in five stage productions since 2000, including making her Broadway debut in a revival of &quot;The Real Thing.&quot; Gyllenhaal has been married to actor Peter Sarsgaard since 2009 and they have two children together.

==Early life==
Margalit Ruth Gyllenhaal was born in Manhattan, New York City, on November 16, 1977, to Naomi Achs and Stephen Gyllenhaal. The first name on Maggie&#x27;s birth certificate is &quot;Margalit&quot;, which she did not discover until 2013, when adopting her husband&#x27;s surname. &quot;Margalit&quot; () is a Hebrew word meaning &quot;pearl&quot;; some news stories have spelled it &quot;Margolit&quot;. She has a younger brother, actor Jake Gyllenhaal, and a half-brother, Luke, from their father&#x27;s second marriage.

Her father is a film director and poet, and her mother is a screenwriter and director. Her father, a member of the noble Gyllenhaal family, is of Swedish and English ancestry, and was raised in the Swedenborgian religion. Her last native Swedish ancestor was her great-great-grandfather Anders Leonard Gyllenhaal, a descendant of Leonard Gyllenhaal, a leading Swedenborgian who supported the printing and spreading of Swedenborg&#x27;s writings.

Her mother was born in New York City (growing up in Brooklyn), and is Jewish, from Ashkenazi Jewish families that emigrated from Russia and Poland. Her mother&#x27;s first husband was Eric Foner, a noted historian and history professor at Columbia University. Gyllenhaal has stated that she &quot;grew up mostly Jewish, culturally&quot;, and she identifies as Jewish, though she did not attend Hebrew school. Her parents married in 1977, and filed for divorce in October 2008.

Gyllenhaal grew up in Los Angeles and studied at the Harvard–Westlake prep school. She spent four months as a student at The Mountain School, a semester school for high school juniors in Vermont. In 1995, she graduated from Harvard–Westlake and moved to New York to attend Columbia University, where she studied literature and Eastern religions. She also studied acting for a summer term at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London, England.

==Career==

=== 1992–2001: Early work ===
At the age of 15, she made a brief appearance in her father&#x27;s film &quot;Waterland&quot; (1992). Soon, she had supporting roles in &quot;A Dangerous Woman&quot; (1993) and &quot;Homegrown&quot; (1998), which were directed by her father and also featured her brother Jake. With their mother, she and Jake appeared in two episodes of &quot;Molto Mario&quot;, an Italian cooking show on the Food Network. After graduating from college, she had supporting roles in films including &quot;Cecil B. Demented&quot; (2000) and &quot;Riding in Cars with Boys&quot; (2001). Gyllenhaal later achieved recognition in her own right playing her real brother&#x27;s on-screen sister in the indie cult favorite &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; (2001).

She made her theatrical debut in the Berkeley Repertory Theatre production of Patrick Marber&#x27;s &quot;Closer&quot;, for which she received favorable reviews. Production started in May 2000 and ended in mid-July of that year. Gyllenhaal has performed in several other plays, including &quot;The Tempest&quot;, &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, &quot;The Butterfly Project&quot;, and &quot;No Exit&quot;.

===2002–2005: Film breakthrough===
Gyllenhaal&#x27;s breakout role was in the black comedy, &quot;Secretary&quot; (2002), a film about two people who embark on a mutually fulfilling BDSM lifestyle. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Stephen Holden noted: &quot;The role of Lee, which Maggie Gyllenhaal imbues with a restrained comic delicacy and sweetness, should make her a star.&quot; Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote: &quot;Maggie Gyllenhaal, as the self-destructive secretary, is enigmatic and, at moments, sympathetic.&quot; The film received generally favorable reviews, and Gyllenhaal&#x27;s performance earned her the Best Breakthrough Performance by an Actress award from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, her first Golden Globe nomination, and an Independent Spirit Award nomination. &quot;Secretary&quot; was Gyllenhaal&#x27;s first film role which featured full frontal nudity. Impressed with the script, she initially had reservations about doing the film, which she believed could deliver an anti-feminist message. However, after carefully discussing the script with the film&#x27;s director, Steven Shainberg, she agreed to join the project. Although insisting Shainberg did not exploit her, Gyllenhaal has said she felt &quot;scared when filming began&quot; and that &quot;in the wrong hands ... even in just slightly less intelligent hands, this movie could say something really weird.&quot; Since then, she is guarded about discussing her role in the film, saying only that &quot;despite myself, sometimes the dynamic that you are exploring in your work spills over into your life.&quot;Next, she had a supporting role in the comedy-drama &quot;Adaptation&quot; (2002), a film that tells the story of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s struggle to adapt &quot;The Orchid Thief&quot; into a film. She later appeared in the unauthorized biography &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot; (2002), part of an ensemble cast that included Sam Rockwell, Drew Barrymore, George Clooney, and Julia Roberts. The movie grossed US$33 million worldwide. That same year, she had a small role in the comedy &quot;40 Days and 40 Nights&quot;. In 2003, she co-starred with Julia Roberts in &quot;Mona Lisa Smile&quot; in the role of Giselle. In an interview with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, she revealed the reason for accepting the role was &quot;to play somebody who feels confident in herself as a sexy, beautiful woman&quot;. The film generated mostly mixed reviews, with Manohla Dargis of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; describing it as &quot;smug and reductive&quot;. Her next roles were in smaller independent films: &quot;Casa de los Babys&quot; (2003), is a story about six American women impatiently waiting out their lengthy residency requirements in a South American country before picking up their adoptive babies, and &quot;Criminal&quot; (2004), a remake of the Argentinian film &quot;Nine Queens&quot;, with John C. Reilly and Diego Luna. Gyllenhaal plays an honest hotel manager forced to help her crooked brother (Reilly) by seducing one of his victims.

She starred in the HBO film &quot;Strip Search&quot; (2004), in which she portrayed an American student in China suspected of terrorism. For her role, Gyllenhaal had to perform multiple scenes of full-frontal nudity as the film tackled issues of strip searches. In 2004, Gyllenhaal returned to theater in a Los Angeles production of Tony Kushner&#x27;s &quot;Homebody/ Kabul&quot; as Priscilla, the Homebody&#x27;s daughter, who spends most of the play searching for her elusive mother in Kabul, Afghanistan. Kushner gave her the role in &quot;Homebody/ Kabul&quot; on the strength of her performance in &quot;Closer&quot;. Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Ms. Gyllenhaal provides the essential bridge between the parts of the play&#x27;s title.&quot; John Heilpern of &quot;The New York Observer&quot; noted that Gyllenhaal&#x27;s performance was &quot;compelling&quot;. Finally in 2004, Gyllenhaal was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Viewed as a sex symbol, she was ranked in the &quot;Hot 100 List&quot; by &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine in 2004 and 2005.

Gyllenhaal&#x27;s next film role was in the 2005 comedy-drama &quot;Happy Endings&quot;, in which she played an adventuress singer who seduces a young gay musician (Jason Ritter) as well as his rich father (Tom Arnold). She recorded songs for the film&#x27;s soundtrack, calling the role the &quot;roughest, scariest acting ever&quot; and adding she is more natural when singing on screen than when acting. Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; declared Gyllenhaal&#x27;s performance &quot;as wonderfully, naturally slouchy-sexy as her character is artificial&quot;.

===2006–2009: Comedies, dramas and theatre===
Following &quot;Happy Endings&quot;, Gyllenhaal appeared in five films releases in 2006: &quot;Trust the Man&quot;, &quot;Stranger than Fiction&quot;, &quot;Monster House&quot;, &quot;World Trade Center&quot;, and &quot;Sherrybaby&quot;. In &quot;Trust the Man&quot;, featuring Julianne Moore, David Duchovny, and Billy Crudup, she played Elaine, who has been dating Tobey, Crudup&#x27;s character, for seven years and has begun to feel that it is time for her to settle down and start a family. The film was critically and financially unsuccessful. Ethan Alter of &quot;Premiere&quot; felt that the performances by Gyllenhaal and Duchovny were &quot;much more at ease&quot; and concluded with &quot;that&#x27;s probably because they&#x27;re played these characters many times before&quot;. In &quot;Stranger than Fiction&quot;, Gyllenhaal played a love interest of Harold Crick, played by Will Ferrell. Her performance in the film received favorable reviews; Mike Straka of Fox News wrote: &quot;Gyllenhaal has never been sexier in any film before and her interplay with Ferrell will propel her to more A-list films, leaving her indie-darling days behind, no doubt.&quot; She voiced Elizabeth &quot;Zee&quot; in the animated horror film &quot;Monster House&quot;. Gyllenhaal played Allison Jimeno, the wife of Port Authority officer Will Jimeno, in Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;World Trade Center&quot;, based on the September 11 attacks in New York City. She regarded this as &quot;one of the films she most enjoyed making&quot;. The film received favorable reviews and proved to be an international success, earning US$162 million worldwide.

In &quot;Sherrybaby&quot;, Gyllenhaal played a young drug-addicted thief trying to put her life in order after prison so she can reconcile with her daughter. During promotion of the film, she noted of her portrayal of the character: &quot;I think she&#x27;s in such dire straits that all she has are these kind of naive, fierce hopes. And while I was playing the part I was looking for pleasure and hope in everything, even in these really bleak things. And so it was really mostly after I finished the movie that I felt pain.&quot; Her performance in the film was well-received; David Germain of the &quot;Associated Press&quot; wrote, &quot;Gyllenhaal humanizes her so deeply and richly ... that Sherry elicits sympathy even in her darkest and weakest moments&quot;, and Dennis Harvey of &quot;Variety&quot; magazine called her performance &quot;naturalistic&quot;. For her performance, Gyllenhaal earned a second Golden Globe Best Actress nomination and won the Best Actress category award at the 2006 Stockholm International Film Festival.
She appeared in &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; (2008), the sequel to &quot;Batman Begins&quot; (2005), in which she replaced Katie Holmes as Assistant District Attorney, Rachel Dawes. Gyllenhaal acknowledged her character was a damsel in distress to an extent, but said director Christopher Nolan sought ways to empower her character, so &quot;Rachel&#x27;s really clear about what&#x27;s important to her and unwilling to compromise her morals, which made a nice change&quot; from the many conflicted characters she had previously portrayed. &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; was a critical and commercial success, setting a new opening weekend box office record for North America. With revenue of $1 billion worldwide, it became the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time, and remains Gyllenhaal&#x27;s most commercially successful feature to date. In a &quot;Salon&quot; magazine review of the film, Stephanie Zacharek called Gyllenhaal&#x27;s character &quot;a tough cookie in a Stanwyck-style bias-cut gown&quot; and stated that &quot;the movie feels smarter and more supple when she&#x27;s on-screen&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; film critic Todd Gilchrist wrote, &quot;Gyllenhaal adds real depth and energy to Rachel Dawes&quot;.

In addition to film, Gyllenhaal played Yelena Andreevna in the Classic Stage Company&#x27;s 2009 Off-Broadway production of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; in New York City. The cast also included her husband Peter Sarsgaard. The production, directed by Austin Pendleton, began previews on January 17 and ended its limited run on March 1. Joe Dziemianowicz of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; was unenthusiastic about her performance, writing &quot;Gyllenhaal, who was so dynamic as a druggie in the film &quot;Sherrybaby&quot;, plays Yelena with a slow-mo saunter and monotonous pasted-on smile that makes it seem as if she&#x27;s been in Sherry&#x27;s stash.&quot; However, Malcolm Johnson of the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; was complimentary, noting that she &quot;ultimately blossoms&quot; as the character.

Gyllenhaal agreed to star in the comedy &quot;Away We Go&quot; (2009), in which she plays a bohemian college professor who is an old friend of John Krasinski&#x27;s character. The film generated broadly mixed reviews, with Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; describing Gyllenhaal&#x27;s subplot as &quot;over-the-top&quot;. However, A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Gyllenhaal and co-star Allison Janney for their performances, writing that &quot;both [are] quite funny&quot;. Scott concluded with, &quot;Ms. Gyllenhaal&#x27;s line about sex roles in &#x27;the seahorse community&#x27; is the screenplay&#x27;s one clean satirical bull&#x27;s-eye&quot;. Her next role came in the musical-drama &quot;Crazy Heart&quot;, in which she played journalist Jean Craddock, who falls for musician Bad Blake, played by Jeff Bridges, whose performance won the Academy Award for Best Actor. The film was acclaimed, as was Gyllenhaal&#x27;s performance. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; observed that Gyllenhaal was &quot;funny, touching and vital as Jean&quot; and that her part was &quot;conventionally conceived, but Gyllenhaal plays it with a tough core of intelligence and feeling.&quot; Her performance earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.

===2010–2020: Independent films and television ===

In addition to acting, she presented 13 episodes of the PBS television series &quot;Independent Lens&quot; between 2009 and 2010. The program presents documentary films made by independent filmmakers. In 2010, Gyllenhaal appeared in &quot;Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang&quot; with co-star Emma Thompson, the sequel to the 2005&#x27;s &quot;Nanny McPhee&quot;. She played Isabel Green, which required her to speak with an English accent. The feature received generally positive reviews; review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an approval rating of 76% based on 119 critics. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; complimented Gyllenhaal&#x27;s realistic accent and ability to capture her English character with ease. It was a reasonable success at the box office, earning $93 million worldwide.

For her next film, Gyllenhaal starred in the biographical romance &quot;Hysteria&quot; (2011), which focuses on the events that led to the creation of the vibrator during the Victorian era. The film received a mixed reception; writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, David Cox noted the film&#x27;s stereotypes and &quot;yelps of delight&quot;, and praised Gyllenhaal&#x27;s English accent. In February 2011, Gyllenhaal starred in another Anton Chekhov Off-Broadway production as the character Masha in Austin Pendleton&#x27;s &quot;Three Sisters&quot; at the Classic Stage Company. The play focused on the Prozorov sisters (Gyllenhaal, Jessica Hecht, and Juliet Rylance), who are &quot;unlucky in love, unhappy in the provinces and longing to return to Moscow&quot;, as summarized by Bloomberg&#x27;s Jeremy Gerard. The production began preview performances on January 12, with a limited engagement through March 6.

In 2012, she played mother Jaime Fitzpatrick in the drama &quot;Won&#x27;t Back Down,&quot; about a group of parents involved in a parent trigger takeover of a failing school. Next, she appeared alongside Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx, as a Secret Service agent in the action-thriller &quot;White House Down&quot; (2013). The film was met with mixed reviews and under-performed at the box office. A year later, she starred in the musical comedy &quot;Frank&quot;, about a man who joins an odd band with a group of bizarre musicians. Gyllenhaal, who also plays a musician, said she initially turned down the role because she did not understand it. However, she changed her mind after the story &quot;stuck with her&quot;. The film premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival to favorable opinions; &quot;Slant&quot; magazine&#x27;s critic opined that Gyllenhaal has &quot;passive and palpable screen presence&quot;. Also that year, she played Hathfertiti in Matthew Barney and Jonathan Bepler&#x27;s &quot;River of Fundament,&quot; loosely based on the 1983 novel &quot;Ancient Evenings&quot; by Norman Mailer.

Gyllenhaal played the lead role as Baroness Nessa Stein, a British-Israeli businesswoman heiress in the BBC political spy thriller television miniseries, &quot;The Honourable Woman&quot;. The series was well received; Kevin Fallon wrote in the &quot;Daily Beast&quot;: &quot;Gyllenhaal delivers what might be the most towering, complex, best performance of her career in the miniseries.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine praised the series&#x27; pacing, themes, settings, and called Gyllenhaal&#x27;s performance &quot;remarkable&quot;. At the 72nd Golden Globe Awards, she won Best Actress in a Miniseries or Television Film for her performance. &quot;The Honourable Woman&quot; appeared in a list of &quot;The Guardian&quot; critics&#x27; 30 best television shows of 2014.

In 2016, Gyllenhaal narrated Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s novel &quot;Anna Karenina;&quot; it was made available for purchase on Amazon&#x27;s Audible store. In an interview, Gyllenhaal said &quot;Making this, doing this, I feel like it&#x27;s one of the major accomplishments of my work life.&quot; In February 2017, she served as a member of the jury for the 2017 Berlin Film Festival. Returning to film in 2018, Gyllenhaal starred in &quot;The Kindergarten Teacher&quot;, a drama in which her character becomes obsessed with a student whom she believes is a child prodigy. The film premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival, and was distributed via Netflix. It is a remake of the 2014 Israeli film of the same name. The feature opened to mainly popular reviews; &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; critic gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, and thought Gyllenhaal was well-cast, writing &quot;[her] earnest intensity as an actress, gift for fatigue and slightly holier-than-thou authority are key assets here.&quot; Although Dennis Harvey of &quot;Variety&quot; magazine praised her performance, he thought the film lacked &quot;psychological insight&quot;.

She served as a producer and starred in the HBO drama series &quot;The Deuce,&quot; which aired from 2017 to 2019. Gyllenhaal played Eileen &quot;Candy&quot; Merrell, a sex worker during the Golden Age of Porn. &quot;The Deuce&quot; earned her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress.

===2021–present: Filmmaking ===
In 2021, Gyllenhaal made her feature directorial debut with the psychological drama &quot;The Lost Daughter&quot;, which she also produced and adapted from a novella by Elena Ferrante. The film received critical acclaim, and had its premiere at the 78th Venice International Film Festival, where Gyllenhaal won the Best Screenplay Award. It received four awards, including Best Feature and Breakthrough Director, as well as one further nomination at the 2021 Gotham Awards. At the 79th Golden Globe Awards, Gyllenhaal received a nomination for Best Director. She then received a Best Adapted Screenplay nomination at the 75th British Academy Film Awards, and the second Academy Award nomination of her career also for Best Adapted Screenplay at the 94th Academy Awards. 

Gyllenhaal will next direct &quot;The Bride!&quot;, a 1930s-set adaptation of &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, starring Christian Bale, Jessie Buckley, and her brother Jake.

==Personal life==
In 2002, Gyllenhaal began a relationship with actor Peter Sarsgaard. The couple became engaged in April 2006, and married on May 2, 2009, in a small chapel in Brindisi, Italy. They have two daughters, born October 2006 and April 2012.

==Political views==
At the 18th Independent Spirit Awards in 2003, she spoke out against the Iraq war, stating the reason for the invasion was &quot;oil and imperialism&quot;. In 2005, Gyllenhaal drew controversy for her statement that the September 11 attacks were &quot;an occasion to be brave enough to ask some serious questions about America&#x27;s role in the world  ... It is always useful as individuals or nations to ask how we may have knowingly or unknowingly contributed to this conflict.&quot; Gyllenhaal took part in Artists United to Win Without War, a campaign started by Robert Greenwald that aimed to advance progressive causes and voicing opposition to the Iraq War.

She and her brother Jake filmed a commercial for Rock the Vote, and visited the University of Southern California to encourage students to vote in the 2004 U.S. presidential election, in which she supported John Kerry. Gyllenhaal supported Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election. She has campaigned on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), an organization her family strongly supports. In June 2013, Gyllenhaal and numerous other celebrities appeared in a video showing support for whistleblower Chelsea Manning.

==Philanthropy==
Gyllenhaal is a supporter of Witness, a non-profit organization that uses video and online technologies to expose human rights violations. She co-hosted a benefit dinner with founder Peter Gabriel in November 2007. Gyllenhaal helped raise funds for TrickleUp.org, another non-profit that helps people in poverty to start a micro-enterprise. For one of the fundraisers, Gyllenhaal helped design and promote a necklace that sold for US$100; all proceeds from sales went to the charity. Since 2008, Gyllenhaal has been supporting the Hear the World Foundation as ambassador. In her role, she advocates for equal opportunities and better quality of life for people with hearing loss. In October 2008, she hosted a fashion show called &quot;Fashionably Natural&quot;, which was presented by Gen Art and SoyJoy in Los Angeles. The show featured new designers who worked only with natural and eco-friendly fabrics and materials. Gyllenhaal is an advocate of Planned Parenthood; in 2012 she said, &quot;Women&#x27;s health is very important to me. It has become such a politicized issue and so I will make every effort to elect officials who believe as strongly as I do that all women [...] have access to quality health care and information.&quot;

<text>A moonscape is an area or vista of the lunar landscape (generally of the Earth&#x27;s moon), or a visual representation of this, such as in a painting. The term &quot;moonscape&quot; is also sometimes used metaphorically for an area devastated or flattened by war, often by shelling.

Moonscapes have been a popular subject in art and literature since the technology to observe the Moon surfaced, appearing in work such as a sketch drawn by Petr Ginz. It is currently residing in the Yad Vashem Museum Special Exhibit in Honor of Israeli Astronaut Col. Ilan Ramon.

In literature, the term appears most often over the last century in reference to cities damaged by ballistics, particularly when applied to post-WWII Berlin, as in David L. Robbins&#x27; &quot;The End of War&quot;&quot;,&quot; where he describes the city as a &quot;moonscape of desolation&quot;.

<text>Forever Peace is a 1997 science fiction novel by Joe Haldeman. It won the Nebula Award, Hugo Award and John W. Campbell Memorial Award in 1998.

==Plot==
Though its title is similar to &quot;The Forever War&quot;, and both novels deal with soldiers in the future, &quot;Forever Peace&quot; is not a direct sequel and takes place on a different future of Earth in 2048.

Using remotely controlled, nearly invincible robots called &quot;soldierboys&quot;, the Alliance military fights third-world guerrillas in an endless series of economy-driven wars. As only first-world nations possess the nanoforge technology that can produce anything from basic materials, conflict is largely asymmetric.

The novel is told partly in first-person narration by the main character, Julian Class, and partly by an anonymous third-person narrator, who comments on aspects of Julian&#x27;s personality and background.

The main protagonist, Julian Class, is a physicist and a mechanic who operates a soldierboy. Thanks to electronic &quot;jacks&quot; implanted in their skulls, mechanics are remotely linked to the machinery as well as to each other, being able to experience battle through the machines and read the thoughts of other mechanics who are simultaneously jacked in.

After attempting suicide, Julian and his lover, Amelia &quot;Blaze&quot; Harding, are made aware of a problem with an automated particle physics project that could trigger a new Big Bang that would destroy the universe. The pair speculate that a given universe exists only until its first civilization attempts such a project. When Julian, Blaze, and another physicist submit their paper to a journal&#x27;s review board, they find themselves the target of &quot;The Hammer of God&quot;, a Christian cult bent on hastening an anticipated end of the universe. As the Hammer of God has a secret presence throughout the government, Julian and Blaze narrowly miss being assassinated.

Marty Larrin, one of the inventors of jacking technology, recruits Julian and Blaze in an attempt to use the technology to end war; a little-known secret is that jacking with someone else for about two weeks will psychologically eliminate the ability to kill another human being. By &quot;humanizing&quot; the entire world, dangerous technology would not be a problem for human survival. They do so, stop the particle accelerator&#x27;s construction, and the war is eventually ended.

<doc id="399021" wikidata="Q12504865" url="?curid=399021" title="Campaign management tool">
<text>A campaign management tool is software that facilitates the launching and coordination of political campaigns across multiple social media platforms.

In the past, political campaigns were conducted using traditional methods of personal contact, such as television and radio media purchasing, print advertising and direct mail. However, the rising popularity of the Internet has changed how campaigns talk to voters, and also how campaigns maintain communications between staff members, volunteers and political consultants, and getting the campaign message out via the web, e-mail and interactive web forms.

Campaigns are also utilizing an increasing number of tools that assist with accounting, contact management, and handling increasingly complicated government regulations.

The exact best implementation of these sorts of tools is under debate. Politicians in many states have started websites and weblogs (or &quot;blogs&quot;) with a variety of degrees of success. Social software has been used to benefit politicians. However, at the same time, companies are offering tools that push the edge of social responsibility, including those for publishing spam. Other companies pretending to be legitimate polling agencies, attempt to influence voters through leading questions, in so called &quot;push polls&quot;.

Some of the tools are those which enable the formation of local groups. These rapidly forming groups give citizens the confidence that they are not alone, and inspire collective actions. As Reed&#x27;s law predicted, tools that enable group formations at the edges of the network (Edge Tools), deliver measurable value, as can be seen by the use of Meetup and Get Local on the Howard Dean campaign. While many activists and technologists see great value in these tools, many campaign professionals fear the loss of control. The value of these tools to campaigns below the Presidential level also remains uncertain.

Other kinds of internet tools for campaign management do not have such specific methods of organizing people. There is an increasing number of companies providing web-based software to replace database systems that require a specific computer or network. By making databases for GOTV/voter tracking, fundraising, accounting and campaign management accessible from any location, these vendors are allowing campaigns to take advantage of resources that many individual volunteers and campaign staff have available at home, expanding the use of distributed campaigning techniques.

<doc id="399023" wikidata="Q5026780" url="?curid=399023" title="Camino Real (play)">
<text>Camino Real is a 1953 play by Tennessee Williams.

==Pronunciation of the title==
In the introduction to the Penguin edition of the play, Williams directs the reader to use the Anglicized pronunciation &quot;Cá-mino Réal.&quot; The title suggests some sort of road, but the setting is a dead-end place, a Spanish-speaking town surrounded by desert with only sporadic transportation to the outside world. It is described by Williams as &quot;nothing more nor less than my conception of the time and the world I live in.&quot;

==Characters==
Kilroy, a young American visitor, fulfills some of the functions of the play&#x27;s narrator, as does Gutman, (named after Sydney Greenstreet&#x27;s character from &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, but bearing more resemblance to Signor Ferrari, Greenstreet&#x27;s character in &quot;Casablanca&quot;) manager of the hotel Siete Mares, whose terrace occupies part of the stage. Williams also employs a large cast of characters including many famous literary characters who appear in dream sequences. They include Don Quixote and his partner Sancho, Marguerite &quot;Camille&quot; Gautier (see &quot;The Lady of the Camellias&quot;), Casanova, Lord Byron, and Esmeralda (see &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot;), and others.

==Setting and theme==
Taking place in the main plaza, the play goes through a series of confusing and almost logic-defying events, including the revival of the Gypsy&#x27;s daughter (Esmeralda)&#x27;s virginity and then the loss of it again. A main theme that the play deals with is coming to terms with the thought of growing older and possibly becoming irrelevant.

==Synopsis==
The play has one location — the plaza at the end of the road —Camino Real. On one side of the plaza is the dining area of the Siete Mares hotel, on the other side is Skid Row. The town is near the sea, and is tropical, mythic, and sometimes dream-like. It isn’t named, though it suggests Mexico or Louisiana. According to the author, the play exists &quot;outside of time in a place of no specific locality&quot;. It is a place of refuge for the quirky misfits that turn up there, and find their illusions crumble. Characters include Lord Byron, Gypsy and her sex-driven daughter, Esmerelda, La Madrecita, a blind singer, and Casanova at an advanced age.

The division of the play includes a prologue followed by 16 scenes or “blocks” and monologues.

Sancho Panza has left Don Quixote, who then falls asleep, and Quixote&#x27;s dream, which ensues, becomes the play. Quixote needs someone to replace Panza, so he selects Kilroy, a dispirited American soldier, who had appeared on the plaza. Kirby has been courageous in his boxing career, but now he feels lost, and needs to sell his golden gloves.

The cruel Gutman, builds The Seven Seas Hotel above the town&#x27;s water source. Other characters appear in dreams, including Camille, Lord Byron, Esmeralda, La Madrecita (a blind singer), and Baron de Charlus, the sexual seeker who is murdered. Some characters find partners and some do not.

Resurrections occur: Esmeralda regains her virginity, the singer’s eyesight is restored, Kiroy and Lord Byron are transformed. 

Marguerite tells Casanova that she has outlived the tenderness of her heart, and that &quot;tenderness, the violets in the mountains--can&#x27;t break the rocks!&quot; Casanova falls in love and has the last line of the play: &quot;The violets in the mountains have broken the rocks.&quot;

== Production history ==
=== Inspiration ===
In 1946 Williams wrote an account of the origins of the play, in which he describes how he was visiting Mexico in 1945 and in a romantic, dreamy mood, when: 

=== Premiere ===
&quot;Camino Real&quot; originated with Williams&#x27;s one-act play, &quot;Ten Blocks on the Camino Real&quot;, written in 1946 and published by Dramatists Play Service in 1948. This series of 10 scenes, or &quot;blocks&quot;, was first staged in a workshop by Elia Kazan at the Actors Studio in 1949. By 1952 Williams had expanded the play into a 16-scene version, and he finalized the text the following year for its publication by New Directions Publishing. For the 1953 Broadway production, directed by Kazan with assistance by Anna Sokolow, the cast included Eli Wallach (as Kilroy), Frank Silvera (as Gutman), Joseph Anthony (as Casanova), Jo Van Fleet (as Marguerite &quot;Camille&quot; Gautier), Jennie Goldstein (as the Gypsy), Barbara Baxley (as Esmeralda), and David J. Stewart (as the Baron).

With only 60 performances on Broadway, the play was not a mainstream success. Brooks Atkinson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a strange and disturbing drama,&quot; which seemed to be &quot;a dark mirror&quot; of &quot;Mr. Williams&#x27;s concept of life — full of black and appalling images.&quot; Director Elia Kazan later wrote in his memoirs that he had misinterpreted the play by infusing it with excessive naturalism.

=== London premiere ===
The first London production opened on April 8, 1957, at the Phoenix Theatre. It starred Denholm Elliott as Kilroy, Diana Wynyard as Marguerite, was directed by Peter Hall and played for two months.

=== Revivals ===
&quot;Camino Real&quot; was presented on television in 1966 by NET, a PBS predecessor, as &quot;Ten Blocks on the Camino Real&quot;. A black-and-white production, it was directed by Jack Landau and starred Martin Sheen, Lotte Lenya, Tom Aldredge, Michael Baseleon, Albert Dekker, and Hurd Hatfield.

In 1968, the Los Angeles Mark Taper Forum revived the play with Earl Holliman as Kilroy.

In January 1970, the play enjoyed its first Broadway revival at the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center, directed by Jules Irving and starring Al Pacino (Kilroy), Victor Buono (Gutman), Patrick McVey (Don Quixote), Jean-Pierre Aumont (Casanova), Jessica Tandy (Camille), Sylvia Syms (the Gypsy), David J. Stewart (the Baron), Susan Tyrrell (Esmeralda), and Clifford David (Lord Byron). In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Clive Barnes wrote &quot;there are people who think that &quot;Camino Real&quot; was Tennessee Williams&#x27;s best play, and I believe that they are right. It is a play that seems to have been torn out of a human soul, a tale told by an idiot signifying a great deal of suffering and a great deal of gallantry.&quot;

The UK&#x27;s Royal Shakespeare Company revived the play at the Swan Theatre in 1996. The production was directed by Steven Pimlott, and starred Leslie Phillips as Gutman, Peter Egan as Casanova and Susannah York as Camille.

In June 1999, Nicholas Martin staged a production at the Williamstown Theater Festival, featuring Ethan Hawke (Kilroy), Jeffrey Jones (Gutman), Richard Easton (Casanova), Blair Brown (Marguerite Gautier), Christian Camargo (Baron de Charlus and Lord Byron), Hope Davis (Esmeralda), Kristine Nielsen (The Gypsy), and John Seidman (Lord Mulligan and Don Quixote). Reviewing the production in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Ben Brantley wrote that &quot;... in his art as in his life, Williams could be grotesquely excessive and sloppy. But whatever he wrote, he tore it straight from his soul, and in this age of irony there is something especially nourishing in such sustained depths of emotion.&quot;

In October 1999, Michael Wilson mounted another revival at the Hartford Stage, with a cast including James Colby (Kilroy), Helmar Augustus Cooper (Gutman), Rip Torn (Casanova), Betty Buckley (Marguerite Gautier), Novella Nelson (Gypsy), Lisa Leguillou (Esmeralda), John Feltch (Baron de Charlus, Lord Byron and Don Quixote), Natalie Brown (Lady Mulligan) and Nafe Katter (Lord Mulligan).

In January 2009, director David Herskovits staged a new production at the Ohio Theater in Manhattan. This short version, which focused on Kilroy as the American boxer (played by Satya Bhabha), was a re-imagination of the original one-act play &quot;Ten Blocks on the Camino Real&quot;.

From March 3 to April 8, 2012, the Goodman Theatre in Chicago presented a new version by director Calixto Bieito and playwright Marc Rosich.

<text>El Camino Real (Spanish; literally The Royal Road, sometimes translated as The King&#x27;s Highway) is a 600-mile (965-kilometer) commemorative route connecting the 21 Spanish missions in California (formerly the region Alta California in the Spanish Empire), along with a number of sub-missions, four presidios, and three pueblos. Historically associated with a network of royal roads () used by inhabitants of New Spain, the modern commemorative route in the U.S. state of California is named after these roads, with its southern terminus at Mission San Diego de Alcalá and its northern terminus at Mission San Francisco Solano in Sonoma, California. 

During the period of Spanish rule, there was no single road constructed by the Spanish to connect the missions, with most of the network of royal roads following historic Native American trading routes. These various covered much of what is today California, but with no single special route designated to link the missions. The name was revived in the American era in connection with the boosterism associated with the Mission Revival movement of the early 20th century. Streets throughout California bear the &quot;El Camino Real&quot; name. The route has been continually upgraded and is decorated with commemorative bell markers.

== Spanish and Mexican era ==

In earlier Spanish colonial times, any road under the direct jurisdiction of the Spanish crown and its viceroys was considered to be a &quot;camino real&quot;. Examples of such roads ran between principal settlements throughout Spain and its colonies such as New Spain. Most &quot;caminos reales&quot; had names apart from the appended &quot;camino real&quot;. Missions were present in Las Californias for decades before the establishment of any missions in what is today the U.S. state of California, with various Spanish missions established in present-day Baja California, Mexico, starting in 1697 with the Misión de Nuestra Señora de Loreto Conchó in present-day Loreto.

The Portolá expedition of 1769 included Franciscan missionaries, led by Junípero Serra. Starting from Loreto, Serra established the first of the 21 missions at San Diego. Serra stayed at San Diego and Juan Crespí continued the rest of the way with Gaspar de Portolá. Proceeding north, Portolá followed the coastline (today&#x27;s California State Route 1), except where forced inland by coastal cliffs.

Eventually, the expedition was prevented from going farther north by the entrance to San Francisco Bay, the Golden Gate. Crespí identified several future mission sites which were not developed until later. On the return trip to San Diego, Gaspar de Portolá found a shorter detour around one stretch of coastal cliffs via Conejo Valley.

Portolá journeyed again from San Diego to Monterey in 1770, where Junipero Serra (who traveled by ship) founded the second mission (later moved a short distance south to Carmel). Carmel became Serra&#x27;s Alta California mission headquarters.

The Juan Bautista de Anza expedition of (1775–76) entered Alta California from the southeast (crossing the Colorado River near today&#x27;s Yuma, Arizona), and picked up Portolá&#x27;s trail at Mission San Gabriel. De Anza&#x27;s scouts found easier traveling in several inland valleys, rather than staying on the rugged coast. On his journey north, de Anza traveled the San Fernando Valley and Salinas Valley. After detouring to the coast to visit the Presidio of Monterey, de Anza went inland again, following the Santa Clara Valley to the southern end of San Francisco Bay and on up the east side of the San Francisco Peninsula.

Between 1683 and 1835, Jesuit and Franciscan missionaries established a series of religious outposts from today&#x27;s Baja California and Baja California Sur into present-day California. Heavy freight and long-distance passenger movement was practical only via ships by a coastal water route.

While it is sometimes claimed that mission settlements were deliberately spaced approximately 30 miles (48 kilometers) apart to facilitate overland travel via horseback during the Spanish era, this claim is not made in any historical sources and first appeared in 20th-century advertising materials encouraging automobile travel along the route. The missions are in fact spaced at highly variable intervals and do not reflect any particular planning of this kind. It is also traditionally claimed that the padres sprinkled mustard seeds along the trail to mark the windings of the trail&#x27;s northward progress with bright yellow flowers, creating a golden trail stretching from San Diego to Sonoma, although this legend remains unverified.

Valuable seeds were brought to California also marking the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro with trees for different uses. For example, ash trees were the marker for where a spring was to be found, as seen to this day at the church of in Fresnillo, Zacatecas.

==American era==
By the mid-nineteenth century, when California became a state, the route had been improved in certain sections, but was wholly inadequate for large stagecoaches and freight wagons. In 1892, Anna Pitcher of Pasadena, California initiated an effort to establish a commemorative route which was adopted by the California Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs in 1902. In the early twentieth century, organizations and government agencies became interested in creating official designations or commemorations of roads and highways. Given the lack of standardized highway signs at the time, it was decided to place distinctive bells along the route, hung on supports in the form of an high shepherd&#x27;s crook, also described as &quot;a Franciscan walking stick&quot;. The bells were designed by Mrs ASC Forbes, who also owned the California Bell Company where they were cast. The first of 450 bells were unveiled on August 15, 1906, at the Plaza Church in the Pueblo near Olvera Street in Los Angeles.

A 1915 map produced by the Automobile Club of Southern California traced the route that connected the missions for motorists to follow. The club and associated groups cared for the bells from the mid-1920s through 1931 after the original organization which installed the bells fragmented. Distinctive route markers were added to U.S. Route 101 and other national auto trails when the joint board of state highway officials adopted the United States Numbered Highway System in 1926. The state highways forming El Camino Real were identified as Highway 1, U.S. Route 101 and Highway 82 on the San Francisco Peninsula in a 1959 law. Most of the bells eventually disappeared due to vandalism, theft or simple loss due to the relocation or rerouting of highways and roads. The State took over bell maintenance in 1933. After a reduction in the number of bells to around 80, the State began replacing them, at first with concrete, and later with iron. Justin Kramer took over the production of the bells in 1959. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) began a restoration effort in 1996.

Keith Robinson, Principal Landscape Architect at Caltrans developed an El Camino Real restoration program which resulted in the installation of 555 El Camino Real Bell Markers in 2005. The Bell Marker consists of a 460 mm diameter cast metal bell set atop a 75 mm diameter Schedule 40 pipe column that is attached to a concrete foundation using anchor rods. The original 1906 bell molds were used to fabricate the replacement bells. The bells are most typically marked &quot;1769 &amp; 1906&quot;, and include a designer&#x27;s copyright notice. The two dates represent the date of the founding of the first Alta-California mission in San Diego, and the date of the setting of the first commemorative bell-marker, respectively. In 1997, the California Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs, in conjunction with California State Automobile Association, developed a restoration project as part of CalTrans &quot;Adopt-a-Highway&quot; program. Permits issued by Caltrans for installations along state routes have detailed specifications on how the bell should be set up for safety and legal considerations. The Caltrans were provided over two million dollars in grants categorized under Transportation Enhancements, a governmental program that aims to symbolize and preserve cultural, ecologically beneficial, and various aesthetic aspects of the land surrounding transportation routes.
For some indigenous populations, the bells are painful symbols of the dehumanization of their ancestors, together with the domination and erasure of their culture. The Amah Mutsun tribal band shared with local authorities how the bells represent historical injustices and oppression of their people, such as the punishment endured for missing a ring of the bell. In response, a bell at the University of California, Santa Cruz was removed by campus officials in June 2019. The issue was also present when the statues of Junípero Serra were damaged and/or removed in 2020 during the George Floyd protests which expanded to include monuments of individuals associated with the controversy over the genocide of indigenous peoples in the Americas. The historical preservation commission of Santa Cruz reported to the city council in November 2020 that the bells represent a painful history for the indigenous people of the city, and noted that a bell in Mission Park Plaza had been stolen in 1999 and not replaced. Santa Cruz scheduled the removal of the last bell in the city, at the intersection of Soquel and Dakota avenues, for August 28, 2021, but the bell was stolen the night before it was to be removed. The Tribal Band, an organization of local tribes, led a ceremony to mark the occasion in spite of the theft.

==Modern highway and street routes ==
Several modern highways include parts of the commemorative route, though large sections are on city streets (for instance, most of the stretch between San Jose and San Francisco). The full route as defined by the California State Legislature is as follows:

;East Bay route
Some older local roads that parallel these routes also have the name. Mission Street in San Francisco does correspond to the commemorative route. An unpaved stretch of the old road has been preserved just east of Mission San Juan Bautista; this section of road runs parallel to the San Andreas Fault, which can be clearly seen where the ground drops several feet. Many streets throughout California bear the name of the road, often with scant relation to the original.

A section of the old mission road, El Camino Real fronts the Rios-Caledonia Adobe in San Miguel. This road served stagecoaches and then was paved as part of the original US 101 highway.

The route through the San Mateo and Santa Clara counties is designated as State Route 82, and some stretches of it are named &quot;El Camino Real&quot;. The old road is part of the de Anza route, located a few miles west of Route 101.

==Historic designations==
El Camino Real is designated as California Historical Landmark #784. There are two state historical markers honoring the road: one located near Mission San Diego de Alcalá in San Diego and the other one near Mission San Francisco de Asís in San Francisco.

<text>Alaska is a 1988 historical novel by James A. Michener. Like other Michener titles, &quot;Alaska&quot; spans a considerable amount of time, traced through the gradual interlinking of several families.

==Plot introduction==
&quot;Alaska&quot; is 868 pages long. Along with the reading, Michener provides a table of contents, a list of acknowledgements, and a &quot;Fact and Fiction&quot; section. The third item offers the reader an insight into what occurred in real life and what the author invented.

==Plot summary==

===Chapter I: The Clashing Terranes===
A sweeping description of the formation of the North American continent. The reader follows the development of the Alaskan terrain over millennia.
The city of Los Angeles is now some twenty-four hundred miles south of central Alaska, and since it is moving slowly northward as the San Andreas Fault slides irresistibly along, the city is destined eventually to become part of Alaska. If the movement is two inches a year, which it often is, Los Angeles can be expected to arrive off Anchorage in about seventy-six million years.

===Chapter II: The Ice Castle===
The plot of this chapter follows the mastodons, sabre-toothed tigers and woolly mammoths as they make their way into Alaska via the land bridge. First, the animals are discussed in general terms. Then, in the second half of the chapter, the reader learns about a specific mammoth named Mastodon, and another named Matriarch. The plot follows Matriarch and her family, as they encounter man for the first time.

===Chapter III: People of the North===
About some of the early Eskimos, particularly a man named Oogruk and his family. The chapter details the hunting of a whale as well as the beginning of hunting sea otters for fur by the Russians.

===Chapter IV: The Explorers===
This chapter tells of the early exploration of Alaska along with Russia&#x27;s first encounters with the native peoples, including the brutal slaughter of many native people and sea otters.

===Chapter V: The Duel===
The duel referred to in the chapter&#x27;s title is the one between the shamanism of the native people and the Christianity of the Russian settlers. After the men from one tribe are taken away to aid in hunting, the women and babies are left to fend for themselves. They learn to pilot kayaks, something that had been forbidden to them, and ultimately harpoon a small whale to ensure their survival. After the Russians return, a girl named Cidaq is &quot;purchased&quot; and taken to Kodiak Island, but not before she is brutally abused by one sailor in particular. On Kodiak, she consults with a shaman and his mummy and decides to seek revenge upon this man by converting to Christianity to marry him when he returns to Kodiak, believing that she can humiliate him by refusing to marry him at the last moment. However, she goes through with the wedding and becomes a battered wife. A priest on Kodiak falls in love with her, and after her husband is killed by a great tidal wave, Cidaq (rechristened Sofia) marries the priest, who changes his relationship with the church to become the kind of priest who can marry. At the end of the chapter, Michener states that Christianity won over shamanism, but in the process, the population of native people dwindled from more than 18,000 to fewer than 1,200.

===Chapter VI: Lost Worlds===
This chapter further details the clashes between the Native people and the Russians, most specifically the Battle of Sitka. The events are shown through the eyes of a native named Raven-heart and an Arkady Voronov, the son of Father Vornov and Sofia Kuchovskaya (formerly Cidaq). Arkady Voronov marries a Russian woman who moves to Alaska, and together they navigate the Yukon River. The chapter also explains the death of Alexander Baranov and ends with the purchase of Alaska by the United States of America.

===Chapter VII: Giants in Chaos===
This chapter shows the clash between two rival ship captains, Captains Schransky and Michael A. Healy. Meanwhile, Reverend Sheldon Jackson, a missionary, travels to Alaska to further establish it as a state, with the help of Senator Benjamin Harrison. He sets about establishing Christian missions of various denominations to further spread Christianity to the native people of Alaska.

===Chapter VIII: Gold===
The eighth chapter tells of the chaos surrounding the Alaskan gold rush using the fictitious Venn family and a prospector named John Klope. It mentions the real character of Soapy Smith and his fatal duel with Frank H. Reid. It also details the hardships of crossing the Chilkoot Pass.

===Chapter IX: The Golden Beaches of Nome===
Gold is discovered in Nome, and Tom Venn and his stepmother Missy pick up their stakes and move there. Tom is appointed manager of a branch of Ross and Raglan, a store that sells food and outdoor supplies. Missy&#x27;s boyfriend Matt Murphy joins Tom and Missy in Nome, arriving there via bicycle. Although these characters are fictitious, the bike trip is based on the real bike trek of Max R. Hirshberg in 1900, and the troubles of gold mine thieving with judicial collusion is based upon the politician Alexander McKenzie and Judge Arthur H. Noyes.

===Chapter X: Salmon===
This chapter describes the formation and operation of a fictional company&#x27;s cannery (an Alaskan first) on the Taku Inlet when Ross and Raglan appoint Tom Venn to be in charge of the cannery, the fishing and the Chinese laborers. Along the way, the company clashes with local members of the Tlingit tribe, whose fishing rights are being encroached upon. Tom begins on-and-off romances with two girls; one is Lydia Ross, the daughter of the owner of Ross and Raglan, and the other is Nancy Bigears, the daughter of a local Tlingit of whom Tom is very fond. Nancy Bigears, knows the romance cannot continue because Tom Venn is unable to comprehend the fishing rights and salmon conservancy issues created by his cannery. Nancy Bigears father, who lived across the inlet from the cannery is now prohibited from fishing on his ancestral lands. At the end of the chapter, the reader learns that Tom marries Lydia, and that Nancy marries Ah Ting, a Chinese man who was once employed as a foreman at the salmon cannery before striking out on his own.

===Chapter XI: The Railbelt===
In 1919, a government official arrives in a small town of Minnesota made up of immigrants of Swedish and Finnish descent, as well as those who have been in the United States for several generations. He recruits a group of families to move to Alaska and settle in the Matanuska Valley, where they will be provided with land that they will not begin to pay on for at least three years, as long as they promise to farm. This chapter follows the Flatch family closely, especially the children. LeRoy Flatch grows up to become a bush pilot and Flossie is an animal lover who falls in love with a local &quot;half-breed&quot; man of white and Eskimo descent.

===Chapter XII: The Rim of Fire===
In a typical James Michener fashion, the final chapter is an interaction between various characters in preceding chapter or their descendants. Alaska is in the process of applying for statehood. Missy remains on the side advocating for statehood, while Tom Venn petitioned to keep Alaska a territory and under Seattle business control. In the end President Dwight D. Eisenhower signs the Alaska Statehood Act, making Alaska the 49th state of the Union.

==Artwork==

===Drawings and maps===

Throughout the novel are drawings (at the beginnings of chapters) and maps (frontispiece, pages 102–103, and inside back cover). There is also an amount of calligraphy. The maps are credited to Jean-Paul Tremblay. Carole Lowenstein is responsible for the book&#x27;s physical and calligraphy.

===Jacket design===

The jacket of &quot;Alaska&quot; features an illustration on the front and a photograph of Michener on the back. The jacket design and aforementioned sketch are credited to Wendell Minor.
The illustration is an oval-shaped sketch of items easily identifiable with the state of Alaska.They include (clockwise):
*a snow-capped mountain
*a sky of pink, orange, and yellow hues
*an amphibious airplane (known as a &#x27;bush plane&#x27; in the state)
*a dark gray-green hill
*a floating, craggy iceberg
*calm, highly-reflective water
*a small figure in a kayak
*a tiny village at the foot of another hill

The photograph of James Michener, on the back cover, was taken in 1986 when Michener was working on &quot;Alaska&quot;. Michener&#x27;s picture is credited to Michael A. Lewis of the Sheldon Jackson College in Sitka, Alaska.

==&quot;Journey&quot;==
Michener&#x27;s novel &quot;Journey&quot; (1989) was expanded from a section originally cut from &quot;Alaska&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; was lukewarm about the novel, describing the characters as puppets and that the historical framework of the book lacked rigor and substance. &quot;The Harbus&quot; described the book as easily-digestible, compelling, and accessible. The &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; points out that people, rather than events, uniquely shape this historical novel.

<text>Slussen (&quot;&quot;) is an area in Stockholm, Sweden, located at the northern edge of Södermalm, adjacent to Gamla stan. It is known for its locks system between Lake Mälaren and the Baltic Sea, as well as its historic role as a major transport interchange. The Slussen area includes the Slussen metro station and Saltsjöbanan terminus, and a bus terminal.

The boundary between Uppland and Södermanland runs through the area.

== History ==
:

Slussen has been a vital crossing point in Stockholm for centuries, linking southern roads with the waterways connecting Lake Mälaren to the Baltic Sea. Over time, the area has undergone significant transformations.

Early History

The first lock at Slussen, known as Queen Christina&#x27;s Lock, was inaugurated in 1642. It was replaced in 1755 by Christopher Polhem&#x27;s Lock. Nils Ericson&#x27;s Lock, built in 1850, followed, allowing ships to traverse the area more efficiently. The final major lock, Karl Johan&#x27;s Lock, was inaugurated in 1935 as part of the modernisation of the area.

1935 Traffic Interchange

The 1935 traffic interchange was a pioneering example of functionalist urban planning. Designed by architects Gösta Lundborg and Sven Markelius, the structure was hailed as a modern solution to traffic and pedestrian congestion. However, the innovative &quot;cloverleaf&quot; design proved problematic as traffic volumes increased, leading to congestion and safety concerns.

The interchange became a symbol of Stockholm&#x27;s modernity in the mid-20th century, but structural issues began emerging as early as the 1940s due to salt corrosion and other damage.

=== Redevelopment 2016–2027 ===
:

In the early 2000s, the deteriorating state of the 1935 interchange prompted the decision to rebuild the area entirely. A design competition in 2007 led to plans by Foster + Partners and Berg Arkitektkontor being approved in 2011. Construction began in 2016, with completion scheduled for 2027. The project is to rebuild water regulation infrastructure, while modernising Slussen as a mixed-use public space with improvised public transport.

==== Cultural and Political Impact ====
The redevelopment project has faced criticism and public debate. Some have opposed the loss of the historic 1935 structure, while others support the need for modernisation. The new design includes parks, plazas, and waterfront promenades, aiming to revitalise the area.

==== Golden Bridge and Traffic Layout ====
A central feature of the new design is the &quot;Golden Bridge&quot; (&quot;Guldbron&quot;), officially known as Slussbron, which connects Södermalm to Gamla stan. The bridge accommodates vehicle traffic, pedestrians, and cyclists. It was manufactured in China and shipped to Stockholm in 2020, where it opened to traffic on 26 October 2020.

== Public Transport ==
Slussen metro station lies in the southwest, under Ryssgården.

The Slussen bus terminal temporarily moved eastward to Stadsgården during redevelopment. By August 2024, buses were relocated to a temporary terminal at Stadsgårdsterminalen. A permanent terminal is under construction inside the bedrock at Katarinaberget.

The Saltsjöbanan railway terminus is closed during the works, with Henriksdal station serving as the interim terminus.

The Djurgården ferry has moved its departure point further north but retains the name &quot;Slussen&quot;.

== Waterways ==
The new water facilities include two discharge channels and the newly named &quot;Victoria Slussen&quot;. These are surrounded by four low bridges and form the heart of Vattentorget, which opened in phases in 2022 and 2024. The original Nils Ericson lock has been repurposed into a fish migration channel as of 2024.

<text>A victory title is an honorific title adopted by a successful military commander to commemorate his defeat of an enemy nation. The practice is first known in Ancient Rome and is still most commonly associated with the Romans, but it was also adopted as a practice by many later empires, especially the French, British and Russian Empires.

==Roman victory titles==

Victory titles were suffixed to the commander&#x27;s name and were usually the name of the enemy defeated by the commander. Some victory titles became hereditary &quot;cognomina&quot;, while others were personal &quot;agnomina&quot; and not carried on by later family members. Names like &quot;Africanus&quot; (&quot;the African&quot;), &quot;Numidicus&quot; (&quot;the Numidian&quot;), &quot;Isauricus&quot; (&quot;the Isaurian&quot;), &quot;Creticus&quot; (&quot;the Cretan&quot;), &quot;Gothicus&quot; (&quot;the Goth&quot;), &quot;Germanicus&quot; (&quot;the German&quot;) and &quot;Parthicus&quot; (&quot;the Parthian&quot;) expressed the triumphal subjugation of these peoples or their territories, or commemorated the locations of general&#x27;s successful campaigns, equivalent to modern titles like Lawrence of Arabia, and were not indicators of origin.

The practice of awarding victory titles was established in the Roman Republic. The most famous grantee of a Republican victory title was Publius Cornelius Scipio, who for his great victories in the Second Punic War, specifically the Battle of Zama was awarded by the Roman Senate the title &quot;Africanus&quot; and is thus known to history as &quot;Scipio Africanus&quot; (his adopted grandson Scipio Aemilianus Africanus was awarded the same title after the Third Punic War and is known as &quot;Scipio Africanus the Younger&quot;). Other notable holders of such victory titles include Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus, who was replaced by Gaius Marius as command-in-chief of the Jugurthine War; Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus, who commanded Roman anti-pirate operations in the eastern Mediterranean (and was father of Julius Caesar&#x27;s colleague in his second consulate); Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus in 48 BC), while Marcus Antonius Creticus, another anti-piracy commander, (and father of Caesar&#x27;s &quot;magister equitum&quot;, Mark Antony) actually lost in Crete and was called &quot;Creticus&quot; mockingly, as it also meant &quot;Man made of Chalk&quot;. Marcus Porcius Cato &quot;Uticensis&quot; received his title posthumously from those glorifying his suicide, rather than defeat, at Utica.

The practice continued in the Roman Empire, although it was subsequently amended by some Roman Emperors who desired to emphasise the totality of their victories by adding &quot;Maximus&quot; (&quot;the Greatest&quot;) to the victory title (&quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;Parthicus Maximus&quot;, &quot;the Greatest Parthian&quot;). This taste grew to be rather vulgar by modern standards, with increasingly grandiose accumulations of partially fictitious victory titles.

In a broader sense, the term victory title is sometimes used to describe the &quot;repeatable&quot; awarding of the invariable style of Imperator (Greek equivalent Autokrator; see those articles), which is the highest military qualification (as modern states have awarded a non-operational highest rank, sometimes instituted for a particular general), but even when it marks the recipient out for one or more memorable victories (and the other use, as a permanent military command for the ruler, became in fact the more significant one), it does not actually specify one.

==Medieval victory titles==
After the fall of Western Rome, the practice continued in modified form.
* Charlemagne, the first Carolingian emperor of the Franks, styled himself &quot;Dominator Saxonorum&quot; (&quot;Dominator of the Saxons&quot;) after subduing by force the last major pagan people in the empire
* Byzantine Emperor Basil II (r. 960–1025) — &quot;the Bulgar-slayer&quot;
* King Richard I of England (r. 1189–1199) — &quot;the Lionheart&quot;
* King Edward I of England (r. 1272–1307) — &quot;Hammer of the Scots&quot;
* King Afonso IV of Portugal (r. 1325–1357) — &quot;the Brave&quot; for his victory in the Battle of Río Salado
* Ruler of Epirus Thomas Preljubović (r. 1367–1384) — &quot;the Albanian-slayer&quot;
* Prince Alexander Yaroslavich of Novgorod was called Alexander Nevsky for his victory in the Battle of Neva.
* Prince Dmitry of Moscow was styled Dmitry Donskoy for his victory over Mamai Khan at Kulikovo on the Don.

==Modern victory titles==
The term &quot;victory-title&quot; occurs in English from as early as 1938.

Modern monarchs awarded titles in commemoration of major military victories, but in the guise of a feudal aristocratic title, often hereditary, but only in appearance: an actual fief was not required, indeed they often were granted in chief of a battlefield where the awarding monarch simply had no constitutional authority to grant anything validly under local law.

This new form was even more specific than the Roman practice. Instead of naming the enemy — which could well need to be repeated — it linked the name of a battle, which was almost always unique. A further level of protection was available by naming a nearby place, such as &#x27;Austerlitz&#x27; which Napoleon declared &quot;sounded&quot; better than the alternative.

===Russian Empire===
In the Russian Empire, many victory titles originated in the period between the accession of Catherine the Great (1762) and the death of Nicholas I of Russia (1855). But as early as 1707, after Alexander Menshikov occupied Swedish Ingria (Izhora) during the Great Northern War, Peter I of Russia officially designated him Duke or Prince of Ingria ( - &quot;gertsog Izhorsky&quot;). Other Russian victory titles (sometimes referencing whole campaigns rather than specific battles) include:

* 1775 — &quot;Chesmensky&quot; (&quot;Chesmean&quot;) for Count Aleksey Orlov for his victory in the naval Battle of Chesma
* 1775 — &quot;Zadunaisky&quot; (&quot;Transdanubian&quot;) for Count Pyotr Rumyantsev for his crossing the Danube during the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)
* 1775 — &quot;Krymsky&quot; (&quot;Crimean&quot;) for Prince Vasily Mikhailovich Dolgorukov for his victories in the Crimea during the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)
* 1783 — His Serene Highness Prince &quot;Tavrichesky&quot; for Grigori Potemkin for his annexation of the Crimea and New Russia (the ancient Greeks called this area &quot;Taurida&quot;; see also Tauride Palace)
* 1789 — &quot;Rymniksky&quot; for Alexander Suvorov for his victory in the Battle of Rymnik (Russo-Turkish War of 1787–1792)
* 1799 — Prince &quot;Italiysky&quot; (&quot;Italian&quot;) for Suvorov, for the Italian Campaign of 1799 after the Battle of Trebbia
* 1813 — His Serene Highness Prince &quot;Smolensky&quot; for Mikhail Kutuzov for his 1812 defeat of Napoleon at Krasnoi near Smolensk during Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia
* 1827 — Count &quot;Erivansky&quot; for Ivan Paskevich for his capture of Erivan (Yerevan) in Armenia during the Russo-Persian War, 1826–1828
* 1829 — &quot;Zabalkansky&quot; (&quot;Transbalkan&quot;) for Count Ivan Dibich for having crossed the Balkan Mountains during the Russo-Turkish War, 1828–1829
* 1831 — His Serene Highness Prince &quot;Varshavsky&quot; (&quot;Varsovian&quot;) for Paskevich for having taken Warsaw during the Polish November Uprising of 1830–1831
* 1855 — &quot;Karssky&quot; for Count Nicholas Muravyov for his capture of Kars after the Siege of Kars

Furthermore, similar titles were awarded for comparable non-military services to the empire, e.g. in 1858 — &quot;Amursky&quot; for another Nicholas Muravyov, who had negotiated a new border between Russian and China along the Amur River under the Treaty of Aigun.

General Wrangel awarded the last victory-title in Russia (&quot;Krymsky&quot; – &quot;Crimean&quot;) unofficially after the abolition of the monarchy: to the White Lieutenant-General Yakov Aleksandrovich Slashchov in August 1920 for his defence of the Crimea in 1919–1920.

===France===

==== First Empire ====
Napoleon I, the founder of the Bonaparte dynasty and only head of the First French Empire, owed his success — both his personal rise and the growth of his empire — above all to his military excellence, and he bestowed elaborate honours on his generals, especially those raised to the supreme army rank of Marshal of the Empire.

The bestowing of a victory title (), commemorating a specific victory, was an ideal form of honour, and many incumbents were victorious marshals (or posthumously, in chief of the widow).

The highest of these titles referenced four nominal principalities, in most cases awarded as a &quot;promotion&quot; to holders of ducal victory titles:
* Marshal Davout, &quot;Prince d&#x27;Eckmühl&quot; – 1809 (extinct 1853) – also &quot;duc d&#x27;Auerstaedt&quot; (see below)
* Marshal Masséna, &quot;Prince d&#x27;Essling&quot; – 1810 – also &quot;duc de Rivoli&quot;
* Marshal Ney, &quot;Prince de la Moskowa&quot; – 1813 (extinct 1969) – also &quot; duc d&#x27;Elchingen&quot; – &quot;Bataille de la Moskowa&quot; is the French name for the Battle of Borodino of 1812
* Marshal Berthier, &quot;Prince de Wagram&quot; – 1809 (extinct 1918) – also &quot;duc de Valengin&quot;, and &quot;Prince de Neuchâtel&quot; (a sovereign title granted in 1806), neither of which were victory titles.

Next in rank came ten dukedoms:
* Marshal Ney, &quot;duc d&#x27;Elchingen&quot; – 1808 (extinct 1969) – also &quot;Prince de la Moskowa&quot;
* Marshal Lefebvre, &quot;duc de Dantzig&quot; – 28 May 1807 (extinct 1820) – Danzig was then still a city republic, which became part of Prussia after Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, and subsequently Gdańsk in Poland
* General Junot, &quot;duc d&#x27;Abrantès&quot; – 1808 (extinct 1859 but extended in female line in 1869, again extinct 1985)
* Marshal Davout, &quot;duc d&#x27;Auerstaedt&quot; – 1808 (extinct 1853, extended to collaterals) – also &quot;prince d&#x27;Eckmühl&quot;
* Marshal Augereau, &quot;duc de Castiglione&quot; – 1808 (extinct 1915)
* Marshal Lannes, &quot;duc de Montebello&quot; – 1808
* Marshal Marmont, &quot;duc de Raguse&quot; – 1808 (extinct 1852) – present-day Dubrovnik, on the Croatian coast; conquered as part of Napoleon&#x27;s own Italian kingdom, soon to become part of France&#x27;s imperial exclave the Illyrian provinces (1809–1816)
* Marshal Masséna, &quot;duc de Rivoli&quot; – 1808 – also &quot;Prince d&#x27;Essling&quot;
* Marshal Kellermann, &quot;duc de Valmy&quot; – 1808 (extinct 1868)
* Marshal Suchet, &quot;duc d&#x27;Albufera&quot; – 1813

Counts:
* Georges Mouton, &quot;comte de Lobau&quot; – 1810

====July Monarchy====
* Thomas Robert Bugeaud, &quot;duc d&#x27;Isly&quot; – 1844 (from the First Franco-Moroccan War)

====Second Empire====
In the interest of insinuating a continuation of his Uncle&#x27;s Empire, to prove legitimacy during his early reign, Napoleon III reestablished many titles that Napoleon I had issued during his own reign. During his long rule, Napoleon III also created new titles rewarding his generals for victory. 

Some of these included:
* Marshal Pélissier, &quot;duc de Malakoff&quot; – 1856 (from the Crimean War, extinct 1864)
* Marshal MacMahon, &quot;duc de Magenta&quot; – 1859 (from the Campaign of Italy; a newly invented dye took its name for the same battle)
* Charles Cousin-Montauban, &quot;comte de Palikao&quot; – 1862 (from the Second Opium War)

===British Empire===
Many victory titles have been created in the peerages of England, Great Britain and the United Kingdom. Examples include:
* Godert de Ginkell, victor at the Battle of Aughrim, was created &quot;Baron of Aughrim&quot; as a subsidiary title of the Earldom of Athlone in 1692.
* Admiral Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford, victor of the Battle of Barfleur, was created &quot;Viscount Barfleur&quot; as a subsidiary title of the Earldom of Orford in 1697.
* James Stanhope, who captured Port Mahon during the War of the Spanish Succession, was created &quot;Viscount Stanhope of Mahon&quot; in 1717.
* Sir George Augustus Eliott, victor of the Great Siege of Gibraltar, was created &quot;Lord Heathfield, Baron Heathfield of Gibraltar&quot; in 1787.
* Admiral Adam Duncan, victor of the Battle of Camperdown, was created &quot;Viscount Duncan of Camperdown&quot; in 1797. (His son was later created Earl of Camperdown.)

* Lieutenant-General Sir Arthur Wellesley (later the 1st Duke of Wellington), victor of the Battle of Douro, was in 1809 created &quot;Baron Douro&quot; as the subsidiary title granted to him with the Viscountcy of Wellington (see below). He was later, in 1814, created &quot;Marquess Douro&quot; as the subsidiary title granted to him with the Dukedom of Wellington.
* General Sir Robert Napier, who commanded the Abyssinian Expedition of 1868 and captured the fortress of Magdàla, was created &quot;Baron Napier of Magdala&quot; in 1868.
* The Earl of Dufferin, Governor-General of India during the Third Anglo-Burmese War that resulted in the annexation of Upper Burma including its former capital Ava, was created &quot;Marquess of Dufferin and Ava, in the County of Down and the Province of Burma, and Earl of Ava, in the Province of Burma&quot; in 1888.
* Field Marshal Sir Julian Byng, who played an important role in the Battle of Vimy Ridge (1917), was created &quot;Baron Byng of Vimy&quot; in 1919 and was later promoted to a viscountcy.
* Field Marshal Sir John French, the first commander of the British Expeditionary Force in the First World War, was created &quot;Earl of Ypres&quot; in 1922.
* Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, in honour of his 1942 victory in the Egyptian town of El Alamein against Rommel&#x27;s Afrikakorps, was created &quot;Viscount Montgomery of Alamein&quot; in 1946.
* Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser, victor of the Battle of North Cape in 1943, was created &quot;Baron Fraser of North Cape&quot; in 1946.
* Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, who oversaw the recapture of Burma from the Japanese, was created &quot;Viscount Mountbatten of Burma&quot; in 1946 and &quot;Earl Mountbatten of Burma&quot; in 1947.

Often the victory is commemorated in the territorial designation rather than the peerage itself. Examples include:
* Robert Clive, victor of the Battle of Plassey, was created &quot;Baron Clive, of Plassey in the County of Clare&quot; in 1767.
* The Lord Amherst, who captured Montreal during the French and Indian War, was created &quot;Baron Amherst, of Montreal in the County of Kent&quot; in 1788. Though the designation refers to Montreal Park in Kent, the estate had been named after the victory.
* Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson, victor of the Battle of the Nile, was created &quot;Baron Nelson, of the Nile and of Burnham Thorpe in the County of Norfolk&quot;, in 1798, and (by this time a Vice-Admiral) was further created &quot;Viscount Nelson, of the Nile and of Burnham Thorpe in the County of Norfolk&quot;. He was created &quot;Baron Nelson, of the Nile and of Hilborough in the County of Norfolk&quot; in August 1801. After his victory and death at the Battle of Trafalgar, his brother was created &quot;Earl Nelson, of Trafalgar and of Merton in the County of Surrey&quot;, and &quot;Viscount Merton, of Trafalgar and of Merton in the County of Surrey&quot;, in 1805, in his honour. (Nelson also earned the Dukedom of Bronte in Sicily, awarded to him in 1799 (in recognition of military support) by King Ferdinand III of the Kingdom of Sicily.)
* Lady Abercromby, widow of Sir Ralph Abercromby, victor of the Battle of Aboukir, who had died of wounds received in that battle, was created &quot;Baroness Abercromby, of Aboukir and of Tullibody in the County of Clackmannan&quot;, in 1801, in honour of her late husband.

* The Lord Combermere, who captured the fort at Bharatpur in 1826 while serving as Commander-in-Chief, India, was created &quot;Viscount Combermere, of Bhurtpore in the East Indies and Combermere in the County Palatine of Chester&quot; in 1827.
* Sir John Keane, commander at the Battle of Ghazni (1839), was created &quot;Baron Keane, of Ghuznee in Affghanistan and of Cappoquin in the County of Waterford&quot; in 1839.

* Sir Henry Hardinge, who concluded the Treaty of Lahore (1846) that ended the First Anglo-Sikh War, was created &quot;Viscount Hardinge, of Lahore and of King&#x27;s Newton in the County of Derby&quot; in 1846.
* The Earl of Dalhousie, who was Governor-General of India during the Second Anglo-Sikh War (1848-1849) that resulted in the British annexation of the Punjab, was created &quot;Marquess of Dalhousie, of Dalhousie Castle in the County of Edinburgh, and of the Punjab&quot; in 1849.
* Hugh Henry Rose, who captured Jhansi (1858) during the Indian Mutiny, was created &quot;Baron Strathnairn, of Strathnairn in the County of Nairn and of Jhansi in the East Indies&quot; in 1866.
* Sir John Lawrence, who served as Chief Commissioner of the Punjab during the Indian Mutiny of 1857-1859, was created &quot;Baron Lawrence, of the Punjab and of Grateley in the County of Southampton&quot; in 1869.

* Major-General Sir Herbert Kitchener, in recognition of his victory in the Battle of Omdurman (1898), was created &quot;Baron Kitchener, of Khartoum and of Aspall in the County of Suffolk&quot; (Khartoum being the less obscure but relatively nearby capital of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan), in 1898. In 1902 (by this time a full General) he was further created &quot;Viscount Kitchener of Khartoum, of Khartoum and of the Vaal in the Colony of Transvaal and of Aspall in the County of Suffolk&quot; (having been Administrator of Transvaal and of the Orange River Colony in 1901). In June 1914 (having achieved the rank of Field Marshal in 1909) he was further created &quot;Earl Kitchener of Khartoum and of Broome, of Khartoum and of Broome in the County of Kent&quot;.

* Field Marshal Sir Edmund Allenby, victor of the Battle of Megiddo (1918), was created &quot;Viscount Allenby, of Megiddo and of Felixstowe in the County of Suffolk&quot;, in 1919.
* Field Marshal Sir Herbert Plumer, commander in the Battle of Messines (1917), was created &quot;Baron Plumer, of Messines and of Bilton in the County of York&quot;, in 1919 and &quot;Viscount Plumer, of Messines and of Bilton in the County of York&quot;, in 1929.

* Field Marshal Sir Edmund Ironside, who commanded the British forces around Arkhangelsk in the North Russia Campaign of 1918-1920, was created &quot;Baron Ironside, of Archangel and Ironside in the County of Aberdeen&quot;, in 1941.
* Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson, a senior British general in the Second World War, was created &quot;Baron Wilson, of Libya and of Stowlangtoft in the County of Suffolk&quot;, in 1946.

===Austrian Empire===
In the Austrian empire titles of nobility could be amended with territorial designations, the so-called &quot;predicates&quot;. These were usually named after the estates of the family in question, but sometimes the Habsburg rulers of Austria also granted victory titles. This happened particularly during World War I (1914-1918). Examples include:
* Colonel General Viktor Dankl, who in 1914 defeated Russian forces in the Battle of Kraśnik. When he was made a Graf (count) in 1918, he received the title of &quot;Graf Dankl von Krasnik&quot;.
* Colonel General Josef Roth, who played a decisive role in the Battle of Limanowa in 1914, when the Austro-Hungarian Army repelled a Russian breakthrough, was ennobled as Freiherr (baron) in 1918 with the style of &quot;Freiherr Roth von Limanowa-Lapanów&quot;.
* Major General Ignaz Trollmann, whose XIX. Corps helped to conquer the Lovćen mountain near Kotor in 1916, was ennobled as Freiherr (baron) in 1917 with the style of &quot;Freiherr Trollmann von Lovcenberg&quot;.

===Kingdom of Hungary===
The system used in the Kingdom of Hungary by the Habsburgs resembled the one employed in Austria. Titles of nobility could be amended with territorial designations, also called &quot;predicates&quot;. These were usually named after the estates of the family in question, but sometimes also specific victory titles were granted. Examples include:
* General Baron Pál Kray de Krajova et Topolya (1705–1804), who received the predicate &quot;de Krajova&quot; or &quot;Krajovai&quot; after he conquered the Romanian town of Craiova during the Austro-Turkish War (1787–1791).
* Colonel General Stefan Sarkotić, the Commanding General in Bosnia and Herzegovina during World War I, was ennobled as a Hungarian baron and the style of &quot;Baron Sarkotić von Lovćen&quot; in early 1917 after Trollmann&#x27;s XIX. Corps had conquered the Lovćen mountain near Kotor.
* Sándor Szurmay was created baron by King Charles IV with the predicate &quot;de Uzsok&quot; or &quot;Uzsoki&quot;. He was the hero of the battle of Uzsok (March 1915).

During the Regency of Hungary after World War I, the Regent Miklós Horthy was not authorized to grant titles of nobility, but conferred the Order of Vitéz which sometimes but necessarily also carried noble predicates. Initially membership was restricted to men who had served with special distinction in the war. Examples commemorating military action include:
* Captain Rihmer de Granasztó granted the title &quot;vitéz Gerlefalvi&quot; for his bravery at Gerlefalva, today Girovce, Slovakia.

===Kingdom of Italy===
The Kingdom of Italy under the House of Savoy of Piemonte-Sardinia granted many victory titles. The practice of bestowing such titles became especially common after the unification of Italy and again after World War I, when the Mussolini government (1922–1943) made a number of nominations. Examples include:
* General Enrico Cialdini, created &quot;Duca di Gaeta&quot; for his role during the Siege of Gaeta (1860). This was the concluding event of the war between the Kingdom of Sardinia and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, through which Cialdini&#x27;s Piemonte-Sardinian forces secured victory over King Francis II of the Two Sicilies. The choice of this title was somewhat ironic as it had been the name of a Napoleonic &quot;duché grand-fief&quot; but only the withdrawal of the French fleet made the bombardment of Gaeta from the sea by Cialdini&#x27;s forces possible.
* General Armando Diaz, created 1st &quot;Duca della Vittoria&quot; (&quot;Duke of the Victory&quot;) in 1922. He had been the Chief of Staff of the Italian Army (1917–1918) during World War I.
* Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, created 1st &quot;Duca del Mare&quot; (&quot;Duke of the Sea&quot;) in 1922. He had been the Chief of the Italian Naval Staff (1913–1915 and 1917–1919) during World War I.
* Commodore Luigi Rizzo, created 1st &quot;Conte di Grado e di Premuda&quot; for his services as naval commander in World War I during which he also sank the Austrian battleship SMS &quot;Szent István&quot;.
* Costanzo Ciano, created 1st &quot;Conte di Cortellazzo e di Buccari&quot;, a naval commander in World War I and President of the Italian Chamber of Deputies between 1934 and 1939.
* Cesare Maria De Vecchi, created 1st &quot;Conte di Val Cismon&quot; in memory of the battles fought by his arditi on Monte Grappa in 1918. Later served as colonial administrator and Fascist politician.
* Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio, created 1st &quot;Principe di Montenevoso&quot; in 1924 for his services as poet, journalist, novelist, dramatist and aviator during World War I.
* Marshal Pietro Badoglio, created 1st &quot;Marchese del Sabotino&quot; and later 1st &quot;Duca di Addis Abeba&quot; after the invasion of Abyssinia in 1935.
* General Rodolfo Graziani, created 1st &quot;Marchese di Neghelli&quot; for his services as leader of military expeditions in Africa before and during World War II.
* Prince Maurizio Ferrante Gonzaga di Vescovato, created 1st &quot;Marchese del Vodice&quot; in 1932. Also received the Gold Medal of Military Valor. (Full Titles and decorations, in Italian)

===Other monarchies===
* The Spanish crown has awarded similar titles such as Adelantado which was used as a military title held by some Spanish conquistadors of the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. Other titles include such as Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo (hereditary) for the English Viscount Wellington (later Duke of Wellington). General O&#x27;Donnell was granted the title Duke of Tetuán by Isabella II after his success at the Battle of Tétouan. José Malcampo, 3rd Marquess of San Rafael, Prime Minister of Spain in 1871, during the reign of Amadeo I, was granted the titles of Count of Jolo and Viscount of Mindanao after he victoriously took the city of Jolo from the Sultanate of Sulu during his governorship-general (1874-1877) of the Philippines.
* So did the Portuguese kingdom, as Duque da Vitória (Duke of Victory), Marquês de Torres Vedras (from the Lines of Torres Vedras of 1809-1810) and Conde de Vimeiro (from the Battle of Vimeiro of 1808) awarded to the Duke of Wellington.
* The Kingdom of Naples awarded the title of Conte di Maida (Count of Maida) to British general John Stuart, commemorating the Battle of Maida in 1806.
* The Dutch royal house of Orange, then of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, created the first Duke of Wellington Prince of Waterloo (in Belgium) in 1815.

<text>The Indian Placement Program (IPP) or Indian Student Placement Program (ISPP), also called the Lamanite Placement Program, was operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in the United States, officially operating from 1954 and virtually closed by 1996. It had its peak during the 1960s and 1970s. Native American students who were baptized members of the LDS Church were placed in foster homes of LDS members during the school year. They attended majority-white public schools, rather than the Indian boarding schools or local schools on the reservations. The program&#x27;s goal was to &quot;introduce Native Americans to mainstream values and social roles without demanding the abandonment of the old for the new.&quot;

The program was developed according to LDS theology, whereby conversion and assimilation to Mormonism could help Native Americans, who had been classified as Lamanites in terms of theology in the Book of Mormon. An estimated 50,000 Native American children went through the program. The foster placement was intended to help develop leadership among Native Americans and assimilate them into majority-American culture. The cost of care was borne by the foster parents, and financially stable families were selected by the church. Most of these placements took place on the Navajo Nation, with a peak participation of 5,000 students in 1972. The program decreased in size after the 1970s, due to criticism, changing mores among Native Americans, and restriction of the program to high school students as schools improved on reservations. Many of the students and families praised the program; others criticized it and the LDS Church for weakening the Native Americans&#x27; ties to their own cultures.

In 2016 through 2018, ten plaintiffs filed suit in the Navajo Nation Tribal Court, alleging they had been sexually abused while in the foster program, and the LDS Church did not adequately protect them. The cases were settled in 2018.

==History==

===Precursors===

During the earliest days of the LDS Church in Utah, Mormons often raised Native American children in their homes. Leader Brigham Young advocated buying children held by Native Americans and Mexican traders as slaves (a legal practice in the Utah Territory prior to the American Civil War), freeing them from slavery, and encouraged Latter-day Saints to educate and acculturate the children as if they were their own.

LDS theology suggests that the Native Americans have a special status. It held that Book of Mormon people had two distinct phenotypes: Nephites, who initially &quot;were a civil and a delightsome people;&quot; and Lamanites, who were at times &quot;wild, and ferocious, and a blood-thirsty people.&quot; In the Book of Mormon narrative, the Lamanites ultimately became the more righteous of the two groups as the Nephites fell into apostasy and were destroyed. The Book of Mormon insists that the Lamanites would survive the destruction of the Nephites and would, in turn, be &quot;brought unto salvation&quot;, and be &quot;[restored] again to the knowledge of the truth&quot;.

The Indian Student Placement Program (ISPP) of the mid-20th century developed from an informal placement in 1947 in Richfield, Utah, by the LDS Church. A 16-year-old Navajo teenager, Helen John, asked permission to stay in the city to go to school. As a result, Golden Buchanan and Miles Jensen organized an informal placement program under the direction of Spencer W. Kimball, who was raised in southeastern Arizona, was the chairman of the church&#x27;s Committee on Indian Relationships. With her parents&#x27; permission, Helen was allowed to stay with the Buchanan family, whom she knew in Richfield. This arrangement was not an official program, but it was the basis for the Indian Placement Program that would later be established. The Buchanans agreed to take in other children as well, and that year three students were placed into the unofficial program. These arrangements continued, and by 1954 there were some 68 Native American students (mostly from the Navajo Nation) placed into foster homes in four different western states.

The ISPP worked to instill Western notions of industry through the imposition of an ethno-religious identity. The Lamanite identity defined Indians as culturally and spiritually apostate Israelites destined for latter-day restoration through an internalized Protestant work ethic. Although some rejected this theological identity others found it a point of strength and empowerment as they attended schools and participated in specific ISPP efforts to develop Western leadership patterns among Native American participants.

===Organization of the Indian Placement Program===

The success of these students led to the church establishing a formal placement program in July 1954, under the Church Social Services, which was part of the Relief Society. Under this program, a social worker was assigned to each Native American foster child. A reception center was built in Richfield to accommodate the large numbers of participants. Buses and other transportation were arranged to bring children to the center where they would be fed, receive medical examinations, and be introduced to their foster families. Students participated from the Navajo Nation and other tribes in the Southwest, as well as some from other parts of the United States.

When the program became institutionalized, there were some complaints that LDS missionaries were assigned to recruit new participants. In 1956, the Bureau of Indian Affairs received complaints that the placement program was being used to increase the church&#x27;s proselytizing efforts. The governments of Utah and Arizona in March 1957 met with church representatives to address the issue. As a result, caseworkers rather than missionaries were given the responsibility of making the final decision for acceptance of students into the Indian Placement Program.

In order for children to participate in the program, their parents had to request their placement. Foster parents were recommended by local bishops and were expected to provide free room, board, and clothing for the Native American children. These children had to be at least eight years old, baptized as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and be in good standing in the church and in good health.

In October 1960, Kimball discussed the program at the General Conference. He said that Natives who participated in the program were gradually turning lighter, becoming &quot;white and delightsome&quot;. &quot;The day of the Lamanites is nigh&quot;, Kimball said, claiming that Navajo placement students were &quot;as light as Anglos&quot; and, in one case, several shades lighter than parents &quot;on the same reservation, in the same hogan, subject to the same sun and wind and weather.&quot;

====Development====
Some families had their children baptized in the church in order to gain the opportunity to go to school off the reservation. To avoid this, in the 1950s and 1960s, the church added new requirements for acceptance of children into the program. In 1969, the Unified Social Services was established in the church; this became the administrative body to run the Indian Placement Program. In 1973 it was renamed and organized as LDS Social Services.

By 1972, nearly 5,000 Native Americans were living in foster homes through this program. Some students went on to study at Brigham Young University (BYU), earning college degrees. In 1971 they created a performance group of singers and dancers called &quot;The Lamanite Generation&quot; but later renamed Living Legends. Among their pieces was &quot;Go My Son&quot;, a song referring to the &quot;ladder of education&quot;, written by Arliene Nofchissey and Carnes Burson.

In 1972 local priesthood leaders were given the responsibility for recruiting and screening new students. Due to strong criticism and rising Native American activism, the program had nearly been discontinued in 1977. The US government commissioned a study under the Interstate Compact Secretariat, which oversaw educational efforts. It heard much praise from Native American families for the program. After assessing the program results and hearing testimonial from participants and foster families, the church decided to continue it.

After 1972, the number of students that participated in the program decreased. By the late 1970s, the number of participants in the Indian Placement Program was around 2,500. In response to the improvement of local schools developed on the reservations in preference to boarding schools, in the 1980s the Indian Placement Program limited participants to high-school students; the number of students dropped to 500 in 1990. In 1996 there were virtually no more participants, although the last graduated in 2000.

In the 1970s, the Indian Placement Program was directed to emphasize creating stronger bonds and increased communication between the natural families and the selected foster families. The goal of the program was to &quot;introduce Native Americans to mainstream values and social roles without demanding the abandonment of the old for the new.&quot; According to the Maxwell Institute of BYU, it attempted to help Native Americans receive more formal education and training, while helping them maintain their identity.

==Results==

At least three studies of the outcomes of the IPP, published in 1977, 1997, and 2025, have reported mostly positive results, and relied primarily on interviews of Native Americans involved.

The 1997 study gathered the oral histories of twenty-three participants from the Navajo Reservation in order to better understand the effects of the IPP. All of the subjects were around 33 years old at the time of the study and were born on the Navajo reservation. The sample consisted of 22 interviewees. The group consisted of seven men and fifteen women. At any one time, this ratio indicated the Program&#x27;s ratio. All of them had completed high school, ten had attended college, and four had received college diplomas. When the program began, all of the participants were of varying ages. Fourteen of the students were under the age of ten, eighteen were under the age of thirteen, and the remaining three were in their senior or junior year of high school. Fourteen percent had three or more foster families, 43 percent had a single foster family, and another 43 percent had two separate foster families. According to the study, the average length of time spent in the program was about seven years. The participants in the study all reported being members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

The results reported were predominantly success stories. As recorded, about one-third of the participants stayed in the program until graduation from high school. 40 percent of students decided to drop out of the program, and 15 percent of students left the program because of their parents&#x27; wishes or needs. Students who did drop out were still more likely to finish high school than were Native American peers who had not participated in the program. Students in the Indian Placement Program had an 82 percent graduation rate. Studies found that the &quot;longer students remained in the program, the more likely they were to be employed and to earn high incomes&quot; and also to marry. One review of studies and the program&#x27;s history summarized: &quot;The program was impressively successful so far as its educational goals were concerned, but the record was less impressive when it came to religiosity.&quot;

The 2025 study gathered the oral histories of 20 participants and 25 other parties. Three main themes emerged: positive and negative experiences with education, the LDS baptism requirement, and relationships within foster families.

Not many studies of the outcomes of the IPP have been conducted by Native Americans, but at least one survey of the program was published in Indian Country Today News.

The church&#x27;s new four-volume history, &quot;&quot;, follows the story of Maeta Holiday, who was born on the Navajo Reservation. The history follows Holiday&#x27;s situation on the reservation, her years in Los Angeles in the IPP with her 1972 high school graduation at age 18, and her entrance to BYU.

==Criticism==

Beginning in the 1970s the Indian Placement Program was increasingly criticized. In 1977, the U.S. government commissioned a study to investigate accusations that the church was using its influence to push children into joining the program. The commission found that the program was largely positive, and enjoyed emphatic support both from Native American parents and white foster parents. Critics &quot;view intervention as an intrusion on the right to be fully Native American, a weakening of cultural pluralism, and a cause of psychological damage.&quot;

===Sexual abuse litigation===

In the spring of 2016, two plaintiffs filed suit in the Window Rock District of the Navajo Nation District Court (a tribal court), alleging they had been sexually abused for years while in the foster program, roughly from the years 1965 to 1983, and the LDS Church did not adequately protect them. The church filed suit in federal district court in Salt Lake City, alleging that the Tribal Court did not have jurisdiction and seeking an injunction &quot;to stay the proceedings from moving forward under tribal jurisdiction.&quot; Federal district court judge Robert Shelby denied the church&#x27;s motion to dismiss and also ruled that it first had to &quot;exhaust all remedies&quot; in Tribal Court. This is considered a major victory for tribal jurisprudence.

In total, ten plaintiffs filed suit between 2016 and 2018. After primarily disputing over tribal versus federal jurisdiction of the cases, rather than proceeding to trial, the cases of all but one of the plaintiffs were settled between the parties in 2018.

<text>Palmitos Park is a botanical garden, aviary and zoo on the island of Gran Canaria, Canary Islands, Spain.

==Geography &amp; climate==
The park is located in a countryside area, near Pilancones Natural Park, towards south of the island; about north of the tourist beaches and dunes of Maspalomas, but towards the interior. The park has a humid subtropical climate.

==Layout==
There is a terrace near a fountain, along a path that leads up to the amphitheater where flying birds of prey perform in shows. Next to the amphitheater there is a snack bar, and a small cafe can be found in the park.

One feature of the park is the great wealth of cacti and succulents. There are over 160 different cactus types, and 1000 palm trees of 42 different types.

Parrot-like birds are well represented in the park, but other types of birds can also be found, including swans and ducks. Overall, there are over 1,500 exotic birds of 230 different species. Many fly freely around the park.

Palmitos Park holds Europe&#x27;s largest butterfly venue, as well as the biggest Orchid collection on the island.

Near the exit - behind the souvenir shop, one can admire hummingbirds that fly very visibly in front of their food.

==Sections of the park==
*Butterfly house with (mainly living) butterflies.
*Pond with water birds
*Dolphinarium with 6 dolphins, and live dolphin shows interacting with the audience.
*Dolphin Photo Opportunity where members of the public can have their photo taken while stroking a dolphin (additional fee)

==2007 Gran Canaria forest fires==
On July 31, 2007 it was reported in the media that almost 65% of the park was burned due to ten forest fires, and that some exotic bird species - such as the toucan - may have been killed. The forest fires caused evacuations of certain parts of Gran Canaria and Tenerife. A local Forest Ranger was accused of starting the fires intentionally in order to keep him in employment as his contract was due to expire.

Over 2000 people from the village of Mogán were evacuated, as well as El Salobre. No human people died during the fire, but many houses were burned to the ground. Smoke was clearly visible from space.

Because Palmitos Park was severely affected by the fire, it was closed for a whole year. The park opened for the public again August 4, 2008. It has a new section with information about the forest fire.

<doc id="399047" wikidata="Q6290022" url="?curid=399047" title="Joshua Lionel Cowen">
<text>Joshua Lionel Cowen (August 25, 1877 – September 8, 1965), born Joshua Lionel Cohen, was an American inventor and cofounder of Lionel Corporation, a manufacturer of model railroads and toy trains who gained prominence in the market before and after World War II.

==Early life==

Joshua Lionel was born in Queens, New York City on August 25, 1877 to Hyman Nathan Cohen and his wife Rebecca (née Kantrowitz) Cohen; he had eight siblings. His parents were Jewish immigrants from Germany. 

Cohen had built his first toy train at age seven, attaching a small steam engine to a wooden locomotive he had carved. The engine exploded, damaging his parents&#x27; kitchen. He studied at Columbia University and the City College of New York.

==Business career==
Cohen received his first patent in 1899, for a device that ignited a photographer&#x27;s flash. The same year, he was awarded a defense contract from the United States Navy to produce mine fuses, earning $12,000.

== Lionel Corporation ==
Cohen and his associate Harry Grant founded Lionel Corporation in New York City in 1900. Sources disagree on what inspired this action. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he devised a battery-powered fan for his shop, then connected the fan&#x27;s motor to a small model train. &quot;The Record&quot; (Hackensack, New Jersey) states that Cohen designed his model train after seeing a stationary model train in a department store window. A Manhattan shopkeeper bought Cowen&#x27;s first electric train in 1901 and used it as a storefront display. After customers indicated that they wanted to buy the display, the shopkeeper bought six more trains.

After expanding the production of toy trains and building his business, in 1910 Cohen legally changed his surname to &quot;Cowen&quot;, for reasons unknown. There had been waves of Jewish immigrants from Germany and eastern Europe to the United States, and many others also adopted anglicized names. Cowen often gave his birthdate as 1880, but his birth was recorded three years earlier. 

After World War I, Lionel had become one of the top three manufacturers in the United States of electrical trains. It competed with American Flyer and Louis Marx and Company. By the early 1950s, Lionel had expanded into other lines and become the world&#x27;s largest toy manufacturer. But interest in model trains declined in the postwar period with the decline in passenger travel, rise of automobiles, and development of the space program. Despite efforts, the company continued to lose money. 

Cowen retired in 1959, selling his 55,000 shares of Lionel stock to his grand-nephew Roy Cohn. He died on September 8, 1965, in Palm Beach, Florida. His body was returned to New York, where he is interred at Union Field Cemetery in Ridgewood, Queens.

==Marriage and family==
In 1905 he married Cecilia Liberman, known as &quot;Mimia&quot;. They had two children together. After her death in 1946, he later married again, to Lillian (Appel) Herman in 1949.

<doc id="399050" wikidata="Q3395525" url="?curid=399050" title="Jo Brand">
<text>Josephine Grace Brand (born 23 July 1957) is an English actress, comedian, presenter and writer. Starting her entertainment career with a move from psychiatric nursing to the alternative comedy stand-up scene and early performances on &quot;Saturday Live&quot;, she went on to appear on &quot;The Brain Drain&quot;, Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Jo Brand Through the Cakehole&quot;, &quot;Getting On&quot; and various television appearances including as a regular guest on &quot;QI&quot;, &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; and &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot;. She also makes regular appearances on BBC Radio 4 in programmes such as &quot;The News Quiz&quot; and &quot;Just a Minute&quot;. Since 2014 she has been the presenter of &quot;The Great British Bake Off: An Extra Slice&quot;. In 2003, Brand was listed in &quot;The Observer&quot; as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy.

==Early life==
Brand was born in Clapham, London, near St Paul&#x27;s Church in a house which was &quot;a little terraced Victorian place on the Wandsworth Road with an outside toilet&quot;, and grew up in Hastings, East Sussex. Her mother was a social worker at Charing Cross Hospital and her father was a structural engineer. Her father suffered from depression and her parents separated when Brand was a teenager. Brand is the middle of three children, with two brothers. When she was about four, the family moved to the village of St Mary&#x27;s Platt near Sevenoaks in Kent, and a year later, to Benenden. Brand was educated at St Mary&#x27;s Platt Primary School, Benenden Village Primary School, Tunbridge Wells Girls&#x27; Grammar School until the age of 16, Hastings High School for Girls and Bexhill College.

==Career==
===Early===
After working in a pub, for Barnardo&#x27;s, and as a nursing assistant in a residential unit for adults with learning disabilities she took a joint social science degree with a Registered Mental Nurse qualification at Brunel University. She then worked as a psychiatric nurse for ten years, at the South London Bethlem hospital, Cefn Coed Hospital in Swansea and Maudsley Hospital in south London.

===Comedy===
When Brand began her career in comedy, she used the stage name the &quot;Sea Monster&quot;. She was part of the British alternative comedy movement, working in London alternative comedy clubs in the mid-1980s, and appearing initially on the &quot;Saturday Live&quot; television show. She shared a flat with fellow comic and comedy club owner Ivor Dembina.

Brand&#x27;s early style involved her delivering jokes in a bored monotone, one line at a time, with pauses in between. It drew heavily from pop culture and the media, with many jokes containing references to celebrities and public figures. Brand has said that she drank heavily before her first gig, was heckled throughout, and received no applause at the end of the set. Her Doc Marten boots, large size and short hair led to false rumours that she was a lesbian.

In 2007, Brand narrated &quot;Laughter &amp; Tears: The Les Dawson Story&quot;, a documentary tribute to Les Dawson, which was broadcast on BBC Radio 2 in October 2007.

In 2010, Brand took part in &quot;Channel 4&#x27;s Comedy Gala&quot;, a benefit show held in aid of Great Ormond Street Children&#x27;s Hospital, filmed live at the O2 Arena in London on 30 March.

Brand played the Demon Dinner Lady in the British live-action film &quot;Horrid Henry: The Movie&quot; (2011). She also provided a voice-over for the Lyric, Hammersmith Theatre&#x27;s 2011 pantomime &quot;Aladdin&quot;.

In August 2015, Brand judged the first ever Class Clowns competition at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, she also announced the winner at the Gilded Balloon on the night.

Brand wrote a feature-film adaptation of her novel &quot;The More You Ignore Me&quot;. The film was released in 2018.

===Television===
In 1993, Brand became a resident panellist, along with Tony Hawks, on BBC monologue show &quot;The Brain Drain&quot;. Her transition into mainstream television continued when she starred in her own series on Channel 4, &quot;Jo Brand Through the Cakehole&quot;, co-written with comedy writer Jim Miller, who was already her main stand-up writer. Brand has had several solo television series, and presented shows such as &quot;Jo Brand&#x27;s Commercial Breakdown&quot;. She had a cameo appearance in an episode of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; entitled &quot;New Best Friend&quot; (1994), and also appeared on &quot;Star Spell&quot;, a spin-off from &quot;Hard Spell&quot; in 2004.

Her television success continued with guest appearances on shows such as &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; and &quot;QI&quot;, to the extent where she became the most frequently appearing guest on the latter, appearing in a total of 34 episodes. As a fan of &quot;Countdown&quot;, Brand achieved an ambition when she was invited to appear in the show&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary Corner&quot; as the celebrity guest. She later became a friend of the host, Richard Whiteley, and after his death in 2005 attended his memorial service at York Minster. She has appeared on &quot;Countdown&quot; as a Dictionary Corner guest 88 times.

In 2004, Brand appeared in a special episode of &quot;What Not to Wear&quot;, where fashion gurus Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine gave her a makeover.

On 25 March 2007, Brand appeared on &quot;Play It Again&quot;, where she was required to learn how to play the organ in just four months. This was in preparation to perform Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s Toccata and Fugue in D Minor for an audience of 8,000 people at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall on the second largest pipe organ in the United Kingdom. In order to practise her performance, she played &quot;Dear Lord and Father of Mankind&quot;, a favourite hymn of hers at a church service in her former village church in Benenden, Kent, and accompanied dancers at Blackpool Tower. Prior to this, her only experiences with musical instruments had been childhood piano and violin lessons.

==Personal life==

Brand married Bernie Bourke, a psychiatric nurse, in 1997 in Shropshire. They have two daughters, Maisie Bourke and Eliza Bourke. Her husband and two daughters are vegetarian, but Brand prefers to &quot;pursue pork-pies in service stations when no-one is looking&quot;.

Brand delivered a guest lecture on the subject of psychiatric nursing for the University of Derby Psychology Society in 1997 in return for a donation to Derby Rape Crisis. Also in 1997, she opened at Lambeth Hospital in South London, the first major exhibition of the Adamson Collection since the death of Edward Adamson, the pioneer of Art Therapy, in 1996.

In February 2009, Brand was among a group of British entertainers who wrote an open letter to &quot;The Times&quot; of London in support of the leaders of the Baháʼí Faith who were then on trial in Iran.

===Charity===

Brand is a supporter of the charity ActionAid and has taken part in fundraising events for the organisation.

In November 2014, Brand was a part of Gareth Malone&#x27;s &quot;All Star Choir&quot;, who released a cover version of &quot;Wake Me Up&quot; to raise money for the BBC&#x27;s Children in Need.

On 28 January 2016, Brand completed a 150-mile walk across Britain, in aid of Sport Relief, in Liverpool. Brand crossed the finish line at the Albert Dock at 7.30pm, having set off from the banks of the River Humber on 22 January. Her efforts were shown in a 60-minute documentary, which aired on 17 March 2016, called &quot;Jo Brand&#x27;s Hell of a Walk for Sport Relief&quot;.

Brand is a patron of the National Self Harm Network (NSHN), International Animal Rescue, and the Prader-Willi Syndrome Association, as well as London Nightline. She is the president of the Ectopic Pregnancy Trust.

Brand is an ambassador for the Alzheimer&#x27;s Society.

===Political views===
Brand is a supporter of the Labour Party. She was still a contributor to and supporter of the party in 2012.

Brand introduced and spoke at the celebration of Michael Foot&#x27;s life at London&#x27;s Lyric Theatre, Shaftesbury Avenue, on 8 November 2010. She is also a republican. In January 2012, she gave the South Shields annual lecture at Harton Technology College alongside the Member of Parliament (MP) for the town, David Miliband.

In August 2014, Brand was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

Brand is a supporter of the Women&#x27;s Equality Party.

In June 2019, Brand was featured in the BBC Radio 4 comedy show &quot;Heresy&quot;, after a number of right-wing and far-right European election candidates had been doused with milkshakes during campaign walkabouts the previous month. Brand said &quot;Why bother with a milkshake when you could get some battery acid?&quot; She later added: &quot;That&#x27;s just me, sorry, I&#x27;m not gonna do it, it&#x27;s purely a fantasy, but I think milk shakes are pathetic, I honestly do. Sorry.&quot; The BBC later defended Brand, explaining &quot;the jokes made on &quot;Heresy&quot; are deliberately provocative as the title implies&quot; and that they were &quot;not intended to be taken seriously&quot;. The Prime Minister at the time, Theresa May, queried whether a joke about throwing battery acid was &quot;appropriate content&quot; for a BBC broadcast and the BBC later announced that the remark would be edited out of any future broadcasts. The Metropolitan Police confirmed that it had &quot;received an allegation of incitement to violence that was reported to the MPS on 13 June&quot;. and that they were investigating the matter. Appearing at an event in Henley, Oxfordshire, on the same day, the comedian was said to have apologised for making the joke, saying &quot;Looking back it probably was somewhat a crass and ill-judged joke that might upset people.&quot; It was understood that the allegation reported to the police was not made by Nigel Farage or the Brexit Party. Ofcom said it has received 65 complaints about the episode of &quot;Heresy&quot;. The police dropped the investigation two days later. On 29 August 2019, the BBC&#x27;s Executive Complaints Unit (ECU) partially upheld complaints about the joke, saying: &#x27;Whilst the ECU recognised that the wider message from this episode is an argument for more civility in political discourse, not less, and Ms Brand&#x27;s contribution is not intended to be taken as face value, the ECU felt that it went beyond what was appropriate for the show.&#x27;

In a 2018 interview, Brand recalled an incident where she was forcibly kissed by a financial trader during a charity event in Canary Wharf, commenting that she chose not to report the incident because &#x27;it would ruin the day and I was worried no one would believe me&#x27;.

==Awards and honours==
On 17 July 2007 Brand was awarded an honorary doctorate for her work as a psychiatric nurse from the University of Glamorgan (now the University of South Wales). Professor Donna Mead, Dean of the School of Health, Sport and Science, who read Brand up for the award commented, &quot;Jo incorporates much of her experience working in the field of mental health into her current work as a comedian. This has increased awareness of the work done by nurses in the mental health field. She has also used her experiences of working with individuals with conditions such as Alzheimer&#x27;s to promote awareness of and raise funds for the Alzheimer&#x27;s Society.&quot;

In December 2007 she received a &quot;Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing&quot; Lifetime Achievement Award, an award associated with the Eileen Skellern Memorial Lecture. At this event she was praised for making mental health nursing more visible to the general public.

In October 2009, she was awarded an Honorary Degree from the University of Suffolk.

In January 2014, Brand was awarded a second honorary doctorate from Canterbury Christ Church University, for her work in raising awareness of mental health issues and challenging the stigma surrounding such illnesses.

<text>Thomas Reid Pearson (born 1956) is an American writer. Pearson also writes crime fiction under the pen name Rick Gavin.

==Biography==
Pearson was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He was a student at North Carolina State University, where he gained a BA and MA in English. He went on to teach at Peace College in Raleigh, North Carolina. He started work on a PhD in Pennsylvania but soon returned to North Carolina, where he worked as a carpenter and a housepainter while he began writing his first two novels, &quot;A Short History of a Small Place&quot; and &quot;Off for the Sweet Hereafter&quot;. Neither was published until 1985, when he moved to New York City, where both books were issued by Linden Press.

His novels are set in the South, in the imaginary small town of Neely, near Winston–Salem, or, in his recent novels, in the Appalachian areas of Virginia, where he now lives. His writing captures a uniquely Southern social order, outlook, and voice and has been compared to the work of Mark Twain and William Faulkner.

&quot;A Short History of a Small Place&quot;, &quot;Off for the Sweet Hereafter&quot;, &quot;The Last of How It Was&quot;, &quot;Cry Me a River&quot;, &quot;Polar&quot; and &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; were &quot;New York Times&quot; Notable Books.

Pearson collaborated with John Grisham on early drafts of the screenplays for &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; (1997) and &quot;Runaway Jury&quot; (1998), films based on two of Grisham&#x27;s novels.

Under the pen name Rick Gavin, Pearson wrote a series of three crime novels, set in the Mississippi Delta, featuring repo man Nick Reid and his best friend, Desmond.

Pearson lives in North Carolina.

<text>Hat Trick Productions Limited is an independent British production company that produces television and radio programmes, mainly specialising in comedy, based in London. The company&#x27;s logo is depicted as a rabbit pulling a man out of a hat instead of the other way around.

Hat Trick Productions was founded in 1986 by Rory McGrath, Jimmy Mulville, and Denise O&#x27;Donoghue. Its first commission was &quot;Chelmsford 123&quot;, a situation comedy for Channel 4.

Perkins left the organisation in 1995, to become head of comedy for BBC Television.

Hat Trick International struck a first look deal with Cardiff Productions and has a joint venture with British television writer Jed Mercurio called HTM Television, with this production company responsible for dramas such as &quot;Bloodlands&quot; with James Nesbitt and the forthcoming &quot;DI Ray&quot; with Parminder Nagra.

<doc id="399058" wikidata="Q2592428" url="?curid=399058" title="History of Kashmir">
<text>The history of [[Kashmir]] is intertwined with the history of the broader Indian subcontinent in South Asia with influences from the surrounding regions of Central, and East Asia. Historically, Kashmir referred to only the Kashmir Valley of the western Himalayas. Today, it denotes a larger area that includes the Indian-administered union territories of Jammu and Kashmir (which consists of Jammu and the Kashmir Valley), Ladakh, the Pakistan-administered territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, and the Chinese-administered regions of Aksai Chin and the Trans-Karakoram Tract.

In the first half of the 1st millennium, the Kashmir region became an important centre of Hinduism and later—under the Mauryas and Kushanas—of Buddhism. Later in the ninth century, during the rule of the Karkota Dynasty, a native tradition of Shaivism arose. It flourished in the seven centuries of Hindu rule, continuing under the Utpala and the Lohara dynasties, ending in mid-14th century.

The spread of Islam in Kashmir began during the 13th century, accelerated under Muslim rule during the 14th and 15th centuries, and led to the eventual decline of Kashmiri Shaivism in the region.

In 1339, Shah Mir became the first Muslim ruler of Kashmir, inaugurating the Shah Mir dynasty. For the next five centuries, Muslim monarchs ruled Kashmir, including the Mughal Empire, who ruled from 1586 until 1751, and the Afghan Durrani Empire, which ruled from 1747 until 1819. That year, the Sikhs, under Ranjit Singh, annexed Kashmir. In 1846, after the Sikh defeat in the First Anglo-Sikh War, the Treaty of Lahore was signed and upon the purchase of the region from the British under the Treaty of Amritsar, the Raja of Jammu, Gulab Singh, became the new ruler of Kashmir. The rule of his descendants, under the paramountcy (or tutelage) of the British Crown, lasted until 1947, when the former princely state became a disputed territory, now administered by three countries: India, Pakistan, and the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

==Etymology==
According to folk etymology, the name &quot;Kashmir&quot; means &quot;desiccated land&quot; (from the Sanskrit: = water and = desiccate). In the &quot;Rajatarangini,&quot; a history of Kashmir written by Kalhana in the mid-12th century, it is stated that the valley of Kashmir was formerly a lake. According to Hindu mythology, the lake was drained by the great rishi or sage, Kashyapa, son of Marichi, son of Brahma, by cutting the gap in the hills at Baramulla (&quot;Varaha-mula&quot;). When Kashmir had been drained, Kashyapa asked Brahmins to settle there. This is still the local tradition, and in the existing physical condition of the country, there is some ground for the story which has taken this form. The name of Kashyapa is by history and tradition connected with the draining of the lake, and the chief town or collection of dwellings in the valley was called &quot;Kashyapa-pura&quot;, which has been identified with &quot;Kaspapyros&quot; of Hecataeus (&quot;apud&quot; Stephanus of Byzantium) and &quot;Kaspatyros&quot; of Herodotus (3.102, 4.44). Kashmir is also believed to be the country meant by Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Kaspeiria&quot;. Cashmere is an archaic spelling of Kashmir, and in some countries it is still spelled this way.

==Historiography==

&quot;Nilamata Purana&quot; (complied c. 500–600 CE) contains accounts of Kashmir&#x27;s early history. However, being a Puranic source, it has been argued that it suffers from a degree of inconsistency and unreliability. Kalhana&#x27;s &quot;Rajatarangini&quot; (River of Kings), all the 8000 Sanskrit verses of which were completed by 1150 CE, chronicles the history of Kashmir&#x27;s dynasties from earlier times to the 12th century. It relies upon traditional sources like &quot;Nilmata Purana&quot;, inscriptions, coins, monuments, and Kalhana&#x27;s personal observations borne out of political experiences of his family. Towards the end of the work mythical explanations give way to rational and critical analyses of dramatic events between 11th and 12th centuries, for which Kalhana is often credited as &quot;India&#x27;s first historian&quot;.

During the reign of Muslim kings in Kashmir, three supplements to &quot;Rajatarangini&quot; were written by Jonaraja (1411–1463 CE), Srivara, and Prajyabhatta and Suka, which end with Akbar&#x27;s conquest of Kashmir in 1586 CE. The text was translated into Persian by Muslim scholars such as Nizam Uddin, Farishta, and Abul Fazl. &quot;Baharistan-i-Shahi&quot; and Haidar Mailk&#x27;s &quot;Tarikh-i-Kashmir&quot; (completed in 1621 CE) are the most important texts on the history of Kashmir during the Sultanate period. Both the texts were written in Persian and used Rajatarangini and Persian histories as their sources.

== Palaeolithic ==
At the Lower-Middle Palaeolithic Galander site near Pampore in the Kashmir Valley, remains of the extinct elephant species &quot;Palaeoloxodon turkmenicus&quot; have been found associated with knapped stone tools produced by archaic humans, with the bones of the elephant suggested to display deliberate fracturing, perhaps produced during the act of butchery. The stone tools exhibit production techniques reminiscent of the Levallois type, and the site is suggested to date to the Middle Pleistocene, around 400-300,000 years ago.

==Early history==

The earliest Neolithic sites in the flood plains of Kashmir Valley are dated to c. 3000 BCE. Most important of these sites are the settlements at Burzahom, which had two Neolithic and one Megalithic phases. First phase (c. 2920 BCE) at Burzahom is marked by mud plastered pit dwellings, coarse pottery and stone tools. In the second phase, which lasted until c. 1700 BCE, houses were constructed on ground level and the dead were buried, sometimes with domesticated and wild animals. Hunting and fishing were the primary modes of subsistence though evidence of cultivation of wheat, barley, and lentils has also been found in both the phases. In the megalithic phase, massive circles were constructed and grey or black burnish replaced coarse red ware in pottery. During the later Vedic period, as kingdoms of the Vedic tribes expanded, the Uttara–Kurus settled in Kashmir.

In 326 BCE, Porus asked Abisares, the king of Kashmir, to aid him against Alexander the Great in the Battle of Hydaspes. After Porus lost the battle, Abhisares submitted to Alexander by sending him treasure and elephants.

During the reign of Ashoka (304–232 BCE), Kashmir became a part of the Maurya Empire and Buddhism was introduced in Kashmir. During this period, many stupas, some shrines dedicated to Shiva, and the city of Srinagari (Srinagar) were built. Kanishka (127–151 CE), an emperor of the Kushan dynasty, conquered Kashmir and established the new city of Kanishkapur. Buddhist tradition holds that Kanishka held the Fourth Buddhist council in Kashmir, in which celebrated scholars such as Ashvagosha, Nagarjuna and Vasumitra took part. By the fourth century, Kashmir became a seat of learning for both Buddhism and Hinduism. Kashmiri Buddhist missionaries helped spread Buddhism to Tibet and China and from the fifth century CE, pilgrims from these countries started visiting Kashmir. Kumārajīva (343–413 CE) was among the renowned Kashmiri scholars who traveled to China. He influenced the Chinese emperor Yao Xing and spearheaded translation of many Sanskrit works into Chinese at the Chang&#x27;an monastery.
The Alchon Huns under Toramana crossed over the Hindu Kush mountains and conquered large parts of western India including Kashmir. His son Mihirakula (c. 502–530 CE) led a military campaign to conquer all of North India. He was opposed by Baladitya in Magadha and eventually defeated by Yasodharman in Malwa. After the defeat, Mihirakula returned to Kashmir where he led a coup on the king. He then conquered of Gandhara where he committed many atrocities on Buddhists and destroyed their shrines. Influence of the Huns faded after Mihirakula&#x27;s death.

In 659, Sogdia, Ferghana, Tashkent, Bukhara, Samarkand, Balkh, Herat, Kashmir, the Pamirs, Tokharistan, and Kabul all submitted to the protectorate under Emperor Gaozong of Tang.
===Hindu Dynasties===
A succession of Hindu dynasties ruled over the region from the 7th-14th centuries. After the seventh century, significant developments took place in Kashmiri Hinduism. In the centuries that followed, Kashmir produced many poets, philosophers, and artists who contributed to Sanskrit literature and Hindu religion. Among notable scholars of this period was Vasugupta (c. 875–925 CE) who wrote the &quot;Shiva Sutras&quot; which laid the foundation for a monistic Shaiva system called Kashmir Shaivism. Dualistic interpretation of Shaiva scripture was defeated by Abhinavagupta (c. 975–1025 CE) who wrote many philosophical works on Kashmir Shaivism. Kashmir Shaivism was adopted by the common masses of Kashmir and strongly influenced Shaivism in Southern India.
In the eighth century, the Karkota Empire established themselves as rulers of Kashmir. Kashmir grew as an imperial power under the Karkotas. Chandrapida of this dynasty was recognized by an imperial order of the Chinese emperor as the king of Kashmir. His successor Lalitaditya Muktapida lead a successful military campaign against the Tibetans. He then defeated Yashovarman of Kanyakubja and subsequently conquered eastern kingdoms of Magadha, Kamarupa, Gauda, and Kalinga. Lalitaditya extended his influence of Malwa and Gujarat and defeated Arabs at Sindh. After his demise, Kashmir&#x27;s influence over other kingdoms declined and the dynasty ended in c. 855–856 CE.

The Utpala dynasty founded by Avantivarman followed the Karkotas. His successor Shankaravarman (885–902 CE) led a successful military campaign against Gurjaras in Punjab. Political instability in the 10th century made the royal body guards (Tantrins) very powerful in Kashmir. Under the Tantrins, civil administration collapsed and chaos reigned in Kashmir until they were defeated by Chakravarman. Queen Didda, who descended from the Hindu Shahis of Udabhandapura on her mother&#x27;s side, took over as the ruler in second half of the 10th century. After her death in 1003 CE, the throne passed to the Lohara dynasty. Suhadeva, last king of the Lohara dynasty, fled Kashmir after Zulju (Dulacha), a Turkic–Mongol chief, led a savage raid on Kashmir. His wife, Queen Kota Rani ruled until 1339. She is often credited for the construction of a canal, named &quot;Kutte Kol&quot; after her, diverting the waters of the Jhelum to prevent frequent flooding in Srinagar.

During the 11th century, Mahmud of Ghazni made two attempts to conquer Kashmir. However, both his campaigns failed because he could not take by siege the fortress at Lohkot.

== Muslim rulers ==


=== Prelude and Kashmir Sultanate (1346–1580s) ===
Historian Mohibbul Hasan states that the oppressive taxation, corruption, internecine fights and rise of feudal lords (&quot;Damaras&quot;) during the unpopular rule of the Lohara dynasty (1003–1320 CE) paved the way for foreign invasions of Kashmir. Rinchana was a Tibetan Buddhist refugee in Kashmir, who had established himself as the ruler after Zulju. Rinchana&#x27;s conversion to Islam is a subject of Kashmiri folklore. He was persuaded to accept Islam by his minister Shah Mir, probably for political reasons. Islam had penetrated into countries outside Kashmir and in absence of the support from Hindus, who were in a majority, Rinchana needed the support of the Kashmiri Muslims. Shah Mir&#x27;s coup on Rinchana&#x27;s successor secured Muslim rule and the rule of his dynasty in Kashmir.

In the 14th century, Islam gradually became the dominant religion in Kashmir. With the fall of Kashmir, a premier center of Sanskrit literary creativity, Sanskrit literature there disappeared. Islamic preacher Sheikh Nooruddin Noorani, who is traditionally revered by Hindus as Nund Rishi, combined elements of Kashmir Shaivism with Sufi mysticism in his discourses. The Sultans between 1354 and 1470 CE were tolerant of other religions with the exception of Sultan Sikandar (1389–1413 CE). Sultan Sikandar imposed taxes on non–Muslims, forced conversions to Islam, and earned the title &quot;But–Shikan&quot; for destroying idols. Sultan Zain-ul-Abidin (c. 1420–1470 CE) invited artists and craftsmen from Central Asia and Persia to train local artists in Kashmir. Under his rule the arts of wood carving, papier-mâché, shawls and carpets weaving prospered. For a brief period in the 1470s, states of Jammu, Poonch and Rajauri which paid tributes to Kashmir revolted against the Sultan Hajji Khan. However, they were subjugated by his son Hasan Khan who took over as ruler in 1472 CE. By the mid 16th century, Hindu influence in the courts and role of the Hindu priests had declined as Muslim missionaries immigrated into Kashmir from Central Asia and Persia, and Persian replaced Sanskrit as the official language. Around the same period, the nobility of Chaks had become powerful enough to unseat the Shah Mir dynasty.

Mughal general Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlat, a member of ruling family in Kashgar, invaded Kashmir in c. 1540 CE on behalf of emperor Humayun. Persecution of Shias, Shafi&#x27;is and Sufis and instigation by Suri kings led to a revolt which overthrew Dughlat&#x27;s rule in Kashmir.

=== Mughals (1580s–1750s) ===
Kashmir did not witness direct Mughal rule until the reign of Mughal emperor Akbar the Great, who took control of Kashmir and added it to his Kabul Subah in 1586. Shah Jahan carved it out as a separate subah (imperial top-level province), with seat at Srinagar. During successive Mughal emperors many celebrated gardens, mosques and palaces were constructed. Religious intolerance and discriminatory taxation reappeared when Mughal emperor Aurangzeb ascended to the throne in 1658 CE. After his death, the influence of the Mughal Empire declined.
In 1700 CE, a servant of a wealthy Kashmir merchant brought &quot;Mo-i Muqqadas&quot; (the hair of the Prophet), a relic of Muhammad, to the valley. The relic was housed in the Hazratbal Shrine on the banks of Dal Lake. Nadir Shah&#x27;s invasion of India in 1738 CE further weakened Mughal control over Kashmir.

=== Durrani Empire (1752–1819) ===
Taking advantage of the declining Mughal Empire, the Afghan Durrani Empire under Ahmad Shah Durrani took control of Kashmir in 1752. In the mid-1750s the Afghan-appointed governor of Kashmir, Sukh Jiwan Mal, rebelled against the Durrani Empire before being defeated in 1762. After Mal&#x27;s defeat, the Durrani engaged in the oppression of the remaining Hindu population through forced conversions, killings, and forced labor. Repression by the Durrani extended to all classes, regardless of religion, and a heavy tax burden was levied on the Kashmiri populace.

A number of Afghan governors administered the region on behalf of the Durrani Empire. During the Durrani rule in Kashmir, income from the region constituted a large part of the Durrani Empire&#x27;s revenue. The empire controlled Kashmir until 1819, after which the region was annexed by the Sikh Empire.

== Sikh rule (1820–1846) ==



After four centuries of Muslim rule, Kashmir fell to the conquering armies of the Sikhs under Ranjit Singh of Punjab after the Battle of Shopian in 1819. As the Kashmiris had suffered under the Afghans, they initially welcomed the new Sikh rulers. However, the Sikh governors turned out to be hard taskmasters, and Sikh rule was generally considered oppressive, protected perhaps by the remoteness of Kashmir from the capital of the Sikh Empire in Lahore. The Sikhs enacted a number of anti-Muslim laws, which included handing out death sentences for cow slaughter, closing down the Jamia Masjid in Srinagar, and banning the &quot;azaan&quot;, the public Muslim call to prayer. Kashmir had also now begun to attract European visitors, several of whom wrote of the abject poverty of the vast Muslim peasantry and of the exorbitant taxes under the Sikhs. High taxes, according to some contemporary accounts, had depopulated large tracts of the countryside, allowing only one-sixteenth of the cultivable land to be cultivated. However, after a famine in 1832, the Sikhs reduced the land tax to half the produce of the land and also began to offer interest-free loans to farmers; Kashmir became the second highest revenue earner for the Sikh empire. During this time Kashmiri shawls became known worldwide, attracting many buyers especially in the west.

Earlier, in 1780, after the death of Ranjit Deo, the kingdom of Jammu (to the south of the Kashmir valley) was also captured by the Sikhs and made a tributary. Ranjit Deo&#x27;s grandnephew, Gulab Singh, subsequently sought service at the court of Ranjit Singh, distinguished himself in later campaigns and got appointed as the Raja of Jammu in 1820. With the help of his officer, Zorawar Singh, Gulab Singh soon captured for the Sikhs the lands of Ladakh and Baltistan.

== Princely State of Kashmir and Jammu (Dogra Rule, 1846–1947) ==

In 1845, the First Anglo-Sikh War broke out, and Gulab Singh &quot;contrived to hold himself aloof until the battle of Sobraon (1846), when he appeared as a useful mediator and the trusted advisor of Sir Henry Lawrence. Two treaties were concluded. By the first the State of Lahore (&quot;i.e.&quot; West Punjab) handed over to the British, as equivalent for (rupees) ten million of indemnity, the hill countries between Beas and Indus; by the second the British made over to Gulab Singh for (Rupees) 7.5 million all the hilly or mountainous country situated to the east of Indus and west of Ravi&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot; the Vale of Kashmir). The Treaty of Amritsar freed Gulab Singh from obligations towards the Sikhs and made him the Maharajah of Jammu and Kashmir. The Dogras&#x27; loyalty came in handy to the British during the revolt of 1857 which challenged British rule in India. Dogras refused to provide sanctuary to mutineers, allowed English women and children to seek asylum in Kashmir and sent Kashmiri troops to fight on behalf of the British. British in return rewarded them by securing the succession of Dogra rule in Kashmir. Soon after Gulab Singh&#x27;s death in 1857, his son, Ranbir Singh, added the emirates of Hunza, Gilgit and Nagar to the kingdom.
The &quot;Princely State of Kashmir and Jammu&quot; (as it was then called) was constituted between 1820 and 1858 and was &quot;somewhat artificial in composition and it did not develop a fully coherent identity, partly as a result of its disparate origins and partly as a result of the autocratic rule which it experienced on the fringes of Empire.&quot; It combined disparate regions, religions, and ethnicities: to the east, Ladakh was ethnically and culturally Tibetan and its inhabitants practised Buddhism; to the south, Jammu had a mixed population of Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs; in the heavily populated central Kashmir valley, the population was overwhelmingly &quot;Sunni&quot; Muslim, however, there was also a small but influential Hindu minority, the Kashmiri brahmins or pandits; to the northeast, sparsely populated Baltistan had a population ethnically related to Ladakh, but which practised &quot;Shi&#x27;a&quot; Islam; to the north, also sparsely populated, Gilgit Agency, was an area of diverse, mostly &quot;Shi&#x27;a&quot; groups; and, to the west, Punch was Muslim, but of different ethnicity than the Kashmir valley.

Despite being in a majority the Muslims were made to suffer severe oppression under Hindu rule in the form of high taxes, unpaid forced labor and discriminatory laws. Many Kashmiri Muslims migrated from the Valley to Punjab due to famine and policies of Dogra rulers. The Muslim peasantry was vast, impoverished and ruled by a Hindu elite.  The Muslim peasants lacked education, awareness of rights and were chronically in debt to landlords and moneylenders, and did not organize politically until the 1930s.

==1947==

Ranbir Singh&#x27;s grandson Hari Singh, who had ascended the throne of Kashmir in 1925, was the reigning monarch in 1947 at the conclusion of British rule of the subcontinent and the subsequent partition of the British Indian Empire into the newly independent Dominion of India and Dominion of Pakistan. An internal revolt began in the Poonch region against oppressive taxation by the Maharaja. In August, Maharaja&#x27;s forces fired upon demonstrations in favour of Kashmir joining Pakistan, burned whole villages and massacred innocent people. The Poonch rebels declared an independent government of &quot;Azad&quot; Kashmir on 24 October. Rulers of Princely States were encouraged to accede their States to either Dominion – India or Pakistan, taking into account factors such as geographical contiguity and the wishes of their people. In 1947, Jammu and Kashmir&#x27;s population was &quot;77% Muslim and 20% Hindu&quot;. To postpone making a hurried decision, the Maharaja signed a standstill agreement with Pakistan, which ensured continuity of trade, travel, communication, and similar services between the two. Such an agreement was pending with India. Following huge riots in Jammu, in October 1947, Pashtuns from Pakistan&#x27;s North-West Frontier Province recruited by the Poonch rebels, invaded Kashmir, along with the Poonch rebels, allegedly incensed by the atrocities against fellow Muslims in Poonch and Jammu. The tribesmen engaged in looting and killing along the way. The ostensible aim of the guerilla campaign was to frighten Hari Singh into submission. Instead the Maharaja appealed to the Government of India for assistance, and the Governor-General Lord Mountbatten agreed on the condition that the ruler accede to India. Once the Maharaja signed the Instrument of Accession, Indian soldiers entered Kashmir and drove the Pakistani-sponsored irregulars from all but a small section of the state. India accepted the accession, regarding it provisional until such time as the will of the people can be ascertained. Kashmir leader Sheikh Abdullah endorsed the accession as ad hoc which would be ultimately decided by the people of the State. He was appointed the head of the emergency administration by the Maharaja. The Pakistani government immediately contested the accession, suggesting that it was fraudulent, that the Maharaja acted under duress and that he had no right to sign an agreement with India when the standstill agreement with Pakistan was still in force.

==Post-1947==
In early 1948, India sought a resolution of the Kashmir conflict at the United Nations. Following the set-up of the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan (UNCIP), the UN Security Council passed Resolution 47 on 21April 1948. The UN mission insisted that the opinion of people of J&amp;K must be ascertained. The then Indian Prime Minister is reported to have himself urged U.N. to poll Kashmir and on the basis of results Kashmir&#x27;s accession will be decided. However, India insisted that no referendum could occur until all of the state had been cleared of irregulars.

On 5 January 1949, UNCIP (United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan) resolution stated that the question of the accession of the State of Jammu and Kashmir to India or Pakistan will be decided through a free and impartial plebiscite. As per the 1948 and 1949 UNCIP Resolutions, both countries accepted the principle, that Pakistan secures the withdrawal of Pakistani intruders followed by withdrawal of Pakistani and Indian forces, as a basis for the formulation of a Truce agreement whose details are to be arrived in future, followed by a plebiscite; However, both countries failed to arrive at a Truce agreement due to differences in interpretation of the procedure for and extent of demilitarisation one of them being whether the Azad Kashmiri army of Pakistan is to be disbanded during the truce stage or the plebiscite stage.
In the last days of 1948, a ceasefire was agreed under UN auspices; however, since the plebiscite demanded by the UN was never conducted, relations between India and Pakistan soured, and eventually led to three more wars over Kashmir in 1965, 1971 and 1999. India has control of about half the area of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir; Pakistan controls a third of the region, governing it as Gilgit–Baltistan and Azad Kashmir. According to Encyclopædia Britannica, &quot;Although there was a clear Muslim majority in Kashmir before the 1947 partition and its economic, cultural, and geographic contiguity with the Muslim-majority area of the Punjab (in Pakistan) could be convincingly demonstrated, the political developments during and after the partition resulted in a division of the region. Pakistan was left with territory that, although basically Muslim in character, was thinly populated, relatively inaccessible, and economically underdeveloped. The largest Muslim group, situated in the Valley of Kashmir and estimated to number more than half the population of the entire region, lay in Indian-administered territory, with its former outlets via the Jhelum valley route blocked.&quot;

The UN Security Council on 20 January 1948 passed Resolution 39 establishing a special commission to investigate the conflict. Subsequent to the commission&#x27;s recommendation the Security Council, ordered in its Resolution 47, passed on 21 April 1948 that the invading Pakistani army retreat from Jammu &amp; Kashmir and that the accession of Kashmir to either India or Pakistan be determined in accordance with a plebiscite to be supervised by the UN. In a string of subsequent resolutions the Security Council took notice of the continuing failure by India to hold the plebiscite. However, no punitive action against India could be taken by the Security Council because its resolution, requiring India to hold a Plebiscite, was non-binding. Moreover, the Pakistani army never left the part of the Kashmir, they managed to keep occupied at the end of the 1947 war. They were required by the Security Council resolution 47 to remove all armed personnels from the Azad Kashmir before holding the plebiscite.
The eastern region of the erstwhile princely state of Kashmir has also been beset with a boundary dispute. In the late 19th- and early 20th centuries, although some boundary agreements were signed between Great Britain, Afghanistan and Russia over the northern borders of Kashmir, China never accepted these agreements, and the official Chinese position did not change with the communist revolution in 1949. By the mid-1950s the Chinese army had entered the north-east portion of Ladakh.: &quot;By 1956–57 they had completed a military road through the Aksai Chin area to provide better communication between Xinjiang and western Tibet. India&#x27;s belated discovery of this road led to border clashes between the two countries that culminated in the Sino-Indian war of October 1962.&quot; China has occupied Aksai Chin since 1962 and, in addition, an adjoining region, the Trans-Karakoram Tract was ceded by Pakistan to China in 1965.

In 1949, the Indian government obliged Hari Singh to leave Jammu and Kashmir and yield the government to Sheikh Abdullah, the leader of a popular political party, the National Conference Party. Since then, a bitter enmity has been developed between India and Pakistan and three wars have taken place between them over Kashmir. The growing dispute over Kashmir and the consistent failure of democracy also led to the rise of Kashmir nationalism and militancy in the state.

In 1986, the Anantnag riots broke out after the CM Gul Shah ordered the construction of a mosque at the site of a Hindu Temple in Jammu and Gul Shah made an incendiary speech. Hindu-Muslim riots (a reaction to the opening of Babri Masjid to Hindu worshippers) were a national event, taking place in seven other states as well. Following the 1987 Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly election that were widely perceived to have been rigged, disgruntled Kashmiri youth such as the so-called &#x27;HAJY group&#x27; – Abdul Hamid Shaikh, Ashfaq Majid Wani, Javed Ahmed Mir and Mohammed Yasin Malik – joined the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front(JKLF) as an alternative to the ineffective democratic setup that was prevalent in Kashmir. This led to gain in the momentum of the popular insurgency in the Kashmir Valley. The year 1989 saw the intensification of conflict in Jammu and Kashmir as Mujahadeens from Afghanistan slowly infiltrated the region following the end of the Soviet–Afghan War the same year. Pakistan provided arms and training to both indigenous and foreign militants in Kashmir, thus adding fuel to the smouldering fire of discontent in the valley.

In August 2019, the Government of India repealed the special status accorded to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Indian constitution in 2019, and the Parliament of India passed the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, which contained provisions to dissolve the state and reorganise it into two union territories – Jammu and Kashmir in the west and Ladakh in the east. These changes came into effect from 31 October 2019.

==Historical demographics of Kashmir==

In the 1901 Census of the British Indian Empire, the population of the princely state of Kashmir was 2,905,578. Of these 2,154,695 were Muslims, 689,073 Hindus, 25,828 Sikhs, and 35,047 Buddhists. The Hindus were found mainly in Jammu, where they constituted a little less than 50% of the population. In the Kashmir Valley, the Hindus represented &quot;only 524 in every 10,000 of the population (&quot;i.e.&quot; 5.24%), and in the frontier &quot;wazarats&quot; of Ladhakh and Gilgit only 94 out of every 10,000 persons (0.94%).&quot; In the same Census of 1901, in the Kashmir Valley, the total population was recorded to be 1,157,394, of which the Muslim population was 1,083,766, or 93.6% of the population. These percentages have remained fairly stable for the last 100 years. In the 1941 Census of British India, Muslims accounted for 93.6% of the population of the Kashmir Valley and the Hindus constituted 4%. In 2003, the percentage of Muslims in the Kashmir Valley was 95% and those of Hindus 4%; the same year, in Jammu, the percentage of Hindus was 67% and those of Muslims 27%.

Among the Muslims of the &quot;Kashmir province&quot; within the princely state, four divisions were recorded: &quot;Shaikhs, Saiyids, Mughals, and Pathans. The Shaikhs, who are by far the most numerous, are the descendants of Hindus, but have retained none of the caste rules of their forefathers. They have clan names known as &quot;krams&quot; ...&quot; It was recorded that these &quot;kram&quot; names included &quot;Tantre&quot;, &quot;Shaikh&quot;, &quot;Bat&quot;, &quot;Mantu&quot;, &quot;Ganai&quot;, &quot;Dar&quot;, &quot;Damar&quot;, &quot;Lon&quot;, etc. The Saiyids, it was recorded, &quot;could be divided into those who follow the profession of religion and those who have taken to agriculture and other pursuits. Their &quot;kram&quot; name is &#x27;Mir.&#x27; While a Saiyid retains his saintly profession Mir is a prefix; if he has taken to agriculture, Mir is an affix to his name.&quot; The &quot;Mughals&quot; who were not numerous were recorded to have &quot;kram&quot; names like &quot;Mir&quot; (a corruption of &quot;Mirza&quot;), &quot;Beg&quot;, &quot;Bandi&quot;, &quot;Bach&quot; and &quot;Ashaye&quot;. Finally, it was recorded that the Pathans &quot;who are more numerous than the Mughals, ... are found chiefly in the south-west of the valley, where Pathan colonies have from time to time been founded. The most interesting of these colonies is that of Kuki-Khel Afridis at Dranghaihama, who retain all the old customs and speak Pashtu.&quot; Among the main tribes of Muslims in the princely state are the Butts, Dar, Lone, Jat, Gujjar, Rajput, Sudhan and Khatri. A small number of Butts, Dar and Lone use the title Khawaja and the Khatri use the title Shaikh the Gujjar use the title of Chaudhary. All these tribes are indigenous of the princely state which converted to Islam from Hinduism during its arrival in region.

Among the Hindus of &quot;Jammu&quot; province, who numbered 626,177 (or 90.87% of the Hindu population of the princely state), the most important castes recorded in the census were &quot;Brahmans (186,000), the Rajputs (167,000), the Khattris (48,000) and the Thakkars (93,000).&quot;

<text>Nikāya () is a Pāli word meaning &quot;volume&quot;. It is often used like the Sanskrit word &quot;āgama&quot; () to mean &quot;collection&quot;, &quot;assemblage&quot;, &quot;class&quot; or &quot;group&quot; in both Pāḷi and Sanskrit. It is most commonly used in reference to the Pali Buddhist texts of the Tripitaka namely those found in the Sutta Piṭaka. It is also used to refer to monastic lineages, where it is sometimes translated as a &#x27;monastic fraternity&#x27;.

The term &quot;Nikāya&quot; Buddhism is sometimes used in contemporary scholarship to refer to the Buddhism of the early Buddhist schools.

==Text collections==

In the Pāli Canon, particularly, the &quot;Discourse Basket&quot; or &quot;Sutta Piṭaka&quot;, the meaning of &quot;nikāya&quot; is roughly equivalent to the English &quot;collection&quot; and is used to describe groupings of discourses according to theme, length, or other categories. For example, the &quot;Sutta Piṭaka&quot; is broken up into five nikāyas:
* the Dīgha Nikāya, the collection of long (Pāḷi: &quot;dīgha&quot;) discourses
* the Majjhima Nikāya, the collection of middle-length (&quot;majjhima&quot;) discourses
* the Samyutta Nikāya, the collection of thematically linked (&quot;samyutta&quot;) discourses
* the Anguttara Nikāya, the &quot;gradual collection&quot; (discourses grouped by content enumerations)
* the Khuddaka Nikāya, the &quot;minor collection&quot;

In the other early Buddhist schools the alternate term &quot;āgama&quot; was used instead of nikāya to describe their &quot;Sutra Piṭaka&quot;s. Thus the non-Mahāyāna portion of the Sanskrit-language &quot;Sutra Piṭaka&quot; is referred to as &quot;the Āgamas&quot; by Mahāyāna Buddhists. The Āgamas survive for the most part only in Classical Tibetan and Chinese translation. They correspond closely with the Pāḷi nikāyas.

==Monastic divisions==

Among the Theravāda nations of Southeast Asia and Sri Lanka, &quot;nikāya&quot; is also used as the term for a monastic division or lineage; these groupings are also sometimes called &quot;monastic fraternities&quot; or &quot;frateries&quot;. Nikāyas may emerge among monastic groupings as a result of royal or government patronage (such as the Dhammayuttika Nikāya of Thailand), due to the national origin of their ordination lineage (the Siam Nikāya of Sri Lanka), because of differences in the interpretation of the monastic code, or due to other factors (such as the Amarapura Nikāya in Sri Lanka, which emerged as a reaction to caste restrictions within the Siam Nikāya). These divisions do not rise to the level of forming separate sects within the Theravāda tradition, because they do not typically follow different doctrines or monastic codes, nor do these divisions extend to the laity.

In Burma, nikaya monastic orders have emerged in response to the relative conservativeness with which the Vinayas are interpreted, and the hierarchical structure within the nikaya. Since 1980, no new nikayas have been allowed, and there are a total of nine legally recognized monastic orders in Burma today under the 1990 Law Concerning Sangha Organizations. The largest of these is the Thudhamma Nikaya, which was founded in the 1800s during the Konbaung dynasty.

== Nikaya Buddhism ==

The term Nikāya Buddhism was coined by Masatoshi Nagatomifake as a non-derogatory substitute for Hinayana, meaning the early Buddhist schools. Examples of these groups are pre-sectarian Buddhism and the early Buddhist schools. Some scholars exclude pre-sectarian Buddhism when using the term. The term Theravada refers to Buddhist practices based on these early teachings, as preserved in the Pāli Canon.

<doc id="399060" wikidata="Q817605" url="?curid=399060" title="Benjamin Lincoln">
<text>Benjamin Lincoln (January 24, 1733 (O.S. January 13, 1733) – May 9, 1810) was an American army officer. He served as a major general in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. Lincoln was involved in three major surrenders during the war: his participation in the Battles of Saratoga (sustaining a wound shortly afterward) contributed to John Burgoyne&#x27;s surrender of a British army, he oversaw the largest American surrender of the war at the 1780 siege of Charleston, and, as George Washington&#x27;s second in command, he formally accepted the British surrender at Yorktown.

Lincoln served from 1781 to 1783 as the first United States Secretary of War. While Secretary of War, Lincoln became an original member of The Society of the Cincinnati of the state of Massachusetts and was elected as the first president of the Massachusetts Society on June 9, 1783. After the war, Lincoln was active in politics in his native Massachusetts, running several times for lieutenant governor but only winning one term in that office. In 1787, Lincoln led a militia army (privately funded by Massachusetts merchants) in the suppression of Shays&#x27; Rebellion, and was a strong supporter of the new United States Constitution. He was for many of his later years the politically influential customs collector of the Port of Boston. He was the fourth cousin three times removed of Abraham Lincoln through his mother&#x27;s side.

==Early life==
Benjamin Lincoln was born on January 24, 1733, in Hingham, Province of Massachusetts Bay, the sixth child and first son of Colonel Benjamin Lincoln and his second wife Elizabeth Thaxter Lincoln. Lincoln&#x27;s ancestors were among those who first settled in Hingham, beginning with Thomas Lincoln &#x27;the cooper,&#x27; who was among several Lincolns who settled in Hingham when it was part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Lincoln&#x27;s father, one of the wealthiest men in Suffolk County, served as a member of the governor&#x27;s council from 1753 until 1770, and occupied many other civic posts before his death in 1771. Lincoln&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Col. Samuel Thaxter, one of the most prominent and influential citizens in Hingham, became Colonel in a regiment and one of those commissioned to settle the boundary between Massachusetts and Rhode Island in 1719.

In his early life, Lincoln worked on the family farm, and attended the local school. He followed his father into government, becoming town constable at 21, and in 1755 he joined the 3rd Regiment of the Suffolk County militia (where his father was colonel) as an adjutant. In 1756, at the age of 23, Lincoln married Mary Cushing, daughter of Elijah Cushing of Pembroke, Massachusetts, whose ancestors were also among the founders of Hingham. They had eleven children, seven of whom survived to adulthood. In 1757, he was elected the town clerk of Hingham, a post he held for twenty years. He continued to be active in the militia during the French and Indian War, but saw no action, and was promoted to major by the end of the conflict in 1763.

Lincoln was elected a Hingham town selectman in 1765, a post to which he held for six years. During this tenure political opposition rose in the province to Parliamentary tax measures, polarizing the political landscape of the colony. Lincoln sided with the opposition, eventually becoming a leading force among Hingham&#x27;s Patriots. In 1770, in a list of resolutions passed by the inhabitants of Hingham, Lincoln outlined the measures urged by residents towards the non-importation of British goods, and he condemned the Boston Massacre. In 1772, Lincoln was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the 3rd Regiment of the Suffolk militia. That same year he won election as a representative of the town to the provincial assembly.

==American Revolution==
With the arrival of General Thomas Gage as governor of the colony in 1774, the provincial assembly was dissolved, but reformed itself into the Massachusetts Provincial Congress. Lincoln continued to win election to this body, and was placed on committees overseeing militia organization and supply, a position that came to be of utmost importance when the American Revolutionary War broke out with the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775. He was then appointed to the congress&#x27; committee of safety, and also was elected to its executive council, which exercised executive authority over the province outside besieged Boston. He was deeply involved in ensuring that supplies of all sorts reached the nascent Continental Army outside Boston, procuring supplies from blankets to gunpowder.

===Defense of New York===
In January 1776, Lincoln was promoted to major general of the Massachusetts militia, overseeing the coastal defenses of the state. After the British evacuated Boston, he and Continental Army General Artemas Ward oversaw attempts to improve the state&#x27;s coastal fortifications, and he was ordered to hold the state&#x27;s militia brigades in readiness in case the British returned. In May 1776 he directed the state forces that successfully drove the last Royal Navy ships from Boston Harbor.

Despite his lack of combat experience, Lincoln began lobbying state representatives to the Continental Congress for a Continental Army officers commission, anticipating that the aging and ill General Ward might soon step down. The idea was generally well received, with one representative writing that Lincoln was &quot;a good man for a Brigadier General&quot; and &quot;a man of abilities&quot;, even though he had not &quot;had much experience&quot;. While a Continental commission was not immediately forthcoming, Lincoln was placed in command of a brigade of militia the state sent to join General George Washington at New York Town in September 1776.

When Lincoln reached southwestern Connecticut, Washington first ordered him to prepare an expedition across Long Island Sound to raid British positions on Long Island. The expedition was aborted when Washington began to retreat from New York after the Battle of Long Island (Brooklyn) in August 1776, and Lincoln was ordered to bring two regiments to join Washington&#x27;s army as it later retreated northward from New York Town. Lincoln&#x27;s troops secured the Continental retreat to White Plains, New York, and were in the main Continental formation during the subsequent Battle of White Plains in October 1776; this portion of the troops saw no action in the battle. The enlistment terms of his men expiring, Lincoln returned briefly to Massachusetts to take command of new recruits for the coming year&#x27;s campaigns. Based on a recommendation from General Washington as &quot;a gentleman well worthy of notice in the Military Line&quot;, Congress commissioned Lincoln a major general in the Continental Army on February 14, 1777.

Lincoln&#x27;s first command was that of a forward outpost at Bound Brook, New Jersey, only from British sentries outside New Brunswick. He established his headquarters at the nearby Van Horne House. After months of skirmishing, his post was the target of a surprise attack on April 13, 1777. In the Battle of Bound Brook he was defeated by a much larger force under the command of Lord Cornwallis, barely escaping capture.

===Saratoga===
In July 1777, Washington dispatched three of his best officers, Colonel Morgan, General Arnold and General Lincoln north to assist Philip Schuyler, and afterward Schuyler&#x27;s replacement Horatio Gates, in the defense of upstate New York against the advance of General John Burgoyne&#x27;s expedition from Quebec. Lincoln was ordered to coordinate the activities of the New England militia being recruited for the effort. General Schuyler asked Lincoln, from a base in southern Vermont, to harass the British supply line as the British moved south from Fort Ticonderoga toward Albany. Lincoln&#x27;s job was complicated by New Hampshire&#x27;s militia leader John Stark, who categorically refused to put his forces under Lincoln&#x27;s command. Stark had previously held a Continental commission and resigned over a promotion snub, and had only agreed to serve in his native New Hampshire if he was not under Continental authority. Stark led his forces to victory in the Battle of Bennington in mid-August, which led to the capture or deaths of 1,000 Hessian soldiers from Burgoyne&#x27;s army, while Lincoln&#x27;s force was still growing.

By early September Lincoln had 2,000 men under his command, and launched several detachments at the British supply line. One of those detachments, led by Colonel John Brown, successfully harassed British positions outside Fort Ticonderoga, freeing American prisoners and even making an unsuccessful attempt to capture the fort in late September. By this time General Gates, who had taken command from Schuyler in August, had ordered Lincoln&#x27;s force to join him near Stillwater, New York. Lincoln arrived on September 22, three days after the strategically conclusive Battle of Freeman&#x27;s Farm where Colonel Morgan&#x27;s sharpshooters killed most of the officers and three quarters of the artillerymen, resulting in the capture of 6 of the 10 British cannons. There Lincoln&#x27;s militia were to hold the eastern shore of the Hudson River.

Lincoln&#x27;s militia played no role in the American victory at the October 7 Battle of Bemis Heights, since the action took place on the western side of the river, but Lincoln was in command of the American right in the battle. These forces saw little action, which was concentrated on the American left. American forces, led by Generals Benedict Arnold and Enoch Poor, successfully breached the British defenses, undoing the small gains the British had made at Freeman&#x27;s Farm and compelling Burgoyne to retreat a short distance. That evening Gates ordered Lincoln to perform reconnaissance; the British left fell back as Lincoln and his 1,500 man force probed them, and Lincoln was able to occupy the former British lines. In council that evening Lincoln recommended that the ford at Fort Edward be fortified against the possibility that Burgoyne would attempt to reach it and cross the river in an attempt to return to Ticonderoga. Gates agreed with the plan, and ordered Lincoln&#x27;s militia to do so. During these movements Lincoln encountered a British company; in the ensuing skirmish Lincoln&#x27;s right ankle was shattered by a musket ball, much like General Arnold was hit in the leg during his charge during the Battle of Bemis Heights, even though General Gates had already relieved Arnold of command due to insubordination in Arnold&#x27;s manner of disagreement with Gates&#x27; battle plans.

Lincoln was transported to Albany, where he was treated, and where he learned of Burgoyne&#x27;s October 17 surrender. His son helped him return to Hingham in February 1778, where he convalesced for several months. The injury left his right leg two inches shorter than the left, and for many years the ankle wound was prone to reopening and the danger of infection. During his recovery Lincoln learned that General Arnold&#x27;s seniority had been restored, reducing Lincoln to the lowest-ranked major general. Although he considered resignation over the slight, Washington and supporters in the Continental Congress assured him of his value to the army.

===Southern theater (1778–1781)===

Lincoln rejoined Washington outside New York in August 1778, and was appointed commander of the Southern department in September. Washington sent Lincoln, Lafayette and Lee (Henry &quot;Light Horse Harry&quot;) to the Southern Department to oppose the British army under Clinton and Cornwallis. Lincoln participated in the unsuccessful French-led siege of Savannah, Georgia in October 1779, after which he retreated to Charleston, South Carolina. He took command of the garrison of Charleston. In March 1780, the city was surrounded by a sizable British force dispatched from New York. After a relatively brief siege, Lincoln was forced to surrender more than 5,000 men to Lieutenant General Sir Henry Clinton on May 12, 1780, but did so in a way that allowed the South Carolina militia to escape as well as some Continental forces, that annoyed the British toward Lincoln.

Lincoln, desperate for more troops, had pleaded with the South Carolina legislature to arm 1,000 enslaved African Americans to ward off the approaching British. Rather than see armed slaves, the legislature began negotiations with the British commanders to allow the British forces to pass through South Carolina.

The loss of the southern army at Charleston was one of the worst Continental defeats of the war. He was denied the honors of war in surrendering, due to the British annoyance at his facilitating the escape of South Carolina militia units and some Continental forces, such as those with Lafayette and Lee, which deeply rankled Lincoln. Lincoln was paroled, and in the court of inquiry no charges were ever brought against him.

After being exchanged for the British Major General William Phillips in November 1780, Lincoln returned to Washington&#x27;s main army. He led a large portion of the Army south from Head of Elk Maryland to Hampton, Virginia, to march to the west to Yorktown where the British were encamped. Lincoln played a major role in the siege of Yorktown and the surrender of Lord Cornwallis on October 19, 1781. Cornwallis plead illness, and so did not attend the surrender ceremony, choosing instead to send his second-in-command, the Irish General Charles O&#x27;Hara. General Washington refused to accept Cornwallis&#x27; sword from O&#x27;Hara, directing O&#x27;Hara to present it instead to Lincoln, Washington&#x27;s own second-in-command.

===Secretary at War (1781–1783)===
From 1781 to late 1783, Lincoln served as the first United States Secretary at War. He was appointed by the Confederation Congress under the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, adopted 1781. He was succeeded in the post by Continental Army artillery chief, Major General Henry Knox, (who later continued in the position as the first United States Secretary of War from 1789 to 1795 under the new Federal Constitution of 1787, during George Washington&#x27;s two terms as the first President of the United States). He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1781.

While Secretary at War, Lincoln was admitted as an original member of The Society of the Cincinnati in the state of Massachusetts and was elected as the first president of the Massachusetts Society on June 9, 1783, subsequently supporting the election of George Washington as the first President General of The Society of the Cincinnati on June 19.

==Post-war politics==

In early 1787, Lincoln helped put an end to an uprising of western Massachusetts farmers opposed to increased taxation and government coercion in their trade, known as Shays&#x27; Rebellion; Lincoln commanded 3,000 privately funded militia to disperse the opposition, and captured over one hundred. The uprising with the near-capture of a federal arsenal by rebels caused a national uproar, and it was an important part of the national crisis that justified calling the Constitutional Convention. The next year, as a Suffolk County, Hingham delegate, Lincoln voted to support the United States Constitution at the Massachusetts Federal Convention, which ratified 187 to 168 on February 6, 1788.

On February 4, 1789, Lincoln was one of only 12 men who received electoral votes during the first election for President and Vice President of the United States, receiving the vote of an unrecorded elector from the State of Georgia.

Lincoln also served as one of the first trustees of Derby Academy, founded in Hingham by Sarah Hersey Derby, widow of a wealthy Salem shipping magnate.

He stayed active in public life in various capacities, including a term as Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts and many years as the Collector of the Port of Boston. In 1806, Lincoln attempted to resign as Collector but President Thomas Jefferson requested he stay until he appointed a successor. This act led to Representative Josiah Quincy III to attempt to have Jefferson impeached in January 1809, even though Jefferson was set to leave office in March of that year. He retired from public life in 1809 and died in Hingham on May 9, 1810.

==Legacy==

Lincoln is buried in the Old Ship Burying Ground behind the Old Ship Church in Hingham. Among the pallbearers at Lincoln&#x27;s funeral were John Adams, Cotton Tufts, Robert Treat Paine, Richard Cranch and Thomas Melvill. In Lincoln&#x27;s honor, the bells at Boston and other places were tolled for an hour; the flags of vessels, and those at Fort Independence and Fort Warren, as well as those at the Charlestown Navy Yard were lowered to half-mast.

He was one of the few men to have been involved in the three major surrenders of the American Revolutionary War: twice as a victor (at Yorktown and Saratoga), and once as the defeated party (at Charleston). In spite of the major role he played during the war, he tends to be less well-remembered than many of his contemporaries in the Continental Army.

He was a founding member of The Massachusetts Society for Promoting Agriculture (M.S.P.A.) one of the earliest agricultural societies in the United States. The Society was incorporated by an act of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on March 7, 1792.

While there are a few exceptions, places named &quot;Lincoln&quot; in the American South tend to be named after Benjamin Lincoln rather than Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President. Counties and/or towns in Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, and Tennessee are named in his honor, as are communities in North Carolina (Lincolnton), Georgia (Lincolnton), Vermont (Lincoln), and Maine (Lincolnville). Streets in Columbia, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia (Lincoln Street), bear his name, as does Lincoln Hall at the United States Coast Guard Training Center in Yorktown, Virginia.

Lincoln&#x27;s lifelong home still stands. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1972, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Benjamin Lincoln is believed to have married Mary Cushing.

<doc id="399061" wikidata="Q2071022" url="?curid=399061" title="Room 101 (British TV series)">
<text>Room 101 is a BBC comedy television series based on the radio series of the same name, in which celebrities are invited to discuss their pet hates and persuade the host to consign those hates to oblivion in Room 101, a location whose name was inspired by the torture room in George Orwell&#x27;s 1949 novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; which reputedly contained &quot;the worst thing in the world&quot;. Orwell himself named it after a meeting room in Broadcasting House where he would sit through tedious meetings. It was produced independently for the BBC by Hat Trick Productions.

Nick Hancock hosted the first three series of the show from 1994 until 1997. He was succeeded by Paul Merton, who hosted the show from 1999 till the show&#x27;s original run came to an end in 2007. Frank Skinner hosts the revamped incarnation that started on 20 January 2012.

The 1994–2007 incarnation of the show was that of a one-on-one interview between the host and guest. Consignment of the nominated items, persons or concepts to Room 101 (theoretically banishing them from the world forever) was the decision of the host, sometimes after soliciting the opinion of the studio audience. The 2012 revamp introduced a panel format with three guests competing to have their pet hates consigned to Room 101, a decision made by the host. Guests included Ricky Gervais, Spike Milligan, Stephen Fry, Boris Johnson, Ben Miller and Ian Hislop (the only person to appear twice on the show in its original format). Fry went as far as to put &quot;Room 101&quot; itself into Room 101.

A Dutch version of &quot;Room 101&quot; started on 24 February 2008, but was short-lived. An Israeli version of the show was broadcast between 2010 and 2013. An Australian version of the show hosted by Paul McDermott began in 2015.

==History==
The radio series was originally broadcast on BBC Radio 5 in 1992, where it was hosted by Nick Hancock. Hancock was also the first presenter when the series transferred to television two years later. The first ever guest on the TV version was comedian Bob Monkhouse who cast the French into Room 101.

In 1999, Hancock was replaced as host by Paul Merton (who was also the first ever guest on the original radio version). Merton&#x27;s first guest was Nick Hancock and his last was his fellow regular team captain on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, Ian Hislop. Usually, there were five nominations discussed in each show – represented by several surreal props. The last item usually goes in, sometimes for a forfeit.

Following Merton&#x27;s departure in 2007, it was announced that a replacement would be sought; however, it was not until 2012 that a twelfth series, now fronted by Frank Skinner, was aired.

In July 2018, Skinner announced that, after 24 years, the show had been cancelled by the BBC.

The show returned as a radio series on BBC Radio 4 in summer 2023, in the original single-guest format and with Paul Merton returning as host.
