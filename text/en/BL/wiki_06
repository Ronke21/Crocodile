<text>Benito Juárez (), is a borough (&quot;demarcación territorial&quot;) in Mexico City. It is a largely residential area, located to the south of historic center of Mexico City, although there are pressures for areas to convert to commercial use. It was named after Benito Juárez, president in the 19th century. 

The borough has the highest socioeconomic index in the country as it is primarily populated by the middle and upper middle classes. The borough is home to a number of landmarks such as the World Trade Center Mexico City, the Estadio Azul, the Plaza México and the Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros.

==The borough==
The borough is in the north center of the Mexico City, just south of the oldest section of the city. It borders the boroughs of Miguel Hidalgo, Cuauhtémoc, Coyoacán, Iztapalapa, Iztacalco and Álvaro Obregón. The borders are formed by two rivers, the La Piedad and the Churubusco, as well as the following streets: Presidente Adolfo López Mateos (Anillo Periférico), 11 de Abril, Avenida Revolución, Puente de la Morena, Viaducto Miguel Alemán, Calzada de Tlalpan, Santa Anita, Atzayacatl, Plutarco Elías Calles and Barranca del Muerto. Many of the names of the rivers, streets and neighborhoods have their origin in the pre Hispanic period.

It has a territory of 26.63 km2 (2,661.5 hectares), which is 1.8% of Mexico City, with an average altitude of 2,242 metres. It consists of 56 neighborhoods called &quot;colonias&quot; and three major apartment complexes (unidades habitacionales) which cover 2,210 city blocks and through which some of the most important city thoroughfares pass. The borough is nearly entirely residential with a socioeconomic level of middle class to upper middle class.

The borough is located in the southwest part of the Valley of Mexico. The land is flat with little variation and a portion of it is former lakebed of Lake Texcoco. The ground is highly elastic clay which extends down for about fifteen meters. The climate is temperate with an average annual temperature of 17C.

Most of the neighborhoods of the borough have a socioeconomic level of middle class to upper middle class. Forty two percent of the land is zoned for mixed use (residential/commercial), thirty nine percent residential, thirteen percent for storage and warehouses, four percent for open space and two percent industrial. Almost all housing and other construction consists of cement, cinderblock or brick, including both walls and roofs. The total number of housing units is 115,975, with 99.9% privately owned. The average number of people per household is 3.1. About 94% of housing is constructed in accordance to building codes. Housing units mostly consist of individual houses (27%), apartments in complexes (62%) and a housing arrangement called a &quot;vecindad&quot; (5%). Over 99% of residential units have running water, 99.5% have sewerage and 100% have electricity. The most important colonias are Nápoles, Del Valle, Narvarte, Mixcoac, Portales, Ciudad de los Deportes, San José Insurgentes, San Pedro de los Pinos, Xoco, Insurgentes Mixcoac, General Anaya, Noche Buena and Nativitas.

===Landmarks===

The World Trade Center is located in Colonia Nápoles. It was a development project conceived in 1947, in an area called Parque de la Lama. However, political opposition stalled the project until the 1960s. At this time, in preparation for the 1968 Olympics, the project moved forward with a total eleven spaces centered on the Hotel de México building. This complex includes the Polyforum, a commercial center, a Public Art school, a handcrafts market, a dinner theatre, garden areas, parking garage and a public transportation hub. Most of the complex would not be completed until the 1980s and the World Trade Center tower was inaugurated in 1994. Today the complex extends over covers an area of 81,000m2.

Next door to each other are the Estadio Azul (lit. Blue Stadium) and the Plaza México bullring, also on the west side of the borough. The two were constructed as part of a large project called the Ciudad de los Deportes (Sports City). This project was conceived in the late 1930s to cover what was formerly the San José Hacienda. The complex was to include swimming pools, a baseball field, an indoor jai alai court along with several outdoor ones, boxing and lucha libre rings, theatres, forty tennis courts, restaurants and parking for over two thousand cars. However, the developer went bankrupt with only the bullring near completion. This bullring was begun in 1944 and opened in 1946. It was built to replace the El Toreo ring in the La Roma neighborhood, which dated from 1907. The new facility was built with the express purpose of being the largest in the world. The bullring covers a surface of 1452m2 with a 43-meter diameter. The stands extend up for 35.9 meters and the sand area is twenty meters below street level. There is seating for between 45,000 and 48,000 people.

Both the bullring and the Estadio Azul stadium have playing fields which are about twenty meters below street level. This is because both were built over the firing pits for former brick making operations of the hacienda. The stadium was inaugurated in 1947 and has been the home of the Cruz Azul professional soccer team since 1996. The Ciudad de Deportes was planned so that cars can easily enter and exit the area, but over time, housing and other construction has crowded the area around these two landmarks. Since the 1940s, the complex has been owned and operated by the Cosío family.
The Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros was built to be a multipurpose forum to host cultural, political and social events. It is divided into several areas include a 500-seat theater, galleries, offices and the main forum space. The building is also a museum hosting twelve panels on the outside walls and 2,400 meters of interior painted with a mural called &quot;The March of Humanity&quot; by David Siqueiros. Today it remains a private institution supported by the activities it hosts and donations made to the Siqueiros Foundation. The interior mural work was originally planned for a hotel in Cuernavaca with the theme of the history of humanity. However, the concept grew to more than the hotel could host, and it was later thought to put the work in its own building in Mexico City. This eventually became the Polyforum Siqueiros with the aim of constructing the largest mural in the world, which it remains to this day.

The borough is home to a number of houses of notable persons, many of which were part of the intellectual and political life of Mexico. As of 1945, many of these homes, up to those constructed in the late 19th and early 20th century have been declared under a state of conservation. One example of this is the house in which lived Valentín Gómez Farías in what was the village of San Juan Mixcoac. It was constructed in the 17th century and still remains.

The borough has a number of public sports facilities and cultural institutions. Sports facilities include the Olympic complex of the Francisco Márquez Pool and Juan de la Barrera Gymnasium, Benito Juárez Sports Complex, Joaquín Capilla Sports Complex, Tirso Hernández Sports Complex and the Gumersindo Romero Sports Complex. The borough has thirteen &quot;casas de cultura&quot; or cultural centers to promote culture through artistic, social, handcrafts events as well as through the staging of plays. The borough also has an established for Desarrollo Social (Social Development), and audio library and a Casa Museo museum.

==History==

===Name and symbol===

The borough was created in 1970 and named after former Mexican president Benito Juárez. The current logo for the borough was adopted in 2001, which is a stylized depiction of the head of President Benito Juárez. The prior logo was a glyph of a serpent which is symbolic of Mixcoac.

===Archeology===

The main archeological finds of the area are Aztec/Mexica and include those in Mixcoac, Actipan, Tlacoquemécatl, Xoco, Portales, Ticomán, La Piedad, Ahuehuatlan, Barrio de San Juan, San Pedro de los Pinos Acachinaco (Nativitas) and one at the Metro Zapata station. The pyramid base as San Pedro de los Pinos is located near Mixcoac. It is the only one of its kind left in the borough, discovered in 1916 by Francisco Fernández del Castillo. It was a Mexica temple dedicated to the god Mixcoatl. The site also contains two temazcals as well as two Teotihuacan style sculpted heads. Artifacts have been found in other areas as well such as Xoco and Santa Cruz which include ceramics, stone knives and figurines. In the former village of Atoyac, a pre-Hispanic idol was found during the colonial era and destroyed by the Spanish. The Spanish village was built over a Mesoamerican one, which was dedicated to Tlahuac. The church of Santa Cruz Atoyac was built over the temple.

===Colonial period===
Except for small villages on the east and west side, most of the territory of the modern borough was covered by the waters of Lake Texcoco during the pre-Hispanic period. Crossing part of the east side was a causeway that linked Tenochtitlan to Iztapalapa and Tlalpan. After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, the first colonial era constructions in the area were evangelical churches built by the Franciscans such as the Church of Santa Cruz in Atoyac in 1564 and the Santo Domingo de Guzmán Church in Mixcoac in 1595. In the early colonial period, most of the area came under the jurisdiction of Hernán Cortés as part of his Coyoacán properties. As Lake Texcoco dried, the area became dotted with villages under the hacienda system and had some important roads leading south from Mexico City. The old causeway became the Calzada de Tlalpan and would eventually become the first to be paved. In the Mixcoac area, villages dotted an important colonial era road that connected the main village of Mixcoac with Tacubaya. Other important roads included that with linked San Ángel to Tacubaya, called the Atlacuihuayan, today Avenida Revolución, and the road that linked village of La Piedad with Mexico City over which bricks and pulque was transported.

The Cortés family would lose their Coyoacán lands by the early 17th century but as the lake dried, the area remained a rural zone just south of Mexico City. This city would remain within its conquest-era boundaries for all of the colonial period into the 19th century, with the Spanish living in the city and the indigenous living in the rural areas outside. However, these indigenous lost control over lands they held previously. Whatever lands they still held communally would be eventually taken over by growing Spanish-held haciendas. This area not only provided agricultural goods to Mexico City but was also important for brick making. These operations would remain important through the colonial era into the mid 19th century. In the 18th century, the territory of the modern borough included the villages of Santo Domingo, Mixcoac, La Piedad, Santa Cruz Atoyac, Actipan, San Juan Maninaltongo, Santa María Nonoalco and Xoco along with the la Candelaria, Santo Tomás Tecoyotitla and Atepuxco neighborhoods and the ranches and haciendas of Los Portales, San Borja, Nalvarte (Narvarte), San Simón, Santa Cruz, La Piedad and San Andrés de las Ladrilleras.

===19th century===
At the beginning of the 19th century and after the Mexican War of Independence, the Federal District of Mexico was created by the 1824 Constitution. This district would border but not include what is now the Benito Juárez borough, which was still rural farmland and pasture. For much of the colonial period, one of the major industries of the area was brick making, mostly for nearby Mexico City. However, by 1855 only ten small operations were left.

During the 19th century, much of the farmland disappeared and many former farm workers became factory workers, especially in textiles. Instead it was part of the Tacubaya prefecture divided into five municipalities, Tacubaya, Tacuba, Santa Fe, Cuajimalpa and Mixcoac. In 1826, much of Coyoacán, along with what are now Tlalpan, Xochimilco and Mexicalzingo became part of the State of Mexico, splitting off much of the Benito Juárez territory from Hernán Cortés’ old Coyoacan lands. For most of the 19th century, most of the borough was part of the then municipality of Tacubaya, with Mixcoac and the municipal seat. Its economy was based on meeting Mexico City&#x27;s needs for grains, flowers, pulque, textiles and other products although some were exported.

The wars of the 19th century affected the area. In 1847, U.S. troops fought their way through the territory on their way to conquering the center of Mexico City. These troops enacted a diversionary tactic at the Portales Hacienda, which allowed them to circle around and gain access to Chapultepec a day later. After this war, the Federal District was expanded to include this area along with areas farther to the south, but it was still considered outside the city proper. During the Reform War the San Pedro de los Pinos and Mixcoac areas were Liberal strongholds under General Santos Degollado.

By the early 20th century, old villages such as Nonoalco, Xoco, Catipan, San Simón Ticumac, Tlacoquemécatl and Nativitas had been integrated into the ranches and haciendas of the area, which still dominated the area. Some larger villages such as Mixcoac and La Piedad remained. La Piedad was connected to Mexico City via an avenue called La Quinta Monterde, today called Calzada Ermita. It was also known for its two cemeteries, one where common people were buried and the other, the Panteón Francés, for those with money. The first attempt to integrate the area with Mexico City proper came in 1867, but the locals especially of the village of La Piedad resisted. However, these villages were increasingly connected to the main urban center. In the 1870s, trolleys pulled by mules were operating in the area, with the first trolley concession operated by Jorge Luis Hemmerken that connected the Zocalo with San Angel and Mixcoac with Tacubaya.

Further integration of the area into Mexico City proper came in 1899 when prefectures such as Tacubaya, Mixcoac, and General Anaya became part of the city&#x27;s direct jurisdiction. The Federal District was reorganized into thirteen municipalities in 1903, with the Tacubaya area (which then accounted for much of what is now Benito Juárez) divided into the municipalities of Mixcoac, Santa Fe, Cuajimalpa and the village of Tacubaya.

===Mexican Revolution to the present===
During the Mexican Revolution, the Zapatistas took control of the south of the Federal District, including parts of Benito Juárez like Mixcoac.

Residential development of the Benito Juárez area began during and after the Mexican Revolution. Between 1909 and 1910, the streets began to be paved and numbers put on the houses. Most of the new streets in the borough are named after famous men and women from the Porfirio Díaz era. These include doctors such as Nicolás San Juan, lawyers such as Artemio de Valle Arizpe and Jose Linares, and engineers such as Gabriel Mancera. However, most of these people did not live in the area. In the 1920s, there was haphazard and unregulated subdivision development over old haciendas with the initial purpose of building country homes. This is the origin of modern &quot;colonia&quot; neighborhoods such as Del Valle, California, Berlín, Carrera Lardizábal, La Laguna and El Zacate. However, a number of villages still remained such as Mixcoac, San Pedro de los Pinos, Actipan and Tacubaya. Later in the decade, development would be more orderly and created subdivisions in Mixcoac, Tacubaya, San Pedro de los Pinos, Actipan, Navarrete and other areas. In addition, a number of colonias were created on the east side to meet the demand for middle class housing, resulting in Moderna, Portales, Santa Cruz, Postal, Álamos, Niños Héroes and Independencia. Trolley cars were introduced to facilitate transportation. This construction, along with the construction of major thoroughfares would result in the development of the borough without any ecological reserve space or major parks. Its location next to the historical extension of Mexico City proper would also mean that it would gain all city services earlier than the rest of the Federal District. This development for upper and middle classes, along with the installation of good infrastructure such as roads, schools and hospitals would allow the borough to develop with no major areas for the poor.

In 1928, the Federal District was reorganized into a Central Department and thirteen boroughs. Most of the Benito Juárez area was part of the Central Department, with a small section belonging to the municipality of General Anaya. Another reorganization in 1941, split the Central Department into four entities, Benito Juárez along with Cuauhtémoc, Venustiano Carranza and Miguel Hidalgo. The new Benito Juárez borough also included part of the General Anaya municipality, which was split between it and Coyoacán. The final borders of the borough were established on December 29, 1970, when the former circumscription of Mexico City was abolished and the Benito Juárez borough formally incorporated.

For most of the area&#x27;s history, population growth was very slow. As late as the 1850s, the municipality of Mixcoac only had 1,500 people. Urbanization began in the first half of the 20th century, but major population expansion did not occur until the 1950s when apartment buildings began to replace houses. This construction was so rapid that by 1960, the borough was considered to be completely urbanized. This was part of a process of the sudden growth of Mexico City in general, which expanded over Benito Juárez and south into Coyoacán and other southern boroughs. Benito Juárez became part of the city proper, but mostly residential, inhabited by the middle class and higher. However, the street patterns of a number of former villages can still be discerned in some areas, with many of these areas still containing older, rustic homes. This is particularly true in Mixcoac, San Juan, San Simón Ticumac, San Pedro de los Pinos, Actipan and Nonoalco.

The strongest population growth occurred between 1950 and 1960. In 1969, Plaza Universidad shopping mall opened, Mexico City&#x27;s first shopping center anchored by a department store. Since 1970, the population has continued to grow but slower, today ranking between fourth and fifth place in population in Mexico City. The Mixcoac and Churubusco Rivers were encased in cement tubes where they cross the borough. This eliminated the last of the area&#x27;s surface water.

The population decline in the borough since the 1980s has negatively affected the economy and tax base of the area with little new construction from then until the 2000s. There is strong economic pressure to convert residential structures and areas into commercial units mostly due to the borough centralized location and accessibility by road. This saturation has led to zoning violations and traffic congestion. Since 2000, the borough has worked to attract young families such as those who made it grow in the 1950s and 1960s. However, these are now two income families who need cars in order to commute to places like the north of the city, Santa Fe and Vallejo. From 2001 to 2007, the borough constructed 31,569 new residences; however, it did not result in an increase in population. It lost 5,000 in the same time period. The construction boom of the 2000s, resulted in a number of serious building code violations with 51% of the 1,816 buildings with 30,873 apartments judged deficient. Most of these violations are related to the number of parking spaces available as well as the amount of free space among apartments. The large number of new apartments built in that time period has put strain on city services. The building of massive apartment complexes has caused complaints in the borough as neighbors of these developments claim that crime rates go up. As of 2002, buildings of more than six stories are limited to certain neighborhoods.

The development of housing for the middle class and above from the 1920s on has meant that Benito Juárez the gap between rich and poor is less here than in other boroughs such as Miguel Hidalgo. Overall, the borough has the highest socioeconomic indicators in the country, according to the United Nations Development Programme. Its indicators are equivalent to those in Germany, Spain, Italy and New Zealand. The borough ranks highest in personal income, health indicators and education.

However, these socioeconomic indicators have not protected the borough from crime problems, especially in the past few decades. There has been a rise in crime rates, especially robbery of banks and cars. The number of crimes has increased and the borough is now ranked fourth in overall crime rates, moving up from fifth place in 2008. Most reported crime consists of robbery at 52.8% followed by assaults at 15.3%. One of the most dangerous areas is along Calzada de Tlalpan because of the heavy through traffic allowing perpetrators to disappear into the crowd. The colonia with the highest crime rate is Narvarte. Another problematic area is Colonia Álamos because of the high number of people passing through. Upper class Del Valle has begun to have problems with robberies and transients. The borough states that one of the main reasons for the high crime rates is that delinquents from other parts of the city come to the area looking for victims. Most of the crime takes place in eleven colonias including Insurgentes Mixcoac, San Pedro de los Pinos, Nápoles, la Unidad Miguel Alemán, Del Valle Norte, Narvarte Poniente, Niños Héroes, Nativitas, Portales Norte, Del Lago and Álamos.

==Demographics==
The borough is currently one of the most densely populated in Mexico City with 16,260 inhabitants per km2, 1.3 times the density of Mexico City as a whole. During work days, another million and a half people come into the borough to work or shop. Most of the population of the borough occurred in the mid 20th century and since then there has been a slight negative growth rate starting at −2.9% in the 1980s to -.03% in 2005, although population increased again from 2010 to 2020. The most populous neighborhoods include Narvarte Oriente, Narvarte Poniente, Del Valle Centro, Portales Norte, Del Valle Norte, El Valle del Sur, Portales Sur and Álamos.

The population of the borough is slightly older than the Mexico City average, with the highest overall standard of living. The average age in Benito Juárez is 33 years compared to the city average of 27. Most of the population is in the middle to upper middle class, with about fifty two percent white collar workers and other professionals. According to the 2005 census, 32 percent work in services, 13% as street vendors and 12% as government workers. There are 122,000 residential units with 2.9 occupants on average. 99% are literate, average schooling is 12.6 years with 117,000 people with professional level studies and 16,000 with post-graduate degrees. The borough was ranked with the highest standard of living in the country of Mexico according to the Consejo Nacional de Población.

Most of the population of the borough originates from some other part of the country with a small population of indigenous language speakers. As of 2000, 69% of the population had migrated into the borough from other parts of Mexico, especially the states of Hidalgo, Puebla, Veracruz and Oaxaca. As of 2000, there were just under 6,000 people in the borough that spoke an indigenous language, about 1.8 percent of the total, with almost all of the rest being speakers of Spanish. This ranks the borough eighth in Mexico City. Of the indigenous language speakers, just under seventy percent were women and most spoke Nahuatl at 28.5% followed by Zapotec and Otomi at 11.5 and 9.4% each.

==Economy==
The borough&#x27;s economic activity accounts for 6.2% of the total GDP of Mexico City. The largest contributing sector is construction enterprises, which make up 22.4% of the city&#x27;s construction. Services, especially professional services, makes up about seventy percent of the borough&#x27;s GDP, followed by construction at just over 27% and commerce at 17.4%. Up to two million people come into the borough on any given day for work, shopping or to study. The borough ranks second after Coyoacán in spaced dedicated to commerce at 274,366 m2. Avenida Insurgentes is the most important commercial area for the borough, with a large concentration of bars and restaurants from fast food to international cuisine at all price ranges. These serve the large number of offices that house architect, lawyers and other professional services.

The borough&#x27;s hotel infrastructure is minimal with four out of the city&#x27;s 64 five-star establishments and thirteen of its 96 four-star hotels; however, there have been recent efforts to expand tourism in the borough. Tourist attractions include the murals of the Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros, the Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes and the Insurgentes Theatre along with the archeological site at Parque Hundido, Estadio Azul and the Plaza de Toros México. Three tourist routes are planned for the borough to bring visitors to the area&#x27;s museums, historic sites, commercial centers, bars and restaurants via the city&#x27;s Turibús. Two areas especially targeted are Narvarte and Mixcoac. This follows a recently opened permanent tourist information center established in the borough.

As most of the borough is still residential, despite recent pressures to convert to commercial, much of the borough&#x27;s wealth is in the earning power of its residents. 58.9% of the total population is economically active, with an unemployment rate of under one percent. Seventy seven percent are occupied in the commerce and service sectors, most of which are jobs in retail. 20.3% are employed in industry, mostly pharmaceuticals and products for industry. Half of the population works between 33 and 48 hours per week with 29% working more than 48 hours per week. Benito Juárez is the only borough in the city ranked with high level of socioeconomic development, compared to four ranked with a medium level, ten with a low level and one with a very low level. This ranking takes into account the basic lifestyle of families here especially size and quality of housing, access to health services and education, city services, durable goods and more. Within the borough, about twenty percent of the population live in medium level conditions such as those in the Independencia, Nativitas, Portales Oriente, Residenciales and Villa de Cortés neighborhoods. However, the gap between rich and poor is significantly less than in other areas such as Cuajimalpa and Alvaro Obregon. The living standards for the borough are roughly equivalent to that of the United States.

==Education==
The borough has one of the highest education levels in Mexico City. 98.9% of the population is literate, a higher rate than Mexico City, with an average of 12.6 years of schooling. Three percent lack primary school education; fifteen percent lack middle school; twenty nine percent lack high school and fifty five percent have not attended higher education. Gender gap in education has narrowed from 6.9 years for women compared to 10 years for men in 1980 to 9.6 years for women and 10.5 years for men in 2000.

The borough has 488 schools and other educational campuses of which 147 are public and 341 are private. Public schools include thirty two early education centers, thirty six kindergartens, fifty six primary schools, twenty two middle schools, one preparatory high school, a vocational/technical high school and eighteen universities. Private institutions include one early education center, 109 kindergartens, 104 primary schools, fifty five middle schools and thirty nine preparatory high schools. The borough has 6.4% of all preschools in the city, 5.2% of the primary schools, 6.5% of middle schools, 4.9% of preparatory schools and ten percent of vocational/technical schools.

This is about ten percent of all cars registered in the city. There are 12,448,999 meters of paved roads with 89.90 km of these as main thoroughfares and 631.1 km of secondary roads. The traffic congestion slows the pace to about ten kilometers on average and as low as 4.3 during rush hours. There are 290,346 autos registered. 

A dozen major roadways that cross the borough. One system of streets that criss-cross the area is the &quot;Eje&quot; (Axis) roads which include Eje 4 Sur, Eje 5 Sur, Eje 6 Sur, Eje 7 Sur, Eje 7-A Sur, Eje 8 Sur, Eje 3 Poniente, Eje 2 Poniente and Eje Central.

Other major roadways include Boulevard Adolfo López Mateos (Periférico), Viaducto Miguel Alemán, Viaducto Río Becerra and Calzada de Tlalpan.

There are eighteen Metro stations and forty-four bus routes. In 2005, the city government built the first Metrobus line on Avenida Insurgentes. Line 1 crosses the borough between Viaducto and Barranca del Muerto stops. Since then two more Metrobus lines have been built that cross the borough as well. Line 2 crosses east-west and Line three crosses along Avenida Cuauhtémoc. Several Metro lines cross the borough. Currently operating lines include Line 3, Line 9 and Line 7. Construction of a new line, Line 12, was finished in 2012. This line cuts east-west through the borough connecting Mixcoac to Tlahuac.

<doc id="394291" wikidata="Q599406" url="?curid=394291" title="Temporalis muscle">
<text>In anatomy, the temporalis muscle, also known as the temporal muscle, is one of the muscles of mastication (chewing). It is a broad, fan-shaped convergent muscle on each side of the head that fills the temporal fossa, superior to the zygomatic arch so it covers much of the temporal bone. &quot;Temporal&quot; refers to the head&#x27;s temples.

==Structure==

In humans, the temporalis muscle arises from the temporal fossa and the deep part of temporal fascia. This is a very broad area of attachment. It passes medial to the zygomatic arch. It forms a tendon which inserts onto the coronoid process of the mandible, with its insertion extending into the retromolar fossa posterior to the most distal mandibular molar. In other mammals, the muscle usually spans the dorsal part of the skull all the way up to the medial line. There, it may be attached to a sagittal crest, as can be seen in early hominins such as &quot;Paranthropus aethiopicus&quot;.

The temporalis muscle is covered by the temporal fascia, also known as the temporal aponeurosis. This fascia is commonly used in tympanoplasty, or surgical reconstruction of the eardrum.

The temporalis muscle is accessible on the temples, and can be seen and felt contracting while the jaw is clenching and unclenching.

===Blood supply===
The muscle receives its blood supply from the deep temporal arteries which anastomose with the middle temporal artery.

===Nerve supply===
As with the other muscles of mastication, control of the temporal muscle comes from the third (mandibular) branch of the trigeminal nerve. Specifically, the muscle is supplied by the deep temporal nerves. At least 6 smaller branches recruit muscle fibres the most when each has the maximal leverage.

===Development===
The temporalis muscle is derived from the first pharyngeal arch in development.

=== Variation ===
The temporalis muscle has a complex structure. Sarcomeres are a consistent length, but larger muscle fibres vary in length in the muscle and between people. 

==Function==
The temporalis muscle is the most powerful muscle of the temporomandibular joint. The temporalis muscle can be divided into two functional parts; anterior and posterior. The anterior portion runs vertically and its contraction results in elevation of the mandible (closing the mouth). The posterior portion has fibers which run horizontally and contraction of this portion results in retrusion of the mandible. The middle portion which fibers run in an oblique direction towards inferior and anterior are used for both elevation and retraction of the mandible and in a unilateral contraction provoke lateral movement of the mandible. Motor units are recruited the most when they have the maximal leverage, maximising contractile strength.

When lower dentures are fitted, they should not extend into the retromolar fossa to prevent trauma of the mucosa due to the contraction of the temporalis muscle.

==Clinical significance==

The temporalis muscle is likely to be involved in jaw pain and headaches. Bruxism, the habitual grinding of teeth typically while sleeping, and clenching of the jaw while stressed can lead to overwork of the temporalis muscle and results in pain.

=== Seizure ===
A myotendinous rupture of the temporalis muscle can occur during a seizure due to extreme clenching of the jaw. During a seizure, the contralateral temporalis muscle can enter spastic paralysis, this clenching in extreme cases can lead to a rupture specifically on the myotendinous insertion at the coronoid process of the mandible.

=== Surgery ===
The temporalis muscle may be used in reconstructive surgery of the mouth.

During pterional craniotomy, incisions are often chosen based on the ease of reattaching the temporalis muscle after the bone fragment is replaced.

<text>Cuajimalpa de Morelos (; more commonly known simply as Cuajimalpa) is a borough (&quot;demarcación territorial&quot;) in Mexico City. It is located on the west side of the city in the Sierra de las Cruces mountains which separate Mexico City from the State of Mexico. The borough is named after the former rural town of Cuajimalpa, which has since been absorbed by urban sprawl. The borough is home to the Desierto de los Leones National Park, the first declared in Mexico as well as the second largest annual passion play in Mexico City.

==History==
The proper name of the borough is Cuajimalpa de Morelos. The borough was named after the prominent community and former municipality of San Pedro Cuajimalpa which remains the seat of local government. “Cuajimalpa” is derived from the Nahuatl “Cuauhximalpan” which meant place of sawmills. The appendage of “de Morelos” was added in 1970 to honor José María Morelos, a hero of the Mexican War of Independence .

In 1342 the Tepanecas established themselves in the area, controlling the forests for about 100 years from their capital in Azcapotzalco. When the Tepanecas were overthrown by the Aztec Triple Alliance in the mid 15th century, many fled to this rugged terrain. During the Spanish conquest, Hernán Cortés subdued settlements in the area such as Santa Rosa, Santa Lucía, Cuauhximalpan, Chimalpa and Acopilco to secure the roads leading to the Toluca Valley. In 1534, Cortés took personal control of lands in the area, calling it San Pedro Cuauhximalpa and established towns such as San Lorenzo Acopilco, San Mateo Tlaltenango and San Pablo Chimalpa.

In the 17th century the Carmelites founded a hermitage and monastery called Desierto de los Leones, today a museum and national park. At this time, the indigenous population of the area recovered enough that there were efforts to reclaim lost territory and government. To this end, a type of codex called “techialoayan” was created to document the history of indigenous communities to make legal claims. One of the most important of this is the Techialoyan Codex of Cuajimalpa. It describes a solemn meeting of authorities to confirm the extension and political organization of the area. Written in Nahuatl, it remained a valid legal document until 1865, when then Emperor Maximilian I had it translated into Spanish. Today the original document is part of the Mexican Federal Archives. In 1997, the document was named as part of the “Memory of the World” by UNESCO .

From the colonial period into the 19th and early 20th centuries, the most common economic activities in the area were the harvesting of firewood and the making of charcoal, with some raising of crops and livestock for domestic consumption. The area was also important as a way station, providing lodging and food to travelers between the Valley of Mexico and the Toluca Valley. In 1884, a rail line was constructed through the same area.

In the early 19th century, the first insurgent army under Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla arrived at the area, with Hidalgo himself staying at the Mesón San Luisito. The town of Cuajimalpa was made the seat of a municipality in 1862. During the last decades of the 19th century and into the 20th modern services such as running water, paved roads and electric lighting were introduced. A number of industries related to construction supplies were also founded.

During the Mexican Revolution there were clashes in the area between forces loyal to Venustiano Carranza and Emiliano Zapata in El Contadero and San Pedro. One story from the time says that the Zapatistas cut the ears of the inhabitants of the town of Cuajimalpa to distinguish them from those loyal to Carranza.

In 1929, the area&#x27;s status was changed from municipality to borough with the reorganization of the Federal District of Mexico City. Although it remained very rural until the 1930s, its main economic activities were in decline with many moving to Mexico City.

Prior to the 1950s, urbanization of the area was limited because of its terrain. In the mid 20th century, the industrialization of the Valley of Mexico began to reach the borough of Cuajimalpa. The population of the area increased over 900% from 1950 to 1980, with the highest rate of growth in the 1970s. New residential construction fueled the growth, covering former forest and agricultural areas especially in areas such as San Lorenzo Acopilco, Las Lajas, La Pila, Las Maromas, Xalpa, Cola de Pato, Atliburros, Cruz Blanca, Moneruco, Chancocoyotl, Teopazulco, Tlapeaca, Texcalco and Pito Real. These include large residential subdivisions such as El Contadero and Lomas de Vista Hermosa, as well as unregulated settlements on the sides of hills and small canyons. The pace of growth remained high in the 1980s, in part due to the 1985 earthquake, which prompted many to move away from the soft soils of the city center into the more solid rock of the west and south of the valley. However, the rapid development began to cause environmental problems, including the building over former pit mines which had later been used as landfills. In the 1990s, efforts were begun to regulate growth and protect natural areas. Much of the territory has been urbanized and contains some of the city&#x27;s most expensive residential and commercial real estate, with newer developments for upper classes pushing out lower income groups.

In the 1990s and 2000s there were changes in the borough&#x27;s borders due to the settlements of disputes between the Federal District and the State of Mexico.

==Geography==
The Cuajimalpa borough is located on the west side of the Federal District of Mexico City. To the west of it are the municipalities of Ocoyoacac and Huixquilucan de Degollado in the State of Mexico. It also borders the boroughs of Miguel Hidalgo, Alvaro Obregon and Magdalena Contreras in the Federal District. The borough covers an area of 8,905 hectares, just over five percent of the total of the Federal District.

The borough is situated on the east side of the Sierra de las Cruces, a volcanic mountain range which separates the Federal District of Mexico City from the State of Mexico and has an average elevation of 2,750 meters above sea level. The terrain is very rugged with mountain peaks mostly found in the center and south. These include La Palma (3,810 masl), San Miguel (3,800 masl), El Cochinito (3,760 masl) and El Ángel (3,330 masl) . The land mostly consists of volcanic rock with small valleys and canyons that contain sedimentary deposits; however, there is no longer volcanic activity.

The area contains many fissures, natural caverns and small canyons which are the result of tectonic forces and erosion. Most of these run from north-northeast to south-southwest. There are small flat areas suitable for agriculture such as around the towns of San Pablo Chimalpa and San Lorenzo Acopilco. The canyons are formed by the channeling of rainwater along fissures. There are two types of canyons: stable ones with wide bottoms and less steep slopes (mostly in the northeast) and V-shaped ones with steep unstable slopes, which can be found in various parts of the borough. The largest canyons are the Santo Domingo, Agua Azul, Los Helechos and Hueyatlaco. The borough contains seven “mini” basins called Arroyo Agua de Leones, Arroyo Santo Desierto, Río Tacubaya, Río Becerra, Río San Joaquín, Río Barrilaco and Río Magalenas. These are currents which channel rainwater along the rugged terrain with most running southwest to northeast. Three have their beginnings in the Sierra de las Cruces with the rest in the center or north of the territory. These streams and rivers then run into several other sections of Mexico City and into the State of Mexico. Because of the many cracks in the soil and rock, the borough is an important aquifer recharge area as well as the source of water for freshwater springs.
The climate ranges from temperate to cold and its mostly humid. Average annual temperatures vary between 10C and 12C with average annual precipitation varying from between 1,200mm and 1,500mm. The canyons have microclimates which tend to be moister because prevailing winds do not reach and dry them out.

About twenty percent of the borough is classified as conservation zone with the rest urbanized; however, thirty percent of the population lives in these areas. The area contains a number of threatened species of animal in the Valley of Mexico such as carpenter birds, hummingbirds, cacomistles and several species of lizard. The highest elevations, mostly encompassed by the Desierto de los Leones National Park, are the best conserved. This forest is an important source of oxygenation for the Valley of Mexico. The greatest environmental threat is the continuation of urban sprawl, which threatens forests and other protected areas. Areas which already have high levels of deforestation suffer significant erosion. Although there are official efforts in place to control building, illegal settlements are a significant concern, especially those on the edges of the national park.

==San Pedro Cuajimalpa and other communities in the borough==

The former rural town of San Pedro Cuajimalpa still maintains a distinct identity although it has been fully incorporated into the urban sprawl of Mexico City. The town used the &quot;Techialoyan Codex of Cuajimalpa&quot;, written in Classical Nahuatl at the end of the 17th century, &quot;to prove its rights to its lands, which it retained until 1865.&quot; Its main road is called Avenida Juárez, the oldest road in the borough, and connects the former town center to the old Mexico City-Toluca highway. While only very few of the old traditional houses remain (two on the corner of Avenida Juarez and Coahuila Street with a few next to Jardín Hidalgo), the historic center of the town still exists. It was named a “Barrio Mágico” in 2011.

The historic center contains a traditional Mexican market, the main plaza and the borough hall and former municipal palace. The center also contains an open-air stage called the Foro Pedro Infante. It is named after a 20th-century film star who made part of a movie called Vuelven los García on the spot. Jardín Hidalgo is next to the main plaza and the San Pedro Parish. It is a small space filled with trees and a kiosk. The borough hall contains the Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla Museum. It contains copies of the Techialoyan Codex of Cuajimalpa among other items. Originally the museum was as at a former inn called the Mesón de San Luisito, where Miguel Hidalgo stayed after the Battle of Monte de las Cruces . One modern addition to the historic center was a public skate park behind the borough offices opened in 2013.

The historic center is still dominated by the Parish of San Pedro, the oldest church in the borough. It was founded in the 16th century but the current building was begun in 1628 and completely finished in 1925. The atrium is paved and has only a few trees. The portal is Neoclassic with a frieze formed by metopes and triglyphs from ancient Greek architecture, along with a thick cornice. The main entrance has a niche on each side. A truncated arch is found above the cornice and the base has the papal seal which alludes to Saint Peter, the patron saint. The rest of the facade is covered in red tezontle stone and there are two bell towers. The interior has a single nave. On the main altar, there is an image of Saint Peter, the patron on the town, inside a cypress. The vaults and cupola of the ceiling have simple ornamentation, the side walls have various oil paintings and there are a number of images of various saints.

San Pablo Chimalpa is one of the two oldest settlements of the borough. Its name comes from Nahuatl which means “place of the shield.” Oral tradition states it was founded in 1532 by a warrior named Chimalli and Viceroy Antonio de Mendoza when land was being redistributed.

San Mateo Tlaltenango is located high in the Sierra de las Cruces next to the Desierto de los Leones. The name Tlaltenango comes from Nahuatl and means “en the walls of the earth.” The area has been occupied since the pre-Hispanic period. The current town was founded in 1532 by Hernán Cortés, with Viceroy Enrique de Almanza taking possession in 1571.

San Lorenzo Acopilco dates to the pre Hispanic period, reorganized by the conquistadors.

El Contadero dates to at least 1753 and is located on a hill on the west side of the Chapultepec forest. It began as a single house which some historians state was the main house of a hacienda despite its small size. In the 20th century, the house served as a store, inn, and cantina serving travelers on the Mexico City-Toluca road. Today the area is a small town with a few streets.

==Landmarks==

The major attraction of the borough is the Desierto de los Leones, which is home to a former monastery and retreat. In 1606, the Carmelites constructed a hermitage and monastery high up in the mountains of the Sierra de las Cruces. The name literally means “Desert of the Lions.” “Desert” is what Carmelites called remote retreats. The “lions” are from the surname of two brothers over which the monks had a dispute over the land. It remained an isolated retreat until 1814. Then the site became a hospital administered by the Company of Jesus . Today the buildings of the former monastery are home to three museums, one dedicated to the site, one to the bicentennial of Mexico&#x27;s Independence and one to the Mexican Revolution . The site is surrounded by the Desierto de los Leones National Park, the first such declared in Mexico in 1917 by Venustiano Carranza. The park extends over 1,500 hectares with mountain peaks and canyons forested with pine and holm oak. Services of the park include the Peteretes Ecological Center and an area with restaurants selling local specialties. The Desierto receives over 300,000 visitors per year with the busiest times being Holy Week and December.

The Rancho los Laureles Ecotourism Park is also in the borough. It has camping and areas for bonfires and picnics. It also has areas for mountain biking, paintball and a petting zoo with deer.

==Festivals and events==

The largest and most important annual event of the borough is the passion play and fair, the 100th edition of which was held in 2013. For the entire event, between 1.5 and 2 million people visit the town with 500,000 people for Good Friday alone. The passion play is the second largest in Mexico City after that of Iztapalapa . The passion play involves over 200 people in various speaking and non-speaking roles and locals design and make the sets. The fair occurs for the entire week, featuring local products such as handcrafts and food. During Holy Week, the sale of alcohol is banned in the borough, including nightclubs and bars.

The reenactments include events related to Jesus&#x27;s entrance to Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, and the washing of feet and the Last Supper on Maundy Thursday . The two most important days are Good Friday and Holy Saturday. The Good Friday procession extends for two kilometers and ends with the scene of the crucifixion. The cross carried by the actor playing Jesus weighs about ninety kilos. The most distinctive part of Cuajimalpa&#x27;s Holy Week is Holy Saturday. Four young men are chosen each year to play Judas, two over 18 and two under. They dress in red, wear a mask and carry a whip. Judas represents evil but those chosen to play the role are considered to have the greatest responsibility, watching over others in the passion play procession on Good Friday and help with coordination. Their tasks begin at 8am when they “rob” various stands related to the traditional fair although in reality the items are donated by the vendors. These usually include utensils and toys. Then those playing Roman soldiers go and look for Judas to arrest; however, locals then offer the Judas&#x27;s their houses to hide and often to eat and drink. At about 2 pm the Judas&#x27;s are corralled by the soldiers and brought to the parish church of San Pedro. At 3 pm the captured Judas&#x27;s are “hung” from the bell tower but then people come to the atrium to donate money for their release, often receiving one of the “stolen” items from the fair in return. One last aspect is a flogging but only for the older men playing Judas. The more traditional burning of Judas also occurs on this day, but in competition with Iztapalapa, the borough has also added a fireworks show along with monumentally sized Judas figures.

Other important events related to the religious calendar is Carnival, held just before Lent, and for the Christmas season, there is a “Christmas village” set up in the historic center, completely with ice rink and toboggan slide.

The borough also hosts an annual Feria del Hongo dedicated to the gastronomy of native mushrooms in late summer at the borough hall plaza and the Desierto de los Leones. This event has been promoted in various ways, including a series of tickets by the National Lottery.

==Education==
The borough has various public and private institutions of higher education including the Colegio de Empresarios Excelentia Fervic, the Instituto de Hematopatología, the Instituto Nacional de Administración Pública (INAP), the Universidad del Valle de México, Campus Santa Fe and the Universidad Hebarica. In the 2000s, the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana added a Cuajimalpa campus. It offers ten undergraduate degrees and seven postgraduate degrees in three academic divisions (Sciences of Communication and Design, Natural Sciences and Engineering and Social Sciences and Humanities) .

Public high schools of the &quot;Instituto de Educación Media Superior del Distrito Federal&quot; (IEMS) include:
*Escuela Preparatoria Cuajimalpa &quot;Josefa Ortiz de Domínguez&quot;

Private schools:
* Cuajimalpa campus of Peterson Schools (Lomas de Vistahermosa)

==Transportation==
Main roads include the toll federal road connecting Mexico City and Toluca, Prolongación Paseo de la Reforma, Avenida Vasco de Quiroga and the Chamapa-La Venta highway. Because of urbanization and the thru traffic between Mexico City and Toluca, there is significant congestion. The most pressing traffic problems are those in the historic center of Cuajimalpa and traffic between the rest of Mexico City and Toluca particularly during rush hours.

The most important bus lines include routes 4, 5, 76 and 80 of the RTP system.

The El Insurgente commuter rail has a stop in Santa Fe.

==Socioeconomics==

There are areas of great wealth near areas populated by lower classes. Cuajimalpa is the most expensive place to buy a house or apartment in Mexico City with the average square meter costing 55% more than the average for the rest of the city. However, prices vary widely within the borough between developments for the most wealthy and areas which are still poor.

<text>Cuauhtémoc (), named after the 16th-century Aztec ruler Cuauhtémoc, is a borough () of Mexico City. It contains the oldest parts of the city, extending over what was the entire urban core of Mexico City in the 1920s.

Cuauhtémoc is the historic and cultural center of the Capital, although it is not the geographical center. While it ranks only sixth in population, it generates about a third of the entire city&#x27;s GDP, mostly through commerce and services. It is home to the Mexican Stock Exchange, the important tourist attractions of the historic center and Zona Rosa, and various skyscrapers such as the Torre Mayor and the Mexican headquarters of HSBC. It also contains numerous museums, libraries, government offices, markets and other commercial centers which can bring in as many as 5 million people each day to work, shop or visit cultural sites.

This area has had problems with urban decay, especially in the historic center. Efforts to revitalize the historic center and some other areas have been ongoing since the 1990s, by both government and private entities. Such efforts have resulted in better public parks, such as the Alameda Central, which was renovated; the modification of streets such as 16 de Septiembre and Madero that have become car-free for pedestrians ().

==Description==
Cuauhtémoc is centered on the Zócalo or main square which contains the Aztec ruins of the Templo Mayor, the Metropolitan Cathedral and the National Palace of Mexico. The borough covers 32.44 km2, divided into 34 colonias, 2,627 city blocks, 1,267,000 m2 of green areas, 1,500 buildings classified as national monuments, two archeological zones (Tlatelolco and Templo Mayor), 1,290 private buildings with official historic value (), 210 public buildings with official historic value, 120 government buildings, and two major planned-housing complexes (Unidad Habitacional Nonoalco-Tlatelolco and Centro Urbano Benito Juárez).
In addition, the borough contains 43 museums, 23 clock towers, 150 public and private libraries, 24 centers for infant development, 6 cultural centers sponsored by the borough, 38 publicly sponsored markets with 14,434 vendors, 25 stage theaters, 123 movie theaters and 9 public sports complexes.

The sports facilities include Deportivo Cuauhtémoc in Colonia Buenavista, Deportivo José María Morelos y Pavón in Colonia Morelos, Deportivo Peñoles in Colonia Valle Gómez, Deportivo Guelatao in Colonia Centro, Deportivo Tepito in Colonia Morelos, Deportivo Antonio Caso in Tlatelolco, Deportivo Francisco Javier Mina in Colonia Guerrero, Deportivo Estado de Tabasco in Colonia Exhipódromo de Peralvillo and Deportivo 5 de Mayo in Tlatelolco. A new center called the Deportivo Bicentennario has been started in Colonia Buenos Aires. There are 264 public and private preschools, 116 middle schools, 102 technical and regular high schools and 13 teachers&#x27; colleges.

Because it is the oldest part of Mexico City, with buildings which are centuries old, deterioration is an ongoing concern. Currently, at least 789 inhabited buildings in twelve colonias have been listed as in danger of condemnation, due to structural damage caused by sinking into muddy soil of the former lakebed. These are mostly located in the historic center and the colonias immediately surrounding it. Some of these have been classified as having historic or artistic value by the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes or Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia . This has been a problem for the area for centuries and has involved famous structures such as the Metropolitan Cathedral, which had major foundation work done to stop the damage caused by uneven sinking.

A large part of this borough is divided between commercial zones and historic and cultural sites. While the borough does not have the highest crime rate in the city, with 13.9% of all Mexico City crime committed here, it is considered to be fairly dangerous because of its urbanization and the fact that most of the people found in the borough are there only to work or visit. In some older neighborhoods, people live and raise children along with street vending, squatting, and takeover of public spaces by drug addicts, drug dealers, and prostitutes. Seven of the borough&#x27;s 34 colonias have been ranked in the Top 10 most lawless in the city by the Secretary of Public Safety of Mexico City, with a few, such as Tepito, are infamous for being so. Some of these run down areas are lower class colonias such as Colonia Guerrero and Colonia Morelos, but similar problems are also found upper middle class colonias such as the northern part of Colonia Roma. The most common crimes are muggings with 1.47 reports per day, robbery of businesses with .78 reports per day, and car theft with .71 reports per day.

Most of the 5 million who come into this borough each day are there to work, visit the area&#x27;s markets, shops and cultural attractions or are tourists. The borough is the most visited area of the city by tourists, who mostly come to see the historic center and Zona Rosa. People from other parts of the city come to visit the museums and large public markets such as La Lagunilla, Mixcalco, Hidalgo, Medellín and San Juan. The influx brings in 800,000 vehicles to circulate its streets each day, with traffic jams, especially in and near the historic center nearly a daily occurrence.

===Demographics===

While it is the most important borough economically, bringing millions of people into its territory on any given day, its population of 545,884 in 2020 ranks only sixth out of the city&#x27;s 16 boroughs. This population has been steadily decreasing even as the population of the rest of the city has remained static, although there was a slight increase in the last 10 years. A fairly large percentage of the population is either over 60 years of age and over half of the residents are either single or living with a partner. The borough contains only seven percent of all housing units in the city.

Those who do live here are mostly employed in services (57.5%) and commerce (23.4%). 

===Government===

The borough was first established on December 30, 1970, after the circumscription of Mexico City was split in 4 boroughs. Before the political reforms of 2016, it was governed by a borough chief ()) and a cabinet consisting of a Secretaria Particular, Coordinacion de Asesores, Dirección Interinstitucional y de Fomento Economico, Subdirección Técnica, Subdirección de Comunicación Social and Subdirección de Unidades Habitacionales. After becoming an , the head of government became a mayor.

The seat of the borough government is located in Colonia Buenavista.

==History==

=== Tenochtitlan ===
The early history of the delegation coincides with the history of Aztec Tenochtitlan and colonial Mexico City. Tenochitlan was founded on a marshy island in Lake Texcoco. It was divided into four capuillis or neighborhoods centering on the Templo Mayor. This temple&#x27;s ruins are located very close to the modern main square or Zocalo today.

=== Spanish rule ===
When the Spanish conquered Tenochtitlan in 1521, they destroyed most of the old Aztec public buildings but kept the basic layout of the city, which roughly extends over what is now known as the historic center or Colonia Centro. The Cathedral was built over a portion of the sacred precinct (teocalli) of the destroyed Templo Mayor, the National Palace was built over Moctezuma&#x27;s New Palace and the Zocalo was built over what was an open space near the sacred temple space. Over the early colonial period, European-style construction would replace Aztec ones over the entire island city, with the most important public buildings concentrated on the blocks adjoining the Zocalo.

As the center of New Spain, the city held the greatest prestige, prompting those who had made their fortunes through conquest, mining, commerce and other means to have homes in the city, as close to the Zocalo as possible. The city soon became filled with mansions, large churches and monasteries and monumental public buildings which would eventually earn it the nickname of &quot;City of Palaces.&quot;

At the beginning of the 19th century, this city remained mostly within what is now called the historic center although various drainage projects had been enlarging the island. The city proper contained 397 streets and alleys, 12 bridges, 78 plazas, 14 parish churches, 41 monasteries, 10 colleges, 7 hospitals, a poorhouse, a cigar factory, 19 restaurants, 2 inns, 28 corrals for horses and 2 official neighborhoods.

=== Independence era ===

After Mexico gained its Independence in 1824, Mexico City was designated as the capital of the new country, and the city and its surrounding area (11.5 km2) were incorporated as a &quot;Federal District,&quot; separate from the other states.
By the late, 19th century, the city began to break its traditional confines with the construction of new neighborhoods, called colonias, in the still drying lakebed. This was especially true in the areas west of the historic area, with the creation of &quot;modern&quot; colonias for the wealthy along the Paseo de la Reforma, built earlier by Maximilian I. These colonias include Colonia Juárez, Colonia Roma, Colonia Cuauhtémoc and Colonia San Rafael. Colonias for poorer and working-class people were built mostly north and south of the city such as Colonia Morelos, and Colonia Doctores.

=== 20th century ===
In 1928, President Álvaro Obregón divided the rapidly growing Federal District area into thirteen boroughs (delegaciones), with what was then the city proper designated as the Cuauhtémoc borough. While the borough still remained the center of city&#x27;s commerce, politics, academia and culture during the first half of the 20th century, this historic center began going into decline as the wealthy moved out into the new western colonias as early as the end of 19th century. By the 1950s, the country&#x27;s main university UNAM moved almost all of its facilities out of the borough and into the newly built Ciudad Universitaria in the south of the city. In the 1940s, the city government froze rents in the borough and by the late 1990s, when this was finally repealed, many tenants were paying the same prices they were in the 1950s.With no financial incentive to keep up their properties, landlords let their buildings disintegrate. Most of this occurred in the historic center, but this phenomenon also presented itself in other areas such as Colonia San Rafael and the Centro Urbano Benito Juárez as well.

Since the 1950s, the city has received the highest number of migrants from other parts of Mexico. Most of these come from very rural areas of the country and a significant percentage speak an indigenous language with Spanish as a second language, or do not speak Spanish at all. As of 2005, seven percent of the borough&#x27;s population is made up of these migrants. These migrants have put strains on services such as education.

=== 1985 Earthquake ===

The borough was the hardest hit by the 1985 earthquake with 258 buildings completely crumbled, 143 partially collapsed and 181 were seriously damaged. The result was the loss of 100,000 residents, just in the historic center. Another area with major damage was Colonia Roma with a number of buildings collapsing completely. Even areas that did not suffer significant damage, such as Colonia San Rafael, were affected when homeless from other parts of the borough moved in, or Colonia Condesa, when wealthier residents moved out. Because of the rent situation, most of the damaged structures were never fixed or rebuilt, leading to slums or garbage-strewn vacant lots. As late as the 2000s, buildings damaged from the event have collapsed. In 2003, the city government expropriated sixty four properties thought to be in danger of sudden collapse due to damage suffered nearly 20 years earlier after a collapse of an apartment building in Colonia Vista Alegre, but in 2010 an apartment building partially collapsed in Colonia San Rafael, due to the same cause. Since the quake, the borough has invested in its own early warning system, which was created for it by UNAM.

Between the flight of wealthier residents from the historic center and the colonias that immediately surround it and the damage from the 1985 earthquake, parts of the borough became deserted at night. Former mansions had been converted into tenements for the poor, and the sidewalks and streets were taken over by pickpockets and street vendors, especially in the historic center. This made the area unpalatable for tourists. As the historic center is the city&#x27;s main tourist attraction, the city lost its standing as a destination for international visitors, instead becoming an airport connection for other areas of the country. Until recently, many of the restaurants of the area, even the best, would close early to allow employees time to get home because the area was not particularly safe at night.

=== Contemporary events ===
Starting in the late 1990s, the city and federal governments, along with some private associations have worked to revitalize the borough, especially the historic center. Starting in the early 2000s, the government infused 500 million pesos (US$55 million) into the Historic Center Trust and entered into a partnership with a business group led by Carlos Slim, to buy dozens of centuries-old buildings and other real estate to rehabilitate. Work has concentrated on renovating historic buildings, repaving streets, and improving water, lighting and other infrastructure. A number of the oldest streets near the Zocalo have been made into pedestrian only and most street vendors have been forced to move out of the historic center. This paved the way for the opening of upscale eateries, bars and fashionable stores. Also, young people are moving into downtown lofts. To attract more tourists, there are new red double-decker buses. There have been other efforts in other parts of the borough such as in Colonia Juarez and Colonia Obrera but with mixed results.

However, this has not resolved all of the borough&#x27;s problems. Many of the problems with urban decay (abandoned buildings, squatters, uncontrolled street vending, crime, etc.) continue. The continued migration of people into the area from rural parts of Mexico has increased illiteracy rates, in addition to poorer areas where dropout rates are high. The borough government has been accused of corruption by the Cámara de Comercio, Servicios y Turismo (Chamber of Commerce, Services and Tourism), especially in the issuance of business permits with exorbitant fee and fines. Most of the problem is with small torilla operations, paper stores and small grocery stores which operate completely at the discretion of borough agents.

==Economy==

Cuauhtémoc alone accounts for 35.1% of Mexico City&#x27;s entire GDP, and by itself, has the seventh largest economy in Mexico. Most of the borough&#x27;s economy is based on commerce (52.2%), followed by services (39.4%). The borough is home to a large number of federal and city government buildings, especially in the historic center, Colonia Tabacalera and Colonia Doctores.

Paseo de la Reforma, especially the section which divides Colonia Juárez from Colonia Cuauhtémoc, is the most modern and constantly developing part of the borough. It is home to the Mexican Stock Exchange, the headquarters of HSBC in Mexico and Mexico City&#x27;s tallest skyscrapers, Torre Reforma, Chapultepec Uno, Torre BBVA México and Torre Mayor.

Construction of office buildings and high rise apartments continue in the area, causing it to become a distinctive neighborhood of its own: the high-rises that face the avenue are very distinct from the older ones behind them, mostly used for more traditional housing and small businesses. One of the newest major projects in the mid-2000s was Reforma 222, two towers combining office space with residential units.

In the rest of the borough, commerce is more traditional with numerous public markets, informal markets called tianguis and street peddling. Public markets are buildings constructed and maintained by a city or municipal government, which rents stands to private vendors. The largest is La Lagunilla Market, with nearly 2,000 vendors divided among three large warehouse type buildings. It is known for its large furniture and shoe market but most of the vendors sell food and everyday items. Designed to &quot;modernize&quot; the tradition of tianguis or street markets, some were even promoted through art, such as the Abelardo L. Rodriguez Market. Tianguis still survive and can be found in most parts of the borough as well as in much of the rest of Mexico. In the borough, the best known tianguis is located in Tepito in which 12,000 people do business on the streets.

Tourism plays a major role in the borough&#x27;s economy. It contains some of the best-known landmarks of Mexico City, so it has become the most visited area of the city by tourists. The most popular areas are the historic center, Alameda Central/Bellas Artes, Reforma, and Zona Rosa. The borough also has the most developed hotel infrastructure, with 389 hotels out of the 6,464 in the city. About half of all four and five-star hotels are located here.

Government is also one of the main employers: the National Government Palace, the Senate of the Republic and Mexico City administrative buildings are located in the borough.

Within Cuauhtémoc, Aeroméxico and HSBC Mexico have their headquarters in Colonia Cuauhtémoc. Cablemás and Magnicharters have their headquarters in Colonia Juárez.

==Transportation==
===Roads===

The borough has 14 million meters of roadways with 314 main intersections. The vast majority of these are current and former residential streets, but there are also three expressways and various axis roads () for through traffic.

The three main arteries are the Circuito Interior, Viaducto Miguel Alemán and San Antonio Abad, which were built for traffic passing through the center of the city. The Circuito Interior is a circular bypass and it is the second most important roadway in the city after the Anillo Periférico .

The are a series of north-south and west-east roads built by Carlos Hank González in the 1980s to make Mexico City more automobile-friendly. The largest of these is the Eje Central which runs north south and divides the historic center in half. Due to the large number of people who enter and leave this borough each day, up to 800,000 vehicles circulate the streets each day, making traffic jams, especially in the historic center, a frequent occurrence.

===Bicitaxis===
The cycle rickshaw, known in Mexico as (from the English &quot;bike taxi&quot;), is a popular means of transport in the historic center.

===Public transportation===
The borough has the largest number of Metro lines running through it. These include Line 1, Line 2, Line 3, Line 5, Line 8, Line 9 and Line B. There are also trolleybus lines running north-south and east-west, Lines 1 and 3 of the Metrobus as well as numerous bus routes. Another important public transportation service is the Tren Suburbano commuter railway, which has its southern terminal in Colonia Buenavista with service north as far as Cuautitlán in the State of Mexico.

==Education==

In the 2007–2008 school year, there were 22,651 K-12 students, about 6.36% of Mexico City&#x27;s total. 70.64% attend public schools and 29.14% attend private schools. There are 264 public and private preschools, 116 middle schools, 102 technical and regular high schools, and 13 teachers’ colleges. The borough has the lowest level of illiteracy and the highest percentage of students who have finished primary and middle schools, in part because there is a higher than average percentage of private schools, which tend to have better results. The dropout rate, at 7.54%, is better than average.

In 2009, there were 1,737 students receiving special education full or part-time accounting for 4.66% of all special education students in Mexico City. Over 97% of these students get their services from public institutions. However, the borough has limited facilities for adult education, especially for those who do not speak Spanish as their first language or are undereducated. This is problematic due to the influx of indigenous people from rural parts of Mexico.

Private schools:
* Plantel Azahares of the Sistema Educativo Justo Sierra
* Colegio Amado Nervo in Colonia Roma Sur
* Colegio Liceo Mexicano, a private elementary school (Colonia Roma)

Colegio Alemán Alexander von Humboldt previously had a campus at 43 Benjamin G. Hill in Hipódromo Condesa, in what is now a part of Universidad La Salle.

<text>The Picos de Europa (&quot;Peaks of Europe&quot;, also the Picos) are a mountain range extending for about , forming part of the Cantabrian Mountains in northern Spain.
The range is situated in the Autonomous Communities of Asturias, Cantabria and Castile and León.
The highest peak is Torre de Cerredo, at an elevation of  (8,690 ft).

==Name==
A widely accepted origin for the name is that they were the first sight of Europe for ships arriving from the Americas. The name can be traced to Lucio Marineo Sículo, who mentioned the &quot; Rupes Europae&quot; in 1530. Ambrosio Morales, chronist of Felipe II of Spain, mentions the &quot;Montañas de Europa&quot; in 1572. Prudencio de Sandoval calls them the &quot;Peñas o Sierras de Europa&quot; in 1601.

The origin of the name can be also traced back to ancient times when this mountainous region was inhabited by various peoples, including the Cantabri, an ancient Celtic tribe. The Cantabri were known for their resistance against Roman invasions and their rugged way of life in the mountains.

==Geography==
The range consists of three major massifs: Central (also known as &quot;Urrieles&quot;), Eastern (Ándara) and Western (also known as the &quot;Picos de Cornión&quot;). The Central and Western massifs are separated by the deep Cares Gorge (&quot;Garganta del Cares&quot;), with the village of Caín at its head. The waters in the Cares mostly arise from cave resurgences. Some of the water in the Cares river is diverted through a hydroelectric scheme, with a canal running in the northern wall of the gorge to Camarmeña.

Almost all of the rock in the Picos is limestone, and glacial action has contributed to create an impressive area of alpine karst. The highest peak is &quot;Torre de Cerredo&quot;, with an altitude of 2,650 metres at . Many other peaks reach altitudes of over 2,600 m. The area is popular with mountaineers, climbers and mountain walkers. There is a good network of well-established mountain refuges. The best-known climbing site is the &quot;Naranjo de Bulnes&quot; or &quot;Picu Urriellu&quot;, in the Urrieles massif which can be considered the most famous climb in Spain.

Vega de Liordes, an enclave in the León sector of Picos de Europa belonging to the municipality of Posada de Valdeón registered on January 7, 2021.

==Nature==
Cantabrian brown bears (&quot;Ursus arctos pyrenaicus&quot;) and wolves (&quot;Canis lupus signatus&quot;) live in the more remote regions. Rebeccos (Cantabrian chamois - &quot;Rupicapra pyrenaica parva&quot;) are fairly frequently seen (according to a 2006 Ministry of the Environment report, there were around 8,000 sightings that year); choughs and buzzards are common, various eagles and vultures are frequently seen, and there is a diverse butterfly population in the park.

Most of the region is now protected as a single &quot;Picos de Europa National Park&quot; in Cantabria, Asturias and León provinces of Spain; the Asturian part was Spain&#x27;s first National Park. Access is via minor roads to each of the three massifs from the north and from the south to the aerial tramway at Fuente Dé and to Caín at the head of the Cares Canyon.

==Caves==
The Picos de Europa contain many of world&#x27;s deepest caves, including Torca del Cerro (−1589 m), Sima de la Cornisa (−1507 m), Torca los Rebecos (−1255 m) and Pozo del Madejuno (−1252 m). Discovery of new caves and their exploration still continues.

==Gastronomy==
The Picos support a dwindling group of shepherds who move up from the valleys in the summer with their sheep, goats, cows, and an occasional pig. The area is famed for its piquant blue cheeses, such as Cabrales cheese and Picón Bejes-Tresviso.

<doc id="394310" wikidata="Q432372" url="?curid=394310" title="Marquee Moon">
<text>Marquee Moon is the debut studio album by American rock band Television, released on February 8, 1977, by Elektra Records. In the years leading up to the album, Television had become a prominent act in the New York music scene and generated interest from a number of record labels, eventually signing a record deal with Elektra. The group rehearsed extensively in preparation for &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; before recording it at A &amp; R Recording in September 1976. It was produced by the band&#x27;s frontman Tom Verlaine and sound engineer Andy Johns.

For &quot;Marquee Moon&quot;, Verlaine and fellow guitarist Richard Lloyd abandoned contemporary punk rock&#x27;s power chords in favor of rock and jazz-inspired interplay, melodic lines, and counter-melodies. The resulting music is largely hook-driven with complex instrumental parts (particularly on longer tracks such as &quot;Marquee Moon&quot;), while evoking themes of adolescence, discovery, and transcendence through imagery in urban, pastoral, and nocturnal modes, including references to the geography of Lower Manhattan. Influenced by Bohemian and French poetry, Verlaine&#x27;s lyrics also feature puns and double entendres intended to give the songs an impressionistic quality in describing his perception of an experience.

Released to widespread acclaim, &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; was hailed by critics as an original musical development in rock music. The critical recognition helped the album achieve unexpected commercial success in the United Kingdom, despite poor sales in the United States. Among the most acclaimed music releases in history, it consistently features in professionally curated lists of top albums, including various iterations of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, on which it ranked 128th in the 2003 list and 107th in the 2020 list. &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; also proved to be a foundational record of alternative rock, as Television&#x27;s innovative instrumentation on the album strongly influenced subsequent post-punk, new wave, and indie rock movements of the 1980s and rock guitar playing in general.

== Background ==
By the mid-1970s, Television had become a leading act in the New York music scene. They first developed a following from their residency at the Lower Manhattan club CBGB, where they helped persuade club manager Hilly Kristal to feature more unconventional musical groups. The band had received interest from labels by late 1974, but chose to wait for an appropriate record deal. They turned down a number of major labels, including Island Records, for whom they had recorded demos with producer Brian Eno. Eno produced demos of &quot;Prove It&quot;, &quot;Friction&quot;, &quot;Venus&quot;, and &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; in December 1974, but Television frontman Tom Verlaine did not approve of Eno&#x27;s sound: &quot;He recorded us very cold and brittle, no resonance. We&#x27;re oriented towards really strong guitar music ... sort of expressionistic.&quot;

After founding bassist Richard Hell left in 1975, Television enlisted Fred Smith, whom they found more reliable and rhythmically adept. The band quickly developed a rapport and a musical style that reflected their individual influences: Smith and guitarist Richard Lloyd had a rock and roll background, drummer Billy Ficca was a jazz enthusiast, and Verlaine&#x27;s tastes varied from the rock group 13th Floor Elevators to jazz saxophonist Albert Ayler. That same year, Television shared a residency at CBGB with singer and poet Patti Smith, who had recommended the band to Arista Records president Clive Davis. Although he had seen them perform, Davis was hesitant to sign them at first. He was persuaded by Smith&#x27;s then boyfriend Allen Lanier to let them record demos, which Verlaine said resulted in &quot;a much warmer sound than Eno got&quot;. However, Verlaine still wanted to find a label that would allow him to produce Television&#x27;s debut album himself, even though he had little recording experience.

== Recording and production ==
In August 1976, Television signed a recording deal with Elektra Records, which promised Verlaine he could produce the band&#x27;s first album with the condition that he would be assisted by a well-known recording engineer. Verlaine, who did not want to be guided in the studio by a famous producer, enlisted engineer Andy Johns based on his work for the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1973 album &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot;. Lloyd was also impressed by Johns, who he said had produced &quot;some of the great guitar sounds in rock&quot;. Johns was credited as the co-producer on &quot;Marquee Moon&quot;. Elektra did not query Television&#x27;s studio budget for the recording.

Television recorded &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; in September 1976 at A &amp; R Recording in New York City. In preparation for the album&#x27;s recording, Television had rehearsed for four to six hours a day and six to seven days a week. Lloyd said they were &quot;both really roughshod musicians on one hand and desperadoes on the other, with the will to become good&quot;. During preparations, the band rejected most of the material they had written over the course of three years. Once they were in the studio, they recorded two new songs for the album—&quot;Guiding Light&quot; and &quot;Torn Curtain&quot;—and older songs such as &quot;Friction&quot;, &quot;Venus&quot;, and the title track, which had become a standard at their live shows. Verlaine said that, because he had predetermined the structure of the album, only those eight songs and a few others were attempted during the recording sessions. 

For most of &quot;Marquee Moon&quot;, Johns recorded Television as they performed live in the studio. A few songs were recorded in one take, including the title track, which Ficca assumed was a rehearsal. Johns suggested that the group record another take of the song, but Verlaine told him to &quot;forget it&quot;. Verlaine and Lloyd&#x27;s guitars were recorded to the left and right channels respectively, and the final recordings were left unadorned by effects or compression.

== Music ==
&quot;Marquee Moon&quot; is described by Jason Heller from &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; as &quot;elegantly jagged&quot; art punk, It is also described more regularly as punk rock by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and Tyler Wilcox of &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, and on the sleeve of the 2003 reissue of the album, the music is described as punk that doesn&#x27;t sound like the more cartoonish examples. Ira Robbins of &quot;Trouser Press&quot; classified it as new wave. As Tom Moon observed, Verlaine&#x27;s singing avoids the &quot;cursory punk snarl&quot; while the band&#x27;s music demonstrates &quot;extended instrumental sections, impenetrable moods&quot; (as on &quot;Torn Curtain&quot;) and historical rock influences like Chuck Berry and the early music of the Rolling Stones (as on &quot;Friction&quot;).

&quot;As peculiar as it sounds, I&#x27;ve always thought that we were a pop band&quot;, Verlaine later told &quot;Select&quot;. &quot;You know, I always thought &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; was a bunch of cool singles. And then I&#x27;d realise, Christ, [the title track] is ten minutes long. With two guitar solos.&quot; According to Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the album is &quot; of tense garage rockers that spiral into heady intellectual territory, which is achieved through the group&#x27;s long, interweaving instrumental sections&quot;.
The album has also been described as the way to the development of post-punk by Luke Edwards on the website Dig! musical genre that would emerge from the ashes of punk rock a few years later. 

Verlaine and Lloyd&#x27;s guitar parts on the album are interplayed around the rhythm section&#x27;s drum hits and basslines. Their dual playing draws on 1960s rock and avant-garde jazz styles, abandoning the power chords of contemporary punk rock in favor of melodic lines and counter-melodies. Verlaine&#x27;s guitar establishes the song&#x27;s rhythmic phrase, against which Lloyd is heard playing dissonant melodies. Lloyd had learned to notate his solos by the time they recorded &quot;Marquee Moon&quot;, allowing him to develop his solo for a song from introduction to variation and resolution. Some songs have the two guitarists trading rhythmic and melodic lines several times while producing tension. &quot;There weren&#x27;t many bands where the two guitars played rhythm and melody back and forth, like a jigsaw puzzle&quot;, Lloyd said.

Most of the solos on &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; follow a pattern wherein Verlaine runs up a major scale but regresses slightly after each step. On &quot;See No Evil&quot;, he solos through a full octave before playing a blues-influenced riff, and on the title track, he is heard playing in the Mixolydian mode and lowering the seventh by half a step. &quot;Friction&quot; opens with Lloyd playing octaves before Verlaine&#x27;s ringing harmonics and series of descending scales.

=== Lyrics ===
Verlaine&#x27;s lyrics on &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; combine urban and pastoral imagery. Although it is not a concept album, many of its songs make geographical references to Lower Manhattan. According to Bryan Waterman, author of the 33⅓ book on the record, it celebrates stern adolescence in the urban pastoral mode. Its urban nocturne theme is derived from poetic works about Bohemian decadence. According to &quot;Spin&quot;, the album is about urban mythology; Verlaine brought &quot;a sentimental romanticism to the Bowery, making legends out of the mundane&quot;. The lyrics also incorporate maritime imagery, including the paradoxical &quot;nice little boat made out of ocean&quot; in &quot;See No Evil&quot;, the waterfront setting in &quot;Elevation&quot;, sea metaphors in &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, and references to docks, caves, and waves in &quot;Prove It&quot;.

Although Verlaine was against drug use after Television formed, he once had a short-lived phase using psychedelic drugs, to which he makes reference in similes on songs like &quot;Venus&quot;. Its vignette-like lyrics follow an ostensibly drug-induced, revelatory experience: &quot;You know it&#x27;s all like some new kind of drug / my senses are sharp and my hands are like gloves / Broadway looks so medieval, it seems to flap like little pages / I fell sideways laughing, with a friend from many stages.&quot;

According to Waterman, while psychedelic trips informed the experiences of many artists in Lower Manhattan at the time, &quot;Venus&quot; contributed to the impression of &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; as a transcendental work in the vein of 19th-century Romanticism. &quot;Verlaine is into perception&quot;, Waterman said, &quot;and sometimes the perception he represents is as intense as a mind-altering substance.&quot; Christgau said that lyrics such as the reference to Broadway in &quot;Venus&quot; lent the album its association among critics to the East Village, as it &quot;situates this philosophical action in the downtown night&quot;.

&quot;Marquee Moon&quot; inspired interpretations from a variety of sources, but Verlaine conceded he did not understand the meaning behind much of his lyrics. He drew on influences from French poetry and wanted to narrate the consciousness or confusion of an experience rather than its specific details. He compared the songs to &quot;a little moment of discovery or releasing something or being in a certain time or place and having a certain understanding of something&quot;.

Verlaine also used puns and double-entendres when writing his lyrics, which he said are atmospheric and convey the meaning of a song implicitly. &quot;See No Evil&quot; opens with the narrator&#x27;s and closes with an imperative about limitless possibilities: &quot;Runnin&#x27; wild with the one I love / Pull down the future with the one you love&quot;. The refrain to &quot;Venus&quot; mentions falling into &quot;the arms of Venus de Milo&quot; (the armless statue), which Verlaine explained as &quot;a term for a state of feeling. They&#x27;re loving [ubiquitous] arms&quot;.
== Title and packaging ==
&quot;Marquee Moon&quot;″s title was interpreted by Waterman as an encapsulation of the urban and bucolic imagery in the songs, &quot;suggesting the kind of night sky only visible above the neon glare of city-dwellers&#x27; assault on the dark&quot;. In his mind, the marquee rather than the moon in the concept sets the record&#x27;s mood. He added, &quot;sensory experience will be of prime importance to these eight songs. What can we see by the light of a marquee moon? What will be revealed on &quot;Marquee Moon&quot;″s grooves?&quot;

The album&#x27;s packaging was designed by art director Tony Lane. The front cover photo was shot by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, who had previously shot the cover for Patti Smith&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Horses&quot;. His photo situated Verlaine a step in front of the rest of the band, who were captured in a tensed, serious pose. Verlaine held his left hand across his body and extended his slightly clenched right hand forward. When Mapplethorpe gave Television the contact prints, Lloyd took the band&#x27;s favorite shot to a print shop in Times Square and asked for color photocopies for the group members to mull over. Although the first few copies were oddly colored, Lloyd asked the copy worker to print more &quot;while turning the knobs with his eyes closed&quot;. He likened the process to Andy Warhol&#x27;s screen prints. After he showed it to the group, they chose the altered copy over Mapplethorpe&#x27;s original photo, which Fred Smith subsequently had framed and kept for himself.

== Marketing and sales ==
&quot;Marquee Moon&quot; was released on February 8, 1977, in the United States and on March 4 in the United Kingdom, where it was an unexpected success and reached number 28 on the albums chart. The record&#x27;s two singles—the title track and &quot;Prove It&quot;—both charted on the UK Top 30. Its commercial success in the UK was partly fueled by Nick Kent&#x27;s rave two-page review of the album for &quot;NME&quot;.

While holidaying in London after &quot;Marquee Moon&quot;″s completion, Verlaine saw that Television had been put on &quot;NME&quot;″s front cover and notified Elektra&#x27;s press department, who encouraged the band to capitalize on their success there with a tour of the UK. However, the label had already organized for the band to perform on Peter Gabriel&#x27;s American tour as a supporting act. Television played small theatres and some larger club venues, and received more mainstream exposure, but were not well received by Gabriel&#x27;s middle-American audiences, and found the tour unnerving. 

In May, Television embarked on a highly successful theatre tour of the UK with Blondie as their supporting act. They were enthusiastically received by audiences there, and Verlaine said it was refreshing to perform at large theatres after playing smaller clubs for four years. He nonetheless felt that Blondie did not suit their show because they were too different artistically, even though both groups had emerged from the music scene at CBGB. Blondie guitarist Chris Stein said that Television were &quot;so competitive&quot; and unaccommodating on the tour, and that they did not treat it like a joint effort. He recalled one show where &quot;all our equipment was shoved up at the [Glasgow] Apollo and we had like three feet of room so that [Verlaine] could stand still in this vast space.&quot;

By the time of Television&#x27;s return to the US, Elektra had given up on promoting &quot;Marquee Moon&quot;, which they dismissed as a commercial failure. &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; sold fewer than 80,000 copies in the US and failed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The group was dispirited by their inability to meet commercial expectations, which contributed to their disbandment in 1978.
== Critical reception and legacy ==
&quot;Marquee Moon&quot; was met with critical acclaim. According to music journalist and biographer Tony Fletcher, critics in 1977 found the album difficult to categorize and instead hailed it as &quot;something entirely original, a new dawn in rock music&quot;. Verlaine later said of the overwhelmingly positive response from critics:

In &quot;NME&quot;, Kent wrote that Television have proven to be ambitious and skilled enough to achieve &quot;new dimensions of sonic overdrive&quot; with an &quot;inspired work of pure genius, a record finely in tune and sublimely arranged with a whole new slant on dynamics&quot;. He deemed the album&#x27;s music vigorous, sophisticated, and innovative at a time when rock is wholly conservative. For &quot;Sounds&quot;, Vivien Goldman hailed &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; as &quot;an obvious, unabashed, instant classic&quot;, while Peter Gammond of &quot;Hi-Fi News &amp; Record Review&quot; called it one of the most exciting releases in music, highlighted by Verlaine&#x27;s steely, Gábor Szabó-like guitar and authentic rock music. In &quot;Audio&quot;, Jon Tiven wrote that although the vocals and production could be more amplified, Verlaine&#x27;s lyrics and guitar &quot;manage to viscerally and intellectually grab the listener&quot;. Joan Downs from &quot;Time&quot; felt the band&#x27;s sound is distinguished more by the bold playing of Lloyd, who she said has the potential to become a major figure in rock guitar. Christgau, in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, claimed Verlaine&#x27;s &quot;-philosophical&quot; lyrics could sustain the album alone, as could the guitar playing, which he said is as penetrating and expressive as Eric Clapton or Jerry Garcia &quot;but totally unlike either&quot;. Tom Hull, his colleague at the &quot;Voice&quot;, recalls being in Christgau&#x27;s apartment when he received an advance copy and witnessing his &quot;instantly rapturous&quot; reaction to the album. &quot;Without being a guitar fetishist&quot;, Hull said he personally found it &quot;as distinctive and powerful as any of its iconic peers—things like &quot;&quot; and &quot;Layla&quot; and Led Zep&#x27;s first album&quot;.

Some reviewers expressed reservations. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Ken Tucker said the lyrics generally amount to non sequiturs, meaningless phrases, and pretentious aphorisms, but are ultimately secondary to the music. Although he found Verlaine&#x27;s solos potentially formless and boring, Tucker credited him for structuring his songs around chilling riffs and &quot;a new commercial impulse that gives his music its catchy, if slashing, hook&quot;. &quot;High Fidelity&quot; felt the music&#x27;s &quot;scaring amalgam of rich, brightly colored textures&quot; compensates for Verlaine&#x27;s nearly unintelligible lyrics. Noel Coppage from &quot;Stereo Review&quot; was more critical of the singing and songwriting, likening &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; to a stale version of Bruce Springsteen. Nigel Hunter wrote in &quot;Gramophone&quot; that Verlaine&#x27;s lyrics and guitar playing are vague and that listeners will need a &quot;strong commitment to this type of music to get much out of it&quot;.

At the end of 1977, &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; was voted the third-best album of the year in the Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. Christgau, the poll&#x27;s creator and supervisor, ranked it number one on his own year-end list, and a few years later, he named it the 11th best album of the 1970s. &quot;Sounds&quot; also named it the year&#x27;s best album, while &quot;NME&quot; ranked it fifth on its year-end list.

=== Reappraisal ===
Since the album&#x27;s original release, &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; has been cited by rock critics as one of the greatest records of the American punk rock movement, with Mark Weingarten of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; calling it the masterpiece of the 1970s New York punk rock scene. According to English writer Clinton Heylin, &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; marked the end of the New York scene&#x27;s peak period, while &quot;Spin&quot; said it was the CBGB era&#x27;s &quot;best and most enduring record&quot; and ranked it as the sixth-greatest album of all time in its April 1989 issue. &quot;Q&quot; included it in the magazine&#x27;s 2002 list of the 100 greatest punk records, while writer Colin Larkin ranked it ninth and &quot;Mojo&quot; ranked it 35th on similar lists. The album has often been voted high in critics&#x27; polls of the greatest debuts and has also been named one of the greatest records of the 1970s by &quot;NME&quot;, who ranked it tenth, and &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, who ranked it third. 

&quot;Marquee Moon&quot; has frequently appeared on rankings of the greatest albums of all time. &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot; placed it 33rd and 25th, respectively, on lists published at the turn of the 21st century. In Larkin&#x27;s 2000 book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;, &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; ranked at number 53. On September 23, 2003, the album was reissued by Rhino Entertainment with several bonus tracks, including the first CD appearance of Television&#x27;s 1975 debut single &quot;Little Johnny Jewel (Parts 1 &amp; 2)&quot;. That same year, it was named the fourth-greatest album of all time by &quot;NME&quot;, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed it at number 128 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. It has been viewed as one of the greatest rock albums ever by English radio DJs Marc Riley, who said that &quot;there&#x27;s been nothing like it before or since&quot;, and Mark Radcliffe, who called it &quot;the nearest rock record to a string quartet—everybody&#x27;s got a part, and it works brilliantly.&quot;

=== Influence ===
Among the most influential records from the 1970s, the album has also been cited by critics as a cornerstone of alternative rock. It heavily influenced the indie rock movement of the 1980s, while post-punk acts appropriated the album&#x27;s uncluttered production, introspective tone, and meticulously performed instrumentation. Hunter Felt from &quot;PopMatters&quot; attributed &quot;Marquee Moon&quot;″s influence on post-punk and new wave acts to the precisely syncopated rhythm section of Fred Smith and Billy Ficca. He recommended 2003&#x27;s &quot;definitive&quot; reissue of the album to listeners of garage rock revival bands, who he said had modeled themselves after Verlaine&#x27;s Romantic poetry-inspired lyrics and the &quot;jaded yet somehow impassioned cynicism&quot; of his vocals. According to Sputnikmusic&#x27;s Adam Downer, Television introduced an unprecedented style of rock and roll on &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; that inaugurated post-punk music, while &quot;The Guardian&quot; said it scaled &quot;amazing new heights of sophistication and intensity&quot; as a &quot;gorgeous, ringing beacon of post-punk&quot; despite being released several months before the Sex Pistols&#x27; &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks&quot; (1977). Erlewine, writing for AllMusic, believed the record was innovative for abandoning previous New York punk albums&#x27; swing and groove sensibilities in favor of an intellectually stimulating scope that Television achieved instrumentally rather than lyrically. He claimed &quot;it&#x27;s impossible to imagine post-punk soundscapes&quot; without &quot;Marquee Moon&quot;. Fletcher argued that the songs&#x27; lack of compression, groove, and extra effects provided &quot;a blueprint for a form of chromatic, rather than rhythmic, music that would later come to be called angular&quot;.

In Erlewine&#x27;s opinion, &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; was radical and groundbreaking primarily as &quot;a guitar rock album unlike any other&quot;. Verlaine and Lloyd&#x27;s dual playing on the album strongly influenced alternative rock groups such as the Pixies, noise rock acts such as Sonic Youth, and big arena bands like U2. According to Greg Kot from the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Television &quot;created a new template for guitar rock&quot; because of how Verlaine&#x27;s improvised playing was woven together with Lloyd&#x27;s precisely notated solos, particularly on the title track. As a member of U2, Irish guitarist The Edge simulated Television&#x27;s guitar sound with an effects pedal. He later said he had wanted to &quot;sound like them&quot; and that &quot;Marquee Moon&quot;″s title track had changed his &quot;way of thinking about the guitar&quot;. 

Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Rob Sheffield called &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; &quot;one of the all-time classic guitar albums&quot; whose tremulous guitar twang was an inspiration behind bands such as R.E.M. and Joy Division. Joy Division&#x27;s Stephen Morris cited it as one of his favorite albums, while R.E.M.&#x27;s Michael Stipe said his love of &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; was &quot;second only to [Patti Smith&#x27;s] &quot;Horses&quot;&quot;. Will Sergeant said it was also one of his favorite records, and that Verlaine and Lloyd&#x27;s guitar playing was a major influence on his band Echo &amp; the Bunnymen. Verlaine&#x27;s jagged, expressive sound on the album made a great impression on Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante when he started developing as a guitarist in his early 20s. In his words, it reminded him that &quot;none of those things that are happening in the physical dimension mean anything, whether it&#x27;s what kind of guitar you play or how your amp&#x27;s set up. It&#x27;s just ideas, you know, emotion.&quot;

<text>Derek Christopher Lowe (born June 1, 1973) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. During his career, he played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Seattle Mariners, Boston Red Sox, Los Angeles Dodgers, Atlanta Braves, Cleveland Indians, New York Yankees, and Texas Rangers.

Lowe made his MLB debut in 1997. He threw a no-hitter for the Red Sox in 2002. In the 2004 post-season he had a 3–0 win–loss record as he helped lead Boston to its first World Series championship in 86 years.

==Early years==
Lowe attended Edsel Ford High School in Dearborn, Michigan, where he was a four-sport letterman in baseball, golf, soccer, and basketball. He was an All-League honoree in all four sports, and was a first-team all-state pick in basketball. Lowe committed to attend Eastern Michigan University on a basketball scholarship.

==Baseball career==

===Minor leagues===
The Seattle Mariners drafted Lowe in the eighth round of the 1991 MLB draft. He signed with the Mariners on June 7, 1991, forgoing his college scholarship. The Mariners immediately assigned him to their rookie league team, where he went 5–3 with a 2.41 earned run average (ERA) in 12 starts.

He spent the next several years working his way through several minor league teams: 1992 – Single-A Bellingham (7–3, 2.42 – 13 starts), 1993 – Single-A Riverside (12–9, 5.26, 26 starts), 1994 – Double-A Jacksonville (7–10, 4.94, 26 starts), 1995 – Double-A Port City (1–6, 6.08, 10 starts), 1996 – Triple-A Tacoma (6–9, 4.54, 16 starts).

===Seattle Mariners===
Lowe made his major league debut on April 26, 1997, working innings in relief against the Toronto Blue Jays. He made his first major league start on May 27 against the Minnesota Twins, giving up four runs in five innings. His first career win came on June 6 against the Detroit Tigers, pitching innings and giving up 3 runs in the Mariners&#x27; 6–3 victory.

Seattle, however, was desperate for immediate bullpen help, and packaged Lowe and catcher Jason Varitek into a deal with the Boston Red Sox for Heathcliff Slocumb. The trade on July 31 by Mariners&#x27; vice president Woody Woodward is considered one of the most lopsided in MLB history.

===Boston Red Sox===
Lowe compiled a 5–15 record over his first two seasons, during which he split time starting and relieving, but came into his own in 1999 after being transferred into the closer&#x27;s role, finishing the season with 15 saves and a 2.63 ERA.

Lowe had his best season as a closer in 2000 when he led the American League with 42 saves, to go along with a 2.56 ERA. Despite recording 24 saves early in the 2001 season, Lowe lost the closer&#x27;s job soon after the trading deadline when the Red Sox acquired Ugueth Urbina. Lowe was left in limbo, demoted to various setup jobs in the bullpen. Instead he asked manager Joe Kerrigan to return him to the starting rotation; Kerrigan agreed, and Lowe pitched 16 innings as a starter before the end of the season. The following year, 2002, was Lowe&#x27;s coming out party as a starter, as he posted a 21–8 record to go with a 2.58 ERA, finishing third in Cy Young Award voting behind Barry Zito and Lowe&#x27;s teammate Pedro Martínez. Lowe no-hit the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at Fenway Park on April 27 that year, becoming the first pitcher to do so at Fenway Park since Dave Morehead in 1965. Lowe faced just one over the minimum in the game; only a third inning walk to Brent Abernathy separated Lowe from a perfect game. Additionally, Lowe was the starting pitcher for the American League in the All-Star Game that year.

Lowe posted a 17–7 record despite a 4.47 ERA in 2003. He recorded an improbable save in deciding Game 5 of the 2003 American League Division Series, helped by two clutch strikeouts.

In 2004, he finished 14–12 with a 5.42 ERA in 33 starts. During the postseason he rebounded with a 3–0 record and 1.86 ERA in four games, three of them starts. He was the winner in the final game of all three postseason series—American League Division Series against the Anaheim Angels (pitching in relief), the American League Championship Series against the New York Yankees, and the World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals (where he threw shutout ball for 7 innings in Game 4, to defeat Jason Marquis) — as the Red Sox won their first World Series in 86 years.

On January 11, 2005, Lowe finalized a $36 million, four-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Despite his signing with a new team, Lowe wore a Red Sox uniform, with his career-long number of 32, during the Red Sox World Series ring ceremony on April 11, 2005, after already making a start for the Dodgers.

On August 31, 2005, Lowe pitched an unusual one-hitter. After giving up a leadoff single to the Cubs&#x27; Jerry Hairston Jr., Lowe did not allow another Chicago hit, picking up a one-hit, two-walk, 7–0 complete game victory while facing only 29 batters.

For the 2008 season, after being the opening day starter for the Dodgers for the last three years, he was moved to the second starting position, behind Brad Penny. Lowe was chosen by manager Joe Torre to start Game 1 of the National League Championship series against the Philadelphia Phillies on October 9, 2008. Lowe opened the game with five scoreless innings.

All-time pitching great Greg Maddux had a storied 23 year major league career, during which he was twice traded during a season - both times to the Dodgers, once in 2006, the other in his final season of 2008. Each time Maddux joined the Dodgers, Lowe performed visibly better afterwards. Lowe indicated that Maddux helped him considerably; Maddux was often seen sitting next to him in the dugout, as Lowe was able to learn from the master hurler.

===Atlanta Braves===
Lowe agreed to a four-year, $60 million deal with the Atlanta Braves during the 2008–09 offseason. Manager Bobby Cox announced that Lowe would start both Opening Day and the Braves home opener for the 2009 season. Lowe beat the Phillies 4–1 on Opening Night, going 8 innings and giving up just 2 hits and 0 runs.

In 2010, Lowe was one of only two active players, along with Liván Hernández, to have played 12 or more seasons without going on the disabled list.

Despite having a mediocre season until August, Lowe was exceptional in September 2010, with a 5–0 record, a 1.77 ERA, 29 strikeouts while walking only three batters, which helped the Braves secure a playoff berth as the NL Wild Card, being one game ahead of the second place Padres at the end of the regular season. For this, Lowe was named National League Pitcher of the Month.

On August 31, 2011, Lowe hit his first home run (in 425 at-bats) off John Lannan of the Washington Nationals.

===Cleveland Indians===

Following the 2011 season, the Braves traded Lowe to the Cleveland Indians for minor league left-handed relief pitcher Chris Jones. The Braves paid $10 million of Lowe&#x27;s $15 million salary for the 2012 season. On May 15, 2012 in a road game versus the Minnesota Twins, Lowe recorded his first shutout in seven years and also pitched a complete game in a 5–0 Tribe win, improving his season pitching record to 6–1. Lowe did not record a strikeout in the shutout, becoming the first pitcher to do so since 2002.

The Indians designated Lowe for assignment on August 1 to make room for Corey Kluber. Lowe was 8–10 with a 5.52 ERA in 21 starts and 119 innings pitched. The Indians released Lowe on August 10.

===New York Yankees===

On August 12, 2012, Lowe signed with the New York Yankees. In his Yankees debut on August 13, he pitched four scoreless innings in relief, recording his first regular season save since 2001. Lowe had a 3.04 ERA in 17 appearances, earning him a spot on the team&#x27;s postseason roster. The Yankees defeated the Baltimore Orioles in the 2012 ALDS, but lost to the Detroit Tigers in the 2012 ALCS. Lowe became a free agent after the 2012 season ended.

===Texas Rangers===
On March 6, 2013, Lowe signed a minor league contract with the Texas Rangers. He made the team&#x27;s major league roster, and was with the Rangers on opening day. He was designated for assignment on May 20, 2013.

On June 9, 2013, sports journalist Nick Cafardo reported that Lowe appeared to have retired. According to Cafardo, Lowe told his agent, Scott Boras, not to approach any teams to gauge their interest.

Lowe officially announced his retirement July 18, 2013.

Lowe was eligible to be elected into the Hall of Fame in 2019, but received less than 5% of the vote, thus dropping off of future ballots.

==Scouting report==
Lowe was a sinkerball pitcher, throwing the pitch over 60% of the time. He also threw a fastball, curveball and a slider.

==Personal life==
Lowe has advocated for various causes to fight cancer. Himself a survivor of squamous cell carcinoma, Lowe has worked with the Melanoma Foundation of New England, the National Council on Skin Cancer Prevention, and The Prostate Cancer Foundation. Lowe was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder and received permission to treat it with Adderall, a substance normally banned by Major League Baseball, but with exceptions allowed on a case-by-case basis.

Lowe was charged with fourth-degree domestic violence by King County police in 1997 after his girlfriend claimed that he struck her. Lowe was released on $1,000 bond the next day, whereupon he allegedly violated a no-contact order by returning to her home shortly thereafter. Lowe entered counseling as a result.

Carolyn Hughes, who covered the Dodgers for Fox Sports West, was suspended pending an investigation into a potential relationship between her and Lowe during his tenure with the Dodgers. Shortly thereafter, Lowe filed for divorce from Trinka Lowe, his wife of seven years, with whom he had fathered three children. Hughes&#x27;s husband also filed for divorce. In the aftermath, Hughes ended her broadcasting career, and she and Lowe continued their relationship. They were married on December 13, 2008 at The Henry Ford in Dearborn, Michigan.

On April 28, 2011, Lowe was arrested and charged with driving under the influence, reckless driving and improper lane change after he was spotted drag racing down an Atlanta street. The trooper who stopped him detected an odor of alcohol and administered a field sobriety test, which resulted in Lowe&#x27;s arrest. Lowe declined to take a breath test before he was released after posting bail. The driver of the other vehicle was not charged with any offense and was released. On May 26, 2011, both the DUI charge and the reckless driving charge were dismissed by City of Atlanta Solicitor-General Raines Carter, and Lowe entered a nolo contendere (no contest) plea to violating basic motor vehicle rules.

Lowe finished second to Mark Mulder in the July 2017 American Century Championships celebrity golf tournament.

Lowe won the January 2022 LPGA Tournament of Champions Celebrity Division tournament, defeating Annika Sörenstam in a playoff after both scored 138 points.

<doc id="394312" wikidata="Q57136" url="?curid=394312" title="Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk">
<text>Johann Ludwig &quot;Lutz&quot; Graf Schwerin von Krosigk (Born Johann Ludwig von Krosigk; 22 August 18874 March 1977) was a German senior government official who served as the minister of finance of Germany from 1932 to 1945 and &quot;de facto&quot; chancellor of Germany during May 1945.

A non-partisan conservative, he was appointed to the post of Minister of Finance by Franz von Papen in 1932. At the request of President Paul von Hindenburg, he continued in that office under Kurt von Schleicher and Adolf Hitler. He and his ministry were involved in the persecution of German and European Jews, including by stealing their property, and laundering money. During May 1945, after the suicides of Hitler and his designated successor Joseph Goebbels, he also served as &quot;Leading Minister&quot; of the short-lived Flensburg Government of President Karl Dönitz. Schwerin von Krosigk also held the essentially nominal offices of Foreign Minister and Finance Minister in the provisional government that controlled only a small, progressively shrinking portion of Germany, due to the rapid advance of the Allied forces who finally dissolved it and arrested its members.

Besides Adolf Hitler himself, Schwerin von Krosigk was one of the few members of Hitler&#x27;s cabinet (along with Wilhelm Frick and Franz Seldte) to serve continuously from Hitler&#x27;s appointment as Chancellor until his death. By accepting the Golden Party Badge personally bestowed by Adolf Hitler, given for honour on 30 January 1937, he automatically became a member of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) with membership number 3,805,231. He also joined the Academy for German Law in 1937.

At the 1949 Ministries Trial, he was convicted of laundering property stolen from Nazi victims and financing the concentration camps and sentenced to 10 years in prison; his sentence was commuted in 1951. He later worked as an author and publicist. He died on 4 March 1977.

== Early life and education ==
Born as Johann Ludwig von Krosigk on 22 August 1887 into a family of traditional Lutheran Protestants in Rathmannsdorf in the Duchy of Anhalt of the German Empire, his father Erich Adolf Wilhelm was a member of an old noble but untitled family of Anhalt and his mother Luise Rosalie Friederike Julie Emma Ludmilla was born a countess of the Schwerin family. In 1925 he was adopted by Alfred Wilhelm Detlof Graf von Schwerin, and promoted himself to a count, taking the name Johann Ludwig Graf Schwerin von Krosigk.

Krosigk studied law and political science at Halle and Lausanne and then, as a Rhodes Scholar, at Oriel College, Oxford.

During World War I, Krosigk served in the German Army, attaining the rank of Lieutenant, and was awarded the Iron Cross, 1st class. On 7 February 1918, during the war, he married a baroness, Ehrengard Freiin von Plettenberg (1895–1979), with whom he had four sons and five daughters. In 1922, he became an &quot;Oberregierungsrat&quot; (senior government official) and in 1929, a ministerial director and head of the budget department at the finance ministry. In 1931, he joined the department of reparations payments, formed to deal with the reparations Germany still owed the Allied Powers after the Great War.

== Nazi years ==

=== Pre-World War II ===

In 1932 Franz von Papen appointed Krosigk as national Minister of Finance, and at the request of President Paul von Hindenburg he continued in that office under Kurt von Schleicher and throughout the period of Nazi rule. Several members of his family took part in assassination attempts against Adolf Hitler, but not Krosigk himself. He was rarely seen in public, and Hitler did not hold regular cabinet meetings. Following the final meeting of Hitler&#x27;s cabinet in 1938 Krosigk did not make any public political statements and instead focused on running his ministry.

Krosigk held his position under both Schleicher and Hitler as a representative of the conservative movement in Germany. While he later claimed to have remained in the role only to prevent &quot;worse things&quot; from happening, he welcomed the Nazi Party&#x27;s rise to power and both agreed with and contributed to many of its policies. These included measures targeting Germany&#x27;s Jewish community. While Krosigk&#x27;s ability to shape Germany&#x27;s fiscal policies was constrained by the influence of both the President of the Reichsbank and Hermann Göring (in his role as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan), he was able to implement policies. In August 1938 Krosigk sent Hitler a memorandum which strongly argued against starting a war over the Sudeten crisis as the German economy was not yet ready, and claimed that &quot;Communists, Jews and Czechs&quot; were seeking to lure the country into a premature conflict. He argued that Germany should instead &quot;await her hour&quot; and initiate war once it had completed building up its military and economy.

=== World War II ===

From 1939, Krosigk&#x27;s ministry was increasingly focused on persecuting Jews and stealing their belongings as well as illegally laundering money.

In February 1945 von Krosigk stressed the importance of preserving Germany&#x27;s remaining industrial capacities in a letter to Reich Minister of Armaments and War Production Albert Speer. This was motivated by his mistaken belief that the Allied bombing campaign directed at Germany had the goal of destroying the country&#x27;s industry so that it could not be captured by the Soviet Union, and that retaining industrial capacity would position Germany to re-establish friendly relations with the western Allies following the war. It is unclear whether this had any influence of Speer&#x27;s actions to prevent the implementation of the &quot;scorched earth&quot; policy ordered by Hitler. 

In his final testament Hitler selected Krosigk to continue as finance minister after his death. He was to serve in a government headed by Goebbels as Chancellor (&quot;Reichskanzler&quot;). However, Goebbels himself committed suicide only a day later, on 1 May 1945. &quot;Reichspräsident&quot; Karl Dönitz then asked Schwerin von Krosigk to succeed him as Chancellor. He declined but accepted the position of &quot;Leading Minister&quot; the following day. In a broadcast to the German people on 2 May 1945, he became one of the first commentators to refer to an &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; across Europe, a phrase he had picked up from an article by Joseph Goebbels and which was later made famous by Winston Churchill.

Rapidly advancing Allied forces limited the jurisdiction of the new German government to an area around Flensburg near the Danish border, where Dönitz&#x27;s headquarters were located, along with Mürwik. Accordingly, this administration was referred to as the Flensburg government. Dönitz and Schwerin von Krosigk attempted to negotiate an armistice with the Western allies while continuing to resist the Soviet Army. On 7 May 1945, Dönitz authorised the signature of the German Instrument of Surrender to the Allies, which took place in Reims before General Dwight D. Eisenhower; Dönitz would later authorise the Wehrmacht to sign another instrument of surrender in Berlin, in a ceremony presided over by the Soviets. On 23 May 1945, the Flensburg Government was dissolved by order of the Supreme Allied Commander, General Eisenhower, and its members arrested.

==Post-World War II==

Krosigk was put on trial at Nuremberg, along with other leading members of the Nazi government. At the conclusion of the Ministries Trial in 1949 he was found guilty of laundering property stolen from Nazi victims and financing the concentration camps, and sentenced to ten years&#x27; imprisonment. His sentence was reviewed by the &quot;Peck Panel&quot;. He was released during an amnesty in 1951.

In later years, Schwerin von Krosigk wrote several books on economic policy and two versions of his memoirs.

Schwerin von Krosigk died on 4 March 1977 in Essen, West Germany, at the age of 89.

==Private life==
He was married to his cousin, Baroness Ehrengard von Plettenberg-Heeren (1895–1979), daughter of Count Friedrich von Plettenberg-Heeren (1863–1924) and his wife, Countess Ehrengard von Krosigk (1873–1943). They had nine children.

Among them, his daughter, Felicitas-Anita, Countess Schwerin von Krosigk (b. 1941), is the mother of Alternative for Germany Member of the German Bundestag Beatrix von Storch.

His other daughter, Countess Ehrengard Bertha Minetta Schwerin von Krosigk (1922–2012), married Gottfried von Bismarck (1921-2001), younger brother of Klaus von Bismarck, Philipp von Bismarck, brother in law of Gottfried von Einem and uncle of Caspar von Einem, Minister of the Interior of Austria.

<text>The Zire Series was Palm, Inc&#x27;s &quot;consumer-grade&quot; brand of Personal Digital Assistant.

==Background/overview==
The lower-end models emphasized value—Palm&#x27;s original Zire model was the first PDA under $100 from a major manufacturer—and the higher-end models emphasized multimedia capability, including features like cameras and audio playback functions suitable for listening to MP3s.

==Models==
===Palm Zire and Palm Zire 21===

The Palm Zire and Palm Zire 21 were inexpensive and are differentiated from the rest of Palm&#x27;s line by having monochrome screens without backlighting, having only two application buttons instead of the typical four, and traditional up/down scroll buttons instead of the then-standard 5-way navigator found in other models. Both of these entry-level models are lightweight (3.8oz or 108g) and sport a white plastic face with a matte gray plastic back.

The Zire (also known as the m150), released in the fourth quarter of 2002 and is the handheld responsible for starting the value-conscious handheld craze. It sported only 2 MB RAM, a 16 MHz Motorola DragonBall EZ processor, and Palm OS 4.1.x. The Zire was superseded by the Zire 21 at the release of the &quot;First Breed of PIM Plus Handhelds&quot; in the fourth quarter of 2003.

The Zire 21, released at the same time as the Tungsten T3 and Tungsten E, sported an improved PIM suite (then-known as the Palm PIM Plus), a 126 MHz TI OMAP311 ARM-Compliant Processor, 8 MB RAM, and Palm OS 5.2.1.

Neither the Zire nor the Zire 21 had SD/SDIO/MMC expansion, which caused the devices to be shunned by handheld aficionados. As of August 2005, both of these handhelds had been discontinued, making the Palm Zire 31 the entry-level Palm-branded PDA citing a strong demand for color.

The Zire 21 was capable of displaying PDF files using the free Adobe Reader for Palm OS version 3. Like most Palm handhelds, text from the PDF file could be copied and pasted into other applications such as Memo Pad, greatly enhancing the utility of this cheap device. It was capable of, in effect, acting as a portable word processor, albeit a very basic one.

===Palm Zire 31===

The Palm Zire 31 was a budget multimedia-oriented device. While the display was still 160×160, it was now color. The Zire 31 had twice the RAM of the Zire 21 (16 MB, 13.8 MB usable), a 200 MHz Intel XScale PXA255 processor, an SD/SDIO/MMC expansion slot, Palm OS 5.2.8, a 3.5mm stereo headphone jack and a 5-way navigator, though the Zire 31 still retained the two application buttons, as opposed to the standard four on most other models. The ROM included RealOne Player giving the device some digital audio player capabilities and a photo album application. It didn&#x27;t have a direct successor—the newer Palm Z22 was more akin to the Zire 21, albeit having the same 160×160 pixel CSTN 4096-color display as the Zire 31. While Zire 31 had the ability to play video (video player not included), the experience was limited by the maximum SD/MMC card size limit (1 GB, larger cards including SDHC are possible via 3rd party software), the poor screen resolution, color depth and passive matrix display technology.

===Palm Z22===

The Z22 was a successor of Zire 21, but the &quot;Zire&quot; moniker was dropped. Released October 12, 2005, it was available for US$149.95 as of July 2010. It had a CSTN 4096 color 160×160 display and featured 32 MB NVRAM (20 MB available to user) using NVFS, a Samsung 200 MHz processor, and Palm OS Garnet 5.4 operating system. It weighed . Included in the box were cables for syncing with a computer via USB and for charging from a wall outlet, Palm Desktop software for Mac and Windows, and a screen protector.

===Palm Zire 71===
The Palm Zire 71 was Palm&#x27;s first attempt at a PDA with a built-in digital camera. It was introduced on April 23, 2003. At the time of its release, the Zire 71 was the highest-end model in the Zire line, sporting a 144 MHz TI OMAP310 processor, 16 MB of RAM (13 MB usable), 320×320 TFT 16-Bit color screen, Palm OS 5.2.1, and a VGA-quality camera (300K pixel with 640×480 support). It also featured a small joystick for navigation, a departure from both the scroll buttons and 5-way navigator of other models. Audio playback capability was possible with the inclusion of a SD card slot and a Palm version of RealPlayer. To counter the slow file transfer rate for uploading songs to the device, Palm offered an MP3 playback kit that included a memory card writer. Its introduction price was $299, but later was reduced to $249 shortly before it was replaced by the Zire 72. The 71 still had some advantages over the 72, as the camera was constantly protected by a shell on the 71, and it retained the Palm &quot;Universal Connector&quot; that was being phased out.
The Zire 71 did not ship with any wireless capabilities other than its infrared port. Wi-Fi capability could be added to the Zire 71 via the SD slot. Only one Wi-Fi/SD card, SanDisk model SDWSDB-000-A10M, was reported to work with Zire 71. Wireless capabilities could also be added through the use of a folding portfolio, such as the Enfora Wireless LAN Portfolio.

Reviewers were impressed by the excellent quality of its LCD and the comparatively good quality of its camera relative to similar generation VGA digital cameras.

Certain users found issues with the sensitivity of the device&#x27;s joystick, which on certain devices was prone to powering up the PDA inside pockets, bags, and other containers, thus draining the batteries. The recommended utilities for the Palm Zire 71 (and all other Palm-branded PDA users as well) addressing the &quot;in-pocket power-up problem&quot; are
*PocketProtector by &quot;Geakware&quot;;
*Power by &quot;Whizoo&quot;;
*OffAlready by &quot;Toysoft inc&quot;;
*Disable Buttons (freeware) by &quot;Pasquale Foggia&quot;.
Alternatively, one could simply lessen the frequency of this occurring by inserting the PDA into its case top first (so that the joystick is at the wider end of the pocket). Additionally, after many cycles of opening and closing the camera, the flex-cable that connected the halves of the device could fracture. This led to the loss of charging, wired syncing and shutter button functionality as the IO connector and button resided on the back half of the device.

===Palm Zire 72===
The Palm Zire 72 was the successor to the Palm Zire 71. New features included Bluetooth, voice recording, and video capture with sound. The joystick was replaced with the standard 5-way navigator similar to that of the Tungsten models, and the camera was upgraded from 0.3 to 1.2-megapixels. The Zire 72 had 32 MB of RAM (25 MB usable) instead of 16 MB, a 312 MHz Intel PXA270 Processor instead of the previous TI OMAP Processor, and weighed 4.8oz as opposed to 5.3oz for the Zire 71. This model featured the updated suite of PIM apps, like the E, T3, and Z22 models. The Zire 72 was available in two models. The standard Zire 72 had a bright blue painted body with a silver back. The Zire 72 Special Edition was an all-silver model. 
The Zire 72, while it had more features than the Zire 71, was hit with a lot of criticism over time. Some users reported problems with the camera: the camera lens was not covered, the camera didn&#x27;t work in low-light conditions, and broken pixels were common. (Third-party cases included a lens cover.) The screen quality, while good, was not as brilliant as the Palm Zire 71. Many users complained of the blue &#x27;soft-touch&#x27; rubberized paint coating chipping and peeling after moderate use.

<text>The 2000 Kuala Lumpur al-Qaeda Summit was a meeting of several high-level al-Qaeda members held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia from 5 to 8 January 2000. During this conference, the USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing and September 11 attacks were planned. The CIA and Malaysian government came under fire for failing to identify members of the summit and arrest them before the attacks were successfully carried out.

==The summit==
The three-day-long meeting was held in the hotel room of Yazid Sufaat, a former Malaysian Army captain and businessman, in a hotel in Kuala Lumpur. The attendance consisted of Arab veterans of the Soviet–Afghan War, including Hambali, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Nawaf al-Hazmi, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Tawfiq bin Attash.

Before the meeting, the United States intercepted a telephone call to Yemen by al-Mihdhar concerning arrangements for the trip. Osama bin Laden had called that number dozens of times. By request of the CIA, the Malaysian authorities videotaped the meeting, but no sound recordings were made. The men were also photographed when they came out of the meeting. American investigators did not identify these men until much later. Ramzi bin al-Shibh&#x27;s attendance at the meeting was discovered by the investigators by looking into his credit card records. Sufaat was later arrested, but he denied that he knew any of the men and said that Hambali had arranged the meeting.

<doc id="394326" wikidata="Q3586355" url="?curid=394326" title="2003 New Brunswick general election">
<text>The 2003 New Brunswick general election was held on June 9, 2003, to elect the 55 members of the 55th New Brunswick Legislative Assembly. 

Although early polls suggested a landslide victory for the incumbent Progressive Conservatives of Premier Bernard Lord, the dynamics of the race shifted after Shawn Graham, leader of the Liberal Party, made auto insurance rates a key issue of his campaign. 

Lord and the Progressive Conservatives were ultimately re-elected, but with their majority government reduced to just one seat, finishing only two seats ahead of Graham&#x27;s Liberals. The New Democrats held their sole seat in the legislature.

==Campaign==
Leading up to the election, New Brunswick had its car insurance rates skyrocket. The Liberal Party of New Brunswick consequently focused its campaign on three points:
# improved universal health care, 
# keeping the province&#x27;s electric utility, NB Power, as a public crown corporation, and 
# the lowering of automobile insurance rates.

On the other hand, the campaign of Premier Bernard Lord and his Progressive Conservative Party faced a number of problems, especially after changing its position on the key issue of auto insurance several times during the 30-day campaign.

The results were very close, and for most of election night as the results came in, the winner was unclear. Shawn Graham was even heard to remark on television as the night was drawing to a close that &quot;Up to 5 minutes ago, I thought I was Premier&quot;.

New Democratic Party of New Brunswick leader Elizabeth Weir was the only member of her party to win a seat. The party ran 55 candidates throughout the province.

The newly founded but short-lived New Brunswick Grey Party, a branch of the Grey Party of Canada, also ran 10 candidates, including party leader Jim Webb.

<text>A personal organizer, also known as a datebook, date log, daybook, day planner, personal analog assistant, book planner, year planner, or agenda (from Latin &quot;agenda&quot; – things to do), is a portable book or binder designed for personal management. It typically includes sections such as a diary, calendar, address book, blank paper, checklists, and additional useful information like maps and telephone codes. It is related to the separate desktop stationery items that have one or more of the same functions, such as appointment calendars, rolodexes, notebooks, and almanacs.

== History ==
By the end of the 20th century, paper-and-binder personal organizers started to be replaced by electronic devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs), personal information manager software, and online organizers. This process has accelerated in the beginning of the 21st century with the advent of smartphones, tablet computers, smartwatches and a variety of mobile apps which enhance the potential for personal organisation and productivity.

They were sometimes referred to as a filofax, after the UK-based company Filofax that produces a popular range of personal organiser wallets.

<text>Wadih Elias el-Hage (, &quot;Wadī‘ al-Ḥāj&quot;) (born July 25, 1960) is a Lebanese and naturalized American-French citizen, who is serving life imprisonment in the United States based on conspiracy charges relating to the 1998 United States embassy bombings.

Struggling financially, he decided to move his family to Quetta, Pakistan, but returned to run the Al Kifah Refugee Center in Brooklyn after the death of Mustafa Shalabi. While running the al-Kifah Refugee Center he met some of the extremists involved in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. At the time of their trial, he was in Sudan working as a secretary for Osama Bin Laden. In 1996 and 1997, after Bin Laden left Sudan for Afghanistan, el-Hage worked in Nairobi, Kenya. Under the pretense of doing charity work, he organized the al-Qaeda network that planned and carried out the embassy bombing in Nairobi.

El-Hage was indicted and arrested in 1998, and convicted on all counts and sentenced to life without parole in 2001. His sentence was overturned in 2008 because it was based on federal mandatory sentencing guidelines invalidated by the US Supreme Court in 2005. He was re-sentenced to life without parole in 2013.

==Early life==
El-Hage was born in a Maronite Christian family on 25 July 1960 in Sidon, Lebanon, but grew up in Kuwait, where he converted to Islam. His family was so angered by his conversion that he was forced to leave home and was taken in by a Kuwaiti sheikh who paid for his education, including college. He traveled to the United States for college. From 1978, he studied urban planning at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, then-named the University of Southwestern Louisiana.

During the Soviet–Afghan War el-Hage traveled to Pakistan to work for a Saudi charity, returning to the US in 1985. He married 18 year old April Ray, an American citizen who had recently converted to Islam, gaining American citizenship in 1989. He also hold French citizenship since 1971 through his father who’s lived in France.

El-Hage interrupted his schooling to travel to Afghanistan via Pakistan, although his lifelong physical disability prevented any direct participation in the fighting against the USSR, he instead worked for a Saudi charity called the Muslim World League. He was reportedly under Abdullah Yusuf Azzam, an important figure in the early history of al-Qaeda. El-Hage returned to his university in January 1985, graduating in 1986. He married an 18-year-old American Muslim named April and relocated to Arizona. There he held several low-wage jobs, including city custodian. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1989.

Over the next few years, the el-Hage family traveled repeatedly to Pakistan, initially taking
along his mother-in-law and her husband. In an interview with PBS Frontline, el-Hage&#x27;s mother-in-law said, &quot;I was the matron surgical nurse at an Afghan surgical hospital. Wadih did not actually fight, but acted as an educator. My husband went with Wadih to deliver textbooks and Qur&#x27;ans to the young people. It was a Jihad, a fight for Islam.&quot;

==Background==
At an Islamic conference in Oklahoma in December 1989, el-Hage met Mahmud Abouhalima, who was later convicted for his part in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. El-Hage&#x27;s prosecutors say that Abouhalima told el-Hage to buy a .38 caliber revolver. El Sayyid Nosair used that revolver to kill Rabbi Meir Kahane.

At some later point, el-Hage moved with his family to Arlington, Texas. He was called to the Brooklyn charity Alkifah Refugee Center, by the group&#x27;s office in Tucson, via el-Hage&#x27;s mosque in Arlington. Family members acknowledge that he was in contact with the Alkifah group, and say that he was called in to mediate a dispute. A week later, the group&#x27;s leader, Mustafa Shalabi, was found stabbed to death in an apartment that he shared with Abouhalima. This murder is unsolved. El-Hage&#x27;s family said that he cried when he heard that Shalabi was dead.

In January 1992, el-Hage was arrested for writing false checks. In the car with him was Marwan Salama, whose phone records show his contact with the conspirators of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.

Shortly thereafter, el-Hage moved his family to Sudan and worked as a secretary for Osama bin Laden, who operated a network of businesses and charities, some of them fronts, in East Africa at the time. El-Hage often travelled to Europe in this capacity. Prosecutors believe that el-Hage became a key aide to Bin Laden.

In 1994, his wife April convinced el-Hage to leave Sudan and stop working for Bin Laden&#x27;s organization there. As his mother in law said, &quot;April would have none of that. She is Muslim, but she is also American, and she wouldn&#x27;t stand for it.&quot; However, prosecutors believe that el-Hage continued to work for bin Laden&#x27;s organisation in Nairobi, Kenya. In Kenya, he became the director of Help Africa People, a Muslim charity organization, which Kenyan documents say helped control malaria. El-Hage also made money in the jewelry business. Prosecutors say that el-Hage was in contact in Kenya with Abu Ubaidah al-Banshiri, who was al-Qaeda&#x27;s #2 member until his death in 1996. The badly wanted al-Qaeda suspect Fazul Abdullah Mohammed moved in and worked at the house as a secretary. A letter, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, admitted knowing el-Hage in Nairobi and said that el-Hage attended his wedding.

On August 21, 1997, el-Hage&#x27;s home in Nairobi was raided by Nairobi Police and FBI agents who had a search warrant. Wadih was away in Afghanistan during the raid and documents and a computer were taken from the home. His wife and mother said that they were told by the authorities that they should go back to the United States. Two days later, el-Hage was questioned upon his return from Afghanistan and told to leave Kenya. In September 1997, he returned to Arlington with his family; several accounts say that he sold all of his possessions to fund the trip.

==Arrest &amp; trial==

A year after el-Hage returned to America with his family, the U.S. embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and Nairobi, Kenya were attacked with truck bombs on August 7, 1998. Two weeks after the attacks, the FBI interviewed el-Hage and questioned him about his connection to Osama bin Laden. During this interview, el-Hage denied knowing Mohammed Odeh and claimed he didn&#x27;t recognize a picture of him. He also testified before a grand jury investigating the embassy attacks where he claimed to have never known al-Banshiri, Odeh or other associates of bin-Laden. Soon after, he was arrested on charges of perjury and conspiracy to kill American nationals. After a six-month trial, el-Hage was convicted of conspiracies to kill U.S. nationals; to murder U.S. government employees and internationally protected persons; and to destroy buildings and property of the United States as well as multiple counts of perjury. On October 18, 2001, he was sentenced to life in prison.

In 2008, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed his sentence, citing a 2005 U.S. Supreme Court case that struck down the mandatory application of federal sentencing guidelines used in his case. His resentencing was scheduled for 2009, but his defense asked that the date be pushed back. In April 2013, he was sentenced to life in prison and additionally ordered to pay $33.8 million in restitution. He is incarcerated at Florence ADMAX USP; his Bureau of Prisons number is 42393-054.

<doc id="394339" wikidata="Q13341658" url="?curid=394339" title="Siegfried and Walter Günter">
<text>Siegfried Günter (8 December 1899 – 20 June 1969) and Walter Günter (8 December 1899 – 21 September 1937) were German twin brothers and pioneering aircraft designers. Walter was responsible for the world&#x27;s first rocket-powered and turbojet airframes, projects funded by Nazi Germany. Siegfried was the father of the &quot;thrust modulation theory&quot;.

==Early life==
Siegfried and Walter Günter were born on 8 December 1899 in Thuringia. Avid flight enthusiasts, at 16 they had developed their own propeller theories. Both served in the First World War, where they were captured by the British Army and each became a prisoner of war.

The brothers would be educated in mechanical engineering at the Institute of Technology Hannover, specializing in aircraft design and aerodynamics. It was there that Siegfried designed his first aircraft with fellow students Walter Mertens and Werner Meyer-Cassel, the glider H 6. Their talents were first recognised by Paul Bäumer who was impressed by the performance of the H 6 when he saw it being flown at Wasserkuppe. Bäumer offered the brothers, Mertens, and Meyer-Cassel jobs with his company Bäumer Aero in Berlin. There they began designing motor gliders and then increasingly fast sports planes. By 1925 Siegfried had designed first B II &quot;Sausewind&quot; (&quot;Buzzing Wind&quot;) airplane for the Deutscher Rundflug 1925 competition, which featured the first elliptic design based on Prandtl&#x27;s 1918 theory.

==Heinkel Flugzeugwerke==
On 16 January 1931, Ernst Heinkel recruited Siegfried Günter to work for his Heinkel company in Rostock, and Walter joined the company on 31 July 1931, where he was in charge of developing low and high-speed wind tunnels. There they were to design some of the most important and famous designs associated with the company, including the Heinkel He 51, He 70, He 112, He 100, and the He 111. Walter designed the first ever retractable landing gear in Germany for the He 70, an aircraft mainly designed by Siegfried.

Through their introduction of the elliptical wing-planform, their designs set officially recognized speed records. Lufthansa purchased the He 70, nicknaming it the Heinkel-Blitz (&quot;blitz&quot; means &quot;lightning&quot;), and instituted &quot;blitz&quot; air-routes between Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg, and Frankfurt comparable to today&#x27;s travel time for the same routes.

During this time Walter submitted airframe designs for what would become the He 178, an experimental turbojet aircraft, and the experimental He 176 rocket plane, in coordination with Hans von Ohain.

As chief project designer by 1937, Siegfried and his team introduced the He 100D-1 on 25 May 1937.

Siegfried would later contribute to the design of the He 219, as well as other prototypes, including the He 177 and He 162.

==Death of Walter==
Walter was killed in a car accident on 21 September 1937.

==Postwar==
===Soviet Union===
After the Second World War Siegfried worked in Berlin in the car shop of his father-in-law. He approached the Allies offering his expertise, which was refused along with his request for asylum, forcing him to return to the Soviet sector. In 1948 he was taken to the Soviet Union by USSR agents where he worked on Soviet aircraft designs.

===East Germany===
In July 1954 Siegfried returned to East Germany.

===West Germany===
In 1957 Siegfried went to West Germany, where he again joined the Heinkel works. He was involved in the construction of the EWR VJ 101, the world&#x27;s first supersonic V/STOL aircraft, and the V/STOL transport aircraft . Both were experimental designs and never saw serial production.

==Death of Siegfried==
Siegfried died in West Berlin on 20 June 1969.

<doc id="394346" wikidata="Q6020483" url="?curid=394346" title="Lorne Nystrom">
<text>Lorne Edmund Nystrom (born April 26, 1946) is a Canadian politician and was a member of the House of Commons of Canada from 1968 to 1993 and again from 1997 to 2004. He is a member of the New Democratic Party.

==Parliamentary career==
Nystrom was first elected for Yorkton—Melville in 1968. At the age of 22 years and three months, he was the youngest MP in Canadian history, a record he held until Claude-André Lachance was elected at the age of 20 in 1974. He was reelected without serious difficulty until losing to Reform challenger Garry Breitkreuz in 1993.

In 1992, he was appointed to the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada.

He returned to Parliament in 1997 in the riding of Qu&#x27;Appelle, succeeding fellow New Democrat Simon De Jong. Nystrom faced a strong challenge for re-election in the riding, renamed Regina—Qu&#x27;Appelle in 2000, after the Progressive Conservatives unexpectedly failed to nominate a candidate. However, Nystrom managed to eke out a narrow victory over Canadian Alliance challenger Don Leier.

In 2004, Nystrom lost to the Conservative candidate, future House Speaker and Leader of the Official Opposition Andrew Scheer. Scheer won by a margin of 861 votes. The NDP renominated Nystrom to challenge Scheer at the next federal election in 2005; in the 2006 election, he lost again, this time by a larger margin of 2,712 votes.

Nystrom ran for the leadership of the federal NDP three times, placing third in each. In 1975, he finished behind winner Ed Broadbent and runner-up Rosemary Brown. Twenty years later, in 1995, Nystrom ran again but placed behind Svend Robinson and winner Alexa McDonough. His final attempt to win the party&#x27;s leadership was in the 2003 election that ultimately selected Jack Layton; Nystrom finished in third behind Layton and Bill Blaikie.

==Career outside of Parliament==
Nystrom edited a book on practical progressive economics, &quot;Just Making Change: The 100 Percent, Honest to Goodness Truth About our User Unfriendly Financial System and How to Escape It&quot;, published in hardcover in 1999 and paperback in 2000.

As of 2012, Nystrom is a board member of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA). Nystrom has also been involved with Brightenview Development International Inc. as the VP of Government Relations and CEO of Brightenvantage International Business Consulting Inc., a subsidiary of Brightenview.

<text>Pierre Ducasse (born August 18, 1972) is a Canadian politician and New Democratic Party (NDP) activist.

He grew up in Sept-Îles, Quebec, and studied at Université Laval. A party member since age 17, he was appointed interim associate president of the federal party in 2000, and was elected to the post at the NDP convention in Winnipeg in November 2001.

==2003 NDP leadership election==

In January 2003, he became the first francophone Quebecer to run for the federal leadership of the party. Although he placed fifth among the six candidates, his campaign was widely acclaimed for raising the profile of the NDP in Quebec and vice versa. Ken Georgetti, president of the Canadian Labour Congress, endorsed him prior to the first ballot.

Jack Layton, the Quebec-born winner of the leadership election, appointed Ducasse to be the party&#x27;s Quebec lieutenant and official spokesman in Quebec. Ducasse held the post of Quebec lieutenant through two elections until the spring of 2007 when he was replaced by Thomas Mulcair, a former Member of the National Assembly of Quebec and Quebec cabinet minister.

==Federal elections==
Ducasse was the NDP candidate for the riding of Manicouagan three times, first in the federal election of 1997, and then in the 2004 and 2006 federal elections. In 2008, Ducasse was the NDP candidate in the riding of Hull-Aylmer.

In 2004, Ducasse finished third in Manicouagan, in a race won by Gérard Asselin of the Bloc Québécois. In 2006, again in Manicouagan, Ducasse placed fourth, but improved his overall result to 4,657 votes or 12.8%. Ducasse received his best result to date in 2008 in Hull-Aylmer, where he placed third with 10,424 votes, for 19.83% of all votes cast in the riding. Liberal Marcel Proulx won the riding with 19,747 votes, or 37.47%, while Bloc Québécois candidate Raphaël Déry finished in second with 11 635 votes, or 22.07%.

In 2011, when he might have run again in Hull-Aylmer, Ducasse and Nycole Turmel had discussions where he learned Turmel might be interested in running. Ducasse decided not to run &quot;because she is a fantastic person and candidate, and I just had a baby.&quot;

On September 29, 2014 Ducasse declared his intention to seek the federal NDP nomination in Manicouagan a fourth time, challenging incumbent NDP MP Jonathan Genest-Jourdain. He withdrew his candidacy a month later when the party confirmed that the nomination meeting would be held on November 6, 2014, declining Ducasse&#x27;s request that the meeting be delayed to a later date. Ducasse said that scheduled meeting date had not allowed him enough time to recruit support.

==2009 municipal election==
Ducasse ran the 2009 Gatineau municipal election on November 1 of that year. He ran for Gatineau City Council in the Hull–Val-Tétreau District. He lost however, to two-term incumbent Denise Laferrière. The district is centred in Downtown Hull.

==Quebec provincial politics==
Ducasse became the leader of record of the New Democratic Party of Quebec following its re-founding on January 30, 2014. He announced that he would not be a candidate in the leadership election to be held in January 2018.

<doc id="394353" wikidata="Q333003" url="?curid=394353" title="Edward Blake">
<text>Dominick Edward Blake (October 13, 1833 – March 1, 1912), known as Edward Blake, was the second premier of Ontario, from 1871 to 1872 and leader of the Liberal Party of Canada from 1880 to 1887. He is one of three federal permanent Liberal leaders never to become Prime Minister of Canada, the others being Stéphane Dion and the latter&#x27;s immediate successor Michael Ignatieff. He may be said to have served in the national politics of what developed as the affairs of three nationalities: Canadian, British, and Irish. Blake was also the founder, in 1856, of the Canadian law firm now known as Blake, Cassels &amp; Graydon LLP.

==Early years==
Blake was born in 1833, in Adelaide Township, Middlesex County, Upper Canada, the son of William Hume Blake and Catherine Honoria Hume, and was educated at Upper Canada College.

In 1856, after Blake was called to the bar, he entered into partnership with Stephen M. Jarvis in Toronto to practice law. When his brother Samuel Hume Blake joined soon thereafter, the firm became Blake &amp; Blake. Today it is known as Blake, Cassels &amp; Graydon.

As a consequence of the ruling of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in &quot;Long v The Bishop of Cape Town&quot;, Blake offered a legal opinion to Benjamin Cronyn (then Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Huron) on the legality of the convening of a Provincial Synod of the various Dioceses of the Ecclesiastical Province of Canada by Francis Fulford (then Bishop of Montreal and Metropolitan of Canada). He determined that the concurrence of all of the Dioceses of the Ecclesiastical Province would be required prior to the creation of the Provincial Synod, and therefore no such Synod could legally be convened until the entity first existed. This opinion was read into the Minutes of the seventh session of the Synod of the Diocese of Huron which convened in June 1864.

==Political career==
===Canada===
Blake was recruited into active politics by George Brown, elected Member of the Provincial Parliament (Durham West and Bruce South) became leader of the Ontario Liberal Party in 1868 and premier in 1871, but left provincial politics to run in the 1872 federal election, in which he was re-elected. The &quot;dual mandate&quot; rule that allowed a politician to sit simultaneously in a provincial and federal house had been abolished, and Blake chose to abandon his career in provincial politics. He played a major role in exposing the government of Sir John A. Macdonald&#x27;s complicity in the Pacific Scandal forcing the government&#x27;s resignation. Blake was offered the prime ministership, but turned it down due to ill health.

When the Liberals won the subsequent 1874 federal election, Blake joined the cabinet of Prime Minister Alexander Mackenzie and served as Minister of Justice and President of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada.

From 1876 to 1900, he was the chancellor of the University of Toronto.

The Liberals were defeated in the 1878 election, and Blake succeeded Mackenzie as party leader in 1880. He failed to defeat Macdonald&#x27;s Conservatives in the 1882 or 1887 elections. Blake resigned as Liberal leader in 1887, recruiting Wilfrid Laurier as his successor, and left the House of Commons of Canada in 1891.

===Ireland===
In the 1892 election, Blake entered the British House of Commons as an Irish Nationalist Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of South Longford in the midlands of Ireland. In 1895, he was appointed to the Royal Commission on the Financial Relations between Great Britain and Ireland, which reported in 1896.

Laurier sought several times for Blake&#x27;s return to Canada by offering him nominations for the Supreme Court and other judicial appointments. However, Blake felt committed to his new role and was particularly committed to home rule in Ireland. His idea of an Irish nation state within a federal empire met with little support.

In May 1907 he suffered a stroke and was partially paralyzed on the left side of his body. He left the British House of Commons in August 1907 upon his appointment as the Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds (a sinecure office used to effect resignation) and retired to Canada.

==Contributions to Canadian federalism==
He is perhaps best remembered for the arguments that he made to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in favour of the Provinces in interpreting the &quot;British North America Act&quot;. In 1888, he argued the case of &quot;St. Catharines Milling v. The Queen&quot; in which the federal government was claiming the right to issue timber licenses. This speech was quoted in its entirety in the 1960 report of the Quebec Royal Commission of Inquiry on Constitutional Problems, which influenced many Quebecers, including René Lévesque:

He won the case, and the Privy Council consistently afterwards took the side of the provinces.

==Family==

Edward Blake married Margaret Cronyn, the daughter of Benjamin Cronyn and Margaret Ann (Bickerstaff), in 1856. She was born in 1835 and was educated at London, Ontario and in Toronto. Mrs. Blake practiced benevolent and other useful work. She was a member of the Toronto Ladies&#x27; Educational Association and served as the Honorary President of the Canadian Branch of the McAll Association in Toronto. She also frequently accompanied her husband on his political tours. The couple had seven children, four of whom survived them. Their daughter Sophia Hume Blake married George M. Wrong and was the mother of Hume Wrong.

== Archives ==
The personal and family papers of Edward Blake can be found at the Archives of Ontario, and the majority of these records were received on indefinite loan from the University of Toronto Library in June 1952. There are also Edward Blake archives at the University of Toronto and Library and Archives Canada.

<doc id="394354" wikidata="Q1137750" url="?curid=394354" title="Magnox">
<text>Magnox is a type of nuclear power / production reactor that was designed to run on natural uranium with graphite as the moderator and carbon dioxide gas as the heat exchange coolant. It belongs to the wider class of gas-cooled reactors. The name comes from the magnesium-aluminium alloy (called magnesium non-oxidising), used to clad the fuel rods inside the reactor. Like most other generation I nuclear reactors, the magnox was designed with the dual purpose of producing electrical power and plutonium-239 for the nascent nuclear weapons programme in Britain. The name refers specifically to the United Kingdom design but is sometimes used generically to refer to any similar reactor.

As with other plutonium-producing reactors, conserving neutrons is a key element of the design. In magnox, the neutrons are moderated in large blocks of graphite. The efficiency of graphite as a moderator allows the magnox to run using natural uranium fuel, in contrast with the more common commercial light-water reactor which requires slightly enriched uranium. Graphite oxidizes readily in air, so the core is cooled with CO2, which is then pumped into a heat exchanger to generate steam to drive conventional steam turbine equipment for power production. The core is open on one end, so fuel elements can be added or removed while the reactor is still running.

The dual-use capability of the magnox design led to the UK building up a large stockpile of fuel-grade (reactor-grade) plutonium, with the aid of the B205 reprocessing facility. The low-to-interim burnup feature of the reactor design would become responsible for changes to US regulatory classifications after the US–UK reactor-grade plutonium detonation test of the 1960s. Despite improvements to the design in later decades as electricity generation became the primary operational aim, magnox reactors were never capable of competing with the higher efficiency and higher fuel burnup of pressurised water reactors.

In total, only a few dozen reactors of this type were constructed, most of them in the UK from the 1950s to the 1970s, with very few exported to other countries. The first magnox reactor to come online was Calder Hall (at the Sellafield site) in 1956, frequently regarded as the world&#x27;s first commercial nuclear power station, while the last in Britain to shut down was Reactor 1 in Wylfa (on Anglesey) in 2015. , North Korea remains the only operator to continue using magnox style reactors, at the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center. The magnox design was superseded by the advanced gas-cooled reactor, which is similarly cooled but includes changes to improve its economic performance.

==General description==
===Windscale===

The UK&#x27;s first full-scale nuclear reactor was the Windscale Pile in Sellafield. The pile was designed for the production of plutonium-239 which was bred in multi-week reactions taking place in natural uranium fuel. Under normal conditions, natural uranium does not absorb enough of its own emitted &quot;fast&quot; neutrons to maintain a chain reaction. To improve the fuel&#x27;s sensitivity to neutrons, a neutron moderator is used, in this case highly purified graphite.

The reactors consisted of a huge cube of this material (the &quot;pile&quot;) made up of many smaller blocks and drilled through horizontally to make a large number of &quot;fuel channels&quot;. Uranium fuel was placed in aluminium canisters and pushed into the channels in the front, pushing previous fuel canisters through the channel and out the back of the reactor where they fell into a pool of water. The system was designed to work at low temperatures and power levels and was air-cooled with the help of large fans.

Graphite is flammable and presents a serious safety risk. This was demonstrated on 10 October 1957 when Unit 1 of the now two-unit site caught fire. The reactor burned for three days, and massive contamination was only avoided due to the addition of filtering systems that had previously been derided as unnecessary &quot;follies&quot;.

===Magnox===

As the UK nuclear establishment began to turn its attention to nuclear power, the need for more plutonium for weapons development remained acute. This led to an effort to adapt the basic Windscale design to a power-producing version that would also produce plutonium. In order to be economically useful the plant would have to run at much higher power levels, and in order to efficiently convert that power to electricity, it would have to run at higher temperatures.

At these power levels, the fire risk is amplified and air cooling is no longer appropriate. In the case of the magnox design, this led to the use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as the coolant. There is no facility in the reactor to adjust the gas flow through the individual channels whilst at power, but gas flow was adjusted by using flow gags attached to the support strut which located into the diagrid. These gags were used to increase flow in the centre of the core and to reduce it at the periphery. Principal control over the reaction rate was provided by a number (48 at Chapelcross and Calder Hall) of boron-steel control rods which could be raised and lowered as required in vertical channels.

At higher temperatures, aluminium is no longer structurally sound, which led to the development of the magnox alloy fuel cladding. Unfortunately, magnox is increasingly reactive with increasing temperature, and the use of this material limited the operational gas temperatures to , much lower than desirable for efficient steam generation. This limit also meant that the reactors had to be very large in order to generate any given power level, which was further amplified by the use of gas for cooling, as the low thermal capacity of the fluid required very high flow rates.

The magnox fuel elements consisted of refined uranium enclosed in a loose-fitting magnox shell and then pressurized with helium. The outside of the shell was typically finned in order to improve heat exchange with the CO2. Magnox alloy is reactive with water, which means it cannot be left in a cooling pond after extraction from the reactor for extended periods. In contrast to the Windscale layout, the magnox design used vertical fuel channels. This required the fuel shells to lock together end-to-end, or to sit one on top the other to allow them to be pulled out of the channels from the top.

Like the Windscale designs, the later magnox reactors allowed access to the fuel channels and could be refuelled while operating. This was a key criterion for the design because its use of natural uranium leads to low burnup ratios and the requirement for frequent refuelling. For power use, the fuel canisters were left in the reactor as long as possible, while for plutonium production they were removed earlier. The complicated refuelling equipment proved to be less reliable than the reactor systems, and perhaps not advantageous overall.

The entire reactor assembly was placed in a large pressure vessel. Due to the size of the pile, only the reactor core itself was placed within the steel pressure assembly, which was then surrounded by a concrete confinement building (or &quot;biological shield&quot;). As there was no water in the core, and thus no possibility of a steam explosion, the building was able to tightly wrap the pressure vessel, which helped reduce construction costs. In order to keep the size of the confinement building down, the early magnox designs placed the heat exchanger for the CO2 gas outside the dome, connected through piping. Although there were strengths with this approach in that maintenance and access was generally more straightforward, the major weakness was the radiation &#x27;shine&#x27; emitted particularly from the unshielded top duct.

The magnox design was an evolution and never truly finalised, and later units differ considerably from earlier ones. As neutron fluxes increased in order to improve power densities problems with neutron embrittlement were encountered, particularly at low temperatures. Later units at Oldbury and Wylfa replaced the steel pressure vessels with prestressed concrete versions which also contained the heat exchangers and steam plant. Working pressure varies from 6.9 to 19.35bar for the steel vessels, and 24.8 and 27bar for the two concrete designs.

No British construction company at the time was large enough to build all the power stations, so various competing consortiums were involved, adding to the differences between the stations; for example, nearly every power station used a different design of magnox fuel element. Most of the magnox builds suffered time overruns and cost escalation.

For the initial start up of the reactor neutron sources were located within the core to provide sufficient neutrons to initiate the nuclear reaction. Other aspects of the design included the use of flux shaping or flattening bars or controls rods to even out (to some extent) the neutron flux density across the core. If not used, the flux in the centre would be very high relative to the outer areas leading to excessive central temperatures and lower power output limited by the temperature of the central areas. Each fuel channel would have several elements stacked one upon another to form a &quot;stringer&quot;. This required the presence of a latching mechanism to allow the stack to be withdrawn and handled. This caused some problems as the Nimonic springs used contained cobalt, which became irradiated giving high gamma level when removed from the reactor. Additionally, thermocouples were attached to some elements and needed to be removed on fuel discharge from the reactor.

===AGR===

The dual-use nature of the magnox design leads to design compromises that limit its economic performance. As the magnox design was being rolled out, work was already underway on the advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGR) with the explicit intention of making the system more economical. Primary among the changes was the decision to run the reactor at much higher temperatures, about , which would greatly improve the efficiency when running the power-extracting steam turbines. This was too hot for the magnox alloy, and the AGR originally intended to use a new beryllium-based cladding, but this proved too brittle. This was replaced by a stainless steel cladding, but this absorbed enough neutrons to affect criticality, and in turn required the design to operate on slightly enriched uranium rather than the magnox&#x27;s natural uranium, driving up fuel costs. Ultimately the economics of the system proved little better than Magnox. Former Treasury Economic Advisor, David Henderson, described the AGR programme as one of the two most costly British government-sponsored project errors, alongside Concorde.

==Economics==

The first magnox reactors at Calder Hall were designed principally to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons. The production of plutonium from uranium by irradiation in a pile generates large quantities of heat which must be disposed of, and so generating steam from this heat, which could be used in a turbine to generate electricity, or as process heat in the nearby Windscale works, was seen as a kind of free by-product of an essential process.

The Calder Hall reactors had low efficiency by today&#x27;s standards, only 18.8%.

The British government decided in 1957 that electricity generation by nuclear power would be promoted, and that there would be a building programme to achieve 5,000 to 6,000MWe capacity by 1965, a quarter of UK&#x27;s generating needs. Although Sir John Cockcroft had advised the government that electricity generated by nuclear power would be more expensive than that from coal, the government decided that nuclear power stations as alternatives to coal-fired power stations would be useful to reduce the bargaining power of the coal miners&#x27; unions, and so decided to go ahead. In 1960 a government white paper scaled back the building programme to 3,000MWe, acknowledging that coal generation was 25% cheaper. A government statement to the House of Commons in 1963 stated that nuclear generation was more than twice as expensive as coal. The &quot;plutonium credit&quot; which assigned a value to the plutonium produced was used to improve the economic case, although the operators of the power stations were never paid this credit.

Once removed from the reactor, the used fuel elements are stored in cooling ponds (with the exception of Wylfa which has dry stores in a carbon dioxide atmosphere) where the decay heat is transferred to the pond water, and then removed by the pond water circulation, cooling and filtration system. The fact that fuel elements can only be stored for a limited period in water before the magnox cladding deteriorates, and must therefore inevitably be reprocessed, added to the costs of the magnox programme.

Later reviews criticised the continuing development project by project instead of standardisation on the most economical design, and for persisting with the development of a reactor which achieved only two export orders.

A retrospective evaluation of costs, using a low 5% discount rate on capital, estimated magnox electricity costs were nearly 50% higher than coal power stations would have provided.

==Safety==

The magnox reactors were considered at the time to have a considerable degree of inherent safety because of their simple design, low power density, and gas coolant. Because of this they were not provided with secondary containment features. A safety design principle at the time was that of the &quot;maximum credible accident&quot;, and the assumption was made that if the plant were designed to withstand that, then all other lesser but similar events would be encompassed. Loss of coolant accidents (at least those considered in the design) would not cause large-scale fuel failure as the Magnox cladding would retain the bulk of the radioactive material, assuming the reactor was rapidly shutdown (a SCRAM), because the decay heat could be removed by natural circulation of air. As the coolant is already a gas, explosive pressure buildup from boiling is not a risk, as happened in the catastrophic steam explosion at the Chernobyl accident. Failure of the reactor shutdown system to rapidly shut down the reactor, or failure of natural circulation, was not considered in the design. In 1967 Chapelcross experienced a fuel melt due to restricted gas flow in an individual channel and, although this was dealt with by the station crew without major incident, this event had not been designed or planned for, and the radioactivity released was greater than anticipated during the station design.

Despite the belief in their inherently safe design, it was decided that the magnox stations would not be built in heavily populated areas. The positioning constraint decided upon was that any 10-degree sector would have a population less than 500 within , 10,000 within and 100,000 within . In addition population around the site in all directions would be less than six times the 10-degree limits. Planning permission constraints would be used to prevent any large growth of population within five miles.

In the older steel pressure vessel design, boilers and gas ducting are outside the concrete biological shield. Consequently, this design emits a significant amount of direct gamma and neutron radiation, termed &quot;direct shine&quot;, from the reactors. For example, the most exposed members of the public living near Dungeness magnox reactor in 2002 received 0.56mSv, over half the International Commission on Radiological Protection recommended maximum radiation dose limit for the public, from &quot;direct shine&quot; alone. The doses from the Oldbury and Wylfa reactors, which have concrete pressure vessels which encapsulate the complete gas circuit, are much lower.

==Reactors built==

In all, 11 power stations totalling 26 units were built in the United Kingdom where the design originated. In addition, one was exported to Tōkai in Japan and another to Latina in Italy. North Korea also developed their own magnox reactors, based on the UK design which was made public at an Atoms for Peace conference.

The first magnox power station, Calder Hall, was the world&#x27;s first nuclear power station to generate electrical power on an industrial scale (a power station in Obninsk, Russia started supplying the grid in very small non-commercial quantities on 1 December 1954). The first connection to the grid was on 27 August 1956, and the plant was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 17 October 1956. When the station closed on 31 March 2003, the first reactor had been in use for nearly 47 years.

The first two stations (Calder Hall and Chapelcross) were originally owned by the UKAEA and primarily used in their early life to produce weapons-grade plutonium, with two fuel loads per year. From 1964 they were mainly used on commercial fuel cycles and in April 1995 the UK Government announced that all production of plutonium for weapons purposes had ceased.

The later and larger units were owned by the CEGB and operated on commercial fuel cycles. However Hinkley Point A and two other stations were modified so that weapons-grade plutonium could be extracted for military purposes should the need arise.

===Derating to reduce corrosion===
In early operation it was found that there was significant oxidation of mild steel components by the high temperature carbon dioxide coolant, requiring a reduction in operating temperature and power output. For example, the Latina reactor was derated in 1969 by 24%, from 210MWe to 160MWe, by the reduction of operating temperature from .

=== Last operating magnox reactor ===
The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) announced on 30 December 2015 that Wylfa Unit 1 – the world&#x27;s last operating Magnox reactor – was closed. The unit had generated electricity for five years longer than originally planned. Two units at Wylfa were both scheduled to shut down at the end of 2012, but the NDA decided to shut down Unit 2 in April 2012 so that Unit 1 could continue operating in order to fully utilize existing stocks of fuel, which was no longer being manufactured. 

The small 5MWe experimental reactor, based on the magnox design, at Yongbyon in North Korea, continues to operate .

==Magnox definitions==

===Magnox alloy===

Magnox is also the name of an alloy—mainly of magnesium with small amounts of aluminium and other metals—used in cladding unenriched uranium metal fuel with a non-oxidising covering to contain fission products. Magnox is short for magnesium non-oxidising. This material has the advantage of a low neutron capture cross-section, but has two major disadvantages:
*It limits the maximum temperature, and hence the thermal efficiency, of the plant.
*It reacts with water, preventing long-term storage of spent fuel under water.

Magnox fuel incorporated cooling fins to provide maximum heat transfer despite low operating temperatures, making it expensive to produce. While the use of uranium metal rather than oxide made reprocessing more straightforward and therefore cheaper, the need to reprocess fuel a short time after removal from the reactor meant that the fission product hazard was severe. Expensive remote handling facilities were required to address this danger.

===Magnox plants===
The term magnox may also loosely refer to:
*Three North Korean reactors, all based on the declassified blueprints of the Calder Hall magnox reactors:
**A small 5 MWe experimental reactor at Yongbyon, operated from 1986 to 1994, and restarted in 2003. Plutonium from this reactor&#x27;s spent fuel has been used in the North Korea nuclear weapons program.
**A 50 MWe reactor, also at Yongbyon, whose construction commenced in 1985 but was never finished in accord with the 1994 U.S.-North Korea Agreed Framework.
**A 200 MWe reactor at Taechon, construction of which also halted in 1994.
*Nine UNGG power reactors built in France, all now shut down. These were carbon dioxide-cooled, graphite reactors with natural uranium metal fuel, very similar in design and purpose to the British magnox reactors except that the fuel cladding was magnesium-zirconium alloy and that the bars were disposed horizontally (instead of vertically for magnox).

==Decommissioning==

The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) is responsible for the decommissioning of the UK magnox power plants, at an estimated cost of £12.6billion. There has been debate about whether a 25 or 100-year decommissioning strategy should be adopted. After 80years short-lifetime radioactive material in the defuelled core would have decayed to the point that human access to the reactor structure would be possible, easing dismantling work. A shorter decommissioning strategy would require a robotic core dismantling technique. The current approximately 100-year decommissioning plan is called Safestore. A 130-year Deferred Safestore Strategy was also considered, with an estimated cost saving of £1.4 billion, but not selected.

In addition the Sellafield site which, amongst other activities, reprocessed spent magnox fuel, has an estimated decommissioning cost of £31.5billion. Magnox fuel was produced at Springfields near Preston; estimated decommissioning cost is £371million. The total cost of decommissioning magnox activities is likely to exceed £20billion, averaging about £2billion per productive reactor site.

Calder Hall was opened in 1956 as the world&#x27;s first commercial nuclear power station, and is a significant part of the UK&#x27;s industrial heritage. The NDA is considering whether to preserve Calder Hall reactor 1 as a museum site.

All the UK&#x27;s magnox reactor sites (apart from Calder Hall) are operated by Magnox Ltd, a subsidiary of the NDA.

Reactor Sites Management Company (RSMC), a NDA Site Licence Company (SLC), originally held the contract to manage Magnox Ltd on behalf of the NDA. In 2007, RSMC was acquired by American nuclear fuel cycle service provider EnergySolutions from British Nuclear Fuels.

On 1 October 2008, Magnox Electric Ltd separated into two nuclear licensed companies, Magnox North Ltd and Magnox South Ltd.

Magnox North sites 
* Chapelcross
* Hunterston A
* Oldbury
* Trawsfynydd
* Wylfa

Magnox South sites
* Berkeley
* Bradwell
* Dungeness A
* Hinkley Point A

In January 2011 Magnox North Ltd and Magnox South Ltd recombined as Magnox Ltd. Following procurement and management issues with the contract, Magnox Ltd will become a subsidiary of the NDA in September 2019.

<doc id="394356" wikidata="Q1039013" url="?curid=394356" title="Kazuo Matsui">
<text>is a Japanese former professional baseball player who played as a shortstop and is a former manager of the Saitama Seibu Lions. He is a switch-hitter.

Matsui signed with the New York Mets on December 17, 2003, becoming the first Japanese infielder to sign with a Major League Baseball team.

==Early life==
He graduated from the PL Academy Senior High School in Osaka, a school nationally renowned for its baseball program. The only appearance Matsui made at the National High School Baseball Championship Tournament was in his second year at PL Academy. Though Matsui was considered to be the PL Academy&#x27;s ace starting pitcher, injuries limited him to playing only in the quarter-final game, where he allowed two runs during 2 innings.

==Professional career==
===Seibu Lions===
Matsui was chosen third overall by the Seibu Lions of Nippon Professional Baseball&#x27;s Pacific League in the 1994 Japanese League Draft, where he would wear number 32. In 1996, his third season, he became a regular starter as a shortstop and finished the season second in stolen bases (50). Prior to the 1997 season, he would change his number to 7. The 1997 season saw him reach a .300 batting average for the first time and lead the league in stolen bases (62) to help his team win the Pacific League Title. During the 1997 All-Star Game he set a new All-Star Game record by stealing four bases and was chosen the game MVP. Matsui would lead the Pacific League in stolen bases for two more consecutive seasons.

Prior to joining MLB, Matsui would only play for the Seibu Lions, playing there from 1995 to 2003. He enjoyed success as a seven-time Best Nine award winner (1997–2003). One of his best years was 2002, when he had a .332 batting average with 36 home runs, 87 RBI, 193 hits, 119 runs, 46 doubles, 6 triples and 33 stolen bases. He received four Gold Glove awards while in Japan (equivalent of Rawlings Gold Glove Award in MLB) during the 1997, 1998, 2002 and 2003 seasons. He also won a Nippon Professional Baseball MVP award in Japan during the 1998 season. Although Matsui experienced winning the Pacific League Title a total of four times (1994, 1997, 1998, 2002), his team never won the Japanese Series.

===New York Mets===
With the Mets, Matsui hit home runs in his first plate appearance in each of the 2004, 2005, and 2006 seasons. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, he is the only Major League player to hit a home run in his first plate appearance of his first three seasons. The only other player to hit a home run in even his first at-bat of three consecutive seasons was Ken Griffey Jr. In 2004, Matsui homered on the first pitch from Russ Ortiz of the Atlanta Braves leading off the first inning, in 2005, on the sixth pitch from Paul Wilson of the Cincinnati Reds with one out in the first inning, and in 2006, on the fourth pitch from Jake Peavy of the San Diego Padres with no outs in the top of the third. The third home run is notable for being an inside-the-park home run. He slid into home as his former Met teammate Mike Piazza was blocking the plate.

Matsui played 114 games in 2004 (the most games he has played so far in his MLB career). He hit .272 with 125 hits, 32 doubles, 2 triples, 7 home runs, 44 RBI, 65 runs, 14 stolen bases, 5 sacrifice hits, 40 walks and 182 total bases. His hits, doubles, home runs, RBI, walks, and total bases ended up being career highs.

Based on his performance in Japan, Matsui was expected to excel defensively as a shortstop with the Mets. However, in 2004, Matsui committed many errors and misjudgments at the position, and was made the second baseman for 2005. He was also plagued by injuries, which were not a problem for him in Japan. His offensive production was also much lower than anticipated. By mid-2005, he was no longer an everyday player, sharing time at second base with Miguel Cairo and Marlon Anderson. Matsui finished the season batting .255 with three home runs and 24 RBI.

Matsui began the 2006 season by hitting .200 (26-for-130) with 10 runs, six doubles, one home run and seven RBI. The one home run came on an inside-the-park home run against the San Diego Padres on April 20, 2006. Matsui became the first player since 1975 to hit an inside-the-park home run as his first home run of the season.

===Colorado Rockies===
On June 9, 2006, Matsui was traded to the Colorado Rockies for Eli Marrero. Colorado asked Matsui to waive certain clauses in his contract to which he agreed. Once complete, Matsui was sent down to play with the Rockies&#x27; Triple-A affiliate, the Colorado Springs Sky Sox for about two and a half months. Matsui made his Rockies debut against the Milwaukee Brewers on August 23, 2006, starting at shortstop in place of Clint Barmes. Matsui would soon shift to second base. Through 2006 he improved from .200/.235/.269 (AVG/OBP/SLG) in his 130 at bats as a Met, to hitting .345/.392/.504 in 113 at bats as a member of the Rockies.

His stint in New York was punctuated with pronounced booing from Mets fans in response to his failure to validate high expectations gleaned from his (positionally) prodigious Japanese numbers.

Matsui re-signed with the Colorado Rockies for a one-year, $1.5M contract for 2007 and changed his number to 7, a number he wore in Japan.

Matsui&#x27;s performance improved during the 2007 season with the Rockies, as he hit .288, which was higher than his career average. He had career highs in runs (84), triples (6), stolen bases (32) and sacrifice hits (8) in 2007. Matsui was also first in the majors in scoring percentage (47%) when reaching base.

Matsui and the Rockies clinched the 2007 National League wild card game by winning a one-game regular season playoff matchup against the San Diego Padres, propelling Colorado into their second playoff appearance in club history.

Matsui hit his first career grand slam during the second game of the NLDS against the Philadelphia Phillies. It came with the Rockies down 3–2 with two outs in the top of the 4th inning. The grand slam gave the Rockies a lead in which they would never relinquish. Colorado won the game, 10–5. Matsui became only the third player in MLB history to have his first career grand slam occur in the postseason rather than the regular season. He also became the first Japanese player to hit a grand slam in the postseason. Along with the grand slam, Matsui hit a triple and a double during game two of the NLDS, falling a single short of becoming the only player in history to hit a cycle during the postseason. However, Matsui did become only the second player ever (Lou Brock in game four of the 1968 World Series was the first) to hit a double, triple and home run in a postseason game.

===Houston Astros===

On December 1, 2007, Matsui signed a three-year, $16.5-million deal with the Houston Astros.

Prior to Opening Day, Matsui underwent surgery to repair an anal fissure. He missed the first weeks of the season. Matsui made his 2008 debut for the Astros on April 18. He posted a .293 batting average and a .354 on-base percentage with 20 stolen bases on the season.

Matsui still had injury problems but managed to keep the 2nd baseman starting position.
Matsui joined the exclusive list of baseball players with 2,000 hits or more lifetime. He has hit safely over 2,000 times in his Japanese career and in the MLB combined.

In 2009, he led all major league starting second basemen in range factor, at 5.33.

Matsui was released by the Houston Astros on May 19, 2010. In 71 at bats, Matsui managed only a .141 batting average with 1 RBI and 1 stolen base.

===Colorado Rockies===
Following his release he signed a minor league deal with the Colorado Rockies. He remained in the Rockies&#x27; minor league system for the remainder of the season.

===Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles===

After the 2010 season, Matsui signed with the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). 

Matsui would win the 2013 Japan Series with the Eagles organization.

===Saitama Seibu Lions===
On November 17, 2017, Matsui signed with the Saitama Seibu Lions of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB).

On September 27, 2018, he announced his retirement at completion of the season.

==Coaching career==
On October 13, 2022, Matsui was hired as the manager of the Saitama Seibu Lions, filling the role that was left vacant after Hatsuhiko Tsuji stepped down from the position.

==International career==
He was selected to the Japan national baseball team at the 2003 Asian Baseball Championship and 2013 World Baseball Classic.

<text>The terms international waters or transboundary waters apply where any of the following types of bodies of water (or their drainage basins) transcend international boundaries: oceans, large marine ecosystems, enclosed or semi-enclosed regional seas and estuaries, rivers, lakes, groundwater systems (aquifers), and wetlands.

&quot;International waters&quot; is not a defined term in international law. It is an informal term, which sometimes refers to waters beyond the &quot;territorial sea&quot; of any country. In other words, &quot;international waters&quot; is sometimes used as an informal synonym for the more formal term &quot;high seas&quot;, which under the doctrine of &quot;mare liberum&quot; (Latin for &quot;freedom of the seas&quot;), do not belong to any state&#x27;s jurisdiction. As such, states have the right to fishing, navigation, overflight, laying cables and pipelines, as well as scientific research.

The Convention on the High Seas, signed in 1958, which has 63 signatories, defined &quot;high seas&quot; to mean &quot;all parts of the sea that are not included in the territorial sea or in the internal waters of a State&quot; and where &quot;no State may validly purport to
subject any part of them to its sovereignty.&quot; The Convention on the High Seas was used as a foundation for the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), signed in 1982, which recognized exclusive economic zones extending from the baseline, where coastal states have sovereign rights to the water column and sea floor as well as the natural resources found there.

The high seas make up 50% of the surface area of the planet and cover over two-thirds of the ocean.

Ships sailing the high seas are generally under the jurisdiction of the flag state (if there is one); however, when a ship is involved in certain criminal acts, such as piracy, any nation can exercise jurisdiction under the doctrine of universal jurisdiction. International waters can be contrasted with internal waters, territorial waters and exclusive economic zones.

UNCLOS also contains, in its part XII, special provisions for the protection of the marine environment, which, in certain cases, allow port States to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction over foreign ships on the high seas if they violate international environmental rules (adopted by the IMO), such as the MARPOL Convention.

== Underground Transboundary Waters ==
When an underground water crosses international boundaries, the term transboundary aquifer applies. The term transboundariness can then be applied, which is a concept, measure and approach first introduced in 2017 when talking about underground transboundary waters. 

The importance of this approach is that the physical properties of aquifers become merely additional variables within the broad spectrum of the transboundary nature of an aquifer: social (population); economic (groundwater efficiency); political (cross-border); existing research or data; water quality and quantity; other issues that drive the agenda (security, trade, immigration, etc.).

The criteria proposed through this approach attempt to encompass and quantify all potential variables that play a role in defining the transboundary nature and multidimensional boundaries of an underground transboundary water.

==International waterways==

Several international treaties have established freedom of navigation on semi-enclosed seas.

* The Copenhagen Convention of 1857 opened access to the Baltic Sea by abolishing the Sound Dues and making the Danish straits an international waterway free to all commercial shipping. Separately, the Royal Ordinance of 1999 regulates the access of foreign warships to Danish waters.
* Several conventions have opened the Bosphorus and Dardanelles to shipping. The latest, the Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Turkish Straits, maintains the straits&#x27; status as an international waterway.

Other international treaties have opened up rivers, which are not traditionally international waterways.

* The Río de la Plata basin, including the rivers Paraná, Uruguay and Paraguay, is legally open for all international commercial ships without restriction, it notably gives sea access to landlocked Paraguay and Bolivia.
* The Danube River is an international waterway so that Germany and Croatia, as well as landlocked Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Serbia and Moldova can have secure access to the Black Sea.

==Disputes over international waters==

Current unresolved disputes over whether particular waters are &quot;International waters&quot; include:
*Arctic Ocean: While Canada, Denmark, Russia and Norway all regard parts of the Arctic seas as &quot;national waters&quot; or &quot;internal waters&quot;, most European Union countries and the United States officially regard the whole region as international waters. The Northwest Passage through the Arctic Archipelago is one of the more prominent examples, with Canada claiming it as internal waters, while the United States and the European Union considers it an international strait.
* Southern Ocean: Australian claim to an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in Antarctica is challenged by Japan.
*Okinotorishima: Japanese claim to an EEZ around Okinotorishima is challenged by China, South Korea, and Taiwan.
*South China Sea: Disputes exist between Brunei, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam.

==International waters agreements==

=== Global agreements ===
* International Freshwater Treaties Database (freshwater only).

<text>Ajit Pramod Kumar Jogi (29 April 1946 29 May 2020) was an Indian politician, who served as the 1st Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh from 2000 to 2003 and a member of the Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly from Marwahi from 2018 to 2020 and from 2001 to 2013. He also served as a member of Lok Sabha from Mahasamund from 2004 to 2008 and from Raigarh from 1998 to 1999 and member of Rajya Sabha from Madhya Pradesh from 1986 to 1998 and district collector of Raipur in Office from 1978 to 1981. He was a member of Indian National Congress till 2016 and the founder of the political party named Janta Congress Chhattisgarh and the 1st President of the party from 2016 till he died in 2020.

== Education ==
Jogi studied Mechanical Engineering at Maulana Azad College of Technology (MACT), Bhopal. He was college topper and hence won the University Gold Medal in 1968. He studied law at the Faculty of Law, University of Delhi. After having worked briefly as a lecturer at the National Institute of Technology, Raipur, he was selected for two of the most coveted civil services of India; the Indian Police Service and the Indian Administrative Service. He was selected for the Indian Police Service aged 22. Two years later he was selected for Indian Administrative Service (IAS). He was posted in his home state, Madhya Pradesh as an IAS officer.

== Personal life ==
He was born on April 29, 1946, at Gaurela in Marwahi district of Chhattisgarh in a Christian Family. He is survived by wife Renu Jogi who is MLA from Kota constituency and son Amit Jogi who is a former MLA. He was a gold medalist in Mechanical Engineering. He began his professional career as a lecturer in one of the engineering colleges of Raipur city. After completion of his IAS training he was deputed at Raipur as District Magistrate. He was chosen by then Chief Minister Prakash Chandra Sethi to be collector for Sidhi district. He later served as the collector of Shahdol, Raipur and Indore districts. He was considered a bright officer in his role as an IAS officer. He grasped the issues quickly which enabled him to guide his political seniors correctly, as he had a good knowledge on rules and regulations. He was known for having good memory. He could quote the sections from acts at appropriate moments. Even his juniors in court work used to emulate his work. In year 2000 his daughter Anusha committed suicide. In year 2004, he met with a car crash while campaigning for the Lok Sabha elections in Mahasamund, which left him paralysed from waist downwards. However he kept himself physically active for close to 16 years and remained active in politics. During his last days he was working on his autobiography.

== Political career ==

In the course of his professional work in Sidhi district, he was introduced to Arjun Singh, a prominent politician from Madhya Pradesh, who later became his mentor in politics. When Arjun Singh became Chief Minister in 1980, he appointed Ajit Jogi as the collector for Raipur and later that of Indore. Ajit Jogi was introduced couple of times by Arjun Singh to Rajiv Gandhi, who was President of Congress Party, who took special interest in him and a guiding factor for him to quit professional service to enter politics. He quit the civil services in 1986 and joined Indian National Congress party. Later he became member of Rajya Sabha aged 40. He was nominated for the second time too for Rajya Sabha in year 1992, during Prime Ministership of Late P. V. Narasimha Rao. However, he rose to prominence after creation of state Chhattisgarh from the state of Madhya Pradesh in November 2000, when he was chosen to be its first Chief Minister. However BJP won the state&#x27;s maiden elections held in December 2003, and Ajit Jogi&#x27;s Congress government was unseated. Though BJP retained power by winning elections in year 2008 and 2013, Ajit Jogi retained his prominence in State Congress party. In 1998, he contested the Lok Sabha elections from Raigarh, a constituency reserve for members of Scheduled Tribe and won. However, he lost the Lok Sabha elections in year 1999 from Shahdol. In year 2000, Chhattisgarh was carved out of Madhya Pradesh, and Sonia Gandhi as President of Congress, chose him as Chief Minister of the newly carved state. Though he did not have political experience which was considered a limitation, his immense experience as Government servant and intelligence made him comfortable in the role and adjust easily. As Chief Minister he had complete grip on state affairs. Ajit Jogi was a unique person who combined politics in administration and administration in politics in his role of governing the state. As the decision making was centralised with him, ministers had little work. His bureaucrats used to take important decisions regarding affairs of the state. However the elections in November 2003 proved disappointing for him. He had an immense popularity in Satnami Community, a powerful Scheduled Caste group in Chhattisgarh. In 2016, he floated the Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (JCC), after appealing to the Congress high command. In 2018, his party tied up with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), for the Assembly elections. He is known to have a new form of politics, one that invoked Chhattisgarh pride and sub-nationalism. Even after near-fatal accident in a car crash in 2004 while campaigning for Lok sabha elections from Mahasamund which made him paralysed from waist downwards, Jogi contested assembly election and won against his ex-party colleague Vidya Charan Shukla from BJP.

===2014 Lok Sabha election campaign===
During the run-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections for the Mahasamund seat, eleven independent candidates filed their nominations in the name of Chandu Lal Sahu. Ajit Jogi was representing Indian National Congress, his main contender was Chandu Lal Sahu from the BJP. Sahu ultimately won the election for the Mahasamund seat but only by small margin of 133 votes and Jogi was accused of creating 11 namesakes similar to his BJP rival, as independents, to confuse voters.

===Janta Congress Chhattisgarh===
The Janta Congress Chhattisgarh political party was founded by Jogi, after he and his son Amit were expelled from the Indian National Congress due to anti-party activities as well as sabotaging Antagarh by-poll elections. Amit was expelled for six years.

Jogi launched a party in Thathapur village of Kawardha district and directly challenged Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh Raman Singh.

In February 2018, Jogi announced that he would contest the election from Rajnandgaon, and after some time he also announced that he would contest the election from Marwahi. On 29 April Jogi gathered more than 72000 people for rally on his birthday.

==Controversies==
In June 2007, Jogi and his son were arrested in connection with the murder of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) treasurer Ram Avtar Jaggi, who was shot dead in June 2003. However, after five years of the registering of a case against him, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) based on an opinion of then Additional Solicitor General of India (ASG) Gopal Subramanian said that Jogi could not be prosecuted under any law. However the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged that the Congress led UPA government misused the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to protect Jogi.

On 6 June 2016, Jogi announced he was breaking his affiliation with Indian National Congress at a political gathering in Chhattisgarh.

In August 2019, a high-level judicial committee dismissed Jogi&#x27;s claim of belonging to a Scheduled Tribe (ST) and cancelled all his caste certificates. Jogi was booked under Indian Penal Code sections 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record). Additionally, Jogi was accused of cheating and forgery in connection with the declaration in a poll affidavit submitted by him during the 2013 Assembly elections. Facing a first information report (FIR) and arrests in the fake caste certificate case, Jogi was admitted to a private hospital in Delhi-NCR after he complained of breathing problem.

==Death==
Jogi died in the afternoon of Friday, 29 May 2020, aged 74. His son, Amit Jogi, confirmed the news on his official Twitter page. Jogi was admitted to hospital after a heart attack, which was caused by a tamarind seed stuck in his throat. Since he was a Christian, he was laid to rest at a cemetery at Jyotipur area in Gaurela town of GPM district in Chhattisgarh.

<text>Heinrich Hertel (13 November 1901 in Düsseldorf – 5 December 1982) was a German aeronautical engineer.

After graduating as an engineer from &quot;Technische Hochschule München&quot; (now Technical University Munich), he joined the Junkers company in 1926. In 1932, he was recruited by Ernst Heinkel and two years later was made the Technical Director of the Heinkel company — within which Siegfried and Walter Günter were already well-established as top engineers — where he oversaw many projects including the Heinkel He 100 and He 111.

In May 1939 he returned to the board of directors at Junkers where he was closely connected with the development of the Junkers Ju 288 and Ju 248.
In February 1945, he also worked on a project of the Dornier Do 635, one of the twin boom fighter aircraft developed from Dornier Do 335 but the project was cancelled in 1945.

After World War II, Hertel worked in France before returning to Germany in 1950 to teach aeronautics in Berlin. From 1959 until his retirement in 1977 he worked as a technical consultant for Focke-Wulf in Bremen.

<doc id="394373" wikidata="Q728933" url="?curid=394373" title="Wangdue Phodrang District">
<text>Wangdue Phodrang District (Dzongkha: དབང་འདུས་ཕོ་བྲང་རྫོང་ཁག་; Wylie: &quot;Dbang-&#x27;dus Pho-brang rdzong-khag&quot;; previously spelled &quot;Wangdi Phodrang&quot;) is a Thromde and dzongkhag (district) of central Bhutan. This is also the name of the dzong (built in 1638) which dominates the district. The name is said to have been given by the Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal who was searching for the best location for a dzong to prevent incursions from the south. The word &quot;wangdue&quot; means unification of Country, and &quot;Phodrang&quot; means Palace in Dzongkha.

Wangdue Phodrang is the largest dzongkhag in Bhutan by area and is bordered by Dagana and Tsirang dzongkhags to the south, Trongsa dzongkhag to the east, Thimphu and Punakha dzongkhag to the west, and Gasa dzongkhag and a small section of border with Tibet to the north. It is listed as a tentative site in Bhutan&#x27;s Tentative List for UNESCO inclusion.

==Wangdue Phodrang Dzong==

An historic dzong built by Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal in 1638 was located at Wangdue Phodrang. The dzong was burnt down by a fire in June 2012. However, as the dzong was being renovated at the time of the fire, most of the historic relics had been put into storage and so were saved from destruction.

==Languages==

The dominant language in Wangdue Phodrang is Dzongkha, the national language, spoken in the western two-thirds of the district. Communities along the border with Bumthang District in the northeast speak Lakha. Along the same border, in central Wangdue Phodrang, inhabitants speak Nyenkha. In southeast Wangdue Phodrang, remnants of the autochthonous &#x27;Olekha (Black Mountain Monpa) speaking community barely survive.

==Transport==

There are three paved roads in Wangdue Phodrang dzongkhag. The Lateral Road enters from the west at Dochu La Pass, crosses the Sankosh (Puna Tsang Chhu) at Wangdue Phodrang dzong, and continues east to Tongsa. One spur road heads north from Wangdue Phodrang to the dzong at Punakha and slightly beyond. This road eventually becomes the trail to Gasa. A second spur departs the Lateral Road near the Pele La pass halfway between Wangdue and Tongsa, traveling south a short distance to Gangteng Monastery and the Phobjika valley where the rare black-necked cranes (&quot;grus nigricollis&quot;) may be found.

==Administrative divisions==
Wangdue Phodrang District is divided into 15 village blocks (or &quot;gewogs&quot;):

*Athang Gewog
*Bjena Gewog
*Daga Gewog
*Dangchu Gewog
*Gangte Gewog
*Gasetsho Gom Gewog
*Gasetsho Om Gewog
*Kazhi Gewog
*Nahi Gewog
*Nyisho Gewog
*Phangyuel Gewog
*Phobji Gewog
*Ruepisa Gewog
*Sephu Gewog
*Thedtsho Gewog
==Environment==
Most of Wangdue Phodrang District is environmentally protected. The northern half of the district (the &quot;gewogs&quot; of Kazhi, Dangchu and Sephu) falls within Wangchuck Centennial Park, with northwestern pockets (the &quot;gewog&quot; of Kazhi) belonging to Jigme Dorji National Park. Southeastern Wangdue (the &quot;gewogs&quot; of Athang and Phobji) is part of Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park. Also protected are the biological corridors crisscrossing the district that connect Bhutan&#x27;s extensive national park system.

The environmentally precious and vulnerable lands of Phobjika Valley are not protected by the government, but are maintained by the first and only Bhutanese private conservation group, the Royal Society for the Protection of Nature (RSPN). Chartered as a public benefit nonprofit organization (PBO), the RSPN focuses on education, sustainable agriculture, ecotourism, and improving living standards in ecologically responsible ways.

<text>The Boys of Summer is a 1972 non-fiction baseball book by Roger Kahn. After recounting his childhood in Brooklyn and his life as a young reporter on the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, the author relates some history of the Brooklyn Dodgers up to their victory in the 1955 World Series. He then tracks the lives of the players over the subsequent years as they aged. The title of the book is taken from a Dylan Thomas poem that describes &quot;the boys of summer in their ruin&quot;.

== Players ==
The players who made up the core of the 1940s and 1950s Brooklyn Dodger teams and who were described by Kahn as the &quot;Boys of Summer&quot; were: Jackie Robinson, Gil Hodges, Roy Campanella, Duke Snider, Pee Wee Reese, Carl Erskine, Clem Labine, Carl Furillo, Joe Black, George Shuba, Andy Pafko, Preacher Roe, and Billy Cox.

Though not covered in the book, pitchers Don Newcombe and Johnny Podres, and outfielder Cal Abrams were also considered a core members of the &quot;Boys of Summer&quot;.

Erskine, who died on April 16, 2024, was the last suviving member of the &quot;Boys of Summer&quot;.

==Reception==
Upon publication in 1972, &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot; was a commercial and critical success. It is often mentioned in discussions of the best baseball books, although some reviewers have criticized it for what they have perceived as excessive sentimentality. 

Christopher Lehmann-Haupt wrote in his &quot;New York Times&quot; review that the book had &quot;very real shortcomings&quot; including &quot;Mr. Kahn&#x27;s unremitting tone of veneration, as if all his memories had been removed from the altars of the world&#x27;s great cathedrals&quot;, but nevertheless found it to be &quot;a book that succeeded for me despite almost everything about it.&quot; 

In contrast to Lehmann-Haupt&#x27;s criticism, Heywood Hale Broun, in his &quot;Chicago Times&quot; review, praised Kahn for vividly re-creating a romantic era in the history of American sports and culture through memories &quot;so keen that those of us old enough can weep, and those who are young can marvel at a world where baseball teams were the center of a love beyond the reach of intellect, and where baseball players were worshipped or hated with a fervor that made bubbles in our blood.&quot; 

George Frazier of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote &quot;I cannot conceive that this year, nor next year, nor the year after that, will produce a more important book – a better written one, a more consistently engrossing one than this portrait of the Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1950s, as they were in the sinew and swiftness of their youth and as they are now.&quot;

Conversely, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; book critic David L. Ulin, while acknowledging that it is &quot;perhaps the most celebrated baseball book of the last 50 years&quot;, omitted it from his own 2011 list of best baseball books, saying in agreement with Lehmann-Haupt that he found it &quot;too sentimental, too sugary, when the Brooklyn Dodgers teams Kahn describes were anything but.&quot;

In the &quot;Los Angeles Times’&quot; first-ever review of &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot;, Robert Kirsch alludes to the timelessness of the themes Kahn takes up through the lens of his own personal experiences, admitting &quot;without embarrassment&quot; that &quot;this book brought me to tears more than once…and to laughter and to that quiet confrontation with enemy Time.&quot;

As of 2015, the book has reportedly sold about 3 million copies in ninety printings. In 2002, a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; panel placed &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot; second on a list of &quot;The Top 100 Sports Books of All Time&quot;, describing it as &quot;a novelistic tale of conflict and change, a tribute, a civic history, a piece of nostalgia and, finally, a tragedy.&quot;

A documentary based on the book, written by Marty Bell and narrated by Sid Caesar, was produced in 1983 and released direct-to-video.

<doc id="394383" wikidata="Q2714697" url="?curid=394383" title="Music for 18 Musicians">
<text>Music for 18 Musicians is a work of minimalist music composed by Steve Reich during 1974–1976. Its world premiere was on April 24, 1976, at The Town Hall in the Midtown Manhattan Theater District. Following this, a recording of the piece was released on the ECM New Series in 1978. The 1998 recording for Nonesuch Records won the Grammy Award for Best Small Ensemble Performance.

== Composition ==
In his introduction to the score, Reich mentions that although the piece is named &quot;Music for 18 Musicians&quot;, it is not necessarily advisable to perform the piece with that few players due to the extensive need for musicians to perform on multiple instruments.

The piece is based on a cycle of eleven chords. A small piece of music is based on each chord, and the piece returns to the original cycle at the end. The sections are named &quot;Pulses&quot;, and Section I–XI. This was Reich&#x27;s first attempt at writing for larger ensembles, and the extension of performers resulted in a growth of psychoacoustic effects, which fascinated Reich, and he noted that he would like to &quot;explore this idea further&quot;. A prominent factor in this work is the augmentation of the harmonies and melodies and the way that they develop this piece. Another important factor in the piece is the use of human breath, used in the clarinets and voices, which help structure and bring a pulse to the piece. The player plays the pulsing note for as long as they can hold it, while each chord is melodically deconstructed by the ensemble, along with augmentation of the notes held. The metallophone (unplugged vibraphone), is used to cue the ensemble to change patterns or sections.

Some sections of the piece have a chiastic ABCDCBA structure, and Reich noted that this one work contained more harmonic movement in the first five minutes than any other work he had previously written.

== Recordings ==

There have been many performances of the piece, and several commercial recordings:
* The original ECM version played by Steve Reich and Musicians (1978)
* The Nonesuch version, played by Reich and musicians along with new musicians, a new recording of which is included on &quot;Steve Reich: Works 1965-1995&quot; (1997/2015)
* The Ensemble Modern version (1999)
* The Amadinda Percussion Group version, a live concert recording (2003)
* The Grand Valley State University New Music Ensemble version (2007)
** This 2007 Innova release, the first recorded in surround sound, has received critical praise, including from Steve Reich.
* The Rough Fields Overdubbed Version (2014), the first recorded by a solo musician with Steve Reich&#x27;s blessing
* The Harmonia Mundi version, played by Ensemble Signal. (2015)
* The Erik Hall solo version (2020)
* The Ensemble LINKS, Rémi Durupt version on KAIROS. (2020)
* Colin Currie Group and Synergy Vocals (2023)
** This 2023 recording is available in Dolby Atmos.

The version on &quot;Works 1965–1995&quot; lasts just over an hour.

The remix album &quot;Reich Remixed&quot; includes an interpretation of &quot;Music for 18 Musicians&quot; by the British duo Coldcut.

==Political career==

===1970–1990: Student leader and youngest MP===

In 1970, Lalu entered in student politics as the general secretary of the Patna University Students&#x27; Union (PUSU), became its president in 1973, joined Jai Prakash Narayan&#x27; Bihar Movement in 1974 where he became sufficiently close to Janata Party (JP) leaders to become the Janta alliance&#x27;s winning candidate in the 1977 Lok Sabha election from Chapra at the age of 29. 

In 1979, the Janata Party government fell due to in-fighting. The parliament was dissolved with new polls held in 1980. Lalu quit Janta party to join the splinter group, Janta Party-S led by Raj Narain, only to lose the re-election in 1980. He managed to win Bihar Legislative Assembly election later in 1980, and again in 1985 to become leader of opposition in Bihar assembly in 1989. Later in 1989, he was also elected for Lok Sabha under V. P. Singh government. By 1990, he positioned himself as the leader of Yadavs (14.26% as of 2023) and lower castes. Muslims, who had traditionally served as Congress (I) vote bank, shifted their support to Laluafter the 1989 Bhagalpur violence. He became popular among the young voters of Bihar.

===1990–1997: Lalu Prasad as Chief Minister of Bihar===
In 1990, Janata Dal came to power in Bihar. PM V. P. Singh wanted former chief minister Ram Sundar Das to lead the government. and Chandra Shekhar backed Raghunath Jha. To break deadlock deputy PM Devi Lal nominated Lalu as CM candidate. He was victorious in an internal poll of Janta Dal MLA&#x27;s and became the chief minister. On 23 September 1990, Lalu arrested L. K. Advani at Samastipur during the latter&#x27;s Ram Rath Yatra to Ayodhya. The World Bank lauded his party for its work in the 1990s on the economic front. In 1993, Lalu adopted a pro-English policy and pushed for the re-introduction of English as a language in school curriculum, contrary to the &quot;angrezi hatao&quot; (banish English) policy of then Uttar Pradesh CM Mulayam Singh Yadav. Policy of opposition to English was considered an anti-elite policy since both the leaders represented the same social constituents – the backward castes, dalits and minority communities. Lalu continued to be Bihar CM.

===1997–2000: Formation of RJD and national politics ===

In 1997, due to allegation related to Fodder Scam, a leadership revolt surfaced in Janta Dal, consequently Lalu broke away from Janta Dal and formed a new political party Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). In 1998 general for 12th Lok Sabha Lalu won from Madhepura, but lost in 1999 general election to Sharad Yadav. In 2000 Bihar Legislative Assembly election he won and remained in opposition.
===2000–2005: Rabri Devi as Chief Minister of Bihar===
In 2002, Lalu was elected in Rajya Sabha where he stayed until 2004. In 2000, RJD again formed the government with Rabri Devi as the CM. Except for brief president rule and 7 days term of Nitish Kumar, RJD remained in power in Bihar until 2005.

===2004–2009: Union Minister of Railway===
In May 2004, Lalu contested the general election from Chhapra and Madhepura against Rajiv Pratap Rudy and Sharad Yadav respectively and won both seats with a good margin. In total, RJD won 21 seats and it allied with Indian National Congress becoming second-largest member of UPA I after Congress. Lalu became the railway minister in the 2004 UPA Government. Later, he gave up the Madhepura seat won by Pappu Yadav.

As railway minister, Lalu left passenger fares untouched and focused on other sources of revenue for the railways. He penalised the use of thermocol plastic cups from being used to serve tea at railway stations and replaced those with &quot;kulhar&quot;s (earthen cups), in order to generate more employment in rural areas which failed miserably due to socio-economic reasons. Later, he also said that he had plans to introduce buttermilk and khādī linen. He also introduced cushion seats in all unreserved compartments. In June 2004, he announced that he would get on the railway himself to inspect its problems and went on to board the train from Patna Railway station at midnight. During this tenure he is accused to have committed 2005 Indian Railway tender scam.

When he took over, the Indian Railways was a loss-making organisation. In the years under his leadership, He claimed a cumulative total profit of . Business schools around the world became interested in Lalu&#x27;s leadership in managing the turnaround. The contrived turnaround was introduced as a case study by the Indian Institute of Management. Lalu also received invitations from eight Ivy League schools for lectures, and addressed over a hundred students from Harvard, Wharton and others in Hindi. 

In 2006, the Harvard Business School and HEC Management School, France, showed interest in turning Lalu&#x27;s contrived experiment with the Indian Railway into case studies for aspiring business graduates.

In 2009, Lalu&#x27;s successor Mamata Banerjee and the opposition parties alleged that the so-called turnaround of the Railways during his tenure was merely a result of presenting financial statements differently. A 2011 report by the CAG endorsed this view. CAG found that the &quot;surplus&quot; shown on the financial statements during Lalu&#x27;s tenure covered &quot;cash and investible surplus&quot;, which were not included in the &quot;net surplus&quot; figures released by the Railways in the earlier years. The &quot;cash surplus&quot; included the money available for paying dividend, contribution to the Depreciation Reserve Fund used for renewal or replacement of existing assets, and other funds for investment. The &quot;investible surplus&quot; included the money allocated for capital expenditure. The report concluded that the performance of the Railways actually declined marginally during the last few years of Lalu&#x27;s tenure.

===2005–2015: Out of power in Bihar and Center===
Bihar Assembly elections were held twice in the year 2005. There was a fractured verdict in the February 2005 Assembly election. Since no government could be formed in Bihar, fresh elections were held in October–November the same year. In October 2005 state elections RJD won 54 seats, less than JD(U) and BJP coalition led by Nitish Kumar which came to power. In the 2010 elections, the RJD tally was reduced to just 22 seats whereas the ruling alliance claimed a record 206 out of the 243 Assembly seats. In the 2009 general election RJD won 4 seats and provided outside support to Manmohan Singh government. In May 2012, Lalu Prasad envisaged Hamid Ansari, previous Vice President, as a presidential candidate. In May 2013, Lalu tried to rejuvenate the party and fuel the party workers in his Parivartan Rally. After the conviction in Fodder Scam on 3 October 2013, Lalu was disqualified from the membership of Lok Sabha. In 2014 general election, Lalu Prasad&#x27;s RJD again won 4 seats.

===2015–current: Grand Alliance ===
In the 2015 Bihar Assembly elections, Lalu Prasad&#x27;s RJD became the largest party with a total of 81 seats. He along with his partner Nitish Kumar of JD(U) had the absolute majority to form a government in Bihar. This was cited as a major comeback for the RJD and for Lalu on the political stage of Bihar after a gap of 10 years. But that suffocating alliance did not last long as Nitish Kumar dumped and ousted Lalu&#x27;s party from the power and alliance in July 2017 after the Enforcement Directorate and Central Bureau of Investigation lodged several criminal cases against Lalu&#x27;s son and Deputy Chief Minister, Tejashwi Yadav.

==Positions held==
Lalu has been elected 4 times as MLA and 5 times as Lok Sabha MP.

Note: 
* 2004: Re-elected to the 14th Lok Sabha (4th term) from Chapra and Madhepura; retained Chapra. Appointed Cabinet Minister in the Ministry of Railways in UPA govt. Lalu, wife Rabri Devi, son Tejashwi Yadav and daughter Misha Bharti booked for railway tender bribery scam, disproportionate illegal property and income tax evasion cases in 2017.
* 2009: Re-elected to the 15th Lok Sabha (5th term). Contested two seats. Lost from Pataliputra but won from Saran, and disqualified in 2013 subsequent to his conviction in the first fodder scam case. And barred from contesting elections for 6 years.

==Populist policies and consolidation of lower castes==

According to Seyed Hossein Zarhani, although Lalu Prasad became a hate figure among Forward Castes, he drew huge support from backward castes and Dalits. He was criticised for neglecting development, but a study conducted during his reign, among downtrodden Musahars revealed that despite the construction of houses for them not being concluded at required pace, they are obliged to choose him as their leader as he returned them their &quot;ijjat&quot; (honour)
and for the first time they are allowed to vote as per their own wishes. A number of populist policies which directly impacted his &quot;Backward Caste&quot; supporters were launched during his tenure. Some of these being establishment of &quot;Charvaha schools&quot;, where children of poor could get skilled; abolishment of cess on toddy and making of the negligence of rules related to reservation for &quot;Backward Castes&quot; as cognizable offence. Lalu Prasad mobilised &#x27;Backwards&#x27; through his identity politics. According to his conception, Forward Castes were elite in the outlook and thus he portrayed himself as, &quot;Messiah of Backwards&quot; by ensuring that his way of living remain identical to his supporters who were mostly poor. He even continued to reside in his quarter of one room after getting elected as Chief Minister, though later he moved to official residence of the CM for administrative convenience.

Another significant event during his regime was the recruitment of &#x27;Backward Castes&#x27; and communities to government services in large numbers. The government&#x27;s white paper claimed to have significant number of vacancies in health sector and similar manpower crunch existed across various sectors. The rules of recruitment were changed drastically in order to benefit &quot;Backward Castes&quot;, who supported him. The frequent transfer of existing officers, who were at the higher echelon of bureaucracy was also an important feature of Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi&#x27;s regime. These developments led to collapse of administration and entire system. Lalu however continued to rule Bihar due to massive support from &quot;Backward Castes&quot; as well as his emphasis on &quot;honour&quot; which he considered more important than the development. Thus according to Zarhani, for the lower caste he was a charismatic leader who was capable to become the voice of those who were silent for long.

Another form of mobilisation of his Dalit supporters by Lalu Prasad was popularising all those folk heroes of lower castes, who were said to have vanquished the upper caste adversaries. One such example is of a popular Dalit saint who was revered as he not only ran away with an upper caste girl but also suppressed all her kins. Praising him could enrage Bhumihar caste in some parts of Bihar. There is a grand celebration every year at a particular place near Patna and Lalu Prasad participates in this fair with pomp and show. His energetic participation in this show makes it a rallying point for Dalits, who saw it as their victory and the harassment of upper castes.

According to Kalyani Shankar, Lalu created a feeling amongst the oppressed that they are real rulers of state under him. He continuously lambasted the oppressors on the behalf of the oppressed and led to their emergence as the pivot of political power. The upper caste, who composed just 13.2% of the population, were controlling most of the land while the &#x27;Backwards&#x27;, who were 51%, own very little land. The advent of Lalu led to a drastic change in the economic profile of the state, followed by the diversification of the occupation of the &#x27;Backwards&#x27; and increase in land owned by them.

Lalu also instilled a sense of confidence among Muslims by stopping Lal Krishna Advani&#x27;s controversial &quot;Rath yatra&quot;. Muslims of Bihar were feeling a sense of insecurity after the ghastly 1989 Bhagalpur riots. The Satyendra Narayan Singh government failed to control law and order situation thus death toll reached over 1000. The people affected were mostly poor weavers and others belonging to low strata of society and hence they were looking for a leader who could control the deteriorating situation of state under Congress. According to Kalyani, during this period upper castes were totally marginalised and &#x27;Backwards&#x27; came to control the power firmly.

===Emergence as the leader of plebeians===
During his tenure, Lalu never tried to emulate the erstwhile elite chief ministers. He took part in the public festivals and popularised his famous &quot;Kurta far Holi&quot; (cloth tearing Holi). On this occasion his invitees and the media persons would reach his house shouting: &quot;Kaha Chhupal hai Lalu Sala&quot; (Where is the bloody Lalu hiding?). Lalu also responded in a similar abusive tone. The vulgar songs were also played on the occasion. Besides this, he never hesitated in calling himself the son of a poor &quot;Goala&quot; (herder). During his public celebration of Holi festival, he used to play the &quot;Dhol&quot; himself and dance to the beat of &quot;Jogira&quot; song. Lalu&#x27;s rallies were called railla, a symbol of masculinity. Those participating in these rallies were supposed to carry a lathi, a robust stick, which was both the symbol of &quot;masculinity&quot; as well as the chief weapon of a &quot;herder&quot;, who used it to manage his cows. The drinking of &quot;Bhang&quot;, a natural liquor and sitting the whole night to watch the &quot;Launda dance&quot; (Dance of a Eunuch acting as a woman) made him popular among rural Biharis but all of these obscene activities of a Chief Minister irritated the middle class sensibilities.
According to Ashwini Kumar:
==Confrontation with bureaucracy and other policies==
With the coming in power of Lalu Prasad, the representation of OBC saw a spurt in the legislative assembly of state. The upper-caste were at great disadvantage due to the new caste composition of the state legislature. In his second tenure, when the elections of 1995 took place in the state, the OBC legislators became 49.69 per cent in the assembly and the upper caste legislators fell to 17.28 per cent, a massive decline since 1960s (In 1995 Bihar Legislative Assembly elections, only 61 upper caste legislators were elected, while the number of Backward Caste legislators was 165). The domination of the Backwards in the legislature brought it into conflict with the bureaucracy, which was still dominated by the upper-castes. There witnessed a hike in incidents of corruption, because the upper-caste bureaucrats utilised the &#x27;lack of knowledge&#x27; in administration of the new legislators (from the OBC background) to stealthily sabotage and subvert constructive policies of the Lalu&#x27;s government.

Since, the administrative class belonged to landed class of upper caste; the Thakur, Bhumihar, Kayastha and Brahmin, they aimed at this obstruction, in order to secure not only their personal interest, but also the interest of the social class, they belonged to. The advent of Lalu Prasad to power was considered as end of their dominance. Hence, amidst confrontation between the bureaucracy and the legislature, the upper-caste dominated bureaucracy became determined to obstruct the caste based social justice promoted by the Janata Dal government under Lalu. They often resorted to frequent defiance of orders to maintain the status-quo. Hence, the government undermined the bureaucracy, as the government, which is said to have voted to power on the platform of OBC empowerment, was also determined to bring the social justice, even at the cost of administrative disfunction.

At the time, the caste composition of judiciary also mirrored the bureaucracy and latter too come into conflict with the government. In the meantime, in the year 1996, a major scandal was witnessed in the state, which involved embezzlement of billions of rupees from the Animal Husbandry Department of state. Initially, the case was to be investigated by Bihar police, which means, government to be in the control of the investigation, but later the judiciary came into play, and the reservation of the case by Supreme Court for Central Bureau of Investigation, saw Patna High Court assuming charge over the case. The Fodder Scam, as it was called was a new series of conflict between the government on one hand and the CBI and Judiciary at the other hand.

Between 1990 and 2005, the government under Lalu Prasad&#x27;s Janata Dal undertook several measures to strengthen the control of OBCs, Scheduled Caste and Muslims over bureaucracy. Latter were given the powerful position like those of District Magistrate. Transfers of the upper echelon of bureaucracy was also frequently resorted to. In the year 1993, the post of Director General of Police as well as Chief Secretary were both given to officers belonging to lower castes and the incumbent officers, who were both Brahmins were removed. Since the strategy of transfer of unwanted bureaucrats has a limit, Lalu&#x27;s government was adamant in use of quota to fill these posts with the officials from the subaltern background. If unable to appoint the lower castes, the government chose to keep many posts vacant, to prevent the upper castes from occupying them.

In order to weaken the upper-caste bureaucracy, the scope for intervention in its functioning by the party officials, belonging to Janata Dal was kept open.Hence, increased interference by party activists in the functioning of bureaucracy and police was witnessed. Meanwhile, the resurgence of the OBCs and SCs also resulted in extension of patronage to many of the &quot;Bahubalis&quot; ( a term representing someone with money and muscle power with criminal background) from these social groups. Lalu Prasad is said to have patronised; Pappu Yadav, operating out of Purnea and Madhepura districts; Vinod Yadav, operating out of Bhagalpur district; Surendra Yadav, operating out of Gaya district; Mohammad Shahabuddin, operating out of Siwan district; Makhi Paswan, operating out of Khagaria district; and Mohammed Suleiman, operating out of Kishanganj district. Lalu&#x27;s aide Brij Bihari Prasad, who was known for his muscle power ended the crime empire of Devendra Dubey, that was spread from East Champaran to Muzaffarpur district. Naxal leaders like Ravindra Singh Kushwaha, who were waging a war against the landlords through various naxal organisations active in the state, were invited to Janata Dal and allotted tickets to contest in assembly election. Subsequently, all the criminal cases against him were dropped, during the premiership of Lalu.

A popular opinion outside Bihar with respect to weakening of bureaucracy and &quot;breakdown of governance&quot; was the presence of rampant corruption and leadership&#x27;s ineptitude in Lalu&#x27;s regime. But, according to Jeffrey Witsoe, the RJD deliberately weakened the state institutions controlled by upper-castes in order to empower the lower castes. The OBCs were in control of government but the media and the bureaucracy along with the judiciary was still in control of upper-castes, it was this upper-caste dominance of the other state institutions that the OBC leadership was vying to end by trying to displace the upper-castes effectively from power.

In the meantime, accusations were laid against Lalu&#x27;s government for fomenting caste based antagonism between various social groups. Various commentators have stressed that under Lalu&#x27;s Janata Dal rule, the agricultural labourers and untouchables became vocal for respect from the dominant class and the fair wages. Retaliation on the part of lower castes were also seen, when the dominant caste militias tried to quell their revolt on these grounds. In one such case, in December 1991, a dominant caste militia called &quot;Savarna Liberation Front&quot; gangraped and murdered ten Dalit women, in retaliation, the left wing militants all belonging either Dalit or Backward Castes killed thirty five people from the dominant caste. William Dalrymple has chronicled the account of a dominant caste landowner who survived the massacre. The interlocutor of Dalrymple, who declared the incident to be a handiwork of Bihar government under Lalu Prasad said:
Another account from the &quot;Sargana Gram Panchayat&quot; area testifies the change in established socio-political order brought by the government under Lalu Prasad. A large Rajput farmer from the Panchayat constituency, who had been a predecessor of the incumbent Mukhiya of the village said:
As per one opinion, Lalu extended tacit support to the Maoist Communist Centre of India (MCC), and in the period of caste wars, he, as a Chief Minister frequently visited the places, where the victims were from Backward Castes. It is opined that many people from these castes voted him, only because he represented their aspiration of speaking back and becoming virile. The poor of the state couldn&#x27;t gain much in terms of jobs and services of state, but they were no longer left to be treated with disdain. Nandini Gooptu has mentioned some studies from the rural Bihar, belonging to the time period following the coming into power of Lalu Prasad, where the Schedule Castes like Musahars became vocal for their rights including wages, for the work they do under &#x27;employment guarantee schemes&#x27; of government. In one such study, a Musahar woman was recorded abusing the government officials belonging to Rajput caste for cheating [them] on wages due to them. Similarly, in another case, a Schedule Tribe Santhal was recorded taunting son of a Kayastha landlord. Many changes were observed at the lowest level of governance too; in one such case, a Rajput landlord family was replaced by a Kevat caste man for the post of Mukhiya in a village. These changes in the rural Bihar was found to be remarkable, considering the brutally enforced inequalities persisting therein for years.

In the early years of his rise in political circle, Lalu Prasad was also successful in creating defection in the left-wing political parties of the state, which had long history of association with Naxalism. In the areas around Nalanda and Aurangabad, the weakening of the CPI-ML liberation is attributed to the significant rise of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) led by Lalu Prasad. The RJD successfully attracted the Koeri and Yadav leadership of the party, thus strengthening itself at the cost of liberation. The leaders of CPI (ML) liberation, who defected to RJD included, Shri Bhagwan Singh Kushwaha, Umesh Singh, K.D Yadav and Suryadev Singh.

Lalu&#x27;s rule also led to breaking away of patron-client relationship in elections between the upper castes and the Dalits. The labourers of the upper caste landlords were primarily people from Dalit background, who were forced to vote in the elections as per the wishes of their masters, the upper castes. But, in this period, the agricultural labourers were given free hand in exercising their power to select their representatives. This transformation of the existing system brought political freedom for a large number of Dalits.

Earlier, the primary schools, which served as polling station during the elections used to be present in the upper caste villages. Hence, the Dalits needed to visit the upper caste villages to vote during elections. This was a problematic arrangement as the upper caste used to coerce them to vote their preferred candidate. However, journalist Amberish K Diwanji, who visited many villages in Bihar during 2005 Assembly elections, found that these schools were shifted to lower caste villages, by Lalu Prasad when he assumed the charge of state in earlier elections. This prevented the upper castes from coercing the Dalits during elections, and latter can exercise their franchise freely. Diwanji also noted that there existed robust social bonding between Yadavs and Musahars in some regions of Madhepura district. As per his report, in this region, the Yadavs had taken the place of upper caste in deciding, to whom the Musahars will vote. But, unlike upper castes, who didn&#x27;t mingle with the Musahars, the Yadavs, specially the poor ones, considered them as equal. Due to similar economic condition, the poor Yadavs in the region, mingled with the Musahars, their children play with each other and they behaved as a single social unit. Reportedly, this bonding often transforms into votes and Musahars prefers Lalu Prasad than any other political leader.

In some of the regions of the rural area of South Bihar, after the establishment of rule of Janata Dal under Lalu Prasad, the realignment in the policy of militant organisations like Maoist Communist Centre was observed. The MCC was dominated by the members of Yadav caste in the leadership position and the Schedule Castes served as the foot soldiers. Before advent of Lalu Prasad on the scene in 1980s, MCC was waging a &quot;class war&quot;, however, after Lalu Prasad assumed the premiership of the state the Yadav caste and Schedule Castes of the MCC shifted their loyalty to him. Earlier, the MCC had targeted Rajputs in the Dalelchak-Bhagaura massacre, but according to author Shashi Bhushan Singh, Lalu wanted a political alliance with the Rajputs and he directed the MCC members, specially his castemen to stop targeting the Rajputs. The Rajputs also accepted the dominance of Naxalite groups over the time in some regions of south Bihar and the Bhumihars remained the major challenger to both the Naxalites as well as the rule of Lalu Prasad.

After perpetrating a number of massacre of Dalits, Ranvir Sena, the caste based militia of Bhumihar caste perpetrated Miyanpur massacre in 2000, in Aurangabad, Bihar. In this massacre, the Yadav caste was victim; over 30 people were killed by Sena in this incident. However, it is reported that this incident set tone for decline of Sena. As the party of Lalu Prasad, which was in government took stringent administrative policies on one hand to counter Sena, on the other hand various naxalite group also resolved their internal differences and started an extermination campaign of the men of Sena in small operations.

===Combination of political and non-political conflicts===

The society of Bihar was divided into OBCs, SCs and Forward Castes (upper caste); the forward castes had dominated the democratic institutions of the state in the rule of Congress and only a section of OBCs were politically conscious to think of replacing them from political power, this section, which included only three caste (Koeri, Kurmi and Yadav) also owned land in other parts of Bihar, but was poor in the areas dominated of the forward castes. They took land on tenancy from the forward castes, as they were marginal farmers in these areas. A fair number of the OBCs were also employed in the state institutions and were among educated servicemen in the urban areas. They remained victims of the high handedness of the upper-caste colleagues and the rivalry between them was evolving over time.

In rural areas, the OBCs were also confronting the MBC or Extremely Backward Class (also called Most Backward Castes, the category which includes more than hundred Backward Castes, other than trio of Koeri, Kurmi and Yadav) and the Scheduled Castes, but the upper-castes treated all sections of Backward Castes in the same manner, causing much resentment among the elite section of the Backwards. In the rural areas, the upper-castes countered the Most Backward Classes and Schedule Castes, when they wanted to eschew the village based livelihood options. They [upper-castes] reacted violently, when the MBC or the SCs tried to detach from any social institutions, that were symbol of low caste status. Since for different reasons, the OBCs, MBCs and the SCs were all pitted against the common rivals, the upper-castes, and the bitterness between the OBCs and the forward castes had strengthened after the anti-reservation protest launched by the upper-castes, unification of these social groups took place against the forward castes.

The rise of Lalu Prasad provided an opportunity to unite all these social groups and the Naxalite groups, which had many OBCs in the leadership positions, also supported the political party led by Lalu. Maoist Communist Centre of India, one of the most significant Naxalite group also sided with the interest of OBCs, and the MCC activists started providing armed backing to the Most Backward Classes and the Schedule Castes to exercise their franchise in order to led the candidates of Lalu&#x27;s party towards victory. Hence, for a while, the boundary between political and Naxalite movement got blurred.

According to Professor Shashi Bhushan Singh, Department of Sociology, Delhi School of Economics, since the numerical strength of upper-caste (approximately 20% of state&#x27;s population) was not enough to have large number of MLAs in the state legislature in order to control the Backward Castes, they resorted to undemocratic practices in order to retain the power in their hand, leading to rise of militancy among a section of Backwards.
According to Singh, when Lalu Prasad asked for support from the members of Backward Castes, he was actually asking it in order to change the entire social order, in which upper caste were at advantage. The reservation policy introduced by the implementation of Mandal Commission recommendations though didn&#x27;t benefitted the Scheduled Castes, yet they supported Lalu Prasad against the forward castes.

According to a Social Scientist, who witnessed the encounter of Lalu with a person from the Musahar caste in North India, during his election campaign for 2000 Bihar Assembly elections, Lalu allegedly argued with latter, when he asked him to provide road infrastructure in the region. As per narrative, Lalu Prasad believed that the investment by state in physical infrastructure were somehow meant for benefitting the upper castes, who were having significant presence at the higher level of bureaucracy and in professional services. Hence, he blatantly created disruption in the general process of development, until the Upper Backward Castes take over the Forward Castes in these services. A majority of the District Magistrates during his tenure were from the Upper Backward Castes, and he also tried to ensure that the administrative posts at the middle level, for the rank of Sub Divisional Magistrates (SDM) and Block Development Officer (BDO) were also filled by these caste group only. For the professional services like Doctors and Engineers too, same formula was implemented.

According to author Arun Sinha, though Lalu and his colleague and successor Nitish Kumar belonged to same political roots, in the matter of quota politics and the politics of social justice for the deprived section of society, Kumar was accepted to upper castes. One reason behind this was step taken by Kumar for exclusion of well off section of the Backward Castes from the benefits of reservation in government jobs and other state sponsored program for social upliftment. In contrast to Kumar, Lalu Prasad has been described by Sinha, and was perceived as a staunch anti-upper caste leader.

The tenure of Lalu Prasad and his wife Rabari Devi coincided with Maoist Communist Centre becoming more violent than earlier. It was during Rabari Devi&#x27;s tenure that Senari carnage against the Bhumihars took place. In this incident, over hundred armed activists of MCC slaughtered 34 Bhumihars in the village called senari by brutally slitting their throats. As per reports, Rabari Devi refused to visit Senari, probably because the village inhabitants and victims, being member of Bhumihar caste had always opposed her government. It was reported that after being implicated in corruption scandal, Lalu Prasad raised his wife to the post of Chief Minister; latter was reportedly illiterate, but this was not offensive to the poor of Bihar. It is observed that for their plight, in the struggle against Dalit dominated naxal groups like MCC, Bhumihars prefer to blame Lalu, who is described as a champion of lower castes.

==Political symbolism==

Lalu&#x27;s politics is described as being against the radical Hindu Nationalism promoted by political parties like Bhartiya Janata Party. He employed political symbolism to a large extent in order to confront the politics based on militant religious ideology. In April 2003, he is reported to have organised a great rally at Gandhi Maidan, Patna, which was aimed at radicalising his lower caste supporters and mobilising them against the politics of Bhartiya Janata Party and Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP). In its rally, VHP was distributing &quot;Trishuls&quot; to the participants, which was a symbol of militant Hindu identity. Lalu asked his rural supporters to join him in Gandhi Maidan with a &quot;Lathi&quot; (a robust stick) against the &quot;Trishuls&quot; of VHP. He said that, this implement (&quot;Lathi&quot;) of the rural poor, which was considered as the weapon of weak, will destroy the &quot;Trishul&quot; of hatred (an implicit attack on BJP&#x27;s and VHP&#x27;s politics of religion).

As per an eyewitness report, on the day of rally, the rural lower caste supporters of Lalu Prasad rushed towards Patna; many of them were brought in hurry by the local leaders of the Rashtriya Janata Dal to showcase their support to Lalu Prasad. The theme of the rally was, &quot;Bhajpa Bhagao Desh Bachao&quot; (get rid of Bhartiya Janata Party and save the country). The rallygoers flooded the city armed with &quot;Lathis&quot;, and in their way to Patna, many of them occupied the trains rushing towards city forcefully. Many windows of the trains were thrashed and the hostels located in Patna were occupied for the rallygoers. The crowd was so massive that the traffic in the city was destabilized for two days. The supporters were told to apply oil to their &quot;Lathis&quot; and recite the slogan: &quot;Lathi pilavan, Patna laavan, Bhajpa bhagavan, Desh bachavan&quot; (we will apply oil to our Lathis, bring it to Patna, remove the Bhartiya Janata Party and save the country). The large gathering of followers of Lalu Prasad in capital city of state of Bihar sybmolised the capture of the real centre of power by latter, as the city was reported to have flooded with &quot;Lathi&quot; welding supporters of Rashtriya Janata Dal, who were mostly the lower caste people coming from rural background.

===1996 Gareeb Rally===
Lalu&#x27;s rally were contact point between him and his rural supporters. In 1996, a massive &quot;rally of the poor&quot; (Gareeb Rally) was organised by Janata Dal. Author Bela Bhatia, who was an eyewitness of this rally organised at Patna has mentioned that the poor people who assembled at Patna, were provided free commutation facility to become a part of this rally. There were numerous programmes organised by the office bearers of the Janata Dal for the rallyites. Bhatia has mentioned about the Trains, that were running on Arrah-Patna route, and carrying the rallyites to Patna. As she described the trains and buses were carrying more passengers than their capacity. Many of the people congregated at Patna either to lodge their grievances to the Chief Minister or in the hope of getting some monetary help. Bhatia describes an event being sponsored by Janata Dal legislator Shyam Rajak for the entertainment of rallyites, symbolising the acquaintance of the Chief Minister, Lalu Prasad with the taste of his rural supporters.
===Elevation of grassroot workers to important position===
In contrast to elections being based on money power, and the phenomenon of most of the candidates getting elected to houses of legislature in Bihar belonging to high income groups, RJD under Lalu Prasad has raised grassroot political workers from poor background to important positions in the politics of state. This is done occasionally to showcase the pro-poor stand of Lalu Prasad. In 2022, Lalu led election of a Dalit woman, Munni Rajak from Dhobi caste (washerman) to the seventy-five membered Bihar Legislative Council. Another example is of Ramvrikish Sada, the Rashtriya Janata Dal MLA from Alauli Assembly constituency, Khagaria district. Sada has even claimed that, he and his family worship Lalu Prasad besides Sabari, the deity of Musahars. Sada, who was associated with RJD for thirty years was reported to be the poorest MLA of Bihar in 2020 Bihar Legislative Assembly elections. He claimed that even money for running in election was provided to him by family of Lalu Prasad and he has just ₹ 70,000 in his bank account.

==Corruption charges and conviction==
===Corruption cases===
Lalu Prasad has been convicted and jailed in two scams. As of January 2018, he, his wife Rabri Devi, his sons Tejashwi Yadav and Tej Pratap Yadav, and his eldest daughter Misha Bharti were all facing charges in several other corruption cases.

====1996 Fodder Scam – 1st case====

Lalu was an accused party and later convicted in the first Fodder Scam case of 1996. The case involved the siphoning off of about ₹4.50 billion ($111.85 million) from the animal husbandry department.

Several allegations of embezzlement from the animal husbandry department were tabled between 1990 and 1995. In January 1996, a raid conducted on Chaibasa treasury indicated the siphoning off of funds by non-existent companies. Lalu ordered an inquiry to probe the irregularities. However, after a public interest litigation, the Bihar High Court in March 1996 ordered the case to be handed over to the CBI. In June 1997, the CBI filed the charge sheet in the case and made Lalu an accused. The charge forced Lalu Prasad to resign from the office of Chief Minister, at which time he appointed his wife, Rabri Devi, to the office.

In 2001, the Supreme Court of India transferred the scam cases to newly formed court in Ranchi, Jharkhand. The trial began in 2002. In August 2013, Lalu Prasad tried to get the trial court judge transferred, but his plea was rejected by Supreme Court of India. Lalu has been an accused in many of the 53-odd cases filed. He has been remanded to custody on multiple occasions because of the number of cases. Over 64 people were convicted in the case. Lalu was first sent to &quot;Judicial remand&quot; (Bihar Military Police guest house, Patna) on 30 July 1997, for 134 days. On 28 October 1998, he was again sent to the same guest house for 73 days. When the Supreme Court took exception to his guest house stay, he had also moved to the Beur jail in Patna. On 26 November 2001, Lalu was again remanded, in a case related to the fodder scam. Lalu accused the NDA of creating a conspiracy against him. On 1 October 2004, the Supreme Court served a notice to Lalu Prasad and his wife in response to a petition which alleged that they have been interfering with the investigation.

Lalu, along with 44 other accused, was convicted on 30 September 2013 after being found guilty in fraudulent withdrawal of ₹37 crores (₹370 million) from Chaibasa treasury. Several other politicians, IAS officers were also convicted in the case. Immediately after the verdict was pronounced, Lalu was arrested and taken to Birsa Munda Central Jail, located at Ranchi. Lalu Prasad was disqualified as MP for six years. He was given a jail sentence of five years and a fine of ₹25 lakh (₹2.5 million).

He was released on bail from Birsa Munda Central Jail, after he completed the bail formalities in a Special CBI court, months after his conviction.

====1998 disproportionate assets case====
In 1998, a disproportionate assets (DA) case arising out of the fodder scam was registered against Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi. In April 2000, both were made co-accused in the charge-sheet and surrendered. While Rabri Devi got bail due to being Chief Minister of Bihar, Lalu was remanded in Beur jail for 11 days. They were acquitted in 2006. The Bihar government wanted to appeal against the acquittal but the Supreme Court in 2010 ruled that the state government can not challenge such rulings.

====1996 Fodder Scam – 2nd case====
Lalu Prasad was convicted and jailed in the second Fodder Scam case of ₹8.927 million on the same day 23 December 2017 when his daughter Misha Bharti was also charged by the Enforcement Directorate of having disproportionate assets. Lalu Prasad was convicted 23 December 2017 and sentenced on 6 January 2018 to 3 years&#x27; imprisonment and ₹1,000,000 fine for the fraudulent withdrawal of ₹8,900,000 from the Deoghar district treasury between 1990 and 1994.

====1996 Fodder Scam – 5th case====
This case, pertaining to the scamming

====2005 Indian Railway tender scam====

2005 Indian Railway tender scam better known as Land-for-Jobs Scam, investigated by the CBI, is the bribery and corruption case where Lalu Prasad and his family are charged for illegally receiving prime property from the bidder as a bribe for corruptly awarding the Railway tender during Lalu&#x27;s tenure as Railway Minister. Transfer of these properties as bribe to Lalu and his children were disguised using the shell companies; for example, wife Rabri Devi and three children, Misha Bharti, Tejashwi Yadav and Tej Pratap Yadav, received Saguna Mor Mall property worth ₹45 crore through a shell company named Delight Marketing (renamed as Lara properties), and another shell company AB Exports was used to transfer properties worth ₹40 crore for a price of ₹4 lakh to Lalu&#x27;s other three children Tejashwi Yadav, Ragini and Chanda. This case spawned several other related but independent cases, such as disproportionate assets case as well as tax avoidance case by ED. Under the Benami Transactions Prohibition Act recipient of such benami properties can be imprisoned for up to 7 years and fined up to 25% fair market value, and convicted politicians are barred from contesting elections or holding elected position for six years.

====2017 Delight Properties case====

The I-T department issued summons for 12 June 2017 to Misha Bharti, over Benami land deals worth ₹10 billion (₹1,000 crores). Misha was officially charged by ED in disproportionate assets case on the same day her father was convicted again in the second fodder scam. After the CBI lodged an FIR on 5 July 2017, ED filed the Case Information Report (ECIR) on 27 July 2017 against Lalu, his wife Rabri, their younger son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and others in the railways tender corruption and ill-gotten property scam that happened during Lalu&#x27;s tenure as the Railway Minister. Taking action against this scam, ED of Income Tax Department on 12 September 2017 attached more than 12 properties in Patna and Delhi including the plot for the mall in Patna, a farm house in Delhi and up-market land in Palam Vihar in Delhi. This includes the transfer of ₹450 million (₹45 crore) Seguna mor benami property transferred to Lalu&#x27;s wife Rabri Devi and children Tejashwi Yadav and Tej Pratap Yadav by using a shell company named Delight Properties, which was later renamed as Lara Properties. (Updated: 7 Jan 2018)

====2017 AB Exports cases====
AB Exports was a shell company used to transfer, as a bribe for the railway tender scam, ₹400 million (₹40 crore) benami property for a mere price of ₹400,000 to Lalu&#x27;s 3 children Tejashwi Yadav, Ragini Yadav and Chanda Singh.

===Bail===
Lalu Prasad was convicted in the controversial Fodder Scam, and was serving a term until 17 April 2021, when he was granted bail from the Jharkhand High Court in the corruption scandal.

==Criticism==
===Corruption, nepotism and dynasticism===
Lalu Prasad is one of the first noted politicians to lose parliamentary seat on being arrested in fodder scam as per Supreme Court decision banning convicted legislators to hold their posts. During his tenure as Chief Minister, Bihar&#x27;s law and order was at lowest, kidnapping was on rise and private armies mushroomed. He was also criticized by opposition in the Shilpi-Gautam Murder case and the death of his daughter Ragini Yadav&#x27;s friend, Abhishek Mishra, in mysterious circumstances.

===Criticism on Yadavisation===
Lalu&#x27;s rule witnessed Yadav caste becoming assertive in the rural and urban landscape of Bihar, leading his opponents to coin the slogan of &quot;Yadavisation&quot; of Bihar&#x27;s polity and administration. This fact was used by other political parties to dislodge his government on the charges of working for the benefit of a single caste group at the cost of various other backward communities. According to a report of Indian Human Development Survey (2011–12), Brahmins topped in average per capita income with ₹28,093, the other upper castes of Bihar which comprises Rajputs have an average per capita income of ₹20,655, closely followed by middle agrarian castes like Kushwahas and Kurmis earning ₹18,811 and ₹17,835 respectively as their average per capita income. In contrast, Yadavs&#x27; income is one of the lowest among OBCs at ₹12,314, which is slightly less than the rest of OBCs (₹12,617). Hence, despite the political mobilisation of backward castes in post mandal period, the upper-caste are still the highest income groups in Bihar. According to this report, the economic benefits of the Mandal politics could be seen as affecting only few backward castes of agrarian background leading to their upward mobilisation. The Yadavs hence transformed their assertiveness to the upward mobility in the politics only while the other &quot;Backward Castes&quot; gained momentum in the other fields, though still the upper-caste dominance was retained in upper echelon of bureaucracy.

<text>Victoria Park () is a public park in Causeway Bay, Wan Chai District, Hong Kong. The park is named after Queen Victoria, who has a statue in the park. It is around in size and contains sporting facilities for tennis, association football, basketball, handball, volleyball, swimming, jogging, fitness, roller skating, and bowling.

The park first opened to the public in October 1957 and was revamped in the early 2000s. Owned and operated by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department of Hong Kong, the park is open all year, free of admission charge. It is Hong Kong&#x27;s most popular public park, with more visitors than Hong Kong Park and Kowloon Park combined.

== Site ==
Victoria Park is located on Hong Kong Island, in the Causeway Bay area of Wan Chai District. It is situated on the shore of Causeway Bay typhoon shelter and separated by a breakwater from Victoria Harbour. The park is bounded by Causeway Road to the southeast, Gloucester Road to the west, Victoria Park Road and Island Eastern Corridor to the north, and Hing Fat Street to the east.

The park is bordered on the south by the Hong Kong Central Library and the Regal Hongkong Hotel, on the east by the Park Towers residential complex, on the north by a fire station and Citicorp Centre office tower, and on the west by Windsor House retail mall and The Park Lane Hong Kong hotel. A small square, Tung Lo Wan Garden, is located in the north-western portion of Victoria Park. Two stations, Causeway Bay and Tin Hau, are located near the park. There are bus lines and a tramline along Causeway Road, which run beside the park. Several pedestrian bridges with escalators and elevators have been built to connect the park to the Causeway Road.

== History ==
Previously, the park&#x27;s location served as a typhoon shelter, known as Causeway Bay Typhoon Shelter, used by small fishing boats and yachts during typhoon seasons. In the 1950s, the former bay was filled in, the shoreline was pushed north, and the government decided to create a public park on the newly reclaimed land. A new typhoon shelter was built north of the park.

In 1955, a statue of Queen Victoria was moved to the park. The statue was cast in Pimlico, London, towards the end of the nineteenth century and subsequently erected in Hong Kong&#x27;s Central District. It was transferred to Japan to be melted down during the Japanese occupation, but was retrieved in the aftermath of World War II, and was restored before being placed in the park. The park officially opened in October 1957. In 1972, embankments in the park&#x27;s northern half were completed in conjunction with the construction of the Cross-Harbour Tunnel, and the Victoria Park Road was paved.

A central lawn was laid in the park in 1974 and a tennis court was built in 1981. In 1984, an overpass of the Island Eastern Corridor was built along Victoria Park Road, connecting Causeway Bay with the Tai Koo Shing estate. In September 1996, a mainland Chinese artist, Pun Sing-lui, in protest over Hong Kong&#x27;s &quot;dull, colonial culture&quot;, painted the statue of Queen Victoria crimson and bent its nose with a hammer. The nose of the statue was rebuilt costing $150,000, and Sing-lui was sentenced to 28 days in prison.

From 2000 to 2002, the park received a major renovation, which saw many sporting facilities built on the site. The park&#x27;s popularity increased after the revamp, especially among Indonesian domestic workers, as Sugar Street, adjacent to the park, is home to numerous Indonesian food, spice, book, magazine and music shops.

In 2013, a modern indoor swimming complex was built on the site of the old outdoor pools. In the following year, construction work for the project began at the northern end of Victoria Park, sparking public outcry. A portion of the park was occupied by construction of a slip road for the Central–Wan Chai Bypass project. This was highly controversial, as local councillors and residents alleged they were not informed that the road would cut through the park. In March 2015, construction unearthed unexploded ordnance dating from World War II, and the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Bureau of the Hong Kong Police Force was called in to dispose of it.

== Features ==
=== Facilities ===

In the central section of Victoria Park, there is a complex of fourteen tennis courts, with the main court, which opened in 1981, seating approximately 3,600 spectators, with two fields with artificial turf for playing bowls are nearby. A two-hectare central lawn is surrounded by pathways with trees to the west of the tennis courts. A 625-meter jogging path around the lawn features six stops for diverse fitness training. Six public football pitches are located south of the courts and central lawn, and a sitting statue of Queen Victoria stands next to them. Four basketball courts are located in the southeast section of the park, between the football pitches and the swimming pool.

There are public roller rinks, a handball and volleyball court and table tennis courts. There are four playgrounds to the north of the tennis courts, each with its own set of slides, swings, and exercise equipment, as well as a pebble walking trail. A 954 square meter in size and a half-meter deep pond where model yachting takes place and an open stage with a bandstand suitable for a hundred spectators are both located to the north of the central lawn. Most sports fields in the park have restrooms, changing rooms, and drinking fountains. Open portions of the park are patrolled 24/7 by both local policemen and police teams.

The indoor swimming complex, which opened in September 2013 at a cost of nearly HK$800 million is located in the park&#x27;s eastern section, on the location of the Old Victoria Park Swimming Pool. It includes two pools with 2,500-seat spectator stands and an electronic scoreboard, as well as changing rooms, showers, restrooms, and wheelchair lifts. The Old Victoria Park Swimming Pool was opened with the park itself in 1957 and was the first public swimming pool in Hong Kong.

=== Vegetation ===
Trees such as &quot;Jacaranda mimosifolia&quot;, &quot;Melia azedarach&quot;, &quot;Spathodea&quot;, &quot;Delonix regia&quot; and &quot;Casuarina equisetifolia&quot; are found in the park. The park also houses many trees that are registered as &quot;old and valuable&quot;, including &quot;Ceiba pentandra&quot;, &quot;Erythrina variegata&quot;, &quot;Mimusops elengi&quot;, &quot;Ficus virens&quot; and &quot;Ficus altissima&quot;.

== Events ==
In the days leading up to Chinese New Year, the park hosts the annual Lunar New Year Fair, which also includes a plant market, however both of these events were not held in 2022 due to COVID-19. Other annual events such as the Hong Kong Flower Show, Hong Kong Brands and Products Expo, Mid-Autumn Festival, Hong Kong Marathon and Hong Kong Pride Parade are also held in the park.

Apart from annual events, employees of the Consulate General of Indonesia frequently arrange meetings and open-air training courses in the park as well. The United Buddy Bears exhibition, which was held on the central lawn of Victoria Park in 2004, drew over 2 million visitors, making it Hong Kong&#x27;s largest open-air art exposition. The &quot;Arts Corner&quot; is hosted in the South Pavilion Square every Sunday, except when there are citywide events. Here, artists sell their works, souvenirs, handicrafts, paintings, drawings, cartoons, and photographs in kiosks and small booths.

Victoria Park serves as a gathering point for the annual 1 July marches. The park has become a staging ground for protests many times, including for pro-democracy protests in December 2005, the 2014 Occupy Movement, and anti-government demonstrations in the summer of 2019.

City Forum, attended by government officials, politicians, business figurers and pundits, would debate on new government policies was formerly held at the park weekly on Sunday. The forum was inspired by Speakers&#x27; Corner in London, and was aired by Hong Kong government&#x27;s broadcaster Radio Television Hong Kong. It was discontinued in September 2021.

=== Tiananmen Square commemoration ===
The park serves as a place of commemoration for the Tiananmen Square massacre of 4 June 1989, with huge crowds gathering each year to mark the anniversary of the massacre, although the park was closed in June 2021 owing to law enforcement restrictions imposed, following the 2020 Hong Kong national security law. It was also closed off to the commemoration in June 2020, and was closed in 2022 and 2023 for &quot;maintenance.&quot;

<text>Turner Valley was a town in the Calgary Metropolitan Region of Alberta, Canada within the Town of Diamond Valley. It is on Highway 22 (Cowboy Trail), west of Black Diamond and approximately southwest of Calgary. It was named after Robert and John Turner who settled in the area in 1886.

The town was once the centre of an oil and natural gas boom. For 30 years, the Turner Valley oilfields were a major supplier of oil and gas and the largest producer in the British Empire.

== History ==

Turner Valley incorporated as a village on February 23, 1930. After 47 years as a village, Turner Valley incorporated as a town on September 1, 1977. On January 1, 2023, the Town of Turner Valley amalgamated with its neighbouring Town of Black Diamond to form the Town of Diamond Valley.

On May 25, 2022, the Province of Alberta issued an Order in Council to amalgamate Black Diamond and Turner Valley to form the new Town of Diamond Valley, with an incorporation date of January 1, 2023. 

This followed decades of talk and a 2007 plebiscite that saw Turner Valley citizens embrace amalgamation and Black Diamond residents reject it. 

Ultimately, the prospect of efficiencies and possible cost savings of $1 million a year became a major catalyst to approving the merger without a plebiscite. 

On January 1, 2023, the Town of Black Diamond amalgamated with its neighbouring Town of Turner Valley to form the Town of Diamond Valley.
;Turner Valley Gas Plant
W. Stewart Herron, a rancher from nearby Okotoks, gathered investors from local contacts such as James Lougheed, R.B. Bennett and A.E. Cross. Herron himself lacked the technical expertise to drill Turner Valley&#x27;s fossil-fuel that was some underground. Herron recruited drilling expert Archibald Dingman, a 19th-century American veteran from Pennsylvania.

On May 14, 1914, A.W. Dingman struck wet natural gas, which produced gasoline. However, in 1920, the main buildings burned to the ground. Herron&#x27;s group could not afford to rebuild and operate the site. Imperial Oil bought Calgary Petroleum Products, created a subsidiary named Royalite Oil Co., and rebuilt the plant.

The plant ceased operations in 1985 and with the encouragement of a local group, the Turner Valley Oilfield Society, and the most recent owner of the gas plant, the Alberta provincial government, accepted the site as part of its group of historic sites. Since that time Alberta Culture has been at work on the Turner Valley Gas Plant, primarily stabilizing the facility and removing or mitigating the contaminants on the site. In 2014, Alberta Culture held a celebration on May 14, 2014, on the day of the centennial of the discovery of oil on the site. More than 2,000 people attended this full day of events. It is estimated that, along with the $20 million spent on restoring the site, an additional $20 million will be needed to help get the site operational.

<text>Selection bias is the bias introduced by the selection of individuals, groups, or data for analysis in such a way that proper randomization is not achieved, thereby failing to ensure that the sample obtained is representative of the population intended to be analyzed. It is sometimes referred to as the selection effect. The phrase &quot;selection bias&quot; most often refers to the distortion of a statistical analysis, resulting from the method of collecting samples. If the selection bias is not taken into account, then some conclusions of the study may be false.

==Types of bias==

===Sampling bias===

Sampling bias is systematic error due to a non-random sample of a population, causing some members of the population to be less likely to be included than others, resulting in a biased sample, defined as a statistical sample of a population (or non-human factors) in which all participants are not equally balanced or objectively represented. It is mostly classified as a subtype of selection bias, sometimes specifically termed &quot;sample selection bias&quot;, but some classify it as a separate type of bias.

A distinction of sampling bias (albeit not a universally accepted one) is that it undermines the external validity of a test (the ability of its results to be generalized to the rest of the population), while selection bias mainly addresses internal validity for differences or similarities found in the sample at hand. In this sense, errors occurring in the process of gathering the sample or cohort cause sampling bias, while errors in any process thereafter cause selection bias.

Examples of sampling bias include self-selection, pre-screening of trial participants, discounting trial subjects/tests that did not run to completion and migration bias by excluding subjects who have recently moved into or out of the study area, length-time bias, where slowly developing disease with better prognosis is detected, and lead time bias, where disease is diagnosed earlier for participants than in comparison populations, although the average course of disease is the same.

===Time interval===
* Early termination of a trial at a time when its results support the desired conclusion.
* A trial may be terminated early at an extreme value (often for ethical reasons), but the extreme value is likely to be reached by the variable with the largest variance, even if all variables have a similar mean.

===Exposure===
* &quot;Susceptibility bias&quot;
** &quot;Clinical susceptibility bias&quot;, when one disease predisposes for a second disease, and the treatment for the first disease erroneously appears to predispose to the second disease. For example, postmenopausal syndrome gives a higher likelihood of also developing endometrial cancer, so estrogens given for the postmenopausal syndrome may receive a higher than actual blame for causing endometrial cancer.
** &quot;Protopathic bias&quot;, when a treatment for the first symptoms of a disease or other outcome appear to cause the outcome. It is a potential bias when there is a lag time from the first symptoms and start of treatment before actual diagnosis. It can be mitigated by lagging, that is, exclusion of exposures that occurred in a certain time period before diagnosis.
** &quot;Indication bias&quot;, a potential mixup between cause and effect when exposure is dependent on indication, e.g. a treatment is given to people in high risk of acquiring a disease, potentially causing a preponderance of treated people among those acquiring the disease. This may cause an erroneous appearance of the treatment being a cause of the disease.

===Data===
* Partitioning (dividing) data with knowledge of the contents of the partitions, and then analyzing them with tests designed for blindly chosen partitions.
*Post hoc alteration of data inclusion based on arbitrary or subjective reasons, including:
**Cherry picking, which actually is not selection bias, but confirmation bias, when specific subsets of data are chosen to support a conclusion (e.g. citing examples of plane crashes as evidence of airline flight being unsafe, while ignoring the far more common example of flights that complete safely. See: availability heuristic)
**Rejection of bad data on (1) arbitrary grounds, instead of according to previously stated or generally agreed criteria or (2) discarding &quot;outliers&quot; on statistical grounds that fail to take into account important information that could be derived from &quot;wild&quot; observations.

===Studies===
* Selection of which studies to include in a meta-analysis (see also combinatorial meta-analysis).
* Performing repeated experiments and reporting only the most favorable results, perhaps relabelling lab records of other experiments as &quot;calibration tests&quot;, &quot;instrumentation errors&quot; or &quot;preliminary surveys&quot;.
* Presenting the most significant result of a data dredge as if it were a single experiment (which is logically the same as the previous item, but is seen as much less dishonest).

===Attrition===
&quot;Attrition bias&quot; is a kind of selection bias caused by attrition (loss of participants), discounting trial subjects/tests that did not run to completion. It is closely related to the survivorship bias, where only the subjects that &quot;survived&quot; a process are included in the analysis or the failure bias, where only the subjects that &quot;failed&quot; a process are included. It includes &quot;dropout&quot;, &quot;nonresponse&quot; (lower response rate), &quot;withdrawal&quot; and &quot;protocol deviators&quot;. It gives biased results where it is unequal in regard to exposure and/or outcome. For example, in a test of a dieting program, the researcher may simply reject everyone who drops out of the trial, but most of those who drop out are those for whom it was not working. Different loss of subjects in intervention and comparison group may change the characteristics of these groups and outcomes irrespective of the studied intervention.

Lost to follow-up, is another form of Attrition bias, mainly occurring in medicinal studies over a lengthy time period. Non-Response or Retention bias can be influenced by a number of both tangible and intangible factors, such as; wealth, education, altruism, initial understanding of the study and its requirements. Researchers may also be incapable of conducting follow-up contact resulting from inadequate identifying information and contact details collected during the initial recruitment and research phase.

===Observer selection===
Philosopher Nick Bostrom has argued that data are filtered not only by study design and measurement, but by the necessary precondition that there has to be someone doing a study. In situations where the existence of the observer or the study is correlated with the data, observation selection effects occur, and anthropic reasoning is required.

An example is the past impact event record of Earth: if large impacts cause mass extinctions and ecological disruptions precluding the evolution of intelligent observers for long periods, no one will observe any evidence of large impacts in the recent past (since they would have prevented intelligent observers from evolving). Hence there is a potential bias in the impact record of Earth. Astronomical existential risks might similarly be underestimated due to selection bias, and an anthropic correction has to be introduced.

=== Volunteer bias ===
Self-selection bias or a volunteer bias in studies offer further threats to the validity of a study as these participants may have intrinsically different characteristics from the target population of the study. Studies have shown that volunteers tend to come from a higher social standing than from a lower socio-economic background. Furthermore, another study shows that women are more probable to volunteer for studies than males. Volunteer bias is evident throughout the study life-cycle, from recruitment to follow-ups. More generally speaking volunteer response can be put down to individual altruism, a desire for approval, personal relation to the study topic and other reasons. As with most instances mitigation in the case of volunteer bias is an increased sample size. 

==Mitigation==
In the general case, selection biases cannot be overcome with statistical analysis of existing data alone, though Heckman correction may be used in special cases. An assessment of the degree of selection bias can be made by examining correlations between exogenous (background) variables and a treatment indicator. However, in regression models, it is correlation between &quot;unobserved&quot; determinants of the outcome and &quot;unobserved&quot; determinants of selection into the sample which bias estimates, and this correlation between unobservables cannot be directly assessed by the observed determinants of treatment.

When data are selected for fitting or forecast purposes, a coalitional game can be set up so that a fitting or forecast accuracy function can be defined on all subsets of the data variables.

==Related issues==
Selection bias is closely related to:
* publication bias or reporting bias, the distortion produced in community perception or meta-analyses by not publishing uninteresting (usually negative) results, or results which go against the experimenter&#x27;s prejudices, a sponsor&#x27;s interests, or community expectations.
* confirmation bias, the general tendency of humans to give more attention to whatever confirms our pre-existing perspective; or specifically in experimental science, the distortion produced by experiments that are designed to seek confirmatory evidence instead of trying to disprove the hypothesis.
* exclusion bias, results from applying different criteria to cases and controls in regards to participation eligibility for a study/different variables serving as basis for exclusion.

<doc id="394393" wikidata="Q2046751" url="?curid=394393" title="Sylvan Lake, Alberta">
<text>Sylvan Lake is a town in central Alberta, Canada. It is located approximately west of the City of Red Deer along Highway 11 or Highway 11A. It is on the southeast edge of Sylvan Lake, a freshwater lake that straddles the boundary between Red Deer County and Lacombe County.

The lake is a popular destination for tourists from around Alberta, with around 1 million visitors each year. Popular tourist activities include sunbathing, swimming, water-skiing, and visiting Camp Woods. Camp Woods in Sylvan Lake hosted the 12th Canadian Scout Jamboree in July 2013.

== History ==
The land that would later become the town was ceded to the Crown by the First Nations with Treaty 6 in 1877.

Sylvan Lake was originally settled by French-speaking immigrants from Quebec and the United States. Arriving in 1898 from Michigan, Alexandre Loiselle and his family homesteaded the quarter section that later became the west side of today&#x27;s Main (50th) Street and the businesses and homes immediately to the west. When the first settlers arrived at Sylvan Lake in 1899, the lake was named Snake Lake from the Cree name () which referred to the numerous garter snakes in the area. The name was officially changed to Sylvan Lake in 1903 (Gaetz 1948). &quot;Sylvan&quot; is from the Latin , which means &quot;of a forest&quot;.

Palliser&#x27;s map of 1859 gives the name Swan Lake for the location.

In the early twentieth century, groups of Estonian and then Finnish settlers moved to homesteads to the south and west of the fledgling settlement at Sylvan Lake. With their arrival came the early business community, a general store, a blacksmith, a hardware store, post office, barber, and restaurants. The completion of the Canadian Northern line to Rocky Mountain House and Nordegg in 1912 and the parallel Canadian Pacific in 1914 opened the west country to settlement and resulted in the incorporation of Sylvan Lake in 1913 under Mayor E. S. Grimson, a local hardware store owner. The anniversary of the founding of the town is celebrated every year in Sylvan Lake as &quot;1913 Days&quot;.

Farming quickly became a mainstay in the area and in 1923 an Alberta Pacific Grain Company grain elevator was built on the CPR line immediately north of what is now Cottonwood Estates. The elevator was torn down in the 1970s and the CPR line was abandoned in 1983 and removed in 1986. Since then, the right of way has survived as a natural area and walking path through Sylvan Lake.

Elevators were also constructed along the CN line and were used by local farmers in the mid-century decades. They were torn down in the late 1990s.

Even prior to the building of the railways, Sylvan Lake was becoming a summer resort for families in Red Deer. With the coming of the trains, &quot;the Lake&quot; became a favourite of families from both Edmonton and Calgary. The summer visitors camped in tents, but soon the &quot;Cottage Area&quot; east of 46 Street and in &quot;Lower Camp&quot; on the southeast shore began to fill with summer cottages. In the 1930s and 1940s people began arriving by car and the areas around Norglenwold, Sylvan Lake Provincial Park and Jarvis Bay Provincial Park began to fill up with summer visitors.

The influx of summer residents and visitors also brought businesses and services that catered to the ever-increasing number of tourists. In 1913, the first motor launch took paying passengers on tours around the lake. A large boathouse was constructed in 1926, allowing visitors to rent a boat, canoe, swimsuit, or buy ice cream, pop and other items necessary to a summer day at the lake. Regattas were held on the lake for a number of years beginning in 1923.

In 1928, the Dominion Government, assisted by the Sylvan Lake Women&#x27;s Institute (WI), built the long pier that jutted out into the lake from the bottom of Main Street. This pier was connected to the earlier WI Pier and formed a square area used for swimming and mooring boats. The first &quot;waterslide&quot; at Sylvan Lake was part of this facility. The piers were prone to ice damage over the winter and were replaced by the existing &quot;landfill&quot; that now hosts beach volleyball tournaments, dragon boat racing and the lake tour on the &quot;Zoo Cruise&quot;.

In 1983, the original waterslide was replaced by the Wild Rapids Waterslides, which was the largest facility of its kind in western Canada until its closure in 2016.

Another byproduct of losing the piers and later the government boat launch was the construction of the Sylvan Lake Marina, home of many of the permanent boats on the lake, boating facilities, and the Sylvan Lake lighthouse.

In 2014, Sylvan Lake won the Kraft Hockeyville contest, which included a large cash prize and the rights to host an NHL pre-season game between the Calgary Flames and the Arizona Coyotes.

<doc id="394395" wikidata="Q3109128" url="?curid=394395" title="Uma Bharti">
<text>Uma Bharti (born 3 May 1959) is an Indian politician and former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh. She became involved with the Bharatiya Janata Party at a young age, unsuccessfully contesting her first parliamentary elections in 1984. In 1989, she successfully contested the Khajuraho seat, and retained it in elections conducted in 1991, 1996 and 1998. In 1999, she switched constituencies and won the Bhopal seat.

Bharti held various state-level and cabinet-level portfolios in the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Tourism, Youth Affairs and Sports, and also in Coal and Mines during the second as well as third ministry of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. After Narendra Modi became the Indian Prime Minister in 2014, she was appointed the Minister for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, and held this office until September 2017.

Bharti was among the leaders in the Ram Janmabhoomi movement of the 1980s and 1990s, organised by the Vishva Hindu Parishad. She was present at the demolition of the Babri Masjid, and was later acquitted by a special CBI court in relation to charges filed against her in the incident.

In the 2003 State Assembly polls, she led the BJP to a sweeping win in the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly. She defeated her Indian National Congress (INC) opponent from the Malehra seat by a 25 per cent margin. She resigned from the post of Chief Minister in August 2004, when an arrest warrant was issued against her regarding the 1994 Hubli riot case. After a falling-out with the BJP, she established her own political party for a while before returning to the fold and being elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly in the state of Uttar Pradesh. She was subsequently re-elected to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament of India.

She is occasionally addressed by the Hindu honorific &quot;Sādhvī&quot;, a respectful Sanskrit title for a female renunciant.

==Early life==
Uma Bharti was born on 3 May 1959 in Dunda, Tikamgarh District in the state of Madhya Pradesh to a family of peasants, belonging to the Lodhi caste. She attended school up until the sixth standard. As a child, she displayed considerable interest in religious texts like the Bhagvad Gita which led to her being seen as a &quot;spiritual&quot; child. She began to give religious discourses while still a child, which brought her into contact with Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia, who would later become her political mentor. She describes herself in her youth as a &quot;religious missionary&quot;.

==Political career==

===Rise to prominence and Ram Janmabhoomi===
With the support of Vijaya Raje Scindia, Bharti became involved with the BJP in Madhya Pradesh while still in her twenties. In 1984, she contested Lok Sabha elections for the first time, but lost from Khajuraho (Lok Sabha constituency) as the INC saw a surge in support following the assassination of Indira Gandhi. In 1989, she won from Khajuraho Lok Sabha constituency, and retained the seat in the elections of 1991, 1996, and 1998. She was elected to Lok Sabha from Bhopal in 1999, and from Jhansi in 2014. She did not contest Lok Sabha elections in 2019.

Bharti rose to national prominence when she became one of the major faces of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, alongside L. K. Advani and others. Her fiery speeches are credited for helping the movement achieve its momentum. In December 1992, she was one of several prominent Sangh Parivar figures present at a rally in Ayodhya that developed into a riot, culminating in the demolition of the Babri Mosque. Bharti was indicted for inciting a mob to violence by the Liberhan Commission that probed the incident. Bharti has denied that she incited the mob but says she does not regret it and that she is willing to take &quot;moral responsibility&quot; for the demolition. She acknowledges that the BJP reaped massive political benefits from the incident. In April 2017, the Supreme Court of India reinstated a criminal conspiracy case against Bharti and other BJP leaders.

Bharti has called for the BJP to stop avoiding responsibility for the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, saying: She has also denied the presence of any conspiracy by the Sangh, while stating that she does not regret the demolition, as it furthers the goal of building a Ram Mandir there.

In the 1999 Lok Sabha elections, Bharti switched constituencies and won the Bhopal seat. She became a cabinet member of the Vajpayee administration, and held various state- and cabinet-level portfolios, being those for Human Resource Development, Tourism, Youth Affairs and Sports, and finally Coal and Mines.

===Chief Minister===
Bharti was appointed the Chief Ministerial candidate of the BJP for the 2003 Assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh. On the back of a fierce campaign based on a platform of development, and helped along by her reputation as a Hindutva firebrand, she led the party to a sweeping victory in which it won 173 out of 230 seats in the legislature. She was elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) of Madhya Pradesh.

===Bharatiya Janashakti Party===
In August 2004, after only a year in office, an arrest warrant was issued against Bharti in connection with the 1994 Hubli riots, forcing her resignation. In November 2004, she had a public falling out with Advani during a meeting at the BJP headquarters. This led to a suspension from the BJP, which was revoked a few months later at the insistence of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist social service volunteer organisation. She continued to publicly defy the BJP high command, insisting that she replace Shivraj Singh Chouhan as the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, which led to several show-cause notices from the party, and eventually, to her expulsion.

In response, Bharti floated her own political party, the Bharatiya Janshakti Party. She stated that her party followed the ideology of the RSS, and claimed that she had the support of Mohan Bhagwat, head of the RSS. However, the party had a marked lack of political success.

===Re-entry into the BJP===
Bharti was re-inducted into the BJP on 7 June 2011. She was tasked with reviving the party in Uttar Pradesh, ahead of that state&#x27;s assembly election in 2012. In those elections, she was elected to the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly from the Charkhari constituency. Subsequently, she was appointed to the position of party vice-president along with twelve others, as part of a team created to guide the BJP through the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. On 16 May 2014, she was elected to the Lok Sabha from Jhansi constituency by defeating Chandrapal Yadav of the Samajwadi Party. She served as the Minister for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation from 26 May 2014 to 1 September 2017. She became the Minister of drinking water and sanitation on 3 September 2017. Uma Bharti donated one month of her salary to support the welfare of families of Central Reserve Police Force personnel murdered in the 2019 Pulwama attack perpetrated by a Kashmiri militant against the Indian Army.

==Threats against Walmart==

In late November 2011, when the Government of India decided to allow 51% foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail and 100% in single brand retail, Uma Bharti threatened Walmart with arson should they enter the Indian market.

<doc id="394396" wikidata="Q68625" url="?curid=394396" title="Heinrich Nordhoff">
<text>Heinz Heinrich Nordhoff (6 January 1899 – 12 April 1968) was a German engineer who led the rebuilding of Volkswagen (VW) after World War II. He was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine on Feb. 15, 1954.

In 1948, Nordhoff accepted a British invitation to assume the directorship of VW, which had been revived as a functioning concern by the British under the direction of Ivan Hirst. Nordhoff subsequently guided the company to become the fourth largest automotive company at the time of his death in 1968.

==Background==
Nordhoff was born in Hildesheim, the son of a banker. He graduated from the Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg, where he became a member of the Roman Catholic fraternity Askania-Burgundia.

Nordhoff died on April 12, 1968, from the effects of a heart attack sustained months earlier. He was survived by his wife, Charlotte (Fassunge) Nordhoff (1898-1988) and daughters Elisabeth (later Mrs. Ernst Piech, grandson of Ferdinand Piech) and Barbara Nordhoff (Mrs. Dan Cantacuzino-Corneni, 1929-2022).

On his death, the Boston Globe described him as a shy, gentle man, an artist, music lover, naturalist, and hunter — who, having lived the equivalent of several years in the United States during his tenure with General Motors, spoke English like a native. At the time of his death, he lived in Wolfsburg, West Germany, the city noted for Volkswagen&#x27;s then-largest production facility.

==Career==
In 1927, Nordhoff began work for BMW working on aircraft engines.

In 1929 he went to work for Opel, where he gained experience of the automotive industry and, since the company had been acquired by General Motors not long before, of American practices in the field. He was rapidly promoted: in 1936 he was the Commercial-Technical director who presented the company&#x27;s innovative new small car, the Kadett, to the public.

In 1942, with passenger car production much diminished on account of the war, he took over from Gerd Stieler von Heydekampf as Production Director at the company&#x27;s flagship truck plant at Brandenburg.

After the war he was barred from working in the American-occupied sector because of a business award he had received from the Nazis. He obtained a job as a service manager at a Hamburg garage. Hamburg was a central location for the Control Commission for Germany (British Element), the administration for the British Zone of Occupation, who recruited him for the position of managing director of the REME-controlled Volkswagen plant at Wolfsburg at the urging of British Army Major Ivan Hirst, who had been directing the plant. Nordhoff took up the position on 1 January 1948.

During his first year in post, Nordhoff doubled production to 19,244 cars. By the end of 1961 annual production exceeded a million vehicles. He became legendary for turning the Volkswagen Beetle into a worldwide automotive phenomenon; he developed export markets and ultimately manufacturing facilities abroad. He pioneered the idea of constant improvement while keeping the styling the same. He gave liberal benefits to Volkswagen workers and increased pay scales. Within six years of taking over Volkswagen, Nordhoff reduced the number of man-hours to produce a single car by 75 percent, from 400 to 100. His commitment to improving the workmanship at Volkswagen made the Beetle famous for its bulletproof reliability.

In 1955, shortly before the Wolfsburg factory celebrated its millionth Volkswagen, Nordhoff was awarded a Federal Service Cross with star.

Nordhoff&#x27;s ability to sell cars and his achievement in first placing the Wolfsburg factory on a firm footing and then making Volkswagen a domestic and international success have not been questioned, but he has been criticised on various bases. At Brandenburg during the war, he used slave labour, although he reportedly ensured the workers had adequate food, shelter and clothing. He took full credit for the company&#x27;s successes and has been seen as overly self-promoting; in the 1950s he was nicknamed &quot;King Nordhoff&quot; by the West German press. Finally, as became apparent in the 1960s, Volkswagen was too slow and inefficient in developing new designs under him. While publicly championing the Beetle, beginning in 1952 Nordhoff spent DM200 million behind the scenes seeking to develop new models, some in partnership with other manufacturers, but his indecision led to the abandonment of all such prototypes. By the late 1960s, the Beetle faced serious competition from Japanese, American, and other European models in different markets. Ultimately, Nordhoff&#x27;s takeover of Auto Union in 1964 to provide still more manufacturing capacity for Beetles ended up both providing the group with both what would become its performance-luxury brand - Audi - and also the expertise to finally replace the Beetle and its tail-engined stablemates.

Nordhoff had wanted Carl Hahn, head of Volkswagen of America, to succeed him on his retirement, but the Board of Directors chose Kurt Lotz. Nordhoff had a heart attack in summer 1967, and although he returned to work in October, he died six months later, in April 1968; he was to have retired that autumn.

==Quote==
&quot;Offering people an honest value appealed to me more than being driven around by a bunch of hysterical stylists trying to sell people something they really don&#x27;t want to have.&quot; — Heinrich Nordhoff on his automotive philosophy, from the book &quot;Volkswagen: Beetles, Buses and Beyond&quot; by James Flammang.

<text>Black Diamond was a town in the Calgary Metropolitan Region of Alberta, Canada within the Town of Diamond Valley. It is at the intersection of Highway 22 (Cowboy Trail) and Highway 7. Its first post office opened in 1907. Black Diamond was so named because of coal deposits near the original town site. Little oil or gas remains.

It was a sister town to Turner Valley, and has a hospital, shops, hotels and residences, elementary school (K-6th grade), high school (7th-12th grade), hockey rink and a Boys and Girls Club.

Black Diamond is located in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies in the midst of some of Canada&#x27;s best ranch country.

A trail next to the roadway between Black Diamond and Turner Valley is named the Friendship Trail.

== History == 
Black Diamond incorporated as a village on May 8, 1929. After nearly 26 years as a village, Black Diamond incorporated as a town on January 1, 1956. 

On May 25, 2022, the Province of Alberta issued an Order in Council to amalgamate Black Diamond and Turner Valley to form the new Town of Diamond Valley, with an incorporation date of January 1, 2023. 

This followed decades of talk and a 2007 plebiscite that saw Turner Valley citizens embrace amalgamation and Black Diamond residents reject it. 

Ultimately, the prospect of efficiencies, 
and possible cost savings of $1 million a year became a major catalyst to approving the merger without a plebiscite. 

On January 1, 2023, the Town of Black Diamond amalgamated with its neighbouring Town of Turner Valley to form the Town of Diamond Valley.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Black Diamond had a population of 2,730 living in 1,178 of its 1,233 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 2,705. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Black Diamond recorded a population of 2,700 living in 1,098 of its 1,108 total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of 2,373. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.

== Government ==
Black Diamond was governed by a town council of seven including a mayor and six councillors. The final mayor of the Town of Black Diamond was Brendan Kelly.

Since January 1, 2023, the area of Black Diamond is governed by the Diamond Valley Town Council.

<text>Günter Wächtershäuser (born 1938 in Gießen) is a German chemist turned patent lawyer who is widely known for his work on the origin of life, and in particular his &quot;iron-sulfur world theory&quot;, a theory that life on Earth has hydrothermal origins. The hypothesis proposes that early life may have formed on the surface of iron sulfide minerals, hence the name. It was developed by retrodiction from extant biochemistry in conjunction with chemical experiments. The theory is consistent with the hypothesis that life originated near seafloor hydrothermal vents. He was encouraged and supported by science philosopher Karl R. Popper to publish his ideas. 
== Biographical background ==

Wächtershäuser, a chemist by training, has been an international patent lawyer in Munich since 1970. He has published numerous articles in organic chemistry, genetic engineering and patent law, and has made contributions to evolutionary theory concerning the origins of perception and cognition, and the origin of life.

== &quot;Metabolism first&quot; ==

One of the key ideas advanced by Wächtershäuser is that an early form of metabolism predated genetics. Metabolism here means a cycle of chemical reactions that produce energy in a form that can be harnessed by other processes. The idea is that once a primitive metabolic cycle was established, it began to produce ever more complex compounds. His model is known as the iron-sulfur world theory by analogy with the RNA world hypothesis.

== Awards ==

In 1993, Wächtershäuser received the annual award of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and the following year he was made an honorary professor at the University of Regensburg. In 1999, Wächtershäuser received the Bonn Chemistry Award and in 2008 he was made an adjunct professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

<doc id="394415" wikidata="Q110257515" url="?curid=394415" title="Rüppell's warbler">
<text>Rüppell&#x27;s warbler (Curruca ruppeli) is a typical warbler of the genus &quot;Curruca&quot;. It breeds in Greece, Turkey and neighbouring islands. It is migratory, wintering in northeast Africa. This is a rare vagrant to western Europe. The name is occasionally cited as &quot;Rueppell&#x27;s warbler&quot;.

== Taxonomy and etymology ==
Together with the Cyprus warbler it forms a superspecies with dark throats, white malar streaks and light remigial fringes. This in turn is related to the species of Mediterranean and Middle East &quot;Sylvia&quot; warblers that have a naked eye-ring, namely the eastern subalpine warbler, Sardinian warbler and Ménétries&#x27;s warbler. Both groups have a white malar area, but this may not form a clear streak in the latter group; above the white, the heads of males are uniformly dark.

The English name and the specific &quot;ruppeli&quot; commemorate the German zoologist and explorer Eduard Rüppell (1794–1884).

This is a monotypic species, meaning there are no recognised subspecies.

== Description ==
It is a typical &quot;Curruca&quot; warbler, similar in size but slimmer than the Sardinian warbler. The adults have a plain grey back and paler grey underparts. The bill is fine and pointed, with brown legs and red eyes. The striking male has a black head and, usually, a black throat, separated by a white malar streak (&quot;moustache&quot;). Females have a pale throat, and the head is grey rather than black. Their grey back has a brownish tinge. The song is a slower, deeper rattle than that of the Sardinian warbler.

== Ecology ==

=== Habitat ===
It breeds in dry and warm environments, including rocky areas, hillsides covered with scrub and maquis, and from sea level to altitudes of approximately 800–1000 meters. In some regions, such as southeastern Turkey, it has been observed at higher elevations up to 1500 meters, and on Crete, up to 1600 meters. This species occupies a diverse range of dry Mediterranean habitats, from forested areas with sufficient undergrowth to maquis with sparse tree cover. It favors open bushy woods of oak and cypress, as well as grassy and rocky terrain with varying densities of scrub cover. Compared to the closely related Sardinian warbler, Rüppell&#x27;s warbler is less reliant on tall and dense vegetation. During the non-breeding season, it frequents scrubby arid areas, as well as gardens, canebrakes, and hedgerows. On migration, it can be observed on bushy hillsides, mountain slopes, and in desert wadis with Acacia trees.

=== Breeding ===
The nest is a robust cup-shaped structure constructed from grass leaves and stems, often incorporating some vegetable down. The interior is lined with finer materials. Nests are typically situated in dense, often thorny scrub, at heights ranging from 45 to 75 centimeters above the ground. In Greece, egg-laying typically occurs from mid-April to mid-May. Clutches usually consist of four or five eggs.

=== Diet ===
This Insectivore passerine primarily feeds on adult and larval insects. However, its diet likely includes other arthropods as well. During the non-breeding season, it also enriches its diet with berries.

== Status ==
This species has an extensive range and a big population. The population trend is unknown, but it is not believed to be rapid enough to bring it to the threshold of vulnerability. For this reasons it is classified as &quot;least concern&quot; on the IUCN Red List.

The European population was estimated at 206,000 to 1,030,000 mature individuals. This represents approximately 95% of the global population, which is preliminarily estimated at 217,000 to 1,080,000 mature individuals.

<text>Victoria Park in Leicester, England is a public park of 69 acres (279,000 m2). It is in the south-east, just outside the city centre, backing on to the University of Leicester and close to the Leicester railway station.

==History==
The park was historically part of the South Fields of Leicester, and was used from 1806 to 1883 as a racecourse – a function that was then transferred to the purpose-built Leicester Racecourse in Oadby. It was opened as a park in 1882. A Victorian grandstand stood in the park until the mid-20th century, and was used as a pavilion after racing moved to Oadby. It was damaged by a German parachute bomb in 1940 and later demolished, with the new pavilion built on the same site and opened in 1958. Leicester Fosse (who later became Leicester City Football Club) played here on various occasions between 1884 and 1890.

==Facilities==

It has facilities for various sports, including tennis, basketball, bowls, croquet, football and cricket. A skate park has recently been added, and there is an adventure playground for young children. The majority of the park is level, open grassland and the largest space in particular is sometimes used as a venue for outdoor events – in recent years these have included BBC Radio 1&#x27;s One Big Sunday, the Leicester Caribbean Carnival, Leicester Pride and the Summer Sundae music festival, and BBC Radio 2 in the Park. Kasabian also had a sell out concert here with 50,000 tickets sold. A pavilion provides sports changing facilities, and is also the site of a cafe.

==Landmarks==

The park is home to two memorials. The Arch of Remembrance, a quadrifrons arch, was designed by Edwin Lutyens and built in 1923, to commemorate the dead of the First World War. The memorial, a Grade I listed building, stands at the top of an ornamental walkway (&quot;Peace Walk&quot;) with gates (also by Lutyens) opening on to University Road. A smaller memorial near the cafe commemorates the American 82nd Airborne Division, stationed in Leicester prior to D-Day. The gates and lodges on the London Road side of the park were also designed by Lutyens and built in 1930.

==Sport==
A parkrun takes place in the park every Saturday morning at 9am.

<doc id="394430" wikidata="Q312797" url="?curid=394430" title="Bill Bruford">
<text>William Scott Bruford (born 17 May 1949) is an English drummer and percussionist who first gained prominence as a founding member of the progressive rock band Yes. After leaving Yes in 1972, Bruford spent the rest of the 1970s recording and touring with King Crimson (1972–1974), Roy Harper (1975), and U.K. (1978), as well as touring with Genesis (1976). In 1978, he formed his own group, Bruford, which was active until 1980.

During the 1980s, Bruford returned to King Crimson for three years (1981–1984), collaborated with several artists (including Patrick Moraz and David Torn), and formed his own electric jazz band Earthworks in 1986. He then played with his former Yes bandmates in Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe, which eventually led to a very brief second stint in Yes. Bruford played in King Crimson for his third and final tenure from 1994 to 1997, then continued with a new acoustic configuration of Earthworks.

In 2009, Bruford announced his retirement from professional drumming. He pursued other projects, including the operation of his two record labels, Summerfold and Winterfold, releasing an autobiography, and speaking and writing about music. In 2016, Bruford received a PhD in Music from the University of Surrey. That year, Bruford ranked No. 16 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the &quot;100 Greatest Drummers of All Time&quot;. In 2017, Bruford was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Yes. In 2022, after a 13-year hiatus, he returned to live performance as a member of the Pete Roth Trio.

== Early life ==
Bruford was born on 17 May 1949 in Sevenoaks, Kent, the third child of Betty and John Bruford, a veterinary surgeon. He has a brother, John, and a sister, Jane. He attended New Beacon School in Sevenoaks, followed by Tonbridge School in Tonbridge, a boarding school. Bruford decided to take up drumming at thirteen after watching American jazz drummers on the BBC2 television series &quot;Jazz 625&quot;, and practised the instrument in the attic of his house. He cites Max Roach, Joe Morello, Art Blakey and Ginger Baker as the most influential drummers on him as a young man. Around this time, Bruford&#x27;s sister bought him a pair of drum brushes as a birthday present, and Bruford would practise using them on album sleeves after he was told the sound resembled a snare drum while watching &quot;Jazz 625&quot;. Bruford recalled it as &quot;a perfect education&quot;. Though he was given a single snare drum at first, Bruford gradually built a full drum kit. He later took a few lessons from Lou Pocock, a member of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.

During his time at boarding school, Bruford befriended several fellow jazz fans, one of them a drummer who gave Bruford lessons in improvisation and a tutorial book by American jazz drummer Jim Chapin. In 1966 and 1967, Bruford performed in the Breed, an R&amp;B/soul four-piece with Stu Murray on guitar, Mike Freeman on saxophone, Ray Bennett (who would later play with Peter Banks&#x27;s Flash) on bass, and Doug Kennard on guitar and vocals. After leaving school, Bruford took a gap year before he intended to study economics at Leeds University. In January 1968, he unsuccessfully auditioned for a place in Savoy Brown at a pub in Battersea, but he &quot;hung around until the end and told them they had the wrong guy ... I talked my way into it&quot;. His tenure only lasted three gigs because he &quot;messed with the beat&quot;, and followed this with a brief stint in the psychedelic rock band Paper Blitz Tissue. Bruford then spotted an ad in a music shop from the Noise, who were looking for a drummer to play with them for a six-week residency at the Piper Club in Rome, Italy. He remembered the experience as &quot;ghastly&quot;, felt his bandmates could not play properly, and had to hitchhike back to London with his kit.

== Career ==
=== 1968–1974: Yes and King Crimson ===
Following his return to London, the 19-year-old Bruford settled into a flat in north London and placed an advertisement for drum work in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. It was spotted by singer Jon Anderson of the psychedelic rock band Mabel Greer&#x27;s Toyshop, formed of bassist Chris Squire and guitarist Clive Bayley, who sought a replacement for their departing drummer, Bob Hagger. The four met on 7 June 1968; Anderson was so impressed with Bruford that he invited him to play with the band that evening at the Rachel McMillan College in Deptford. Their entire set consisted of &quot;In the Midnight Hour&quot; by Wilson Pickett as it was the only song they all knew how to play through, but Bruford was impressed with the band&#x27;s ability to sing in harmony. Following the gig, Bruford had several offers to join soul bands, one of which earned as much as £30 a week, but chose to remain with Anderson and Squire, who took charge in forming a new band. The four entered rehearsals, which ended in Peter Banks replacing Bayley on guitar, Tony Kaye on keyboards, and the group changing their name to Yes.

Bruford played on Yes&#x27;s first five studio albums during his initial tenure: &quot;Yes&quot; (1969), &quot;Time and a Word&quot; (1970), &quot;The Yes Album&quot; (1971), &quot;Fragile&quot; (1971), and &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; (1972). He received a writing credit on just five tracks: &quot;Harold Land&quot;, &quot;Yours Is No Disgrace&quot;, &quot;Heart of the Sunrise&quot;, &quot;And You and I&quot;, and &quot;Five Per Cent for Nothing&quot;, a 35-second track on &quot;Fragile&quot; that was his first attempt at composition. His main interest was allowing the drums to &quot;be heard&quot; as Squire played his bass often in the higher register, and so developed a style that involved &quot;unusual beat placement&quot; and time signatures. He developed his musical understanding during this time, learning &quot;how to read the horizontal lines, but not the vertical notes.&quot; Bruford recalled Yes being hot blooded and argumentative, with personality conflicts being the eventual reason for his exit. These, for him, included problems in understanding other members&#x27; accents, differences in social backgrounds, and many other issues that set the band in a constant state of friction between Anderson, Squire, and himself.

In July 1972, after &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; had been recorded, Bruford quit to join King Crimson, later explaining: &quot;King Crimson was one of the only gigs for a rock drummer where you could play in 17/16 and still stay in decent hotels&quot;. Rehearsals began in September 1972, followed by an extensive UK tour. His instinct to remember complicated drum parts was shown when he learned how to play the long percussion and guitar part in the middle of &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot;, &quot;by listening to it and just learning it.&quot; Bruford cites the six months free jazz percussionist Jamie Muir was in the band as highly influential on him as a player. Bruford is featured on &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic&quot; (1973), &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot; (1974), &quot;Red&quot; (1974) and the live album &quot;USA&quot; (1975). Robert Fripp disbanded King Crimson in September 1974.

=== 1974–1980: Genesis, Bruford, and U.K. ===
After leaving King Crimson, Bruford felt his &quot;sense of direction was rather stymied&quot; and was unsure on his next step. In late 1974, he became a temporary member of the Anglo-French band Gong for a European tour after drummer Laurie Allan was busted for drugs at a border. Bruford then chose to wait for an appealing offer while earning money as a session musician. The sessions were few, however, and the ones that he was a part of he called &quot;unmitigated disasters&quot;. In 1975, Bruford played drums on &quot;Fish Out of Water&quot; by Chris Squire, &quot;HQ&quot; by Roy Harper, and &quot;At the Sound of the Bell&quot; by Pavlov&#x27;s Dog. Later in the year, he performed as guest percussionist for the jazz fusion band Brand X, featuring Phil Collins on drums. Bruford then joined National Health for several live performances, but declined an offer to join full-time as there were already many writers in the group, and felt his contributions to the music, the majority of which was already written, would have caused problems.

By mid-1976, Bruford had rehearsed with Ray Gomez and Jeff Berlin in the US but plans to form a group failed, partly due to the members living far away from each other. He wished not to force a band together, so he decided to &quot;watch, wait, observe and absorb&quot;. From March to July 1976, Bruford toured with Genesis on their 1976 tour of North America and Europe, supporting &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot;. It was their first album and tour after original frontman Peter Gabriel had left, leaving drummer Phil Collins to sing lead vocals. Bruford had known Collins for several years and suggested sitting in the drum seat until Genesis found a permanent replacement. Bruford is featured on the &quot;&quot; film and the live albums &quot;Seconds Out&quot; (1977) and &quot;Three Sides Live&quot; (1982). In late 1976, Bruford became involved in a tentative rock trio with Rick Wakeman and John Wetton, but they soon disbanded. According to Bruford, &quot;A&amp;M Records was unwilling to let its &#x27;star,&#x27; Wakeman, walk off with a used, slightly soiled King Crimson rhythm section, and the idea folded.&quot; Bruford then rejoined National Health for a short stint.

In 1977, Bruford recorded his debut solo album &quot;Feels Good to Me&quot; (1978), with Dave Stewart (keyboards), Jeff Berlin (bass), and Allan Holdsworth (guitar). This was Bruford&#x27;s first attempt at songwriting on a substantial level, and he spent a lot of time developing tunes on the piano. The four stuck together and became a full-time band named Bruford, which also featured Annette Peacock on vocals, Kenny Wheeler on flugelhorn, and John Goodsall on rhythm guitar. Later in 1978, Bruford reunited with John Wetton and formed the progressive rock group U.K. After their debut album &quot;U.K.&quot; (1978) and several tours, Holdsworth and Bruford left the group due to disagreements on the group&#x27;s musical direction. Bruford resumed activity in his own group to release &quot;One of a Kind&quot; (1979). Almost entirely instrumental, the album contains some spoken lines by Bruford during the introduction to &quot;Fainting in Coils&quot;. Subsequent gigs spawned the live releases &quot;Rock Goes to College&quot; and &quot;The Bruford Tapes&quot; (1979). Their final album, &quot;Gradually Going Tornado&quot; (1980), features backing vocals from Canterbury scene stalwarts Barbara Gaskin and Amanda Parsons, as well as Georgina Born on cello. Unfinished songs for a projected fourth album were recorded in 1980, but remained unreleased until 2017.

=== 1981–1993: King Crimson, Earthworks, ABWH, and Yes ===
In 1981, Bruford returned to King Crimson in a new formation with Fripp, Tony Levin, and Adrian Belew. The four recorded &quot;Discipline&quot; (1981), &quot;Beat&quot; (1982), and &quot;Three of a Perfect Pair&quot; (1984), all featuring Bruford on an acoustic and Simmons electronic hybrid kit. Bruford embraced the Simmons drums for the next fifteen years as it allowed him to play programmed chords, samples, tuned pitches, and sound effects, which expanded his musical palette. In 1984, Fripp disbanded the group; Bruford picked the live album &quot;Absent Lovers: Live in Montreal&quot; (1998) as one of the best rock albums he played on.

In 1983, Bruford formed a duo with Swiss keyboardist and former Yes member Patrick Moraz after he learned that Moraz was living close to him in Surrey. The project had Bruford develop a &quot;real taste for improvising&quot;. Under the name Moraz/Bruford, the two released &quot;Music for Piano and Drums&quot; (1983) and &quot;Flags&quot; (1985), two albums recorded on acoustic instruments. The albums were supported with several live shows, including a tour of Japan. Also in 1985, Bruford was approached by Jimmy Page to be the drummer for his new band with Paul Rodgers and Pino Palladino named the Firm. He recalled: &quot;We rehearsed briefly, but I think decided we were mutually unsuited!&quot;

In 1986, Bruford formed his jazz group Earthworks with Django Bates, Iain Ballamy and Mick Hutton (later replaced by Tim Harries), with initial assistance from Dave Stewart. By then, electronic drum technology had improved to Bruford&#x27;s satisfaction and he resumed using the Simmons kit. The band toured the US club circuit through 1987.

Bruford put Earthworks on hold in late 1988, after Jon Anderson invited him to play on a new album that also featured past Yes members Rick Wakeman and Steve Howe. Bruford was under the impression that he was performing on an Anderson solo album, but the four went on to become a group and named themselves Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe (ABWH). Bruford later remarked that while ABWH could have been an interesting group had they been given time to develop instead of being pushed immediately into a recording studio, for him it was primarily a business-motivated arrangement which he took on so that he could pay for Earthworks. Bruford was attracted to the idea of recording on Montserrat, and convinced Anderson to have Tony Levin on bass. &quot;Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe&quot; (1989) was supported by a world tour, and in 1990, while recording a second album, ABWH merged with Yes to become an eight-member formation. &quot;Union&quot; (1991), featuring tracks from both groups, was criticised by almost the entire band; Bruford called it &quot;the worst record I&#x27;ve ever been on&quot;. He took part in the subsequent Union Tour in 1991 and 1992, and though he enjoyed the enthusiastic audiences in large venues and performing with former bandmates, he found the experience &quot;pretty horrible&quot;. After the tour, Bruford and Howe became involved in an orchestral project that reinterpreted Yes songs with an orchestra, entitled &quot;Symphonic Music of Yes&quot; (1993).

Bruford resumed with Earthworks in January 1991, and the group released a studio and live album. After Bates left, Bruford disbanded the group in 1993. After this, their record label pushed for Bruford and Holdsworth to form a new band, but neither were too keen on the idea and the idea fell through. In the early 1990s, Bruford became an active drum clinician and taught small groups in several universities.

=== 1994–2009: King Crimson, Earthworks II, final collaborations, and retirement ===
King Crimson re-emerged once more in 1994 as a six-piece band, consisting of its 1980s line-up with the additions of Pat Mastelotto sharing drumming duties with Bruford, and Trey Gunn on Chapman Stick. Dubbed the &quot;double trio&quot; configuration, they released &quot;Vrooom&quot; (1994), &quot;Thrak&quot; (1995), and two live albums, &quot;B&#x27;Boom: Live in Argentina&quot; (1995) and &quot;Thrakattak&quot; (1996). After Bruford and Fripp discussed the idea of holding improvisational performances together and invited Gunn and Levin to join them, Fripp conceived the ProjeKcts idea of having different subsets of King Crimson working separately as a way of developing new material for the band. The first group, ProjeKct One, performed live at the Jazz Cafe in London from 1–4 December 1997. Bruford then left the group, and King Crimson altogether, mainly due to his frustration with rehearsals, which he felt came to nothing. This also marked the end of Bruford using the Simmons electronic drums due to the high overhead costs, the time required to program the kit, and the lackluster Japanese model that was made after the original manufacturer went bankrupt.
After King Crimson, Bruford focused on acoustic jazz, partly because he felt jazz required a return to a beginning jumping-off point. In 1997 he formed a new line-up of Earthworks, using the group as a base for British musicians and to give them experience of performing internationally. This line-up involved pianist Steve Hamilton, saxophonist Patrick Clahar, and double bassist Geoff Gascoyne, soon replaced by Mark Hodgson. Although Earthworks underwent further line-up changes with Tim Garland replacing Clahar as saxophonist in 2001, Gwilym Simcock replacing Hamilton as pianist in 2004, and Laurence Cottle replacing Hodgson on bass circa 2005, the revived band maintained a consistent, predominantly acoustic post-bop approach focusing on Bruford&#x27;s compositions. During 2005, Earthworks temporarily combined with Garland&#x27;s Underground Orchestra to form the Earthworks Underground Orchestra.

During his final stint with Earthworks, Bruford collaborated with others in the final twelve years of his career. These included a collaboration with Americans Eddie Gomez and Ralph Towner in 1997, the jazz-rock band Bruford Levin Upper Extremities in 1998, a duo with Dutch pianist Michiel Borstlap from 2002 to 2007, the contemporary composer Colin Riley with the Piano Circus collective in 2009, and presenting drum clinics. In 2003, Bruford established two record labels: Winterfold Records, which cover his early releases including his guitar and rock-oriented music, and Summerfold Records, focusing on his jazz output, mostly from post-1987. Both are distributed by Voiceprint Records.

Bruford&#x27;s final public gig was with Earthworks on 31 July 2008 at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s in London. In January 2009, at the age of 59, Bruford announced that he was retiring from performing and recording, after 41 years, effective from 1 January. Among the various reasons for retiring were his growing performance anxiety that &quot;was making life intolerable&quot;, his diminishing stamina required to tour and perform on an international scale, and what he perceived as a bleak future for the style of drumming that appealed to him. The final studio album he played on was &quot;Skin and Wire: Play the Music of Colin Riley&quot; (2009) by Piano Circus. Bruford had kept a diary of his gigs throughout his career, and logged 2,885 gigs.

===2009–present: Hiatus and return to music===

In early 2009, Bruford published his autobiography. Not long into his retirement, Bruford had a brief, low key stint in Ann Bailey&#x27;s Soul House, a nine-piece band performing Motown and soul covers in Ewhurst, Surrey.

In February 2016, after four and a half years of study, Bruford received a PhD degree in Music from the University of Surrey. He had wanted to do something related to music following his retirement, and considered his missed opportunity in pursuing higher education in the late 1960s as a factor in his decision to enter academia. The University of Surrey offered to award Bruford an honorary doctorate, but he wanted to put in the effort and work for his degree, which focused on creativity and music performance, specifically with a drum kit. Bruford&#x27;s thesis, &quot;Making it work: Creative music performance and the Western kit drummer&quot;, was posted online in May 2016. Bruford has since written various journal articles, book chapters and liner notes, and presented guest lectures at universities and music institutions in Europe and North America.

In April 2017, Bruford was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a former member of Yes. He attended the ceremony, but did not perform or deliver an acceptance speech. In March 2018, Bruford introduced Yes at their two London shows during their 50th Anniversary Tour. Later that year, Bruford published his second book, &quot;Uncharted: Creativity and the Expert Drummer&quot;. It is an adaptation of his PhD dissertation.

In October 2020, Bruford put much of his personal collection of instruments, microphones, tour cases, and other equipment from his career, up for sale, totalling 258 separate listings. In August 2021, his back catalogue of music from Bruford, Moraz/Bruford, and Earthworks were made available on digital streaming platforms for the first time. In January 2022, Bruford launched his own YouTube channel to share videos from his career with additional &quot;thoughts and anecdotes&quot;. Later in 2022, a 6-CD career-spanning box set of tracks which he had played on was released entitled &quot;Making a Song and Dance: A Complete-Career Collection&quot;. This will be followed by a 3-CD archival set, &quot;The Best of Bill Bruford – The Winterfold &amp; Summerfold Years&quot;, in October 2024.

In 2022, after a 13-year hiatus from performing, Bruford joined the Pete Roth Trio, a jazz group led by guitarist Pete Roth who was his former drum technician over 20 years prior. Bruford described his return to drumming as &quot;explosive, unexpected, and very sudden. I remember passing someone else&#x27;s kit one day, sitting down, and feeling exhilarated all over, urgently and violently keen to start all over again.&quot; The band play small venues mostly in the south-east of England, and will tour through 2025.

On 3 August 2023, Bruford made an unannounced appearance at the John Wetton tribute concert in East Sussex, playing a live run-through of Bryan Ferry&#x27;s cover of &quot;Let&#x27;s Stick Together&quot;, which Wetton had played on, with Phil Manzanera, Guy Pratt, and Chris Difford.

=== Timeline ===
==Personal life==
Bruford married his wife Carolyn in March 1973; they live in Surrey. They have three children, including Alex, who was the drummer of the indie rock band Infadels.

At Bruford&#x27;s wedding reception, Jon Anderson met Jamie Muir, who inspired Anderson to read &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; which became the origin of Yes&#x27;s double album &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; (1973).

Bruford described himself as a &quot;lapsed atheist&quot;.

==Songwriting==
When interviewed in 1982, Bruford commented on his ability to compose for King Crimson. &quot;It&#x27;s very hard to know how to communicate in a band like that where the individuals are competent enough to produce their own kinds of sounds, it&#x27;s very hard to write for a band like that.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Many other drummers have cited Bruford as an influence, including Danny Carey, Mike Portnoy, Matt Cameron, Brann Dailor, Tim &quot;Herb&quot; Alexander, Gene Hoglan, Aaron Harris, Chad Cromwell, Ben Koller, Chris Pennie, Steve Arrington, Mac McNeilly, Morgan Simpson of Black Midi, Eric Kretz, and Martin Dosh. In addition, other artists have been quoted expressing admiration for his work including Neil Murray, Jimmy Keegan, and Adrian Younge.

== Awards ==
In 1990, the readers of &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; voted him into that magazine&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

<text>LGBTQ slang, LGBTQ speak, queer slang, or gay slang is a set of English slang lexicon used predominantly among LGBTQ people. It has been used in various languages since the early 20th century as a means by which members of the LGBTQ community identify themselves and speak in code with brevity and speed to others. 

LGBTQ slang has played an integral part in LGBTQ culture for decades. Slang language initially emerged as a way for queer people to communicate with one another while avoiding detection by mainstream society. Queer people have always existed, but historically, they have had to be discreet about their identities and lives, particularly when being LGBTQ was illegal and or socially condemned.

LGBTQ slang is used as a way to signal one&#x27;s identity and build solidarity within the community. When queer people use these certain words and phrases, they demonstrate to others that they are part of the LGBTQ community and share a common experience. This connection can create a sense of belonging for those historically rejected and isolated by mainstream society.

LGBTQ slang is also used by the community as a means of reclaiming language and deconstructing oppressive norms. Queer slang often includes playful references to sexual acts, which can serve as an assertion of sexual agency and a rejection of shame.

==History and context==

Because of sodomy laws and threat of prosecution due to the criminalization of homosexuality, LGBTQ slang has served as an argot or cant, a secret language and a way for the LGBTQ community to communicate with each other publicly without revealing their sexual orientation to others. Since the advent of queer studies in universities, LGBTQ slang and argot has become a subject of academic research among linguistic anthropology scholars.

During the first seven decades of the 20th century, a specific form of Polari was developed by gay men and lesbians in urban centres of the United Kingdom within established LGBTQ communities. Polari was featured on the BBC radio programme Round the Horne in 1964, exposing the wider public to the secret language. Although there are differences, contemporary British gay slang has adopted many Polari words. The 1964 legislative report &quot;Homosexuality and Citizenship in Florida&quot; contains an extensive appendix documenting and defining the homosexual slang in the United States at that time. SCRUFF launched a gay-slang dictionary app in 2014, which includes commonly used slang in the United States from the gay community. Specialized dictionaries that record LGBTQ slang have been found to revolve heavily around sexual matters.

Slang is ephemeral; terms used in one generation may pass out of usage in another. For example, in the 1960s and 1970s, the terms &quot;cottage&quot; (chiefly British) and &quot;tearoom&quot; (chiefly American) were used to denote public toilets used for sex. By 1999, this terminology had fallen out of use to the point of being greatly unrecognizable by members of the LGBTQ community at large.

Many terms that originated as gay slang have become part of the popular lexicon. For example, the word &quot;drag&quot; was popularized by Hubert Selby Jr. in his book &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot;. &quot;Drag&quot; has been traced back by the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) to the late 19th Century. Conversely, words such as &quot;banjee&quot;, while well-established in a subset of gay society, have never made the transition to popular use. Conversations between gay men have been found to use more slang and fewer commonly known terms about sexual behavior than conversations between straight men.

In the Philippines, many LGBTQ people speak with Swardspeak, or &quot;gay lingo&quot;, which is a more extensive use of slang as a form of dialect or way of speaking. Other argots are spoken in southern Africa (Gayle language and IsiNgqumo) and Indonesia (Bahasa Binan). More specifically, in a country like Thailand, LGBTQ slang was always present in their history due to their religious, behavioral, and social nature. However, before the term LGBTQ was introduced, the Thai community would use the terms Kathoey and Tom. The term Kathoey was used to describe transgender women who dress, act, or partake in surgery to become female, and the term Tom as well as &quot;handsome girls&quot; in Thai was used to describe women who liked women. Homosexuality and transgenderism has always existed throughout their history, as their behavioral nature did not align with heterosexual ideals.

* – a trans person who recently came out of the closet. The term is a noun
* – a transgender woman or girl who socially presents in a masculine gender role, typically in places where transgender individuals are discriminated against, or due to not being out as transgender. The equivalent for a trans guy is &#x27;girlmoder&#x27;. Many who use this term for themselves or others do not see the individual as a boy, necessarily. Rather, it is a term referring to the public presentation of being a boy/man, regardless of other factors.

* – a transgender person who has not yet realized they are trans; used by transgender people when aspects of one&#x27;s personality or behavior remind them of gender-related aspects of themselves before they realized they were trans. As such, the realization that one is trans is referred to as one&#x27;s &quot;egg cracking&quot;. This may also be used to refer to someone who is questioning their gender but later expresses themself to be cisgender. Although, this seems to be of less common use. Most &quot;egg&quot; related statements either refer to someone&#x27;s past self, before they would describe themself as transgender. Or, someone believed to be trans, but not open, regardless of whether they say they are at the time. However, this is a risky social move, as, that someone could later still describe themself as cis, be in the closet, or have a nonbinary identity that is neither considered necessarily cis nor trans to them. Or the label of &quot;trans&quot; is not to their liking or has too many connotations attached to it they dislike.
* or NBLNB (also NLN) – a term for attraction and relationship between non-binary people
* – a non-binary person. Derived from the abbreviation NB.

* repressor – a person who is fighting the wish to change their gender expression
* &quot;sapatrans&quot; or &quot;sapatrava&quot; (portmanteau of &quot;sapatão&quot; + &quot;trans&quot;) – a term used in Brazil for trans lesbians and lesbian travestis
* – a trans woman (short for &quot;trans girl&quot;). It is often derogatory, due to its association with transgender pornography

The following slang terms have been used to represent various types of people within the LGBTQ community:

* bear – a larger and often hairier man. The bear subgroup is among the oldest and largest of the LGBTQ community. Pride.com states &quot;Bears are on the heavier side, either muscular, beefy, or chunky. They wouldn&#x27;t dream of shaving their body hair (which comes in abundance) and they usually have a full beard to match.&quot; &quot;Attitude&quot; magazine describes bears as &quot;typically older&quot; with a big build, a belly, and lots of hair. There are many bear &#x27;subtypes&#x27;, including the black bear (Black or African American men), the brown bear (Hispanic men), the grizzly bear (&quot;dominant bears of extreme stature or hairiness&quot;), the koala bear (Australian men), the panda bear (men of Asian descent), and the polar bear, which represents an older bear with white hair

** bear chaser – a man who pursues bears
** otter – a man who is slender and hairy
** wolf – Pride.com says, &quot;Similar to an otter, a wolf has some hair and is in between a twink and a bear. However, there are some key differences between wolves and otters. Wolves typically have a lean, muscular build and are sexually aggressive.&quot; &quot;Attitude&quot; says wolves are &quot;typically older and masculine&quot; with a &quot;muscular/athletic build&quot;
* bull – Pride.com says a bull is a &quot;hunky, muscular&quot; bodybuilder who weighs 200 pounds or more.

* chicken – a young twink. &quot;Attitude&quot; says chickens are &quot;hairless and young&quot; with a slim or skinny build

<text>The Law of Return (, &quot;ḥok ha-shvūt&quot;) is an Israeli law, passed on 5 July 1950, which gives Jews, people with one or more Jewish grandparent, and their spouses the right to relocate to Israel and acquire Israeli citizenship. Section 1 of the Law of Return declares that &quot;every Jew has the right to come to this country as an &quot;oleh&quot; [immigrant]&quot;. In the Law of Return, the State of Israel gave effect to the Zionist movement&#x27;s aim for the establishment of Israel as a Jewish state. In 1970, the right of entry and settlement was extended to people with at least one Jewish grandparent and a person who is married to a Jew, whether or not they are considered Jewish under Orthodox interpretations of Jewish law.

On the day of arrival in Israel, or occasionally at a later date, a person who enters Israel under the Law of Return as an &quot;oleh&quot; would receive a certificate confirming their &quot;oleh&quot; status. The person then has three months to decide whether they wish to become a citizen and can renounce their prior citizenship during this time. Since 2005, the right does not apply to residents of the West Bank or the Gaza Strip due to the Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law. The right to an &quot;oleh&quot; certificate may be denied if the person is engaged in anti-Jewish activity, is a hazard to the public health or security of the state, or has a criminal past that may endanger public welfare. 

==History==

The Law of Return was passed unanimously by the Knesset, Israel&#x27;s Parliament, on 5 July 1950. The date chosen so that it would coincide with the anniversary of the death of Zionist visionary Theodor Herzl. It declared:

In a declaration to the Knesset, the then Israeli prime minister David Ben-Gurion asserted that the law did not bestow a right but rather reaffirmed a right Jews already held:

Follow-up legislation on immigration matters was contained in the Nationality Law of 1952.

Originally, the rights under the Law of Return applied only to Jews. However, due to an inability on the lawmakers to agree on a definition of &quot;who is a Jew&quot;, the Law did not define the term, relying instead on the issue to resolve itself over time. As a result, the Law relied in effect on the traditional halakhic definition. But, the absence of a definition of who is a Jew, for the purpose of the Law, resulted in divergent views of the various streams of Judaism competing for recognition.

Those who immigrate to Israel under the Law of Return are immediately entitled to citizenship in Israel. However, differences of opinion have arisen as to whether a person who claims citizenship under the Law of Return should be automatically registered as &quot;Jewish&quot; for census purposes. According to the halakhic definition, a person is Jewish if their mother is Jewish, or if they convert to Judaism. Orthodox Jews do not recognize conversions performed by Reform or Conservative Judaism. However, the Law provides that any Jew regardless of affiliation may migrate to Israel and claim citizenship.

===Jewish ancestry amendment===
The Law of Return was amended in 1970 to extend the right of return to some non-Jews. Amendment number 2, 4a, states:

The law since 1970 applies to the following groups:
* Those born Jews according to the Orthodox interpretation; having a Jewish mother or maternal grandmother.
* Those with Jewish ancestry – having a Jewish father or grandfather. 
* Converts to Judaism (Orthodox, Reform, or Conservative denominations—not secular—though Reform and Conservative conversions must take place outside the state, similar to civil marriages).

Jews who have converted to another religion are not eligible to immigrate under the Law of Return, even though they are still Jews according to halakha.

The 1970 amendment was induced by the debate on &quot;who is a Jew?&quot;. Until then the law did not refer to the question. There are several explanations for the decision to be so inclusive. One is that as the Nuremberg Laws did not use a &quot;halakhic&quot; definition in its definition of &quot;who is a Jew&quot;, the Law of Return definition for citizenship eligibility is not &quot;halakhic&quot; either. Another explanation is the 1968 wave of immigration from Poland, following an antisemitic campaign by the government. These immigrants were very assimilated and had many non-Jewish family members.

A second explanation is that in order to increase immigration levels so as to offset the &quot;demographic threat&quot; posed by the growth of the Arab population, the law expanded the base group of those eligible to immigrate to Israel.

A third explanation promoted by religious Jews is that the overwhelmingly secular leadership in Israel sought to undermine the influence of religious elements in Israeli politics and society by allowing more secular Jews and their non-Jewish spouses to immigrate.

The Israeli Rabbinate is a purely Orthodox body that is far more strict in defining &quot;who is a Jew&quot;. This creates a situation in which thousands of immigrants who are eligible for citizenship under the Law of Return&#x27;s criteria, are ineligible for Jewish marriage by the Israeli Rabbinate.

As of 2021, 3,340,000 Jews have immigrated to Israel since its independence in 1948.
Hundreds of thousands of people who do not have Jewish status under Orthodox Jewish interpretations of halakha received Israeli citizenship, as the law confers citizenship to all offspring of a Jew (including grandchildren) and their spouses.

==Denial of citizenship==
Section 2(b) of the Law of Return empowers the Minister of Interior to deny Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return on a number of grounds: For example, an applicant may be denied citizenship if they are considered a threat to the security of the State of Israel (e.g. treason against the Jewish State), or have a past criminal record involving a serious crime, such as murder, and pose a danger to the well-being of the State of Israel; or, for example, may be a fugitive in another country for any felony (unless they are persecution victims); or such persons who, by virtue of their illness, may pose a serious public health risk to the people of Israel; as also any person who may be actively engaged in any campaign that vociferously speaks out against the Jewish people and undermines their cause (such as demagoguery).

This provision has been used to exclude applicants a handful of times since Israel&#x27;s establishment. Notable cases include Robert Soblen, an American Communist who spied for the Soviet Union and fled to Israel in an attempt to escape a life sentence; Meyer Lansky, an American mobster who was initially granted entry to Israel but was expelled two years later; and Victor Vancier, an American Kahanist activist convicted of involvement in a series of bombings.

In 1962, the case of Oswald Rufeisen, born a Polish Jew and later a Catholic convert, came before the Israeli Supreme court. The Supreme Court decided that &quot;no one can regard an apostate as belonging to the Jewish people&quot;.

In 2024, Leo Franks, a Jewish Briton who was in the process of applying for Israeli citizenship, had his citizenship application closed and his deportation from the country ordered by the Ministry of the Interior. This came after he was arrested at an anti-war protest in Jerusalem and after having been detained twice in the West Bank, once when accompanying Palestinian shepherds and once when &quot;filming settler violence against Palestinians&quot;. Franks interpreted his deportation and denial of citizenship as a change to the Law of Return, saying to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency: &quot;the courts have given the Ministry of Interior free rein to make decisions about who can be a Jew in Israel on the basis of his politics&quot;. The lead editorial of both the English and Hebrew editions of the Israeli broadsheet Haaretz made the same claim about the political significance of Franks&#x27; case, titling the English-language version of the editorial as &quot;Only the Right Jews Can Make Aliyah in Today&#x27;s Increasingly Undemocratic Israel&quot;.

The granting of citizenship under the Law of Return does not prevent a person from being extradited back to another country under an extradition treaty with that other country.

==Controversy==
===Followers of Messianic Judaism===
The Supreme Court of Israel ruled in 1989 that Messianic Judaism constituted another religion, and that people who had become Messianic Jews were not therefore eligible for Aliyah under the law.

On April 16, 2008, the Supreme Court ruled in a case brought by a number of people with Jewish fathers and grandfathers whose applications for citizenship had been rejected on the grounds that they were Messianic Jews. The argument was made by the applicants that they had never been Jews according to halakha, and were not therefore excluded by the conversion clause. This argument was upheld in the ruling, and the government agreed to reprocess their applications. Despite this, Messianic Jews are considered to be eligible for the law if they can claim Jewish ancestry (having a Jewish father or grandfather).

===Claims of discrimination in relation to Palestinian refugees===
Critics claim that the Law of Return runs counter to the claims of a democratic state.

Palestinians and advocates for Palestinian refugee rights criticize the Law of Return, which they compare with the Palestinian claim to a Palestinian right of return. These critics consider the Law, as contrasted against the denial of the right of return, offensive and institutionalized ethnic discrimination.

A report by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) slammed the Law of Return, &quot;conferring on Jews worldwide the right to enter Israel and obtain Israeli citizenship regardless of their countries of origin and whether or not they can show links to Israel-Palestine, while withholding any comparable right from Palestinians, including those with documented ancestral homes in the country,&quot; as a policy of &quot;demographic engineering&quot; meant to uphold Israel&#x27;s status as &quot;the Jewish state&quot;. The report was later withdrawn following controversy.

===Same-sex relationships===
On June 10, 2011, the Law of Return was tested when a gay male couple, one Jewish and one Catholic, made Aliyah to Israel. This couple was the first same-sex, different religion married couple to request joint Aliyah status, although opposite-sex married couples of different religions receive joint Aliyah as a matter of course. The Jewish man quickly received citizenship but the decision of citizenship for his husband was delayed by the Ministry of the Interior despite the clause in the law saying the spouse of the Jewish returnee must also be granted citizenship. On August 10, 2011, the Ministry of the Interior granted citizenship to the non-Jewish husband as required by the Law of Return.

In 2014, Interior Minister Gideon Sa&#x27;ar announced that Jews in same-sex relationships who got married abroad but wished to immigrate to Israel were allowed to do so under the Law of Return, even with a non-Jewish spouse, and that both spouses would receive Israeli citizenship.

==Support for the Law of Return==

Supporters of the law say that it is very similar to those in many European states, which also employ an ethnic component.

Supporters argue that:

# The Law of Return is not the only way of acquiring citizenship. For example, non-Jews can become citizens by naturalization, residence, or marrying an Israeli citizen. Naturalization, for instance, is available under certain circumstances for the non-Jewish parents of a citizen who has completed their army service.
# The right granted to Jews along with their relatives under the Law does not necessarily or automatically discriminate against non-Jews, but is a form of &quot;positive&quot; discrimination. Israel has residency and citizenship laws for non-Jews that are equivalent to those in other liberal democracies. Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA) argues that the Law of Return is consistent with Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination Article I(3), which CAMERA says allows for preferential immigration treatment of some groups without discrimination against a particular group. Thus, CAMERA and others argue that other countries, including Germany, provide immigration privileges to individuals with ethnic ties to these countries (See Right of return and Repatriation laws).
# While the purpose of the Law of Return is perhaps to keep Israel predominantly Jewish, an argument states that a world where Jews have been persecuted, the concept of maintaining a Jewish state is necessary for the survival of the Jewish people generally and to provide a safe haven for Jewish refugees in specific cases. CAMERA argues the Law of Return is justified under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination Article I(4), which CAMERA argues allows for affirmative action, because of the discrimination Jews faced during the Holocaust. 
#Benjamin Pogrund, director of Yakar&#x27;s Center for Social Concern in Jerusalem and member of the Israeli delegation to the United Nations World Conference against Racism, calls the law &quot;unfair&quot; from the Palestinian refugees&#x27; point of view, but sees the unfairness as having happened in other places too. Pogrund compares the flight/expulsion of Palestinians (both in 1948 and 1967) to Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, India and Pakistan.

==Debate in Israel==
Among Israeli Jews, continued Jewish immigration enjoys strong support. According to a 2016 poll conducted by Pew Forum, 98% of all Jewish Israelis wanted the law to continue to allow Jewish immigration. However, some argue that the law permits the entry of too many non-Jews, undermining its purpose.

Support for the law among Israeli Arabs is much less. According to a poll overseen by Haifa University sociologist Sammy Smooha among 700 Jews and 700 Arabs conducted in 2017 only 25.2% &quot;accepted&quot; the Law of Return, down from 39% in 2015.

In September 2007, the discovery of a violent Israeli Neo-Nazi cell (Patrol 36) in Petah Tikva, made up of teenage immigrants from the former Soviet Union, led to renewed calls amongst politicians to amend the Law of Return. Effi Eitam of the National Religious Party and the National Union, which represent the religious Zionist movement and have previously attempted to advance bills to amend the Law of Return, stated that Israel has become &quot;a haven for people who hate Israel, hate Jews, and exploit the Law of Return to act on this hatred.&quot; On the other end of the political spectrum, MK Ahmed Tibi of United Arab List and Ta&#x27;al criticized the system&#x27;s double standard, stating that &quot;people immigrated to Israel and received automatic citizenship under the Law of Return, while citizens of Nazareth and Tayibe are not allowed to visit their own relatives merely due to the fact that they are Arabs.&quot;

Thirty-seven percent of Israelis polled said that deeper background checks on new immigrants would amount to racism against Jews from Russian-speaking countries.

==Applicability of the law==

Amongst those who are in favor of retaining the Law, controversy exists over its wording. The Law&#x27;s definition of a &quot;Jew&quot; and &quot;Jewish people&quot; are subject to debate. Israeli and Diaspora Jews differ with each other as groups and among themselves as to what this definition should be for the purposes of the Law of Return. Additionally, there is a lively debate over the meaning of the terms &quot;Jewish State&quot; and &quot;State of the Jews&quot;.

It is not only the Knesset, however, which has been repeatedly obliged to directly or indirectly address these issues. Over the years, many of Israel&#x27;s interior ministers have examined the issue of the Law of Return and wavered as to how to apply it. The judiciary has also been called upon to express an opinion on matters relating to the Law. This burning and recurrent question in the country&#x27;s political dialogue not only reveals but also exacerbates differences of opinion between Israelis.

One central issue is who has the authority over determining the validity of conversions to Judaism for purposes of immigration and citizenship. For historical reasons, the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, under the Israeli Ministry of Religious Affairs, made this determination, but this arrangement is in question. This practice has met opposition among non-Orthodox religious leaders both within Israel and in the diaspora. Several attempts have been made to resolve the issue, the most recent being the Ne&#x27;eman Commission, but an impasse persists.

On March 31, 2005, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled 7–4 that all conversions performed outside of Israel would be recognized by the authorities under the Law of Return, notwithstanding the Ne&#x27;eman Commission&#x27;s view that a single body should determine eligibility for immigration. The court had already ruled in 1989 that conversions performed outside of Israel were valid for the Law of Return (regardless of whether they were Orthodox, Conservative, or Reform). The 2005 ruling extended this, finding that overseas conversions were still valid even if the individuals did the preparatory work for the conversions while residing in Israel.

<doc id="394462" wikidata="Q843382" url="?curid=394462" title="Psyche (mythology)">
<text>Psyche (; ; ) is the Greek goddess of the soul and often represented as a beautiful woman with butterfly wings. The name Psyche means &quot;soul&quot; in Greek and was commonly referred to as such in Roman mythology as well, though the direct translation is &quot;Anima&quot; (Latin word for &quot;soul&quot;). She was born a mortal woman and eventually granted immortality, with beauty that rivaled even Aphrodite, goddess of love. Psyche is known from the novel &quot;The Golden Ass&quot;, also known as &quot;Metamorphoses,&quot; written by the Roman philosopher and orator Apuleius in the 2nd century. In the myth, she was given multiple trials to be with her beloved, Cupid (the Roman counterpart of the Greek Eros), god of physical love and desire and son of Venus. The cultural influences of Psyche&#x27;s story are depicted in art dating back to the 4th century BCE.

== In (Metamorphosis - The Golden Ass) ==
&quot;The Golden Ass,&quot; written in Latin, is fully survived and written in the 2nd century CE by Apuleius. The novel consists of eleven books, mainly surrounding a man named Lucius. Lucius, dabbling in magic, attempts to turn into a bird but after the spell goes wrong, turns himself into a donkey and goes on a journey where he eventually is restored to human form with the help of the goddess Isis. Along the way, he hears many stories, including tales about Socrates and the endeavors of a group of bandits. The biggest, most notable story Lucius hears on his journey is about Psyche and Cupid’s love story, spanning books 4-6.

== Mythology ==
=== Early life ===

In an unnamed kingdom, a king and queen had three beautiful daughters. The youngest, Psyche, possessed beauty that surpassed that of her sisters which resulted in those around her, including priests, comparing her to Aphrodite (referred to as Venus in &quot;The Golden Ass&quot;). Many went to the extent of saying that she was even fairer than the goddess herself. In other iterations, she is not compared to Aphrodite but mistaken for her.

Psyche&#x27;s beauty attracted people from all over distant lands to give gifts and offerings. When Aphrodite&#x27;s temples were neglected as a result, the goddess was outraged a mortal was being worshiped over her. As punishment, Aphrodite sent her son, Eros, to make the girl fall in love with a vile and hideous monster, as he could make anyone fall in love with the strike of his arrows. Cupid did as he was asked by approaching Psyche as she slept and touching her with one of his arrows. Psyche awoke, and although she did not see him because he was invisible, Cupid accidentally wounded himself with his own arrow and fell in love with her.

Meanwhile, both of her elder sisters were jealous of her beauty. Still, they eventually went on to marry kings and left to be with their husbands. Although everyone kept admiring Psyche&#x27;s beauty, it became apparent that she couldn&#x27;t find a suitor because they were happy to merely worship her instead of asking her hand in marriage The king and queen, deeply disturbed by this, decided to consult the Oracle of Delphi, also known as Pythia at the Temple of Apollo for answers. Apollo, speaking through the Oracle, said &quot;Despair, king. Your daughter will marry a beast even the gods fear. Dress her in funeral clothes and take her to the tallest rock spire in the kingdom. There, she shall meet her doom.&quot; The king returned heartbroken but obeyed the god&#x27;s orders.

=== Marriage to Cupid ===


After the king consulted the Oracle, Psyche was taken to the rock spire and abandoned to her fate. She waited for the beast, but it did not come. In some retellings, Cupid is there, only invisible. Zephyrus, the Greek lord of the west wind, carried her away from the rock and moved her to a place where she fell into a deep sleep. When she awoke again, she found herself in a palace made of gems and gold.

An invisible voice told Psyche to make herself at home and that everything belonged to her. She took a bath and ate a big feast, all while an invisible lyre played beautiful music to entertain her. It was then that Psyche learned that the invisible person was her new husband. He visited only at night, forbidding her to look upon his face or learn his name, saying that it was better for her to love him as an equal than to see him as something godly.

Psyche&#x27;s first weeks within the palace were filled with pleasures, and although she feared him at first, she eventually came to fall in love with the invisible man and soon fell pregnant. During the day, however, she became lonely, only looking forward to nighttime when her husband would visit. Eventually, she asked to see her sisters who, in her absence, had assumed her death and had been in mourning. Cupid eventually permitted her to invite her family to the palace, instructing Zephyrus to carry the sisters to the palace where they would be reunited.

When they arrived, her sisters gazed upon their sister’s good fortune and became jealous. They began to ask questions about Psyche’s husband, intending to trick her. At first, Psyche lied about who her husband was, claiming he was a hunter. With more prodding, Psyche finally admitted she had never seen her husband’s face and did not know his name. In anger and jealousy, they recalled the Oracle&#x27;s words and claimed that Psyche&#x27;s husband was not a kind man but in fact a monster, and that she should approach him in his sleep and kill him.

Psyche, although doubtful, was eventually swayed by her sisters&#x27; words and looked upon Cupid while he was sleeping, sneaking into his room with an oil lamp and a knife. As Psyche shone the light on her husband&#x27;s face, she realized that he was a god and reprimanded herself for her foolishness. However, as she shifted, a small drop of hot oil fell onto Cupid&#x27; shoulder, awakening him. Betrayed by his wife&#x27;s actions, Cupid took off in flight to be attended to by his mother, due to his burns from the oil lamp. As he disappeared, so did the palace, and Psyche found herself in a field near where her sisters lived. Distraught, Psyche told her sisters of what happened and they pretended to be saddened for her. Instead, the sisters were plotting to convince Cupid to take one of them to be his wife. The two traveled to the peak and jumped, thinking Zephyrus would catch them and take them to the palace as he did the last time. Zephyrus, however, knowing what was truly in their hearts, ignored them and the two sisters fell to their deaths. Upset and lost, Psyche wandered and searched for her lover. Demeter, the goddess of agriculture, pitied the girl and told her to go to Aphrodite and beg for forgiveness.

=== Psyche&#x27;s Trials ===

==== Sorting grain ====
While Aphrodite had been tending to her son’s injuries, she had learned about the secret marriage between Psyche and her son. When the girl came and begged for forgiveness, the angry goddess had Psyche whipped and tortured. Afterward, she was given barrels of grains, barley, wheat, beans, and poppy seeds mixed together to sort through and was ordered to have them sorted by evening. Psyche broke down in despair, but ants sent by Demeter witnessed the exchange and took pity on the girl, instructing her colony to help sort the grain. Aphrodite, surprised and enraged to see that the task had been completed, gave Psyche a new task.

==== Golden fleece ====
This time, she was ordered to approach a pack of rams known for being violent and shear their golden fleece to bring back to the goddess. Rather than be killed by these rams, Psyche planned on drowning herself in the river near the pack. As she prepared to do so, the river god spoke and said, &quot;Psyche, tried by much suffering, do not pollute my holy waters with your pitiable death.&quot; He then instructed her to wait until the rams calmed when the weather was cooler, for the animals would be less likely to attack her. Psyche listened to the river god and waited until it got cooler before she was able to safely shear the fleece off the backs of the rams.

==== The River Styx ====
Once that task had been completed, Aphrodite gave Psyche her third task: gather the black waters from the River Styx in a crystal cup the goddess had given her. Arriving near the river, Psyche once again began to despair, for getting to the river itself meant climbing up a treacherous cliff and risking her life. This time, it was Zeus who took pity on the girl and sent his eagle to retrieve the water for her in the crystal cup, thus successfully completing the third task.

==== A sample of beauty ====
For her fourth and final task, Psyche was given a golden box and ordered to travel to the Underworld to retrieve a bit of beauty possessed by Persephone, goddess of spring, and queen of the Underworld. Psyche, believing this last task was impossible, once again decided to take her own life. She climbed a tall tower and prepared to jump, but the tower spoke and instructed Psyche to go to the border of Sparta where she could find a passageway to the Underworld. Upon arriving, Psyche was surprised to find that Persephone willingly filled the box with her beauty. However, on her way back to give Aphrodite the box, curiosity once again overcame her and she opened it. Instead of finding a sample of beauty, she found a cloud of darkness that put her in a deep sleep.

=== The marriage of Psyche and Cupid ===
By this point in the story, Cupid had fully healed from his injury and took flight to find his love. When he found Psyche, he gently awoke her with an arrow and took the box to Aphrodite before going in search of Zeus to plead his case. The god of the sky agreed to help Cupid and Psyche in exchange for Cupid’s service the next time a beautiful maiden caught his eye and the deal was made. Zeus arranged an assembly, sending Hermes, the messenger god, to gather the gods together. At this assembly, Zeus warned Aphrodite not to ever bring harm to Psyche again before handing the girl the drink of the gods, ambrosia, which granted her immortality. Afterward, Psyche and Cupid were married and a big celebration and feast commenced. From then on, Psyche and Cupid had a child, Hedone, the goddess of pleasure, and Psyche became known as the goddess of the soul.

== Interpretations ==
Many interpretations have been made on the story of Cupid and Psyche, among them on the connections between love, trials, and the soul. According to the writer Fulgentius, the story could be read through a Christian lens in which Psyche is compared to Adam because both had curiosities that led them to be banished from paradise. The Italian poet Giovanni Boccaccio proposed that the marriage between Psyche and Cupid could be seen as the bond between the soul and God. Thomas Bullfinch wrote that the soul can be compared to a butterfly, in that the soul can be purified through trials and tribulations, just like a butterfly bursting from its cocoon. Other scholars believe it could be seen as an allegory for the soul’s journey for love, while some believe that just like butterflies, the human soul endures pain and change and can still have a happy ending.

== Gnostic narrative ==
Psyche is featured in the creation myth found in the ancient Gnostic text known as On the Origin of the World. Here she appears as a lover of Eros who pours her blood upon him and also upon the Earth, which causes the first rose to appear on the Earth from a thorn bush.

<doc id="394464" wikidata="Q2327934" url="?curid=394464" title="Iron–sulfur world hypothesis">
<text>The iron–sulfur world hypothesis is a set of proposals for the origin of life and the early evolution of life advanced in a series of articles between 1988 and 1992 by Günter Wächtershäuser, a Munich patent lawyer with a degree in chemistry, who had been encouraged and supported by philosopher Karl R. Popper to publish his ideas. The hypothesis proposes that early life may have formed on the surface of iron sulfide minerals, hence the name. It was developed by retrodiction (making a &quot;prediction&quot; about the past) from extant biochemistry (non-extinct, surviving biochemistry) in conjunction with chemical experiments.

==Origin of life==

===Pioneer organism===
Wächtershäuser proposes that the earliest form of life, termed the &quot;pioneer organism&quot;, originated in a volcanic hydrothermal flow at high pressure and high (100 °C) temperature. It had a composite structure of a mineral base with catalytic transition metal centers (predominantly iron and nickel, but also perhaps cobalt, manganese, tungsten and zinc). The catalytic centers catalyzed autotrophic carbon fixation pathways generating small molecule (non-polymer) organic compounds from inorganic gases (e.g. carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen sulfide). These organic compounds were retained on or in the mineral base as organic ligands of the transition metal centers with a flow retention time in correspondence with their mineral bonding strength thereby defining an autocatalytic &quot;surface metabolism&quot;. The catalytic transition metal centers became autocatalytic by being accelerated by their organic products turned ligands. The carbon fixation metabolism became autocatalytic by forming a metabolic cycle in the form of a primitive sulfur-dependent version of the reductive citric acid cycle. Accelerated catalysts expanded the metabolism and new metabolic products further accelerated the catalysts. The idea is that once such a primitive autocatalytic metabolism was established, its intrinsically synthetic chemistry began to produce ever more complex organic compounds, ever more complex pathways and ever more complex catalytic centers.

===Nutrient conversions===
The water gas shift reaction (CO + H2O → CO2 + H2) occurs in volcanic fluids with diverse catalysts or without catalysts. The combination of ferrous sulfide (FeS, troilite) and hydrogen sulfide () as reducing agents (both reagents are simultaneously oxidized in the reaction here under creating the disulfide bond, S–S) in conjunction with pyrite () formation: 
: FeS + H2S → FeS2 + 2 H+ + 2 e−

: or with H2 directly produced instead of 2 H+ + 2 e−

: FeS + H2S → FeS2 + H2
has been demonstrated under mild volcanic conditions. This key result has been disputed. Nitrogen fixation has been demonstrated for the isotope 15N2 in conjunction with pyrite formation. Ammonia forms from nitrate with FeS/H2S as reductant. Methylmercaptan [CH3-SH] and carbon oxysulfide [COS] form from CO2 and FeS/H2S, or from CO and H2 in the presence of NiS.

===Synthetic reactions===
Reaction of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and methanethiol CH3SH in the presence of nickel sulfide and iron sulfide generates the methyl thioester of acetic acid [CH3-CO-SCH3] and presumably thioacetic acid (CH3-CO-SH) as the simplest activated acetic acid analogues of acetyl-CoA. These activated acetic acid derivatives serve as starting materials for subsequent exergonic synthetic steps. They also serve for energy coupling with endergonic reactions, notably the formation of (phospho)anhydride compounds. However, Huber and Wächtershäuser reported low 0.5% acetate yields based on the input of CH3SH (methanethiol) (8 mM) in the presence of 350 mM CO. This is about 500 times and 3700 times the highest CH3SH and CO concentrations respectively measured to date in a natural hydrothermal vent fluid.

Reaction of nickel hydroxide with hydrogen cyanide (HCN) (in the presence or absence of ferrous hydroxide, hydrogen sulfide or methyl mercaptan) generates nickel cyanide, which reacts with carbon monoxide (CO) to generate pairs of α-hydroxy and α-amino acids: e.g. glycolate/glycine, lactate/alanine, glycerate/serine; as well as pyruvic acid in significant quantities. Pyruvic acid is also formed at high pressure and high temperature from CO, H2O, FeS in the presence of nonyl mercaptan. Reaction of pyruvic acid or other α-keto acids with ammonia in the presence of ferrous hydroxide or in the presence of ferrous sulfide and hydrogen sulfide generates alanine or other α-amino acids. Reaction of α-amino acids in aqueous solution with COS or with CO and H2S generates a peptide cycle wherein dipeptides, tripeptides etc. are formed and subsequently degraded via N-terminal hydantoin moieties and N-terminal urea moieties and subsequent cleavage of the N-terminal amino acid unit.

Proposed reaction mechanism for reduction of CO2 on FeS: Ying et al. (2007) have shown that direct transformation of mackinawite (FeS) to pyrite (FeS2) on reaction with H2S till 300 °C is not possible without the presence of critical amount of oxidant. In the absence of any oxidant, FeS reacts with H2S up to 300 °C to give pyrrhotite. Farid et al. have experimentally shown that mackinawite (FeS) has ability to reduce CO2 to CO at temperature higher than 300 °C. They reported that the surface of FeS is oxidized, which on reaction with H2S gives pyrite (FeS2). It is expected that CO reacts with H2O in the Drobner experiment to give H2.

==Early evolution==
Early evolution is defined as beginning with the origin of life and ending with the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). According to the iron–sulfur world theory it covers a coevolution of cellular organization (cellularization), the genetic machinery and enzymatization of the metabolism.

===Cellularization===

Cellularization occurs in several stages. It may have begun with the formation of primitive lipids (e.g. fatty acids or isoprenoids) in the surface metabolism. These lipids accumulate on or in the mineral base. This lipophilizes the outer or inner surfaces of the mineral base, which promotes condensation reactions over hydrolytic reactions by lowering the activity of water and protons.

In the next stage lipid membranes are formed. While still anchored to the mineral base they form a semi-cell bounded partly by the mineral base and partly by the membrane. Further lipid evolution leads to self-supporting lipid membranes and closed cells. The earliest closed cells are pre-cells (&quot;sensu&quot; ) because they allow frequent exchange of genetic material (e.g. by fusions). According to Woese, this frequent exchange of genetic material is the cause for the existence of the common stem in the tree of life and for a very rapid early evolution. Nick Lane and coauthors state that &quot;Non-enzymatic equivalents of glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway and gluconeogenesis have been identified as well. Multiple syntheses of amino acids from α-keto acids by direct reductive amination and by transamination reactions can also take place. Long-chain fatty acids can be formed by hydrothermal Fischer-Tropsch-type synthesis which chemically resembles the process of fatty acid elongation. Recent work suggests that nucleobases might also be formed following the universally conserved biosynthetic pathways, using metal ions as catalysts&quot;.

Metabolic intermediates in glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway such as glucose, pyruvate, ribose 5-phosphate, and erythrose-4-phosphate are spontaneously generated in the presence of Fe(II). Fructose 1,6-biphosphate, a metabolic intermediate in gluconeogenesis, was shown to have been continuously accumulated but only in a frozen solution. The formation of fructose 1,6-biphosphate was accelerated by lysine and glycine which implies the earliest anabolic enzymes were amino acids. It had been reported that 4Fe-4S, 2Fe-2S, and mononuclear iron clusters are spontaneously formed in low concentrations of cysteine and alkaline pH. Methyl thioacetate, a precursor to acetyl-CoA can be synthesized in conditions relevant to hydrothermal vents. Phosphorylation of methyl thioacetate leads to the synthesis of thioacetate, a simpler precursor to acetyl-CoA. Thioacetate in more cooler and neutral conditions promotes synthesis of acetyl phosphate which is a precursor to adenosine triphosphate and is capable of phosphorylating ribose and nucleosides. This suggests that acetyl phosphate was likely synthesized in thermophoresis and mixing between the acidic seawater and alkaline hydrothermal fluid in interconnected micropores. It is possible that it could promote nucleotide polymerization at mineral surfaces or at low water activity. Thermophoresis at hydrothermal vent pores can concentrate polyribonucleotides, but it remains unknown as to how it could promote coding and metabolic reactions.

In mathematical simulations, autocatalytic nucleotide synthesis is proposed to promote protocell growth as nucleotides also catalyze CO2 fixation. Strong nucleotide catalysis of fatty acids and amino acids slow down protocell growth and if competition between catalytic function were to occur, this would disrupt the protocell. Weak or moderate nucleotide catalysis of amino acids via CO2 fixation would favor protocell division and growth. In 2017, a computational simulation of a protocell at an alkaline hydrothermal vent environment showed that &quot;Some hydrophobic amino acids chelate FeS nanocrystals, producing three positive feedbacks: (i) an increase in catalytic surface area; (ii) partitioning of FeS nanocrystals to the membrane; and (iii) a proton-motive active site for carbon fixing that mimics the enzyme Ech&quot;. Maximal ATP synthesis would have occurred at high water activity in freshwater and high concentrations of Mg2+ and Ca2+ prevented synthesis of ATP, however the concentrations of divalent cations in Hadean oceans were much lower than in modern oceans and alkaline hydrothermal vent concentrations of Mg2+ and Ca2+ are typically lower than in the ocean. Such environments would have generated Fe3+ which would have promoted ADP phosphorylation. The mixture of seawater and alkaline hydrothermal vent fluid can promote cycling between Fe3+ and Fe2+. Experimental research of biomimetic prebiotic reactions such as the reduction of NAD and phosphoryl transfer also support an origin of life occurring at an alkaline hydrothermal vent .

===Proto-ecological systems===
William Martin and Michael Russell suggest that the first cellular life forms may have evolved inside alkaline hydrothermal vents at seafloor spreading zones in the deep sea. These structures consist of microscale caverns that are coated by thin membraneous metal sulfide walls. Therefore, these structures would resolve several critical points germane to Wächtershäuser&#x27;s suggestions at once:

# the micro-caverns provide a means of concentrating newly synthesised molecules, thereby increasing the chance of forming oligomers;
# the steep temperature gradients inside the hydrothermal vent allow for establishing &quot;optimum zones&quot; of partial reactions in different regions of the vent (e.g. monomer synthesis in the hotter, oligomerisation in the cooler parts);
# the flow of hydrothermal water through the structure provides a constant source of building blocks and energy (chemical disequilibrium between hydrothermal hydrogen and marine carbon dioxide);
# the model allows for a succession of different steps of cellular evolution (prebiotic chemistry, monomer and oligomer synthesis, peptide and protein synthesis, RNA world, ribonucleoprotein assembly and DNA world) in a single structure, facilitating exchange between all developmental stages;
# synthesis of lipids as a means of &quot;closing&quot; the cells against the environment is not necessary, until basically all cellular functions are developed.

This model locates the &quot;last universal common ancestor&quot; (LUCA) within the inorganically formed physical confines of an alkaline hydrothermal vent, rather than assuming the existence of a free-living form of LUCA. The last evolutionary step en route to &quot;bona fide&quot; free-living cells would be the synthesis of a lipid membrane that finally allows the organisms to leave the microcavern system of the vent. This postulated late acquisition of the biosynthesis of lipids as directed by genetically encoded peptides is consistent with the presence of completely different types of membrane lipids in archaea and bacteria (plus eukaryotes). The kind of vent at the foreground of their suggestion is chemically more similar to the warm (ca. 100 °C) off ridge vents such as Lost City than to the more familiar black smoker type vents (ca. 350 °C).

In an abiotic world, a thermocline of temperatures and a chemocline in concentration is associated with the pre-biotic synthesis of organic molecules, hotter in proximity to the chemically rich vent, cooler but also less chemically rich at greater distances. The migration of synthesized compounds from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration gives a directionality that provides both source and sink in a self-organizing fashion, enabling a proto-metabolic process by which acetic acid production and its eventual oxidization can be spatially organized.

In this way many of the individual reactions that are today found in central metabolism could initially have occurred independent of any developing cell membrane. Each vent microcompartment is functionally equivalent to a single cell. Chemical communities having greater structural integrity and resilience to wildly fluctuating conditions are then selected for; their success would lead to local zones of depletion for important precursor chemicals. Progressive incorporation of these precursor components within a cell membrane would gradually increase metabolic complexity within the cell membrane, whilst leading to greater environmental simplicity in the external environment. In principle, this could lead to the development of complex catalytic sets capable of self-maintenance.

Russell adds a significant factor to these ideas, by pointing out that semi-permeable mackinawite (an iron sulfide mineral) and silicate membranes could naturally develop under these conditions and electrochemically link reactions separated in space, if not in time.

== Alternative environment ==
The 6 of the 11 metabolic intermediates in reverse Krebs cycle promoted by Fe, Zn2+, and Cr3+ in acidic conditions imply that protocells possibly emerged in locally metal-rich and acidic terrestrial hydrothermal fields. The acidic conditions are seemingly consistent with the stabilization of RNA. These hydrothermal fields would have exhibited cycling of freezing and thawing and a variety of temperature gradients that would promote nonenzymatic reactions of gluconeogenesis, nucleobase synthesis, nonenzymatic polymerization, and RNA replication. ATP synthesis and oxidation of ferrous iron via photochemical reactions or oxidants such as nitric oxide derived from lightning strikes, meteorite impacts, or volcanic emissions could have also occurred at hydrothermal fields.

Wet-dry cycling of hydrothermal fields would polymerize RNA and peptides, protocell aggregation in a moist gel phase during wet-dry cycling would allow diffusion of metabolic products across neighboring protocells. Protocell aggregation could be described as a primitive version of horizontal gene transfer. Fatty acid vesicles would be stabilized by polymers in the presence of Mg2+ required for ribozyme activity. These prebiotic processes might have occurred in shaded areas that protect the emergence of early cellular life under ultraviolet irradiation. Long chain alcohols and monocarboxylic acids would have also been synthesized via Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. Hydrothermal fields would also have precipitates of transition metals and concentrated many elements including CHNOPS. Geothermal convection could also be a source of energy for the emergence of the proton motive force, phosphoryl group transfer, coupling between oxidation-reduction, and active transport. It&#x27;s noted by David Deamer and Bruce Damer that these environments seemingly resemble Charles Darwin&#x27;s idea of a &quot;warm little pond&quot;.

The problems with the hypothesis of a subaerial hydrothermal field of abiogenesis is that the proposed chemistry doesn&#x27;t resemble known biochemical reactions. The abundance of subaerial hydrothermal fields would have been rare and offered no protection from either meteorites or ultraviolet irradiation. Clay minerals at subaerial hydrothermal fields would absorb organic reactants. Pyrophosphate has low solubility in water and can&#x27;t be phosphorylated without a phosphorylating agent. It doesn&#x27;t offer explanations for the origin of chemiosmosis and differences between Archaea and Bacteria.

<text>Car of the Year (COTY) is a common abbreviation for numerous automotive awards.

The &quot;Car of the Year&quot; phrase is considered to have been introduced by &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine in 1949 when the new publication named Cadillac as Motor Trend Car of the Year.

Other publications and various organizations also have developed COTY recognitions. The Australian automobile magazine &quot;Wheels&quot; began an award in 1963.

In 1964, a jury of European automotive journalists began selecting the European Car of the Year award.

Many COTY awards focus on regional markets, vehicle types, or market segments. An example is the &quot;tow car of the year&quot; in the UK (for pulling travel trailers). or the COTY AJAC award in Canada.

*fitness for purpose
*real-world practicalities such as running costs, interior space and comfort, acceleration, handling, roadholding, ride comfort, noise levels, fit, finish, visual and tactile quality of the interior

<text>was a province of Japan in the area of modern Chiba Prefecture. It lies on the tip of the Bōsō Peninsula (房総半島), whose name takes its first &quot;kanji&quot; from the name of Awa Province and its second from Kazusa and Shimōsa Provinces. Its abbreviated form name was or . Awa Province in Shikoku phonetically has the same name, but is written with different &quot;kanji&quot; (阿波国).
Awa is classified as one of the provinces of the Tōkaidō. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Awa was ranked as a &quot;middle country&quot; (中国) and a &quot;far country&quot; (遠国).
==History==
Awa was originally one of four districts of Kazusa Province. It was well-known to the Imperial Court in Nara period Japan for its bountiful seafoods, and is mentioned in Nara period records as having supplied fish to the Court as early as the reign of the semi-legendary Emperor Keikō. On May 2, 718 the district of Awa was elevated into status to a full province. On December 10, 741 it was merged back into Kazusa, but regained its independent status in 757. The exact location of the capital of the new province is not known, but is believed to have been somewhere within the borders of the modern city of Minamibōsō, Chiba; however, the &quot;Kokubun-ji&quot; was located in what is now the city of Tateyama, Chiba as is the &quot;Ichinomiya&quot; (Awa Shrine) of the province.

During the Heian period, the province was divided into numerous &quot;shōen&quot; controlled by local samurai clans. These clans sided with Minamoto no Yoritomo in the Genpei War. The history of the province in the Kamakura period is uncertain, but it came under the control of the Yūki clan and the Uesugi clan in the early Muromachi period. However, by the Sengoku period, the Satomi clan had gained control over much of Awa, Kazusa and Shimōsa provinces. The Satomi sided with Tokugawa Ieyasu in the Battle of Sekigahara, but after being implicated in the political intrigues of Ōkubo Tadachika in 1614, were forced to surrender their domains for Kurayoshi Domain in Hōki Province, Awa became &quot;tenryō&quot; territory administered by various aside from five small domains created at various times in the Edo period (three of which survived to the Meiji Restoration), with an additional two domains created at the start of the Meiji period. The entire province had an assessed revenue of 95,736 &quot;koku&quot;.

The various domains and tenryo territories were transformed into short-lived prefectures in July 1871 by the abolition of the han system, and the entire territory of Awa Province became part of the new Chiba Prefecture on June 15, 1873.

==Historical districts==

<doc id="394493" wikidata="Q235077" url="?curid=394493" title="Jerry Goldsmith">
<text>Jerrald King Goldsmith (February 10, 1929July 21, 2004) was an American composer, conductor and orchestrator with a career in film and television scoring that spanned nearly 50 years and over 200 productions, between 1954 and 2003. He was considered one of film music&#x27;s most innovative and influential composers. He was nominated for eighteen Academy Awards (winning in 1977 for &quot;The Omen&quot;), six Grammy Awards, five Primetime Emmy Awards, nine Golden Globe Awards, and four British Academy Film Awards.

He composed scores for five films in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise and three in the &quot;Rambo&quot; franchise, as well as for films including &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot;, &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;, &quot;Patton&quot;, &quot;Papillon&quot;, &quot;Chinatown&quot;, &quot;The Omen&quot;, &quot;Alien&quot;, &quot;Poltergeist&quot;, &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot;, &quot;Medicine Man&quot;, &quot;Gremlins&quot;, &quot;Hoosiers&quot;, &quot;Total Recall&quot;, &quot;Basic Instinct&quot;, &quot;Air Force One&quot;, &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;, &quot;Mulan&quot;, and &quot;The Mummy&quot;. He also composed the current fanfare for the Universal Pictures logo, which debuted in &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;.

He frequently collaborated with directors including Paul Verhoeven, Franklin J. Schaffner, Richard Fleischer, Fred Schepisi, Michael Crichton, Jack Smight, Gordon Douglas, J. Lee Thompson, Paul Wendkos, John Frankenheimer, and Joe Dante.

==Early life and education==
Goldsmith was born on February 10, 1929, in Los Angeles, California. His parents were Tessa (née Rappaport), a school teacher, and Morris Goldsmith, a structural engineer. All his grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Austria-Hungary and Romania. He started playing piano at age six, but only &quot;got serious&quot; by the time he was eleven. At age thirteen, he studied piano privately with concert pianist and educator Jakob Gimpel (whom Goldsmith would later employ to perform piano solos in his score to &quot;The Mephisto Waltz&quot;) and by the age of sixteen he was studying both theory and counterpoint under Italian composer Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, who also tutored such noteworthy composers and musicians as Henry Mancini, Nelson Riddle, Herman Stein, André Previn, Marty Paich, and John Williams.

At age sixteen, Goldsmith saw the 1945 film &quot;Spellbound&quot; and was inspired by Miklós Rózsa&#x27;s unconventional score to pursue a career in music. Goldsmith later enrolled and attended the University of Southern California where he was able to attend courses by Rózsa, but dropped out in favor of a more &quot;practical music program&quot; at the Los Angeles City College. There he was able to coach singers, work as an assistant choral director, play piano accompaniment, and work as an assistant conductor.

==Film and television scoring==

===1950s and work at CBS===
In 1950, Goldsmith found work at CBS as a clerk typist in the network&#x27;s music department under director Lud Gluskin. There he began writing scores for such radio shows as &quot;CBS Radio Workshop&quot;, &quot;Frontier Gentleman&quot;, and &quot;Romance&quot;. In an interview with Andy Velez from BarnesandNoble.com, Goldsmith stated: &quot;It was about 1950. CBS had a workshop, and once a week the employees, whatever their talents, whether they were ushers or typists, would produce a radio show. But you had to be an employee. They needed someone to do music, and I knew someone there who said I&#x27;d be great for this. I&#x27;d just gotten married and needed a job, so they faked a typing test for me. Then I could do these shows. About six months later, the music department heard what I did, liked it, and gave me a job.&quot; He later progressed into scoring such live CBS television shows as &quot;Climax!&quot; and &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;. He also scored multiple episodes of the television series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. He remained at CBS until 1960, after which he moved on to Revue Studios and then to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for producer Norman Felton, whom he had worked for during live TV and would later compose music for shows produced by MGM Television such as &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot; and &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;.

His feature film debut occurred when he composed the music for the western &quot;Black Patch&quot; (1957). He continued with scores to such films as the western &quot;Face of a Fugitive&quot; (also 1957), and the science fiction film &quot;City of Fear&quot; (1959).

===1960s===
Goldsmith began the decade composing for such television shows as &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, and &quot;Thriller&quot; as well as the drama film &quot;The Spiral Road&quot; (1962). However, he only began receiving widespread name recognition after his intimate score to the western &quot;Lonely Are the Brave&quot; (1962). His involvement in the picture was the result of a recommendation by composer Alfred Newman who had been impressed with Goldsmith&#x27;s score on the television show &quot;Thriller&quot; and took it upon himself to recommend Goldsmith to the head of Universal&#x27;s music department, despite having never met him. That same year, Goldsmith composed the mostly atonal and dissonant score to the biopic &quot;&quot; (1962) that focused on a five-year period of the life of psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. Goldsmith&#x27;s score led to him gaining his first Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score, though he lost to fellow first-time nominee Maurice Jarre for his music to &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (also 1962). Goldsmith composed a score to &quot;The Stripper&quot; (1963), his first collaboration with director Franklin J. Schaffner for whom Goldsmith would later score the films &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (1968), &quot;Patton&quot; (1970), &quot;Papillon&quot; (1973), &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot; (1977), &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot; (1978) and &quot;Lionheart&quot; (1987).

Following his success with &quot;Lonely Are the Brave&quot; and &quot;Freud&quot;, Goldsmith composed the theme music for &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; (1964), and scores to such films as the western &quot;Rio Conchos&quot;, the political thriller &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; (both also 1964), the romantic drama &quot;A Patch of Blue&quot; (1965), the war film &quot;In Harm&#x27;s Way&quot; (also 1965), the World War I air combat film &quot;The Blue Max&quot; (1966), the period naval war drama &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; (also 1966), the thriller &quot;Warning Shot&quot; (1967), the western &quot;Hour of the Gun&quot; (also 1967), and the mystery &quot;The Detective&quot; (1968). He almost did not accept the assignment for &quot;The Blue Max&quot; when he watched the final cut with the producers who had temp-tracked it with Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra&quot;. He said: &quot;I admit it worked fairly well but my first reaction was to get up and walk away from the job, but I couldn&#x27;t. Once you&#x27;ve heard music like that with the picture, it makes your own scoring more difficult to arrive at, it clouds your thinking.&quot; Goldsmith&#x27;s scores to &quot;A Patch of Blue&quot; and &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; garnered him his second and third Academy Award nominations, respectively, and were both one of the 250 nominees for the American Film Institute&#x27;s top twenty-five American film scores. His scores for &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; and &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; also garnered Goldsmith his first two respective Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Original Score in 1965 and 1967. During this time, he also composed for many lighter, comedic films such as the family comedy &quot;The Trouble with Angels&quot; (1966), the James Bond parodies &quot;Our Man Flint&quot; (1966) and its sequel &quot;In Like Flint&quot; (1967), and the comedy &quot;The Flim-Flam Man&quot; (1967).

Goldsmith gained attention for the score of the post-apocalyptic science fiction film &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (1968), which was one of the first to be written entirely in an Avant garde style. When scoring &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, Goldsmith used such innovative techniques as looping drums into an echoplex, using the orchestra to imitate the grunting sounds of apes, having horns blown without mouthpieces, and instructing the woodwind players to finger their keys without using any air. He also used stainless steel mixing bowls, among other objects, to create unique percussive sounds. The score resulted in another Goldsmith nomination for the Best Original Score Oscar and ranks in 18 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s top twenty-five American film scores. Though he did not return to compose for its sequel &quot;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&quot; (1970), Goldsmith scored the third installment in the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; franchise, &quot;Escape from the Planet of the Apes&quot; (1971).

Goldsmith concluded the decade with scores to such films as the western &quot;Bandolero!&quot; (1968), the spy thriller &quot;The Chairman&quot;, the science fiction film &quot;The Illustrated Man&quot;, and the western &quot;100 Rifles&quot; (all 1969). He composed the theme for the comedy-drama television series &quot;Room 222&quot; which debuted in 1969.

===1970s===
Throughout the score for the World War II biographical film &quot;Patton&quot; (1970), Goldsmith used an echoplex to loop recorded sounds of &quot;call to war&quot; triplets played on the trumpet that musically represented General George S. Patton&#x27;s belief in reincarnation. The main theme also consisted of a symphonic march accompanied by a pipe organ to represent the protagonist&#x27;s militaristic and deeply religious nature. The film&#x27;s music subsequently earned Goldsmith an Oscar nomination for Best Original Score and was one of the American Film Institute&#x27;s 250 nominees for the top twenty-five American film scores. Goldsmith&#x27;s critical success continued with his emotional score to the prison escape film &quot;Papillon&quot; (1973), which also earned him an Academy Award nomination. In the early 1970s, Goldsmith also wrote the themes for two wildly different TV series, &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot; and &quot;The Waltons&quot;.

Goldsmith was faced with the daunting task of replacing a score by composer Phillip Lambro to the neo-film noir &quot;Chinatown&quot; (1974). With only ten days to compose and record an entirely new score, Goldsmith quickly produced a score that mixed an eastern music sound with elements of jazz in an ensemble that only featured a trumpet, four pianos, four harps, two percussionists, and a string section. Goldsmith received an Academy Award nomination for his efforts though he lost to Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola for &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;. The score to &quot;Chinatown&quot; ranks 9 on the AFI&#x27;s list of top 25 American film scores. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score.

Goldsmith earned further critical praise with his score to the period adventure film &quot;The Wind and the Lion&quot; (1975), which relied upon a diverse ensemble including many Moroccan instruments and a large percussion section. The score garnered Goldsmith an Oscar nomination for Best Original Score, though he lost to John Williams for his score to &quot;Jaws&quot;. &quot;The Wind and the Lion&quot; was also one of the AFI&#x27;s 250 nominees for the top twenty-five American film scores.

Goldsmith composed a dark choral score to the horror film &quot;The Omen&quot; (1976), which was the first film score to feature the use of a choir in an avant-garde style. The score was successful among critics and garnered Goldsmith his only Academy Award for Best Original Score and a nomination for Best Original Song for &quot;Ave Satani&quot;. His wife, Carol Heather Goldsmith, also wrote lyrics and performed a vocal track titled &quot;The Piper Dreams&quot; released solely on the soundtrack album. Goldsmith would go on to compose for two more entries in the franchise; &quot;Damien - Omen II&quot; (1978) and &quot;Omen III: The Final Conflict&quot; (1981).

He continued to have critical success with scores to such films as the dystopian science fiction &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot; (1976), the period drama &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot; (1977, a score which remained one of his personal favorites), the science fiction suspense &quot;Coma&quot; (1978), the science fiction thriller &quot;Capricorn One&quot; (1977), the disaster film &quot;The Swarm&quot; (1978), the period comedy &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; (also 1978), and his Academy Award-nominated score to the science fiction thriller &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot; (1978), in which he utilized lively waltzes juxtaposed against the film&#x27;s concept of cloning Adolf Hitler.

Goldsmith composed a score to the science fiction film &quot;Alien&quot; (1979). His score featured an orchestra augmented by an Indian conch horn, didgeridoo, steel drum, and serpent (a 16th-century instrument), while creating further &quot;alien&quot; sounds by delaying string pizzicati through an echoplex. Many of the instruments were used in such atypical ways they were virtually unidentifiable. His score was, however, heavily edited during post-production and Goldsmith was required to rewrite music for several scenes. The final score resulted in several pieces being moved, replaced, or cut entirely. Director Ridley Scott and editor Terry Rawlings also, without Goldsmith&#x27;s consent, purchased the rights to the &quot;Main Title&quot; from &quot;&quot; (1962) which they used during the acid blood sequence. Despite the heavy edits and rewrites, Goldsmith&#x27;s score for the film earned him a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Original Score and was one of the AFI&#x27;s 250 nominees for the top twenty-five American film scores.

Goldsmith concluded the decade composing the score for &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; (1979). Having been Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s initial choice to compose the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; pilot &quot;The Cage&quot; yet being unable to do so due to scheduling conflicts, Goldsmith was the first pick of both Paramount Pictures and director Robert Wise to compose a score for &quot;The Motion Picture&quot;. Faced with composing a new &quot;Star Trek&quot; theme for the film, Goldsmith initially struggled for inspiration, and proceeded to compose as much of the score as possible before the need to develop the main title theme. His initial score for the scene in which the newly-refit Starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; is revealed to the audience was not well received by the filmmakers, director Robert Wise feeling that it lacked a strong thematic hook and evoked sailing ships. Though somewhat irked by its rejection, Goldsmith consented to re-work his initial idea and finally arrived at the &quot;Star Trek&quot; theme which was ultimately used. The film&#x27;s soundtrack also provided a debut for the Blaster Beam, an electronic instrument long, created by musician Craig Huxley. The Blaster had steel wires connected to amplifiers fitted to the main piece of aluminum; the device was played with an artillery shell. Goldsmith heard it and immediately decided to use it for V&#x27;Ger&#x27;s cues. An enormous pipe organ first plays the V&#x27;Ger theme on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s approach, a literal indication of the machine&#x27;s power. His score for &quot;The Motion Picture&quot; earned him Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations, and was one of the AFI&#x27;s 250 nominees for the top twenty-five American film scores. Goldsmith would later compose the scores for &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot; (1989) (which included a revised arrangement of the theme from &quot;The Motion Picture&quot;), &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; (1996), &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot; (1998), and &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; (2002), as well as the theme to the television series &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; in 1995. In addition, his theme for &quot;The Motion Picture&quot;, as arranged by Dennis McCarthy, was reused as the theme for &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; in 1987.

===1980s===
Throughout the 1980s, Goldsmith found himself increasingly scoring science fiction and fantasy films in the ongoing wake of &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), composing for such films as &quot;The Omen&quot; sequels &quot;&quot; (1978) and &quot;Omen III: The Final Conflict&quot; (1981), space western &quot;Outland&quot; (1981), animated fantasy &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot; (1982), and the film adaptation of The Twilight Zone, which he composed in four different styles to accompany the film&#x27;s four stories.

Goldsmith was hired to compose the music to the Tobe Hooper-directed horror film &quot;Poltergeist&quot; (1982). He wrote several themes for the film including a gentle lullaby for the protagonist Carol Anne and her family&#x27;s suburban life, a semi-religious theme for scenes concerning the souls trapped between the two worlds, and bombastic atonal bursts during scenes of horror. The film&#x27;s score garnered him an Oscar nomination, though he lost again to John Williams for Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;.

He did, however, still manage to compose for such non-fantasy productions as the period television miniseries &quot;Masada&quot; (1981) winning an Emmy Award, the war film &quot;Inchon&quot; (1982), the action adventure &quot;First Blood&quot; (also 1982), and his Oscar- and Golden Globe Award-nominated score to political drama &quot;Under Fire&quot; (1983) in which he used the ethnic sounds of a South American pan flute, synthetic elements, and the prominently featured solo work of jazz guitarist Pat Metheny.

Throughout the decade, many of his compositions became increasingly laced with synthetic elements such as his scores for the horror sequel &quot;Psycho II&quot; (1983), the comedy horror film &quot;Gremlins&quot; (1984, winning a Saturn Award for Best Music), the fantasy superhero adaptation &quot;Supergirl&quot; (1984), Ridley Scott fantasy &quot;Legend&quot; (1985, initially heard only in European prints and then years later in a 2002 director&#x27;s cut), action sequel &quot;&quot; (1985), family fantasy &quot;&quot; (also 1985), and horror movie sequel &quot;Poltergeist II&quot; (1986), a more synthetic score than the original and the first of two sequels. He garnered another Oscar nomination for his innovative, critically acclaimed score to sports drama &quot;Hoosiers&quot; (1986), though he lost to Herbie Hancock for &quot;Round Midnight&quot;. The score incorporates synthesizers, orchestra, and the recorded sounds of basketball hits on a gymnasium floor.
During the same period, Goldsmith scored the Michael Crichton film &quot;Runaway&quot; (1984), the composer&#x27;s first all-electronic score. In an interview with &quot;Keyboard&quot; magazine in 1984, Goldsmith said that in order to simulate the ambiance of a real orchestra, several speakers were set up in an actual orchestra hall similar to how they would be arranged if they were live players. The playback was re-recorded to capture the feel of the hall.

Goldsmith finished out the decade with noteworthy scores to such films as the science-fiction fantasy family film &quot;Explorers&quot; (1985), medieval adventure &quot;Lionheart&quot;, science fiction comedy &quot;Innerspace&quot; (both 1987), action film &quot;Rambo III&quot; (1988), the science fiction horror &quot;Leviathan&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot; (both 1989), his second &quot;Star Trek&quot; film score. Goldsmith&#x27;s score to &quot;Leviathan&quot; incorporated the use of recorded whale sounds during the main titles. His comedy score to &quot;The &#x27;Burbs&quot; (1989) made use of pipe organ, recorded dog barking sound effects, and for parodying the trumpet &quot;call to war&quot; triplets on an echoplex from his previous score to &quot;Patton&quot; (1970).

===1990s===
Receiving critical acclaim for his music for the romantic drama &quot;The Russia House&quot; (1990), Goldsmith&#x27;s score featured a unique mixture of Russian music and jazz to complement the nationalities and characteristics of the two main characters. He also composed critically acclaimed music for the science fiction action film &quot;Total Recall&quot; (also 1990), which Goldsmith later regarded as one of his best scores. Other scores of the era include &quot;Gremlins 2: The New Batch&quot; (also 1990, a film in which Goldsmith also made a brief cameo appearance), the psychological thriller &quot;Sleeping with the Enemy&quot; (1991), the family comedy &quot;Mom and Dad Save the World&quot;, the fantasy romance &quot;Forever Young&quot; (both 1992), the thriller &quot;The Vanishing&quot;, and the family comedy &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; (both 1993). Goldsmith also composed a critically acclaimed score for the medical drama &quot;Medicine Man&quot; (1992). In concert, Goldsmith would later recount a story of how actor Sean Connery copied Goldsmith&#x27;s signature ponytail hairstyle for his character Robert Campbell in the film.

Goldsmith composed and conducted a score to the erotic thriller &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; (1992). The soundtrack, an unsettling hybrid of orchestral and electronic elements, garnered him another Oscar nomination as well as a Golden Globe Award nomination and was later regarded by the composer as one of his most challenging works. He wrote an acclaimed score for the classic sports film &quot;Rudy&quot; (1993), which has since been used in the trailers for numerous films including &quot;Angels in the Outfield&quot; (1994), &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; (1997), &quot;&quot; (2002), and &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; (2003). It was also heard on the TV spot of &quot;The Little Vampire&quot; (2000) and an Arnold Schwarzenegger fitness commercial.
Goldsmith composed acclaimed scores for such films as the superhero adaptation &quot;The Shadow&quot;, the thriller &quot;The River Wild&quot;, the romantic comedy &quot;I.Q.&quot; (all 1994), the science fiction drama &quot;Powder&quot;, the action film &quot;Congo&quot;, the fantasy adventure &quot;First Knight&quot; (all 1995), the action film &quot;Executive Decision&quot;, and his third &quot;Star Trek&quot; film installment &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; (both 1996) which he composed with his son Joel Goldsmith. Goldsmith also composed the theme for the UPN series &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; (which debuted in 1995) for which he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Theme Music. In 2020, &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine said that the &quot;Voyager&quot; theme was the best of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series&#x27; theme songs.

Goldsmith composed the critically successful score to the horror action film &quot;The Ghost and the Darkness&quot; (1996) which featured a traditional Irish folk melody interwoven with African rhythms. He was hired to replace a score by Randy Newman for &quot;Air Force One&quot; (1997). Goldsmith, with the assistance of composer Joel McNeely, completed the brassy, heroic score in only twelve days. Goldsmith also composed a percussive, jazzy score for the critically acclaimed crime drama &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; (also 1997). His score garnered him Oscar and Golden Globe Award nominations, and was also one of the AFI&#x27;s 250 nominees for the top twenty-five American film scores.

Goldsmith composed a new theme for the Universal Pictures opening logo, first heard in &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; (1997) and the short version for the Universal Television closing logo, first heard on &quot;The Tom Show&quot;. The studio continues to use this theme, with a new arrangement of it scored by Brian Tyler to accompany the studio&#x27;s current opening logo, introduced with &quot;The Lorax&quot; (2012) to coincide with the celebration of the studio&#x27;s 100th anniversary. Goldsmith also continued with scores for such films as the 1997 survival drama &quot;The Edge&quot; (also 1997), his fourth &quot;Star Trek&quot; film installment, &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot; (1998), the science fiction horror &quot;Deep Rising&quot;, the action thriller &quot;U.S. Marshals&quot; and the science fiction film &quot;Small Soldiers&quot; (all also 1998). He also composed a score of combined Eastern, orchestral, and synthetic elements for the Disney-animated film &quot;Mulan&quot; (also 1998), which subsequently earned him his final Oscar and Golden Globe Award nominations along with songwriter Matthew Wilder and lyricist David Zippel.

Goldsmith concluded the decade with critically successful scores to such popular films as action adventure horror &quot;The Mummy&quot;, the horror film &quot;The Haunting&quot;, and the action adventure &quot;The 13th Warrior&quot; (1999). In 1999, he also composed &quot;Fanfare for Oscar&quot; for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

===2000s and final scores===
During the early years of the 2000s, Goldsmith composed scores to the science fiction thriller &quot;Hollow Man&quot; (2000), the mystery film &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot;, the drama &quot;The Last Castle&quot; (both 2001), the action/political thriller &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot;, and his last &quot;Star Trek&quot; film &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; (both 2002). Goldsmith had composed the scores to five of the first ten &quot;Star Trek&quot; movies up to that point. Goldsmith also composed an original score to the simulator attraction &quot;Soarin&#x27; Over California&quot; which debuted February 8, 2001 at the Disneyland Resort, and the same attraction &quot;Soarin″&quot; which opened May 5, 2005 in Epcot at the Walt Disney World Resort. It was later said that when Goldsmith first rode the ride, he left in tears and said, &quot;I&#x27;d do anything to be part of this project. I&#x27;d even score the film for free.&quot;

Goldsmith&#x27;s final cinematic score, composed during declining health, was the critically acclaimed music for the live-action/animated hybrid film &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot; (2003), directed by long-time Goldsmith collaborator Joe Dante. One of his last works was with another long-time collaborator, Richard Donner (for whom Goldsmith had scored &quot;The Omen&quot; in 1976), on the science fiction film &quot;Timeline&quot; (also 2003). However, due to a complicated post-production process, Goldsmith&#x27;s score had to be replaced. Goldsmith&#x27;s score was used for the preliminary cuts. But the score didn&#x27;t fit the later cuts of the film and had to be re-scored. Goldsmith&#x27;s unavailability led to composer Brian Tyler taking over. Goldsmith&#x27;s unused score was later released on CD, September 7, 2004 through Varèse Sarabande, less than two months after his death in July. The album quickly became out of print.

=== Studio fanfares ===
Goldsmith composed the fanfares accompanying the production logos for multiple major film studios. He composed the 1976 fanfare for Paramount Pictures, which was used mainly for their home video label, as well as the 1988 Carolco Pictures fanfare and the Cinergi Pictures fanfare, with Bruce Broughton conducting the Sinfonia of London&#x27;s performance of it.

With the release of &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;, his 1997 opening fanfare for Universal Pictures debuted. His work on the fanfare would later be re-composed by John Williams for the 20th anniversary of &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, a film in which Williams composed the film&#x27;s score, with a customized fanfare, merging the Universal fanfare and the film&#x27;s main theme, and the full Universal fanfare, only used in &quot;The Scorpion King&quot;; and composed and arranged by Brian Tyler for the studio&#x27;s 100th anniversary.

==Concert works==
* Toccata for Solo Guitar
*: In the 1950s, Goldsmith composed &quot;Toccata for Solo Guitar&quot;. The music was later performed and recorded by Gregg Nestor and released through BSX Records January 5, 2010.
* The Thunder of Imperial Names
*: In 1957, Goldsmith composed the patriotic piece based on a text by Thomas Wolfe titled &quot;The Thunder of Imperial Names&quot; for concert band and narration, which first appeared on the CBS Radio Workshop episode &quot;1489 Words&quot;. &quot;The Thunder of Imperial Names&quot; was later performed and re-recorded in 2006 by the U.S. Air Force Tactical Command Band under conductor Lowell E. Graham and narrated by Gary McKenzie.
* Christus Apollo
*: In 1969, the California Chamber Symphony commissioned Goldsmith to compose a cantata based on the text &quot;Christus Apollo&quot; by science fiction author Ray Bradbury, with whom Goldsmith had previously worked on dramatic radio and later the 1969 film &quot;The Illustrated Man&quot;. The piece, written in four movements, consisted of orchestra, choir, mezzo-soprano solo, and narration (originally performed by Charlton Heston). Goldsmith composed the piece largely using the 12-tone system, later stating, &quot;I feel there is a great relationship between impressionism and dodecaphonicism and that was the musical language I wanted for &#x27;Christus Apollo&#x27;.&quot; For the 2002 Telarc album release, &quot;Christus Apollo&quot; was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, the London Voices, mezzo-soprano Eirian James, and narrated by actor Anthony Hopkins.
* Music for Orchestra
*: In 1970, Goldsmith was approached by conductor Leonard Slatkin to compose a short piece for the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra. The atonal composition was written in three sections developed from one common 12-tone row including the &quot;turbulent&quot; first section, the &quot;introspective&quot; second section, and climaxing in a &quot;very agitated&quot; third section. Goldsmith later reflected that the piece was a result of much turbulence in his life, stating, &quot;I was going through a divorce and my mother was seriously ill with cancer.&quot; Goldsmith continued, &quot;All of my personal turmoil – pain, anger, and sorrow – went into writing &#x27;Music for Orchestra&#x27; in strict dodecaphonic form.&quot;
*: In 1999, Goldsmith composed the energetic &quot;Fireworks: A Celebration of Los Angeles&quot; to conclude his first concert series with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl. Looking back on the experience, Goldsmith later said, &quot;After starting to write what was to be a big fireworks extravaganza, I realized that I was writing about the city where I was born and had lived my entire life. I decided instead to make the piece a grand celebration of my childhood, growing years, my years of maturity, and all the events that climaxed with my first appearance at the Hollywood Bowl.&quot;

==Personal life and death==

Goldsmith was married twice. He was first married to Sharon Hennagin in 1950; they divorced in 1970. He married Carol Heather Sheinkopf in 1972, and the couple remained together until his death in 2004. His oldest son Joel Goldsmith (1957–2012) was also a composer and collaborated with his father on the score for &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;, composing approximately twenty-two minutes of the score. Goldsmith also conducted Joel&#x27;s theme for &quot;The Untouchables&quot; and composed the theme for the pilot &quot;Hollister&quot;, scored by Joel. Goldsmith&#x27;s daughter, Carrie Goldsmith, went to high school with &quot;Titanic&quot; film score composer James Horner, who also composed music for &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s second and third films: &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; and &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot;. Carrie Goldsmith was working on a biography of her father, though the book has been suspended indefinitely for unspecified reasons. Ellen Smith, who sang the title song for &quot;Wild Rovers&quot;, shortened her surname but was actually his daughter, Ellen Goldsmith.

Goldsmith died from colon cancer at his home in Beverly Hills, California, on July 21, 2004, at the age of 75. He was interred at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery.

==Style and influences==
Goldsmith was greatly influenced by movements of early 20th-century classical music, notably modernism, Americana, impressionism, dodecaphonism, and early film scores. He has cited Igor Stravinsky, Aaron Copland, Miklós Rózsa, Bernard Herrmann, Béla Bartók, and Alban Berg, among others, as some of the main influences to his style of composition.

His style has been noted for its unique instrumentation, utilizing a vast array of ethnic instruments, recorded sounds, synthetic textures, and the traditional orchestra, often concurrently. When asked about his inclination for embracing new techniques and constantly shifting his musical palette throughout his career, Goldsmith said, &quot;It seems like it&#x27;s me, and that&#x27;s that! Certain composers are doing the same thing over and over again, which I feel is sort of uninteresting. I don&#x27;t find that you grow very much in that way. I like to keep changing, trying to do new things. Basically, I&#x27;m saying the same thing with a little different twist on it. Once you get caught up in the creative process, something inside takes over, and your subconscious just does it for you.&quot;

One reason for the consistency of Goldsmith&#x27;s aural resonance and signature sound is his long time professional association with orchestrator Arthur Morton. Their first collaboration was on the film, &quot;Take Her, She&#x27;s Mine&quot; (1963). Goldsmith was commissioned to score the features, &quot;Von Ryan&#x27;s Express&quot; and &quot;Morituri&quot; (both 1965). He recruited Morton to serve as his orchestrator. Their bond for a unique and expressive sound was born, and their friendship flourished. Goldsmith went on to compose the scores for &quot;Our Man Flint&quot;, &quot;The Trouble with Angels&quot; (with Frank De Vol), &quot;The Blue Max&quot;, &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot;, and &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (all 1966). Morton was there providing his orchestration services, assisting Goldsmith in attaining his visionary sounds. Their partnership endured for over 30 years and included the notable scores for &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (1968), &quot;Patton&quot; (1970), &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; (1970), &quot;Papillon&quot; (1973), &quot;Chinatown&quot; (1974), &quot;The Omen&quot; (1976), &quot;MacArthur&quot; (1977), &quot;Capricorn One&quot; (1978), &quot;Alien&quot; (1979), &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; (1979), &quot;Poltergeist&quot; (1982), &quot;First Blood&quot; (1982), &quot;Under Fire&quot; (1983), &quot;The Russia House&quot; (1990). The final score that Arthur Morton orchestrated for Goldsmith was &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; (1997).

==Legacy==
Jerry Goldsmith has been considered one of film music history&#x27;s most innovative and influential composers. While presenting Goldsmith with a Career Achievement Award from the Society for the Preservation of Film Music in 1993, fellow composer Henry Mancini said of Goldsmith, &quot;he has instilled two things in his colleagues in this town. One thing he does, he keeps us honest. And the second one is he scares the hell out of us.&quot; In his review of the 1999 re-issue of the &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; soundtrack, Bruce Eder highly praised Goldsmith&#x27;s ability, stating, &quot;one of the new tracks, &#x27;Spock&#x27;s Arrival&#x27;, may be the closest that Goldsmith has ever come to writing serious music in a pure Romantic idiom; this could have been the work of Rimsky-Korsakov or Stravinsky — it&#x27;s that good.&quot; In a 2001 interview, film composer Marco Beltrami (&quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot;, &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot;) stated, &quot;Without Jerry, film music would probably be in a different place than it is now. I think he more than any other composer bridged the gap between the old Hollywood scoring style and the modern film composer.&quot;

In 2006, upon composing &quot;The Omen&quot; (a remake of the Goldsmith-scored 1976 film), Marco Beltrami dedicated his score to Goldsmith, which also included an updated arrangement of &quot;Ave Satani&quot; titled &quot;Omen 76/06&quot;. Likewise, when composer Brian Tyler was commissioned in 2012 to update the Universal Studios logo for the Universal centennial, he retained the melody originally composed by Goldsmith in 1997, opting to &quot;bring it into the 21st century.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==
Over the course of his career, Goldsmith received 18 total Academy Award nominations, making him one of the most nominated composers in the history of the Awards. Despite this, Goldsmith won only one Oscar, his score for &quot;The Omen&quot; (1976). This makes Goldsmith the most nominated composer to have won an Oscar only on one occasion. In 1991, Goldsmith received an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music.

On May 9, 2017, Goldsmith posthumously received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his achievements in the music industry, located at 6752 Hollywood Boulevard.

===AFI===
The American Film Institute respectively ranked Goldsmith&#x27;s scores for &quot;Chinatown&quot; (1974) and &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (1968) 9 and 18 on their list of the 25 greatest film scores. He is one of only five composers to have more than one score featured in the list, including Elmer Bernstein, Bernard Herrmann, Max Steiner, and John Williams. His scores for the following films were also nominated for inclusion:
* &quot;Alien&quot; (1979)
* &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; (1997)

<text>is a Japanese term denoting an ancient division of the country. &quot;Kinai&quot; is a name for the ancient provinces around the capital Nara and Heian-kyō. The five provinces were called &quot;go-kinai&quot; after 1760.

The name is still used to describe part of the Kansai region, but the area of the Kinai corresponds only generally to the land of the old provinces.

The region was established as one of the &quot;Gokishichidō&quot; (&quot;Five provinces and seven roads&quot;) during the Asuka period (538-710). It consisted of Yamashiro, Yamato, Settsu, Kawachi, and Izumi provinces.

<text>Ferenc Deák de Kehida (archaically English: Francis Deak, ; 17 October 1803 – 28 January 1876) was a Hungarian statesman and Minister of Justice. He was known as &quot;The Wise Man of the Nation&quot; and one of the greatest figures of Hungary&#x27;s liberal movement.

He was an instrumental contributor to a number of major events in Hungarian history, including passing and support of the April laws, the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and the Hungarian Nationalities Law (1868). While generally supporting reformist policies, he was well recognized for finding and negotiating reasonable middle ground compromises between various extremist political factions throughout his career.

==Early life and law career==

Born in Söjtör in the county of Zala, in southwestern Hungary, Deák belonged to an ancient noble family. His father was Ferenc Deák de Kehida (1761–1808), jurist, landowner, chief magistrate of the district (&quot;főszolgabíró&quot;) of Kapornak. His mother was the noble lady Erzsébet Sibrik de Szarvaskend et Óvár (1768–1803). He studied law, and became successively an advocate and notary.

His reputation was quickly established, and he first went into politics in 1833 when he attended the assembly of Pressburg (now Bratislava) as a replacement for his older brother Antal Deák de Kehida (1789–1842), beginning his career that would make him one of the most important personalities in the Hungarian politics and reforms of the 1840s. His name became known as a result of his involvement in the suit of Miklós Wesselényi and his success in declaring the Hungarian Assembly&#x27;s right to create laws.

==Early activism==

In 1836, Deák wrote and distributed a document about the causes that he supported without the permission of the censors; while it was confiscated, it was already widespread and made his name familiar in important circles. During the Diet of 1839–1840 Deák succeeded in bringing about an understanding between a reactionary government, then in want of money, and a Liberal opposition determined that the nation should have its political privileges respected. He was involved in the creation of the laws of that Diet, and became honorary member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. After the death of his brother in 1842, he liberated his serfs and voluntarily chose to pay taxes to show that he was sincere about his reforms. The abolition of the exemption of the nobles from all taxation in the Kingdom of Hungary and the liberation of serfs were some of the most important endeavours of the Reformist movement of the era. However, he refused to attend the Diet of 1843–44, supposedly due to strife surrounding his election.

==Political career==

In 1846, after the bloody end of the Polish uprising in Galicia the reformers gained popularity and they released the &quot;Ellenzéki nyilatkozat&quot; (Manifesto of Opposition) under the name of Deák, while it was in fact created by Kossuth. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 against the Austrian Empire, Deák stayed calm and opposed violence as a political tool. In 1848 he accepted a position as Minister of Justice in the Batthyány Government, mostly to show his support of Lajos Batthyány.

Once part of the revolutionary government, Deák continued to urge moderation and made several trips to the court in Vienna, seeking a compromise between the Habsburg monarchy and Kossuth&#x27;s Extremist Liberals. When his efforts failed, he resigned his ministerial post, but remained a Member of Parliament, defending the constitutional legitimacy of the April laws. He retired to his estate at Kehida before the end of the War of Independence, and took no further active part in events surrounding the revolution. An Austrian court martial acquitted him after Hungary&#x27;s defeat.

Deák spent most of the 1850s in semi-retirement, tacitly supporting various national causes without engaging in active politics. He, however, refused to assume any public role, office or position, thus becoming an emblem of the so-called passive resistance. He sold his estate to István Széchenyi, and moved to Buda to become the de facto leader of Hungarian public life. He steered a middle course between advocates of a second anti-Habsburg uprising aligned with Kossuth, and pro-Austrian collaborationists. The crisis attending the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859, with strong Hungarian popular support for the Italian cause, returned him to active political life, although he opposed the initial Austrian reform proposals of 1860. In 1861, he became the leader of the group calling for a petition to the Austrian crown, throwing the onus for a settlement onto the Habsburg court. In response to his prompting, Franz Joseph I dismissed his current administration and called for a new parliament to negotiate the settlement. Deák led the committee tasked with drafting a formula, working alongside Kálmán Tisza and other prominent contemporary politicians. The Austro-Prussian War of 1866 came just as they had completed their work, but Deák resisted extremist pressure to reopen the issue.

Gradually, Deák moderated his views on Hungary&#x27;s independence. Although he maintained that the April Laws were fully valid, he began taking the line that foreign affairs, defence and finance were &quot;common&quot; to both Austria and Hungary under the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713. He believed that a constitutional arrangement could be worked out to incorporate these ideas while still respecting Hungary&#x27;s internal independence. He supported the &quot;Compromise&quot; (&quot;Ausgleich&quot; or &quot;Kiegyezés&quot;) of 1867, which incorporated these ideas, with all his strength, leading the delegation that signed the actual accord. Although he was the obvious choice as the first prime minister of the Hungarian half of the newly formed Austria-Hungary, he stood down in favour of Gyula Andrássy.
After 1867 his health was weakened by continuous work and the attacks on him by disappointed radical patriots used up most of his strength. His reformist ideas were often rejected by Parliament.
He died on 28 January 1876 and was buried with great pomp. Parliament created a law to remember his excellent service and ordered that a statue be created from national donations. Today one of the central squares of Budapest, Deák Ferenc Square is named after him, which is where three of the four lines of the Budapest Metro come together.

==Legacy==
* Deák Ferenc Bilingual High School was named after him.
* Deák Ferenc tér, a major transit hub in Budapest, and the adjacent metro station also named after him.
* He is portrayed on the 20,000 forint bank note (the highest denomination Hungarian currency note).
* Hungarian Post Office issued a postage stamp on 1 July 1932.
* He was often referred to as &#x27;The wise man of the homeland&#x27;.
* Deak features prominently in the 1904 book THE RESURRECTION OF HUNGARY by the Irish nationalist Arthur Griffith, who argued that Deak&#x27;s policy of non-recognition of the post-1848 Austrian administration in Hungary could be imitated by Irish nationalists to achieve self-rule within a British-Irish dual monarchy.

<doc id="394496" wikidata="Q4709471" url="?curid=394496" title="Albedo (role-playing game)">
<text>Albedo is a role-playing game based on Steve Gallacci&#x27;s &quot;Erma Felna: EDF&quot; and &quot;Birthright&quot; storylines from the comic anthologies &quot;Albedo Anthropomorphics&quot; and &quot;Critters&quot;.

==Play style and mechanics==
&quot;Albedo&quot; is a science-fiction space-adventure system based on the &quot;Erma Felna, EDF&quot; comics stories. All of the player characters are genetically constructed anthropomorphized animals, and are typically members of the &quot;Extra-Planetary Defense Force&quot;. The rules use a single chart to determine the results of all skill and characteristic checks. A task system dictates how these results are modified. In combat, wounds directly affect character abilities.

&quot;Albedo: Platinum Catalyst&quot; is characterized by the notable player-controlled troupe of characters, the main character and four supporting retinue. The main character is more fleshed out than his supporting characters which typically have 3 stats (species, morale, job description) and a weapon.

Morale is a character&#x27;s ability to keep cool; when a character is shot or witnesses an explosion, they lose one point of this stat. Green soldiers will typically start with one morale point if they trust their commanding officer, and can have 3 morale points after completing three missions with the main character. For main characters, the equivalent to morale is &quot;drive&quot;.

In Albedo, higher skill gets you a larger sided die. Skill rank 1 gives you the smallest: 1d4, 2 points gives you 1d6 all the way up to rank 5 giving you 1d12. That&#x27;s not all though, you can decide to take a test in one of several manners: Basic, Pushing, Risking, Breezing, and Rote.

Rote is the &quot;take 10&quot; of Albedo, where you get your skill ranks + 1. This is business as usual.
Basic is for those things that you fail sometimes, but need higher than a 2 on the die.
Pushing is doing things better. The unusual circumstances where you need to succeed. You grab twice as many dice as you normally would, roll them and take the better (Pushing is the one of two ways to Overwhelmingly Succeed: simply, both dice meet or beat the target).
Risking is for those times when you need to reach beyond your normal capacity because regular dice aren&#x27;t enough and only necessary if you have 4 ranks or fewer. Simply grab the next size die and take your chances.
Breezing is the last method, where the character is overqualified for the job at hand and wants to outperform. This is similar to Pushing, only in it you take the sized die of half your skill ranks and roll twice as many (the second way to overwhelmingly succeed, and the reason why you buy over 5 ranks in a skill).

==Publication history==
&quot;The Albedo Role Playing Game&quot; was written by Paul Kidd with Steve Gallacci and first published as a boxed set with four books - three rulebooks (background and characters, technology and equipment, referee&#x27;s manual) and an introductory scenario - and dice by Furball Publications (Aus.) in 1988, and was then published as a boxed set with four books by Thoughts and Images in 1988.

Written by Craig Hilton and Paul Kidd, &quot;Albedo&quot; was originally published as a box set in 1988 by Thoughts &amp; Images and consisted of 4 books: Player&#x27;s Manual, Equipment Description, Referee&#x27;s Manual and Tlakatan Scenario (sample scenario). The RPG was later revised and published by Chessex in 1993 as a softcover. There is one companion sourcebook and a pair of ready-made scenarios, also in softcover:

*&quot;Albedo Ship Sourcebook&quot; (Kidd, Gallacci - Chessex, 1995), rules for ship design and statistics for various spaceships.
*&quot;The Drift&quot; (Kidd - Chessex, 1994), an adventure scenario in space.
*&quot;Zho-Chaka&quot; (Kidd - Chessex, 1994), an adventure scenario on a ConFed planet.

There also exists a third-party guide to converting Albedo for use with the GURPS RPG system, written by Fred M. Sloniker and called GURPS Albedo.

In 2004, Sanguine Productions published &quot;ALBEDO: PLATINUM CATALYST&quot;, which is unrelated to the original two editions of the role-playing game. The game was published as a single softcover with source material, rules of engagement, and sample characters. Most notable are its attention to details of small-unit tactics using near-future and far-future weaponry, in the same vein as &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six&quot; and other &quot;techno thrillers&quot;, as well as using genetically-engineered people as a morality play for 20th century geopolitics.

==Reception==
Lawrence Schick called the game &quot;An example of the subgenre we can only call &#x27;Pets in Space&#x27;&quot; and noted that the Extra-Planetary Defense Force is &quot;dedicated to peace-keeping rather than butt-kicking.&quot;

<doc id="394497" wikidata="Q110257498" url="?curid=394497" title="Western Orphean warbler">
<text>The western Orphean warbler (Curruca hortensis) is a typical warbler of the genus &quot;Curruca&quot;. This species occurs in summer around the Mediterranean, through western Europe and extending into northwest Africa. It is migratory, wintering in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is a rare vagrant to northern and north-western Europe.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The English name refers to the mythical musician and singer . The specific &quot;hortensis&quot; is Latin for &quot;of a garden&quot;, from &quot;hortus&quot;, &quot;garden&quot;.

Two subspecies are unequivocally accepted, but they are now usually considered separate species.

The western Orphean warbler is probably most closely allied to the Arabian warbler, as well as the brown warbler and Yemen warblers which are sometimes placed in &quot;Parisoma&quot;. They together with the lesser whitethroat group seem to form a distinct clade of typical warblers. The species therein do not appear much alike at first glance, but they all have prominent white throats, lack rufous wing-patches, and usually having dark sides to the head.

==Description==

At in length – somewhat larger than a blackcap – this is one of the largest species of typical warblers. The adult males have a plain grey back and whitish underparts. The bill is long and pointed and the legs black. The male has a dark grey head, black eye mask, and white throat. The iris is white. Females and immatures have a paler head and buff underparts; their grey back has a brownish tinge. The iris is dark in young birds. The song is a series of warbling &quot;&quot; and scolding notes.

==Behaviour and ecology==
These small passerine birds are found in open deciduous woodland. 4-6 eggs are laid in a nest in a bush or tree. Like most &quot;warblers&quot;, the western Orphean warbler is an insectivore.

<text>Sherubtse College is the first accredited college in Bhutan, founded in 1966 by a group of Jesuits under the leadership of Father William Mackey. The college was affiliated to the University of Delhi by a special act of the Indian parliament.

It became a part of the newly created Royal University of Bhutan in 2003, a system that comprises all public post-secondary schools in Bhutan.

==Departments==
Nearly 300 students graduate every year from the college. It offers courses such as Economics, Political Science and Sociology, Life Science, English, Geography, Science, and many new courses are offered after rigorous changes in the college for more 21st-century learning. New courses including Bachelors of Economics &amp; Political Science, Bachelors of Digital Communications &amp; Project Management, and Bachelors of Data Science and Data Analytics have been offered since the Autumn Semester of 2023. Its most significant science department is the department of Physical Science and Environmental Science, which benefits from its location within the Himalayan region.
Business Studies has been shifted to Gedu College of Business Studies (GCBS), the second government college in Bhutan located in Gedu, Chhukha Dzongkhag. This new college offers courses like Business Administration and Commerce.

==History of the College==
The 3rd king of Bhutan, Jigme Dorji Wangchuck laid the foundation stone for Sherubtse School in June 1966. The school opened in 1968 with Father William Mackey as principal. In 1976, the school was upgraded to a Junior College with pre-university courses in science. In 1978, the arts and business courses were added.

In July 1983, Sherubtse College became an affiliated college of the Delhi University system in India and Father Gerald E. Leclaire S.J. was the first principal. Several Jesuits of Canadian origin taught English and Science.

In June 2003, the school was combined with 9 other institutes of higher learning to form the Royal University of Bhutan. The departments of business and economics are to be transferred to the Royal Institute of Management (RIM) over the next several years.

<doc id="394508" wikidata="Q3510766" url="?curid=394508" title="Séminaire de Géométrie Algébrique du Bois Marie">
<text>In mathematics, the &#x27; (SGA&quot;&quot;&#x27;; from French: &quot;Seminar on Algebraic Geometry of Bois Marie&quot;) was an influential seminar run by French mathematician Alexander Grothendieck. It was a unique phenomenon of research and publication outside of the main mathematical journals that ran from 1960 to 1969 at the (IHÉS) near Paris. (The name came from the small wood on the estate in Bures-sur-Yvette where the IHÉS was located from 1962.) The seminar notes were eventually published in twelve volumes, all except one in the Springer Lecture Notes in Mathematics series.

==Style==

The material has a reputation of being hard to read for a number of reasons. More elementary or foundational parts were relegated to the EGA series of Grothendieck and Jean Dieudonné, causing long strings of logical dependencies in the statements. The style is very abstract and makes heavy use of category theory. Moreover, an attempt was made to achieve maximally general statements, while assuming that the reader is aware of the motivations and concrete examples.

==First publication==

The original notes to SGA were published in fascicles by the IHÉS, most of which went through two or three revisions. These were published as the seminar proceeded, beginning in the early 60&#x27;s and continuing through most of the decade. They can still be found in large math libraries, but distribution was limited. In the late 60&#x27;s and early 70&#x27;s, the original seminar notes were comprehensively revised and rewritten to take into account later developments. In addition, a new volume, SGA 4½, was compiled by Pierre Deligne and published in 1977; it contains simplified and new results by Deligne within the scope of SGA4 as well as some material from SGA5, which had not yet appeared at that time. The revised notes, except for SGA2, were published by Springer in its &quot;Lecture Notes in Mathematics&quot; series.

After a dispute with Springer, Grothendieck refused the permission for reprints of the series. While these later revisions were more widely distributed than the original fascicles, they are still uncommon outside of libraries.

References to SGA typically mean the later, revised editions and not the original fascicles; some of the originals were labelled by capital letters, thus for example S.G.A.D. = SGA3 and S.G.A.A. = SGA4.

==Series titles==

The volumes of the SGA series are the following:

*SGA1 &quot;Revêtements étales et groupe fondamental, 1960–1961&quot; (Étale coverings and the fundamental group), Lecture Notes in Mathematics 224, 1971
*SGA2 &quot;Cohomologie locale des faisceaux cohérents et théorèmes de Lefschetz locaux et globaux, 1961–1962&quot; (Local cohomology of coherent sheaves and global and local Lefschetz theorems), North Holland 1968
*SGA3 &quot;Schémas en groupes, 1962–1964&quot; (Group schemes), Lecture Notes in Mathematics 151, 152 and 153, 1970
*SGA4 &quot;Théorie des topos et cohomologie étale des schémas, 1963–1964&quot; (Topos theory and étale cohomology), Lecture Notes in Mathematics 269, 270 and 305, 1972/3
*SGA4½ &quot;Cohomologie étale&quot; (Étale cohomology), Lecture Notes in Mathematics 569, 1977. SGA 4½ does not correspond to any of the actual seminars. It is a compilation by Pierre Deligne of some survey articles, new results within the scope of SGA4, and finally material from SGA5.
*SGA5 &quot;Cohomologie l-adique et fonctions L, 1965–1966&quot; (&quot;l&quot;-adic cohomology and &quot;L&quot;-functions), Lecture Notes in Mathematics 589, 1977
*SGA6 &quot;Théorie des intersections et théorème de Riemann-Roch, 1966–1967&quot; (Intersection theory and the Riemann–Roch theorem), Lecture Notes in Mathematics 225, 1971
*SGA7 &quot;Groupes de monodromie en géométrie algébrique, 1967–1969&quot; (Monodromy groups in algebraic geometry), Lecture Notes in Mathematics 288 and 340, 1972/3.
*SGA8 was never written. The occasional mentions of SGA8 usually refer to either chapter 8 of SGA1, or Berthelot&#x27;s work on crystalline cohomology later published outside the SGA series.

== Re-publishing &quot;SGA&quot; ==

In the 1990s, it became obvious that the lack of availability of the SGA was becoming more and more of a problem to researchers and graduate students in algebraic geometry: not only are the copies in book form too few for the growing number of researchers, but they are also difficult to read because of the way they are typeset (on an electric typewriter, with mathematical formulae written by hand). Thus, under the impetus of various mathematicians from several countries, a project was formed of re-publishing SGA in a more widely available electronic format and using LaTeX for typesetting; also, various notes are to be added to correct for minor mistakes or obscurities. The result should be published by the Société Mathématique de France. Legal permission to reprint the works was obtained from every author except Alexander Grothendieck himself, who could not be contacted; it was decided to proceed without his explicit agreement on the grounds that his refusal for the SGA to be re-published by Springer-Verlag was an objection against Springer and not one of principle.

As a first step, the entire work was scanned and made available on-line (see the links section below) by Frank Calegari, Jim Borger and William Stein. The job of typesetting the text anew and proofreading it was then distributed among dozens of volunteers (most of them junior French mathematicians, because of the required fluency in French and knowledge of algebraic geometry), starting with SGA1 in late 2001.

The coordinating editor for the work on SGA1 was Bas Edixhoven from University of Leiden (at the time University of Rennes): the first version was available on the arXiv.org e-print archive on June 20, 2002, and the proof-read version was uploaded on January 4, 2004, and later published in book form by the Société Mathématique de France. Work on SGA2 was started in 2004 with Yves Laszlo as coordinating editor. The LaTeX source file is available on the arXiv.org e-print archive; SGA2 appeared in print in late 2005 by the Société Mathématique de France (see https://web.archive.org/web/20091130171320/http://smf.emath.fr/Publications/DocumentsMathematiques/).

Laszlo has also edited SGA4 and recently Philippe Gille and Patrick Polo have uploaded TeXed version of SGA3. In January 2010, however, Grothendieck requested that work cease on republishing SGA. In late 2014, work on republishing SGA resumed and it was restored to the Grothendieck circle site.
