<text>John Henry Faulk (August 21, 1913 – April 9, 1990) was an American storyteller and radio show host. His successful lawsuit against the entertainment industry helped to bring an end to the Hollywood blacklist.

== Early life ==

John Henry Faulk was born in Austin, Texas, to Methodist parents Henry Faulk and his wife Martha Miner Faulk. John Henry had four siblings.

Faulk spent his childhood years in Austin in the noted Victorian house &quot;Green Pastures&quot;. A journalist acquaintance from Austin has written that the two of them came from &quot;extremely similar family backgrounds – the old Southern wealth with rich heritage and families dedicated to civil rights long before it was hip to fight racism.&quot;

== Education and military service ==

Faulk enrolled at the University of Texas in Austin in 1932. He became a protégé of J. Frank Dobie, Walter Prescott Webb, Roy Bedichek, and Mody C. Boatright, enabling Faulk to hone his skills as a folklorist. He earned a master&#x27;s degree in folklore with his thesis &quot;Ten Negro Sermons&quot;. He further began to craft his oratory style as a part-time English teacher at the university 1940–1942, relating Texas folk tales peppered with his gift of character impersonations.

He was initially unfit for service with the United States Army because of an eye problem. Instead, Faulk joined the Merchant Marine in 1942 for a one-year stint, spending 1943 in Cairo, Egypt, serving the American Red Cross. World War II had caused the United States Army to relax its enlistment standards, and Faulk finally enlisted in 1944. He served as a medic at Camp Swift, Texas. During this period, Faulk also joined the American Civil Liberties Union.

== Career ==

While a soldier at Camp Swift, Faulk began writing his own radio scripts. An acquaintance facilitated an interview for him at WCBS in New York City. The network executives were sufficiently impressed to offer him his own radio show. Upon his 1946 discharge from the Army, Faulk began his &quot;Johnny&#x27;s Front Porch&quot; radio show for WCBS. The show featured Faulk&#x27;s characterizations that he had been developing since his university years. Faulk eventually went to another radio station, but returned to WCBS for a four-hour morning talk show. &quot;The John Henry Faulk Show&quot; ran for six years. His radio successes provided opportunity for him to appear as himself on television, in shows including the 1951 Mark Goodson and William Todman game show &quot;It&#x27;s News to Me&quot;, hosted by John Charles Daly. He also appeared on &quot; Leave It to the Girls&quot; in 1953 and &quot; The Name&#x27;s the Same&quot; in 1955.

Cactus Pryor met Faulk in the studios of KLBJ (then KTBC) where Faulk stopped by to thank Pryor for letting his mother hear his New York show. Pryor had been &quot;accidentally&quot; broadcasting Faulk&#x27;s radio show in Texas where Faulk was not otherwise heard. Although the broadcast happened repeatedly, Pryor always claimed he just hit the wrong button in the studio. Pryor visited Faulk at a Manhattan apartment he shared with Alan Lomax and became introduced to the movers and shakers of the East Coast celebrity scene of that era. When Pryor stood by Faulk during the blacklisting and tried to find him work, Pryor&#x27;s children were harassed, a prominent Austin physician circulated a letter questioning Pryor&#x27;s patriotism, and an Austin attorney tried to convince Lyndon B. Johnson to discharge Pryor from the airwaves. The Pryor family and the Faulk family remained close and supportive of each other for the rest of Faulk&#x27;s life.

In December 1955, Faulk was elected second vice president of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA). Orson Bean was the first vice president and Charles Collingwood was the president of the union. Collingwood, Bean, and Faulk were part of a middle-of-the-road slate of non-communist, anti-AWARE organization candidates that Faulk had helped draft. Twenty-seven of thirty-five vacant seats on the board went to the middle-of-the-road slate. Faulk&#x27;s public position during the campaign had been that the union should be focused on jobs and security, not blacklisting of members.

In the 1970s in Austin, he was also befriended by the young co-editor of the &quot;Texas Observer&quot;, Molly Ivins, and became an early supporter of hers.

== Blacklist controversy ==
Faulk&#x27;s radio career at CBS ended in 1957, a victim of the Cold War and the blacklisting of the 1950s. AWARE, Inc., a for-profit corporation inspired by Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy, offered a &quot;clearance&quot; service to major media advertisers and radio and television networks; for a fee, AWARE would investigate the backgrounds of entertainers for signs of Communist sympathy or affiliation.

In 1955, Faulk earned the ill will of the blacklisting organization when other members and he wrested control of their union, the AFTRA, from officers backed by AWARE. In reprisal, AWARE labeled Faulk a communist. When he discovered that AWARE was actively keeping radio stations from offering him employment, Faulk sought compensation.

Several prominent radio personalities along with CBS News vice president Edward R. Murrow supported Faulk&#x27;s attempt to put an end to blacklisting. With financial backing from Murrow, Faulk engaged New York attorney Louis Nizer. Attorneys for AWARE, including McCarthy-committee counsel Roy Cohn, managed to stall the suit, originally filed in 1957, for five years. When the trial finally concluded in a New York courtroom, the jury had determined that Faulk should receive more compensation than he sought in his original petition. On June 28, 1962, the jury awarded him the largest libel judgment in history to that date — $3.5 million. An appeals court lowered the amount to $500,000. Legal fees and accumulated debts erased most of the balance of the award. He netted some $75,000.

Faulk&#x27;s book, &quot;Fear on Trial&quot;, published in 1963, tells the story of the experience. The book was remade into an Emmy Award-winning TV movie in 1975 by CBS Television with William Devane portraying Faulk and George C. Scott playing Faulk&#x27;s lawyer, Louis Nizer.

Other supporters in the blacklist struggle included radio pioneer and Wimberley, Texas, native Parks Johnson, and reporter and CBS television news anchor Walter Cronkite.

== Personal life and death ==

In 1940, John Henry Faulk and Harriet Elizabeth (&quot;Hally&quot;) Wood, a music student at the University of Texas Fine Arts School, were married, six weeks after they met. The marriage ended in divorce in 1947; the couple had one daughter, Cynthia Tannehill. In 1948, Faulk and New Yorker Lynne Smith were married some six weeks after they met. That marriage also ended in divorce because of fallout from the blacklisting upheaval. Faulk and Smith had two daughters, Johanna and Evelyn, and one son, Frank Dobie Faulk. In 1965, Faulk and Elizabeth Peake were married; they had one son, John Henry Faulk III.

John Henry Faulk died in Austin of cancer on April 9, 1990, and is interred there at Oakwood Cemetery. Austin restaurateur Mary Faulk Koock (1910–1996) was Faulk&#x27;s sister.

<text>David Timothy Dreier OAE (/draɪər/; born July 5, 1952) is an American businessman, philanthropist, and politician who served as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from California from 1981 to 2013. He was one of the youngest members ever elected to the United States Congress. Dreier was the youngest chairman of the House Rules Committee in U.S. history, serving from 1999 to 2007 and from 2011 to 2013. He was instrumental in passing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993. After leaving Congress, Dreier served on the Foreign Affairs Policy Board under President Barack Obama. He served as the chairman of the Tribune Publishing Company from 2019 to 2020. Dreier is also founder and chair of the Fallen Journalists Memorial Foundation.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

===Elections===
====Early career====
In 1978, Dreier ran for the United States House of Representatives at the age of 25. He challenged incumbent Democrat James Fredrick Lloyd, who had first won in a Republican-leaning district in 1974. Though unknown and living in Phillips Hall at Claremont McKenna College, Dreier lost by 54% to 46%, less than expected.

In 1980, Dreier ran again and defeated Lloyd 52% to 45%, winning on the coattails of former California Governor Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidential election. Dreier was sworn into office as one of the youngest members of the House of Representatives in U.S. history.

After the 1980 United States census, his district was renumbered to the 33rd. Dreier defeated Congressman Wayne Grisham 57% to 43% in the Republican primary of 1982. Dreier became the first person to defeat two incumbent members of Congress in back to back elections. He won the 1982 general election with 65% of the vote. He won re-election every two years after that with at least 57% of the vote until his 2004 re-election. His district was renumbered to the 28th after the 1990 United States census and to the 26th district after the 2000 United States census.

====2004 election====
In 2004, Dreier faced strong criticism for his position on illegal immigration from opponent Cynthia Matthews and several talk radio hosts who felt he was not tough enough on illegal immigrants.

Dreier won with 54% of the vote.

====After 2004====
In 2006, he won reelection in a rematch against Matthews 57% to 38%, despite Republicans losing the majority that year.

In 2008, Dreier won reelection against Democrat Russ Warner with 53% of the vote.

In 2010, he defeated Warner in a rematch with 54% of the vote. Dreier ceased all campaign fundraising for more than a year, leading many to believe that he was planning to leave Congress.

After the 2010 United States census, the voter-created California Citizens Redistricting Commission renumbered Dreier&#x27;s district as the 31st district, and reconfigured it as a Democratic-leaning, majority-Latino district. Dreier chose not to run for reelection in 2012 and encouraged his Republican colleague Gary Miller to move into the 31st after Miller&#x27;s old district was merged with the district of another Republican, Ed Royce.

===Tenure===
==== House leadership ====
Dreier is the youngest chairman of the House Rules Committee in U.S. history. As well as being the only Californian to hold that position, he is the third-longest-serving chairman of the Rules Committee and the longest-serving chairman since 1967. When the Democrats gained control of the House in the 2006 midterm elections, Dreier served as ranking member for the 110th and 111th Congresses. With the Republicans regaining control of the House in the 2010 midterm elections, Dreier again assumed the chairmanship during the 112th Congress.

Beginning with Dreier&#x27;s chairmanship in 1999, the chairman of the Rules Committee became part of the nine-member elected Republican leadership.

Following the indictment of House Majority Leader Tom DeLay on September 28, 2005, House Speaker Dennis Hastert asked Dreier to assume temporarily the position of majority leader, as Dreier had consistently adhered to the views of the Republican leadership on many issues and would have been willing to relinquish the title should DeLay have returned to the position. However, rank-and-file Republican representatives disapproved of the choice of Dreier allegedly because many conservative members believed that he was &quot;too politically moderate&quot;. According to Dreier spokeswoman Jo Maney, Dreier did not seek the temporary Majority Leader position because he &quot;would have had to give up his chairmanship of the Rules Committee to move to another position, and that&#x27;s not something that he wanted to do&quot;. The position instead went to then-Majority Whip Roy Blunt of Missouri, though both Dreier and then-Deputy Majority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia shared in some duties.

==== Trade ====

Along with House colleagues Jim Kolbe and Jerry Lewis, Dreier was the first member of Congress to propose a North American free trade agreement in 1987. He was instrumental in the creation and passage of what became NAFTA in 1993. During the signing ceremony for NAFTA, President Bill Clinton recognized Dreier&#x27;s contribution to the ultimate success of the legislation.

Dreier opposed President Donald Trump&#x27;s threats to abandon NAFTA, instead advocating for an updated NAFTA, which would include digital trade, among other subjects.

Dreier has been a longstanding supporter of closer ties between the United States and the countries of Latin America and has met frequently with executive and legislative branch leaders throughout the region. He has received the nation&#x27;s highest honors from the presidents of Colombia, Mexico, and Nicaragua. On August 28, 2007, while building support for the United States–Colombia Free Trade Agreement, Dreier addressed the Colombian parliament. Dreier drew criticism from some opposition lawmakers when he sat on the edge of a podium during informal remarks to the legislators. Dreier later apologized and insisted he intended no disrespect. In comments released on August 30, 2007, Dreier said, &quot;I meant absolutely no offense. I simply wanted to demonstrate my warm feeling and affection.&quot;

Dreier also founded the bipartisan House Trade Working Group, working closely with five American presidents of both parties on every free trade agreement into which the United States has entered. Dreier was a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership.

==== Foreign affairs ====
Dreier attended and led congressional delegations (CODELs) to dozens of nations during his tenure. He was the founder and first chairman of the House Democracy Partnership (HDP), which works to strengthen parliaments in new and re-emerging democracies on six continents.

==== Transportation ====
Dreier supported the expansion of public transportation in his district. He secured federal funding for the Metro Gold Line, connecting Downtown Los Angeles and Pasadena via light rail.

====Gay rights====
Dreier initially supported the bipartisan Defense of Marriage Act, signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1996. Joining columnists like William Raspberry in opposing &quot;thought police,&quot; Dreier voted against the Matthew Shepard Act that expanded federal hate-crimes law to include crimes motivated by a victim&#x27;s actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. Dreier initially supported the Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell policy, which prevented LGBT members of the armed forces from serving openly. However, in December 2010, Dreier voted in favor of legislation that repealed the policy. Dreier opposed a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage.

==== Other activities ====
He served as parliamentarian for four Republican National Conventions.

On June 26, 2019, Dreier founded the Fallen Journalists Memorial Foundation (FJM Foundation), the main objective of which is to build a permanent memorial near the National Mall in Washington, D.C. to commemorate journalists who have been killed. One year earlier on June 28, 2018, the offices of Capital Gazette Communications, home to &quot;The Capital&quot; newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland, became the site of the deadliest attack against journalists in United States history when five were gunned down in their office. This mass shooting at &quot;The Capital&quot;, owned by Tribune Publishing Company, inspired Dreier to launch the FJM project. He serves as the chairman of the FJM Foundation.

<text>The Ford FE engine is a medium block V8 engine produced in multiple displacements over two generations by the Ford Motor Company and used in vehicles sold in the North American market between 1958 and 1976. The FE, derived from &#x27;Ford-Edsel&#x27;, was introduced just four years after the short-lived Ford Y-block engine, which American cars and trucks were outgrowing. It was designed with room to be significantly expanded, and manufactured both as a top-oiler and side-oiler, and in displacements between and .

Versions of the FE line designed for use in medium and heavy trucks and school buses from 1964 through 1978 were known as &quot;FT,&quot; for &#x27;Ford-Truck,&#x27; and differed primarily by having steel (instead of nodular iron) crankshafts, larger crank snouts, smaller ports and valves, different distributor shafts, different water pumps and a greater use of iron for its parts.

The FE block was manufactured by using a thinwall casting technique, where Ford engineers determined the required amount of metal and re-engineered the casting process to allow for consistent dimensional results. A Ford FE from the factory weighed with all iron components, while similar seven-liter offerings from GM and Chrysler weighed over . With an aluminum intake and aluminum water pump the FE could be reduced to under for racing.

The engine was produced in 427 and 428 cu in high-performance versions, and famously powered Ford GT40 MkIIs to endurance racing domination in the 24 hours of Le Mans during the mid-1960s.

== Description ==


The FE and FT engines are medium block designs, referred to as Y-block because the cylinder block casting extends below the crankshaft centerline, giving great rigidity and support to the crankshaft&#x27;s main bearings. In these engines, the casting extends below the crankshaft centerline, which is more than an inch below the bottom of the crank journals.

Blocks were cast in two major groups: top-oiler and side-oiler. The top-oiler block sent oil to the top center first, the side-oiler block sent oil along a passage located on the lower side of the block first.

All FE and FT engines have a bore spacing of , and a deck height (distance from crank center to top of block) of . The main journal (crankshaft bearing) diameter is . Within the family of Ford engines of the time, the FE was neither the largest nor smallest block.





FE engines came in a wide variety of configurations, including:

* Carbureted, including single two-barrel, single four-barrel, dual four-barrel, triple two-barrel, and quad Webers, or fuel injected
* With a top- or side-oiling block.
* With low-rise, medium-rise, high-rise, tunnel-port, or SOHC intake manifolds.

The low-rise intake, designed to fit under a low hoodline, was the first. The high-rise intake required a hood bubble for clearance. While the low- and medium-rise heads could be used in combination with either low- or medium-rise intakes, the high-rise head required a high-rise intake due to the increased height of the intake port. The medium-rise intake port is shorter and wider than the low-rise port. The high-rise ports are taller than either the low- or medium-rise ports. Low-rise intakes have the carburetor placed relatively low; the air-fuel mix must follow a more convoluted path to the combustion chambers. A high-rise intake places the carburetor approximately higher so the air-fuel mixture has a straighter path.

The tunnel-port and SOHC heads require their own matching intakes.

Within the major head groups, there are also differences in combustion chamber designs: small chambers, machined ones, and large ones. The size and type of chamber affects the compression ratio, as well as the overall performance characteristics of the engine.

===Generation 1===
====332====
The &quot;332&quot; was the original FE engine, with a displacement of , the series&#x27; smallest. It had bore and a stroke, and was used in Ford-brand cars in 1958 and 1959, domestically marketed U.S.- and Canadian-built Edsel-brand cars in 1959, and in export-configured 1958 and 1959 Edsels. The two-barrel version produced , a Holley or Autolite four-barrel version .

** 1959 Ford
** 1959 Edsel Corsair and Villager, standard equipment, (called &quot;Express V8&quot;)
====352====

Introduced in 1958 as part of the Interceptor line of Ford V8 engines, the Ford 352 of actual displacement was the replacement for the Lincoln Y-block. It is a stroked 332 with stroke and a bore, and was rated from with a 2-barrel carburetor to over on the 4-barrel models. When these engines were introduced, they were called Interceptor V-8 on the base models and Interceptor Special V-8 on the 4-barrel models. The 1958 H vin coded 352 was designated as Interceptor V-8 Thunderbird Special. The Interceptor was the base-performance engine in 1958. For the 1959 model year, the FE engine series was renamed the Thunderbird V-8 and the Thunderbird Special V-8. When installed in Mercury vehicles, these engines were named &quot;Marauder&quot;. This series of engines usually weighed over . In 1960 Ford created a high-performance version of the 352 rated at it featured an aluminum intake manifold, Holley 4100 4-barrel carburetor, cast iron header-style exhaust manifolds, 10.5:1 compression ratio, and solid lifters.

====361 Edsel====

Edsel 361 engines were assembled in Cleveland Ohio, and Dearborn Michigan. They were standard equipment in the 1958 Edsel Ranger, Pacer, Villager, Roundup and Bermuda.
The Edsel 361 was the very first FE block engine to be offered for sale in any market, having been introduced to the public in the U.S. on September 4, 1957, almost two months before any 1958 Fords were sold.
The 361 cid 4V FE engine was also sold on 1959 Edsels in the U.S. and Canada, and 1958 and 1959 Ford and Meteor brand automobiles in Canada in place of the 352 cid, which was not available with any Ford Motor Company of Canada brand until the 1960 model year. Edsel 361 engines were available to U.S. law enforcement agencies and state and municipal emergency services purchasing fleet Fords as the 1958 Ford &quot;Police Power Pack.&quot;

====360 Truck====
The 361/360, of actual displacement, was introduced in 1968 and phased out at the end of the 1976-year run; it was used in the Ford F Series trucks and pickups. It has a bore of a 390 () and used the 352&#x27;s rotating assembly. 361s and 360s were also constructed with heavy duty internal components for truck use. Use of a standard 352/390 cam for use in passenger cars along with carburetor and distributor adjustment allowed the 360 to give performance similar to that of the 352 and 390 car engines. Rated at at 4100 rpm and of torque at 2600 rpm (2-barrel carb, 1968). The 360 used the same block, heads and other parts as a 390, this makes them indistinguishable from each other unless the stroke is measured.

====390====

The 390 had a bore of , stroke of , and displacement of . It was the most common FE engine in later applications; used in many Ford cars as the standard engine, including the Thunderbird, and in many trucks as well. It was a popular high-performance engine; although not as powerful as the 427 and 428 models, it provided good performance, particularly in lighter-weight vehicles. The 2v is rated at at 4,100 rpm, while the 4v version was rated at at 4,100 rpm in certain applications. Certain 1967 and 1968 Mustangs had 390 4v engines rated at , as did some Fairlane GTs and S code Mercury Cougars.

===Generation 2===
====406====
The 406 engine was introduced in 1962 and only lasted till 1963, giving way to the 427. It used a new bore with the 390&#x27;s stroke, giving a displacement of , rounded up to &quot;406&quot; for the official designation. The larger bore required a new block casting design allowing for thicker walls, but otherwise was very similar to the 390 block.

Testing of the 406, with its higher power levels, led to cross-bolted mains – that is, main bearing caps that were secured not only by bolts at each end coming up from beneath, but also by bolts coming in from the sides through the block. A custom fit spacer was used between the cap and the block face. This design prevented the main bearing caps from &quot;walking&quot; under extreme racing conditions, and can be found today in many of the most powerful and modern engines from many manufacturers.

====410====
The 410 engine, used in 1966 and 1967 Mercurys (see Ford MEL engine regarding 1958 senior series Edsels), used the same bore as the 390 engine, but with the 428&#x27;s stroke, giving a real displacement. The standard 428 crankshaft was used, which meant that the 410, like the 428, used external balancing. A compression ratio of 10.5:1 was standard.

** 1966–1967 Mercury
====427====

The &quot;427&quot; V8 was introduced in 1963 as a &quot;top-oiler&quot;, changed to a side-oiler in 1965. Despite the &quot;427&quot; designation, its true displacement was . The stroke was the same as the 390 at , but the bore was increased to . The block was made of cast iron with a specially thickened deck to withstand higher compression. The cylinders were cast using cloverleaf molds— the corners were thicker all down the wall of each cylinder. Many 427s used a steel crankshaft, and all were balanced internally. Most 427s used solid valve lifters, with the exception of the 1968 block, which had oil passages drilled for hydraulic lifters. Higher flow heads were available with matching &quot;tunnel port&quot; intake manifolds, which routed pushrods through the intake&#x27;s ports in brass tubes. As an engine designed for racing, it had many performance parts available both from the factory and the aftermarket. This engine was also used in the A/FX-cars like the famous Fairlane Thunderbolt.

Two different 427 blocks were produced, the initial 1963 &quot;top oiler&quot; and starting in 1965 a &quot;side oiler&quot;. The top oiler delivered oil to the cam and valvetrain first and the crank second; the side oiler sent oil to the crank first and the cam and valvetrain second. This was similar to the oiling design from the earlier Y-block. The engine was available with low-rise, medium-rise, or high-rise manifolds, and either single or double four-barrel carburetors on an aluminum intake. Ford never released an official power rating.

The side-oiler-powered Ford GT40 MkIIs to a 1-2-3 finish in the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans, and the winner&#x27;s podium in 1967.

=====427 SOHC &quot;Cammer&quot;=====

The Ford single overhead cam (SOHC) 427 V8 engine, familiarly known as the &quot;Cammer&quot;, was released in 1964 in an effort to maintain NASCAR dominance by seeking to counter the enormously large block Chrysler 426 Hemi &quot;elephant&quot; engine. The Ford 427 block was closer dimensionally to the smaller 392 cu. in. first generation Chrysler FirePower Hemi; the Ford FE&#x27;s bore spacing was compared to the Chrysler 392&#x27;s . The Ford FE&#x27;s deck height of was lower than that of the Chrysler 392 at . For comparison, the 426 Hemi has a deck height of and bore spacing of ; both Chrysler Hemis have decks more than taller than the FE.

The engine was based on the high performance 427 side-oiler block, providing race-proven durability. The block and associated parts were largely unchanged, but an idler shaft replaced the camshaft in the block, which necessitated plugging the remaining camshaft bearing oiling holes.

The cast-iron heads were designed with hemispherical combustion chambers and a single overhead camshaft over each head, operating shaft-mounted roller rocker arms. The valvetrain consisted of valves larger than those on Ford wedge head engines, made out of stainless steel and with sodium-filled exhaust valves to prevent the valve heads from burning, and dual valve springs. This design allowed for high volumetric efficiency at high engine speed.

The in the block in place of the camshaft was driven by the timing chain and drove the distributor and oil pump in conventional fashion. An additional sprocket on this shaft drove a second &quot;serpentine&quot; timing chain, long, which drove both overhead camshafts. The length of this chain made precision timing of the camshafts an issue at high RPM.

The engine also had a dual-point distributor with a transistorized ignition amplifier system, running 12 amps of current through a high-output ignition coil.

The engines were essentially hand-built for racing, with combustion chambers fully machined to reduce variability. Nevertheless, Ford recommended blueprinting before use in racing applications. With a single four-barrel carburetor they weighed and were rated at at 7,000 rpm and of torque at 3,800 rpm, with dual four-barrel carburetors at 7,500 rpm and of torque at 4,200 rpm. Ford sold them via the parts counter, the single four-barrel model as part C6AE-6007-363S, the dual carburetor model as part C6AE-6007-359J for $2350.00 (as of October, 1968).

Ford&#x27;s hopes to counter Chrysler were, however, cut short. Although enough 427 SOHCs were sold to have the design homologated, Chrysler protests succeeded in getting NASCAR to effectively legislate the engine out of competition. This was due to the motor not being available in a factory production motor vehicle. It was not the only engine ever banned from NASCAR; the 1963 Chevrolet 427 ‘mystery motor’, the 1965 426 ‘Race Hemi’ and the Chrysler A-925 DOHC Hemi were also banned during the 1960s for the same reason. This scuttled the awaited 1965 SOHC versus Hemi competition at the Daytona 500 season opener.

Nevertheless, the SOHC 427 found its niche in non-stock drag racing, powering many altered-wheelbase A/FX Mustangs, and becoming the basis for a handful of supercharged Top Fuel dragsters, including those of Connie Kalitta, Pete Robinson, and Lou Baney (driven by Don &quot;the Snake&quot; Prudhomme). In 1967 Connie Kalitta&#x27;s SOHC-powered &quot;Bounty Hunter&quot; slingshot dragster won Top Fuel honors at AHRA, NHRA and NASCAR winter meets, becoming the only &quot;triple crown&quot; winner in drag racing history. It was also used in numerous nitro funny cars including those of Jack Chrisman, &quot;Dyno&quot; Don Nicholson, Eddie Schartman, Kenz &amp; Leslie, and in numerous injected gasoline drag racing vehicles.

====428====
For 1966 Ford combined attributes that had worked well in previous incarnations of the FE – a bore and a stroke – to create an easier-to-make engine. It used a cast nodular iron crankshaft and external balancer.

428 FE engines were fitted to Galaxies
(badged simply as &#x27;7 Litre&#x27;) and Thunderbirds in the 1966 and 1967 model years. It was also found in Mustangs, Mercury Cougars, some AC (Shelby) Cobras and various other Fords from 1968. This engine was also available as standard equipment in 1966 and 1967 in the Mercury S-55.

=====428 Cobra Jet=====
The &quot;428 Cobra Jet&quot; was a performance version of the 428 FE. Launched in April 1968, it was built on a regular production line using a variety of cylinder heads combined with a 735 CFM Holley four-barrel carburetor. The Cobra Jet used heavier connecting rods with a 13/32 rod bolt and a nodular iron crankshaft casting #1UB. A Holman and Moody specially prepared &quot;stripper&quot;, which carried no sound deadener, undercoating, or any optional factory equipment, was used as the introductory press car in 1968.

The 428 Cobra-Jet had a compression ratio of 10.8:1 and was rated at 5200 rpm and at 3400 rpm. Historical road test data on actual production 428 CJ cars suggest peak output in the neighborhood of 275 SAE Net (&quot;as installed&quot;) HP, using published trap speed and &quot;as tested&quot; weights, and Hale&#x27;s trap speed formula. Period road tests revealed quarter mile performance in the low 14-second to very high 13-second range, with trap speeds around :

The 428 Cobra Jet engine (modified to the NHRA Stock and Super Stock technical specifications) made its drag racing debut at 1968 NHRA Winternationals, held from February 2–4, 1968, at the Auto Club Raceway at Los Angeles County Fairgrounds, in Pomona, California. Ford Motor Company sponsored five drivers (Gas Ronda, Jerry Harvey, Hubert Platt, &quot;Dyno Don&quot; Nicholson, Kenneth McLellan, and Al Joniec) to race six 428 CJ-equipped Mustangs. They raced in classes C Stock Automatic (C/SA, ), based on advertised horsepower) and Super Stock E (SS/E or SS/EA, manual or automatic transmission, respectively, at , based on factored horsepower). The engine lived up to expectations as four of the cars made it to their respective class finals. Al Joniec won both his class (defeating Hubert Platt in an all-CJ final) and the overall Super Stock Eliminator title (defeating Dave Wren who ‘red lighted’ in his faster 426 Race Hemi Plymouth).

=====428 Super Cobra Jet=====
The &quot;428 Super Cobra Jet&quot; (also known as the 428SCJ) used the same top end, pistons, cylinder heads, camshaft, valve train, induction system, exhaust manifolds, and engine block as the 428 Cobra Jet. However, the crankshaft and connecting rods were strengthened and associated balancing altered for drag racing. A nodular iron crankshaft casting #1UA was used as well as heavier 427 &quot;Le Mans&quot; connecting rods with capscrews instead of bolts for greater durability. The heavier connecting rods and the removal of the centre counterweight on the stock 428 Cobra Jet crankshaft (1UA), required an external weight on the snout of the crankshaft for balancing. A 428 Super Cobra Jet engine with oil cooler was standard equipment when the &quot;Drag Pack&quot; option (which came when selecting either a 3.91 or 4.30 rear end gear ratio) was ordered with cars manufactured from 13 November 1968. In addition, while the CJ and SCJ engines used the same autothermic piston casting, the piston-to-bore clearance specification between the CJ and SCJ 428 engines is slightly different, with the SCJ engines gaining a slightly looser fit to permit higher operating temperature. Horsepower measurements at a &quot;street&quot; rpm level remained the same. The 428 Super Cobra Jet engine was never offered with factory air conditioning due to the location of its engine oil cooler.

==Use==
The FE series engines were used in cars, trucks, buses, and boats, as well as for industrial pumps and other equipment. Ford produced the engine from 1958 and ceased production in 1976. Aftermarket support has continued, with replacement parts as well as many newly engineered and improved components.

In Ford vehicles, the FE primarily powered full and midsize cars and trucks, though it was also installed in both pony cars and midsize muscle cars, including in dedicated drag packages like the 1964 Ford Fairlane Thunderbolt. Ford used the FE in podium-sweeping victories in its GT-40 at the 24 hours of Le Mans, supported its use in factory associated high-performance Shelby Mustangs, and Shelby made the 427 cu in version further famous in his Shelby Cobras.

Ford Galaxie,
Ford Custom 500,
Ford Mustang,
Ford Thunderbird - 3rd generation,
Ford Thunderbird - 4th generation,
Ford LTD,
Ford Torino,
Ford Ranchero,
Ford Talladega,
Ford Fairlane,
and F-Series trucks though typically only those 1 ton and lesser in capacity.

Ford regularly made updates to the design of the FE which appear as engineering codes or variations in casting numbers of parts. In addition to production casting codes, Ford also made use of &quot;SK&quot; and &quot;XE&quot; numbers if the parts were one-offs or developmental designs not approved for production. Many parts attached to Ford&#x27;s racing engines carried SK and XE numbers.

===Other uses===
In addition to its use in Ford and Mercury branded vehicles, Ford itself, used it in factory, supported racing teams, and the FE was sold to third parties for use in their own products such as buses, and boats. Also, the FE was used to power irrigation pumps, generators and other machinery where long-running, low-rpm, reliable service was required.

====In racing====


Specific models that used FE engines include the AC Cobra MKIII, GT40s, the AC Frua, as well as various factory racing versions of Ford Mustangs, Ford Galaxies, Ford Fairlanes, and Ford Thunderbirds.

In the 1960s, most organized racing events required either stock components or components that were readily available to the general public. For NASCAR racing, rules required that at least 500 vehicles be sold to the general public equipped as raced. Many drag racing and road racing organizations had similar rules, which contributed to a wide range of performance parts being made available through Ford dealership parts counters. In addition, aftermarket suppliers produced performance parts and accessories.

The use of the FE by Ford itself as the powerplant in many of its racing programs and performance vehicles resulted in constant improvements and engineering changes over the course of its life. Racing-inspired changes to the FE which later made it to production engines included the side-oiler block, which directed oil first to the lower portions of the block.

===== Road and track racing =====
In 1963, the 427 Galaxies dominated NASCAR primarily because in January 1963 G.M. told its divisions to get out of racing. Tiny Lund won the biggest race of the year, the Daytona 500, with 427s finishing first through fifth. Ford won 23 races to Plymouth&#x27;s 19. The Plymouths earned all their victories on the short tracks while Ford dominated the super speedways, Chevrolet finished with eight wins and Pontiac had four.

In 1964, Ford had their best season ever, with 30 wins. Dodge was second with 14, while Plymouth had 12. Adding the five wins that Mercury had, the 427 had a total of 35 NASCAR Grand National wins for the 1964 season. Fred Lorenzen won the Atlanta 500 and proceeded to beat Dodges and Plymouths, which were using 426 Hemi engines, in six of the next seven races. Ford was using the high-riser intake and matching heads, which were allowed by NASCAR for one season (1964).

In 1965, NASCAR banned Ford&#x27;s high-riser version of the engine, claiming they did not fit under &quot;stock&quot; hoods. Chrysler&#x27;s 426 Hemi was banned as well, returning in 1966 after a de-tuned version was installed in a production vehicle that year. For the 1965 season, Ford developed its own version of a hemi-chambered engine, the 427 single overhead cam (SOHC) &quot;Cammer&quot; which used a single chain-driven overhead camshaft per head to operate the valves in its hemi. NASCAR relegated the engine to the fullsize Galaxie. Then Ford developed the medium-riser intake and head, which fit under stock hoods and was accepted by NASCAR. Ned Jarrett, driving for Ford, was the 1965 Grand National champion and Ford won the NASCAR crown.

Also in 1965, Ford and Carroll Shelby began production of a new and improved Cobra using a FE side-oiler in place of the original&#x27;s Windsor small-block. A new chassis was built enlarging 3&quot; main tubing to 4&quot;, with coil springs all around. The new car also had wide fenders and a larger radiator opening. The S/C (for semi-competition) &quot;street&quot; engine was rated at , which provided a top speed of , and the competition version (csx 6000) with a top speed of . Cobra Mark III production began on 1 January 1965, and was used for racing into the 1970s. An original S/C sold in 2011 for US$1.5 million, making it one of the most valuable Cobra variants.

In 1966, the 427 cubic inch Ford GT40 Mk II dominated the 24 Hours of Le Mans race, with a one-two-three result.

In 1967, Parnelli Jones, in a Holman-Moody prepped Fairlane, won the season-opening Riverside 500 road race. Then, Mario Andretti captured the Daytona 500 in a Fairlane, with Fred Lorenzen a close second in his Holman-Moody Ford. The FE again powered the 24 Hours of Le Mans winner. In 1968, the rules of the race were changed, limiting displacement to 302 cubic inches under certain circumstances. Ford won the following two years using its Ford Windsor smallblock in the GT40.

Ford&#x27;s racing partner, privately owned Holman-Moody, also developed a version of the FE for the Can-Am racing series. It used factory-supplied tunnel port heads, a mechanical fuel injection system mounted on a crossram intake manifold, and a revised dry sump oiling system, but met with only limited success.

===== Drag racing =====
Organized drag racing (NHRA, AHRA and even NASCAR dabbled in drag racing in the mid-1960s) was a major venue for the FE in its various forms. Many of the most innovative products were developed and used for 1/4 mile drag racing as aftermarket suppliers eagerly supported the engine design with products such as special intakes, camshafts, superchargers, manifolds, cylinder heads, water and fuel pumps, and exhaust headers. But it was the Ford company itself which developed the most potent products and platforms for the drag-racer. Beginning in 1962 and continuing through 1964, Ford made lightweight versions of its popular Galaxie model using aluminum, fiberglass and specially chosen components emphasizing light weight over comfort or style. Many parts were simply not put on the vehicle, such as a passenger side windshield wiper, sound deadening, armrests, heater, and radio.

In late 1964, Ford contracted Holman &amp; Moody to prepare ten 427-powered Mustangs to contest the National Hot Rod Association&#x27;s (NHRA) A/Factory Experimental Class in the 1965 drag racing season. Five of these special Mustangs made their competition debut at the 1965 NHRA Winternationals, where they qualified in the Factory Stock FX Eliminator Class for (FX cars only). The car driven by Bill Lawton won the class.

For the 1964 model year, Ford introduced the two-door Fairlane 500 sedan-based Thunderbolt. Modified to accept a 427 high-riser engine, it featured a teardrop-shaped bubble hood to clear the induction system and drivetrain components from the larger Galaxie model. The two inner headlights were eliminated and replaced with air inlets ducted directly to the two four-barrel carbs. It was an industry first, the only time that a turn key drag car was made available to the general public. However, the extensive modifications to the car did not meet Ford appearance quality standards.

The 1964 NHRA Super Stock meeting was captured with a Thunderbolt. However, all three NHRA Top Stock Eliminator titles were won by Chrysler&#x27;s Race Hemi. Nearly half a century later, in 2013, a Thunderbolt set a new SS/A record of 8.55 seconds in the quarter mile, with a closing speed of 154 mph,

In 1963, Dick Brannan set the NHRA Super/Stock National record at 12.42 on a hot July day. In the biggest race of the year, the INDY Nationals, Ed Martin&#x27;s lightweight Galaxie lost the Super Stock trophy run to John Barker&#x27;s Dodge but at the teardown, the Dodge was found to have an illegal cam. In drag racing, the 427 Ford Galaxie was a winner in three consecutive National Events: the &#x27;64 Indy Nationals, the 1965 WinterNationals and the 1965 Indy Nationals. It was Mike Schmitt driving the Desert Motors Galaxie to the AA/SA Class win at the 1964 Indy Nationals. At the 1965 Winternationals it was a clean sweep as Doug Butler&#x27;s four-speed took the win in AA/S with a 12.77 at 114.21 and Bill Hanyon won on the automatic side with a 12.24 at 117.95. Additionally, Bud Schellenberger&#x27;s &quot;Double A Stock&quot; 1964 Galaxie was the 1965 Indy Nationals Top Stock Eliminator with a 12.16 at 114.21. The Shelby Super Snake top fuel dragster, powered by a 427 supercharged SOHC, became the first car in NHRA competition to break the six-second quarter-mile time barrier. It was the winner of the 1966 NHRA Spring Nationals. In every decade since, the FE has held drag-racing records. In 2011, the new decade opens with the NHRA SS/F (class rules include stock compression ratio, stock valve sizes, stock carb sizing and other OEM-type equipment limitations) national record: the quartermile in 9.29 seconds, with a closing speed of 143.63 mph.

===== Other closed course racing =====
In 1970, an FE-powered vehicle set the land speed record for the U.K. Tony Densham set the new British land speed record of just over over the flying kilometer (the average of two runs in opposite directions within an hour) and then held onto the record for over 30 years. The FE-powered vehicle beat the official British wheel-driven record over the flying 500 and kilometer distances, until then held by Sir Malcolm Campbell, of 174.883 mph

====Custom automobiles====
The FE engine is used extensively in custom installations. The extensive availability of multi-carburetor and other exotic intakes, as well as many other &quot;dress-up parts&quot;, has contributed to its use where the engine would be shown off. FEs powered the original Batmobiles built by George Barris for the 1966 TV series. It fit under the hood along with the Bat-ray, Bat-ram, a nose-mounted aluminum chain slicer and all the associated support hardware of the 5,500-pound vehicle. One dragstrip version was equipped with a Holman-Moody prepped 427 FE with dual quads, which would be launched in second gear and spin its tires the entire quarter-mile length of the track. In 1968 Carroll Shelby created a custom Mustang using a California Special model and an experimental Ford 428 FE (known as a CJX, precursor to the 428 Cobra Jet). This &quot;Green Hornet&quot; had a custom independent rear suspension, four-wheel disc brakes and a Conelec electronically controlled port fuel injection system. It had a 5.7 sec 0-60 time and 157 mph top speed, versus a factory 428 cu in FE Shelby GT500&#x27;s 6.5 second 0-60 and 128 mph top speed.

====Marine applications====
The FE was popular in V-drive marine applications, available as a factory option in Century boats.

Beginning in 1968, the U.S. Navy SEALS used twin 427 FEs to power their Light SEAL Support Craft (LSSC).
== Replacement ==
By the mid-1970s the FE had been widely used in Ford vehicles for nearly two decades. To replace it, Ford had developed the 335-series engines, commonly referred to as &quot;Cleveland&quot; engines, and the 385-series engines. These were produced in displacements ranging from up to , including , giving Ford V8s of , , and . The last FE was installed in a production vehicle in 1976, and in the late 1970s the Dearborn Engine Plant that produced the FE engines was completely retooled to produce the 1.6-liter engine introduced in the Ford Escort in 1981.

<text>Warren Bruce Cuccurullo (born December 8, 1956) is an American musician, songwriter, restaurant owner, and former bodybuilder who first worked with Frank Zappa during the 1970s. He was also a founding member of Missing Persons in the 1980s. In 1989, Cuccurullo joined Duran Duran, becoming a long-term member of the band until 2001. In 2022, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Duran Duran.

==Personal life==
Warren Bruce Cuccurullo is the son of Jerry and Ellen Cuccurullo, the oldest child of four. He has two brothers, Jerry and Robert and a sister, Stephanie. His Italian-American heritage has its roots in Nocera Inferiore in Campania, Italy, and he also has some Greek ancestry. He grew up in the Canarsie neighborhood of Brooklyn, and began playing drums and guitar as a young child. He graduated from Canarsie High School in 1974.

Cuccurullo has one adopted child, Mayko Cuccurullo (born 1983), who lives in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and is the son of Warren&#x27;s former longtime girlfriend Claudia Bueno. Mayko is featured in the Duran Duran video &quot;Breath After Breath&quot;, filmed in Argentina in 1993 and contributed some minor vocal work on the &quot;N&#x27;Liten Up&quot; project.

Cuccurullo returned to the United States in 2001 and lives in Venice, California. His current focus is on film score compositions.

==1977–1980: The Zappa years==
In his teen years, Cuccurullo became a devoted fan of Frank Zappa and began traveling to every show within 500 miles of his Brooklyn home. During the mid-1970s, he befriended several members of Zappa&#x27;s band, including Terry Bozzio and Patrick O&#x27;Hearn. Over the next three years, he appeared with the band on stage at a couple of shows as well as in the 1979 Zappa film &quot;Baby Snakes&quot; (filmed October 1977). He impressed Frank Zappa by knowing the guitar parts to every Zappa song in the catalog, including the strangest sounds and most bizarre time signatures.

In December 1978, at the age of 22, Cuccurullo was invited to audition as a guitarist for Zappa&#x27;s new road band, in which many members were replaced (including Bozzio and O&#x27;Hearn). Several shows on the early 1979 &quot;Human Jukebox&quot; European/Asian tour were recorded for Zappa&#x27;s live albums. After the tour, Cuccurullo returned to the studio with Zappa to work on the &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot; albums, for which he provided rhythm guitar and several vocal parts. Terry Bozzio&#x27;s wife Dale Bozzio also contributed vocal parts to the album. Cuccurullo and Dale Bozzio began writing songs together, and eventually they convinced Terry Bozzio that the three of them should launch their own band.

Zappa asked Cuccurullo to play on his 1988 tour, but the latter&#x27;s involvement with Duran Duran had begun by then and so he declined.

Cuccurullo is name-checked four times on Zappa&#x27;s &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot;, first by (Dale Bozzio&#x27;s character) Mary in &quot;Catholic Girls&quot;, by Zappa (in character here as Larry) in &quot;Crew Slut&quot;, when reassuring Mary, &quot;of &quot;course&quot; I&#x27;ll introduce you to Warren!&quot;, in the track &quot;Sy Borg&quot; when Ike Willis sings &quot;little leather cap and trousers – they look so gay... Warren just bought some,&quot; and once again by Zappa during &quot;A Little Green Rosetta&quot; &#x27;Then everybody moves to New York and goes to a party with Warren. hey!&#x27;

==1980–1986: The Missing Persons years==

In 1980, Cuccurullo and the two Bozzios formed Missing Persons, recording a 4-song EP called &quot;Missing Persons&quot; with session musicians, including future keyboardist Chuck Wild. They then toured to promote the EP and appeared in the movie &quot;Lunch Wagon&quot;. By 1981, the group had added fellow Zappa alumnus Patrick O&#x27;Hearn, and Chuck Wild had become an official bandmember. Two years of hard work led to a signing with Capitol Records in 1982, the release of the album &quot;Spring Session M&quot;, and the subsequent success of Missing Persons on radio and MTV. The singles &quot;Mental Hopscotch&quot;, &quot;Destination Unknown&quot;, &quot;Walking in L.A.&quot;, &quot;Words&quot;, and &quot;Windows&quot; all met with success. They appeared at the three-day Southern California concert, the US Festival in May 1983.

In 1984, Cuccurullo invented a new type of guitar he called the &quot;Missing Link&quot;, and used it on the experimental album &quot;Rhyme &amp; Reason&quot; (1984). The band followed up with the more conventional &quot;Color in Your Life&quot; in June 1986, but during the short-lived promotional tour, increasing tensions between then-husband and wife Terry and Dale Bozzio led to the end of the tour and the band.

On his own again, Cuccurullo began recording some music in his bedroom that was eventually released on his solo album &quot;Machine Language&quot;.

==1986–2001: The Duran Duran years==
Missing Persons shared their label Capitol Records with British band Duran Duran. As Missing Persons fell apart, Bozzio and O&#x27;Hearn were approached by Duran Duran guitarist Andy Taylor in Los Angeles for work on a solo album. In this way, Cuccurullo learned that Taylor did not intend to rejoin Duran Duran in England to work on their next album, even before the rest of Duran Duran knew. Cuccurullo sent a tape and a request for an audition, but was turned down, with some puzzlement.

As it became clear that neither enticements nor lawsuits would get Taylor back in the studio, Duran Duran hired Cuccurullo as a session guitarist to complete the album &quot;Notorious&quot;. He went on to tour with the band, and returned to contribute his increasingly experimental guitar work to the album &quot;Big Thing&quot;. At the end of the grueling ten-month &quot;Big Thing&quot; world tour (in June 1989), Cuccurullo was made an official member of the band, and moved to London. Shifting record label politics and the unsuccessful album &quot;Liberty&quot; almost derailed the band, but after Cuccurullo offered them the use of his home studio (named &quot;Privacy&quot;) in Battersea, Duran Duran was able to shift to a more comfortable and controlled music-making style.

Cuccurullo&#x27;s songwriting, guitar skills and driving personality contributed to the band&#x27;s return to fame with 1993&#x27;s &quot;Wedding Album&quot;. He earned co-writing credits on the hit singles &quot;Ordinary World&quot; and &quot;Come Undone&quot;, although the lyrics were written by Simon Le Bon. He created new arrangements for many of the band&#x27;s old hits for the acoustic-flavored tour that followed, as well as arranging full acoustic pieces for the piano and six-piece string section that performed with them on the &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; show. After Frank Zappa&#x27;s death in December 1993, Cuccurullo performed the instrumental guitar piece &quot;Watermelon in Easter Hay&quot; (from the &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot; album) in his honor at several Duran Duran shows.

Tentative plans for a Missing Persons reunion in 1994 were shelved over remaining tensions between former band members.

Cuccurullo and keyboardist Nick Rhodes continued to hold Duran Duran together during the band&#x27;s lean times in the 1990s. The covers album &quot;Thank You&quot; (1995) was an attempt to keep the peace among band members who had increasing trouble writing music together. &quot;Medazzaland&quot; (1997) and &quot;Pop Trash&quot; (2000)—written after the departure of bassist John Taylor and Duran Duran&#x27;s separation from Capitol Records—featured mostly new Cuccurullo/Rhodes songs and reworked TV Mania material, but failed to dent the charts even though the band sold out multiple nights in most cities on the 2000/2001 tour.

In early 2001, Cuccurullo was asked to leave the band so that the original members of Duran Duran could reunite. At first the split was amicable, hingeing on a financial settlement which granted him compensation from the band&#x27;s forthcoming reunion album (to which he was not expected to contribute). Two years later relations soured considerably during the reunited band&#x27;s American tour when he was asked by management not to attend the Los Angeles show after the band had invited him (no reason was given), and he began confirming some of the rumors that had spread about the 2001 split. Cuccurullo claimed that he was fired from Duran Duran by letter because Rhodes and Le Bon feared his reaction, though he told Duran Duran biographer Steve Malins, &quot;I would never get aggressive in a situation like that. There were things that had to be sorted out in a professional manner, so that&#x27;s what I did.&quot; Cucurrullo remained on good terms with Rhodes, however, and in 2013 they released an album containing material from their Duran Duran side project, TV Mania.

In 2022, Cuccurullo was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Duran Duran alongside Rhodes, Le Bon, and the three Taylors. He played guitar on two of the songs on the band&#x27;s 2023 album &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;: the title track and a cover of 1993&#x27;s &quot;Love Voodoo&quot;.

==TV Mania==
Beginning in the early 1990s, Cuccurullo collaborated with Duran Duran bandmate Nick Rhodes, calling themselves TV Mania, and began writing an experimental rock opera trilogy called &quot;Bored with Prozac and the Internet?&quot; (initially unreleased save for a few songs on Cuccurullo&#x27;s website and in the movie &quot;Trollywood&quot;). Rhodes and Cuccurullo wrote and recorded a song called &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; with vocalist Tessa Niles for the James Bond film &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;. The song wasn&#x27;t chosen, so Duran Duran re-recorded it for the &quot;Pop Trash&quot; album with new lyrics under the title &quot;Last Day on Earth&quot;. In December 1996, Rhodes and Cuccurullo wrote and produced two songs for a never-completed Blondie project (&quot;Pop Trash Movie&quot; and &quot;Studio 54&quot;); the re-recording of the former gave the &quot;Pop Trash&quot; album its name.

The Duran Duran albums &quot;Medazzaland&quot; and &quot;Pop Trash&quot; were made up of reworked TV Mania songs, with Rhodes writing all lyrics to the songs on &quot;Pop Trash&quot; except for &quot;Someone Else Not Me&quot;.

The full, 11-track album &quot;Bored with Prozac and the Internet?&quot; was given an official release on March 11, 2013.

==Solo and collaborative work==
During breaks in Duran Duran&#x27;s 1989–1990 tour schedule, Cuccurullo worked with Tetsuya Komuro, Shenkar and Patrick O&#x27;Hearn.

In 1994, the preparations for a solo show near his hometown led to a burst of creativity; he recorded and mixed the &quot;Thanks 2 Frank&quot; album in less than ten days, with bassists Pino Palladino and Nick Beggs and ex-Zappa drummer Vinnie Colaiuta. The album was released on Imago Records in 1996.

In 1997 Cuccurullo completed &quot;Machine Language&quot;, an ambient instrumental guitar album, also released on Imago. He followed up with a live album, &quot;Roadrage&quot; in 1998 (on Bandai Records). &quot;The Blue&quot; (recorded with Shenkar in 1992) was self-released in 2000. Another ambient album, &quot;Trance Formed&quot;, was released on One Way Records in 2003.

In 2005, Cuccurullo and Terry Bozzio collaborated on a CD titled &quot;Playing in Tongues&quot;, which was released in Europe on Edel Records and in the US on Zappa Records in 2009.

Cuccurullo also completed a concept album titled &quot;N&#x27;Liten Up&quot;, recorded at the Village studios in West Los Angeles by Kent Huffnagle and produced by Simone Sello.

==Missing Persons redux==

&quot;Spring Session M&quot; was released on CD in 1995, followed by &quot;Rhyme and Reason&quot; and &quot;Color in Your Life&quot; in 2000. Each of the three studio CDs were newly augmented by six rare B-sides or live tracks. &quot;Classic Remasters&quot; is a compilation of remastered tracks and dance mixes issued by Capitol Records with no band involvement.

Beginning in 1997, Cuccurullo began work on his &quot;Missing Persons Archival Trilogy&quot; project. The first CD to be released was &quot;Late Nights Early Days&quot; in 1998, a live concert recorded in 1981 with the added 1980 studio track &quot;Action/Reaction&quot;. This was followed up by a compilation of modern remixes of classic MP tracks, &quot;Missing Persons Remixed Hits&quot; (1999) which included the TV Mania remix of &quot;Destination Unknown&quot;. In 2002 &quot;Lost Tracks&quot; was released, a collection of extremely rare Missing Persons live tracks from five different eras of the band.

Meanwhile, in late 2000, Cuccurullo and Dale Bozzio again began discussing a Missing Persons reunion to feature original members Warren, Dale Bozzio and Terry Bozzio, with new keyboardist Ron Poster (of Dale Bozzio&#x27;s band) and bassist Wes Wehmiller (formerly in Cuccurullo&#x27;s solo band and Duran Duran&#x27;s tour bassist from 1997 to 2001). The short-lived, official reunion consisted of promotional activities and three live performances in July 2001.

Late 2002/early 2003 brought us &quot;Missing Persons featuring Dale Bozzio and Warren Cuccurullo&quot;. Filling in were keyboardist Ron Poster, bassist Wes Wehmiller and drummer Joe Travers (formerly in Cuccurullo&#x27;s solo band and Duran Duran&#x27;s tour drummer from 1999 to 2001). This version of Missing Persons was featured on Access Hollywood (performing &quot;Destination Unknown&quot;) and did three live performances in February 2003. Following this, Dale Bozzio returned to touring as Missing Persons with hired musicians. In 2011 Cuccurullo rejoined Bozzio as part of another short-lived Missing Persons reunion tour.

==Restaurant projects==
In mid-2002, Cuccurullo purchased an Italian restaurant called Via Veneto in Santa Monica, California. More recently, he also funded the opening of a restaurant called Hidden and Vietnamese cuisine restaurants with Michael &quot;Bao&quot; Huynh.

==Return to music==
Re-focusing on his music, Cuccurullo started a new collaborative project with composer Eric Alexandrakis, drummer Steve Ferrone, and producer Anthony J. Resta. Explaining the purpose of that project in a Modern Drummer news release Alexandrakis said, &quot;The four of us decided to create a scoring collective to pursue scoring projects in TV themes, film, and advertising…&quot;

Cuccurullo released the debut album from his collaborative effort with vocalist Neil Carlill, Chicanery, on May 11, 2010. Recorded a few years earlier, the album, also titled &quot;Chicanery&quot;, was released on CD and digital media through Recordings. Musicians who joined Cuccurullo and Carlill for selected sessions on the &quot;Chicanery&quot; album included among others, Terry Bozzio, Joe Travers, sarangi virtuoso Ustad Sultan Khan, and producer Simone Sello.

Also in 2010, Cuccurullo formed a local free jazz group called Theoretical 5 in Mar Vista, Los Angeles with Frank Zappa alumni Arthur Barrow (bass) and Tommy Mars (keyboards, vocals), and also Larry Klimas (saxophone), and Andy Kravitz (drums, percussion).

<text>Jeremy Collier (; 23 September 1650 – 26 April 1726) was an English theatre critic, non-juror bishop and theologian.

==Life==

Born Jeremiah Collier, in Stow cum Quy, Cambridgeshire, Collier was educated at Caius College, University of Cambridge, receiving the BA (1673) and MA (1676). A supporter of James II, he refused, as a nonjuror (see Nonjuring schism) to take the oath of allegiance to William III and Mary II after the Glorious Revolution. Furthering his obvious disapproval of the new monarchs, he publicly absolved two Jacobites who had conspired to assassinate the King and Queen. In 1713 he was consecrated a non-juror bishop by George Hickes and two Scottish bishops, Archibald Campbell and James Gadderar.

==Works==

Collier was the primus of the nonjuring line and a strong supporter of the four usages. (see Nonjuring schism) In the years following the Revolution he wrote a series of tracts questioning the legitimacy of the new monarchs and the deprival of the Non-juror bishops. He was well known for his &quot;Ecclesiastical History of Great Britain&quot;, 1708–1714, which was attacked for its tendentious political and theological comments, but nevertheless widely used. His &quot;Reasons for restoring some prayers and directions, as they stand in the communion-service of the first English reform&#x27;d liturgy&quot;, 1717 was the first salvo in the usages debate. His Essays were popular in his own day but are now little read. Collier wrote anti-theatrical polemic but was a high-church monarchist, unlike the many Puritans who wrote in this genre as well.
Collier also translated the &quot;Meditations&quot; of Marcus Aurelius into English.

===Collier Controversy===

In the history of English drama, Collier is known for his anti-theatrical attack on the comedy of the 1690s in his &quot;Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage&quot; (1698), which draws for its ammunition mostly on the plays of William Congreve, John Vanbrugh, John Dryden, and Thomas D&#x27;Urfey. At the start of the English Civil War (1642) theatres were closed and in 1647 a law was passed to punish anyone who participated in or viewed drama. After the war, and during the English Interregnum, the Puritans, under Oliver Cromwell, had control of most of the English government. They placed heavy restrictions on entertainment and entertainment venues that were perceived as being pagan or immoral. In the English Restoration (1660), playwrights reacted against the Puritanical restrictions with much more decadent plays. The plays produced in the Restoration drew comparisons to the great Elizabethan dramas by critics of the day. However, these plays were considered vulgar because they mocked and disrespected marriage, morals, and the clergy. Furthermore, King Charles II allowed women to act on stage; some of the first actresses were of ill-repute. Collier&#x27;s pamphlets sought to stem the spread of vice but turned out to be the sparks that kindled a controversial flame between like-minded Puritans and Restoration dramatists.

Collier devotes nearly 300 pages to decry what he perceived as profanity and moral degeneration in the stage productions of the era. This ranged from general attacks on the morality of Restoration theatre to very specific indictments of playwrights of the day. Collier argued that a venue as influential as the theatre—it was believed then that the theatre should be providing moral instruction—should not have content that is morally detrimental. These pamphlets began a pamphlet war between Collier and some playwrights like Vanbrugh. Many of the playwrights responded with equally vehement attacks, but some were so deeply affected, they withdrew from theatre permanently or substantially changed their approach to writing comedies, Congreve amongst them.

==Aftermath==
Although the theatre styles of the Restoration lasted a while even after Collier&#x27;s pamphlets, a new and more restrained theatre began to develop due, in part, to Collier&#x27;s critiques. Due to the strict morals of the Puritans as well as others such as Collier, neoclassical drama began to emerge even while Restoration drama was still flourishing. During Collier&#x27;s time, Societies for the Reformation of Manners dedicated themselves to maintaining honour in playhouses.

== Dictionary ==

Collier published an early encyclopedia in 1701, &quot;The Great Historical, Geographical, Genealogical and Poetical Dictionary&quot;. He freely admitted that the text was based on a number of earlier historians, but especially out of the eighth edition of Louis Moréri&#x27;s &quot;Grand Dictionnaire Historique&quot;. This was issued in two volumes in London from 1701 to 1705 with an appendix covering the time period from 1688 &quot;by another hand&quot; being issued in the latter year. A further appendix was issued in 1721 and a second edition in 1727. The work was not considered a success as Collier&#x27;s additions were not of the same quality as the source text and it came out during the same period as the &quot;Lexicon Technicum&quot;.

==Death==
Collier died on 26 April 1726 and was buried on 29 April in Old St Pancras Churchyard. The grave is lost but Collier is not listed on the Burdett-Coutts Memorial to the important graves lost therein.

<text>The 107th United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, composed of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. It met in Washington, D.C., from January 3, 2001, to January 3, 2003, during the final weeks of the Clinton presidency and the first two years of the George W. Bush presidency. The apportionment of seats in this House of Representatives was based on the 1990 United States census.

The House of Representatives had a Republican majority throughout the session, while the Senate was tied 50–50 for only the second time in history resulting in numerous changes in the majority. Vice President Al Gore gave Democrats a majority for 17 days, then a Republican majority after Dick Cheney became Vice President on January 20, 2001. Senator Jim Jeffords (R-VT) became an independent who caucused with the Democrats on June 6, 2001, giving the party a 51–49 majority for the rest of the Congress.

When Bush was sworn in as president on January 20, the Republicans held a federal trifecta for the first time since the 83rd Congress in 1955.

==Major events==

A rare even split in the United States Senate, the defection of a Senator, and the inauguration of a new Vice President, led to &quot;three&quot; changes in majorities.

* January 3, 2001: The 107th Congress officially begins, with the Senate split 50–50. Democrat Al Gore — the outgoing Vice President — briefly gives the Democrats a majority.
* January 3, 2001: First Lady Hillary Clinton, wife of outgoing President Bill Clinton, became the first, and, to date, only presidential spouse to hold political office (briefly serving as &quot;both&quot; First Lady and Senator).
* January 20, 2001: George W. Bush was sworn in as the 43rd President of the United States; simultaneously, Dick Cheney was sworn in as the 46th Vice President, giving Republicans a Senate majority.
* February 27, 2001: President Bush addressed a joint session of Congress.
* May 24, 2001: Senator Jim Jeffords left the Republican Party, becoming an independent who caucused with the Democrats, giving them a majority from June 6.
* September 11, 2001: The September 11 attacks occurred.
* September 20, 2001: President Bush addressed a joint session of Congress, announcing the investigation into the September 11 attacks.
* October 7, 2001: Operation Enduring Freedom began with airstrikes against the Taliban.
* October 9, 2001: Anthrax spores were mailed to, among others, two Senators, Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT).
* December 2001: Accounting scandals arise from the financial practices of Enron and WorldCom.
* June 12, 2002: John Howard, the Prime Minister of Australia, addressed a joint session of Congress. The address was originally scheduled for September 12, 2001, but was postponed after the September 11 attacks.
* September 6, 2002: Over 300 members of both houses of Congress meet in Federal Hall, New York City, to mark the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks and memorialize the victims.
* October 25, 2002: Senator Paul Wellstone (D-MN), dies in a plane crash, and non-caucusing Independence Party member Dean Barkley is appointed to hold the seat until a special election was held.
* November 23, 2002: Jim Talent wins the United States Senate special election for a Missouri seat, giving Republicans the majority once again (though formal reorganization was delayed until the 108th United States Congress convened).

<doc id="408917" wikidata="Q672919" url="?curid=408917" title="Brad Sherman">
<text>Bradley James Sherman (born October 24, 1954) is an American accountant and politician serving as the U.S. representative for California&#x27;s 32nd congressional district. A member of the Democratic Party, he first entered Congress in 1997. Sherman represented California&#x27;s 24th congressional district for three terms, California&#x27;s 27th congressional district for five terms, and California&#x27;s 30th congressional district for five terms. His district includes parts of the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles County and the eastern part of the Simi Hills in Ventura County.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Sherman was born in Los Angeles, the son of Lane (from the Philadelphia area) and Maurice Hyman Sherman (from Indiana). His parents were both of Ukrainian Jewish descent. He attended Mark Keppel High School and Corona del Mar High School. He received a B.A. in political science from University of California, Los Angeles, in 1974, and a J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1979. He is a Certified Public Accountant who worked at one of the nations&#x27; Big Four accounting firms. As part of his work there, he helped represent the Philippine government under Corazon Aquino in a successful effort to seize assets of deposed president Ferdinand Marcos. Sherman was an instructor at Harvard Law School&#x27;s International Tax Program.

===Board of Equalization (1991–1997)===
Sherman served on the California State Board of Equalization from 1991 to 1997. He chaired the Board from 1991 to 1995.

The 1990 campaign for the Board seat involved numerous attacks. Claude Parrish, Sherman&#x27;s Republican opponent, said that Arlo Smith, the (ultimately unsuccessful) Democratic nominee for attorney general, had declined to endorse Sherman for the Board seat. Sherman called it &quot;one of the most outrageous hit pieces in contemporary California political history&quot;.

In turn, Sherman claimed that Parrish’s ice cream company had been shut down in 1985 for failure to pay state income taxes. However, Parrish said that he had actually sold the company in 1983, just before its business license was suspended for a month by the state Franchise Tax Board. Sherman said that he relied on public records in making his allegations. Besides, Sherman said, the 1983 suspension could only have occurred because of previous tax delinquencies.

Sherman was re-elected to the Board of Equalization in 1994, but resigned January 3, 1997, having been elected to Congress.

==U.S. House of Representatives ==

===Elections===

In 1994, incumbent Democratic U.S. representative Anthony C. Beilenson of California&#x27;s 24th congressional district barely survived the Republican Revolution, winning re-election by a two-point margin, by far the worst election performance of his career. In 1996, Beilenson decided to retire.

Sherman then ran for the seat, and won the seven-candidate Democratic primary with 54% of the vote. In the general election, he defeated Republican nominee Rich Sybert (also the 1994 nominee), 49%–44%. He has not faced another contest nearly that close since. In 1998, he was reelected with 57% of the vote. Since then, he has been reelected every two years with at least 62%.

;2012

Redistricting following the 2010 census drew the homes of Sherman and fellow Democrat Howard Berman, who had previously represented the 28th district, into the 30th district. The redrawn 30th was more Sherman&#x27;s district than Berman&#x27;s; Sherman retained about 60% of his former territory, while Berman kept 20% of his former voters. On June 5, 2012, Sherman faced Berman in the primary for the 30th district. Sherman finished first, leading 42% to 32%. Under California&#x27;s new election system, which put the two candidates who received the most votes in the primary against each other, regardless of party, the two faced each other again in the general election. Neither candidate was endorsed by the state Democratic Party.

Berman was the more established candidate. He was endorsed by over 20 congressmen, including party leaders Steny Hoyer and Xavier Becerra, sitting Governor Jerry Brown, sitting Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, and the state&#x27;s two U.S. senators, Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein. He was endorsed by ten Republican congressmen from California: David Dreier, Wally Herger, Dan Lungren, Elton Gallegly, Buck McKeon, Ed Royce, Jerry Lewis, Ken Calvert, Mary Bono Mack, and Darrell Issa. He was endorsed by two Republican U.S. senators, John McCain and Lindsey Graham, and by Independent U.S. senator Joe Lieberman. Sherman was endorsed by then-lieutenant governor (and future governor) Gavin Newsom, former president Bill Clinton, and former Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis.

In the general election, Sherman defeated Berman, 60%–40%.

First elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1996, Sherman is serving his 12th term in Congress. He is a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Sherman has held over 160 Town Hall meetings since being elected to Congress.

Sherman voted with President Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 100% of the time in the 117th Congress, according to a &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; analysis.

====Environment====

Serving on the House Budget Committee in 1997, Sherman authored the Sherman Amendment to the Budget Resolution, providing an additional $700 million for the acquisition of environmentally important lands in FY 1998. Sherman has earned a 100% rating from the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters.

====Transportation====
He has introduced legislation to implement a mandatory nighttime curfew at Bob Hope Airport to reduce airport noise in the San Fernando Valley.

In 2022, Sherman expressed concern about the construction of an underground metro line connecting San Fernando Valley with the influent neighborhood of Westside. Sherman asked the LA Metro to listen to concerns by prominent Westside residents, such as Fred Rosen and the Bel Air Association Metro Committee. In his letter to LA Metro, Sherman argued that a subway station would not useful in Westside because students at University of California, Los Angeles (which is located in Westside) do not like using the subway.

====Economy====
During the debate over the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, Sherman was an early and outspoken critic of the proposal, leading the House revolt against the bill, a move that made him &quot;spectacularly unpopular with both the Republican and Democratic leaderships, not to mention K Street&quot;. He argued that Bush and his advisors had created a panic atmosphere in an effort to get lawmakers to rubber-stamp the bill.

Sherman opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), arguing that they cost American jobs, fail to protect foreign workers, harm the environment, and cost U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars. He has also opposed a Free Trade Agreement with South Korea, arguing that such an agreement could undermine U.S. security and economic interests by benefiting China and North Korea.

In 2010, Sherman received a 61% rating from the Chamber of Commerce and a 55% rating from the National Federation of Independent Business. In 2018, the Chamber of Commerce gave Sherman a 55% rating on issues relating to budget, spending, and taxes, and a 41% rating on issues relating to businesses and consumers.

====Social Security and health care====
Sherman has said he is &quot;opposed to creating a voucher system for Medicare&quot;. He wants to avoid &quot;turn[ing] Social Security into a welfare program&quot;, instead keeping it &quot;for people who contribute to it&quot;. Sherman has consistently earned a 100% rating from the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare and the AARP. He supports the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Sherman helped secure funds to develop a new women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s patient wing at El Proyecto del Barrio&#x27;s Family Health Care Clinic in Winnetka.

====Housing====
Sherman introduced the Preserving Equal Access to Mortgage Finance Programs Act (HR 1754), which raises the conforming loan limit for FHA loans in high-cost areas such as Sherman&#x27;s district.

====Foreign relations====
In August 2010, Sherman introduced legislation aimed at rescinding China&#x27;s Most Favored Nation status as long as there was not &quot;a more level playing field between our two nations&quot;. He said, &quot;the U.S.-China trade relationship is horrendously lopsided&quot;.

Sherman has introduced or co-sponsored more than 20 bills in the 111th and 112th Congresses that he says &quot;enact tougher sanctions to isolate Iran economically and diplomatically&quot;. His efforts have included legislation designed to close loopholes for U.S. companies with subsidiaries operating in Iran, and to curtail U.S. funding of international organizations providing loans to Iran.

Sherman has been a strong supporter and advocate of the U.S-Israel relationship, consistently supporting aid to Israel. In 2016, he called the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), Washington&#x27;s chief pro-Israel lobbying and advocacy organization, &quot;the single most important organization in promoting the U.S.-Israel alliance&quot;. In 2004, Sherman first introduced the U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation Act. It provides grants to joint ventures between American and Israeli academics and private companies that conduct research and develop energy-efficient and renewable energy technologies.

On July 9, 2014, Sherman appeared as a guest commentator on the Al Jazeera America&#x27;s network. During his appearance, he criticized the network&#x27;s Qatar-based owners for funding Hamas. Sherman said: &quot;Every one of those rockets [fired by Hamas into Israeli cities] is a war crime, almost every one. Of course it&#x27;s a war crime committed by Hamas. And of course the owners of this TV network help fund Hamas.&quot; Sherman emphasized that Hamas often aims attacks at civilian targets. The Qatari government owns Al Jazeera.

In December 2014, Sherman and Representative Pete Roskam requested new sanctions on Qatar in a letter to Secretary of Treasury Jack Lew. They also asked for a detailed accounting of public and private financing from within Qatar for Hamas, Al-Qaeda, the Islamic State, and the al-Nusra Front.

Sherman and other pro-Israel members of Congress have introduced legislation to allow Israel to be part of the visa waiver program. The legislation failed because the Israeli government was unwilling to grant reciprocal visa-free travel for all U.S. citizens.

As a senior member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Sherman has focused on Congressional recognition of the Armenian genocide, as well as increasing funding to Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, which is part of Azerbaijan, but was under the control of the Republic of Artsakh from 1994 until 2023. He called for the imposition of sanctions against Azerbaijan.

Sherman urged the Trump administration to take a tougher line on China by imposing sanctions on Chinese officials who are responsible for human rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim minority in China&#x27;s Xinjiang region. In March 2019, Sherman and other lawmakers wrote Secretary of State Mike Pompeo a letter that read in part, &quot;This issue is bigger than just China. It is about demonstrating to strongmen globally that the world will hold them accountable for their actions.&quot;

====Internet policy====
In 2011, Sherman co-sponsored SOPA, a controversial copyright bill. His 2012 opponent, Howard Berman, was an original co-sponsor of SOPA.

====LGBT====
Sherman strongly supports LGBT rights. He earned a 100% rating from the Human Rights Campaign, the nation&#x27;s largest LGBT rights group, in the 114th, 113th, and 112th Congresses. Sherman is a member of the LGBT Equality Caucus and supports same-sex marriage. He voted for the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act of 2010. Sherman was an original co-sponsor of Representative Jared Polis&#x27;s Student Non-Discrimination Act. Sherman is also a co-sponsor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. In 2009, he voted for the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which imposes additional federal penalties for crimes motivated by hatred on the basis of race, religion, or actual or perceived sexual orientation.

====Abortion====
Sherman is pro-choice. He earned a 100% rating from NARAL and Planned Parenthood in 2009. Sherman opposed the overturning of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, calling it &quot;appalling and outrageous&quot;.

====Gun control====
Sherman has received a 100% rating from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.

====Office environment====
In December 2017, eight former aides to Sherman said that his offices in Washington, D. C., and California had a toxic environment characterized by frequent &quot;verbal abuse from the congressman and senior staff who made them feel bullied and demoralized&quot;. A focus of the criticism was Matt Dababneh, Sherman&#x27;s district director and a close advisor, who began working for Sherman in 2005 and became district director to Sherman in 2009. Dababneh was elected to the California State Assembly in 2013 and resigned from that body after allegations of sexual assault and other misconduct were made against him. Former employees in Sherman&#x27;s office told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that Dababneh frequently made inappropriate sexual remarks, including degrading and sexist comments and bragged about his sexual exploits. No one suggested that Sherman knew of Dababneh&#x27;s conduct but several staffers said the office environment did not encourage reporting and that Sherman would not have been receptive to complaints about a trusted advisor.

Sherman has acknowledged being &quot;a demanding boss&quot; but &quot;denied that his management style contributed to the silence about Dababneh&#x27;s behavior&quot;. Surveys of Capitol Hill staff rated Sherman as one of the worst members of Congress to work for with high staff turnover rates.

In January 2018, Sherman held a town hall meeting in Reseda, where a questioner who supported a Democratic primary challenger to Sherman accused Sherman of having an inadequate sexual harassment policy. Sherman replied: &quot;We have five different ways to report sexual harassment in my office. One among those is to talk to me personally. And I talk to each staff member several times a year about the office policy.&quot; The exchange was cut from a video of the event that Sherman&#x27;s office posted to YouTube; the office said that it excluded from the highlight reel &quot;all questions asked by a questioner working with an opponent&#x27;s campaign if the questioner failed to disclose that fact in their question&quot;.

==== Impeachment ====
On July 12, 2017, Sherman introduced an Article of Impeachment (H. Res. 438) against President Donald Trump for High Crimes and Misdemeanors on the grounds that Trump attempted to obstruct justice by firing James Comey from the FBI. Sherman had only one co-sponsor, Al Green, who first called for Trump&#x27;s impeachment in May 2017.

==== Wildfires ====
Sherman, whose district includes Pacific Palisades, an area heavily impacted by the wildfires that destroyed thousands of homes, engaged in a heated exchange on January 24, 2025, during President Donald Trump&#x27;s meeting with local, state and congressional leaders following the tour of devastation. Sherman informed Trump that many people affected by the fires had their insurance canceled and urged him to support substantial federal funding for rebuilding programs. However, Sherman also criticized Trump&#x27;s earlier comments about tying such funding to requirements like Voter ID. The Palisades Fire started January 7 and burned more than 23,000 acres, killing at least 12 people and destroying more than 6,800 structures.

Sherman expressed his support for relief funding in states like Louisiana and North Dakota, even though he disagrees with some of their political policies. “I would never tell someone in Louisiana to keep living on their cousin’s couch because we won’t help them rebuild until the state aligns with my views on a woman’s right to choose,” Sherman said. “I’m hoping we can secure these funds and avoid punishing individuals for the policies of their state.” Sherman also urged Trump to consider delaying tariffs on construction materials for three years to allow rebuilding efforts to move forward without unnecessary obstacles. Trump responded that he would “take a look” at the proposal.

==== Other ====
Sherman&#x27;s voting record has most often earned him a 100% rating from the AFL–CIO, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), and the American Federation of State, County, &amp; Municipal Employees (AFSCME). Sherman&#x27;s voting record has earned him a 100% rating in 2004 from the Humane Society. In 2017 and 2018, the Animal Welfare Institute gave Sherman a rating of 68%. Sherman&#x27;s legislative record received a 100% rating from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in 2011, a 100% from the National Organization for Women (NOW) in 2007–08, a 100% from the Human Rights Campaign in 2009–10, and a 98% rating from the NAACP in 2009–10. Sherman has earned a 100% rating from the California Teachers Association, the National Education Association, and the American Federation of Teachers.

<doc id="408925" wikidata="Q545221" url="?curid=408925" title="Howard Berman">
<text>Howard Lawrence Berman (born April 15, 1941) is an American attorney and retired politician who served as a U.S. representative from California from 1983 to 2013. A member of the Democratic Party, he represented the state&#x27;s 26th congressional district until redistricting and the 28th congressional district—which both encompassed parts of the San Fernando Valley—for a combined 15 terms.

==Early life, education, and legal career==
Berman was born in Los Angeles, to Jewish parents, the son of Eleanor (née Schapiro) and Joseph Berman. His maternal grandparents immigrated from Russia. He graduated from Alexander Hamilton High School in 1959 and earned his B.A. in international relations in 1962 and his LL.B. in 1965 at the University of California, Los Angeles where he befriended future congressman Henry Waxman. Blanche Bettington, his high school civics teacher, inspired him to enter politics and government.

He was a VISTA volunteer (1966–1967) in Baltimore and San Francisco, and was an associate at a Los Angeles law firm, Levy, Van Bourg &amp; Hackler (1967–72) specializing in labor relations.

==California Assembly==

===Elections===
Berman won election to the Assembly in 1972 from a district in the Hollywood Hills, unseating the incumbent Republican speaker pro tempore. His brother Michael, campaign manager in Henry Waxman&#x27;s 1968 Assembly race, again ran a targeted mail operation.

===Tenure===
In 1974, Berman and Waxman both opposed Willie Brown&#x27;s unsuccessful revolt against Speaker of the California State Assembly Leo McCarthy, who rewarded Berman&#x27;s loyalty by appointing him the youngest majority leader in Assembly history. McCarthy fired Berman when Berman tried to replace him in 1980. Although McCarthy failed to retain the speakership, Berman failed to win it and Brown became speaker. Other members remarked on what a tough politician he was; the Bermans helped arrange a primary defeat for at least one colleague (Jack R. Fenton) who had opposed his bid.

===Committee assignments===
He also served as Chairman of the Assembly Democratic Caucus and on the Policy Research Management Committee of the Assembly.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
==== 1982 ====
After redistricting made the 26th district significantly more Democratic, incumbent Republican Congressman John Harbin Rousselot decided to run in California&#x27;s 30th congressional district in 1982. Berman won the Democratic primary for the open seat with 83% of the vote, and the general election with 60% of the vote.

==== 1984 through 2010 ====
Berman was reelected 14 times, never dropping below 61% of the vote, from 1984 through 2010.

The 2000 census allocated California one new House seat, 53 in all. Berman, &quot;dad of the delegation&quot; on redistricting, made a deal with Republicans Tom Davis and David Dreier to keep 34 safe seats for Democrats, add one new Republican district, and protect nineteen incumbent Republicans. Many California Democrats in the House and California State Senate hired Michael Berman, Howard Berman&#x27;s brother, as a redistricting consultant, for a fee of $20,000 each. When the August 2001 plan was unveiled, Congressman Brad Sherman, a fellow Democrat from California, complained that it undermined the safety of his seat with too many Hispanic voters, saying, &quot;Howard Berman stabbed me in the back.&quot; Berman agreed to redraw the boundary between their districts, giving himself 56% and Sherman 37% Latino population. The redistricting plan survived a court challenge from the MALDEF, which argued that the redistricting diluted Hispanic representation. The Republicans suffered some slippage; they had only 19 members in the delegation to the 110th Congress.

From 2001 to 2006, Berman paid his brother Michael Berman&#x27;s consulting firm Berman &amp; D&#x27;Agostino $195,000 from campaign funds. In the 2002 campaign, Berman &amp; D&#x27;Agostino was paid $75,000 in political consulting fees. In 2005, $50,000 in consulting fees were paid to the company, and Michael Berman himself was paid a further $80,500 in campaign management and consulting fees. In 2006, $70,000 was paid in consulting fees.

==== 2012 ====

Following redistricting, Berman decided to run in the newly redrawn 30th Congressional District, facing fellow Democrat Brad Sherman. Sherman had the advantage because he previously represented over half of the district. About 60% of voters of the new 30th district resided in Sherman&#x27;s former district, while just 20% of voters resided in Berman&#x27;s.

The race, unprecedented in pitting two very similar candidates of the same party against each other in the general election, was called a &quot;slugfest&quot;. Berman received the endorsements from about two-thirds of California&#x27;s Democratic congressional delegation. Among Sherman&#x27;s endorsements were then-Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom of California, then-State Controller John Chiang of California, former President Bill Clinton, and Congressman John Conyers of Michigan.

On June 5, 2012, Sherman ranked first in the seven-candidate open primary, with 42% of the vote. Berman ranked second, with 26% of the vote. The state&#x27;s top-two primary system, implemented in 2010, allows for two candidates of the same party to face-off in the general election. Berman ran as the more conservative Democrat, hoping to divide the Democratic vote and dominate in the independent and conservative vote. However, in the November general election, Sherman defeated Berman, 60.3%–39.7%.

===Political positions===
Berman has been described as &quot;one of the most creative members of the House, and one of the most clear-sighted operators in American politics&quot;. He has been an active legislator on several issues, but has also been described as &quot;not one who gets much publicity&quot;.

Berman was the House sponsor of the 1986 False Claims Act that authorized civil litigation by whistleblowers. It led to recoveries for the United States Government exceeding $1 billion dollars.

Berman has championed protecting American film industry jobs from outsourcing (&quot;runaway production&quot;). He has also voted against amending the constitution to require a balanced budget, against banning the desecration of the American flag, against the Defense of Marriage Act, and against restrictions on abortion.

However, Berman concurs with many on the right on a number of issues, particularly foreign policy and trade. Berman voted in support of the invasion of Iraq in both 1991 and 2003, as well as for the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, positions that have hurt his standing among many liberals in his district. While he generally supports free trade - for instance, voting in favor of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and various trade agreements with specific countries -, he voted against the more recent Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). He opposes withdrawing U.S. support for the World Trade Organization. In that same year, he also voted to phase out many farm subsidy programs put into place by the administration of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt as part of the &quot;New Deal&quot;.

In Congress, Berman led the investigation into the conduct of House members in the Mark Foley page scandal.

In May 2012, Berman co-sponsored a bill with Republican Congressman David Dreier of California to reinstate tax credits given to films produced mainly in the United States. The credits were active from 2008 until 2011, and were aimed at keeping films in Hollywood. Berman stressed that we &quot;must make every effort to keep American productions here in the United States&quot;.

====Copyright law====
Berman is known for his protection of copyright interests, and his alliances with the entertainment industry; he was sometimes referred to as the &quot;representative from Hollywood&quot;. The major industry contributing to his election campaigns has been the entertainment industry. He proposed legislation under which copyright holders would be able to employ technological tools such as file blocking, redirection, spoofs, and decoys—among others—to curb piracy (Peer to Peer Piracy Prevention Act). He has been named as one of the primary politicians involved in the creation of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). In a September 2008 hearing of the House Intellectual Property Subcommittee, Berman criticized the National Institutes of Health&#x27;s policy requiring NIH-sponsored research to be submitted to a database open to the public by saying that &quot;the N in NIH shouldn&#x27;t stand for Napster.&quot;

====Iraq====
According to &quot;LA Weekly&quot;, &quot;Berman played a key and under-appreciated role in securing passage of a resolution that gave President George W. Bush broad authority to use force&quot;. The &quot;National Journal&quot; reports that Berman, &quot;played a critical role in winning passage, by a wide margin, of the Iraq War resolution in October 2002. He strongly supported military action against Iraq, and in September, he organized a group of Democrats who shared his views. Berman&#x27;s discussions led to House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt&#x27;s agreement with the administration on the terms of the resolution—talks that undercut the demands of other senior Democrats, including then House Democratic Whip Nancy Pelosi and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Joe Biden. In June 2006, Berman voted for the Republican resolution to reject a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq.&quot;

====Israel====
Berman is also a supporter of Israel, telling the Jewish newspaper, &quot;The Forward&quot;, after being appointed Chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, &quot;Even before I was a Democrat, I was a Zionist.&quot; He has sponsored the Anti-Boycott Act in the House, which prohibits American individuals and organizations from actively boycotting Israeli goods.

====Immigration====
In 2003, Berman expressed his concerns over the Patriot Act with then-United States Attorney General John Ashcroft, specifically on the method to hold illegal immigrants until they prove they are not terrorists.

In 2000, Berman, along with then-Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon, proposed an amnesty, which would have granted legal status to hundreds of thousands of undocumented farm laborers. In exchange, requirements that growers provide housing to guest workers, and pay them a minimum wage adjusted annually for inflation, would have been relaxed. In 2005, Berman was part of the bi-partisan group in Congress that fought for immigration reform efforts. That path to citizenship was also supported by President George W. Bush and Senator John McCain.

====Investments====

OpenSecrets named 151 members of Congress who had investments (as of year end 2006) in companies that do business with the United States Department of Defense, suggesting that such holdings conflict with their responsibility for U.S. security policy. The most important such companies, ranked by estimated total value of members&#x27; holdings, were Procter &amp; Gamble, General Electric, Pepsi, ExxonMobil, Berkshire Hathaway, IBM, Microsoft, Johnson &amp; Johnson, H. J. Heinz Company, and Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company. OpenSecrets identified the top ten members of Congress, and the report named no other members among the 151, save committee chairmen Senator Joseph Lieberman and Representative Berman. None of the firms listed above ranked among the top ten DOD contractors in 2008, nor in the top twenty for 2009.

====Ethics====
Alan Mollohan, ranking member of the House Ethics Committee, resigned from the committee after he himself became the subject of an ethics complaint. Berman had been its senior Democrat from 1997–2003, and on October 5, 2006, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi re-appointed him to replace Mollohan. Berman served on the subcommittee investigating the House&#x27;s page program in the wake of the Mark Foley scandal. &quot;This is an honor I could have done without.&quot;

The Center for Public Integrity reported in 2006 that members of the House Ethics Committee and their staffs had taken many privately sponsored trips, about 400 trips from 2000 to mid-2005, at a total expense nearly $1 million. Of these, Democrats took about 80% of the trips at about 70% of the cost. Berman and his staff were at the top of the chart, with trips costing more than $245,000. Berman himself had taken 14 trips at the Aspen Institute&#x27;s expense, including two to China with Mrs. Berman. Aspen replied that its events for members were like graduate seminars, and did not push any policy agenda. &quot;Gene Smith, Berman&#x27;s chief of staff, said that the bulk of the congressman&#x27;s foreign travel can be attributed to his being a senior member on the House Committee on International Relations.&quot; Five private groups (Campaign Legal Center, Democracy 21, the League of Women Voters, Public Citizen and U.S. PIRG) jointly sent a letter to the ethics committee urging it to ban or restrict such travel.

<text>David Ross Obey ( ; born October 3, 1938) is an American lobbyist and former politician who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives for from 1969 to 2011. The district includes much of the northwestern portion of the state, including Wausau and Superior. He is a member of the Democratic Party, and served as Chairman of the powerful House Committee on Appropriations from 1994 to 1995 and again from 2007 to 2011. He was the longest-serving member ever of the United States House of Representatives from the state of Wisconsin, until surpassed by Jim Sensenbrenner in 2020.

==Early life and career==
Obey was born in Okmulgee, Oklahoma, the son of Mary Jane (née Chellis) and Orville John Obey. In 1941, his family moved back to his parents&#x27; native Wisconsin, and Obey was raised in Wausau, Wisconsin, where he has lived since. He graduated from Wausau East High School and initially attended the University of Wisconsin branch campus at Wausau to save money before transferring to the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from and did graduate work in Soviet politics at the University of Wisconsin under a National Defense Education Act three-year scholarship. 

During his youth, Obey identified as a Republican, and helped deliver campaign material for Joseph McCarthy during his electoral campaigns. However, he left the party after seeing one of his teachers falsely branded as a communist by supporters of Senator Joseph McCarthy. Obey also had come to identify with the progressive philosophy of Robert M. La Follette and began working for the electoral campaigns of Democrats such as Gaylord Nelson, Robert Kastenmeier, and William Proxmire, becoming affiliated with the Democratic Party sometime in the mid-1950s during his teenage years.

Before serving in Congress, Obey worked as a real estate broker.

== Wisconsin State Assembly ==
He was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1963 and served there until 1969. During his time in the state legislature he rose to the position of Assistant Majority leader for the Democratic caucus. Obey served in that role from 1967 until 1969, when he left the legislature to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

Obey was elected to the House to replace eight-term incumbent Republican Melvin R. Laird, who was appointed Secretary of Defense under President Richard Nixon. Obey, only 30 when he was elected, became the youngest member of Congress upon taking his seat, as well as the first Democrat to represent the district in the 20th century. He was elected to a full term in 1970 and was reelected 18 times. Obey faced his closest race in 1972, during his bid for a second full term, when his district was merged with the neighboring 10th District of Republican Alvin O&#x27;Konski, a 15-term incumbent. However, Obey retained 60 percent of his former territory, and was handily reelected in subsequent contests.

In Congress, Obey chaired the commission to write the House&#x27;s Code of Ethics. Among the reforms he instituted was one requiring members of the House to disclose their personal financial dealings so the public would be made aware of any potential conflicts of interest. Obey served as chairman of the House Appropriations Committee from 2007 to 2011; he briefly chaired this committee from 1994 to 1995 and served as its ranking Democrat from 1995 to 2007. He also chaired its Subcommittee on Labor.

Obey was one of the most liberal members of the House; he considers himself a progressive in the tradition of Robert La Follette. Obey had risen to the position of fifth ranking House Democrat since his party retook control of Congress.

During the 1970s, Obey was the leader of the Democratic Study Group, which was a caucus of liberal Democrats in the House which was intended to &quot;counter&quot; the influence of conservative and southern Democrats.

His &quot;Obey Amendment&quot; has prohibited the export of the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor to American allies such as Japan. The amendment was criticized at the time by the U.S. Department of Labor for

Obey also is remembered for being the congressman who intervened when fellow Democrat Harold Ford, Jr. approached Republican Jean Schmidt on the House floor in 2005. Ford was upset because Schmidt had called Congressman John Murtha a coward for advocating a withdrawal of American forces in Iraq.

Obey holds a critical view of the mainstream American news media, as evidenced by his words on June 13, 2008, upon the sudden death of NBC News Washington Bureau Chief Tim Russert. Obey said of Russert: &quot;Tim Russert&#x27;s death is not just a body blow for NBC News; it is a body blow for the nation and for anyone who cherishes newsmen and women who have remained devoted to reporting hard news in an era increasingly consumed by trivia.&quot; Dave Obey announced an end to his congressional career on May 5, 2010, with press releases being released on May 6.

On June 30, 2010, Obey proposed an amendment to a supplemental war spending bill that would allocate $10 billion to prevent expected teacher layoffs from school districts nationwide. The amendment, which passed the House on July 1, 2010, proposed siphoning off $500 million from the Race to the Top fund as well as $300 million designated for charter schools and teacher incentive pay. In response, the White House released a statement threatening a veto if the bill is passed by the Senate.

On March 21, 2010, Obey swung the same gavel used to pass Medicare in 1965, but this time to pass the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

=== Retirement ===
Obey was expected to run in 2010, having raised a warchest of $1.4 million. However, Obey was facing tough poll numbers in his district, plus his age and the death of close colleague John Murtha and his frustration with the White House convinced him to bow out of the race.

On May 5, 2010, Obey announced that he would not seek reelection to Congress.

=== Political campaigns ===
In 1994, Obey only won reelection by eight points as the Democrats lost control of the House during the Republican Revolution.

Obey was expected to run in 2010, having raised a warchest of $1.4 million. However, Obey was facing tough poll numbers in his district, plus his age and the death of close colleague John Murtha and his frustration with the White House convinced him to bow out of the race.

Upon his retirement, the seat was won by Republican Sean Duffy, who defeated Democratic State Senator Julie Lassa.

== Later career ==
Obey left Congress in January 2011, and was succeeded by Republican Sean Duffy. He began working for Gephardt Government Affairs, a lobbying firm founded by former U.S. House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt, in June 2011.

== Personal life ==
While Obey was still a graduate student, he married Joan Lepinski. The two remained married until Joan&#x27;s death in 2023. Obey and his wife had two children together.

<text>Adam Bennett Schiff (born June 22, 1960) is an American lawyer, author, and politician serving as the junior United States senator from California, a seat he has held since 2024. A member of the Democratic Party, Schiff served 12 terms in the United States House of Representatives from 2001 to 2024 and was a member of the California State Senate from 1996 to 2000.

Schiff graduated from Stanford University and Harvard Law School. As an assistant United States attorney, he successfully prosecuted Soviet spy Richard Miller in 1993. He began running for office the following year. A resident of Burbank, he represented California&#x27;s 27th, 29th, 28th, and 30th districts, all based in Los Angeles County, during his time in the House of Representatives.

Schiff chaired the House Intelligence Committee from 2019 to 2023 before being removed from it by Republican House speaker Kevin McCarthy. He previously served on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Schiff was the lead impeachment manager in the first impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. He had previously served as the joint-lead impeachment manager in two other judicial impeachment trials.

Schiff was elected to the Senate in 2024, defeating fellow Democratic U.S. representatives Katie Porter and Barbara Lee in the primary and Republican Steve Garvey in the general election. He was sworn into the Senate on December 9, 2024.
==Early life and education==
Schiff was born on June 22, 1960, in Framingham, Massachusetts, the son of Edward and Sherrill Ann (née Glovsky) Schiff. He is the great-grandson of Lithuanian Jews who fled antisemitism in Eastern Europe. Schiff moved with his parents to Scottsdale, Arizona, in 1970 and Alamo, California, in 1972. In 1978, he graduated from Monte Vista High School in Danville, California, where he played soccer and was both the class salutatorian and the student his peers voted &quot;most likely to succeed&quot;.

Schiff received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from Stanford University in 1982 and graduated with distinction. He obtained his Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School &quot;cum laude&quot; in 1985. Schiff was a member of the Harvard Law School Forum; his tasks included driving guest speakers (including William J. Brennan Jr.) from the airport to campus and back. He also worked as a student research assistant for Professor Laurence Tribe.

==Law career==
After law school, Schiff spent a year as a law clerk for Judge William Matthew Byrne Jr. of the United States District Court for the Central District of California. From 1987 to 1993, he was an assistant United States attorney in the Office of the United States Attorney for the Central District of California. In that position, Schiff came to public attention when he prosecuted the case against Richard Miller, a former FBI agent who spied for the Soviet Union. The first trial resulted in a hung jury; the second trial resulted in a conviction that was overturned on appeal. Miller was convicted in a third trial.

In May 1994, Schiff was a candidate for the 43rd district seat in the California State Assembly in a special election and lost to Republican nominee James E. Rogan. That November, he was the unsuccessful Democratic nominee for a full term, again losing to Rogan.

==California State Senate==

In 1996, Schiff was elected to represent the 21st district in the California State Senate, defeating Republican assemblywoman Paula Boland, who had moved into the district to run. When his term began, he was the Senate&#x27;s youngest member, at 36. During his four-year term, Schiff chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee and Select Committee on Juvenile Justice, and the state legislature&#x27;s Joint Committee on the Arts.

As a state senator, Schiff authored dozens of measures that were enacted into law. These included Senate Bill 1847, Chapter 1021. Passed in 1998, this legislation continued work on the stalled Blue Line light rail extension to Pasadena by renaming the Blue Line the Gold Line and creating the Foothill Gold Line Construction Authority, which separated the project from the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The construction authority finished the Pasadena line in 2003 and extended it to Azusa in 2016. A third leg was begun, which is intended to extend the line to Pomona by 2025. Schiff&#x27;s work on the project earned him the nickname &quot;Father of the Gold Line&quot;.

During his tenure, Schiff also authored &quot;tough on crime&quot; measures, which did not pass or were vetoed by governors, including a bill to allow minors 14 or older accused of serious crimes to be tried as adults and a bill that would have made it a felony to hire an undocumented immigrant. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, these proposals were in line with the &quot;tough on crime&quot; attitude of other politicians in the late 1990s.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

=== Elections ===

In 2000, Schiff challenged James E. Rogan, the incumbent, in what was then California&#x27;s 27th congressional district. The district had once been a Republican stronghold but had been trending Democratic since the early 1990s. In what was the most expensive House race ever at the time, Schiff unseated Rogan, taking 53% of the vote to Rogan&#x27;s 44%. He became only the second Democrat to represent this district since its creation in 1913.

After the 2000 census, the district was renumbered the 29th and made significantly more Democratic. As a result, Schiff never faced another contest nearly as close as his 2000 bid, and was reelected 11 times. His district became even more Democratic after the 2010 census, when it was renumbered the 28th and pushed into Los Angeles proper. Even before that, none of his Republican challengers had cleared 35% of the vote.

In 2010, Schiff defeated Tea Party–backed Republican John Colbert for a sixth term. In 2012, he defeated Republican Phil Jennerjahn. In 2014, he defeated independent candidate Steve Stokes. In 2016, he defeated Republican candidate Lenore Solis.

In 2018, Schiff initially competed in the primary with Democratic challenger Kim Gruenenfelder. After Gruenenfelder dropped out of the race, Schiff defeated Republican nominee Johnny Nalbandian.

In 2020, Schiff faced a crowded primary, which included Republican attorney Eric Early and Democratic drag queen Maebe A. Girl. He won the primary with a majority of the vote, with Girl and Early in a close race for second. On March 27, Early was finally determined to have advanced to the general election. Schiff easily won the general election.

After the 2020 census, Schiff&#x27;s district was renumbered the 30th and made more Democratic. In January 2022, Schiff announced he would run for reelection in the new 30th district. He defeated Girl with 71% of the vote.

In lieu of running for a 13th term, Schiff ran to succeed Dianne Feinstein in the United States Senate in 2024, and won. In preparation for an appointment to finish the remainder of Feinstein&#x27;s term, he resigned from the House on December 8, 2024.

=== Tenure ===

====2003 invasion of Iraq====
Schiff voted in favor of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In February 2015, discussing how or whether to tailor Bush-era plans from 2001 and 2002 to fight ISIS, he was asked whether he regretted that vote. He said: &quot;Absolutely. Unfortunately, our intelligence was dead wrong on that, on Saddam at that time. The vote set in motion a cascading series of events which have [had] disastrous consequences.&quot;


====Armenian genocide resolution====
Schiff has been a leading voice in Armenian-American issues; he claims that over 70,000 Armenian-Americans reside in his district. He introduced U.S. House Resolution 106, recognizing the Armenian genocide, which the House Foreign Affairs Committee approved on October 11, 2007, but which began to lose support after Turkey&#x27;s prime minister said that approval of the resolution would endanger U.S.–Turkey relations. On March 4, 2010, the House Foreign Affairs Committee again approved the resolution by a 23–22 margin. Immediately, the Turkish government recalled its U.S. ambassador. Schiff said in 2007, &quot;When you think about what we have against us – the president, a foreign policy establishment that has condoned this campaign of denial, the Turkish lobby – against that you have the truth, which is a powerful thing but doesn&#x27;t always win out&quot;. On October 29, 2019, the full House of Representatives passed the resolution by a vote of 405–11. Schiff has an &quot;A+&quot; rating and is endorsed by the Armenian National Committee of America.

====Helicopter noise====
Beginning with Representative Howard Berman before Berman was voted out, Schiff worked on the Helicopter Noise Relief Act, a measure to reduce unwanted helicopter noise across Los Angeles County by authorizing the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to study and regulate it. After reintroducing his legislation, Schiff worked with Senator Dianne Feinstein to push the FAA to act, and together they attached a provision in the 2014 omnibus appropriations package directing the U.S. secretary of transportation and the FAA to address helicopter noise in Los Angeles County. As a result, in 2015 the FAA created a countywide helicopter noise public complaint system, the first step toward regulation.

====Intelligence and surveillance reform====
Schiff has been a prominent supporter of surveillance reform, especially in the wake of Edward Snowden&#x27;s leaks of classified intelligence. In 2007, in response to disclosure of the Terrorist Surveillance Program, Schiff and Representative Jeff Flake offered a successful amendment to clarify that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is the exclusive means for collecting foreign intelligence information within the U.S. Schiff criticized the National Security Agency&#x27;s bulk collection of telephone metadata. In 2014, he introduced the Telephone Metadata Reform Act, which would prohibit the bulk collection of domestic phone records. Schiff also introduced several bills aimed at reforming the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, including a bill to require outside counsel to be appointed to argue for privacy and civil liberties protections in certain cases before the Court.

====Investigation of Benghazi attack====
Nancy Pelosi appointed Schiff to the House Select Committee on Benghazi in 2014 as one of the five Democrats on the committee. He had participated in the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence investigation into the attacks on the Benghazi diplomatic compound, which found that the initial talking points the intelligence community provided were flawed but not intended to deceive, and that diplomatic facilities across the world lacked adequate security. The report&#x27;s findings were unanimous and bipartisan. Before he was appointed to the Benghazi Select Committee, Schiff called the establishment of a select committee to investigate the 2012 attack a &quot;colossal waste of time&quot; and said Democratic leaders should not appoint any members: &quot;I think it&#x27;s just a tremendous red herring and a waste of taxpayer resources&quot;. Despite those reservations, he accepted an appointment to the Committee because if he felt he &quot;could add value, [he] would serve&quot;.

====Press freedom====
In 2006, Schiff formed the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Caucus for the Freedom of the Press, aimed at advancing press freedom around the world. The Caucus proposed the Daniel Pearl Freedom of the Press Act, originally introduced to Congress by Schiff, Representative Mike Pence, and Senator Christopher Dodd on October 1, 2009, in response to the murder of Daniel Pearl by terrorists in Pakistan. The legislation requires the United States Department of State to expand its scrutiny of news media intimidation and freedom of the press restrictions during its annual report on human rights in each country. The act passed the House by a vote of 403 to 12 and unanimously in the Senate, but the Senate removed a provision requiring the secretary of state (in coordination with the Department of State&#x27;s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, and in consultation with the Undersecretary for Public Affairs and Public Diplomacy) to establish a grant program aiming to promote freedom of the press worldwide. On May 17, 2010, President Barack Obama, accompanied by the Pearl family, signed the act into law.

====Saudi Arabian–led intervention in Yemen====
In 2015, Schiff supported the Saudi Arabian–led intervention in Yemen, saying: &quot;The military action by Saudi Arabia and its partners was necessitated by the illegal action of the Houthi rebels and their Iranian backers. ... But ultimately, a negotiated end to this crisis is the only way to restore order in Yemen and shrink the space for terrorism&quot;.

In April 2019, Schiff voted for a bipartisan resolution under the War Powers Act to end U.S. involvement in the war. It passed the Senate, but after passing the House it was vetoed.

====War authorization reform and authorization against ISIS====
After Obama&#x27;s speech at the National Defense University examining the U.S. war powers during the War on Terror, Schiff introduced bipartisan legislation to repeal the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists because he felt that &quot;the current AUMF is outdated and straining at the edges to justify the use of force outside the war theater&quot;. The bill, introduced with Representative Tom Rooney, was intended to sunset. Schiff has also been a forceful proponent of debating and voting on a new war authorization against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

Schiff has been a supporter of national defense spending, voting for every increase in the defense budget during his career.

====Comments on Trump–Russia collusion investigation====
In a March 22, 2017, interview with Chuck Todd, Schiff said there was &quot;more than circumstantial evidence now&quot; that Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Russia. Todd asked whether he had seen direct evidence of collusion and Schiff responded that there was &quot;evidence that is not circumstantial and is very much worthy of investigation&quot;.

On April 2, 2017, Schiff, the ranking member on the House Select Intelligence Committee, which is tasked with conducting inquiries related to Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, appeared on CNN&#x27;s &quot;State of the Union&quot;. In a wide-ranging interview, Schiff and host Jake Tapper discussed Michael Flynn&#x27;s request for immunity, Schiff&#x27;s and Devin Nunes&#x27;s separate inspections of White House documents, Trump&#x27;s allegations of wiretapping in Trump Tower, and Nunes&#x27;s apparent close association with the Trump White House. Tapper asked Schiff whether there was evidence that Trump colluded with Russia. Schiff replied: &quot;I don&#x27;t think we can say anything definitively at this point. We are still at the very early stage of the investigation. The only thing I can say is that it would be irresponsible for us not to get to the bottom of this&quot;. Tapper asked, &quot;Do you think that Chairman Nunes was part of an attempt to provide some sort of cover for the president&#x27;s claim about Obama wiretapping him at Trump Tower, which, obviously, this does not prove, but to cover for that, or an attempt to distract, as you&#x27;re suggesting?&quot; Schiff replied, &quot;It certainly is an attempt to distract and to hide the origin of the materials, to hide the White House hand. The question is, of course, why? And I think the answer to the question is this effort to point the Congress in other directions, basically say, don&#x27;t look at me, don&#x27;t look at Russia, there is nothing to see here&quot;. A few days later, Nunes recused himself as leader of the investigative panel while the House Committee on Ethics investigated whether he had disclosed classified information.

On July 23, 2017, on &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, Schiff said: &quot;at the end of the day we need to make sure that our president is operating not in his personal best interests and not because he&#x27;s worried about what the Russians might have but because what he is doing is in America&#x27;s best interest. The fact that we have questions about this is in itself harmful&quot;. The next morning on Twitter, Trump called Schiff &quot;Sleazy Adam Schiff, the totally biased Congressman looking into &#x27;Russia and called the Russian collusion investigation &quot;the Dem loss excuse&quot;. Schiff responded on Twitter that the president&#x27;s &quot;comments and actions are beneath the dignity of the office&quot;.

In December 2018, Schiff suggested that Trump associate Roger Stone might have lied to Congress, and said the transcript of his testimony should be forwarded to the Special Counsel. In November 2019, Stone was convicted of lying to Congress.

When he became chair of the House Intelligence Committee in 2019, Schiff embarked on a personal mission to investigate Trump&#x27;s connections to Russia, separate from the Special Counsel investigation. He came under fire when he demurred when asked if he would accept it if the Special Counsel&#x27;s investigation concluded that Trump had not colluded with Russia, saying that he had great confidence in Mueller but that &quot;there may be, for example, evidence of collusion or conspiracy that is clear and convincing, but not proof beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;, as is needed for a criminal conviction.

On March 28, 2019, the nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee officially called for Schiff to resign due to his allegations that Trump&#x27;s campaign colluded with Russians in the 2016 election. Schiff responded by accusing the Republican members of tolerating &quot;immoral&quot; and &quot;corrupt&quot; conduct by Trump campaign members and administration appointees.

===== Censure =====
On June 21, 2023, the House of Representatives censured Schiff in a party-line vote on H.Res. 521, which investigated his role as Chairman of the Intelligence Committee in promoting the &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; that Trump colluded with Russia in the 2016 United States presidential election. The resolution established that Schiff misled the American public with &quot;falsehoods, misrepresentations and abuses of sensitive information&quot; about the election and as part of the first impeachment of Donald Trump. Schiff has denied the allegations, calling them &quot;defamatory&quot;.

====North Korea====
Schiff called North Korea &quot;one of the most brutal and despotic regimes in the world&quot;. After the death of American student Otto Warmbier, who was imprisoned during a visit to North Korea, Schiff said, &quot;The barbaric treatment of Otto Warmbier by the North Korean regime amounts to the murder of a U.S. citizen&quot;.

In April 2018, when asked whether he thought Trump deserved at least partial credit for North Korea&#x27;s involvement in talks with the U.S., Schiff replied: &quot;I think it&#x27;s more than fair to say that the combination of the president&#x27;s unpredictability and indeed his bellicosity had something to do with the North Koreans deciding to come to the negotiating table&quot;.

====Israel and antisemitism ====

Schiff is a supporter of Israel. In December 2016, he urged Obama to veto UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law.

In February 2019, Representative Ilhan Omar tweeted, &quot;It&#x27;s all about the Benjamins baby&quot; in reference to American politicians&#x27; support for Israel and invoked the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). The tweet received widespread bipartisan condemnation, including from Schiff, for implying that lobby money was fueling American politicians&#x27; support of Israel. Schiff said it was &quot;never acceptable to give voice to, or repeat, anti-Semitic smears&quot;.

In October 2023, Schiff condemned Hamas&#x27;s actions during the Israel–Hamas war and expressed his support for Israel and its right to self-defense. He rejected calls for a ceasefire but said he supported &quot;humanitarian pauses&quot; to deliver aid to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.

The AIPAC-affiliated Super PAC, United Democracy Project, gave $5 million to the pro-Schiff superpac Standing Strong during Schiff&#x27;s 2024 Senate primary campaign, as confirmed by its spokesman, Patrick Dorton. Democratic Majority for Israel&#x27;s political arm, DMFI PAC, also endorsed Schiff during this campaign.

====Murder of Jamal Khashoggi====
After news reports that the CIA concluded that Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman had ordered the assassination of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Trump said there was insufficient CIA evidence to link bin Salman to the murder. As the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Schiff was briefed by the CIA on the agency assessment, and said afterward that Trump was being dishonest about the CIA findings.

====Impeachments====
In 2009, Schiff was appointed and served as an impeachment manager (prosecutor) in the impeachment trial of Judge Samuel B. Kent. He was the lead manager alongside Bob Goodlatte. The next year, Schiff was appointed and served as an impeachment manager in the impeachment trial of Judge Thomas Porteous. He was again the lead manager alongside Goodlatte.

As chair of the Intelligence Committee, Schiff was one of the lead investigators in the impeachment inquiry against Trump stemming from the Trump–Ukraine scandal. Trump was impeached along party lines by 228 votes to 193 in the House on December 18, 2019, making him the third president to be impeached.

On January 15, 2020, House speaker Nancy Pelosi named Schiff a lead impeachment manager. In this role, he led a team of seven House members responsible for presenting the impeachment case against Trump during his Senate trial.

==== Armenia–Azerbaijan War ====

Schiff accused Turkey of inciting the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. He said the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war &quot;must cause us [to] reexamine our relationship with both Turkey and Azerbaijan. If an ally of the United States is recruiting fighters from Syria to encourage further bloodshed and murder of civilians, what kind of ally are they in NATO or otherwise?&quot;. Schiff co-signed a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stating: &quot;We write to express our deep concern with Azerbaijan&#x27;s renewed aggression against Artsakh (Nagorno Karabakh) and the rising possibility of a wider conflict with Armenia. We ask that the Administration use all available diplomatic tools to reduce tensions, end the fighting, and restrain Azerbaijan from further offensive actions.&quot; Schiff called for U.S. recognition of the Republic of Artsakh, which was an autonomous oblast within the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic but has been under control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since the end of a separatist war in 1994. He reiterated that call in April 2023. 

==== Investigation into the January 6 attack on the Capitol ====

On July 1, 2021, Pelosi appointed nine members (seven Democrats and two Republicans) to the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United States Capitol, which included Schiff.

On June 21, 2022, Schiff led Day 4 of the committee&#x27;s public hearings, which included testimony from three Republican officials to whom Trump reached out after the election: Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, his deputy Gabe Sterling, and Arizona House of Representatives speaker Rusty Bowers. The second half of the hearing focused on Trump supporters&#x27; harassment of and threats to Georgia poll worker Wandrea&#x27; ArShaye Moss and her family, which led her to quit her job and go into hiding. 
Schiff was interviewed after the hearing by reporters and called the testimony &quot;enormously powerful&quot;. He added, &quot;The lie lives on, and with it so does the danger.&quot;

==== Ban on stock trading ====
Schiff supports a ban on stock trading by members of Congress.

== California attorney general appointment speculation==
In early December 2020, President-elect Joe Biden announced he would nominate Attorney General of California Xavier Becerra for Secretary of Health and Human Services. &quot;Axios&quot; reported in February 2021 that Schiff was lobbying Governor Gavin Newsom and his allies to appoint him as Attorney General, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s approval.

In response to Schiff&#x27;s lobbying for the attorney general&#x27;s post, 36 criminal and social justice groups, notably the Black Lives Matter Los Angeles and Long Beach chapters, wrote an open letter to Newsom expressing &quot;strong opposition&quot;, citing his past support for &quot;tough on crime&quot; measures, though they also specified that their letter was not an endorsement of any other candidate. On March 24, 2021, Newsom announced he would appoint California state assemblyman Rob Bonta, who took office on April 23.

==U.S. Senate==
===Elections===
==== 2024====

On January 26, 2023, Schiff declared his candidacy for the United States Senate in the 2024 election. On February 2, his candidacy received a significant boost with an endorsement from former house speaker Nancy Pelosi. This endorsement came after the incumbent, Dianne Feinstein, announced she would not seek reelection.

In the ensuing primary, Schiff faced Representatives Katie Porter and Barbara Lee. During the primary, he spent $10 million elevating his Republican opponent Steve Garvey in order to squeeze Porter and Lee out of second place, as Californian primary process advances the two most preferred candidates, regardless of party, to the general election.

On March 5, 2024, Schiff advanced to the general election, where he faced Garvey, a former professional baseball player. Schiff was widely expected to win the race.

On July 17, in an exclusive interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Schiff publicly called for President Joe Biden to end his bid for reelection, becoming one of the most prominent Democrats in Congress to do so.

On November 5, Schiff won both the election to complete Feinstein&#x27;s remaining term and the election for the Senate term beginning on January 3, 2025.

Schiff was sworn in on December 9, 2024, as a junior U.S. senator in the 118th United States Congress.

Schiff and his family live in Burbank. Schiff has participated in multiple endurance challenges, including triathlons and marathons. He was the only U.S. representative to participate in the inaugural Washington, D.C., triathlon in 2010 and has since participated in races in Philadelphia, New York City, and Malibu. In 2014, Schiff was the first member of Congress to participate in the AIDS/LifeCycle, a seven-day charity bike ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles to raise awareness and funding to fight HIV and AIDS.

<text>The New National Party (NNP), also known as NNP Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique, is a conservative political party in Grenada. It is led by Emmalin Pierre.

The party was founded in August 1984 through the merger of the Grenada National Party, led by Herbert Blaize, the National Democratic Party, led by George Brizan, and the Grenada Democratic Movement (GDM), led by Francis Alexis. Led by Blaize, the NNP won 14 out of 15 seats in the December 1984 general election, and Blaize became prime minister. Mitchell was elected as leader of the NNP in January 1989, defeating Prime Minister Herbert Blaize. In the 1990 general election, the NNP won two seats and was left in opposition.

The party was victorious in the 1995 general election, winning eight out of 15 seats in the House of Representatives, and Mitchell became prime minister. After the NNP lost its majority due to the resignation of Raphael Fletcher, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, in November 1998, an early election was called for January 1999, the New National Party (NNP) won all seats. The NNP narrowly won a third term in power in the November 2003 election, reduced to a one-seat parliamentary majority.

In the general election held on 27 November 2003, the party won 48.0% of the popular vote and 8 out of 15 seats. In the July 2008 general election, the party lost to the National Democratic Congress (NDC), winning four seats against 11 for the NDC. NDC leader Tillman Thomas succeeded Mitchell as Prime Minister of Grenada.

In the 2013 general election, the New National Party returned to power, after winning all 15 seats. This was the second time a political party won all constituencies in a general election. At the 2018 General Election, the New National Party was able to retain all 15 seats. In November 2021, Prime Minister Keith Mitchell said that the upcoming general elections which are constitutionally due no later than June 2023, will be the last one for him. Early elections were held in June 2022 and Mitchell ultimately led the party to defeat.

The New National Party (NNP) convention held on Sunday, December 15, elected the party&#x27;s first female political leader. Emmalin Pierre served as a public relations professional before being elected to political leader. Norland Cox is the newly elected deputy political leader.

<text>Thomas Evert Petri (born May 28, 1940) is an American politician who was the U.S. representative for from 1979 to 2015; he is a member of the Republican Party.

== Early life ==
Petri was born in Marinette, Wisconsin. When he was a toddler, his father, a Navy flyer and lieutenant during World War II, was lost during a mission over the Atlantic. Petri, his infant brother, and his widowed mother moved to Fond du Lac, where Petri&#x27;s mother taught in the Fond du Lac public schools. He represented his high school as a delegate to the youth government and leadership program Badger Boys State in 1957.

He graduated from Goodrich High School in Fond du Lac. Petri then attended Harvard University, where he received his Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws degrees. After graduating from law school he served as a law clerk to federal district judge James Doyle.

He was one of the founders of the Ripon Society, a public policy organization aligned with the Republican Party.

He served as a volunteer with the Peace Corps in Somalia from 1966 to 1967. From 1969 to 1970 he served as a White House aide during the Presidency of Richard Nixon.

==Early political career==

===Wisconsin Senate===
Petri served in the Wisconsin State Senate from 1973 to 1979.

===1974 U.S. Senate election===

Petri ran for the U.S. Senate in 1974. He easily won the Republican primary with 85% of the vote. During the campaign, Petri walked across the state of Wisconsin as part of his grassroots strategy. In the general election, incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Gaylord Nelson defeated Petri 62%–36%. Petri took five of 72 counties in the state.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1979, he won a special election to finish the term of the late U.S. Congressman William A. Steiger, who had died shortly after being re-elected in 1978. He defeated fellow state senator Gary Goyke by only 1,200 voters. He won the seat in his own right in 1980, taking 57 percent of the vote in a rematch with Goyke.

Petri was reelected 16 times. The only time he faced a race anywhere near as close as his 1979 contest came in 1992. That year, he defeated State Representative Peg Lautenschlager 53% to 47%. It would be the only reelection contest in which he won less than 65 percent of the vote. He won ten of the district&#x27;s thirteen counties. He lost Manitowoc, Brown, and Outagamie counties. He ran unopposed in 1990, 1994, 2002, and 2006. He faced no major-party opposition in 1986 and 1998. In April 2014, Petri announced he would not seek re-election in November 2014.

===Tenure===
Petri was a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership and supports stem-cell research, although he generally opposes abortion. He called for a moratorium on the death penalty, but voted against other restrictions on it. Petri was a member of the moderate Tuesday Group conference of Republicans, and received $10,000 from the group in 2008 and $5,000 in 2012.

Petri was the author and sponsor of three surface transportation laws. He supported the laws that eliminated the 55-miles-per-hour speed limit and eliminated the Interstate Commerce Commission.

Petri&#x27;s three largest contributors in the 2012 campaign cycle were labor unions. He voted for Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) and twice voted to allow the use of PLAs in government contracts. Petri also voted to permit the use of taxpayer funds to comply with the Davis-Bacon Act, voted to use federal funds for collective bargaining by the Transportation Security Administration, and voted in favor of $233 million in taxpayer funding for the National Labor Relations Board.

In 1994, Petri introduced H.R. 4469, &quot;The Multicare Act of 1994&quot;. This bill would have established federally funded government-run health insurance programs, and would have authorized states to require an individual to purchase insurance from one of these government-run insurance plans. Petri continued to push for the passage of Multicare until 2004.

In 2005, Petri voted to fund the &quot;Gravina Island Bridge&quot;, and voted to prevent the drilling for oil in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

In 2005, Petri introduced the Direct Loan Reward Act, and in 2006 introduced the Student Aid Reward (STAR) Act.

On November 2, 2005, Petri voted against the Online Freedom of Speech Act.

On January 18, 2007 Petri voted in favor of HR 6, which made it more difficult to obtain a lease to drill for oil domestically.

Petri endorsed Mitt Romney in the 2008 GOP presidential primary. He subsequently endorsed John McCain in the 2008 presidential election.

In 2011, Petri sponsored an amendment to allow Michigan-based Badger Ferry to continue operating on Lake Michigan dumping more than 500 tons of coal ash a year into the lake. He had received $14,751 in campaign donations from executives of Lake Michigan Carferry, the owner of Badger Ferry. The Environmental Protection Agency and Badger Ferry came to agreement in 2013 to modifying coal-dumping procedures within two years. Badger Ferry, the oldest continuously operating coal ferry in the United States, announced in 2015 that is would continue operating without dumping coal in Lake Michigan.

On August 1, 2011, Petri voted for the Budget Control Act of 2011, which raised the nation&#x27;s debt limit and created the United States Congress Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction.

Petri headed the Congressional British-American Parliamentary Exchange Group, which coordinated annual meetings between members of Congress and Parliament.

In the 112th Congress and the 113th Congress, Petri introduced the ExCEL Act, which would have created a universal income-contingent student loan repayment process, where students repaid loans based on their after college earnings. Petri&#x27;s bill received bipartisan and bicameral support.

In 2012, Petri introduced H.R. 4148, the Fox-Wisconsin Heritage Parkway National Heritage Area Act of 2012, which would place 1,444 square miles of land in Wisconsin under the control of the federal government.

In 2014, Petri was investigated for advocating for a constituent company, Oshkosh Corporation, in which he held stock. He was also under scrutiny in regard to another Wisconsin-based business, The Manitowoc Company, in which he had a financial interest. Although the Office of Congressional Ethics found reason to believe Petri violated House rules and standards, the House Ethics Committee disagreed, voting not to impose sanctions on him.

<text>Grigori Chkhartishvili (; ), better known by his pen name Boris Akunin (, born 20 May 1956), is a Georgian-Russian writer residing in the United Kingdom. He is best known as a writer of historical fiction, specifically his Erast Fandorin detective novels. He is also an essayist and literary translator. Grigory Chkhartishvili has also written under pen names Anatoly Brusnikin, Anna Borisova, and Akunin-Chkhartishvili. His characters include Erast Fandorin, Nicholas Fandorin and Sister Pelagia.

==Early life ==
Chkhartishvili was born on 20 May 1956 in Zestaponi to a Georgian father and a Jewish mother. He moved to Moscow in 1958.

== Career ==

Chkhartishvili worked as assistant to the editor-in-chief of the magazine &quot;Foreign Literature&quot;, but left in October 2000 to pursue a career as a fiction writer.

Influenced by Japanese kabuki theatre, he joined the historical-philological branch of the Institute of Asian and African Countries of Moscow State University as an expert on Japan. He was engaged in literary translation from Japanese and English. Japanese authors Yukio Mishima, Kenji Maruyama, Yasushi Inoue, Masahiko Shimada, Kobo Abe, Shinichi Hoshi, Takeshi Kaiko, Shohei Ooka were published in his translation, as well as representatives of American and English literature (T. C. Boyle, Malcolm Bradbury, Peter Ustinov, etc.).

Under his given name of Grigory Chkhartishvili, he was editor-in-chief of the 20-volume &quot;Anthology of Japanese Literature&quot;, chairman of the board of a large &quot;Pushkin Library”, and is the author of the book &quot;The Writer and Suicide&quot; (Moscow, The New Literary Review, 1999). He has also contributed literary criticism and translations from Japanese, American, and English literature under his own name.

He publishes other critical and documentary works under his real name.

Since 1998 he has been writing fiction under the pseudonym “B. Akunin&quot;, decoding &quot;B&quot; as &quot;Boris&quot;. &quot;Akunin&quot; (悪人) is a Japanese word that translates to &quot;great bad man&quot;. In his novel &quot;The Diamond Chariot&quot;, the author redefines an &quot;akunin&quot; as a great evil man who creates his own rules.

Under the pseudonym &quot;Boris Akunin&quot;, he has written many works of fiction, mainly novels and stories in the series &quot;The Adventures of Erast Fandorin&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Sister Pelagia&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of the Master&quot; (following Nicholas Fandorin, Erast&#x27;s grandson), all published in Russia by Zakharov Books, and the &quot;Roman-Kino&quot; (&quot;Novel-Film&quot;) series set during World War I. Akunin&#x27;s specialty is historical mysteries set in Imperial Russia. It was only after the first books of the Fandorin series were published to critical acclaim that the identity of &quot;B. Akunin&quot; (i.e., Chkhartishvili) was revealed.

Akunin lived in Moscow until 2014. He has since lived in Britain, France, and Spain. he is living in London.

==Recognition ==
Chkhartishvili has been called by Igor Pomerantsev the &quot;undisputed champion&quot; of Russian crime fiction, given that as Boris Akunin he &quot;has written more than a dozen crime novels and has been widely appreciated by discerning readers ... and has been translated into many languages.&quot;

==Political views==

Akunin has been critical of Vladimir Putin&#x27;s domestic and foreign policies since the invasion of Georgia and the annexation of Crimea. 

Akunin participated in a fundraiser in 2022 to benefit Russians accused of &quot;discrediting&quot; the Russian army under the Russian 2022 war censorship laws.

In December 2023, the pranksters Vovan and Lexus called Akunin and Dmitry Bykov, pretending to be representatives of the Ukrainian Government, and released the recordings of Akunin and Bykov expressing their support for Ukraine. The response in Russia was negative: many Russian publishing booksellers, including publishing company AST, ceased publication and distribution of Akunin&#x27;s and Bykov&#x27;s works. One of the few booksellers that continued to distribute Akunin&#x27;s books, Zakharov Books, came under investigation by the Investigative Committee of Russia. Russian politician Andrey Gurulyov called Akunin an &quot;enemy&quot; that &quot;must be destroyed&quot;.

Akunin was then added by Rosfinmonitoring to its list of terrorists and extremists, with Akunin specifically believed to be complicit in terrorist activity by the Russian Government. The government also opened a criminal case against Akunin, with allegations of discreditation of the Russian army. In response, Akunin wrote on Facebook: &quot;Terrorists declared me a terrorist.&quot; In an article on his website, Akunin has warned Russians abroad to not return to Russia.

In January 2024, Akunin was designated a &quot;foreign agent&quot; by the Russian Ministry of Justice. This designation requires that the subject identify themselves as a &quot;foreign agent&quot; on social media and any other publications, and imposes heavy financial reporting requirements. Later that month, Russia&#x27;s Interior Ministry put his name on a wanted list for alleged criminal activity.

On 6 February 2024, a Moscow court ordered the arrest of Akunin in absentia. After the death of Alexei Navalny, Akunin said that &quot;There is nothing more the dictator [Putin] can do to Navalny. Navalny is dead and has become immortal.&quot;

In June 2024, the online library of Boris Akunin was blocked in Russia due to the library&#x27;s distribution of Vladimir Sorokin&#x27;s book &quot;The Heritage&quot; ().

==Awards and honors==
In the year 2000, Akunin was nominated for the Smirnoff-Booker Prize. In September 2000, Akunin was named &quot;Russian Writer of the Year&quot; and won the &quot;Antibooker&quot; prize 2000 for his Erast Fandorin novel &quot;Coronation, or the last of the Romanovs&quot;.

In 2003, the British Crime Writers&#x27; Association placed Akunin&#x27;s novel &quot;The Winter Queen&quot; on the short list for the Dagger Award in Fiction. In 2004, he was a member of the jury at the 26th Moscow International Film Festival.

On 10 August 2009, for the contribution to the development of cultural ties between Russia and Japan, he was awarded the prize of the Japan Foundation acting under the auspices of the government.

Laureate of the Noma Prize (2007, Kodansha Publishing House, Japan) - &quot;For the best translation from Japanese of works of the writer Yukio Mishima&quot;.

==Adaptations==
Two Fandorin novels, &quot;The Turkish Gambit&quot; and &quot;The State Counsellor&quot;, were made into big-budget Russian movies. &quot;Azazel&quot; was adapted twice for television, first as &quot;The Winter Queen&quot;, and later as &quot;Fandorin. Azazel&quot;, produced by Yandex Studios and Kinopoisk streaming service.

An English remake of &quot;The Winter Queen&quot; was in production. It was set to start filming in 2007, but the leading actress, Milla Jovovich, became pregnant, and the production process was delayed to unknown date.

&quot;Pelagia and the White Bulldog&quot; was made into a TV mini-series in 2009, while &quot;The Spy Novel&quot; came out in a 2012 theatrical release as &quot;Spy&quot;.

*As Boris Akunin-Chkhartishvili:
#&quot;Aristonomia&quot; / Аристономия (2012). Akunin&#x27;s first attempt to write &quot;serious literature&quot;, as opposed to genre fiction.

===Anatoly Brusnikin===
In November 2007, AST, one of the publishing houses with which Akunin is affiliated, came out with a historical mystery novel by a new author, Anatoly Brusnikin, called Девятный спас (&quot;Devyatny Spas&quot;, The Ninth Savior). Despite the fact that Brusnikin was a complete unknown, AST spent lavishly on an advertising campaign for the book, which almost immediately resulted in rumors that Brusnikin might actually be Akunin in a new disguise.

The rumors about the authorship of &quot;Devyatny Spas&quot; were also fueled by the total secrecy surrounding the person of the author and the fact that his name, A. O. Brusnikin, is an exact anagram of Boris Akunin. AST has also released a photograph of Brusnikin, which greatly resembled Chkhartishvili&#x27;s face.

In January 2012, two years after the second Brusnikin novel was published and just prior to the release of the third one, Chkhartishvili admitted in his blog that it was indeed him hiding under a new nom-de-plume. The reason for creating another alter ego was Akunin&#x27;s desire to write historical novels without a mystery component and to attempt a &quot;Slavophile&quot; look at Russian history in lieu of his usual &quot;Westerner&quot; outlook. The Brusnikin &quot;photograph&quot; was revealed to be a combination of Chkhartishvili&#x27;s face with the face of a studio designer who made the picture.

To date, three Brusnikin novels have been written.

#&quot;The Ninth Savior&quot; / Девятный Спас (2007). Set in the beginning of Peter the Great&#x27;s reign, it follows the lives of three friends (clearly modeled after the Three Bogatyrs of the Russian folk tales) and a scion of the Romanovs named Vasilisa (modeled after Vasilisa the Wise) and their involvement in a series of sinister plots.
#&quot;A Hero of A Different Time&quot; / Герой иного времени (2010). An homage to Lermontov&#x27;s A Hero of Our Times, it is set during the Caucasus War in the early 1840s.
#&quot;Bellona&quot; / Беллона (2012). The Crimean War is the main subject.

Akunin has said he has no definite plans to write more Brusnikin novels, though he remains open to the possibility.

===Anna Borisova===
At about the same time as Brusnikin had made his appearance, Chkhartishvili&#x27;s other disguise, Anna Borisova, hit the bookstores relatively undetected. In this literary experiment Chkhartishvili wanted to attempt to write as a woman and to get away from detective and adventure fiction. Similar to the Brusnikin ruse, the &quot;photograph&quot; of Borisova released by the publisher was actually a combination of Chkhartishvili&#x27;s face with that of his wife.
Borisova&#x27;s work, though not overly complicated, is more literary and philosophical in nature. There were three Borisova novels written.

#&quot;There...&quot; / Там ... (2007). Victims of a terrorist attack in Moscow experience afterlife, each in accordance with their very different beliefs.
#&quot;The Idea-Man&quot; / Креативщик (2009). A mysterious stranger walks the streets of Saint Petersburg, telling people strange and fascinating stories.
#&quot;Vremena goda&quot; (2011). Set in a French retirement home for Russian-speaking clientele. The main characters are a young Muscovite doctor suffering from a potentially fatal brain aneurism and a supercentenarian owner of the home incapacitated by the locked-in syndrome.

Akunin has said that he will not write any more Borisova novels &quot;unless I get a sex-change (surgery).&quot;

<doc id="408945" wikidata="Q1539301" url="?curid=408945" title="Jamaica Labour Party">
<text>The Jamaica Labour Party (JLP; ) is one of the two major political parties in Jamaica, the other being the People&#x27;s National Party (PNP). While its name might suggest that it is a social democratic party (as is the case for &quot;Labour&quot; parties in several other Commonwealth realms such as Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom), the JLP is actually a conservative party, besides that it embraced Fabianism.

It is the current governing party, having won 49 of the 63 parliamentary seats in the lower house of parliament (House of Representatives) in the 2020 general elections.

The JLP uses a bell, the victory sign, and the colour green as electoral symbols. The JLP is a member of the Caribbean Democrat Union.

== The JLP in colonial Jamaica ==

The party was founded on 8 July 1943 by Alexander Bustamante as the political wing of the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union. Bustamante had previously been a member of the PNP.

It won the 1944 general elections with 22 of the 32 seats. It went on to win the 1949 elections with a reduced majority. The PNP received more votes (203,048) than the JLP (199,538), but the JLP secured more seats, 17 to the PNP&#x27;s 13. Two seats were won by independents. The voter turnout was 65.2%.

The JLP lost power to the PNP in the 1955 elections. The PNP won for the first time, securing 18 out of 32 seats. The JLP ended up with 14 seats, and there were no independents. The voter turnout was 65.1%. As a result, Norman Manley became the new chief minister.

The JLP remained in opposition following the 1959 Jamaican general election, when the number of seats was increased to 45. The PNP secured a wider margin of victory, taking 29 seats to the JLP&#x27;s 16.

Manley was appointed Jamaica&#x27;s first premier on 14 August 1959.

In the 1961 Federation membership referendum Jamaica voted 54% to leave the West Indies Federation. After losing the referendum, Manley took Jamaica to the polls in April 1962, to secure a mandate for the island&#x27;s independence. On 10 April 1962, of the 45 seats up for contention in the 1962 Jamaican general election, the JLP won 26 seats and the PNP 19. The voter turnout was 72.9%.

This resulted in the independence of Jamaica on 6 August 1962, and several other British colonies in the West Indies followed suit in the next decade. Bustamante had replaced Manley as premier between April and August, and on independence, he became Jamaica&#x27;s first prime minister.

==The JLP in independent Jamaica==

Bustamante suffered a stroke in 1964 and largely withdrew from politics. However, he did not relinquish the title of party leader for another decade. Donald Sangster took over as acting prime minister after Bustamante&#x27;s stroke. He was named First Deputy Leader in 1967, and led the party to victory in the 21 February 1967 Jamaican general election. The JLP won 33 out of 53 seats, with the PNP taking 20 seats.

Sangster suffered a brain hemorrhage and died about six weeks after the elections, while he was preparing for his budget presentation.

Hugh Shearer succeeded Sangster as first deputy leader and prime minister, defeating David Clement (DC) Tavares by two votes in a run-off by of the JLP parliamentarians. Tavares had come out on top in the first ballot, with Shearer and Robert Lightbourne being the other candidates. Under Shearer, the JLP lost power in independent Jamaica for the first time to the People&#x27;s National Party and Michael Manley in 1972. The PNP won 37 seats to the JLP&#x27;s 16.

Shearer served as opposition leader until 1974. Bustamante finally gave up the post of party leader in 1974, and Edward Seaga was elected his successor. The party lost the 1976 elections, the PNP winning 47 seats to the JLP&#x27;s 13. The turnout was a very high 85 percent.

Seaga became prime minister after victory in 1980 when the party won by a landslide, capturing 51 of the then 60 parliamentary seats.

In 1983 with the JLP achieving a spike in popularity, in part because of Seaga&#x27;s support of the US-led military invasion of Grenada, Seaga called early elections and won all sixty seats, the majority by acclamation, mainly because the opposition PNP boycotted those elections. The JLP suffered defeat in the 1989 elections. The PNP won 45 seats to the JLP&#x27;s 15.

The JLP went on to lose elections in 1993, 1997 and 2002, all under the continued leadership of Seaga. In 1993, the PNP, led by P.J. Patterson, won 52 seats to the JLP&#x27;s eight seats, while in 1997 the PNP won 50 of the 60 seats available. In the 2002 Jamaican general election, the PNP retained power with a reduced seat majority of 34 seats to 26. Patterson stepped down on 26 February 2006, and was replaced by Portia Simpson-Miller, Jamaica&#x27;s first female prime minister.

In 2005 Bruce Golding succeeded Seaga as leader of the party, and led it to victory in the 2007 elections by a narrow margin of 32 seats to 28, with a turnout of 61.46%. This election ended 18 years of PNP rule, and Bruce Golding became the new prime minister.

Golding resigned as head of the party and prime minister in October 2011 and was succeeded by Andrew Holness. Soon after becoming leader, Holness called an election over a year before it was constitutionally due, and the party lost by a 2:1 margin to the PNP. Portia Simpson-Miller and the PNP returned to power. The number of seats had been increased to 63, and the PNP swept to power with a landslide 42 seats to the JLP&#x27;s 21. The voter turnout was 53.17%.

Holness continued to lead the party as opposition leader. The party held a leadership election on 10 November 2013 where Holness was challenged by his deputy, Shadow Minister for Finance Audley Shaw. Holness defeated Shaw by a margin of 2,704 votes to Shaw&#x27;s 2,012.

Holness went on to lead the JLP to a narrow, one-seat parliamentary majority (32–31) in the 2016 general election, reducing the PNP to the opposition benches after one term. The voter turnout dipped below 50% for the first time, registering just 48.37%.

In the 2020 general election, Andrew Holness made history for the JLP by accomplishing a second consecutive win for the Jamaica Labour Party, winning 49 seats to 14 won by the PNP, led this time by Peter Phillips. The last time a consecutive win occurred for the JLP was in 1980. However, the turnout at this election was just 37%, probably affected by the coronavirus pandemic. This is what Jamaicans classified as a &quot;landslide victory&quot;.

== Political positions ==

The JLP is a conservative party. It believes in a market-driven economy and individual personal responsibility.

In its coverage of the 1967 general election, &quot;The Guardian&quot; identified the JLP as a left-of-centre party, only slightly to the right of the PNP.

In May 2008, in an interview with Stephen Sackur of the BBC, Bruce Golding PM and Party Leader declared that any cabinet formed by him would exclude any MP known to be gay. In previous statements, Golding stated that he and his party strongly opposed public displays of homosexuality in Jamaica and that he felt that they should continue to be illegal in keeping with Jamaican societal norms. He underlined the illegality of homosexual acts by citing Christian values and the integrity of the family.

Since the 1990s, the JLP has stated its intention for Jamaica to be a republic, thus dropping the British monarchy as its head of state.
Following Barbados&#x27; transition to a republic in 2021, Prime Minister and JLP leader Andrew Holness suggested that a referendum on republicanism could be held in Jamaica in 2025. &quot;Jamaica is, as you would see, a country that is very proud of our history and very proud of what we have achieved,&quot; Holness said in June 2022. &quot;And we intend to attain, in short order, our development goals and fulfill our true ambitions and destiny as an independent, developed, prosperous country.&quot;

<text>Jeffrey Hunter (born Henry Herman McKinnies Jr.; November 25, 1926 – May 27, 1969) was an American film and television actor and producer known for his roles in films such as &quot;The Searchers&quot; and &quot;King of Kings&quot;. On television, Hunter is known for his 1965 role as Captain Christopher Pike in the original pilot episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;.

==Early life==
Hunter was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the son of Edith Lois (née Burgess) and Henry Herman McKinnies. His family was of Scottish ancestry. After 1930, he was reared in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he graduated from Whitefish Bay High School. He was involved in school sports and began acting in local theater and radio in his early teens.

From 1942 to 1945, he spent his summers appearing in small roles for a touring summer-stock theater company from New York called the Northport Players. He made his professional radio debut in his senior year in high school on a program called &quot;Those Who Serve&quot;, playing a G.I. After graduating from high school in 1945, Hunter joined the United States Navy. He completed a naval radar course at the Radio Technical School and was assigned to Communications Division, Headquarters of the Ninth Naval District in Great Lakes, Illinois. Although he served during World War II, he did not see any battle duty because of a broken arch bone suffered in a high-school football injury.

===College===
After the war, he attended Northwestern University, from which he graduated in 1949. Here, he was a member of Phi Delta Theta fraternity.

In college, Hunter appeared in two NU stage productions, including Ruth Gordon&#x27;s &quot;Years Ago&quot; (as Captain Absolute). He also acted with the NU Theatre summer-stock company at Eagles Mere, Pennsylvania, in 1947, appearing in &quot;Too Many Husbands&quot;, &quot;The Late George Apley&quot;, &quot;Payment Deferred&quot;, &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, and &quot;Fata Morgana.&quot; He did radio work with the NU Radio Workshop and Radio Guild, and worked summers with the NBC Radio Institute in Chicago.

Hunter&#x27;s first film role came in 1949. While at NU, he was one of a number of students who were cast in David Bradley&#x27;s version of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (1950). The movie is best remembered today for starring a young Charlton Heston as Mark Antony.

He graduated from NU on August 26, 1949, then moved to the University of California at Los Angeles to get his master&#x27;s degree in radio. In 1950, he was appearing in a college production of &quot;All My Sons&quot; (in the role of Chris) and was spotted by talent scouts from 20th Century Fox and Paramount. Paramount tested him – doing two scenes from &quot;All My Sons&quot; with Ed Begley. They were impressed and offered him an option; Darryl F. Zanuck of Fox heard about this and offered him a long-term contract. The young actor agreed and the studio changed his name to &quot;Jeffrey Hunter&quot; on June 1, 1950.

==20th Century Fox==
Fox started off Hunter in a small role in &quot;Fourteen Hours&quot; (1951), shot in New York City for director Henry Hathaway; Debra Paget and he were two young people who connect while watching a man about to jump off a ledge. He had a two-minute scene in &quot;Call Me Mister&quot; (1951) and was a &quot;campus Casanova&quot; in a Jeanne Crain drama, &quot;Take Care of My Little Girl&quot; (1952), directed by Jean Negulesco. Hunter then was given a bigger part in the all-male war movie &quot;The Frogmen&quot; (1951) for director Lewis Milestone, supporting Richard Widmark and Dana Andrews; among his fellow support players was Robert Wagner, another young actor under contract to Fox at the time. The two would appear in several movies together and were often rivals for the same part.

===Leading man===
&quot;Frogmen&quot;, and Hunter&#x27;s role in it, received favorable reviews and he moved into leading roles with &quot;Red Skies of Montana&quot; (1952), billed third in a film about smokejumpers with Richard Widmark. He had a more conventional male juvenile lead in &quot;Belles on Their Toes&quot; (1953), a sequel to &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot;, which reunited him with Crain.

Marilyn Monroe later gave an interview where she discussed Hunter&#x27;s appeal: 
To me, Jeff is the acme of young American manhood. Why, he looks like he just stepped off a college campus. He&#x27;s extremely handsome, but this is not what impresses me. He has sort of — well, an all-encompassing type of magnetism. And he&#x27;s a walking advertisement for marriage. You can&#x27;t be with Jeff more than two minutes without realizing that he takes his marriage seriously, and adores his wife and child. He talks about them constantly, and with extreme pride ... You would be certain to guess, even without knowing, that Jeff is the real athletic type. He likes to ski especially, and can you think of anyone who would look better soaring down a mountain?

Fox gave Hunter his first starring role in &quot;Lure of the Wilderness&quot; (1952), a remake of &quot;Swamp Water&quot;, directed by Negulesco and opposite Jean Peters. After &quot;Dreamboat&quot; (1952), where Hunter supported Clifton Webb and Ginger Rogers, he was given his best role yet, the starring part in a war film, &quot;Sailor of the King&quot; (1953), based on C. S. Forester&#x27;s book, &quot;Brown on Resolution.&quot; Although financed by Fox, it was essentially a British film, with British talent — Hunter was cast as a Canadian to explain his accent (his casting led to some difficulties with British film unions).

&quot;Sailor of the King&quot; was a minor success, as was a Western Hunter made with Mitzi Gaynor, &quot;Three Young Texans&quot; (1954). &quot;Princess of the Nile&quot; (1954) was an &quot;Eastern&quot; with Debra Paget in the title role. It was not particularly successful, either, and Hunter did not manage to transition into being a top-line star. The title role in &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;, which had been mentioned for him, was given to Robert Wagner. &quot;It was a terrible disappointment to me&quot;, said Hunter later. &quot;I just didn&#x27;t know what to do. It seemed my career was over. They were making a lot of pictures on the lot, but I wasn&#x27;t cast in any of them and I couldn&#x27;t understand why, particularly since I started out with such a terrific lot of luck.&quot;

===Career lull===
Fox lent him out, along with Debra Paget, to Allied Artists to play the abolitionist Owen Brown in &quot;Seven Angry Men&quot; (1955), with Raymond Massey in the lead.

Hunter then played an Indian chief in the Western, &quot;White Feather&quot; (1955), essentially supporting Robert Wagner. It was a moderate hit at the box office. Hunter said after it, &quot;I had no immediate pictures scheduled ... Nothing seemed to be coming up. I wasn&#x27;t thinking of leaving my studio — it&#x27;s important having a major studio behind you. It was just that I was restless, and nothing seemed to be happening.&quot;

With a friend, Bill Hayes, he set up a production company, Hunter Enterprises. They produced a documentary, &quot;The Living Swamp.&quot; Hunter also began appearing regularly on television, having particular success in an episode of &quot;Climax!&quot; he made with Margaret O&#x27;Brien. Back at Fox, he supported Anthony Quinn in &quot;Seven Cities of Gold&quot; (1955).

He was lent to United Artists along with fellow Fox contract players Wagner and Joanne Woodward for &quot;A Kiss Before Dying&quot; (1956). Wagner had the best role —as a killer—while Hunter had the more conventional leading-man part. (The movie was shelved for a year before being released.) A loan-out to co-star with John Wayne in the title roles of the now-classic Western &quot;The Searchers&quot; (1956) began the first of three pictures he made with director John Ford, followed by &quot;The Last Hurrah&quot; (1958) and &quot;Sergeant Rutledge&quot; (1960).

===&quot;The Searchers&quot;===

Hunter&#x27;s career was revitalized when he successfully lobbied John Ford to cast him as the second lead in &quot;The Searchers&quot; (1956), supporting John Wayne.

Disney borrowed him to play William Allen Fuller in the Civil War action movie &quot;The Great Locomotive Chase&quot; (1956), opposite Fess Parker. Ironically, according to Parker&#x27;s Archive of American Television interview, Ford had originally wanted to cast Parker in Hunter&#x27;s role in &quot;The Searchers&quot;, but Disney refused to lend him out, something Parker did not hear about until years later; Parker referred to this lost opportunity as his single biggest career setback.

The success of &quot;The Searchers&quot; and &quot;The Great Locomotive Chase&quot; reignited Fox&#x27;s interest in Hunter and the studio re-signed him, while giving him the right to make one &quot;outside&quot; film a year.

He supported Robert Ryan in a Western, &quot;The Proud Ones&quot; (1956). Hunter went over to Universal Studios and supported another older star, Fred MacMurray, in another Western, &quot;Gun for a Coward&quot; (1957), in a role originally meant for James Dean. Back at Fox, Hunter was reunited with Wagner as the James brothers in &quot;The True Story of Jesse James&quot; (1957), directed by Nicholas Ray (Hunter played Frank); it was mildly popular, although considered a critical disappointment.

Fox gave him a leading role in &quot;The Way to the Gold&quot; (1957), another Western. It was a low-budget production, but proved profitable. He was one of several leads in Fox&#x27;s look at young people, &quot;No Down Payment&quot; (1957) – not a big hit, but the early work for director Martin Ritt received some critical acclaim. Fox sent Hunter to Britain to be an American star in a British war film once more: &quot;Count Five and Die&quot; (1957).

===Illness===
In October 1957, Hunter started shooting for his role in the Universal film &quot;If I Should Die&quot; (later &quot;Appointment with a Shadow&quot;), but collapsed following his first day on the set, and was replaced by George Nader. He was off the screen for 14 months while ill with what was diagnosed as hepatitis.

John Ford cast him in another film, &quot;The Last Hurrah&quot; (1958), starring Spencer Tracy. He had a cameo as himself in the Pat Boone musical at Fox, &quot;Mardi Gras&quot; (1958).

Hunter then made a war film, &quot;In Love and War&quot; (1958), co-starring with several other Fox signees such as Wagner. It proved popular.

Hunter formed a production company, Mexico Films, and made a film in Mexico, &quot;The Holy City, The Sacred City&quot;. It struggled to find a release.

John Ford used him for a third (and final) time as the lead in the Western legal drama &quot;Sergeant Rutledge&quot; (1960) starring Woody Strode, and the film was not a big success.

Hunter was in an urban thriller, &quot;Key Witness&quot; (1960), directed by Phil Karlson. After making the film, Fox did not renew its contract with Hunter.

==Career after Fox==

Hunter&#x27;s next film was with Karlson; he played Guy Gabaldon in the Allied Artists film &quot;Hell to Eternity&quot; (1960), which was a hit at the box office. Gabaldon later named one of his sons Jeffrey Hunter Gabaldon.

Nicholas Ray cast Hunter in the role of Jesus Christ in the $8 million epic &quot;King of Kings&quot; (1961), produced by Samuel Bronston. &quot;I&#x27;ve broken my shackles at last&quot;, said Hunter at the time. He told Louella Parsons, &quot;Christ was a carpenter and 33 years old, and I am 33, and I suppose my physical measurements fitted the description in the New Testament. At the time of His death, He was robust, and not a delicate man.&quot;

It was a difficult part, met by critical reaction that ranged from praise to ridicule because of Hunter&#x27;s youthful, matinee-idol appearance. However, the film was a box-office hit and remains one of Hunter&#x27;s best-remembered roles. Hunter later said: &quot;I still get an average of 1,500 letters a month from people who saw me in that film and share the beauty and inspiration I derived from it with me. There are some things that can&#x27;t be measured in dollars and cents and how can anyone put a price—even the price of a million-dollar career—on the role of the greatest Being this mortal world has ever known?&quot;

When Hunter returned to Hollywood, he deliberately selected parts that were different, such as that of a psychopathic killer in an episode of &quot;Checkmate&quot; and as the lead in a heist thriller &quot;Man-Trap&quot; (1961), directed by actor Edmond O&#x27;Brien.

At Universal, Hunter starred in &quot;No Man Is an Island&quot; (1962), the story of George Ray Tweed. He joined an all-star cast in the Fox World War II battle epic &quot;The Longest Day&quot;. Hunter provided a climactic heroic moment playing a sergeant who is killed while leading a successful attempt to breach the defense wall atop Omaha Beach in Normandy.
He traveled to Italy to make &quot;Gold for the Caesars&quot; (1963) with director André de Toth. He was set to costar with Spencer Tracy and James Stewart in &quot;The Long Flight&quot; when he received an offer to appear in a television show.

Having guest-starred on television dramas since the mid-1950s, Hunter was offered a two-year contract by Warner Bros. studio head Jack Warner that included a starring role as circuit-riding Texas lawyer Temple Lea Houston, the youngest son of Sam Houston, in the NBC series &quot;Temple Houston&quot; (1963–1964), which Hunter&#x27;s production company coproduced.

&quot;Temple Houston&quot; did not survive beyond 26 weeks, and in 1964, Hunter accepted the lead role of Captain Christopher Pike in &quot;The Cage&quot;, the first pilot episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, completed in early 1965 (with a copyright date of 1964). Hunter declined to appear in a second &quot;Star Trek&quot; pilot requested by NBC in 1965 in order to concentrate on film roles. He told the press, &quot;I was asked to do it, but had I accepted, I would have been tied up much longer than I care to be. I have several things brewing now and they should be coming to a head in the next few weeks. I love doing motion pictures and expect to be as busy as I want to be in them.&quot;

Later in 1965, Hunter filmed the pilot for another NBC series, the espionage thriller &quot;Journey into Fear&quot;, which the network rejected.

==Later career==
With the demise of the studio contract system in the early 1960s and the outsourcing of much feature production, Hunter, like many other leading men of the 1950s, found work in B movies produced in Italy, Hong Kong and Mexico, with an occasional television guest part in Hollywood.

His films included the William Conrad thriller &quot;Brainstorm&quot; (1965), the Western &quot;Murieta&quot; (1965), the spy film &quot;Dimension 5&quot; (1965), the Hong Kong-filmed but unreleased &quot;Strange Portrait&quot; (1966) and &quot;A Witch Without a Broom&quot; (1967), a comedy fantasy set in Spain. He guest-starred on &quot;Insight&quot;, &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; and &quot;The F.B.I.&quot;

After a cameo in &quot;A Guide for the Married Man&quot; (1967), Hunter took the lead role in a Western shot in Spain for Sidney W. Pink, &quot;The Christmas Kid&quot; (1967). Hunter appeared in &quot;Custer of the West&quot; (1968), also shot in Spain.

In Hollywood, Hunter supported Bob Hope in &quot;The Private Navy of Sgt. O&#x27;Farrell&quot; (1968). He returned to low-budget films such as &quot;Find a Place to Die&quot; (1968), a spaghetti Western, although in the lead role. He appeared in Italian films such as &quot;Sexy Susan Sins Again&quot; (1968) and &quot;Cry Chicago&quot; (1969), and was set to make &quot;A Band of Brothers&quot; with Vince Edwards when he died.

==Personal life==
Hunter&#x27;s first marriage from 1950 to 1955 to actress Barbara Rush produced a son, Christopher (born 1952). From 1957 to 1967, Hunter was married to model Dusty Bartlett. He adopted her son Steele, and the couple had two other children, Todd and Scott. In February 1969, just three months before his death, he married actress Emily McLaughlin.

Hunter was a Republican.

==Death==
While in Spain in November 1968 to film &quot;Cry Chicago (¡Viva América!)&quot;, a story about the Chicago Mafia, Hunter was injured in an on-set explosion when a car window near him, which had been rigged to explode outward, accidentally exploded inward. Hunter sustained a serious concussion. According to Hunter&#x27;s wife Emily, he &quot;went into shock&quot; on the flight back to the United States after filming and &quot;couldn&#x27;t speak. He could hardly move.&quot; After landing, Hunter was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles, but doctors could not find any serious injuries except for a displaced vertebra and a concussion.

On the afternoon of May 26, 1969, Hunter suffered an intracranial hemorrhage while walking down stairs at his home in Van Nuys, California. He fell, fracturing his skull. He was found unconscious and taken to Valley Presbyterian Hospital, where he underwent brain surgery. He died at about 9:30 the following morning at the age of 42.

Hunter&#x27;s funeral was held at St Mark&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Van Nuys on May 31. He was interred at Glen Haven Memorial Park in Sylmar.

==Honors==
For his contribution to the television industry, Hunter has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6918 Hollywood Boulevard.

<text>The red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus) is a small American songbird. It is somewhat warbler-like but not closely related to the New World warblers (Parulidae). Common across its vast range, this species is not considered threatened by the IUCN.

&quot;Vireo&quot; is a Latin word referring to a green migratory bird, perhaps the female golden oriole, possibly the European greenfinch. The specific &quot;olivaceus&quot; is Neo-Latin for &quot;olive-green&quot;, from Latin &quot;oliva&quot; &quot;olive&quot;.

==Description and systematics==
Adults are mainly olive-green on the upper parts with white underparts; they have a red iris and a grey crown edged with black. There is a dark blackish line through the eyes and a wide white stripe just above that line. They have thick blue-grey legs and a stout bill. They are yellowish on the flanks and undertail coverts (though this is faint in some populations).

In the past, the yellow-green vireo (&quot;V. flavoviridis&quot;), the chivi vireo (&quot;V. chivi&quot;), and the Noronha vireo (&quot;V. gracilirostris&quot;) have been considered to be conspecific with the red-eyed vireo; the chivi vireo was split most recently. Other closely related species include the black-whiskered vireo (&quot;V. altiloquus&quot;) and the Yucatan vireo (&quot;V. magister&quot;).

Measurements:

Both sexes:

* Length: 4.7–5.1 in (12–13 cm)
* Weight: 0.4–0.9 oz (12–26 g)
* Wingspan: 9.1-9.8 in (23–25 cm)

==Song==

Red-eyed vireos are one of the most prolific singers in the bird world. They usually sing high up in trees for long periods of time in a question-and-answer rhythm. This species holds the record for most songs given in a single day among bird species, with more than 20,000 songs in one day.

Songs generally consist of 1–5 syllables between 2 and 6 kHz. Songs are usually spaced apart by 0.8–1 seconds although at times vireos may sing at a slower or faster rate. Red-eyed vireos have a large repertoire size with one study finding an average of 31.4 song types per bird with one individual singing 73 different song types.

==Ecology==

The breeding habitat of the red-eyed vireo is in the open wooded areas across Canada and the eastern and northwestern United States. These birds migrate to South America, where they spend the winter. The Latin American population occur in virtually any wooded habitat in their range. Most of these are residents, but the populations breeding in the far southern part of this species&#x27; range (e.g. most of its range in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia) migrate north as far as Central America.

In northern Ohio, it seems to return to breed at about the same time as one century ago; but it may leave for winter quarters one or two weeks earlier at present than it did in the past.

Red-eyed vireos glean insects from tree foliage, favouring caterpillars and aphids and sometimes hovering while foraging. In some tropical regions, they are commonly seen to attend mixed-species feeding flocks, moving through the forest higher up in the trees than the bulk of such flocks.

They also eat berries, especially before migration, and in the winter quarters, where trees bearing popular fruit like tamanqueiro (&quot;Alchornea glandulosa&quot;) or gumbo-limbo (&quot;Bursera simaruba&quot;) will even attract them to parks and gardens. Fruit are typically not picked up from a hover, but the birds often quite acrobatically reach for them, even hanging upside down.

The nest is a cup in a fork of a tree branch. The red-eyed vireo suffers from nest parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird (&quot;Molothrus ater&quot;) in the north of its range, and by the shiny cowbird (&quot;M. bonariensis&quot;) further south. Parasitism by &quot;Haemoproteus&quot; and trypanosoma might affect these birds not infrequently, as was noted in studies of birds caught in Parque Nacional de La Macarena and near Turbo (Colombia): though only three red-eyed vireos were examined, all were infected with at least one of these parasites.

==Vagrancy==
The red-eyed vireo is a visitor to some western states, especially California. This vireo is one of the more frequent American passerine vagrants to Europe, with more than one hundred records, mainly in Ireland and Great Britain.

<text>Flinders Street railway station is a major railway station located on the corner of Flinders and Swanston streets in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It is the busiest railway station in Victoria, serving the entire metropolitan rail network, 15 tram routes travelling to and from the city, and V/Line services to Gippsland.

Opened in 1854 by the Melbourne and Hobson&#x27;s Bay Railway Company, the station, but not the current building, is the oldest in Australia, backing onto the Yarra River in the central business district. The complex now includes 13 platforms and structures that stretch over more than two city blocks, from east of Swanston Street to nearly at Market Street.

Flinders Street station is served by Metro Trains services, and V/Line regional services to Gippsland. It is the busiest station on Melbourne&#x27;s metropolitan network, with an average of 77,153 daily entries recorded in the 2017/18 fiscal year. It was the terminus of the first railway in Australia (the Port Melbourne line) and was reputedly the world&#x27;s busiest passenger station in the 1920s, owing to the concentration of services there, which were only dispersed after the construction of the City Loop in the 1970s.

The main platform (operationally divided into platforms 1 and 14) is Australia&#x27;s second longest, and the eighteenth-longest railway platform in the world. Trains at Flinders Street station connect with several tram services, and is the site of two of Melbourne&#x27;s busiest pedestrian crossings, both across Flinders Street, including one of Melbourne&#x27;s few pedestrian scrambles, at the junction with Elizabeth Street.

The current station building was completed in 1909 and is a cultural icon of Melbourne. The distinctive and eclectic Edwardian building, with its prominent dome, arched entrance, tower and clocks is one of the city&#x27;s most recognisable landmarks, and its grand, somewhat exotic character led to the popular myth that the design was actually intended for Mumbai&#x27;s Victoria Terminus and vice versa, but was swapped in the post.

The Melbourne saying &quot;I&#x27;ll meet you under the clocks&quot; refers to the row of indicator clocks above the main entrance, which show the next departure for each line; the alternative, &quot;I&#x27;ll meet you on the steps&quot;, refers to the wide staircase beneath the clocks.

It has been listed on the Victorian Heritage Register since 1982.

== History ==
=== Early terminus ===
The first railway station to occupy the Flinders Street site was a collection of weatherboard train sheds. It was opened on 12 September 1854 by the Lieutenant-Governor, Charles Hotham. The terminus was the first city railway station in Australia, and the opening day saw the first steam train trip in Australia. The train travelled to Sandridge (now Port Melbourne), over the since-reconstructed Sandridge Bridge and along what is now the light rail Port Melbourne line.

There is some confusion over the original name of the station. Leo Harrigan, in his book &quot;Victorian Railways to &#x27;62&quot;, writes that it was first named &quot;Melbourne Terminus&quot;. Newspaper articles about the opening in September 1854 refer to &quot;Melbourne terminus&quot; with a lower case &quot;t&quot;, which may have caused the misapprehension.

H.K Atkinson, in his book &quot;Suburban Tickets of the Victorian Railways&quot;, lists the station as being called &quot;Flinders Street&quot; from its opening. Early tickets for the railway just show &quot;Melbourne&quot; as the destination. Moreover, a newspaper report of December 1854 mentions that the Hobsons Bay Railway Company shareholder meeting was held at &quot;Flinders Street Station&quot;. 

In all likelihood, the station was called &quot;Melbourne, Flinders Street&quot; from the outset, and the somewhat superfluous &quot;Melbourne&quot; was gradually dropped through common usage. When Prince&#x27;s Bridge station opened across Swanston Street in 1859, the Flinders Street name would undoubtedly have become more prominent. The platforms for trains arriving from Station Pier retained the &quot;Melbourne, Flinders Street&quot; signage well into the twentieth century, so migrants fresh off the boat wouldn&#x27;t be confused about where they were.

The first terminus had a single platform long, and was located beside the Fish Market building on the south-west corner of Swanston and Flinders Streets. An additional platform was provided in 1877, along with two overhead bridges to provide passenger access, followed in 1879 by additional timber and corrugated iron buildings, and a telegraph station. The first signal boxes were opened at the station in 1883, one at each end of the platforms. By the 1890s, a third island platform had been constructed. Melbourne&#x27;s two other early central-city stations, Spencer Street and Princes Bridge, opened in 1859. Spencer Street served the lines to the west of the city, and was isolated from the eastern side of the network until a ground level railway was built connecting it to Flinders Street in 1879, this track being replaced by the Flinders Street Viaduct in 1889.

Princes Bridge station was originally separate from Flinders Street, even though it was only on the opposite side of Swanston Street. Once the railway line was extended under the street in 1865 to join the two, Princes Bridge was closed. It was reopened in April 1879, and from 1909 slowly became amalgamated into Flinders Street. Federation Square now occupies its site. Up until the 1880s a number of designs for a new station had been prepared, but none ever went further.

=== Current building ===
By the 1880s, it was becoming clear that a new central passenger station was needed to replace the existing ad-hoc station buildings. A design competition was held in 1883, but the winning entry, by William Salway, featuring a pair of grandiose Italianate buildings either side of a yet-to-be-rebuilt Princes Bridge, was not proceeded with.


Well over a decade later, the Railway Commissioners prepared an in-house design for a new &quot;Central Railway Station&quot;. It was published on 28 July 1898, and featured a dome on the corner and a clocktower at the Elizabeth Street end, and a large train shed roof over all the platforms. The Railways Standing Committee of the state parliament accepted the track and platform layout, the location of the concourse and entrances, and even the room layout to some extent, and recommended that it be funded. However, they were not satisfied with the architectural design, asking in April 1899 for a design competition &quot;for the frontage&quot;&#x27;, with a closing date of August 1899. 17 entries were received, and the winners were announced on 28 May 1900.

The £500 first prize was awarded to railway employees James Fawcett and H. P. C. Ashworth (Fawcett and Ashworth), whose design, named &quot;Green Light&quot;, was described as being in the French Renaissance style. Like the Commissioners&#x27; design, it included a large dome over the main entrance, a tall clock tower over the Elizabeth Street entrance, an entrance opposite Degraves Street, and two subways. There was to be a train shed roof of corrugated iron over the platforms &quot;supported by 12 columns&quot;, with minimal amounts of glass to protect against the summer sun (drawings of that have not survived). The Swanston Street elevation does survive, and shows an impressive three-arched roof running east–west, with a tall stained glass east end, which most likely was only to cover the concourse. The roof over the platforms may have been a similar arrangement of arches but across the lines rather than parallel.


In 1900, work began on the rearrangement of the station tracks, while the final design of the station building was still being worked on. Work on the central pedestrian subway started in 1901, and the foundations of the main building were completed by 1903.

In 1904, in mid-construction, the plans were extensively modified by the Railways Commissioners. The proposed single platform roof was replaced by individual platform roofs, and it was decided not to include the arched concourse roof. To increase office space, a fourth storey was added to the main building, which resulted in the arches above each entrance on Flinders Street being lowered, decreasing their dominance.

In 1905, work began on the station building itself, starting at the west end and progressing towards the main dome. Ballarat builder Peter Rodger was awarded the £93,000 contract. The building was originally to have been faced in stone, but that was considered too costly, so red brick, with cement render details, was used for the main building instead. Grey granite from Harcourt was used for many details at ground level on the Flinders Street side, &quot;in view of the importance of this great public work&quot;. The southern façade of the main building consisted of a lightweight timber frame clad with zinc sheets, which were scored into blocks and painted red to look like large bricks. That was done to create corridors instead of what were to be open-access balconies inside the scrapped train shed.

Work on the dome started in 1906. The structure required heavy foundations because it extended over railway tracks. In May 1908, work was progressing more slowly than planned, with the expected completion date of April 1909 increasingly unlikely to be met. Rodger&#x27;s contract was terminated in August 1908. A Royal Commission was appointed in May 1910, finding that Rodger could be held accountable for the slow progress in 1908, but he should be compensated for the difficulties before then. The Way and Works Branch of the Victorian Railways took over the project, and the station was essentially finished by mid-1909. The verandah along Flinders Street, and the concourse roof and verandah along Swanston Street, were not completed until after the official opening in 1910. 

Frederick Karl Esling, superintending engineer, was responsible for building the new Flinders Street station, as well as the widening of Swanston Street over the railway lines, resolving the changing and complicated lay-out of the tracks at the station and yards, the duplication of the Flinders street railway viaduct, and rebuilding Princes Bridge Station. 

The new Flinders Street station building had three levels at the concourse, or Swanston Street, end, and four at the lower Elizabeth Street end. Numerous shops and lettable spaces were provided, some on the concourse, but especially along the Flinders Street frontage, many at lower than street level, accessed by stairs, which created a fifth or basement level. The top three levels of the main building contained a large number of rooms, particularly along the Flinders Street frontage, mostly intended for railway use, but also many as lettable spaces. Numerous ticket windows were located at each entry, with services, such as a restaurant, country booking office, lost luggage office and visitors help booth, at the concourse or platform level. Much of the top floor was purpose-built for the then new Victorian Railway Institute, including a library, gym, and lecture hall which was later used as a ballroom. Those rooms have been largely abandoned and decaying since the 1980s.

For a number of years in the 1930s and 1940s, the building featured a creche next to the main dome on the top floor, with an open-air playground on an adjoining roof. Since 1910, the basement store beside the main entrance has been occupied by a hat shop, known as &quot;City Hatters&quot; since 1933.

The first electric train service operated from Flinders Street to Essendon in 1919, and by 1923 it was thought to be the world&#x27;s busiest passenger station, with 2300 trains and 300,000 passengers daily. In 1954, to cater for increasing traffic, as well as for the 1956 Summer Olympics, the Degraves Street subway from the station was extended to the north side of Flinders Street, creating Campbell Arcade. In March 1966, platform 1 was extended to long.

=== Redevelopment plans ===
Plans arose at various times from the 1960s to the 1970s for the demolition or redevelopment of the station, as well as the adjacent Jolimont Yard area. The station had fallen into disrepair, having not been cleaned in decades, and was covered with advertising hoardings and neon signs.

In 1962, the Minister for Transport and HKJ Pty Ltd signed an agreement for a £30 million redevelopment of the station that would have resulted in the demolition of the clock tower and its replacement by an office building up to 60 storeys high. Work was to begin in 1964 but, instead, the Gas &amp; Fuel Building was constructed over Princes Bridge station. In 1967, a company purchased the option to lease the space above Flinders Street Station, planning to build a shopping plaza and two office towers, with the dome and clock tower to be kept as part of the design, but strong opposition saw the project lapse.In 1972, Victorian Premier Henry Bolte unveiled another redevelopment plan, to cover of space above the station and Jolimont Yard for a complex of shops, offices, theatres and other community facilities. A newspaper report of 1974 said that planning was still underway for the $250 million proposal, but by 1975, public perceptions had begun to turn towards retention of the station. A Builders Labourers Federation green ban at the time helped preserve it in its existing form. The controversy over these proposals led to a re-apprasial of the architecture and significance of the station, which had been seen as something of an oddity, or even simply as dirty and ugly, such that it was classified by the National Trust of Australia (Victoria) by 1976, and eventually listed on the state Heritage Register in 1982.

In 1989, under the John Cain government, an agreement to construct a &quot;Festival Marketplace&quot; was signed. Designed by Daryl Jackson architects, it was to be built over the existing platforms in a style sympathetic to the existing station, and be completed by 1992. Planned to feature shops, restaurants and cafes, the project was abandoned in 1991 after the inability of the financiers to come up with the $205 million required due to the early 1990s recession.

In November 2011, the Victorian Government launched a $1 million international design competition to rejuvenate and restore the station. In October 2012, after receiving 118 submissions, six finalists were selected. The public could vote and the jury&#x27;s choice and people&#x27;s choice winner were announced on 8 August 2013. The competition winner was Hassell + Herzog &amp; de Meuron, while the people&#x27;s choice winner were University of Melbourne students Eduardo Velasquez, Manuel Pineda and Santiago Medina. No funding was attached to the competition, and no major changes were undertaken.

=== Refurbishment ===


The Swanston Street concourse has undergone the most change of any part of the station, and is now three times the depth of the original structure, is located near Federation Square and only the canopy and roofed area on Swanston Street remains of the original. After the first round of works in 1985 a City of Melbourne councillor, Trevor Huggard, described the renovation as &quot;vandalism of historically important sections of the station&quot;, and in 1997 the National Trust of Australia described the additions to the concourse as unsympathetic and detrimental to the station, having &quot;the character of a modern shopping centre&quot;.

The television displays used to display next train information were added to each platform in July 1980.

In 1982, a $7 million refurbishment was announced by the Minister for Transport, Steven Crabb, divided into four phases, designed by the railways architect Kris Kudlicki. Completed by 1984, the first escalators at the station provided on platforms 2 and 3 replaced ramps, and new public toilets were provided, replacing those over the platforms. The main station concourse was tiled and extended westward over the tracks, with skylights added above the ramps, and 16 new shops opened on the concourse. A restaurant was built on the southern side facing the river, which opened in October 1985, but closed soon after, instead becoming the &quot;Clocks on Flinders&quot; poker machine venue in 1994. The main steps were embedded with electrical circuits to keep them dry in June 1985.

In 1993, the Elizabeth Street subway was extended and opened at the Southbank end. Conservation work was also carried out to the main building, with the external facade repainted, exterior feature lighting installed, and the stained glass feature windows above each entry restored. Further changes were made through the late 1990s with the opening of access from the main Swanston Street concourse to platform 1, platform resurfacing with tactile tiles, and the replacement of the remainder of the original platform access ramps (except platform 10) with escalators and elevators.

The tracks to the east of the station were rebuilt between 1997 and 1998 to clear the way for the Federation Square project. Jolimont Yard was eliminated, with $40 million spent to reduce 53 operating lines between Flinders Street and Richmond Station to just 12. The number of points was also reduced, from 164 to 48. These changes also saw a reallocation of platform usage at the station, country trains being shifted from platform 1 to platform 10, and Clifton Hill group trains being shifted from the deleted Princes Bridge station to platform 1.

The final round of changes were completed by 2007. It included refurbishment of the building roof and concourse foundations, an upgrade of platform 10 with escalators and a lift replacing the ramp, the relocation of all ticket booking offices to the main entrance under the main dome and new LCD passenger information displays installed on the platforms, subways and concourse. In March 2009 an escalator replaced the lift to platform 12 and 13, with platform 13 also extended west into daylight along the alignment of the former platform 11.

In 2008, the retail pavilions on the concourse were rebuilt, increasing their area. An investigation of the potential of the abandoned spaces in the station, overseen by a task force comprising representatives from Connex, the Committee for Melbourne, Melbourne City Council, Heritage Victoria, was completed the same year, but the conclusions were not made public. In January 2010, one of the first announcements by the new Minister for Public Transport was that the government was investigating the refurbishment of the abandoned spaces for &quot;cultural uses&quot;, showing tram lines, February 2010|alt=The facade as viewed from Flinders Street, showing tram lines, February 2010]]In mid-February 2015, Premier Daniel Andrews and Minister for Public Transport Jacinta Allan announced that $100 million would be spent for urgent refurbishment works to upgrade station platforms, entrances, toilets, information displays and to restore the exterior of the main building. By July 2017, the station had been almost completely repainted in the original 1910 colours. The distinctive yellow mustard colour was replaced with more muted shades of stone and red, which were determined based on a forensic analysis of the original paint layers on the surface of the building.

As painting continued in January 2018, a further round of works was announced including the renewal of the Elizabeth Street pedestrian subway and rebuilding of the subway&#x27;s south entrance to include direct access to platform 10. In 2018 the pedestrian forecourt in front of the station&#x27;s main entrance was expanded and new security bollards were installed to protect pedestrians from cars, as part of the security response to the January 2017 Bourke Street car attack.

== Town Hall station ==

From 2025, the Flinders Street station complex will expand with the opening of the adjacent Town Hall rapid transit station under Swanston Street, which will have a number of new entrances in the surrounding precinct.

As part of the Metro Tunnel project, City Square on Swanston Street was fenced off in 2017 for the commencement of construction works on a new CBD station, which will directly connect with Flinders Street. In November 2017, after a naming competition, it was announced the CBD South station would have a separate name from Flinders Street station and be named Town Hall, after the nearby Melbourne Town Hall. Major station works on Town Hall station began in 2018 with the station expected to open in 2025.

The new station will connect with Flinders Street station via an underground walkway through the existing Campbell Arcade and Degraves Street underpass. A number of changes were made to the design of the connection with the 1950s Campbell Arcade to preserve the site&#x27;s heritage character and small, art deco shopfronts. In 2019, a section of Flinders Street was closed to cars to allow the construction of the underground connection between the two stations. 

The connection, named Flinders Link, will allow for a paid-area interchange between Metro Tunnel services at Town Hall and Flinders Street services. As part of the project, six lifts are being installed on Flinders Street station platforms 1–10 to allow for accessible access via the Degraves Street underpass.

On the 29th of January 2025 the Degraves Street Subway reopened after being closed since April 2022. As part of the upgrade elevators were added in place of one of the sets of stairs up to the platforms. The exits onto Flinders and Degraves Street remain closed until Town Hall opens later in 2025.

== Station layout ==

The platform layout at Flinders Street is almost entirely composed of through tracksa product of the constrained geography of the site and the haphazard development of the rail network around it. The first platform at the station, constructed near and parallel to Flinders Street itself, was barely even long, and allowed trains from Port Melbourne to terminate. The opening of the rail connection under Swanston Street in 1865 enabled trains from Brighton to access the platform, and so it was later extended to enable the simultaneous arrival of trains from the east and west.

A second platform to the south of the first was provided in 1877, after the amalgamation of railway companies began to increase traffic at the station. Platform expansion began in earnest following the 1882 recommendation that Flinders Street be developed as a major terminal, and the subsequent government acquisition of the railways between 1889 and 1892, three further platforms were constructed on land acquired from the former fish market in anticipation of additional traffic, which eventuated when Essendon, Coburg and Williamstown trains were routed across the viaduct in 1894. Development continued with the completion of the 1899 ground plan, which specified a total of 11 platformsplatform 1 along the main building and five pairs of island platforms to the south. The remaining platforms were constructed as works progressed on the main building, and in 1909, a decision was made to extend platforms 10 and 11 eastwards, creating two new platforms originally numbered 10 East and 11 East and now numbered 12 and 13.

Railway officials proposed amalgamating the nearby Princes Bridge station with Flinders Street with improved passenger connections in the 1890s, but failed to obtain funding from the state government for the project despite the massive redevelopment works. Nevertheless, the two stations were merged for signalling and operational purposes in 1910, and in 1966, platform 1 at Flinders Street was extended to meet its counterpart at Princes Bridge, creating a single platform face with a length over . The west end of platform 1 could also be used as a separate &quot;Platform 1 West&quot;. Eventually, in 1980, Princes Bridge was formally incorporated into Flinders Street and its three platforms were renumbered 14, 15 and 16.

Several platforms were decommissioned in the early 1990s following reductions in suburban train services. Platform 11 fell into disuse following the closure of the Port Melbourne line in 1987, and platforms 14, 15 and 16 were closed to regular services, along with the west end of platform 1. Although proposals were made to reopen it by the East West Link Needs Assessment, the platform 11 site was converted into a bar and restaurant in 2014. Platforms 15 and 16 were demolished to make way for Federation Square, but platform 14 remains intermittently in use.

A short dock platform, known as the Milk Dock or Parcels Dock, was constructed in 1910 to the north of platform 1 at the west end of the main building. Prior to the widespread transport of dairy products by road, the dock was a distribution centre for milk and other small goods arriving in Melbourne on early morning trains from Gippsland. Other small goods and parcels were later also loaded at the dock until most such traffic ceased in the 1960s. The structure remains essentially intact.

Three concourses link the platforms. The main concourse is at the east end of the station, located off Swanston Street and the main dome, and has direct access to all platforms via escalators, stair and elevators. The Degraves Street subway runs under the centre of the station, exiting to Flinders Street at the north end, with stairs directly connecting to all platforms except for platform numbers 12 and 13. The Elizabeth Street subway is at the west end, and has direct access via ramps to all platforms except for platforms 12, 13 and 14, and via a stairway to platform 1, reopened in 2017.

== Clocks ==
The distinctive clocks under the main dome that show the departure times of the next trains date back to the 1860s. Sixty Bathgate indicators were purchased from England for use at the Flinders Street, Spencer Street, Richmond and South Yarra stations. Those at Flinders Street were placed into storage when the old station was demolished in 1904, with 28 placed into the new station in 1910. They were located at the main entry under the dome, the southern side archway, and the Degraves and Elizabeth Street entrances.

Manually operated by a railway officer using a long pole, during an 8-hour period the clocks at the main entrance were changed an average of 900 times. The original indicator clocks were removed from service in 1983 as part of a redevelopment of the station, with their replacement by digital displays planned. An outpouring of public outrage and sentimentality saw the decision reversed within one day. The clocks at the main entrance were altered to automatic operation by computer, but those at the Degraves and Elizabeth Street entrances were replaced by large airport-style split-flap displays.

The space &quot;under the clocks&quot; or &quot;on the steps&quot; leading to the dome has been a popular informal meeting place for Melburnians since the station&#x27;s opening. Although the area was not intended for this purpose, and there is no seating or other infrastructure to suggest it as a destination, the locationopposite the well-known Young and Jackson Hotel and overlooking two of the busiest tram routes in the citymeans it is accessible and visible to many of the city&#x27;s main pedestrian thoroughfares. Many people who meet &quot;under the clocks&quot; do not arrive by train; the site&#x27;s cultural significance extends beyond its main function as a transport hub. A clock tower has also existed at the end of Elizabeth Street since 1883. The first one was known as the &#x27;Water Tower Clock&#x27;, after a wooden framed water tower erected on the site in 1853. That clock remained in place until 1905 when work begun on the new station, the clock tower being moved to outside Princes Bridge station. In 1911 it was moved to Spencer Street station, where it remained until the station was redeveloped in 1967. Sold to a private collector, it was returned to public ownership and in 1999 was put on display at the Scienceworks Museum, Spotswood. It was returned to the renamed Southern Cross station in 2014.

Today&#x27;s Elizabeth Street clock tower was constructed between August 1906 and November 1907, the clock being built to an English design by Melbourne clock maker F. Ziegeler. Originally needing to be wound every day, it is now electrically operated. It was cleaned and overhauled between 2017 and 2018 before being fully restored to service.

== Signal boxes ==
The first signal boxes were opened at the station in 1883, one at each end of the platforms. From the 1900s until 1983, five signal boxes controlled traffic into the station.

Flinders Street A was located at the western end of the station, between the lines to St Kilda/Port Melbourne and Spencer Street, and controlled all traffic from the west. It was of &quot;traditional&quot; Victorian Railways design, in brick, and had two mechanical lever frames of equal size, totalling 280 levers. The mechanical signals were decommissioned in October 1979. The signal box has been burnt twice, the second time being in 2002, destroying the timber and glass superstructure and slate roof. In 2009, it was rebuilt as &quot;Signal&quot;, a youth arts centre funded by the City of Melbourne.

Flinders Street B was located at the Richmond end of platforms 8 and 9 and controlled the southern tracks from Jolimont Yard. It was of traditional VR design, in brick, and was demolished when the Federation Square deck was built.

Flinders Street C was located beyond the Richmond end of platforms 4 and 5 and controlled the northern tracks from Jolimont Yard. It was of traditional VR design and was demolished together with Flinders Street B.

Flinders Street D was located at the Richmond end of the Princes Bridge island platform (later incorporated into Flinders Street as platforms 15 and 16). The structure, of utilitarian brick construction, remains today, just beyond the Federation Square deck.

Flinders Street E was located at Richmond Junction, and controlled the junction as well as access into the Richmond end of the stabling sidings. Of utilitarian brick construction, it remains in place today underneath the William Barak Bridge.

Since 1983, the station has been remotely controlled by Metrol. The station precinct is operated by four interlockings corresponding to former signal boxes A, B, D and E.

== Usage ==

Flinders Street is the busiest station on Melbourne&#x27;s metropolitan network. In 2023-24 it recorded 20.35 million passengers.

<text>Pau Claris i Casademunt (; 1 January 1586 – 27 February 1641) was a Catalan lawyer, clergyman and 94th President of the Deputation of the General of Catalonia at the beginning of the Catalan Revolt. On 16 January 1641 he proclaimed the Catalan Republic under the protection of France.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Claris was born in Barcelona (then in the Principality of Catalonia, part of the Spanish Monarchy). His paternal family was from Berga, and both his grandfather, Francesc, and his father, Joan, were prominent jurists in Barcelona. His mother was Peronella Casademunt. Pau was the youngest of four brothers, and his older brother, Francesc, was a lawyer who had a strong influence on his brother&#x27;s path toward politics. The Claris family belonged to the Barcelonan bourgeois and had significant economic and administrative power.

While it is possible that his education may have been more extensive, it is only clear that Pau Claris received a doctorate in civil law and canon law from the University of Barcelona, and that he studied the course during the period between 1604 and 1612.

On 28 August 1612 Claris was appointed to work in La Seu d&#x27;Urgell, the seat of the Bishop of Urgell and Andorra. On 25 September the same year, he was appointed canon, and was assigned to the Diocese of Urgell.

===Political career===

In 1626, Claris was elected as a representative of the church at the &quot;Corts Catalanes&quot; (Parliament of Catalonia), which opened on 28 March amid a troublesome political situation after the new king of Spain, Philip IV, would not ratify the Catalan constitutions, due to tax reasons and the question of whether royal officers had to follow the Catalan law. The Catalan church had been exhausted by the royal taxes and was against the practice of nominating bishops from Castile to Catalan dioceses. The refusal to pay a tax of 3,300,000 ducats caused the immediate departure of the king to Madrid.

It was not until 1632 that the Parliament resumed, although with the same members as in 1626. At this time the rebellion against the Spanish crown was evident, led by a brilliant generation of lawyers, such as Joan Pere Fontanella, who was the legal advisor of both the &quot;Generalitat&quot; and the &quot;Consell de Cent&quot; (municipal government of Barcelona).

In 1632, Claris was appointed by the Ecclesiastical Arm of the government to treat the subject of an election, and on 15 July the estate appointed eighteen people - the &quot;Divuitena&quot; - that would form the role of the Executive Board.

The most remarkable political episode of this period of Claris&#x27; life were the riots of Vic. As a result of a papal concession that granted the king of Spain a tenth of the revenues of the Church in Spain, popular unrest virulently erupted in the diocese of Vic under the guidance of the archdeacon, Melcior Palau i Boscà, with the impassioned support of two canons of Urgell, Claris and Jaume Ferran.

The seizure of ecclesiastical property in Vic by the Royal Court caused revolutionary demonstrations, with defamatory libel and threats of subversion in the field during the spring and summer of 1634. Despite pressure from the bishop of Girona, the Council of Aragon only dared to imprison a dissident deacon, Pau Capfort. Finally, the conflict delayed the payment of the tenth until the end of November.

In 1630 and 1636, Claris attended the church&#x27;s Councils of Tarragona. In 1636 he achieved approval of a provision whereby all sermons in the Principality would be in the Catalan language, in spite of the neutralizing efforts of the archbishop of Tarragona, the Spaniard Antonio Pérez.

===The presidency of the &quot;Generalitat&quot;===

On 22 July 1638 Pau Claris was elected ecclesiastical deputy of the &quot;Diputació del General&quot;. The other members chosen with Claris were Francesc de Tamarit and Josep Miquel Quintana as deputies of the Military and Royal Arms, and Jaume Ferran (also a canon from Urgell), Rafael Antic, and Rafael Cerdà as auditors of the Ecclesiastical, Military, and Royal Arms, respectively.

As the church deputy, Claris presided over the meetings of the &quot;Generalitat&quot;. According to historian J. H. Elliott, Dalmau de Queralt, Count of Santa Coloma and Viceroy of Catalonia, tried in vain to bribe Claris and Tamarit, individuals uncomfortable about their role in the service of the king.

Claris found a government with very grave economic problems, resulting from years of mismanagement, and conflict that opened with the Spanish Crown accusing the &quot;Generalitat&quot; of smuggling, due to a breach of the edicts of 1635 and 1638 that prohibited any kind of trade with France because of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The intervention of the sheriff Montrodón, commissioned by Dalmau de Queralt to the warehouses of Mataró and Salses, triggered the conflict, in which the lawyer Joan Pere Fontanella again played a prominent role in favor of the theses of the Members of the Government. Although the city of Barcelona was initially reluctant, it sided with the Members in 1639, especially because of the decision of the Crown to establish a general recovery from Catalonia of 50,000 pounds annually for the years 1639 and 1640.

Behind this new effort was the eagerness of Philip IV and the Count-Duke of Olivares to have all the lands of the Spanish Crown contribute financially to the expenses incurred in the Thirty Years&#x27; War, which had already devastated Castile economically. Catalonia had never felt that this conflict was its own. Olivares, to counterbalance this situation, wanted to launch a front against France from Catalonia with Catalan help. On 19 July 1639 the French besieged and took the Fort de Salses in Roussillon. This initiated a severe struggle between the Count-Duke and the &quot;Generalitat&quot; to increase the Catalan efforts in the war. Finally, the deputies agreed to send Francesc de Tamarit to the front of a new draft of soldiers to recover the castle of Salses, which was achieved on 6 January 1640 (the feastday of the Epiphany). However, the cost in human lives and money for the principality was so great that the situation became explosive.

===The Revolt===
Regardless of the actual date that contacts with France began, it would end with the formation of a Catalan-French alliance that confronted the Spanish Crown and gave rise to the so-called Reapers&#x27; War or Catalan Revolt. Although it remains a controversial issue among historians, it seems that they could have already started in the month of May 1640. Pau Claris had summoned the general court on 10 September 1640 but simultaneously, and without consulting the cities, would have begun the contacts with the French.

On 7 September 1640 the representatives of the Generality of Catalonia, Francesc de Tamarit, Ramon de Guimerà, and Francesc de Vilaplana, nephew of Claris, signed the first Pact of Céret with Bernard Du Plessis-Besançon, delegated by Armand Jean du Plessis de Richelieu, Cardinal-Duc de Richelieu on behalf of Louis XIII of France, for which Catalonia had received military support aimed at facing the Castilian offensive commanded by the Count-Duke of Olivares, who had already decided to intervene in Catalonia. It is believed that in front of the Castilian military pressure, Claris was seen to be progressively driven to accept a counter-course to French pressure, in which Catalonia would separate itself from the Spanish Monarchy and would take the form of a Free Republic under the protection of the French king.

The personal assumption of power by Claris&#x27; staff from September 1640, appeared to be total. A Council of Arms (&quot;Junta General de Braços&quot;) was summoned and set up as the ruling institution of the new situation, the commitments with France and the secession were made official, and public debt was issued for funding the military expenses.

On 20 October 1640 Du Plessis-Besançon went to Barcelona, and some days afterwards, he signed the first pact of confraternity and military aid from France to Catalonia, by which France was engaged to defend the Principality.

===Catalan Republic===

On 24 November the Spanish army under Pedro Fajardo, the Marquis of Los Vélez, invaded Catalonia from the south. On 23 December Pau Claris raised the alarm and declared war against Philip IV of Spain. The victorious advance of the Castilian troops through Tortosa, Cambrils, Tarragona, and Martorell forced the Council of Arms and &quot;Consell de Cent&quot; to yield to the French pressures, and on 16 and 17 January respectively, the Junta and &quot;Consell&quot; accepted the proposal to constitute Catalonia into a republic under the protection of France.

But again the pressure of the Castilians who approached Barcelona, and the French pretensions toward Catalonia, brought Claris to have to end the republican project and proclaim Louis XIII the Count of Barcelona on 23 January 1641, three days before the Battle of Montjuïc in which the French and Catalan armies defeated the Castilian forces and stopped the attack in Barcelona.With the &quot;Treaty of the Pyrenees&quot; signed on 7 November 1659, ended the Franco-Spanish War that had begun in 1635. France gained Roussillon (including Perpignan) and the northern half of Cerdanya which was separated from Catalonia as result of the Catalan revolt and Pau Claris international politics tacticism.

===Death===

On 20 February 1641 Claris fell gravely ill, the same day that Philippe de La Mothe-Houdancourt arrived in Barcelona with the powers of commander-in-chief of all French and Catalan armies. The following day Claris received the last rites, and he died on the night of 27 February. Despite the fact that he had health problems for at least a year, the theory of a possible poisoning circulated since the first moment, as noted in a letter from Roger de Bossost, Baron d&#x27;Espenan, to du Plessis-Besançon; some modern investigations support this possibility.

Claris was placed in the family crypt of the chapel of the Holy Christ in the Church of Sant Joan de Jerusalem in Barcelona. Unfortunately the church was demolished in 1888 as part of the urban reformation for the upcoming Universal Exhibition of Barcelona.

==Monuments and Honors==
In Barcelona, several monuments have been raised to Claris, the best known of which is the statue located at the end of the Passeig de Lluís Companys. Created by Rafael Atché i Ferré and dedicated in 1917, it was withdrawn and saved during the Spanish Civil War and repositioned in 1977. Right from its dedication, but with interruptions due to the war and the subsequent political persecution of the Catalan culture, the place has become a meeting point and commemoration of the political sensitivities on the brink of Catalan independence.

In Barcelona, in the district of Eixample, there is the Carrer de Pau Claris. It starts in Avinguda Diagonal and ends in Plaça Urquinaona. Many other towns in Catalonia have streets and squares dedicated to his recognition. There is also a school in his name on the Passeig de Lluís Companys in Barcelona.

The same year of his death, Francesc Fontanella published &quot;Panegíric a La Mort De Pau Claris De Francesc Fontanella&quot;.

<text>The Academy of Persian Language and Literature (APLL) (, &quot;Farhangestân-e Zabân-o Adab-e Fârsi&quot;) is the regulatory body for the Persian language, headquartered in Tehran, Iran. Formerly known as the Academy of Iran (, &quot;Farhangestân-e Iran&quot;), it was founded on May 20, 1935, by the initiative of Reza Shah, the founder of Pahlavi dynasty. The academy acts as the official authority on the language, and contributes to linguistic research on Persian and other languages of Iran.

==History==
===Early efforts===
The first official attentions to the necessity of protecting the Persian language against foreign words, and to the standardization of Persian orthography, were under the reign of Naser al-Din Shah of the Qajar dynasty in 1871. After Naser al-Din Shah, Mozaffar al-Din Shah ordered the establishment of the first Persian association in 1903. This association officially declared that it used Persian and Arabic as acceptable sources for coining words. The ultimate goal was to prevent books from being printed with wrong use of words. According to the executive guarantee of this association, the government was responsible for wrongfully-printed books. Words coined by this association, such as &quot;rāh-āhan&quot; () for &quot;railway&quot;, were printed in &quot;Soltani Newspaper&quot; (); but the association was eventually closed due to inattention.

A scientific association was founded in 1911, resulting in a dictionary called &quot;Words of Scientific Association&quot; (), which was completed in the future and renamed &quot;Katouzian Dictionary&quot; ().

===Establishment of the academy===
The first academy for the Persian language was founded on May 20, 1935, under the name &quot;Academy of Iran&quot;. It was established by the initiative of Reza Shah, and mainly by Hekmat e Shirazi and Mohammad Ali Foroughi, all names in the nationalist movement of the time.

Ferdowsi was a motivation behind Reza Shah&#x27;s decision to remove the foreign loanwords from Persian, replacing them with Persian equivalents. In 1934, Reza Shah ordered to rebuild Ferdowsi&#x27;s tomb and set up a country-wide ceremony in honor of a thousand years of Persian literature since the time of Ferdowsi, titled &quot;Ferdowsi millennial celebration&quot;, inviting notable Iranian and foreign scholars.

The members of the academy included a number of notable literary figures and highly celebrated scholars upon its foundation, including Abbas Eqbal Ashtiani, Mohammad-Taqi Bahar, Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda, Mohammad Ali Foroughi, Badiozzaman Forouzanfar, Homayun Forouzanfar, Qasem Ghani, Abdolazim Gharib, Mohammad Ghazvini, Mohammad Hejazi, Ali-Asghar Hekmat, Mahmoud Hessabi, Mohammad-Ali Jamalzadeh, Ahmad Matin-Daftari, Saeed Nafisi, Ebrahim Pourdavoud, Isa Sadiq, Zabihollah Safa, Ali Akbar Siassi, and Rashid Yasemi.

Some foreign scholars were also involved, such as Arthur Christensen (from Denmark), Muhammad Husayn Haykal (from Egypt), Abduqodir Maniyozov (from Tajikistan), Henry Masset (from France), Raf&#x27;at Pasha (from Egypt), Jan Rypka (from Czechoslovakia), Dodikhudo Saymiddinov (from Tajikistan), and Muhammadjon Shakuri (from Tajikistan) and Syed Waheed Ashraf (from India).

The academy was a key institution in the struggle to re-build Iran as a nation-state after the collapse of the Qajar dynasty. During the 1930s and 1940s, the academy led massive campaigns to replace the many Arabic, French, and Greek loanwords whose immense use in Persian during the centuries preceding the foundation of the Pahlavi dynasty had created a literary language considerably different from the spoken Persian of the time.

==Functions==
The academy strives to protect the integrity of the Persian language. It heads the academic efforts for linguistic research on the Persian language and its sister Iranian languages. It has also created an official orthography of Persian.

The attention of the academy has also been towards the persistent infiltration of Persian, like many other languages, with foreign words, as a result of the globalization process. The academy constantly campaigns for the use of Persian equivalents of new loanwords. If no equivalents exist, it has the task of linguistically deriving such words from existing Persian roots, and promoting the adoption of these new coinages in the daily lives. The Iranian law requires those equivalents to be used in the official media, governmental affairs, and product management of all companies.

== The Encyclopedia of Persian Language and Literature in South Asia ==

The Encyclopedia of Persian Language and Literature in South Asia (India, Pakistan and Bangladesh) was established in 1993 in order to compile the Encyclopedia of Persian Language and Literature in South Asia.

==Membership==
The academy members are selected from masters of Persian literature and linguistics. After the 1979 Revolution, Hassan Habibi was appointed as the academy&#x27;s president, and he remained in that position until his death in 2013. The current president is Gholam-Ali Haddad-Adel.

The following is a list of both living and deceased permanent members of the academy since the 1979 Revolution.

==Announcement of the Academy about the name of the Persian language in foreign languages==
On November 19, 2005, the Academy of the Persian Language and Literature delivered a pronouncement on the name of the Persian language, rejecting any use of the word &quot;Farsi&quot; (instead of English &quot;Persian&quot;, German &quot;Persisch&quot;, Spanish &quot;persa&quot;, French &quot;persan&quot;, etc.) in foreign languages.

The announcement reads:
# &quot;Persian&quot; has been used in a variety of publications including cultural, scientific, and diplomatic documents for centuries and, therefore, it carries a very significant historical and cultural meaning. Hence, changing &quot;Persian&quot; to &quot;Farsi&quot; would negate this established important precedent.
# Changing the usage from &quot;Persian&quot; to &quot;Farsi&quot; may give the impression that &quot;Farsi&quot; is a new language, although this may well be the intention of some users of &quot;Farsi&quot;.
# Changing the usage may also give the impression that &quot;Farsi&quot; is a dialect used in some parts of Iran rather than the predominant (and official) language of the country.
# The word &quot;Farsi&quot; has never been used in any research paper or university document in any Western language, and the proposal to begin using it would create doubt and ambiguity about the name of the official language of Iran.

Supporting this announcement, gradually other institutions and literary figures separately took similar actions throughout the world.

<text>Henry Arnold Waxman (born September 12, 1939) is an American politician and lobbyist who was a U.S. representative from California from 1975 to 2015. He is a member of the Democratic Party.

His district included much of the western part of the city of Los Angeles, as well as West Hollywood, Santa Monica, and Beverly Hills, and was numbered the 24th district from 1975 to 1993, the 29th district from 1993 to 2003, and the 30th district from 2003 to 2013, changing because of redistricting after the 1990, 2000, and 2010 censuses.

Waxman was an influential liberal member of Congress, and was instrumental in passing laws including the Infant Formula Act of 1980, the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, the Clean Air Act of 1990, the Ryan White CARE Act of 1990, the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996, the State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program of 1997, the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009, and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. In 1985, he played an instrumental role in banning federal funding for the Red Line subway in Los Angeles so that it would not go into his affluent Westside district.

He is currently chairman at Waxman Strategies, a D.C.-based lobbying firm, Regent Lecturer for the University of California, Los Angeles, and lecturer at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Waxman was born to a Jewish household in Los Angeles, California, the son of Esther (née Silverman) and Ralph Louis Waxman. His father was born in Montreal, Canada; his mother was from Pennsylvania. All of his grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Russia. He attended college at UCLA, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science in 1961 and a J.D. degree from UCLA School of Law in 1964. After graduating, he worked as a lawyer. He was elected to the California State Assembly in 1968, and served three terms. Along with U.S. Representative Howard Berman, whom he studied with at UCLA, Waxman co-founded the Los Angeles County Young Democrats.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
In 1974, Democratic U.S. Representative Chet Holifield retired after 16 terms in Congress. Waxman gave up his state assembly seat to run for the district, which had been re-numbered from the 19th to the 24th in a mid-decade redistricting. Waxman won the Democratic nomination for the district, and easily won the general election, as this was tantamount to election in this heavily Democratic district. He was re-elected 17 times, with no substantive opposition. He faced no major-party opposition in 1986, and was completely unopposed in 2008. His district changed numbers four times in his tenure — from the 24th (1975–1993) to the 29th (1993–2003) to the 30th (2003–2013) to the 33rd (2013-2015). At the time of his retirement, he was one of the last two members, along with George Miller of California, of the large Democratic freshman class of 1975.

From 2003 to 2013, Waxman&#x27;s district included Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Agoura Hills, Calabasas, Hidden Hills, Malibu, West Hollywood, and Westlake Village, as well as such areas of western Los Angeles as West Los Angeles, Fairfax, Pacific Palisades, Brentwood, Beverlywood, Topanga, Chatsworth, Palms, Westwood, West Hills, Westside Village, Woodland Hills, but through the creation of a new 33rd Congressional District by the California Citizens Redistricting Commission, in the November 2012 general election, Waxman won re-election in an area including his home community of Beverly Hills and stretching to Malibu and Pacific-coastal communities heading south, including Santa Monica, Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach, the Palos Verdes Peninsula, and Northwest San Pedro.

===Tenure===
Before the Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives in 1995, Waxman was a powerful figure in the House as chair of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health and the Environment from 1979. In this role, he conducted investigations into a range of health and environmental issues, including universal health insurance, Medicare and Medicaid coverage, AIDS, and air and water pollution. In 1994, Waxman forced the chief executives of the seven major tobacco companies to swear under oath that nicotine was not addictive.

Waxman&#x27;s stated legislative priorities are health and environmental issues. These include universal health insurance, Medicare and Medicaid coverage, tobacco, AIDS, air and water quality standards, pesticides, nursing home quality standards, women&#x27;s health research and reproductive rights, the availability and cost of prescription drugs, and the right of communities to know about pollution levels. As an example of Waxman&#x27;s thoughts regarding tobacco, on April 13, 2010, he requested that Major League Baseball ban smokeless tobacco in all its various forms - snuff, dipping tobacco, chewing tobacco, snus, etc.

With the Democrats&#x27; victory in the 2006 midterm elections, Waxman became chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the principal investigative committee of the House. He was the committee&#x27;s ranking Democrat from 1997 to 2007. In 1998, while he was still ranking member, he created a &quot;Special Investigations Division&quot; to investigate matters that he felt the full committee had neglected. This was possible because the committee has broad powers to investigate any matter with federal policy implications, even if another committee has jurisdiction over it. He has also harshly criticized the Republicans for ignoring their &quot;constitutional responsibility&quot; to conduct oversight over the government.

On March 16, 2004, at Waxman&#x27;s request, the Committee on Government Reform Minority Office published &quot;Iraq on the Record, the Bush Administration&#x27;s Public Statements on Iraq&quot;, a detailed and searchable collection of 237 specific misleading statements made by Bush Administration officials about the threat posed by Iraq. It contains statements that were misleading based on what was known to the Administration at the time the statements were made. It does not include statements that appear mistaken only in hindsight. If a statement was an accurate reflection of U.S. intelligence at the time it was made, it was excluded even if it now appears erroneous.

In 2006, Project On Government Oversight, a government watchdog group, presented Waxman with its Good Government Award for his various contributions to government transparency and oversight.

On the day after the 2006 elections, Waxman directed his aides to draw up an &quot;oversight plan&quot; for the panel. He had already let it be known that he wanted to investigate Halliburton, as well as its alleged malfeasance related to government contracts in Iraq. It is very likely that he could also investigate the numerous scandals surrounding Jack Abramoff. This led to concerns among Democratic aides that the Government Reform Committee under Waxman would stage a repeat of the committee&#x27;s performance under the Clinton administration, when it issued over 1,000 subpoenas. However, Waxman told &quot;Newsweek&quot; that he is interested in accountability and not retaliation.

In 2009, he began serving as the Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, after defeating Chairman John Dingell in a 137–122 secret vote of House Democrats on November 20, 2008.

Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming once described Waxman as being &#x27;tougher than a boiled owl.&#x27;

Waxman is proud of his &quot;strong Jewish identity&quot; and has drawn political conclusions from his exploration of the religion. &quot;Judaism is about acting and doing the right thing, not simply believing in it or mindlessly following ritual,&quot; he said in a speech presented by the University of Southern California&#x27;s Casden Institute for the Study of the Jewish Role in American Life. Waxman said he applies Jewish ethical values to his congressional service. He further said that the &quot;Jewish values&quot; of &quot;human rights, social justice, and equal opportunities ... are synonymous with American values,&quot; and that such values &quot;are in my opinion closer to a Democratic position.&quot; Waxman supported fellow representative Jane Harman during her primary challenge from Marcy Winograd when Winograd said she would support a one-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, instead of the two-state resolution endorsed by Waxman and Harman. Saying it suffers from &quot;a culture of corruption&quot; and &quot;has become obsessed with secrecy,&quot; he accused the American government of having abandoned these values. &quot;(The) Republican leadership ignores presidential rules and norms and has no consideration for custom,&quot; he said.

====Abortion====
Waxman was strongly critical of the Stupak-Pitts Amendment, which places limits on taxpayer-funded abortions in the context of the November 2009 Affordable Health Care for America Act. Instead of this version, it was reported that many Democrats supported a version that would find &quot;common ground.&quot;

====1985 subway opposition====
In 1985, Waxman sponsored a bill supported by affluent homeowners groups in his district to ban federal funding for the Red Line subway after a methane gas explosion in the Fairfax District. Prior to that, Waxman had privately expressed concerns about &quot;gentrification&quot; of his affluent district.

Waxman maintains that the 1985 bill was sponsored in the interest of public safety and not, as some allege, to hinder access of the working classes in South and East Los Angeles to his affluent district. In a letter to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Waxman cites the 2005 study: &quot;The panel concurred as well that in 1985, the decision to hold further tunneling in abeyance was prudent, given the circumstances and extent of information and technology at that time. Much has changed since then to significantly improve tunneling and operation safety.&quot;

In 2005, a robust real estate market, multi-dwelling construction boom, and lack of public mass transit planning on the westside caused by Waxman&#x27;s bill resulted in gridlock throughout Waxman&#x27;s district. At the request of Los Angeles Mayor and LA Metro Board President Antonio Villaraigosa, Waxman agreed to lift the ban if a panel of five engineers found tunneling under the Miracle Mile stretch of Wilshire Boulevard to be safe. In October 2005, the panel decided that tunneling was possible, and on December 16, Waxman responded by announcing he would introduce a bill to the U.S. House that would lift the ban on federal money for subway tunneling in the district. This bill passed the House via unanimous vote on September 20, 2006.

====Solyndra====
Waxman, as the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, oversaw the case of Solyndra, a solar company that filed for bankruptcy after receiving a $535 million loan guarantee from the DOE. Waxman recounted meeting with Solyndra&#x27;s CEO two months before they filed for bankruptcy, who assured him that &quot;Solyndra’s future was bright with sales and production booming.&quot; Waxman was accused of being involved with the Solyndra loan by Darrell Issa. Waxman responded, saying he had no involvement in the selection of the loan.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Energy and Commerce (Ranking Member)
** As ranking member of the full committee, Rep. Waxman may serve as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of all subcommittees.

====Caucus memberships====

* International Conservation Caucus

==Electoral history==
==Post-congressional career==
Once hailed in the media as a &quot;lobbyist&#x27;s worst nightmare,&quot; Waxman became a successful and influential lobbyist when he opened his own firm after retiring from Congress.

== In popular culture ==
In 1993, a news clip of Waxman was used for the movie &quot;And the Band Played On&quot;, and in 2021, Waxman was praised by television host Bill Maher on his HBO Talk Show Series &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;. In discussing the concept of political &quot;work horses&quot;, as compared to &quot;show horses&quot;, Maher described Waxman&#x27;s legislative achievements and emphasized that Waxman&#x27;s tenacity and low public profile as a &quot;work horse&quot; allowed him to effect substantial change in the United States, specifically through updates to programs and policies including food safety, clean air, HIV research, and the social safety net. In Waxman&#x27;s honor, Maher introduced a segment titled &quot;The Baldy Awards&quot;, to recognize the achievements of Waxman and other &quot;work horse&quot; politicians.

<text>This article lists political parties in Kenya.

== Political culture ==
Kenya&#x27;s system is one with characteristics comparable with a two-party system, since two dominant political parties c.q. coalitions have dominated since the last general elections in 2007. However, it has been a multi-party system since 1992 and one of the ruling coalitions consists of several parties.
Kenya had over 160 registered political parties as of November 2007.

Following the implementation of several Political Parties Acts starting with the 31 December 2008 act, the number of political parties has been coming down considerably since. With the lapse of the registration period set out in the political parties act on 30 April 2012, twenty-four political parties had gained registration certificates while 22 others had applied for registration.

<doc id="408975" wikidata="Q2578354" url="?curid=408975" title="William Crawford Sherrod">
<text>William Crawford Sherrod (August 17, 1835 – March 24, 1919) was an American politician and Confederate officer from Alabama. He attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Afterward, he was a planter and served as a Delegate to the Democratic National Convention from Alabama in 1860. He was also a delegate to the Charleston convention of 1860.

Sherrod was a Unionist and failed to support the move for secession. Sherrod nevertheless served in the Confederate Army in the cavalry, as a Colonel under the command of Nathan Bedford Forrest. After the conclusion of the American Civil War, he served in the United States Congress in the House (1869–1871). After that, he served in the Alabama legislature.

==1860 Democratic National Convention==
William Crawford Sherrod wrote the following notes about his involvement in the Charleston Convention of 1860 and his service during the Civil War:

&quot;I was a member of the Charleston Democratic convention which convened in 1860; this was a very important period for the South, and the nation as well. I was a member of the Alabama legislature being 28 years of age, and at the time was made a delegate to the State Convention held at Montgomery and there made a delegate to the National Convention that was held at Charleston, SC.

&quot;The Alabama convention directed its delegation to withdraw from the convention in the event of the convention refusing to guarantee the right of persons to carry their slaves into the Territories, and they demanded that the government should protect them in so doing. This was not in accordance with the views of Stephen Douglas on the subject of slavery. Mr. Douglas was the foremost candidate before the convention for the presidency -- he advocated the doctrine of &quot;Squatter Sovereignty,&quot; with which I entirely agreed and endorsed Mr. Douglas&#x27; candidacy, but could do him but little good, as I believed that a state convention had a right to instruct its delegates, which instructions I obeyed to the letter.

&quot;The delegates failing to get a plank endorsing the Alabama views, agreed to by the Committee on Platforms, withdrew,
I think it was on the 23rd day of April, from the convention. We all returned to Alabama. There was a division of the delegations as soon as the withdrawal was accomplished; about one-third of the delegates favored by Mr. Douglas, and the idea of Squatter-sovereignty, and the other two-thirds demanded unconditional protection; one set of delegates were called &quot;Secessionists.&quot; The other set &quot;Submissionists.&quot; The Secessionists called a convention to meet at Montgomery, Alabama, and the Submissionists called a convention to meet at Selma, Alabama.

&quot;Both conventions sent delegates; the Secessionists to Richmond, VA, the Submissionists to Baltimore, Maryland, where the regular Democratic convention had adjourned at Charleston to meet at Baltimore.

&quot;So far as I am advised, I am the only living delegate who was at the convention. I could not attend the Baltimore Convention with others who were appointed at Selma. the other delegates who were at Montgomery were appointed to Richmond. The Richmond Convention ultimately adjourned and met at the same time as the other convention at Baltimore, but there were two separate conventions. Douglas was nominated immediately by the regular convention, and Breckenridge by the seceding convention; then, the warmest political canvas imaginable was inaugurated in Alabama. I was still a member of the Alabama legislature and the governor issued a call for a special session of the legislature which met at the same time that the secession convention met at Montgomery. The Secession convention formed a government known as the &quot;Southern Confederacy.&quot;

&quot;I did not think it best for the South to secede and with two other members never signed the ordinance of secession. I believed that we would have a war that would be disastrous to the South and our best young men would all be sacrificed and the property of the South, which consisted mostly of negroes, would be lost. I had no idea at any time of separating myself from the South, preferring to be with them believing them to be wrong than to be with the Northern army knowing it to be right.

&quot;At the beginning of the war I was engaged in special service most of the time. I was in the last battle East of the Mississippi River which was fought after both Lee and Johnson surrendered. General Forrest, with whose command I was attached, fought General Wilson with about four thousand Confederates; the Federals having ten thousand as fine cavalry as ever followed any command in the line of battle. The last command that I ever received came from General Bedford Forrest in person at the battle of Selma which was to have all the dry grass removed from the breast-works; that it would catch on fire whenever the fire became hot, and smoke us out.&quot;

==Military service==
During the Civil War Sherrod served as a colonel under Gen. N.B. Forrest in the Confederate Army. Record of William Crawford Sherrod&#x27;s military service in the Civil War:

Cavalry:

Sherrod, W. C. -- 5th Regt. Ala. Cav. Act&#x27;g Ass&#x27;t Commissary Subsistence

Organization of Brig. Gen. Roddey&#x27;s Cav. Command November 20, 1864

== Return to politics ==
Sherrod was a member of the 41st United States Congress representing Alabama&#x27;s 5th District from March 1869 to March 1871. In his Congressional record, we find that the Southern Pacific Railroad bill was turned over to him after it had been abandoned by all others, and that it was placed in his hands at the special request of Gen. Freemont.

Col. Sherrod knew almost intimately every leading man in the 41st Congress and was upon terms of amity with them without regard to politics. To his credit, it may be said that he had at all times labored to promote and rebuild the country, and that he participated not in political discussions.

In 1879 William Crawford Sherrod represented the Second Senatorial district in the upper house of the Alabama State Legislature and as a member of the finance Committee assisted in framing the revenue bill that piloted the state out of its indebtedness. He came to Florence in June 1883 for the purpose of schooling his children. In June 1886 in connection with W.B. Wood formulated the idea of the Florence Boom. He was one of the originators of the Florence Land &amp; Mining Company, of the W.B. Wood Furnace Co., of which he is Vice President, also of the Florence Coal Coke &amp; Iron Co., of the Florence Tuscaloosa &amp; RR Co., of the Tennessee and Alabama RR Co., the Alabama, Florence &amp; Cincinnati RR Co., the Florence &amp; St. Louis RR Co., in all of which he is of the several board of directors.

==Personal life==
He was married at Nashville, Tennessee, October 21, 1856, to Miss Amanda Morgan, the accomplished daughter of Samuel Dold Morgan, whose body lies in the Tennessee Capitol building, by order of the Tennessee Legislature.

<doc id="408979" wikidata="Q1855840" url="?curid=408979" title="Xavier Becerra">
<text>Xavier Becerra ( , ; born January 26, 1958) is an American attorney and politician who served as the 25th United States secretary of health and human services, a position he held from March 19, 2021 to January 20, 2025. He is the first Latino to hold the position. Becerra previously served as the attorney general of California from January 2017 until March 2021. He was a member of the United States House of Representatives, representing downtown Los Angeles in Congress from 1993 to 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, Becerra was Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus from 2013 to 2017.

Born in Sacramento, California, Becerra graduated from Stanford University and received his Juris Doctor degree from Stanford Law School. He worked as a lawyer at the Legal Assistance Corporation of central Massachusetts, before returning to California in 1986 to work as an administrative assistant for state senator Art Torres. He served as a deputy attorney general in the California Department of Justice from 1987 to 1990 before he was elected to the California State Assembly, where he served one term from 1990 to 1992.

Becerra was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1992. He represented California&#x27;s 30th congressional district from 1993 to 2003, California&#x27;s 31st congressional district from 2003 to 2013, and California&#x27;s 34th congressional district from 2013 to 2017. He served as Chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus from 1997 to 1999, Vice Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus from 2009 to 2013, and as a member of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. He was elected Chairman of the U.S. House Democratic Caucus from 2013 to 2017.

==Early life and education==
Born in Sacramento, California, on January 26, 1958, Becerra is the son of working-class parents, Maria Teresa and Manuel Guerrero Becerra. His father was born in the U.S. and raised in Tijuana, Mexico, and his mother was from Guadalajara. As a child, Becerra grew up in a one-room apartment with his three sisters. He graduated in 1976 from C.K. McClatchy High School, located in the center of Sacramento. He studied abroad at the University of Salamanca in Salamanca, Spain, from 1978 to 1979, before earning his Bachelor of Arts in economics from Stanford University in 1980, becoming the first person in his family to graduate from college. He received his Juris Doctor from Stanford Law School in 1984, and was admitted to the State Bar of California in 1985.

== Early career ==
Becerra began his career as an attorney, working on cases involving individuals who had mental disorders for the Legal Assistance Corporation of Central Massachusetts (now Community Legal Aid).

Becerra returned to California, and in 1986, became an administrative assistant for Democratic State Senator Art Torres of Los Angeles. He served as a deputy attorney general in the California Department of Justice under Attorney General John Van de Kamp from 1987 to 1990.

After incumbent state assemblyman Charles Calderon decided to seek a seat in the California Senate, Becerra launched a grass-roots campaign for the California State Assembly, defeating Calderon&#x27;s Senate aide Marta Maestas in the Democratic primary. He went on to defeat Republican Lee Lieberg and Libertarian Steven Pencall, receiving 60% of the vote. Becerra served one term in the State Assembly, representing California&#x27;s 59th district, from 1990 to 1992. As a state legislator, Becerra worked to pass a law that would increase gang members&#x27; sentences.

==U.S. House of Representatives (1993–2017)==
===Elections===
In 1992, 25th district congressman Edward Roybal announced his retirement after 30 years in Congress. Becerra entered the race for the seat, which had been renumbered as the 30th district after redistricting. Becerra won the Democratic primary with a plurality of 32% of the vote. In the general election, he defeated Republican nominee Morry Waksberg, 58%–24%. He won re-election to a second term in 1994 with 66% of the vote. His district was renumbered as the 31st district after the 2000 census.

After redistricting, ahead of the 2012 elections, most of Becerra&#x27;s old district became the 34th district. He defeated Republican Stephen Smith 85.6% to 14.4%.

===Tenure===
Becerra was a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, of which he served as chairman during the 105th Congress.

Becerra voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 because he &quot;wanted to see direct protections for responsible homeowners&quot; in the bill.

Becerra was appointed assistant to the speaker of the House for the 110th Congress. He won his bid to succeed John Larson as Vice-Chair in the 111th Congress, defeating Marcy Kaptur of Ohio by a vote of 175–67.

Becerra successfully ran for a second term as Vice-Chair in 2011 to serve during the 112th Congress.

During the 111th Congress and 112th Congress, Becerra served on several high-profile committees. He was appointed to serve on the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (often called Bowles-Simpson/Simpson-Bowles) on March 24, 2010. Becerra was selected to serve on the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (also known as the Super Committee) on August 11, 2011. And on December 23, 2011, he was appointed to serve on a bi-cameral conference committee to find bi-partisan solutions on middle-class tax cuts, unemployment insurance, and the Medicare physician payment rate.

Becerra had a seat on the House Ways and Means Committee and was the first Latino to serve on the committee.

====Abortion rights and pay equity====
A writer for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; described Becerra as a &quot;strident supporter of women&#x27;s health and reproductive rights&quot;; &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that he has been &quot;vocal in the Democratic Party about fighting for women&#x27;s health&quot;. He voted against H.R. 3541, the Prenatal Non-Discrimination Act (PRENDA), which would have imposed civil and criminal penalties on anyone knowingly attempting to perform a sex-selective abortion. The 2012 bill also would have required health care providers to report known or suspected violations to law enforcement, including suspicions about a woman&#x27;s motives for seeking an abortion. Becerra received a 100% rating from Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America in 2012. Becerra voted for the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009.

Becerra argued before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic religious order, should be required to provide birth control services under the Affordable Care Act. In late 2020, arguing that the prosecution would discourage pregnant women from obtaining addiction treatment, Becerra requested that the Supreme Court of California block the murder prosecution of a woman who had consumed methamphetamine during her pregnancy, resulting in a stillbirth. The court declined to do so. In response to the Trump administration&#x27;s 2020 decision to restrict federal funding to California because it requires insurance providers to cover abortion, Becerra stated that &quot;California has the sovereign right to protect women&#x27;s reproductive rights&quot;.

==Other political ambitions==

===2001 Los Angeles mayoral election===

Becerra ran for mayor of Los Angeles in 2001. He finished with 6% of the primary vote, finishing behind businessman Steve Soboroff, Councilman Joel Wachs, former California State Assembly speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, and the eventual winner, then-city attorney James Hahn.

===Consideration for federal government positions===
In 2008, Becerra was considered for the position of U.S. trade representative in the administration of President-elect Obama. While it was reported that he had already accepted, he announced on December 15 that he would not accept the position. Becerra had endorsed then-Senator Barack Obama for president on January 27, 2008.

Becerra was on the shortlist of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for the vice presidential nomination in 2016. Senator Tim Kaine was eventually chosen.

During the presidential transition of Joe Biden in 2020, it was reported that Becerra was being considered for the Cabinet positions of secretary of homeland security and attorney general.

===2020 U.S. Senate speculation===
In August 2020, California senator Kamala Harris was selected by presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate. After Biden ultimately won the general election, Becerra was floated as a possible replacement for Harris, along with others such as Representative Karen Bass, Representative Barbara Lee, Secretary of State Alex Padilla (who was eventually chosen), and former Secretary of Labor Hilda Solís. Early December reports that Biden planned to nominate Becerra as Secretary of Health and Human Services rendered such speculation moot.

===2026 California governor speculation===

In the 2026 California gubernatorial election, incumbent governor Gavin Newsom will be ineligible to run for reelection due to term limits. In February 2024, Politico reported that Becerra was considering a run for governor, and that he or affiliated individuals had approached a political consulting firm to that effect, a potential violation of the Hatch Act. Becerra&#x27;s tenure as Secretary of Health and Human Services was described as &quot;frustrating and at times rocky&quot; by the Politico article and in a previous interview Becerra said that he missed being California attorney general because of the autonomy of the position. 

==California Attorney General (2017–2021)==

Becerra accepted Governor Jerry Brown&#x27;s offer to be the attorney general of California on December 1, 2016. The California Legislature confirmed Becerra to the post on January 23, 2017. He succeeded Kamala Harris, who was elected to the United States Senate. Becerra was sworn in on January 24, 2017, becoming the first Latino to serve as California&#x27;s attorney general. Becerra was elected to a full four-year term in 2018, after defeating Republican challenger Steven Bailey and securing 61 percent of the vote.

While Attorney General, Becerra was challenged the policymaking by President Trump that would disproportionately impact California, home to one in ten Americans. He delivered the Democratic Spanish-language response to President Trump&#x27;s 2019 State of the Union address.

During his tenure as California attorney general, Xavier Becerra filed 122 lawsuits against the Trump administration, focusing on environmental and healthcare issues. Notably, he successfully defended significant national policies such as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) before the United States Supreme Court.

=== California Department of Justice reforms ===

==== Bureau of Environmental Justice ====
In 2018, Becerra created an environmental justice bureau at the California Department of Justice. Among other legal actions, it opposed the effort to expand San Bernardino International Airport due to concerns regarding air pollution, intervened to halt a proposed waterfront cement plant in Vallejo, citing significant concerns over increased air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and supported the City of Arvin&#x27;s oil and gas ordinance, endorsing a 300-foot buffer for homes, schools, and hospitals, and confirming that such local ordinances are not preempted by state law. The bureau also intervened in a lawsuit against the city of Fresno in 2018, leading to the city rescinding its approval of a large industrial warehouse project due to inadequate environmental review. By focusing on disparities such as the prevalence of polluting facilities near low-income neighborhoods and communities of color, the bureau&#x27;s work has significantly addressed environmental justice concerns.

=== Protection of Natural Resources ===

==== Shasta Dam injunction and environmental impact ====
On July 31, 2019, Becerra achieved a significant legal victory when a Superior Court issued a preliminary injunction to stop Westlands Water District&#x27;s involvement in a project to raise the Shasta Dam. Becerra&#x27;s lawsuit argued that the project contravened the California Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, threatening the McCloud River&#x27;s ecology. Federal studies revealed that raising the dam would expand the inundation of the river by 39%, adversely affecting its fisheries, habitats, and submerging sacred sites of the Winnemem Wintu Tribe.

==== Legal action against Tijuana River pollution ====
In September 2018, Becerra filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission. This action was in response to over 12 million gallons of untreated wastewater from the Tijuana River Watershed flowing into California, violating the Clean Water Act. The untreated wastewater, containing hazardous levels of pesticides, heavy metals, and bacteria, posed a significant threat to human health and the environment.

==== Protection of Redwood City Salt Ponds ====
In October 2020, Becerra achieved a significant legal victory in protecting the Redwood City Salt Ponds, vital to the San Francisco Bay&#x27;s ecosystem. The U.S. District Court&#x27;s ruling against the EPA&#x27;s exclusion of the Salt Ponds from the Clean Water Act safeguards these areas from urban development. Additionally, efforts to restore the Salt Ponds as salt marshes and wetlands have been instrumental in enhancing the Bay&#x27;s ecological health and bolstering climate change resilience, particularly against sea level rise.

==== Protection of endangered species in Sacramento and San Joaquin River ====
In February 2020, Becerra, exercising his independent authority as defined in the California Constitution (art. V, § 13) and Government Code (§§ 12660–12612), filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration on behalf of the People of the State of California. The legal challenge focused on the federal government&#x27;s inadequacy in protecting endangered species in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. It specifically scrutinized the biological opinions provided under the Endangered Species Act in relation to federal water export operations, emphasizing their insufficient protection of vulnerable species and habitats in the Bay-Delta area. On May 11, 2020, Becerra secured a preliminary injunction in this lawsuit against the Trump Administration for unlawfully expanding water export operations in the Central Valley.

=== Criminal law enforcement ===

==== Arrest of La Luz Del Mundo leader in major sex trafficking case ====
On June 4, 2019, Becerra announced the arrest of Naasón Joaquín García, the leader of the international religious organization La Luz Del Mundo, along with several co-defendants. The defendants were charged with serious offenses including human trafficking, production of child pornography, and forcible rape of a minor. The alleged crimes occurred between 2015 and 2018 and involved coercing victims into sexual acts under the guise of religious authority. The criminal complaint filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court accused García and his associates, Alondra Ocampo, Azalea Rangel Melendez (who remains at large), and Susana Medina Oaxaca, of committing 26 felonies in Southern California. With this arrest, Becerra emphasized the commitment of the California Department of Justice to combat human trafficking and protect the rights of survivors. The arrests were part of a collaborative effort involving multiple law enforcement agencies and were initiated by a tip received through the clergy abuse online complaint form of the California Department of Justice. On June 8, 2022, Naasón Joaquín García was sentenced to more than 16 years in a California prison.

==== Operation Blocc Buster: Takedown of Casa Blanca Gangster Crips ====
On January 17, 2020, Becerra and Riverside Police chief Larry Gonzalez announced the successful execution of &quot;Operation Blocc Buster,&quot; targeting the Casa Blanca Gangster Crips street gang in Riverside. This operation led to the arrest of 15 individuals and the seizure of 14 firearms, including assault weapons, along with methamphetamine and cocaine. The Casa Blanca Gangster Crips, known for violent crimes such as murder, assault, and narcotics trafficking, have been a significant concern in the south Riverside community.

This operation is part of a broader initiative under Becerra&#x27;s leadership, where the California Department of Justice actively collaborates with local and federal agencies to dismantle various criminal street gangs across California, enhancing public safety and addressing gang-related violence and crime. This comprehensive anti-gang initiative has led to hundreds of arrests, significantly disrupting various criminal street gangs. Key operations under this initiative include a May 2017 crackdown on the Sureño gang and its connections to the Mexican Mafia in Merced County, and a June 2017 operation against the Sureño gang in San Bernardino County. In November 2017, efforts focused on members of the Mexican mafia and drug cartels across Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Orange Counties. December 2017 saw the takedown of gangs including the MOB, Flyboys, East Coast Crips, and others in Stockton.

Further operations throughout 2018 and 2019 maintained this momentum. In August 2018, an operation targeted the MS-13 gang in the Central Valley and beyond. October 2018 featured a major operation dismantling Riverside County&#x27;s largest criminal street gang. The following year, multiple operations were directed against Norteño street gangs in Kings, Tulare, and Stanislaus Counties, as well as in Stockton. In December 2019, the Country Boy Crips in south Bakersfield were the focus of a significant operation. These targeted actions reflect the Becerra&#x27;s ongoing dedication to curbing gang-related violence and crime, ensuring safer communities across California.

==== Statewide organized crime ring charged with sex trafficking in California ====
On September 13, 2019, Becerra of California announced the filing of charges against Jing Chiang Huang, Shu Mei Lin, Shao Lee, Peihsin Lee, Pengcheng Cai, and Dafeng Wen for their alleged involvement in a statewide organized crime ring engaged in sex trafficking, tax fraud, and money laundering. This legal action, the product of a collaborative effort between the California Department of Justice, the Ventura County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, and several other law enforcement partners, asserts that from 2015 to 2019, the defendants committed 13 felonies related to sex trafficking. The criminal complaint suggests that the accused used Backpage.com for their operations and forcibly coerced individuals into prostitution at various brothel locations, employing tactics like withholding passports and threatening job opportunities to maintain control over their victims. The announcement of these charges underlines Attorney Becerra&#x27;s ongoing commitment to eradicating sex trafficking and protecting the rights of survivors in California. Five suspects were sentenced in March 2022.

==== Additional criminal law enforcement ====
Becerra brought fourteen felony charges against Center for Medical Progress activists for recording fourteen videos (see Planned Parenthood 2015 undercover videos controversy), and one felony charge for conspiring to invade privacy, on March 28, 2017. The charges were dismissed by a California Superior Court judge in June for not stating the names of those recorded and the specific dates of the recordings; the charges were refiled with the names and dates in July 2017.

In 2019, Becerra threatened &quot;legal action&quot; against reporters who had received records of California law enforcement officers who had been convicted of crimes during the past decade.

In December 2020, Becerra was faulted by state district attorneys for not taking leadership to help stop unemployment fraud during the COVID-19 pandemic, in what was described as the &quot;biggest taxpayer fraud in California history&quot;. In January 2021, investigators said the total fraud was over $11 billion, with $19 billion in claims still under investigation. Most of this money will likely never be recovered, prosecutors said.

=== Lawsuits against Trump administration ===
==== Defense of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) ====
In addition to his numerous legal challenges against the Trump administration, a significant aspect of Xavier Becerra&#x27;s tenure as California Attorney General was his defense of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy before the United States Supreme Court. This defense was crucial for the approximately 650,000 Dreamers across the United States, with more than a quarter of them residing in California. In June 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court delivered a ruling that upheld the DACA policy, marking a significant victory for these Dreamers. The California Department of Justice, under Becerra&#x27;s leadership, played a pivotal role in this outcome. In November 2019, Becerra led a coalition of 21 attorneys general to defend DACA against the Trump Administration&#x27;s attempt to terminate it. The Court found that the administration&#x27;s actions to end DACA were unlawful.

==== Defense of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) ====
As the Attorney General of California, Becerra led the multistate lawsuit to defend, and ultimately save, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), culminating in the significant Supreme Court ruling in California v. Texas on June 17, 2021. In this capacity, he led the legal challenge against efforts to dismantle the ACA, emphasizing the Act&#x27;s critical importance in providing healthcare to millions of Americans, especially those with pre-existing conditions. Becerra&#x27;s staunch defense of the ACA at the Supreme Court highlighted his commitment to ensuring accessible healthcare for all. His efforts were pivotal in upholding the ACA, a decision that affirmed the continuation of essential health protections and services across the United States.

==== Additional federal litigation ====
In February 2019, Becerra, Governor Gavin Newsom, and 15 other states filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the president&#x27;s declaration of a national emergency to fund a wall at the southern U.S. border. As of September 26, 2019, Becerra had sued the Trump administration 62 times in total.

The Trump administration opened 1 million acres in California to fracking and drilling in December 2019. Under the new policy, the Bureau of Land Management proposed new lease sales for oil and gas extraction along &quot;California&#x27;s Central Valley and Central Coast, touching eight counties and including 400,000 acres of public land&quot;. California officials and agencies, including Becerra, filed a lawsuit against the Bureau of Land Management in January 2020.

Despite the multiple lawsuits against the Trump administration filed with other state attorneys general, Becerra had not joined antitrust efforts against any major tech companies. His office would not disclose whether it had examined any tech companies and had not endorsed any joint investigations with other states. On December 9, 2020, it was reported that Becerra&#x27;s office had joined 47 other states and the Federal Trade Commission in an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook, Inc, headquartered in California.

=== Ballot drafting ===
As Attorney General of California, Becerra was tasked with writing ballot titles and summaries that appeared on voter information guides and ballots in both the 2018 and 2020 elections. Proponents accused Becerra multiple times of writing biased descriptions that violated the law, which requires &quot;a true and impartial statement of the purpose&quot; of measures. In one of many unsuccessful lawsuits against Becerra, a state judge wrote that attorneys general have &quot;wide latitude&quot; in how they write ballot descriptions. Critics said the responsibility to write the ballot title and summary should be transferred to a different, non-partisan office.

==Secretary of Health and Human Services (2021–2025)==

=== Nomination and confirmation ===
After Joe Biden&#x27;s election as president in November 2020, Becerra was considered a candidate for United States attorney general. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported in early December 2020 that Biden would nominate Becerra as Secretary of Health and Human Services. His nomination to lead the Health and Human Services Department has been criticized by pro-life and conservative leaders led by Students for Life of America, citing his &quot;absence of health care experience and his disregard for people of faith&quot;. Becerra&#x27;s nomination was deadlocked by the Senate&#x27;s Finance Committee on March 10, 2021. One day later, on March 11, 2021, Becerra&#x27;s nomination was discharged from the Finance Committee by the entire Senate, in a vote of 51–48. He was confirmed by the Senate in a vote of 50–49 on March 18, 2021, with all but one Democrat present and one Republican, Susan Collins, voting in favor. This was the narrowest vote for any of Biden&#x27;s cabinet positions. On March 22, 2021, Becerra was sworn in to be the new secretary.

=== Tenure ===

Soon after officially becoming the secretary of health and human services, Becerra released a statement praising the Affordable Care Act and encouraging people to keep enrolling in its health care program. Becerra also became Secretary during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, of which his cabinet department the U.S. Health and Human Services was mainly responsible for mitigating the pandemic&#x27;s effects to the American public.

Becerra is credited for his critical efforts to preserve reproductive rights across the country, to expand Medicaid and CHIP postpartum coverage for more than half the states in the nation and slashing disparities in access to public health tools—particularly amid the COVID-19 pandemic. He has consistently cited curbing health care costs, advancing women&#x27;s health, and tackling gaps in who has access to health care as big priorities—along with protecting public health.

==== Medicare Drug Price Negotiations ====
Becerra was instrumental in implementing Medicare drug price negotiations under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This landmark initiative aims to reduce prescription drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries by allowing direct price negotiations for high-cost medications.

In 2023, Becerra and HHS finalized negotiations for 10 high-cost drugs, including Eliquis, Jardiance, and Xarelto, achieving discounts of 38% to 79%. These lower prices, effective in 2026, would have saved Medicare $6 billion in 2023 alone. Building on this success, Becerra announced 15 additional drugs for negotiation in 2025, with reduced prices set to take effect in 2027. These medications, including Ozempic, Ibrance, and Vraylar, account for $41 billion in annual Medicare Part D spending and treat conditions such as cancer, diabetes, and asthma.

==== Additional Matters ====
Becerra has overseen one of the biggest reform efforts of sub-agencies in HHS&#x27;s history, including at the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Becerra has been criticized as health and human services secretary for being absent in the public eye during the pandemic, for confusing messaging by federal public health authorities and for the subsequent loss of public trust, and for his collaborative management style while serving as secretary; his defenders said he was given an unclear role as secretary. Becerra was similarly criticized following his agency&#x27;s response to the 2022 monkeypox outbreak amid issues with health policy communication and what was widely considered a slow response; White House officials said that Becerra sought to scapegoat the states rather than take responsibility for the subpar response.

On October 6, 2022, Becerra was tasked by President Biden with expeditiously reviewing the Schedule I classification of Cannabis.

In 2023, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published investigations regarding immigrant child laborers who are working in violation of child labor laws across the U.S. According to the Times&#x27; reports, &quot;Again and again, veteran government staffers and outside contractors told the Health and Human Services Department, including in reports that reached Secretary Xavier Becerra, that children appeared to be at risk&quot;. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for the welfare of these children.

==Personal life==
Becerra is married to physician Carolina Reyes, and they have three daughters. He is a member of the Inter-American Dialogue think tank, based in Washington, D.C. Becerra is Roman Catholic.

<text>Joseph Washington &quot;Jellybean&quot; Bryant (October 19, 1954 – July 15, 2024) was an American professional basketball player and coach. He played for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers, and Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He also played for several teams in Italy and one in France. Bryant was the head coach of the WNBA&#x27;s Los Angeles Sparks from 2005 to 2007 and returned to that position for the remainder of the 2011 WNBA season. Bryant also coached in Japan and Thailand. His son, basketball player Kobe Bryant, was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame.

== Professional career ==

=== Philadelphia 76ers (1975–1979) ===
After starring at La Salle University, he was drafted by the Golden State Warriors but traded to his hometown team, the Philadelphia 76ers, where he played for four seasons. In his second season, on the 1976–77 76ers, he played alongside NBA all-stars Julius Erving, Doug Collins, and George McGinnis. The team reached the 1977 NBA Finals, eventually losing to the Portland Trail Blazers, 4 games to 2.

=== San Diego Clippers (1979–1982) ===
Before the 1979–1980 season, the Sixers traded Bryant to the San Diego Clippers, where he spent three seasons. In the first game of the 1979–1980 season, played at home against the Los Angeles Lakers, Bryant memorably had a slam dunk over center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

=== Houston Rockets (1982–1983)===
Following the 1981 season, Bryant was traded to the Houston Rockets, where he played one season, his last in the NBA.

===Europe (1983–1992)===
Bryant played overseas in Italy and France from 1982 to 1992, playing for Italian teams Sebastiani Rieti, Standa Reggio Calabria, Olimpia Pistoia, and Reggiana and French team Mulhouse. He ended his playing career in 1992.

== Coaching career ==

=== Akiba Hebrew Academy (1992–1993) ===
Bryant&#x27;s first coaching position, after returning from Europe, was when he was deployed with the U.S. Armed Forces in Italy. In the 1992–1993 season, he served as the head coach of the women&#x27;s varsity team at Akiba Hebrew Academy in Lower Merion, Pennsylvania.

=== La Salle Explorers (1993–1996) ===
In June 1993, he left Akiba and accepted an assistant coach position at his alma mater, La Salle University. On May 7, 1996, Bryant resigned from La Salle after his son Kobe announced his intentions to enter the NBA out of high school.

=== SlamBall and ABA coach (2003–2005) ===
Bryant served as coach for the Diablos during the 2003 season of SlamBall.

From 2003 to 2005, Bryant also coached two ABA teams, the Las Vegas Rattlers and the Boston Frenzy.

=== Los Angeles Sparks (2005–2007, 2011) ===
On August 17, 2005, Bryant, who was an assistant coach for the WNBA team Los Angeles Sparks, was named the head coach, succeeding previous coach (and former 76ers teammate) Henry Bibby. During the 2006 season, he led the Sparks to a 25–9 record and a Conference Finals berth. In April 2007, Bryant was replaced as Sparks head coach by Michael Cooper, who had previously helmed the team in 1999–2004.

In 2011, Bryant returned to the Sparks, first as an assistant coach, but later as the head coach for the rest of the 2011 season.

=== International coaching career (2007–2015) ===
Bryant coached the Tokyo Apache of the Japanese bj league from 2007 to 2009.

On July 3, 2009, Bryant signed a contract with Italian club Sebastiani Rieti, whom he had played for. However, the contract fell through, due to the team&#x27;s move to Naples.

Bryant served as the head coach of Japanese professional basketball team Levanga Hokkaido during the 2010–2011 JBL season.

In January 2012, Bryant was hired as coach of the Bangkok Cobras in the ASEAN Basketball League (ABL). He coached for the 2012 season. Bryant also coached for the Chang Thailand Slammers in 2013.

Bryant coached Rizing Fukuoka of the bj League from 2014 to 2015.

<doc id="408985" wikidata="Q589563" url="?curid=408985" title="Forfar Athletic F.C.">
<text>Forfar Athletic Football Club are a Scottish semi-professional football club from the town of Forfar, Angus. They are members of the Scottish Professional Football League and currently play in Scottish League Two. They play their home games at Station Park, in the north end of Forfar.

The club are nicknamed &quot;the Loons&quot; (&#x27;loon&#x27; is a Northern Scots word for a young man), although they are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Sky Blues&quot;, which along with navy blue is one of the club colours. One explanation for the origins of the Loons&#x27; moniker is that the second string were younger than the first team, so over time people would say &quot;I&#x27;m off to watch the Loons&quot;.

Forfar share many local rivals in Angus, including Arbroath, Brechin City and Montrose, as well as the larger clubs of Dundee, Dundee United, St Johnstone and Aberdeen in the wider east of Scotland region. As well as taking part in the Scottish Professional Football League, the club also participate in the Scottish Cup, the League Cup, the Challenge Cup and the Forfarshire Cup every season.

==History==

===Origins===
The club was founded in 1885 when the second team of the older Forfar club, Angus F.C. broke away to form Forfar Athletic. Angus FC had been the town&#x27;s senior club for a number of years, and on 24 September 1883, amalgamated with the Junior club Forfar West End, which became the 2nd XI, taking the name Angus Athletic. 

The success of Angus Athletic in junior cup competitions and against other senior sides prompted the second string to go it alone, and in May 1885 it started playing as Forfar Athletic. Forfar played its first match on 16 May 1885 when it defeated Dundee Our Boys 1–0. 

The new club originally played in a strip of black and white one-inch hooped jerseys with blue knickers, changing to blue and black vertical stripes (imitating the old Angus colours) in 1889. The key match shifting the balance of power was a 3–1 win over Angus in the first round of the 1885–86 Scottish Cup; Angus was dissolved shortly afterwards.

On 1 September 1888 the club recorded their record win when they defeated Lindertis, a side from nearby Kirriemuir, 14–1.

===Into the League===
The club were admitted into the Scottish Football League in the 1921–22 season, entering the new Second Division, finishing 14th out of 20 teams in their first season. In the 1923–24 season a third division was established, Forfar were relegated into that division in the 1924–25 season by finishing bottom of Division Two. The club were lucky; 12 of the 16 teams in that division were relegated as the division was to be scrapped the following season; Forfar however managed to gain promotion. National competitions were suspended with the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. In this period Alex Troup was a key player for the club – he went on to play for Dundee and Everton. The club&#x27;s biggest defeat also came in this period, on 2 January 1930, when they lost 2–12 to King&#x27;s Park.

===Post-war highs and lows===
When the league resumed in the 1946–47 season Forfar found themselves in the C Division (a reconstituted Third Division) of the league. Promotion to the B Division was won in the 1948–49 season and the club remained in the B division and its successor Second Division until finally winning the divisional championship in the 1983–84 under manager Doug Houston. This was considerable progress from the 1973–74 season when the club finished bottom of the division. The late 1970s and the 1980s can probably be considered the club&#x27;s most successful period – at the end of the 1985–86 season the club were just one point below promotion to the Premier Division.

This era also saw a succession of good cup runs, meeting Rangers in the League Cup semi-finals in 1977–78 (losing 5–2 after extra time) and again in the Scottish Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park in the 1981–82 competition, forcing a 0–0 draw in the first game and earning a replay which ended 3–1 to Rangers. In the 1986–87 Scottish Cup the club came within a few seconds of knocking Dundee United, then flying high after beating FC Barcelona at the Nou Camp, out of the cup in the quarter-finals, but United scored to gain a replay, which they subsequently won.

Various kit colours were used throughout this period. In the 1950s and early 1960s, a green home strip was used. Later the team adopted lighter blue with varying navy. The nickname &quot;The Sky Blues&quot; was introduced in the 1982–83 season to aid marketing, however it sometimes became confused with the nickname of English club Coventry City. The nickname was dropped by the club during the early 1990s, It is however still sometimes used by the media.

===Hegarty, Campbell &amp; McPhee (1990–2000)===
The club continued in the First Division until 1991–92, when they finished bottom under the management of Paul Hegarty. The side won just five matches and lost twenty seven. Following a demonstration outside the main stand at Station Park, Hegarty was summarily dismissed, to be replaced by Tommy Campbell. The Loons remained in the Second Division until the close season of 1994, when league reorganisation saw the Loons find themselves in the new Third Division.

A successful campaign saw the club win the inaugural Third Division Championship with a 1–0 win at Ross County on 15 April 1995, Bobby Mann netting the goal. Despite a promising start to the 1995–96 season, Forfar were relegated back to the Third Division under the continued management of Campbell and the captaincy of Ian McPhee. In late 1996, McPhee took over as player-manager following the departure of Campbell to neighbours Arbroath, taking his side on an impressive run of results that saw them achieve promotion on goal difference ahead of Ross County.

Forfar survived a season in the Second Division, but were again relegated back to the Third Division at the end of the 1998–99 season. The club were promoted again the following season, finishing in third place as a minor league reconstruction took place, however McPhee resigned as manager in November 2000 following a poor start to the 2000–01 season, stating &quot;I have put the club before myself – I could have been selfish, but Forfar football club is more important than Ian McPhee.&quot;

===Neil Cooper (2000–2003)===
McPhee was replaced by Neil Cooper, who led Forfar to Second Division safety by the end of the 2000–01 Second Division season, sending Queen&#x27;s Park down on goal difference.

Cooper&#x27;s only full season in charge, 2001–02, saw Forfar finish third in the Second Division. The Loons also reached the quarter-finals of the Scottish Cup, where they faced Rangers at Station Park. The match was televised live by BBC Scotland, and although the Loons lost 6–0, the club received a considerable cash bonus as a result of the tie.

Cooper remained manager until January 2003 when he moved back to become head youth coach for his former club Aberdeen, leaving the Loons in a strong league position.

===Ray Stewart (2003–2004)===
Between January 2003 and November 2004 The club were managed by former West Ham United and Dundee United full back Ray Stewart who had previously managerial experience with Livingston and Stirling Albion. Stewart guided Forfar to a penalty shootout win over Motherwell in the Third Round of the League Cup in October 2003, leading to another lucrative tie with Rangers at Ibrox which again finished 6–0 to Rangers. Stewart became increasingly unpopular with the fans towards the end of the 2003–04 season following a string of poor results, which left the Loons rooted in mid-table.

The 2004–05 season started with four straight wins and a 5–2 win away to St Mirren in the League Cup, leading to a tie with Dundee at Dens Park ending 4–0 to Dundee. A good run was also achieved in the Challenge Cup when the club beat Greenock Morton, Queen&#x27;s Park and Clyde to reach the semi-finals only to be knocked out by Ross County in a 5–2 defeat. Unfortunately the club&#x27;s performance in the league again declined and Stewart offered his resignation, following a 5–1 home defeat to Montrose in the Scottish Cup First Round – an offer which was accepted by the Forfar board.

===Brian Fairley (2004–2005)===
With Forfar floundering in the league, the board moved to appoint then Dumbarton manager Brian Fairley as Station Park boss, Fairley resigning from his post as Dumbarton manager earlier in the day. Fairley was to lead the club to mid-table safety by season end, cumulating in a 3–0 victory over champions Brechin City. Fairley resigned from his post in September 2005, citing the pressures of full-time work away from football.

===Ray Farningham (2005–2006)===
The club brought in former player Ray Farningham as manager, with another former player, George Shaw, appointed assistant manager. Despite some erratic performances, the Loons again secured 2nd Division status by season end – a season that included two victories over champions Gretna. After the season ended Ray Farningham moved to Gretna as chief scout.

===George Shaw (2006–2007)===
George Shaw was promoted to the position of manager, with long serving striker Paul Tosh stepping up to player-assistant manager. On 19 March 2007 Forfar Athletic parted company with Shaw after ten months in charge. Paul Tosh left shortly after, going on loan to Arbroath until the end of the 2007–08 season. This was following a spell that saw the Loons rooted to the foot of the Second Division, and having failed to progress in any of the season&#x27;s cup competitions.

===Jim Moffat (2007–2008)===
Following Shaw&#x27;s departure the club appointed former player and reserve team coach Jim Moffat as manager. A former manager of East Fife, Moffat&#x27;s first game in charge was a 9–1 defeat to Greenock Morton on 7 April 2007, which saw Forfar relegated to the Third Division. The following season did not go well, and Moffat was sacked on 21 April 2008, with Forfar going on to finish bottom of the Third Division. Dick Campbell became Forfar&#x27;s new manager on 8 May 2008.

===Dick Campbell (2008–2015)===
Dick Campbell became Forfar&#x27;s manager on 8 May 2008 on a two-year deal, after Jim Moffat failed to improve the team&#x27;s fortunes. Campbell&#x27;s first season in charge of Forfar was full of highs and lows. The start of the season was a mixed affair with Forfar being unbeaten away from home but found lacking when playing at Station Park. With a dreadful winter and numerous games called off the months of March and April were for catch up and Dick was very close to leading the team into the play-offs for the Irn-Bru Second Division. During his first season at Station Park Dick cut the wage bill and due to good cup success took Forfar Athletic out of the red and into the black. On 13 December 2009 Campbell became embroiled in controversy regarding sectarian singing. On 16 May 2010 Dick and Ian Campbell got Forfar promoted to the second division through the playoffs with a 2–0 victory against local rivals Arbroath. On 14 May 2011, Forfar failed to reach the play-off final for First Division status, losing out to Ayr United, by an aggregate score of 7–4. The team also qualified for the play-offs at the end of the 2012–13 season. In the first leg against Dunfermline Athletic, they scored three times in the first half, eventually winning 3–1. In the second leg, however, poor discipline led to three of their players being sent off. Despite taking an early lead, they lost the match 3–1. In extra time, the eight men struggled against their full-time opponents, and Dunfermline eventually won 6–1, to go through 7–4 on aggregate.

On 3 August 2013, Forfar claimed arguably the biggest result in their history when they defeated Rangers 2–1 at Station Park in the first round of the 2013–14 Scottish League Cup, with both goals coming from Gavin Swankie.

In 2014–15 season Campbell almost led Forfar to their best achievement in modern times, a League One title, but missed out to Morton and lost a 3–1 lead to Alloa in the play-off final. After seven years in charge of the side, Campbell was sacked in December 2015, following a 1–0 defeat to Cowdenbeath left them third bottom of League One. Assistant manager Stewart Petrie was named caretaker manager.

===Gary Bollan (2015–2017)===
A week after Campbell was sacked, The Loons appointed former Airdrieonians manager Gary Bollan as his successor. Forfar had a disastrous season and finished bottom of League One, which meant automatic relegation to League Two. A swift return seemed to be on the cards with the team holding first place for virtually all season, only to collapse at the end and finish 2nd behind Arbroath. They had a second chance to be promoted via the play-offs, however, and they made the most of it, beating Annan Athletic and Peterhead to return to League One.

===Jim Weir (2017–2019)===
On 1 October 2017, Forfar appointed former Elgin City manager Jim Weir as Bollan’s successor.

Weir was involved in a car crash after a training session in September 2019. He left the club on 3 November, as he struggled to combine his work commitments and recovery from the car crash.

===Stuart Malcolm (2019–2021)===
On 10 November 2019, former Loons player Stuart Malcolm returned to Forfar Athletic as manager after being announced as Jim Weir&#x27;s replacement.

Former club captain Malcolm had three spells with the north-east side as a central defender and most recently had been manager of Lowland League side East Kilbride, leading them to the league title the previous April.

===Gary Irvine (2021–2022)===
Gary Irvine joined Forfar in February 2019 until the end of the season. On 9 April 2021, Irvine agreed to take charge of the &quot;Loons&quot; after manager Stuart Malcolm and his assistants resigned from their positions. Irvine was announced as the club&#x27;s new manager on 4 May. Despite coming close to promotion in the 2021–22 season, a very disappointing start to the following season which left the &quot;Loons&quot; bottom of the table led to Forfar releasing Irvine on 9 November 2022.

===Ray McKinnon (2022–2024)===
On 10 November 2022, Forfar Athletic confirmed the appointment of Ray McKinnon as the club’s new manager on a rolling contract until May 2025. McKinnon was sacked on 9 November 2024 with the club bottom of the SPFL. Jim Weir, previously in charge from 2017–2019, returned as manager 11 days later.

<text>Hilda Lucia Solis (; born October 20, 1957) is an American politician and a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors for the 1st district. Solis previously served as the 25th United States Secretary of Labor from 2009 to 2013, as part of the administration of President Barack Obama. She is a member of the Democratic Party and served in the United States House of Representatives from 2001 to 2009, representing the 31st and 32nd congressional districts of California that include East Los Angeles and the San Gabriel Valley.

Solis was raised in La Puente, California, by immigrant parents from Nicaragua and Mexico. She earned degrees from the California State Polytechnic University, Pomona and the University of Southern California and worked for two federal agencies in Washington, D.C. Returning to her native state, she was elected to the Rio Hondo Community College Board of Trustees in 1985, the California State Assembly in 1992, and the California State Senate in 1994. She was the first Hispanic woman to serve in the State Senate, and was reelected there in 1998. Solis sought to pass environmental justice legislation. She was the first female recipient of the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award in 2000.

Solis defeated a long-time Democratic incumbent as part of getting elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000, where she focused mainly on labor causes and environmental work. She was reelected easily to four subsequent terms. In December 2008, President-elect Barack Obama announced his intention to nominate Solis as the next secretary of labor. She took office after being confirmed by the United States Senate in February 2009, becoming the first Latina to lead one of the United States federal executive departments. There she focused on workplace safety issues and on strengthening compliance with wage and hour laws. In January 2013, Solis stepped down from her post as Labor Secretary.

Returning to the area of her upbringing, in April 2014, Solis formally announced a campaign for a seat on the non-partisan Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. Solis won the seat outright in a June 3 election and was sworn in on December 1. As Supervisor, Solis successfully lobbied the state to allocate funds for the Exide battery plant cleanup. One of her areas of responsibility was Downtown Los Angeles, where her main priority was dealing with gentrification and the lack of affordable housing. She was unopposed for re-election as Supervisor, which took place in June 2018. She served one-year terms as county chair from 2015 to 2016 and again from 2020 to 2021.

==Early life and education==
Solis was born in Los Angeles, California, as the daughter of immigrant parents who had met in citizenship class and married in 1953: Juana Sequeira (b. 1926, from Nicaragua) and Raúl Solís (from Mexico). Her father was a Teamsters shop steward in Mexico and, after coming to the United States, worked at the Quemetco battery recycling plant in the City of Industry in the San Gabriel Valley. There he again organized for the Teamsters, to gain better health care benefits for workers, but also contracted lead poisoning. Her mother worked for over 20 years on the assembly line of Mattel once her children were all of school age, belonged to the United Rubber Workers, and was outspoken about working conditions. She stressed the importance of education and was a devout Roman Catholic. Her Catholic faith, she said, &quot;is a part of my life. My faith is what motivates me.&quot;

Hilda Solis is the third oldest of seven siblings (four sisters, two brothers) and grew up in a tract home in La Puente, California. She had to help raise her youngest siblings, and later said of her childhood: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t what you would call the all-American life for a young girl growing up. We had to mature very quickly.&quot; She graduated from La Puente High School, where she saw a lack of support for those wishing to continue their education, including a guidance counselor who told her mother that &quot;Your daughter is not college material. Maybe she should follow the career of her older sister and become a secretary.&quot; However, another counselor did encourage her to attend college, and even went to her house to help her fill out an application. She took her younger sisters to the library to get them to follow her lead.

She was the first of her family to go to college, being accepted into the Educational Opportunity Program (which assists low-income, first-generation college students) at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (Cal Poly Pomona) and paying for it with the help of government grants and part-time jobs. She graduated in 1979 with a Bachelor of Arts in political science. She then earned a Master of Public Administration degree at the University of Southern California in 1981.

==Early career==
Solis served near the end of the Carter Administration in the White House Office of Hispanic Affairs, where she was editor-in-chief of a newsletter during a 1980–1981 Washington semester internship as part of her master&#x27;s program. At the start of the Reagan Administration in 1981, she became a management analyst at the civil rights division of the Office of Management and Budget, but her dislike for Ronald Reagan&#x27;s policies motivated her to leave later that year.

In Washington, she met Sam H. Sayyad, whom she subsequently married. He owns an automobile repair center in Irwindale, California. The couple lives in a modest house in El Monte, California, not far from where she grew up.

Returning to California, Solis became director of the California Student Opportunity and Access Program in 1982, to help disadvantaged youth gain necessary preparation for college. In particular, she worked with the Whittier Union High School District. Friends urged her to try for elective office, and so in 1985, she ran for the board of trustees of the Rio Hondo Community College District. She campaigned hard and overtook an incumbent and one other better established candidate to become the top placer. She was reelected in 1989. During her time on the board, she worked towards improved vocational job training at the college and sought to increase the number of tenured faculty positions held by minorities and women. She joined several California chambers of commerce, women&#x27;s organizations, and Latino organizations. She gained added political visibility in 1991 when she was named to the Los Angeles County Commission on Insurance by Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina, a political mentor. Solis also served as chief of staff for State Senator Art Torres.

==California State Legislature==
Solis had the opportunity to run for the California State Assembly when, after California&#x27;s 1991 redistricting, the incumbent Dave Elder in Solis&#x27;s 57th State Assembly district was shifted into another district, while her new representative retired. In the June 1992 Democratic primary to fill the open seat, Solis&#x27;s opponents had the endorsement of powerful State Assemblyman Richard Polanco and the former incumbent. Solis had the support of Molina and U.S. Representative Barbara Boxer, in an effort that focused on door-to-door campaigning and featured Solis&#x27;s mother making burritos for campaign volunteers. Solis came out on top of a three-way Democratic race, receiving 49 percent of the vote and besting her nearest competitor, future Assemblyman Ed Chavez, who received 31 percent. In the general election, Solis garnered 61 percent of the vote against Republican Gary Woods&#x27;s 34 percent, and gained election to the Assembly. She was one of seven Latinos who won election to the Assembly in the wake of the redistricting and became collectively known as &quot;Los Siete&quot;. Solis was among the most liberal of this ideologically diverse group.

In her one term in the State Assembly, Solis was prominent in the debate on illegal immigration to the United States, backing a bill to allow immigrants in the United States illegally to attend California colleges as long as they were residing in the state. She backed labor and opposed the tobacco industry in supporting a bill that banned smoking in all workplaces. She served on committees dealing with education, labor, and environmental issues, including a new committee that dealt with groundwater contamination and landfill leakage. She was not known as a strong orator.

The Democratic incumbent in Solis&#x27;s 24th State Senate district, Art Torres, gave up his office when he received the 1994 Democratic nomination for the statewide office of California Insurance Commissioner. Solis ran for the seat, won the Democratic primary with 63 percent of the vote against two opponents, and then won the 1994 general election with 63 percent of the vote against Republican Dave Boyer&#x27;s 33 percent. She became the first Hispanic woman to ever serve in the State Senate and the first woman ever to represent the San Gabriel Valley; she was also the Senate&#x27;s youngest member at that time. She was reelected in 1998 with 74 percent of the vote.

In the State Senate, Solis authored 17 bills to prevent domestic violence and championed labor, education, and health care issues. She described herself as &quot;a big believer that government, if done right, can do a lot to improve the quality of people&#x27;s lives&quot;. In 1995 she sponsored a bill to raise the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.75; it was strongly opposed by business organizations and the restaurant industry. When Governor Pete Wilson vetoed it, she organized a successful drive to make the issue into a ballot initiative the next year, using $50,000 of her own campaign funds and rallying union support. The initiative&#x27;s passing garnered her a statewide reputation and other states followed with similar initiatives. She chaired the labor committee and established herself as loyal to labor interests, but made a point of establishing relationships with Republicans on the committee. Solis held high-profile hearings on labor law enforcement following a summer 1995 sweatshop raid in El Monte that discovered more than 70 Thai workers existing in slave-like conditions. She called garment manufacturers to explain themselves and pushed for tougher enforcement of anti-sweatshop laws. Republican state senator Ray Haynes later said that Solis was &quot;a committed liberal in the pockets of labor&quot;, but Republican State Senate Leader Rob Hurtt said of her, &quot;We obviously didn&#x27;t see eye to eye. But she was respectful. I&#x27;ll give her credit; she was a very hard worker and she knew her stuff.&quot;

Solis was an environmental activist in the State Senate, due to concerns that stemmed from a childhood spent within smelling distance of the Puente Hills Landfill and making frequent visits to the San Gabriel Mountains. In 1997, she worked to pass environmental justice legislation with a law to protect low-income and minority communities from newly located landfills, pollution sources, and other environmental hazards in neighborhoods that already had such sites. She got the bill, SB 1113, approved over the strong opposition of various business interests, water contractors, and some state government agencies, but Wilson vetoed it. She returned in 1999 with a weakened measure, which was signed by Governor Gray Davis. Calling for &quot;the fair treatment of people of all races, cultures, and incomes with respect to the development, adoption, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws&quot;, it represented the first legislation of its kind in the nation and is considered a landmark.

Solis faced controversy with her 1999 legislation, SB 63, that lowered the carpool restrictions on the El Monte Busway from three or more occupants to two or more. When this took effect in January 2000, it quickly resulted in greatly increased volume on the busway and protests from bus riders and prior carpoolers. Solis at first defended the change, but it continued to have a detrimental effect on the busway and did not improve flow in the regular traffic lanes. By May, she was co-sponsoring legislation to rescind the change and restore the higher occupancy requirement, which passed and took effect in July 2000.

Due to her work in overcoming obstacles for environmental justice, in 2000 Solis was given the Profile in Courage Award by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation, and was praised as &quot;a politician who hasn&#x27;t shied away from challenging the old boy network both within and without the Latino community&quot;. She was the first woman to win the award, and gained appearances in &quot;George&quot; and &quot;People&quot; magazines and on the &quot;Today&quot; show. Art Torres, who had become California Democratic Party chair, said of Solis, &quot;She&#x27;s going to be a national star&quot;.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

Term limits would have prevented Solis from seeking reelection to the State Senate. After months of deliberation, she decided to run for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000 against 18-year incumbent Matthew G. Martínez in the 31st congressional district, which consisted largely of working class Hispanics and Asians. This action was criticized by Hispanics and others, and only two members of Congress, Barbara Boxer and Loretta Sanchez, supported her. Martínez was more conservative than many of his constituents, as he had supported the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), opposed gun control, and supported bans on specific abortion procedures. He was also criticized for lacking effort and neglecting his district. Solis was able to obtain the support of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor (which called her a &quot;warrior for working families&quot;), Emily&#x27;s List, Handgun Control Incorporation, the Sierra Club and the California League of Conservation Voters. With their help, Solis outspent Martínez by a 4-to-1 margin and had hundreds of volunteers working for her.

Solis defeated Martínez in the March 2000 Democratic primary by a 69 percent to 31 percent margin. On primary night, Martínez called Solis &quot;obnoxious&quot; and accused her of untruthful advertising. He subsequently switched to the Republican Party, and urged Latinos to vote against her, to no great effect. Without a Republican opponent in the general election, Solis beat three little-known challengers from minor parties and won 79 percent of the vote.
Upon arriving in the House of Representatives, Solis was named freshman class whip, making her responsible for collecting votes from first-term Democrats. &quot;National Journal&quot; magazine named her one of its &quot;Ten Freshmen to Watch&quot;, and said that her election &quot;is a sign of things to come in California and a generational changing of the guard in the Hispanic Caucus&quot;. Solis commissioned for her new office a painting of the United States Capitol with the San Gabriel Mountains behind it, so that she would not forget her roots. Her Washington apartment was tiny.

As congresswoman, Solis was most known for her work on environmental issues as a member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, the Committee on Natural Resources, and the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming. She made the promotion of green-collar jobs a priority and sponsored the Southern California portion of the California Wild Heritage Act, which would create or enlarge many wilderness areas. In 2003 she sponsored legislation that funded a National Park Service study to designate a large swath of the Angeles National Forest, the Puente and Chino Hills, and the Rio Hondo and San Gabriel River, a National Recreation Area. (In 2013, after Solis had left the Obama administration, the Park Service recommended proceeding with a greatly reduced version of the original proposal; while other advocates evinced disappointment, Solis said it was still a positive step and that Congress could expand the area in whatever legislation it undertook.)

Solis was not a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, but championed the Employee Free Choice Act and was the only member of Congress on the board of American Rights at Work, a pro-union organization that strongly supports the act, for whom she served as treasurer starting in 2004. On trade she voted against both the Dominican Republic–Central America trade agreement and the U.S.-Peru trade agreement, and also expressed opposition to a purposed bilateral U.S.-Colombia trade agreement, citing concerns about human rights violations. Solis opposed legislation that would soften job safety requirements. She received 100 percent ratings from several pro-labor groups for the years 2005 through 2007, and was a major recipient of union political donations. United Farm Workers co-founder Dolores Huerta is one of Solis&#x27;s role models.
During her tenure in the House Solis was an advocate of comprehensive immigration reform. She was one of the leading opponents of H.R. 4437 a House bill sponsored by Wisconsin Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner and voted against it.

Solis supported legislation aimed at reducing the number of teen pregnancies within Latina and African American communities and sponsored a bill, that became law in 2003, that granted U.S. citizenship to immigrants after one year of military service instead of the previous three years.

Solis is Roman Catholic and pro-choice. Along with 47 other Catholic members of Congress, she sent a letter to Cardinal Theodore McCarrick of Washington, D.C., in order to dissuade him from refusing them the sacraments because of their pro-choice legislative voting. Solis signed a &quot;Statement of Principles,&quot; stating her commitment to her faith as well as her disagreement with the Roman Catholic Church on some issues. They stated that on those issues, such as abortion rights, they decided to follow their conscience instead of the Church teachings.

Solis was a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and rated a lifetime &quot;liberal quotient&quot; of 99 percent from Americans for Democratic Action, and a lifetime 2 percent rating from the American Conservative Union. From 2006 to 2008 she wrote blog entries for The Huffington Post. Solis believed in the importance of mentoring, and as a House member continued relationships she had established with up-and-coming political figures in her district, including California State Assemblywoman Judy Chu and Monterey Park Mayor Sharon Martinez.
After the 2000 census and subsequent redistricting, Solis&#x27;s area became part of California&#x27;s 32nd congressional district. She was reelected for additional terms in 2002, 2004, and 2006 by very large margins, twice with no Republican in opposition. She ran unopposed in 2008.
Solis chaired the Health and the Environment Task Force of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus during the 110th Congress. However, during 2006 and 2007, Solis was part of a falling out between several female representatives and Joe Baca, leader of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, arguing there was a &quot;lack of respect afforded to women members of the Hispanic Caucus,&quot; which Baca denied. She had previously broken ties with the caucus&#x27; political action committee over its campaign contributions to Baca&#x27;s sons. Baca responded that Solis &quot;was a kiss-up&quot; to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, a remark for which he later apologized. Solis was indeed considered a close ally of Pelosi, which helped her get a seat on the Energy and Commerce Committee. She considered running for the position of Democratic Caucus Vice-Chairman for the 110th Congress, but deferred to incumbent John Larson after Rahm Emanuel chose to run for caucus chair, which Larson had been running for. Solis&#x27;s aggressive fundraising for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee gained her a vice chair position on the Democratic Steering &amp; Policy Committee. At the time of her selection to Obama&#x27;s cabinet, she had been elected 2nd vice chair of the Hispanic Caucus and was considered a potential candidate for a leadership position in the House.

Solis was a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 2008 presidential bid; when that fell short, Barack Obama aggressively sought her support, as part of strengthening his appeal to Hispanic voters. She supported Clinton&#x27;s effort to establish a U.S. Public Service Academy and was a co-sponsor of a House bill to create one. Solis did not become wealthy from her political career; by 2008, she and her husband&#x27;s main assets consisted of retirement funds and his auto shop, valued at under $100,000.

==U.S. Secretary of Labor==

On December 18, 2008, sources close to the Obama transition team identified Solis as the President-elect&#x27;s choice for Secretary of Labor, the last cabinet position yet to be filled. The selection earned praise from the AFL–CIO and other labor organizations, but was not well received by business groups and the anti-union group Center for Union Facts. The official announcement was made by Obama on December 19. Solis&#x27;s successor was chosen in a special election in California&#x27;s 32nd congressional district; she declined to endorse a candidate in the primary (from which her past mentee Judy Chu emerged on top and eventually won the general election).

Solis&#x27;s confirmation hearings were held on January 9, 2009, before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Committee chair Ted Kennedy repeatedly praised her, while, despite examination by Republican members, Solis declined to discuss specific policy issues, including the Employee Free Choice Act. Several days later, Senate Republicans said they might try to put a procedural hold on her nomination because of her unwillingness to answer questions in detail in the hearings. By January 23, a secret hold was placed on the nomination by an anonymous Republican. A series of written questions and responses between Republican members and Solis followed, during which she was more forthcoming. Republican Mike Enzi pressed her on whether her unpaid high-level positions at American Rights at Work constituted prohibited lobbying activity; Solis denied violation of rules of conduct and stated she had not helped lobbying. Solis did acknowledge that she had failed to report those positions on her annual House financial disclosure forms at the time, which a White House spokesperson argued was an unintentional oversight. On February 2, Obama appointed veteran Labor Department official Edward C. Hugler as Acting Secretary. The prolonged process was considered by some Republican aides to be a preview of future battles on labor issues between the Obama administration and Republicans in Congress.

A vote on Solis&#x27;s committee confirmation was set on February 5, but postponed after news that Solis&#x27;s husband Sam Sayyad had just paid $6,400 in outstanding state and local tax liens dating back to 1993 for his auto repair business. Sayyad had filed a separate tax return from Solis, and intended to contest the lien as they were for business taxes he believed to have already paid. A White House spokesperson stated Solis should not be penalized for any mistakes that her husband may have made. The revelations came in the wake of several other Obama nominations troubled or derailed due to tax issues. Committee Republicans subsequently indicated they would not blame Solis, but were still concerned about her ties to American Rights at Work. On February 11, 2009, the committee approved her nomination by voice vote with two votes opposed. After still further delays, Republicans agreed not to subject her nomination to a filibuster and on February 24, 2009, Solis was confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 80–17. She resigned from the House and was sworn into her new position that evening. (A ceremonial swearing in featuring Vice President Joe Biden was later held on March 13.)

Solis became the first Hispanic woman to serve as a regular U.S. cabinet member and the first cabinet secretary with Central American descent. She also became the first Hispanic Secretary of Labor. Solis felt that under the George W. Bush administration, the department had become unimportant and lacking in power, and that its actions reflected a pro-business agenda. Accordingly, she hoped to reinvigorate it.

In her first days as secretary, Solis affirmed an extension to unemployment benefits specified by the 2009 Obama stimulus package, and joined Vice President Biden&#x27;s Middle Class Task Force. In her first major speech as secretary, Solis pleased community forum attendees at Miami&#x27;s Greater Bethel AME Church by vowing more aggressive enforcement of workplace protection laws, saying &quot;You can rest assured that there is a new sheriff in town.&quot; In late March 2009, Solis vowed to add 250 investigators to the department&#x27;s Wage and Hour Division after a Government Accountability Office report showed the division&#x27;s enforcement of wage laws was quite inadequate; the staffing up was completed by the end of the year. In late May 2009, Solis suspended immigrant guest worker regulations related to H-2A visas adopted in the final days of the Bush administration; the move earned plaudits from the United Farm Workers. In July 2009, she expressed concern about workplace deaths among Hispanics, which she said they were especially vulnerable to (her continuing attention to issues such as this during her tenure would lead to Hispanic workers considering her their champion). In October 2009, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration levied the largest fine in its history on BP for failing to fix safety problems following the 2005 Texas City Refinery disaster. Business groups such as the National Federation of Independent Business complained that Solis was forging a less cooperative relationship, one that departed from the Bush administration&#x27;s &quot;compliance assistance&quot; approach; the Labor Department said that compliance assistance was still an important part of the new strategy.

For 2010, Solis&#x27;s agenda was to enact some ninety new rules and regulations intended to grant more power to unions and to workers. Whether Solis would try to revive Clinton administration ergonomics rules that had been discarded in the early days of the Bush administration, and that business groups continued to oppose, was unclear. In the wake of the April 2010 Upper Big Branch Mine disaster in West Virginia, the worst in the U.S. in forty years, Solis announced that the Labor Department&#x27;s Mine Safety and Health Administration would conduct an internal review of its enforcement of the Massey Energy mine prior to the accident. She also requested that the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health provide an independent analysis of that review. (By the end of her tenure, however, some safety experts said she had fallen short of getting any meaningful new regulatory scheme in place in the wake of the disaster.) Later that month, Solis and the department hosted the first-ever meeting of the G-20 labor ministers; they discussed how to accelerate job creation in their respective countries. Solis also faced disgruntlement from a local of the American Federation of Government Employees representing her own employees, who were unhappy that a longstanding flextime program reduced under the George W. Bush administration had not been restored. The department said the program was modern and fair and that it was part of ongoing contract negotiations with the local. The year also saw the department trying to crack down on firms that illegally use summer internships for free labor, by clarifying what may constitute an unpaid academic internship; the move brought resistance from universities. The year additionally saw Solis leading an administration campaign against farmers who employed children or underpaid workers. (Proposed new rules in this area were dropped in 2012, however, following adamant criticism from conservatives and agricultural groups.)

In February 2011, as protests continued over Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker&#x27;s proposal to limit that state&#x27;s public employee unions&#x27; collective bargaining rights, and similar proposals were made in other states, Solis spoke out strongly and emotionally against such moves, saying &quot;[those governors] aren&#x27;t just asking workers to tighten their belts, they&#x27;re demanding they give up their uniquely American rights as workers.&quot; Overall, however, the Obama administration did not speak out forcefully against these moves.

In October 2012, Solis defended the work of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, after the Current Population Survey it puts out monthly reported that unemployment in the United States had fallen below eight percent for this first time since Obama took office. Some critics, including former General Electric CEO Jack Welch, charged that the number had been tampered with in order to benefit Obama one month before the U.S. presidential election. Solis said, &quot;I&#x27;m insulted when I hear that because we have a very professional, civil service organization where you have top, top economists that work at the BLS. They&#x27;ve been doing these calculations. These are our best trained and best-skilled individuals working in the BLS, and it&#x27;s really ludicrous to hear that kind of statement.&quot; For the year, the Labor Department set a record for the most back pay it had ever collected due to wage violations, $280 million going to some 300,000 workers. Workplace fatalities in construction and general industrial sectors reached an all-time low.

On January 9, 2013, Solis tendered her resignation as Secretary of Labor, becoming one of several Cabinet members deciding not to stay on for Obama&#x27;s second term. Her last day in office was January 22, 2013.

Solis, who had never become part of the inner circle of presidential advisors, said it had been a difficult decision and Obama praised her work as secretary. Reflecting upon her tenure, Solis generally garnered praise from labor unions and leading Democrats for her stricter enforcement of job safety regulations and more aggressive pursuit of wage and hour violators. Other leaders and analysts in the labor field thought her performance as secretary was underwhelming, with minimal public visibility and no memorable legacy left behind. All agreed that she operated in a difficult political environment, with the effects of the Great Recession still being felt, Republicans staunchly opposed to labor-based initiatives, and the Obama administration&#x27;s attentions focused elsewhere. Business groups, meanwhile, continued to characterize her as having been uncooperative in her dealings with them.

During early 2014, reports emerged that the United States Office of Special Counsel, the United States Department of Justice, and the FBI had begun investigating Solis during 2012 for possible violations of fundraising rules by federal officials during her time as Labor Secretary. Allegations were made that Solis solicited subordinates for funds for the 2012 re-election campaign of President Obama. A spokesperson for Solis said that she believed she had done nothing wrong. The matter was also being looked into by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and its chair, Representative Darrell Issa, who said there was evidence supporting the allegations. By early 2016, no further word had emerged on any of these investigations.

==Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors==
Solis&#x27;s departure from the Labor Department was speculated as a preparation for a run for a seat on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors in 2014, to replace the term-limited incumbent, 1st District supervisor Gloria Molina. Officially, Solis only said that she wanted to rest, reconnect with her local community after twelve years in Washington, and spend time with her mother, who was 87 years old at the time.

Later during January 2013, Solis confirmed her interest in the County Board of Supervisors race, saying &quot;I&#x27;m going to take a look at it.&quot; In explaining why a former U.S. Representative and Cabinet member would be interested in a county-level body, analysts stated that the board is the most powerful county-level legislative body in the United States, and exercises some executive and quasi-judicial powers as well. It controls a workforce larger than the Labor Department&#x27;s and its $26 billion budget is equivalent to that of an average U.S. state. Each member presiding over some two million constituents, three times that of Solis&#x27; old congressional district, and that it is quite possibly the fourth most powerful position in California politics, after governor, U.S. Senator, and mayor of Los Angeles. The supervisors have long been nicknamed &quot;the five little kings&quot;.

In November 2013, Solis became a scholar-in-residence at her &quot;alma mater&quot; of Cal Poly Pomona. Her duties were to include guest lecturing in classes, mentoring students, and assisting in curriculum development, with a focus in political science.

On April 5, 2014, Solis formally announced the start of her campaign for the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors seat, with the election to be held on June 3. By this time she had raised over $600,000 for her effort and was considered the favorite to win the contest. News of the federal investigation had little effect on her campaign. Solis won the seat on June 4, 2014, garnering 70 percent of the vote against two other opponents. The margin meant she won the seat outright and would not need to run in a runoff election.

As Supervisor for District 1, she was at the forefront of the response to the Exide lead contamination issue, which affected Vernon and several other communities within her purview and which touched upon her past concerns with environmental justice. The Supervisors allocated some county money for cleanup, with Solis saying, &quot;the state continues to drag its feet&quot;. Going to the state capitol and asking for additional funds to remedy the situation, she said, &quot;This has gone on too long.&quot; In February 2016 she praised Governor Jerry Brown for finally increasing state funds for the cleanup, saying &quot;Our voices were heard. For too long we have seen two Americas: one in which affluent neighborhoods get immediate help and relief. The other America is made up of poor working-class families who silently suffer. Today&#x27;s announcement from the governor reconciles these two Americas.&quot;

Among the other areas Solis was responsible for was Downtown Los Angeles. There she said her main priority was dealing with gentrification and the lack of affordable housing. By 2017, data showed that, under her tenure, the homeless rate had gone up by 48 percent in her district, with a 36 percent increase in the San Gabriel Valley itself. The increase was attributed by officials familiar with the problem to constantly increasing housing costs combined with flat incomes. Solis said in response, &quot;With increasingly out-of-control rents, we need more tools to secure housing stability for the most vulnerable County residents.&quot;

Regarding the new job as a whole, Solis said, &quot;It&#x27;s fascinating how many people work for the county – over 100,000. At the Department of Labor it was like 15,000. The budget here is $26 billion, much more than what I was used to in D.C.&quot; In December 2015 Solis took over as Chair of the Supervisors, a position which is rotated on a yearly basis. She said a priority for 2016 would be &quot;to reaffirm our commitment to our diverse county family – to make this family, our family, inclusive for everybody, no matter their background, no matter where they come from, no matter how far down the scale they have been.&quot; One of her efforts went towards getting additional resources for older children who were transitioning out of the foster care system.

Following the results of the 2016 United States presidential election and the fear of mass deportations that ensued due to the victor, Solis worked together with Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti to create the $10 million L.A. Justice Fund, which would provide legal services to illegal immigrants facing deportation.

In May 2017, Solis voted in favor of retaining designation of the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument, created in 2014 but under review, along with other recently created national monuments, by new U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke for possible revocation. Solis also favored a parcel tax to increase the number of parks and playgrounds in Los Angeles. In October 2017 a motion that she authored passed the board and resulted in Columbus Day being replaced as an official holiday in Los Angeles County by Indigenous Peoples Day. She said in a statement, &quot;This action is about publicly recognizing that America&#x27;s ancestors, for centuries, oppressed certain minority groups. This is not about erasing history; I believe the full history and impact of Christopher Columbus should be taught to current and future generations. While we cannot change the past, we can realize the pain that millions suffered throughout our nation&#x27;s history, as well as the tremendous achievements of the original inhabitants of our continent.&quot;

In January 2018, Solis and the other supervisors supported the appointment of Nicole Tinkham as interim public defender, despite a letter signed by 390 public defenders who were concerned that Tinkham lacked criminal law experience and the potential for a conflict of interest, given Tinkham&#x27;s prior representation of the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department.

In the 2018 Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors election, Solis ran unopposed, and was accordingly re-elected on June 5, 2018. A lack of serious opposition, or any opposition at all, is not unusual for incumbent Supervisors.

In 2019, Solis, with fellow supervisor Sheila Kuehl, was a leader of the successful effort to stop a planned $1.7 billion mental health treatment center in the downtown area, intended to replace Men&#x27;s Central Jail. Solis and others argued that the new facility would become a de facto jail and instead urged the creation of smaller treatment facilities spread around the county. Solis said in reference to contractors for any such project, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to see people who are just used to building brick and mortar. I want to see people who have a humanistic approach.&quot;
During the year, Solis also became an active supporter for Joe Biden&#x27;s 2020 presidential campaign, saying that the former vice president, whom she dealt with during her time as Secretary of Labor, had the necessary &quot;steady hand and experience&quot; and who also is &quot;personable&quot; and can interact well with a wide range of people.

The year 2020 was marked by the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, and Solis and the other supervisors consistently urged residents to stay at home and use other social distancing measures. However some county employees in the districts of Solis and another supervisor complained that they were being compelled to report to unsafe offices instead of being allowed to work remotely. Solis said that the services provided by some positions could only be done in person, but following newspaper inquiries on the matter, remote work was opened up to more county workers. In December 2020, Solis became rotating chair of the board again, and by then the entire board was women, a first for the county and something that Solis said was a historic accomplishment. As the pandemic in Los Angeles reached an especially high peak towards the end of the year, Solis pleaded with county residents to stay home: &quot;As we near Christmas, I urge everyone to cancel their holiday plans to gather with members outside of one&#x27;s households. This will save many lives.&quot;

The pandemic subsequently ebbed for a while, but then by mid-2021 the highly infectious Delta variant had become a significant threat, and in July 2021 Solis issued an executive order reimposing an indoors mask mandate within the county. By this point COVID-19 vaccination in the United States was well underway but also increasingly the subject of political disputes. Saying that &quot;As vaccinations continue at a pace slower than what is necessary to slow the spread, the need for immediate action is great,&quot; Solis issued a mandate in August 2021 that county employees, who numbered over a hundred thousand, be vaccinated by October 1. Her action gave no option for regular testing and thus went further than most such mandates elsewhere in California and the rest of the country.

In 2022, Solis signed a letter, along with her four supervisorial colleagues, to California Gov. Gavin Newsom requesting the phase out of the dangerous chemical Modified Hydrofluoric Acid (liable to cause a mass-casualty event in the case of a breach of its containment unit) at refineries where it remains in use rather than a safer alternative.
==Awards and honors==

As mentioned, in 2000, Solis was given the Profile in Courage Award by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation.

In 2010, Solis received the inaugural Robert P. Biller Award for Exemplary Public Service from the University of Southern California&#x27;s School of Policy, Planning, and Development. The Hispanic Association of Colleges &amp; Universities named Solis as the recipient of its 2011 President&#x27;s Award for Excellence. In 2012, Solis received the Champion for the Futures of Farmworker Children Award from the Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs. That same year, Solis was given a President&#x27;s Award from an organization associated with California State University, Los Angeles. The Imagen Foundation honored Solis with its President&#x27;s Award in 2016, with the presentation being done by the actress America Ferrara. In 2019, Solis received the Leadership Award at the annual American Latino Influencer Awards.

Solis gave the commencement address at Rio Hondo College in 2014, where she had once been on the board of trustees. In recognition of her long career in public service, she was in 2023 awarded an honorary doctor of laws degree by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Several entities have been named after Solis. Beginning in the 1990s, the Hilda L. Solis Scholarship Dinner &amp; Reception has been given annually by her alma mater, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, with a large number of students having benefitted from receiving scholarships.
The Hilda L. Solis Care First Village is a set of housing units intended for the homeless that are put together using modular building techniques and located in Downtown Los Angeles. The Hilda L. Solis Learning Academy School of Technology, Business and Education is located in the general East Los Angeles area and is part of the Los Angeles Unified School District.

In 2022, the White House appointed Solis to the Board of Trustees for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.

<text>Neu-Ulm is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Swabia, Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the east and clockwise) the districts of Günzburg and Unterallgäu and the state of Baden-Württemberg (districts Biberach and Alb-Donau, city of Ulm).

The district was established in 1972 by merging the former districts of Neu-Ulm and Illertissen with the previously district-free city of Neu-Ulm.

The district includes the eastern metropolitan area of the city of Ulm. The Danube and its tributary, the Iller, form the western border of the district.

<doc id="408992" wikidata="Q1432251" url="?curid=408992" title="All Nigeria Peoples Party">
<text>The All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) was a political party in Nigeria.

The ANPP was a household party in the extreme north of Nigeria, primarily due to its mass appeal among more religious voters. It was the strongest opposition party, controlling seven of the nation&#x27;s thirty-six states at one point. The party&#x27;s biggest achievement in the 2003 election was its gubernatorial victory in Kano State where it defeated the ruling People&#x27;s Democratic Party (PDP) to take control of one of the country&#x27;s most populous states.

Following the 2007 election, the ANPP challenged the victory of Umaru Yar&#x27;Adua, although it was announced on 27 June 2007 following talks, that the ANPP had agreed to join Yar&#x27;Adua&#x27;s government of national unity. There was reportedly disagreement within the ANPP about the talks. Buhari subsequently denounced the idea in a BBC interview and suggested that the decision was only made by part of the party, alleging that they were &quot;just looking for jobs for themselves&quot;.

In February 2013, the party merged with the Action Congress of Nigeria, the All Progressives Grand Alliance, and the Congress for Progressive Change to form the All Progressives Congress.

==Political ideology==
The ANPP is a conservative party with mass appeal among more religious voters. The party draws its strength predominantly from Northern Nigeria.

==Earlier incarnation==
There was a party of the same name during the Second Republic, which was banned following the military coup of 1983 led by General Buhari.

The current party (founded in 1999) shares the same name, but with little or no resemblance, affinity, or affiliation to the original ANPP.

<doc id="408998" wikidata="Q186591" url="?curid=408998" title="Pakistan People's Party">
<text>The Pakistan People&#x27;s Party (, ; PPP) is a centre-left political party in Pakistan, currently being the largest in the Senate and second-largest party in the National Assembly. The party was founded in 1967 in Lahore, when a number of prominent left-wing politicians in the country joined hands against the rule of Ayub Khan, under the leadership of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. It is affiliated with the Socialist International. The PPP&#x27;s platform was formerly socialist, and its stated priorities continue to include transforming Pakistan into a social-democratic state, promoting egalitarian values, establishing social justice, and maintaining a strong military. It, alongside the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, is one of the three largest political parties of Pakistan.

The Pakistan People’s Party Parliamentarians (PPPP) is a dynastic political party led by Asif Ali Zardari, who serves as the President of Pakistan. The party is chaired by his son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, while his daughter, Asifa Bhutto Zardari, also holds a position as a Member of the National Assembly (MNA).

Since its foundation in 1967, it has been a major centre-left force in the country and the party&#x27;s leadership has been dominated by the members of the Bhutto family. Its centre of power lies in the southern province of Sindh. The People&#x27;s Party has been voted into power on five separate occasions (1970, 1977, 1988, 1993 and 2008), while on four occasions (1990, 1997, 2002 and 2013) it emerged as the largest opposition party. There have been a total of four prime ministers from the PPP. In 2018 general election and 2024 general election, PPP stood at 3rd position in the National Assembly of Pakistan.

The PPP dominated the politics of Pakistan during the 1970s, suffering a temporary decline during the military dictatorship of Gen. Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. After the re-establishment of democracy in 1988 following Zia&#x27;s death, a two-party system developed, consisting of the People&#x27;s Party and the Islamic Democratic Alliance, later succeeded by the Nawaz League. The party served as the principal opposition to the Gen. Pervez Musharraf-led military government from 1999 to 2008.

The party conceded defeat during the 2013 general election, losing swathes of support in the Punjab Province where most of its base was lost to the emerging PTI, although it retained its provincial government in Sindh. In the 2018 general election, for the first time in history, the party was able to neither form the government nor emerge as the largest party in opposition. The above said electoral position remained the same in 2024 general election.

== History ==
=== Foundation ===
The Pakistan People&#x27;s Party (PPP) was launched at its founding convention held in Lahore on 30 November and 1 December 1967. At the same meeting, former Foreign Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was elected as its chairman. Among the expressed goals of the party were the establishment of an &quot;egalitarian democracy&quot; and the &quot;application of socialistic ideas to realize economic and social justice&quot;. A more immediate task was the struggle against the presidency of Muhammad Ayub Khan.

=== Left-wing beginnings ===
In the 1960s, Ayub Khan&#x27;s policies were seen by many to have nourished the capitalist class at the expense of ordinary people, evidenced by the drastic increase in income inequality and poverty. In April 1968, Dr. Mahbub ul Haq, the then Chief Economist of the Planning Commission reported that 22 families controlled 66% of the industries and owned an 87% share in the country&#x27;s banking and insurance industries. Due to the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, the economy collapsed, and investment growth in Pakistan saw a 20% decline in following years. Although Pakistan was able to win the war of 1965, but the Tashkent Declaration shocked the people of Pakistan due to their expectation of a Pakistani victory results and the decision of declaration. Ayub Khan fiercely defended the declaration and called it in the best interest of the people. This led to a confrontation between Ayub Khan and his Foreign Minister Zulifkar Ali Bhutto which led to the resignation of the latter and the eventual creation of the People&#x27;s Party. Bhutto went on to accuse Ayub of &quot;losing the war on the negotiating table.&quot; Opposition parties decided to protest against the declaration, but the state responded by imposing bans upon public gatherings and arresting activists. The resignation of Bhutto further angered the public, who were growing ever more discontent with President Khan&#x27;s government. On 5 February 1966, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman announced his program of regional autonomy for East Bengal at a news conference.

Bhutto&#x27;s passionate stance against Ayub&#x27;s regime was hailed by leftist groups, leading him to attempt to find a suitable position for himself in the National Awami Party (NAP). Unable to succeed in this, Bhutto decided to launch his own political party. On 30 November 1967, a convention was held in Lahore, where democratic socialists and left-wing intellectuals gathered to meet with Bhutto at the residence of Dr. Mubashir Hassan, and the Pakistan People&#x27;s Party was formed. The members of the newly formed party elected Zulfikar Ali Bhutto as its first chairman. Its manifesto, titled &#x27;Islam is our Religion; Democracy is our Politics; Socialism is our Economy; Power Lies with the People&#x27; was written by Bengali communist J. A. Rahim, and published on 9 December 1967. The main objective of the party was to establish a more classless society, adopting a clear socialist programme of nationalisation and reducing economic inequality. The document declared that &quot;Only socialism, which creates equal opportunities for all, protects [people] from exploitation, removes the barriers of class distinction, and is capable of establishing economic and social justice. Socialism is the highest expression of democracy and its logical fulfillment&quot;.

According to Philip E. Jones, the People&#x27;s Party had three main ideological camps: Marxists, Islamic socialists and the landed elite. In 1968, when Ayub Khan was celebrating his government&#x27;s &#x27;Decade of Development&#x27;, demonstrations erupted all over the country. In the same year, spontaneous students&#x27; movements erupted throughout the country, largely due to unemployment and economic hardship which saw the beginning of the 1968 movement in Pakistan. In the same time, ideological differences emerged within the NAP, which led to a major split between the pro-Soviet and pro-China factions. The pro-Soviet faction, led by Wali Khan, proposed a parliamentary route to power, whereas the pro-China faction led by Moulana Bhashani advocated for a peasant revolution to overthrow Ayub Khan&#x27;s regime. The vacuum on the left generated by the disunity of the National Awami Party was effectively filled by Bhutto&#x27;s People&#x27;s Party as a united front of opposition to Ayub Khan. 

Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, being shrewder in sensing the mood of the mass movement, had embarked upon the &#x27;need for socialism&#x27; and other radical slogans. This PPP programme connected with the masses&#x27; moods, aspirations and sentiments; the PPP became the largest party of the masses in the history of Pakistan, almost overnight. The first activists and cadres who gave the PPP a foothold and standing were from the different Maoist groups and other scattered left activists. These groups were disillusioned and frustrated by the traditional Stalinist leadership of the left.In 1968, a massive public-relations program was launched by the party, beginning in the Punjab. Bhutto&#x27;s program directly targeted the country&#x27;s poverty-stricken masses. The left-wing oriented slogan &#x27;Land to the Landless&#x27; proved to be popular amongst the peasants and labour-force, as the party promised not only to abolish the feudal system, but also to redistribute land. The working-classes quickly flocked to the party, believing it to be a party dedicated to the destruction of capitalism in the country. The young university students and teachers who often bore the brunt of Ayub Khan&#x27;s dictatorial regime during his decade-long rule were promised a better future with better educational and career opportunities. Many other members of society who had felt stifled and repressed by the press-control and heavy censorship practised by the authoritarian Khan regime also joined the new party, whose manifesto also attracted the country&#x27;s numerous minorities. The continuous contentions forced Ayub Khan to resign from the presidency in 1969, leading to the imposition of martial law by Army Commander General Yahya Khan, after he promised to hold elections within two years. During this time, the Peoples Party intensified its support in West Pakistan, organizing itself and gaining support from poor masses in West Pakistan.

=== 1970 general election and 1971 war ===

Ayub Khan succumbed to political pressure on 26 March 1969 and handed power to the Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army, General Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan. President Yahya Khan imposed martial law and the 1962 Constitution was abrogated. On 31 March 1970, President Yahya Khan announced a Legal Framework Order (LFO) which called for direct elections to a unicameral legislature. Many in the West feared the East wing&#x27;s demand for provincial autonomy. The purpose of the LFO was to secure the future constitution which would be written after the election in order for it to include safeguards such as preserving Pakistan&#x27;s territorial integrity and Islamic ideology. In the background of recent political developments, the People&#x27;s Party decided to hold its National Conference. This was to be held in Lahore from 4–6 April 1969 but due to the imposition of Martial law, it was called off. Later from 1–3 July 1970, the first conference was held in Hala Sharif, Sindh. At this historical conference which is known as the Hala Conference, there were two different opinions on participating in the upcoming general election. Some argued that the Party should not take part in elections but rather adopt methods of revolutionary insurrection to take power, whereas others emphasized the importance of partaking in parliamentary democracy. In the end, the decision to participate in the elections was taken. On 4 January 1970, Z.A. Bhutto officially launched his election campaign by addressing a public meeting at Nishtar Park, Karachi then conducted public meetings at Rawalpindi&#x27;s Liaquat Bagh and NWFP. By the 1970s, the Pakistan Peoples Party had become the leading party of the Left in Pakistan, publishing its ideas in newspapers such as &quot;Nusrat&quot;, &quot;Fatah&quot;, and &quot;Mussawat&quot;. During the 1970 General Election, the People&#x27;s Party dominated West Pakistani seats, defeating far-right and other right-of-centre forces in West-Pakistan, However, the story in East Pakistan was altogether different, where the Awami League had dominated and the People&#x27;s Party had failed to win a single seat (likewise, the Awami League had also failed to make a breakthrough in West Pakistan). The Awami League secured 160 seats out of the total 300 seats in the National Assembly, whereas the People&#x27;s Party came second with 81 seats.

The results gave the Awami League the constitutional right to form a government. However, Bhutto contested Rahman&#x27;s mandate to form government in West Pakistan due to his party not having won a single seat there. Instead, Bhutto proposed the One Unit scheme, with two separate prime ministers for West and East Pakistan. This proposal was rejected by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, whose Six Point programme for a more federal Pakistan was also rejected by Bhutto. On 3 March 1971, the two leaders, along with President General Yahya Khan, met in Dacca to try and resolve the constitutional crisis. After their discussions yielded no satisfactory results, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman called for a nationwide strike. Bhutto, fearing a civil war, sent his trusted companion, Mubashir Hassan to convey a message to Rahman, who agreed to meet Bhutto once again. The two leaders agreed to form a coalition government with Rahman as prime minister and Bhutto as president. However, the military was unaware of these developments, and Bhutto increased his pressure on Rahman to reach a decision. After the launch of military action in East Pakistan (see Operations &quot;Searchlight&quot; and &quot;Barisal&quot;), the situation became unreconcilable.

Bhutto and his supporters criticised Yayha Khan&#x27;s handling of the situation which led to the arrests of Bhutto and members of the People&#x27;s Party, alongside Mujibur Rahman in Adiala Jail. This was followed by Indian intervention in East Bengal, cementing the defeat of the Pakistan Armed Forces, and the independence of Bangladesh.

=== Post-war politics ===

As result of Pakistan&#x27;s defeat by India in Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, General Yahya Khan was forced to resign. On 20 December, he was taken to the President House in Rawalpindi, where he took over two positions from Yahya Khan, one as president and the other as first civilian Chief Martial Law Administrator. Thus, he was the first civilian Chief Martial Law Administrator of the dismembered Pakistan. By the time Bhutto had assumed control of what remained of Pakistan, the nation was completely isolated, angered, and demoralized. After becoming president, Bhutto in his first statement to foreign media correspondents said: Let us forget the past. We have made terrible mistakes and Pakistan is in a mess—the worst crisis in our history. But we have been given a terrible bashing by the Western press and I ask you now to please get off our backs while we put our house in order.

=== Bhutto era ===
Bhutto vowed to build a new Pakistan. On 2 January 1972 Bhutto announced the nationalisation of all major industries, including iron and steel, heavy engineering, heavy electricals, petrochemicals, cement and public utilities. A new labour policy was announced increasing the power of trade unions. Although he came from a feudal background himself, Bhutto announced reforms limiting land ownership and a government take-over of more than a million acres to distribute to landless peasants. More than 2,000 civil servants were dismissed on charges of corruption. He successfully negotiated the return of 93,000 prisoners of war and settlement with India, whilst kicking off the country&#x27;s nuclear programme in January 1972. The promulgation of the 1973 constitution put Pakistan on the road to parliamentary democracy. In the People&#x27;s Party&#x27;s first budget of 1972–3, health and education were nationalised, with a record 42.3 percent of the total budget being allocated for them.

The National Assembly of Pakistan approved the new constitution on 10 April 1973 and it came into effect from 14 August 1973, the day Bhutto became Prime Minister of Pakistan. Bhutto initiated different reforms like expanding the school network to slums and small villages, creating basic health facilities, land reforms and housing schemes. However, the Party&#x27;s measures fell through as a result of 1970s global economic recession, the 1973 oil crisis, and the failure of reforms resulted into rising inflation. The letter of credit of Pakistan was rejected by foreign banks and a massive outflow of capital was seen from the country. Dr Mubashar Hassan, then-finance minister wrote in a note to all ministers, special assistants, provincial chief ministers and governors: &quot;We have been in office for more than six months. Many decisions have been taken but a growing implementation gap is becoming visible. Once the implementation gap sets in, the decline begins. We came to abolish the abominable status quo but the status quo is very much present...&quot;Similarly, workers intensified their demands and during first months of 1972, whole country engulfed with periodic lockouts and encirclement of industries. Among them notable struggles were the emergence of a worker-led court under Abdur Rehman in Kot Lakhpat and the Karachi labour unrest of 1972.

In the field of foreign policy, the People&#x27;s Party built a good relationship with China, with Bhutto successfully negotiating an aid package worth $300 million for Pakistan and also writing off loans amounting to over $110 million. On 22 February 1974, Pakistan hosted all the leaders of the Islamic world in the summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in Lahore.

Domestically, serious issues began to emerge within the party&#x27;s ranks, when Bhutto decided to utilise the state to keep an eye on the activities of the Pakistan National Alliance. After he purged left-wing activists – such as Malik Meraj Khalid, a Marxist law minister – from his own party&#x27;s ranks, Dr. Mubashir Hassan also resigned. In September 1974, under pressure from religious organizations, Bhutto passed a constitutional amendment declaring the Ahmadiyya community to be non-Muslim. In 1973, Bhutto ordered an Army operation in the Baluchistan province against the government of the National Awami Party.

In the 1977 general election, the People&#x27;s Party won a landslide majority. However, the PNA-led opposition started demonstrations against alleged rigging in the elections. The opposition labelled Bhutto as a &#x27;Kafir&#x27; (i.e., unislamic) and an alcoholic, to which Bhutto responded, by saying, &quot;Yes, I drink alcohol, but I do not drink the blood of the people&quot;, although, in 1974, he had banned alcohol. Bhutto offered to hold another set of elections in November 1977 and offered ministries to the PNA, but this failed, sparking further civil disobedience against the Peoples Party. Tensions mounted and despite an agreement reached between the opposition and PPP, martial law was imposed in the country by Chief of Army Staff Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. In April 1979, after a controversial trial found him guilty of murdering a political opponent, Bhutto was executed by hanging.

In 1982, his daughter, Benazir Bhutto, was elected as the Peoples Party&#x27;s co-chairperon alongside his wife, Nusrat Bhutto, who was elected in 1979. The People&#x27;s Party headed the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy which was one of the largest non-violent democratic movements in the world against the military dictatorship of Zia-ul-Haq.

After eleven years, the People&#x27;s Party returned to power by winning the 1988 General Election, with Benazir Bhutto becoming the first female head of government in the Muslim world. In 1990, the Peoples party&#x27;s government was dismissed due to economic recession, issues regarding to national security and nationalisation. Benazir and the Peoples Party lost the 1990 General Election serving in opposition for the first since its inception in 1967. It was found by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 2012 that this election had been rigged in favour of the Pakistan Muslim League.

The People&#x27;s Party returned to power in the 1993 General Election, forming a coalition with JUI(F). However, over the next few years, the Party split into three main factional groups: the Bhuttoists, the Parliamentarians and the Sherpaoists, with Bhuttoism becoming the most influential and powerful in Sindh. Internal opposition and disapproval of Benazir Bhutto&#x27;s policies by her brother Murtaza Bhutto created a rift in their relations. Murtaza Bhutto was assassinated in 1996, with many pointing the finger of blame at his sister.
Its effect on the Peoples Party was disastrous, whose government was dismissed by the party&#x27;s own elected President Farooq Leghari in September 1996. Since 1996 and Bhutto&#x27;s assassination in 2007, the Peoples Party has suffered with major internal factional conflicts, between leftists and neoliberals over the Party&#x27;s shift to Thatcherite economics.

=== Recent history ===
After the assassination of Benazir Bhutto on 27 December 2007, the 2008 parliamentary elections which were scheduled to be held in January were postponed until 18 February. The PPP won the considerable victory on among all political parties, gaining a momentum of general seats 121 from all provinces in the Parliament, whilst the centre-right, Pakistan Muslim League came second in place, managing to secure 91 seats from all over the country. In 2008, the co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari announced to end the fourth dictatorship when he quoted: &quot;Pakistan was on its way of ridding dictatorships forever&quot;, and appealed to the Pakistan Muslim League (N) leader, former Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, to form a coalition controlling over half the seats in Pakistan&#x27;s 342 seat parliament.

In a press conference held in Muree, Punjab on 9 March 2008,conservatives under Nawaz Sharif and socialists led by Asif Ali Zardari officially signed an agreement to form a coalition government. Titled the PPP-PML summit declaration, the joint declaration both parties agreed on the reinstatement of judges deposed during the emergency rule imposed on 3 November 2007 by General Pervez Musharraf within 30 days after the new federal government was formed. On 28 March, the peoples party appointed Yousaf Raza Gillani for the office of prime minister and formed coalition government with Pakistan Muslim League (Q) in Punjab, Awami National Party in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, JUI(F) in Balochistan and Muttahida Qaumi Movement in Sindh. While on other hand, the Peoples Party claimed the exclusive mandate in Gilgit-Baltistan and Kashmir. However, this treaty was later on was violated by PPP government, after which PML(N) withdrew from coalition and federal government.

On 5 September 2008, the Peoples Party nominated its co-chairman and chairman of central executive committee, Asif Ali Zardari, for the upcoming presidential election. Zardari secured 481 votes out of 700 votes from the Electoral College of Pakistan, winning the Pakistan&#x27;s presidential election on 5 September 2008. In April 2010, president Zardari voluntarily surrendered his political and presidential powers to prime minister Gillani and the parliament, and through 18th Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan, Zardari transferred the authority of government and political appointments, and powers to exercise the authority of government to prime minister Gillani as part of country&#x27;s road to parliamentary democracy. Even though growing unpopularity, it has managed to maintain a large vote bank in deeper Sindh and South Punjab. On national front, it is currently competing against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and Pakistan Muslim League (N). On 22 June 2012, the PPP nominated Raja Pervez Ashraf was elected as the new Pakistan PM.

As of 2017, according to &quot;The Economist&quot;, the party &quot;has become irrelevant outside their home province of Sindh.&quot;

On 11 April 2022, the PPP formed a coalition government with the PML-N and other parties, electing Shehbaz Sharif as Prime Minister.

== Notable leadership ==
The first socialist and democratic convention attended by the leading 67 left-wing intellectuals who appointed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto as the first and founding chair of the Pakistan Peoples Party. After his execution, the senior party leadership handed over the chairmanship of the party to his wife, Nusrat Bhutto, and held the position into the 1980s. In 1982, Nusrat Bhutto, ill with cancer, was given permission to leave Pakistan for medical treatment and remained abroad for several years. At that point her daughter, Benazir Bhutto, became acting head of the party while Nusrat technically remained its chairman and was referred to as such as late as September 1983. By January 1984, Benazir was being referred to as the party&#x27;s chairman and subsequently secured the legal appointment by the senior leadership of Central Executive Committee at the convention held in 1984. She had been elected chairperson for life, which she remained until her assassination on 27 December 2007. Her nineteen-year-old son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and his father Asif Ali Zardari were appointed party co-chairmen after assassination of Benazir Bhutto on 30 December 2007.

== Current structure and composition ==

The Central Executive Committee of the Pakistan Peoples Party of Pakistan serves as party&#x27;s highest leadership, and apex governing authority, and is primarily responsible for promoting Peoples Party activities, promotion, media campaigning, welfare distribution, public policy and works. The CEC is the supreme parliamentary body in charge of setting out strategies and positions during and after elections. The CEC is currently chaired by Asif Ali Zardari, assisted by additional vice-chairmen, including all the major office bearers of the party. However, the CEC is focused on election campaigning and organizational strategy during the national parliamentary elections, overseeing the media works, ideological promotion, and the foreign policy. The public works, welfare distribution are partly managed at the municipal unit level up to the federal level, which supervise and give legal authority for such works.

The PPP-Young Organization is a youth-led party organisation that attempts to mobilise the youth for Peoples Party candidates for the Youth Parliament. The group&#x27;s Trotskyist-Marxist wing, &quot;The Struggle&quot;, which is internationally affiliated with International Marxist Tendency (IMT) pursues an entryist strategy by working inside party&#x27;s student wing, the Peoples Students, a student-outreach organization with the goal of training and engaging the new generation of the Pakistan Peoples Party. The Peoples Party also has an active military-street wing, the People&#x27;s Committee, controversially affiliated with the Pakistan Peoples Party.

Nationally, each province and territory has a provisional committee, made up of elected committee members as well as ex-officio committee members who elect its presidents. The local committees often coordinate campaign activities within their jurisdiction, oversee local conventions, and in some cases primaries or caucuses, and may have a role in nominating candidates for elected office under state law. All administration, campaign, and party policies required complete permission from the CEC&#x27;s co-chairman and the vice-chairmen.

=== Ideology ===
In its inception, the notable communists from the Communist Party and socialists of the defunct Socialist Party gathered to form the Peoples Party in 1967 by electing Zulfikar Ali Bhutto its first chairman. The Pakistan Peoples Party&#x27;s leftist program remains far more successful and integrated in the civil society than Communist Party.

Since then, the Peoples Party has been a leading proponent of democratic socialism with the mainstream agenda of social democracy, favouring semi-secular and semi-Islamic socialist principles. Historically, the Peoples Party favoured financially stable farmers, industrial labour unions and the middle-class. The Peoples Party rejected far-left politics and ultra-leftism, supporting unregulated business and finance, and &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism, after which it was no longer widely viewed as a socialist or social-democratic party, as its economic policies swung dramatically to the right-wing, embracing economic neoliberalism and unfettered capitalism and privatisation of publicly owned institutions, favouring partial income taxes.

Despite its democratic-socialist ideas, the Peoples Party never actually allied with the Soviet Union, with the Communist Party of Pakistan remaining one of its major rivals. The Peoples Party has been criticised by various socialists such as Fahad Rizwan who accused the Peoples Party of opportunism. Recently, the Peoples Party has adopted privatisation and small-scale nationalisation policies, with centrist economic and socially progressive agendas.

Basic, enshrined principles of PPP include &quot;Islam [as] our Faith. Democracy is our Politics. Socialism is our Economy. All Power to the People&quot;.

=== Issues involving foreign policy ===
Relations with the China, Russia, Iran and Turkey, are the central and the strongest proponents of the People&#x27;s Party&#x27;s foreign policy. Under Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan built closer ties with Soviet Union, China, and Iran, but under Benazir Bhutto, the foreign policy was revised after taking shifts to centre-right policies. Earlier in the 1970s, the People&#x27;s Party faced a &quot;secret&quot; cold war with the United States, but then suffered a US-backed coup in 1977. On the other hand, Anti-Americanism among most PPP workers and its student wing grew twofold after Zulfikar Ali Bhutto&#x27;s execution at the hands of the pro-American Ziaul Haq dictatorship, the party&#x27;s new chairperson, Benazir Bhutto, advised her party to concentrate on the removal of Zia alone. She also adopted Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s conservative privatisation policies in order to secure funding from the United States and the World Bank, but received a harsh opposition from within the party.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawn Newspapers, 2012/01/17&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1980s, the party&#x27;s credibility was damaged by the United States who &quot;keenly sabotaged&quot; any of its efforts and organizational establishment in the dense areas of country. Although PPP leader Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said he did not want to choose one side in the 21st century China-US strategic competition, Hina Rabbani Khar argues that the instinct to preserve Pakistan&#x27;s partnership with the United States would ultimately sacrifice the full benefits of the country&#x27;s “real strategic” partnership with China.

=== Academia ===

The Pakistan Peoples Party through Zulfikar Ali Bhutto proudly receives all credit for launching the atomic bomb project in 1972, public ceremonies are held on &quot;Youm-e-Takbir&quot; (lit. &quot;Day of Greatness&quot;) to commemorate the political services of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto who established the program.
In 1976, Murtaza Bhutto graduated from Harvard University, Bhutto graduated with his thesis entitled &quot;Modicum of Harmony&quot;. His thesis dealt with the spread of nuclear weapons in general, and the implications of India&#x27;s nuclear weapons on Pakistan in particular. Murtaza went on to Christ Church, Oxford, his father&#x27;s alma mater, for a three-year course to read for an MLit degree. Bhutto submitted his master thesis, containing a vast argumentative work on Nuclear strategic studies, where he advocated for Pakistan&#x27;s approach to develop its nuclear deterrence program to counter Indian nuclear program.

Since its establishment, the People&#x27;s Party has produced prolific scientists-turned technocrats, including Farhatullah Babar, Mubashir Hassan, and the senior academic scientists who played a role in building the atomic bomb. The People&#x27;s Party member&#x27;s notably provided their public support to Abdul Qadeer Khan who had been forced to attend the military debriefings by General Pervez Musharraf in 2004. In August 2012, after years of negligence, the peoples party made its effort to bestowed and award Munir Ahmad Khan the highest state honor, the &quot;Nishan-e-Imtiaz&quot;, as a gesture of political rehabilitation; the honor was publicly presented by President Asif Ali Zardari in a public ceremony.

In 1995–1996, the People&#x27;s Party under Benazir Bhutto&#x27;s era opened computer literacy centres to provide the public with access to computers and technology. In 1990, they made Pakistan the first Muslim country to launch a satellite, &quot;Badr-I&quot;, they are also responsible for establishing, nurturing, and funding the missile&#x27;s programs, such as &quot;Ghauri&quot; and &quot;Shaheen&quot; in the 1990s. As part of the science policy, they established the Pakistan Science Foundation in 1973 and helped establish the Pakistan Academy of Letters in 1976. In 1996, Benazir Bhutto established SZABIST at Karachi to become a leading institution of science and technology and appointed world-renowned academic Dr. Javaid Laghari as its first president, who later was also elected Senator from Sindh on a technocrat seat and eventually Chairman HEC leading a revolution of reforms in higher education in South Asia.

== Challenges and controversies ==
=== Lost left and post-secularism ===
Since the 1990s, the People&#x27;s Party has been under intense criticism even inside the party both from its own members and the other leftists in the country, notably due to the charges of large-scale corruptions. The leading leftist, Nadeem Paracha, has asserted that since 1977 the People&#x27;s Party&#x27;s manifesto has been transformed into a centre-right platform, whereas in 1977 parliamentary elections, the People&#x27;s Party&#x27;s manifesto did not mention the word &quot;socialism&quot;. During the 1973–75, the Peoples Party&#x27;s radical ultra-left and communist wings led by Mirage Khalid and the Maoist wings under Khalid Syed were purged by the People&#x27;s Party to ensure the political support of the powerful Sindh&#x27;s feudal lords and Punjab&#x27;s landed elite, with Paracha claiming the People&#x27;s Party has &quot;lost the left&quot;.

Leading left-wing journalist Mehdi Hasan has remarked that the Peoples Party is &quot;not a secular party&quot;, firstly citing its support of declaring Ahmadiyya community as non-Muslims through the second constitutional amendment, secondly for banning the use of liquor, and thirdly for the Peoples Party declaring Friday as a holiday to win the support of religious elements.

=== Kashmir Cause ===
The chairman of PPP Bilawal Bhutto Zardari led a convention on 19 September 2014 in Multan, Punjab, where he reportedly quoted: &quot;the [PPP] would take back entire Kashmir for his country.&quot;

Bhutto emphasized on his last part of the speech: &quot;I will take back Kashmir, all of it, and I will not leave behind a single inch of it because like the other provinces, it belongs to Pakistan. He pledged to continue supporting Kashmiri freedom struggle morally and diplomatically...(.)&quot;.

=== Internal opposition and factionalism ===

Since the 1990s, the factionalism has grown in the party when Murtaza Bhutto returned to Pakistan. Disagreeing with Benazir and Asif Ali Zardari&#x27;s political philosophy brewing the party, Murtaza Bhutto split and formed the more powerful yet more leaning towards left wing faction, Bhuttoist in 1995. Confrontation with Benazir Bhutto in 1999 over the party guidance, Aftab Sherpao splits from the party and forming the Pakistan Peoples Party (Sherpaoist)—a more reformist with libertarian agenda.

Factionalism continued in 2011 when PPP sacked Mahmood Qureshi over the Raymond Davis incident in Lahore. Qureshi later defected to PTI. Another leftist leader, Malik Ali Khan also resigned from the Peoples Party, saying that he &quot;did not agree with how President Zardari was leading the party particularly with regards to an alliance with centre-right PML (Q) and the foreign policy.&quot;

In 2012, the PPP&#x27;s powerful leader, Zulfiqar Mirza, quit from the party despite urgings amidst disagreement with Asif Zardari&#x27;s leadership and policies with regards to dealings with the liberal MQM in Sindh. Reasoning with their isolation, the socialist politicians felt that the party had now moved away from the original ideas it was founded on by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1967. In 2014, Labour leader, Safdar Ali Abbasi, formed the Workers faction amid disagreement with party&#x27;s fiscal policy.

=== Defection in PPP: The Launch of Pakistan People&#x27;s Party Parliamentarian-Patriots ===
The Pakistan People&#x27;s Party Parliamentarian-Patriots (PPPPP) was launched in Lahore in the year 2002 as a &#x27;forward bloc&#x27; that broke away from the PPP to back the Pakistan Muslim League Quaid-e-Azam (PML-Q) transforming itself into Pakistan&#x27;s newest party at that time. The leader of the rebel group was Makhdoom Faisal Saleh Hayat. In January 2017, Former federal minister Syed Faisal Saleh Hayat joined the Pakistan Peoples Party on Monday, more than 14 years after being elected on the PPP ticket in 2002, bringing an end to the PPPPP.

<doc id="408999" wikidata="Q1687846" url="?curid=408999" title="Jerry Kleczka">
<text>Gerald Daniel Kleczka (; November 26, 1943 – October 8, 2017) was an American politician and Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from 1984 to 2005, representing . The district included the city of Milwaukee.

==Life and education==
After graduating from Milwaukee&#x27;s Don Bosco High School, in 1961, he attended the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for two years. Afterward, he served as an accountant and a member of the National Guard.

==Politics==
Kleczka was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly, serving from 1969 to 1974. Later, he was a member of the Wisconsin State Senate from 1975 to 1984. Kleczka was elected to the House in a special election following the death of Representative Clement J. Zablocki, defeating Milwaukee County District Attorney E. Michael McCann in the Democratic primary.

==Tenure in Congress==
While in Congress, Kleczka was a member of the United States House Committee on Ways and Means and later the United States House Committee on the Budget. He was known to be one of the more liberal members of Congress and helped to secure money for many programs for education, poverty relief, and housing improvements.

For his first 10-and-a-half terms, Kleczka represented a district that included most of the southern half of Milwaukee, as well as part of eastern Waukesha County. After the 2000 census, his district was merged with the neighboring 5th District, covering downtown and north Milwaukee and represented by fellow Democrat Tom Barrett. The new 4th was a more compact district located solely in Milwaukee County, and took in all of the city of Milwaukee; it was by far the most Democratic district in Wisconsin. Although it retained Kleczka&#x27;s district number, it was geographically and demographically more Barrett&#x27;s district. However, Barrett opted to run for governor, effectively handing the seat to Kleczka.

The pronunciation of Kleczka&#x27;s name often proved baffling to the uninformed. Rep. Frank Annunzio (D-IL) repeatedly butchered it to the point that an exasperated Kleczka took to calling him &quot;Rep. Annunciation&quot;.

=== Legal issues ===
Kleczka was arrested at least twice for drunk driving while in office. A 1995 arrest for drunken driving — his blood alcohol content was twice the legal limit in Virginia — led him to acknowledge his alcoholism and seek treatment. He credits religion as part of the reason for his recovery and continued to meet regularly with fellow recovering alcoholics.

==Retirement and death==
Kleczka announced his retirement in 2004, and did not run for reelection. He officially retired in January 2005 after ten terms in Congress, and was succeeded by State Senator Gwen Moore, also a Democrat.

After Kleczka retired, he moved to Middleton, Wisconsin, with his wife. Kleczka died on October 8, 2017, from natural causes at a care facility, in the Madison, Wisconsin area.

<doc id="409000" wikidata="Q461497" url="?curid=409000" title="Diane Watson">
<text>Diane Edith Watson (born November 12, 1933) is a former American politician who served as US Representative for , serving from 2003 until 2011, after first being elected in the 32nd District in a 2001 special election. She is a member of the Democratic Party. The district is located entirely in Los Angeles County and includes much of Central Los Angeles, as well as such wealthy neighborhoods as Los Feliz.

A native of Los Angeles, Watson is a graduate of the University of California, Los Angeles, and also holds degrees from California State University, Los Angeles and Claremont Graduate University. She worked as a psychologist, professor, and health occupation specialist before serving as a member of the Los Angeles Unified School Board (1975–78). She was a member of the California Senate from 1978 to 1998, and the US Ambassador to Micronesia from 1999 to 2000.

Watson was elected to Congress in a 2001 special election to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Representative Julian C. Dixon. She was re-elected four times, and retired after the end of the 111th Congress.

==Early life, education and career==

Born in Los Angeles, California, Watson was raised Catholic as the daughter of William Allen Louis Watson and Dorothy Elizabeth O’Neal Watson. According to a DNA analysis, some of her ancestors were from the Central African Republic. She was educated at Dorsey High School, Los Angeles City College and the University of California, Los Angeles, where she earned her BA in Education (1956) and became a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha.

She earned an MS from California State University, Los Angeles in School Psychology (1967) and a PhD in Educational Administration from Claremont Graduate University in 1987. She also attended Harvard Kennedy School at Harvard University.

Watson taught elementary school and was a school psychologist in the Los Angeles public schools. She has lectured at California State University, Long Beach and California State University, Los Angeles. She was a health occupation specialist with the California Department of Education&#x27;s Bureau of Industrial Education, and served on the Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education.

===Early political career===

Watson was elected to the California State Senate from 1978 to 1998. The longtime chair of the Health and Human Services Committee, she gained a reputation as an advocate for health care for the poor and children. She was the first African American woman in the California State Senate. Term limited, she was replaced by Kevin Murray.

When, in 1988, the US government proposed the addition of the category of &quot;bi-racial&quot; or &quot;multiracial&quot; to official documents and statistics, some African American organizations and African American leaders such as Watson and Representative Augustus Hawkins were particularly vocal in their rejection of and opposition to the category. They feared massive defection from the African American self-designation.

In 1992, Watson ran for the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. After a hard-fought campaign that often turned negative, Watson narrowly lost to former Supervisor Yvonne Burke, who was supported by U.S. Representative Maxine Waters.

In 1999, President Bill Clinton appointed her United States Ambassador to Micronesia and she served in the post for two years. She stepped down to run in the April 2001 Democratic primary election, which was called to nominate a candidate to replace Congressman Julian Dixon, who had died in office five months earlier. She won with 33 percent of the vote in a multi-candidate field, then carried the district with 75 percent of the vote in the June 2001 special election.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

;Racism 
In Congress, she became a vocal leader on issues related to racism and xenophobia, supporting reparations for descendants of American slaves, reform of the educational system, subsidies for families lacking health care, and a comprehensive overhaul of the nation’s criminal justice system. She also decried incidents of violence and racism against Arab Americans that she believed were a result of retribution for the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

;Objection to 2004 Presidential Election results
She was one of 31 House Democrats who voted not to count the 20 electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 United States presidential election. President George Bush won the state by 118,457 votes. Without Ohio&#x27;s electoral votes, the election would have been decided by the U.S. House of Representatives, with each state having one vote in accordance with the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

;Opposition to policies of President George W. Bush
Congresswoman Watson supported withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, opposed media consolidation, supported expanding welfare coverage, and opposed President Bush&#x27;s proposal to privatize Social Security. Watson opposed the Bush tax cuts, saying they were unaffordable.

;Cherokee Nation
On the issue of Cherokee Freedmen citizenship in the Cherokee Nation, Watson noted that 20,000 Cherokee lived in California. She opposed the Cherokee Nation&#x27;s March 2007 vote to amend its constitution to limit citizenship to only those descendants with at least one Indian ancestor on the Dawes Roll. She noted that when freedmen were granted citizenship in the tribe in 1866 by a treaty which the Cherokee Nation made with the US government, it was without restriction to those freedmen with Indian ancestry. Appeals to the Cherokee Nation&#x27;s position were pending, in part because the tribe excluded descendants of Cherokee freedmen and intermarried whites from voting on the amendment. In June 2007 Watson introduced a bill to sever US relations with the tribe and revoke its gaming privileges unless the Cherokee Nation restored citizenship in the tribe to descendants of Cherokee freedmen. This drew the ire of several tribal leaders and individuals in Indian Country, accusing her of undermining Native American tribal sovereignty.

;Other issues

In 2006, the &quot;National Journal&quot; ranked Watson as the most liberal member of Congress.

Throughout her career in Congress, she advocated for increased funding and research directed at the HIV/AIDS pandemic. She argued in favor of humanitarian assistance for African nations that had been decimated by the disease.

<doc id="409001" wikidata="Q596275" url="?curid=409001" title="Philadelphia vireo">
<text>The Philadelphia vireo (Vireo philadelphicus) is a small North American songbird in the vireo family (&quot;Vireonidae&quot;). &quot;Vireo&quot; is a Latin word referring to a green migratory bird, perhaps the female golden oriole, possibly the European greenfinch. The specific &quot;philadelphicus&quot; is for the city of Philadelphia.

==Description==
Adults are mainly olive-brown on the upperparts with yellow underparts; they have dark eyes and a grey crown. They have no wing bars and no eye ring. There is a dark line through the eyes and a white stripe just over them. They have thick blue-grey legs and a stout bill. The Philadelphia vireo is similar in appearance to the warbling vireo, but can be reliably distinguished by having much yellower underparts, and dark lores.

==Ecology==

Their breeding habitat is the edges of deciduous and mixed woods across Canada. They make a basket-shaped cup nest in a fork of a tree branch, usually placed relatively high. The female lays 3 to 5 lightly spotted white eggs. Incubation, by both parents, lasts up to 14 days.

These birds migrate to Mexico and Central America. This vireo is a very rare vagrant to western Europe. They are unlikely to visit Philadelphia, except in migration.

They forage for insects in trees, sometimes hovering or flying to catch insects in flight. They also eat berries, especially before migration.

The songs and calls of Philadelphia vireo are three to five notes, &quot;weeezh weeezh weeezh&quot;, very similar to those of the red-eyed vireo,
but with slightly longer pauses between phrases and higher notes.

<text>Lucille Elsa Roybal-Allard (born June 12, 1941) is an American politician who served as a U.S. representative from California from 1993 to 2023. A member of the Democratic Party, she first entered Congress in 1993. Her district, numbered as the 33rd until 2003, the 34th from 2003 to 2013, and the 40th from 2013 to 2023, included much of southern Los Angeles, as well as several eastern suburbs, such as Downey, Bell and Bell Gardens. On December 20, 2021, Roybal-Allard announced her retirement at the end of the 117th Congress.

==Early life, education, and career==
Roybal-Allard was born in Boyle Heights, California, the daughter of Edward R. Roybal, who served in Congress from 1963 to 1993, and Lucille Beserra Roybal. She attended Ramona Convent Secondary School in Alhambra, California, graduating in 1959. She also attended California State University, Los Angeles.

Roybal-Allard was a public relations officer and fund-raising executive. She was also a member of the California State Assembly from 1987 to 1992, first elected on May 12, 1987, in a special election to replace Gloria Molina, who resigned after being elected to the Los Angeles City Council.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

=== Elections ===
In 1992, Roybal-Allard won the Democratic nomination for the newly created 33rd district, which included a sliver of the area her father had represented for 30 years. She won the general election handily and was re-elected 14 times with no substantial opposition in this heavily Democratic, Latino-majority district. Her district was renumbered the 34th after the 2000 census and the 40th after the 2010 census. As of the 2010 census, it is the most Latino district in the nation, with a Latino majority of 86.5%. Until 2013, she represented much of downtown Los Angeles.

=== Tenure ===
Roybal-Allard was the first Latina to serve as one of the 12 &quot;cardinals&quot;, or chairs, of a House Appropriations Subcommittee, as well as the first Latina to serve on the House Appropriations Committee. She is also the first woman to chair the Congressional Hispanic Caucus; the first woman to chair the California Democratic congressional delegation; and the founder of the Women&#x27;s Working Group on Immigration Reform.

Her Sober Truth on Preventing Underage Drinking (STOP) Act has been instrumental in reducing underage drinking and its consequences. From her position on the House Appropriations Committee, she has spearheaded many federal projects that have created jobs and improved her constituents&#x27; lives, including the new federal courthouse in Downtown Los Angeles, the Metro Gold Line Lightrail Eastside Extension, the deepening of the Port of Los Angeles, and the ongoing revitalization of the Los Angeles River.

Roybal-Allard chaired the California Democratic congressional delegation in 1998–1999. She has also been active in the Congressional Children&#x27;s Caucus and on the Democratic Homeland Security and the Livable Communities task forces.

Roybal-Allard was the first Democratic Mexican-American woman to serve in Congress. She and Nydia Velazquez were the third and fourth Latinas elected to Congress, after Barbara Vucanovich and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. She and Velazquez are the first Latina Democrats to serve in that body, and the first two elected to a full term.

Roybal-Allard introduced the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2013 (H.R. 1281; 113th Congress) into the House on March 20, 2013. The bill would amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize grant programs and other initiatives to promote expanded screening of newborns and children for heritable disorders. Roybal-Allard argued that &quot;newborn screening not only transforms and save lives – it saves money.&quot; According to her, in California &quot;newborns are screened for more than 40 preventable and treatable conditions – and for every one dollar California spends on screening, it yields a benefit of over $9 as we prevent disease in children who are diagnosed with these treatable conditions.&quot;

Roybal-Allard is the original House author of The Security and Financial Empowerment (SAFE) Act, a bill designed to ensure that survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking can get help without fearing the loss of their jobs or economic security. Parts of the SAFE Act were included in the House&#x27;s 2019 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). She also authored The Children&#x27;s Act for Responsible Employment (CARE) to address abusive and exploitative child labor practices in agriculture.

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Appropriations
**Subcommittee on Homeland Security (chair)
**Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies

===Caucus memberships===
*Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (associate member)
*Congressional Arts Caucus
*Congressional Progressive Caucus
*House Baltic Caucus
*Medicare for All Caucus
*Congressional Hispanic Caucus

==Political positions==
===Abortion===
As of 2020, Roybal-Allard has a 100% rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America and an F rating from the Susan B. Anthony List for her abortion-related voting record. She opposed the overturning of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, calling it an infringement on a woman&#x27;s right to choose.

==Personal life==

Roybal-Allard is married to Edward Allard III. They have four children, two of whom are Roybal-Allard&#x27;s stepchildren. She is Roman Catholic.

Roybal-Allard&#x27;s archives are in the collection of the California State Archives.
