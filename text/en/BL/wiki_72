<text>The Battle of the Nek () was a minor battle that took place on 7 August 1915, during the Gallipoli campaign of World War I. &quot;The Nek&quot; was a narrow stretch of ridge on the Gallipoli Peninsula. The name derives from the Afrikaans word for a &quot;mountain pass&quot; but the terrain itself was a perfect bottleneck and easy to defend, as had been proven during an Ottoman attack in June. It connected Australian and New Zealand trenches on the ridge known as &quot;Russell&#x27;s Top&quot; to the knoll called &quot;Baby 700&quot; on which the Ottoman defenders were entrenched.

The campaign on the Gallipoli Peninsula had begun in April 1915, but over the following months had developed into a stalemate. In an effort to break the deadlock, the British and their allies launched an offensive to capture the Sari Bair range. As part of this effort, a feint attack by Australian troops was planned at the Nek to support New Zealand troops assaulting Chunuk Bair.

Early on 7 August 1915, two regiments of the Australian 3rd Light Horse Brigade, one of the formations under the command of Major General Alexander Godley for the offensive, mounted a futile bayonet attack on the Ottoman trenches on Baby 700. Due to poor co-ordination and inflexible decision making, the Australians suffered heavy casualties for no gain. A total of 600 Australians took part in the assault, assaulting in four waves; 372 were killed or wounded. Ottoman casualties were negligible.

== Prelude ==
===Geography===
A narrow saddle, the Nek connected the Australian and New Zealand trenches on Walker&#x27;s Ridge at a plateau designated as &quot;Russell&#x27;s Top&quot; (known as Yuksek Sirt to the Ottomans) to the knoll called &quot;Baby 700&quot; (Kilic Bayir), on which the Ottoman defenders were entrenched in what the historian Chris Coulthard-Clark describes as &quot;the strongest position at Anzac&quot;. The immediate area was known to the British and Empire troops as the Anzac sector, and the allied landing site was dubbed Anzac Cove, after the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps. The Nek was between wide; on each side, the ground sloped steeply down to deep valleys below. These valleys were Monash Valley to the south and Malone&#x27;s Gulley to the north.

The name given to the feature by Australian troops – the Nek – derives from the Afrikaans word for &quot;mountain pass&quot; and according to Glenn Wahlert was &quot;likely coined by veterans of the South African war&quot;. The Turkish name for the Nek was Cesarettepe. It was well suited to defence, with no vegetation, and providing the defenders good observation and fields of fire along a narrow frontage. The ground was bare and covered in pot-holes, and on a slight slope. The difficult nature of the terrain had been highlighted earlier in the campaign, initially when a battalion of the Turkish 57th Regiment had suffered heavy casualties during a failed counter-attack in April. After the 19 May Ottoman counter-attack, Major-General Alexander Godley had ordered an attack by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade across the Nek, but Brigadier General Andrew Russell (after whom Russell&#x27;s Top was named) had convinced him to abandon this over concerns of the commanders of both the Wellington and Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiments. Another unsuccessful attack resulting in heavy casualties had been made by the Turkish 18th Regiment across the Nek on the night of 30 June. Despite these incidents, the challenges of attacking the Nek were not fully appreciated by Allied commanders when formulating the plan for the August Offensive.

The Australian line at Russell&#x27;s Top lay just below the Nek and extended . The right of the line lay opposite the Ottoman position across flat ground; it was described by Les Carlyon as a &quot;conventional trench&quot; and was deep enough that wooden hand and footholds had been attached to the wall of the trench to enable the assaulting troops to climb out. On the left of the Australian line, the line sloped away into dead ground where the Australians had established what Carlyon describes as a &quot;ditch without a parapet&quot; that was obscured from view with vegetation and earth.

The Ottoman front line at the Nek consisted of two lines of trenches, with machine guns positioned on the flanks on spur lines, which provided clear fields of fire into no man&#x27;s land in front of the Ottoman position. Behind this another eight trenches existed, tiered along the slopes towards Baby 700. At least five groups of machine guns – approximately 30 altogether – were located in the area, providing direct fire support to the Ottoman troops holding the Nek. These positions were widely dispersed and positioned in depth, at least from the Ottoman front line. The commanders of the two Ottoman regiments occupying positions around the Nek had chosen not to cover their trenches, despite orders from their divisional headquarters, due to concerns that a bombardment would collapse the roofs and block communication through the trenches, similar to what had occurred at Lone Pine.

===Strategic situation and planning===
For the three months since the 25 April landings, the Anzac beachhead had been a stalemate. On 19 May, Ottoman troops had attempted to break the deadlock with a counter-attack on Anzac Cove, but had suffered heavy casualties. In August, an Allied offensive (which later became known as the Battle of Sari Bair) was intended to break the deadlock by capturing the high ground of the Sari Bair range, and linking the Anzac front with a new landing to the north at Suvla. Along with the main advance north out of the Anzac perimeter, supporting attacks were planned from the existing trench positions. Higher-level conceptual planning for the offensive was undertaken by the commander of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, Lieutenant General William Birdwood, and Colonel Andrew Skeen; more detailed tactical planning devolved to other staff. Tactical command of the offensive to secure Sari Bair was given to Godley, who was at the time in command of the New Zealand and Australian Division.

As part of the effort to secure Baby 700, Godley, assisted by Birdwood, planned a breakthrough from the Nek. The official Australian historian Charles Bean writes that concerns about &quot;attacking unaided&quot; meant that plans were made to co-ordinate the attack with other actions. The attack at the Nek was meant to coincide with an attack by New Zealand troops from Chunuk Bair, which was to be captured during the night. The light horsemen were to attack across the Nek to Baby 700 while the New Zealanders descended from the rear from Chunuk Bair onto Battleship Hill, the next knoll above Baby 700. Other attacks were to be made by the 1st Light Horse Brigade at Pope&#x27;s Hill and the 2nd Light Horse Brigade at Quinn&#x27;s Post.

The 3rd Light Horse Brigade was chosen for the attack at the Nek. This formation was commanded by Colonel Frederic Hughes, and consisted of the 8th, 9th and 10th Light Horse Regiments. For the attack, the 8th and 10th would provide the assault troops, while the 9th was placed in reserve. Some of its machine guns, positioned on Turk&#x27;s Point, about from the Nek, would provide direct fire support during the attack. Like the other Australian Light Horse and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles formations, the 3rd Light Horse Brigade had been dispatched to Gallipoli in May as infantry reinforcements, leaving their horses in Egypt. The area around the Nek was held by the 18th Regiment, under the command of Major Mustafa Bey. The regiment formed part of Mustafa Kemal&#x27;s Ottoman 19th Division. The 27th Regiment, under Lieutenant Colonel Sefik Bey, also held part of the line south from the Nek to Quinn&#x27;s Post (Bomba Sirt).

Godley&#x27;s orders for the attack stipulated that the attack would be made with bayonets and grenades only; rifles would be unloaded. This was, according to Roland Perry, designed to &quot;influence the troopers to keep running at the [Ottoman] trenches&quot; and ultimately meant they could not stop and fire. Planners envisaged four waves of troops attacking from Russell&#x27;s Top across the Nek. The first wave would use the cover of a naval bombardment to approach the trenches silently and quickly while the defenders were dazed, and would capture the trench with bayonets and grenades. The second wave would then pass through the first to capture trenches on the lower slopes of Baby 700. The third and fourth waves would exploit further and would dig-in, with ultimate goal of securing the heights away on Baby 700. The British 8th Battalion, Cheshire Regiment, was to consolidate positions on the Nek afterwards, while two companies from the 8th Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers would advance up the western part of Monash Valley and carry out an attack around the &quot;Chessboard&quot; – to the south of the Nek – to cover the southern flank of the Australians on the Nek.

Preparations for the attack began several days earlier when the troopers were ordered to stow unnecessary clothing, including woollen tunics, and equipment. This resulted in the men living in the trenches for several cold nights in just shirts and short pants. Each man was authorised to carry 200 rounds of ammunition, as well as a small amount of personal rations. Assault equipment included wire cutters, empty sandbags, ladders, and periscopes; only the fourth and final assault line would carry entrenching tools. The light horsemen had not participated in a large-scale attack before; they had not been trained to fight like infantrymen, having been recruited to fight in a mounted role, but they were all keen and eager for the attack to commence. Encouraged by earlier efforts by compatriots at Lone Pine, the troops were spurred on by the brigade major, Lieutenant Colonel John Antill, a Boer War veteran who encouraged them with stories from that war. Many soldiers who had been injured or ill, and were in hospital, ensured they were released and returned to their units in time to take part. In this climate, nobody questioned the tactics of the plan, contingencies, or the efficacy of attacking without loaded weapons. Prior to the assault, each man was given a double issue of rum to warm up.

== Battle ==
The attack was scheduled to commence at 04:30 on 7 August. It was to be preceded by a naval bombardment, supported by field guns from several shore based batteries. The 8th and 10th Light Horse Regiments assembled in a trench about long, opposite the Ottoman line that was between away. Coloured marker flags were carried, to be shown from the captured trenches to indicate success. To help the supporting artillery to identify the attacking Australian troops, the attackers attached white armbands and patches to their shirts.

On the morning of 7 August, it was clear that the prerequisites for the attack had not been met. The initial concept of operations for the August offensive required a simultaneous attack from the rear of Baby 700, thereby creating a hammer and anvil effect on the Ottoman trenches caught in between this pincer movement. Because the New Zealand advance on Chunuk Bair had been held up and failed to reach Chunuk Bair, the troops assaulting the Nek would have to do so alone if the attack was to continue. The New Zealanders had made some progress, though, having captured the lower part of Rhododendron Spur and it was hoped that Chunuk Bair could still be carried; as a result, Birdwood and Skeen decided it was important for the attack on the Nek to proceed as a feint – rather than a pincer – to assist the New Zealanders at Chunuk Bair, while the Australians and Indians from other formations also attacked Hill 971. British troops were also landing at Suvla Bay, having commenced their operation the night before (6 August).

A further part of the plan required an attack from Steele&#x27;s Post through several tunnels against German Officers&#x27; Trench by the Lieutenant Colonel Gordon Bennett&#x27;s 6th Battalion (2nd Infantry Brigade of the Australian 1st Division). The Ottoman machine guns sited there enfiladed the ground in front of Quinn&#x27;s Post and the Nek and the 6th Battalion&#x27;s attack was conceived as a preliminary supporting move to suppress Ottoman fire onto the Nek to assist the 3rd Light Horse Brigade&#x27;s. Planners had requested that this attack be conducted simultaneously with the attack at the Nek, but Birdwood had decided it should be conducted prior. The failure of this attack meant that Ottoman machine guns supporting the 18th Regiment around the Nek remained intact. Nonetheless, Birdwood declared that the 3rd Light Horse Brigade&#x27;s attack was to proceed, albeit with some modifications. This would see the Australian light horsemen become the right flank of the assault on Chunuk Bair, linking in with the New Zealand Infantry Brigade on Rhododendron Spur.

Following the decision to proceed, at 04:00 field artillery and howitzers began firing from the beachhead around Anzac Cove onto the Ottoman trenches around the Nek. These guns were then joined by several warships, including a destroyer, which opened fire on the Nek and other positions around Baby 700. This continued at a steady and deliberate rate until 04:27, when the intensity rose. Due to the proximity of the two sides&#x27; trenches, the shells mostly landed behind the first line of Ottoman trenches. Bean describes the bombardment as the heaviest since 2 May; but Carlyon notes that no battleships were assigned to the shelling due to the proximity of the Australian trenches, and describes it as &quot;&#x27;desultory&#x27; and a &#x27;joke&#x27;&quot;, citing an officer from the 9th Light Horse Regiment, who were in reserve for the attack.

According to Bean, owing to a failure to co-ordinate timings, the field artillery preparation of the forward positions ceased at 04:23, although the naval guns continued to engage some of the depth targets. While the original plan had been for the attack to begin as soon as the artillery had stopped, local commanders did not adjust their plans following the early cutoff of preparatory fires and the attack was not launched until the appointed time of 04:30. After the artillery firing ceased, no-one in the assaulting force knew if the bombardment was to continue. It was later discovered that the synchronisation of watches between the artillery officer and the assault officer was overlooked. As the attack was not launched as soon as the bombardment ceased, but instead held back until the planned time of 04:30, the Ottoman defenders had ample time to return to their trenches – which were largely undamaged – and prepare for the assault that they now knew was coming. 

At the appointed time, the first wave of 150 men from the 8th Light Horse Regiment, led by their commander, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Henry White, &quot;hopped the bags&quot; and went over the top. They were met with a hail of machine gun and rifle fire and, within 30 seconds, White and all of his men were gunned down. A few men reached the Ottoman trenches, where they began to hurl grenades and marker flags were reportedly seen flying around the south-eastern corner of the Ottoman trench line, but the men were quickly overwhelmed by the Ottoman defenders.

At this stage, the futility of the effort became clear to those in the second wave and, according to Carlyon, the attack should have been called off at this point. The second wave of 150 followed the first without question two minutes later and met the same fate, almost all the men being cut down by heavy rifle and machine gun fire before they got halfway to the Ottoman trench. This contrasted with the simultaneous attack by the 2nd Light Horse Regiment (1st Light Horse Brigade) at Quinn&#x27;s Post, against the Ottoman trench system known as &quot;The Chessboard&quot;, which was abandoned after 49 out of the 50 men in the first wave became casualties. In this case, the regiment&#x27;s commander had not gone in the first wave and so was able to make the decision to cancel further attacks.

As the third wave, consisting of men from the 10th Light Horse Regiment, began assembling in the forward trench, two Ottoman field artillery pieces began firing into no man&#x27;s land. Lieutenant Colonel Noel Brazier, commander of the 10th Light Horse Regiment, attempted to have the third wave cancelled. He was unable to find Hughes – who had moved to an observation post – and instead found Antill. A strong personality, Antill exerted a large amount of influence within Hughes&#x27; command, and had a personal dislike of Brazier, who he felt was being insubordinate in questioning orders. Antill had received the reports that marker flags, implying success, had been sighted. This report of marker flags was subsequently confirmed in a Turkish article published after the war, where it was stated by the commander of the Turkish 27th Regiment that a couple of men with a marker flag reached the Ottoman trench and raised the flag, but were killed. Antill had not checked the scene to establish if it was of any use to send the next wave, nor did he confirm if the marker flags were still in place, and after heated words with Brazier issued the order for the third wave to proceed without referring the matter to Hughes. Without being able to speak to Godley, who was at his headquarters on the beach, Brazier returned to the forward Australian position at Russell&#x27;s Top and gave the order for the third wave to attack, telling them &quot;Sorry, lads, but the order is to go&quot;.

The assault by the third wave was launched at 04:45, and came to a quick end as before. Brazier made another attempt to reason with Antill, as did the 10th Light Horse Regiment&#x27;s second-in-command, Major Allan Love. Again Antill ordered the men forward. This time, Brazier conferred with several majors and then went forward to find Hughes, who called off the attack. Meanwhile, the troops assigned to the fourth wave assembled on the fire-step of the forward Australian trench; amidst much confusion the right hand side of the line charged before Hughes&#x27; order could reach them. The troops on the left followed them shortly afterwards, but according to Bean many of them adopted a more cautious approach, &quot;keeping low and not running&quot;.

Briefly, Hughes entertained detaching a force via Monash Valley to support the British attack towards the &quot;Chessboard&quot; but this was eventually abandoned. In the aftermath, the ridge between Russell&#x27;s Top and the Turkish trenches was covered with dead and wounded Australian soldiers, most of whom remained where they fell for the duration of the war. Recovering the wounded during the daylight proved largely impossible and many of those who lay injured on the battlefield succumbed in the intense heat. Some troops that had fallen into defiladed positions were recovered, but mostly the wounded had to wait until night. Under the cover of darkness, stretcher bearers were able to venture out to recover some of the wounded, others of whom were able to crawl back to the Australian trenches. A total of 138 wounded were saved. Of these, one who had been wounded in the ankle made it back to Australian lines two nights later; he was among three men to have made it to the Ottoman firing line on the right. Another Australian, Lieutenant E.G. Wilson, is known to have reached the left trench where he was killed by an Ottoman grenade.

== Aftermath ==
A further consequence of the failure to call off the attack at the Nek was that the supporting attack by two companies of the Royal Welch Fusiliers was launched from the head of Monash Valley, between Russell&#x27;s Top and Pope&#x27;s Hill, against the &quot;Chessboard&quot; trenches. Sixty-five casualties were incurred before the attack was aborted around 06:00. The Australians charged with unloaded rifles with fixed bayonets and were unable to fire; in contrast the volume of fire they faced was, according to Bean, the most intense the Australians faced throughout the war. Of the 600 Australians from the 3rd Light Horse Brigade who took part in the attack, the casualties numbered 372; 234 out of 300 men from the 8th Light Horse Regiment, of whom 154 were killed, and 138 out of the 300 men from the 10th, of whom 80 were killed. The Ottoman losses were negligible; Bean notes that the Ottomans suffered no losses during the assault, but afterwards a &quot;large number ... who continued to expose themselves after the attack ... were certainly shot by [Australian] machine guns&quot; from Turk &#x27;s Point (to the north of Walker&#x27;s Ridge and the Nek) and Pope&#x27;s Hill (to the south). Ottoman losses are placed at around twelve dead.

In analysing the battle, Carlyon writes that the attack failed due to poor planning and appreciation of the ground by Birdwood, Godley and Skeen. John Hamilton writes that in the aftermath, some Australians nicknamed the battleground &quot;Godley&#x27;s abattoir&quot;, holding him responsible for the losses. Perry writes that Godley &quot;on the beach and out of touch, was most culpable&quot;, although Carlyon highlights command deficiencies within the Australian brigade as being a key factor, focusing on the role of Hughes and Antill in the decision to continue the attack. Bean, while noting higher-level conceptual errors by Birdwood and Skeen, also concludes that the local commanders were &quot;chiefly responsible&quot; for the large-scale loss of life at the Nek. Carlyon questions why Godley did not heed the lessons highlighted by the Ottoman attack over the same ground on 30 June, pointing out that the Australians were at several disadvantages – attacking up hill, in daylight and against stronger defences – compared to the Ottoman attack on 30 June. He also contrasts Hughes and Antill&#x27;s unquestioning approach with that of Brigadier General Harold Walker, who was ordered to attack Lone Pine despite his own protests but who critically analysed the problem to give his soldiers the best chance of success.

Bean wrote that the attack was &quot;one of the bravest actions in the history of war&quot;, but in terms of its wider impact, according to Carlyon the attack gained no ground and served no strategic purpose. Coulthard-Clark concludes that &quot;at most, the bold display by the light horsemen at the Nek may have impeded for a few hours – but did not prevent – the transfer of Turkish reinforcements towards Chunuk Bair, where the New Zealanders were also engaged in a desperate struggle&quot;. Ultimately, the August Offensive failed to break the deadlock and it proved to be the last major attack launched by the Allied forces on the peninsula. Before it concluded, elements of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade – the 9th and 10th Light Horse Regiments – took part in another costly attack during the Battle of Hill 60. As winter arrived in October, the Allies made plans to evacuate their troops from Gallipoli beginning in December 1915. One of the final Allied offensive actions took place at the Nek during the evacuation when, on 20 December, a large mine was detonated under the Nek by Allied troops, killing 70 Ottoman defenders.
Efforts were made by the Australians to recover their dead throughout the months following the battle, the 20th Battalion managing to recover the bodies of several men from the first wave, including White in October. Most were unrecoverable during the campaign. When Australian Commonwealth burial parties returned to the peninsula in 1919 after the war&#x27;s end, the bones of the dead light horsemen were still lying thickly on the small piece of ground. The Nek Cemetery now covers most of no-man&#x27;s land of the tiny battlefield and contains the remains of 316 Australian soldiers, most of whom fell during the 7 August attack; only five could be identified. Trooper Harold Rush of the 10th Light Horse Regiment died in the third wave. His body was one of the few identified, and he is buried in Walker&#x27;s Ridge Cemetery. His epitaph famously reads: &quot;His last words, Goodbye Cobber, God bless you&quot;.

On 25 November 1915, shortly before the decision to completely withdraw from the peninsula, Godley was temporarily promoted to lieutenant general and appointed corps commander. After the evacuation (he left the day before the rest of his troops), in recognition of his services at Gallipoli, he was made Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, second highest of the seven British orders of chivalry.

Post war, the belief that the main reason for the failure of the assault was due to a delay between the artillery bombardment and the attack being launched has been challenged. In 2017, author Graham Wilson discussed the delay at length, analysing various accounts of the assault. In doing so, he reached the conclusion that there are few accounts supporting the idea and opined that there had been no delay between the bombardment ending and the assault being launched. Instead, Wilson contends that reason for the high casualties amongst the attackers was likely due to the barrage itself being ineffective. He argues that due to the close proximity of the Allied and Ottoman trenches, the supporting artillerymen had likely been concerned about injuring the light horsemen forming up for the attack and had as such laid their guns behind the Ottoman forward defensive positions, meaning that when the assault began the troops in these lines were quickly able to return to their firing positions.

==Portrayals in media==

In the aftermath of the battle, Bean covered the fighting at the Nek in a September 1915 article for &quot;The Argus&quot; that was heavily censored. A January 1916 report by the British commander during the Gallipoli campaign, General Ian Hamilton, provided limited details and was, according to Carlyon, very optimistic in its assessment. Godley&#x27;s autobiography devoted only two sentences to the battle. Post-war, the battle formed the basis of a chapter in the second volume of Bean&#x27;s official history.

The battle is depicted in the climax of Peter Weir&#x27;s movie, &quot;Gallipoli&quot; (1981), although it inaccurately portrays the offensive as a diversion to reduce Ottoman opposition to the landing at Suvla Bay. The battle is also depicted in the &quot;Gallipoli&quot; miniseries, episode 5: &quot;The Breakout&quot; (air date 2 March 2015). The episode was reviewed for the &quot;Honest History &quot; website by Peter Stanley.

<doc id="406544" wikidata="Q333448" url="?curid=406544" title="Bhaichung Bhutia">
<text>Bhaichung Bhutia (born 15 December 1976), also spelled as Baichung Bhutia, is an Indian former professional footballer who played as a striker. Bhutia is considered as the torchbearer of Indian football in the international arena. He is often nicknamed the &quot;Sikkimese Sniper&quot; because of his shooting skills in football. Three-time Indian Player of the Year I. M. Vijayan described Bhutia as &quot;God&#x27;s gift to Indian football&quot;.

Bhutia has had four spells at then I-League side East Bengal FC, the club where he started his career. When he joined English club Bury in 1999, he became the first Indian footballer to sign a contract with a European club and only the second to play professionally in Europe, after Mohammed Salim. Afterwards he had a short loan spell at the Malaysian football club Perak FA. He has also played for JCT Mills, which won the league once during his tenure; and Mohun Bagan, which failed to win the league once during his two spells, in his native India. His international footballing honours include winning the Nehru Cup, LG Cup, SAFF Championship three times and the AFC Challenge Cup. He is also India&#x27;s second most capped player, with 80 international caps to his name. He is also India&#x27;s second youngest international goal scorer after Jerry Zirsanga when he scored his first goal against Uzbekistan in 1995 Nehru cup at the age of 18 years 90 days.

Off the field, Bhutia is known for winning the reality television programme &quot;Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa&quot;, which caused much controversy with his then-club Mohun Bagan, and for being the first Indian athlete to boycott the Olympic torch relay in support of the Tibetan independence movement. Bhutia, who has a football stadium named after him in honour of his contribution to Indian football (first player to have such honour while he is still playing), has also won many awards, such as the Arjuna Award and the Padma Shri.

In October 2010, he founded Bhaichung Bhutia Football Schools in Delhi in partnership with football by Carlos Queiroz and Nike. In August 2011, Bhutia announced his retirement from international football. His farewell match was with the India national team on 10 January 2012 against Bayern Munich at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Delhi.

Bhutia contested in the general election of All India Football Federation (AIFF) for the president post; lost 33–1 to Kalyan Chaubey. He also served as president of the Sikkim Football Association.

== Early life ==
Bhaichung Bhutia was born in an agricultural family. Both of his parents were farmers in Sikkim and were originally not keen on Bhutia&#x27;s interest in sports. His father died in his childhood, but after encouragement from his uncle, Karma Bhutia, he started his education at St. Xavier&#x27;s School, Pakyong, Sikkim. At the age of nine he won a football scholarship from SAI to attend the Tashi Namgyal Academy in Gangtok.

Bhutia went on to play for several schools and local clubs in his home state of Sikkim, including the Gangtok-based Boys Club, which was managed by Karma. His performance at the 1992 Subroto Cup, where he won the &quot;Best Player&quot; award, brought him to the notice of the football establishment. Former India goalkeeper Bhaskar Ganguly spotted his talent and helped him make the transition to Calcutta football. In addition to football, Bhutia also represented his school at badminton, basketball, and athletics.

== Club career ==

=== Kolkata and Europe ===
In 1993, at the age of sixteen, Bhutia left school to join the professional East Bengal F.C. in Kolkata. Two years later, he transferred to JCT Mills in Phagwara, which went on to win the India National Football League in the 1996–97 season. Bhutia was the top goalscorer in the league, and was chosen to make his international debut in the Nehru Cup. He was named &quot;1996 Indian Player of the Year&quot;.

In 1997, Bhutia returned to East Bengal. He has the distinction of scoring the first hat-trick in the local derby between East Bengal and Mohun Bagan, when he registered one in East Bengal&#x27;s 4–1 victory in the 1997 Federation Cup semi-final. He became team captain in the 1998–99 season, during which East Bengal finished second behind Salgaocar in the league. Furthermore, he became the 19th footballer to receive the Arjuna Award in 1999, which the Government of India gives out to athletes to recognise their &quot;outstanding achievements&quot; in national sports.

=== Bury ===

Bhutia has had limited opportunities in playing overseas. On 30 September 1999, he travelled overseas to play for Bury in Greater Manchester, England. He became only the second Indian footballer to play professionally in Europe after Mohammed Salim. By penning a three-year contract he also became the first Indian footballer to sign for a European club. This followed unsuccessful trials for Bhutia with Fulham, West Bromwich Albion and Aston Villa. He had difficulty in obtaining a visa and could not make his debut, until 3 October 1999 against Cardiff City. In that match, he came on as a substitute for Ian Lawson and played a part in Bury&#x27;s second goal, which was scored by Darren Bullock after Bhutia&#x27;s volley was deflected into his path. On 15 April 2000, he scored his first goal in the English league in the game against Chesterfield. A recurring knee injury limited him to only three games in his final season at Bury, and he was released after the club was placed in administration. His final appearance was a 3–0 defeat to Swindon Town on 27 August 2001.

=== Return to India ===
In 2002, Bhutia returned to India and played for Mohun Bagan for a year. However, this was largely unsuccessful as he was injured early in the season and failed to play again that season, missing Mohun Bagan&#x27;s only trophy win; the All Airlines Gold Cup.

Afterwards, Bhutia again returned to the East Bengal Club, helping them to win the ASEAN Club Championship.

He scored a goal in the final, a 3–1 win over Tero Sasana, and was named the &quot;man of the match&quot;. He finished as the top scorer of the Championship with nine goals. He also scored in the 1–1 draw against Petrokimia Putra and scored five goals in a 6–0 win against Philippine Army in the same tournament.

Bhutia signed up to play for Perak FA, the Malaysian championship club, from August to October 2003 on loan and returned to East Bengal Club for the regular season. However, his stint at Perak FA ended in a 3–1 defeat against Sabah FA in the Malaysia Cup semi-finals, after which Bhutia described himself as the &quot;villain of the piece&quot;.

In the 2003–04 season, Bhutia scored 12 goals as East Bengal won the league by four points from second-placed Dempo. During the 2004–05 season, Bhutia scored nine goals for East Bengal, which finished in third place behind SC Goa and champions Dempo. He continued to play for East Bengal until the end of the 2005–06 season. In his final season there he was awarded the &quot;Player of the National Football League&quot; by the All India Football Federation (AIFF) in a season where he scored 12 goals. Despite this, East Bengal finished runners-up to Mahindra United in the league.

=== Back to Malaysia ===
In 2005, Bhutia signed for another Malaysian club, Selangor MK Land. He made five appearances only, scoring one goal, as the club had monetary problems. Before, he received an offer from then Home United manager Steve Darby, but rejected the offer. Darby later revealed that he failed to sign Bhutia because the offer he made was less than what he was getting in India that time.

===Mohun Bagan===

On 15 June 2006, he joined Mohun Bagan and formed an attacking partnership with Jose Ramirez Barreto. However, the 2006–07 season was a poor one for Bhutia and Mohun Bagan as they finished eighth in the league, just one position above relegation. During the 2007–08 season (the league was now known as the I-League), Bhutia scored 10 goals in 18 matches, and Mohun Bagan finished slightly higher in the league in fourth place. Bhutia won the Indian Player of the Year for the second time in 2008. In winning the award, he became only the second footballer to win it more than once; the other was I. M. Vijayan. In the 2008–09 season, despite a 10-match winning streak, Mohun Bagan finished in second place behind Churchill Brothers because of a final day loss to Mahindra United. Bhutia finished the season with six goals.

On 18 May 2009, Bhutia announced he would quit Mohun Bagan, due to the questioning of his footballing commitment by the club&#x27;s officials. As a result of the Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa incident, he was suspended for six months by Mohun Bagan. Bhutia was quoted saying &quot;It is just a ploy to keep me at Mohun Bagan for another season. But I will not play for them any more.&quot;

=== East Bengal (IV) ===
Bhutia was reported to have officially signed for East Bengal on 22 June 2009, on a one-year contract, announcing that he would end his playing career at the club. Upon signing for East Bengal, Bhutia declared it to be his homecoming, &quot;This is really my homecoming. This is the club from where it all started and it is here where it is going to end.&quot; The situation was further complicated, however, as Mohun Bagan&#x27;s general secretary Anjan Mitra said &quot;Our contract with Bhaichung is perfectly legal and he has one more year left with us.&quot; Bhutia&#x27;s lawyer Usha Nath Banerjee countered this, &quot;I doubt the legality of Bagan&#x27;s contract. In any case, according to FIFA and AIFF rules, a player who is above 28 years of age is free to make a choice of club in the third year of his contract&quot;. Bhutia and Mohun Bagan were set to meet on 17 August in the AIFF headquarters to settle their differences with AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco. On 29 August, it was announced that the issue had not been resolved yet and the outbound Colaco was set to meet Bhutia on 30 August. No compromise was reached, however, and on 5 September former additional solicitor general Amrendra Sharan was appointed to look into the dispute. On 10 September, Bhutia filed defamation charges, claiming damages of 10 million, against Mohun Bagan for &quot;trying to tarnish his reputation&quot;. Bhutia was granted interim relief on 26 September, but the case between Mohun Bagan and Bhutia is set to continue until a final verdict is reached. On 4 November, it was revealed that Mohun Bagan had approached football&#x27;s governing body FIFA to intervene in the dispute with Bhutia.

The start of the 2010–11 season would be without Bhutia until the end of January as the India national team prepared and participated in the Asian Cup from November to January. Though laid low by injuries in recent months, Bhutia believes he would return next season after taking a three-month break and if he ever decides to quit, he would do it from East Bengal.

=== United Sikkim ===
In 2011, Bhutia joined United Sikkim as a player-coach.

===Final stint at East Bengal===
On 12 February 2015, it was announced that Bhutia would return to East Bengal for the final time on a half-season contract, after which he would retire from professional football. Having retired from India colours in 2011 against South Korea in the AFC Asian Cup, Bhutia last season said he wished to retire donning red and gold colours &quot;one last time&quot;.

&quot;But I don&#x27;t see that happening. I am really struggling with my knee injury and not in a shape to play the top-tier I-League for East Bengal. You can say that I am not going to play club again,&quot; Bhutia told reporters at the launch of East Bengal&#x27;s residential academy in BA-CA ground in Salt Lake.

== International career ==

Bhaichung made his senior international debut in the Nehru Cup against Thailand at the age of 19 on 10 March 1995. Bhutia scored for India against Uzbekistan in the 1995 Nehru Cup becoming India&#x27;s youngest ever goalscorer, at 19. In the 1997 SAFF Championship, India beat the Maldives 5–1 in the final, Bhutia was responsible for one goal. Two years later, the tournament was held in Goa and India successfully defended their title by beating Bangladesh 2–0 in the final. Bhutia scored the second goal for India after Bruno Coutinho opened the scoring and Bhutia was named as the tournament&#x27;s most valuable player.

He also netted two goals in the final of the 2002 LG Cup held in Vietnam, in which India beat the host nation 3–2, Bhutia&#x27;s goals came either side of half-time. The football tournament of the 2003 Afro-Asian Games saw India finish as runners-up behind Uzbekistan. Bhutia scored two goals in the tournament, both of which came in the 5–3 semi-final win over Zimbabwe. In the 2007 Nehru Cup, Bhutia scored a penalty in a 6–0 victory over Cambodia in the opening match of the tournament. He also scored in a 1–0 win over Bangladesh and a 3–0 win over Kyrgyzstan. Bhutia played a significant part in the final as he was involved in the build-up to N. P. Pradeep&#x27;s winning goal against Syria during which India won 1–0 to become champions.

The next successful SAFF Championship was in 2005 where Bhutia was captain, in the group stages he scored a goal in a 3–0 victory over Bhutan but did not score in the other two matches. India progressed to the semi-finals during which Bhutia played in the 1–0 win over the Maldives. The final was a repeat of the 1999 final, as Bangladesh were the opposition, and once again India triumphed 2–0 during which Bhutia scored the second goal in the 81st minute from close range after Mehrajuddin Wadoo&#x27;s 33rd-minute opener. He received the award for the Most Valuable Player and also the Fair Play trophy. The 2008 SAFF Championship started with a 4–0 win over neighbouring Nepal, Bhutia scored the second goal in the 34th minute. It turned out to be Bhutia&#x27;s only goal of the tournament, however, he did have several chances to score in the semi-final against Bhutan which saw India win 2–1 to reach the final. In the final, India failed to defend their title after losing 1–0 to the Maldives.
He scored twice in a 2–1 victory in the 2008 AFC Challenge Cup against Turkmenistan to reach the semi-finals. The &quot;Sikkimese Sniper&quot; scored a goal in the final against Tajikistan, during which India won 4–1 thanks to a Sunil Chhetri hat-trick; the victory also allowed them to automatically qualify for the 2011 AFC Asian Cup. He was also selected as the most valuable player of the tournament, finishing with three goals.

The 2009 Nehru Cup was significant for Bhutia, as he earned his 100th cap for India in a 2–1 win over Kyrgyzstan, becoming the first Indian player to reach this milestone. He also scored the first goal in this match to help the team recover from their opening day defeat to Lebanon. In the match against Sri Lanka, Bhutia again scored an opening goal which helped India to win 3–1 and solidified their chances of reaching the final. He was adjudged as the &quot;man of the match&quot; for his performance. Bhutia missed the final match of the round-robin, as India were already guaranteed a spot in the deciding match. He was also adjudged as &quot;Player of the Tournament&quot; for his stellar performances in all of the matches, including the decider where they beat Syria in a penalty shootout.

At the 2011 AFC Asian Cup in Qatar, Bhutia was injured for their first two games against Australia and Bahrain, but he came on as a second-half substitute against South Korea, but failed to save India, losing 4–1 as they were eliminated. Shortly after the Asian Cup, he announced his retirement for India on 24 August 2011 with a record of 40 goals in 104 appearances.

==Farewell match==
== Managerial career ==
On 13 November 2012, Bhutia was named the interim manager of United Sikkim to replace Belgian Philippe De Ridder, after the club&#x27;s heavy 1–10 defeat in an I-League match against Prayag United on 10 November 2012 at the Salt Lake Stadium. In January 2018, leading up to the Santosh Trophy, he was appointed the manager of Sikkim.

==Other careers==

=== Entertainment ===
==== Jhalak Dikhlaa Jaa ====
In 2009, partnering with choreographer Sonia Jaffer, he won the third season of &quot;Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa&quot;, the Indian version of the international series &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. Bhutia earned Rs. 4 million for winning the competition, beating Karan Singh Grover and Gauahar Khan in the final. Bhutia donated half of the prize money to charity and the other half was shared with his choreographer; he also said some money would go towards areas hit by Cyclone Aila. It was reported that an &quot;SMS Voting Frenzy&quot; allowed him to win after many organisations in Sikkim conducted mass voting events (this involved participants buying mobile cash cards so they could vote via SMS) to increase Bhutia&#x27;s chance of winning the trophy. This performance put Bhutia&#x27;s relationship with his club Mohun Bagan in jeopardy, as he missed a friendly, as well as practice sessions, due to his participation in the reality show.

===Politics===
In 2014, Bhutia joined the Trinamool Congress and unsuccessfully contested the 2014 Indian general election from Darjeeling constituency. In 2021 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election he supported Left Front in favor of veteran Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Ashok Bhattacharya.

===Other===
Bhutia comes from a buddhist background, although he is, by conviction, not religious - in fact an atheist. The name &quot;Bhaichung&quot; literally means &quot;little brother&quot;. He married his longtime girlfriend Madhuri Tipnis, a hotel professional, on 30 December 2004 in his native village of Tinkitam in South Sikkim. They filed for divorce by mutual consent in Bandra court on in February 2015. His fictional hero is Howard Roark, a character from Ayn Rand&#x27;s novel &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, and he has a tattoo of a footballer on his arm. The Sikkimese government has built a stadium, the Bhaichung Stadium in Namchi, the district headquarters, in honour of Bhutia. He is one of the most popular figures in the state and is considered as a role model to many Sikkimese as well to people from other states of India. On 23 January 2008, Bhutia was nominated for the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award, for his contribution to Indian football. Three days later on 26 January, India&#x27;s Republic Day, he was chosen for the Padma Shri along with national swimming champion Bula Choudhury. 

He played in the &quot;Goal 4 Africa&quot; match held in the Allianz Arena, Munich, on 12 July 2008, for the &quot;Edu&quot; team, led by Clarence Seedorf, and scored twice. In 2009, Bhutia started a foundation called the &quot;Indian Sports Foundation&quot; to help footballers overcome serious injuries. He is also the president of the Football Players&#x27; Association of India (FPAI), an organisation that promises &quot;fair treatment&quot; of Indian footballers by dealing with financial aspects such as pension plans. He formed FPAI after seeing the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association in England.

He signed an endorsement deal with Adidas India Marketing Pvt. Ltd in November 2003. Currently he is endorsing Nike India. After completing the deal to become the brand&#x27;s ambassador for India, Bhutia said &quot;I am confident that Nike will help elevate the sport in the country.&quot;

In 2008, Bhutia was solicited to run with the Olympic torch in India, but he refused to carry the torch to show support for the Tibetan independence movement. &quot;I sympathise with the Tibetan cause. I&#x27;m against violence but I thought I should stand by the Tibetan people in their fight,&quot; Bhutia said. He was the first Indian sportsman to refuse to carry the Olympic torch. His actions have won him little praise from his colleagues in India however, who criticised him for mixing sports with politics.

In 2011, Bhutia was caught in the Sikkim earthquake. Although he was not injured, his United Sikkim offices were completely destroyed. In the aftermath, he joined with several Bollywood actors like Neha Dhupia and Rahul Bose to raise money for earthquake victims.

In 2018, after the break up with All India Trinamool Congress, he established a new party on 31 May. The name of the party is &quot;Hamro Sikkim Party&quot;. He also served as brand ambassador of sport equipments manufacturer Vector X.

=== Bhaichung Bhutia Football Schools ===
On 28 October 2010, he started Bhaichung Bhutia Football Schools in Delhi in partnership with Carlos Queiroz. BBFS also entered into partnership with United Sikkim and Garhwal FC for opening up coaching camps with grassroot framework in hilly areas of Sikkim and West Bengal in 2013.

<doc id="406549" wikidata="Q335535" url="?curid=406549" title="Yellow-breasted bunting">
<text>The yellow-breasted bunting (Emberiza aureola) is a passerine bird in the bunting family Emberizidae that is found across the Boreal and East Palearctic. The genus name &quot;Emberiza&quot; is from Old German &quot;Embritz&quot;, a bunting. The specific &quot;aureola&quot; is Latin for &quot;golden&quot;. The bird&#x27;s call is a distinctive &quot;zick&quot;, and the song is a clear &quot;tru-tru, tri-tri&quot;.

Until 2004, the International Union for Conservation of Nature considered the yellow-breasted bunting to be a species of least concern. Since 2004, it has been gradually upgraded to a status of Critically Endangered due to rapid drops in population sizes. It is subject to heavy hunting pressure in China, through which most specimens pass during migration.

== Description ==
The yellow-breasted bunting is a small passerine, ranging from in length, and weighing . For a bunting, it is large and rather stocky.

The breeding male has bright white underparts with black flank streaks, brown upperparts, black face and throat bar, and a pink lower mandible. The female has a heavily streaked grey-brown back, and less intensely yellow underparts. She has a whitish face with dark crown, eye and cheek stripes. The juvenile is similar, but the background colour of the underparts and face is buff.

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Emberiza aureola aureola&quot; breeds in boreal forests of Finland to Bering Sea migrating to Indochina. &quot;Emberiza aureola ornata&quot; breeds from the Amur River to Manchuria, N Korea, Kamchatka and Kuril Islands. It is migratory, wintering in south-east Asia, India, and North Korea. It is a rare but regular wanderer to western Europe. There are also ~4 records from the Aleutian Islands of Alaska and a 2017 record from Labrador, Canada. The species winters in large flocks in cultivated areas, rice fields and grasslands, preferring to roost in rice-fields.

In the first third of 2023, roosts of up to 6,378 birds were found in reedbeds at Kyon Ka Pyin-Tap Seik Conservation Area, in the Irrawaddy Delta, Myanmar, exceeding previous known maxima for the species in southern Asia.

==Breeding==
The yellow-breasted bunting breeds in open scrubby areas that consist of dry water rice fields for foraging and reedbeds for roosting, often near water, and is present in Siberia. It lays four to six eggs in a nest on the ground. Its food consists of insects when feeding young, and otherwise seeds.

== Conservation ==
Populations have declined precipitously since the early 2000s, and the species is now considered to be critically endangered. The decline of the yellow-breasted bunting is likely to be caused by substantial trapping during migration and most specifically at winter sites. Birds are flushed then caught in mist-nets, to be sold for consumption as &quot;sparrows&quot; or &quot;rice birds&quot;. Even though the actions have been restricted to a small area in southern China, it has become more widespread and popular to increasing wealth, and hunters now travel long distances to find sufficient birds.

<text>Applied linguistics is an interdisciplinary field which identifies, investigates, and offers solutions to language-related real-life problems. Some of the academic fields related to applied linguistics are education, psychology, communication research, information science, natural language processing, anthropology, and sociology. Applied linguistics is a practical use of language.

== Domain ==
Applied linguistics is an interdisciplinary field. Major branches of applied linguistics include bilingualism and multilingualism, conversation analysis, contrastive linguistics, language assessment, literacies, discourse analysis, language pedagogy, second language acquisition, language planning and policy, interlinguistics, stylistics, language teacher education, forensic linguistics, culinary linguistics, and translation.

== History ==
The tradition of applied linguistics established itself in part as a response to the narrowing of focus in linguistics with the advent in the late 1950s of generative linguistics, and has always maintained a socially-accountable role, demonstrated by its central interest in language problems.

Although the field of applied linguistics started in Europe and the United States, the field rapidly flourished in the international context.

Applied linguistics first concerned itself with principles and practices on the basis of linguistics. In the early days, applied linguistics was thought as &quot;linguistics-applied&quot; at least from the outside of the field. In the 1960s, however, applied linguistics was expanded to include language assessment, language policy, and second language acquisition. As early as the 1970s, applied linguistics became a problem-driven field rather than theoretical linguistics, including the solution of language-related problems in the real world. By the 1990s, applied linguistics had broadened including critical studies and multilingualism. Research in applied linguistics was shifted to &quot;the theoretical and empirical investigation of real-world problems in which language is a central issue.&quot;

In the United States, applied linguistics also began narrowly as the application of insights from structural linguistics—first to the teaching of English in schools and subsequently to second and foreign language teaching. The &quot;linguistics applied&quot; approach to language teaching was promulgated most strenuously by Leonard Bloomfield, who developed the foundation for the Army Specialized Training Program, and by Charles C. Fries, who established the English Language Institute (ELI) at the University of Michigan in 1941. In 1946, Applied linguistics became a recognized field of study at the aforementioned university. In 1948, the Research Club at Michigan established &quot;Language Learning: A Journal of Applied Linguistics&quot;, the first journal to bear the term &quot;applied linguistics.&quot; In the late 1960s, applied linguistics began to establish its own identity as an interdisciplinary field of linguistics concerned with real-world language issues. The new identity was solidified by the creation of the American Association for Applied Linguistics in 1977.

== Associations ==
The International Association of Applied Linguistics was founded in France in 1964, where it is better known as Association Internationale de Linguistique Appliquée or AILA. AILA has affiliates in more than thirty countries, some of which are listed below.

=== Australia ===
Australian applied linguistics took as its target the applied linguistics of mother tongue teaching and teaching English to immigrants. The Australian tradition shows a strong influence of continental Europe and of the US, rather than of Britain. Applied Linguistics Association of Australia (ALAA) was established at a national congress of applied linguists held in August 1976. ALAA holds a joint annual conference in collaboration with the Association for Applied Linguistics in New Zealand (ALANZ).

=== Canada ===
The Canadian Association of Applied Linguistics / L&#x27;Association Canadienne de Linguistique appliquée (CAAL/ACLA), is an officially bilingual (English and French) scholarly association with approximately 200 members. They produce the &quot;Canadian Journal of Applied Linguistics&quot; and hold an annual conference.

=== Ireland ===
The Irish Association for Applied Linguistics/Cumann na Teangeolaíochta Feidhmí (IRAAL) was founded in 1975. They produce the journal &quot;Teanga&quot;, the Irish word for &#x27;language&#x27;.

=== Japan ===
In 1982, the Japan Association of Applied Linguistics (JAAL) was established in the Japan Association of College English Teachers (JACET) to engage in activities on a more international scale. In 1984, JAAL became an affiliate of the International Association of Applied Linguistics (AILA).

=== New Zealand ===
The Applied Linguistics Association of New Zealand (ALANZ) produces the journal &quot;New Zealand Studies in Applied Linguistics&quot; and has been collaborating with the Applied Linguistics Association of Australia in a combined annual conference since 2010, with the Association for Language Testing and Assessment of Australia and New Zealand (ALTAANZ) later joining the now three-way conference collaboration.

=== South Africa ===
The Southern African Applied Linguistics Association (SAALA) was founded in 1980. There are currently four publications associated with SAALA including the &quot;Southern African Linguistics and Applied Language Studies Journal&quot; (SAJALS).

=== United Kingdom ===
The British Association for Applied Linguistics (BAAL) was established in 1967. Its mission is &quot;the advancement of education by fostering and promoting, by any lawful charitable means, the study of language use, language acquisition and language teaching and the fostering of interdisciplinary collaboration in this study [...]&quot;. BAAL hosts an annual conference, as well as many additional smaller conferences and events organised by its Special Interest Groups (SIGs).

=== United States ===
The American Association for Applied Linguistics (AAAL) was founded in 1977. AAAL holds an annual conference, usually in March or April, in the United States or Canada.

== Journals ==

Major journals of the field include &quot;Research Methods in Applied Linguistics&quot;, &quot;Annual Review of Applied Linguistics&quot;, &quot;Applied Linguistics&quot;, Studies in Second Language Acquisition, &quot;Applied Psycholinguistics&quot;, &quot;International Review of Applied Linguistics in Language Teaching&quot;, &quot;International Journal of Applied Linguistics&quot;, &quot;Applied Linguistics Review&quot;, &quot;European Journal of Applied Linguistics&quot;, &quot;Language Learning&quot;, &quot;Language and Education, &quot;System&quot;, TESOL Quarterly&quot;, &quot;International Journal of Language Studies&quot;, and &quot;Linguistics and Education&quot;.

<text>Rhodes is an Inner West suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Rhodes is located 12 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Canada Bay. It was formerly part of Concord Municipality until a merger with Drummoyne Council to form Canada Bay in December 2000. 

Rhodes sits on a peninsula between Bray Bay and Homebush Bay, on the southern bank of the Parramatta River and is located about 3 kilometres from Sydney Olympic Park.

Since 2016, Rhodes has been connected to the residential suburb of Wentworth Point, on the western side of Homebush Bay, by the Bennelong Bridge.

==Description==
Rhodes is roughly separated into three sections by the Main North railway line and the A3 arterial road, both of which run north–south and cross the Parramatta River at Rhodes.

The eastern section, east of Concord Road (which forms the A3 in this section), is predominantly single family detached houses and parkland. It features two residential streets, Cropley Street and Llewellyn Street, which front the Parramatta River.

The central section, between the Concord Road and the Main Northern railway line, is mixed commercial, single family detached dwelling residential, warehouse/office developments and community facilities. It includes: Rhodes Corporate Park, built on the site of the former Tullochs Phoenix Iron Works; two office blocks with some retail opposite the station; the Rhodes NSW Fire Brigades station (staffed by retained as opposed to full-time officers); single dwelling residences; the former Rhodes Public School (now a community centre); a Coptic Orthodox church and facilities; the Masonic Aged Care Hostel; warehouse/office development along the river; and the First Yaralla Sea Scouts.

The western section, west of the railway line, features new developments on the former chemical and industrial sites, and includes: the Rhodes Waterside Shopping Centre; many new (2007) apartment blocks; and a public foreshore walkway with two small parks (one incomplete Jan 2010). This area was planned by the NSW Government under Sydney Regional Environment Plan No 29.

==History==
Rhodes was named after the home of an early resident, Thomas Walker (1791–1861), which was built on the north-eastern side of the peninsula. Walker named his property &quot;Rhodes&quot; after his grandmother&#x27;s home, &quot;Rhodes Hall&quot;, in Leeds, England. The house was demolished in 1919, when the land was purchased by the John Darling Flour Mills, later owned by Allied Feeds Limited.

Industry invaded the once picturesque and heavily forested isthmus in 1911 when Messrs. G &amp; C. Hoskins established a large foundry specialising in the manufacture of cast iron pipes for gas and city water reticulation purposes. In 1930 their operations moved to Port Kembla, and in 1935 the site was taken over by CSR. During the period from about 1930 to the mid-1980s, the western part of the suburb between Homebush Bay and the railway line was taken up by chemical manufacturing.

The main manufacturers were Berger Paints, CSR Chemicals, Union Carbide, and Allied Feeds.

The former Tulloch Limited Phoenix Iron Works were located between the railway line and Concord Road, south of Mary Street. They gave their name to Tulloch Avenue and Phoenix Avenue. This is now the site of the Hewlett-Packard offices in Sydney. Tullochs manufactured rolling stock for the New South Wales Government Railways.

On November 29, 1986 an explosion at ICI&#x27;s Rhodes plant sent a ball of fire and chemicals over an area 100 by 50 metres. Five men were burned to death and 21 others were injured. 

In October 2010, the City of Canada Bay approved a plan which would allow up to 5 buildings of 25 storeys in this Western section. The expected population in this western section is over 11,000, making it one of the most densely populated areas of Sydney outside the CBD. There are no facilities for organised active recreation or school education within this area.

===Major remediation===

With the exception of the area bounded by Mary, Walker, Marquet and Gauthorpe Streets, almost all of the land on the western side of the railway line has needed remediation. Most of the sediments along the sea wall from Oulton Avenue to the northern tip of the peninsula also require(d) remediation. The balance of the bay remains contaminated by numerous chemicals including phthalates, dioxins, lead, heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (coal tars), but to a lesser extent than the areas closer to the sea wall on the eastern shore of the bay.

The remediation of the former Union Carbide site, the former Allied Feeds site and a strip of heavily dioxin contaminated sediments in Homebush Bay, have been the subject of extensive analysis, investigations and community activism, including by the Rhodes Peninsula Group. The remediation is approved and monitored by the Department of Planning &amp; Environment with extensive community consultation. A strip of sediment in Homebush Bay between 40 and 100 metres wide and about 850 metres long along the eastern foreshore is being excavated and processed by direct thermal desorption and incineration to remove dioxins and other volatile organics. The remediation proposals were subject to a Parliamentary Inquiry by the NSW Standing Committee on State Development Committee. The remediation was completed in February 2011.

The former Berger Paints site near Oulton Avenue, and the CSR Chemicals / Orica Chemicals site on the southern side of Mary Street west of the railway, were also remediated. The Rhodes Waterside Shopping centre is located on the former Berger Paints site. Apartments are being developed on the former Orica Chemicals site, with commercial buildings along the railway line. Apartments are being developed on the former Union Carbide site and the former Allied Feeds site.

== Heritage listings ==
Rhodes has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Main Northern railway: Meadowbank Rail Bridge over Parramatta River
* Blaxland Road: Rhodes railway station

==Transport==
===Railway===
Rhodes railway station is on the T9 Northern Line of the Sydney Trains network. The station is about 30 minutes from the Sydney central business district by rail.

===Buses===
Busways and Transit Systems provide services along Concord Road and Rider Boulevard. The Baylink Shuttle provides services along Gauthope Street and Walker Street.

===Road Network and bridges===
The Ryde Bridge links Rhodes to Ryde, across the Parramatta River. Rhodes is on a major north–south road system through the suburbs of Sydney, the A3. It is close to two main east–west links, Victoria Road to the north and the M4 Western Motorway/Parramatta Road/City West Link to the south.

====Bennelong Bridge====
The Bennelong Bridge across Homebush Bay for buses, emergency services, cyclists and pedestrians opened in May 2016 from Gauthorpe Street in Rhodes to Footbridge Boulevarde in Wentworth Point. The bridge will affect access by boats into the southern part of the bay and its potential use for recreational sailing, although kayaking would be less affected except near the Rhodes shore.

===Cycleways===
A number of Council and Roads &amp; Maritime Services cycleways run through Rhodes, predominantly along Llewellyn and Walker Streets, joined by Leeds Street and an underpass under Ryde Bridge. There are shared paths along the Homebush Bay foreshore (incomplete in 2010) and immediately to the west of the railway behind the shopping centre and offices in Rider Boulevarde. Cycleways run west to Silverwater Bridge and on to Parramatta on both sides of the river. John Whitton Bridge, which is the former railway bridge joining Rhodes and Meadowbank, has a cycleway and pedestrian walkway. There are links to the cycleway running predominantly along the Cooks River to Botany Bay.

===Proposed ferry wharf===
In 2015, Transport for NSW proposed adding a Rhodes ferry wharf to the Parramatta River line. Safety concerns resulted in the project being deferred in 2016. The project is still in planning stages as of August 2023.

==Commercial areas==

Rhodes features a mixture of single dwelling residential, high density residential, major retail developments such as Rhodes Waterside (including IKEA, ALDI, Coles Supermarkets, Bing Lee, Reading Cinemas and a Kmart), Rhodes Central which has Woolworths Supermarkets and McDonald&#x27;s as its anchor tenants, commercial, warehouse/office developments and community facilities.

There are a number of commercial buildings in the Rhodes Redevelopment Area west of the railway, mainly in Rider Boulevarde, housing substantial businesses such as Australian Associated Press. The Rhodes Corporate Park developed by Australand is located at the corner of Concord Road and Homebush Bay Drive on the eastern side of the railway line and includes businesses such as Citibank and Nestle.

==Residential areas==

While nearly all of the residential areas on the eastern side of the railway line are low to medium density of one or two storeys, the residential area on the western side of the railway line is high density, with most of the area zoned for high density residential development with buildings of four to eight storeys. There is an area of mixed high density residential and business opposite the railway station in Walker Street. The original planning instrument for the Rhodes Redevelopment Area provided for over 7,500 people to live west of the railway line in Rhodes, but with 2009/10 Council amendments, the projected population is now over 11,000 when redevelopment is completed.

==Community==

Rhodes has one of the last Fire &amp; Rescue NSW stations staffed wholly by paid volunteers in inner metropolitan Sydney. It was established on land owned by the McIlwaine family, (for whom McIlwaine Park is named). Three generations of the McIlwaine family have been Captain of the Brigade. The fire station is located on Concord Road near the intersection with Mary Street on the eastern side of the peninsula.

First Yaralla Sea Scouts has a hall near Ryde Bridge. The hall was rebuilt in brick after the original hall was destroyed by fire. Dragon boat paddling also takes place from this site. The Concord Rhodes Open Sailing Club (now Concord Ryde Sailing Club) operated from King George V park until relocated to Waterview Street Putney (near Yaralla Street) to allow for the building of the duplication of Ryde Bridge.

Rhodes Community Centre is located in Blaxland Road in the former two teacher Rhodes Primary School buildings. Most primary school children in the area now attend Concord West Public School, Strathfield North Public School or Saint Ambrose at Concord West. A community building is planned for the central Homebush Bay foreshore park on the western side of the peninsula and is expected to be completed in 2012.

There is an aged care hostel in Cavell Avenue, built largely on the former Rhodes Public School playground. A Coptic Orthodox church has been built on the site of a former church of another denomination, and additional parish facilities added.

Rhodes Residents Association has represented the community, particularly to local government, for over 20 years. Rhodes Peninsula Group also represents community interests in relation to the Rhodes Remediation and Redevelopment and associated issues and infrastructure.

==Parramatta River at Rhodes==
The river is generally regarded as safe for secondary contact such as sailing. The river around Rhodes is used by rowing crews for training, predominantly in early mornings, late afternoons and on weekends. Sailing from Concord and Ryde Sailing Club can be seen in the distance from McIlwaine and Brays Bay Parks at Rhodes on Saturdays from 1 September to 30 April. Dragon boating is available from near Yaralla Sea Scouts near Ryde Bridge. There is a boat ramp at the northern end of Blaxland Road. There are other ramps at Wharf Road, West Meadowbank and on the eastern side of Silverwater Bridge on the southern side of the river. 
Fishing is banned in all of Homebush Bay (including from Rhodes and Wentworth Point).

===Proposed Wentworth Point marina===
Transport for NSW, a New South Wales Government agency, owns most of the land on Wentworth Point north of Burroway Road on both sides of Hill Road. Transport for NSW has announced plans for a major boat storage facility with complementary maritime facilities.

===Fire===
The Rhodes community is protected by the Rhodes, Concord and Ryde Fire Brigades. Rhodes Fire Brigade is one of only three remaining Retained (paid volunteer) Fire Brigades in inner Sydney. Rhodes Fire Brigade celebrated its 90th anniversary in 2011.

==Parks==

There are a number of foreshore parks in the eastern part of the suburb, including McIlwaine Park, King George V Park, Brays Bay Reserve (which contains the Oliveto restaurant), and Rhodes/Rotary Park. Concord and Ryde Sailing Club was based in King George V Park until construction of the second Ryde Bridge required its demolition, after which the club premises were relocated to Kissing Point in Ryde.

The Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway, which connects Brays Bay Reserve with Concord Hospital, is a memorial to those killed in Papua New Guinea on the Kokoda Track during World War II.

Rhodes features a foreshore path and cycleway, which links to an extensive network of foreshore parks in Sydney. (See Transport above)

<text>The State Corporation for Space Activities &quot;Roscosmos&quot;, commonly known simply as Roscosmos (), is a state corporation of the Russian Federation responsible for space flights, cosmonautics programs, and aerospace research.

Originating from the Soviet space program founded in the 1950s, Roscosmos emerged following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. It initially began as the Russian Space Agency, which was established on 25 February 1992 and restructured in 1999 and 2004 as the Russian Aviation and Space Agency and the Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos), respectively. In 2015, the Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos) was merged with the United Rocket and Space Corporation, a government corporation, to re-nationalize the space industry of Russia, leading to Roscosmos in its current form.

Roscosmos is headquartered in Moscow, with its main Mission Control Center in the nearby city of Korolyov, and the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center located in Star City in Moscow Oblast. Its launch facilities include Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, the world&#x27;s first and largest spaceport, and Vostochny Cosmodrome, which is being built in the Russian Far East in Amur Oblast. Its director since July 2022 is Yury Borisov.

As the main successor to the Soviet space program, Roscosmos&#x27; legacy includes the world&#x27;s first satellite, the first human spaceflight, and the first space station (Salyut). Its current activities include the International Space Station, wherein it is a major partner. On 22 February 2019, Roscosmos announced the construction of its new headquarters in Moscow, the National Space Centre. Its Astronaut Corps is the first in the world&#x27;s history.

== History ==


The Soviet space program did not have central executive agencies. Instead, its organizational architecture was multi-centered; it was the design bureaus and the council of designers that had the most say, not the political leadership. The creation of a central agency after the reorganization of the Soviet Union into the Russian Federation was therefore a new development. The Russian Space Agency was formed on 25 February 1992, by a decree of President Yeltsin. Yuri Koptev, who had previously worked with designing Mars landers at NPO Lavochkin, became the agency&#x27;s first director.

In the early years, the agency suffered from lack of authority as the powerful design bureaus fought to protect their own spheres of operation and to survive. For example, the decision to keep Mir in operation beyond 1999 was not made by the agency, but by the private shareholder board of the Energia design bureau. Another example is that the decision to develop the new Angara rocket was rather a function of Khrunichev&#x27;s ability to attract resources than a conscious long-term decision by the agency.

=== Crisis years ===
The 1990s saw serious financial problems due to the decreased cash flow, which encouraged the space agency to improvise and seek other ways to keep space programs running. This resulted in the agency&#x27;s leading role in commercial satellite launches and space tourism. Scientific missions, such as interplanetary probes or astronomy missions during these years played a very small role, and although the agency had connections with the Russian aerospace forces, its budget was not part of Russia&#x27;s defense budget; nevertheless, the agency managed to operate the Mir space station well past its planned lifespan, contributed to the International Space Station, and continued to fly Soyuz and Progress missions.

In 1994, Roscosmos renewed the lease on its Baikonur cosmodrome with the government of Kazakhstan.

=== 2000: Start of ISS cooperation ===
On 31 October 2000, a Soyuz spacecraft lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome at 10:53 a.m. Kazakhstan time. On board were Expedition One Commander William M. (Bill) Shepherd of NASA and cosmonauts Sergei Krikalev and Yuri Gidzenko of Roscosmos. The trio arrived at the International Space Station on 2 November, marking the start of an uninterrupted human presence on the orbiting laboratory.

=== 2004–2006: Improved situation ===
In March 2004, the agency&#x27;s director Yuri Koptev was replaced by Anatoly Perminov, who had previously served as the first commander of the Space Forces.

The Russian economy boomed throughout 2005 from high prices for exports, such as oil and gas, the outlook for future funding in 2006 appeared more favorable. This resulted in the Russian Duma approving a budget of 305 billion rubles (about US$11 billion) for the Space Agency from January 2006 until 2015, with overall space expenditures in Russia total about 425 billion rubles for the same time period. The budget for 2006 was as high as 25 billion rubles (about US$900 million), which is a 33% increase from the 2005 budget. Under the current 10-year budget approved, the budget of the Space Agency shall increase 5–10% per year, providing the space agency with a constant influx of money. In addition to the budget, Roscosmos plans to have over 130 billion rubles flowing into its budget by other means, such as industry investments and commercial space launches. It is around the time US-based &quot;The Planetary Society&quot; entered a partnership with Roscosmos.
* New science missions: Koronas Foton (launched in January 2009, lost in April 2010), Spektr R (RadioAstron, launched in July 2011, retired in May 2019), Intergelizond (2011?), Spektr RG (Roentgen Gamma, launched 2019, one of two telescopes operational), Spektr UV (Ultra Violet, planned 2030), Spektr M (planned 2030), Celsta (2018?) and Terion (2018?)
* Resumption of Bion missions with Bion-M (2013)
* New weather satellites Elektro L (launched in January 2011) and Elektro P (2015)

=== 2006–2012 ===

The federal space budget for the year 2009 was left unchanged despite the global economic crisis, standing at about 82 billion rubles ($2.4 billion). In 2011, the government spent 115 billion rubles ($3.8 bln) in the national space programs.

The proposed project core budget for 2013 to be around 128.3 billion rubles. The budget for the whole space program is 169.8 billion rubles. ($5.6 bln).
By 2015, the amount of the budget can be increased to 199.2 billion rubles.

Priorities of the Russian space program include the new Angara rocket family and development of new communications, navigation and remote Earth sensing spacecraft. The GLONASS global navigation satellite system has for many years been one of the top priorities and has been given its own budget line in the federal space budget. In 2007, GLONASS received 9.9 billion rubles ($360 million), and under the terms of a directive signed by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin in 2008, an additional $2.6 billion will be allocated for its development.

; Space station funding issues 
Due to International Space Station involvements, up to 50% of Russia&#x27;s space budget is spent on the crewed space program . Some observers have pointed out that this has a detrimental effect on other aspects of space exploration, and that the other space powers spend much lesser proportions of their overall budgets on maintaining human presence in orbit.

Despite the considerably improved budget, attention of legislative and executive authorities, positive media coverage and broad support among the population, the Russian space program continues to face several problems. Wages in the space industry are low; the average age of employees is high (46 years in 2007), and much of the equipment is obsolete. On the positive side, many companies in the sector have been able to profit from contracts and partnerships with foreign companies; several new systems such as new rocket upper stages have been developed in recent years; investments have been made to production lines, and companies have started to pay more attention to educating a new generation of engineers and technicians.

; 2011 New director
On 29 April 2011, Perminov was replaced with Vladimir Popovkin as the director of Roscosmos. The 65-year-old Perminov was over the legal age for state officials, and had received some criticism after a failed GLONASS launch in December 2010. Popovkin is a former commander of the Russian Space Forces and First Deputy Defense Minister of Russia.

=== 2013–2016: Reorganization of the Russian space sector ===
As a result of a series of reliability problems, and proximate to the failure of a July 2013 Proton M launch, a major reorganization of the Russian space industry was undertaken. The United Rocket and Space Corporation was formed as a joint-stock corporation by the government in August 2013 to consolidate the Russian space sector. Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin said &quot;the failure-prone space sector is so troubled that it needs state supervision to overcome its problems.&quot;
Three days following the Proton M launch failure, the Russian government had announced that &quot;extremely harsh measures&quot; would be taken &quot;and spell the end of the [Russian] space industry as we know it.&quot;
Information indicated then that the government intended to reorganize in such a way as to &quot;preserve and enhance the Roscosmos space agency.&quot;

More detailed plans released in October 2013 called for a re-nationalization of the &quot;troubled space industry&quot;, with sweeping reforms including a new &quot;unified command structure and reducing redundant capabilities, acts that could lead to tens of thousands of layoffs.&quot; According to Rogozin, the Russian space sector employs about 250,000 people, while the United States needs only 70,000 to achieve similar results. He said: &quot;Russian space productivity is eight times lower than America&#x27;s, with companies duplicating one another&#x27;s work and operating at about 40 percent efficiency.&quot;

Under the 2013 plan, Roscosmos was to &quot;act as a federal executive body and contracting authority for programs to be implemented by the industry.&quot;

In 2016, the state agency was dissolved and the Roscosmos brand moved to the state corporation, which had been created in 2013 as the United Rocket and Space Corporation, with the specific mission to renationalize the Russian space sector.

=== 2017–2021 ===
In 2018, Russian President Vladimir Putin said &quot;it &#x27;is necessary to drastically improve the quality and reliability of space and launch vehicles&#x27; ... to preserve Russia&#x27;s increasingly threatened leadership in space.&quot; In November 2018 Alexei Kudrin, head of Russian financial audit agency, named Roscosmos as the public enterprise with &quot;the highest losses&quot; due to &quot;irrational spending&quot; and outright theft and corruption, under the leadership of Igor Komarov who was terminated in May 2018 in favour of Rogozin.

In 2020 Roscosmos under Rogozin reneged on its participation in Lunar Gateway, a NASA-led project that will see a lunar orbiter spaceport for the moon. It had previously signed an agreement in September 2017 with the Americans.

In March 2021, Roscosmos signed a memorandum of cooperative construction of a lunar base called the International Lunar Research Station with the China National Space Administration.”

In April 2021, Roscosmos announced that it will be departing the ISS program after 2024. In its place, it was announced that a new space station (Russian Orbital Service Station) will be constructed starting in 2025.

In June 2021 Rogozin complained that sanctions imposed in the wake of the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea were hurting Roscosmos.

In September 2021, Roscosmos announced its revenue and net income, losing 25 billion roubles and 1 billion roubles respectively in 2020, due to the reduction of profit from foreign contracts, an increase in show-up pay, stay-at-home days and personnel health expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Roscosmos, these losses would also impact the corporation for the next two years. In October, Roscosmos placed the tests of rocket engines in the engineering bureau of chemical automatics in Voronezh on hold for one month to deliver 33 tons of oxygen to local medical centers, as part of aid for the COVID-19 pandemic.

In December 2021, the Government of Russia confirmed determination of the agreement with Roscosmos for development of next-gen space systems, the document been provided for the officials in July 2020.

Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, Roscosmos launched nine rockets in 2022 and 7 in the first half of 2023.

In early March 2022, Roscosmos under Rogozin suspended its participation in the ESA&#x27;s Kourou, French Guiana spaceport in a tit-for-tat move over the sanctions imposed in the wake of the Russian invasion. As well Rogozin said he would suspend delivery of the RD-181 engine which is used for the Northrop Grumman Antares-Cygnus space cargo delivery system.

In late March 2022, the European Space Agency (ESA) suspended cooperation with Roscosmos in the ExoMars rover mission because of the Russian invasion, and British satellite venture OneWeb signed contracts with ISRO and SpaceX to launch its satellites after friction had developed &quot;with Moscow&quot; and Roscosmos, its previous orbit service provider. The friction had developed over Rogozin&#x27;s command that OneWeb needed to ditch its venture capital investment from the UK government.

On 2 May 2022, Rogozin announced that Roscosmos would terminate its involvement in the ISS with 12 months&#x27; notice as stipulated in the international contract that governs the satellite. This followed the 3 March 2022 announcement that Roscosmos would cease cooperation on scientific experiments at the Spacelab, and the 25 March 2022 announcement by Rogozin that &quot;cooperation with Europe is now impossible after sanctions over the Ukraine war.&quot;

Rogozin was removed from his job as CEO in July 2022, and replaced with Yury Borisov, who seemed to stabilize the relationship with the ISS partners, especially NASA. One complaint against Rogozin was his risky words about terminating the ISS agreement over the war in Ukraine, which he broadcast as early as April 2022. At one point in time NASA had bought 71 return trips on Soyuz for almost $4 billion over six years.

The global space-launch services market was valued at $12.4 billion in 2021 and was forecast to reach $38 billion by decade&#x27;s end. An American academic wrote that in the wake of the Russian invasion, Roscosmos&#x27; share of that market was likely to decline in favour of new entrants such as Japan and India, as well as commercial entrants like SpaceX and Blue Origin.

In June 2023, Roscosmos held a campaign to recruit volunteers for the Uran Battalion, a militia for the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In October 2023, Borisov announced the need for 150 billion rubles to build the Russian space station in the next three years. At completion in 2032, it will have absorbed 609 billion rubles.

In February 2024, at the 2023 AGM, Borisov announced the loss of 180 billion rubles in export revenues, chiefly engine sales and launch services, because of the Western hostility to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Roscosmos had lost 90% of its launch service contracts since the advent of the war.

Roscosmos and Russia&#x27;s space industry are facing significant challenges. The country is on track to conduct its fewest orbital launches since 1961. As of August 15, 2024, only nine launches had occurred, a sharp decline partly attributed to the loss of Western customers following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. Roscosmos has reported financial losses of 180 billion rubles ($2.1 billion) due to canceled contracts. The agency&#x27;s first deputy director indicated it may not achieve profitability until 2025.

=== Future plans ===
From 2024 on Roscosmos headquarters will be located in the new National Space Center in the Moscow district of Fili.

== Current programs ==

=== ISS involvement ===

Roscosmos is one of the partners in the International Space Station program. It contributed the core space modules Zarya and Zvezda, which were both launched by Proton rockets and later were joined by NASA&#x27;s Unity Module. The Rassvet module was launched aboard and is primarily used for cargo storage and as a docking port for visiting spacecraft. The Nauka module is the final planned component of the ISS, launch was postponed several times from the initially planned date in 2007, but attached to ISS in July 2021.

Roscosmos is responsible for expedition crew launches by Soyuz-TMA spacecraft and resupplies the space station with Progress space transporters. After the initial ISS contract with NASA expired, Roscosmos and NASA, with the approval of the US government, entered into a space contract running until 2011, according to which Roscosmos will sell NASA spots on Soyuz spacecraft for approximately $21 million per person each way, thus $42 million to and back from the ISS per person, as well as provide Progress transport flights, at $50 million per Progress as outlined in the Exploration Systems Architecture Study. Roscosmos announced that according to this arrangement, crewed Soyuz flights would be doubled to 4 per year and Progress flights doubled to 8 per year beginning in 2008.

Roscosmos has provided space tourism for fare-paying passengers to ISS through the Space Adventures company. As of 2009, six space tourists have contracted with Roscosmos and have flown into space, each for an estimated fee of at least $20 million (USD).

Continued international collaboration in ISS missions has been thrown into doubt by the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and related sanctions on Russia, although resupply missions continued in 2022 and 2023.

=== Scientific programs ===

Roscosmos operates a number of programs for Earth science, communication, and scientific research on the International Space Station. Roscosmos operates one science satellite (Spektr-RG) and no interplanetary probes, as of 2024. Future projects include the Soyuz successor, the Prospective Piloted Transport System, scientific robotic missions to one of the Mars moons as well as an increase in Lunar orbit research satellites to one (Luna-Glob).
* Luna-Glob Moon orbiters and landers, Luna 25 launched in 2023 crashed onto the moon. 
* Venera-D Venus lander, planned for 2029
* Fobos-Grunt Mars mission, lost in low Earth orbit in 2011 and crashed back to earth in 2012 
* Mars 96 Mars mission, lost in low Earth orbit in 1996

=== Rockets ===
Roscosmos uses a family of several launch rockets, the most famous of them being the R-7, commonly known as the Soyuz rocket that is capable of launching about 7.5 tons into low Earth orbit (LEO). The Proton rocket (or UR-500K) has a lift capacity of over 20 tons to LEO. Smaller rockets include Rokot and other Stations.

Currently rocket development encompasses both a new rocket system, Angara, as well as enhancements of the Soyuz rocket, Soyuz-2 and Soyuz-2-3. Two modifications of the Soyuz, the Soyuz-2.1a and Soyuz-2.1b have already been successfully tested, enhancing the launch capacity to 8.5 tons to LEO.

==== Operational ====
==== Under development ====
=== New piloted spacecraft ===

One of Roscosmos&#x27;s projects that was widely covered in the media in 2005 was Kliper, a small lifting body reusable spacecraft. While Roscosmos had reached out to ESA and JAXA as well as others to share development costs of the project, it also stated that it will go forward with the project even without the support of other space agencies. This statement was backed by the approval of its budget for 2006–2015, which includes the necessary funding of Kliper. However, the Kliper program was cancelled in July 2006, and has been replaced by the new Orel project. , no crafts were launched.

=== Space systems ===

&quot;Resurs-P&quot; is a series of Russian commercial Earth observation satellites capable of acquiring high-resolution imagery (resolution up to 1.0 m). The spacecraft is operated by Roscosmos as a replacement of the Resurs-DK No.1 satellite.

Create HEO space system &quot;Arctic&quot; to address the hydrological and meteorological problems in the Arctic region and the northern areas of the Earth, with the help of two spacecraft &quot;Arktika-M&quot; and in the future within the system can create a communications satellite &quot;Arktika-MS&quot; and radar satellites &quot;Arktika-R.&quot;

The launch of two satellites &quot;Obzor-R&quot; (Review-R) Remote Sensing of the Earth, with the AESA radar and four spacecraft &quot;Obzor-O&quot; (Review-O) to capture the Earth&#x27;s surface in normal and infrared light in a broad swath of 80 km with a resolution of 10 meters. The first two satellites of the projects planned for launch in 2015.

Gonets: Civilian low Earth orbit communication satellite system. On 2016, the system consists of 13 satellites (12 Gonets-M and 1 Gonets-D1).

=== Suffa Space Observatory ===
In 2018, Russia agreed to help build the Suffa observatory in Uzbekistan. The observatory was started in 1991, but stalled after the fall of the USSR.

=== Gecko mating experiment ===
On 19 July 2014, Roscosmos launched the Foton-M4 satellite containing, among other animals and plants, a group of five geckos. The five geckos, four females and one male, were used as a part of the Gecko-F4 research program aimed at measuring the effects of weightlessness on the lizards&#x27; ability to procreate and develop in the harsh environment. However, soon after the spacecraft exited the atmosphere, mission control lost contact with the vessel which led to an attempt to reestablish communication that was only achieved later in the mission. When the satellite returned to Earth after its planned two-month mission had been cut short to 44 days, the space agency researchers reported that all the geckos had perished during the flight.

The exact cause that led to the deaths of the geckos was declared unknown by the scientific team in charge of the project. Reports from the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems in Russia have indicated that the lizards had been dead for at least a week prior to their return to Earth. A number of those connected to the mission have theorized that a failure in the vessel&#x27;s heating system may have caused the cold blooded reptiles to freeze to death.

Included in the mission were a number of fruit flies, plants, and mushrooms which all survived the mission.

== Launch control ==
The Russian Space Forces is the military counterpart of the Roscosmos with similar mission objectives as of the United States Space Force. The Russian branch was formed after the merging of the space components of the Russian Air Force and the Aerospace Defense Forces (VKO) in 2015. The Space Forces controls Russia&#x27;s Plesetsk Cosmodrome launch facility. Roscosmos and the Space Forces share control of the Baikonur Cosmodrome, where Roscosmos reimburses the VKO for the wages of many of the flight controllers during civilian launches. Roscosmos and the Space Forces also share control of the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center. It has been announced that Russia is to build another spaceport in Tsiolkovsky, Amur Oblast. The Vostochny Cosmodrome was scheduled to be finished by 2018 having launched its first rocket in 2016.

<text>Robyn Davidson is an Australian writer best known for her 1980 book &quot;Tracks&quot;, about her 2,700 km (1,700 miles) trek across the deserts of Western Australia using camels. Her career of travelling and writing about her travels has spanned 40 years. Her memoir, &quot;Unfinished Woman&quot; was published in late 2023.

== Early life and education ==
Robyn Davidson was born at Stanley Park, a cattle station in Miles, Queensland, the second of two girls. When she was 11 years old, her mother took her own life, and she was raised largely by her unmarried aunt (her father&#x27;s sister), Gillian, and attended a girls&#x27; boarding school in Brisbane. She received a music scholarship but did not take it up. In Brisbane, Davidson shared a house with biologists and studied zoology. 

In 1968, aged 18, she went to Sydney and later lived a bohemian life in a Sydney Push household at Paddington, while working as a card-dealer at an illegal gambling house.

In 1975, Davidson moved to Alice Springs, in an effort to work with camels for a desert trek she was planning. For two years, she trained camels and learned how to survive in the harsh desert. In her final year in Alice Springs she was assisted by Sallay Mahomet, who provided her with the required camels. Davidson said later that she would often recall Mahomet&#x27;s advice and warnings, especially when faced with the ferocity of in-season wild camels eyeing her herd. Mahomet also provided her with two camels, Kate and Zeleika; Kate would not go on the upcoming journey due to a serious skin infection, which Davidson attempted to nurse for several months. During this period she was peripherally involved in the Aboriginal land rights movement.

==&quot;Tracks&quot;==
In 1977, Davidson set off for Australia&#x27;s west coast from Alice Springs, with her dog Diggitty and four camels: Dookie (a large male), Bub (a smaller male), Zeleika (a wild female), and Goliath (Zeleika&#x27;s offspring). She had no intention of writing about the journey, but eventually agreed to write an article for the magazine &quot;National Geographic&quot;. Having met the photographer Rick Smolan in Alice Springs, she insisted that he be the photographer for the journey. Smolan, with whom she had an &quot;on-again off-again&quot; romantic relationship during the trip, drove out to meet her three times during the nine-month journey. 

The &quot;National Geographic&quot; article was published in 1978 and attracted so much interest that Davidson decided to write a book about the experience. She travelled to London and lived with Doris Lessing while writing &quot;Tracks&quot;. &quot;Tracks&quot; won the inaugural Thomas Cook Travel Book Award in 1980, and the Blind Society Award. In 1992 Smolan published his pictures of the trip in the book &quot;From Alice to Ocean&quot;. It included the first interactive story-and-photo CD made for the general public. 

It has been suggested that one of the reasons &quot;Tracks&quot; was so popular, particularly with women, is that Davidson &quot;places herself in the wilderness of her own accord, rather than as an adjunct to a man&quot;.

Her desert journey is remembered by Aboriginal Australians she encountered along the way. Artist Jean Burke remembers Robyn in a painting called &quot;The Camel Lady&quot;, which was produced in 2011 for a Warakurna Artists&#x27; exhibition in Darwin. Burke&#x27;s father Mr Eddie, a Pitjantjatjara man, had trekked through Ngaanyatjarra lands with Davidson, guiding her to water sources along the way. Mr Eddie originally planned to accompany Davidson for a short period, a few days, between Docker River and Pipalyatjara to help her respectfully bypass sacred sites; however he ultimately accompanied her to Warburton. Being accompanied by Mr Eddie results in Davidson&#x27;s timeline for completion of the trek having to be altered. She says of this:

After their arrival in Warburton Davidson and Mr Eddie part company and Mr Eddie suggests that another older Aboriginal man accompany her on the next leg of the journey as the next sections will be difficult. Davidson decided that she wanted to do it on her own.

===Film adaptation===
2013 saw the release of a film adaptation of Davidson&#x27;s book, also called &quot;Tracks&quot;, directed by John Curran and starring Mia Wasikowska. It made its debut at the Venice Film Festival.

==Nomads==
The majority of Davidson&#x27;s work has been travelling with and studying nomadic peoples. In &quot;The Age&quot; newspaper, Jane Sullivan wrote that, &quot;while she is often called a social anthropologist&quot;, she had no academic qualifications and said that she was &quot;completely self-taught&quot;. Davidson&#x27;s experiences with nomads included travelling on migration with nomads in India from 1990 to 1992. Those experiences were published in &quot;Desert Places&quot;.

She has studied different forms of the nomad lifestyle — including those in Australia, India, and Tibet — for a book and a documentary series. Her writing on nomads is based mainly on personal experience, and she brings many of her thoughts together in &quot;No Fixed Address&quot;, her contribution to the &quot;Quarterly Essay&quot; series. Sullivan wrote about that work:

One of the questions we need to ask, if we are to have a future, she says, is &quot;Where did we cause less damage to ourselves, to our environment, and to our animal kin?&quot; One answer is: when we were nomadic. &quot;It is when we settled that we became strangers in a strange land, and wandering took on the quality of banishment,&quot; she writes, and then later adds: &quot;I shall probably be accused of romanticism&quot;.

==Awards==
Davidson was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) in the King&#x27;s Birthday Honours List in June 2024.

==In popular culture==
Davidson is the subject of a song written by Irish folk singer and songwriter Mick Hanly. The song, &quot;Crusader&quot;, was recorded by Mary Black on her 1983 self-titled album.

In 2024 Davidson was interviewed by Indira Naidoo for episode 9 of the 38th series of &quot;Compass&quot; on ABCTV

== Personal life ==
For three years in the 1980s she was in a relationship with the Indian novelist, Salman Rushdie, to whom she was introduced by their mutual friend, Bruce Chatwin.

Davidson has moved frequently, and has had homes in Sydney, London, and India. In 2014 she was living in Castlemaine, Victoria, Australia.

<doc id="406586" wikidata="Q1202919" url="?curid=406586" title="Four Beauties">
<text>The Four Beauties or Four Great Beauties are four Chinese women who were renowned for their beauty. The four are usually identified as Xi Shi, Wang Zhaojun, Diaochan, and Yang Yuhuan. Among them, Diaochan is a fictional character while the rest have been greatly embellished by legend. They gained their reputation from the influence they exercised over powerful men and, consequently, their impact on Chinese history. 

==Background==
One of the earliest references to qualities later associated with the canonical Four Great Beauties appears in the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;. In one chapter, the women Mao Qiang and Lady Li are described as &quot;great beauties&quot; who &quot;when fish see them they dart into the depths, when birds see them they soar into the skies, when deer see them they bolt away without looking back&quot;. This passage is the source of the well-known Chinese idiom &quot;to make fish sink and birds fall&quot;, which refers to feminine beauty (see ).

==Biographies==
===Xi Shi===
Xi Shi lived around the 7th to the 6th centuries BCE, during the Spring and Autumn period. Similar to the story in the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;, she was said to be so entrancingly beautiful that fishes would forget how to swim and sink below the surface upon seeing her reflection in the water.

Xi Shi was from Zhuji, the capital of the Ancient Yue Kingdom. Goujian, the King of Yue, had surrendered to the rival state of Wu, with the aim of biding his time before enacting his revenge. Part of his plan was to dispatch Xi Shi as a gift to Fuchai, the King of Wu, in the hope that Fuchai would become infatuated with her and become distracted from his official duties. The plan was successful, with Fuchai spending all his time entertaining Xi Shi and not attending to military matters. In part due to his distraction, Goujian was able to defeat an unprepared Fuchai in battle. Fuchai, full of regret, committed suicide.

There are two accounts of what then happened to Xi Shi. The first is that Goujian killed her by drowning her because he was afraid that he too would be mesmerized by her beauty. The second was that she eventually came together with her lover Fan Li and they lived in seclusion together.

===Wang Zhaojun===
Wang Zhaojun was born around 50 BCE, during the Western Han dynasty. Again reflecting the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;, she was said to be so beautiful that her appearance would entice birds in flight to fall from the sky. Locally renowned for her beauty and skill at playing the &quot;pipa&quot;, she was chosen to be admitted into the harem of Emperor Yun, despite her young age. Despite her beauty, the emperor never visited her, as she had refused to bribe the official portraitists, who had then painted an unflattering portrait of her.

In 33 BCE, the Xiongnu Chanyu Huhanye came to the Han capital Chang&#x27;an on an official visit, and asked for a Han beauty as his wife as part of the marriage alliance system between the Han dynasty and the Xiongnu. The new emperor, Emperor Huan, ordered that the plainest woman from the harem be given to Huhanye, and so Wang Zhaojun was chosen, based on her unflattering portrait. The artist Mao Yanshou was subsequently executed for deceiving the Emperor.

===Diaochan===
Diaochan is a fictional character in the Ming novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms.&quot; Set in the waning years of the Eastern Han and the subsequent Three Kingdoms period, she was said to be so luminously lovely that the moon itself would shy away in embarrassment when compared to her face.

Chinese historical records indicate that the warrior Lü Bu had a secret affair with one of the warlord Dong Zhuo&#x27;s maids and he constantly feared that Dong Zhuo would find out. This was one of the reasons why he betrayed and assassinated Dong Zhuo in 192. The maid&#x27;s name was not recorded in history, but it is believed the story partly inspired the character of Diaochan. In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Diaochan, a geji of Wang Yun, assists her master in his plot to bring down Dong Zhuo. She seduces both Lü Bu and Dong Zhuo and thus drives a wedge between the two, eventually having Lü killed his foster father Dong Zhuo. She then becomes a concubine of Lü. The fictional details about her life were added over the centuries.

===Yang Guifei===
Yang Guifei lived in the 8th century and was the beloved consort of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang. She was said to have had a face that put all flowers to shame. Emperor Xuanzong doted on her so much that she was able to persuade him to make her cousin, Yang Guozhong, leading chancellor.

During the An Lushan Rebellion, as Emperor Xuanzong and his cortege were fleeing from the capital Chang&#x27;an to Chengdu, the emperor&#x27;s guards demanded that he put Yang Guifei to death because they blamed the rebellion on her cousin Yang Guozhong and the rest of her family. The emperor capitulated and reluctantly ordered his attendant Gao Lishi to strangle Yang to death. Yang Guifei became a tragic figure in later depictions. Particularly influential was the Tang poet Bai Juyi&#x27;s long poem, &quot;Chang hen ge&quot; (&quot;&quot;).

==Idioms==
Well-known idioms describe the Four Beauties. The exact origin of these idioms is debated.
These separate idioms are sometimes merged to describe especially beautiful women or simply to refer to the Four Beauties&#x27; legendary good looks. The merged idiom is (sinks fish and entices birds to fall, eclipses the moon and shames flowers); the two parts can also be used separately.

<doc id="406587" wikidata="Q290045" url="?curid=406587" title="Jean-Jacques-Régis de Cambacérès">
<text>Jean-Jacques-Régis de Cambacérès, Duke of Parma (; 18 October 17538 March 1824), was a French nobleman, lawyer, freemason and statesman during the French Revolution and the First Empire. He is best remembered as one of the authors of the Napoleonic Code, which still forms the basis of French civil law and French-inspired civil law in many countries.

== Early life ==
Cambacérès was born in Montpellier, into a family of the legal nobility. Although his childhood was relatively poor, his brother Étienne Hubert de Cambacérès later became a cardinal, and his father later became mayor of Montpellier.

In 1774, Cambacérès graduated in law from the college d&#x27;Aix and succeeded his father as Councillor in the court of accounts and finances in Toulouse. He was a supporter of the French Revolution of 1789, and was elected as an extra deputy to represent the nobility of Montpellier, in case the government doubled the nobility&#x27;s delegation at the meeting of the Estates-General at Versailles. However, as the delegation was not increased, he never took his seat. In 1792, he represented the department of Hérault at the National Convention which assembled and proclaimed the First French Republic in September 1792.

== National Convention ==
In revolutionary terms, Cambacérès was a moderate republican and sat left of center during the National Convention. During the trial of Louis XVI he protested that the Convention did not have the power to sit as a court and demanded that the king should have due facilities for his defence. Nevertheless, when the trial proceeded, Cambacérès voted with the majority that declared Louis to be guilty, but recommended that the penalty should be postponed until it could be ratified by a legislative body. This would later save him from being executed for regicide. During the convention, many of his decisions (like the latter) were well thought out and calculated. Cambacérès made sure that he never committed himself to a certain faction. His legal expertise made him useful to all parties; he was a friend to all and an enemy to none. However, due to this, his fellow representatives at the convention did criticize him for sometimes fluctuating on some positions.

== Rise under Napoleon ==
Cambacérès was a member of the Committee of General Defence from 1793 until the end of 1794, and later became a member of its infamous successor, the Committee of Public Safety after the fall of Robespierre. In the meantime he worked on much of the legislation of the revolutionary period. During 1795, he was employed as a diplomat and negotiated peace with Spain, the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, the Kingdom of Prussia and the Batavian Republic. His remarkable debating skills gave him a spot as a councilor of the Five Hundred from 1795 to 1799.

Cambacérès was considered too conservative to be one of the five Directors who took power in the coup of 1795 and, finding himself in opposition to the Executive Directory, he retired from politics. In 1799, however, as the Revolution entered a more moderate phase, he became Minister of Justice. He supported the coup of 18 Brumaire (in November 1799) that brought Napoleon Bonaparte to power as First Consul, a new regime designed to establish a stable constitutional republic.

== Napoleonic Code ==
In December 1799, Cambacérès was appointed Second Consul under Bonaparte. He owed this appointment to his vast legal knowledge and his reputation as a moderate republican. His most important work during this period, and arguably during his entire political career, was the drawing up of a new Civil Law Code (later called the Napoleonic Code; France&#x27;s first modern legal code). The Code was promulgated by Bonaparte (as Emperor Napoleon) in 1804. In the end, the Napoleonic Code was the work of Cambacérès and a commission of four lawyers.

The Code was a minor revised form of Roman law, with minor modifications drawn from the laws of the Franks still current in northern France (&quot;Coutume de Paris&quot;). The Code was later extended by Napoleon&#x27;s occupations to Poland, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Western Germany. Cambacérès&#x27; work has thus been influential in European legal history. However, versions of the Code are only still in force in Quebec (which was never under Napoleon&#x27; control) and Louisiana, which was only briefly under Napoleon&#x27;s control.

The Napoleonic Code dealt with Civil Law; other codes ensued for Penal Law, criminal procedure, and civil procedure.

== Life with Napoleon (1804–1815) ==

Cambacérès disapproved of Bonaparte&#x27;s accumulation of power into his own hands (culminating in the proclamation of the First French Empire on 18 May 1804) but retained high office under Napoleon: Arch-Chancellor of the Empire and President of the House of Peers from 2 June, to 7 July 1815. He also became a prince of the Empire and in 1808 was made Duke of Parma (French: &quot;duc de Parme&quot;). His duchy was one of the twenty created as a &quot;duché grand-fief&quot; (among 2200 noble titles created by Napoleon)—a rare hereditary honor, extinguished upon Cambacérès&#x27; death in 1824. He was essentially second in command of France during the Napoleonic era.

Under Napoleon, he was a force for moderation and reason, opposing adventures such as the Spanish affairs in 1808 and the invasion of Russia in 1812. Nevertheless, Cambacérès was extremely trusted by Napoleon and was constantly consulted for advice; Cambacérès even sat as Council of State when Bonaparte was involved in other affairs. As Napoleon became increasingly obsessed with military affairs, Cambacérès became the &quot;de facto&quot; domestic head of government of France, a position which inevitably made him increasingly unpopular as France&#x27;s economic situation grew worse. As more and more of Napoleon&#x27;s ministers proved themselves untrustworthy, Cambacérès&#x27; power continued to grow. His taste for high living also attracted hostile comments. Nevertheless, he was given credit for the justice and moderation of the government, although the enforcement of conscription was increasingly resented towards the end of the Napoleonic Wars.

When the Empire fell in 1814, Cambacérès retired to private life but was later called upon during Napoléon&#x27;s brief return to power in 1815. During the Hundred Days, the short period of time when Napoleon returned from exile, Cambacérès served as the minister of justice. After the restoration of the monarchy, he was in danger of arrest for his revolutionary activities, and he was exiled from France in 1816. The fact that he had opposed the execution of Louis XVI counted in his favor, and in May 1818 his civil rights as a citizen of France were restored. From 1815 and on, Cambacérès used the title of Duke of Cambacérès (on the fall of the Empire, the Duchy of Parma passed to former Empress Marie Louise). He was a member of the Académie Française and lived quietly in Paris until his death in 1824.

== Private life ==
The common belief that Cambacérès is responsible for decriminalizing homosexuality in France is in error.

Before the French Revolution, sodomy had been a capital crime under royal legislation. The penalty was burning at the stake. Very few men, however, were ever actually prosecuted and executed for consensual sodomy (no more than five in the entire eighteenth century). Sodomites arrested by the police were more usually released with a warning or held in prison for, at most, a few weeks or months. The National Constituent Assembly revised French criminal law in 1791 and got rid of a variety of offenses inspired by religion, including blasphemy. Sodomy was not specifically mentioned but was covered under the umbrella of &#x27;religious crimes&#x27;. Since there was no public debate, its motives remain unknown (a similar state of affairs occurred during the early years of the Russian Revolution).

Cambacérès was a homosexual, his sexual orientation was well-known, and he does not seem to have made any effort to conceal it. He remained unmarried, and kept to the company of other bachelors. Napoleon is recorded as making a number of jokes on the subject. Upon hearing that Cambacérès had recruited a woman for a mission, Napoleon responded with, &quot;my compliments, so you have come closer to women?&quot;. Robert Badinter once mentioned in a speech to the French National Assembly, during debates on reforming the homosexual age of consent, that Cambacérès was known in the gardens of the Palais-Royal as &quot;Tante Urlurette&quot;.

In fact, however, Cambacérès was not responsible for ending the legal prosecution of homosexuals. He did play a key role in drafting the Code Napoléon, but this was a civil law code. He had nothing to do with the Penal Code of 1810, which covered sexual crimes.

The authors of the Penal Code of 1810 had the option of reintroducing a law against male homosexuality but there is no evidence that they even considered doing so. This had nothing to do with the influence of Cambacérès, as recent research has shown. However, Napoleonic officials could and did repress public expressions of homosexuality using other laws, such as &quot;offenses against public decency&quot;. Nevertheless, despite police surveillance and harassment, the Revolutionary and Napoleonic era was a time of relative freedom for homosexuals and opened the modern era of legal toleration for homosexuality in Europe. Napoleonic conquests imposed the principles of Napoleon&#x27;s Penal Code (including the decriminalization of homosexuality) on many other parts of Europe, including Belgium, the Netherlands, the Rhineland, and Italy. Other states freely followed the French example, including Bavaria in 1813 and Spain in 1822.

In addition to jesting about his homosexuality, Cambacérès&#x27; colleagues did not fail to poke fun at his gluttony. When he met with the council while Napoleon was away, everyone knew that the meeting would be over before lunch. He was known for having the best dinners in France and for his extravagant lifestyle. Cambacérès was recorded as saying &quot;a country is governed by good dinner parties&quot;. His estate was worth around 7.3 million francs (around €50 million in 2015 euros) upon his death in 1824. His body now lies in the cemetery of Père Lachaise where he was buried with military honors.

== Freemasonry ==
Cambaceres was admitted to the lodge of &quot;Les Amis Fidèles&quot; in Montpellier in 1775. During Napoleon&#x27;s reign, he was charged by the Emperor to monitor Freemasonry in France. From 1805 to 1815, he was the assistant of Joseph Bonaparte, Grand Master of Grand Orient de France, and managed the post-revolutionary rebirth of French freemasonry. During his term, more than 1200 lodges were created.

<text>John Nicholas Luff (November 16, 1860 – August 23, 1938) of New York City was one of the important philatelists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, notable as an early user of scientific methods in the study of postage stamps. The Luff Award of the American Philatelic Society is named after him.

==Philatelic career==
He developed a serious interest in philately in 1890, and joined the Pacific Philatelic Society in San Francisco, California. He moved to New York City in 1893 with the intention of becoming a full-time stamp dealer, and the following year joined the Scott Stamp &amp; Coin Company, at the time one of the largest dealers in the world. At Scott he headed the approval department, edited the &quot;American Journal of Philately&quot;, and co-edited the Scott catalog.

In 1896, he helped establish the Collectors Club of New York, and was later its president for a number of years.

He became president of Scott in 1903, but moved to Stanley Gibbons in 1905, shortly after returning to Scott, where he remained for the rest of his life.

Luff had become perhaps the most prolific philatelic writer of the age, with works ranging from the tutorial &quot;What Philately Teaches Us&quot; (1899) to the classic reference work &quot;The Postage Stamps of the United States&quot; (1902), and numerous articles in the &quot;AJP&quot; and &quot;Mekeel&#x27;s Weekly Stamp News&quot;.

In addition to building a US collection that won the gold medal at the Paris exhibition of 1900, Luff also collected Great Britain, Shanghai, Hawaii, Japan, and China. But his most important collection was a reference collection that he used as a basis for comparison when expertizing stamps at Scott. He sold the collection to Scott when he left in 1905; the collection was later donated to the Philatelic Foundation, where it mostly still resides and is in use .

Luff was president of the American Philatelic Society from 1907 to 1909. In 1913, Luff was one of 10 judges who participated in the Panama-Pacific Exposition held in San Francisco, CA. There were 6 other U.S. judges at the Expo. In 1941, he was named to the American Philatelic Society Hall of Fame.

==The Luff reference collection==
Luff&#x27;s remarkable collection of postage stamps of the world is described in detail in the Orange volume of The Stamp Specialist.

<doc id="406597" wikidata="Q3138382" url="?curid=406597" title="Historiography of the French Revolution">
<text>The historiography of the French Revolution stretches back over two hundred years. 

Contemporary and 19th-century writings on the Revolution were mainly divided along ideological lines, with conservative historians condemning the Revolution, liberals praising the Revolution of 1789, and radicals defending the democratic and republican values of 1793. By the 20th-century, revolutionary history had become professionalised, with scholars paying more attention to the critical analysis of primary sources from public archives. 

From the late 1920s to the 1960s, social and economic interpretations of the Revolution, often from a Marxist perspective, dominated the historiography of the Revolution in France. This trend was challenged by revisionist historians in the 1960s who argued that class conflict was not a major determinant of the course of the Revolution and that political expediency and historical contingency often played a greater role than social factors. 

In the 21st-century, no single explanatory model has gained widespread support. The historiography of the revolution has become more diversified, exploring areas such as cultural histories, gender relations, regional histories, visual representations, transnational interpretations, and decolonisation. Nevertheless, there persists a very widespread agreement that the French Revolution was the watershed between the premodern and modern eras of Western history.

==Contemporary and 19th-century historians==
The first writings on the French revolution were near contemporaneous with events and mainly divided along ideological lines. These included Edmund Burke&#x27;s conservative critique &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; (1790) and Thomas Paine&#x27;s response &quot;Rights of Man&quot; (1791). From 1815, narrative histories dominated, often based on first-hand experience of the revolutionary years. By the mid-19th century, more scholarly histories appeared, written by specialists and based on original documents and a more critical assessment of contemporary accounts.

Dupuy identifies three main strands in 19th-century historiography of the revolution. The first is represented by reactionary writers who rejected the revolutionary ideals of popular sovereignty, civil equality, and the promotion of rationality, progress and personal happiness over religious faith. The second stream is those writers who celebrated the democratic republican values of the revolution. The third stream is those liberal writers, such as Germaine de Staël and Guizot, who accepted the necessity of reforms establishing a constitution and the rights of man, but rejected state interference with private property and individual rights even if supported by a democratic majority. Doyle states that the three streams can be described as the reactionary, the radical and the liberal, or simply right, left and centre.

=== Burke and Barruel ===
In &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; (1790) Burke presented an influential conservative interpretation of the Revolution, arguing that the Old Regime was stable and viable and was only in need of moderate reform. The Revolution was a conspiracy of philosophers and literary men who undermined faith in religion, monarchy, and the established social order, inciting &quot;the swinish multitude&quot; to create disorder. In France, conspiracy theories were rife in the highly charged political atmosphere, with the Abbé Barruel, in perhaps the most influential work &quot;Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism&quot; (1797–1798), arguing that Freemasons and other dissidents had been responsible for an attempt to destroy the monarchy and the Catholic Church.

=== Adolphe Thiers ===
Adolph Thiers&#x27; &quot;Histoire de la Révolution française&quot; (published 1823-27) was the first major work of the liberal tradition of French historiography. The complete work of ten volumes sold ten thousand sets, and was particularly popular in liberal circles and among younger Parisians. Written during the Restoration, the book praised the principles, leaders and accomplishments of the 1789 Revolution. The heroes were Mirabeau, Lafayette, and other moderate leaders. Thiers condemned Marat, Robespierre and the other radical leaders, and also condemned the monarchy, aristocracy and clergy for their inability to change. The book played a notable role in undermining the legitimacy of the Bourbon regime of Charles X, and bringing about the July Revolution of 1830. Thiers&#x27; history was widely praised in France and won him a seat in the Académie française in 1834.

Kidron describes Thiers&#x27; history as: &quot;historical determinism with a romantic aura.&quot; Thiers believed that impersonal historical forces were stronger than the will of human actors and that each phase of the Revolution was inevitable. Nevertheless, he distinguished between the positive phase of the Revolution from 1789-91 when the bourgeoisie wrested power from an oppressive and inefficient Old Regime, and the regrettable phase from 1793 when violence and dictatorship were made necessary by war and other circumstances.

=== François Mignet ===
François Mignet published his &quot;Histoire de la Révolution française&quot; in 1824. Writing in the liberal tradition, Mignet saw the Revolution of 1789 as the result of a growing, more prosperous and better educated bourgeoisie which challenged the inequalities of the old regime. The liberal aristocrats and middle classes that led the revolution sought to establish a constitution, representative institutions, and equal political and civil rights. Mignet&#x27;s views on historical necessity were similar to those of Thiers. According to Kidron, Mignet&#x27;s history is notable for its lack of moral judgment and it presentation of the Terror as the acts of a war government against its enemies.

===Thomas Carlyle===
Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s three-volume &quot;The French Revolution, A History&quot; (1837) was a major example of narrative history of the romantic school. Carlyle rejected Thiers&#x27; deterministic view of history which emphasised inexorable historical forces over individual moral responsibility. Carlyle was more interested in the lived experience of individuals and declared that Mirabeau, Danton and Napoleon were the three great men of the Revolution. He rejected ideological interpretations of the Revolution, insisting on &quot;facts, facts, no theory.&quot; His research made him hostile to the Girondins and radicals of the Revolution, but he refused to endorse a politically liberal interpretation. His position on revolutionary violence was ambiguous; he abhorred it, but found it understandable in the context of the misery of the common people. Aulard praised his use of the available sources and called him, &quot;Impartial...but neither calm nor without feeling.&quot;

=== Jules Michelet ===
Jules Michelet (1798–1874) published his multi-volume &quot;Histoire de la Révolution française&quot; between 1847 and 1856. Influenced by Vico, MIchelet placed more importance on the masses than individuals. He portrayed the revolution as a spontaneous uprising of the French people against poverty and oppression and in the name of republican equality, and emphasised that the Revolution achieved the unification and legislative reconstruction of France. Michelet was critical of Robespierre and the Jacobins but blamed counter-revolutionaries for provoking the Terror.

Rudé and Doyle place Michelet in the radical, democratic republican tradition, while Kidron describes the work as romantic, liberal and nationalist. François Furet said Michelet&#x27;s history is, &quot;the cornerstone of all revolutionary historiography and is also a literary monument.&quot;

=== Alexis de Tocqueville ===
Alexis de Tocqueville&#x27;s work &quot;L&#x27;Ancien Régime et la Révolution&quot; (The Old Regime and the Revolution,1856) was very influential in the English-speaking world of the 19th-century. Tocqueville was a political liberal who argued that the Revolution was led by thinkers without practical experience who had put too much emphasis on equality over liberty. The democratic egalitarian tendency of the Revolution had laid the groundwork for the destruction of liberty by Napoleon. Tocqueville&#x27;s contributions to the historiography of the Revolution included his extensive use of the recently opened French archives and his stress that the Revolution had multiple causes, including the King&#x27;s attempts at reform: &quot;The social order destroyed by a revolution is almost always better than that which immediately precedes it, and experience shows that the most dangerous moment for a bad government is generally that in which it sets about reform.&quot;

For Tocqueville, the Revolution was not a result of misery and oppression: education and the economy were growing and ownership of land was becoming more diversified. He emphasised the social structure of the Old Regime, the origins of specific economic and legal grievances, and the continuity of administrative centralisation from the Old Regime to the Revolutionary years.

=== Hippolyte Taine ===
Hippolyte Taine (1828–1893) in his &quot;Origines de la France contemporaine&quot; (1875–94) used archival sources extensively and his interpretation emphasised the role of popular action. His interpretation was conservative and marked by hostility towards the revolution and revolutionary crowds which he claimed were mainly composed of criminal elements. He argued that revolutionaries were mainly motivated by the transfer of property, and rejected any distinction between the revolution of 1789 and that of 1793. Historians such as Shafer argue that his interpretation was influenced by his negative experience of the Paris Commune of 1871. He was an admirer of Burke, English conservative principles and &quot;scientific&quot; history based on contemporary documents. He had a major influence on right wing historians of the twentieth century including Augustin Cochin and Pierre Gaxotte.

=== Other historians ===
Other significant 19th-century historians of the revolution include:

* Louis Blanc (1811–1882) – Blanc&#x27;s 13-volume &quot;Histoire de la Révolution française&quot; (1847–1862) displays utopian socialist views, and sympathizes with Jacobinism.
* Théodore Gosselin (1855–1935) – Better known by the pseudonym &quot;G. Lenotre&quot;.
* Albert Sorel (1842–1906) – Diplomatic historian; &quot;L&#x27;Europe et la Révolution française&quot; (8 volumes, 1895–1904); introductory section of this work translated as &quot;Europe under the Old Regime&quot; (1947).
* Edgar Quinet (1803–1875) – Late Romantic nationalist.

==20th-century==
The broad distinction between conservative, democratic-republican and liberal interpretations of the Revolution persisted in the 20th-century, although historiography became more nuanced, with greater attention to critical analysis of documentary evidence. From the late 1920s to the 1960s, social and economic analysis of the Revolution, often from a Marxist perspective, dominated the historiography of the Revolution in France. This historical trend has been variously called &quot;Marxist, &quot;classic&quot;, &quot;Jacobin&quot; or &quot;history from below&quot; and is associated with historians such as Albert Mathiez, Georges Lefebvre and Albert Soboul. From the 1960s, the dominance of social and economic interpretations of the Revolution emphasising class conflict was challenged by revisionist historians such as Alfred Cobban and François Furet.

=== Jean Jaurès ===
Jean Jaurès (1859–1914) wrote a three-volume &quot;Histoire socialiste de la Révolution française&quot; (published 1901-04). He analysed the political, social and economic aspects of the Revolution from a socialist perspective. His thesis was that the Revolution established a bourgeois democratic republic which set the preconditions for the emergence of a socialist movement. His history was also notable for its detailed study of the peasantry and urban poor. As a parliamentarian, he was instrumental in establishing the state-funded &quot;Jaurès Commission&quot;, responsible for publishing historical documents and monographs on the Revolution.

===Alphonse Aulard and academic studies===
Alphonse Aulard (1849–1928) was the first professional historian of the Revolution; he promoted graduate studies, scholarly editions, and learned journals. He was appointed to the first National Chair in the History of the French Revolution at the Sorbonne in 1891. He trained advanced students, founded the &quot;Société de l&#x27;Histoire de la Révolution&quot;, edited the scholarly journal &quot;La Révolution française,&quot; and assembled and published many key primary sources. His major works on the French Revolution include &quot;Histoire politique de la Révolution française&quot; (A political history of the French revolution, 1901), &quot;La Révolution française et le régime féodale&quot; (The French revolution and feudalism, 1919) and &quot;Le Christianisme et la Révolution française&quot; (Christianity and the French Revolution, 1925).

Aulard&#x27;s historiography was based on positivism. The assumption was that methodology was all-important and the historian&#x27;s duty was to present in chronological order the duly verified facts, to analyse relations between facts, and provide the most likely interpretation. Full documentation based on research in the primary sources was essential. Aulard&#x27;s books focused on institutions, public opinion, elections, parties, parliamentary majorities, and legislation. He was a leading historian in the radical tradition, arguing that the democratic republic was the logical culmination of the Revolution. The suspension of the constitution in 1793 and the Terror that followed were necessary expedients to defeat the counter revolution and push through necessary social welfare reforms. Aulard, however, was critical of the excesses of Robespierre, his hero being Danton.

According to Aulard,From the social point of view, the Revolution consisted in the suppression of what was called the feudal system, in the emancipation of the individual, in greater division of landed property, the abolition of the privileges of noble birth, the establishment of equality, the simplification of life... The French Revolution differed from other revolutions in being not merely national, for it aimed at benefiting all humanity.&quot;

=== Cochin and Gaxotte ===
Augustin Cochin (1876–1916) was a conservative critic of the Revolution whose work was influenced by Taine. He argued that there was a continuous tradition linking pre-revolutionary intellectual groups, the freemasons and the Jacobins. His major works include his posthumously published essays &quot;Les Sociétés de Pensée et la Démocratie&quot; (&#x27;Intellectual societies and democracy&#x27;, published 1921) and &quot;La Révolution et la Libre Pensée&quot; (&#x27;The Revolution and free thought&#x27;, published 1924). Furet praised Cochin&#x27;s &quot;rigorous conceptualisation&quot; of the Revolution.

Pierre Gaxotte (1895–1982) was a Royalist critic of the revolution. In his study &quot;The French Revolution&quot; (1928) he drew on Cochin&#x27;s work to argue that the Revolution was a conspiracy inspired by pre-revolutionary intellectual societies and was inherently violent from the beginning. The work of Cochin and Gaxotte became the dominant interpretation of the Revolution in Vichy France but fell out of favour after the war.

=== Albert Mathiez ===
Albert Mathiez (1874–1932) was a Marxist historian who argued that the Revolution of 1789 was a result of class conflict between the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie, and was followed by conflict between the bourgeoisie and the sans-culottes, who were a proto-proletariat. He defended Robespierre, arguing that the Terror was necessary to defend the democratic republican revolution and that the Jacobins were overthrown when they tried to carry out a property revolution. The Revolution ended on 9 Thermidor, after which there was only reaction.

Mathiez established the Society for Robespierrist Studies and its journal, the &quot;Annales Historiques de la Révolution française&quot;. His major works include &quot;La Révolution française&quot; (3 vol. 1922–1924) and &quot;La Vie chère et le movement social sous la Terreur&quot; (1927). Mathiez was a leading figure in what came to be known as the Marxist, Jacobin or &quot;classic&quot; school of French revolutionary historiography.

=== Georges Lefebvre ===
Georges Lefebvre (1874–1959) was a Marxist historian who wrote detailed studies of the French peasantry (&quot;Les paysans du Nord&quot; (1924)), &quot;The Great Fear of 1789&quot; (1932, first English translation 1973) and revolutionary crowds, as well as a general history of the Revolution &quot;La Révolution française&quot; (published 1951–1957). He argued that the Revolution represented the triumph of the bourgeoisie and that the Terror was a reaction to an aristocratic plot. He presented the peasantry as active participants in the Revolution who held a fundamentally anti-capitalist worldview.

Lefebvre held the Chair of French Revolution History at the Sorbonne from 1939 until 1955. He mentored a generation of historians who generally wrote cultural, social and economic interpretations defending the achievements of the Revolution. These historians included Albert Soboul, George Rudé, Richard Cobb, and Franco Venturi.

=== Albert Soboul ===
Albert Soboul (1914–1982) was a leading Marxist historian who was Chair of French Revolution History at the Sorbonne from 1968 to 1982 and president of the &quot;Société des Études Robespierristes&quot;. He specialised in the analysis of popular movements during the Revolution and detailed studies of the sans-culottes. In &quot;Les Sansculottes Parisiens en l’An II&quot; (Paris, 1958; English translation, &quot;The Parisian Sans-Culottes and the French Revolution, 1793-4,&quot; 1964) he argued that the sans-culottes reflected a popular movement which drove the radicalisation of the Revolution. In his general history of the Revolution (&quot;Histoire de la Révolution française&quot;, published 1962) he argued that the Revolution represented the culmination of the long economic and social evolution which made the bourgeoisie the dominant class.

=== Alfred Cobban and revisionist historians ===
Alfred Cobban (1901–1968) challenged Marxist social and economic explanations of the revolution in two important works, &quot;The Myth of the French Revolution&quot; (1955) and &quot;Social Interpretation of the French Revolution&quot; (1964). Cobban argued that the revolution was primarily a political conflict rather than a social one. The revolution wasn&#x27;t initiated by a rising capitalist bourgeoisie but rather by a declining class of lawyers and office holders, and feudalism had virtually disappeared before the Revolution. The victors of the Revolution were large and small conservative property owners, a result which retarded economic development.

American historian George V. Taylor also challenged the class conflict interpretation of the Revolution. In ‘Noncapitalist Wealth and the Origins of the French Revolution’ (1967) and other essays, he argued that there was little economic conflict between the old regime nobility and capitalists and that the share of wealth represented by capitalist enterprises was small. He concluded that the Revolution was not primarily a social one, but a political revolution with social consequences.

=== Robert Palmer ===
In &quot;The Age of the Democratic Revolution&quot; (2 volumes, 1959–64) Robert Palmer argued against &quot;French exceptionalism&quot;. He provided a global interpretation of the Revolution, arguing that the revolutionary conflicts of the second half of the 18th-century amounted to an “Atlantic revolution” or “western revolution”. According to Palmer: “All revolutions since 1800, in Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Africa, have learned from the eighteenth-century Revolution of Western Civilization.” David Armitage comments: “That judgment might seem guilty of almost every current scholarly sin—Eurocentrism, essentialism, teleology, diffusionism—but it captured the essence of Palmer’s endeavor: to understand the present through the past with the perspective of the longue durée.”

Palmer&#x27;s thesis was rejected by both Marxists and French nationalists. Marvin R. Cox states that Marxist historians accused Palmer of &quot;a brief to provide historical legitimacy for NATO,&quot; while French nationalists said it diminished the importance of the French Revolution as an historical event.

Armitage also criticised Palmer for his omissions: “Its omission of the Haitian Revolution and of Iberian America—not to mention the absence of the enslaved, women, and much cultural history—implied that Palmer was afraid to acknowledge the truly radical elements of the age of revolution, that he was blind to its exclusions and complacent about its failed promises.”

===François Furet===
François Furet (1927–1997) was a leading French critic of &quot;Jacobin-Marxist&quot; interpretations of the Revolution. In their influential &quot;La Revolution française&quot; (1965), Furet and Denis Richet argued for the primacy of political decisions, contrasting the reformist period of 1789-91 with the following interventions of the urban masses which led to radicalisation and an ungovernable situation. Furet later argued that a clearer distinction needed to be made between analyses of political events, and of social and economic changes which usually take place over a much longer period than the Jacobin-Marxist school allowed. He also stated that Jacobin-Marxist interpretations of the revolution harboured a totalitarian tendency, and anachronistically viewed the Revolution in the light of the Russian revolution of October 1917. Furet, however, conceded that the Jacobin-Marxist school had increased the understanding of the role of peasants and the urban masses in the revolution. Influenced by Alexis de Tocqueville and Augustin Cochin, Furet argued that the French should stop seeing the revolution as the key to all aspects of modern French history. Other major works by Furet include &quot;Penser la Révolution Française&quot; (1978; translated as &quot;Interpreting the French Revolution&quot; 1981) and &quot;A Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution&quot; (1989).

=== Other 20th-century historians ===
Some other influential historians of this period are:

* Albert Sorel (1842–1906) – Diplomatic historian: &quot;Europe et la Révolution française&quot; (eight volumes, 1895–1904); introductory section of this work translated as &quot;Europe under the Old Regime&quot; (1947).
* Ernest Labrousse (1895–1988) – Performed extensive economic research on 18th-century France.
* George Rudé (1910–1993) – Another of Lefebvre&#x27;s protégés, did further work on the popular side of the Revolution, including: &quot;The Crowd in the French Revolution&quot; (1959).
* Richard Cobb (1917–1996) was a leading exponent of &quot;history from below&quot; who wrote detailed studies of both provincial and city life, avoiding the revisionism debate by &quot;keeping his nose very close to the ground&quot;. His major works include &quot;Les armées révolutionnaires&quot; (published 1961-63, translated as &quot;The People&#x27;s Armies&quot; in 1987).

== Modern historiography (1980s to present) ==
From the 1980s, Western scholars largely abandoned Marxist interpretations of the revolution in terms of bourgeoisie-proletarian class struggle as anachronistic. However, no new explanatory model has gained widespread support. The historiography of the revolution has become more diversified, exploring areas such as cultural histories, regional histories, visual representations, transnational interpretations, and decolonisation.

=== Cultural studies ===
From the 1980s, there was a proliferation of interpretations based on the study of language and popular culture, in which the Revolution was largely viewed as a symptom of deeper cultural trends. Some of the more prominent works include:

* Robert Darnton &quot;The Literary Underground of the Old Regime&quot; (1982)
* Keith Michael Baker &quot;Inventing the French Revolution&quot; (1990)
* R. Chartier, &quot;The Cultural Origins of the French Revolution&quot; (1991)
* Lynn Hunt, &quot;Politics, Culture, and Class in the French Revolution&quot; (1984), and &quot;The Family Romance of the French Revolution&quot; (1992).

=== Women and gender ===
Late 20th-century studies of women and the revolution emphasised the role of women as participants in the revolution but their exclusion from revolutionary political institutions and full citizenship rights. More recent studies have concentrated on the experiences of specific female groups such as teachers, writers, prostitutes, rural women and those associated with the military and have argued that women were often able to promote new notions of citizenship and challenge gendered power relations. Some key works include:

* Joan B. Landes, &quot;Women and the Public Sphere in the Age of the French Revolution&quot; (1988)
* Hufton, Olwen, &quot;Women and the Limits of Citizenship in the French Revolution&quot; (Toronto, University of Toronto Press, 1992)
* Melzer, S. E. and L. W. Rabine, eds., Rebel Daughters: &quot;Women and the French Revolution&quot; (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1992).
* Godineau, Dominique., &quot;The Women of Paris and their French Revolution&quot; (Berkeley, University of California Press, 1998)
* Jennifer Ngaire Heuer, &quot;The Family and the Nation: Gender and Citizenship in Revolutionary France, 1789–1830&quot; (Ithaca, NY, 2005)

=== Decolonisation ===
Recent studies of the French colonies have largely abandoned the Jacobin-Marxist approach of classic studies such as C. L. R. James&#x27; &quot;The Black Jacobins&quot; (1938) and Aimé Césaire&#x27;s &quot;Toussaint Louverture: La Révolution française et le problème colonia&quot;l (1960). Scholars such as Michel-Rolph Traillot and Anthony Hurley have emphasised the cultural traditions of colonial slaves, arguing that the Haitian revolution was not a derivative of the French revolution.
=== Trans-Atlantic and global histories ===
Trans-Atlantic and global interpretations of the French Revolution have become a major field of study. Important recent histories include Suzanne Desan, Lynn Hunt, and William Max Nelson (eds), &quot;The French Revolution in Global Perspective&quot; (Ithaca, NY, 2013); David Armitage and Sanjay Subrahmanyan (eds), &quot;The Age of Revolutions in Global Context&quot; (Basingstoke, 2010); and Wim Klooster, &quot;Revolutions in the Atlantic World; a comparative history&quot; (New York, 2009).

=== Other contemporary historians ===

* Simon Schama&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1989) is a popular narrative history in the tradition of Cobban and Furet. Schama argues that violence was an essential element of the Revolution from 1789 and that the revolution ended with the fall of Robespierre in 1794.
* William Doyle, a British revisionist historian who wrote &quot;The Origins of the French Revolution&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Oxford History of the French Revolution&quot; (2nd edition 2002). Doyle argues that the outbreak of the revolution was a result of political miscalculation rather than social conflicts.
* Timothy Tackett has written a number of histories of the Revolution including &quot;When the King Took Flight&quot; (2004), &quot;Becoming a Revolutionary&quot; (2006), and &quot;The Coming of the Terror in the French Revolution&quot; (2015).

<text>Eric Allin Cornell (born December 19, 1961) is an American physicist who, along with Carl E. Wieman, was able to synthesize the first Bose–Einstein condensate in 1995. For their efforts, Cornell, Wieman, and Wolfgang Ketterle shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2001.

==Biography==
Cornell was born in Palo Alto, California, where his parents were completing graduate degrees at nearby Stanford University. Two years later he moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where his father was a professor of civil engineering at MIT. Here he grew up with his younger brother and sister, with year-long stints in Berkeley, California, and Lisbon, Portugal, accompanying his father whilst on sabbatical.

In Cambridge he attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School. The year before his graduation he moved back to California with his mother and finished high school at San Francisco&#x27;s Lowell High School, a local magnet school for academically talented students.

After high school he enrolled at Stanford University, where he was to meet his future wife, Celeste Landry. As an undergraduate he earned money as an assistant in the various low-temperature physics groups on campus. He was doing well both in his courses and his jobs in the labs and seemed set for a career in physics. He however doubted whether he wished to pursue such a career, or rather a different one in literature or politics. Halfway through his undergraduate years he went to China and Taiwan for nine months to volunteer teaching conversational English and to study Chinese. He returned to Stanford with the intent to study physics. He graduated with honors and distinction in 1985.

For graduate school he returned to MIT. There he joined David Pritchard&#x27;s group, which had a running experiment that tried to measure the mass of the electron neutrino from the beta decay of tritium. Although he was unable to determine the mass of the neutrino, Cornell did obtain his PhD in 1990.

After obtaining his doctorate he joined Carl Wieman at the University of Colorado Boulder as a postdoctoral researcher on a small laser cooling experiment. During his two years as a postdoc he came up with a plan to combine laser cooling and evaporative cooling in a magnetic trap to create a Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC). Based on his proposal he was offered a permanent position at JILA/NIST in Boulder. In 1995 Cornell and Wieman gave the University of Colorado&#x27;s George Gamow Memorial Lecture. For synthesizing the first Bose–Einstein condensate in 1995, Cornell, Wieman, and Wolfgang Ketterle shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2001. In 1997, Deborah S. Jin joined Cornell&#x27;s group at JILA, where she led the team that produced the fermionic condensate in 2003.

He is currently a professor at the University of Colorado Boulder and a physicist (NIST fellow) at the United States Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology. His lab is located at JILA. He was awarded the Lorentz Medal in 1998 and is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2005.

==Personal life==
Cornell married Celeste Landry in 1995 mere months before the BEC experiment succeeded. Their first daughter was born in 1996, and their second daughter in 1998.

In October 2004, his left arm and shoulder were amputated in an attempt to stop the spread of necrotizing fasciitis. He was discharged from the hospital in mid-December, having recovered from the infection, and returned to work part-time in April 2005. Cornell has run in the Bolder Boulder several times since moving to Boulder in 1990, most recently in 2022.

<doc id="406602" wikidata="Q826103" url="?curid=406602" title="Reye syndrome">
<text>Reye syndrome is a rapidly worsening brain disease. Symptoms of Reye syndrome may include vomiting, personality changes, confusion, seizures, and loss of consciousness. While liver toxicity typically occurs in the syndrome, jaundice usually does not. Death occurs in 20–40% of those affected with Reye syndrome, and about a third of those who survive are left with a significant degree of brain damage.
The cause of Reye syndrome is unknown. It usually begins shortly after recovery from a viral infection, such as influenza or chickenpox. About 90% of cases in children are associated with aspirin (salicylate) use. Inborn errors of metabolism are also a risk factor. The syndrome is associated with changes on blood tests such as a high blood ammonia level, low blood sugar level, and prolonged prothrombin time. Often, the liver is enlarged in those who have the syndrome.
Prevention is typically by avoiding the use of aspirin in children. When aspirin was withdrawn for use in children in the US and UK in the 1980s, a decrease of more than 90% in rates of Reye syndrome was observed. Early diagnosis of the syndrome improves outcomes. Treatment is supportive; mannitol may be used to help with the brain swelling.
The first detailed description of Reye syndrome was in 1963 by Australian pathologist Douglas Reye. The syndrome most commonly affects children. It affects fewer than one in a million children a year. The general recommendation to use aspirin in children was withdrawn because of Reye syndrome, with use only recommended in Kawasaki disease.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Reye syndrome progresses through five stages:
* Stage I
** Vasoconstrictive rash on palms of hands and feet
** Persistent, heavy vomiting that is not relieved by not eating
** Generalized lethargy
** Confusion
** Nightmares (possible symptom)
** No fever usually present
** Headaches
* Stage II
** Deep lethargy
** Delirium
** Confusion
** Combative behavior
** Stupor
** Hyperventilation
** Fatty liver (found on biopsy)
** Hyperactive reflexes
* Stage III
** Continuation of Stage I and II symptoms
** Possible coma
** Possible cerebral edema
** Possible seizures
** Rarely, respiratory arrest
** Decorticate posturing
* Stage IV
** Seizures
** Decerebrate posturing
** Deepening coma
** Dilated pupils with minimal response to light
** Loss of oculocephalic reflexes
** Minimal but still present liver dysfunction
* Stage V
** Very rapid onset following stage IV
** Areflexia
** Deep coma
** Dilated, nonreactive pupils
** Isoelectric EEG
** Respiratory arrest
** Seizures
** Multiple organ failure
** Flaccidity
** Hyperammonemia (above 300 mg/dL of blood)
** Death

== Causes ==
The cause of Reye syndrome is unknown. It usually begins shortly after recovery from a viral infection, such as influenza or chickenpox. About 90% of cases in children are associated with aspirin (salicylate) use. Inborn errors of metabolism are also a risk factor.

The association with aspirin has been shown through epidemiological studies. The diagnosis of Reye syndrome greatly decreased in the 1980s, when genetic testing for inborn errors of metabolism was becoming available in industrialized countries. A retrospective study of 49 survivors of cases diagnosed as Reye syndrome showed that the majority of the surviving patients had various metabolic disorders, particularly a fatty-acid oxidation disorder medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency.

=== Aspirin ===
There is an association between taking aspirin for viral illnesses and the development of Reye syndrome, but no animal model of Reye syndrome has been developed in which aspirin causes the condition.

The serious symptoms of Reye syndrome appear to result from damage to cellular mitochondria, at least in the liver, and there are a number of ways that aspirin could cause or exacerbate mitochondrial damage. A potential increased risk of developing Reye syndrome is one of the main reasons that aspirin has not been recommended for use in children and teenagers, the age group for which the risk of lasting serious effects is highest.

In some countries, oral mouthcare product Bonjela (not the form specifically designed for teething) has labeling cautioning against its use in children, given its salicylate content. There have been no cases of Reye syndrome following its use, and the measure is a precaution. Other medications containing salicylates are often similarly labeled as a precaution.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. Surgeon General, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommend that aspirin and combination products containing aspirin not be given to children and teenagers under 19 years of age during episodes of fever-causing illnesses. Hence, in the United States, it is advised that the opinion of a doctor or pharmacist should be obtained before anyone under 19 years of age is given any medication containing aspirin (also known on some medicine labels as acetylsalicylate, salicylate, acetylsalicylic acid, ASA, or salicylic acid).

Current advice in the United Kingdom by the Committee on Safety of Medicines is that aspirin should not be given to those under the age of 16 years, unless specifically indicated in Kawasaki disease or in the prevention of blood clot formation.

== Diagnosis ==
=== Differential diagnosis ===
Causes for similar symptoms include 
* Various inborn metabolic disorders
* Viral encephalitis
* Drug overdose or poisoning
* Head trauma
* Liver failure due to other causes
* Meningitis
* Kidney failure
* Shaken baby syndrome

== Treatment ==
Treatment is supportive. Mannitol may be used to help with the brain swelling.

== Prognosis ==
Documented cases of Reye syndrome in adults are rare. The recovery of adults with the syndrome is generally complete, with liver and brain function returning to normal within two weeks of onset.

In children, mild to moderate to severe permanent brain damage is possible, especially in infants. Over thirty percent of the cases reported in the United States from 1981 through 1997 resulted in fatality.

== Epidemiology ==
Reye syndrome occurs almost exclusively in children. While a few adult cases have been reported over the years, these cases do not typically show permanent neural or liver damage. Unlike in the United Kingdom, the surveillance for Reye syndrome in the United States is focused on people under 18 years of age.

In 1980, after the CDC began cautioning physicians and parents about the association between Reye syndrome and the use of salicylates in children with chickenpox or virus-like illnesses, the incidence of Reye syndrome in the United States began to decline, prior to the FDA&#x27;s issue of warning labels on aspirin in 1986. In the United States between 1980 and 1997, the number of reported cases of Reye syndrome decreased from 555 cases in 1980 to about two cases per year since 1994. During this time period 93% of reported cases for which racial data were available occurred in whites and the median age was six years. In 93% of cases a viral illness had occurred in the preceding three-week period. For the period 1991–1994, the annual rate of hospitalization due to Reye syndrome in the United States was estimated to be between &lt; 0.3 – 1 per million population less than 18 years of age.

During the 1980s, a case-control study carried out in the United Kingdom also demonstrated an association between Reye syndrome and aspirin exposure. In June 1986, the United Kingdom Committee on Safety of Medicines issued warnings against the use of aspirin in children under 12 years of age and warning labels on aspirin-containing medications were introduced. United Kingdom surveillance for Reye syndrome documented a decline in the incidence of the illness after 1986. The reported incidence rate of Reye syndrome decreased from a high of 0.63 per 100,000 population less than 12 years of age in 1983–1984 to 0.11 in 1990–1991.

From November 1995 to November 1996 in France, a national survey of pediatric departments for children under 15 years of age with unexplained encephalopathy and a threefold (or greater) increase in serum aminotransferase and/or ammonia led to the identification of nine definite cases of Reye syndrome (0.79 cases per million children). Eight of the nine children with Reye syndrome were found to have been exposed to aspirin. In part because of this survey result, the French Medicines Agency reinforced the international attention to the relationship between aspirin and Reye syndrome by issuing its own public and professional warnings about this relationship.

== History ==
The syndrome is named after Douglas Reye, who, along with fellow physicians Graeme Morgan and Jim Baral, published the first study of the syndrome in 1963 in &quot;The Lancet&quot;. In retrospect, the occurrence of the syndrome may have first been reported in 1929. Also in 1964, George Johnson and colleagues published an investigation of an outbreak of influenza B that described 16 children who developed neurological problems, four of whom had a profile remarkably similar to Reye syndrome. Some investigators refer to this disorder as Reye-Johnson syndrome, although it is more commonly called Reye syndrome. In 1979, Karen Starko and colleagues conducted a case-control study in Phoenix, Arizona, and found the first statistically significant link between aspirin use and Reye syndrome. Studies in Ohio and Michigan soon confirmed her findings pointing to the use of aspirin during an upper respiratory tract or chickenpox infection as a possible trigger of the syndrome. Beginning in 1980, the CDC cautioned physicians and parents about the association between Reye syndrome and the use of salicylates in children and teenagers with chickenpox or virus-like illnesses. In 1982, the U.S. Surgeon General issued an advisory, and in 1986, the Food and Drug Administration required a Reye syndrome-related warning label for all aspirin-containing medications.

<text>Interstate 705 (I-705), also known as the Tacoma Spur, is a short Interstate Highway in Tacoma, Washington, United States. It is a spur route of I-5 that connects the freeway to Downtown Tacoma, Tacoma&#x27;s waterfront, North Tacoma, and the Tacoma Dome. I-705 was completed in 1988 and is one of the newest portions of the Interstate Highway System in Washington.

==Route description==

I-705 is the shortest Interstate Highway in Washington, at in length, and primarily serves as a connector between I-5 and Downtown Tacoma. It begins as a continuation of SR 7 at an interchange with I-5 south of downtown Tacoma, near the Tacoma Dome and America&#x27;s Car Museum. The freeway passes under I-5, following a gulch south until it terminates at South 38th Street; SR 7 continues beyond Tacoma on Pacific Avenue towards Spanaway and Mount Rainier National Park.

The freeway travels north with an exit to South 26th Street serving the Tacoma Dome and the adjacent Tacoma Dome Station transit complex. I-705 passes over the T Line streetcar near South 25th Street station and continues north to a single-point urban interchange with SR 509 at South 21st Street, which provides access to the University of Washington Tacoma campus and Port of Tacoma. Following a freight railroad, the freeway passes the Washington State History Museum and Union Station near the Bridge of Glass, a pedestrian overpass that crosses I-705 and links the Museum of Glass on the Thea Foss Waterway shore to downtown Tacoma.

The northbound lanes separate near the Bridge of Glass, with one splitting into offramps serving South 15th Street and A Street, the latter of which is also served by a southbound onramp. I-705 then crosses under South 11th Street near the Murray Morgan Bridge and terminates at an onramp from South 9th Street adjacent to Fireman&#x27;s Park, which cantilevers over the southbound lanes. The freeway continues northwest onto Schuster Parkway, with a separate set of flyover ramps that end at an at-grade intersection with Stadium Way near the Old City Hall.

As a component of the Interstate Highway System, the entirety of I-705 is listed as part of the National Highway System, a national network of roads identified as important to the national economy, defense, and mobility; it is also part of the state government&#x27;s Highway of Statewide Significance program, recognizing its connection to major communities. The freeway is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which conducts an annual survey of traffic volume that is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic. Average traffic volumes on the highway in 2020 ranged from a minimum of 26,000 vehicles at its southern terminus to a maximum of 62,000 vehicles between I-5 and SR 509.

==History==
The state government&#x27;s plans for a regional tollway connecting Tacoma to Seattle and Everett in the early 1950s included a bypass of Downtown Tacoma with several connecting interchanges. The plan later formed the basis of I-5, which would be constructed using funds from the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 instead of requiring a toll. In 1957, city officials from Tacoma proposed the construction of a downtown connector that would travel north from the Pacific Avenue interchange on I-5 (where SR 7 terminates) and improve vehicular access to the central business district. A route along A Street was selected for preliminary studies of either an elevated freeway or one-way couplet.

The opening of the Tacoma Mall along I-5 in 1965 caused a reduction in the number of retailers in Downtown Tacoma, which remained only accessible via local streets from the freeway. The lost business, combined with worsening congestion in Downtown Tacoma, prompted downtown retailers to ask the state government for an improved connection to I-5. The state Department of Highways had advanced their study into a downtown connector as part of SR 509 that would become an eventual freeway link. In 1968, the Department of Highways adopted the routing of a freeway into Downtown Tacoma along the western side of the City Waterway, to be constructed over railroad right of way. The project, then part of a new freeway corridor for State Route 509 through the Port of Tacoma, was approved by the Tacoma City Council in 1971, but further planning was suspended at the time due to funding issues.

In 1978, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved the designation of the Tacoma Spur as I-705. The Federal Highway Administration had tentatively numbered the route as &quot;Interstate 105&quot;, but the Washington State Department of Transportation had requested the use of &quot;705&quot; as it would not conflict with SR 105, an existing highway. The Washington State Legislature approved the addition of I-705 into the state highway system in April 1979.

While funding was identified in the 1970s, construction on the freeway was not completed until the next decade because of federal budget cuts. Construction began with a groundbreaking on July 26, 1982, for the first portion of the Tacoma Spur, a ramp connecting I-5 to the Tacoma Dome area. The offramp connecting southbound I-5 to East 26th Street was dedicated on April 21, 1983, a day before the Tacoma Dome opened to the public. Construction on the rest of I-705 began in 1983; it required the demolition of the Union Station concourse shortly after passenger trains were rerouted to a new Amtrak station in 1984.

The northbound lanes of I-705 between South 22nd and South 13th streets opened on October 27, 1986, and was followed in August 1987 by a connection to Schuster Parkway. The freeway was dedicated on October 17, 1988, with a parade and ribbon-cutting; I-705 cost $102.3 million to construct and was the last new Interstate to be completed in the state of Washington. The Tacoma City Council in 1992 proposed to name the freeway Martin Luther King Way, however that name was finally applied to nearby K Street. Work on the single-point urban interchange, costing $29.4 million (equivalent to $ million in ), was completed in 1993 to accommodate the changes that were made to SR 509 through Tacoma.

<doc id="406608" wikidata="Q551808" url="?curid=406608" title="Cerebral hemisphere">
<text>The vertebrate cerebrum (brain) is formed by two cerebral hemispheres that are separated by a groove, the longitudinal fissure. The brain can thus be described as being divided into left and right cerebral hemispheres. Each of these hemispheres has an outer layer of grey matter, the cerebral cortex, that is supported by an inner layer of white matter. In eutherian (placental) mammals, the hemispheres are linked by the corpus callosum, a very large bundle of nerve fibers. Smaller commissures, including the anterior commissure, the posterior commissure and the fornix, also join the hemispheres and these are also present in other vertebrates. These commissures transfer information between the two hemispheres to coordinate localized functions.

There are three known poles of the cerebral hemispheres: the &quot;occipital pole&quot;, the &quot;frontal pole&quot;, and the &quot;temporal pole&quot;.

The central sulcus is a prominent fissure which separates the parietal lobe from the frontal lobe and the primary motor cortex from the primary somatosensory cortex.

Macroscopically the hemispheres are roughly mirror images of each other, with only subtle differences, such as the Yakovlevian torque seen in the human brain, which is a slight warping of the right side, bringing it just forward of the left side. On a microscopic level, the cytoarchitecture of the cerebral cortex, shows the functions of cells, quantities of neurotransmitter levels and receptor subtypes to be markedly asymmetrical between the hemispheres. However, while some of these hemispheric distribution differences are consistent across human beings, or even across some species, many observable distribution differences vary from individual to individual within a given species.

== Structure ==
Each cerebral hemisphere has an outer layer of cerebral cortex which is of grey matter and in the interior of the cerebral hemispheres is an inner layer or core of white matter known as the centrum semiovale. The interior portion of the hemispheres of the cerebrum includes the lateral ventricles, the basal ganglia, and the white matter.

===Poles===
There are three poles of the cerebrum: the occipital pole, the frontal pole, and the temporal pole. The occipital pole is the posterior end of each occipital lobe in each hemisphere. It is more pointed than the rounder frontal pole. The frontal pole is at the frontmost part of the frontal lobe in each hemisphere, and is more rounded than the occipital pole. The temporal pole is located between the frontal and occipital poles, and sits in the anterior part of middle cranial fossa in each temporal lobe.

== Composition ==
If the upper part of either hemisphere is removed, at a level about 1.25 cm above the corpus callosum, the central white matter will be exposed as an oval-shaped area, the centrum semiovale, surrounded by a narrow convoluted margin of gray substance, and studded with numerous minute red dots (puncta vasculosa), produced by the escape of blood from divided blood vessels.

If the remaining portions of the hemispheres be slightly drawn apart a broad band of white substance, the corpus callosum, will be observed, connecting them at the bottom of the longitudinal fissure; the margins of the hemispheres which overlap the corpus callosum are called the &quot;labia cerebri&quot;.

Each labium is part of the cingulate gyrus already described; and the groove between it and the upper surface of the corpus callosum is termed the callosal sulcus.

If the hemispheres are sliced off to a level with the upper surface of the corpus callosum, the white substance of that structure will be seen connecting the two hemispheres.

The large expanse of medullary matter now exposed, surrounded by the convoluted margin of gray substance, is called the centrum semiovale. The blood supply to the centrum semiovale is from the superficial middle cerebral artery. The cortical branches of this artery descend to provide blood to the centrum semiovale.

===Development===
The cerebral hemispheres are derived from the telencephalon. They arise five weeks after conception as bilateral invaginations of the walls.
The hemispheres grow round in a C-shape and then back again, pulling all structures internal to the hemispheres (such as the ventricles) with them.
The intraventricular foramina (also called the foramina of Monro) allows communication with the lateral ventricles.
The choroid plexus is formed from ependymal cells and vascular mesenchyme.

== Function ==

===Hemisphere lateralization===
Broad generalizations are often made in popular psychology about certain functions (e.g. logic, creativity) being lateralized, that is, located in the right or left side of the brain. These claims are often inaccurate, as most brain functions are actually distributed across both hemispheres. Most scientific evidence for asymmetry relates to low-level perceptual functions rather than the higher-level functions popularly discussed (e.g. subconscious processing of grammar, not &quot;logical thinking&quot; in general). In addition to this lateralization of some functions, the low-level representations also tend to represent the contralateral side of the body.

The best example of an established lateralization is that of Broca&#x27;s and Wernicke&#x27;s Areas (language) where both are often found exclusively on the left hemisphere. These areas frequently correspond to handedness however, meaning the localization of these areas is regularly found on the hemisphere opposite to the dominant hand. Function lateralization, such as semantics, intonation, accentuation, and prosody, has since been called into question and largely been found to have a neuronal basis in both hemispheres.
Perceptual information is processed in both hemispheres, but is laterally partitioned: information from each side of the body is sent to the opposite hemisphere (visual information is partitioned somewhat differently, but still lateralized). Similarly, motor control signals sent out to the body also come from the hemisphere on the opposite side. Thus, hand preference (which hand someone prefers to use) is also related to hemisphere lateralization.

In some aspects, the hemispheres are asymmetrical; the right side is slightly bigger. There are higher levels of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine on the right and higher levels of dopamine on the left. The right hemisphere is more sensitive to testosterone. There is more white matter (longer axons) on the right and more grey matter (cell bodies) on the left.

Linear reasoning functions of language such as grammar and word production are often lateralized to the left hemisphere of the brain. In contrast, holistic reasoning functions of language such as intonation and emphasis are often lateralized to the right hemisphere of the brain. Other integrative functions such as intuitive or heuristic arithmetic, binaural sound localization, etc. seem to be more bilaterally controlled.

==Clinical significance==
Infarcts of the centrum ovale can occur.

As a treatment for epilepsy the corpus callosum may be severed to cut the major connection between the hemispheres in a procedure known as a corpus callosotomy.

A hemispherectomy is the removal or disabling of one of the hemispheres of the brain. This is a rare procedure used in some extreme cases of seizures which are unresponsive to other treatments.

<text>For Us, the Living: A Comedy of Customs is a science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein. It was written in 1938 and published for the first time in 2003. Heinlein admirer and science fiction author Spider Robinson titled his introductory essay &quot;RAH DNA&quot;, as he believes this first, unpublished novel formed the DNA of Heinlein&#x27;s later works.

The novel&#x27;s manuscript was lost until biographer Robert James traced down references to it. His research led to its rediscovery in a box left in a garage. Heinlein had apparently sent it to an earlier biographer, Leon Stover.

==Plot summary==
Perry Nelson, a normal 1939 engineer and Navy pilot, is driving his automobile when he has a blowout, skids over a cliff, and wakes up in the year 2086. Though he was apparently killed in the summer, he re-appears in extremely cold snow, nearly dies again by freezing, and is saved by a fur-clad woman named Diana. The exact circumstances of his being killed and reborn after a century and a half are never explained.

The later 21st century people seem strangely incurious, showing little interest in how he had come to be among them and rather take his appearance for granted and proceed to explain to him the details of the social and political set-up of their world.

==Background==
The book is akin more to a lecture series than a novel. A number of people have remarked on its resemblance to H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The Shape of Things to Come&quot; where the sleeper wakes into pseudo-utopia. The character Diana&#x27;s background is clarified in a multiple-page footnote from the author. The future society has a version of a Social Credit structure with a central government-run bank exclusively controlling the monetary supply to prevent overproduction and remaining private banks prohibited from lending money they do not actually have on hand and which had been explicitly designated for investment risk.

The book does not tell precisely how the protagonist came to wake up a century and a half after being killed in a car accident, and find himself wandering in the snow in the body of a denizen of the future who had had enough of life and chose to commit suicide. It is mentioned that his last sight before crashing down and getting killed was a girl in a green bathing suit who had the same face as the Diana which he meets in the future; it turns out that her name had been Diana, too, and that to her fell the disagreeable task of finding Perry&#x27;s broken body and reporting the accident. There is the clear implication that the later Diana was an avatar or reincarnation of the earlier one, but this is not stated explicitly. As noted by reviewer Nancy Green, this aspect of the book gives the impression of a draft which Heinlein intended to further work on, but never did.

==Connections to other Heinlein works==
Appearing already in this early stage of Heinlein&#x27;s career is the fanatic and dictatorial religious leader Nehemiah Scudder. However, in Heinlein&#x27;s later Future History Scudder succeeds in getting elected President and establishing a theocratic dictatorship dominating the U.S. for most of the 21st century. Conversely, in &quot;For Us, the Living&quot;, Scudder does establish for several years a de facto domination over the Mississippi Valley, and terrorizes much of the rest of the country by Ku Klux Klan–type thugs—but he is stopped at the last moment by the counter-mobilization of libertarians, and despite mass voter intimidation carries only Tennessee and Alabama.

In fact, the new regime seen in full bloom in the book&#x27;s 2086 came into being in direct reaction to Scudder&#x27;s attempt to impose Puritanical mores on the entire American society—for example, the complete abolition of the nudity taboo, which is an important aspect of the book&#x27;s plot.

The abolition of the taboo on public nudity would re-appear as a major issue in Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;The Puppet Masters&quot;—though under radically different circumstances to those in the present book.

A major difference between the time line of &quot;For Us, the Living&quot; and Heinlein&#x27;s later Future History is the time when space exploration begins. In the Future History, Heinlein assumed that long before the end of the 20th century an extensive human exploration and colonization would take place all over the Solar System; the same assumption was made also in other works not fitting into the Future History&#x27;s framework. However, in his earlier book dealt with here, Heinlein was far more cautious, placing the first circumlunar flight (not yet an actual landing) only in 2089.

Ward Carson wrote: &quot;In &quot;For Us, the Living&quot;, space colonization waits until the end of the Twenty-First Century and Scudder is defeated; in the Future History it happens a century earlier and Scudder takes over the US. Heinlein made no explicit remark on this, but a causal connection could be made: in the Future History the bold individualistic Americans emigrated into space in the end of the Twentieth Century, and were not present in America to stop it from falling into the fanatic&#x27;s hands&quot;.

==Concepts and themes==

===The Second World War===
At the time of writing, there was already a widespread expectation of a new war breaking out in Europe in the near future, and Heinlein followed this assumption. However, in the book&#x27;s timeline the US stays out of the war, and it ends due to Germany&#x27;s economic collapse rather than its military defeat (similar to the scenario given in H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The Shape of Things to Come&quot;, four years before). Heinlein did correctly guess that Adolf Hitler would end up committing suicide, once his schemes of conquest collapsed.

The timeline depicted in the book does not include a war between the US and Japan. However, in the context of a later war there is a depiction of Latin American aircraft carriers launching a devastating surprise attack on New York City, which bears some similarities to the methods which the Japanese would use at Pearl Harbor three years after the book was written. Heinlein, a former naval officer, clearly understood the strategic implications of the carriers&#x27; appearance and the revolution they would bring to naval warfare.

The recently abdicated King Edward VIII of the UK is very positively presented, his romantic image as &quot;the King who gave up his throne for love&quot; not yet, at the time of writing, tainted by pro-Nazi associations. In Heinlein&#x27;s projected future, Edward returns to England at the outbreak of war and distinguishes himself in wartime service. After the war a European Federation is formed and Edward is made into a Constitutional Emperor of Europe, a task which he fulfills with great success. However, he dies without issue in 1970 (two years earlier than in actual history) and in the aftermath Europe is torn up in forty years of highly destructive war and is largely depopulated.

===Secularism===
As could be expected of a regime born directly of secular opposition to a religious fanatic&#x27;s violent attempt to set up a theocracy, the regime depicted in the book has a clearly secularist inclination. All organized religious groups are defined as &quot;sects&quot;, including what were considered &quot;Churches&quot; at the time of writing (and still are at present). Such religious themes as &quot;the conspicuous depiction of a person suffering in great pain&quot; (i.e. a crucifix) or the &quot;wild aggressive behavior of ancient barbaric tribes&quot; (i.e. the ancient Hebrews as depicted in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament) are greatly frowned upon. While religious education is not outright forbidden, all youths typically undergo a minimum of two years at a &quot;development center&quot; (a kind of boarding school) where education is completely secular. An option for parents refusing to let their children have such an experience is to go to Coventry where they could do as they wish, and some &quot;sects&quot; have done exactly that, to their last member.

In this, Heinlein&#x27;s vision of the future could be considered a watered-down version of that in Wells&#x27;s &quot;The Shape of Things to Come&quot; where determined reformers completely suppress all organized religion for the explicit purpose of gaining a complete monopoly over education.

===President Roosevelt===
The book—written in the aftermath of the Democrats&#x27; heavy losses in the 1938 mid-term elections—assumes that by 1938–39 Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal had failed due to the constant attacks by his opponents, that in the 1940 election, Roosevelt would prove unelectable, that his downfall would drag the Democratic Party to ruin and that a sharp drift to the Right would culminate in an extreme-right dictatorship in the late 1940s—which would, however, prove short-lived and after which the pendulum would swing sharply to the Left again.

Heinlein assigned to Fiorello H. La Guardia—at the time of writing a reformer Mayor of New York and outspoken supporter of Roosevelt, despite being nominally a Republican—the role of picking up FDR&#x27;s torch, as a militant reforming President in the 1950s who would lead a head-on confrontation with the banking system, effectively nationalize the banks and institute the system of Social Credit.

Several decades later, a John Delano Roosevelt is mentioned among the six highly regarded reformers who revise the US Constitution and institute the new regime seen in 2086.

===Economic independence===
At a number of points in &quot;For Us, the Living&quot;, Heinlein describes an environment in which individuals are able to choose whether or not to accept a job. Passing references are made to the large number of individuals who take up art or other careers that traditionally do not pay well. The book also points out the short working hours and high wages paid to employees. The book ascribes this flexible working environment to the social credit system (the &quot;Dividend&quot;) adopted by the United States which provides enough new capital in the economic system to overcome the problems of overproduction while providing a guaranteed minimal income for all members of society.

&quot;For Us, the Living&quot; also depicts an early example of homesourcing in fiction. The character of Diana, a nationally renowned dancer, is shown performing in her own home for a broadcast audience, which sees her dancing on sets added by the broadcasting company to her original feed. The mechanism for this homesourcing is not described in much technical detail, but it appears to be similar to a high-definition video signal interfaced with something like modern chroma key technology.

The biggest economic impact in the book, however, is Heinlein&#x27;s Social Credit system, that he takes many pains to explain: the Heritage Check System, an alternative form of government funding, in place of taxation. The heritage check system is a moderately altered Social Credit system. Its modification reflects Heinlein&#x27;s more libertarian views and Heinlein&#x27;s interpretation on how financial systems are affected by the relationship between consumption and production.

The system could be construed as a libertarian&#x27;s approach to a socialist idea, creating an alternative to a tax system that puts fewer requirements on individuals, while simultaneously providing more for the common welfare. This is not too surprising, as Heinlein (a proclaimed libertarian) was also fascinated by the Social Credit plan that appeared in Canada in the 1930s. In this role, the government becomes less a part of the economy and more a facilitator of it.

The Heritage System in &quot;For Us, the Living&quot; can be summarized by four major actions:

# A required end to fractional reserve banking. Banks must always have a 100% reserve for any loan they give out.
# New money is printed only by the government, and then, only enough to counteract the natural deflation that would occur in a system without fractional reserve banking.
# The government uses this money (and only this money), divided among all of its necessary roles. Any extra is divided evenly among citizens and businesses that over-produce, to offset the loss of not selling their over-production (the government buying the over-production for its own use, which can be bought by citizens later if they so desire at the same price.)
# Goods bought by the government are later sold by the government (or used by it), and normal governmental services (such as postage) are sold. These goods and services provide the standard backing for the currency, similar to how gold is used to back the gold standard.

Dealing with government funding in this way is theorized to stabilize an economy, and deals with the production/consumption problem that Heinlein claims to exist with more conventional economic systems:

A production cycle creates exactly enough purchasing power for its consumption cycle. If any part of this potential purchasing is not used for consumption but instead is invested in new production, it appears as a cost charge in the new items of production, before it re-appears as new purchasing power. Therefore, it causes a net loss of purchasing power in the earlier cycle. Therefore, an equal amount of new money is required by the country.

In addition to stabilizing the economy, it is theorized to have the added benefit of being a system where Federal taxes would not be needed for Government function, and only be needed for regulatory measures (e.g. enforcing environmental standards, corporations being taxed for not meeting government requirements, tariffs that exist purely to discourage buying from certain locations, wealth redistribution, etc.)

The system also makes note of the fact that government spending and government taxing are not only not related, both can happen in the complete absence of the other (especially in a heritage check system), and that as far as market effect, taxing causes deflation and Government spending causes inflation. He notes this, and that as a result, the value of money can be completely and totally controlled, making the currency as stable as it is desired to be.

===Social and governmental===
&quot;For Us, the Living&quot; also depicts graphically the transition between the society that Perry left in 1939 and how it is transformed through a series of acts by the Government. Of specific note is the &quot;War Voting Act&quot;. In this act, if the United States wished to engage in armed conflict with any other country, a national referendum was required to be held. Voting on a war is limited to citizens eligible for military service and not currently in the military. In the event that the article was passed and the country was to go to war, those who had voted for war were the first to be enlisted in the armed forces, those who did not vote were the second group conscripted, and those who voted &quot;No&quot; were the third group. Heinlein states that in the history of the &quot;War Voting Act&quot;, the process had been enacted three times, and all three times the entire citizenry were actively engaged in very vocal debate as to whether the conflict was warranted. All three times, he states, the measures to go to war were defeated.

After the transition has been completed, the social norms of the society are effectively transformed. One of the most pervasive, is the distinction between &quot;public sphere&quot; and &quot;private sphere&quot;. The society as a whole respects privacy in what are considered private sphere events, such as intimacy, closeness, interpersonal relationships and even identity in business and governmental transactions. As there is a great deal of information in the society, this becomes rather critical in moving the society toward a point away from information fetishism and toward a society where persons have respect for one another&#x27;s privacy and work as a society for the betterment of all.

==Career==
In 1993, Cantoral appeared in &quot;Dos mujeres, un camino&quot; with Erik Estrada, Laura León, Bibi Gaytán, Lorena Herrera, Selena Quintanilla, Jorge Salinas, and members of Grupo Bronco. This production exposed her to wider audiences in Mexico and Latin America. She took the role of the villain Soraya Montenegro in &quot;María la del Barrio&quot; from 1995 to 1996, alongside Thalía and Fernando Colunga. In 1996 and 1997 she appeared in &quot;Tú y yo&quot;, with Maribel Guardia and Joan Sebastian; and in &quot;Salud, dinero y amor&quot;, the sequel to Mexican telenovela &quot;El premio mayor&quot;.

In 2001, Cantoral played the antagonic role of Raquel Villavicencio in &quot;Sin Pecado Concebido&quot;, another Televisa production starring Angelica Rivera and Carlos Ponce. She starred in the Brazilian-American co-production &quot;Vale todo&quot; in 2002; and in 2003, Telemundo&#x27;s &quot;El alma herida&quot;, as a teenage girl who crosses the Mexican–American border to find her long-lost mother.

<text>Giorgio Armani (; born 11 July 1934) is an Italian fashion designer. He first gained renown working for Cerruti and then for many others, including Allegri, Bagutta, and Hilton. He formed his company, Armani, in 1975, which eventually expanded into music, sport, and luxury hotels. By 2001, Armani was acclaimed as the most successful designer of Italian origin, and is credited with pioneering red-carpet fashion.

== Early years ==
Armani was born in the northern Italian town of Piacenza, where he was raised with his older brother Sergio and younger sister Rosanna by his mother Maria Raimondi and father Ugo Armani (an accountant for a transport company).

While at secondary school at the Liceo Scientifico Leonardo da Vinci in Milan, Armani aspired to follow a career in medicine, particularly after reading A. J. Cronin&#x27;s &quot;The Citadel&quot;. He enrolled in the department of medicine at the University of Milan, but in 1953 after attending for three years, he left and joined the army. Due to his medical educational background, he was assigned to the Military Hospital in Verona, where he would attend shows at the Arena. He eventually decided to look for a different career path.

== Design career ==
After serving in the military for two years, Armani became a window dresser and sales clerk at La Rinascente, a department store in Milan in 1957. In that same year at the store, he was responsible for showcasing the earliest garments of the innovative Finnish textiles, clothing, and home furnishings company, Marimekko. He went on to become a seller for the menswear department. In that capacity, he gained valuable experience in the marketing aspect of the fashion industry. In the mid-1960s, Armani moved to the Nino Cerruti company, where he designed menswear. His skills were in demand, and for the next decade, while continuing to work for Cerruti, Armani also freelanced, contributing designs to as many as ten manufacturers at a time. 

In the late 1960s, Armani met Sergio Galeotti, an architectural draftsman, which marked the beginning of a personal and professional relationship that lasted for many years. In 1973, Galeotti persuaded him to open a design office in Milan, at 37 Corso Venezia. This led to a period of extensive collaboration, during which Armani worked as a freelance designer for several fashion houses, including Allegri, Bagutta, Hilton, Sicons, Gibò, Montedoro, and Tendresse. The international press was quick to acknowledge Armani&#x27;s importance following the runway shows at the Sala Bianca in the Pitti Palace in Florence. The experience allowed Armani to develop his style in new ways. He was now ready to devote his energy to his own label, and on 24 July 1975, he founded Giorgio Armani S.p.A. in Milan, with his friend Galeotti. In October of that same year, he presented his first collection of men&#x27;s ready-to-wear for Spring and Summer of 1976 under his own name. He also produced a women&#x27;s line for the same season. 

Italian manufacturers had begun to invest in local designers and did so on unusually favourable terms. They financed production and marketing and paid the designers a percentage of the profits. New designers such as Armani could begin their businesses free from debt, with ambitious fashion shows and advertising campaigns. 

Over the years the designer has made it very evident that he chooses not only to support the fashion industry, but to add to the art field as well. The information provided by The Museum of Modern Art gives an example of how in 1990 Armani supported the New York show, Pier Paolo Pasolini: The Eyes of a Poet. This show was an exhibition taking an inside look into artist Pasolini, specifically, it presented people twenty-two films. Although, Pasolini was known for a plethora of things, knowing that he created works mostly in the form of film or writing shows another side of Armani demonstrating an example of his appreciation of the arts. 

 Armani established an innovative relationship with the fashion industry, characterized by the 1978 agreement with Gruppo Finanzario Tessile (GFT), which made it possible to produce luxury ready-to-wear in a manufacturing environment under the attentive supervision of the company&#x27;s designer. In 1979, after founding the Giorgio Armani Corporation, Armani began producing for the United States and introduced the Main line for men and women. The label became one of the leading names in international fashion with the introduction of several new product lines, including G. A. Le Collezioni, Giorgio Armani Underwear and Swimwear, and Giorgio Armani Accessories. In the early 1980s, the company signed an important agreement with L&#x27;Oréal to create perfumes and cosmetics Armani Beauty and introduced the Armani Junior, Armani Jeans, and Emporio Armani lines, followed in 1982 by the introduction of Emporio Underwear, Swimwear, and Accessories. A new store was opened in Milan for the Emporio line, followed by the first Giorgio Armani boutique. Armani&#x27;s concern for the end user culminated in the development of a more youthful product with the same level of stylistic quality as his high-end line, but at a more accessible price. Because of the nature of the Emporio line, Armani felt that he had to make use of new and unconventional advertising methods. These included television spots and enormous street ads, together with a house magazine that was sent out by mail to consumers, and faithful Armani Eagle wearers. 

Armani also felt that a relationship with the cinema was essential, both for promotional reasons and for creative stimulus. In 1980, Armani was involved in the costume-making of the film &quot;American Gigolo&quot;, specifically for actor Richard Gere who played the main character Julian Kaye. The production of his work through film helped to publicize Armani&#x27;s name, what with Gere wrenching open a drawer of Armani shirts, perfectly folded, labels exposed, before composing four entirely Armani outfits in the film. This connection to the film industry projected his name and brand to a much broader audience. Armani designed costumes for more than one hundred films, one of the most important of which was &quot;The Untouchables&quot; (1987).

In 1983, the designer modified his agreement with GFT. They began to produce both the Mani line for the United States and his high-end ready-to-wear line, rechristened Borgonuovo 21, after the address of the company headquarters. During the late 1980s, despite Galeotti&#x27;s death in 1985, Armani continued to expand commercial horizons and licensing agreements. He opened Armani Japan and introduced a line of eyeglasses (1988), socks (1987), a gift collection (1989), and a new &quot;basic&quot; men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s line for America known as A/X Armani Exchange (1991). After the frenetic expansion of the 1990s (sportswear, watches, eyeglasses, cosmetics, home, and new accessories collections), 2000, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the brand, saw a flurry of investment activity, including stock sales and the acquisition of new manufacturing capacity intended to increase Armani&#x27;s control over the quality and distribution of his products.

Armani&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s skiwear and ski casualwear line was developed in 1995. His 1991 project, A/X: Armani Exchange, represented Armani&#x27;s attempt to break into the American mass market, offering lower prices for relaxed chic clothes.

In 1996 his long-time friend Eric Clapton composed songs for Armani&#x27;s fashion shows and has since dressed in Armani. Later that year Clapton opened two &quot;Emporio Armani&quot; stores in New York City. In 1998 Armani hosted a party for Clapton&#x27;s Crossroads guitar auction.

The &quot;Oxford Art Journal&quot; made note in their article, &quot;Hermes in Asia: Haute Couture, High Art and The Marketplace&quot;, that the designer took influences from other cultures as inspiration for some of his works and cited his Japanese designs as examples. Armani also prepared to break into the Chinese market by opening up his first store in that country in 1998. A small shop in Beijing was followed by a flagship store in Shanghai in 2004 and plans for 40 by 2011. In 2000, Giorgio Armani SpA was introducing new lines of cosmetics and home furnishings, and expanding its line of accessories. 

Armani has had a broad level of influence internationally because his work has reached far beyond just clothes and accessories of haute couture. His work can be referenced with many famous artists of the past who created other types of art. Because of how valuable and detailed his job is, it often forms a bridge from fashion to art. An example is the Guggenheim Museum in New York hosted an exhibition of Armani&#x27;s work – a first for a living designer – with an average attendance of 29,000 a week. This is referenced in the periodical The Aesthetics of Smelly Art, inside the Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism.

In 2008, Armani designed a bullfighting costume entitled the &quot;Goyesco&quot; that was worn by Spanish bullfighter Cayetano Rivera Ordóñez at the &quot;Corrida Goyesca&quot; in Ronda, Spain. They have also collaborated on several fashion shows and other events.

In 2011, Armani became the first luxury designer to accept Livia Firth&#x27;s Green Carpet Challenge to highlight sustainable fashion created out of recycled plastics and fabrics. His designs for the challenge were a dress for her and a tuxedo for her then-husband, actor Colin Firth.

As of 2009, Armani had a retail network of 60 Giorgio Armani boutiques, 11 Collezioni, 122 Emporio Armani, 94 A/X Armani Exchange, 1 Giorgio Armani Accessori, and 13 Armani Junior stores spread over 37 countries. As of 2017, he had an annual turnover of $1.6 billion and a personal fortune of $8.1 billion.

In 2015, Giorgio Armani was an artist who was a part of the Paris Photography Public Programme. This event helped showcase a variety of special exhibitions. As an official partner, Armani&#x27;s ACQUA #6, represented works that focus on the theme of water in photography. 

In 2001, Armani was acclaimed as the most successful designer of Italian origin.

In 2019, Giorgio Armani introduced his first fine jewelry collection during Haute Couture Week in Paris. The 2022 &quot;Josephine&quot; collection, inspired by Joséphine de Beauharnais, incorporated paisley motifs with chalcedony and grey diamonds. His fine jewelry has since been worn by celebrities, including Sophia Loren, Brie Larson, and Brooke Shields, at high-profile events.

==Innovations==
Armani is credited with pioneering red-carpet fashion.

Armani was the first designer to ban models with a body mass index (BMI) under 18, after model Ana Carolina Reston starved herself to death due to anorexia nervosa.

Armani broadcast his collection live on the Internet, the first in the world of haute couture, on 24 January 2007. The Armani Privé Spring/Summer 2007 fashion show was broadcast via MSN and Cingular cellular phones.

Armani has designed many stage outfits for pop superstar Lady Gaga, including those worn on her record-breaking Monster Ball Tour and Born This Way Ball Tour. He has also designed for many high-profile award shows, such as the 52nd Grammy Awards and the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards.

== Armani Hotel Collection ==
Giorgio Armani and Emaar Properties PJSC signed an agreement in 2005 for Emaar Properties PJSC to build and operate at least seven luxury hotels and three vacation resorts under the Giorgio Armani name. Giorgio Armani would be responsible for overseeing all aspects of the interior design and style of the hotels.

The Armani Hotel was opened in Burj Khalifa on 27 April 2010, comprising the bottom 39 floors of the supertall skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates; it has 160 guest rooms and suites, and 144 residences. Giorgio Armani is also designing the interiors of the Armani Residences, also within the skyscraper, and its specially designed line of products from the Armani/Casa home furnishings collection.

==Music==
Armani Musica presents Emporio Armani Caffè compilations, a series of special CD compilations curated by Giorgio Armani with DJ-sound designer Matteo Ceccarini, offering an eclectic mix of conceptual sounds and underground rhythms.

==Sport==
Giorgio Armani has a keen interest in sports. He is the president of the Olimpia Milano basketball team, and an Inter Milan fan. 

Armani has twice designed suits for the England national football team. He has since designed suits worn by players of the London club Chelsea since August 2007. 

He designed the Italian flag bearers&#x27; outfits at the opening ceremony at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, and also designed Italy&#x27;s Olympic uniforms for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Armani also designed and introduced the EA7 range, a brand inspired by Ukrainian footballer Andriy Shevchenko, who at the time played for A.C. Milan and wore the number 7 jersey. As regards sports, Armani owns Italian basketball club Olimpia Milano and has designed uniforms for the Italian Olympic and Paralympic teams.

Chelsea commissioned Armani to create a new look for its Directors&#x27; Suite at Stamford Bridge.

Beginning in 2021, Giorgio Armani entered into a multi-year sponsorship agreement as an official supplier to Scuderia Ferrari. Armani will provide official and travel ensembles to members of the team in return for brand exposure and association with the world&#x27;s number-one brand and most popular motorsport team.

==Personal life==
Armani is an intensely private man, but has publicly identified as bisexual. He had a longstanding relationship with his business partner, the fashion designer Sergio Galeotti, who died of a heart attack in 1985. He has some relatives in the United States as well. Giorgio Armani spends much of his time according to family on his over 200 ft yacht and loves sailing.

<text>Scientific literature encompasses a vast body of academic papers that spans various disciplines within the natural and social sciences. It primarily consists of academic papers that present original empirical research and theoretical contributions. These papers serve as essential sources of knowledge and are commonly referred to simply as &quot;the literature&quot; within specific research fields.

The process of academic publishing involves disseminating research findings to a wider audience. Researchers submit their work to reputable journals or conferences, where it undergoes rigorous evaluation by experts in the field. This evaluation, known as peer review, ensures the quality, validity, and reliability of the research before it becomes part of the scientific literature. Peer-reviewed publications contribute significantly to advancing our understanding of the world and shaping future research endeavors.

Original scientific research first published in scientific journals constitutes primary literature. Patents and technical reports, which cover minor research results and engineering and design efforts, including computer software, are also classified as primary literature.

Secondary sources comprise review articles that summarize the results of published studies to underscore progress and new research directions, as well as books that tackle extensive projects or comprehensive arguments, including article compilations.

Tertiary sources encompass encyclopedias and similar works designed for widespread public consumption.

== Types of scientific publications ==
Scientific literature can include the following kinds of publications:

* Scientific articles published in scientific journals.
* Patents in the relevant subject (for example, biological patents and chemical patents).
* Books wholly written by one author or a few co-authors.
* Edited volumes, where each chapter is the responsibility of a different author or group of authors, while the editor is responsible for determining the scope of the project, keeping the work on schedule, and ensuring consistency of style and content.
* Presentations at academic conferences, especially those organized by learned societies.
* Government reports such as a forensic investigation conducted by a government agency such as the NTSB.
* Scientific publications on the World Wide Web (although e.g. scientific journals are now commonly published on the web).
* Books, technical reports, pamphlets, and working papers issued by individual researchers or research organizations on their own initiative; these are sometimes organized into a series.

Literature may also be published in areas considered to be &quot;grey&quot;, as they are published outside of traditional channels. This material is customarily not indexed by major databases and can include manuals, theses and dissertations, or newsletters and bulletins.

The significance of different types of the scientific publications can vary between disciplines and change over time. According to James G. Speight and Russell Foote, peer-reviewed journals are the most prominent and prestigious form of publication. University presses are more prestigious than commercial press publication. The status of working papers and conference proceedings depends on the discipline; they are typically more important in the applied sciences. The value of publication as a preprint or scientific report on the web has in the past been low, but in some subjects, such as mathematics or high energy physics, it is now an accepted alternative.

=== Scientific papers and articles ===
Scientific papers have been categorised into ten types. Eight of these carry specific objectives, while the other two can vary depending on the style and the intended goal.

Papers that carry specific objectives are:

* An &quot;original article&quot; provides new information from original research supported by evidence.
* &quot;Case reports&quot; are unique events that researchers read to obtain information on the subject.
* A &quot;technical note&quot; is a description of a technique or piece of equipment that has been modified from an existing one to be new and more effective.
* A &quot;pictorial essay&quot; is a series of high-quality images published for teaching purposes.
* A &quot;review&quot; is a detailed analysis of recent developments on a topic.
* A &quot;commentary&quot; is a short summary of an author&#x27;s personal experience.
* &quot;Editorials&quot; are short reviews or critiques of original articles.
* &quot;Letters to the editor&quot; are communications directed to the editor of an article to ask questions and provide constructive criticism.

The following two categories are variable, including for example historical articles and speeches:

* &quot;Nonscientific material&quot;: This type of material comes from the result of an article being published. It does not advance an article scientifically but instead contributes to its reputation as a scientific article.
* &quot;Other&quot;: Other types of papers not listed under non-scientific material or in any of the above eight categories. They can vary depending on the objective and style of the article.

== Scientific article ==

=== Preparation ===
The actual day-to-day records of scientific information are kept in research notebooks or logbooks. These are usually kept indefinitely as the basic evidence of the work, and are often kept in duplicate, signed, notarized, and archived. The purpose is to preserve the evidence for scientific priority, and in particular for priority for obtaining patents. They have also been used in scientific disputes. Since the availability of computers, the notebooks in some data-intensive fields have been kept as database records, and appropriate software is commercially available.

The work on a project is typically published as one or more technical reports, or articles. In some fields both are used, with preliminary reports, working papers, or preprints followed by a formal article. Articles are usually prepared at the end of a project, or at the end of components of a particularly large one. In preparing such an article vigorous rules for scientific writing have to be followed.

=== Language ===
Often, career advancement depends upon publishing in high-impact journals, which, especially in hard and applied sciences, are usually published in English. Consequently, scientists with poor English writing skills are at a disadvantage when trying to publish in these journals, regardless of the quality of the scientific study itself. Yet many international universities require publication in these high-impact journals by both their students and faculty. One way that some international authors are beginning to overcome this problem is by contracting with freelance copy editors who are native speakers of English and specialize in ESL (English as a second language) editing to polish their manuscripts&#x27; English to a level that high-impact journals will accept.

=== Structure and style ===
Although the content of an article is more important than the format, it is customary for scientific articles to follow a standard structure, which varies only slightly in different subjects. Although the IMRAD structure emphasizes the organization of content, and in scientific journal articles, each section (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) has unique conventions for scientific writing style.

The following are key guidelines for formatting, although each journal etc will to some extent have its own house style:

*The &quot;title&quot; attracts readers&#x27; attention and informs them about the contents of the article. Titles are distinguished into three main types: declarative titles (state the main conclusion), descriptive titles (describe a paper&#x27;s content), and interrogative titles (challenge readers with a question that is answered in the text). Some journals indicate, in their instructions to authors, the type (and length) of permitted titles.
*The names and affiliations of all &quot;authors&quot; are given. In the wake of some scientific misconduct cases, publishers often require that all co-authors know and agree on the content of the article.
*An &quot;abstract&quot; summarizes the work (in a single paragraph or in several short paragraphs) and is intended to represent the article in bibliographic databases and to furnish subject metadata for indexing services.
*The &quot;context&quot; of previous scientific investigations should be presented, by citation of relevant documents in the existing literature, usually in a section called an &quot;Introduction&quot;.
*&quot;Empirical techniques&quot;, laid out in a section usually called &quot;Materials and Methods&quot;, should be described in such a way that a subsequent scientist, with appropriate knowledge of and experience in the relevant field, should be able to repeat the observations and know whether he or she has obtained the same result. This naturally varies between subjects, and does not apply to mathematics and related subjects.
*Similarly, the &quot;results&quot; of the investigation, in a section usually called &quot;Results&quot;, should be presented in tabular or graphic form (image, chart, schematic, diagram or drawing). These display elements should be accompanied by a caption and should be discussed in the text of the article.
*&quot;Interpretation&quot; of the meaning of the results is usually addressed in a &quot;Discussion&quot; or &quot;Conclusions&quot; section. The conclusions drawn should be based on the new empirical results while taking established knowledge into consideration, in such a way that any reader with knowledge of the field can follow the argument and confirm that the conclusions are sound. That is, acceptance of the conclusions must not depend on personal authority, rhetorical skill, or faith.
*Finally, a &quot;References&quot; or &quot;Literature Cited&quot; section lists the &quot;sources&quot; cited by the authors.

== Peer review ==
Increasing reliance on digital abstracting services and academic search engines means that the &quot;de facto&quot; acceptance in the academic discourse is predicted by the inclusion in such selective sources. Commercial providers of proprietary data include Chemical Abstracts Service, Web of Science and Scopus, while open data (and often open source, non-profit and library-led) services include DOAB, DOAJ and (for open access works) Unpaywall (based on CrossRef and Microsoft Academic records enriched with OAI-PMH data from open archives).

== Ethics ==
The transfer of copyright from author to publisher, used by some journals, can be controversial because many authors want to propagate their ideas more widely and re-use their material elsewhere without the need for permission. Usually an author or authors circumvent that problem by rewriting an article and using other pictures. Some publishers may also want publicity for their journal so will approve facsimile reproduction unconditionally; other publishers are more resistant.

In scientific publishing, a number of key issues include and are not restricted to:
* Honesty and integrity is a duty of each author and person, expert-reviewer and member of journal editorial boards.
* The peer review process contributes to quality control and it is an essential step to ascertain the standing and originality of the research.
**Redundant publications: Publications generally should contain new unpublished material.
**Data fabrication is the process of purposefully changing data to make the information more in the favor of the author.
* Ethical standards: Recent journal editorials presented some experience of unscrupulous activities.
** Human welfare concerns: The guidelines for human experimentation started during WWII with the Nuremberg Code. It has evolved into three main principles from The Belmont Report. The subject must be able to make their own choices to protect themselves, benefits must outweigh the risks, and subjects must be evaluated for their selection and benefits must go to all of society.
**Animal welfare concerns: Is the ethical care of animals in scientific experiments. The APS has set strict guidelines and regulations to stop animals from being unnecessarily harmed in experiments. These are being updated regularly by the APS and is a federal law in the United States enforced by DHHS.
* Authorship: Who may claim a right to authorship? In which order should the authors be listed?
**Conflicts of interest: This refers to biases due to private interest. It can be done knowingly or not. This is unethical because it makes data inaccurate.
**Authorship disputes: The authorship of an article is simply the author of the article. The ethical issue with this is when there are two people that believe to be the author, but there is only one true author. There are guidelines to help pick which get authorship of the writing. The one that does not get authorship is put in the acknowledgments. The guidelines come from NIH and The Council of Science Editors.
== History ==
The first recorded editorial pre-publication peer-review occurred in 1665 by the founding editor of &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot;, Henry Oldenburg.

Technical and scientific books were a specialty of David Van Nostrand, and his Engineering Magazine re-published contemporary scientific articles.

<text>Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (Marie Louise Victoire; 17 August 1786 – 16 March 1861), later Princess of Leiningen and subsequently Duchess of Kent and Strathearn, was a German princess and the mother of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. As the widow of Charles, Prince of Leiningen, from 1814, she served as regent of the Principality during the minority of her son from her first marriage, Karl, until her second wedding in 1818 to Prince Edward, fourth son of George III.

==Early life ==
Victoria was born in Coburg on 17 August 1786 in the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation and was named &quot;Marie Louise Victoire&quot;. She was the fourth daughter and seventh child of Franz Frederick Anton, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and Countess Augusta Reuss of Ebersdorf.
One of her brothers was Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, and another brother, Leopold, future king of the Belgians, married, in 1816, Princess Charlotte of Wales, the only legitimate daughter of the future King George IV, and heiress presumptive to the British throne.

== Marriages ==

===First marriage===
On 21 December 1803 at Coburg, a young Victoria married (as his second wife) Emich Carl, Prince of Leiningen, whose first wife, Countess Henrietta Sophie of Reuss-Ebersdorf (1767–1801), was her aunt. The couple had two children, Prince Carl, born on 12 September 1804, and Princess Feodora of Leiningen, born on 7 December 1807.

===Regency===
After the death of her first spouse (on 4 July 1814), she served as regent of the Principality of Leiningen during the minority of their son, Carl, until her second marriage in 1818.

===Second marriage===
The death of Princess Charlotte of Wales, the wife of Victoria&#x27;s brother Leopold, in 1817, prompted a succession crisis. With Parliament offering them a financial incentive, three of Charlotte&#x27;s uncles, sons of King George III, were prepared to marry. One of them, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, proposed to Victoria and she accepted. The couple were married on 29 May 1818 at Schloss Ehrenburg, Coburg and on 11 July 1818 at Kew, a joint ceremony at which Edward&#x27;s brother, the Duke of Clarence and St Andrews, later King William IV, married Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen. Shortly after their marriage, the Kents moved to Germany, where the cost of living was cheaper. Soon after, Victoria became pregnant, and the Duke and Duchess, determined to have their child born in England, raced back. Arriving at Dover on 23 April 1819, they moved into Kensington Palace, where Victoria gave birth to a daughter on 24 May 1819, Princess Alexandrina Victoria of Kent, later Queen Victoria. An efficient organiser, Sir John Conroy, ensured the Kents&#x27; speedy return to England in time for the birth of their first child.

==Widowhood==

The Duke of Kent died suddenly of pneumonia in January 1820, six days before his father, King George III. His widow the Duchess had little cause to remain in the United Kingdom, since she did not speak the language and had a palace at home in Coburg where she could live cheaply on the revenues of her first husband. However, the British succession at this time was far from assured – of the three brothers older than Edward, the new king, George IV, and the Duke of York were both estranged from their wives, who were in any case past childbearing age. The third brother, the Duke of Clarence, had yet to produce any surviving children with his wife. The Duchess of Kent decided that she would do better by gambling on her daughter&#x27;s accession than by living quietly in Coburg and, having inherited her second husband&#x27;s debts, sought support from the British government. After the death of Edward and his father, the young Princess Victoria was still only third in line for the throne, and Parliament was not inclined to support yet more impoverished royalty.

The provision made for the Duchess of Kent was mean: she resided in a suite of rooms in the dilapidated Kensington Palace, along with several other impoverished members of the royal family, and received little financial support from the Civil List, since Parliament had vivid memories of the late Duke&#x27;s extravagance. In practice, a main source of support for her was her brother, Leopold. The latter had a huge income of fifty thousand pounds per annum for life, representing an annuity allotted to him by the British Parliament on his marriage to Princess Charlotte, which had made him seem likely to become in due course the consort of the monarch. Even after Charlotte&#x27;s death, Leopold&#x27;s annuity was not revoked by Parliament.

In 1831, with George IV dead and the new king William IV (formerly the Duke of Clarence) being over 60 without any surviving legitimate issue, and whose nearly 40-year-old wife was considered to be at the end of childbearing age, the young princess&#x27;s status as heir presumptive and the Duchess&#x27;s prospective place as regent led to major increases in British state income for the Kents. Parliament agreed an annuity for the Duchess and her daughter in August 1831. A contributing factor was Leopold&#x27;s designation as King of the Belgians, upon which he surrendered his British income.

Circa 1836 the Duchess composed The Royal Artillery Slow March, which has remained in regular use since its first performance circa 1843.

==Royal feud==

Together in a hostile environment, John Conroy&#x27;s relationship with the Duchess was very close, with him serving as her comptroller and private secretary for the next nineteen years, as well as holding the unofficial roles of public relations officer, counsellor, confidant and political agent. While it is not clear which of the two was more responsible for devising the Kensington System, it was created to govern young Victoria&#x27;s upbringing. The intention was for the Duchess to be appointed regent upon Victoria&#x27;s (assumed youthful) succession and for Conroy to be created Victoria&#x27;s private secretary and given a peerage. The Duchess and Conroy continued to be unpopular with the royal family and, in 1829, the Duke of Cumberland spread rumours that they were lovers in an attempt to discredit them. The Duke of Clarence referred to Conroy as &quot;King John&quot;, while the Duchess of Clarence wrote to the Duchess of Kent to advise that she was increasingly isolating herself from the royal family and that she must not grant Conroy too much power.

The Duchess of Kent was extremely protective, and raised Victoria largely isolated from other children under the so-called &quot;Kensington System&quot;. The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable (including most of her father&#x27;s family), and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them. The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of King William&#x27;s illegitimate children, and perhaps prompted the emergence of Victorian morality by insisting that her daughter avoid any appearance of sexual impropriety. Victoria shared a bedroom with her mother every night, studied with private tutors to a regular timetable, and spent her play-hours with her dolls and her King Charles Spaniel, Dash.

Perhaps because of Conroy&#x27;s influence, the relationship between the Duchess&#x27;s household and William IV soon soured, with the Duchess regarding the King as an oversexed oaf. As far as she dared, the Duchess denied the King access to his niece. She prevented her daughter from attending William&#x27;s coronation out of a disagreement of precedence, a decision attributed by the Duke of Wellington to Conroy. In 1831, the year of William&#x27;s coronation, Conroy and the Duchess embarked on a series of royal tours with Victoria to expose her to the people and solidify their status as potential regents. Their efforts were ultimately successful and, in November 1831, it was declared that the Duchess would be sole regent in the event of Victoria&#x27;s young queenship. The Duchess further offended the King by taking rooms in Kensington Palace that the King had reserved for himself, and she snubbed his illegitimate children, the FitzClarences, before and during his reign.

Both the King and Queen Adelaide were fond of their niece, but their attempts to forge a close relationship with the girl were frustrated by the conflict with the Duchess of Kent. The King, angered at what he took to be disrespect from the Duchess to his wife, took the opportunity at what proved to be his final birthday banquet in August 1836 to settle the score. Speaking to those assembled at the banquet, who included the Duchess and Princess Victoria, William expressed his hope that he would survive until Princess Victoria was 18 so that the Duchess of Kent would never be regent. He said,

I trust to God that my life may be spared for nine months longer ... I should then have the satisfaction of leaving the exercise of the Royal authority to the personal authority of that young lady, heiress presumptive to the Crown, and not in the hands of a person now near me, who is surrounded by evil advisers and is herself incompetent to act with propriety in the situation in which she would be placed.

The breach between the Duchess and the King and Queen was never fully healed, but Victoria always viewed both of them with kindness.
Conroy had high hopes for his patroness and himself: he envisaged Victoria succeeding to the throne at a young age, thus needing a regency government, which, following the Regency Act 1830, would be headed by the princess&#x27;s mother (who had already served in that capacity in Germany following the death of her first husband). As the personal secretary of the Duchess, Conroy would be the veritable &quot;power behind the throne&quot;. He had not counted on William IV surviving long enough for Victoria to come of age and be able to succeed to the throne as an adult and consequently, while cultivating her mother, had shown little consideration for Victoria. When the latter succeeded, Conroy risked having no influence over her. He tried to force Victoria to agree to make him her personal secretary once she succeeded, but this plan, too, backfired. Victoria resented her mother&#x27;s support for Conroy&#x27;s schemes and being pressured by her to sign a paper declaring Conroy her personal secretary. The result was that when Victoria became queen, she relegated the Duchess to separate accommodations, away from her own.

==Reconciliation==

When the Queen&#x27;s first child, the Princess Royal, was born, the Duchess of Kent unexpectedly found herself welcomed back into Victoria&#x27;s inner circle. It is likely that this came about as a result of the dismissal of Baroness Lehzen at the behest of Victoria&#x27;s husband (and the Duchess&#x27;s nephew), Prince Albert. Firstly, this removed Lehzen&#x27;s influence, and Lehzen had long despised the Duchess and Conroy, suspecting them of an illicit affair. Secondly, it left the Queen wholly open to Albert&#x27;s influence, and he likely prevailed upon her to reconcile with her mother. Thirdly, Conroy by now lived in exile on the Continent and so his divisive influence was removed. The Duchess&#x27;s finances, which had been left in shambles by Conroy, were restored thanks to Victoria and her advisors. By all accounts, the Duchess became a doting grandmother and was closer to her daughter than she ever had been.
==Rumours of affairs==
Historian A. N. Wilson suggests that Victoria&#x27;s father could not have been the Duke of Kent for two reasons:
* The sudden appearance of hæmophilia in the descendants of Victoria. The illness did not exist in the royal family before.
* The supposed disappearance of porphyria from the descendants of Victoria. According to Wilson, the disease was prevalent in the royal family before Victoria but not afterwards.

In practice, Wilson&#x27;s first reason would have required the Duchess&#x27;s lover to be haemophiliac – an extremely unlikely survival, given the poor state of medicine at the time, or the Duchess herself to be a carrier of haemophilia, since haemophilia is X-linked, meaning that her mother would have been a carrier, if haemophilia was not otherwise previously expressed in the Duchess&#x27;s parents. Actual evidence to support this theory has not arisen. Haemophilia occurs spontaneously through mutation in at least 30% of cases, and especially in children of older fathers such as Victoria. Haemophilia in the descendants of Victoria was known at the time and among European royalty, including Romanoffs, was known as the &#x27;Coburg disease&#x27;.

As for Wilson&#x27;s second reason, there is evidence to suggest Victoria&#x27;s daughter, Empress Frederick, suffered from porphyria, and John Röhl&#x27;s book, &quot;Purple Secret&quot;, documents evidence of porphyria in Empress Frederick&#x27;s daughter Charlotte, and her granddaughter, Feodora. Röhl also claims that Prince William of Gloucester was diagnosed with porphyria shortly before he died in a flying accident. There is moreover no genetic evidence that the royal family ever had the disease: its diagnosis in George III&#x27;s case (and others) has been questioned.

==Death==

The Duchess died at 09:30 on 16 March 1861, aged 74 years, with her daughter Victoria at her side. The Queen was much affected by her mother&#x27;s death. Through reading her mother&#x27;s papers, Victoria discovered that her mother had loved her deeply; she was heart-broken, and blamed Conroy and Lehzen for &quot;wickedly&quot; estranging her from her mother. She is buried in the Duchess of Kent&#x27;s Mausoleum at Frogmore, Windsor Home Park, near to the royal residence Windsor Castle.

Queen Victoria and Albert dedicated a window in the Royal Chapel of All Saints in Windsor Great Park to her memory.

==Portrayal==
Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld was portrayed by Alison Leggatt in the ATV drama &quot;Edward the Seventh&quot;, by Penelope Wilton in the 2001 television serial &quot;Victoria and Albert&quot;, by Miranda Richardson in the 2009 film &quot;The Young Victoria&quot;, by Catherine Flemming in the 2016 ITV series &quot;Victoria&quot; and by Florence Dobson in the 2023 limited series &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, a time series is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order. Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus it is a sequence of discrete-time data. Examples of time series are heights of ocean tides, counts of sunspots, and the daily closing value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

A time series is very frequently plotted via a run chart (which is a temporal line chart). Time series are used in statistics, signal processing, pattern recognition, econometrics, mathematical finance, weather forecasting, earthquake prediction, electroencephalography, control engineering, astronomy, communications engineering, and largely in any domain of applied science and engineering which involves temporal measurements.

Time series &quot;analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data.Time series &quot;forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values. Generally, time series data is modelled as a stochastic process. While regression analysis is often employed in such a way as to test relationships between one or more different time series, this type of analysis is not usually called &quot;time series analysis&quot;, which refers in particular to relationships between different points in time within a single series.

Time series data have a natural temporal ordering. This makes time series analysis distinct from cross-sectional studies, in which there is no natural ordering of the observations (e.g. explaining people&#x27;s wages by reference to their respective education levels, where the individuals&#x27; data could be entered in any order). Time series analysis is also distinct from spatial data analysis where the observations typically relate to geographical locations (e.g. accounting for house prices by the location as well as the intrinsic characteristics of the houses). A stochastic model for a time series will generally reflect the fact that observations close together in time will be more closely related than observations further apart. In addition, time series models will often make use of the natural one-way ordering of time so that values for a given period will be expressed as deriving in some way from past values, rather than from future values (see time reversibility).

Time series analysis can be applied to real-valued, continuous data, discrete numeric data, or discrete symbolic data (i.e. sequences of characters, such as letters and words in the English language).

==Methods for analysis==
Methods for time series analysis may be divided into two classes: frequency-domain methods and time-domain methods. The former include spectral analysis and wavelet analysis; the latter include auto-correlation and cross-correlation analysis. In the time domain, correlation and analysis can be made in a filter-like manner using scaled correlation, thereby mitigating the need to operate in the frequency domain.

Additionally, time series analysis techniques may be divided into parametric and non-parametric methods. The parametric approaches assume that the underlying stationary stochastic process has a certain structure which can be described using a small number of parameters (for example, using an autoregressive or moving-average model). In these approaches, the task is to estimate the parameters of the model that describes the stochastic process. By contrast, non-parametric approaches explicitly estimate the covariance or the spectrum of the process without assuming that the process has any particular structure.

Methods of time series analysis may also be divided into linear and non-linear, and univariate and multivariate.

==Panel data==
A time series is one type of panel data. Panel data is the general class, a multidimensional data set, whereas a time series data set is a one-dimensional panel (as is a cross-sectional dataset). A data set may exhibit characteristics of both panel data and time series data. One way to tell is to ask what makes one data record unique from the other records. If the answer is the time data field, then this is a time series data set candidate. If determining a unique record requires a time data field and an additional identifier which is unrelated to time (e.g. student ID, stock symbol, country code), then it is panel data candidate. If the differentiation lies on the non-time identifier, then the data set is a cross-sectional data set candidate.

==Analysis==
There are several types of motivation and data analysis available for time series which are appropriate for different purposes.

===Motivation===
In the context of statistics, econometrics, quantitative finance, seismology, meteorology, and geophysics the primary goal of time series analysis is forecasting. In the context of signal processing, control engineering and communication engineering it is used for signal detection. Other applications are in data mining, pattern recognition and machine learning, where time series analysis can be used for clustering, classification, query by content, anomaly detection as well as forecasting.

===Exploratory analysis===


A simple way to examine a regular time series is manually with a line chart. The datagraphic shows tuberculosis deaths in the United States, along with the yearly change and the percentage change from year to year. The total number of deaths declined in every year until the mid-1980s, after which there were occasional increases, often proportionately - but not absolutely - quite large.

A study of corporate data analysts found two challenges to exploratory time series analysis: discovering the shape of interesting patterns, and finding an explanation for these patterns. Visual tools that represent time series data as heat map matrices can help overcome these challenges.

===Estimation, filtering, and smoothing===

This approach may be based on harmonic analysis and filtering of signals in the frequency domain using the Fourier transform, and spectral density estimation. Its development was significantly accelerated during World War II by mathematician Norbert Wiener, electrical engineers Rudolf E. Kálmán, Dennis Gabor and others for filtering signals from noise and predicting signal values at a certain point in time. 

An equivalent effect may be achieved in the time domain, as in a Kalman filter; see filtering and smoothing for more techniques.

Other related techniques include:
* Autocorrelation analysis to examine serial dependence
* Spectral analysis to examine cyclic behavior which need not be related to seasonality. For example, sunspot activity varies over 11 year cycles. Other common examples include celestial phenomena, weather patterns, neural activity, commodity prices, and economic activity.
* Separation into components representing trend, seasonality, slow and fast variation, and cyclical irregularity: see trend estimation and decomposition of time series

===Curve fitting===
Curve fitting is the process of constructing a curve, or mathematical function, that has the best fit to a series of data points, possibly subject to constraints. Curve fitting can involve either interpolation, where an exact fit to the data is required, or smoothing, in which a &quot;smooth&quot; function is constructed that approximately fits the data. A related topic is regression analysis, which focuses more on questions of statistical inference such as how much uncertainty is present in a curve that is fit to data observed with random errors. Fitted curves can be used as an aid for data visualization, to infer values of a function where no data are available, and to summarize the relationships among two or more variables. Extrapolation refers to the use of a fitted curve beyond the range of the observed data, and is subject to a degree of uncertainty since it may reflect the method used to construct the curve as much as it reflects the observed data.

For processes that are expected to generally grow in magnitude one of the curves in the graphic (and many others) can be fitted by estimating their parameters.

The construction of economic time series involves the estimation of some components for some dates by interpolation between values (&quot;benchmarks&quot;) for earlier and later dates. Interpolation is estimation of an unknown quantity between two known quantities (historical data), or drawing conclusions about missing information from the available information (&quot;reading between the lines&quot;). Interpolation is useful where the data surrounding the missing data is available and its trend, seasonality, and longer-term cycles are known. This is often done by using a related series known for all relevant dates. Alternatively polynomial interpolation or spline interpolation is used where piecewise polynomial functions are fitted in time intervals such that they fit smoothly together. A different problem which is closely related to interpolation is the approximation of a complicated function by a simple function (also called regression). The main difference between regression and interpolation is that polynomial regression gives a single polynomial that models the entire data set. Spline interpolation, however, yield a piecewise continuous function composed of many polynomials to model the data set.

Extrapolation is the process of estimating, beyond the original observation range, the value of a variable on the basis of its relationship with another variable. It is similar to interpolation, which produces estimates between known observations, but extrapolation is subject to greater uncertainty and a higher risk of producing meaningless results.

===Function approximation===

In general, a function approximation problem asks us to select a function among a well-defined class that closely matches (&quot;approximates&quot;) a target function in a task-specific way.
One can distinguish two major classes of function approximation problems: First, for known target functions, approximation theory is the branch of numerical analysis that investigates how certain known functions (for example, special functions) can be approximated by a specific class of functions (for example, polynomials or rational functions) that often have desirable properties (inexpensive computation, continuity, integral and limit values, etc.).

Second, the target function, call it &quot;g&quot;, may be unknown; instead of an explicit formula, only a set of points (a time series) of the form (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)) is provided. Depending on the structure of the domain and codomain of &quot;g&quot;, several techniques for approximating &quot;g&quot; may be applicable. For example, if &quot;g&quot; is an operation on the real numbers, techniques of interpolation, extrapolation, regression analysis, and curve fitting can be used. If the codomain (range or target set) of &quot;g&quot; is a finite set, one is dealing with a classification problem instead. A related problem of &quot;online&quot; time series approximation is to summarize the data in one-pass and construct an approximate representation that can support a variety of time series queries with bounds on worst-case error.

To some extent, the different problems (regression, classification, fitness approximation) have received a unified treatment in statistical learning theory, where they are viewed as supervised learning problems.

===Prediction and forecasting===
In statistics, prediction is a part of statistical inference. One particular approach to such inference is known as predictive inference, but the prediction can be undertaken within any of the several approaches to statistical inference. Indeed, one description of statistics is that it provides a means of transferring knowledge about a sample of a population to the whole population, and to other related populations, which is not necessarily the same as prediction over time. When information is transferred across time, often to specific points in time, the process is known as forecasting.
* Fully formed statistical models for stochastic simulation purposes, so as to generate alternative versions of the time series, representing what might happen over non-specific time-periods in the future
* Simple or fully formed statistical models to describe the likely outcome of the time series in the immediate future, given knowledge of the most recent outcomes (forecasting).
* Forecasting on time series is usually done using automated statistical software packages and programming languages, such as Julia, Python, R, SAS, SPSS and many others.
* Forecasting on large scale data can be done with Apache Spark using the Spark-TS library, a third-party package.

===Classification===

Assigning time series pattern to a specific category, for example identify a word based on series of hand movements in sign language.

===Segmentation===

Splitting a time-series into a sequence of segments. It is often the case that a time-series can be represented as a sequence of individual segments, each with its own characteristic properties. For example, the audio signal from a conference call can be partitioned into pieces corresponding to the times during which each person was speaking. In time-series segmentation, the goal is to identify the segment boundary points in the time-series, and to characterize the dynamical properties associated with each segment. One can approach this problem using change-point detection, or by modeling the time-series as a more sophisticated system, such as a Markov jump linear system.

=== Clustering ===
Time series data may be clustered, however special care has to be taken when considering subsequence clustering.
Time series clustering may be split into 
* whole time series clustering (multiple time series for which to find a cluster)
* subsequence time series clustering (single timeseries, split into chunks using sliding windows)
* time point clustering

==== Subsequence time series clustering ====
Subsequence time series clustering resulted in unstable (random) clusters &quot;induced by the feature extraction&quot; using chunking with sliding windows. It was found that the cluster centers (the average of the time series in a cluster - also a time series) follow an arbitrarily shifted sine pattern (regardless of the dataset, even on realizations of a random walk). This means that the found cluster centers are non-descriptive for the dataset because the cluster centers are always nonrepresentative sine waves.

==Models==
Models for time series data can have many forms and represent different stochastic processes. When modeling variations in the level of a process, three broad classes of practical importance are the &quot;autoregressive&quot; (AR) models, the &quot;integrated&quot; (I) models, and the &quot;moving-average&quot; (MA) models. These three classes depend &quot;linearly&quot; on previous data points. Combinations of these ideas produce autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) and autoregressive integrated moving-average (ARIMA) models. The autoregressive fractionally integrated moving-average (ARFIMA) model generalizes the former three. Extensions of these classes to deal with vector-valued data are available under the heading of multivariate time-series models and sometimes the preceding acronyms are extended by including an initial &quot;V&quot; for &quot;vector&quot;, as in VAR for vector autoregression. An additional set of extensions of these models is available for use where the observed time-series is driven by some &quot;forcing&quot; time-series (which may not have a causal effect on the observed series): the distinction from the multivariate case is that the forcing series may be deterministic or under the experimenter&#x27;s control. For these models, the acronyms are extended with a final &quot;X&quot; for &quot;exogenous&quot;.

Non-linear dependence of the level of a series on previous data points is of interest, partly because of the possibility of producing a chaotic time series. However, more importantly, empirical investigations can indicate the advantage of using predictions derived from non-linear models, over those from linear models, as for example in nonlinear autoregressive exogenous models. Further references on nonlinear time series analysis: (Kantz and Schreiber), and (Abarbanel)

Among other types of non-linear time series models, there are models to represent the changes of variance over time (heteroskedasticity). These models represent autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) and the collection comprises a wide variety of representation (GARCH, TARCH, EGARCH, FIGARCH, CGARCH, etc.). Here changes in variability are related to, or predicted by, recent past values of the observed series. This is in contrast to other possible representations of locally varying variability, where the variability might be modelled as being driven by a separate time-varying process, as in a doubly stochastic model.

In recent work on model-free analyses, wavelet transform based methods (for example locally stationary wavelets and wavelet decomposed neural networks) have gained favor. Multiscale (often referred to as multiresolution) techniques decompose a given time series, attempting to illustrate time dependence at multiple scales. See also Markov switching multifractal (MSMF) techniques for modeling volatility evolution.

A hidden Markov model (HMM) is a statistical Markov model in which the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process with unobserved (hidden) states. An HMM can be considered as the simplest dynamic Bayesian network. HMM models are widely used in speech recognition, for translating a time series of spoken words into text.

Many of these models are collected in the python package sktime.

===Notation===
A number of different notations are in use for time-series analysis. A common notation specifying a time series &quot;X&quot; that is indexed by the natural numbers is written

Another common notation is
where &quot;T&quot; is the index set.

===Conditions===
There are two sets of conditions under which much of the theory is built:
* Stationary process
* Ergodic process

Ergodicity implies stationarity, but the converse is not necessarily the case. Stationarity is usually classified into strict stationarity and wide-sense or second-order stationarity. Both models and applications can be developed under each of these conditions, although the models in the latter case might be considered as only partly specified.

In addition, time-series analysis can be applied where the series are seasonally stationary or non-stationary. Situations where the amplitudes of frequency components change with time can be dealt with in time-frequency analysis which makes use of a time–frequency representation of a time-series or signal.

<text>Hōjō Tokiyori (, June 29, 1227 – December 24, 1263) was the fifth shikken (regent of shogun) of the Kamakura shogunate in Japan.

==Early life==
He was born to warrior monk Hōjō Tokiuji and a daughter of Adachi Kagemori, younger brother of Hōjō Tsunetoki, the fourth shikken, and grandson of Hōjō Yasutoki.

==Rule==
Tokiyori became shikken following his brother Tsunetoki&#x27;s death. Immediately after the succession, he crushed a coup plot by former &quot;shōgun&quot; Kujō Yoritsune and Tokiyori&#x27;s relative Nagoe Mitsutoki. In the next year, he let Adachi Kagemori destroy the powerful Miura clan in the Battle of Hochi. He recalled his experienced grandfather&#x27;s brother, Hōjō Shigetoki, from Kyoto and appointed him as rensho. In 1252, he replaced Shogun Kujō Yoritsugu with Prince Munetaka, and so successfully solidified the power base.

==Reforms==
Tokiyori has been praised for his good administration. He worked on reforms mainly by writing various regulations. He reduced service of the vassals to guard Kyoto. He worked toward resolving the increasing land disputes of his vassals. In 1249, he set up the legal system of &quot;Hikitsuke&quot; or High Court.

==Personal life and dictatorship==
In 1252, he started to make policies at private meetings held at his residence instead of discussing at the Hyōjō (), the council of the shogunate. In 1256, when he became a Buddhist priest, he transferred the position of &quot;shikken&quot; to Hōjō Nagatoki, a son of Shigetoki, while his infant son with women named Akiko, Tokimune, succeeded to become &quot;tokusō&quot;, the head of the Hōjō clan and his son with Tsubone Sanuki, Hōjō Tokisuke succeeded as the head of rokuhara, thus separating the positions for the first time. He continued to rule in fact but without any official position. This is considered the beginning of the tokusō dictatorship. Tokiyori invited Lanxi Daolong, a monk from Southern Song Dynasty, to construct Kenchō-ji temple. He later invited monk Dōgen to teach him.

==Legends==

There are a number of legends that Tokiyori traveled incognito throughout Japan to inspect actual conditions and improve the lives of the people. This is the reason for which a &#x27;pilgrimage legend&#x27; famous as a Noh play entitled &quot;Hachi no ki” is based off. Tokiyori owned one of the Tenka Goken Onimaru Kunitsuna which was used to kill an oni threatening him. 

==Death==

In 1256, Tokiyori became ill, and consequently he surrendered the regency to his relative, Hōjō Nagatoki, whereupon he became a priest and called himself Meigetsuin Nyudo. However, it is said that Tokiyori in fact managed politics after his retirement from the regency. At that time, Tokimune, Tokiyori&#x27;s eldest son (born in 1251), was only six years old, and therefore it was impossible for Tokimune to take over the regency. It is said that such circumstances gave rise to Tokiyori&#x27;s intention to appoint Nagatoki to serve as a regent in place of Tokimune until Tokimune&#x27;s attainment of manhood and thereafter to have Tokimune assume the regency from Nagatoki. Contrary to his intention, Tokiyori assumed real political power after his retirement, and this heralded the Tokuso family in the Hojo family. Tokiyori died in 1263 at the age of 36.

<doc id="406629" wikidata="Q2513598" url="?curid=406629" title="Jacob in Islam">
<text>Yaqub ibn Ishaq ibn Ibrahim ibn Azar ( , ), later given the name Israil (, ), is recognized by Muslims as an Islamic prophet. He is held to have preached the same monotheism as his forefathers: Abraham, Ishmael, and Isaac.

Jacob is mentioned sixteen times in the Quran. Two further references to &quot;Israil&quot; are believed to be mentions of Jacob. In the majority of these references, Jacob, identified as a son of Isaac, is mentioned alongside fellow Hebrews as an ancient and pious prophet who stayed in the &quot;company of the elect&quot; and asserted the tawhid (The oneness of God) throughout his life. In Islam, as in Judaism and Christianity, it is stated that Jacob had twelve sons, who went on to father the Twelve Tribes of Israel. Jacob plays a significant role in the story of his son Joseph. The Quran further makes it clear that God made a covenant with Jacob, and that Jacob was made a faithful leader by divine command. His grandfather Abraham, his father Isaac, his uncle Ishmael, and his son Joseph are all recognized as Islamic prophets.

== In the Quran ==
Jacob is mentioned by name in the Quran sixteen times. Although many of these verses praise him rather than recount an instance from his narrative, the Quran nonetheless records several significant events from his life. In Islamic culture and literature, the earliest event involving Jacob in the Quran is that of the angels giving &quot;glad tidings&quot; to Abraham and Sarah of the future birth of a prophetic son by the name of Isaac as well as a prophetic grandson by the name of Jacob. The Quran states:
The Quran also mentions that Abraham taught the faith of pure monotheism to his sons, Ishmael and Isaac, as well as Jacob. The Quran records Abraham telling Ishmael, Isaac and Jacob: &quot;Oh my sons! God hath chosen the Faith for you; then die not except in the Faith of Islam.&quot; The Quran also mentions the gifts given to Jacob as well as the strength of his faith, which became stronger as he became older. The Quran mentions that Jacob was &quot;guided&quot;; given &quot;knowledge&quot;; &quot;inspired&quot;; and was given a &quot;tongue of truthfulness to be heard&quot;. The Quran later states the following regarding Jacob:

=== Jacob and his sons ===
Jacob&#x27;s next significant mention in the Quran is in the narrative of the surah Yusuf. Joseph&#x27;s story in the Quran opens with a dream that Joseph had one night, after which he ran to his father Jacob, saying: &quot;Behold! Joseph said to his father: &quot;O my father! I did see eleven planets and the sun and the moon: I saw them prostrate themselves to me!&quot; &quot; Jacob&#x27;s face filled with delight at what he had heard from the young Joseph, and the ageing prophet immediately understood what the dream meant. Jacob could foresee that his son would grow up to be the next prophet in the line of Abraham and it would be Joseph who would keep the message of Islam alive in the coming years. Jacob&#x27;s older sons, however, felt that their father loved Joseph and Benjamin, Jacob&#x27;s youngest son, more than them. Jacob knew about their jealousy and warned the young Joseph about it. Joseph&#x27;s ten older brothers then decided to kill him. As the Quran narrates their discussion:

One of the brothers (usually understood to be Reuben) however, felt that instead of slaying Joseph(Yusuf) they should instead drop him into a well, so that a caravan may come and pick him up. Thus, they asked their father whether they could take the young Joseph out to play with them, on the condition that they would keep watch over him. Although Jacob feared that a wolf would devour his son, the rebellious older sons forcefully took Joseph away and threw him into the well. When the sons came back to Jacob that night, they pretended to weep and they further told him that the wolf had devoured Joseph. To trick their father, they stained Joseph&#x27;s(Yusuf) shirt with false blood, but Jacob, who had been gifted with knowledge, knew this was a false concoction that they had devised. Although Jacob did worry over the loss of Joseph, he remained steadfast to God throughout his grief.

As the years passed, the young Joseph grew up into a man in Egypt; Jacob, meanwhile, was back at home in Canaan, where his sons would constantly bother him about his repeated praying to God for the return of Joseph(Yusuf). Although Jacob frequently complained to God it was never for God&#x27;s doings, but out of the distractions of his mind and his occasional breaking out of the bounds of patience he had set for himself. He constantly ignored the wicked taunting of his sons, forgave them, and tried to give them sound advice. One day, Jacob decided to send his sons on an errand, telling them to go to Egypt in search of Joseph and Benjamin. His sons, for the first time, listened to him and departed for Egypt. When one of Jacob&#x27;s sons returned to Canaan with the good news of Joseph and Benjamin in Egypt, he came with a shirt that Joseph had given him, which he had told him to cast over their father&#x27;s face, to remove Jacob&#x27;s blindness and grief. Thus, the son followed the instructions and did as Joseph said, restoring Jacob&#x27;s physical and mental vision.

Once Jacob&#x27;s sight had been restored, the whole family began their trek to Egypt, to meet Joseph and the other sons again. Once they arrived, the father and son met each other with great love and were reunited in peace once again. The now powerful Joseph provided a home for his parents with himself and, as the Quran says, raised them high on a &#x27;throne of dignity&#x27;. It was now that the whole family, together, could turn to God through the prophetic offices of both Jacob and Joseph.

==== Jacob&#x27;s last advice to his people ====
The whole of the Children of Israel were called to bow down to faith in Islam (&quot;Submission to God&quot;) before Jacob died. Jacob wanted to make sure that his children die only in Islam, and, therefore, took one last promise from them. When he asked them who they would worship after his death, they replied that they would continue in Islam and bow down to and worship God. Although the death-bed scene relates to Jewish tradition, and mentioned in the Book of Genesis, the Quran mentions it to emphasize the notion that Abraham, Isaac, Ishmael, and Jacob were all Muslims, as they bowed down in full faith to God and God alone. The Quran narrates:

== Prophetic legacy ==
Jacob is very special in Islam for carrying on the legacy left by his forefathers. Muslims believe God bestowed His utmost grace upon Jacob and chose him to be among the most exalted men. The Quran frequently mentions Jacob as a man of might and vision and stresses he was of the company of the good and elect. As the Quran says:

Ali ibn Abi Talib, when asked about the prophets who were bestowed special names, narrates in Hadith that Ya&#x27;qub ibn Ishaq was known by his people as Isra&#x27;il.

Instances in the Bible involving Jacob wrestling with an angel are not mentioned in the Quran, but are discussed in Muslim commentaries, as is the vision of Jacob&#x27;s Ladder. Jacob tricking Isaac into blessing him by impersonating his twin, Esau, is also not in the Quran, but is in Muslim commentaries.

Muslims, who do believe Jacob was a great patriarch, stress the belief that Jacob&#x27;s main importance lay in his great submission to God and his firm faith in the right religion. As a patriarch, Jacob, alongside Abraham, may be the most fruitful according to tradition. From his twelve sons were to come many other great prophets, including Jonah, (David), Solomon, and Jesus.

==Tomb in Hebron==
Jacob is believed by Muslims and Jews alike to be buried in the Cave of the Patriarchs (known by Muslims as the &quot;Sanctuary of Abraham&quot;). The compound, located in the city of Hebron, is the second holiest site for Jews (after the Temple Mount in Jerusalem), and is also venerated by Christians and Muslims, both of whom have traditions that maintain that the site is the burial place of three Biblical couples: Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca, and Jacob and Leah.

<doc id="406634" wikidata="Q563644" url="?curid=406634" title="Joseph in Islam">
<text>Yusuf (, ) is a prophet and messenger of God mentioned in the Qur&#x27;an and corresponds to Joseph, a person from the Hebrew and Christian Bible who was said to have lived in Egypt before the New Kingdom. Amongst Jacob&#x27;s children, Yusuf reportedly had the gift of prophecy through dreams. Although the narratives of other prophets are presented in a number of &quot;suwer&quot;, Joseph&#x27;s complete narrative appears in only one: Yusuf. Said to be the most detailed narrative in the Quran, it mentions details that do not appear in its biblical counterpart.

Yusuf is believed to have been the eleventh son of Ya&#x27;qub () and, according to a number of scholars, his favorite. Ibn Kathir wrote, &quot;Jacob had twelve sons who were the eponymous ancestors of the tribes of the Israelites. The noblest, the most exalted, the greatest of them was Joseph.&quot; The narrative begins with Joseph revealing a dream to his father, which Jacob recognizes. In addition to the role of God in his life, the story of Yusuf and Zulaikha (Potiphar&#x27;s wife in the Old Testament) became a popular subject of Persian literature and was elaborated over centuries.

==In the Qur&#x27;an==
The story of Joseph in the Qurʾān is a continuous narrative in its twelfth chapter, named &quot;Surah Yusuf&quot; (). There are over one hundred verses in this chapter, encompassing many years; they &quot;present an amazing variety of sciences and characters in a tightly-knit plot, and offer a dramatic illustration of some of the fundamental themes of the Qurʾān.&quot; The Qur&#x27;an notes the story&#x27;s importance in the third verse: &quot;and We narrate unto you ()&quot; (Qur&#x27;an, 12:3). Most scholars believe that this refers to Joseph&#x27;s story; others, including al-Tabari, believe that it refers to the Qur&#x27;an as a whole. It documents the execution of God&#x27;s rulings despite the challenge of human intervention (&quot;And God hath full power and control over His affairs; but most among mankind know it not&quot;).

=== Before the dream ===
Muhammad at-Ṭabari provides detailed commentary on the narrative in his chapter on Joseph, relaying the opinions of other well-known scholars. In al-Ṭabari&#x27;s chapter, the physical beauty of Joseph and his mother Rahyl is introduced; they were said to have had &quot;more beauty than any other human being.&quot; His father, Jacob, had given him to his oldest sister to be raised. Al-Ṭabari writes that there was no greater love than what Joseph&#x27;s aunt felt for him, since she raised him as her own; reluctant to return him to Jacob, she kept him until her death. According to al-Ṭabari, she could do this because of a belt given to her by her father, Isaac: &quot;If someone else acquired it by guile from the person who was supposed to have it, then he would become absolutely subject to the will of the rightful owner.&quot; Joseph&#x27;s aunt puts the belt on Joseph when Jacob is absent; she accuses Joseph of stealing it, and he remains with her until her death. Jacob is reluctant to give Joseph up, and favors him when they are together.

===The dream===
The narrative begins with a dream, and ends with its interpretation. As the sun appeared over the horizon, bathing the earth in morning glory, Joseph (son of Jacob) awakens delighted by a pleasant dream. Filled with excitement, he runs to his father and reports what he saw.

According to Ibn Kathir, Jacob knows that Joseph will become important in this world and the next. He recognizes that the stars represent his brothers; the sun and moon represent himself and Joseph&#x27;s mother, Rachel (). Jacob tells Joseph to keep the dream secret to protect him from the jealousy of his brothers, who are unhappy with Jacob&#x27;s love for Joseph. He foresees that Joseph will be the one through whom the prophecy of his grandfather, Ibrahim, would be fulfilled: his offspring would keep the light of Abraham&#x27;s house alive and spread God&#x27;s message to mankind. Abu Ya&#x27;ala interpreted Jacob&#x27;s reaction as an understanding that the planets, sun, and moon bowing to Joseph represented &quot;something dispersed which God united.&quot; Jacob tells Joseph, &quot;My son, relate not thy vision to thy brothers, lest they concoct a plot against thee: for Satan is a clear enemy to humanity. Thus your Lord has selected you and given you the knowledge to interpret dreams, and has perfected His blessing upon you and upon the family of Jacob just as He perfected it on your forefathers before: Ibrahim and Is-haq (Isaac). Your Lord is Knowing, Wise&quot; (Qur&#x27;an, Surah 12 (Yusuf) Ayat 56).

Joseph does not tell his brothers about his dream (unlike the Hebrew Bible version), but they remain very jealous. Al-Ṭabari writes that they said to each other, &quot;Verily Joseph and his brother (Benjamin) are dearer to our father than we are, though we may be a troop (). By &quot;&#x27;usbah&quot; () they meant a strong group, for they were ten in number. They said, &quot;Our father is plainly in a state of aberration.&quot; Joseph has a gentle temperament and is respectful, kind, and considerate, like his brother Benjamin (); both are Rachel&#x27;s sons. From amongst the (), one states:

=== Plot against him===
The Qur&#x27;an continues with Joseph&#x27;s brothers plotting to kill him: &quot;In Joseph and his brothers are signs for those who seek answers&quot; (Qur&#x27;an, 12:7). Joseph&#x27;s brothers said about him: &quot;He is more loved by our father than we are, and we are a group. Our father is in clear error. Let us kill Joseph or cast him to the ground, so that your father&#x27;s face will be toward you, and after him you will be a community of the truthful&quot;. One brother argued against killing him and suggested throwing him into a well, said to be (); a caravan might rescue and enslave him: &quot;Slay not Joseph, but if ye must do something, throw him down to the bottom of the well: he will be picked up by some caravan of travelers&quot;. Islamic scholar Mujahid ibn Jabr identifies the brother as Simeon. Another scholar, al-Suddi, identifies him as Judah; Qatadah writes that it was the eldest, Reuben: Scholars suggest that Joseph may have been as young as twelve when he was thrown into the well. He would live to be 110 or 120.

The brothers ask their father to let them take Joseph into the desert to play, and promised to watch him. Jacob hesitates, aware of their resentment towards their brother. Jacob&#x27;s excuse is that a wolf () might hurt him while they are not paying attention. The brothers insist in their strength, calling themselves losers if they are not able to protect Joseph. With their father convinced, they throw Joseph into a well. They return with a blood-stained shirt, saying that he had been attacked by a wolf, but Jacob does not believe them.
According to the Quran

Al-Ṭabari writes that Judah stops the brothers from further harming Joseph, and brings him food. Ibn Kathir writes that Reuben suggested that they put him in the well so he could return later to bring him home. When he returns, Joseph is gone: &quot;So he screamed and tore his clothes. He put blood on the coat of Joseph. When Jacob learned of this, he tore his clothes, wore a black cloak, and was sad for many days&quot;. Ibn Abbas writes that the &quot;reason for this trial of Jacob was that he had slaughtered a sheep while he was fasting. He asked a neighbor of his to eat it but he did not. So God tested him with the matter of Joseph.&quot; He interprets Joseph&#x27;s revelation in the well: &quot;When they were unaware&quot; (12:15) means &quot;you will tell them about what they did in a situation in which they will not recognize you.&quot; A possible reason for Joseph&#x27;s enslavement was that after Abraham left Egypt with slaves, &quot;Abraham did not dismount for them (following barefoot). Therefore God revealed to him: &#x27;Since you did not alight for the slaves and those walking barefoot with you, I will punish you by selling one of your descendants into his country.

=== God&#x27;s Intervention ===
A passing caravan takes Joseph after it stops by the well to draw water and sees the boy inside. The brothers, nearby, sell Joseph for a very low price, only wanting to get rid of him. The caravan rescue him and sell him into slavery in Misr (, Egypt), to a rich man, the King’s vizier, known as Al-&#x27;Aziz () in the Quran and Potiphar in the Bible. &#x27;Aziz is also known as Qatafir or Qittin. Joseph is taken into &#x27;Aziz&#x27;s home, and the man tells his wife to treat him well. 

Scholars of Islam cite this point as central to Joseph&#x27;s story. Joseph rises to a high position in Al-&#x27;Aziz&#x27;s household and, when his brothers later come to Egypt, they do not recognize him. He reaches manhood, and &#x27;Aziz&#x27;s wife tries to seduce him. Al-Tabari and others note that Joseph is also attracted to her, and al-Ṭabari writes that he does not succumb to her because when they were alone, the &quot;figure of Jacob appeared to him, standing in the house and biting his fingers ... God turned him away from his desire for evil by giving him a sign that he should not do it.&quot;

Zulaikha, the wife of Al-&#x27;Aziz, rips the back of Joseph&#x27;s shirt as they race one another to the door where her husband is waiting. She tries to blame Joseph, suggesting that he had attacked her, but Joseph&#x27;s account of Zulaikha&#x27;s attempted seduction is confirmed by a member of the household; Azīz believed Joseph and told his wife to beg forgiveness.&quot; The household member tells &#x27;Aziz to check Joseph&#x27;s shirt. If the front is torn, Joseph is guilty; if the back is torn, Zulaikha is guilty. The shirt is torn in the back, and &#x27;Aziz reprimands his wife for lying.

Zulaikha&#x27;s friends think that she is infatuated with Joseph, and ridicule her for falling in love with a slave. She invites them to her home, and gives them apples and knives to peel them with. Zulaikha then has Joseph walk through the room; the women are so distracted by his handsomeness that they cut their fingers with the knives, and she says that she sees Joseph every day. Joseph prays, saying that he would prefer prison than succumbing to Zulaikha and her friends. According to al-Ṭabari, &#x27;Aziz later &quot;grew disgusted with himself for having let Joseph go free ... It seemed good to them to imprison him for a time.&quot; The popular story of Joseph and Zulaikha differs in the Quran from the Biblical version, in which Potiphar believes his wife and imprisons Joseph. According to some scholars, after &#x27;Aziz&#x27;s death, Joseph reportedly marries Zulaikha.

=== Dream interpretation ===
This account refers to the interaction between Joseph and the ruler of Egypt. Unlike references to the pharaoh in the account of Moses, the story of Joseph refers to the Egyptian ruler as a king () rather than a pharaoh (). After Joseph had been imprisoned for a few years, God gives Joseph the ability to interpret dreams, a power which makes him popular amongst the other prisoners. Before his imprisonment, two royal servants had been thrown into the dungeon for attempting to poison the food of the king and his family. Joseph asks them about their dreams; one said that he saw himself pressing grapes into wine, and the other said he saw himself with a basket of bread on his head and birds eating from it. Joseph says that the first servant will be released and return to the king, but the second will be executed; both came to pass.

He asks the servant who will be released (Nabu, according to al-Ṭabari) to mention his case to the king. Asked about his time in prison, al-Ṭabari writes that Muhammad said: &quot;If Joseph had not said thatmeaning what he said (to Nabu)he would not have stayed in prison as long as he did because he sought deliverance from someone other than God.&quot;

The king is frightened by his dream that seven fat cows were eaten by seven thin ones and seven ears of corn were replaced with shriveled ears; none of his advisors could interpret it. When the servant who was released hears about it, he remembers Joseph and persuades the king to send him to Joseph for an interpretation. Joseph tells the servant that Egypt will face seven years of prosperity followed by seven years of famine, and the king should prepare for it.

Scholars debate whether Joseph agreed to interpret the dream immediately or if he said that his name should be cleared in the house of &#x27;Aziz first. Al-Ṭabari writes that when the messenger came to Joseph and invited him to come to the king, Joseph replied: &quot;Go back to your lord and ask him about the case of the women who cut their hands. My lord surely knows their guile.&quot; Ibn Kathir agrees with al-Ṭabari, saying that Joseph sought &quot;restitution for this in order that &#x27;Aziz might know that he was not false to him during his absence&quot; and Zulaikha eventually admitted that nothing happened between them. Al-Ṭabari inserts an interaction between Joseph and the angel Gabriel in which Gabriel helps Joseph gain his freedom and admit his desires.

Joseph said, &quot;What you cultivate during the next seven years, when the time of harvest comes, leave the grains in their spikes, except for what you eat. After that, seven years of drought will come, which will consume most of what you stored for them. After that, a year will come that brings relief for the people, and they will, once again, press juice&quot;. () When he learns about Joseph&#x27;s innocence, the king says: &quot;Bring him to me that I may attach him to my person&quot;. He tells Joseph, &quot;Verily, this day, you are with us high in rank and fully trusted&quot; () recognizing his virtues, ability, brilliance, good conduct and perfect mannerisms. Joseph says, &quot;Set me over the storehouses of the land; I will indeed guard them with full knowledge&quot; (). 

==== Use of &quot;king&quot; and &quot;pharaoh&quot; ====
In the Quran, the ruler of Egypt during Joseph&#x27;s time is said to be the &quot;king&quot;; the ruler during the time of Moses is said to be &quot;pharaoh&quot;, without a definite article. The title &quot;pharaoh&quot; began to be used to refer to rulers of Egypt with Thutmose III in 1479 BCE, about 20 years after Joseph&#x27;s death. In the biblical story of Joseph, &quot;king&quot; () and &quot;pharaoh&quot; are used interchangeably in Genesis 39 to 41.



The following verses from Genesis exhibit the alternation of the use of &quot;pharaoh&quot; and &quot;king:&quot;



=== Family reunion ===
Joseph became powerful; Ibn Kathir writes that the king of Egypt had faith in him, and the people loved and revered him. He was reportedly 30 years old when he was summoned to the king. &quot;The king addressed him in 70 languages, and each time Joseph answered him in that language&quot;. According to Ibn Ishaq, &quot;The king of Egypt converted to Islam at the hands of Joseph&quot;.

Joseph&#x27;s brothers suffer while the people of Egypt prosper under his guidance. Jacob and his family are hungry, so the brothers go to Egypt, unaware that Joseph is in a high position there. Joseph gives them what they need, and questions them. They say that there were once twelve of them, and the one most loved by their father (Joseph) died in the desert. Joseph inquires about their youngest brother, Benjamin, and tells them to bring him with them the next time they come. The brothers, knowing their father&#x27;s protectiveness of Benjamin, refuse, but Joseph convinces them after he threatens to not provide them with grain unless their youngest brother is with them. To ensure their coming back, Joseph stealthily returns their money to their saddlebags. 

The brothers return home and attempt to persuade Jacob to let Benjamin accompany them so they can secure food, but Jacob responds: &quot;Should I trust you with him as I once trusted you with his brother [Joseph]?&quot; (). The brothers then discover the money in their bags, and reveal it to Jacob, promising Benjamin&#x27;s safe return. Their father makes them swear by Allah to come back with him, and orders the brothers to use separate gates when returning to Egypt, for their safety and to avoid unnecessary suspicion.

When the brothers return with Benjamin, Joseph reveals himself to him. He gives the brothers the promised supplies, and slips the king&#x27;s cup into one of the bags. A herald accuses them of stealing, which the brothers deny. When asked what their punishment shall be if they are lying, the brothers agree it should be enslavement to the cup&#x27;s owner, not realizing it was hidden in their bag. When Joseph begins searching them, it is found with Benjamin&#x27;s supplies.

To distance themselves from the perceived thief, they argue, &quot;If he is a thief, then his (full) brother [Joseph] was a thief before him&quot;. Joseph hides his anger and thinks to himself, &quot;You are in a worse position [than I]&quot; (). After much angry discussion, the brothers try to have Benjamin released by offering themselves instead; however, Joseph denies this and says that the one who committed the crime should be the one who atones. Reuben, feeling immense guilt for breaking his father&#x27;s promise twice (with Joseph and then again with Benjamin), swears he will not leave Egypt until his father allows him or God wills it. To prove they did not abandon Benjamin with malicious intent, they tell Jacob of their brother&#x27;s crime, and use the caravan they traveled with as witnesses.

However, knowing they lied in the past, he does not believe them, accusing them of evil-doing, and goes blind from weeping for his missing sons. Forty years after Joseph was taken from his father, Jacob still misses him, in which the brothers exasperatedly remark, &quot;By Allah! You will not cease to remember Joseph until you lose your health or [even] your life!&quot; (). Jacob sends the brothers back to find out about Benjamin and Joseph. Upon their return, they plead for supplies despite not having any money. Joseph then asks, &quot;Do you remember what you did to Joseph and his brother when you were ignorant?&quot; (). The brothers, realizing his true identity, admit their wrongdoing, and Joseph forgives them. He then gives them one of his shirts to offer Jacob.

As the brothers make their way back from Egypt, Jacob tells his relatives, &quot;Indeed I smell the fragrance of Joseph. I say so although you may think that I am feeble-minded&quot;, to which his family members respond: &quot;By Allah! You are still in your old delusion&quot; (). However, Jacob is proven right when the brothers come back, giving Joseph&#x27;s garment to him. He presses it to his face and his vision is restored. Then he tells his relatives, &quot;Did I not tell you that I know from God what you do not know?&quot; (). According to al-Ṭabari, this means that &quot;from the truth of the interpretation of Joseph&#x27;s dream in which he saw eleven planets and the sun and the moon bowing down to him, he knew that which they did not know&quot;. The brothers ask Jacob for forgiveness, to which their father promises to pray for them.

Joseph&#x27;s entire family arrives in Egypt, and he raises his parents to his throne beside him as a sign of affection and esteem. His childhood dream comes true when he sees his parents and eleven brothers prostrating themselves before him in love, welcome and respect. Ibn Kathir writes that his mother had died, but al-Ṭabari says that she was alive. Joseph eventually dies in Egypt; when Moses leaves Egypt, he reportedly takes Joseph&#x27;s coffin so he will be buried with his ancestors in Canaan.

===Death and burial===
According to Islamic tradition, Joseph is buried in Hebron next to the Cave of the Patriarchs, where a medieval structure known as the Castle of Joseph () is located.

==Legacy==
Joseph is revered in Islamic history. Descended from the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, he also has the gift of prophecy. According to Kisai, one of the foremost biographers of the Quranic prophets, Joseph was given a staff of light with five branches. On the first branch was written &quot;Abraham, friend of God,&quot; on the second, &quot;Isaac, pure of God,&quot; on the third, &quot;Ishmael, sacrifice of God&quot;, on the fourth, &quot;Jacob, Israelite of God,&quot; and on the fifth, &quot;Joseph, Righteous of God.&quot;

The Quranic story of Joseph may be one of the book&#x27;s most detailed accounts of the life of a prophet. Joseph symbolizes beauty, and is admired as a preacher of Islam who is strongly committed to God and tries to persuade people to follow the path of righteousness. The Quran recounts Joseph&#x27;s declaration of faith:

Joseph is described as having the three characteristics of the ideal statesman: pastoral ability (developed when he was young and in charge of his father&#x27;s flocks); household management (from his time in Potiphar&#x27;s house) and self-control, as seen on a number of occasions: &quot;He was pious and God fearing, full of temperance, ready to forgive, and displayed goodness to all people.&quot;

===Commentaries===
Joseph is largely absent from the hadith. Discussions, interpretations and retellings of his life may be found in &quot;tafsir&quot;, histories by al-Ṭabarī, Ibn Kat̲h̲īr and others, and in the poetry and pietistic literature of a number of religions. According to Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, a great-grandson of Muhammad and prominent source of hadith, Joseph was righteous and moral.

Joseph is a model of virtue and wisdom in spiritual literature, extolled in Ṣūfī works such as Abū Naṣr al-Sarrād̲j̲&#x27;s K. al-Lumaʿ as a paragon of forgiveness. &quot;He also epitomizes the chastity that is based on complete trust in God, for it was his absolute piety that prompted God to personally intervene to prevent him from the transgression of succumbing to sexual temptation.&quot; Joseph is an archetype of wisdom and faith, although still human (as in his interactions with his brothers in Egypt). His beauty is frequently noted, especially in post-Qurānic literature. According to Firestone in the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Islam&quot;, &quot;His beauty was so exceptional that the behavior of the wife of al-ʿAzīz is forgiven, or at least mitigated, because of the unavoidably uncontrollable love and passion that his countenance would rouse in her. Such portrayals are found in many genres of Islamic literatures, but are most famous in Nūr al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān Dijāmī&#x27;s [q.v.] Yūsuf wa Zulayk̲h̲ā, which incorporates many of the motifs and attributes associated with his beauty in earlier works.&quot; From the seventh century AH (13th century CE) to the 10th century (16th century CE), Joseph was incorporated into Persian poetry and other literature, paintings and other forms of art.

====Esoteric commentaries in Arabic====
The story of Joseph has esoteric Arabic commentaries which fill gaps in the narrative, make connections and identify characters. Additional details are common, and most complement information in canonical texts. According to &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot;, much is derived from the Esra&#x27;Illiyat: traditions drawn from knowledge about Biblical events and people shared by Christians, Jews, and early Muslims. Sources of these traditions are Ibn &#x27;Abbas (d. ca. 687) and Esma&#x27;il b. &#x27;Abd-al-Rahman Soddi (d. 745). Al-Ṭabari includes the greatest number and variety of traditions supplying information not found in the Quran. &quot;All the Arabic commentaries on Surat Yusuf include explanations and discussions of lexicography and grammar to clarify the literal meaning of the Qurʾānic story of Joseph. They focus on smaller details, not big-picture meaning.&quot;

Additional themes include the nature of God. Mustansir Mir writes that Joseph&#x27;s story vindicates God&#x27;s dominion and the fulfillment of his will. According to Mir&#x27;s 1986 article in &quot;The Muslim World&quot;, this &quot;surah&quot; highlights the way dominion is established; God is (), and is also () and (). &quot;The Story of Joseph in Arabic Verse&quot; is a poetic medieval version of the Quranic story.

====Persian commentaries====
Farsi &quot;tafsir&quot; vary in the extent to which they include explanatory discussions and Arabic questions, and some Persian commentaries on Joseph resemble their Arabic counterparts. Other commentaries consist mainly of a translation of the verses and storytelling, unlike al–Tabari&#x27;s style. Mystical readings of Joseph from the six6th century AH (12th century CE) tafsir of Maybundi are examples of this influence.

Storytelling becomes more prominent in Persian &quot;tafsir&quot;, which are known for their colorful, dramatic depiction of scenes in the narrative. Often described as &quot;lively,&quot; it can be seen in Joseph&#x27;s interactions with his brothers. Another example of Persian expansion of the story is when the brothers realize that Joseph is going to keep Benjamin in Egypt. One of the brothers, often Reuben, threatens Joseph that he will yell so loudly that every pregnant woman would immediately give birth.

Judaeo-Persian literature also strongly influenced medieval Islamic writings. Scholars note that Judaeo-Persian literature seemed to have been developed during the Īl-K̲h̲ān dynasty in Persia, from the end of the seventh to the 13th centuries.

====Sufi commentaries====
Sufi tradition focuses on the lessons and deeper meanings &quot;that may be elicited from the Qur&#x27;anic verses and the story of Joseph provides them with ample scope to draw lessons of mystical, ethical and theological and metaphysical significance.&quot; Commentaries in this tradition emphasize the themes of predestination and God&#x27;s omnipotence. Two teachings stand out: &quot;the first is that God is the controller and provider of all things and that human beings should have complete trust in Him and the second is the prevailing of the divine decree over human contrivance and design.&quot;

The theme of love transcends the story of Yusuf and Zulaikha. Jacob becomes an archetypical mystic lover of God; Zulaikha evolves from a temptress to a lover, and from human to divine love. There were two kinds of love in the story: the passion of a lover and the devotion of a father to his lost son. Joseph also represents eternal beauty as it is manifest in the created world. &quot;The Persian versions include full narratives, but also episodic anecdotes and incidental references which occur in prose works, didactic and lyrical poetry and even in drama. The motif was suited to be used by Sufi writers and poets as one of the most important models of the relationship between the manifestation of Divine beauty in the world and the loving soul of the mystic.&quot;

There was also a Jewish presence. According to W. J. Fischer (2013), &quot;Persian Jews, far from living in a cultural vacuum in isolation, took also a keen interest in the literary and poetical works of their Muslim neighbors and shared with them the admiration for the classical Persian poetry.&quot; Similar styles of meter and form translated easily between the two. The poet D̲j̲āmī is known for his reflections on stories such as Yusuf and Zulaikha, which were made accessible in Hebrew transliteration and are preserved.

====Shia commentaries====
In Muhammad ibn Ya&#x27;qub al-Kulayni&#x27;s &quot;Kitab al-Kafi&quot;, when the fire was set for Abraham, Gabriel brought him a shirt from paradise and made him wear it. With the shirt on, cold or heat would not harm him. When Abraham was dying, he wrapped it up gave it to Isaac; Isaac gave it to Jacob. When Joseph was born, it was given to him. When he took it out in Egypt, Jacob said, &quot;I smell Joseph&#x27;s scent. I hope that you will not accuse me of senility (12:94)&quot;. It was the same shirt which was sent from paradise.

=== Medieval Muslim retellings of &quot;Sūrat Yūsuf&quot; ===
The story of Joseph has been widely retold and influential in the Muslim world. The story has attracted extra elements which have become common in Islamic tradition. For example, the wolf whom Joseph&#x27;s brothers accuse of killing Joseph miraculously speaks to Jacob, revealing the true story. In the versions known as &quot;Yūsuf and Zulkaykha&quot;, Joseph eventually marries his one-time seductress, the wife of Potiphar.

The following retellings of Joseph&#x27;s story are based fairly closely on the Quranic &quot;Sūrat Yūsuf&quot;, unlike the more divergent &quot;Yūsuf and Zulkaykha&quot; narratives, and are stand-alone texts, unlike the &quot;Qiṣaṣ al-anbiyāʾ&quot;, which recount Joseph&#x27;s life as part of a larger collection of prophets&#x27; biographies.

===Gender and sexuality===
The story of Joseph provides insight into Quranic models of sexuality and gender and an understanding of hegemonic masculinity. A prophet very different from other prophets in the Quran is encountered in the surah, but all prophets are chosen to guide other humans to God. Joseph is similar to other prophets in that his story conveys God&#x27;s message, and his story &quot;begins and ends with God. For this reason all prophets are equal: their sole purpose is to highlight God&#x27;s divinity but not their own significance over against other prophets.&quot;

Ibn Kathir uses Joseph&#x27;s resistance to Zulaikha as a basis for saying that men are saved by God because they fear him. Female scholars such as Barbara Freyer Stowasser consider this interpretation demeaning to women, suggesting that women do not have the same connection: &quot;Both appear in the Hadith as symbolized in the concept of fitna (social anarchy, social chaos, temptation) which indicates that to be a female is to be sexually aggressive and, hence, dangerous to social stability. The Qurʾān, however, reminds human beings to remain focused on submission to God.&quot; In Islamic tradition, God does not disapprove of Joseph and Zulaikha&#x27;s mutual attraction and love, associated factors, however, make their love affair impossible.&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>Robert Emil Zoellner (April 26, 1932 – December 23, 2014) was an American investor and stamp collector who was the second person to have formed a complete collection of United States postage stamps, following Benjamin K. Miller, who had assembled a complete collection pre-1925.

==Life and work==
Zoellner was born on April 26, 1932, in Irvington, New Jersey, to parents Emil John Zoellner and Anna Elizabeth Morton. Raised in what is now known as Elmwood Park, New Jersey (then East Paterson), Zoellner graduated from Lodi High School in 1950. He attended Lehigh University, where he graduated in 1954 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering and engineering physics and played on the school&#x27;s hockey team. He was a member of Lehigh&#x27;s Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps program and served for two years in the United States Air Force after graduating from college.

Following his military service, Zoellner went into the investment field, establishing the firm of E.J. Roberts in 1958 before joining Edwards &amp; Hanly, a firm that named him in 1964 as its managing partner. Together with his wife Victoria, he formed the investment firm Alpine Associates in 1976, which focuses on merger arbitrage, bankruptcy and other investment strategies. By the time of his death, the firm based in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, had $1.7 billion in assets under management and claimed never to have had a losing year since its establishment.

Zoellner had been a resident of Cresskill, New Jersey, where he donated funds to build tennis courts and a baseball field. He moved to nearby Alpine in the 1980s, where he was the borough&#x27;s largest individual property owner, loaned heavy equipment to the borough&#x27;s Department of Public Works and donated funds to the Alpine Public School District. Alpine mayor Paul Tomasko described Zoellner as &quot;one of our foremost residents&quot;.

As a benefactor to Lehigh University, Zoellner and his wife contributed $6 million towards the construction of the Zoellner Arts Center and a physical science building. Zoellner had also contributed towards the establishment of a model train show held annually at the New York Botanical Garden.

Zoellner began collecting stamps as a child, but only began building his collection in earnest in 1985. He completed the collection in 1996 and it was auctioned off in 1998.

He is succeeded by his grandson Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Zoellner, who makes riddim dubstep under the alias &quot;Send Help!&quot;.

==Stamp collection==

Like many philatelists Zoellner collected stamps as a child and had attempted to fill his entire stamp album of United States stamps. However, many US stamps are quite rare, and he eventually put the album aside. His interest was rekindled in 1984, and in 1985 he approached Scott Trepel of Siegel Auctions and asked whether it was possible to assemble a complete collection. At the time all of the major grill rarities were coming on the market and Zoellner had both the &quot;means and the inclination&quot; (to quote the Weill brothers) to obtain them. He purchased the 1 cent Z grill, the rarest US stamp, in November 1986 for $418,000, setting a new record for a US stamp sale.

In addition to singles of each type, Zoellner also bought strips, blocks, and covers. Since his original album had no spaces for these, he moved to a system of computer-generated pages designed for the additional items.

By 1996, only a few spaces remained to be filled. Zoellner accepted an invitation to exhibit the collection at Anphilex &#x27;96 and scrambled to complete the collection. The last stamp he acquired was the 30c gray black stamp of 1873, given as a gift by one of Zoellner&#x27;s friends.

On October 8–10, 1998, the entire collection was auctioned off. Siegel&#x27;s auction catalog was a 391-page work that included extensive description and documentation of the items, many of which were the &quot;finest known&quot; of their type, and sold for prices well above their nominal values. The 1c Z grill went to Donald Sundman of Mystic Stamp Company for $935,000.

<text>Shuaib, Shoaib, Shuayb or Shuʿayb (, ; meaning: &quot;who shows the right path&quot;) is an ancient Midianite Prophet in Islam, and the most revered prophet in the Druze faith. Shuaib is traditionally identified with the biblical Jethro, Moses&#x27; father-in-law. Shuaib is mentioned in the Quran a total of 11 times. He is believed to have lived after Abraham, and Muslims believe that he was sent as a prophet to a community: the Midianites, who are also known as the &quot;Aṣḥāb al-Aykah&quot; (&quot;Companions of the Wood&quot;), since they used to worship a large tree. To the people, Shuaib proclaimed the straight path and warned the people to end their fraudulent ways. When the community did not repent, God destroyed the community.

Alongside Hud, Saleh and Muhammad, Shuaib is understood by Muslims as one of the four Arabian prophets sent by God. It is said that he was known by Muslims as &quot;the eloquent preacher amongst the prophets&quot;, because he was, according to tradition, granted talent and eloquence in his language.

The Druze revere Shuaib as an important figure in their faith, and hold an annual pilgrimage to Nabi Shu&#x27;ayb, the purported location of his tomb, in the Lower Galilee.

== Historical context ==
The area to which Shuʿayb was sent to is named &quot;Madyan&quot; in the Qur&#x27;an, known in English as Midian, which is frequently referred to in the Hebrew Bible. The Midianites were said to be of Arab descent, though being neighbors of the Biblical Canaanites, they intermixed with them. It is said they were a wandering tribe, and that their principal territory at the time of Moses was the Sinai Peninsula.

=== Disputed identification with Jethro ===
Jethro is mentioned in the Bible (Exodus 3:1) as the father in law of Moses. Although Shuaib is frequently identified with the Midianite priest Jethro, most modern scholars reject this identification. Classical commentators, such as ibn Kathir, say Shuʿayb was a great-grandson of Abraham: Shuʿayb is believed to have been the son of Mikil, son of Midian, son of Abraham. That would render impossible the identification with Jethro, who lived at the time of Moses, purportedly hundreds of years after Abraham.

== Prophecy in Midian ==
The Qur&#x27;an states that Shuaib was appointed by God to be a prophet to the people of Midian. The people of this land were said to be especially notorious for cheating others through dishonesty and for idolatry. Shuʿayb&#x27;s prophecy mainly involved calling the Midianites to the correct path of God, and forbidding them to worship false gods.

It is also said he told his people to stop being dishonest in their daily activities. Although he preached and prophesied for a sustained period of time, the majority of the people refused to listen to him. Shuayb, however, remained steadfast. He consistently preached powerfully against the wicked, telling them of the punishment that had befallen the sinful before them. Shuʿayb warned the people that their ignorance would lead to the destruction of Midian, giving historical examples of earlier prophets, including Noah, Hud, Saleh and Lot, all of whose people had been destroyed by God.

The people taunted Shuʿayb and told him that, were it not for the prestigious family he came from, he would surely have been stoned to death. Shuayb replied, &quot;Is my family of more consideration with you than God?&quot; When the Midianites refused to believe, they were destroyed by a mighty earthquake. The Qur&#x27;an, however, mentions that Shuʿayb, and his believing companions, were rescued from the thunderous punishment.

== Parallels with other prophets ==
Shuayb&#x27;s mission is often mentioned in the Qur&#x27;an with the mission of Noah, Hud, Saleh and Lot. Scholars have pointed out that these five prophets exemplify the early prophetic missions: The prophet would be sent to his community; the community would pay no attention to his warning and would instead threaten him with punishment; after years of preaching, God would ask him to leave his community, while his people were subsequently destroyed in a punishment. Scholars chronologically interpret the listing of the five prophets, so Shuʿayb was a descendant of Noah (preached about the Great Flood) and Abraham.

== Claimed burial places of Shuayb ==

=== Wādī Shuʿayb, Jordan ===
One claimed tomb of Shuayb is found in Jordan, west of the town of Mahis, in an area called &quot;Wādī Shuʿayb&quot; ().

=== Galilee, Palestine ===
The Galilean Shrine of Shu&#x27;ayb: the Druze believe the tomb of Nabi Shu&#x27;ayb is located near Hittin, in the Lower Galilee. Each year, on the 25th of April, the Druze gather at the site to discuss community affairs.

=== Guriyeh, Iran ===
There is also a tomb in the southwest of Iran, in the village Guriyeh, Shushtar, which has been recorded as the tomb of Shuayb.

<doc id="406653" wikidata="Q1598808" url="?curid=406653" title="San Germán, Puerto Rico">
<text>San Germán () is a historic town and municipality located in the Sabana Grande Valley of southwestern region of Puerto Rico, south of Mayagüez and Maricao, north of Lajas, east of Hormigueros and Cabo Rojo, and west of Sabana Grande. San Germán is spread over eighteen barrios plus San Germán Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is both a principal city of the San Germán–Cabo Rojo Metropolitan Statistical Area and the Mayagüez–San Germán–Cabo Rojo Combined Statistical Area.
San Germán is the second oldest city of Puerto Rico, after San Juan, and its historic downtown is preserved as the San Germán Historic District.

Puerto Rico was, at one time, divided administratively between the San Juan and the San Germán municipalities. The latter covered the western half of Puerto Rico and extended from the western shores of the island to Arecibo in the north and Ponce in the south.

==History==

The population of San Germán when Alonso Manso was named the first bishop of Puerto Rico in 1511 was &quot;about 50 residents&quot;. Outside of San Juan, Puerto Rico, San Germán was one of the largest settlements in the 16th century, as well as Coamo and Aguada.

Spanish settlement in San Germán occurred early in the conquest and colonization of Puerto Rico. After the destruction of a small early settlement of the same name near modern-day Añasco during a Taíno uprising which started in February 1511, in 1512 the new settlement was built by Miguel Díaz at Guayanilla
and was named after Germaine of Foix, the second wife of King Fernando II, and in reference of Saint Germanus of Auxerre. This town was attacked by French corsairs in August 1528, May 1538 and 1554. The construction of a small fort began in 1540, but work stopped in 1546 when the population of the town began moving inland to the current modern location.

On May 12, 1571, the Royal Audience (&quot;Real Audiencia&quot;) of Santo Domingo authorized that both the populations of San Germán and Santa María de Guadianilla be merged into a single city due to the constant French attacks. The new city was built on the Hills of Santa Marta, next to the Guanajibo River in 1573. Its official name was Nueva Villa de Salamanca, named after the city of Salamanca in Spain. However, the population called the city San Germán el Nuevo (&quot;New San Germán&quot;) and, eventually, the Villa de San Germán (City of San Germán).

San Germán is also known as the &quot;founder of towns&quot;, given the fact that in 1514 the Spanish Crown separated the island into two administrative territories (&quot;Partidos&quot;). The borders of the two partidos were established as the Camuy River to the north and the Jacagua River to the south. They were named the &quot;San Juan Partition&quot; and the &quot;San Germán Partition&quot;.

Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides in San Germán with the significant amount of rainfall.

==Geography==
San Germán is in the southwest region of the island. The town is located on the Sabana Grande valley which is bound by the Cordillera Central to the north and the Santa Marta Hills and the Lajas Valley to the south. Mountains in San Germán include Alto del Descanso () and Tetas de Cerro Gordo (). San Germán has a number of rivers: Río Caín, Río Duey, Río Rosario, Río Guanajibo (Estero), Río Hoconuco, Guamá River and Rio El Brujo.

<doc id="406662" wikidata="Q1990155" url="?curid=406662" title="Moses in Islam">
<text>Moses ( , ) is a prominent prophet and messenger of God and is the most frequently mentioned individual in the Quran, with his name being mentioned 136 times and his life being narrated and recounted more than that of any other prophet. Apart from the Quran, Moses is also described and praised in the Hadith literature as well. He is one of the most important prophets and messengers within Islam.

According to the Quran, Moses was born to an Israelite family. In his childhood, he is put in a basket which flows towards the Nile, and is eventually discovered by Pharaoh&#x27;s (Fir&#x27;awn) wife (not named in the Quran but called Asiya in Hadith), who takes Moses as her adopted son. After reaching adulthood, Moses then resides in Midian, before departing for Egypt again to threaten the Pharaoh. During his prophethood, Moses is said to have performed many miracles, and is also reported to have personally talked to God, who bestows the title &#x27;Speaker of God&#x27; () upon Moses. The prophet&#x27;s most famous miracle is dividing the Red Sea, with a miraculous staff provided by God. After Pharaoh&#x27;s death, Moses and his followers travel towards the Promised Land and the prophet dies within sight of the land. Moses is reported to have met Muhammad in the seven heavens following his ascension from Jerusalem during the Night Journey (). During the journey, Moses is said by Muslims to have repeatedly sent Muhammad back, and request a reduction in the number of required daily prayers, originally believed to be fifty, until only the five obligatory prayers remained.

Moses is viewed as a very important figure in Islam. According to Islamic theology, all Muslims must have faith in every prophet and messenger of God, which includes Moses and his brother Aaron. The life of Moses is generally seen as a spiritual parallel to the life of Muhammad, and Muslims consider many aspects of the two individuals&#x27; lives to be shared. Islamic literature also describes a parallel relation between their people and the incidents that occurred in their lifetimes; the exodus of the Israelites from ancient Egypt is considered to be similar in nature to the migration of Muhammad and his followers from Mecca to Medina as both events unfolded in the face of persecution—of the Israelites by the ancient Egyptians, and of the early Muslims by the Meccans, respectively. His revelations, such as the Ten Commandments, form part of the contents of the Torah and are central to the Abrahamic religions of Judaism and Christianity. Consequently, Jews and Christians are designated as &quot;People of the Book&quot; for Muslims and are to be recognized with this special status wherever Islamic law is applied. Moses is further revered in Islamic literature, which expands upon the incidents of his life and the miracles attributed to him in the Quran and hadith, such as his direct conversations with God.

Generally, Moses is seen as a legendary figure by biblical scholars, some of whom consider it possible that Moses or a Moses-like figure existed in the 13th century BCE.

==Life==
===Childhood===
In Islamic tradition, Moses was born into a family of Israelites living in Egypt. Of his family, Islamic tradition generally names his father Imran, corresponding to the Amram of the Hebrew Bible, traditional genealogies name Levi as his ancestor. Islam states that Moses was born in a time when the ruling Pharaoh had enslaved the Israelites after the time of the prophet Yusuf (Joseph). Islamic literature states that around the time of Moses&#x27;s birth, the Pharaoh had a dream in which he saw fire coming from the city of Jerusalem, which burned everything in his kingdom except in the land of the Israelites. Another version says that the Pharaoh dreamed of a little boy who caught the Pharaoh&#x27;s crown and destroyed it, although there is no authentic Islamic reference to whether the dreams actually occurred. When the Pharaoh is informed that one of the male children would grow up to overthrow him, he orders the killing of all newborn Israelite males in order to prevent the prediction from occurring. Experts of economics in Pharaoh&#x27;s court advise him that killing the male infants of the Israelites would result in loss of manpower. Therefore, they suggest that male infants should be killed in one year but spared the next. Moses&#x27;s brother, Aaron, was born in the year when infants were spared, while Moses was born in the year when infants were to be killed.

====Incident of the Nile====
According to Islamic tradition, Jochebed, Moses&#x27;s mother, suckled him secretly during this period. When they were in danger of being caught, God instructed her to put him in a wicker basket and set him adrift on the Nile. She instructs her daughter to follow the course of the ark and report back to her. As her daughter follows the ark along the riverbank, Moses is discovered by the Pharaoh&#x27;s wife, Asiya, who convinces the Pharaoh to adopt him. When Asiya ordered wet nurses for Moses, Moses refuses to be breastfed. Islamic tradition states that this is because God forbids Moses from being fed by any wet nurse in order to reunite him with his mother. His sister worries that Moses has not been fed for some time, so she appears to the Pharaoh and informs him that she knows someone who can feed him. After being questioned, she is ordered to bring the woman being discussed. The sister brings their mother, who feeds Moses, and thereafter, she is appointed as the wet nurse of Moses.

== Historicity ==

== Prophethood ==

=== Test of prophecy ===
According to Isra&#x27;iliyat hadith, when Moses is on the Pharaoh&#x27;s lap in his childhood, he grabs the Pharaoh&#x27;s beard and slaps him in the face. This action prompts the Pharaoh to consider Moses as the Israelite who would overthrow him, and the Pharaoh wanted to kill Moses. The Pharaoh&#x27;s wife persuades him not to kill him because he is an infant. Instead, he decides to test Moses. Two plates are set before young Moses, one containing rubies and the other glowing coals. Moses reaches out for the rubies, but the angel Gabriel directs his hand to the coals. Moses grabs a glowing coal and puts it in his mouth, burning his tongue. After the incident, Moses suffers a speech defect, but is spared by the Pharaoh.

=== Escape to Midian and Marriage ===
After having reached adulthood, according to the Quran, Moses is passing through a city when he comes across an Egyptian fighting with an Israelite. The Israelite man is believed to be Sam&#x27;ana, known in the Bible to be a Samaritan, who asks Moses for his assistance against the Egyptian who is mistreating him. Moses attempts to intervene and becomes involved in the dispute. Moses strikes the Egyptian in a state of anger, which results in his death. Moses then repents to God, and the following day, he again comes across the same Israelite fighting with another Egyptian. The Israelite again asks Moses for help, and as Moses approaches the Israelite, he reminds Moses of his manslaughter and asks if Moses intended to kill the Israelite. Moses is reported, and the Pharaoh orders Moses to be killed. However, Moses flees to the desert after being alerted to his punishment. According to Islamic tradition, after Moses arrives in Midian, he witnesses two female shepherds driving back their flocks from a well. Moses approaches them and inquires about their work as shepherds and their retreat from the well. Upon hearing their answers and about the old age of their father, although his identity is contested, generally accepted to be Prophet Shuaib, Moses waters their flocks for them. The two shepherds return to their home and inform their father of Moses. They then invite Moses to a feast. At that feast, their father asks Moses to work for him for eight years in return for marriage to one of his daughters. Moses consents and works for him for ten years.

===Preaching===
====Call to prophethood====

According to the Quran, Moses departs for Egypt along with his family after completing the contracted time period. During their travel, as they stop near At-Tur, Moses observes a large fire and instructs the family to wait until he returns with fire for them. When Moses reaches the Valley of Tuwa, God calls out directly to him from the right side of the valley from a tree, on what is revered as &quot;Al-Buq‘ah Al-Mubārakah&quot; (&quot;The Blessed Ground&quot;) in the Quran. Moses is commanded by God to remove his shoes and is informed of his selection as a prophet, his obligation of prayer and the Day of Judgment. Moses is then ordered to throw his rod, which turns into a snake, and later instructed to hold it. The Quran then narrates Moses being ordered to insert his hand into his clothes and when he revealed it, it shines a bright light. God states that these are signs for the Pharaoh, and orders Moses to invite Pharaoh to the worship of one God. Moses expresses his fear of Pharaoh and requests God to heal his speech impediment and grant him Aaron as a helper. According to Islamic tradition, both of them state their fear of Pharaoh, but are assured by God that He would be observing them and commands them to inform the Pharaoh to free the Israelites. Therefore, they depart to preach to the Pharaoh.

The Quran states that Moses was sent by God to confront the erstwhile (pharaoh) of ancient Egypt and to guide the Israelites, who were enslaved by the former. The Quran directly validates Moses and Aaron as prophets chosen by God:

Because he is the only Prophet to be directly spoken to by God (evidenced in , &quot;[...] and to Moses, Allah spoke directly&quot;), whereas the others would communicate through Angel Gabriel, Moses is titled &quot;Kaleem Allah&quot; (&quot;Speaker of God&quot;). 

====Arrival at Pharaoh&#x27;s court====
When Moses and Aaron arrive in the court of Pharaoh and proclaim their prophethood to the Pharaoh, the Pharaoh begins questioning Moses about the God he follows. The Quran narrates that Moses answers the Pharaoh by stating that he follows the God who gives everything its form and guides them. The Pharaoh then inquires about the generations who passed before them, and Moses answers that knowledge of the previous generations is with God. The Quran also mentions the Pharaoh questioning Moses: “And what is the Lord of the worlds?” Moses replies that God is the lord of the heavens, the earth and what is between them. The Pharaoh then reminds Moses of his childhood with them and the killing of the man he has done. Moses admits that he has committed the deed in ignorance, but insists that he is now forgiven and guided by God. Pharaoh accuses him of being mad and threatens to imprison him if he continues to proclaim that the Pharaoh is not the true god. Moses informs him that he has come with manifest signs from God. When the Pharaoh demands to see the signs, Moses throws his staff to the floor, and it turns into a serpent. He then draws out his hand, and it shines a bright white light. The Pharaoh&#x27;s counselors advises him that this is sorcery, and on their advice he summons the best sorcerers in the kingdom. The Pharaoh challenges Moses to a battle between him and the Pharaoh&#x27;s magicians, asking him to choose the day. Moses chose the day of a festival.

====Confrontation with sorcerers====

When the sorcerers come to the Pharaoh, he promises them that they would be among the honored among his assembly if they won. On the day of the festival of Egypt, Moses grants the sorcerers the chance to perform first and warned them that God would expose their tricks. The Quran states that the sorcerers bewitch the eyes of the observers and cause them terror. The summoned sorcerers throw their rods on the floor, and they appear to change into snakes by the effect of their magic. At first, Moses becomes concerned witnessing the tricks of the magicians, but is assured by God to not be worried. When Moses does the same his rod, the serpent devours all the sorcerers&#x27; snakes. The sorcerers realize that they have witnessed a miracle. They proclaim belief in the message of Moses and fall onto their knees in prostration despite threats from the Pharaoh. The Pharaoh is enraged by this and accuses them of working under Moses. He warns them that if they insist in believing in Moses, he would cut their hands and feet on opposite sides, and crucify them on the trunks of palm trees for their betrayal of the Pharaoh. The magicians, however, remain steadfast to their newfound faith and die as believers.

===Exodus===
====Plagues of Egypt====
After losing against Moses, the Pharaoh continues to plan against Moses and the Israelites, ordering
meetings with the ministers, princes and priests. According to the Quran, the Pharaoh is reported to have ordered his minister, Haman, to build a tower so that he &quot;may look at the God of Moses&quot;. Gradually, the Pharaoh begins to fear that Moses may convince the people that he is not the true god, and wants to have Moses killed. After this threat, a man from the family of Pharaoh, who had years ago warned Moses, comes forth and warns the people of the punishment of God for the wrongdoers and reward for the righteous. The Pharaoh defiantly refuses to allow the Israelites to leave Egypt. The Quran states that God decrees punishments over him and his people. These punishments come in the form of floods that demolish their dwellings, swarms of locust that destroy the crops, pestilence of lice that makes their life miserable, toads that croak and spring everywhere, and the turning of all drinking water into blood. Each time the Pharaoh is subjected to humiliation, his defiance becomes greater. The Quran mentions that God instructs Moses to travel at night with the Israelites and warns them that they would be pursued. The Pharaoh chases the Israelites with his army after realizing that they have left during the night.

==== Dividing the sea ====

Having escaped and now being pursued by the Egyptians, the Israelites stop when they reach the seafront. The Israelites exclaim to Moses that they would be overtaken by Pharaoh and his army. In response, God commands Moses to strike the Red Sea with his staff, instructing them not to fear being inundated or drowning in sea water. Upon striking the sea, Moses splits it into two parts, forming a path that allows the Israelites to pass through. The Pharaoh witnesses the sea dividing alongside his army, but as they also try to pass through, the sea closes in on them. As he is about to die, Pharaoh proclaims belief in the God of Moses and the Israelites, but his belief is rejected by God. One authentic hadith mentions that Angel Gabriel shoved sand into Pharaoh&#x27;s mouth to stop him from saying anything more, fearing God would forgive him despite his insincerity. The Quran states that the body of the Pharaoh is made a sign and warning for all future generations. As the Israelites continue their journey to the Promised Land, they come upon people who are worshipping idols. The Israelites request to have an idol to worship, but Moses refuses and states that the polytheists would be destroyed by God. They are granted manna and quail as sustenance from God, but the Israelites ask Moses to pray to God for the earth to grow lentils, onions, herbs and cucumbers for their sustenance. When they stop in their travel to the Promised Land due to lack of water, Moses is commanded by God to strike a stone, and upon its impact twelve springs came forth, each for a specific tribe of the Israelites.

===Years in the wilderness===
====Revelation of the Torah====
After leaving Egypt, Moses leads the Israelites to Mount Sinai (&quot;Tur&quot;). Upon arrival, Moses leaves the people, instructing them that Aaron is to be their leader during his absence. Moses encountered Iblis at Mount Sinai and Moses asked him why he refused to prostrate before Ādam. Moses is commanded by God to fast for thirty days and to then proceed to the valley of Tuwa for guidance. God orders Moses to fast again for ten days before returning. After completing his fasts, Moses returns to the spot where he had first received his miracles from God. He takes off his shoes as before and goes down into prostration. Moses prays to God for guidance and begs God to reveal himself to him. It is narrated in the Quran that God tells him that it would not be possible for Moses to perceive God, but that He would reveal himself to the mountain, stating: &quot;You cannot see Me! But look at the mountain. If it remains firm in its place, only then will you see Me.&quot; When God reveals himself to the mountain, it instantaneously turns into ashes, and Moses loses consciousness. When he recovers, he goes down in total submission and asks forgiveness of God.

Moses is then given the Ten Commandments by God as Guidance and as Mercy. Meanwhile, in his absence, a man named Samiri creates a Golden Calf, proclaiming it to be the God of Moses. The people begin to worship it. Aaron attempts to guide them away from the Golden Calf, but the Israelites refuse to do so until Moses returns. Moses, having thus received the scriptures for his people, is informed by God that the Israelites has been tested in his absence, and they have gone astray by worshiping the Golden Calf. Moses comes down from the mountain and returns to his people. The Quran states that Moses, in his anger, grabs hold of Aaron by his beard and admonishes him for doing nothing to stop them, but when Aaron tells Moses of his fruitless attempt to stop them, Moses understands his helplessness, and they both pray to God for forgiveness. Moses then questions Samiri for creating the Golden Calf. Samiri replies that it had simply occurred to him, and he had done so. Samiri is exiled, and the Golden Calf is burned to ashes, and the ashes are thrown into the sea. The wrong-doers who have worshipped the Calf are ordered to be punished for their crime.

Moses then chooses 70 elites from among the Israelites and orders them to pray for forgiveness. Shortly thereafter, the elders travel alongside Moses to witness the speech between Moses and God. Despite witnessing the speech between them, they refuse to believe until they see God with their own eyes, so as punishment, a thunderbolt kills them. Moses prays for their forgiveness, and they are resurrected. They return to camp and set up a tent dedicated to worshiping God, as Aaron had taught them from the Torah. They resume their journey towards the Promised Land.

====The Israelites and the cow====
Islamic exegesis narrates the incident of an old and pious man who lives among the Israelites and earns his living honestly. As he is dying, he places his wife, his little son, and his only possession—a calf in God&#x27;s care—instructing his wife to take the calf and leave it in a forest. His wife does as she is told, and after a few years, when the son has grown up, she informs him about the calf. The son travels to the forest with a rope. He prostrates and prays to God to return the calf to him. As the son prays, the now-grown cow stops beside him. The son takes the cow with him. The son is also pious and earns his living as a lumberjack.

One wealthy man among the Israelites dies and leaves his wealth to his son. The relatives of the wealthy son secretly murder the son in order to inherit his wealth. The other relatives of the son come to Moses and ask for his help in tracing the killers. Moses instructs them to slaughter a cow, cut out its tongue, and then place it on the corpse; this would reveal the killers. The relatives do not believe Moses and do not understand why they are instructed to slaughter a cow when they are trying to find the killers. They accuse Moses of joking, but Moses manages to convince them that he is serious. Hoping to delay the process, the relatives ask the type and age of the cow they should slaughter, but Moses tells them that it is neither old nor young but in-between the two ages. Instead of searching for the cow described, they inquire about its colour, to which Moses replies that it is yellow. They ask Moses for more details, and he informs them that it is unyoked, and does not plow the soil nor does it water the tilth. The relatives and Moses search for the described cow, but the only cow that they find to fit the description belongs to an orphaned youth. The youth refuses to sell the cow without consulting his mother. All of them travel together to the youth&#x27;s home. The mother refuses to sell the cow, despite the relatives constantly increasing the price. They urge the orphaned son to tell his mother to be more reasonable. However, the son refuse to sell the cow without his mother&#x27;s agreement, claiming that he would not sell it even if they offered to fill its skin with gold. At this, the mother agrees to sell it for its skin filled with gold. The relatives and Moses consent, and the cow is slaughtered and the corpse is touched by its tongue. The corpse rises back to life and reveals the identity of the killers.

==== Meeting with Al-Khidr ====
One hadith recounts that when Moses is delivering an impressive sermon, an Israelite inquires if there were anyone more knowledgeable than him. When Moses denies any such person exists, he receives a revelation from God, which admonishes Moses for not attributing absolute knowledge to God and informs Moses that there is someone named Al-Khidr who is more knowledgeable than him. Upon inquiry, God informs Moses that Al-Khidr would be found at the junction of two seas. God instructs Moses to take a live fish and at the location where it would escape, Al-Khidr would be found. Afterwards, Moses departs and travels with a boy named Yusha (&quot;Yeshua bin Nun&quot;), until they stop near a rock where Moses rests. While Moses is asleep, the fish escapes from the basket. When Moses wakes up, they continue until they stop to eat. At that moment, Yusha remembers that the fish had slipped from the basket at the rock. He informs Moses about the fish, and Moses remembers God&#x27;s statement, so they retrace their steps back to the rock. There they see Al-Khidr. Moses approaches Al-Khidr and greets him. Al-Khidr instead asks Moses how people are greeted in their land. Moses introduces himself, and Al-Khidr identifies him as the prophet of the Israelites. According to the Quran, Moses asks Al-Khidr: &quot;May I follow you, provided that you teach me some of the right guidance you have been taught?&quot; Al-Khidr warns that he would not be able to remain patient and consents on the condition that Moses would not question his actions.

They walk on the seashore and pass by a ship. The crew of the ship recognize Al-Khidr and offer them to board their ship free of charge. When they are on the boat, Al-Khidr takes an adze and pulls up a plank. When Moses notices what Al-Khidr is doing, he is astonished and stops him. Moses reminds Al-Khidr that the crew has taken them aboard for free. Al-Khidr admonishes Moses for forgetting his promise of not asking. Moses states that he has forgotten and asks to be forgiven. When they leave the seashore, they pass by a boy playing with others. Al-Khidr takes hold of the boy&#x27;s head and kills him. Moses is again astonished by this action and questions Al-Khidr regarding what he had done. Al-Khidr admonishes Moses again for not keeping his promise, and Moses apologizes and asks Al-Khidr to leave him if he again questions Al-Khidr. Both of them travel on until they happened upon a village. They ask the villagers for food, but the inhabitants refuse to entertain them as guests. They see therein a wall which is about to collapse, and Al-Khidr repairs the wall. Moses asks Al-Khidr why he had repaired the wall when the inhabitants refuse to entertain them as guests and give them food. Moses states that Al-Khidr could have taken wages for his work.

Al-Khidr informs Moses that they are now to part ways as Moses has broken his promise. Al-Khidr then explains each of his actions. He informs Moses that he had broken the ship with the adze because a ruler who reigns in those parts took all functional ships by force; Al-Khidr has created a defect in order to prevent their ship from being seized. Al-Khidr then explains that he has killed the child because he was defiant and disobedient to his parents, and Al-Khidr fears that the child would overburden them with his misconduct, and explained that God would replace him with a better child who is more obedient and has more affection. Al-Khidr then explains that he has fixed the wall because it belongs to two helpless orphans whose father was a pious man. God wishes to reward them for their piety. Al-Khidr states that there is a treasure hidden underneath the wall, and by repairing it, it would not break until the orphans are of age to be able to reclaim it.

==== Other incidents ====

The sayings of Muhammad (hadith), Islamic literature and Quranic exegesis also narrate some incidents of the life of Moses. One story goes that because of his extreme &quot;hayaa&#x27;&quot; (shyness/modesty), Moses would bathe alone and apart from the other Israelites who all bathe together. This leads the Bani Israel to say that Moses does so due to a scrotal hernia. One day, when Moses is bathing in seclusion, he puts his clothes on a stone, and the stone flees with his clothes. Moses rushes after the stone, and when the Bani Israel see him, they say, &#x27;By God, Moses has got no defect in his body&quot;. Moses then beats the stone with his clothes, and Abu Huraira states, &quot;By God! There are still six or seven marks present on the stone from that excessive beating&quot;. In a hadith, Muhammad states that the stone still has three to five marks due to Moses hitting it.

==Death==

Aaron dies shortly before Moses. It is reported in a Sunni hadith that when Azrael, the Angel of Death, comes to Moses, Moses slaps him in the eye. The angel returns to God and tells Him that Moses does not want to die. God tells the angel to return and tell Moses to put his hand on the back of an ox, and for every hair that comes under his hand, he would be granted a year of life. When Moses asks God what would happen after the granted time, God informs him that he would die after the period. Moses, therefore, requests God for death at his current age near the Promised Land &quot;at a distance of a stone&#x27;s throw from it.&quot;

===Burial place===


The grave of Moses is located at Maqam El-Nabi Musa, which lies south of Jericho and east of Jerusalem in the Judean wilderness. A side road to the right of the main Jerusalem-Jericho road, about beyond the sign indicating sea level, leads to the site. The Fatimid, Taiyabi and Dawoodi Bohra sects also believe in the same.

The main body of the present shrine, mosque, minaret and some rooms were built during the reign of Baibars, a Mamluk Sultan, in 1270. Over the years Nabi Moses was expanded, protected by walls, and includes 120 rooms in its two levels which hosted the visitors.

==== Martyrdom ====
Moreover, by indicating that Moses wants to be separated from Aaron, his brother, many of the Israelites proclaim that Moses had killed Aaron on the mountain to secure this so-called separation. However, according to the accounts of al-Tabari, Aaron dies of natural causes: “When they [Moses and Aaron] fell asleep, death took Harun... When he was dead, the house was taken away, the tree disappeared, and the bed was raised to heaven”. When Moses returns to the Children of Israel, his followers, from the mountain without Aaron, they are found saying that Moses killed Aaron because he envied their love for Aaron, for Aaron was more forbearing and more lenient with them. This notion would strongly indicate that Moses could have indeed killed Aaron to secure the separation for which he prayed to God. To redeem his faith to his followers though, al-Tabari quotes Moses by saying “He was my brother. Do you think that I would kill him?” It was recorded that Moses recited two rak’ahs to regain the faith of his followers. God answers Moses’ prayers by making the bed of Aaron descend from heaven to earth so that the Children of Israel could witness the truth that Aaron died of natural causes.

The unexpected death of Aaron appears to make the argument that his death is merely an allusion to the mysterious and miraculous death of Moses. In the accounts of Moses’s death, al-Tabari reports, “[W]hile Musa was walking with his servant Joshua, a black wind suddenly approached. When Joshua saw it, he thought that the Hour—the hour of final judgement—was at hand. He clung to Musa…. But Musa withdrew himself gently from under his shirt, leaving it in Joshua’s hand”. This mysterious death of Moses is also asserted in Deuteronomy 34:5, “And Moses the servant of the LORD died there in Moab”. There is no explanation to why Moses may have died or why Moses may have been chosen to die: there is only this mysterious “disappearance”. According to Islamic tradition, Moses is buried at Maqam El-Nabi Musa, Jericho.

Although the death of Moses seems to be a topic of mysterious questioning, it is not the main focus of this information. However, according to Arabic translation of the word martyr, &quot;shahid&quot;—to see, to witness, to testify, to become a model and paradigm is the person who sees and witnesses, and is therefore the witness, as if the martyr himself sees the truth physically and thus stands firmly on what he sees and hears. To further this argument, in the footnotes of the Quran translated by M.A.S. Abdel Haleem, “The noun shahid is much more complex than the term martyr….The root of shahid conveys ‘to witness, to be present, to attend, to testify, and/or to give evidence’”. Additionally, Haleem notes that the martyrs in the Quran are chosen by God to witness Him in Heaven. This act of witnessing is given to those who are “given the opportunity to give evidence of the depth of their faith by sacrificing their worldly lives, and will testify with the prophets on the Day of Judgment”. This is supported in : “…if you have suffered a blow, they too have the upper hand. We deal out such days among people in turn, for God to find out who truly believes, for Him to choose martyrs from among you…”

It is also stated in the Quran that the scriptures in which Moses brings forth from God to the Children of Israel are seen as the light and guidance of God himself (). This strongly indicates that Moses dies as a martyr: Moses dies being a witness to God; Moses dies giving his sacrifice to the worldly views of God; and Moses dies in the act of conveying the message of God to the Children of Israel. Although his death remains a mystery and even though he did not act in a religious battle, he does in fact die for the causation of a Religious War, a war that showcases the messages of God through scripture.

In light of this observation, John Renard claims that Muslim tradition distinguishes three types of supernatural events: “the sign worked directly by God alone; the miracle worked through a prophet; and the marvel effected through a non-prophetic figure”. If these three types of supernatural events are put into retrospect with the understanding of martyrdom and Moses, the aspect of being a martyr plays out to resemble the overall understanding of what “Islam” translates to. The concept of martyrdom in Islam is linked with the entire religion of Islam. This whole process can be somehow understood if the term &#x27;Islam&#x27; is appreciated. This is because being a derivate of the Arabic root &quot;s-l-m&quot;, which means &quot;surrender&quot; and &quot;peace&quot;, Islam is a wholesome and peaceful submission to the will of God. Just like Moses is an example of the surrender to God, the term &quot;martyr&quot; further reinforces the notion that through the signs, the miracle, and the marvel, the ones chosen by God are in direct correlation to the lives of the prophets.

In conclusion, although the death of Moses is a mysterious claim by God, the framework of Moses describes the spiritual quest and progress of the individual soul as it unfolds to reveal the relationship to God. Nevertheless, because of his actions, his ability to be a witness and his success at being a model for the Children of Israel his life were a buildup to the ideals of martyrdom. His death and his faithful obligations toward God have led his mysterious death to be an example of a true prophet and a true example of a martyrdom.

==Isra and Mi&#x27;raj==

During his Night Journey (&quot;Isra&quot;), Muhammad is said to have led Moses along with Jesus, Abraham and all other prophets in prayer. Moses is mentioned to be among the prophets who Muhammad meets during his ascension to heaven (&quot;Mi&#x27;raj&quot;) alongside Gabriel.

Moses and Muhammad are reported to have exchanged greetings with each other, and Moses is reported to have cried due to the fact that the followers of Muhammad are going to enter Heaven in greater numbers than his followers. When God enjoins fifty prayers to the community to Muhammad and his followers, Muhammad once again encounters Moses, who asks what has been commanded by God. When Moses is told about the fifty prayers, he advises Muhammad to ask a reduction in prayers for his followers. When Muhammad returns to God and asks for a reduction, he is granted his request. Once again, he meets Moses, who again inquires about the command of God. Despite the reduction, Moses again urges Muhammad to ask for another reduction. Muhammad again returns and asks for a reduction. This continues until only five prayers are remaining. When Moses again tells Muhammad to ask for a reduction, Muhammad replies that he is shy of asking again. Therefore, the five prayers are finally enjoined upon the Muslim community.

==In Islamic thought==

Moses is revered as a prominent prophet and messenger in Islam, and his narrative is recounted the most among the prophets in the Quran. He is regarded by Muslims as one of the five most prominent prophets in Islam, along with Jesus (&quot;Isa&quot;), Abraham (&quot;Ibrahim&quot;), Noah (&quot;Nuh&quot;) and Muhammad. These five prophets are known as &quot;Ulu’l azm prophets&quot;, the prophets who are favored by God and are described in the Quran to be endowed with determination and perseverance. Islamic tradition describes Moses being granted many miracles, including a glowing hand and a staff that turns into a snake. The life of Moses is often described as a parallel to that of Muhammad. Both are regarded as being ethical and exemplary prophets. Both are regarded as lawgivers, ritual leaders, judges and the military leaders for their people. Islamic literature also identifies a parallel between their followers and the incidents of their history. The exodus of the Israelites is often viewed as a parallel to the migration of the followers of Muhammad. The drowning and destruction of the Pharaoh and his army is also described to be a parallel to the Battle of Badr. In Islamic tradition, Moses is especially favored by God and converses directly with Him, unlike other prophets who receives revelation by God through an intervening angel. Moses receives the Torah directly from God. Despite conversing with God, the Quran states that Moses is unable to see God. For these feats, Moses is revered in Islam as &quot;Kalim Allah&quot;, meaning the one who talks with God.

===Revealed scripture===

In Islam, Moses is revered as the receiver of a scripture known as the Torah (&quot;Tawrat&quot;). The Quran describes the Torah as “guidance and a light&quot; for the Israelites and that it contains teachings about the Oneness of God (&quot;Tawhid&quot;), prophethood and the Day of Judgment. It is regarded as containing teachings and laws for the Israelites which are taught and practiced by Moses and Aaron to them. Among the books of the complete Hebrew Bible (Genesis, Deuteronomy, Numbers, Leviticus and Exodus), only the Torah is considered to be divinely revealed instead of the whole Tanakh or the Old Testament. The Quran mentions that the Ten Commandments are given to the Israelites through Moses, and the Commandments contain guidance and understanding of all things. The Torah was the &quot;furqan&quot;, meaning &quot;difference&quot;, a term which is regarded as having used for itself as well. Moses preaches the same message as Muhammad, and the Torah foretells the arrival of Muhammad. Modern Muslim scholars such as Mark N. Swanson and David Richard Thomas cite Deuteronomy 18:15–18 as foretelling the arrival of Muhammad.

Some Muslims believe that the Torah has been corrupted (&quot;tahrif&quot;). The exact nature of the corruption has been discussed among scholars. The majority of Muslim scholars, including Ibn Rabban and Ibn Qutayba, have stated that the Torah had been distorted in its interpretation rather than in its text. The scholar Tabari considered the corruption to be caused by distortion of the meaning and interpretation of the Torah. Tabari considered the learned rabbis of producing writings alongside the Torah, which were based on their own interpretations of the text. The rabbis then reportedly &quot;twisted their tongues&quot; and made them appear as though they were from the Torah. In doing so, Al-Tabari concluded that they added to the Torah what was not originally part of it, and these writings were used to denounce Muhammad and his followers. Tabari also states that these writings of the rabbis were mistaken by some Jews to be part of the Torah. A minority view held among scholars such as Al-Maqdisi is that the text of the Torah itself was corrupted. Maqdisi claimed that the Torah had been distorted in the time of Moses, by the seventy elders when they came down from Mount Sinai. Maqdisi states that the Torah was further corrupted in the time of Ezra, when his disciples made additions and subtractions in the text narrated by Ezra. Maqdisi also stated that discrepancies between the Jewish Torah, the Samaritan Torah and the Greek Septuagint point to the fact that the Torah was corrupted. Ibn Hazm viewed the Torah of his era as a forgery and considered various verses as contradicting other parts of the Torah and the Quran. Ibn Hazm considered Ezra as the forger of the Torah, who dictates the Torah from his memory and made significant changes to the text. Ibn Hazm accepted some verses which, he stated, foretold the arrival of Muhammad.

===In religious sects===
Sunni Muslims fast on the Ashura (the tenth day of Muharram, the first month in the Hijri calendar as similar to Yom Kippur which is on the tenth day of Tishrei, and the first month of the Hebrew civil year) to commemorate the liberation of the Israelites from the Pharaoh. Shia Muslims view Moses and his relation to Aaron as a prefiguration of the relation between Muhammad and his son-in-law, Ali ibn Abi Talib. Ismaili Shias regard Moses as 4th in the line of the 7 &#x27;speaking prophets&#x27; (&quot;natiq&quot;), whose revealed law was for all believers to follow. In Sufism, Moses is regarded as having a special position, being described as a prophet as well as a spiritual wayfarer. The author Paul Nwyia notes that the Quranic accounts of Moses have inspired Sufi exegetes to &quot;meditate upon his experience as being the entry into a direct relationship with God, so that later the Sufis would come to regard him as the perfect mystic called to enter into the mystery of God&quot;. Muslim scholars such as Norman Solomon and Timothy Winter state without naming that some Sufi commentators excuse Moses from the consequence of his request to be granted a vision of God, as they consider that it is &quot;the ecstasy of hearing God which compelled him to seek completion of union through vision&quot;. The Quranic account of the meeting of Moses and Al-Khidr is also noted by Muslim writers as being of special importance in Sufi tradition. Some writers such as John Renard and Phyllis G. Jestice note that Sufi exegetes often explain the narrative by associating Moses for possessing exoteric knowledge while attributing esoteric knowledge to Al-Khidr. The author John Renard states that Sufis consider this as a lesson, &quot;to endure his apparently authority in view of higher meanings&quot;.

===In Islamic literature===

Moses is also revered in Islamic literature, which narrates and explains different parts of the life of Moses. Persian Muslim scholar and mystic Rumi, who titles Moses as the &quot;spirit enkindler&quot;, also includes a story of Moses and the shepherd in his book, the &quot;Masnavi&quot;. The story narrates the horror of Moses, when he encounters a shepherd who is engaged in anthropomorphic devotions to God. Moses accuses the shepherd of blasphemy; when the shepherd repents and leaves, Moses is rebuked by God for &quot;having parted one of His servants from Him&quot;. Moses seeks out the shepherd and informs him that he was correct in his prayers. The authors Norman Solomon and Timothy Winter regard the story to be &quot;intended as criticism of and warning to those who in order to avoid anthropomorphism, negate the Divine attributes&quot;. Rumi mainly mentions the life of Moses by his encounter with the burning tree, his white hand, his struggle with the Pharaoh and his conversation with God on Mount Sinai. According to Rumi, when Moses came across the tree in the valley of &quot;Tuwa&quot; and perceived the tree consumed by fire, he in fact saw the light of a &quot;hundred dawns and sunrises&quot;. Rumi considered the light a &quot;&quot; of God and the of the love of God. Many versions of the conversation of Moses and God are presented by Rumi; in all versions Moses is commanded to remove his footwear, which is interpreted to mean his attention to the world. Rumi commented on Quran considering the speech of God to be in a form accessible only to prophets instead of verbal sounds. Rumi considers the miracles given to Moses as assurance to him of the success of his prophethood and as a means of persuasion to him to accept his mission. Rumi regarded Moses as the most important of the messenger-prophets before Muhammad.

The Shi&#x27;a Quranic exegesis scholar and thinker Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei, in his commentary &quot;Balance of Judgment on the Exegesis of the Qur&#x27;an&quot; attempted to show the infallibility of Moses in regard to his request for a vision of God and his breaking of his promise to Al-Khidr as a part of the Shi&#x27;a doctorine of prophetic (&quot;Ismah&quot;). Tabatabaei attempted to solve the problem of vision by using various philosophical and theological arguments to state that the vision for God meant a necessary need for knowledge. According to Tabatabaei, Moses was not responsible for the promise broken to Al-Khidr as he had added &quot;God willing&quot; after his promise. The Islamic reformist and activist Sayyid Qutb, also mentions Moses in his work, &quot;In the Shade of the Quran&quot;. Sayyid Qutb interpreted the narrative of Moses, keeping in view the sociological and political problems facing the Islamic world in his era; he considered the narrative of Moses to contain teachings and lessons for the problems which faced the Muslims of his era. According to Sayyid Qutb, when Moses was preaching to the Pharaoh, he was entering the &quot;battle between faith and oppression&quot;. Qutb believed that Moses was an important figure in Islamic teachings as his narrative symbolized the struggle to &quot;expel evil and establish righteousness in the world&quot; which included the struggle from oppessive tyrants, a struggle which Qutb considered was the core teaching of the Islamic faith.

The Sixth Imam, Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, regarded the journey of Moses to Midian and to the valley of &quot;Tuwa&quot; as a spiritual journey. The turning of the face of Moses towards Midian is stated to be the turning of his heart towards God. His prayer to God asking for help of is described to be his awareness of his need. The commentary alleged to the Sixth Imam then states the command to remove his shoes symbolized the command to remove everything from his heart except God. These attributes are stated to result in him being honoured by God&#x27;s speech. The Sufi mystic and philosopher, Ibn Arabi wrote about Moses in his book &quot;The Bezels of Wisdom&quot; dedicating a chapter discussing &quot;the Wisdom of Eminence in the word of Musa&quot;. Ibn Arabi considered Moses to be a &quot;fusion&quot; of the infants murdered by the Pharaoh, stating that the spiritual reward which God had chosen for each of the infants manifested in the character of Moses. According to Ibn Arabi, Moses was from birth an &quot;&quot; of younger spirits acting on older ones. Ibn Arabi considered the ark to be the personification of his humanity while the water of the river Nile to signifiy his imagination, rational thought and sense perception.

During the 20th century the story of Moses&#x27;s confrontation with Pharaoh has been invoked by Islamists to justify their opposition to “disbelieving” secular regimes and tyrannical rulers. Sayyid Qutb (d. 1966) and Jihad movements in Egypt condemned Gamal Abdel Nasser (d. 1970) and Anwar as-Sadat (d. 1981), both presidents of Egypt, for being equivalents to the unbelieving Pharaoh who opposed Moses; members of the Jihad Group assassinated as-Sadat for being what they saw as a disbeliever. During the Iranian revolution of 1978–79, government troops were cautioned not to &quot;Kill Moses [members of the Islamic opposition] for the sake of Pharaoh [the Shah’s regime].&quot;

=== Appearance ===
According to Ibn Abbas, Muhammad reported, &quot;On the night of my Ascent to Heaven, I saw Moses, who was a tall, brown man...&quot; [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].

While all hadiths discussing Moses&#x27;s appearance agree that he was brown-skinned and extremely tall, there are differing depictions on the texture of his hair.

Both narrations are found in Muhammad al-Bukhari&#x27;s book &quot;Sahih al-Bukhari&quot;, a revered and trusted source of authentic hadiths. The first narration in Vol. 4 mentions Moses possessing straight hair:

However, the second hadith found in Vol. 7 portrays him having curly hair:

<text>The trout cod (Maccullochella macquariensis) or bluenose cod, is a large predatory freshwater fish of the genus &quot;Maccullochella&quot; and the family Percichthyidae, closely related to the Murray cod. It was originally widespread in the south-east corner of the Murray-Darling river system in Australia, but is now an endangered species.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, when trout cod were widely recognised as a separate species by commercial fishermen, recreational fishermen, riverside residents and fisheries scientists, they were generally known as bluenose cod or simply bluenose, particularly in Victoria. In some parts of New South Wales however they were also known as trout cod, and this common name was adopted when the species status of the fish was finally confirmed by genetic studies in the early 1970s. This choice of official common name was perhaps unfortunate; it has been suggested that bluenose cod is a more appropriate name as the name trout cod causes confusion amongst the Australian public. (Trout cod are an Australian native freshwater fish; they are not a hybrid between Murray cod and introduced trout species.)

 Trout cod are a listed species on a number of different registers including Endangered under the New South Wales Fisheries Management Act 1994, the Australian Commonwealth&#x27;s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, the Australian Capital Territory&#x27;s Nature Conservation Act 1980 and by the World Conservation Union (IUCN). They are also listed as Threatened under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1998.

Fossils of genus &quot;Maccullochella&quot; can be found from Miocene epoch (from about 23.03 to 5.332 million years ago) to recent age, while the species &quot;Maccullochella macquariensis&quot; is present from Lower Pliocene (3.6–5.3 mya) to recent age.

==Description==

Trout cod have been reliably recorded to at least 80 cm and 16 kg, but there are some credible anecdotal accounts of larger specimens.

Trout cod are broadly similar to the Murray cod, however there are some distinct differences in morphology and colouration.

Trout cod are a small to medium groper-like fish with a deep, elongated body that is round in cross section. In contrast to Murray cod, trout cod have a pointed head with the top jaw overhanging the bottom jaw, and the slope of the head is straight. The eyes are slightly larger and more prominent than in Murray cod. The head tends to be free of speckling however a distinct dark stripe through the eye is usually present.

Trout cod are cream to light grey on their ventral (&quot;belly&quot;) surfaces. Their back and flanks are most commonly bluish-grey in colour, overlain with irregular black speckling, but this can be highly variable depending on the habitat specimens come from, and can range from almost white to light grey-green, light brown, dark brown or almost black. The black speckling on the back and flanks is consistent however.

The spiny dorsal fin is moderate in height and is partially separated by a notch from the high, rounded soft dorsal fin. Soft dorsal, anal and caudal (tail) fins are all large and rounded, and are light grey to dark grey or black with distinct white edges. The large, rounded pectoral fins are usually similar in colour to flanks. The pelvic fins are large and angular and set forward of the pectoral fins. The leading white-coloured rays on the pelvic fins split into two trailing white filaments, while the pelvic fins themselves are usually a translucent cream or light grey.

Smaller trout cod tend to be more slender than equivalent sized Murray cod; curiously, very large trout cod appear to develop deeper shoulders than equivalent sized Murray cod.

While trout cod were only conclusively described as a separate species to Murray cod in 1972, commercial and recreational fishermen and early fishery biologists were in no doubt that there were two separate species of cod in the Murray-Darling system from the 1850s onwards, and noted the trout cod&#x27;s different appearance and spawning biology and preference for cooler, faster flowing water and upland habitats. During the 19th and early 20th centuries trout cod were recognised by the scientific community as separate species, due to differing habitat preferences, morphological differences (especially the much smaller size at sexual maturity) and differing spawning times. It was really only post World War II — by which time trout cod had become very rare or even extinct in much of their original range — that the erroneous idea that they were really just anomalous Murray cod gained any currency.

==Habitat==

Although there is/was a very substantial overlap in range, trout cod are essentially a more specialised upland sister species to Murray cod. Therefore, the trout cod&#x27;s main habitats were the larger upland rivers and creeks, which they usually co-inhabited with Macquarie perch and one or both of the blackfish species. Historical research is confirming a primarily upland distribution for trout cod; recent governmental literature lacking such historical research and suggesting trout cod are primarily a lowland fish species must be considered inaccurate.

Division into specialist upland and &quot;primarily&quot; lowland species is a relatively common phenomena in native fish genera of the Murray-Darling and East Coast systems with other notable pairs shown in the following table:

Trout cod are often found close to cover and in faster currents and in cooler waters than Murray cod. Their diet is essentially the same as Murray cod with adjustment made for size, eating mainly other fishes, freshwater mussels, crustaceans, aquatic insects, small mammals and water fowl. However, recent anecdotal evidence suggests terrestrial insects made up a significant proportion of the trout cod&#x27;s diet in upland rivers and streams.

In the surviving Murray River population trout cod tend to stick to areas of deep water near banks, around snags, rocks or other large structure. However, historical accounts of trout cod in upland river habitats stated that trout cod were often found in shallow riffles and runs. Generally speaking, radio-tracked trout cod in the surviving Murray River population have small home ranges and may be a species which does not move away from their original base, except during the breeding season when they follow a common trend in Murray-Darling fish of migrating upstream prior to spawning. It seems likely that trout cod follow a similar pattern to Murray cod and return post spawning to their original location.

==Diet==

Trout cod are carnivores and feed on other fish, crustaceans (such as crayfish, yabbies and freshwater shrimp) as well as aquatic and terrestrial insects. Larvae are pelagic fish and eat zooplankton.

==Reproduction==

Trout cod reach sexual maturity at 3 to 5 years (which corresponds to about 35 cm in males and 43 cm in females). Trout cod reach sexual maturity at a smaller size than Murray cod, which is an adaptation to the rocky, low nutrient and often quite small upland habitats trout cod were found in. Spawning of trout cod has never been observed in the wild and is not well understood. It is believed to be essentially the same as Murray cod but occurs about three weeks earlier and at significantly lower temperatures in waters shared by the two species. Trout cod are believed to spawn at temperatures as low as 15 degrees in upland rivers, using rocks as a spawning substrate; these are also clear adaptations to cool, rocky upland river habitats. Significantly, and unlike Murray cod, trout cod will not breed in earthen dam brood ponds; another indication that trout cod are a more specialised upland species than Murray cod. Artificial breeding programs being conducted for the species recovery use hormone injections to induce ovulation in naturally ripe fish in spring. Trout cod will hybridise with Murray cod and so for recovery projects it is important that Murray cod are not stocked into sites where Trout Cod and Murray cod are not already coexisting sympatrically.

==Conservation==

Trout cod were once common and abundant throughout the Murray-Darling Basin but are now listed on the IUCN as endangered due to overfishing, degradation of habitat and the introduction of invasive Trout species. The species is now totally protected. Only one wild, naturally occurring trout cod population remains in the Murray River in a region where the river is basically an extended transition zone from upland river habitat to lowland river habitat.

In more lowland river habitats, river regulation and habitat degradation through activities like de-snagging, and overfishing, are probably the primary causes of decline. Heavy predation by introduced redfin perch, which were present in great numbers in the lowland reaches of the southern MDB for several decades, also played a large role in the decline of native fish in those reaches including trout cod. The possibility that trout cod populations in upland habitats were the ultimate source of trout cod populations in lowland habitats (i.e. source and sink populations) over long time frames (i.e. decades) cannot be discounted however. Historical accounts such as those from J.O.Langtry indicate lowland trout cod populations were secondary populations in secondary habitats, clearly in the minority to more abundant primarily lowland native fish species such as Murray cod, golden perch and silver perch. Therefore, it is doubtful whether strong trout cod populations can ever be established in lowland habitats, and therefore the issue of upland habitats, and the return of some upland habitats in trout-free form, needs to be addressed in trout cod conservation.

Historical evidence indicates trout cod (and Macquarie perch) were abundant in most of the larger upland rivers and streams in the south-east corner of the Murray-Darling river system, and that these upland river habitats were their primary habitats. The extinction of trout cod populations in every one of its upland river habitats is an unresolved issue. Contrary to popular belief, many of these upland rivers still contain significant stretches of unregulated, high quality habitat. While dams, thermal pollution, siltation and other forms of habitat modification and degradation are responsible for the trout cod&#x27;s extinction in many upland river habitats, it is almost certain that the reason for the trout cod&#x27;s extinction in higher quality upland river habitats, that &quot;have not&quot; experienced serious modification and degradation, is the heavy domination of these habitats by introduced trout species, which are aggressive, predatory fish.

Every single larger upland river and stream in south-eastern Australia is dominated by introduced trout species (rainbow trout and brown trout), with many having been continually stocked with introduced trout species for more than a century, and not a single larger upland river or stream in south-eastern Australia has been reserved in a trout-free state for larger upland native fish species. The effects of this course of action by fishery departments has been stark, and catastrophic events such as drought or bushfire, after which introduced trout species were restocked but upland native fish were not restocked, have shifted the balance further. The net result is that a number of upland native fish species including trout cod (and Macquarie perch) have completely died out or nearly so in their upland river habitats in the wild, apparently unable to cope with massive predation on their larvae/juveniles by introduced trout species and unable to cope with massive competition from introduced trout species for food and habitat at all life stages.
&quot;I regret not knowing the name of a man I met at Tom Groggin Station, a Victorian property on the Indi River near Mt Kosciusko, who told me that he worked at Tom Groggin before he enlisted in the army and went to the first World War. He had fished the Indi before he left and it carried a great number of blue nose [trout cod], white eye [Macquarie perch] and greasies [blackfish]. While he was at war, he even dreamt about fishing the Indi. When he came home he returned to his old job at Tom Groggin and announced that before he did any work, he wanted to go fishing. Very quickly he caught a fish about a foot (30cm) in length, the like of which he had never seen before. So intrigued was he by this strange spotted but nicely shaped fish that he immediately took it to the homestead thinking it was something quite unique. At the homestead, he was told it was a brown trout. From that time both the white eye [Macquarie perch] and the blue nose [trout cod] numbers went into decline, while the numbers of brown and rainbow trout increased. To my mind, this man did do something remarkable, he had set a very positive timeframe of a change over of fish species in the Indi River.&quot;

Heads and Tales: Recollections of a Fisheries and Wildlife Officer.
Scientific studies to document and quantify the impacts of introduced trout on trout cod (and Macquarie perch) in upland river habitats, and develop a more scientific approach to trout cod conservation and re-establishment efforts, including in upland river habitats, are desperately needed. Given the strong cultural cringe towards introduced trout in the wider community and the management bias towards introduced trout amongst fishery agencies these studies may be some way off.

Two small populations of trout cod that have shown indications of breeding have been created by hatchery stockings in the lowland reaches of Murrumbidgee River at Gundagai and Narranderra, although it is far from clear whether these populations will be self-sustaining in the long term. Many other stockings of trout cod have failed, which is not surprisingly considering the small number of trout cod fingerlings stocked, and the fact that trout cod were frequently stocked into upland river habitats where introduced trout species were heavily entrenched, and in at least one case, were carried in conjunction with far larger stockings of introduced trout. A semi-natural population exists in a stretch of the very small upland Seven Creeks, which was established by translocations of trout cod (and Macquarie perch) above a set of falls in the 1920s. The Seven Creeks population is not a wholly artificial population, or a wholly unrepresentative habitat, as often claimed, as some of the trout cod translocated came — literally — from the base of the falls.

<text>Animal Planet (stylized in all lowercase since 2018) is an American multinational pay television channel focusing on the animal kingdom owned by the Warner Bros. Discovery Networks unit of Warner Bros. Discovery. First established on June 1, 1996, the channel is primarily devoted to series and documentaries about wild animals and domestic pets.

The channel was originally a joint venture with BBC Worldwide, and primarily focused on nature documentaries surrounding wildlife, targeting a family audience. In 2008, Animal Planet rebranded with a more mature programming direction, with a greater emphasis on aggressive and predatory portrayals of animals, as well as an increase in reality series following personalities involved in animal-related occupations and investigations. Animal Planet rebranded again in October 2018, pivoting away from its more aggressive branding.

, Animal Planet is available to approximately 70,000,000 pay television households in the United States-down from its 2011 peak of 98,000,000 households. Discovery has also established or licensed international versions of the channel in various regions.

==History==
Animal Planet was launched on June 1, 1996; it was created by Discovery Communications in cooperation with BBC Worldwide. On January 1, 1997, Animal Planet&#x27;s distribution grew as a result of Advance Entertainment Corporation selling the satellite transponder slot belonging to the WWOR EMI Service (a national superstation feed of Secaucus, New Jersey/New York City&#x27;s WWOR-TV, that was implemented following the 1989 passage of the Syndication Exclusivity Rights Rule by the Federal Communications Commission) to Discovery Communications, replacing the feed with Animal Planet outright.

In late 2005, as part of a multi-million dollar expansion, the National Aquarium in Baltimore opened an exhibit called &quot;Animal Planet Australia: Wild Extreme&quot;. Animal Planet and the National Aquarium in Baltimore announced a multi-year partnership the year prior, which produced an original orientation film that gives Aquarium visitors background on the Australian area which inspired the new exhibit and a dedicated area inside the expansion where visitors can learn about Animal Planet&#x27;s conservation efforts and other programming. The partnership also allowed the possibility of future productions of television programs about the National Aquarium in Baltimore&#x27;s research and exhibits.
In 2006, BBC Worldwide sold its 20% interest in the flagship Animal Planet U.S. network back to Discovery Communications. The BBC maintained its 50% ownership in Animal Planet&#x27;s European, Asian and Latin American channels, as well as a minority interest in Animal Planet Japan and Animal Planet Canada until November 15, 2010, when BBC Worldwide sold 50% interest in Animal Planet and Liv to Discovery Communications for $156 million. Animal Planet is additionally an associate member of the Caribbean Cable Cooperative.

During the late 2000s, Genius Products announced a U.S. distribution agreement involving Animal Planet and TLC. Jakks Pacific also entered into a licensing agreement to develop Animal Planet-branded pet products.

===2008 rebranding===

On February 3, 2008, amidst declining average viewership, Animal Planet underwent a major revamp in its programming and branding. The new lineup placed a larger focus on series portraying animals as &quot;characters&quot; in their own right, and more &quot;aggressive&quot; and story-based entertainment series targeting mature viewers 13-49 (such as &quot;Escape to Chimp Eden&quot; and the reality documentary series &quot;Whale Wars&quot;), as opposed to traditional nature documentaries and family viewing. The network also adopted a new logo, replacing its previous &quot;elephant and globe&quot; emblem with a stylized wordmark, and the new slogan &quot;Same Planet, Different World&quot;. Network president Marjorie Kaplan explained that Animal Planet had been too &quot;soft&quot; and family-oriented, and that it was aiming to be &quot;more aggressive and tapping into the instinctual nature of compelling animal content.&quot;

In April 2010, Animal Planet introduced a new slogan and marketing campaign, &quot;Surprisingly Human,&quot; as an evolution of the 2008 rebranding. The slogan reflected Animal Planet&#x27;s increasing number of personality-based series following animal-related investigations and occupations, such as &quot;River Monsters&quot;.

In April 2012, Animal Planet&#x27;s entertainment-oriented direction was criticized after it broadcast &quot;&quot;—a fictional documentary suggesting that mermaids were real. Despite its fictitious content, the documentary was widely viewed, and a follow-up entitled &quot;Mermaids: The New Evidence&quot; set an all-time ratings record for the channel.

===2018 rebranding===
On October 15, 2018, Animal Planet unveiled a new logo, featuring a symbol of a jumping elephant resembling the original logo. The new branding symbolizes a new mission of &quot;keeping the childhood joy and wonder of animals alive by bringing people up close in every way.&quot; The new branding coincided with the October 28 premieres of &quot;Crikey! It&#x27;s the Irwins&quot; (a new series following the family of Steve Irwin) and &quot;Amanda to the Rescue&quot;, and the premiere of &quot;Big Cat Stories&quot; the following night.

On January 23, 2019, Animal Planet was launched in France, along with Discovery Turbo, Discovery World and TLC.

==Programming==

Additions to the channel in the late 2000s, such as &quot;Meerkat Manor&quot; and &quot;Orangutan Island&quot;, reflected its shift toward &quot;predation programming&quot; and more immersive storytelling. Animal Planet intended the new direction to help revitalize stagnating ratings, after primetime viewership of the network dropped by 9% in 2007. Animal Planet added pseudo-scientific documentary, reality television, and sitcom shows to its line-up.

Animal Planet is also well known for the &quot;Puppy Bowl&quot;, an annual special featuring puppies at play inside a football-themed setting. The special airs on the afternoon prior to the NFL&#x27;s Super Bowl, and was originally narrated by commentator and NFL Films narrator Harry Kalas before his death.

On October 29, 2022, months after the merger of Discovery, Inc. and WarnerMedia into Warner Bros. Discovery, it was announced that &quot;Pit Bulls &amp; Parolees&quot; would air its final season, while other shows like &quot;Lone Star Law&quot; and &quot;Louisiana Law&quot; moved to Discovery Channel. With the exception of &quot;Puppy Bowl XIX&quot; that aired on the network February 12, 2023, the latest programming moves left Animal Planet to air reruns of the network&#x27;s programming as well as other shows from other Discovery properties pre-WBD merger.

==&quot;Animal Planet Magazine&quot;==
D.C. Thomson &amp; Co. partnered with Discovery to publish &quot;Animal Planet Magazine&quot; in the United Kingdom. The magazine&#x27;s first issue was published on February 16, 2011.

<doc id="406682" wikidata="Q1340523" url="?curid=406682" title="Victory Arch">
<text>The Victory Arch (), officially known as the &quot;Swords of Qādisīyah&quot;, and popularly called the &quot;Hands of Victory&quot; or the &quot;Crossed Swords&quot;, are a pair of triumphal arches in central Baghdad, Iraq. Each arch consists of a pair of outstretched hands holding crossed swords. The two arches mark the two entrances to Grand Festivities Square and the parade ground constructed to commemorate the Iran–Iraq War, started and led by Iraq&#x27;s then-president Saddam Hussein. The arches were opened to the public on 8 August 1989. It is one of Baghdad&#x27;s visitor attractions and near to the Monument to the Unknown Soldier.

==Location==
The two sets of arches mark the entrances to an area known as Zawra Park. In 1986 (two years before the war&#x27;s end) the government of Iraq began the construction of a festival and parade ground in Zawra Park, near the extensive presidential complex in the center of Baghdad. Known as &quot;Grand Festivities Square&quot;, it comprised a large parade ground, an extensive review pavilion and a large reflecting pool. The surrounding grassy areas hosted Iraqis during military parades. Adding to the festive appeal of the grounds were three refreshments booths that sold ice cream, cold beverages, and candy.
Three monuments were constructed to remember Iraq&#x27;s pain and suffering as a consequence of the eight-year war. The Victory Arch was the last of the three structures to be built, and it followed on from the construction of the Monument to the Unknown Soldier, (1982) and Al-Shaheed Monument (1983). The three monuments form a unit.

The official name of the arches, the &quot;Swords of Qādisiyyah&quot;, is an allusion to the Battle of al-Qadisiyyah in 636 CE, when Arab armies defeated the Sasanian Empire and captured their capital of Ctesiphon, where an arch marks the entrance to the ancient imperial palace. Zawra Park was home to the Museum of Gifts to the President and a performing arts center. The museum was located on the ground floor of the grand reviewing pavilion where Saddam was known to review the Republican Guard while firing a weapon in the air. The museum contained ordinary items donated by Iraqis during his rule. Items included cheap plastic ornaments and drawings donated by Iraqi children.
==History==
Iraq&#x27;s leading sculptor, Khaled al-Rahal, won the commission to design and execute the construction of the arches, which were based on a concept sketch made by president Saddam Hussein. The design consists of a pair of massive hands emerging from the ground, each holding a sword. However, al-Rahal died in 1987, before the monument was completed, and another eminent Iraqi sculptor, Mohammed Ghani Hikmat, assumed control of the project. Both sculptors worked in close collaboration with Saddam Hussein.
The monument was built as part of a broader program to beautify the city of Baghdad and to create public works that would help to instil a sense of national pride within the population. Baghdad is now dotted with monuments, including Al-Shaheed Monument and Monument to an Unknown Soldier, and many other statues, fountains and sculptures; all constructed between 1969 and 2003.

The site selected for the monument was where Arabs defeated the Sasanians, a Persian empire, and is generally seen to be the beginning of Islamic domination of the region. On the day the monument was dedicated in 1990, Saddam rode under the arches astride a white horse. It has been suggested that this was an allusion to the slain Shi&#x27;a martyr Husayn ibn Ali, killed in Karbala in 680, whose death caused the rift between Shiite and Sunni Muslims. The monument, although presenting a triumphalist narrative in relation to the Iran-Iraq war, has assumed a broader symbolism and represents those Iraqis who fell in any war throughout the country&#x27;s history.

===Recent developments===
The monument was not destroyed during the Gulf War, though General Norman Schwarzkopf wanted to remove it. The arches remain standing in what is now the International Zone of Baghdad.
In February 2007, it was reported that the new Iraqi government had organized the Committee for Removing Symbols of the Saddam Era and that the Arc of Triumph monument had begun to be dismantled, which drew protests from Iraqi and preservationist groups.

The demolition began on Tuesday, 20 February 2007. At that time, chunks had been cut out of the bronze monument. Numerous Iraqi bystanders and coalition troops were seen taking helmets and bits of the monument away as souvenirs. The decision to remove the monument, made by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, was challenged by US Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, who blocked the demolition on 21 February. The government of Iraq reversed its earlier plans to demolish the monument.

In February 2011, Iraqi authorities began the restoration of the monument as a sign of reconciliation.

==Description==

The monument consists of a pair of outstretched arms which appear to be exploding out of the ground, each holding a sword which meet at a central point. The swords, which are made of stainless steel, are based on the weapons carried by Sa&#x27;d ibn Abi Waqqas, the Arab leader at the Battle of Qadisiyya.

A small flagpole rises from the point where the swords meet, about above the ground. Al-Rahal used photographs and plaster casts of Saddam&#x27;s forearms as a model for the design of the hands. Toward the end of the project, after Ghani had taken over, the sculptor personally took an impression of one of Saddam&#x27;s thumbs, and the resulting fingerprint was added to the mold for one of the arches&#x27; thumbs.

At the time, Iraq did not have a foundry sufficiently large to cast the sculpture, leading to much of it being made abroad. The arches were made by an international consortium led by the German foundry H+H Metallform. The blades of the stainless steel swords weigh 24 tons each. Cast in Iraq, they are partly composed of metal from guns and tanks of Iraqi soldiers killed in the Iran-Iraq war. The hands and arms of the monument are of bronze, cast in the United Kingdom at the Morris Singer foundry. The arms rest on concrete plinths, the form of which make the arms appear to burst up out of the ground. Each plinth holds 2500 helmets (a total of 5,000 helmets) which, Saddam claimed, belonged to Iranian soldiers killed during the war; they are held in nets which allow them to spill onto the ground beneath.

===Physical specifications===
The monument has a number of elements, each made from different construction materials:
; The exploding ground
: Constructed of reinforced concrete, with enemy helmets scattered around
; Forearm and grip
:Cast in bronze, each weighing 20 tons, fixed with a reinforced frame, also 20 tons
; Swords
: The swords have a slight curve, allowing them to meet in the middle, giving the arched shape. They are cast in stainless steel and each sword weighs 24 tons.
; The net
: The net was cast in bronze and each contains 2,500 enemy helmets
;The flag pole
: The flag and pole were made of stainless steel and rise 7 metres above the point where the arched swords meet

The monument has been described as &quot;kitch, totalitarian art.&quot; It was restored in 2011.

==Legacy==
The Victory arch is one of Baghdad&#x27;s most photographed monuments. Visitors who stand in a specific location can be photographed as if their own hands are holding the swords. The hands, which are hollow, present visitors with another photo opportunity- many troops and other coalition visitors have climbed up inside them to look out from the point at which the swords meet the hands, generally to have souvenir pictures taken.

The monument is also featured on the 100 dinar banknote for 1991.

<doc id="406685" wikidata="Q1768167" url="?curid=406685" title="Solomon in Islam">
<text>In Islam, Sulaymān ibn Dāwūd () is described as a &quot;nabī&quot; (, ) and ruler of the Israelites in the Quran. Since the rise of Islam, various Muslim historians have regarded Solomon as one of the greatest rulers in history. Solomon&#x27;s rule inspired several Islamic leaders throughout history.

Solomon is regarded to have been bestowed by God the gift to speak to animals and &quot;djinn&quot;. Furthermore was granted the ability to enslave the devils (; f.v. ) with the help of a staff or ring given by God. Solomon&#x27;s battle with the demons plays an important role in Sufistic interpretations of Islam as the internal struggle of the self against demonic urges.

Generally, Islamic tradition holds that he was the third ruler of the Israelites and a wise one. In contrast to Talmudic tradition, Muslims maintain that Solomon remained a faithful to God throughout his life and was blessed with authority given to none before nor after him. Despite his miraculous abilities, his success stems from solely relying on God, as seen in the challenge of bringing the Throne of Sheba. For that, he was, according to the Quran, promised nearness to God in Jannah (, ) at the end of his life.

== Quran and interpretation ==
=== Judgment on the field ===
In the earliest narrative involving Sulayman, the Quran () briefly alludes to a story that Sulayman was in the company of his father, when two men came to ask David to judge between them regarding a &quot;ḥarth&quot; (, field). Later Muslim commentators expanded on the allusion, including al-Tabari, Baidawi, and Ibn Kathir. They said that the first of the two men said that he owned a vineyard of which he took great care the whole year through. But one day, when he was absent, the other man&#x27;s sheep had strayed into the vineyard and devoured the grapes. He asked to be compensated for this damage. Upon hearing the man&#x27;s complaint, Solomon suggested that the owner of the sheep take the other man&#x27;s vineyard to repair and cultivate until the vines returned to their former state, whereupon he should return it to its owner. At the same time, the owner of the vineyard would care for the sheep and benefit from their wool and milk until his land was returned to him, at which point he would return the sheep to their owner. This response shows Solomon&#x27;s level of judgment, which, the Quran says, would characterize Sulayman throughout his life. &quot;Ḥikmah&quot; (Wisdom), according to Muslim tradition, would always be associated with Solomon, who would later even be referred to as &quot;Sulaymān al-Ḥakīm&quot; (, &quot;Sulayman the Wise&quot;). This story is adapted in the Kebra Nagast, but as a dispute adjudicated by a son of Sulayman.

=== Solomon and the demons ===

The Quran narrates that Solomon, controlled the wind and the jinn. The jinn helped strengthen Solomon&#x27;s reign. God caused a miraculous &quot;ʿayn&quot; (, &#x27;fount&#x27; or &#x27;spring&#x27;) of molten &quot;qiṭr&quot; (, &#x27;brass&#x27; or &#x27;copper&#x27;) to flow for Solomon, used by the jinn in their construction. The devils (&quot;shayatin&quot;) and demons were forced building for him monuments.

When David died, Solomon inherited his position as the prophetic king of the Israelites. Solomon once permitted a woman to build a statue of her father. Later, she began to worship the statue and Solomon was rebuked for tolerating idolatry in his kingdom. As a punishment, God enabled one of the enslaved demons to steal Solomon&#x27;s ring and take over his kingdom (Surah 38:34). He later repents his sin and gains control over the demons again, focusing on building the temple again. He prayed to God to grant him a kingdom which would be unlike any after him. God accepted Solomon&#x27;s prayer and gave him what he pleased

Construed allegorically, Solomon&#x27;s loss of his ring to the demons, may be understood to represent a human losing its soul to demonic passion. Attar of Nishapur writes: &quot;If you bind the &quot;div&quot; (demon), you will set out for the royal pavilion with Solomon&quot; and &quot;You have no command over your self&#x27;s kingdom, for in your case the &quot;div&quot; is in the place of Solomon&quot;.

Unlike the Talmudic tradition, Solomon was unaware and never participated in idolatry. Further, the Quran rejects that Solomon was a magician: &quot;Never did Solomon disbelieve, rather the devils disbelieved. They taught magic to the people...&quot; ()

=== Solomon and the ant ===
Solomon was taught the languages of various animals, such as ants. The Quran recounts that, one day, Solomon and his army entered a &quot;wādin-naml&quot; (, valley of the ant). On seeing Solomon and his army, a &quot;namlah&quot; (, female ant) warned all the others to &quot;get into your habitations, lest Solomon and his hosts crush you (under foot) without knowing it.&quot; Immediately understanding what the ant said, Solomon, as always, prayed to God, thanking him for bestowing upon him such gifts and further avoided trampling over the ant colonies. Solomon&#x27;s wisdom, however, was yet another of the gifts he received from God, and Muslims maintain that Solomon never forgot his daily prayer, which was more important to him than any of his gifts.

Exegetical literature emphasizes the ant&#x27;s wisdom and explains the meaning behind Solomon&#x27;s gift to control the wind. According to the &quot;Siraj al-Qulub&quot;, a popular text with versions in Persian, Oghuz Turkic, and Karluc Turkic, the ant asked Solomon if he knows why he is called &quot;Solomon&quot; (&quot;Süleyman&quot;). Solomon says he does not, whereupon the ant goes on to explain: &quot;Although your heart was sound (&quot;selim&quot;) and you know the circumstances of the next world, you have accepted a few pleasures of this world and have been deceived by its possession and kingship; therefore you are called Solomon.&quot; Afterwards, the ant asks Solomon if he knows why God has subdued the wind for him. Once again, Solomon negates and the ant answers: &quot;He has subdued the wind for a reason: that which you have accepted is nothing. Just as the wind passes, the world&#x27;s wealth and kingship pass too.&quot; Scholars like Fakhr al-Din Razi and al-Qurtubi elevated the ant to the rank of an exemplar for humans to follow.

=== Conquest of Saba&#x27; ===
Another important aspect of Solomon&#x27;s kingship was the size of his army, which consisted of both men and jinn. Solomon would frequently assess his troops and warriors as well as the jinn and all the animals who worked under him. One day, when inspecting his troops, Solomon found the &quot;Hud-hud&quot; (, Hoopoe) missing from the assembly. Soon afterwards, however, the Hud-hud arrived at Solomon&#x27;s court, saying &quot;I have found out something you do not know. I have just come to you from Sheba with sure news.&quot; The Hud-hud further told Solomon that the people of Sheba worshiped the Sun, and that the woman who ruled the kingdom was highly intelligent and powerful. Solomon, who listened closely, chose to write a letter to the land of Sheba, through which he would try to convince the people of Sheba to cease their idolatrous worship of the Sun, and come to the worship of God. Solomon ordered the Hud-hud to give the letter to the Queen of Sheba (Bilqis), and then to hide and observe her reaction. The Hud-hud accepted Solomon&#x27;s orders, and flew straight back to Sheba to deliver the letter to the Queen. The Queen then called her ministers to court and read aloud to them the letter from Solomon stating to the people of Sheba: &quot;In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful, Do not be arrogant with me, but come to me, fully submitting (&quot;Muslimīn&quot; ).&quot; She took counsel with her ministers and other court officials, saying &quot;O chiefs! Advise me in this matter of mine, for I would never make any decision without you.&quot; The people of the court replied: &quot;We are a people of strength and great ˹military˺ might, but the decision is yours, so decide what you will command.&quot; At length, however, the Queen came to Solomon, announcing her submission to God.

=== Solomon and the &quot;ifrit&quot; ===
While Bilqis was journeying to Solomon&#x27;s court, the king bid his servants deliver her throne thither before her arrival. An &quot;ifrit&quot; offered his services (), but Solomon declined, entrusting this task instead to a manservant, named Asif ibn Barkhiya in traditions. Being a pious fellow, the manservant prayed to God to move the throne for him. His prayer was answered, the throne appearing in Solomon&#x27;s palace by the power of God. When Bilqis arrived, Solomon asked her if she recognised her throne. Struggling to grasp the miracle God had wrought, she at first gave the king an evasive answer, but later adopting the faith of Solomon, won over by the evidence that the miracle was not that of a mere Ifrit but that of God himself. Solomon had declined the ifrit&#x27;s tempting offer, because he sought to rely solely upon God and not upon a demon or any other created being, and was rewarded for his piety with success in converting Bilqis to the true faith.

=== Death ===
The Quran relates that Solomon died while he was leaning upon his staff and that he remained standing, propped up by it, until a little creature – ant or worm – gnawed at it, until, finally, it gave way – and only then did his body collapse. 

As he remained upright, propped on his staff, the jinn thought he was still alive and supervising them.

They realized the truth only when God sent a creature to crawl out of the ground and gnaw at Solomon&#x27;s staff, until his body collapsed. This verse is understood to teach the audience that jinn do not know the &quot;unseen&quot; (&quot;Al-Ghaib&quot;) – had they known it, they would not have remained toiling like fools in the service of a dead man.

== In culture ==
=== Solomon and Selcuk leaders ===

The title &quot;“The Sulaymān of the Age&quot; was employed for 
various leaders of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum. Among them Suleiman II of Rûm, Kilij Arslan II, and Suleiman ibn Qutalmish. They were compared to the Quranic prophet due to their governmental body (&quot;Divan&quot;), consisting of people speaking various languages, including Greek, Armenian, Turkish, and later, Mongolian, foreign craftsmen (compared to the jinn at Solomon&#x27;s court), and usage of messenger pigeons.

=== Solomon and Jamshid ===

Jamshid was the fourth king of the world, according to the &quot;Shāhnāma&quot; of the poet Firdausī. Like Solomon, he was believed to have had command over all the angels and demons (&quot;dīv&quot;) of the world, and was both king and high priest of Hormozd (middle Persian for Ahura Mazda). He was responsible for many great inventions that made life more secure for his people: the manufacture of armor and weapons, the weaving and dyeing of clothes of linen, silk and wool, the building of houses of brick, the mining of jewels and precious metals, the making of perfumes and wine, the art of medicine, the navigation of the waters of the world in sailing ships. He Jamshid had now become the greatest monarch the world had ever known. He was endowed with the royal &quot;farr&quot; (Avestan: &quot;khvarena&quot;), a radiant splendor that burned about him by divine favor.

Due to similarities between the two wise monarchs, some traditions conflate the two. For example, Solomon was associated with ruling over the southwestern Iran in the works of al-Balkhi. Persepolis was believed to be the seat of Solomon and described as &quot;playground of Solomon&quot; by scholars such as Mas&#x27;udi, Muqaddasi and Istakhri. Other Muslim authors have opposed the belief that Solomon once ruled in Iran Persia, arguing that any similarities between the lives and deeds of Solomon and Jamshid are purely coincidental, the two being distinct and separate personages. The latter view has been vindicated by scholarship in the field of Indo-European mythology, which has demonstrated conclusively that the character Jamshid derives from the early Zoroastrian deity Yima, whereas Quranic and Biblical scholarship support a measure of historicity for the wise prophet king.

== Mahammaddim in the Song of Solomon ==
As inspired by verses of the Quran, some Muslims believed that Muhammad ( &quot;praiseworthy&quot;, consonant letters: m-ħ-m-d) is mentioned in the Song of Songs (5:16) ( &quot;beloved, desirable, delightful&quot;, consonant letters: m-ħ-m-d-y-m, &quot;maḥămaddim&quot;).

<text>Operator assistance refers to service provided by a telephone operator to the calling party of a telephone call. This can include telephone calls made from pay phones, calls placed &quot;station-to-station&quot;, &quot;person-to-person&quot;, or &quot;collect&quot;, third-number calls, calls billed to credit cards, and certain international calls which cannot be dialed directly. The telephone operator may also be able to assist with determining what kind of technical difficulties are occurring on a phone line, to verify whether a line is busy (&quot;busy line verification&quot;, or &quot;BLV&quot;), or left off the hook, or to break in on a live call to ask the caller to clear the line for an incoming call (&quot;busy line interruption&quot;, or &quot;BLI&quot;). The latter service is often utilized by emergency police. In addition, operators are often a first point of contact for the elderly wanting information on the current date and time.

Before the advent of emergency telephone numbers, operators identified and connected emergency calls to the correct emergency services. Directory assistance was also part of the operator&#x27;s job.

In the early days of telephony all calls were connected by an operator. Later, local calls could typically be dialed directly, but long-distance and international calls had to be connected by an operator, often subject to a minimum charge, typically for three minutes. Eventually it became possible to direct-dial all calls, but operator assistance continued to be available, often at higher cost, for all calls; in the US Bell System an operator-assisted call had a 50% premium for the first three minutes.

A station-to-station call is an operator-assisted call in which the calling party agrees to talk to whoever answers the telephone.

A person-to-person call is an operator-assisted call in which the calling party requires to speak to a specific named party and not simply to anyone who answers. The caller is only charged for the call, which is subject to extra cost than station-to-station, from the moment the requested party is reached, and not charged at all if unreachable. This method was popular when telephone calls were relatively expensive. Since the introduction of direct dial telephone service and the subsequent drop in the price of long distance telephone calls, person-to-person service has virtually disappeared.

A messenger call has been used in countries in which home telephones are unusual, and before the boom in cell phones in the early 21st century. A messenger, usually a boy, would go to the recipient&#x27;s location to advise him or her to come to a central location at a designated time to receive a phone call.

An operator-assisted conference call is one in which the conference call is managed by an operator. The telephone operator will greet each call participant, gather specific information from each participant, introduce key speakers, and manage questions and answers, all from the telephone.

A third number call or third party call is an operator assisted telephone call that can be billed to the party other than the calling and called party. The operator calls the third number for the party to accept the charges before the call can proceed.

Time and charges was a service that could be requested of an operator before a call began. After completion of the call, the operator called back and stated the duration of the call (in minutes) and the charge. It was sometimes used by guests to reimburse hosts for use of their telephone, and was almost always required by hotel switchboard operators to charge room guests for calls they made—modern telephone systems do this automatically.

<doc id="406689" wikidata="Q786848" url="?curid=406689" title="Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone">
<text>The Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone is an American twin-row, supercharged, air-cooled, radial aircraft engine with 18 cylinders displacing nearly . Power ranged from , depending on model. Developed before World War II, the R-3350&#x27;s design required a long time to mature, and was still experiencing problems with reliability when used to power the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. 

After the war, the engine had matured sufficiently to be used in many civilian airliners, notably in its turbo-compound forms, and was used in the Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation airliners into the 1950s. Its main rival was the , Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major, which first ran some seven years after the Duplex-Cyclone. The engine is commonly used on Hawker Sea Fury and Grumman F8F Bearcat Unlimited Class Racers at the Reno Air Races.

==Design and development==

In 1927, Wright Aeronautical introduced its &quot;Cyclone&quot; engine, which powered a number of designs in the 1930s. After merging with Curtiss to become Curtiss-Wright in 1929, an effort was started to design an engine in the class. The new Wright R-1820 Cyclone 9 first ran in 1935, and became one of the most used aircraft engines in the late 1930s and early 1940&#x27;s, powering the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bomber, General Motors FM-2 Wildcat fighter and Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bomber, among many others.

By 1931 Pratt &amp; Whitney had started a development of their single-row Wasp nine-cylinder engine into the larger and much more powerful fourteen-cylinder, twin-row R-1830 Twin Wasp with a similar displacement that would easily compete with the single-row Cyclone. In 1935 Wright followed P&amp;W&#x27;s lead, and developed larger engines based on the Cyclone. The result was two designs, a 14-cylinder short stroke design of nearly displacement that would evolve into the Wright R-2600 Twin Cyclone, and a much larger 18-cylinder design that became the R-3350. A larger twin-row 22-cylinder version, the Wright R-4090 Cyclone 22, was experimented with as a competitor to the displacement four-row, 28-cylinder Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major, but was not produced.

With Pratt &amp; Whitney starting development of their own displacement 18-cylinder, twin-row radial as the R-2800 Double Wasp in 1937, Wright&#x27;s first R-3350 prototype engines with a displacement were run in May of the same year. Development was slow, due to the complexity, and the R-2600 receiving development priority. The R-3350 did not fly until 1941, after the Douglas XB-19 had been redesigned to use R-3350s instead of Allison V-3420 inlines.

Things changed dramatically in 1940 with the introduction of a new contract by the USAAC to develop a long-range bomber capable of flying from the US to Germany with of bombs. Although smaller than the Bomber D designs that led to the Douglas XB-19, the new designs required just as much power. When four preliminary designs were presented in mid-1940, three of them used the R-3350. Suddenly development was a priority, and serious efforts to get it into production began. In 1942 Chrysler started building the Dodge Chicago Plant, which was ready by early 1944.

By 1943 the new Boeing B-29 Superfortress was flying with R-3350s. The engines remained temperamental, and the rear cylinders tended to overheat, partially due to inadequate clearance between the cylinder baffles and the cowl. A number of changes were introduced to improve cooling, and the aircraft was rushed into service in the Pacific in 1944. This proved unwise, as the early B-29s taking off at maximum weights, in the high temperature conditions of the B-29s tropical airfields, caused overheating that was not completely solved, and the engines also had a tendency to swallow valves. Because of a high magnesium content in the crankcase, engine fires could burn with a core temperature approaching which could burn through the main spar in seconds, causing a catastrophic failure.

Early R-3350s used carburetors, though the poorly designed elbow entrance to the supercharger led to serious problems with fuel/air mixtures. Near the end of WWII, the system was changed to use gasoline direct injection which improved reliability. After the war the engine was redesigned and became popular for large aircraft, notably the Lockheed Constellation and Douglas DC-7.

Following the war, the Turbo-Compound system was developed to deliver better fuel efficiency. In these versions, three power-recovery turbines (PRT) were inserted into the exhaust of each group of six cylinders, and geared to the crankshaft by fluid couplings to deliver more power. The PRTs recovered about 20% of the exhaust energy (around ) that would have otherwise been lost, but reduced engine reliability. Mechanics nicknamed them Parts Recovery Turbines, since the increased exhaust heat meant a return to the engine destroying exhaust valves. The fuel burn for the PRT-equipped aircraft was nearly the same as the older Pratt and Whitney R-2800, while producing more useful power. Effective 15 October 1957 a DA-3/DA-4 engine cost $88,200.

By this point reliability had improved with the mean time between overhauls at 3,500 hours and specific fuel consumption in the order of 0.4 lb/hp/hour (243 g/kWh, giving a 34% fuel efficiency). Engines in use as of the 2020s are limited to manifold pressure, giving with 100/130 octane fuel (or 100LL) instead of the and possible with 115/145, a higher octane fuel, which is no longer available.

Several racers at the Reno Air Races use R-3350s. Modifications on one, &quot;Rare Bear&quot;, include a nose case designed for a slow-turning prop, taken from an R-3350 used on the Lockheed L-1649 Starliner, mated to the power section (crankcase, crank, pistons, and cylinders) taken from an R-3350 used on the Douglas DC-7. The supercharger is taken from an R-3350 used on the Lockheed EC-121 and the engine is fitted with nitrous oxide injection. Normal rated power of the original stock R-3350 was at 2,600 rpm and of manifold pressure. With these modifications, &quot;Rare Bear&quot;″s engine produces at 3,200 rpm and of manifold pressure, and with nitrous oxide injection.

<doc id="406698" wikidata="Q259844" url="?curid=406698" title="Collect call">
<text>A collect call in Canada and the United States, known as a reverse charge call in other parts of the English-speaking world, is a telephone call in which the calling party wants to place a call at the called party&#x27;s expense.

Collect calls were originally only possible as an operator-assisted call, but with the introduction of computer-based telephone dialing equipment, it became possible to place a collect call without using an operator. Automated reverse charge dialing eliminated a service that could be provided, at a higher fee, only on operator-assisted connections: the person-to-person call, in which there is no charge unless a designated person is available.

In the US, while Mother&#x27;s Day is the holiday with the highest number of phone calls, the day with the most collect calls is Father&#x27;s Day.

==Services==

===Australia===
Australian telecom companies provide reverse charge services with the number 12550. However, in the case of prepaid phones, this service is accessible only when a caller has sufficient credit to call 12550.

Several companies previously provided reverse call services in Australia, including 1800MUMDAD, 1800Reverse and 1800PhoneHome. In 2019, major telecommunication providers Optus and Telstra ceased billing services on behalf of third party content providers, causing these services to close.

Telstra ran a reverse charge service called HomeLink during the 1990s and 2000s. Homelink consisted of an 1800 number and PIN that could only be linked to the user&#x27;s home phone service. Calls were billed at a slightly higher cost than a standard local call. HomeLink grew out of popularity with the rise in mobile phones.

=== Brazil ===
In Brazil, reverse calls are available for every land or mobile line call. All local reverse calls must be started by dialing 9090 and the desired phone number. If the user is not in the same zone as the recipient the calls must be started by dialing 90 + carrier code + area code + the desired phone number.

=== France ===
In France, the service was called PCV (per ce voir). France Telecom discontinued the collect call on 1. August 2014.

=== Germany ===
On 31. December 2020, Deutsche Telekom discontinued the option to make collect calls. 

=== India ===
There is not a simple way to make a reverse charge call for free in India. In early 2019 a private tech company launched services to enable a person to make an overseas reverse charge call. AT&amp;T also provides a number to make collect calls from India to the United States. The number is 000–117.

===Ireland===
A collect call service operates under 800 Reverse (operated by Reverse Corp Ltd), in Ireland. It offers reverse charge calls from any fixed line phone, pay phone and most mobile phones (even if the prepaid credit has run out), to most fixed land line and mobile phones in Ireland. The company charges €2.99 to connect the call, including the first 60 seconds of the call, and €0.593 for every subsequent minute.

Eircom offered national and international reverse charge calling services until 24 February 2009. Prior to the cessation of services, national reverse charge service could be obtained by dialing the operator on 10 or, from payphones via 1 800 28 28 28 and international reverse charge services could be reached via the international operator on 114 or 1800 457 457 from payphones.

===Kenya===
Landline operator Telkom provides reverse charge services. A customer who needed the service had to call customer care and then request for reverse call. If the other person accepted, the call would then be connected and charged on his or her bill.
In June 2019, the largest mobile service provider Safaricom started rolling out reverse call services to all its customers. To access the service, a customer has to dial # before dialing the desired number. The caller&#x27;s details would appear on the recipient&#x27;s screen as usual, but when the recipient answers the phone, a voice notice would informed them that the call is a reverse call. The recipient could then choose to accept the charges for the call by pressing 1 on the dial pad. Safaricom said that the cost of reverse calls is the same as the cost of normal calls.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, a number of services offer reverse charge calling. A caller can dial the operator on 155 and request a reverse charge call. Before these services were discontinued, 08000MUMDAD, 08000686323, 0800 Reverse also provided reverse charge calls. Reverse charge calls can be made for free on some mobile networks, although the person being contacted via this service may be charged a considerable amount for accepting such a call.

Freefone numbers indicated that a business agreed to automatically accept reverse charge calls to that number.

===United States and Canada===
Verizon discontinued collect calls on its landlines in 2016. AT&amp;T similarly discontinued its collect call services for the United States. 1-800-COLLECT remains operational.

Prior to the introduction of the toll-free 800 area code in 1967, a Zenith number (in the U.S. and Canada) or an enterprise number (in the U.S. only) would indicate to an operator that the business agreed to automatically accept collect calls to that number.

== In popular culture ==
The movie &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; contains a scene in which a character attempts to place a collect call to the President of the United States after finding he does not have enough change on hand for the payphone.

In season 6, episode 16 of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Bart Simpson damages Australia–United States relations in a series of escalating events beginning with an $900 international collect call.

&quot;The Fluffy Movie&quot; features material about collect calls, their antiquity, and the familial politics of placing a collect call.

In the video game &quot;Darkest Dungeon&quot;, the Collector&#x27;s ability to summon his minions, &quot;Collect Call,&quot; is a pun-based reference to collect calling.

In the 1960&#x27;s movie &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot;, Roger Corneal (Henry Silva) is asked to &quot;reverse a call&quot; after he asks a shopkeeper to make a long-distance call to check on Tony Bergdorf (Richard Conte) in order to recruit him for the heist.

<text>A telephone call or telephone conversation (or telcon), also known as a phone call or voice call (or simply a call), is a connection over a telephone network between the called party and the calling party. Telephone calls started in the late 19th century, initially relying on analog systems. As technology advanced, the majority of telephone calls moved from traditional landlines to cellular networks and mobile phones. Telephone calls have also become common over the internet, using Voice over IP (VoIP) technology. They are typically used for real-time conversation between two or more parties, especially when the parties cannot meet in person.

A telephone call historically was between two live people. It has progressed to also include a live person and a recorded message, or a live person with an AI generated message. The term &quot;call&quot; is now broadly used for other connections over a network when you are using your voice to communicate (as opposed to typing text), including audio calls and video calls.

==First telephone call==
The first telephone call was made on March 10, 1876, by Alexander Graham Bell. Bell demonstrated his ability to &quot;talk with electricity&quot; by transmitting a call to his assistant, Thomas Watson. The first words transmitted were &quot;Mr Watson, come here. I want to see you.&quot;
This event has been called Bell&#x27;s &quot;greatest success&quot;, as it demonstrated the first successful use of the telephone. However he refused to have a telephone in his own home because it was something he invented by mistake and saw it as a distraction from his main studies.

==Information transmission==
A telephone call may carry ordinary voice transmission using a telephone, data transmission when the calling party and called party are using modems, or facsimile transmission when they are using fax machines. The call may use land line, mobile phone, satellite phone or any combination thereof. When a telephone call has more than one called party it is referred to as a conference call. When two or more users of the network are sharing the same physical line, it is called a party line or Rural phone line.

If the caller&#x27;s wired phone is connected directly to the calling party, when the caller takes their telephone off-hook, the calling party&#x27;s phone will ring. This is called a [hot line] or [ringdown]. Otherwise, the calling party is usually given a tone to indicate they should begin dialing the desired number. In some (now very rare) cases, if the calling party cannot dial calls directly, they will be connected to an operator who places the call for them.

Calls may be placed through a public network (such as the Public Switched Telephone Network) provided by a commercial telephone company or a private network called a [Private branch exchange|PBX]. In most cases a private network is connected to the public network in order to allow PBX users to dial the outside world. Incoming calls to a private network arrive at the PBX in two ways: either directly to a users phone using a DDI number or indirectly via a receptionist who will answer the call first and then manually put the caller through to the desired user on the PBX. 

Most telephone calls through the PSTN are set up using ISUP signalling messages or one of its variants between telephone exchanges to establish the end to end connection. Calls through PBX networks are set up using QSIG, DPNSS or variants.

==Costs==
Some types of calls are not charged, such as local calls (and internal calls) dialed directly by a telephone subscriber in Canada, the United States, Hong Kong, United Kingdom, Ireland or New Zealand (Residential subscribers only). In most other areas, all telephone calls are charged a fee for the connection. Fees depend on the provider of the service, the type of service being used (a call placed from a landline or wired telephone will have one rate, and a call placed from a mobile telephone will have a different rate) and the distance between the calling and the called parties. In most circumstances, the calling party pays this fee. However, in some circumstances such as a reverse charge or collect call, the called party pays the cost of the call. In some circumstances, the caller pays a flat rate charge for the telephone connection and does not pay any additional charge for all calls made. Telecommunication liberalization has been established in several countries to allow customers to keep their local phone provider and use an alternate provider for a certain call in order to save money.

==Placing a call==
A typical phone call using a traditional phone is placed by picking the phone handset up off the base. The caller then rotary dials or presses buttons for the phone number needed to complete the call, and the call is routed to the phone which has that number. The second phone makes a ringing noise to alert its owner. The first user can hold the handset so that the hearing end is next to their ear and the speaking end is within range of their mouth. They then hear a ringing noise in the earpiece. If the second phone is picked up, then the two users can talk to one another. If the phone is not picked up, the first user continues to hear a ringing noise until they hang up their own phone.

In addition to the traditional method of placing a telephone call, new technologies allow different methods for initiating a telephone call, such as voice dialing. Voice over IP technology allows calls to be made through a PC, using a service like Skype. Other services, such as toll-free dial-around, enable callers to initiate a telephone call through a third party without exchanging phone numbers. Originally, no phone calls could be made without first talking to the Switchboard operator. However for many years an operator has not been needed to complete most phone calls.

The use of headsets is becoming more common for placing or receiving a call. Headsets can either come with a cord or be wireless.

A special number can be dialed for operator assistance, which may be different for local vs. long-distance or international calls.

=== Details of operation ===

The landline telephone contains a switchhook (A4) and an alerting device, usually a ringer (A7), that remains connected to the phone line whenever the phone is &quot;on hook&quot; (i.e. the switch (A4) is open), and other components which are connected when the phone is &quot;off hook&quot;. The off-hook components include a transmitter (microphone, A2), a receiver (speaker, A1), and other circuits for dialing, filtering (A3), and amplification.

To place a telephone call, the calling party picks up the telephone&#x27;s handset, thereby operating a lever that closes the hook switch (A4). This powers the telephone by connecting the transmission hybrid transformer, as well as the transmitter (microphone) and receiver (speaker) to the line. In this off-hook state, the telephone circuitry has a low resistance of typically less than 300 ohms, which causes the flow of direct current (DC) in the line (C) from the telephone exchange. The exchange detects this current, attaches a digit receiver circuit to the line, and sends dial tone to indicate its readiness. On a modern push-button telephone, the caller then presses the number keys to send the telephone number of the destination, the called party. The keys control a tone generator circuit (not shown) that sends DTMF tones to the exchange. A rotary-dial telephone uses pulse dialing (A5), sending electrical pulses, that the exchange counts to decode each digit of the telephone number. If the called party&#x27;s line is available, the terminating exchange applies an intermittent alternating current (AC) ringing signal of 40 to 90 volts to alert the called party of the incoming call. If the called party&#x27;s line is in use, however, the exchange returns a busy signal to the calling party. If the called party&#x27;s line is in use but subscribes to call waiting service, the exchange sends an intermittent audible tone to the called party to indicate another call.

The electromechanical ringer of a telephone (A7) is connected to the line through a capacitor (A6), which blocks direct current and passes the alternating current of the ringing power. The telephone draws no current when it is on hook, while a DC voltage is continually applied to the line. Exchange circuitry (D2) can send an alternating current down the line to activate the ringer and announce an incoming call. In manual service exchange areas, before dial service was installed, telephones had hand-cranked magneto generators to generate a ringing voltage back to the exchange or any other telephone on the same line. When a landline telephone is inactive (on hook), the circuitry at the telephone exchange detects the absence of direct current to indicate that the line is not in use. When a party initiates a call to this line, the exchange sends the ringing signal. When the called party picks up the handset, they actuate a double-circuit switchhook (not shown) which may simultaneously disconnect the alerting device and connect the audio circuitry to the line. This, in turn, draws direct current through the line, confirming that the called phone is now active. The exchange circuitry turns off the ring signal, and both telephones are now active and connected through the exchange. The parties may now converse as long as both phones remain off hook. When a party hangs up, placing the handset back on the cradle or hook, direct current ceases in that line, signaling the exchange to disconnect the call.

Calls to parties beyond the local exchange are carried over trunk lines which establish connections between exchanges. In modern telephone networks, fiber-optic cable and digital technology are often employed in such connections. Satellite technology may be used for communication over very long distances.

In most landline telephones, the transmitter and receiver (microphone and speaker) are located in the handset, although in a speakerphone these components may be located in the base or in a separate enclosure. Powered by the line, the microphone (A2) produces a modulated electric current which varies its frequency and amplitude in response to the sound waves arriving at its diaphragm. The resulting current is transmitted along the telephone line to the local exchange then on to the other phone (via the local exchange or via a larger network), where it passes through the coil of the receiver (A3). The varying current in the coil produces a corresponding movement of the receiver&#x27;s diaphragm, reproducing the original sound waves present at the transmitter.

Along with the microphone and speaker, additional circuitry is incorporated to prevent the incoming speaker signal and the outgoing microphone signal from interfering with each other. This is accomplished through a hybrid coil (A3). The incoming audio signal passes through a resistor (A8) and the primary winding of the coil (A3) which passes it to the speaker (A1). Since the current path A8 – A3 has a far lower impedance than the microphone (A2), virtually all of the incoming signal passes through it and bypasses the microphone.

At the same time the DC voltage across the line causes a DC current which is split between the resistor-coil (A8-A3) branch and the microphone-coil (A2-A3) branch. The DC current through the resistor-coil branch has no effect on the incoming audio signal. But the DC current passing through the microphone is turned into AC (in response to voice sounds) which then passes through only the upper branch of the coil&#x27;s (A3) primary winding, which has far fewer turns than the lower primary winding. This causes a small portion of the microphone output to be fed back to the speaker, while the rest of the AC goes out through the phone line.

A lineman&#x27;s handset is a telephone designed for testing the telephone network and may be attached directly to aerial lines and other infrastructure components.

==Tones==
Preceding, during, and after a traditional telephone call is placed, certain tones signify the progress and status of the telephone call:
* a dial tone signifying that the system is ready to accept a telephone number and connect the call
* either:
** a ringing tone signifying that the called party has yet to answer the telephone
** a busy signal (or engaged tone) signifying that the called party&#x27;s telephone is being used in a telephone call to another person (or is &quot;off the hook&quot; though no number has been dialled, i.e. the customer does not want to be disturbed)
** a fast busy signal (also called reorder tone or overflow busy tone) signifying that there is congestion in the telephone network, or possibly that the calling subscriber has delayed too long in dialling all the necessary digits. The fast busy signal is generally twice as fast as the normal busy signal.
* status tones such as STD notification tones (to inform the caller that the telephone call is being trunk dialled at a greater cost to the calling party), minute minder beeps (to inform the caller of the relative duration of the telephone call on calls that are charged on a time basis), and others
* a tone (sometimes the busy signal, often the dial tone) to signify that the called party has hung up.
* tones used by earlier inband telephone switching systems were simulated by a Red box or a blue box used by &quot;phone phreaks&quot; to illegally make or receive free trunk/toll calls.
* off-hook tone if the phone has been picked up but no number dialed for an extended period of time.
Cell phones generally do not use dial tones, because the technology used to transmit the dialed number is different from a landline.

==Unwanted calls==
Unsolicited telephone calls are a modern nuisance. Common kinds of unwanted calls include prank calls, telemarketing calls, and obscene phone calls.

Caller ID provides some protection against unwanted calls, but can still be turned off by the calling party. Even where end-user Caller ID is not available, calls are still logged, both in billing records at the originating telco and via automatic number identification, so the perpetrator&#x27;s phone number can still be discovered in many cases. However, this does not provide complete protection: harassers can use payphones, in some cases, automatic number identification itself can be spoofed or blocked, and mobile telephone abusers can (at some cost) use &quot;throwaway&quot; phones or SIMs.

The movie is set and was made at the time of Hong Kong&#x27;s handover to the People&#x27;s Republic of China on June 30, 1997. The film credits Paul Theroux as a source for the story, based on themes he explores in his 1997 novel &quot;Kowloon Tong&quot;. The film enjoyed modest box office success in the United States.

== Plot ==
The movie unfolds at least nine different stories on very different levels.

First, there is John as a reporter, trying to capture interesting scenes on the streets of Hong Kong, persuading himself his work gives his life a tangible meaning.

Second, there is Vivian who is looking to find a balance in life, trying to escape from the underground she once was a part of and forget about her past, but is hindered in her attempts by prejudices that go back thousands of years in the Chinese society (including Hong Kong).

Third, there is Vivian (still), with a chance to discard most of her problems by simply marrying John and moving to England with him. Even though she is tempted to do so, she knows this would just be running away from the core of the problem and could not be a long-term solution, mostly because of their different cultural backgrounds and maybe even because of a subtle uncertainty regarding John&#x27;s ex-wife and former life.

Fourth, there is Jean, with her own story and with a typical Hong Kong here-today-who-knows-where-tomorrow attitude - living the moment, enjoying and suffering at the same time, embodying a perfect reflection of modern life, especially so easily seen in Hong Kong in the late 1990s. She understands all of the different kinds of hardships that come in life and, with her face somewhat disfigured, is marked more intensely than most, but also knows where to draw the line in selling herself. John tries to help her, but does that in a dishonest way, which disappoints her tremendously. According to a note in film&#x27;s credits, Jean&#x27;s story was inspired by a short story by the American-British author Rachel Ingalls.

Fifth, there are John and Jim. Close, mutually understanding, with enough humor and sarcasm to keep them going through both the good and the bad days. Even though their outlooks towards life differ significantly, their love for the job (journalism) creates a strong bond of true friendship.

Sixth, there is Chang, a man of power, of high position, but a wimp in his heart. His immense wealth cannot replace what he lacks in personality. He has no charisma, no morality, no care, and exists purely on his imaginary throne of pretentiousness and status. While he is ashamed of Vivian, he does love her, but in a pathetic, cowardly way. He is very much into &#x27;saving face&#x27; and can not find an equilibrium in his life (professional nor personal). He agrees to marry Vivian, but deceives her by arranging merely a mock wedding photo session, so she could have some pictures to send to her family. Vivian burns all of the photos and accepts the notion she will never be happy nor free.

Seventh, there are John and Vivian. A story of true love that just isn&#x27;t meant to be. Not because they wouldn&#x27;t want it to, but because of the constraints of the societies they live in.

Eighth, there is John (again), perplexed with his own mortality, which he is suddenly forced to face.

Ninth, there is the political aspect of Hong Kong politically becoming a part of China again, which (at the time) was a great uncertainty.

==Filming locations==
The movie shows the actual temporary press room which was specially set up for the press coverage of the handover, and located in the old part of the Convention and Exhibition Centre.

Certain scenes were shot at the Main Bar of the Foreign Correspondents&#x27; Club.

<text>Edward Sidney Devereaux (27 August 192517 December 2003), better known professionally as Ed Devereaux, was an Australian actor, director, and scriptwriter who lived in the United Kingdom for many years. He was best known for playing the part of Matt Hammond the head ranger in the Australian television series &quot;Skippy the Bush Kangaroo&quot;. He was also involved in the series behind the scenes, Devereaux writing the script and directing the episode &quot;The Veteran&quot; (1969), for which he received much critical acclaim. Devereaux based the story of the episode &quot;Double Trouble&quot; on an idea conceived by his children, wrote the screenplay of &quot;Summer Storm&quot; and the script for &quot;The Mine&quot;. He also played the part of Joe in the Australian 1966 film &quot;They’re a Weird Mob&quot;. The film was a local success.

==Biography==
Devereaux had been a boy soprano, teenage soldier in the New Guinea campaign during the Second World War, cabbie, storeman and truck driver before moving to the UK in 1950.

Devereaux appeared as Mr. Gubbins in the 1963 British comedy film &quot;Ladies Who Do&quot; and in several &quot;Carry On&quot; films including &quot;Carry On Sergeant&quot;, &quot;Carry On Nurse&quot;, &quot;Carry On Regardless&quot; and &quot;Carry On Jack&quot;.

He also appeared as Thomas Macaulay in series five of &quot;The Onedin Line&quot;, as Lord Beaverbrook in both &quot;Edward &amp; Mrs. Simpson&quot; and &quot;The Life and Times of David Lloyd George&quot;, and as Mac in the British comedy series &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; and in &quot;The Professionals&quot; (episode &quot;Runner&quot;) and &quot;The Sweeney&quot; (&quot;Jackpot&quot;). In 1964 he appeared in &quot;The Saint&quot; episode &quot;The Loving Brothers&quot;. In 1970 he played the villain in &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; episode &quot;Anyone Can Play&quot;.

Australian TV roles included the title role of Jack Meredith in &quot;My Brother Jack&quot; (ABC-TV, 1965), and George King in &quot;Kings&quot; (1983). He also received critical acclaim, including the AACTA Award for Best Lead Actor in a Television Drama, for his role as Australian Prime Minister Ben Chifley, in the ABC TV mini series &quot;The True Believers&quot; (1988).

==Personal life ==

Devereaux&#x27;s first wife was Rene (Irene) Champion. Together they had four children: John (b. 1954), Steven (b. 1955), Timothy (b. 1956) and Matthew (b. 1962). Champion wrote the song for the &quot;Skippy&quot; spin-off film &quot;The Intruders&quot; in 1969. The couple had experienced a marital separation sometime before their 1986 divorce, when Devereaux married his second wife, Julie.

==Death ==
Three months after he was diagnosed with cancer of the oesophagus, Devereaux died in his sleep of kidney failure at his Hampstead home on 17 December 2003 at the age of 78. He had insisted on being released from Royal Free Hospital to be at home with wife Julie. He was cremated at the Golders Green Crematorium, where his ashes remain.

<text>The calling party (in some contexts called the &quot;A-Number&quot;) is a person who (or device that) initiates a telephone call. The person who, or device that, receives a telephone call is the called party (or callee or B-party).

In some countries, it is common etiquette for a call originator to identify himself first instead of the receiver, when the connection is established. 

Modems and fax machines use different tones when originating or answering a connection, which may be a source of problems for the user.

<text>The called party (in some contexts called the &quot;B-Number&quot;) is a person who (or device that) answers a telephone call. The person who (or device that) initiates a telephone call is the calling party.

In some situations, the called party may number more than one. Such an instance is known as a conference call. In some systems, only one called party is contacted at each event. To initiate a conference call the calling party contacts the first called party, then this person contacts the second called party, but audio is transferred to both called parties.

While a calling party will typically pay the fee for making a call, in a collect call (also known as a reverse charge call), it is instead the called party that pays the fee for the call. The called party also pays if the number dialed is a toll-free telephone number.

In some countries such as Canada, the United States and China, users of mobile phones pay for the &quot;airtime&quot; to receive calls. In most other countries (e.g. most European countries), the elevated interconnect fees are paid fully by the calling party and the called party incurs no charge.

<doc id="406719" wikidata="Q1144201" url="?curid=406719" title="Collect">
<text>The collect ( ) is a short general prayer of a particular structure used in Christian liturgy.

Collects come up in the liturgies of Catholic, Anglican, or Lutheran churches, among others.

==Etymology==

The word is first seen as Latin &quot;collēcta&quot;, the term used in Rome in the 5th century and the 10th, although in the Tridentine version of the Roman Missal the more generic term &quot;oratio&quot; (prayer) was used instead.

The Latin word &quot;collēcta&quot; meant the gathering of people together (from &quot;colligō&quot;, &quot;to gather&quot;) and may have been applied to this prayer as said before the procession to the church in which Mass was celebrated. It may also have been used to mean a prayer that collected into one the prayers of the individual members of the congregation.

==Structure==

A collect generally has five parts:
*Invocation or address: indicating the person of Trinity addressed, usually God the Father, rarely God the Son
*Acknowledgement: description of a divine attribute that relates to the petition (often &quot;qui ...&quot; - who ... )
*Petition: &quot;for one thing only and that in the tersest language&quot;
*Aspiration:
**The desired result (begins with the word &quot;ut&quot; - in order that)
**Indication of a further purpose of the petition
*Pleading:
**Conclusion indicating the mediation of Jesus Christ. 
**Response by the people: Amen

In some contemporary liturgical texts, this structure has been obscured by sentence constructions that depart from the straightforwardness of a single sentence.

==Variations==

===Australian Catholicism===

Initially, only one collect was said at Mass, but the Tridentine version of the Roman Missal allowed and often prescribed the use of more than one collect, all but the first being recited under a single conclusion. This custom, which began north of the Alps, had reached Rome by about the 12th century.

In the 1973 translation of the Roman Missal by the ICEL, the word &quot;collecta&quot; was rendered as &quot;Opening Prayer&quot;. This was a misnomer, since the collect ends—rather than opens—the introductory rites of the Mass. This prayer is said immediately before the Epistle.

===Anglicanism===
The collects in the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; are mainly translations by Thomas Cranmer (d. 1556) from the Latin prayers for each Sunday of the year. At Morning Prayer, the &quot;Collect of the Day&quot; is followed by a &quot;Collect for Peace&quot; and a &quot;Collect for Grace&quot;. At Evening Prayer the &quot;Collect of the Day&quot; is followed by a &quot;Collect for Peace&quot; which differs from the version used at Morning Prayer, and a &quot;Collect for Aid against Perils&quot;, which starts with the well known phrase; &quot;Lighten our darkness, we beseech thee, O Lord; and by thy great mercy defend us from all perils and dangers of this night...&quot;.

At Holy Communion, the &quot;Collect of the Day&quot; is followed by a reading from the Epistles. In more modern Anglican versions of the Communion service, such as &quot;Common Worship&quot; used in the Church of England or the 1979 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; used in the Episcopal Church in the United States, the &quot;Collect of the Day&quot; follows the &quot;Gloria&quot; and precedes readings from the Bible.

===Lutheranism===
Similarly, Lutheran liturgies typically retain traditional collects for each Sunday of the liturgical year. In the &quot;Evangelical Lutheran Worship&quot; hymnal of the ELCA, however, the set of prayers has been expanded to incorporate different Sunday collects for each year of the lectionary cycle, so that the prayers more closely coordinate with the lectionary scripture readings for the day. To achieve this expansion from one year&#x27;s worth of Sunday collects to three years&#x27;, modern prayer texts have been added.

===French Protestantism===
The Huguenots used collects derived from the Psalms and published in the Psalter in 1563.

===Scottish Presbyterianism===
The &quot;Oraisons&quot; of the French Psalter were translated by and published in the Scottish Metrical Psalter in 1595. Over time the use of written prayers fell out of favor in the Church of Scotland.

<text>Norfolk County ( ) is a rural single-tier municipality on the north shore of Lake Erie in Southwestern Ontario, Canada with a 2023 population of 73,015. Despite its name, it is no longer a county by definition, as all municipal services are handled by a single level of government. The largest community in Norfolk County is Simcoe, whose 2021 population was 16,121. The other population centres are Port Dover, Delhi, Waterford and Port Rowan, and there are many smaller communities. For several years in the late 20th century, the county was merged with Haldimand County but the merged entity was dissolved in 2000.

==Geography==
Located on the Norfolk Sand Plain in the Carolinian Life Zone, Norfolk County&#x27;s soil type is sandy loam, the most fertile land in Ontario. With a mild climate and lengthy growing season, the region has long been the centre of the Ontario tobacco belt. However, many farmers have begun the process of diversifying their crop selections to include fruits and vegetables, lavender, ginseng, hazelnuts, and wolfberries as tobacco consumption continues to decrease.

A significant natural feature of Norfolk is Long Point, a 40 kilometre (25 mi) spit of land projecting into Lake Erie. It plays an important part in eastern North American bird migration, and was designated a World Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 1986. Both the Long Point National Wildlife Area and the Long Point Provincial Park are located on the point. More than 25% of Norfolk County is considered to be forested; especially near the major communities and hamlets that dot the county.

The county seat and largest community is Simcoe. Other population centres are Port Dover, Delhi and Waterford.

==History==
===Prehistory===
The area of modern-day Norfolk County was a focus for the Princess Point culture ( AD – 1000 AD) late in its development. Early Princess Point activity was clustered around the marshy peninsula of Princess Point near Hamilton. The Princess Point people likely were the first to introduce maize agriculture to Ontario, gradually migrating westward toward the Grand River and its fertile floodplains as they did so. This migration continued southward toward Norfolk County, whose better-drained sandy soil was more suitable for maize-growing.

===Initial European settlement===
By 1669, the French explorers De Galinee and Dollier de Casson had reached what is now Port Dover. They erected a cross with the arms of France claiming sovereignty for King Louis XIV over the Lake Erie region on March 23, 1670. A history of the area written in 1898 indicates an even earlier visit to what is now Norfolk County, in October 1626, by a Recollet priest, Laroche-Daillon with two Frenchmen Grenolle and La Vallee. The priest spent three months with the Neutrals First Nation. The same account also indicates that two Jesuits, Breboeuf and Chaurnonot, visited the Neutrals in this area in 1640.

The first European to live in the area, with the Neutrals, was William (Billy) Smith, son of Abraham Smith. He eventually settled near the current Port Rowan in 1793. This was in the first community, the Long Point Settlement (near what is now Port Rowan), where mills were built by United Empire Loyalist settlers. In the subsequent years, sawmills and grist mills were opened and the population increased. After the town site was surveyed in the late 1700s, the area was called Charlotte Villa and was later renamed Charlotteville.

===19th Century===
Norfolk County was originally created in July 1792 as a constituency for the purposes of returning a member to the new Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada, and was described as having the following territory:

Norfolk County was reduced in size in 1798, with parts going to the counties of Oxford, Middlesex and Haldimand, and became part of the London District. It consisted of the following townships:

*Charlotteville
*Houghton
*Middleton
*Rainham
*Townsend
*Walpole
*Walsingham
*Windham
*Woodhouse
In 1826, the townships of Rainham and Walpole were moved to Haldimand County in Niagara District because of their distance from the London courthouse.

The community that is now Simcoe was first settled when Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe gave land to Aaron Culver in 1795 on the agreement that he would build mills. After they were in operation, a hamlet formed by 1812, although it was burned down by American troops in 1814. Between 1819 and 1823 Culver laid out a village; streets were surveyed in 1835 to 1836 or 1837. The settlement initially consisted of two distinct areas, Birdtown, named by William Bird who arrived in the early 1800s and the Queensway which grew up around Culver&#x27;s sawmill and grist mill in the 1820s. The post office opened in 1829 and was called Simcoe.

The County had an important role during the War of 1812. Fort Norfolk was built in Charlotteville (near Vittoria and Normandale) in 1813 with accommodation for 300 troops. The Battle of Nanticoke, against American troops, was an important event in 1813. In August 1812, Major General Isaac Brock gathered a force of about regulars and militia at Port Dover. Using boats on the lake, they reached Amherstburg (also in Upper Canada) and then attacked and captured the American Hull&#x27;s Army at Detroit. The Americans forces later burned Port Dover. The Americans forces also burnt Port Dover, Port Ryerse and the Walsingham settlement in 1814.

In 1837, Norfolk County was separated from the London District to form Talbot District, and Simcoe was declared to be the district town. At the beginning of 1850, the district was abolished, being replaced by Norfolk County for municipal purposes.

Because the county was heavily forested, logging became a major industry between 1860 and 1880. Agriculture was even more important however, with wheat being the primary crop until 1880 and then corn and oats.

The South Norfolk Railway was started in the county and began operating in 1889. Even earlier, the Hamilton and Lake Erie Railway (H&amp;LER) began operating in 1873 but was merged with the Hamilton and North-Western Railway which completed the final section to Port Dover and to Jarvis in the mid 1870s.

====Historic townships====
Townships of Norfolk County in 1798:

*Charlotteville
*Houghton
*Middleton
*Rainham
*Townsend
*Walpole
*Walsingham
*Windham
*Woodhouse

In 1826, the townships of Rainham and Walpole were moved to Haldimand County in Niagara District because of their distance from the London courthouse. Walsingham was originally one township, but had been split into North and South Walsingham in 1881.

Prior to its amalgamation with Haldimand in 1974, Norfolk consisted of eight townships. Although no longer political entities, they are still geographic townships that figure in the legal description of lands for surveying purposes, and their areas are still shown on maps for convenience.

===20th Century===
By the early 1900s, orchards and canning crops were more typical. A major switch to tobacco began in 1920.

By the 1920s tourism was an important contributor to the economy. Summer resorts in Port Dover, Port Ryerse, Normandale, &quot;Fisher&#x27;s Glen&quot;, Turkey Point and Port Rowan were attracting many summer visitors. However, Norfolk was primarily agricultural with fruit and vegetables the primary crops. On report from 1924 states that &quot;Norfolk apples have become pre-eminent in two hemispheres&quot;; thousands of barrels of apples were shipped each year and canning was also a major industry, with companies such as Dominion Canners and St. Williams Fruit Preservers. There were a few factories too, in Port Dover and Waterford, while Port Dover was a major fishing centre, with fish shipped not only within Canada but also to the U.S.

A report from 1924 also discusses an electric railway that had been introduced &quot;in recent years&quot;. This was the Grand River Railway that connected Hespeler, Berlin (later called Kitchener) and Waterloo with connection to Brantford and Port Dover:

===Norfolk Township===

In 1974, the townships of Houghton, North Walsingham, South Walsingham, part of Middleton and the village of Port Rowan amalgamated to form the township of Norfolk. This was on the advice of a report by Milt Farrow, a &quot;special advisor&quot; appointed by the Government of Ontario. This political unit existed from 1974 to 2000.

On January 1, 2001, Norfolk amalgamated with Delhi, Simcoe and part of Nanticoke to form an enlarged Norfolk. This municipality immediately changed its official name to Norfolk County—and special advisor Milt Farrow later said in published interviews that he should have recommended those names. Since they no longer have townships or other municipal subdivisions below them, both municipalities are not true &quot;county&quot; governments in the traditional sense; they are legally classified as cities.

===Norfolk becomes larger===
The Townships of Delhi and Norfolk, the Town of Simcoe, and the western half of the City of Nanticoke were amalgamated to form the &quot;Town of Norfolk&quot;. Moreover, many smaller communities such as Port Dover and Port Rowan are now in &quot;Norfolk County&quot;. The newly formed municipality&#x27;s first by-law was to change the name to Norfolk County.

In January 2005, the county unveiled a new coat of arms which included natural symbols associated with the county: hooded warblers, a tulip tree (&quot;Liriodendron tulipifera&quot;) and an eastern dogwood flower.

The first mayor of the county, Rita Kalmbach, was succeeded in 2007 by Dennis Travale, who served two terms as mayor. Charlie Luke succeeded him and served one term as mayor.

The Donnybrook Fair in Walsh is an annual two-day event. The fair has been held every year from 1857 until the present, making 2007 the 150th Fair. This mid-September event involves the children of Walsh Public School and St. Michael&#x27;s School entering projects and many agricultural commodities, grown locally, for prize money and ribbons. More than $1200 was paid to the elementary children in 2006. The fair has grown every year with the help of many volunteers. Fundraising events are held all year to finance the fair. These events include an annual barbecue dance, a Victoria Day brunch, food booths at every &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; event in Port Dover, and numerous raffles. The most popular event at each fair is the demolition derby. These were sponsored for a long time by the Horsepower Unlimited Car Club from Simcoe but are now sponsored by the Vittoria &amp; St. Williams Fire Department Auxiliaries. 2007 was considered to be the 34th consecutive year of the demolition derbies.

Throughout the year, the fairgrounds and the Community Centre Hall are frequently used for weddings, funerals, and buck and doe events. The name &quot;Donnybrook Fair&quot; comes from an early settler of Walsh, who said the fair reminded him of an annual horse fair in Donnybrook, Dublin, Ireland.

The aim of this tour was to be an economic stimulus for small towns in various parts of the world, where their festival stopovers occurred. The band encouraged festival goers to spend their money locally at each stopover. Simcoe and Norfolk were no different, where the tour was estimated to attract as much as $10 million in tourism revenues.

<text>A toll-free telephone number or freephone number is one number that is billed for all arriving calls. For the calling party, a call to a toll-free number from a landline is free of charge. A toll-free number is identified by a dialing prefix similar to an area code. The specific service access varies by country.

== History ==
The features of toll-free services have evolved as telephone networks have evolved from electro-mechanical call switching to computerized stored program controlled networks.

Originally, before the automatic system was developed, a call billed to the called party had to be placed through a telephone company operator as a collect call, often long-distance. The operator had to secure acceptance of the charges at the remote number, or even transfer that decision to a long-distance operator, before manually completing the call.

Some large businesses and government offices received large numbers of collect calls, which proved time-consuming for operators and the callers.

===Manual toll-free systems===
Prior to the development of customer-dialed toll-free service many telephone companies provided the service by operator assistance for telephone subscribers without dial telephones (&quot;manual service&quot;).

Operator-assisted toll-free calling included the Zenith number service introduced in the 1930s in the U.S. and Canada, as well as the manual &#x27;Freephone&#x27; service introduced by the British Post Office in 1960.

Both systems were similar in concept. The calling party would ring the operator (now &#x27;100&#x27; in the UK, &#x27;0&#x27; in Canada/U.S.) and ask for a specific free number. In the U.S., the caller would ask for a number like &quot;Zenith 12345&quot; (some areas used &quot;Enterprise&quot; or &quot;WX&quot; instead of &quot;Zenith&quot;). In the UK, the caller would ask the operator to ring &quot;Freephone&quot; and a name or number (such as &quot;Freephone Crimebusters&quot; to pass on tips about a crime to the constabulary).

In either case, the operator would look up the corresponding geographic number from a list and place the call with charges reversed.

A Zenith number was typically available from a predefined area, anything from a few nearby cities to a province or state, and was listed in local directories in each community from which the subscriber was willing to accept the charges for inbound calls.

Until the introduction of InWATS toll-free service by the Bell System on May 2, 1967 and the Linkline (later &quot;Freefone&quot;) 0800 services by British Telecom on 12 November 1985, manually ringing the operator was the standard means to place a toll-free call. More than a few established manual &quot;Freephone&quot; or &quot;Zenith&quot; numbers remained in use for many years after competing automated systems (0800 in UK, 1800 in U.S.) were deployed in parallel for new toll-free numbers.

===Initial direct-dial systems===

An automated toll-free service was introduced by AT&amp;T in 1966 (US intrastate) and 1967 (US interstate) as an alternative to operator-assisted collect calling and manual &quot;Zenith&quot; or &quot;Enterprise&quot; numbers. This Inward Wide Area Telephone Service (InWATS) allowed calls to be made directly from anywhere in a predefined area by dialling the prefix 1800- and a seven-digit number.

The system initially provided no support for Automatic Number Identification and no itemised record of calls, instead requiring subscribers to obtain expensive fixed-rate lines which included some number of hours of inbound calling from a &quot;band&quot; of one or several U.S. states or Canadian provinces. Early InWATS 800 calling lacked the complex routing features offered with modern toll-free service. After competitive carriers were allowed to compete with AT&amp;T in establishing toll-free service, the three digit exchange following the 800 prefix was linked to a specific destination carrier and area code; the number itself corresponded to specific telephone switching offices and trunk groups. All calls went to one central destination; there was no means to place a toll-free call to another country.

Despite its limitations (and the relatively high cost of long distance in that era), the system was adequate for the needs of large volume users such as hotel chains, airlines and rental car firms which used it to build a truly national presence.

For small regional businesses who received few long-distance calls, the original InWATS was prohibitively expensive. As a fixed-rate bulk service requiring special trunks, it was suited only to large volume users.

===Modern direct-dial systems===
Modern toll-free service became possible when telephone companies replaced their electro-mechanical switching systems with computerized switching systems. This allowed toll-free calls to be routed based on instructions located in central databases.

In the United States, AT&amp;T engineer Roy P. Weber from Bridgewater, New Jersey patented a &#x27;Data Base Communication Call Processing Method&#x27; which was deployed by AT&amp;T in 1982. The called number was an index into a database, allowing a &#x27;Toll-Free Call&#x27; or &#x27;800 Call&#x27; to be directed anywhere. This feature and other advances that made it possible were what led to AT&amp;T marketing analyst Dodge Cepeda from Bedminster, New Jersey to propose the introduction of providing 800 Toll-Free Service to small and medium-size business customers on a nationwide basis. Once this service was implemented, it became possible for the very smallest of business operations to have potential customers contact them free of charge at a time when long-distance calling was expensive. Until this time, 800 Service was only available to major Fortune 500 companies.

In the United Kingdom, BT introduced &quot;Linkline&quot; on 12 November 1985. No more need to manually ring the operator, two new prefixes 0800 (an automated toll-free service which became &quot;Freefone&quot;) and 0345 (a shared-cost service marketed as &quot;Lo-Call&quot; because initially its rates resembled those of local calls) could be reached by direct dial. Cable and Wireless used 0500 and 0645, in much the same way, just a few years later.

==Vanity numbering==

A toll-free vanity number, custom toll-free number, or mnemonic is easy to remember; it spells and means something or it contains an easily recognized numeric pattern. An easily remembered number is valued as a branding and direct response tool in business advertising.

In the United States, Federal Communications Commission regulations mandate that numbers be allocated on a first come, first served basis; this gives vanity number operators who register as RespOrgs a strong advantage in obtaining the most valuable phonewords, as they have first access to newly disconnected numbers and to newly introduced toll-free area codes. In Australia, premium numbers, such as the 13-series or the vanity phone words, are distributed by auction separately from the administrative procedure to assign random, generic numbers from the available pool.

===Shared use===
In toll-free telephony, a shared-use number is a vanity number (usually a valuable generic phone word), which is rented to multiple local companies in the same line of business in different cities. These appear in Australia (1300 and 1800) and North America (1800, etc.); in the U.S., the RespOrg infrastructure is used to direct calls for the same number to different vendors based on the area code of the calling number.

As one example, a taxi company could rent shared use of 1800TAXICAB in one city. The number belongs to a company in Van Nuys, California, but is redirected to local cab companies on a city-by-city basis and promoted by being printed on everything from individual taxi cab hub caps to campaigns against drunk driving. Another example is Mark Russell&#x27;s 1800GREATRATE, a shared-use number rented to lenders in various cities nationwide for a monthly fee.

One former Mercedes dealer obtained 1800MERCEDES, charging other dealers to receive calls to that number from their local areas. The automaker unsuccessfully sued MBZ Communications of Owatonna, Minnesota, operated by former Mercedes dealer Donald Bloom, alleging deception and trademark infringement. Mercedes was ultimately forced to obtain a different number, 1-800-FOR-MERCEDES.

A company renting 1800REDCROSS at a premium price to individual local Red Cross chapters as &quot;shared use&quot; was less fortunate; the Federal Communications Commission reassigned that number to the American Red Cross as an emergency response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

Shared use can be used as a means to circumvent FCC regulations against &quot;warehousing, hoarding and brokering&quot; toll-free numbers as technically the number is not being sold, only rented one city or region at a time. The practice is nonetheless potentially problematic as it leaves local businesses advertising numbers which they do not own and for which they therefore have no number portability. The cost per minute and per month is typically far higher for a shared-use number than for a standard toll-free vanity number which a local business controls outright, and there is little protection if the shared use company fails to meet its obligations or ceases operation.

There are also technical limitations; voice over IP users in particular are difficult to geolocate as their calls may be gated to the public switched telephone network at a point hundreds or thousands of miles away from their actual location. A roaming mobile or Internet telephone user is effectively (like the user of a foreign exchange line) attached to a distant rate centre far from their physical address.

If a program like Crime Stoppers is inherently regional or local, but its national 1800222TIPS number is shared between multiple exchanges, the exchange accepting the call must determine whether the call belongs to some other region.

==International implementations==

The implementation of toll-free calling by assigning special telephone numbers for charging a destination party is implemented in many countries by various dialing prefixes in the local number plan.
* In Argentina, the prefix for toll-free numbers is &quot;0800&quot;, followed by seven digits (the first three of them are fixed for each operator, so the user may know which carrier is serving the party they are calling). These numbers are called &quot;0800&quot; &quot;(cero ochocientos)&quot; or &quot;líneas gratuitas&quot; (free lines). There is also a local-rate service named &quot;0-810&quot; (cero ochocientos diez) where the calling party pays the fee for a local call and the called party pays for the long-distance fees.
* In Armenia, the toll-free prefix is &quot;800&quot; followed by a five-digit number.
* In Australia, the toll-free prefix is &quot;1800&quot; followed by a six-digit number. Calls are free from any landline and generally free from mobiles, although some mobile providers may charge their own fee. A fixed-cost fee (usually the cost of a local call) is payable by the caller to &quot;1300&quot; and &quot;13&quot; prefix numbers (followed by six and four digits respectively).
* In Austria, the prefix for toll-free numbers is also &quot;0800&quot;, but only followed by six digits. They are commonly referred to as &quot;null-achthunderter Nummern&quot; (zero-eight hundred numbers).
* In Azerbaijan, the prefix for toll -free numbers is 088, followed with seven digits. Toll Free calls are available both from mobile and landline phone operators.
* In Belgium, the prefix &quot;0800&quot; is used for toll-free numbers, followed by 5 digits. They are commonly referred to as &quot;nul-achthonderd nummers&quot; (zero-eight hundred numbers) in Dutch, &quot;numéros verts&quot; (green numbers) in French or &quot;null-achthunderter Nummern&quot; (zero-eight hundred numbers) in the German speaking area.
* In Brazil, the toll-free prefix is &quot;0800&quot;. Although regular landline numbers in Brazil are 8 digits long, the toll-free prefix is usually followed by 7 digits, with 6 digits formerly common. Toll-free numbers in Brazil can be accessed from any telephone (by default) within the country, with many exceptions. They can only be accessed from outside Brazil by using a calling service (such as voice-over-Internet services or MCI Worldcom calling service) that accesses numbers from within the called country. Many toll-free numbers are not available from cell phones (usually blocked by the cell phone provider rather than by the provider of the toll-free number, in an effort to prevent low-price competition from calling card providers). Some toll-free numbers are not available from phones listed by the owner of the number, including many payphones. There is no special name for the service and when such a number is advertised, there is usually a remark that the call is free.
* In Bulgaria, the toll-free prefix is &quot;0800&quot; followed by a five-digit number (up to now, only 1XXXX and 20ххх numbers have been allocated). These numbers are called &quot;Зелен номер&quot; (green number) by Vivacom and &quot;Зелена линия&quot; (green line) by A1.
* In Canada, toll-free numbers are drawn from the US SMS/800 database. A seven-digit number 310-xxxx (a true toll-free, can be called from anywhere in its home area code at local rates from certain, but not all, carriers) is available in Bell Canada and Telus territories. From a landline, these are free. From cell phones, airtime is not covered, but there are no long-distance charges.
* In Chile, the toll-free prefix is &quot;800&quot; followed by a six-digit number. These numbers are called &quot;número 800&quot; (800 number). These numbers cannot be accessed from abroad.
* In Colombia, toll-free numbers start with &quot;018000&quot;.
* In Croatia, the prefix for toll-free numbers is &quot;0800&quot;.
* In the Czech Republic, the toll-free prefix is &quot;800&quot;.
* In Denmark telephone-numbers have eight digits. The toll-free numbers all begin with &quot;80&quot; followed by six further digits.
* The Dominican Republic is assigned specific 1800 exchanges in the North American Numbering Plan; the 1-809-200-xxxx exchange is also free for domestic callers in that country.
* In Egypt, it starts with &quot;0800&quot; followed by a seven-digit number. Unavailable via cellphones.
* In Ecuador, it starts with &quot;1800&quot; followed by a 6-digit number. Some numbers have either regional or nationwide access. Calls from cellphones are only allowed by the operator &quot;Alegro&quot; which charges a few cents for these calls. PORTA and Movistar do not allow the service.
* In France the &quot;0800&quot; to &quot;0805&quot; prefixes are used for toll-free numbers. They are also known as &quot;numéros verts&quot; (green numbers).
* In Finland, the toll-free prefix is &quot;0800&quot;.
* In Germany, the toll-free prefix is &quot;&#x27;0800&quot; followed by a seven-digit number. The &quot;0801&quot; prefix is already reserved for future use. The prefix used to be &quot;0130&quot;. Deutsche Telekom calls these numbers &quot;freecall 0800&quot;, most Germans refer to it simply as &quot;null-achthunderter Nummern&quot; (zero-eight hundred numbers).
* In Georgia, the prefix for toll-free numbers is 0800 followed with six digits. Toll-free calls are available both from mobile and landline phone operators. 
* In Greece, the toll-free prefix is &quot;800&quot; followed by a seven-digit number or &quot;807&quot; followed by a four-digit number, used for phone card services only.
* In Hong Kong, toll-free numbers have the &quot;800&quot; prefix.
* In Hungary, toll-free numbers have the &quot;80&quot; prefix.
* In Iceland, the toll-free prefix is &quot;800&quot;, followed by a four-digit number.
* In India, the toll-free prefix is &quot;1800&quot;, followed by a six or seven digit number. They are free of charge if called from a mobile phone or a land line. The &quot;1860&quot; prefix followed by seven digits is used for local-rate numbers. The calling party pays the local rate and the called party pays long-distance call charges (if any).
* In Indonesia, the toll-free prefix is &quot;0800-1&quot;, followed by a six-digit number.
* In Ireland, 1800- numbers are freephones, with the 1800 71xxxx reserved for services that expect unusually high volumes of calls (e.g. radio station phone-in lines).
* In Israel, toll-free numbers are prefixed with &quot;1800&quot; followed by 6 digits (for local businesses); &quot;180&quot; or &quot;189&quot; followed by 7 digits usually refers to a free call to an overseas-operated calling center. The called party pays the charges for the call. As of 2012, calls from local cellular phone service providers to these prefixes are also free. Numbers prefixed with &quot;1700&quot; followed by 6 digits are local-rate numbers for the first 3–4 minutes, after which the charges for the remaining duration of the call are transferred to the receiving party (on a &quot;shared cost&quot; basis).
* In Italy, toll-free numbers are dialed with the &quot;800&quot; or &quot;803&quot; prefix and are commonly referred to as &quot;numero verde&quot; (green number) or &quot;linea verde&quot; (green line). The &quot;numeri verdi&quot; used to begin with &quot;1678&quot; and later with &quot;167&quot;.

* In Japan, the prefixes &quot;0120&quot; and &quot;0800&quot; are officially assigned for toll-free numbers and are often referred to as or telephone numbers. These numbers are owned by NTT Communications (NTT Com). Several telephone carriers also provide toll-free services under their own company prefixes such as &quot;0077&quot; (these prefixes are also used for other toll services; the prefix &quot;0570&quot; is officially assigned for Navi Dial, a special toll service also operated by NTT Com).
* In South Korea, toll-free numbers are prefixed with &quot;080&quot; (not to be confused with &quot;060&quot; or &quot;070&quot;, which are used for pay-per-call/pay-per-minute information services or digital home phone services). Not all numbers with the &quot;080&quot; prefix are toll-free when called from a mobile phone.
* In Latvia the prefix 8000-xx-xx is used for toll-free services. They are toll-free only when dialed from landlines, and charged the same as a land line when dialed from cell phones.
* In Malaysia the prefix is 1800. Free if calling from a land-line and VoIP only. Calling from mobile phone will be considered a local call, with varying charges depending on the mobile network providers.
* In Mexico the prefix is 800.
* In Nepal the prefix is 1660.
* In New Zealand, both &quot;0800&quot; or &quot;0508&quot; prefixes are referred to variously and interchangeably as &quot;free phone&quot; or &quot;toll-free&quot;. Originally these &quot;Oh-eight-hundred&quot; numbers were provided by Spark New Zealand and &quot;0508&quot; by rival company Clear (now One New Zealand), although now both numbers can be provided by either company. Some older toll bar services designed to restrict toll calls (including long distance or calls to mobile phones) will also block calls to these free phone numbers, although this has become less common since the mid-1990s. A limited number of companies utilizing toll-free numbers will not accept calls from mobile phones. Some other free phone services exist, such as &quot;*555&quot; (&quot;star five five five&quot;), which can be dialled from cellular phones to report traffic conditions and incidents of dangerous driving.
* In the Netherlands, the prefix &quot;0800&quot; is used for toll-free numbers. Calling 0800-numbers from fixed and mobile phones is free by law. UIFN&#x27;s &quot;00800&quot; are generally free from fixed lines and charged for the airtime from mobile phones. UIFN access is not enforced by law, causing certain phone providers not to honor the standard.
* In Norway most telephone-numbers have eight digits (with some exceptions). Toll-free numbers all begin with &quot;800&quot;, followed by five further digits.
* In Pakistan, toll-free numbers have the format &quot;0800-xxxxx&quot;.
* In Paraguay, the prefix &quot;0800&quot; is used for toll-free numbers, followed by 6 digits.
* In the Philippines, the prefix for toll-free numbers is &quot;1800&quot; followed by either one, two, or four digits (examples include 8, 10, and 1888), and then by either a four- or seven-digit phone number. However, there are restrictions. Toll-free numbers are limited to the telephone network where the toll-free number is being handled. So, subscribers of a different telephone network company will not be able to call a toll-free number handled by a different telephone network. International toll-free numbers can only be accessed if the calling party is a PLDT subscriber.
* In Poland, toll-free numbers have the format &quot;800 xxx xxx&quot;. There are also split-charge numbers in the format &quot;801 uxx xxx&quot; (caller&#x27;s cost depends on the digit u) and &quot;universal numbers&quot; in the format &quot;804 uxx xxx&quot;, where the caller is automatically connected to the nearest office (these numbers are toll-free if u=3).
* In Portugal, the prefix is &quot;800&quot; so the 9-digit number is &quot;800 xxx xxx&quot;. It is referred as &quot;chamada gratuita&quot; (free call) or as &quot;número verde&quot; (green number).
* In Qatar, toll-free numbers have the format &quot;800&#x27; xxxx&quot;.
* In Romania, toll-free numbers have the format &quot;0800 xxx xxx&quot;. The service is referred to as &quot;număr verde&quot;.
* In Russia, the prefix is &quot;8-800&quot;, followed by 7 digits (8-800-XXX-XX-XX).
* In Serbia, the prefix &quot;0-800&quot;, followed by a 6 or 7 digit number, is used.
* In Singapore, the prefix &quot;1800&quot; followed by a 7 digit number is used. Calling from a mobile phone network will be considered a local call and charges vary among service providers.
* In Slovakia, the toll-free prefix is &quot;0800&quot;, followed by six digits. The local rate prefix is &quot;0850&quot;.
* In Slovenia, the prefix &quot;080&quot; is used for toll-free numbers, followed by four more digits.
* In South Africa, the prefix &quot;080&quot;, followed by 7 digits is used. It is referred to as a &quot;toll-free&quot; or &quot;080&quot; number (Afrikaans: &quot;tol-vrye&quot;).
* In Spain, the &quot;900XXXXXX&quot; or &quot;800XXXXXX&quot; numbers are always toll-free (800 numbers are not usually used), &quot;909XXXXXX&quot; is used for dial-up Internet service and toll-free dialup Internet service (under subscription). Also &quot;1002&quot;, &quot;1004&quot;, &quot;14XX&quot;, &quot;15XX&quot; and &quot;16XX&quot; are free and are used for the telecommunication providers call centers.
* In Sweden, the prefix is &quot;020&quot; or &quot;0200&quot; for toll-free numbers. (Additionally, 0800 is reserved for future use.) These numbers are unreachable from other countries.
* In Switzerland, the toll-free prefix is &quot;0800&quot;; it used to be &quot;155&quot;. These numbers are called &quot;grüne Nummer&quot; (German) / &quot;numéro vert&quot; (French) / &quot;numero verde&quot; (Italian), all meaning &quot;green number&quot;.
* In Taiwan, the toll-free prefix is 0800-xxx-xxx or 0809-xxx-xxx, but not all Taiwanese mobile numbers can call toll free numbers. A toll-free subscriber can decide to restrict a number due to high per-minute mobile rates. This is cumbersome for the caller, who is told to dial another landline number, usually at the highest toll rate within the country as a mobile to landline call. Some small VOIP operators also cannot call toll free numbers. For example, 0701-xxx-xxx cannot call toll free numbers directly, but can call through a live operator by dialling &quot;123&quot; and have them redirect the call.
* In Thailand, for the Call Free, Free Call, Toll-Free, or Free Phone service, the format used is &quot;1800-xxxxxx&quot;. Calls are free for all fixed line calls. Mobile carriers AIS and CAT (60+%o f Thailand&#x27;s subscribers) offer 1-800 service for cell phones. DTAC and True mobile providers currently do not, but it is expected they will offer the 1-800 service for subscribers by late 2009.
* In Turkey, the prefix for toll-free numbers is &quot;0800&quot;.
* In the United Kingdom, modern freephone numbers start with 0800 or 0808, followed by a further 7 digits. Some older 0800 numbers still in use have a shorter number length. The former 0500 freephone number range was withdrawn on 5 June 2017.
* In Ukraine, toll-free numbers have the &quot;0800&quot; prefix, followed by 2 digits for the carrier code, then 4 digits for the client number - i.e., 0 800 YYXXXX. Before October 2009, the &quot;8800&quot; prefix was used.
* In Vietnam, the prefix &quot;1800&quot; followed by a series of numbers, usually from 4 to 9 digits. All &quot;1800&quot; numbers are free of charge, but some of them cannot be dialled from all telephones.
* In Kosovo, the toll-free prefix is &quot;0800&quot; followed by 5 digits.

===Australia===
====Toll-free====
* Toll-free numbers in Australia are ten-digit numbers beginning with the prefix &quot;1800&quot;.
* 1800 numbers can also be found in Phonewords via an online auction.
* For all types, the recipient business pays for incoming toll charges, either per call or at flat rates.
* In some cases, 1800 numbers can be accessed from international lines.
* Callers to an 1800 number are not charged a connection fee from a domestic fixed line. Calls from a mobile phone may incur charges depending on the provider.
* The original prefix was 008. Such numbers were nine digits long. For example, the Crime Stoppers toll-free hotline was 008 333 000, sometimes (misleadingly) written as (008) 33 3000. Such numbers could be dialled from outside Australia, for example +61 08 333 0000

====Local Rate numbers====
A system similar to 1800 numbering exists where 6 or 10 digit numbers prefixed with 13 (one-three), 1300 or 1301 (colloquially one-three-hundred) can be called at local call rates regardless of the caller&#x27;s location.
* Callers to a 13 number are charged a &quot;connection fee&quot; by their telephone provider.
* 13 and 1300 numbers are often &quot;smart routed&quot; to the local outlet of chain stores or fast food premises. They may also be used by different companies in different regions.
* 13 numbers, 1300 numbers and 1800 numbers are relocatable across Australia, and can be transferred between different telecommunications suppliers.
* 13 numbers are a premium number scheme, subject to charges from the Australian Communications &amp; Media Authority (ACMA) of approximately $10,000 per annum collected by the supplying carrier.
* Premium numbers, such as those that spell a word using keypad letters, are regularly auctioned by the ACMA.

====Mobile telephones====
* Mobile callers are charged to phone a 1300 number or 1800 number, usually at their normal per minute rate, but sometimes at predatory rates. These expensive numbers can be decoded to ordinary landline and organisations usually offer a landline number on their websites, though it may be hard to find.
* Smart routed 1800 or 13(00) numbers are sometimes not available from mobile phones as owners of the numbers may bar incoming calls from mobile devices due to higher call charges associated with such calls.

===Canada===
In addition to NANP toll-free numbers, carriers Bell Canada and Telus offer 310- numbers that can be accessed at local-call prices as shared-cost service (free from landlines, incurs local airtime charge from mobiles and local price from payphones). There are a few special mobile-only numbers (like *CAA to call the Canadian Automobile Association) which are free from cell phones, these are actually vertical service codes.

===China===
* Calling an 800-number is free of charge. Calling a 400-number incurs a local access charge.
* 800-numbers are accessible only to land-line subscribers, while 400-numbers are accessible to all land-line and mobile users.

====800-toll-free numbers====
800 toll-free numbers are commonly called &quot;800 免费电话&quot;. The official name is &quot;被叫集中付费业务&quot; (called party collect paid service), which means the cost of the call is borne not by the caller but by the party receiving the call.
* 800-toll-free numbers in China are ten-digit numbers beginning with &quot;800&quot;. There is no prefix before &quot;800&quot;.
* 800-toll-free numbers are not accessible to mobile network subscribers and some land-line subscribers. For instance China Tietong Telecom land-line users cannot access 800 numbers.

====400-toll-free numbers====
* 400-service is called &quot;主被叫分摊付费业务&quot; (calling party and called party split-paid service), which means the calling party pays for the local access fee and the called party pays the toll (long distance) fee.
* 400-toll-free numbers in China are ten-digit numbers beginning with &quot;400&quot;.
* 400-toll-free numbers can be accessed by all fixed-line and mobile phones.
* Callers have to bear local access charges from their service providers.
* 400-toll-free numbers with prefix &quot;4001&quot; are international toll-free numbers which can be routed to destination numbers inside or outside China. 400 toll-free numbers with prefix &quot;4000&quot;, &quot;4006&quot;, &quot;4007&quot; or &quot;4008&quot; are national toll-free numbers which can be routed to China destination numbers only.

===Netherlands===
The introduction of 0800/0900 numbers in the Netherlands in 1986 has led to significant growth of call centres and an increase in outsourcing.

Originally, free telephone numbers in the Netherlands started with either the 06-0, 06-4 or 06-3000 prefix. Most 0800-numbers cannot be called from abroad, and only few can be called from the Caribbean Netherlands (by dialing 0031800). 088-numbers are shared-cost; from landlines, the caller pays only the costs for a local call, whereas the receiver pays the rest.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, toll-free telephone numbers are generally known as &quot;freephone&quot; numbers (British Telecom numbers use the previously trademarked term &quot;Freefone&quot;) and begin with the prefixes 0800 or 0808. The most commonly used prefix is 0800, first used in November 1985. Additionally, numbers in the range are reserved for not-for-profit helplines, through a scheme negotiated by the Helplines Partnership (now known as the Helplines Association).

Since 1 July 2015, all 0800 and 0808 numbers have been free to call from landlines and mobile phones alike. Most mobile phone operators had charged for such calls previously, with Orange being the final major network to introduce such charges during December 2005. Certain helplines, such as those in the 0808 80x xxxx series had remained free from most networks on a voluntary basis and some niche operators, such as Giffgaff always offered freephone calls at no charge.

The UK mobile operators offer an alternative product to organisations who wish to provide toll-free services - 5-digit voice short codes which are sold through mobile aggregators.

0500 numbers, introduced by Mercury Communications (later known as Cable &amp; Wireless, now Vodafone) in 1982, were also freephone numbers (known as &quot;FreeCall&quot;), but were officially withdrawn by Ofcom on 3 June 2017. A three-year transition period prior to that had allowed existing subscribers to migrate to matching 080 85 numbers with the same final 6 digits as before. While the numbers had been portable, the 0500 range had been closed to new allocations since 1997/98.

0500 numbers had six more digits after the prefix. 0800 numbers can have six or seven digits after the prefix. 0808 numbers have seven digits after the prefix.

Freephone numbers in the range to are blocked out by Ofcom for use as fictitious telephone numbers.

===United States===

Toll-free numbers in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) are commonly called &quot;800-numbers&quot; after the first area code assigned for the service. Today, several prefixes are used: 800 (since January 1, 1966), 888 (since March 1, 1996), 877 (since April 4, 1998), 866 (since July 29, 2000), 855 (since October 9, 2010), 844 (since December 7, 2013), and 833 (since June 3, 2017).

Area codes reserved for future expansion of the service include 822, 880 through 887, and 889.

The original Wide Area Telephone Service (WATS) is obsolete. North American toll-free numbers are controlled by an intelligent network database (SMS/800) in which any toll-free number may be directed to any geographic telephone number under the control of any of various RespOrgs. Direct inward dialing and toll-free number portability are supported; various providers offer gateways which receive free phone calls on PRI lines and deliver them to voice over IP or pager users.

Toll free numbers usually capture the telephone number of the caller for billing purposes through automatic number identification, which is independent of caller ID data and functions even if caller ID is blocked.

==Universal International Freephone Service==

Universal International Freephone Service is an international service, assigned the country code 800 by the International Telecommunication Union. The intention is that any customer in the world can dial the same number to reach a business subscribing to a number, and at no charge to the calling party. However, only a limited number of countries participate . In order to participate, countries must agree on the amount of revenue they will retain (to cover their costs of network transport) while still forwarding sufficient revenue to cover the recipient&#x27;s costs of subscribing.

A Universal International Freephone Number (UIFN) is a worldwide toll-free &quot;800 number&quot; issued by the International Telecommunication Union. Like the 800 area code issued for the North American Numbering Plan in the United States and Canada and 0800 numbers in many other countries, the call is free for the caller while the receiver pays the charges. UIFN uses country-level calling code 800 so that no matter where the caller is, only the international access code (IAC), the UIFN country code (800) and the 8-digit UIFN need to be dialed. As of March 2020, 144 carriers in 67 countries participate in the UIFN program; free access to the numbers (as international calls) from mobile and coin telephones is not universal. Registration of a +800 number incurs a 300 Swiss franc ITU fee (as of 2018) in addition to any charges levied by the individual carrier. The number must be activated for inbound calls from at least two telephone country codes within 180 days.

The +800 UIFN service is one of three ITU-administered non-geographic codes with a similar numbering scheme. The +808 Universal International Shared Cost Number (UISCN), billed at the price of a domestic call, shares the same eight-digit format; the +979 Universal International Premium Rate Number (UIPRN), billed at a high premium cost, carries one extra digit to indicate price range.

<doc id="406733" wikidata="Q5571388" url="?curid=406733" title="Gloria Guinness">
<text>Gloria Guinness (née Rubio y Alatorre; 27 August 1912 – 9 November 1980), previously Countess Gloria von Fürstenberg-Herdringen, was a Mexican socialite and a contributing editor to &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; from 1963 to 1971. She was photographed by Cecil Beaton, Slim Aarons, Alejo Vidal-Quadras; designed for by Cristóbal Balenciaga, Elsa Schiaparelli, Hubert de Givenchy, Yves Saint-Laurent; and was also a close friend and inspiration to Truman Capote.

== Family and childhood ==
Gloria Rubio y Alatorre was born in Guadalajara, Mexico. She was the daughter of José Rafael Rubio y Torres (1880, Michoacán, México – 1916, San Antonio, Texas), a liberal journalist who supported Francisco I. Madero for which he died in exile, in the United States, and his wife, Maria Luisa Alatorre y Diaz-Ocampo (1882–1961, Zapotlán el Grande, Jalisco) who belonged to a Spanish colonial landowning family from Jalisco, who made their fortune in sugar (descendants of conquistador Don Diego de Ochoa-Garibay), partly described by their relative, Alfonso Reyes Ochoa, in his book &quot;Parentalia&quot;.

Through her paternal family, Gloria was a relative of the celebrated 19th-century art collector Ramón de Errazu y Rubio de Tejada and of the wealthy Mexican aristocrat Jesús Colón de Larreátegui y Vallarta (a direct descendant of the 1st Duke of Veragua, eldest son of Christopher Columbus). Gloria had two elder siblings: Rafael and Maria Luisa.

Gloria&#x27;s childhood was unstable, mainly because of her father&#x27;s political persecution during the Mexican Revolution and early death in exile (due to health complications at a health clinic in San Antonio, Texas when Gloria was age 5). She and her siblings spent most of their childhood with her mother&#x27;s relatives, members of Mexican elite, such as the Ochoa-Garibay, Villaseñor-Jasso and Sánchez de Aldana families, with whom the Rubios lived for periods of time. Nevertheless, the Cristero War in Jalisco forced both them and their relatives to leave the countryside for Mexico City, where she eventually met her first husband.

=== Legendary origins ===
Without any known explanation, Guinness frequently downplayed or directly lied about her origins, often saying she was from Veracruz, that her father was a revolutionary soldier killed in action, and that her mother was either a laundry maid or a seamstress. Her mysterious true origins were the cause of numerous rumors and speculation, many intended to diminish her social position, but eventually did little to destroy her reputation as &quot;the most elegant woman in the World,” in the words of Eleanor Lambert, founder of the Met Gala, New York Fashion Week and the International Best Dressed List.

== Marriages and descendants ==
Gloria Rubio was married four times.

Her first marriage to Jacobus Hendrik Franciscus Scholtens, the Dutch director of a sugar refinery estate in Veracruz took place in Mexico City, on 31 March 1933. Rubio was 20, and the groom, a son of Jan Scholtens and Maria Le Comte, was 47. They separated, shortly afterwards, and they finally divorced, in 1935, with no issue.

Her second marriage was to Franz-Egon Maria Meinhard Engelbert Pius Aloysius Kaspar Ferdinand Dietrich, third Graf von Fürstenberg-Herdringen (1896–1975), whom she married on 4 October 1935, in Kensington, England; this being the second marriage to both and making her a stepmother of actress Betsy von Furstenberg. They were the parents of:

* Dolores Maria Agatha Wilhelmine Luise, Freiin von Fürstenberg-Hedringen (31 July 1936 – 20 January 2012). She married Patrick Benjamin Guinness (her stepbrother) on 22 October 1955, who died in 1965 in a car accident in Switzerland. They were the parents of:
** Maria Alexandra Guinness (b. 1956), who married Foulques, Count de Quatrebarbes (b. 1948), with issue, in 1979, and, after their divorce, Neville Cook.
** Loel Patrick Guinness (b. 1957)
** Victoria Guinness (b. 1960), who married Philip Niarchos in 1984, son of Greek shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos, with issue.
* Franz-Egon Engelbert Raphael Christophorus Hubertus, 4th Graf von Fürstenberg-Hedringen (born 27 July 1939 in Berlin-Wilmersdorf). He married Agneta Sundby (born 12 April 1943), a Swedish model on 20 August 1967, in Visnum church, Visnum, Sweden. After their divorce, he married Adelina von Fürstenberg (née Cuberyan).

Her third marriage was to Ahmad-Abu-El-Fotouh Fakhry Bey (1921–1998), whom she married in 1946 and divorced in 1949. He was a grandson of King Fuad I of Egypt, as the only child of Princess Fawkia of Egypt (later Countess Wladimir d’Adix-Dellmensingen) and her first husband, Mahmud Fakhry Pasha. Through his mother, he was a nephew of King Farouk I of Egypt and Queen Fawzia of Iran (first wife of Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, Shah of Iran). No issue came from this marriage.

Her fourth and final marriage was to Thomas Loel Guinness (1906–1988), Member of Parliament, shareholder of Guinness Mahon, as a member of the banking branch of the Guinness family. They married on 7 April 1951, in Antibes. By this marriage, she had three stepchildren: Patrick Benjamin Guinness (1931–1965), married to her daughter Dolores; William Loel Seymour Guinness (born 1939), and Belinda Guinness (1941-2020), wife of Sheridan Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 5th Marquess of Dufferin and Ava.

Among Guinness&#x27;s alleged lovers, in-between her successive marriages, were David Beatty, 2nd Earl Beatty, and the British ambassador to France Duff Cooper.

==Fashion and cultural icon==
In 1963, Guinness began a series of columns in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;. She famously asserted, in the magazine&#x27;s July 1963 issue, that &quot;Elegance is in the brain, as well as in the body and in the soul. Jesus Christ is the only example we have of any one human having possessed all three at the same time.&quot;

=== Artist&#x27;s subject ===
She was painted by artists like René Bouché, Kenneth Paul Block and Alejo Vidal-Quadras. She was photographed for &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; and &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot; by Cecil Beaton, Richard Avedon, John Rawlings, Toni Frissell, Horst P. Horst, Slim Aarons and Henry Clarke.

=== Capote&#x27;s swans ===
Gloria was named, by Truman Capote, as one of his &quot;swans,” a group which included Lee Radziwill, Marella Agnelli, Gloria Vanderbilt, Babe Paley, Diana Vreeland, and others, which he used as inspiration for his characters, most notably in his chapter &quot;La Côte Basque 1965&quot;.

=== Fashion ===
Guinness was dressed by various top-couture designers like Cristóbal Balenciaga, Elsa Schiaparelli, Marc Bohan at Christian Dior, Chanel, Hubert de Givenchy, Yves Saint Laurent, Valentino Garavani, Halston and shoes by Roger Vivier.

She was one of the first models to wear capri pants by Emilio Pucci.

Among the 17 outfits, 12 hats and pairs of shoes that she donated to museum collections were a 1948 Balenciaga evening gown of organdy with flock flowers, an evening gown from 1965, a 1949 hand-painted evening gown by Marcelle Chaumont and a 1950s evening gown by Jeanne Lafaurie, the only dress by that designer in the collection of Victoria &amp; Albert Museum.

===The most elegant woman in the world===
Despite being voted in second place at &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Best Dressed Woman in the World&quot; in 1962, after Jacqueline Kennedy, Eleanor Lambert famously asserted that, without a doubt, Gloria Guinness was &quot;to me, the most elegant woman in the World&quot;.

She appeared on the International Best Dressed List from 1959 through 1963. The following year, she was elevated into its Hall of Fame.

===Design and properties===
The Guinnesses had an apartment in Manhattan&#x27;s Waldorf Towers, an 18th-century farmhouse called Villa Zanroc in Épalinges, a 350-ton yacht, an apartment on Avenue Matignon in Paris, decorated by Georges Geffroy, a stud farm in Normandy, Haras de Piencourt, and Gemini, a mansion at Manalapan, Florida.

The Florida property, which is divided by U.S. Highway A1A, faces the lake, on one side, and the ocean, on the other; the two halves of the building, which was designed in the 1940s by architect Marion Syms Wyeth for Gerald Lambert, were ingeniously connected by a sound-proofed living room that was set beneath the bisecting road. In addition, the Guinnesses built a house in Acapulco, Mexico, designed by Mexican architect Marco Aldaco. They also kept three aircraft: an Avro Commander, for short trips around Europe, a small jet, and a helicopter for Loel Guinness&#x27;s hops between the Manalapan house and the Palm Beach golf course.

== Death ==
In 1980, Gloria Guinness died of a heart attack at Villa Zanroc in Epalinges. She is buried next to her last husband at the Bois de Vaux Cemetery in Lausanne, who was transferred there, after his death in a health clinic in Houston, Texas in 1988.

<text>Interstate 605 (abbreviated I-605, officially known as the San Gabriel River Freeway) is a major north–south auxiliary Interstate Highway in the Greater Los Angeles urban area of Southern California. It runs from I-405 and State Route 22 (SR 22) in Seal Beach in Orange County to I-210 just south of the Irwindale–Duarte border in Los Angeles County. The San Gabriel River Freeway closely parallels the San Gabriel River for most of its alignment, hence its name, which is one of the few Southern California freeways not named after a city along its route.

Aside from changes to the interchange with I-105 (which did not open until the early 1990s), and the addition of an HOV lane between I-405 and I-10, I-605 is one of the only remaining freeways that kept its original alignment throughout its run through Los Angeles County since it first opened.

==Route description==
The entirety of I-605 is defined in the state highway system as Route 605. It is defined as such in the California Streets and Highways Code&#x27;s section 619:
Route 605 is from:
(a) Route 1 near Seal Beach to Route 405.
(b) Route 405 to Route 210 near Duarte.

Route 605 shall be known and designated as the “San Gabriel River Freeway.”
The interchange with I-405 and SR 22 was built to accommodate an unconstructed future extension south to SR 1 as outlined in subdivision (a). The distance is traversable via nearby Seal Beach Boulevard, but Caltrans has no intention to adopt the road as part of Route 605.

The southern terminus of I-605 is at the San Diego (I-405) and Garden Grove (SR 22) Freeways in Seal Beach. From there, it runs roughly north through the Gateway Cities of the Los Angeles Basin. It then shifts north-northeast, crossing the Whittier Narrows and across the San Gabriel Valley. I-605 then ends at its junction with the Foothill Freeway, (I-210) just south of the Irwindale–Duarte border. Ramps from I-605 then extend north to Huntington Drive in Duarte.

I-605 follows most of the length of the San Gabriel River from the San Diego Freeway in Seal Beach to the Santa Fe Dam. Typically dry riverbed and flood basins are visible from many portions of the route, especially near the northern terminus.

In the mid-2000s, a HOV lane was added for motorists with two or more people to use between I-405 and I-10. The HOV lane ends at I-10 and there are no plans to extend it to I-210 at this time. With the addition of the HOV lane, the left shoulder was eliminated to avoid massive costs to widen the freeway. The highway also suffers from traffic jams regularly, especially the junction with I-5 (the Santa Ana Freeway). Newer signs with exit numbers replaced the older signs between the Orange County line and I-10 in 2016, with the completion of the I-605 and I-10 junction improvement. I-605 is one of the only Southern California freeways without destinations (control cities) such as &quot;Seal Beach&quot; or &quot;Irwindale&quot; since its opening. Rather, cardinal directions (&quot;NORTH&quot; or &quot;SOUTH&quot;), and a simple &quot;THRU TRAFFIC&quot; designation in place of control cities, are used on signs along I-605 itself.

I-605 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. I-605 from I-405 to I-10 is known as the San Gabriel River Freeway, as named by Senate Bill 99, Chapter 1101 in 1967.

==History==

In 1957, the number for this route was proposed as I-13, as it is positioned approximately midway between I-5 and I-15 (although it intersects the former). That number was rejected, as was the second proposed number, I-102. Finally, the designation I-605 was accepted in 1958.

I-605 began construction in 1963 and the first section was opened in 1964 from I-405 to SR 60. The newest section (extension to I-210) was opened in 1971 was originally signed as SR 243. There are plans to extend it to SR 1 further south in Orange County as SR 605, but strong community opposition means that it is unlikely that the alignment will ever be built.

In 2020, there was a proposal to widen I-605, which would have added four new lanes to of I-605 between Norwalk and El Monte, California. This proposal was rejected due to strong community opposition, in particular due to the fact that it would have led to the destruction of houses in Downey, California.

<text>Crossfire is a free and open source software cross-platform multiplayer online role-playing video game. features a tile based graphic system with a pseudo-isometric perspective. All content is licensed under the GNU GPL-2.0-or-later. The client and server will run in Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, IRIX, and an array of other platforms.

== Description ==

 is a multi-player online role-playing game; it can be described as a cross-over of the ideas of Nethack, Ultima and Gauntlet.

== Development history ==
&#x27;s development history started in mid-1992. It originally started as a Gauntlet clone developed by Frank Tore Johansen at the University of Oslo in Norway. After a name change in that same year and brief hosting time at University of California, Berkeley (Jul-1999 to Jan-2001), the project now resides at SourceForge where development continues.

 started with just one indoor map and then increased to 4 indoor maps with one-way portals from level 1 to level 4. Upon clearing the last level, there was nothing more for the player to do. Spells were limited to magic bullet (the first spell), fireball, magic missile, burning hands and lightning bolt. Later, when two-way portals were implemented, development and content contribution expanded greatly.

 has since grown to encompass over 150 monsters, about 3000 maps to explore, an elaborate magic system, 13 races, 15 character classes, a system of skills, and many artifacts and treasures.

As of July 2018 the game is under active development by the community.

== Gameplay ==

Any number of players can connect and play on the public servers, finding and using items and battling monsters. They can cooperate or compete in the same world which includes both static and randomly generated content. It is a client and server based game with the ability to be played over the Internet, on a local network setting, or on a single computer setup.

 is based in a medieval fantasy world. Players can choose any of 13 races from dragons (fire hatchlings) to quetzalcoatl as well as the more average human and elf. They can also play as one of 15 classes or professions which range from alchemist to a monk to a warrior. The game has a comprehensive skill system that attributes experience points to each skill, instead of the character earning general experience points.

Once the character creation process is complete, players enter the game world and pick from the two starting towns, Scorn or Navar. Although there are many quests, the game leans towards hack and slash adventuring with other players. The game world is quite large, making exploration a key gameplay mechanic.

== Influence on other online games ==
 was used as the base of a number of commercial and free MMORPGs, such as , a Java rewrite, , which closed its code and content, and , which only used the server code but features an isometric view and a different project philosophy focused on a single main server. is another fork of the Crossfire project, primarily aiming to improve the quality of its code and in-game content.

== Reception ==
In 1999 was featured by Linux Journal. The game was downloaded over 550,000 times from SourceForge.net between 2000 and April 2020.

<text>The brown creeper (Certhia americana), also known as the American treecreeper, is a small songbird, the only North American member of the treecreeper family Certhiidae.

==Description==
Adults are brown on the upper parts with light spotting, resembling a piece of tree bark, with white underparts. They have a long thin bill with a slight downward curve and a long stiff tail used for support as the bird creeps upwards. The male creeper has a slightly larger bill than the female. Brown creepers are smaller than white-breasted nuthatches but larger than golden-crowned kinglets.

Measurements:

* Length: 
* Weight: 
* Wingspan: 

Its voice includes single very high pitched, short, often insistent, piercing calls; &quot;see&quot;, or &quot;swee&quot;. The song often has a cadence like; &quot;pee pee willow wee&quot; or &quot;see tidle swee&quot;, with notes similar to the calls. Creepers in California have songs of four to nine syllables, except in the San Bernardino Mountains, where there are as many as nine to thirteen syllables per song, but within the same two second time frame.

This species&#x27;s avoidance of edges, cryptic plumage, and high-pitched vocalizations contribute to a low survey detection rate compared to other species.

==Distribution, habitat and range==
Brown creepers are both migratory and year-round residents in North America. Their breeding habitat is mature forests, especially conifers, in Canada, Alaska and the northeastern and western United States, and they are non-breeding in the southern part of the United States. They are permanent residents through much of their range; many northern birds migrate to the southern half of the United States. Brown creepers have occurred as vagrants to Bermuda and Central America&#x27;s mountains in Guatemala, Honduras and the northern cordillera of El Salvador. Since 1966 the brown creeper has experienced a yearly 1.5% population increase throughout the northeastern and northwestern (Pacific coast) regions of its range. The first breeding brown creepers in the Northwest Territories were detected in 2008, in the Liard Valley, which may be a result of northern range expansion.

As a migratory species with a northern range, this species is a conceivable vagrant to western Europe. However, it is intermediate in its characteristics between common treecreeper and short-toed treecreeper, and has sometimes in the past been considered a subspecies of the former, although its closest relative seems to be the latter (Tietze &quot;et al.&quot;, 2006). Since the two European treecreepers are themselves among the most difficult species on that continent to distinguish from each other, a brown creeper would probably not even be suspected, other than on a treeless western island, and would be difficult to verify even then.

Brown creepers prefer mature, moist, coniferous forests or mixed coniferous/deciduous forests. They are found in drier forests as well, including Engelman Spruce and larch forest in eastern Washington. They generally avoid the rainforest of the outer coast. While they generally nest in hardwoods, conifers are preferred for foraging.

Breeding brown creepers generally require trees of a large diameter, whose deeper bark furrows support large amounts of bark-dwelling invertebrates such as spiders to make up a foraging substratum. They also require continual renewal of snags, with a preference for Balsam Fir in their New Brunswick breeding range.

Brown creepers have been recorded breeding in the dry season (January–February) in Chalatenango Department, El Salvador, a behaviour unusual to insectivorous birds and shared in the region only by the golden-fronted woodpecker.

==Subspecies==
Thirteen subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;C. a. alascensis&quot; Webster, JD, 1986 – central south Alaska
* &quot;C. a. occidentalis&quot; Ridgway, 1882 – southeast Alaska, west Canada and west USA
* &quot;C. a. stewarti&quot; Webster, JD, 1986 – islands off British Columbia (southwest Canada)
* &quot;C. a. zelotes&quot; Osgood, 1901 – mountains of south Oregon to north, east, south California (west USA)
* &quot;C. a. phillipsi&quot; Unitt &amp; Rea, 1997 – central California (west USA)
* &quot;C. a. montana&quot; Ridgway, 1882 – interior southwest Canada to central north and central USA
* &quot;C. a. leucosticta&quot; Van Rossem, 1931 – south Nevada and Utah (central west USA)
* &quot;C. a. americana&quot; Bonaparte, 1838 – south, east Canada and central north, northeast USA
* &quot;C. a. nigrescens&quot; Burleigh, 1935 – central east USA
* &quot;C. a. albescens&quot; Berlepsch, 1888 – southwest USA and northwest Mexico
* &quot;C. a. alticola&quot; Miller, GS, 1895 – west, southwest, central Mexico
* &quot;C. a. pernigra&quot; Griscom, 1935 – south Mexico and Guatemala
* &quot;C. a. extima&quot; Miller, W &amp; Griscom, 1925 – east Guatemala to Nicaragua

==Conservation status==

The species has declined in much of North America but appears to be doing well in Washington, with a small (not significant) increase on the state&#x27;s breeding bird survey since 1966. As with many of Washington&#x27;s birds, the Cascades divide this species into two subspecies.

In Wyoming, brown creepers have been recognized as preferring habitat within large, intact and mature stands of spruces, firs, or lodgepole pine. It is therefore potentially vulnerable to logging, climate change, or replacement of those tree species by Ponderosa pine. However, it is not considered a species of serious concern in that state.

In New Brunswick, brown creepers have been shown to respond negatively to even moderate forestry. Conservation efforts in the province have focused on maintaining unmanaged patches with high densities of trees and snags in mature forest.

Ivory-billed woodcreepers (&quot;Xiphorhynchus flavigaster&quot;) have been observed extracting brown creeper nestlings and dropping them away from the nest.

==Behavior==
Brown creepers forage on tree trunks and branches, typically zig-zagging upwards from the bottom of a tree trunk, and then flying down to the bottom of another tree. They creep slowly with their body flattened against the bark, probing with their beak for insects. They will rarely feed on the ground. They mainly eat small arthropods found in the bark, but sometimes they will eat seeds in winter.

==Breeding==
Breeding season typically begins in April. The female will make a partial cup nest either under a piece of bark partially detached from the tree, or in a tree cavity. It will lay 3–7 eggs, and incubation lasts approximately two weeks. Both of the parents help feed the chicks. Parents both take turns feeding nestlings and removing fecal sacs from the nest.

<text>Interstate 805 (I-805) is a major north–south auxiliary Interstate Highway in Southern California. It is a bypass auxiliary route of I-5, running roughly through the center of the Greater San Diego region from San Ysidro (part of the city of San Diego) near the Mexico–U.S. border to near Del Mar. The southern terminus of I-805 at I-5 in San Ysidro is less than north of the Mexican border. I-805 then traverses the cities of Chula Vista and National City before reentering San Diego. The freeway passes through the San Diego neighborhoods of North Park, Mission Valley, Clairemont, and University City before terminating at I-5 in the Sorrento Valley neighborhood near the Del Mar city limit.

Planning for I-805 began in 1956, and the route was officially designated in 1959 before it was renumbered in the 1964 state highway renumbering. Starting in 1967, the freeway was built in phases, with the northern part of the freeway finished before the southern part. I-805 was completed and open to traffic in 1975. Named the Jacob Dekema Freeway after the longtime head of the regional division of the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), I-805 has been frequently cited for its complex engineering and architecture, including near I-8 on the Mission Valley Viaduct. Since then, several construction projects have taken place, including the construction of carpool lanes.

==Route description==

The route begins at I-5 near the Mexican border in a far south part of San Ysidro, a neighborhood of San Diego. As it starts its journey northwards, it quickly has a junction with State Route 905 (SR 905) before exiting the city of San Diego and entering Chula Vista. Within the past 20 years the freeway has delineated the apparent divide between rich and poor in the city of Chula Vista; those on the eastern side of the freeway have been more affluent and have better schools compared to those on the western side. Just outside the city, I-805 meets County Route S17 (CR S17), also named Bonita Road, before coming to an interchange with SR 54. The freeway then enters National City, where it intersects Sweetwater Road and Plaza Boulevard, before leaving the city and reentering the city of San Diego.

I-805 continues northward through San Diego, where it intersects SR 94, the Martin Luther King Jr. Freeway. As the freeway continues through San Diego, it meets SR 15, the continuation of I-15. It then intersects El Cajon Boulevard before passing under the Hazard Memorial Bridge that carries Adams Avenue. The bridge was named after Roscoe Hazard for his involvement in the construction of several roads and highways in Southern California. I-805 then travels on the Mission Valley Viaduct, a towering reinforced concrete viaduct built in 1972, spanning over Mission Valley and the San Diego River. The viaduct is the top stack of the Jack Schrade Interchange over I-8, which runs along the south side of Mission Valley and crosses underneath the viaduct perpendicularly, and is San Diego County&#x27;s only symmetrical stack interchange. The San Diego Trolley traffic also runs under the viaduct on the valley floor.
After intersecting SR 163, also known as the Cabrillo Freeway, I-805 continues through suburban San Diego, where it meets SR 52 in Clairemont Mesa. North of SR 52, it closely parallels I-5 near La Jolla, heading northwest. Passing under the Eastgate Mall arch bridge and entering Sorrento Valley, it finally meets its north end at I-5. During the widening project which was completed in 2007, I-5 at the I-805 merge was built to be 21 lanes wide. Eastbound SR 56 and Carmel Mountain Road are accessible via a parallel carriageway for local traffic heading northbound from I-805; traffic from SR 56 westbound can merge onto I-805 from the local bypass.

The route is officially known as the Jacob Dekema Freeway after Jacob Dekema, a pioneering force from the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) who helped shape the San Diego freeway system. It is also part of the California Freeway and Expressway System and the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. In 2013, I-805 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 41,500 at the southern terminus, and 262,000 between Bonita Road and SR 54, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway.

==History==

===Construction===
According to Dekema, planning for I-805 began in 1956. The original routing for I-805 was approved as an Interstate Highway in July 1958. It was added to the state highway system and the Freeway and Expressway System in 1959 as Route 241. I-805 was expected to reduce traffic on what was then US 101 between Los Angeles and San Diego, when the former was opened. Route 241 was renumbered to Route 805 in the 1964 state highway renumbering, and I-5 was designated along the route from Los Angeles to San Diego. Further planning was underway in 1965, with the goal to have the route built by 1972, the federal highway funding deadline. This was to be the first freeway in the area with no prior road along its route that it would replace; the goal was to provide a bypass around San Diego for those traveling to Mexico, and improve access for local residents. By June, houses along the route in the North Park area were being sold, as the land was needed for the first stretch of the freeway to be constructed. The next year, Dekema confirmed that the first portion of what was known as the Inland Freeway to be built would be between Home and Adams avenues.

In May 1967, bidding began, after construction had been delayed by that of the I-5 and I-8 freeways, both of which had been given higher priority. This first portion would run from Wabash Boulevard to around Madison Avenue (a distance of ), and the next portion would include the I-8 interchange. The R.E. Hazard and W.F. Maxwell Companies won the low bid of $11.7 million (equivalent to $ in ) in mid-1967. The groundbreaking ceremony happened on September 25 at El Cajon Boulevard and Boundary Street. In August 1968, the portion of I-805 from just south of I-8 to north of Friars Road, including the interchange with I-8, was put up for bidding; at a budgeted $27.5 million (equivalent to $ in ), it was the most expensive job that the Division of Highways had ever put up for bid. The winning bid was $20.9 million (equivalent to $ in ), and was awarded to R.E. Hazard Contracting Company and W.F. Maxwell Company.
Construction had begun on the viaduct by May 1969; in the meantime, National City was making plans for developing the freeway corridor with motels and restaurants, as well as a shopping center. In mid-1969, bidding was to begin on of I-805 from north of Friars Road to north of what was then US 395, which would become SR 163. Construction from J Street south to near San Ysidro was underway by September, when there were concerns that an order from President Richard Nixon to reduce federal construction projects by 75 percent might affect funding for the portion north of Friars Road. However, Governor Ronald Reagan lifted the associated freeze in construction at the state level a few weeks later. A month later, the contract for the portion between Friars Road and US 395 had been awarded for $15 million (equivalent to $ in ); the portions between there and north of Miramar Road were in the planning phases, while construction continued south of I-8 to Wabash Boulevard. The portion from SR 52 to Miramar Road had been contracted out to O.G. Sansome Company for $5.6 million (equivalent to $ in ) by the end of 1969. Meanwhile, $4 million (equivalent to $ in ) of state funding was spent in 1969 to find housing for those who were to be displaced by the freeway in San Ysidro.

By March 1970, the original section between Home Avenue and near I-8 was almost finished. The Mission Valley portion extending north of US 395, as well as from Otay Valley Road and J Street in Chula Vista, were still under construction. The portion immediately north of US 395 was contracted to A.A. Baxter Corporation, E.C. Young, and Young and Sons, Inc. for $7.9 million (equivalent to $ in ). On July 6, the first section to begin construction was dedicated, and was to be opened from El Cajon Boulevard to Wabash Boulevard soon thereafter; the rest of the section would not open until the Mission Valley interchange with I-8 was finished.

A second border crossing in the San Ysidro area was proposed near the Playas de Tijuana area, that would be accessible from I-805, although another alternative was considered near Brown Field. A formal study on the matter was commissioned in August. However, this would have added $10 million (equivalent to $ in ) to the cost of the freeway, and possibly delay it by up to 10 years; furthermore, most traffic crossing the border was found to head to Tijuana and not Ensenada. Following this, the city of Chula Vista asked that the state proceed with the original plans to construct the freeway, even though it would pass through a San Ysidro neighborhood.

In September 1970, bidding began for the final portion of the northern half of I-805 between Miramar Road and I-5; a month later, the segments between Home Avenue and SR 94, and SR 54 to 12th Street had funding allocated. By the end of the year, Hazard, Maxwell, and Matich had submitted the low bid of around $7.2 million (equivalent to $ in ) for the northernmost portion. The Chula Vista portion of the freeway from Main Street to L Street was completed in February 1971; by then, the estimated date for completing the entire freeway had slipped to 1975 from 1972. By March, the projected completion date for the Mission Valley bridge was revised to July 1972. A 102-home mobile home park was approved by the City Council a few weeks later to house those who were displaced by the freeway construction.

The portion of the freeway from Otay Valley Road to Telegraph Canyon Road opened during 1972. On October 22, several unconstructed portions of I-805 were partially funded, including from Chula Vista south past SR 75, north of the completed Chula Vista portion to SR 54, from SR 54 to Plaza Boulevard in National City, from there to SR 94 (including the interchange with SR 252), and from there to Home Avenue. Before the end of the year, the portion from SR 94 to Home Avenue entered the bidding phase; Guy F. Atkinson Company won the contract for roughly $9.96 million (equivalent to $ in ) in early 1972. Following a request from the El Cajon City Council, March 19 was set aside as a Community Cycle Day for bicyclists to travel the newly finished freeway from El Cajon Boulevard to SR 52, just before the freeway was to be dedicated the next day; during the event, around 30 people had injured themselves, and police estimated that some bicyclists had attained speeds of up to traveling down the hill leading to the Mission Valley Viaduct. The entire Mission Valley Viaduct was open to traffic that month.

By the beginning of 1974, I-805 was open north of Home Avenue, and from Otay Valley Road to Telegraph Canyon Road in Chula Vista; five segments remaining were under construction, and the last segment was funded. The Imperial Avenue section of I-805 remained in the budget, despite revisions in response to the 1973 oil crisis. In late January, I-805 between SR 15 and SR 94 was opened to traffic, though not all of the ramps at the SR 94 interchange were operational. The connectors to SR 94 east were completed in March. The entire portion between SR 94 and Home Avenue cost $10.5 million (equivalent to $ in ). Construction between SR 94 and Imperial Avenue was well under way by December, at a cost of $8.5 million (equivalent to $ in ).

As the scheduled completion of the freeway neared, Mayor Tom Hamilton of Chula Vista expressed concerns regarding the predicted development of the I-805 corridor, and the decisions that the City Council would need to make regarding such plans. The portion south of Otay Valley Road cost $15 million (equivalent to $ in ), and the portion between Telegraph Canyon Road and Sweetwater Road cost $12 million (equivalent to $ in ). The portion from there to Imperial Avenue was projected to cost $10.2 million (equivalent to $ in ). The dedication of the freeway took place on July 23, 1975, even though the freeway was not entirely finished, due to the desire to hold the ceremony during the summer. I-805 from Plaza Boulevard to Telegraph Canyon Road opened to traffic on July 28, leaving the freeway complete except for the portion between Plaza Boulevard and SR 94. While portions of the freeway were nearly ready for traffic, there were reports of motorists driving on the closed freeway, which the California Highway Patrol warned was illegal. On September 3, Dekema announced that the entirety of the freeway would open the next day as he made a final inspection of the unopened portion; the total cost of the construction was $145 million (equivalent to $ in ). However, Dekema announced that there was no more state funding available to construct further roads for the short-term.

===Recognition, artwork, and architecture===

The Mission Valley Viaduct was recognized by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) as the &quot;Outstanding Civil Engineering Project for 1973 in the San Diego Area&quot;; it was designed to match the close by Mission San Diego de Alcalá with its columns that look similar to cathedral windows, and arch-like shapes etched into the textured concrete. The viaduct was designed to span , and use squared-off support columns instead of traditional cylindrical supports. Octagonal columns were to be used on the ramps and the ends of the bridge. Over 600 tons () of steel bars were to be used, and the bridge was constructed as high as above I-8. The Adams Avenue Bridge over I-805 was also recognized for its span and two tapered supports on the ends of the bridge; in 1968, a Princeton University engineering professor asked for a copy of the design from Caltrans for educational purposes. The construction supervisor, in fact, compared the construction of this bridge to building a boat, and it was constructed from the middle outward rather than the conventional method of building from the ends inward. The span was designed to be long, and high.

Awards for the Eastgate Mall (or Old Miramar Bridge) came from the Federal Highway Administration, San Diego Highway Development Association, and Prestressed Concrete Institute Awards Program; at the time, it was one of the first arch bridges in the state, and did not use traditional concrete pillars. The &quot;San Diego Union&quot; (predecessor to the &quot;Union-Tribune&quot;) published a few freelance articles in 1984 about I-805, complimenting the four-level interchange with I-8 and the arch bridge at Eastgate Mall, while mentioning that subsequent inflation after their completion would have made such structures more difficult to build if they had been constructed later. Other artwork and architecture that was mentioned included the Wateridge development in Sorrento Valley, and the &quot;Stargazer&quot; building by Alexander Liberman that was lit with fluorescent colors at night.

However, not all forms of artwork along the highway were uncontroversial. In 1977, there were several complaints regarding new billboards that were installed at the northern terminus of the highway, since they blocked the view of the coast. In 1981, an illegal mural that was determined to be incomplete was discovered at the I-8 interchange; while Caltrans discouraged the painting of such murals, they were impressed with the portion that had already been completed. Art Cole, the artist, stepped forward to the department, and was allowed to finish the mural of a desert highland sunrise; following this, Caltrans made efforts to have other murals commissioned.

The San Ysidro Chamber of Commerce attempted to have I-805 named as the San Ysidro Freeway in 1976. However, I-805 was named after Jacob Dekema in August 1981, and ceremonies to mark the occasion occurred in February 1982. The plaque honoring Dekema was installed in November at the Governor Drive interchange. Because of his efforts in designing I-805, Ed Settle of Caltrans was given the Outstanding Civil Engineering Award from the ASCE; he designed several other regional freeways, including SR 163 through Balboa Park and I-5 through San Diego.

===Expansion===

The construction of a &quot;dual freeway&quot; at the northern end of I-805 was discussed as early as 1989, referring to the two carriageways needed for each direction of the freeway, resulting in four total. It would require drivers to use the new local lanes to access eastbound SR 56 from I-5 or I-805. The project would allow for trucks to use the new lanes to assist in merging with traffic. However, it faced opposition from local residents, concerned about the loss of the view from their homes, as well as environmentalists concerned about nearby wetlands. Further objections espoused the view that the congestion would continue to increase, regardless of what was done, and that the new road would be at capacity in a few years. The San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) funded the construction with $110 million (equivalent to $ in ) in mid-2000.

Construction of the &quot;dual freeway&quot; began in early 2002, at a cost of $182 million (equivalent to $ in ). The northbound lanes were scheduled to open in February 2006. The southbound lanes were completed in early 2007. That year, a three-year project began to allow robot controlled vehicles, including buses and trucks, to use a special lane. The intention is to allow the vehicles to travel at shorter following distances and thereby allow more vehicles to use the lanes. The vehicles will still have drivers since they need to enter and exit the special lanes. The system was designed by Swoop Technology, based in San Diego County.

Two years later, construction began on two auxiliary lanes on I-805 southbound from SR 54 to Bonita Road, to improve traffic flow at the SR 54 interchange. In 2010, Caltrans proposed adding high-occupancy toll express lanes between SR 15 and East Palomar Street in Chula Vista. The California Transportation Commission (CTC) awarded $100 million for the work in June 2011, which would be split into two phases at the interchange with SR 54. Work is also underway to add two HOV lanes between SR 52 and Mira Mesa Boulevard; this project also received $59.5 million from the CTC in September 2011. Meanwhile, SANDAG made arrangements to purchase the SR 125 toll road and reduce the tolls, which was hoped to encourage commuters to take that road instead of I-805 and reduce congestion; this would then enable Caltrans to construct two managed lanes instead of the original four.

In February 2013, construction began on the northern HOV lanes; the project came at a cost $86 million. By May, construction on the Palomar Street direct access ramps had begun, and the Carroll Canyon Road ramps were almost finished. The northern project was completed in 2015, and the southern HOV lanes opened in March 2014 at a cost of $1.4 billion, with an option to expand them into two lanes in each direction, and a proposed direct ramp to the express lanes. A 2012 Caltrans report proposed adding four managed lanes along the entire length of the highway. The northern section carpool lanes are a continuation of the ones from Interstate 5 at the Sorrento Valley interchange and continue to Governor Drive. The southern section carpool lanes exist from SR 94 and Palomar Street. Plans exist to construct the 11-mile gap between SR 94 and Governor Drive have been put on hold until there are enough funds to widen the freeway and replace any necessary overpasses. In 2016, a half-cent sales tax was imposed to eventually pay for the construction of this gap.
