<text>A fad diet is a diet that is popular, generally only for a short time, similar to fads in fashion, without being a standard scientific dietary recommendation, and often making unreasonable claims for fast weight loss or health improvements; as such it is often considered a type of pseudoscientific diet. Fad diets are usually not supported by clinical research and their health recommendations are not peer-reviewed, thus they often make unsubstantiated statements about health and disease.

Generally, fad diets promise an assortment of desired changes requiring little effort, thus attracting the interest of consumers uneducated about whole-diet, whole-lifestyle changes necessary for sustainable health benefits. Fad diets are often promoted with exaggerated claims, such as rapid weight loss of more than 1 kg/week, improving health by &quot;detoxification&quot;, or even more dangerous claims achieved through highly restrictive and nutritionally unbalanced food choices leading to malnutrition or even eating non-food items such as cotton wool. Highly restrictive fad diets should be avoided. At best, fad diets may offer novel and engaging ways to reduce caloric intake, but at worst they may be unsustainable, medically unsuitable to the individual, or even dangerous. Dietitian advice should be preferred before attempting any diet.

Celebrity endorsements are frequently used to promote fad diets, which may generate significant revenue for the creators of the diets through the sale of associated products. Regardless of their evidence base, or lack thereof, fad diets are extremely popular, with over 1500 books published each year, and many consumers willing to pay into an industry worth $35 billion per year in the United States. About 14–15% Americans declare having used a fad diet for short-term weight loss.

== Description ==
=== Definition ===
There is no single definition of what is a fad diet, encompassing a variety of diets with different approaches and evidence base, and thus different outcomes, advantages, and disadvantages. Furthermore, labeling a diet as a fad is ever-changing, varying socially, culturally, timely, and subjectively. However, a common definition lies in the popularity of a diet promoting short-term changes instead of lifelong changes, and that popularity (or lack thereof) has no association with a diet&#x27;s effectiveness, nutritional soundness, or safety. The Federal Trade Commission defines fad diets as those that are highly restrictive and promoting energy dense foods that are often poor in nutrients.

=== Types of fad diets ===
Although fad diets are ever-changing, most can be categorized in these general groups:
* Physical or physiological testing, such as applied kinesiology and blood group analysis
* Low calorie diets:
** Food-specific diets, which encourage eating large amounts of a single food, such as the cabbage soup diet
** High-fiber, low-calorie diets, which often prescribe double the normal amount of dietary fiber
** Liquid diets, such as SlimFast meal replacement drinks
** Fasting
* Adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate diets, such as the Atkins diet, which first became popular in the 1970s

Fad diets are generally restrictive, and are characterized by promises of fast weight loss or great physical health (notably by &quot;detoxification&quot;), and which are not grounded in sound science.

Some fad diets, such as diets purporting to be alternative cancer treatments, promise health benefits other than weight loss.

Commercial weight management organizations (CWMOs), such as Weight Watchers, were inappropriately associated with fad diets in the past.

Several factors can cause someone to start a fad diet, such as socio-cultural peer pressure on body image, self-esteem and the effect of media.

=== Bad diets ===
Although not all fad diets are inherently detrimental to health, there are &quot;red flags&quot; of bad dietary advice, such as:
* Promising rapid weight loss such as more than 1 kg/week (2 lb/week) or other extraordinary claims that are &quot;too good to be true&quot;
* Being nutritionally imbalanced, or highly restrictive, forbidding entire food groups, or even allowing one food or food type. In the most extreme form, they may claim that humans can survive without eating 
* Recommending eating food in a specific order or combination, sometimes based on physiological properties such as genetics or blood type
* Recommending specific foods purported to be detoxing or to &quot;burn&quot; fat
* Promises a one-size-fits-all &quot;magic bullet&quot; with little to no effort to include other lifestyle changes (exercise, for example) that can improve health
* Based on anecdotal testimonials such as personal success stories, instead of medical evidence from randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials

== Health claims evaluations ==
Fad diets have variable results as these include a variety of different diets. They tend to result in short-term weight loss, but afterwards, the weight is often regained.

The restrictive approach, regardless of whether the diet prescribes eating large amounts of high-fiber vegetables, no grains, or no solid foods, tend to be nutritionally unsound, and can cause serious health problems if followed for more than a few days.

A considerable disadvantage of fad diets is that they encourage the notion of a diet as a short-term behavior, instead of a sustainable lifelong change. Indeed, fad diets often fail to re-educate dieters about a healthy nutrition, portion control and under-emphasize efforts and especially physical activity, so that followers cannot acquire the skills and knowledge they need for long-term maintenance of their desired weight, even if that weight is achieved in the short-term. Several diets are also unsustainable in the long-term, and thus dieters revert to old habits after deprivation of some foods which may lead to binge eating. Fad diets generally fail to address the causes of poor nutrition habits, and thus are unlikely to change the underlying behavior and the long-term outcomes.

Some fad diets are associated with increased risks of cardiovascular diseases, kidney stones, and mental disorders such as eating disorders and depression, and dental risks. For instance, long-term low-carbohydrate high-fat diets are associated with increased cardiac and non-cardiac mortality. Teenagers following fad diets are at risk of permanently stunted growth.

Some fad diets do however provide short-term and long-term results for individuals with specific illnesses such as obesity or epilepsy. Very-low-calorie diets, also known as crash diets, are efficient for liver fat reduction and weight loss before bariatric surgery. Low-calorie and very-low-calorie diets may produce initially faster weight loss within the first 1–2 weeks of starting compared to other diets, but this superficially faster loss is due to glycogen depletion and water loss in the lean body mass and regained quickly afterward.

Diet success in weight loss and health benefits is most predicted by adherence and negative energy balance, regardless of the diet type. Fad diets, with their popularity and variety, may be useful to introduce obese individuals via a dietary plan tailored to their food preferences and lifestyle into long-term dietary and lifestyle changes under supervision by nutrition professionals. Indeed, a wide variety of diets aiming at gentle caloric restriction under supervision, including commercial, fad, and standard care diets, have shown considerable and comparable success and safety, both in the short-term and long-term. Comprehensive diet programs are more effective than dieting without guidance. According to David L. Katz, &quot;efforts to improve public health through diet are forestalled not for want of knowledge about the optimal feeding of Homo sapiens but for distractions associated with exaggerated claims, and our failure to convert what we reliably know into what we routinely do.&quot;
There is a commonly claimed figure that &quot;95% of dieters regain their weight after a few years&quot;, but this is a &quot;clinical lore&quot; based on a 1953 primary study, with newer evidence demonstrating long-term weight loss after dieting under supervision, although a 2007 review found that one-third to two-thirds of dieters had slight to no long-term weight loss based on lesser quality trials, supporting Health at Every Size according to its authors. A review reported that extended calorie restriction suppresses overall and specific food cravings.

== Healthy diets ==

Improving dietary habits is a societal issue that should be considered when preparing national policies, according to the World Health Organization. They propose a set of recommendations for a healthy diet:
* Achieve an energy balance and maintain a healthy weight.
* Promote the consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole-grains, nuts, seeds, peas, beans, legumes, herbs, and spices.
* Limit sweets and sugar.
* Limit salt from all sources and ensure salt is iodized.
* Limit total fat consumption and in particular replace saturated fats by unsaturated fats as much as possible, and eliminate trans-fatty acids.

The 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans implement these recommendations in the US, as follows:
* Follow a lifelong healthy eating pattern.
* Focus on variety, nutrient density, and quantity.
* Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats. Reduce sodium intake.
* Prefer healthier food and beverage choices, such as nutrient-dense foods. These preferences should account for cultural and personal preferences to make application easier.
* Community support of healthy eating patterns for everyone.

Contrary to the previous editions which mainly focused on dietary components such as food groups and nutrients, the latest offer a more global approach focusing on eating patterns and nutrients characteristics as &quot;people do not eat food groups and nutrients in isolation but rather in combination, and the totality of the diet forms an overall eating pattern&quot;. Indeed, &quot;the components of the eating pattern can have interactive and potentially cumulative effects on health&quot;, noting that &quot;these patterns can be tailored to an individual&#x27;s personal preferences, enabling Americans to choose the diet that is right for them&quot;.

Several diets have shown sufficient evidence of safety and constant beneficial effects to be recommended. These include the DASH diet for anyone but especially for cardiac risk prevention in obesity and diabetes, the Mediterranean diet with similar indications, the U.S. Department of Agriculture &quot;MyPlate&quot; for healthy diet guidelines, and the ketogenic diet for reducing risk of seizures in people who have epilepsy.

==History==

===Ancient history===
The word &quot;diet&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;diaita&quot;, which described a whole lifestyle, including mental and physical, rather than a narrow weight-loss regimen. The Greek and Roman physicians considered that how a body functioned was largely dependent on the foods eaten, and that different foods could affect people in different ways.

Western medical science at the time was founded on &quot;diatetica&quot;, the &quot;fundamental healing therapy of a regimen of certain foods&quot;. Overweight or being too slim were seen as signs of an unhealthy body, with an imbalance of its four essential &quot;humours&quot; (black bile, yellow bile, blood, and phlegm).

The earliest diet known is from the oldest surviving medical document, the Ebers papyrus (circa 1550 BC), which described a recipe for an antidiabetic diet of wheat germ and okra. An early dietary fad is known from about 500–400 BC, when athletes and warriors consumed deer livers and lion hearts, thinking these products would impart benefits such as bravery, speed, or strength.

In the &quot;Corpus Hippocraticum&quot;, Hippocrates, a Greek philosopher and physician c. 460–370 BC, describes his views on human health, as being primarily influenced by alimentation and the environment we inhabit. He thought that the underlying principles of health were food and exercise, what he called &quot;work&quot;, and that a high food intake needed a lot of hard work to be properly assimilated. A failure to balance work and food intake would upset the body&#x27;s metabolism and incur diseases. As he wrote: &quot;Man cannot live healthily on food without a certain amount of exercise&quot;. He thought that changes in food intake should be made progressively to avoid upsetting the body. He made several recommendations, some of which being: walking or running after eating, wrestling, avoiding drinks outside of meals, dry foods for obese people, never missing a breakfast and eat only just one main meal a day, bathing in only lukewarm water, avoiding sex, and the more dangerous &quot;induction of vomiting&quot;, which he considered particularly beneficial. Nowadays, these advices seem mixed, some sensible, others inadvisable or even dangerous, but they made sense at the time given the contemporary knowledge and practices. For example, induced vomiting was quite popular, almost an art form. The importance of foods was further established by one of his followers, who became extremely influential, the Greek physician Galen (129 – ca. 216 AD), with his work &quot;On the Power of Foods&quot;, where he claimed that good doctors should also be good cooks, and provided several recipes.

In the classical world, what foods were eaten, and how much, played an important role in ethical, philosophical, and political teachings and thinking, centered on the ideas of luxury and corruption. Food was for sustenance alone, overindulging was morally and physically bad, at least a manifestation of a lack of self-control, but at worst leading to further passions and greed of other luxuries.

===19th century===

Fad diets as we know them really started during the Victorian era in the 19th century. A competitive market for &quot;healthy diets&quot; arose in the 19th-century developed world, as migration and industrialization and commodification of food supplies began eroding adherence to traditional ethno-cultural diets, and the health consequences of pleasure-based diets were becoming apparent. As Matt Fitzgerald describes it:

Many fad diets, at the time called &quot;foodie&quot;, were promoted during the 19th century.
Lord Byron was obsessed with his appearance, as he had a &quot;morbid propensity to fatten&quot;. He tried several diets, such as his favorite meal of biscuits and soda water, and others which he devised, such as the &quot;vinegar and water diet&quot; in the 1820s, which was very popular at the time, and involved drinking water with apple cider vinegar. He would cycle perpetually between self starvation, measurements, and binge eating. His influence was such that he was accused of encouraging melancholia and emotional volatility on Romantic youth, making girls &quot;sicken and waste away&quot;. Indeed, according to Byron, &quot;a woman should never be seen eating or drinking, unless it be lobster salad and champagne, the only truly feminine and becoming viands&quot;. His views on women&#x27;s diets and appearances worried his contemporaries, such as the American physician George Miller Beard, who fretted that young ladies may live their growing girlhood in semi-starvation because of their fears of &quot;incurring the horror of disciples of Lord Byron&quot;.

In 1825, Jean Brillat-Savarin wrote about a low carbohydrate diet and focusing on chewing and swallowing to better taste food and supposedly eat less. This idea would later reappear in 1903 under the name of &quot;Fletcherizing&quot;, derived from its author&#x27;s name Horace Fletcher, &quot;a self-taught nutritionist&quot;. Fletcher promoted chewing all food until it was thoroughly mixed with saliva, to the point that it was swallowed in a liquid state.

&quot;Banting&quot; or &quot;to bant&quot; became a highly popular synonym of dieting in 1863, when William Banting published &quot;A Letter on Corpulence&quot;, which detailed the first known low-carbohydrate diet, which he followed from Dr. William Harvey, a surgeon known for a starch- and sugar-free diet treatment for diabetes. He immediately lost weight, from 202 to 156 pounds eventually. Banting is credited for writing the first diet book, which at his death in 1878 sold more than 58,000 copies over a total of 12 editions published between 1863 and 1902. Although the 2500 copies of the first and second editions were printed at his expenses and distributed for free, in the hopes of &quot;benefitting to the working-class people&quot;, he sold later copies.

Around the same time, Sylvester Graham, of Graham cracker fame, is often given credit for creating the first fad diet in the 1830s and is considered the father of all modern diets. The diet recognized the importance of whole grains food. Designed from a religious motivation, Graham promoted a raw-food vegetarian diet that was lower in salt and fat, emphasizing an anti-industrial, anti-medical &quot;simpler&quot; or &quot;natural&quot; lifestyle, opposing the meat and other rich, calorie-dense foods produced in great quantities in the industrial era, declaring them &quot;sinful&quot;. In 1830, he was appointed a general agent of the Pennsylvanian Temperance Society. During his time there, and due to his history, and inspired by the French vitalist school of medicine, he thought nutrition had moral as well as physical qualities, and viewed any desire for food or drink not due to necessity (stark hunger or thirst) to be . Consequently, he viewed gluttony as the debilitating consequence of an unhealthy urge. He was determined to fight against what he perceived as nutritional &quot;debauchery&quot; and gluttony. He became a controversial figure, an evangelical New England preacher and speaker, with his spartan views on nutrition at a time where Americans&#x27; diets were primarily made of meat and white bread, by advocating adamantly in favor of raw vegetarian food and whole-grain food, authorizing but limiting meat, and forbidding highly refined or commercially baked white bread. He also described the use of corsets as &quot;disfiguring&quot; and advocated loose, comfortable clothing, which further attracted women to his precepts. After his death in 1851, his followers, dubbed &quot;Grahamites&quot;, most of them being women but also including famous men such as John Harvey Kellogg of cornflakes fame, continued to advocate vegetarianism, temperance, and bran bread. Graham&#x27;s ideas proved to have a lasting influence on American diet, as the per capita meat consumption dropped gradually in the subsequent years, whereas vegetable consumption increased and Americans started to eat more balanced diets.
The 19th century also saw the first and one of the most dangerous fad diet pills, with the marketing of arsenic pills for weight loss, which not only did not work, but which dieters often consumed more quantity than the prescribed dosage. Some diet hoaxes also appeared, such as the tapeworms diet, where the dieters would purportedly willfully ingest tapeworms in the hopes they would reach maturity in the intestines and absorb food, until the dieter attains the weight loss goal and consumes an anti-parasitic pill to kill and hopefully excrete the worms, if the dieter was lucky enough to not experience gastric obstruction.

===20th century===
The concept calorie restriction appeared under the name of &quot;calorie counting&quot; in the 1917 book &quot;Diet and Health, With Key to the Calories&quot; by Lulu Hunt Peters.

Other fad diets appeared in the 1930s. The grapefruit diet was a low-calorie plan, which became popular and known as the &quot;Hollywood diet&quot;, and involved eating grapefruit or its juice with other items such as toast or eggs, totaling about 500 calories per day. Such liquid diets, cleanses and detox diets would prove popular over the following decades with the Master Cleanse or Lemonade Diet in 1941 and Last Chance Diet in 1976. Around the same time, in 1925, Lucky Strike launched the &quot;cigarette diet&quot;, relying on the appetite-suppressing effect of nicotine, with the famous marketing slogan &quot;Reach for a Lucky instead of a sweet&quot;. The use of amphetamines, initially designed to treat narcolepsy, skyrocketed when doctors began prescribing them for appetite suppression and the treatment of depression, becoming a high success in the diet industry. Despite the American Medical Association opposing this use of amphetamines as early as 1943 due to problems of addiction, doctors continued to prescribe them, in addition to barbiturates to reduce the addiction cravings. The first liquid protein diet appeared also in the 1930s with the marketing of the &quot;Dr. Stoll&#x27;s Aid&quot;.

In 1950, another liquid diet appears, the &quot;cabbage soup diet&quot;, highly restrictive but promising great weight loss in the first week, at the expense of causing flatulence. Later, and although it did not become a fad for another generation, the Zen macrobiotic diet was developed by the Japanese philosopher George Ohsawa, purporting a &quot;yin and yang of food&quot; to help maintain the body&#x27;s balance, and proposing a grain-heavy diet composed of 50–60% of whole grains (e.g., brown rice), discouraging refined or processed food and certain cooking techniques and utensils.

Bernarr Macfadden was another major figure of dieting in the 20th century, taking the legacy of Graham. Macfadden relentlessly promoted a dieting philosophy named &quot;physical culture&quot;, the idea that nearly all diseases were caused by toxins in the blood from poor diet and lack of exercise, and that nearly all diseases could be cured through fasting, eating the correct foods, and physical exercise. Macfadden was one of the most effective promoter of diets in history, as he is believed by historians to be largely at the root of 20th- and 21st-century health and fitness practices in America. He became convinced that all health issues were due to nutrition. He advocated a diet similar to that avocated by Graham, plus regular fasting. His demise happened as a consequence of his extreme devotion to his own ideas: since he was convinced fasting could cure any ailment, he tried to treat a urinary tract blockage he developed in 1955 by fasting, which only caused emaciation which no doctor could undo.

Other notable food faddists of this era include Paul Bragg, Adelle Davis, and J. I. Rodale.

In 1961, Jean Nidetch founded the Weight Watchers. In 1970, the &quot;sleeping beauty diet&quot;, using sedative pills to avoid eating, became popular. Slim Fast appeared in 1977, claimed as a &quot;super diet&quot; by having shakes for breakfast and lunch. In 1985, Fit for Life promotes a diet forbidding complex carbohydrates and proteins in the same meal. In 1992, 1995, and 2003, the Atkins diet, Zone diet and South Beach Diets appear successively. The Atkins diet has been described as &quot;one of the most popular fad diets in the United States&quot;.

In 1997, the American Heart Association (AHA) &quot;declares war on fad diets [...] to inform the public of misleading weight loss claims&quot;.

===21st century===
During the early 2000s, the Paleolithic diet was popularized by Loren Cordain and has attracted a largely internet-based following on forums and social media, in part a tradition of venerating &#x27;primitive&#x27; diets and ways of life. This modern fad diet consists of foods thought to mirror those eaten during the Paleolithic era.

The very dangerous cotton ball diet surfaced in 2013, prompting dieters to eat up to five cotton balls at a time to lower hunger, leading to intestinal occlusion and potentially death. Aseem Malhotra has promoted a low-carbohydrate fad diet known as the Pioppi diet. It was named by the British Dietetic Association as one of the &quot;top 5 worst celeb diets to avoid in 2018&quot;.

A recent fad diet promoted on social media platforms is the carnivore diet that involves eating only animal products. There is no clinical evidence that the carnivore diet provides any health benefits. Other recent fad diets include the lectin-free diet that has been promoted by Steven Gundry and the pegan diet of Mark Hyman.

== Marketing ==
Most fad diets promote their plans as being derived from religion or science. Fad diets may be completely based on pseudoscience (e.g., &quot;fat-burning&quot; foods or notions of vitalism); most fad diets are marketed or described with exaggerated claims, not sustainable in sound science, about the benefits of eating a certain way or the harms of eating other ways.

Such diets are often endorsed by celebrities or celebrity doctors who style themselves as &quot;gurus&quot; and profit from sales of branded products, books, and public speaking. One sign of commercial fad diets is a requirement to purchase associated products and pay to attend seminars in order to gain the benefits of the diet.

The audience for these diets is people who want to lose weight quickly or who want to be healthy and find that belonging to a group of people defined by a strict way of eating helps them to avoid the many bad food choices available in the developed world.

Regardless of their evidence base, or lack thereof, fad diets are extremely popular, with over 1500 books published each year, and many consumers willing to pay for diet products, making for an industry worth $35 billion/year in the US. About 14–15% Americans declare having used a fad diet for short-term weight loss. Fad diet is a part of the diet industry with no specific estimation available, with the biggest part being &quot;diet foods&quot; such as light soda, for a total diet industry worth $35 billion/year in the USA.

An analysis of the top trending diet-related queries on Google&#x27;s search engine between 2006 and 2016 reveals that diet practices are highly variable and ever changing.

== Society and culture ==
According to the American Heart Association, a liquid very-low-calorie diet caused at least 60 deaths in 1977.

In Sweden, in 2005, the Atkins diet was at the crux of a controversy, when dietician started recommending it to her diabetic patients, which prompted an investigation by the Swedish National Institute of Public Health ().

== List of fad diets ==

Fad diets are a subset of all named or defined diets, typically identified by being associated by a founding person or organization, making health claims, most often of rapid weight loss.

<text>Rotation in mathematics is a concept originating in geometry. Any rotation is a motion of a certain space that preserves at least one point. It can describe, for example, the motion of a rigid body around a fixed point. Rotation can have a sign (as in the sign of an angle): a clockwise rotation is a negative magnitude so a counterclockwise turn has a positive magnitude.
A rotation is different from other types of motions: translations, which have no fixed points, and (hyperplane) reflections, each of them having an entire -dimensional flat of fixed points in a -dimensional space.

Mathematically, a rotation is a map. All rotations about a fixed point form a group under composition called the rotation group (of a particular space). But in mechanics and, more generally, in physics, this concept is frequently understood as a coordinate transformation (importantly, a transformation of an orthonormal basis), because for any motion of a body there is an inverse transformation which if applied to the frame of reference results in the body being at the same coordinates. For example, in two dimensions rotating a body clockwise about a point keeping the axes fixed is equivalent to rotating the axes counterclockwise about the same point while the body is kept fixed. These two types of rotation are called active and passive transformations.

==Related definitions and terminology==
The &quot;rotation group&quot; is a Lie group of rotations about a fixed point. This (common) fixed point or center is called the center of rotation and is usually identified with the origin. The rotation group is a &quot;point stabilizer&quot; in a broader group of (orientation-preserving) motions.

For a particular rotation:
* The &quot;axis of rotation&quot; is a line of its fixed points. They exist only in .
* The &quot;plane of rotation&quot; is a plane that is invariant under the rotation. Unlike the axis, its points are not fixed themselves. The axis (where present) and the plane of a rotation are orthogonal.

A &quot;representation&quot; of rotations is a particular formalism, either algebraic or geometric, used to parametrize a rotation map. This meaning is somehow inverse to the meaning in the group theory.

Rotations of (affine) spaces of points and of respective vector spaces are not always clearly distinguished. The former are sometimes referred to as &quot;affine rotations&quot; (although the term is misleading), whereas the latter are &quot;vector rotations&quot;. See the article below for details.

==Definitions and representations==
===In Euclidean geometry===

A motion of a Euclidean space is the same as its isometry: it leaves the distance between any two points unchanged after the transformation. But a (proper) rotation also has to preserve the orientation structure. The &quot;improper rotation&quot; term refers to isometries that reverse (flip) the orientation. In the language of group theory the distinction is expressed as &quot;direct&quot; vs &quot;indirect&quot; isometries in the Euclidean group, where the former comprise the identity component. Any direct Euclidean motion can be represented as a composition of a rotation about the fixed point and a translation.

In one-dimensional space, there are only trivial rotations. In two dimensions, only a single angle is needed to specify a rotation about the origin – the &quot;angle of rotation&quot; that specifies an element of the circle group (also known as ). The rotation is acting to rotate an object counterclockwise through an angle about the origin; see below for details. Composition of rotations sums their angles modulo 1 turn, which implies that all two-dimensional rotations about &quot;the same&quot; point commute. Rotations about &quot;different&quot; points, in general, do not commute. Any two-dimensional direct motion is either a translation or a rotation; see Euclidean plane isometry for details.
Rotations in three-dimensional space differ from those in two dimensions in a number of important ways. Rotations in three dimensions are generally not commutative, so the order in which rotations are applied is important even about the same point. Also, unlike the two-dimensional case, a three-dimensional direct motion, in general position, is not a rotation but a screw operation. Rotations about the origin have three degrees of freedom (see rotation formalisms in three dimensions for details), the same as the number of dimensions.
A three-dimensional rotation can be specified in a number of ways. The most usual methods are:
* Euler angles (pictured at the left). Any rotation about the origin can be represented as the composition of three rotations defined as the motion obtained by changing one of the Euler angles while leaving the other two constant. They constitute a mixed axes of rotation system because angles are measured with respect to a mix of different reference frames, rather than a single frame that is purely external or purely intrinsic. Specifically, the first angle moves the line of nodes around the external axis &quot;z&quot;, the second rotates around the line of nodes and the third is an intrinsic rotation (a spin) around an axis fixed in the body that moves. Euler angles are typically denoted as &quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;, &quot;γ&quot;, or &quot;φ&quot;, &quot;θ&quot;, &quot;ψ&quot;. This presentation is convenient only for rotations about a fixed point.

* Axis–angle representation (pictured at the right) specifies an angle with the axis about which the rotation takes place. It can be easily visualised. There are two variants to represent it:
** as a pair consisting of the angle and a unit vector for the axis, or
** as a Euclidean vector obtained by multiplying the angle with this unit vector, called the &quot;rotation vector&quot; (although, strictly speaking, it is a pseudovector).
* Matrices, versors (quaternions), and other algebraic things: see the section &quot;Linear and Multilinear Algebra Formalism&quot; for details.
A general rotation in four dimensions has only one fixed point, the centre of rotation, and no axis of rotation; see rotations in 4-dimensional Euclidean space for details. Instead the rotation has two mutually orthogonal planes of rotation, each of which is fixed in the sense that points in each plane stay within the planes. The rotation has two angles of rotation, one for each plane of rotation, through which points in the planes rotate. If these are and then all points not in the planes rotate through an angle between and . Rotations in four dimensions about a fixed point have six degrees of freedom. A four-dimensional direct motion in general position &quot;is&quot; a rotation about certain point (as in all even Euclidean dimensions), but screw operations exist also.

===Linear and multilinear algebra formalism===

When one considers motions of the Euclidean space that preserve the origin, the distinction between points and vectors, important in pure mathematics, can be erased because there is a canonical one-to-one correspondence between points and position vectors. The same is true for geometries other than Euclidean, but whose space is an affine space with a supplementary structure; see an example below. Alternatively, the vector description of rotations can be understood as a parametrization of geometric rotations up to their composition with translations. In other words, one vector rotation presents many equivalent rotations about &quot;all&quot; points in the space.

A motion that preserves the origin is the same as a linear operator on vectors that preserves the same geometric structure but expressed in terms of vectors. For Euclidean vectors, this expression is their &quot;magnitude&quot; (Euclidean norm). In components, such operator is expressed with orthogonal matrix that is multiplied to column vectors.

As it was already stated, a (proper) rotation is different from an arbitrary fixed-point motion in its preservation of the orientation of the vector space. Thus, the determinant of a rotation orthogonal matrix must be 1. The only other possibility for the determinant of an orthogonal matrix is , and this result means the transformation is a hyperplane reflection, a point reflection (for odd ), or another kind of improper rotation. Matrices of all proper rotations form the special orthogonal group.

====Two dimensions====

In two dimensions, to carry out a rotation using a matrix, the point to be rotated counterclockwise is written as a column vector, then multiplied by a rotation matrix calculated from the angle :

:formula_1.

The coordinates of the point after rotation are , and the formulae for and are

:formula_2

The vectors formula_3 and formula_4 have the same magnitude and are separated by an angle as expected.
Points on the plane can be also presented as complex numbers: the point in the plane is represented by the complex number

:formula_5

This can be rotated through an angle by multiplying it by , then expanding the product using Euler&#x27;s formula as follows:

:formula_6

and equating real and imaginary parts gives the same result as a two-dimensional matrix:

:formula_2

Since complex numbers form a commutative ring, vector rotations in two dimensions are commutative, unlike in higher dimensions. They have only one degree of freedom, as such rotations are entirely determined by the angle of rotation.

====Three dimensions====


As in two dimensions, a matrix can be used to rotate a point to a point . The matrix used is a matrix,

: formula_8

This is multiplied by a vector representing the point to give the result

:formula_9

The set of all appropriate matrices together with the operation of matrix multiplication is the rotation group SO(3). The matrix is a member of the three-dimensional special orthogonal group, , that is it is an orthogonal matrix with determinant 1. That it is an orthogonal matrix means that its rows are a set of orthogonal unit vectors (so they are an orthonormal basis) as are its columns, making it simple to spot and check if a matrix is a valid rotation matrix.

Above-mentioned Euler angles and axis–angle representations can be easily converted to a rotation matrix.

Another possibility to represent a rotation of three-dimensional Euclidean vectors are quaternions described below.

====Quaternions====
Unit quaternions, or &quot;versors&quot;, are in some ways the least intuitive representation of three-dimensional rotations. They are not the three-dimensional instance of a general approach. They are more compact than matrices and easier to work with than all other methods, so are often preferred in real-world applications.

A versor (also called a &quot;rotation quaternion&quot;) consists of four real numbers, constrained so the norm of the quaternion is 1. This constraint limits the degrees of freedom of the quaternion to three, as required. Unlike matrices and complex numbers two multiplications are needed:

:formula_10

where is the versor, is its inverse, and is the vector treated as a quaternion with zero scalar part. The quaternion can be related to the rotation vector form of the axis angle rotation by the exponential map over the quaternions,

:formula_11

where is the rotation vector treated as a quaternion.

A single multiplication by a versor, either left or right, is itself a rotation, but in four dimensions. Any four-dimensional rotation about the origin can be represented with two quaternion multiplications: one left and one right, by two &quot;different&quot; unit quaternions.

====Further notes====
More generally, coordinate rotations in any dimension are represented by orthogonal matrices. The set of all orthogonal matrices in dimensions which describe proper rotations (determinant = +1), together with the operation of matrix multiplication, forms the special orthogonal group .

Matrices are often used for doing transformations, especially when a large number of points are being transformed, as they are a direct representation of the linear operator. Rotations represented in other ways are often converted to matrices before being used. They can be extended to represent rotations and transformations at the same time using homogeneous coordinates. Projective transformations are represented by matrices. They are not rotation matrices, but a transformation that represents a Euclidean rotation has a rotation matrix in the upper left corner.

The main disadvantage of matrices is that they are more expensive to calculate and do calculations with. Also in calculations where numerical instability is a concern matrices can be more prone to it, so calculations to restore orthonormality, which are expensive to do for matrices, need to be done more often.

====More alternatives to the matrix formalism====
As was demonstrated above, there exist three multilinear algebra rotation formalisms: one with U(1), or complex numbers, for two dimensions, and two others with versors, or quaternions, for three and four dimensions.

In general (even for vectors equipped with a non-Euclidean Minkowski quadratic form) the rotation of a vector space can be expressed as a bivector. This formalism is used in geometric algebra and, more generally, in the Clifford algebra representation of Lie groups.

In the case of a positive-definite Euclidean quadratic form, the double covering group of the isometry group formula_12 is known as the Spin group, formula_13. It can be conveniently described in terms of a Clifford algebra. Unit quaternions give the group formula_14.

===In non-Euclidean geometries===
In spherical geometry, a direct motion of the -sphere (an example of the elliptic geometry) is the same as a rotation of -dimensional Euclidean space about the origin (). For odd , most of these motions do not have fixed points on the -sphere and, strictly speaking, are not rotations &quot;of the sphere&quot;; such motions are sometimes referred to as &quot;Clifford translations&quot;. Rotations about a fixed point in elliptic and hyperbolic geometries are not different from Euclidean ones.

Affine geometry and projective geometry have not a distinct notion of rotation.

===In relativity===

A generalization of a rotation applies in special relativity, where it can be considered to operate on a four-dimensional space, spacetime, spanned by three space dimensions and one of time. In special relativity, this space is called Minkowski space, and the four-dimensional rotations, called Lorentz transformations, have a physical interpretation. These transformations preserve a quadratic form called the spacetime interval.

If a rotation of Minkowski space is in a space-like plane, then this rotation is the same as a spatial rotation in Euclidean space. By contrast, a rotation in a plane spanned by a space-like dimension and a time-like dimension is a hyperbolic rotation, and if this plane contains the time axis of the reference frame, is called a &quot;Lorentz boost&quot;. These transformations demonstrate the pseudo-Euclidean nature of the Minkowski space. Hyperbolic rotations are sometimes described as &quot;squeeze mappings&quot; and frequently appear on Minkowski diagrams that visualize (1 + 1)-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean geometry on planar drawings. The study of relativity deals with the Lorentz group generated by the space rotations and hyperbolic rotations.

Whereas rotations, in physics and astronomy, correspond to rotations of celestial sphere as a 2-sphere in the Euclidean 3-space, Lorentz transformations from induce conformal transformations of the celestial sphere. It is a broader class of the sphere transformations known as Möbius transformations.

===Discrete rotations===

==Importance==
Rotations define important classes of symmetry: rotational symmetry is an invariance with respect to a &quot;particular rotation&quot;. The circular symmetry is an invariance with respect to all rotation about the fixed axis.

As was stated above, Euclidean rotations are applied to rigid body dynamics. Moreover, most of mathematical formalism in physics (such as the vector calculus) is rotation-invariant; see rotation for more physical aspects. Euclidean rotations and, more generally, Lorentz symmetry described above are thought to be symmetry laws of nature. In contrast, the reflectional symmetry is not a precise symmetry law of nature.

==Generalizations==

The complex-valued matrices analogous to real orthogonal matrices are the unitary matrices formula_15, which represent rotations in complex space. The set of all unitary matrices in a given dimension forms a unitary group formula_15 of degree ; and its subgroup representing proper rotations (those that preserve the orientation of space) is the special unitary group formula_17 of degree . These complex rotations are important in the context of spinors. The elements of formula_18 are used to parametrize &quot;three&quot;-dimensional Euclidean rotations (see above), as well as respective transformations of the spin (see representation theory of SU(2)).

<text>An arctometatarsalian organism is one in which the proximal part of the middle metatarsal is pinched between the surrounding metatarsals. The trait appears to be highly homoplastic, common in certain sorts of dinosaurs accustomed to running (among them the tyrannosauroids, ornithomimosaurs, and troodontids), to evenly transmit force to the metatarsals.

<text>In music, extended technique is unconventional, unorthodox, or non-traditional methods of singing or of playing musical instruments employed to obtain unusual sounds or timbres.

Composers’ use of extended techniques is not specific to contemporary music (for instance, Hector Berlioz’s use of &quot;col legno&quot; in his &quot;Symphonie Fantastique&quot; is an extended technique) and it transcends compositional schools and styles. Extended techniques have also flourished in popular music. Nearly all jazz performers make significant use of extended techniques of one sort or another, particularly in more recent styles like free jazz or avant-garde jazz. Musicians in free improvisation have also made heavy use of extended techniques.

Examples of extended techniques include bowing under the bridge of a string instrument or with two different bows, using key clicks on a wind instrument, blowing and overblowing into a wind instrument without a mouthpiece, or inserting objects on top of the strings of a piano.

Twentieth-century exponents of extended techniques include Henry Cowell (use of fists and arms on the keyboard, playing inside the piano), John Cage (prepared piano), and George Crumb. The Kronos Quartet, which has been among the most active ensembles in promoting contemporary American works for string quartet, frequently plays music which stretches the manner in which sound can be drawn out of instruments.

== Examples ==

=== Vocal ===

* Sprechstimme (speech-singing)
* overtone singing (harmonic singing, or vocal multiphonics)
* ululation
* beatboxing (vocal percussionists)
* growling
* screaming and shouting
* whispering
* panting
* whistling
* hissing
* clucking
* barking
* sucking

=== Bowed string instruments ===
* playing with a plectrum or pick
* playing with percussion sticks, mallets, or other objects
* bowing on the &quot;wrong&quot; side of the left hand fingers
* bowing behind the bridge
* bowing non-string parts of the instrument
* parallel rather than perpendicular bowing
* exaggerated vibrato
* snap pizzicato, also called Bartók pizzicato
* tapping or rubbing the soundboard of stringed instruments
* string scrapes with finger, nail, or object
* percussive effects on body of instrument
* tapping on the fingerboard
* &quot;seagull&quot; harmonic effects
* detuning a string while playing
* preparation
* resonance effects

=== Plucked string instruments ===
* using a bow
* playing with percussion sticks, mallets, or other objects
* playing on crossed strings (called &quot;snare drum effect&quot; on guitar)
* snap pizzicato, in which a string is pulled away from the fingerboard until it snaps back and strikes the fingerboard.
* string scrapes, a technique especially associated with electric guitar and electric bass, as played with a pick.
* percussive effects, such as drumming on a string instrument body 
* palm and finger muting (&quot;pizzicato&quot;)
* tapping on the fingerboard
* string pops and slaps (fingerboard instruments)
* preparation of a guitar by inserting screws or pieces of metal in the bridge or between the strings.
* detuning a string while playing
* &quot;3rd bridge&quot;, a guitar technique using the part of the string between the nut and the stopping finger; see Xenakis&#x27; cello piece &quot;Nomos Alpha&quot; for a similar effect.

=== Piano ===

* prepared piano, i.e., introducing foreign objects into the workings of the piano to change the sound quality
* string piano, i.e., striking, plucking, or bowing the strings directly, or any other direct manipulation of the strings
* resonance effects (whistling, singing or talking into the piano)
* silently depressing one or more keys, allowing the corresponding strings to vibrate freely, allowing sympathetic harmonics to sound
* touching the strings at node points to create harmonics
* percussive use of different parts of the piano, such as the outer rim
** slamming piano lid or keyboard cover
* microtones
* use of the palms, fists, or external devices to create tone clusters
* use of other materials to strike the keys
* pedal noises

=== Woodwind instruments ===
* multiphonics
* harmonics
* pitch bends (&quot;lipping&quot;)
* noisily activating keys without blowing
* combination of a mouthpiece of one instrument with the main body of another, for example, using an alto saxophone mouthpiece on a standard trombone.
* flutter-tonguing, 
* breath noises
* blowing a disengaged mouthpiece or reed
* singing through the instrument while playing
* internal muting
* key or tone-hole slap – percussive sound made by slapping a key or keys against their tone holes
* circular breathing

=== Brass instruments ===
* singing through the instrument while playing
* exaggerated brass head-shakes
* noisily activating valves without blowing
* pitch bends (&quot;lipping&quot;)
* combination of a mouthpiece of one instrument with the main body of another, for example, using a French horn mouthpiece on a standard bassoon
* flutter tonguing
* circular breathing
* double buzz
* half-valve playing
* unconventional mutes or other foreign objects in the bell (e.g. plumbing parts)
* breath noises
* slap tonguing
* blowing a disengaged mouthpiece

===Percussion===
* rudimental or &quot;dynamic&quot; double bass on the drum set, using hand rudiments such as double stroke rolls and flam taps and playing them with the feet
* stacking 2 or more cymbals, one on top of the other, to change the sound properties of the instrument
* bowed vibraphone, cymbals, and gongs
* resonance effects (e.g., cymbal played on a timpani; cow bell struck against a bass drum, etc.)
* pitch bends on mallet percussion
* harmonics
* custom-built percussion mallets, occasionally made for vibraphone or tubular bells (and other pitched-percussion in increasingly rare circumstances) which feature more than one mallet-head, and so are capable of producing multiple pitches and difficult chords (though usually only the chords they were designed to play). These mallets are seldom used, and percussionists sometimes make them themselves when they are needed. When implemented, they are usually only used once or twice in an entire work, and are alternated with conventional mallets; usually they are used only when playing a different instrument in each hand.
* striking a gong and then inserting the vibrating metal into a tub of water, creating a glissando.
* placing a cymbal on a timpani head

=== Electronic ===
* added electronics or MIDI control
* Turntablism, such as scratching records or otherwise manipulating a record or turntable platter, often done in combination with a DJ mixer, to create unique sound effects and rhythms
* Using a &quot;kill switch&quot; on an electric guitar to create quasi-scratching rhythmic sounds.
* Circuit bending: DIY experimenting with electronic keyboards and electronic toys.
* playing electric instruments unplugged, or amplifying acoustical parts of normally electronic instruments (e.g. finger noise on the keys)
* exploitation of inherent equipment &quot;defects&quot; (e.g., deliberately driving digital equipment into aliasing; exaggerating hum or hiss coming from speakers, acoustic feedback, key click on a Hammond organ etc.)

=== Organ ===
Playing on stops that are partially drawn (has an effect only if the stops are on purely mechanical action, with a slider windchest).
Manipulating stops while holding one or more notes (possible on most organs, but most effective if the stops are on purely mechanical action, with a slider chest).

<doc id="410016" wikidata="Q570216" url="?curid=410016" title="Mac OS X Jaguar">
<text>Mac OS X Jaguar (version 10.2) is the third major release of macOS, Apple&#x27;s desktop and server operating system. It superseded Mac OS X 10.1 and preceded Mac OS X Panther. The operating system was released on August 23, 2002. It was available both for single-computer installations and in a &quot;family pack&quot; that allowed five installations on separate computers in one household. Jaguar was the first Mac OS X release to publicly use its code name in marketing and advertisements.

==System requirements==
Mac OS X Jaguar requires a PowerPC G3 or G4 CPU and 128 MB of RAM. Special builds were released for the first PowerPC G5 systems released by Apple.

==New and changed features==
Jaguar introduced many new features to Mac OS X, which are still supported to this day, including MPEG-4 support in QuickTime, Address Book, and Inkwell for handwriting recognition. It also included the first release of Apple&#x27;s Zeroconf implementation, Rendezvous (later renamed to Bonjour), which allows devices on the same network to automatically discover each other and offer available services, such as file sharing, shared scanners, and printers, to the user.

Mac OS X Jaguar Server 10.2.2 added journaling to HFS Plus, the native Macintosh file system, to add increased reliability and data recovery features. This was later added to the standard Mac OS X in version 10.3 Panther.

Jaguar saw the debut of Quartz Extreme, a technology used to composite graphics directly on the video card, without the use of software to composite windows. The technology allotted the task of drawing the 3D surface of windows to the video card, rather than to the CPU, to increase interface responsiveness and performance.

Universal Access was added to allow the Macintosh to be usable by disabled computer users.

The user interface of Jaguar was also updated to add search features to the Finder, powered by Sherlock 3.

Internally, Jaguar also added the Common Unix Printing System (also known as CUPS), a modular printing system for Unix-like operating systems, and improved support for Microsoft Windows networks using the open-source Samba as a server for the SMB remote file access protocol and a FreeBSD-derived virtual file system module as a client for SMB.

The Happy Mac startup icon that was introduced with the original Macintosh was replaced with a grey Apple logo. The gray startup screen was used up until OS X Yosemite.

==Marketing==
Jaguar was a $129 upgrade for both Mac OS 9 and existing Mac OS X users. In October 2002, Apple offered free copies of Jaguar to all U.S. K-12 teachers as part of the &quot;X For Teachers&quot; program. Teachers who wanted to get a copy had to fill out a form and a packet containing Mac OS X installation discs and manuals was then shipped to the school where they taught.

Jaguar was the first version of Mac OS X to use its internal codename as the official name of the operating system. To that effect, the retail packaging featured computer-generated jaguar fur designed by animation studio Pixar.

Starting with Jaguar, Mac OS X releases were given a feline-related marketing name upon announcement until the introduction of OS X Mavericks in June 2013, at which point releases began to be named after locations in California, where Apple is headquartered. Mac OS X (rebranded as OS X in 2011 and later macOS in 2016) releases are now also referred to by their marketing name, in addition to version numbers.

==Release history==
Mac OS X 10.2.7 (codenames Blackrider, Smeagol) was only available to the new Power Mac G5s and aluminum PowerBook G4s released before Mac OS X Panther. It was never officially released to the general public.

Mac OS X 10.2.8 is the last version of Mac OS X officially supported on the &quot;Beige G3&quot; desktop, minitower, and all-in-one systems as well as the PowerBook G3 Series (1998) also known as Wallstreet/PDQ; though later releases can be run on such Macs with the help of unofficial, unlicensed, and unsupported third-party tools such as XPostFacto.

<doc id="410024" wikidata="Q337384" url="?curid=410024" title="Peter Høeg">
<text>Peter Høeg (born 17 May 1957) is a Danish writer of fiction. He is best known for his novel &quot;Miss Smilla&#x27;s Feeling for Snow&quot; (1992).

==Early life==
Høeg was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. Before becoming a writer, he worked variously as a sailor, ballet dancer and actor (in addition to fencing and mountaineering)—experiences that he uses in his novels. He studied literature at the University of Copenhagen under Peter Brask, a Danish literary scholar, composer and author. After a personal crisis, he spent a year working as a sailor on wealthy people&#x27;s yachts, before returning to graduate with a Master of Arts in Literature from the University of Copenhagen in 1984.

==Career==
Peter Høeg published his first novel, &quot;A History of Danish Dreams&quot;, in 1988 to very positive reviews. He decided at that stage to protect his personal life. Over the next five years he wrote and published the short story collection &quot;Tales of Night&quot;, and the novels: &quot;Miss Smilla&#x27;s Feeling for Snow&quot; (1992), &quot;Borderliners&quot; (1993). It was &quot;Miss Smilla&#x27;s Feeling for Snow&quot; that earned Høeg immediate and international literary celebrity. In 1993 he won the Danish booksellers award De Gyldne Laurbær (The Golden Laurel) and the Danish Critics Prize for Literature for his book &quot;De måske egnede&quot; (English title: &quot;Borderliners&quot;).

Høeg virtually disappeared in 1996 after the lukewarm reception of &quot;The Woman and the Ape&quot;.

===Return and &quot;The Quiet Girl&quot; controversy===
Høeg resurfaced in 2006 with &quot;The Quiet Girl&quot;, his first novel in 10 years. At the time of its publication, its reception in Denmark was mixed at best, and the novel was generally disregarded as being either too complex or too postmodern.

Høeg was surprised by the response and has since said the complexity of the book was nowhere near that of films like &quot;Inception&quot; or &quot;Memento&quot;. Norwegian author Jan Kjærstad defended the book, saying: &quot;it surprises me that a novel written by someone of Peter Høeg’s calibre, with such great intelligence, so much thought and originality, should be treated to such outpourings of pettiness and virulence. How could such a rollicking, generous, open book be greeted with so much gravity and severity, such closed minds and again: in my broad-minded old Denmark?&quot;

In October 2007, the Danish literary critic Poul Behrendt published a book entitled &quot;Den Hemmelige Note: Ti kapitler om små ting der forandrer alt&quot; (&quot;The Secret Note: Ten Chapters on Little Things That Change Everything&quot;), in which he explains that the cold reception of &quot;The Quiet Girl&quot; was due to its complexity and scope, which the critics, according to Behrendt, didn&#x27;t understand.

In 2014, his latest book, &quot;The Susan Effect&quot; (&quot;Effekten af Susan&quot;) was published in Denmark. The book is described by &quot;The Economist&quot; as a &quot;high-concept thriller&quot; featuring social breakdown, environmental disaster and atomic weapons in rogue hands.

==Style==

Høeg has a reputation for being hard to place in terms of literary style. All his works are stylistically very different from one another, and have been labelled postmodern, gothic, magical-realist, to mention a few. While &quot;Miss Smilla&quot;, for instance, was classified as Nordic noir, &quot;The Susan Effect&quot; featured magical elements such as in the case of the Svendsen family, which possessed one superpower or another in the narrative. There is a thread to be found, however, in terms of theme; Høeg&#x27;s work often seems to deal with the consequences of the progress of civilisation.

In an interview, Høeg said that he follows a contemplative approach to his writing practices and this involved a pattern &quot;of meditating, then writing, then meditating and then writing again.&quot;

==Personal life==
Høeg grew up in Copenhagen and lives now in Nørre Snede in Jutland. He has four children. In 1996 he established the Lolwe foundation which provides financial assistance to women and children in the third world, especially in Africa and Tibetan exile areas.

==Books==
Høeg&#x27;s books are published in Denmark by Munksgaard/Rosinante, now a part of Blackwell Publishing, and have also been published in more than 30 other countries.

<doc id="410036" wikidata="Q914247" url="?curid=410036" title="Dante's Peak">
<text>Dante&#x27;s Peak is a 1997 American disaster film directed by Roger Donaldson, written by Leslie Bohem, and starring Pierce Brosnan, Linda Hamilton, and Charles Hallahan. The film is set in the fictional town of Dante&#x27;s Peak where the inhabitants fight to survive the eruption of a long dormant stratovolcano that has suddenly become active again. The film was released on February 7, 1997, under the production of Universal Pictures and Pacific Western Productions. The release came just weeks prior to the similarly themed film, &quot;Volcano&quot;, starring Tommy Lee Jones, which came out in April of the same year.

It is the third film collaboration between Gale Anne Hurd and Hamilton, who both previously worked in the first two &quot;Terminator&quot; films.

==Plot==

In 1993, USGS volcanologist Harry Dalton and his partner-turned-fiancée Marianne attempt to escape an ongoing eruption in Colombia. As they venture out, a lava bomb smashes through the roof of the truck, killing Marianne.

Four years later, despite the trauma he suffered in the course of his employment, Harry is assigned by his superior Dr. Paul Dreyfus to investigate seismic activity near the town of Dante&#x27;s Peak, Washington, a town that borders a stratovolcano. There, Harry meets Mayor Rachel Wando with her children Graham and Lauren. Rachel offers to take Harry with them as they see her former mother-in-law Ruth, an elderly hermit who lives near the lake at the base of the volcano.

While exploring, they find dead trees, dead squirrels, and two people boiled to death in a hot spring. Harry stops Graham from jumping into the spring upon seeing the bodies. Harry instructs Paul to bring a USGS team to monitor the volcano, but their initial survey finds no indications of volcanic activity. Paul advises against Harry putting the town on alert. Still, Harry tries to convince Rachel to prepare for a disaster.

One day, Harry examines the summit&#x27;s crater until a rock slide traps his co-worker Terry, causing him to suffer a broken leg. Both men are rescued by helicopter. Days go by showing no signs of any threat or activity. Paul decides that no danger is imminent and the USGS team begins preparing to leave. When Harry goes to say goodbye to Rachel, they discover that the town&#x27;s water supply has been contaminated with sulfur dioxide. The next morning, seismic readings and sulfur levels rise dramatically. Convinced that the volcano will erupt and with the National Guard unavailable until the next day, Paul gives Harry permission to put the town on alert.

As a town meeting takes place at the high school, an earthquake strikes and the eruption begins. Harry and Rachel go to retrieve the children only to discover that they have gone to get Ruth, who refused to leave her home. Just as they reach the children and Ruth, a lava flow engulfs her cabin and destroys the vehicles both parties used to get there. The five flee across the lake in a motorboat, but the boat stops metres from the shore due to sulfur-containing volcanic gases reacting with the lake to make sulfuric acid, which destroys the motor and corrodes the boat&#x27;s steel hull, sinking it. Ruth jumps out of the boat to help it to shore, suffering chemical burns that eventually prove fatal. Harry and the Wandos take a four-wheel-drive Forest Service ranger&#x27;s truck to continue down the mountain and save Ruth&#x27;s dog Roughy while crossing a lava flow.

Meanwhile, the National Guard helps remaining townspeople and the USGS team evacuate. As they leave, a lahar created by the melting ice breaks the upstream dam. While the rest of the team gets across, Paul and his van fail to clear the bridge before it is washed away by the flood, throwing Paul overboard to his death.

Harry and the Wandos arrive at the remains of the town. Harry retrieves a distress radiobeacon from the USGS workshop and learns that the volcano is due for one last eruption. The volcano then undergoes a cataclysmic lateral blast, triggering a pyroclastic flow which obliterates everything in its path. With no way out of town, Harry and the Wandos reach an abandoned mine where Graham likes to hang out. The USGS team, watching the eruption from afar, presumes Harry to be dead. Inside the mine, Harry realizes that he left the beacon in the truck. When he goes back for it, aftershocks cause rocks to fall. Harry suffers a broken arm and is trapped in the truck, but manages to activate the beacon.

Days later, Terry notices that the beacon has been activated and the USGS dispatches search and rescue teams. Harry and the Wandos are freed from the mine, reunited with Harry&#x27;s team, and airlifted out by helicopter. The volcano&#x27;s upper half has been reduced to a Mount St. Helens–like volcanic crater.

==Production==
Principal photography began on May 6, 1996. The film was shot on location in Wallace, Idaho.

Exterior shots of the Point Dume Post Office in Malibu, California, were used as the USGS&#x27;s David A. Johnston Cascades Volcano Observatory headquarters in Vancouver, Washington. The facility was named in honor of David A. Johnston, a young scientist who had precisely predicted the volatility of the May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens eruption and perished during the event.

The scene involving the geological robot and the trapped scientist was shot inside the crater of Mount St. Helens, as evinced by a brief appearance of Mount Adams, a dormant peak east of Mount St. Helens, as the film focuses on the scientists. The scene itself was actually filmed on the tarmac of Van Nuys Airport, while the Mount Adams image was composited in later. Production was completed on August 31, 1996.

Extensive special effects surrounding certain aspects of the film, such as the lava and pyroclastic flows, were created by Digital Domain, Banned from the Ranch Entertainment, and CIS Hollywood. The computer-generated imagery was mostly coordinated and supervised by Patrick McClung, Roy Arbogast, Lori J. Nelson, Richard Stutsman, and Dean Miller. Although the film uses considerable amounts of CGI, the volcanic ash in the film was created using cellulose insulation manufactured by Regal Industries in Crothersville, Indiana. Between visuals, miniatures, and animation, over 300 technicians were directly involved in the production aspects of the special effects.

==Music==
The original score was co-composed by John Frizzell and James Newton Howard. Howard wrote the main theme (heard during the opening titles) and a number of cues, while Frizzell wrote the bulk of the score.

During this time, Frizzell was a fairly new film composer, as he had recently produced the scores for a few movies such as &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; and &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do America&quot;.

Thirty minutes of the score was released by Varèse Sarabande; the short album length being due to high orchestra fees at the time of release. An expanded bootleg exists that contains almost the entire score.

The contents of the CD release can also be found on the region 1 DVD, and Blu-ray on an alternate audio track during the &#x27;Creating a Volcano&#x27; documentary.

The &quot;Main Titles&quot; cue is also featured on Varèse&#x27;s &quot;The Towering Inferno and Other Disaster Classics&quot; compilation album.

==Release==
===Home media===
&quot;Dante&#x27;s Peak&quot; was released on VHS and LaserDisc on August 19, 1997.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was released on February 7, 1997 in 2,657 theatres. It debuted at #2 at the box office behind the special edition re-release of &quot;Star Wars&quot;; it took in $18 million in its opening weekend. After eight weeks in theatres, it had grossed $67.1 million in the United States and $111.0 million overseas, for a total of $178 million worldwide.

In South Korea, the film earned $776,000 from 30 locations during its opening, marking an improvement over &quot;Twister&quot;. It ranked in second place behind &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; in France, making an opening gross $2 million.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Dante&#x27;s Peak&quot; received mostly negative reviews compared to the generally mixed reviews of its rival. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 30% rating based on 33 reviews, compared to a 50% rating from 48 reviews for &quot;Volcano&quot; with an average score of 5/10. The consensus for &quot;Dante&#x27;s Peak&quot; states: &quot;The movie works when things are on fire, but everything else - from dialogue to characters - is scathingly bad.&quot;

Both Siskel and Ebert had mixed feelings about the film. Gene Siskel gave it two and a half stars out of four and wrote, &quot;It takes a full hour for the volcano to blow in &quot;Dante&#x27;s Peak&quot;, and when it does, the movie really starts to cook. The special effects of rivers of lava, snowstorms of volcanic ash and a river of acid water are top-notch. Can I recommend half of a movie?&quot; Roger Ebert also gave the film two and a half stars out of four and wrote, &quot;&quot;Dante&#x27;s Peak&quot; is constructed about as skillfully as a disaster movie can be, and there were times when I found it working for me, sort of. But hasn&#x27;t this genre pretty much been played out to the point of exhaustion?&quot;

===Geologists&#x27; reception and educational purpose===
The film attracted geologists to create dedicated &quot;information page&quot; to reach out to students interested in science, including the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the University of Maryland. The fact-checking on USGS&#x27;s information page concluded &quot;in many but not all respects, the movie&#x27;s depiction of eruptive hazards hits close to the mark&quot;. On the other hand, two professors at the Lewis-Clark State College panned the movie for understating the negative effects of a possible false alarm.

The film is also a popular film viewing and discussion in science classes in the United States.

<doc id="410041" wikidata="Q1377504" url="?curid=410041" title="Lionel Rose">
<text>Lionel Edmund Rose MBE (21 June 1948 – 8 May 2011) was an Australian professional boxer who competed from 1964 to 1976. He held the undisputed WBA, WBC, and &quot;The Ring&quot; bantamweight titles from 1968 to 1969, becoming the first Indigenous Australian to win a world title. He later became the first Indigenous Australian to be named Australian of the Year.

Rose was the 2003 inductee for the Australian National Boxing Hall of Fame &quot;moderns&quot; category and was the second person to be elevated to &quot;legend&quot; status in 2010.

==Background==
Born and raised at Jacksons Track in Victoria as well as the town of Warragul, Rose grew up in hardship and learned to box from his father, Roy, who was a skilled fighter at local house shows. Rose was of the Gunditjmara (Dhauwurd Wurrung) people.

Later, at the age of 10, Rose was given a pair of boxing gloves by his teacher, Ian Hawkins (who observed him shadow boxing). Aged about 15, he went under the tutelage of Frank Oakes, a Warragul trainer (whose daughter Jenny he later married). He won the Australian amateur flyweight title at 15. He was the godfather to model and actress Ruby Rose.

==Professional boxing career==
After missing selection for the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Rose began his professional boxing career at age 16, on 9 September 1964, outpointing Mario Magriss over eight rounds. This fight was in Warragul, but the majority of Rose&#x27;s fights were held in Melbourne. Along the way he was helped by Jack and Shirley Rennie, in whose Melbourne home he stayed, training every day in their backyard gym.

After five wins in a row, on 23 July 1965, Rose was rematched with Singtong Por Tor, whom he had beaten in a 12-round decision. Por Tor inflicted Rose&#x27;s first defeat, beating him on points in six rounds. On 14 October of the same year, he had his first fight abroad, beating Laurie Ny by a decision in 10 rounds at Christchurch, New Zealand.

Over his next nine fights, Rose had a record of eight wins and one loss, with one knockout. The lone loss in those nine fights was to Ray Perez, against whom Rose split a pair of bouts. Then at age 18, on 28 October 1966, he met Noel Kunde at Melbourne for the Australian bantamweight title. He won the title by defeating Kunde in a 15-round decision.

Rose won one more bout in 1966 and eight in 1967 (including a thirteenth-round knockout win against Rocky Gattellari to defend his Australian championship) before challenging Fighting Harada for the world bantamweight title on 26 February 1968 in Tokyo. Rose made history by becoming the first Aboriginal Australian to be a world champion boxer when he defeated Harada in a 15-round decision. This win made Rose an instant national hero in Australia and an icon among Aboriginal Australians. A public reception at Melbourne Town Hall was witnessed by a crowd of more than 10,000. On 2 July of that year, he returned to Tokyo to retain his title with a 15-round decision win over Takao Sakurai. Then, on 6 December, he met Chucho Castillo at the Inglewood Forum in Inglewood, California. Rose beat Castillo by decision, but the points verdict in favour of him infuriated many in the pro-Castillo crowd and a riot began: 14 fans and fight referee Dick Young were hospitalised for injuries received.

On 8 March 1969, Rose retained the title with a 15-round decision over Alan Rudkin, but five months later he returned to Inglewood, where he faced Rubén Olivares on 22 August. Rose lost the world bantamweight title to Olivares via a fifth-round knockout.

Rose continued boxing after his defeat against Olivares, but, after defeats against practically unknown fighters, many believed he was done as a prime fighter. However, he was far from finished: he upset future world lightweight champion Itshimatsu Suzuki on 10 October 1970 in a 10-round decision, and once again, he positioned himself as a world title challenger, albeit in the lightweight division, 17 pounds over the division where he crowned himself world champion.

Despite having lost to Jeff White for the Australian lightweight title, Rose got another world title try when he faced WBC world junior lightweight champion Yoshiaki Numata, on 30 May 1971 at Hiroshima. Numata beat Rose by a fifteen-round decision, and Rose announced his retirement soon after.

In 1975, he came back, but after losing four of his next six bouts, including one against Rafael Limón, Rose decided to retire for good. Rose compiled a record of 42 wins and 11 losses as a professional boxer, with 12 wins by knockout.

==Singing career==
During his time off from boxing in the 1970s, Rose embarked on a modest singing career in Australia having hits with &quot;I Thank You&quot; and &quot;Please Remember Me&quot; in 1970. Produced and written by Johnny Young and engineered by John L Sayers, the song &quot;I Thank You&quot; was a top 5 nationwide hit. Comedic sports commentators Roy Slaven and H.G. Nelson played it as a substitute to the Australian national anthem during radio broadcasts of the State of Origin series and other sporting events.

It is widely thought that Rose&#x27;s singing career didn&#x27;t give him time to get enough preparation training in, which is why he lost bouts against so many unknown fighters (after his loss to Ruben Olivares).

Rose sang &quot;Jackson Track&quot; and &quot;I Thank You&quot;, in both the SBS documentary and accompanying CD, &quot;Buried Country: The Story of Aboriginal Country Music&quot;.

===Singles===
==Retirement==
In retirement, Rose became a successful businessman, and he enjoyed the monetary benefits his career brought him. Rose was showcased in 2002 in &quot;The Ring&quot; section &#x27;Where are they now?&#x27;.

In 2007, Rose suffered a stroke that left him with speech and movement difficulties.

Rose died on 8 May 2011 after an illness which lasted for several months.

==Awards==
Rose was featured in Australian author: Wendy Lewis&#x27;s book of &quot;Australia&#x27;s Greatest People&quot; in 2010.

In 1968 Lionel Rose became the first Aboriginal Australian of the Year and was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the Birthday Honours List for services to sport.

In 1969 Lionel Rose was granted the &quot;Key to the City of Gold Coast&quot;, only the second recipient of the city&#x27;s highest honor.

In the 1960s, he won the Australian Amateur Flyweight title.

In 2003 he was an inaugural inductee in the Australian National Boxing Hall of Fame.

In 2005 he was featured on a stamp (part of the 2005 edition).

In 2005 Rose was also awarded the E9 title of &#x27;King of the Ring&#x27;.

In 2011 he was inducted to the Victorian Aboriginal Honour Roll.

==TV and film==
His life inspired the TV serial &quot;The Battlers&quot; (1968) about an Aboriginal boxer, played by Vincent Gill in blackface.

The TV miniseries &quot;Rose Against the Odds&quot; was produced in 1991 – a period drama of Rose&#x27;s life story starring Paul Williams and Telly Savalas. It was released as a feature film in 1995.

In 2008, after nearly three years of conducting interviews with Rose, his family and friends, Melbourne filmmaker Eddie Martin premiered his feature-length documentary &quot;Lionel&quot; at the Melbourne International Film Festival. After a brief theatrical run, a shorter version of the film premiered on SBS television on 28 November 2008.

<doc id="410046" wikidata="Q651141" url="?curid=410046" title="All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam">
<text>The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (; AIADMK) is an Indian regional political party with great influence in the state of Tamil Nadu and the union territory of Puducherry. It is a Dravidian party founded by the former chief minister of Tamil Nadu M. G. Ramachandran (M.G.R.) at Madurai on 17 October 1972 as a breakaway faction from the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam after M. Karunanidhi expelled him from the party for demanding an account as the party treasurer. The party is adhering to the policies of socialism and secularism based on the principles of C. N. Annadurai (Anna) collectively coined as &quot;Annaism&quot; by M.G.R. The party has won a seven-time majority in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly and has emerged as the most successful political outfit in the state&#x27;s history. It is currently the main opposition party in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly.

From 1 January 1988 to 5 December 2016, the AIADMK was led by the former chief minister of Tamil Nadu J. Jayalalithaa (Amma) as general secretary of the party. She was admired as the &quot;Mother of the Party&quot; by her cadre and was highly popular among the Tamil populace until her death in 2016. From 21 August 2017 to 23 June 2022, the party was led under the dual leadership of the former chief ministers of Tamil Nadu O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami as co-ordinator and joint co-ordinator respectively.

From 11 July 2022, the AIADMK has been led by the former chief minister of Tamil Nadu Edappadi K. Palaniswami (Edappadiyaar) as general secretary of the party.

The headquarters of the party is called Puratchi Thalaivar M.G.R. Maaligai, which is located at V.P. Raman Salai, Royapettah, Chennai. The building was donated to the party in 1986 by M.G.R.&#x27;s wife and the former chief minister of Tamil Nadu V. N. Janaki Ramachandran.
==Ideology and policies==

The AIADMK sought to depoliticize the education policy of the government by not insisting that education be in the Tamil language. Policies of the AIADMK were targeted at the poorer segments of Tamil society—the poor, rickshaw pullers, and destitute women—and centralizing the massive Puratchi Thalaivar M.G.R. Nutritious Meal Programme for children. There was ambivalence towards the reservation policy and the interests of farmers. The party functions on the principles and the ideals of E. V. Ramasami and the former chief ministers of Tamil Nadu C. N. Annadurai, M. G. Ramachandran and J. Jayalalithaa.

The AIADMK posted an array of welfare schemes targeting the human development index of the state. The AIADMK has schemes listed in the election manifestos covering segments of the population, including fishermen, farmers, and schoolchildren. Until the 2000s, the parties had welfare programmes such as maternity leave, subsidies for public transportation, and educational grants. After the 2000s, the parties started competing at an increasing level for the distribution of consumer goods. The AIADMK government distributed free bicycles to class 11 and 12 students during its tenure of 2001–06. In its manifesto for the 2006 assembly elections, the DMK promised free colour televisions in competition with other parties. The competition continued during the 2011 assembly elections, when both parties announced free laptops for school students and mixers, fans, and blenders for the public.

===Culture===
The party remains firm in its support for the &quot;two language policy&quot;, in opposition to demands to have Hindi as the sole lingua franca language, where Tamil and English are the two main languages of Tamil Nadu. The party provided for temples of local deities in 2016.

===Economy===
In 2012, the AIADMK Government announced the &quot;Vision 2023&quot; document, which embodied a strategic plan for infrastructure development that included raising the per capita income of residents to $10 thousand per annum, matching the Human Development Index to that of developed countries by 2023, providing high-quality infrastructure all over the state, and making Tamil Nadu the knowledge capital and innovation hub of India. This project had three components: the overall vision document, the compilation of the project profile, and the road map. In the spring of 2019, the party lauded the economic policies of the Narendra Modi-led central government, stating that the central government had ushered in economic stability and made the country a &quot;decisive player&quot; in regional economics, and voiced support for the Goods and Services Tax (GST), which had been opposed by their rival, the DMK. 

During the AIADMK regime, Tamil Nadu was the best-performing big state overall from 2018 to 2021. With a gross state domestic product of $290 billion, or ₹21.6 lakh crore, Tamil Nadu became India&#x27;s second-largest economy.

===Social justice===
In 1980, the AIADMK under M. G. Ramachandran reversed his decision on economic criteria after the AIADMK faced a close defeat in the Indian general election in Tamil Nadu. He further raised the quota for the backward classes from 31 percent to 50 percent, bringing the total reservation to 68 percent. In 1993, the AIADMK government under J. Jayalalithaa passed the Tamil Nadu Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes Bill, 1993, in the Assembly (Act 45 of 1994). The bill was sent to the president for approval. The government led a cross-party committee of Tamil Nadu politicians to Delhi to meet with the central government. She also demanded that the Tamil Nadu government&#x27;s act be placed in the ninth schedule of the Indian Constitution, ensuring that the law cannot be challenged in any court. Later, the president&#x27;s assent was received on 19 July 1994, and it confirmed the 69 percent reservation for Tamil Nadu.
On 20 February 2016, the J. Jayalalithaa-led AIADMK government passed the Tamil Nadu Municipal Laws (Amendment) Act, 2016 and the Tamil Nadu Panchayats (Amendment) Act, 2016 in the Tamil Nadu legislative assembly, enhancing the reservation for women from 33 percent to 50 percent in local bodies such as municipal corporations, municipalities, town panchayats, and village panchayats of the state.

===State water policy===
In 2006, the AIADMK initiated a case in the Supreme Court to uphold the state&#x27;s rights on the Mullaperiyar Dam issue. As a result, in May 2014, a Supreme Court verdict allowed the Tamil Nadu State to increase the storage level in the Mullaperiyar Dam to 142 feet from 136 feet and struck down the unconstitutional law enacted by the Government of Kerala in 2006 restricting the storage level to 136 feet. This Supreme Court decision ensured the farmers&#x27; and people&#x27;s livelihoods in the southern districts of Tamil Nadu. In February 2013, the Government of India notified the final award of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal (CWDT) on the directions of the Supreme Court. After 22 years of legal battle, then-Chief Minister Jayalalithaa called it a &quot;tremendous achievement&quot; of her government that the state had received due justice. Then Jayalalithaa said that it was the happiest day of her life and the happiest day for the farmers in Tamil Nadu; she recalled her famous fast-unto-death at Marina Beach in 1993.

===Environment and nature===
The AIADMK was one of two parties, along with the BJP, to not voice opposition against a ban on cattle slaughter through the national Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. However, it has sought an exemption in the Act regarding traditional bull fighting; the party supports popular opinion in Tamil Nadu that traditional bull fighting, known as Jallikattu, should not be banned by the central government due to an APEX court ruling against animal cruelty. During the controversy, the party called for animal-rights organization PETA to be banned. 

In March 2017, the AIADMK government implemented the Kudimaramathu Scheme to rejuvenate water bodies with the participation of agriculturalists, reviving the age-old practice of community participation in the maintenance and management of tank irrigation systems. In May 2018, the AIADMK government has ordered the closure of the Sterlite Copper factory in Thoothukkudi in the interest of the people, knowing that the air and water in the city are being heavily polluted by the factory, which has been at the center of violent protests by locals to protect and improve the environment. In February 2020, the AIADMK government declared the Cauvery Delta region a protected special agriculture zone. This announcement was widely hailed by political parties and farmer organizations. The AIADMK opposes the building of the Mekedatu Dam, which could reduce water flows into Tamil Nadu and negatively affect quality of life for residents and agriculture.

==History==
===M. G. Ramachandran era (1972–87)===

The party was founded on 17 October 1972, as &quot;Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam&quot; (ADMK) by M. G. Ramachandran (M.G.R.), a veteran Tamil film star and popular politician. It was set up as a breakaway faction from the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam after its president M. Karunanidhi expelled him from the party for demanding an account as the party treasurer. M.G.R., who wanted to start a new political party, then incorporated into Anakaputhur Ramalingam&#x27;s party, which had registered under the name &quot;ADMK&quot;. He then quoted, &quot;I joined the party started by an ordinary cadre&quot; and gave the post of Member of the Legislative Council (MLC) to Ramalingam. Later, M.G.R. prefixed the &quot;All India&quot; (AI) tag to the party&#x27;s name to protect the party during the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA). Since its inception, the relationship between the AIADMK and DMK has been marked by mutual contempt. M.G.R. used his fan club to build the party cadre; he claims his party recruited more than a million members in the first two months. C. N. Annadurai&#x27;s ideologue and movie producer turned politician R. M. Veerappan was the key architect in unifying M.G.R. fan clubs and further consolidating the party structure in the 1970s. Other key leaders, such as Nanjil K. Manoharan and S. D. Somasundaram played major roles in consolidation. Pavalar M. Muthusamy was elected the first presidium chairman of the party. Then Communist Party of India (CPI) state secretary M. Kalyanasundaram strongly backed M.G.R. and played a crucial role in shaping his political career by teaming up with the fledgling AIADMK. M.G.R. along with Kalyanasundaram, presented to the governor of Tamil Nadu, K. K. Shah, a charge against the Karunanidhi-led DMK government in November 1972. The party&#x27;s first victories were the wins of K. Maya Thevar in the Dindigul parliamentary bye-election in May 1973 and of C. Aranganayagam in the Coimbatore West assembly bye-election a year later. On 2 April 1973, the AIADMK emerged as the third-largest political party in Tamil Nadu, represented by 11 MLAs in the assembly. By January 1976, the AIADMK had emerged as the second-largest political party in Tamil Nadu, with 16 MLAs in the assembly. By supporting the National Emergency between 1975 and 1977, the AIADMK grew close to the Indian National Congress party.

The DMK-led government was dismissed by a central government on corruption charges in 1976. The AIADMK swept to power, defeating the DMK in the 1977 assembly election. M.G.R. was sworn in as the third chief minister of Tamil Nadu on 30 June 1977. In the 1977 general election, the party won 18 seats. In 1979, the AIADMK became the first Dravidian and regional party to join the Union Cabinet. Sathiavani Muthu and Aravinda Bala Pajanor were the members of parliament who joined the short-lived Union Ministry led by then-prime minister Charan Singh.

The relationship between the AIADMK and the INC slowly became strained. In the 1980 general election, the INC aligned with the DMK, and the alliance won 37 out of the 39 state parliamentary seats. The AIADMK won just two seats. After returning to power, Indira Gandhi dismissed a number of state governments belonging to the opposition parties, including the AIADMK government in Tamil Nadu.

In the 1980 assembly election, with the opposition DMK continuing the electoral alliance with the INC, In a massive reversal of fortunes following the Lok Sabha elections, the AIADMK won a comfortable majority in the state assembly with 129 of 234 seats. M.G.R. was sworn in as chief minister for the second time on 9 June 1980.

In the 1984 general election, the party again aligned with the INC, and the alliance won 37 out of the 39 state parliamentary seats. In the 1984 assembly election, even with M.G.R.&#x27;s failing health and hospitalization, the party won the election. M.G.R. returned to Tamil Nadu on 4 February 1985 following his recovery. He was sworn in as chief minister for the third time on 10 February 1985. Many political historians consider M.G.R.&#x27;s persona and charisma at this point in time to be &quot;infallible&quot; and a logical continuation of his on-screen &quot;good lad&quot; image, strengthened by his &quot;mythical status&quot; in the minds of the masses. M.G.R. continued to enjoy popular support in his third term until his death. He died on 24 December 1987, and became the second chief minister in Tamil Nadu to die in office after Anna.

====Succession conflict between the Janaki and Jayalalithaa factions====
Following M.G.R.&#x27;s death, his wife, actress-turned-politician V. N. Janaki Ramachandran, rose to the party&#x27;s leadership with the support of R. M. Veerappan and 98 MLAs. On 1 January 1988, Jayalalithaa was elected general secretary of the AIADMK by the prominent members of her faction, and it was ratified by the party general council convened by her the next day. Janaki served as the state&#x27;s first female chief minister for 23 days, from 7 January 1988 until the state assembly was dissolved on 30 January 1988 and President&#x27;s Rule was imposed. The party began to crumble due to infighting and broke into two factions, one under Janaki Ramachandran and the other under J. Jayalalithaa, an associate of M.G.R. and another film actress-turned-politician who had starred with M.G.R. The Election Commission of India froze the &quot;Two Leaves&quot; symbol on 17 December 1988. The 1989 assembly election saw the DMK regain power after 13 years, with M. Karunanidhi returning as chief minister for the third time. Due to its split, the AIADMK suffered heavily in the election, with the Janaki and Jayalalithaa factions winning only 2 and 27 seats, respectively. Following the AIADMK&#x27;s rout in the election, the factions led by Jayalalithaa and Janaki merged under Jayalalithaa&#x27;s leadership on 7 February 1989, as Janaki decided to quit politics as it was not her forte. On 8 February 1989, then Chief Election Commissioner R. V. S. Peri Sastri granted the Two Leaves symbol to the united AIADMK led by Jayalalithaa.

===J. Jayalalithaa era (1989–2016)===

On 9 February 1989, the AIADMK, led by J. Jayalalithaa, became the main opposition party in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly, and she became the first female leader of the opposition in the assembly. In the 1989 general election, the party allied with the Indian National Congress, and the alliance won 39 out of 40 constituencies it contested in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. The DMK government was dismissed in 1991 by the central government headed by then-prime minister Chandra Shekhar, an ally of the AIADMK at that time, on charges that the constitutional machinery in the state had broken down. The party allied with the Indian National Congress (INC) and swept to power in the 1991 assembly election under her leadership, and she became the second female and fifth chief minister of Tamil Nadu. Political observers have ascribed the landslide victory to the anti-incumbent wave arising out of the assassination of the former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi by suspected Tamil separatists fighting for a homeland in neighbouring Sri Lanka. The ensuing government was accused of large-scale corruption, but Jayalalithaa held on to power for a full term of five years.

In the 1996 assembly election, the AIADMK continued its alliance with the INC but suffered a massive rout, winning only 4 out of the 234 assembly seats, with even the party&#x27;s general secretary Jayalalithaa losing in the Bargur constituency. The party lost the 1996 general election by losing all the constituencies it contested.

In 1998, the AIADMK Silver Jubilee Conference was held in Tirunelveli by the party&#x27;s general secretary J. Jayalalithaa from January 1 to 3. Several alliance party leaders, such as Lal Krishna Advani, S. Ramadoss, Subramanian Swamy, Valappaddy K. Ramamurthy, and Vaiko, participated in it ahead of the Lok Sabha election that year. During the 1998 general election, the AIADMK revived its electoral fortunes when it formed an alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK), and the alliance won 30 seats out of 39 in Tamil Nadu. In the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led government between 1998 and 1999, the AIADMK shared power with the BJP but withdrew its support of 18 Lok Sabha MPs in early 1999, causing the BJP government to fall. Following this, the AIADMK once again allied with the INC in the 1999 general election, and the alliance won 13 seats out of 39 in Tamil Nadu.

In the 2001 assembly election, the AIADMK-led alliance, consisting of the Indian National Congress, the Tamil Maanila Congress (Moopanar) (TMC(M)), the Left Front, and the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), regained power, winning 197 seats to the AIADMK&#x27;s 132. Due to the proceedings in a disproportionate asset case that occurred during her previous tenure, Jayalalithaa was prevented from holding office. On 21 September 2001, O. Panneerselvam, a close confidant of Jayalalithaa, was appointed as the chief minister of Tamil Nadu for the first time. Once the Supreme Court of India overturned Jayalalithaa&#x27;s conviction and sentence in the case, O. Panneerselvam resigned on 2 March 2002, and Jayalalithaa was again sworn in as chief minister for the third time.

Her second term was not marred by corruption scandals. She took many popular decisions, such as banning lottery tickets, restricting the liquor and sand quarrying businesses to government agencies, and banning tobacco product sales near schools and colleges. She encouraged women to join the state police force by setting up all women&#x27;s police stations and commissioning 150 women into the elite level police commandos in 2003, a first in India. The women had the same training as men, which included handling weapons, detection and disposal of bombs, driving, horseback riding, and adventure sports. She dispatched a special task force to the Sathyamangalam forests in October 2004 to track down notorious sandalwood smuggler Veerappan. The operation was successful, as he was killed by the task force on 18 October 2004.

However, despite the popular measures taken by the government, in the 2004 general election, the party, in alliance with the BJP again, lost all 40 Lok Sabha seats it contested. The Democratic Progressive Alliance (DPA), a DMK-led alliance consisting of all the major opposition parties in the state, swept the election.

Later, in the 2006 assembly election, in spite of media speculations of a hung assembly, the AIADMK, contesting with only the support of the MDMK and a few other smaller parties, won 61 seats compared to the DMK&#x27;s 96 and was pushed out of power by the DMK-led congressional alliance of the PMK and the Left Front. The AIADMK&#x27;s electoral reversals continued in the 2009 general election. However, the party&#x27;s performance was better than its debacle in 2004, and the AIADMK-led alliance managed to win 12 seats, with the AIADMK winning 9 seats.

Following widespread corruption, a price rise, a power cut, and allegations of nepotism against the DMK government, in the 2011 assembly election, the party, in alliance with parties like the left and actor-turned-politician Vijayakant&#x27;s Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK), swept the polls, winning 203 seats, with the AIADMK winning 150. Jayalalithaa was sworn in as chief minister for the fourth time.

In the union territory of Puducherry, the AIADMK allied with N. Rangasamy&#x27;s All India N.R. Congress (AINRC) and won the 2011 assembly election, which was held in parallel with the Tamil Nadu assembly election. Rangasamy, on the other hand, formed the government without consulting the AIADMK and refused to share power with the pre-election alliance partner. So Jayalalithaa accused him of betraying the coalition.

On 9 February 2014, the 13-kg gold armor was donated by the general secretary of the AIADMK and the chief minister of Tamil Nadu J. Jayalalithaa for adorning the 3.5-foot-tall statue of Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar at Pasumpon in Ramanathapuram district. The gold armor is estimated to be worth ₹4 crore. The armor is kept in a nationalized bank locker in Madurai. After the AIADMK party treasurer and the trustee of the memorial signing in the bank, the golden armor would be taken out and handed over to the incharge of the memorial every year between 28 and 30 October for Guru Pooja and Thevar Jayanthi, which is observed on 30 October of every year.

The AIADMK&#x27;s good electoral performance continued in the 2014 general election as well. It opted not to join any alliance and contested all seats in the state of Tamil Nadu and the union territory of Puducherry on its own. The party won an unprecedented 37 out of the 40 parliamentary constituencies it contested and emerged as the third largest party in the 16th Lok Sabha of the Indian Parliament. It was a massive victory that no other regional political party had ever achieved in the history of general elections.

On 29 August 2014, J. Jayalalithaa was elected as the general secretary of the party for the 7th consecutive term, making her the longest-serving general secretary of the party to date. Earlier, she was elected as general secretary on 1 January 1988; 9 February 1989; 23 June 1993; 23 September 1998; 10 September 2003, and 10 September 2008. During her longest tenure as general secretary, V. R. Nedunchezhiyan, K. Kalimuthu, Pulamaipithan, C. Ponnaiyan, and E. Madhusudhanan served as the presidium chairmen of the party.

On 27 September 2014, Jayalalithaa was convicted in the disproportionate assets case by a Special Court along with her associates V. K. Sasikala, Ilavarasi, and V. N. Sudhakaran and sentenced to four years&#x27; simple imprisonment. Jayalalithaa was also fined 100 crore, and her associates were fined 10 crore each. The case had political implications as it was the first time a ruling chief minister had to step down on account of a court sentence.

Due to her resignation, O. Panneerselvam was sworn in as chief minister on 29 September 2014. Jayalalithaa was denied bail by the High Court and moved the Supreme Court for bail. The Supreme Court granted bail on 17 October 2014. On 11 May 2015, the High Court of Karnataka said she was acquitted from that case and was again sworn in as chief minister for the fifth time.

In the 2016 assembly election, running without allies, she swept the polls, winning 135 out of 234 seats. It was the most audacious decision made by her for the spectacular victory that no other political leader had ever made in the history of Tamil Nadu. On 23 May 2016, Jayalalithaa was sworn in as chief minister for the sixth time.

On 22 September 2016, she was admitted to Apollo Hospital, Chennai, due to fever and dehydration. After a prolonged illness, she died on 5 December 2016, and became the third chief minister in Tamil Nadu to die in office after Anna and her mentor M.G.R.

====Expansion beyond Tamil Nadu and Puducherry====
Under J. Jayalalithaa&#x27;s regime, the party spread beyond Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. It established state units in some other Indian states and union territories like Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, the National Capital Territory of Delhi, and Telangana. The party also has functionaries in other countries where Tamil people are present.

In Karnataka, the party had members in the state assembly from 1983 to 2004 and has influence in the Tamil-speaking areas of Bengaluru and Kolar.

In Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Maharashtra, the party contested some legislative assembly elections but did not win a single seat in any of the elections.

===V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran era (2016–17)===
After Jayalalithaa&#x27;s death on 5 December 2016, her close aide V. K. Sasikala was selected unanimously as the Acting General Secretary of the party on 31 December 2016. On 5 February 2017, she was selected as the leader of the legislative assembly as chief minister. O. Panneerselvam rebelled against Sasikala and reported that he had been compelled to resign as Chief Minister, bringing in a new twist to Tamil Nadu politics. Due to a conviction in the disproportionate assets case against Jayalalithaa, Sasikala was sentenced to 4 years&#x27; imprisonment in the Bengaluru Central Prison. Before that, she appointed Edappadi K. Palaniswami as legislative party leader (Chief Minister).

She also appointed her nephew and former treasurer of the party, T. T. V. Dhinakaran, as the deputy general secretary of the AIADMK party. With the support of 123 MLAs, Palaniswami became chief minister of Tamil Nadu.

On 23 March 2017, the Election Commission of India (ECI) gave separate party symbols to the two factions: O. Panneerselvam&#x27;s faction, known as AIADMK (Puratchi Thalaivi Amma), got the &quot;Electric Pole&quot; symbol, and Edappadi K. Palaniswami&#x27;s faction, known as AIADMK (Amma), got the &quot;Hat&quot; symbol.

A bye-election was announced for the Dr. Radhakrishnan Nagar constituency, which was vacated due to Jayalalithaa&#x27;s death. But the election commission cancelled the bye-election after evidence of large-scale bribery by the ruling AIADMK (Amma) surfaced. On 17 April 2017, Delhi police registered a case against Dhinakaran, who was also the candidate for AIADMK (Amma) for the bye-election at Dr. Radhakrishnan Nagar, regarding an allegation of attempting to bribe the Election Commission of India for the AIADMK&#x27;s election symbol. However, the Central District Tis Hazari Courts granted him bail on the grounds that the police had failed to identify the allegedly bribed public official.

T. T. V. Dhinakaran started his party work on 5 August 2017. However, the chief minister, Edappadi K. Palaniswami, had a fallout with Dhinakaran and announced that the appointment of Dhinakaran as deputy general secretary was invalid. So he claims, &quot;We are the real AIADMK, and 95% of its cadres are with us.&quot;

====Expulsion of V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran====
On 12 September 2017, the AIADMK general council, which had earlier appointed her, cancelled V. K. Sasikala&#x27;s appointment as general secretary and officially expelled her from the party as a primary member.

Earlier on 10 August 2017, T. T. V. Dhinakaran was sacked as deputy general secretary at the meeting headed by Edappadi K. Palaniswami at Puratchi Thalaivar M.G.R. Maaligai in Chennai.

After completing her imprisonment at Bengaluru Central Prison, Sasikala filed a case in the City Civil Court IV of Chennai in February 2021, but it upheld her dismissal as the AIADMK general secretary in April 2022. On 5 December 2023, the Madras High Court upheld her dismissal as the AIADMK general secretary.

===O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami era (2017–22)===
On 21 August 2017, both O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami factions of the AIADMK merged, and O. Panneerselvam was sworn in as the Deputy Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu with the portfolio of Finance. He also holds portfolios for housing, rural housing, housing development, the slum clearance board, accommodation control, town planning, urban development, and the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority. A dual leadership system was amended in the constitution of the party by removing the designation of general secretary and constituting the new designations for the party&#x27;s leadership. O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami became the co-ordinator and joint co-ordinator of the AIADMK, respectively. On 4 January 2018, O. Panneerselvam was elected Leader of the House in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly.

On 12 September 2017, the AIADMK general council decided to cancel V. K. Sasikala&#x27;s appointment as acting general secretary and officially expel her from the party, though prominent members appointed to party posts by her were allowed to continue discharging their functions. Instead, the late J. Jayalalithaa was named the eternal general secretary of the AIADMK.

A day after the merger of two AIADMK factions, on 22 August 2017, 19 MLAs owing allegiance to ousted deputy general secretary T. T. V. Dhinakaran submitted letters to the governor, expressing lack of confidence in Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and withdrawing support from the government. 18 out of those 19 MLAs were disqualified from office by the Speaker of the legislative assembly upon recommendation from the AIADMK Chief Whip. After a prolonged legal battle, the Speaker&#x27;s orders were upheld by the Madras High Court, and bye-elections were held alongside the general parliamentary elections. On 23 November 2017, the Election Commission of India granted the &quot;two leaves&quot; symbol to the O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami camp.

On 24 February 2018, AIADMK&#x27;s new mouthpiece, &quot;Namadhu Amma&quot;, a Tamil daily newspaper, was launched, marking the 70th birth anniversary of the former chief minister of Tamil Nadu and the former general secretary of AIADMK, J. Jayalalithaa, fondly known as &quot;Amma&quot;. On 14 November 2018, the AIADMK launched &quot;News J&quot;, named after the AIADMK former general secretary J. Jayalalithaa, to replace Jaya TV. News J is the 24×7 Tamil news channel operated and managed by Mantaro Network Private Limited.

Despite the popular measures taken by the government, in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the party, in alliance with the BJP again, was humiliated, winning one of the 39 Lok Sabha seats from the state. The Secular Progressive Alliance (SPA), a DMK-led alliance consisting of all the major opposition parties in the state, swept the election by winning 38 seats.

Later, in the 2021 assembly election, the AIADMK-led National Democratic Alliance, consisting of the PMK, BJP, and a few other smaller parties, won 75 seats compared to the 159 seats won by the DMK alliance and was pushed out of power by the DMK-led secular progressive alliance. After the election, the AIADMK emerged as the main party of the opposition in the assembly by winning 66 seats. On 11 May 2021, party joint co-ordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami was recognized as the Leader of the Opposition in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly, and on 14 June 2021, party co-ordinator O. Panneerselvam was recognized as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly by M. Appavu, Speaker of the Assembly.

====Legal fight for the party by V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran====
After that, V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran had appealed to the Delhi High Court, which rejected their appeal and said that O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami were the original AIADMK.

Following that, T. T. V. Dhinakaran filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of India on March 15, and the bench of the Chief Justice of India dismissed his appeal against the Delhi High Court&#x27;s decision in favor of the O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami camp.

Following this, the General Council passed a resolution removing V. K. Sasikala from the post of General Secretary. V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran jointly filed a suit in the High Court challenging the decision of the General Council. Since it was a civil case, the case was transferred to the City Civil Court. During the hearing on 9 April 2021, Dinakaran told the court that he would withdraw from the case as he had started a party called Amma Makkal Munnettra Kazagam. At the same time, Sasikala told the court that she wanted to continue the case. The court dismissed her plea following an interlocutory application from AIADMK Co-ordinator O. Panneerselvam and Joint Co-ordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami.

====Tensions with BJP====
In June 2022, the AIADMK and BJP were at odds publicly. AIADMK organization secretary C. Ponnaiyan accused the BJP-led central government of stealing Tamil Nadu&#x27;s revenue, as well as blaming AIADMK for election losses, the loss of minority community support, and &quot;anti-Tamil&quot; policies, particularly those affecting students. He also called the alliance an &quot;electoral adjustment&quot;, claiming that the BJP was attempting to expand at the cost of the AIADMK in Tamil Nadu and that its ideology is diametrically opposite that of the AIADMK. The event reportedly had party cadres reiterating these sentiments, albeit in a lighter tone, and agreeing that the BJP was attempting to wrest control of the state&#x27;s opposition from the AIADMK.

====Leadership tussle between O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami====
On 14 June 2022, citing the party&#x27;s troubles in the polls, AIADMK district secretaries and other senior party members spoke out to shun the &quot;dual leadership&quot; system and came out publicly in favor of a strong unitary leader to strengthen the organization.

Supporters of Edappadi K. Palaniswami pushed for the change in the party&#x27;s leadership structure by staging a political coup against AIADMK Co-ordinator O. Panneerselvam, who had become weak within the party. According to many sources, of the AIADMK&#x27;s 75 district secretaries, hardly 10 supported him. Of the party&#x27;s 66 MLAs, only three were reportedly on O. Panneerselvam&#x27;s side, and less than 20 percent of the party&#x27;s general council members were behind him ahead of the crucial general council meeting on 23 June 2022, which was expected to elect the single leadership to the party.

On 23 June 2022, A. Thamizhmahan Hussain was unanimously elected as the Presidium Chairman of the party at a general council meeting held at the Shrivaaru Venkataachalapathy Palace in Vanagaram, Chennai. On the same day, Presidium Chairman A. Thamizhmahan Hussain announced that the next general council meeting of the party would be held on 11 July 2022.

On 30 June 2022, Edappadi K. Palaniswami wrote a letter to O. Panneerselvam asserting the latter ceased to be the party co-ordinator as the amendments made to the party&#x27;s bylaw in the December 2021 executive committee meeting were not recognized in the general council meeting held on 23 June 2022.

;Expulsion of O. Panneerselvam
In the general council meeting held on 11 July 2022, the general council members passed the resolution and expelled the former co-ordinator O. Panneerselvam, the former deputy co-ordinator R. Vaithilingam, P. H. Manoj Pandian, and J. C. D. Prabhakar from their respective posts and primary membership in the party for &quot;anti-party&quot; activities.

On 11 July 2022, former chief minister of Tamil Nadu Edappadi K. Palaniswami was unanimously elected as the interim general secretary of the party in the general council meeting held at the Shrivaaru Venkatachalapathy Palace in Vanagaram, Chennai. Palaniswami appointed Dindigul C. Sreenivasan as the treasurer of the party, replacing O. Panneerselvam. On 19 July 2022, Palaniswami appointed R. B. Udhayakumar as the deputy leader of the opposition in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly, replacing Panneerselvam, who declared this in the party&#x27;s legislative members meeting held on 17 July 2022. Before the general council meeting, there was violence at the Puratchi Thalaivar M.G.R. Maaligai in Royapettah, where the supporters of Palaniswami and Panneerselvam threw stones, bottles, and plastic chairs at each other and damaged several vehicles nearby. Following this, the Revenue Department of Tamil Nadu sealed the Puratchi Thalaivar M.G.R. Maaligai. Overall, 47 people were injured in the clashes.

On 20 July 2022, the Madras High Court ordered to remove the seal of Puratchi Thalaivar M.G.R. Maaligai and hand over the keys to the interim general secretary, Edappadi K. Palaniswami. It was previously locked and sealed on 11 July 2022. On 12 September 2022, the Supreme Court of India dismissed the petition of O. Panneerselvam challenging the Madras High Court&#x27;s order to handover the keys to Palaniswami.

;Legal fight for the party between Edappadi K. Palaniswami and O. Panneerselvam
The Madras High Court on 17 August 2022 ruled in favor of O. Panneerselvam and declared the AIADMK general council meeting held on 11 July 2022 which had abolished dual leadership as void ab initio. The court called for the restoration of the status quo as it existed on June 23 and has prevented the party from convening any meeting of the executive council or the general council of the party without joint consent from both Palaniswami and Panneerselvam, thus effectively restoring dual leadership. The court cited procedural lapses to declare the general council meeting held on July 11, invalid and found that there was no data to prove Edappadi K. Palaniswami&#x27;s claim that 95% of the 1.5 crore (15 million) primary party members supported unitary leadership under him.

Edappadi K. Palaniswami appealed the single-judge court order to a larger bench of judges. Following the order, O. Panneerselvam appealed for party unity, which included the splinter AMMK group. Palaniswami dismissed this appeal as a power-hungry move by Panneerselvam and held him responsible for violence at the Puratchi Thalaivar M.G.R. Maaligai.

On 2 September 2022, a division bench of the Madras High Court upheld the decisions of the AIADMK general council meeting held on 11 July 2022, and set aside the previous court order of the single judge in the appeal case of Edappadi K. Palaniswami, thus effectively restoring unitary leadership.

On 23 February 2023, the Supreme Court of India upheld the decisions of the AIADMK general council meeting held on 11 July 2022, and dismissed the petition of O. Panneerselvam challenging the previous order of the division bench, thus affirming unitary leadership under Edappadi K. Palaniswami. On 19 January 2024, the Supreme Court of India refused to stay the August 2023 order of the division bench of Madras High Court, which dismissed the petitions of O. Panneerselvam challenging resolutions passed by the general council held on 11 July 2022, that led to the expulsion of O. Panneerselvam and his supporters from the party, saying the interference at this stage will &quot;lead to huge chaos&quot;.

===Edappadi K. Palaniswami era (2022–present)===

On 11 July 2022, an AIADMK general council meeting was held at the Shrivaaru Venkataachalapathy Palace in Vanagaram following the dismissal of a petition by O. Panneerselvam in the Madras High Court. The party general council abolished the dual leadership model, empowered Edappadi K. Palaniswami as the interim general secretary, and called for organizational elections in 4 months. The general council meeting made 20 amendments to the AIADMK bylaws, including the removal of rule 20, which had described J. Jayalalithaa as the &quot;eternal general secretary&quot;, reviving the post of general secretary, transferring all the powers of the co-ordinator and joint co-ordinator to the general secretary, and abolishing the posts of co-ordinator and joint co-ordinator. These changes effectively ended the party&#x27;s dual leadership.

On 28 March 2023, the Madras High Court ruled in favor of Edappadi K. Palaniswami and dismissed the petitions of O. Panneerselvam challenging the resolutions passed at the general council meeting held on 11 July 2022. On the same day, AIADMK announced that Edappadi K. Palaniswami was elected as the general secretary of the party through a general secretary election.

On 20 April 2023, the Election Commission of India recognized Edappadi K. Palaniswami as the general secretary of the party, acknowledging the amendments to the party constitution and changes to the list of office-bearers. On 10 July 2023, the Election Commission of India recognized the changes made in the party organization after the party&#x27;s due election.

On 20 August 2023, the Rising Conference of the AIADMK Golden Jubilee Celebrations was held in Madurai by the then-newly elected party&#x27;s general secretary Edappadi K. Palaniswami, and lakhs of party supporters attended the event.

On 25 September 2023, the party&#x27;s secretaries advisory meeting, led by general secretary Edappadi K. Palaniswami, was held in the Puratchi Thalaivar M.G.R. Maaligai. At the meeting, it was decided to withdraw from the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance, and it was officially announced by deputy general secretary K. P. Munusamy after the meeting.

In the 2024 general election, the AIADMK-led Alliance consisting of Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK), Puthiya Tamilagam (PT), and the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) contested in the state of Tamil Nadu and the union territories of Puducherry and Andaman and Nicobar Islands for the 18th Lok Sabha polls. In the alliance, the AIADMK contested 36 constituencies and the DMDK contested five constituencies. The party-led alliance lost in all the constituencies it contested, and the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance swept the election in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.

<text>HaGashash HaHiver (, &quot;lit.&quot; The Pale Tracker) was an iconic Israeli comedy trio. It was also known as the &quot;Gashashim.&quot; Its three members were Yeshayahu Levi (&quot;Shaike&quot;), Yisrael Poliakov (&quot;Poli&quot;) (deceased) and .

==History==
Shaike, Poli and Gavri had been members of &quot;HaTarnegolim&quot;&quot; (&quot;The Roosters&quot;), founded in 1960 by Naomi Polani.

The Gashashim put on many comedy skits which became classics in their own right (&quot;The Drafted Car&quot;, &quot;Off Side Story&quot;, &quot;Kreker vs Kreker&quot;, etc.) and contributed numerous quotes to modern spoken Hebrew. They also starred in comic Israeli movies which became major hits, such as &quot;Givat Halfon Eina Ona&quot; and recorded many famous Hebrew songs. Some of Israel&#x27;s greatest authors and playwrights, including the late Nisim Aloni, prepared material for the trio. The producer of HaGashash HaHiver was (&quot;Pachanel&quot;).

The Gashash&#x27; sketches transcended class and education. Their elaborate word play became known as &quot;Gashashit&quot;.

On October 29, 2007, Yisrael Poliakov died at age 66.

==Awards and recognition==
In 2000, HaGashash HaHiver and its three members were awarded the Israel Prize for lifetime achievement &amp; special contribution to society and the State of Israel.

The judges who awarded the prize, wrote of their decision to bestow the award on the group: &quot;&quot;The uniqueness of Hagashash Hahiver is in its two faces: On the one hand, it reflects the life and the culture that were created in Israel during its first 50 years and in the course of wars, immigration absorption and the struggle for its existence. On the other hand, it has taken an active role in shaping this culture, creating its language and sketching its identity...Their language, Gashashit, and the images they created broke the walls of the inflexible Hebrew language and became standard idiomatic phrases, so much so that he who doesn&#x27;t know them doesn&#x27;t know a large part of the culture that has sprouted here. Phrases such as, &#x27;Drive in peace, the keys are inside,&#x27; &#x27;There was an engine?&#x27; [referring to the &quot;Drafted Car&quot; skit where the army returns a requisitioned car without any of its original parts], &#x27;Israbluff&#x27; and many others that became part of our everyday language.&quot;&quot;

==Cultural significance==
The group has been repeatedly cited as helping to form a part of the cultural self-identity of many Israelis. Israeli sociologist and scholar Baruch Kimmerling called the group &quot;more significant for me than Shakespeare&quot; in terms of this. &quot;They pushed the boundary of surrealism in a language that had been dead for a couple thousand years,&quot; said Stand Up! Records founder Dan Schlissel, a fan of the group. In her book &quot;No Joke: Making Jewish Humor&quot;, Yiddish literature scholar Ruth Wisse stated that &quot;if I ask an assortment of Israelis, &#x27;what comes to mind when I say, Israeli humor?&#x27; almost everyone answers &#x27;HaGashash HaHiver.&#x27;&quot;

<text>The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (; ; DMK) is an Indian political party based in the state of Tamil Nadu, where it is currently the ruling party, and the union territory of Puducherry, where it is currently the main opposition.

The DMK was founded on 17 September 1949 by C. N. Annadurai (Anna) as a breakaway faction from the Dravidar Kazhagam headed by Periyar. DMK was headed by Annadurai as the general secretary from 1949 until his death on 4 February 1969. He also served as the chief minister of Tamil Nadu from 1967 to 1969. Under Annadurai, in 1967, DMK became the first party, other than the Indian National Congress, to win the state-level elections with a clear majority on its own in any state in India. M. Karunanidhi (Kalaignar) followed Annadurai as the first president of the party from 1969 until his death on 7 August 2018. He also served as the Chief Minister for five non-consecutive terms, in two of which he was dismissed by the Union government. After Karunanidhi&#x27;s death, his son and former deputy, M. K. Stalin, succeeded as the party president and as a Chief minister of Tamil Nadu state from May 2021.

DMK is the fifth-largest party in the Lok Sabha. It currently holds 125 seats in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly, and the DMK-led Secular Progressive Alliance holds 159 out of 234.

== History ==

=== Origins and foundation ===

The DMK traces its roots to the South Indian Liberal Federation (Justice Party) founded by Dr C. Natesa Mudaliar in 1916, in the presence of P. Theagaraya Chetty, P. T. Rajan, T. M. Nair, Arcot Ramasamy Mudaliar and a few others in Victoria Public Hall Madras Presidency. The Justice Party, whose objectives included social equality and justice, came to power in the first general elections to the Madras Presidency in 1920. Communal division between Brahmins and non-Brahmin upper began in the presidency during the late-19th and early-20th century, mainly due to caste prejudices and disproportionate Brahminical representation in government jobs. The Justice Party&#x27;s foundation marked the culmination of several efforts to establish an organization to represent the non-Brahmin upper castes in Madras and is seen as the start of the Dravidian movement.

Periyar, a popular reformist leader at that time, had joined the Indian National Congress in 1919, to oppose what he considered the Brahminic leadership of the party. Periyar&#x27;s participation at the Vaikom Satyagraha led him to start the Self-Respect Movement in 1926 which was rationalistic and &quot;anti-Brahministic&quot;. He quit Congress and in 1935 he joined the Justice Party.

In the 1937 elections, the Justice Party lost and the Indian National Congress under C. Rajagopalachari (Rajaji) came to power in Madras Presidency. Rajaji&#x27;s introduction of Hindi as a compulsory subject in schools led to the anti-Hindi agitations, led by Periyar and his associates.

In August 1944, Periyar created the &#x27;Dravidar Kazhagam&#x27; out of the Justice Party and the Self-Respect Movement at the Salem Provincial Conference. The DK, conceived as a movement and not a political party, insisted on an independent nation for Dravidians called Dravida Nadu consisting of areas that were covered under the Madras Presidency.

The party at its inception retained the flag of the South Indian Liberal Federation, which had a picture of a traditional type of balance signifying the idea of equality. Its central theme was to remove the degraded status imposed on Dravidians. To communicate this, the party adopted a black flag with a red circle inside it, with the black signifying their degradation and the red denoting the intention of the movement to uplift Dravidians.

Over the years, many disagreements arose between Periyar and his followers. In 1949, several of his followers led by C. N. Annadurai decided to split from Dravidar Kazhagam, after Annadurai and part of the members decided to take part in electoral politics and Periyar had strong objection on it.

The Dravidian philosophy culminated both politically and socially with DMK at the helm of administration. It was the first-ever subaltern movement in the history of sub-continent politics to have political representation from former lower-castes, and it was a marked move from generations of civic administrators from the upper-caste citizenry. This had a deep societal impact which resulted in increased political participation, which aided the representation of the emergent strata, enriched civic life, and subsequently strengthened the pluralist democracy.

===C. N. Annadurai era (1949–1969)===

The DMK&#x27;s first foray into electoral politics, in the 1957 legislative assembly elections, was mixed. While it won 15 seats, many prominent leaders such as Annadurai and V. R. Nedunchezhiyan were defeated. It fared somewhat better in 1962, winning 50 seats and becoming the main opposition.

==== Anti-Hindi Imposition agitations ====
The DMK, which split from the Dravidar Kazhagam in 1949, inherited the anti-Hindi imposition policies of its parent organization. Founder C.N. Annadurai had earlier participated in the anti-Hindi imposition agitations during 1938–40 and throughout the 1940s.

In July 1953, the DMK launched an agitation against the Union government&#x27;s proposed name-change of Kallakudi to Dalmiapuram. They claimed that the town&#x27;s proposed new name (after Ramkrishna Dalmia) symbolized the exploitation of South India by the North. On 15 July, M. Karunanidhi (later Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu) and other DMK members removed the Hindi name from Dalmiapuram railway station&#x27;s name board and protested on the tracks. In the altercation with the police that followed the protests, two DMK members lost their lives, and several others, including Karunanidhi and Kannadasan, were arrested.

The DMK continued its anti-Hindi Imposition policies throughout the 1950s, along with the secessionist demand for Dravida Nadu, in which it was originally more radical than the Dravida Kazhagam. On 28 January 1956, Annadurai, along with Periyar and Rajaji, signed a resolution passed by the Academy of Tamil Culture endorsing the continuation of English as the official language. On 21 September 1957, the DMK convened an anti-Hindi Conference to protest against the imposition of Hindi. It observed 13 October 1957 as &quot;anti-Hindi Day&quot;.

On 31 July 1960, another open-air anti-Hindi conference was held in Kodambakkam, Madras. In November 1963, DMK dropped its secessionist demand in the wake of the Sino-Indian War and the passage of the anti-secessionist 16th Amendment to the Indian Constitution. However, the anti-Hindi stance remained and hardened with the passage of Official Languages Act of 1963. The DMK&#x27;s view on Hindi&#x27;s eligibility for official language status were reflected in Annadurai&#x27;s response to the &quot;numerical superiority of Hindi&quot; argument: &quot;If we had to accept the principle of numerical superiority while selecting our national bird, the choice would have fallen not on the peacock but on the common crow.&quot;

==== Formation of state government ====
In 1967, DMK came to power in the Madras State 18 years after its formation and 10 years after it had first entered electoral politics. This began the Dravidian era in the Madras province, which later became Tamil Nadu. In 1967, the Congress lost nine states to opposition parties, but it was only in Madras that a single non-Congress Party (namely, the DMK) won a majority. The electoral victory of 1967 is also reputed to be an electoral fusion among the non-Congress parties to avoid a split in the Opposition votes. Rajagopalachari, a former senior leader of the Congress Party, had by then left the Congress and launched the right-wing Swatantra Party. He played a vital role in bringing about the electoral fusion amongst the opposition parties to align against the Congress. At that time, his cabinet was the youngest in the country.

==== Other achievements ====
Annadurai legalized self-respect marriages for the first time the country. Such marriages did not involve priests presiding over the ceremonies, and thus a Brahmin was not needed to carry out the wedding. Self-respect marriages were a brainchild of Periyar, who regarded the then conventional marriages as mere financial arrangements which often led to great debt through dowry. Self-respect marriages, according to him, encouraged inter-caste marriages and caused arranged marriages to be replaced by love marriages.

Annadurai was also the first to promise to subsidize the price of rice in order to campaign for his election. He promised one rupee a measure of rice, which he initially implemented once in government, but had to withdraw later. Subsidizing rice costs are still used as an election promise in Tamil Nadu.

It was Annadurai&#x27;s government that renamed Madras State to Tamil Nadu, its present-day name. The name change itself was first presented in the upper house (Rajya Sabha) of the Parliament of India by Bhupesh Gupta, a communist MP from West Bengal, but was then defeated. With Annadurai as chief minister, the state assembly succeeded in passing the bill renaming the state. Another major achievement of Annadurai&#x27;s government was to introduce a &quot;two-language policy&quot; over the then popular three language formula. The three-language formula, which was implemented in the neighboring states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala, entitled students to study three languages: the regional language, English and Hindi.

===M. Karunanidhi era (1969–2018)===

In 1969, Annadurai unexpectedly died. M.Karunanidhi was elected as his successor, defeating rival candidate V. R. Nedunchezhiyan. Karunanidhi would continue to head the DMK until his own death in 2018.

In the 1970s, M. G. Ramachandran (M.G.R.), a popular actor and the party treasurer, had a political feud with the party president Karunanidhi. In 1972, M.G.R. called for a boycott of the party&#x27;s General Council. The crisis led to a call for a corruption probe by M.G.R. where he was a treasurer, and he was eventually suspended from the General Council by the high-power committee of DMK. He then created the new party named All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK).

Indira Gandhi dismissed the Karunanidhi government in 1976 based on charges of possible secession and corruption. The DMK government has been indicted by the Sarkaria commission for corruption in allotting tenders for the Veeranam drainage project.

The interim report of the Justice Jain Commission, which oversaw the investigation into Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s assassination, indicted Karunanidhi for abetting the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The interim report recommended that Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi and the DMK party be held responsible for abetting Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s murderers. The final report contained no such allegations.

Karunanidhi&#x27;s nephew, Murasoli Maran, was a Union Minister; however, it has been pointed out that he was in politics long before Karunanidhi became the Chief Minister in 1969. Many political opponents and DMK party senior leaders have been critical of the rise of M. K. Stalin in the party. He was appointed as Mayor and later as Deputy CM of TN. But some of the party men have pointed out that Stalin has come up on his own. Karunanidhi&#x27;s daughter Kanimozhi has been appointed as the Rajya Sabha MP twice in 2007 and 2013. Karunanidhi&#x27;s nephew&#x27;s son Dayanidhi Maran has been appointed as the central Minister. Karunanidhi&#x27;s grandson, son of Stalin Udhayanidhi Stalin, has been elected as the MLA of TN assembly. Karunanidhi has been accused of helping Murasoli Maran&#x27;s son Kalanithi Maran, who runs Sun TV Network, India&#x27;s second largest television network. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, Kalanidhi is among India&#x27;s richest 20, with $2.9 billion. It has been pointed out that Karunanidhi has hesitated to take action against his erring family members. Karunanidhi is also accused of allowing Azhagiri to function as an extraconstitutional authority in Madurai. The Dinakaran newspaper case was handed over to the CBI. But the District and Sessions court acquitted all the 17 accused in that case.

==== Elections under Karunanidhi&#x27;s presidency ====
* In 1977, DMK lost the Assembly elections to M.G.R.&#x27;s AIADMK, and stayed out of power in the state until 1989. After MGR&#x27;s death in December 1987, AIADMK split into two factions between Janaki (MGR&#x27;s wife) and Jayalalithaa. DMK returned to power in the 1989 State assembly elections and for the 3rd time, Karunanidhi took over as the chief minister in January 1989.
* The 1991 election was held with the backdrop of DMK government having dissolved within two years of formation due to pressure from ex-Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi leading an alliance with Samajwadi Janata Party. In the same year, Rajiv Gandhi was killed by a suicide bomber during the election campaign, and due to DMK&#x27;s pro-Tamil stance and the dismissal of the state government mid-campaign by Rajiv, attitudes were against DMK and instead in favor of the AIADMK–Congress alliance, causing the DMK to be deprived of any seats in the Parliament.
* In the 1996 state elections, DMK came to power on strength of corruption charges against J.Jayalalithaa and the alliance with Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC), headed by G.K. Moopanar.
* However, in 2001, the AIADMK, on strength of a strong alliance and the incumbency factor against DMK, came back to power in the state assembly elections.
* In the 2004 general election, DMK formed an alliance with Congress, the Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) and the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) and swept a grand victory. The alliance won all 40 seats including Puducherry. This enabled DMK to hold 7 ministerial posts in the central government and gave influential power to DMK.
* Two years later in 2006, the same alliance won in the state assembly elections and the DMK, for the first time, formed a minority government in the state with help from Congress. M Karunanidhi became the Chief Minister of the state for the fifth time. The DMK-Congress alliance was also successful in the 2009 general elections.
* In the 2011 Assembly elections, held in the wake of the 2G case and allegations of nepotism, the DMK won only 23 seats, 127 seats less than earlier.
* In the 2014 general election, DMK failed to win any seats; however, by vote percentage, it was second only to AIADMK.
* The 2016 state assembly elections gave DMK 89 MLAs. This was the most number for an opposition party in the history of the Tamil Nadu legislative assembly.

===M. K. Stalin era (2018–present)===

Karunanidhi died on 7 August 2018, leaving the party in the hands of his son, M. K. Stalin. Stalin had been appointed as the working president in January 2017 when his father&#x27;s health started declining and had previously been named heir apparent by his father. Stalin thus became the second DMK president since the party&#x27;s inception. On 3 February 2020, M. K. Stalin announced that Prashant Kishor was signed up as a party strategist for the upcoming 2021 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election.

On 25 March 2018, the DMK held a statewide conference in Erode and M. K. Stalin released five slogans at the conference. They were:

# Let us keep an eye on the Kalaignar&#x27;s command
# Let us grow and admire Tamil
# Let us crush the power pile
# Let us protect humanity from extremism
# Let us grow a prosperous Tamil Nadu

M.K. Stalin formed the Secular Progressive Alliance in Tamil Nadu and led the alliance in the 2019 general election. M.K. Stalin and his alliance in Tamil Nadu won 39 out of 40 seats in the parliament and 12 out of 21 in the Assembly with a 52% vote share. The DMK-led alliance won the 2019 Tamil Nadu local body elections under the Secular Progressive alliance.

The DMK-led Secular Progressive Alliance won the 2021 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election. The alliance won 159 seats out of 234 seats with 46% vote share.

==Party ideology==
Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam follows the principle of Duty, Dignity, and Discipline, as instructed by C. N. Annadurai. This involves protecting democratic rights in politics, establishing a non-dominant society, and carrying out reform work based on rationality to promote the revival of Dravidian ideology. The party aims to overcome poverty in the economic sphere and provide means for the well-being of all on an equitable basis. The party also aims to develop and promote the respective state languages without allowing other languages to dominate. The party believes in promoting the decentralization of powers from the Union government and creating autonomy in the states and federalism at the center.

===Dravidian nationalism===
The anti-Hindi Imposition agitations of 1965 forced the central government to abandon its efforts to use Hindi as the only official language of the country.

=== State autonomy ===
After The Emergency invoked by Indira Gandhi, more state powers like education and medical care were moved from state control to national control. At the state conference in Trichy after the death of C.N. Annadurai, M. Karunanidhi announced the adoption of the &quot;state autonomy&quot; principle to advocate for state self-governance. In April 1974, the DMK government brought in a resolution in the House urging the centre to accept the Rajamannar Committee recommendations on state autonomy and amend the Constitution of India to pave the way for a truly federal system.

=== Social justice ===
DMK claims they are the successors of Justice Party. DMK played a crucial role alongside Periyar in the protest for the first constitutional amendment ensuring the provision legalizing OBC reservation. DMK&#x27;s one of the core ideology is OBC welfare and has implemented reservation related policies in favour of OBCs and SCs.

DMK reconstituted the disabled persons welfare board to Differently Abled Persons Departments and the changed official terms for transgender individuals to more respectful terms like Thirunangai and Thirunambi.

== Party symbol ==
The party&#x27;s election symbol is the &quot;sun rising from between two mountains&quot;, with a black and red flag often pictured. The symbol was inspired by the leader and scriptwriter M. Karunanidhi&#x27;s 1950s play &quot;Udaya Suryan&quot; and is intended to signify the &quot;rising&quot; spirit of the Dravidian people.

In the 1957 poll, the DMK was not recognized by the Election Commission. The party was grouped as independents and was not united by its rising sun symbol and was forced to contest under the rooster symbol.

<doc id="410050" wikidata="Q5468548" url="?curid=410050" title="Foreign relations of Sri Lanka">
<text>Foreign relations of Sri Lanka refers to the diplomatic and commercial relations between Sri Lanka and other countries. Sri Lanka has stressed its principle of &quot;friendship towards all, enmity towards none&quot; in its diplomacy.

Sri Lanka since the 1950s has followed a non-aligned foreign policy, which does not take sides with major powers. Since the end of the Cold War in Asia, the country has pursued better relations with all major powers and seeks to strengthen its diplomatic, economic and military ties with China, India, Pakistan, Russia, the United States, Japan, South Korea and the European Union. Sri Lanka has also forged close ties with the member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), African Union and Arab League.

Sri Lanka participates in multilateral diplomacy, particularly at the United Nations, where it seeks to promote sovereignty, independence, and development in the developing world. Sri Lanka was a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). It also is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), Asian Development Bank (ADB), Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (as dialogue partner) and Colombo Plan. Sri Lanka continues its active participation in the NAM, while also stressing the importance it places on regionalism by playing a strong role in SAARC.

==History==
The goal of Sri Lanka&#x27;s foreign policy is to maintain a strong, independent, powerful and unitary Sri Lanka, whose foreign policy establishment maintains it in achieving that goal.

Sri Lanka&#x27;s foreign policy has been founded in the national interest. In a period of rapid and continuing change, foreign policy can respond optimally to new challenges and opportunities. It has to be an integral part of the larger effort of building the nation&#x27;s capabilities through economic development, strengthening social fabric and well-being of the people and protecting Sri Lanka&#x27;s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Sri Lanka&#x27;s foreign policy is a forward-looking engagement with the rest of the world, based on a rigorous, realistic and contemporary assessment of the bilateral, regional and global geo-political and economic milieu.

==Military==
The Sri Lanka Armed Forces are the overall unified military of Sri Lanka and encompass the Sri Lanka Army, the Sri Lanka Navy and the Sri Lanka Air Force, which come under the Ministry of Defence (MOD). They receive military support from mainly China, Russia, India, Pakistan and Israel. The United States also gives limited support.

<doc id="410054" wikidata="Q3733779" url="?curid=410054" title="Label (Mac OS)">
<text>In Apple&#x27;s Macintosh operating systems, labels are a type of seven distinct colored and named parameters of metadata that can be attributed to items (files, folders and disks) in the filesystem. Labels were introduced in Macintosh System 7, released in 1991, and they were an improvement of the ability to colorize items in earlier versions of the Finder. Labels remained a feature of the Macintosh operating system through the end of Mac OS 9 in late 2001, but they were omitted from Mac OS X versions 10.0 to 10.2, before being reintroduced in version 10.3 in 2003, though not without criticism. During the short time period when Mac OS X lacked labels, third-party software replicated the feature.

==In classic Mac OS==
In classic Mac OS versions 7 through 9, applying a label to an item causes the item&#x27;s icon to be tinted in that color when using a color computer monitor (as opposed to the black-and-white monitors of early Macs), and labels can be used as a search and sorting criterion. There is a choice of seven colors because three bits are reserved for the label color: codice_1 through codice_2, and codice_3 for no label. The names of the colors can be changed to represent categories assigned to the label colors. Both label colors and names can be customized in the classic Mac OS systems; however, Mac OS 8 and 9 provided this functionality through the Labels tab in the Finder Preferences dialog, while System 7 provided a separate Labels control panel. Labels in Mac OS 9 and earlier, once customized, were specific to an individual install; booting into another install, be it on another Mac or different disk would show different colors and names unless set identically. A colorless label could be produced by changing a label&#x27;s color to black or white.

==In Mac OS X and later==
Mac OS X versions 10.3 to 10.8 apply the label color to the background of item names, except when an item is selected in column view, which changes the item name to the standard highlight color except for a label-colored dot after the name. Beginning in OS X 10.9, the label-colored background of item names is replaced with a small label-colored dot, and becomes a kind of tag.

==Relation to tags==
The Mac operating system has allowed users to assign multiple arbitrary tags as extended file attributes to any item ever since OS X 10.9 was released in 2013. These tags coexist with the legacy label system for backward compatibility, so that multiple colored (or colorless) tags can be added to a single item, but only the last colored tag applied to an item will set the legacy label that will be seen when viewing the item in the older operating systems. Labeled items that were created in the older operating systems will superficially seem to be tagged in OS X 10.9 and later even though they are only labeled and lack the newer tag extended file attributes (until they are edited in the new system). Since label colors can be changed in classic Mac OS but are standardized and unchangeable in the newer operating systems, someone who wants to synchronize the label colors between a classic and modern system can change the label colors in classic Mac OS to match the newer system.

<text>The haydamaks, also haidamakas or haidamaky or haidamaks ( &quot;haidamaka&quot;; , &quot;Haidamaky&quot;, ) were Ukrainian Cossack paramilitary outfits composed of commoners (peasants, craftsmen), and impoverished noblemen in the eastern part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. They were formed in reaction to the Commonwealth&#x27;s actions that were directed to reconstitute its orders on territory of right-bank Ukraine, which was secured following ratification of the Treaty of Perpetual Peace with the Tsardom of Russia in 1710.

==Etymology and terminology==
===Etymology===

The word &quot;haydamak&quot; has two related meanings: either &#x27;Ukrainian insurgent against the Poles in the 18th century&#x27;, or &#x27;brigand&#x27;. The role played by haydamaks in the anti-Polish Ukrainian revolts of the 18th-century led by Maksym Zalizniak and Ivan Honta led to the first meaning.

The word has been adopted into Ukrainian from the Crimea and the neighbouring region, where it has been used in some Kipchak, Oghuz and Slavic languages. The origin is the Turkic word &#x27;haydamak&#x27;, &#x27;to drive, to drive away&#x27;, the etymological vehicle being the Ottoman Turkish. The verb (h)ayda was probably derived from the onomatopoeic stem used to spur someone on: &#x27;hayda!&#x27;. Depending on the local context, it was understood to mean &#x27;driving someone or something away&#x27;, and later &#x27;to chase, to pursue&#x27;. In the infinitive Turkish verbs have the ending -mak or -mek. The ending -ak(a) however also exists in Ukrainian, in words with meanings somewhat related to each other, such as &quot;huljáka&quot;, &#x27;crouser&#x27; (crouse = brisk, livelyl, confident), &quot;pyjak(a)&quot;, &#x27;drunkard&#x27;, &quot;rozbyšaka&quot;, &#x27;brigand&#x27;, and that might have led to the initial meaning of &#x27;to chase, to pursue&#x27; evolving to mean &#x27;chaser, pursuer&#x27;, and finally &#x27;insurgent&#x27;. In different other languages the meaning of &#x27;brigand&#x27; given to hajdamak(a) took shape in accordance to the way their enemies saw the &quot;hajdamaks&quot;.

In Ottoman Turkish, haydamak used to mean &quot;a cattle-lifter, marauder&quot;, and in modern Turkish it means &quot;to attack, raid, drive cattle&quot;.

===Older Ukrainian terms===
Other more ancient exonyms of the same haidamaks include &quot;levenetz&quot; and &quot;deineka&quot;. Equivalents of &quot;haidamaka&quot; include &quot;opryshok&quot; in Ukrainian Galicia.

===In other languages===
The Romanian word &quot;haidamac&quot; means &#x27;strong, sometimes no-good man&#x27;.

The words &quot;hajduk&quot; used in Central Europe and the Balkans has a similar meaning.

===Historical connotations===

Because of the massacres of Jews, Jesuits, Uniates, and Polish nobility, the Polish language term &quot;Hajdamactwo&quot; became a pejorative label for Ukrainians as a whole. However, Ukrainian folklore and literature generally (with some notable exceptions) treat the actions of the haidamaks positively. &quot;Haidamaky&quot; (1841), an epic poem by Taras Shevchenko, treats its subjects both sympathetically and critically.

==History==
The haidamak movement consisted mostly of local free Cossacks (not members of any host) and peasantry (&quot;kozaky&quot; and &quot;holota&quot;), and rebels. 

Haidamaks waged war mainly against the Polish nobility and collaborationists in right-bank Ukraine, though the movement was not limited to the right bank only, and they participated in Zaporozhian raids on the Cossack szlachta in left-bank Ukraine as well. The latter raids occasionally deteriorated to common robbery and murder, for example in the so-called Matsapura case in the Left Bank in 1734.

Opposition to the szlachta and to Roman Catholics led to the haidamaka rebellions (&quot;haidamachchyna&quot;). Three major uprisings took place, in 1734, 1750, and the largest – usually referred to as Koliyivschyna in 1768.

The first uprising came in the war for control of the Polish Kingdom in 1734 after the death of Frederick Augustus II in 1733. Russian troops, brought in to remove King Stanisław I (Leszczyński), were initially seen as liberators from the Poles, and an insurrection developed in Kiev, spreading to Podolia and Volhynia. After Augustus III gained the throne of Poland-Lithuania in 1734, the Russian military suppressed the insurrection. Small raids by haidamakas against Polish nobility continued in the following years under the leadership of Hnat Holy.

In 1750 another uprising occurred as the haidamakas continued to receive popular sympathy. Based in the lands of the Zaporozhian Cossacks, they moved into the south of the Kiev Palatinate, generating a near-complete rebellion by Right-Bank Ukraine. Although they captured a number of towns and areas, they were eventually crushed due to lack of organization.

In 1768, led by Zaporozhian Cossack Maksym Zalizniak and leader of the Uman Cossack paramilitary group Ivan Gonta, the peasants were initially successful in conquering much of the Kiev and Bracław Voivodeships, as well as large chunks of Volhynia and Podolia. In captured territories the nobility, Ukrainian Catholics, Jesuits and above all the Jews, were murdered &quot;en masse&quot; (see Massacre of Uman), which led to a quick response by the Polish army. By July of the same year the Poles – with Russian military assistance – had suppressed the revolt, though bloody repression against the Cossacks lasted for several years. See Koliyivschyna article for more details.

The last flare-up of the Haydamak violence occurred in 1830s, during the Ustym Karmaliuk rebellion. This final chapter of Haydamaka history was unique in large part due to the support the rebellion enjoyed not only among the peasantry, but also among the Poles and the Jews marginalized and rendered destitute by the Russian Empire.

<doc id="410059" wikidata="Q1126099" url="?curid=410059" title="Coniston Water">
<text>Coniston Water is a lake in the Lake District in North West England. It is the third largest by volume, after Windermere and Ullswater, and the fifth-largest by area. The lake has a length of , a maximum width of , and a maximum depth of . Its outflow is the River Crake, which drains into Morecambe Bay via the estuary of the River Leven. The lake is in the unitary authority of Westmorland and Furness, and the ceremonial county of Cumbria.

==Geography and administration==
Coniston Water is situated within Furness, part of the North Lonsdale exclave of the historic county of Lancashire. It has been within the ceremonial county of Cumbria since 1974, and the Westmorland and Furness district since it replaced South Lakeland in 2023.

The lake is an example of a ribbon lake formed by glaciation. The lake sits in a deep U-shaped glaciated valley scoured by a glacier in the surrounding volcanic and limestone rocks during the last ice age.

To the north-west of the lake rises the Old Man of Coniston, the highest fell in the Coniston Fells group and the highest point in the historic county of Lancashire.

==Etymology==
&quot; &#x27;The king&#x27;s estate or village&#x27;. The second el.[ement] is OE tūn, and the whole name may, like numerous English Kingstons, be from OE &#x27;cyninges-tūn&#x27;. ... Scand[inavian] influence is, meanwhile, shown by the &#x27;-o-&#x27; of early and modern spellings, and Ekwall speculated that this could have been the centre of a &#x27;small Scandinavian mountain kingdom&#x27; &quot;.
Plus &quot;OE &#x27;wæter&#x27;, with the meaning probably influenced by its ON relative &#x27;vatn&#x27;.&quot;
(OE=Old English; ON=Old Norse).

==History==
Remains of agricultural settlements from the Bronze Age have been found near the shores of Coniston Water. The Romans mined copper from the fells above the lake. A potash kiln and two iron bloomeries show that industrial activity continued in medieval times. In the 13th and 14th centuries, Coniston Water was an important source of fish for the monks of Furness Abbey who owned the lake and much of the surrounding land. Copper mining continued in the area until the 19th century.

The lake was formerly known as &quot;Thurston Water&quot;, a name derived from the Old Norse personal name &#x27;Thursteinn&#x27; + Old English &#x27;waeter&#x27;. This name was used as an alternative to Coniston Water until the late 18th century.

The Victorian artist and philosopher John Ruskin owned Brantwood House on the eastern shore of the lake, and lived in it from 1872 until his death in 1900. Ruskin is buried in the churchyard in the village of Coniston, at the northern end of the lake. His secretary the antiquarian W. G. Collingwood wrote a historical novel &quot;Thorstein of the Mere&quot; about the Northmen who settled on the island in the lake.

The Victorian and Edwardian artist Henry Robinson Hall settled in Coniston during the Great War and is buried in the parish church graveyard.

Arthur Ransome set his children&#x27;s novel &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; and the sequels &quot;Swallowdale&quot;, &quot;Winter Holiday&quot;, &quot;Pigeon Post&quot; and &quot;The Picts and the Martyrs&quot; around a fictional lake derived from a combination of Coniston Water and Windermere. The fictional lake resembles Windermere, but the surrounding hills and fells resemble those of Coniston Water. Some of Coniston Water&#x27;s islands and other local landmarks can be identified in the novels. In particular the books&#x27; &quot;Wild Cat Island&quot; with its secret harbour is based on Peel Island. The Amazon River is based on the River Crake. The Swallows and Amazons series involve school holiday adventures in the 1930s. The movie adaptation (2016) of these stories was also partly filmed on Peel Island, Coniston Water. 

Historically, Coniston was part of Lancashire (North of the Sands), until Local Government reorganisation in 1974 when Cumbria was created.

==Waterspeed record ==

In the 20th century Coniston Water was the scene of many attempts to break the world water speed record. On 19 August 1939 Sir Malcolm Campbell set the record at 141.74 miles per hour () in &quot;Blue Bird K4&quot;. Between 1956 and 1959 Sir Malcolm&#x27;s son Donald Campbell set four successive records on the lake in &quot;Bluebird K7&quot;, a hydroplane; in 1967 he was killed just after achieving a speed of over 320 miles per hour () in &quot;Bluebird K7&quot; in a record-breaking attempt.

== Lady in the Lake ==
In recent times, Coniston Water has become known for a controversial murder case. Mrs Carol Park was dubbed the &quot;Lady in the Lake&quot; after the Raymond Chandler novel of the same name.

== Boating ==

The lake is ideal for kayaking and canoeing and there are a number of good sites for launching and recovery. It is paddled as the second leg of the Three Lakes Challenge.
The steam yacht &quot;Gondola&quot; tours the lake in the summer months, along with two smaller motorised launches (Campbell (previously Exonia and Cygnet).

Boats can be hired from the lakeside near the steam yacht, with various sizes of boat for hire, from small canoes and kayaks to large personal craft. Along with Ullswater and Derwentwater, Coniston Water has a mandatory waterspeed limit of . This is suspended temporarily for boats attempting new world waterspeed records during Records Week, usually the first week in November.

== In art and literature ==

Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s escapist poem &quot;Coniston Water&quot; illustrates an engraving of a painting entitled &quot;Coniston Water from Nebthwaite, Lancashire&quot; by Thomas Allom.

<text>High Holborn ( ) is a street in Holborn and Farringdon Without, Central London, which forms a part of the A40 route from London to Fishguard. It starts in the west at the eastern end of St Giles High Street and runs past the Kingsway and Southampton Row, becoming Holborn at its eastern junction with Gray&#x27;s Inn Road. The western stretch, as far as Drury Lane, was formerly known as Broad Street. On High Holborn, traffic (including cycles and buses) flows one-way westbound from its junction with Drake Street to its western end, and flows both ways for the remainder.

The nearest London Underground stations are Tottenham Court Road, Holborn, and Chancery Lane, all on the Central line which runs beneath High Holborn.

Landmarks along High Holborn include the Cittie of Yorke, at no. 22, and the Embassy of Cuba, at no. 167.

The street was a &quot;Feature site&quot; for introduction of the Camden bench.

High Holborn is the highest point in the City of London. At 22 metres (72 feet) above sea level, High Holborn is the lowest county top in England, if one considers the City a county.

<doc id="410066" wikidata="Q6585944" url="?curid=410066" title="List of awards and honours received by Nelson Mandela">
<text>This is a comprehensive list of awards, honours and other recognitions bestowed on Nelson Mandela. Mandela received more than 260 awards over 40 years, most notably the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993.

From 1994 to 1999, Mandela was President of South Africa. He was the first such African to be elected in fully representative democratic polls.

Before his presidency, Mandela was an anti-apartheid activist and leader of the African National Congress and its armed wing Umkhonto we Sizwe. He spent 27 years in prison, much of it in a cell on Robben Island. The rest of his incarceration was in Pollsmoor Prison, on convictions for crimes that included sabotage committed while he spearheaded the struggle against apartheid.

Following his release from prison on 11 February 1990, his advocacy of a policy of reconciliation and negotiation helped lead the transition to multi-racial democracy in South Africa. Since the end of apartheid, he was widely praised, even by former opponents.

Mandela died on 5 December 2013, a celebrated elder statesman who continued to voice his opinion on topical issues. In South Africa he is often known as &quot;Madiba&quot;, an aristocratic title adopted by the elderly members of the royal clan that he belongs to. This title has come to be synonymous with Nelson Mandela.

<doc id="410071" wikidata="Q719546" url="?curid=410071" title="Matei Basarab">
<text>Matei Basarab (; 1588, Brâncoveni, Olt – 9 April 1654, Bucharest) was a Wallachian Voivode (Prince) between 1632 and 1654.

==Reign==
Much of Matei&#x27;s reign was spent fighting off incursions from Moldavia, which he successfully accomplished in 1637, 1639, and 1653 – see Battle of Finta. He was an enlightened ruler, and is noted for introducing the printing press to Wallachia (1634) and creating the first Wallachian code of laws as well as patronizing art and religion (founder of the first upper school in his Principality). He built more than 45 churches and monasteries, being compared to Stephen the Great, the famous ruler of Moldavia.

His election in 1632 signified the first official exception to a rule set by custom. Basarab was merely a boyar (of the Craiovești family) and one not related to previous Princes (although it seems that a similar point can be made about such rulers as Michael the Brave). The reason for this choice has been explained as a reaction of indigenous boyars against competition from newly infiltrated Greeks and Levantines. It may also be because of these special circumstances that Matei used the surname &quot;Basarab&quot; – associated as it is with a fabricated legitimate lineage. 

Matei Basarab&#x27;s rule also coincides with the last stage in the decay of the lesser nobility, the result of political pressure from boyars and drastic economical changes (the revolt of the seimeni military under Constantin Șerban probably has this as its main cause).

It seems that the Prince was planning emancipation from Ottoman rule, as well as domination over Moldavia. He maintained a close relationship with the Transylvanian ruler George II Rákóczi, an ambitious, stronger, and more autonomous subject of the Turks.

He was married to Elena Năsturel.

==Laws and reforms==
Matei Basarab and his contemporary, the Moldavian Prince Vasile Lupu are credited with introducing the first written laws of the two Principalities. However, these two virtually identical sets of laws do not go against tradition, being merely the Romanian translation of Byzantine customs (&quot;pravile&quot;), alluded to in documents of the previous decades. The two collections under Matei Basarab are &quot;Pravila de la Govora&quot; (&quot;The Govora Code&quot;) in 1640 and &quot;Pravila lui Matei Basarab&quot; (&quot;Matei Basarab&#x27;s Code&quot;; also known as &quot;Îndreptarea Legii&quot; – &quot;The Re-shaping of Laws&quot;) in 1652.

<text>The lectern desk exists in two distinct forms, antique and modern.

==Antique lectern desk==
The antique is basically a lectern fitted with the conveniences needed to make writing easy, such as room for paper and writing implements. In a sense, it is a specialised and rarer form of standing desk. The term is sometimes used for large standing desks.

Because the antique lectern desk is smaller than most kinds of standing desks, it is suitable for writing in cramped quarters, in a residence or at a workplace. Most lectern desks have a slanted top with a lip, to keep pens and paper from sliding down.

Lectern desks can sometimes be found in churches.

==Modern lectern desk==

A rolling computer desk based on a single leg set on a four- or five-wheel stand is the most common modern form of lectern desk. It is usually sold directly by manufacturers or by catalog and online. It targets several distinct specialty markets such as hospitals and industrial plants.

<doc id="410076" wikidata="Q220653" url="?curid=410076" title="Vasile Lupu">
<text>Lupu Coci, known as Vasile Lupu (; 1595 – 1661), was the voivode of Moldavia between 1634 and 1653. He was of Albanian and Greek origin. Lupu had secured the Moldavian throne in 1634 after a series of complicated intrigues and managed to hold it for twenty years. Vasile was a capable administrator and a brilliant financier and was soon almost the richest man in the Christian East. His gifts to Ottoman leaders kept him on good terms with the Ottoman authorities.

==Early life==
The Coci family settled in Wallachia (Țara Rumânească) in the first half of the 16th century. His father, Nicolae (Neculai) Coci was an Albanian shopkeeper, the son of Constantin (Coce) and Ecaterina, who originated from Macedonia or Epirus. His mother was Greek. Nicolae entered Moldavian nobility in 1593. Nikolae was born in Arbanasi. According to different researchers it was a village in modern-day Bulgaria (Arbanasi or Dolno Arbanasi - today a suburb of Razgrad), while some historians claim Arbănași (modern Romania). Vasile Lupu received Greek education.

==Reign==
Lupu had held a high office under Miron Barnovschi, and was subsequently selected Prince as a sign of indigenous boyars&#x27; reaction against Greek and Levantine competition. This was because Vasile Lupu had led a rebellion against Alexandru Iliaș and his foreign retinue, being led into exile by Moise Movilă (although he was backed by Prince Matei Basarab and the powerful Pasha of Silistra, Abaza Mehmed Pasha). Despite having led the rebellion against Greek influence, Lupu maintained strong ties to the Greeks and the Patriarchate of Constantinople. He pursued a Greek-Orthodox policy and sought to become the new Byzantine Emperor.

His rule was marked by splendor and pomp. He was a builder of notable monuments (the unique Trei Ierarhi Monastery in Iași and the St. Paraskeva Church, Lviv, among others), a patron of culture and arts founding the Academia Vasiliană). These acts also had negative effects, the tax burdens being increased to an intolerable level.

After relations between the two Princes soured, Vasile Lupu spent much of his reign fighting the Wallachian Matei Basarab, trying to impose his son Ioan to the throne in Bucharest. His army was defeated twice in 1639 at Ojogeni and Nenișori and a third time, at Finta, in 1653. After this last battle, the Moldavian boyars rebelled and replaced him with the Wallachian favorite, Gheorghe Ștefan. Vasile Lupu went into exile and died while being kept in Turkish custody at Yedikule prison in Constantinople.

Lupu built a strong alliance with hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky, arranging the marriage of his own daughter Ruxandra Lupu to Khmelnytsky&#x27;s son Tymofiy (Tymish), who went on to fight alongside Lupu at Finta.

Vasile Lupu made alliances with Ottoman officials, in particular with former Grand Vizier Tabanıyassı Mehmed Pasha. Lupu&#x27;s association with the latter relied on their common Albanian origin.

===Laws and reforms===
Vasile Lupu introduced the first codified printed law in Moldavia, the &quot;Carte Românească de învățătură&quot; (&quot;Romanian book of learning&quot;, 1646, published in Iași), known as the &quot;Pravila lui Vasile Lupu&quot; (&quot;Vasile Lupu&#x27;s code&quot;). The document follows Byzantine tradition, being a translated review of customs and almost identical to its Wallachian contemporary equivalent.

===Endowments===
Lupu founded churches and monasteries throughout his lands. The liturgical language was described as &quot;vulgar Greek&quot; by Robert Bargrave who travelled the lands.

===Education===
Lupu founded the Princely High School of Trei lerarhi Church in 1640, which taught in Greek and Latin.

==Family==
The &quot;Coci&quot; last name was carried on by Stefan Coci (son of Vasile Lupu) who married the daughter of Petru Rareș, a voivode of Moldavia, but also by the descendant of Gabriel Coci named Hatmanul. The descending line of Coci intersects with aristocratic families from Moldavia, old families such as the Bucioc, Boulesti, and Abazesti.
==Representation in postal stamps==
Vasile Lupu is depicted in a stamp issued by the Post of Moldova in 1999 and in a stamp of Romania issued in 2019.

<text>Urbino ( , ; Romagnol: &quot;Urbìn&quot;) is a &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) in the Italian region of Marche, southwest of Pesaro, a World Heritage Site notable for a remarkable historical legacy of independent Renaissance culture, especially under the patronage of Federico da Montefeltro, duke of Urbino from 1444 to 1482. 

The town, nestled on a high sloping hillside, retains much of its picturesque medieval aspect. It hosts the University of Urbino, founded in 1506, and is the seat of the Archbishop of Urbino. Its best-known architectural piece is the Palazzo Ducale, rebuilt by Luciano Laurana.

== Geography ==
The city lies in a hilly region, at the foothills of the Northern Apennines and the Tuscan-Romagnolo Apennines. It is within the southern area of Montefeltro, an area classified as medium-high seismic risk. Nearly 65 seismic events have affected the town of Urbino between 1511 and 1998. They include 24 April 1741, when the shocks were stronger than VIII on the Mercalli intensity scale, with an epicenter in Fabriano (where it reached 6.08 on the moment magnitude scale).

== History ==
=== Origins and Middle Ages ===
The originally modest Roman town of Urbinum Mataurense (&quot;the little city on the river Mataurus&quot;) became an important strategic stronghold during the Gothic Wars of the 6th century. In 538, it was captured from the Ostrogoths by the Byzantine general Belisarius, and is frequently mentioned by the historian Procopius.

Pepin the Short (King of the Franks) presented Urbino to the Papacy in 754–56. Its commune later had some independence until around 1200, when it came into the possession of the House of Montefeltro. These noblemen had no direct authority over the commune; however, they could pressure it to elect them to the position of . Bonconte di Montefeltro obtained this title in 1213: Urbino&#x27;s population rebelled and formed an alliance with the independent commune of Rimini (1228), finally regaining independence in 1234. Eventually, though, the Montefeltro noblemen took control once more, and held it until 1508. In the struggles between the Guelphs and Ghibellines, when factions supported either the Papacy or the Holy Roman Empire respectively, the 13th and 14th century Montefeltro lords of Urbino were leaders of the Ghibellines of the Marche and in the Romagna region.

=== Period of Federico da Montefeltro ===
The most famous member of the Montefeltro family, Federico da Montefeltro, ruled as Duke of Urbino from 1444 to 1482. He was a very successful condottiere, a skillful diplomat and an enthusiastic patron of art and literature. He rose to power in 1444 as the son of Guidantonio, after a conspiracy and the murder of the legitimate heir Oddantonio, hated for his &quot;unbridled lust&quot; and excessive taxes.

Federico began a reorganization of the state, which also included a restructuring of the city according to a modern conception - comfortable, efficient and beautiful.

At his court, Piero della Francesca wrote on the science of perspective, Francesco di Giorgio Martini wrote his &quot;Trattato di architettura&quot; (&quot;Treatise on Architecture&quot;) and Raphael&#x27;s father, Giovanni Santi, wrote his poetical account of the chief artists of his time. Federico&#x27;s brilliant court, according to the descriptions in Baldassare Castiglione&#x27;s &quot;Il Cortegiano&quot; (&quot;The Book of the Courtier&quot;, published in 1528), set standards of what would characterize a modern European &quot;gentleman&quot; for centuries to come.

=== Cesare Borgia and the years of the Duchy Della Rovere ===
Cesare Borgia dispossessed Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, and Elisabetta Gonzaga in 1502, with the complicity of his father, Pope Alexander VI. After the attempt of Pope Leo X to appoint a young Medici as duke, thwarted by the early death of Lorenzo II de Medici in 1519, Urbino was part of the Papal States, under the dynasty of the dukes Della Rovere (1508–1631). They moved the court to the city of Pesaro in 1523 and Urbino began a slow decline that would continue until the last decades of the seventeenth century.

=== Annexation by the Papal States ===
In 1626, Pope Urban VIII definitively incorporated the Duchy into the papal dominions, the gift of the last Della Rovere duke, in retirement after the assassination of his heir, to be governed by the archbishop. The state was ruled thereafter by a papal legate, generally belonging to high ecclesiastical hierarchy. Following the annexation of the duchy by the Papal States, the rich artistic heritage (including furniture) of the Ducal Palace went to form, for the most part, the dowry of the last direct descendant of the Della Rovere, Vittoria della Rovere, who married Ferdinand II de Medici. These works went on to form the core of the future Uffizi Gallery. Among the works that went to Florence is the diptych of the Dukes of Urbino by Piero della Francesca. Other works of the Ducal Palace were brought to Rome, such as the Barberini Ex Tables of Fra Carnevale and the famous library, absorbed entirely by the Vatican Library in 1657.

=== The Albani and the French occupation ===
The eighteenth century opened with the election to the papacy (1701) of Cardinal Giovan Francesco Albani Urbino, under the name of Clement XI. This was a windfall for the city, especially in terms of arts and culture, thanks to funding by Pope Albani and his family. Major renovations took place, such as Palazzo Albani, the town hall, the archbishop&#x27;s palace, the Chapel Albani (inside the convent of St. Francis), Saint Joseph&#x27;s Oratory, and the internal structure of the churches of San Francesco, San Domenico and San Agostino. In addition, due to the patronage of the pope and his family, the Duomo di Urbino received many improvements. From July 1717 to November 1718 Urbino hosted the court of James Stuart, the exiled pretender to the British throne, who had the strong backing of the papacy.

With the death of Clement XI in 1721, the city began a long decline that has continued to the present day. After the pope&#x27;s death, the Albani family remained the main patron of the most significant works until the first half of the nineteenth century. In 1789, the collapse of the cathedral dome following a massive earthquake led to the total renovation of the church.

Between 1797 and 1800 the city was occupied by French troops, like much of northern and central Italy. Urbino and its territory lost many important works of art to the French, who moved objects to Paris or Milan, to the nascent galleries of the Louvre and Brera.

=== Redevelopment of the nineteenth century ===
The century opened with the consecration in 1809 of the new Duomo di Urbino, as designed by the architect Giuseppe Valadier. He also restored the city&#x27;s Montefeltro-era buildings such as the old seminary, adjacent to the church of St. Sergius, now partly occupied by the Hotel Raffaello.

Following the construction of the New Palace of Alban (1831), designed by architect Peter Ghinelli, which gave rise to the present Piazza della Repubblica that went on to form the first part of the future Corso Garibaldi, the city experienced a number of urban improvements designed to change the face of the city. From the construction of the Sanzio theater (1845–53) came the final realization of Corso Garibaldi, with a covered walkway on the downhill side to that ensure theater-goers were sheltered from rain and snow on their walk to the Piazza della Repubblica, with construction that lasted until the early part of the twentieth century. In addition, another important change was the destruction, in 1868, of a part of the walls to create a customs barrier, called Porta Nuova or barrier Margherita (in honor of Princess Margaret of Savoy), which was necessitated by a new road that ran along a stretch of the walls and was connected to Corso Garibaldi. This resulted in a new urban layout with the large spit of land below the Doge&#x27;s Palace incorporated into the city, called the Pincio.

These urban transformations brought about a change in access to the city. Instead of passing through narrow, winding streets, through the gates of the walls, now one could enter through the Porta Nuova in an easier and convenient way to arrive in the present Piazza della Repubblica and the Palazzo Ducale (the city center).

This urban renewal reflected many of the ideas of Fulvio Corboli but its design was largely done by the architect Vincenzo Ghinelli.

=== Unification of Italy ===
On 8 September 1860 the Piedmontese troops entered Urbino from Port Saint Lucia, forcing the surrender of the last resistance of the papal army under the portico of the childhood house of Raphael. But it was not until 29 September, with the capture of Ancona, that the total conquest of the Marche region was completed by the Piedmont army.

Between 4 and 5 November, the plebiscite was held for the annexation of the Marche to the Kingdom of Sardinia, which ended with 133,783 votes in favor, 260 votes against and 1,212 invalid ballots. In the province of Urbino (excluding the territory of Pesaro) the count was 21,111 for and 365 against with 29 invalid ballots. Subsequently, on 10 November, the Marche was included in the Statuto Albertino, and then, on 17 December, it was made official with the issuance of a royal decree.

The new government began the confiscation of various ecclesiastical goods, including good part of the convent of San Francisco (where a part of a botanical garden, designed by Vincenzo Ghinelli, was located), the monastery of Santa Chiara, that of San Girolamo, and many others.

=== First half of the twentieth century ===
The century began quietly. In addition to the artistic development from the Scuola del Libro, Urbino also began to grow as a university town, with the elevation to university faculty of nineteenth-century School of Pharmacy and the birth of the department of Education (approximately 1934). Due to these changes in the University, an increase in the student population led to housing shortages that highlighted the state of total unpreparedness of the city, so much that for the first time many students were housed in the homes of private citizens. The problem was partly solved with the establishment of the male boarding school &quot;Raphael&quot; at the beginning of the century, and the female boarding school &quot;Laura Battiferri&quot; in approximately 1926. 

The fascist dictatorship left its mark on the city, especially from an architectural point of view, with a fascist elementary school &quot;Giovanni Pascoli&quot; (1932) built on the ancient Garden of Saint Lucia (part of the duke&#x27;s private gardens), the restoration of the palace-Mauruzi Gherardi, then the seat of the court, as well as the Student House, to compensate for the shortage of accommodation as a result of the large increase in university population and housing for the maimed and disabled civilians.

In 1938, the city was designated as the headquarters for the fledgling Soprintendenza alle Gallerie e alle Opere d&#x27;Arte delle Marche, roughly translated as the Organization of Galleries and Works of Art of the Marche.

With the outbreak of World War II the city suffered no bombing, thanks to the large red cross painted on the roof of the Ducal Palace and an agreement between the Germans and the Allies. Only towards the end of the war did the retreating German troops try to destroy all the ramparts of the walls, but luckily the mines were tampered with by the workers the Germans had hired from Urbino. During the Second World War, the then Superintendent of the Galleries and Works of Art in Urbino in the Marche Pasquale Rotondi secretly placed around 10,000 priceless works (including those of Giorgione, Piero della Francesca, Paolo Uccello, Titian, Mantegna, Raphael and many more, from all the major museums in Italy) that were being stolen by the Nazis into the Rock of Sassocorvaro. His actions gained worldwide recognition and to this day the Rock of Sassocorvaro is known as the &quot;Ark of Art&quot;.

Urbino was liberated from the Nazi occupation on 28 August 1944, thanks to the British V Corps, Polish troops, and the heroic actions of partisan groups in the area. Some of the members of these partisan groups were captured by the Nazis and executed on the current Punto Panoramica, where memorials are now placed celebrating their sacrifice.

=== Urbino and De Carlo ===
The second half of the twentieth century was characterized in Urbino by the cooperation with the major public institutions (the University and the City) by the architect Giancarlo De Carlo. This relationship began in 1956 when Carlo Bo, former rector of the University, commissioned from De Carlo the internal renovation project of Montefeltro- Bonaventure building, headquarters of the University. Immediately after that, the Genoese architect was commissioned by the City to prepare the General Plan (1958–64) aimed at the recovery of the historical center, which had been in poor condition and was in danger of losing several neighborhoods including the Palazzo Ducale to the land subsidence below. This problem was solved thanks to state funding derived from two special laws enacted for the city (in 1968 and in 1982 ).

Subsequently, De Carlo realized several projects for the university including the college&#x27;s dormitories, near the Capuchin church outside the city center, an interesting example of how architecture can merge with the surrounding landscape. He also completed projects like the construction of the department of Magisterium (1968–76), the restructuring of the department of Law ( 1966–68 ) and the Battiferri building (1986–99) for the department of Economics. They are three significant examples of the inclusion of a contemporary architecture in an ancient surrounding, and are still studied today.

The seventies were marked by a collaboration with the Municipality for a project called Operation Mercatale (1969–72), which included the construction of a multi-story underground car park under Torricini&#x27;s famous Ducal Palace and the restoration of the helical ramp under the theater by Francesco di Giorgio Martini (1971–75), in collaboration with the City. They also developed the project of renovation of the Sanzio theater (1977–82) and the renovation project, much discussed, of the ancient Ducal Stables. In addition, thanks to the close relationship with De Carlo, the city has hosted twice (1976–81, and 1992–93) the laboratories of the ILAUD, founded and directed by the Genoese architect.
One of the last of De Carlo actions was the preparation, between 1989 and 1994, of the New General Plan.

== Maiolica ==

The clay earth of Urbino, which still supports industrial brickworks, supplied a cluster of earthenware manufactories (&quot;botteghe&quot;) making the tin-glazed pottery known as &quot;maiolica&quot;. Simple local wares were being made in the 15th century at Urbino, but after 1520 the Della Rovere dukes, Francesco Maria I della Rovere and his successor Guidobaldo II, encouraged the industry, which exported wares throughout Italy, first in a manner called &quot;istoriato&quot; using engravings after Mannerist painters, then in a style of light arabesques and &quot;grottesche&quot; after the manner of Raphael&#x27;s &quot;stanze&quot; at the Vatican. Other centers of 16th century wares in the Duchy of Urbino were at Gubbio and Castel Durante. The great name in Urbino majolica was that of Nicolo Pillipario&#x27;s son Guido Fontana.

== Main attractions ==

=== Palaces and public buildings ===
* The main attraction of Urbino is the Palazzo Ducale, begun in the second half of the 15th century by Federico II da Montefeltro. It houses the Galleria Nazionale delle Marche, one of the most important collections of Renaissance paintings in the world.
* Other buildings include Palazzo Albani (17th century), Palazzo Odasi and Palazzo Passionei.
* The Albornoz Fortress (known locally as &quot;La Fortezza&quot;), built by the eponymous Papal legate in the 14th century. In 1507-1511, when the Della Rovere added a new series of walls to the city, the rock was enclosed in them. It is now a public park.
* Raphael&#x27;s house and monument (1897).

=== Churches ===
* Duomo: the Cathedral of Urbino was founded in 1021 atop a 6th-century religious edifice. Federico II commissioned the design from the architect Francesco di Giorgio Martini, who also designed the Ducal Palace. Finished in 1604, the Duomo had a simple plan with a nave and two aisles, and was destroyed by an earthquake in 1789. The church was rebuilt in Neoclassic style by the architect Giuseppe Valadier, with work completed in 1801. The new church has a soaring dome, and houses a &quot;St Sebastian&quot; (1557), an &quot;Assumption&quot; (1701) by Maratta, and a famous &quot;Last Supper&quot; (1603–1608) by Federico Barocci.
* Sant&#x27;Agostino: the church was built in 13th-century Romanesque style, but largely modified in following centuries. The façade has a late-14th century almond portal in Gothic-Romanesque style, while the interior is greatly decorated. It houses a carved choir from the 16th century, created for the marriage of Costanzo Sforza and Camilla of Aragona. The bell tower is from the 15th century.
* San Francesco: This 14th-century church was originally a Gothic-Romanesque edifice, but an 18th-century restoration has left only the portico and the bell tower. The interior has a nave and two aisles, and houses the &quot;Pardon of St Francis&quot;, a 15th-century work by Barocci.
* Oratory of San Giovanni Battista: the oratory has 15th-century frescoes by Lorenzo Salimbeni
* Oratory of San Giuseppe (early 16th century), composed of two chapels: one of which contains a 16th-century stucco &quot;presepio&quot; or Nativity scene by Federico Brandani with highly naturalistic, life-size figures.
*San Bernardino: church outside the city center, housing the tombs of the Dukes of Urbino.

<doc id="410093" wikidata="Q951969" url="?curid=410093" title="Manuel Esquivel">
<text>Sir Manuel Amadeo Esquivel (2 May 1940 – 10 February 2022) was a Belizean politician. As leader of the United Democratic Party, he served as the second prime minister of Belize from 1984 to 1989, and then again from 1993 to 1998. His party&#x27;s victory in 1984 was the first time an opposition party had won a general election in Belize.

==Early life==
Esquivel was born in Belize City when it was the capital of the British Crown Colony of British Honduras. He attended St John&#x27;s College and later earned a Bachelor of Science degree in physics at Loyola University New Orleans; he subsequently pursued a postgraduate certificate in physics education at Bristol University, England.

== Politics ==
After the 1969 British Honduras election, Esquivel became head of the pro-business Liberal Party, which later merged with two other parties in 1973 to form the United Democratic Party (UDP). He was elected to the Belize City Council for two terms, and served as UDP chairman from 1976 to 1982. In the 1979 election, Esquivel was the UDP nominee for the Belize House of Representatives in the Freetown constituency. He was defeated by the incumbent Premier of Belize George Cadle Price, leader of the People&#x27;s United Party (PUP). Esquivel was then appointed a minority member of the Belize Senate. He defeated Philip Goldson for the open UDP leadership post in January 1983, becoming the first and thus far only politician to be elected leader of a major Belizean political party as a senator. Acting opposition leader Curl Thompson stayed on as the UDP&#x27;s House leader until the following election.

Esquivel was elected in December 1984 to the House of Representatives from the newly formed constituency of Caribbean Shores in Belize City, becoming prime minister for the first time shortly thereafter. The UDP&#x27;s victory was the first time an opposition party had won since the introduction of universal suffrage in 1954. He held the seat until the 1998 election, in which he was defeated by the PUP&#x27;s Jose Coye.

Earlier in 1984, the Price government was faced with a financial crisis, and had nearly depleted its financial reserves. After increasing tax rates twice, they entered into a standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Upon becoming prime minister, Esquivel proceeded with economic reforms under the advice of domestic experts such as Edney Cain. Esquivel began moving the economy of Belize away from his predecessor&#x27;s mixed economy model, encouraging foreign direct investment and the growth of tourism. In his second term, he implemented unpopular austerity measures such as public sector retrenchment. His government suspended pay raises from 1995 to 1997, but transferred 450,000 shares of Belize Telecommunications to a trust for the affected workers. The opposition PUP dubbed Esquivel as &quot;VATMAN&quot; for introducing a 15% value-added tax (VAT) in 1995. While Esquivel&#x27;s successor Said Musa repealed the VAT in 1999, Musa introduced a similar 10% goods and services tax (GST) in 2005.

After the UDP won the February 2008 election, Esquivel was appointed by Prime Minister Dean Barrow as senior advisor to government with the rank of minister on 12 February 2008. He was also appointed Chairman of the Central Bank of Belize on 18 January 2011. He stepped down as Chairman in September 2013, and resigned from the Cabinet in March 2014.

Esquivel continued to provide opinions on public issues after retiring. Having served on the national flag design committee, he advocated for a standardized definition of the flag and the coat of arms. Although his government had opposed cannabis trafficking, Esquivel expressed support for decriminalization of small amounts in 2017. He published an editorial in the &quot;Amandala&quot; newspaper supporting the 2019 Belizean territorial dispute referendum. When the government began administering COVID-19 vaccine to citizens over 60, Esquivel and his wife were among the first recipients.

== Personal life ==
Esquivel met his future wife, Kathleen Levy, while he was studying in Bristol. They wed in 1971 and had three children: David, Laura, and Ruth. Laura followed in her father&#x27;s footsteps as a public servant, serving as a Belize City councilor (2006-2012), Director of the Belize Tourism Board (2012-2014), and Deputy Chief of Mission at the Embassy of Belize in Washington, D.C.

Esquivel was a passenger in vehicle rollovers in 1996 and 2009 on the Western Highway. Both accidents were caused by wet road conditions. While he only sustained minor injuries from the first accident, Esquivel underwent facial surgery after the second.

Kathleen, Lady Esquivel, wrote a biography of Esquivel entitled &quot;Still Waters&quot;, which was published in 2021. Esquivel died on 10 February 2022, at the age of 81.

== Honours ==
Esquivel was appointed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom by Queen Elizabeth II in 1986. This life-time appointment confers the title &quot;Right Honourable&quot;. He also held an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Loyola University.

Esquivel was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 2010 New Year Honours.

In 2021, the Belize City Council renamed an overpass after Esquivel. The coastal road connecting Belize District and Stann Creek District is also named after him.

<text>The warbling vireo (Vireo gilvus) is a small North American songbird.

Its breeding habitat is open deciduous and mixed woods from Alaska to Mexico. It often nests in widely spaced trees, often cottonwood or aspen, along streams or rivers. It migrates to Mexico and Central America.

Measurements:

* Length: 4.7–5.1 in (12–13 cm)
* Weight: 0.3–0.6 oz (10–16 g)
* Wingspan: 8.7 in (22 cm)

They are mainly olive-grey on the head and upperparts with white underparts; they have brown eyes and the front of the face is light. There is a white supercilium. They have thick blue-grey legs and a stout bill. Western birds are generally smaller and have darker grey crowns.

Warbling vireos forage for insects in trees, hopping along branches and sometimes hovering. They also eat berries, especially before migration and in winter quarters, where they are – like other vireos – apparently quite fond of gumbo-limbo seeds, though they will not venture into human-modified habitat to get them.
They make a deep cup nest suspended from a tree branch or shrub, placed relatively high in the east and lower in the west. The male helps with incubation and may sing from the nest.

The warbling vireo&#x27;s song is a cheerful warble, similar to that of the painted bunting and the purple finch. There are subtle differences in song between eastern and western birds, at least where the ranges meet in Alberta. Some authorities split the eastern and western races of this species into separate species:
The western warbling vireo, &quot;V. swainsoni&quot;, includes &quot;V. g. swainsoni&quot;, which breeds from southeastern Alaska and southwestern Northwest Territories to the Sierra San Pedro Mártir, Baja California, and &quot;V. g. brewsteri&quot;, which breeds from southern Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana to south-central Oaxaca. These two subspecies winter in Mexico. The &quot;swainsoni&quot; group also includes &quot;V. g. victoriae&quot;, an isolated population breeding in the Sierra de la Laguna, Baja California Sur, and migrating to unknown wintering grounds.

The eastern warbling vireo, &quot;V. g. gilvus&quot;, breeds from central Alberta and northern Montana east and south through most of the United States and parts of southern Canada, outside the range of the previous group. It winters south of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec from south-central Chiapas to Nicaragua. It completes its autumn molt on the breeding grounds, while the &quot;swainsonii&quot; group completes it after leaving.

The brown-capped vireo (&quot;Vireo leucophrys&quot;), resident in Central America and northern South America, is sometimes considered conspecific with the warbling vireo.

<text>The city of Buzău (formerly spelled &quot;Buzeu&quot; or &quot;Buzĕu&quot;; ) is the county seat of Buzău County, Romania, in the historical region of Muntenia. It lies near the right bank of the Buzău River, between the south-eastern curvature of the Carpathian Mountains and the lowlands of Bărăgan Plain.

Buzău is a railway hub in south-eastern Romania, where railways that link Bucharest to Moldavia and Transylvania to the Black Sea coast meet. DN2, a segment of European route E85 crosses the city. Buzău&#x27;s proximity to trade routes helped it develop its role as a commerce hub in older days, and as an industrial centre during the 20th century.

During the Middle Ages, Buzău was a market town and Eastern Orthodox episcopal see in Wallachia. It faced a period of repeated destruction during the 17th and 18th centuries, nowadays symbolized on the city seal by the Phoenix bird. In the 19th century, after the end of that era, the city began to recover. The economy underwent industrialization, Buzău became a railway hub, and public education became available. At this time, the Communal Palace, the city&#x27;s landmark building, and Crâng Park, the main recreational area, were built. The communist regime after World War II brought forced industrialization and the tripling of the city&#x27;s population. Some of the factories open at the time are still functioning within the framework of market economy.

There are no universities based in Buzău, and only a few universities from other cities have remote learning facilities here. The main educational institutions here are B.P. Hasdeu high-school (where Nobel laureate George Emil Palade studied) and Mihai Eminescu high-school. The city has a number of other secondary schools, in addition to elementary schools. The Vasile Voiculescu County Library and Buzău County Museum are based in the city. The latter also manages an ethnography exhibit in the city, as well as the Vasile Voiculescu memorial house in Pârscov and the amber exhibit at Colți.

== Etymology ==
The city is named after the nearby river. In turn, the river is mentioned under the name (&quot;Mouseos&quot;) in a document written in Greek and dated 376 AD, recounting the martyrdom of Sabbas the Goth. Historian Vasile Pârvan thought that this name is a Greek misspelling of the Thracian word &quot;Bouzeos&quot; (by losing a &quot;π&quot; from the &quot;Μπ&quot; group, which is pronounced like a Latin &quot;B&quot;). He suggested that the name comes from the Thracian root &quot;Buzes&quot;, with the addition of the &quot;-eu&quot; suffix, a form of the Greek-Latin suffix &quot;-aios&quot;.

== History ==

The written history of the city begins with that of Wallachia. It was certified as a market town and customs point during the reign of Dan II. Archeological sites belonging to Gumelnița and Monteoru cultures prove the presence of human inhabitants before the Christian era. During the Middle Ages, there was also a fortress of Buzău, but only a few passing mentions in foreign documents are kept. The market that was already flourishing in 1431, has also become an Orthodox episcopal see in the early 16th century.

In the 17th century, an era of war and foreign invasions began, that affected the town and its surroundings. They began with Michael the Brave&#x27;s participation in the Long Turkish War and ended with the Wallachian uprising of 1821. Natural disasters (epidemics, earthquakes) also took their toll, leading to destruction and depopulation of Buzău. However, the inhabitants always returned and rebuilt the city, which led early 18th century local authorities to use the Phoenix bird on the city seal, as a symbol of rebirth.

The 19th century brought a time of cultural and economical development. The Communal Palace, the city&#x27;s main landmark, was built at the time, after the city developed its industry and became a railway hub in the 1870s. Schools were open, such as the Theological Seminary în 1836, and the B. P. Hasdeu high school in 1867, and theatre plays were produced (starting 1852): the &quot;Moldavia&quot; theatre house was built in 1898 and used throughout the first half of the 20th century as the main concert and theatre hall, where artists such as George Enescu, C. I. Nottara and Nicolae Leonard performed. For short periods of time, Ion Luca Caragiale and Constantin Brâncuși have lived and worked here.

During World War I, Buzău came under German occupation after mid-December 1916, and many inhabitants took refuge in the nearby villages or in Western Moldavia. The city resumed its development after the war. The interbellum brought about the first sport matches (association football and boxing) and the &quot;Metalurgica&quot; factory, a private business that was to be later confiscated by the communists, and continues to this day as part of a joined venture.

After World War II, the industrialization of Buzău was forcefully accelerated, and its population tripled in less than 50 years; new inhabitants were brought to work in newly built factories mainly in the south of the city. Buzău has profoundly changed its appearance, working class quarters being built instead of the old commercial streets, some historical buildings, such as the Moldavia Theatre, were demolished. Their cultural role was taken over by the Labor Unions&#x27; Cultural Center and then by &quot;Dacia&quot; Cinema.

In 2021, there was a project, known as &quot;Buzău Mare 2021&quot; (&quot;Greater Buzău 2021&quot;), that aimed to unite Buzău with the commune of Țintești. On 26 September 2021, a referendum was done to decide this, but as only 10.03% of the population of Buzău voted, which is below the legal threshold requiring a voter turnout of 30%, the results were considered null and Țintești and Buzău were left separate.
=== Historical buildings ===
Eight historical monuments classified as having national importance exist in Buzău: the church of the Birth of Christ (1649, also known colloquially as the &quot;Greeks&#x27; church&quot; or the &quot;Merchants&#x27; church&quot;) along with its belfry; the courthouse (20th century); the church of the Annunciation from the former Banu monastery (16th century); the church of the Dormition in Broșteni district, (1709, along with the belfry erected in 1914); the headquarters of the orthodox bishopric with the church of the Dormition (1649), the chapel (1841), the episcopal palace (17th century), the old seminary (1838), the chancellery (19th century), gate belfry and the compound wall (18th century); the Vergu-Mănăilă mansion (18th century, which currently hosts the ethnography exhibit of the County Museum); Vasile Voiculescu County Library (1914); and the Communal Palace (city hall, 1899–1903).

One public forum monument and twelve memorial monuments are included in the list of historical monuments in Buzău County with local importance, including the urban area of Cuza Vodă street (19th century) in the old town, Crâng park, the Albatros Villa (that used to belong to Alexandru Marghiloman) and the park, the Jewish temple, the buildings of B.P. Hasdeu and Mihai Eminescu high-schools, a house where Hortensia Papadat-Bengescu lived for a few years, and some of the tombs in Dumbrava cemetery, such as one that was originally decorated with the statue &quot;Prayer&quot; by Constantin Brâncuși (nowadays replaced by a replica).

==Geography==
The city is located in the center of the county, 100 km north-east of Bucharest, in the south-east of Romania, taking up a total area of , at the outermost curvature of the Subcarpathian foothills, at the crossroads of the three main Romanian historical provinces: Wallachia, Transylvania, and Moldavia. It is entirely placed on the right bank of Buzău river, which forms its northern limit. The shape of the city is oblong, longer along the river and shorter across. It reaches altitudes of 101 meters in the north-west, near the foothills, going down to 88 meters on the riverbank, while the average altitude of 95 meters is the same as the altitude of Dacia square, in the city center. Thus, Buzău is placed in a flat area, with a height difference of just 10 meters along a 4-kilometer line.

=== Waterways ===
Buzău river is the northern limit of the city. This river has created an underground basin that it permanently fuels with water. These underground waters are a main source of drinking water, and their excess overflows to a marshy wetland south of the city, in the neighboring communes Costești, Stâlpu, and Țintești, with small but steady springs, that ultimately form the Călmățui river.

===Climate===
Annual rainfall is circa 500 mm and in winter the snow cover can be as high as 30 cm. The Buzău River has a fluctuating flow. Especially in spring, when it collects melted snow from the mountain area, its level rises. The city was, however, built away from its deep and wide valley, so the river never floods the city. Even at the major floods of 2005, the waters caused no problem in the city proper, but it seriously damaged both bridges across it located in the city, which is also protected by levees, and by the small Cândești dam, north-west of Buzău. The local authorities consider, however, that their strategy of defense against flood does not adequately cover the city&#x27;s belt road, part of DN2, which follows the river for a short stretch.

The climate is humid continental, classified as &quot;Dfa&quot; in Köppen climate classification and as &quot;Dc&quot; in Trewartha climate classification, with an average 92 freezing days a year (16 with temperatures below −10 °C), but also with 92 days of hot summer. and 25.8 days with snow depth over . Local winds include the Crivăț, a cold north-easterly and sometimes easterly wind in winter, and the Austru, a south-westerly wind that brings dry air in summer and leads to warmer days in winter.

===Flora and fauna===

The flora of Buzău is more diverse in the western forest of Crâng, 189 ha of oak forest, a remainder of the ancient Codrii Vlăsiei. The Crâng park itself takes up 10 hectares of this forest and makes up the main green area of Buzău. It is not designated as a protected area itself, but a few species of plants are protected inside it, such as the &quot;fritillaria meleagris&quot; and &quot;iris brandzae&quot;. In the neighboring communes of Țintești and Costești there are other remainders of Codrii Vlăsiei Frasinu and Spătaru forests, respectively. In the yard of the building at the intersection of Crizantemelor and Tudor Vladimirescu streets, across the street from the park in front of B. P. Hasdeu high school and the Banu church, there is a century-old oak, locally protected as a monument of nature. 6% of the Lunca Buzăului protected area, a Natura 2000 site managed by the Ecological University of Bucharest, lies within city limits, in the north and east.

Most of the streets in Buzău have trees planted alongside, chestnut on Nicolae Bălcescu boulevard and linden on Unirii boulevard. In their gardens, the locals grow roses, hyacinths, tulips, local peonies, and petunia, as well as grapevines and Virginia creepers for shade. The wild fauna in Buzău is made up of city-dwelling species. The house sparrow and the collared dove are ubiquitous, and the most present small mammals are the wild polecat and the brown rat. Lakes are populated with small fish, such as bitterlings and eel, as well as snails and green lizards.

During the migration season, a parliament of short-eared owls has made a habit of spending a few days in some tall fir trees located in the yard of the Forestry Inspector&#x27;s Office in the city center. Experimental crops from the city&#x27;s Research and Development Station for Olericulture sometimes attract wild boars from the riverside forests.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2011 census, the city has inhabitants, a decrease from the previous census, in 2002, when  had been recorded. Most inhabitants are Romanians (88.43%), with a Roma minority (4.73%). Ethnic affiliation is unknown for 6.69% of the population. Most inhabitants practice Orthodox Christianity (91.98%). Religious affiliation is unknown for 6.75% of the population.

=== Ethnic communities ===
The main ethnic minority in the city are the Roma. Throughout history, other communities have existed in Buzău, but nowadays they are nearly extinct. Those that left their mark the most on the city were the Jewish people and the Bulgarians.

==== Roma ====
Settled after the 16th century by the Orthodox bishopric on its estate located north-west of the market town of Buzău, in Simileasca and Iorguleasca villages, Roma people have lived as slaves who worked on the bishopric&#x27;s land. After they were freed in the 19th century and, with the union between Wallachia and Moldavia, the new country got a new territorial division, Simileasca became a commune. In 1968, this commune was dissolved and integrated with Buzău. The Roma community is still located mostly in this part of the city, and it preserves its identity, although its leaders believe that Roma people in other parts of the city, who no longer speak their people&#x27;s language, accept assimilation by the majority Romanians, and declare themselves Romanian at the census. The community is faced with endemic poverty, high illiteracy, lack of professional qualifications and high school dropout rates, which all expose it to permanently being manipulated by politicians for elections. Many Roma people went abroad, especially in the countries of Northern Europe. The municipality also runs programs to improve theirs status, and School no. 14, located in Simileasca, is the main focus of these actions. Pupils of this school publish a bilingual school newspaper, in Romani and Romanian, which promotes Roma integration into society.

==== Jews ====

Although mentioned in documents as early as the 16th century, the Jews of Buzău became an especially important community starting with the cultural and economical development period of the 19th century. A large proportion of them were merchants and craftsmen. The Jewish cemetery appeared in 1853 and a temple dates from 1885. Between the two World Wars, 10% of the population of Buzău was Jewish, a large percentage compared to other cities in Wallachia, but significantly smaller than those in Moldavia, which saved the community from the brunt of the repression by Antonescu&#x27;s government. Still, during World War II, the Jews had to endure some persecutions: obligated to do compulsory work (authorities abused of the law, and extended the age of the people who had to do this work, as well as the body of the work itself), and to pay 15 million lei (four times the tax) for &quot;The Reunification Loan&quot;; certain types of objects were confiscated from them and special restrictions were imposed. The community had to host orphans whose parents were murdered in the Holocaust, before they were deported to Transnistria. During these persecutions, the Jewish community was defended by captains Stroie and Ionescu, by the Scânteie and Stahu families, and by Anghel Anuțoiu from Vrancea, a man who informed members of the community of upcoming Nazi raids, saving many lives, including that of Rabbi Simon Bercovich, whom he aided to leave the city and go into hiding. After the war, most Jews of the city moved to Israel, and left behind a Jewish community of only a few tens of people. Some of the personalities of the Jewish community in Buzău were painter Margareta Sterian and philosopher Ludwig Grunberg.

==== Bulgarians (&quot;Serbs&quot;) ====
In the 18th century, to avoid Ottoman repression against Christians in the Balkans, groups of Bulgarians settled in Wallachia where they enjoyed freedom to practice Christianity; some of these groups came to Buzău. The locals called them &quot;Serbs&quot; as a generic term for South-Slavs. The new immigrants soon started developing vegetable gardens as their houses were in the vicinity of the river that provided them with plenty of water, while local farmers were focusing more on raising livestock and growing cereals. Although the Bulgarian community was in time assimilated by the Romanians, to this day locals use the word &quot;Serb&quot; as a synonym to &quot;one who grows vegetables&quot;.

== Government ==
Buzău is administered by a mayor and a local council consisting of 23 councillors. The mayor, Constantin Toma, of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), has been in office since 2016. After the 2020 local elections, the local council has the following political makeup:

Buzău is not subdivided into any lower units, but local authorities guide their projects and strategies according to an informal division by districts. In &quot;Strategia 2014–2020&quot;, a strategical document of the mayor&#x27;s office, the following districts of Buzău were identified: Center, Micro 12/Indepenedenței, Marghiloman, Dorobanți, Nicolae Bălcescu, Simileasca, Micro 14, Poștă, Mihai Viteazul, Pod Horticolei, Luceafărul, Broșteni and the Industrial Zone.

Buzău takes on the administrative role of capital of Buzău County, therefore almost all county-level public services are headquartered there. Additionally, at national level, Buzău is the headquarters of the 2nd Infantry Division (&quot;Getica&quot;; former 2nd Romanian Army), one of the three divisions that make up the Romanian Land Forces, as well as three battalions under its command one of engineers, one of signals, and one of logistics. Near the city, in the village of Boboc, there is a military aviation school.

The highest court functioning in the city is the Buzău Tribunal, with authority over the entire county. The jurisdiction of the Tribunal covers all the four local courts (&quot;judecătorii&quot;) in the county, of which Buzău Local Court is in the city and takes cases related to Buzău and 34 surrounding communes, the largest jurisdiction of the four. The higher court to all these is the Court of Appeals in Ploiești.

In the Romanian Parliament, Buzău elects deputies on the lists associated with Buzău County. Of the seven deputies elected in 2016 on these lists, six (social democrats Marcel Ciolacu, Ionela Viorela Dobrică, Sorin Lazăr, Dănuț Păle, Nicolaie-Sebastian-Valentin Radu; and Adrian Mocanu from the People&#x27;s Movement Party) have their office in Buzău, while only the liberal Cristinel Romanescu has his in Râmnicu Sărat.

In the late 19th century, local statesman Alexandru Marghiloman, owner of a large estate and a mansion near the city, became prominent. Germanofile, Marghiloman was prime minister around the end of World War I, when Romania was compelled to sign the Treaty of Bucharest of 1918 and began the process of integrating Bessarabia, which had proclaimed its union with Romania in mid-April of that year. Another known contemporary politician from Buzău is Cătălin Predoiu; initially, an independent Minister of Justice in the government of Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu, Predoiu became a member of the National Liberal Party (PNL), after which he quit in 2008 to continue as minister, and in 2013 has attempted to obtain the presidential nomination of the Democratic Liberal Party (PDL) for the next year&#x27;s election; eventually, that party merged with the PNL, who nominated Klaus Iohannis, and Predoiu became shadow prime-minister.

==Economy==

=== Economic history ===
During the Middle Ages, Buzău&#x27;s economy was based on trade, as the market town began as a customs and exchange point, and developed due to its position at the curvature of the Carpathians, in a place where roads that connected Wallachia to Moldavia and Transylvania met. The old market town tradition is still preserved in the &quot;Drăgaica&quot; fair, held every June around Midsummer, bringing together small producers and merchants from diverse regions of Romania.

The agricultural reform during Alexandru Ioan Cuza led some of the Bulgarian gardeners to rent in 1897 și 1898 some land acquired by the state from the bishopric. The developed a distribution network for their produce both in Buzău, and in other nearby cities such as Brașov, Ploiești, or Râmnicu Sărat. Their activity became even more lucrative after the land reform of 1921.

After the period of repeated invasions and destruction ended in the 19th century, the economy began to industrialize as well. Towards the end of that century, the development of a Romanian railway network made Buzău one of its important hubs and pushed the small craftsmen&#x27;s shops to evolve into industrial installations. The first such facility was the &quot;Garoflid mill&quot;, open in 1883, that worked also as a cloth factory. În 1894, an oil refinery of the &quot;Saturn&quot; society was built; this refinery was to function for 50 years.

After a dramatic nationwide decrease caused by the First World War (the 1919 output was a quarter of the one in 1913), the industrial development picked up steam during the interbellum. One of the main components of the local industry was milling. The first industrial mill in the city, &quot;Garoflid&quot;, renamed &quot;Zangopol&quot; after its new owner, had reached a capital of 5 million lei in 1928 and, 30 de million in 1938, while the company that operated it had around 100 employees. Another business started at this time was &quot;Metalurgica și Turnătorie – S.A.&quot; (Metallurgy and Foundry), founded in 1928 with a capital of over 9 million lei. Although it had an initially difficult period, as it was closed during the Great Depression, it was reopened in 1933, only to be closed again in 1940 and 1944, during World War II.

After World War II, on 11 June 1948 all factories were requisitioned by the Communist government, who also began a program of forced industrialization, even though some of the industries that were being developed were unfit to the region. In 1965, the 318 ha Buzău South industrial platform began to be built around the old location of the &quot;Saturn&quot; refinery, blown up during the war. It was the location of the city&#x27;s most important factories that were developed at the time: the Steel Wire and Steel Wire Products Enterprise (after 1990, &quot;Ductil&quot;), the Railway Machinery Enterprise (after 1990, &quot;Apcarom&quot;), &quot;Metalurgica&quot; (the one founded in 1928), the Glass and Windows Factory (after 1991, &quot;Gerom S.A.&quot;).

Other facilities were located in other parts of the city, such as the Contactors Enterprise, in the north-east, and the Plastic Works (after 1990, &quot;Romcarbon S.A.&quot;) in the north.

Despite the forced industrialization, Buzău was spared from becoming dependent on a single industry, and there was no single point of failure for the city&#x27;s economy. According to the new law of commerce of 1990, that came after the fall of Communism, these factories were organised as state-owned companies, and were privatised. Most of them survived the transition to a market economy, as many of them thus became viable.

=== Present economy ===
Currently, the largest Buzău-based company is Romet, a holding company made up of multiple firms that produse isolation materials for water and gas pipes, water filters, fire extinguishers and other related products. It was successful in the 1990s, with the &quot;Aquator&quot; home water purifier. In 1999, it also acquired &quot;Aromet S.A.&quot;, the company that operated the 1928 &quot;Metalurgica&quot; factory.

Other Buzău-based companies were privatised by programs supervised by the World Bank. &quot;Apcarom S.A.&quot;, the only Romanian producer of railway equipments, was acquired by the Austrian company VAE, and in 2008 had a capital of 7.38 million lei. &quot;Ductil S.A.&quot;, one of the largest companies in the city, was privatised in 1999 and divided subsequently, during 1999–2000 by the new majority shareholder, FRO Spa, who only kept the electrodes and welding equipment facilities, and sold out the others. The steel wire, welded metal net, concrete and iron works became Ductil Steel S.A. and passed to the Italian company Sidersipe. The iron powder works became &quot;Ductil Iron Powder&quot;. In 2007, FRO Spa sold &quot;Ductil S.A.&quot; to the Russian company Mechel, for 90 million euro. &quot;Zahărul S.A.&quot;, the town&#x27;s sugar producer, was acquired by &quot;Agrana România&quot;, an Austrian-based group that also owned other sugar factories in Roman, a starch factory in Țăndărei and a juice facility in Vaslui.

Milling is still present on the local market: the largest local producer is Boromir Prod, controlled by businessman Constantin Boromiz, owner of the &quot;Boromir&quot; group, who also owns Boromir Ind Vâlcea, Panmed Mediaș and Comcereal Sibiu.

The economy is still more oriented towards industry rather than services, which, according to a 2016 survey of the World Bank, made it more attractive to the labor force of lower qualification (at best with a high school degree). The same survey showed that most of the labor force in the city came from within the county, as Buzău is the center of a highly rural, compact and densely populated area. The city was found to be in competition with larger cities for the labor force from other counties, a feature it shares with Alexandria. The proximity of Bucharest makes Buzău itself a source of internal migration, thus orbiting the capital city. Buzău is the second city (closely after Ploiești, a city with almost double the population), by the number of employees in Bucharest coming from other cities between 1991 and 2011; the survey points out that this has been a disadvantage, but might become an opportunity in the future.

== Transport ==

===Rail===
Buzău is one of the main hubs of Romanian Railways, as it connects Bucharest and Ploiești with Focșani, Galați and Constanța. The city railway station was open in 1872, along with the Bucharest-Galați railway.

A branch of this railway, from Buzău to Mărășești was opened a few years later, on 13 June 1881, and it was the first railway designed by Romanian engineers.

The Buzău-Nehoiașu line, open in 1908, connects Buzău to the smaller towns and villages along the Buzău River valley, including Nehoiu and Pătârlagele.

===Road===
Buzău is crossed by national road DN2 (part of European route E85), which connects the city to Bucharest to the south and to Râmnicu Sărat and the main cities of Western Moldavia to the north. National road DN1B (European Route E577) branches out of DN2 in Buzău. This road connects the city to Ploiești. In the north of the city, DN10 also branches from DN2. It crosses the Carpathians at their south-eastern curvature through Buzău Pass towards Brașov. The south of Buzău is also crossed by national road DN2B, which branches from DN2 în the neighboring commune of Costești, leading eastward to Galați and Brăila. In Buzău, county road DJ203D branches from DN2B. It leads south to Țintești and Smeeni, where it ends in , a road along which it helps connect Buzău to Slobozia.

In the Buzău city area, the only functional road bridge over Buzău River is the one crossing with DN2 to Mărăcineni. There is another road bridge, connecting the city to Vadu Pașii, near the railway bridge. It was however closed after it was destroyed by a flash flood in 2005, and repairs kept being postponed, which had an impact on the economy of the neighboring communes in the north-east of the city, as it remains used only by pedestrians and cyclists. Works began in the fall of 2017. The bridge was renovated and opened for cars and buses again in 2021.

Two main bust stations, one in the north and one in the south next to the railway station, as well a few other secondary bus stops, are used by private transportation companies that operate services to other cities or nearby villages.

===Air===
Buzău has no civil airport. The only air transport infrastructure present in the city is the military airport and heliport south-west of the city, but it is used only by emergency sanitary flights. Civil air traffic for Buzău is performed through Henri Coandă International Airport in Otopeni, 110 km away, the main air hub for Wallachia.

===Public transportation===
10 bus lines connect residential areas to industrial areas (including Buzău South industrial platform), the city center and the railway station. There are a few taxi companies licensed by the city also operating in the surrounding villages.

==Education and culture==
The first school in Buzău was the school for church and icon painters, opened by Chesarie Căpățână, the bishop of Buzău. The school functioned at the bishopric of Buzău, and was managed by Nicolae Teodorescu. Gheorghe Tattarescu started learning painting here.

The city&#x27;s most important educational landmark is the &quot;Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu&quot; National College, attended by the Nobel prize winner George Emil Palade in his youth. The &quot;Hasdeu&quot; high school was inaugurated in 1867.

The city&#x27;s public library was opened in 1893, under the name of &quot;Carol I Public Library&quot;. Later it took the name of Vasile Voiculescu, Buzău&#x27;s most prominent author, writer, and poet.

The &quot;George Ciprian&quot; stage theatre was created in 1996. It does not have an acting crew of its own, relying on contracts. Its first manager was playwright Paul Ioachim.

The first university in the city was the Economic University College, inaugurated in 1992, a branch of the Academy of Economic Studies in Bucharest.

The main museum in Buzău is the &quot;Buzău County Museum&quot;, which exhibits items related to the region&#x27;s history. The same museum oversees the ethnography exhibition at the Vergu-Mănăilă House, as well as the &quot;Amber Museum&quot; in Colți and the &quot;Vasile Voiculescu Memorial House&quot; in Pârscov.

==Coat of Arms==
The coat of arms of Buzău is the heraldic symbol standing for the city of Buzău, Romania. The city&#x27;s first recorded coat of arms dates back to 1831, and since then, the coat of arms has mostly kept its features, under different designs.

===Description and symbolism===
The shield is parted by a wavy azure fess. The upper half further parted per pale. In the right quarter, on azure, there is the image of the city&#x27;s Communal Palace standing on a vert terrace. In the left corner, on gules, a mace and a sword, argent, crossed, with an or crown on top. The lower half shows, on argent, a Phoenix bird, sable, rising from a gules bonfire.

The bludgeon and sword stand for the battles that have taken place around the city, throughout history, and the Phoenix (symbol of rebirth) symbolizes the repeated reconstruction undergone by Buzău during the early modern times, as the city was destroyed by war and natural disasters, and depopulated by epidemics.

The shield is topped by a mural crown with seven towers, which shows the city&#x27;s status as a county seat.

===History===
The first seal of Buzău dates back to the year 1831 and shows a Phoenix bird and a church. The church stood for the bishopric based in Buzău, while the Phoenix bird stood for the periods of destruction and subsequent reconstruction that the city had recently undergone.

The Communal Palace, inaugurated in 1901, became a symbol of the city and eventually made its way on the official coat of arms. Thus, the inter-war coat of arms of Buzău is similar to the present one, except for the mural crown which only had five towers, and a golden border on the shield.
After World War II, no symbol was used until 1970, when the communist government adopted a set of new insignia for the Romanian cities. The 1970 coat of arms was divided party per fess, with an inescutcheon divided party per pale and charged with the crest of Communist Romania (hammer and sickle symbol of the Romanian Communist Party on red, dexter; flag of Romania, sinister). The upper half was divided party per pale, azure and gules, with an argent Communal Palace on the right quarter, and industrial towers on the left quarter. The lower half retained the sable Phoenix rising from the gules bonfire, which had, by then, become the main symbol of Buzău.

After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, the Communist symbol was abolished and, again, the city was left without a coat of arms until 2006, when the present coat of arms was approved by the Romanian government.

<text>Timothy O&#x27;Reilly (born 6 June 1954) is an Irish-American author and publisher, who is the founder of O&#x27;Reilly Media (formerly O&#x27;Reilly &amp; Associates). He popularised the terms open source and Web 2.0.

==Education and early life==
Born in County Cork, Ireland, Tim O&#x27;Reilly moved to Hong Kong with his family when he was a baby. He has three brothers and three sisters. As a teenager, encouraged by his older brother Sean, O&#x27;Reilly became a follower of George Simon, a writer and adherent of the general semantics program. Through Simon, O&#x27;Reilly became acquainted with the work of Alfred Korzybski, which he has cited as a formative experience.

In 1973, O&#x27;Reilly enrolled at Harvard College to study classics and graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1975. During O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s first year at Harvard, George Simon died in an accident.

==Career==
After graduating, O&#x27;Reilly completed an edition of Simon&#x27;s &quot;Notebooks, 1965–1973&quot;. He also wrote a well-received book on the science fiction writer Frank Herbert and edited a collection of Herbert&#x27;s essays and interviews. O&#x27;Reilly got started as a technical writer in 1977. He started publishing computer manuals in 1983, setting up his business in a converted barn in Newton, Massachusetts, where about a dozen employees worked in a single open room. In 1989, O&#x27;Reilly moved his company to Sebastopol, California, and published the &quot;Whole Internet User&#x27;s Guide and Catalog&quot;, which was a best-seller in 1992. O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s business, then known as O&#x27;Reilly &amp; Associates, steadily grew through the 1990s, during which period it expanded from paper printed materials to web publishing. In 1993, the company&#x27;s catalogue became an early web portal, the Global Network Navigator, which in 1995 was sold to America Online.

The company suffered in the dot-com crash of 2000. As book sales decreased, O&#x27;Reilly laid off about seventy people, approximately a quarter of staff, but thereafter rebuilt the company around ebook publishing and event production. In 2011, Tim O&#x27;Reilly gave control of O&#x27;Reilly Media to the company&#x27;s CFO, Laura Baldwin, but kept his longtime title of CEO. 

As a venture capitalist, O&#x27;Reilly has invested in companies such as Fastly, Blogger, Delicious, Foursquare, Bitly, and Chumby. O&#x27;Reilly serves on the board of directors of Safari Books Online, Maker Media, PeerJ, and the nonprofit organization Code for America. He was a board member of Macromedia until its 2005 merger with Adobe Systems, and of MySQL AB until its sale to Sun Microsystems. In February 2012, he joined the UC Berkeley School of Information Advisory Board. 

In 2017, O&#x27;Reilly published the book &quot;WTF? What&#x27;s the Future and Why It&#x27;s Up to Us&quot; about technology&#x27;s potential to enhance the human experience.

===Early causes===
In 1996, O&#x27;Reilly fought against a 10-Connection Limit on TCP/IP NT Workstations, writing a letter to the United States Department of Justice, Bill Gates, and CNN, concerned that the Internet was still in its infancy, and that limitations could cripple the technology before it ever had a chance to reach its full potential. In 2001, O&#x27;Reilly was involved in a dispute with Amazon.com, against Amazon&#x27;s one-click patent and, specifically, Amazon&#x27;s assertion of that patent against rival Barnes &amp; Noble. The protest ended with O&#x27;Reilly and Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos visiting Washington D.C. to lobby for patent reform.

===Open source software===
In 1998, O&#x27;Reilly helped rebrand free software under the term open source. O&#x27;Reilly sees the role of open source as being inseparable from the development of the Internet, pointing to the widely used TCP/IP protocol, sendmail, Apache, Perl, Linux and other open source platforms. He is concerned about trends towards new forms of lock-in.

===Web 2.0===
In 2003, after the dot com bust, O&#x27;Reilly Media&#x27;s corporate goal was to reignite enthusiasm in the computer industry. Dale Dougherty, an executive at O&#x27;Reilly, invoked the phrase &quot;Web 2.0&quot; during a brainstorming session. Though O&#x27;Reilly is often credited with popularizing the phrase Web 2.0, it originated with Darcy DiNucci, who coined the term in 1999. O&#x27;Reilly went on to popularize the phrase as a handle for the resurgence of the web after the dotcom crash of 2000, and as a generic term for the &quot;harnessing of collective intelligence&quot; viewed as the hallmark of this resurgence. O&#x27;Reilly first called an &quot;executive conference&quot; in 2004, inviting five hundred technology and business leaders, followed by a public version of the event in 2005. Annual iterations of the event, known as the &quot;Web 2.0 Summit&quot; from 2006 onwards, continued until 2011.

O&#x27;Reilly and employees of O&#x27;Reilly Media have applied the &quot;2.0&quot; concept to conferences in publishing and government, amongst other things. O&#x27;Reilly envisions the Internet Operating System as consisting of various sub systems, such as media, payment, speech recognition, location, and identity. He uses the analogy of the biome of the human body having more bacterial than human cells (a ratio lately estimated at 1.3:1), but depending upon millions of other organisms each pursuing their own interest but nevertheless weaving a co-operative web.

===Government as platform===
O&#x27;Reilly has been propagating the notion of &quot;government as platform&quot;, or &quot;Gov 2.0&quot;. He is considered the most enthusiastic promoter of algorithmic regulation, the ongoing monitoring and modification of government policies via open data feedback.

=== Inner source ===
In 2001, O&#x27;Reilly coined the term inner source for the use of open source software development practices and the establishment of an open source-like culture within organisations whereby the organisation may still develop proprietary software but internally opens up its development.

=== Algorithmic attention rents ===
Originally proposed by Tim O’Reilly, and developed further in collaboration with Ilan Strauss and Mariana Mazzucato, “algorithmic attention rents” entails the use of a platform’s algorithms to allocate user attention to content which is more profitable or beneficial to the platform, at the expense of its ecosystem of users and third-party firms, content creators, website developers, etc. Algorithms are used to degrade the quality of information shown to the user, as paid for and addictive content is promoted ahead of “organic” content which best meets users needs.

A detailed case study has been undertaken with respect to Amazon and its ability to degrade search results quality through the inclusion of (duplicated) paid advertising results in its product search results for its third-party marketplace. The theoretical (legal-economic) underpinnings of this is discussed in a companion paper.

<text>Diana Louise DeGette ( ; born July 29, 1957) is an American lawyer and politician serving as the U.S. representative for since 1997. A member of the Democratic Party, her district is based in Denver. DeGette was a Chief Deputy Whip from 2005 to 2019 and is the dean of Colorado&#x27;s congressional delegation; she served as the Colorado State Representative for the 6th district from 1993 until her election to the U.S. House.

== Early life, education and career ==
A fourth-generation Coloradan, DeGette was born in Tachikawa, Japan, the daughter of Patricia Anne (&quot;née&quot; Rose) and Richard Louis DeGette. Her parents were American, and at the time of her birth her father was serving in the armed forces. She graduated from Colorado College, where she earned a B.A. in political science and was elected to the Pi Gamma Mu international honor society in 1979. She earned a Juris Doctor degree from New York University School of Law in 1982. She then returned to Denver and began a law practice focusing on civil rights and employment litigation.

== Colorado Legislature ==
Long active in Denver politics, DeGette was elected to the Colorado House of Representatives in 1992. She was reelected in 1994 and chosen as assistant minority leader. She authored a law that guarantees Colorado women unobstructed access to abortion clinics and other medical care facilities, also known as the Bubble Bill. The United States Supreme Court found the Bubble Bill constitutional in &quot;Hill v. Colorado&quot;, 530 U.S. 703 (2000). DeGette also authored the state Voluntary Cleanup and Redevelopment Act, a model for similar cleanup programs.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

=== Elections ===

==== 1996 ====
Longtime 1st district Representative Pat Schroeder chose not to run for a 13th term in 1996, prompting DeGette to run. Her principal opponent in the primary election was former City Council member Tim Sandos, whom Denver Mayor Wellington Webb endorsed shortly before the primary. DeGette won the primary with 55% of the vote, all but assuring her of election in the heavily Democratic district (the 1st has been in Democratic hands for all but four years since 1933). Schroeder, who stayed neutral during the primary, endorsed DeGette once DeGette became the nominee. DeGette won with 57% of the vote and has been reelected 15 times since.

=== Tenure ===
DeGette serves as the co-chair of both the Congressional Diabetes Caucus and Pro-Choice Caucus, and she is Vice Chair of the LGBT Equality Caucus. With the Democrats&#x27; victory in the 2006 midterm elections, DeGette briefly considered running for House Majority Whip, but bowed out in favor of Jim Clyburn of South Carolina.

DeGette sat as speaker pro tempore and presided over the debate on December 18, 2019, the day United States House of Representatives voted on the first impeachment of President Donald Trump.

DeGette received national attention in 2005, when the House of Representatives passed legislation she cosponsored to lift President George W. Bush&#x27;s limits on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research. DeGette, who had been working on the measure since 2001, enlisted the support of Representative Michael N. Castle (Republican from Delaware), who became DeGette&#x27;s principal Republican cosponsor of the legislation. The DeGette-Castle bill passed the Senate on July 18, 2006. President Bush vetoed the bill the next day — his first veto.

In 2007, DeGette served as the House Democrats&#x27; designated whip on the bill reauthorizing the State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (HR 3162). Although President Bush announced his opposition to the legislation, the House passed the bill on August 1, 2007, by a vote of 225 to 204. The Senate adopted a different version of the legislation the next day.

DeGette was also a cosponsor for the Udall Amendment to the House Energy Bill, which the House approved by a vote of 220 to 190 on August 4, 2007. The Amendment creates a national Renewable Energy Standard that requires electric suppliers to produce 15 percent of their energy from renewable sources, 4 percent of which can come from efficiency, by the year 2020.

On September 12, 2007, DeGette announced that she would introduce the Colorado Wilderness Act of 2007 in Congress. The bill was unsuccessful and did not pass the committee level. She reintroduced the bill in 2009.

DeGette is a cosponsor of legislation to provide the District of Columbia voting representation.
On January 24, 2007, Speaker Nancy Pelosi appointed Representative DeGette to the House Page Board.

On November 26, 2007, DeGette announced her endorsement of Senator Hillary Clinton for president and was named national co-chair of Clinton&#x27;s Health Care Policy Task Force and adviser on stem-cell research. DeGette was a superdelegate to the Democratic National Convention in Denver in August 2008.

DeGette was strongly critical of the Stupak-Pitts Amendment, which places limits on taxpayer-funded abortions (except in the case of rape, incest, or life of the mother) in the context of the November 2009 Affordable Health Care for America Act.

On January 12, 2021, DeGette was named an impeachment manager (prosecutor) for the second impeachment trial of President Trump.

== Political positions ==
DeGette voted with President Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 100% of the time in the 117th Congress, according to a &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; analysis.

=== Abortion ===

DeGette is pro-choice and the co-chair of the Pro-Choice Caucus. DeGette and her former fellow co-chair, Louise Slaughter, are the sponsors of the Prevention First Act. This act aims to decrease the number of unintended pregnancies, abortions and sexually transmitted diseases through better women&#x27;s healthcare. The NARAL Pro-Choice America PAC endorsed DeGette and gave her a 100% approval rating based on her positions. DeGette also received a 100% rating from Planned Parenthood. The National Right to Life Committee gave her a 0% rating due to her strong pro-choice stance.

=== Embryonic stem cell research ===
DeGette has consistently voted in favor of the use of embryonic stem cell research. DeGette says &quot;we must pass common-sense embryonic stem cell research legislation, placing these regulations into statute and once and for all, ensuring this critical life-saving research can be conducted for years to come, unimpeded by political whims or naysayers.&quot; DeGette and Charlie Dent introduced the bipartisan Stem Cell Research Act of 2011, which would provide lasting support for stem cell research.

=== Gun control ===
DeGette supports bans on semi-automatic firearms like those used in the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting, which happened in a movie theater near her district. DeGette has stated that &quot;the sole purpose of these guns and these magazines is to kill people.&quot; DeGette and Carolyn McCarthy introduced the Stop Online Ammunition Sales Act of 2012. The Brady Campaign endorsed DeGette&#x27;s reelection in 2008, 2010, and 2012.

In 2013, DeGette drew national attention after making an erroneous statement at a public forum about firearm magazine restrictions. She stated, &quot;[t]hese are ammunition, they&#x27;re bullets, so the people who have those now, they&#x27;re going to shoot them, so if you ban them in the future, the number of these high-capacity magazines is going to decrease dramatically over time because the bullets will have been shot and there won&#x27;t be any more available.&quot; (Id.) The comment, failing to take into account the fact that these magazines are designed to be reloaded, fueled long-running complaints by gun-rights groups that lawmakers trying to regulate firearms do not understand the issue. (Id.)

In June 2016, DeGette and other Democratic lawmakers, led by John Lewis (D-GA) took part in a sit-in on the floor of the House of Representatives to protest the Republican leadership&#x27;s decision to not put several proposed gun control bills up for a vote.

=== Israel ===
DeGette voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.

== Personal life ==
DeGette is married to Colorado Court of Appeals Judge Lino Lipinsky. They live in Denver and have two daughters together. DeGette sings in her church choir.

<text>Peder Severin Krøyer (; 23 July 1851 – 21 November 1909), also known as P. S. Krøyer, was a Danish painter.

==Life==
===Growing up and early training===
Krøyer was born in Stavanger, Norway, on 23 July 1851 to a single mother, Ellen Cecilie Gjesdal. He was raised by Gjesdal&#x27;s sister, Bertha Cecilie (born 1817) and brother-in-law, the Danish zoologist Henrik Nikolai Krøyer, after his mother was judged unfit to care for him. Krøyer moved to Copenhagen to live with his foster parents soon afterward. Having begun his art education at the age of nine under private tutelage, he was enrolled in Copenhagen&#x27;s Technical Institute the following year.
In 1870, at the age of 19, Krøyer completed his studies at the Royal Danish Academy of Art (&quot;&quot;), where he had studied with Frederik Vermehren. In 1873 he was awarded the gold medal, as well as a scholarship.

===Early career===

His official debut as a painter was in 1871 at Charlottenborg with a portrait of a friend, the painter . He exhibited regularly at Charlottenborg throughout his life.

In 1874 Heinrich Hirschsprung bought his first painting from Krøyer, establishing a long-standing patronage. Hirschsprung&#x27;s collection of art forms the basis of the Hirschsprung Museum in Copenhagen.

===Travels===
Between 1877 and 1881, Krøyer travelled extensively in Europe, meeting artists, studying art, and developing his skills and outlook. He stayed in Paris and studied under Léon Bonnat, and undoubtedly came under the influence of contemporary impressionists – Claude Monet, Alfred Sisley, Edgar Degas, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Édouard Manet.

He continued to travel throughout his life, constantly drawing inspiration from foreign artists and cultures. Hirschsprung provided financial support during the early travels, and Krøyer continued exhibiting in Denmark throughout this period.

===Krøyer comes to Skagen===
In 1882 he returned to Denmark. He spent June–October at Skagen, then a remote fishing village on the northern tip of Denmark, painting themes from local life, as well as depictions of the artistic community there. He would continue to be associated with the developing art and literary scene at Skagen. Other artists at Skagen included writers Holger Drachmann, Georg Brandes and Henrik Pontoppidan, and artists Michael Ancher and Anna Ancher.

Krøyer divided his time between rented houses in Skagen during the summer, a winter apartment in Copenhagen where he worked on his large commissioned portraits, and travel outside of the country.

===Krøyer and Marie===

On a trip to Paris in 1888 he encountered Marie Martha Mathilde Triepcke, whom he had known in Copenhagen. They fell in love and, after a whirlwind romance, married on 23 July 1889 at her parents&#x27; home in Germany. Marie Krøyer, who was also a painter, became associated with the Skagen community, and after their marriage was often featured in Krøyer&#x27;s paintings. The couple had one child, a daughter named Vibeke, born in January 1895. They were divorced in 1905 following a prolonged separation.

Krøyer&#x27;s eyesight failed him gradually over the last ten years of his life until he was totally blind. Ever the optimist, he painted almost to the end, in spite of health obstacles. In fact, he painted some of his last masterpieces while half-blind, joking that the eyesight in his one working eye had become better with the loss of the other eye.

Krøyer died in 1909 in Skagen at 58 years of age after years of declining health. He had also been in and out of hospitals, suffering from bouts of mental illness.

==Works==

Krøyer&#x27;s best known and best-loved work is entitled &quot;Summer Evening on Skagen&#x27;s Southern Beach with Anna Ancher and Marie Krøyer&quot; (&quot;&quot;), 1893. He painted many beach scenes featuring both recreation life on the beach (bathers, strollers), and local fishermen.

Another popular work is &quot;Midsummer Eve Bonfire on Skagen Beach&quot; (&quot;Sankthansbål på Skagen strand&quot;), 1906. This large-scale work features a great crowd of the artistic and influential Skagen community gathered around a large bonfire on the beach on Saint John&#x27;s Eve (Midsummer Eve).

Both of these works are in the permanent collection of the Skagens Museum which is dedicated to that community of artists, including those who gathered around Krøyer, a great organizer and bon vivant.

<doc id="410124" wikidata="Q193890" url="?curid=410124" title="Drobeta-Turnu Severin">
<text>Drobeta-Turnu Severin (), colloquially Severin, is a city in Mehedinți County, Oltenia, Romania, on the northern bank of the Danube, close to the Iron Gates. It is one of six Romanian county seats lying on the Danube river. &quot;Drobeta&quot; is the name of the ancient Dacian and Roman towns at the site, and the modern town of Turnu Severin received the additional name of Drobeta during Nicolae Ceaușescu&#x27;s national-communist dictatorship as part of his myth-making efforts.

==Etymology==
Drobeta was originally a Dacian town. The Roman fort built by Emperor Trajan at the site preserved the Dacian name. (see &quot;History&quot; section). According to Hamp and Hyllested, Drobeta reflects a Roman misinterpretation of *Druwā-tā (the wooden place) with a postposed article, reflecting a proto-Albanian syntax for wood .

&quot;Severin&quot; was originally linked by historians with the Roman Emperor Septimius Severus, during whose reign the name of the city was Drobeta Septimia Severiana. However, the name may be derived from Old Church Slavonic &quot;severno&quot; (&quot;northern&quot;), from &quot;&quot;, &quot;north&quot;. Another possibility is that Severin&#x27;s name was taken in memory of Severinus of Noricum, who was the patron saint of the medieval colony Turnu, initially a suffragane of the Diocese of Kalocsa.

&quot;Turnu&quot; (&quot;Tower&quot;) refers to a tower on the north bank of the Danube built by the Byzantines. Thus, the name of the city would mean &quot;Northern Tower&quot;.

==History==

===Dacian and Roman Eras===
Drobeta was first a Dacian town mentioned by Greek geographer Ptolemy of Alexandria (2nd century AD).

Trajan&#x27;s bridge was built here to cross the Danube in only three years (AD 103–105) by his favourite architect Apollodorus of Damascus for his invasion of Dacia which ended with Roman victory in 106 AD. The bridge was considered one of the most daring works in the Roman world. The bridge was composed of twenty arches between stone piers, two of which are visible. Each bridgehead had its own fort and portal monument, whose remains can still be seen on both sides of the Danube.

Drobeta grew as a strategic point at the crossing of water and land routes which led to the north and south of the Danube. It became the third urban centre in Dacia after Sarmizegetusa and Apullum. During the reign of Emperor Hadrian (AD 117–138), the settlement was declared a &quot;municipium&quot; in 121. At this point the population had reached 14,000. In 193 during the reign of Septimius Severus (193–211), the city was raised to the rank of a colony which gave its residents equal rights with citizens of Rome. As a colony, Drobeta was a thriving city with temples, a basilica, a theatre, a forum, a port and guilds of craftsmen. In the middle of the 3rd century, Drobeta covered an area of 60 hectares and had a population of almost 40,000 inhabitants.

After the retreat of the Roman administration from Dacia in the 4th century, the city was preserved under Roman occupation as a bridgehead on the north bank of the Danube until the 6th century. Destroyed by Huns in the 5th century, it was rebuilt by Justinian I (527-565).

====Sights====
On the bank of the Danube are the remains of the celebrated Trajan&#x27;s Bridge, the longest in the Empire. Here the Danube is about wide.

The bridgehead fort has been extensively excavated and is visible today. 

Also visible are the extensive remains of the large Roman thermal baths and amphitheatre.
===Middle Ages===
The fortress of Severin was built by the Kingdom of Hungary under Ladislaus I (1077–1095) as a strategical point against the Second Bulgarian Empire. Along with the forming of the Vallachian Voivodeships (Voievodatele Valahe), the Severin fortress was a reason for a war over a period of several generations between Oltenian Voievodes (Litovoi, Bărbat, then Basarab I) and Hungarians. The war ended with the Battle of Posada. Romanians then fought the Ottoman Empire, which threatened the area of the Danube. In this context, castles on the banks of the river, the area from Iron Gates to Calafat, began to be restored.

When the Hungarians attacked Oltenia and conquered Severin&#x27;s fortress, Andrew II of Hungary organized the Banate of Severin. The first Ban of Severin, Luca, was mentioned in 1233. This year may be taken as the date of birth of a new castle over the ruins of Drobeta, under the name Severin (Severinopolis). It was a basis for the Banate of Severin, Terra Zeurino (&quot;Țara Severinului&quot; – Country of Severin). Severin&#x27;s name was taken in memory of Severinus of Noricum, who was the patron saint of the medieval colony Turnu, initially a suffragane of the Diocese of Kalocsa.

In 1247, the Hungarian Kingdom brought the Knights of St. John to the country, giving them Severin as a residence, where they built the medieval castle of Severin (this is the &quot;Castrul Zeurini&quot; mentioned in Diploma of the Joannites in 1247). Inside the strong fort a Gothic church was erected. This was presumably the headquarters of the Catholic episcopate of Severin that was there until 1502. The knights withdrew in 1259, while the fortress remained in the range of the cannons of Turks, Bulgarians and Tatars who wanted to cross the Danube. The Hungarians still wanted to attack Oltenia.

Severin Fortress was the most important strategic redoubt on the Danube. Its conquest meant to gain an important bridgehead in the region.

Romanian Voivodes have also fought for this powerful fortress, conquering it or claiming it from time to time. Litovoi and Basarab I died at this fortress. Mircea the Elder (Mircea cel Bătrân) established Bănia Severinului (Banate of Severin) and, in 1406, concluded a treaty of alliance with Sigismund of Hungary right in Severin. After the death of Mircea, Sigismund freed the Severin Fortress occupied by the Turks, and even made some concessions to the monasteries of Vodița and Tismana. Then Banate of Severin returned to John Hunyadi, who consolidated all the castles on the Danube. Around 1432, possession passed to the Wallachian voivodes.

After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, attacks on the Danubian fortresses were made, moving the Banate residence to Strehaia, the Severin population migrating to the Cerneți village, 6 km north, which became the capital of the Mehedinți district. In 1524, after a devastating attack by the Turks led by Suleiman the Magnificent, only one tower of the Severin fortress was left standing, which led the people to name it &quot;Turnul lui Severin&quot; (Tower of Severinus). Severin remained under Ottoman rule until 1829 except a Wallachian occupation between 1594 and 1599 and an Austrian one between 1718 and 1738. Under Ottoman occupation, the territory&#x27;s administration moved to the west of Oltenia and was centered in Cerneţi.

In 1936, Prof. Dr. Al. Bărăcilă executed excavations at the fortress, where he managed to reconstruct the layout of the castle and recovered rich archaeological materials (rails, iron, copper, stone cannonballs, pipe of a bronze cannon etc.). The fortress was rectangular shaped with two walls made of unprocessed river stones, glued with mortar. In the center of the castle there was a chapel, surrounded by graves, built in part with materials taken from Drobeta Castrum. Also in the fortress was an oven-hearth serving a weapons workshop. Inside the interior, to the north, was a tower with three floors used for defense; to the east a second tower, thicker, at the angle of the wall. The entrance to the castle was through a gate dome and the fortress was surrounded by a deep moat.

===Modern times===


After gaining freedom from Ottoman control as a consequence of the Treaty of Adrianople in 1829, it was decided to rebuild the present city. A rigorous program started in 1836. It was followed, in 1858, by the construction of the harbor. By 1900 the national road, rail, the Carol and Elisabeta boulevards, Navigația Fluvială Românească (River Navigation of Romania), the railway workshops, the shipyard (which in 1914 was the largest in the country), the Roman Hall, the Municipal Palace, three churches and two hospitals were built. In 1883, on May 15, Theodor Costescu established Traian High School, which in the next century would become a modern school of national prestige. The building of industrial factories spurred the development of the city. In 1841, Severin became the capital of the county and in 1851 became a city. As a major port on the Danube, the freedom of trade facilitated the entry of goods by boat from Vienna and the exchange of material necessary for economic development. Severin experienced a steady economic, urban and social growth until 1972, when it received the name of &quot;Drobeta-Turnu Severin&quot;.

In 1914, the Water Castle (&quot;Castelul de Apă&quot;) was opened. Considered an emblematic monument to the people of Severin, it gives identity to the city by being built in one of the major traffic roundabouts of the city.

The central neighborhoods were spared from the countrywide campaign of demolitions unleashed by the Ceauşescu regime, allowing the historic architecture of the city to survive. In 1968, Turnu Severin became the capital of the county, concurrently becoming a city (&quot;municipiu&quot;). In 1972, the name of the ancient Drobeta was added to the city&#x27;s name, and it became Drobeta-Turnu Severin.

==Population (1859–2021)==
==Climate==
The region&#x27;s climate gives Severin warm summers and mild winters, meaning the city is home to magnolia trees, Caucasian nut trees, and ginkgo biloba as well as the almond trees, figs, lilacs, lindens, and chestnut trees more common throughout Europe.

<text>Karl Barry Sharpless (born April 28, 1941) is an American stereochemist. He is a two-time Nobel laureate in Chemistry known for his work on stereoselective reactions and click chemistry.

Sharpless was awarded half of the 2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry &quot;for his work on chirally catalysed oxidation reactions&quot;, and one third of the 2022 prize, jointly with Carolyn R. Bertozzi and Morten P. Meldal, &quot;for the development of click chemistry and bioorthogonal chemistry&quot;. Sharpless is the fifth person (in addition to two organizations) to have twice been awarded a Nobel prize, along with Marie Curie, John Bardeen, Linus Pauling and Frederick Sanger, and the third to have been awarded two prizes in the same discipline (after Bardeen and Sanger).

== Early life and education ==
Sharpless was born April 28, 1941, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His childhood was filled with summers at his family cottage on the Manasquan River in New Jersey. This is where Sharpless developed a love for fishing that he would continue throughout his life, spending summers in college working on fishing boats. He graduated from Friends&#x27; Central School in 1959, and continued his studies at Dartmouth College, earning an A.B. degree in 1963. Sharpless originally planned to attend medical school after his undergraduate degree, but his research professor convinced him to continue his education in chemistry. He earned his Ph.D. in Organic Chemistry from Stanford University in 1968 under Eugene van Tamelen. He continued post-doctoral work at Stanford University (1968–1969) with James P. Collman, working on organometallic chemistry. Sharpless then moved to Harvard University (1969–1970), studying enzymology in Konrad E. Bloch&#x27;s lab.

== Academic career ==
Sharpless was a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1970–1977, 1980–1990) and Stanford University (1977–1980). While at Stanford, Sharpless discovered Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation, which was used to make (+)-disparlure. , Sharpless led a laboratory at Scripps Research. 

== Research ==
Sharpless developed stereoselective oxidation reactions, and showed that the formation of an inhibitor with femtomolar potency can be catalyzed by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, beginning with an azide and an alkyne. He discovered several chemical reactions which have transformed asymmetric synthesis from science fiction to the relatively routine, including aminohydroxylation, dihydroxylation, and the Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation.

In 2001 he was awarded a half-share of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on chirally catalyzed oxidation reactions (Sharpless epoxidation, Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation, Sharpless oxyamination). The other half of the year&#x27;s Prize was shared between William S. Knowles and Ryōji Noyori (for their work on stereoselective hydrogenation).
The term &quot;click chemistry&quot; was coined by Sharpless around the year 2000, and was first fully described by Sharpless, Hartmuth Kolb, and M.G. Finn at The Scripps Research Institute in 2001. This involves a set of highly selective, exothermic reactions which occur under mild conditions; the most successful example is the azide alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition to form 1,2,3-triazoles.

, Sharpless has an h-index of 130 according to Scopus.

== Awards and honors ==
Sharpless is a two-time Nobel Laureate. He is a recipient of the 2001 and 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on &quot;chirally catalysed oxidation reactions&quot;, and &quot;click chemistry&quot;, respectively.

He was awarded the 2001 Wolf Prize in Chemistry together with Henri B. Kagan and Ryoji Noyori “for their pioneering, creative and crucial work in developing asymmetric catalysis for the synthesis of chiral molecules, greatly increasing humankind´s ability to create new products of fundamental and practical importance”.

In 2019, Sharpless was awarded the Priestley medal, the American Chemical Society&#x27;s highest honor, for &quot;the invention of catalytic, asymmetric oxidation methods, the concept of click chemistry and development of the copper-catalyzed version of the azide-acetylene cycloaddition reaction.&quot;. He received the Gold Medal of the American Institute of Chemists in 2023.

He is Distinguished University Professor at Kyushu University. He holds honorary degrees from the KTH Royal Institute of Technology (1995), Technical University of Munich (1995), Catholic University of Louvain (1996) and Wesleyan University (1999).

== Personal life ==
Sharpless married Jan Dueser in 1965 and they have three children. He was blinded in one eye during a lab accident in 1970 where an NMR tube exploded, shortly after he arrived at MIT as an assistant professor. After this accident, Sharpless stresses &quot;there&#x27;s simply never an adequate excuse for not wearing safety glasses in the laboratory &quot;at all times&quot;.&quot;

<text>Mark Emery Udall ( ; born July 18, 1950) is an American politician who served as a United States Senator from Colorado from 2009 to 2015. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served in the United States House of Representatives, representing . Before being elected to Congress, he represented parts of Boulder, Colorado, in the Colorado House of Representatives.

Throughout his career, he has proposed legislation to support renewable energy, expand national parks, and protect natural resources. Born in Tucson, Arizona, he is the son of former U.S. Representative Mo Udall and the nephew of former U.S. Representative Stewart Udall. A member of the Udall family, a western American political family, his relatives include New Mexico&#x27;s Tom Udall and Utah&#x27;s Mike Lee. Udall ran for reelection in 2014 to a second term in the U.S. Senate, but was narrowly defeated by Republican challenger Cory Gardner.

==Early life and education==
Mark Udall was born in Tucson, Arizona, to Patricia J. (née Emery) and Morris &quot;Mo&quot; Udall, the U.S. representative for from 1961 to 1991, and candidate for the 1976 Democratic nomination for President. Udall attended and graduated from Canyon del Oro High School in 1968, where he was elected student body president. Udall won the Arizona State Golf Championship Boy&#x27;s division in 1968.

Udall later graduated from Williams College in 1972 with a Bachelor of Arts in American civilization. In 1976 Udall worked as a field coordinator for his father&#x27;s campaign to win the Democratic nomination against Jimmy Carter.

After college, Udall moved to Colorado and began his career with Outward Bound, a non-profit outdoor education organization. For ten years Udall worked as a course instructor, in which he would bring patrons on outdoor expeditions. During his career in Outdoor Adventure Education he also was an instructor at DoDDS&#x27;s Project Bold, located at the Hinterbrand Lodge in Berchtesgaden, Germany. Afterward, Udall served as Outward Bound&#x27;s Executive Director for ten years, after which Udall decided to retire, completing his twenty-year career with Outward Bound.

==Colorado House of Representatives==
In 1996, Udall was encouraged to run for the Colorado House of Representatives by Peggy Lamm of the 13th district, who had decided to retire. After running a grassroots campaign in the swing district, Udall narrowly defeated Republican Drew Bolin to represent the Longmont and Boulder district. During his two years in office, Udall served on the Judiciary and Agriculture Livestock &amp; Natural Resources Committees.

While in the Colorado House, Udall proposed legislation titled &quot;Renewable Electricity Standard.&quot; It would have required at least 10% of energy consumed in Colorado to be provided by renewable sources rather than fossil fuels. The bill died in committee. Udall chose not to run for re-election, instead decided to run for the United States Congress. He was succeeded by fellow Democrat, Tom Plant.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
After one term in the Colorado House of Representatives, Udall opted to run for Colorado&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, which was being vacated by incumbent David Skaggs. In the primary, Udall had four opponents: Gene Nichol, Paul Weissmann, and Dave Thomas. He won with 44% of the vote, defeating his closest opponent Nichol by 7 percentage points. He faced the Republican nominee, Boulder, Colorado Mayor Bob Greenlee in the general election. The race was unexpectedly close, with Udall narrowly winning, 49–47%. Udall was consecutively elected to five terms in the House, without major opposition. He was eventually succeeded by Jared Polis, after he decided to run for the Senate seat being vacated by retiring Republican Wayne Allard.

==U.S. Senate==
===Elections===
;2004

In 2004, Udall announced his candidacy for the Senate seat which was being vacated by Ben Nighthorse Campbell. However, the following day, Colorado Attorney General Ken Salazar announced his candidacy as well. Udall bowed out of the race and endorsed Salazar.
;2008
On January 15, 2007, incumbent Senator Wayne Allard announced he would not run for a third term. In April 2007, Udall announced his campaign for the Senate. Udall became the Democratic nominee for the race after running unopposed in the primary. In the general election, Udall faced former U.S. Representative Republican Bob Schaffer. By August 28, 2008, over $10 million had been spent on attack ads against Udall by political parties and political action committees, an amount higher than in any other Senate race that year.

The race was especially competitive, with Democrats wanting to expand their majority as much as possible due to that year&#x27;s presidential election. While both &quot;CQ Politics&quot; and &quot;The Rothenberg Political Report&quot; estimated Udall would win, and &quot;The Cook Political Report&quot; considered it a &#x27;Toss Up,&#x27; Udall maintained a steady lead in the polls, but with neither candidate usually topping 50%. Udall described the race as &quot;the toughest climb I&#x27;ve ever taken.&quot; On November 4, Udall won the election by 240,265 votes.

;2014
On January 7, 2013, Udall announced he was running for re-election. Udall was unopposed in the Democratic primary, and faced Republican U.S. Representative Cory Gardner in the general election. Although Udall was heavily favored in early polls, around September, Gardner gained and held a steady lead thereafter.

Udall&#x27;s re-election campaign focused on reproductive and women&#x27;s rights. Throughout, Udall attacked Gardner for his former support of a fetal personhood initiative, and claimed in ads that Gardner &quot;championed an eight-year crusade to outlaw birth control here in Colorado.&quot; PolitiFact.com rated his claim &quot;half-true,&quot; saying that it &quot;leaves out important details.&quot; On MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;The Last Word&quot;, Alex Wagner attributed Udall&#x27;s trailing poll numbers to his &quot;focus on reproductive rights.&quot; Due to his campaign&#x27;s emphasis on these issues, Udall was ridiculed as &quot;Mark Uterus.&quot; In an October 2014 &quot;Denver Post&quot; endorsement of his opponent, the editorial board stated that &quot;Udall&#x27;s campaign has devoted a shocking amount of energy and money trying to convince voters that Gardner seeks to outlaw birth control despite the congressman&#x27;s call for over-the-counter sales of contraceptives. Udall is trying to frighten voters rather than inspire them with a hopeful vision.&quot;

Towards the end of his campaign, Udall was accompanied by Second Lady of the United States Jill Biden, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. In July 2014, President Barack Obama headlined a fundraiser for Udall&#x27;s campaign.

===Senate tenure===
Less than one month after Udall took office in the Senate, newly elected President Obama nominated senior Colorado Senator Ken Salazar to serve as his Secretary of the Interior. After his confirmation, Udall became the Senate&#x27;s most junior senior Senator.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Armed Services
** Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities 
** Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support
** Subcommittee on Strategic Forces (chairman)
* Committee on Energy and Natural Resources
** Subcommittee on Energy
** Subcommittee on National Parks (chairman)
** Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests
* Select Committee on Intelligence

==Political positions==
===Abortion===
NRLC- National Right to Life Committee  gives Udall a 0% rating for abortion rights, while his opponent in 2014, Cory Gardner, earned a 100% rating.

===Agriculture===
In February 2014, Udall voted for the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013, a $1 trillion bill that ended direct payments to farmers but expanded crop insurance by $7 billion over the next decade, created new subsidies for rice and peanut growers that will kick in if or when prices drop, and cut food stamp subsidies for 1.7 million people in 15 states.

In 2011, Maine Senator Susan Collins and Udall successfully introduced an amendment to the Senate&#x27;s agriculture appropriations bill. The amendment to the appropriations bill removed a limit placed on potatoes in the USDA new school nutrition guidelines.

===Campaign finance reform===
Udall is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One, a bipartisan organization dedicated to reducing the influence of money in politics.

===Cannabis===

Although Senator to the first state to legalize the recreational sale of marijuana, Udall took no official stance on Colorado Amendment 64 during its campaign. After Amendment 64 and Washington state&#x27;s similar initiative passed in 2012, Udall and the Senate delegations from Washington addressed a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder and White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, imploring them to &quot;let this experiment unfold,&quot; as Udall characterized it.

===Domestic security===
Udall has been an opponent of the National Security Agency&#x27;s (NSA) mass surveillance programs. Following the revelation of the NSA&#x27;s mass surveillance of Americans, Udall has been an advocate for reform. Udall, along with Senators Ron Wyden and Rand Paul, published an Op-ed in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; expressing their collective desire to &quot;end the dragnet — and to affirm that we can keep our nation secure without trampling on and abandoning Americans&#x27; constitutional rights.&quot; Udall expressed his support for Edward Snowden to return to America to &quot;make his case.&quot; After reports that the Central Intelligence Agency improperly spied on U.S. Senators, Udall called for the resignation of Agency Director John O. Brennan.

After the September 11 attacks, the one-term Representative Udall was one of 66 House members to vote against the Patriot Act. In 2011, Udall voted against reauthorizing the Patriot Act. In July 2014, Udall voted against the CISPA bill, a proposed law which would allow for the sharing of Internet traffic information between the U.S. government and technology and manufacturing companies, voicing his concerns that it &quot;lacks adequate protections for the privacy rights.&quot;

During the 2011 debate over the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (NDAA), Udall introduced an amendment to end the practice of military detention of American citizens indefinitely and without trial. In response to the amendment&#x27;s introduction, the Obama administration threatened to veto the bill. The amendment was rejected by a vote of 60–38 (with 2 abstaining). Udall subsequently voted for the Act in the joint session of Congress that passed it, and though he remained &quot;extremely troubled&quot; by the detainee provisions, he promised to &quot;push Congress to conduct the maximum amount of oversight possible&quot;.

Udall has supported PRISM, a clandestine anti-terrorism mass electronic surveillance data mining program launched in 2007 by the National Security Agency (NSA); however, he has also expressed support for introduction of measures to reform and limit the scope of the Patriot Act; &#x27;The Patriot Act should be reformed so Americans&#x27; phone records do not get indiscriminately swept up in a federal government database.&#x27;

===Economy===
Udall voted for the Employee Free Choice Act in 2007, which would have eliminated secret ballot in voting to unionize businesses, and said that he supported the measure because the National Labor Relations Board would be the best forum to deal with concerns raised by the bill&#x27;s opponents.

On February 10, 2009, Udall voted to pass the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (commonly referred to as The Stimulus or The Recovery Act). Udall was part of a bipartisan group of 20 senators who negotiated an agreement to set the stimulus bill size to around $600 billion and include $70 billion for the Alternative Minimum Tax.

In December 2010, Udall was one of seven Democrats to vote against a deal to extend the Bush tax cuts for two years as well as fund unemployment benefits for an additional 13 months, having stated, &quot;Days after the most substantive national conversation we&#x27;ve had about addressing the debt, the debate suddenly has turned to extending tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires that — alone — will cost $700 billion over the next decade.&quot;

===Energy and environment===
Udall has supported tax breaks for renewable energy and the expansion of national parks. Udall has a lifetime rating of 97% from the League of Conservation Voters.

In 2004, Udall helped lead a statewide ballot initiative (Amendment 37) to adopt the Renewable Electricity Standard, a standard he originally introduced in the Colorado House of Representatives. Working with the Republican Colorado House Speaker, the measure mandating 10% of energy consumed be from renewable sources, passed by a close margin 52% to 48%.

Throughout his career Udall has introduced the &quot;Ski Area Recreational Opportunity Enhancement Act,&quot; which was passed in 2011. The act allows ski resorts to offer activities in the summer. In 2009, Udall introduced legislation to address the environmental damage caused by the pine beetle infestation in Colorado&#x27;s forests, in what Udall described as one of the &quot;biggest natural disasters.&quot;

In July 2014, Udall came out in opposition of two Colorado ballot initiative that would have limited hydraulic fracturing, or &quot;fracking&quot;, and created an &quot;Environmental Bill of Rights.&quot; While his opposition to the initiative aligned him Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, it put him at odds with the main proponent of the bills and his House district successor, Jared Polis. Udall has repeatedly voted against the Keystone XL pipeline, having said that he wants to wait until a technical review of the project by the State Department is complete.

===Gun policy===
One week after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Colorado Senators Udall and Michael Bennet came out in support of a Federal Assault Weapons Ban. On the issue, Udall commented &quot;if we can save one child in the future from being killed in such a way, I&#x27;m ready to push those kinds of policies.&quot; On April 17, 2013, Udall supported a failed amendment to expand background checks for gun purchases.

In 2009, Udall upset gun control advocates for supporting an amendment that would have allowed concealed weapons to be transported across state lines. The National Rifle Association of America gave an &quot;F&quot; grade during his time in the House of Representatives. While during his tenure in the Senate, they have given him a &quot;C&quot;.

In 2023, Udall said if “in a time machine and going back” he would bring a grim message to himself: “This is going to get worse and worse. More and more people are going to be deeply affected by this.” He would vote for the ban and “take the political heat.”

===Health policy===
In December 2009, Udall voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Udall has also stated his support for a public option about which he stated, &quot;[t]he reason I support a public option, if it&#x27;s done in a fiscally responsible way, is it would create competition. Competition drives down cost and what we want to do is make insurance affordable for all Americans.&quot;

In November 2013, Udall was critical of the Colorado Division of Insurance concerning the Division&#x27;s estimates of the number of Colorado residents whose medical insurance was cancelled in response to the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. Udall&#x27;s office wanted the Division to lower the number from 250,000 because it believed the majority of individuals counted had received renewal options. The Division refused to change the numbers. Administrators at the Colorado Division of Insurance said they felt pressured by members of Udall&#x27;s staff to change their estimates of policy cancellations. A panel which investigated the matter concluded Udall&#x27;s office behaved appropriately, however the investigation was criticized because the chair was appointed by Democratic governor John Hickenlooper; all other members of the panel were selected by the chair, who refused to name the other members of the panel, and left no written records of its investigation.

==Personal life==
Udall is married to Maggie Fox, an environmental lawyer who previously served as CEO of The Climate Reality Project. The two met while working at Outward Bound, and were married in 1982. They have two children, Jedediah and Tess. A golfer, Udall was ranked the 11th best golfer in Congress by &quot;Golf Digest&quot; in 2011.

Udall has said &quot;there isn&#x27;t a Coloradan out there who doesn&#x27;t cycle, hunt, hike... We&#x27;re an outdoor state. It fits our worldview, and it&#x27;s how we define ourselves.&quot; An experienced mountaineer, Udall has climbed many peaks during his work as an Outward Bound instructor, and in his personal life. Udall has climbed Colorado&#x27;s 100 tallest peaks, known as &quot;The Colorado Centennials,&quot; as well as Kangchenjunga in the Himalayas and Aconcagua, the highest peak in South America. He has also attempted Mount Everest multiple times.

In 1986, Udall and his wife went on a group trek of Mount Garmo. During the climb, Maggie broke her leg, and their fellow climber, Steve Monfredo, died on the mountainside. Udall&#x27;s 61-year-old brother, Randy Udall, went missing on June 26, 2013, after going on a solo hike in Wyoming&#x27;s Wind River Range. On July 3, 2013, a body, later identified as that of Randy Udall, was found approximately 80 miles southeast of Grand Teton National Park.

<text>Nicholas Joseph Rahall II ( ; born May 20, 1949) is an American politician and member of the Democratic Party who served in the United States House of Representatives from 1977 to 2015. He is the longest-serving member ever of the United States House of Representatives from the state of West Virginia.

He began his political service in the early 1970s working in the cloak room of the U.S. Senate, as a staff member in the Senate Office of the Majority Whip from 1971–1974, and as a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions in 1972 and 1976. He was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1976 to represent the now-defunct 4th congressional district. He became the representative for the 3rd congressional district when reapportionment was completed following the 1990 census. He was re-elected for nineteen terms, serving from January 3, 1977 to January 3, 2015.

His district included the southern, coal-dominated portion of the state, including Huntington, Bluefield, and Beckley. Rahall was the Ranking Member of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.

Rahall lost re-election in 2014 to Evan Jenkins. , he is the last Democrat to have represented West Virginia in the U.S. House of Representatives.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Rahall was born in Beckley, West Virginia, the son of Mary Alice and Nicholas Joseph Rahall. He is a Presbyterian of Lebanese Protestant descent, whose grandparents immigrated from Lebanon.

His family owned radio station WWNR, which his father started with his uncles Farris, Sam, and Deem, and expanded to own other radio stations in a number of states.

Rahall graduated in 1971 from Duke University. He attended graduate school at the George Washington University, but did not graduate. He then worked as a sales rep for his family&#x27;s radio station, WWNR. He served as president of the Mountaineer Tour and Travel Agency in 1974, and was president of West Virginia Broadcasting.

He went to work as staff assistant for the late U.S. Senator Robert Byrd who he identifies as a mentor.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
;1970s–90s

Rahall was elected to Congress in 1976 in the 4th district, succeeding Ken Hechler who ran for governor. Rahall won the district primary with a plurality of 38%. Hechler lost the primary for governor, and attempted a write-in campaign for the congressional seat. Rahall won the general election with 46% of the vote, while Hechler got 37%.

In 1978, Hechler challenged Rahall in the Democratic primary, and Rahall won with 56% of the vote. He was re-elected 17 times. Hechler later became the West Virginia Secretary of State, and ran against Rahall in the primary in 1990. Rahall defeated him, receiving 57% of the vote.

In 1990, Rahall defeated Republican insurance agent Marianne Brewster with just 52% of the vote, the second-lowest winning percentage of his career. The district was redrawn after the 1990 census, becoming the 3rd district, due to changes to the state&#x27;s population.

;2010
In 2010, he defeated Republican former State Supreme Court Justice Spike Maynard with 56% of the vote, his lowest percentage since 1990.

;2012

In the 2012 election, Rahall defeated Republican Rick Snuffer with 53.5% of the vote. His eight-point margin of victory was his narrowest since 1990.

;2014
In 2014, Rahall faced a primary challenge from fellow Democrat and retired Army officer Richard Ojeda. Rahall won the primary with 66.4% of the vote.

He faced Republican State Senator Evan Jenkins in the November general election. Jenkins had served in the state legislature for 20 years as a Democrat, but had switched parties. Jenkins and Rahall had contributed to each other&#x27;s campaigns in the decade&#x27;s previous election cycles.

Rahall was considered one of the most &quot;endangered&quot; House Democrats by the House Democratic campaign committee. He received an endorsement from the NRA.

As of September 18, 2014, the race was rated a &quot;toss up&quot; by both University of Virginia political professor Larry Sabato, of Sabato&#x27;s Crystal Ball, and Stu Rothenberg of the Rothenberg Political Report. As of October 2, managing editor Kyle Kondik of Sabato&#x27;s Crystal Ball said the race was still a toss-up, calling it &quot;Super close, super expensive and super nasty.&quot; The Rahall campaign outspent the Jenkins campaign in the election by a two-to-one ratio.

Ultimately, Rahall was defeated, with 44.7% of the vote to Jenkins&#x27; 55.3% of the vote. In the process, he lost a number of areas that had reliably supported him for years.

Having served 19 terms in the House, the 65-year-old Rahall qualified for a Congressional pension of about $139,000 a year.

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure (Ranking Member)
**Subcommittee on Aviation
**Subcommittee on Highways and Transit
**Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials

==Political issues==

===Mining===
In 2010 Rahall introduced legislation to improve mine safety. Rahall opposed legislation designed to end mountaintop removal mining, a process often used in West Virginia.

Rahall&#x27;s policies involving mountaintop removal mining have been criticized as reflected by author and journalist Jeff Biggers in &quot;The Blog&quot; in &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, with the link between mountaintop removal mining and flooding, as well as the billions of pounds of explosives used since 2004, being given as examples.

===Environmental issues===
Rahall accepts anthropogenic climate change as real and has stated that to reject the scientific consensus regarding it is &quot;to just put your head in the sand.&quot;

Rahall called the Environmental Protection Agency &quot;callous&quot;, attacked Barack Obama&#x27;s greenhouse gas rule as &quot;disastrous&quot;, and filed legislation to block the president&#x27;s climate agenda, but in the summer of 2013 he attended a ceremony to rename the EPA headquarters and has praised EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy. Rahall, alongside three other Democrats, supported a GOP bill that would limit EPA authority on emissions, the Energy Tax Prevention Act. He commented on this, saying: &quot;I am dead set against the E.P.A.&#x27;s plowing ahead on its own with new regulations to limit greenhouse gases.&quot; He also voted against the American Clean Energy and Security Act.

In 2007, Rahall introduced the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which banned incandescent light bulbs. Despite introducing the legislation, Rahall voted against the bill on final passage. As a result of the legislation, as of January 1, 2014, incandescent light bulbs between 40 watts and 150 watts are illegal to manufacture or import.

In 2013, Rahall voted for the Progressive Caucus&#x27;s budget, which included provisions for a carbon tax. The budget failed to pass.

===Foreign policy===
Rahall and another Congressman of Arab descent traveled to Syria and ignored State Department policy by meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, whom Rahall had known for years. Queen Noor of Jordan presented Rahall with the first Najeeb Halaby Award for public service.

Rahall opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Rahall had traveled to Baghdad just before the Iraq War with the intention of convincing Iraqi leaders to allow the U.N. to inspect Iraq&#x27;s weapons and have access to every site. He said that Tariq Aziz had accepted all of Bush&#x27;s demands, and that &quot;Bush said the war was not inevitable, but we now know that wasn&#x27;t true. Iraqis did allow for complete access but Bush&#x27;s mind was already made up. Iraqis were damned if they did and damned if they didn&#x27;t ... We were falsely led into this war.&quot;

In 2004, it was reported that Rahall feared that Syria would be attacked by Bush before the November elections. He said that &quot;They&#x27;re using the same rhetoric against the Syrians they used against Iraqis... We now have the Syrian Accountability Act. All this despite the State Department&#x27;s admission that Syria helped us capture key al-Qaeda operatives and helped save American lives.&quot; As for Saudi Arabia, Rahall said that the U.S. &quot;wouldn&#x27;t dare&quot; attack that country: &quot;The Kingdom has been a key ally for decades.&quot;

===Israel===
Rahall has expressed concern about America&#x27;s relationship with Israel. He said, &quot;Israel can&#x27;t continue to occupy, humiliate and destroy the dreams and spirits of the Palestinian people and continue to call itself a democratic state.&quot;

Rahall, along with other Lebanese-American lawmakers, expressed concern with a bipartisan resolution supporting Israel in the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict without adding language urging restraint against civilian targets. He helped draft a resolution that urged &quot;all parties to protect innocent life and civilian infrastructure.&quot;

Rahall was the only member of the House to oppose the 1993 resolution urging Arab states to end their Arab boycott of Israel.

Rahall was the most senior of five Arab American lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

===Endorsement of Barack Obama===
In 2008, Rahall endorsed Barack Obama, saying Obama understood the needs and aspirations of West Virginians. He was also Chair of the Arab Americans for Obama group. Explaining his position, Rahall cited Senator Byrd, who said &quot;I work for no President. I work with Presidents.&quot; In an interview with Keith Olbermann, Rahall said that Obama had the courage and conviction to win the presidency, and that the then-senator was a true agent for change.

===Ethical issues===
In 2004, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; ran an article about Rahall and his sister, lobbyist Tanya Rahall. They reported that she made $15,000 per month as a lobbyist for Qatar, and that &quot;the person she frequently lobbies is ... her older brother and one of Qatar&#x27;s biggest champions in Washington.&quot; Rahall said &quot;our paths cross professionally, but not across any lines appropriately established by law or House rules.&quot; In May 2003, a year after his sister took on Qatar as a client, Rahall sponsored a resolution praising Qatar&#x27;s &quot;years of democratic reform&quot;; according to one academic study from 2011, &quot;For over three years, the country [Qatar] virtually had its own congressman in Washington, Nick Rahall (D-WV)&quot;.

In February 2005, Rahall used Congressional stationery to write a letter to a Fairfax County judge, David Stitt, asking for leniency for his son, Nick Rahall III, who was facing felony robbery charges. According to the House ethics manual: &quot;Official stationery ... may be used only for official purposes.&quot; Rahall acknowledged that he should not have used Congressional stationery for his letter, but said it was not the same type that he uses for official or committee business. Rahall added he may have drawn the wrong paper &quot;[i]n the emotions&quot;, and that he would reimburse the Treasury Department for the cost of the paper. The United States House Committee on Ethics did not launch an inquiry into the incident.

Rahall was one of seven Democrats and twelve Republicans listed by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington in its annual &quot;Most Corrupt Members of Congress Report&quot; in 2011. Melanie Sloan, CREW&#x27;s executive director, said: &quot;Rep. Rahall abused his position to help his son and sister in clear violation of the House ethics rules.&quot; Rahall&#x27;s spokeswoman said: &quot;There is as little merit to these allegations today as there was then.&quot;

==Personal life==
Rahall and his second wife, Melinda Ross of Ashland, Kentucky, married in 2004. They have three children from his previous marriage, and three grandchildren.

In 2008, Rahall appeared on an episode of &quot;Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives&quot; which featured Hillbilly Hot Dogs of Lesage, West Virginia. Rahall introduced the hot dog that&#x27;s named after him on the menu, Rahall&#x27;s Red Hot Weenie.

In July 2009, Rahall jumped out of a plane to show his support for the coal industry. The event was intended to show the importance of the coal industry to both West Virginia and the United States as a whole. The act confused some, who questioned the reasoning behind the jump. It was noted that Rahall is involved with coal lobbyists and also receives contributions from the airline industry.

After leaving office, he became involved in political reform efforts, including joining nine other former members of Congress to co-author a 2021 opinion editorial advocating reforms of Congress.

<text>The Good Earth is a historical fiction novel by Pearl S. Buck published in 1931 that dramatizes family life in an early 20th-century Chinese village in Anhwei. It is the first book in her &quot;House of Earth&quot; trilogy, continued in &quot;Sons&quot; (1932) and &quot;A House Divided&quot; (1935). It was the best-selling novel in the United States in both 1931 and 1932, won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1932, and was influential in Buck&#x27;s winning the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1938. Buck, who grew up in China as the daughter of American missionaries, wrote the book while living in China and drew on her first-hand observation of Chinese village life. The realistic and sympathetic depiction of the farmer Wang Lung and his wife O-Lan helped prepare Americans of the 1930s to consider Chinese as allies in the coming war with Japan.

The novel was included in &quot;Life&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 outstanding books of 1924–1944. In 2004, the book returned to the bestseller list when chosen by the television host Oprah Winfrey for Oprah&#x27;s Book Club. 

A Broadway stage adaptation was produced by the Theatre Guild in 1932, written by the father and son playwriting team of Owen and Donald Davis, but critics gave a poor reception, and it ran only 56 performances. However, the 1937 film, &quot;The Good Earth&quot;, which was based on the stage version, was more successful.

== Plot ==
The story begins on Wang Lung&#x27;s wedding day and follows the rise and fall of his fortunes. The House of Hwang, a family of wealthy landowners, lives in the nearby town, where Wang Lung&#x27;s future wife, O-Lan, lives as a slave. However, the House of Hwang slowly declines due to opium use, frequent spending, uncontrolled borrowing and a general unwillingness to work.

Following the marriage of Wang Lung and O-Lan, both work hard on their farm and slowly save enough money to buy one plot of land at a time from the Hwang family. O-Lan delivers three sons and three daughters; the first daughter becomes mentally handicapped as a result of severe malnutrition brought on by famine. Her father greatly pities her and calls her &quot;Poor Fool&quot;, a name by which she is addressed throughout her life. O-Lan kills her second daughter at birth to spare her the misery of growing up in such hard times, and to give the remaining family a better chance to survive. 

During the devastating famine and drought, the family must flee to a large city in Kiangsu (Jiangsu) to find work. Wang Lung&#x27;s malevolent uncle offers to buy his possessions and land, but for significantly less than their value. The family sells everything except the land and the house. Wang Lung then faces the long journey south, contemplating how the family will survive walking, when he discovers that the &quot;firewagon&quot; (the Chinese word for the newly built train) takes people south for a fee.

In the city, O-Lan and the children beg while Wang Lung pulls a rickshaw. Wang Lung&#x27;s father begs but does not earn any money and sits looking at the city instead. They find themselves aliens among their more metropolitan countrymen who look different and speak in a fast accent. They no longer starve, due to the one-cent charitable meals of congee, but still live in abject poverty. Wang Lung longs to return to his land. When armies approach the city, he can only work at night hauling merchandise out of fear of being conscripted. One time, his son brings home stolen meat. Furious, Wang Lung throws the meat on the ground, not wanting his sons to grow up as thieves. O-Lan, however, calmly picks up the meat and cooks it. When a food riot erupts, Wang Lung is swept up in a mob that is looting a rich man&#x27;s house and corners the man himself, who fears for his life and gives Wang Lung all his money in order to buy his safety. O-Lan finds a cache of jewels elsewhere in the house and takes them for herself.

Wang Lung uses this money to bring the family home, buy a new ox and farm tools, and hire servants to work the land for him. In time, two more children are born, a twin son and daughter. When he discovers the jewels that O-Lan looted, Wang Lung buys the House of Hwang&#x27;s remaining land. He later sends his first two sons to school, also apprenticing the second one to a merchant, and retains the third one on the land. 

As Wang Lung becomes more prosperous, he buys a concubine named Lotus. O-Lan endures the betrayal of her husband when he takes the only jewels she had asked to keep for herself, two pearls, so that he can make them into earrings to present to Lotus. O-Lan&#x27;s health and morale deteriorate, and she eventually dies just after witnessing her first son&#x27;s wedding. Wang Lung finally appreciates her place in his life as he mourns her passing.

Wang Lung and his family move into town and rent the old House of Hwang. Now an old man, he desires peace within his family but is annoyed by constant disputes, especially between his first and second sons and their wives. Wang Lung&#x27;s third son runs away to become a soldier. At the end of the novel, Wang Lung overhears his sons planning to sell the land and tries to dissuade them. They say they will do as he wishes but smile knowingly at each other.

== Characters ==
* Wang Lung – poor, hard-working farmer born and raised in a small village of Anhwei (written as Anhui in pinyin) is the protagonist of the story and suffers hardships as he accumulates wealth and the outward signs of success. He has a strong sense of morality and adheres to Chinese traditions such as filial piety and duty to family. He believes that the land is the source of his happiness and wealth. By the end of his life he has become a very successful man and possesses a large plot of land which he buys from the House of Hwang. As his lifestyle changes he begins to indulge in the pleasures his wealth can buy—he purchases a concubine named Lotus. In Pinyin, Wang&#x27;s name is written &quot;Wang Long.&quot; Wang is likely to be the common surname &quot;Wang&quot; represented by the character 王.
* O-Lan – first wife, formerly a slave in the house of Hwang. A woman of few words, she is uneducated but nonetheless is valuable to Wang Lung for her skills, good sense, and indomitable work ethic. She is considered plain or ugly; her feet are not bound. Wang Lung sometimes mentions her wide lips. Nevertheless, she is hardworking and self-sacrificing. Towards the end of the book, O-Lan dies due to failing organs. When she lies on her deathbed, Wang Lung pays all of his attention to her and purchases her coffin not long before her death.
* Wang Lung&#x27;s father – An old, parsimonious senior who seems to only want his tea, food, and grandsons. He desires grandchildren to comfort him in his old age and becomes exceedingly needy and senile as the novel progresses. He has strong and out-dated morals.

===Wang Lung and O-Lan&#x27;s children===
* Nung En (Eldest Son) – he is a tall and goodly boy who Wang Lung is very proud of. He grows up as a scholar and goes through a rebellious phase before Wang Lung sends him south for three years to complete his education. He grows up to be a large and handsome man, and he marries the daughter of the local grain merchant, Liu. As his father&#x27;s position continues to rise, Nung En becomes increasingly enamored with wealth and he wants to live a showy and rich life. He is also the antagonist of the film.
* Nung Wen (Middle Son) – Wang Lung&#x27;s clever son. He has a shrewd mind for business but he&#x27;s against his father&#x27;s traditional ethics. He is described as crafty, thin, and wise with money, and he&#x27;s far more thrifty than Wang Lung&#x27;s eldest son. He becomes a merchant and weds a village girl due to thinking women from the town are too vain.
* The Poor Fool – first daughter and third child of O-Lan and Wang Lung, whose mental handicap may have been caused by severe starvation during her infancy. As the years go by, Wang Lung grows very fond of her. She mostly sits in the sun and twists a piece of cloth. By the time of Wang Lung&#x27;s death, his concubine Pear Blossom (see below) has taken charge of caring for her.
* Second Baby Girl – Killed immediately after delivery.
* Third Daughter – The twin of the youngest son. She is described as a pretty child with an almond flower-colored face and thin red lips. During the story, her feet are bound. She is betrothed to the son of a merchant (her sister-in-law&#x27;s family) at age 9 and moves to their home at age 13 due to the harassment of Wang Lung&#x27;s cousin.
* Youngest Son – Put in charge of the fields while the middle and eldest sons go to school. He grows up to be an independent person and runs away to become a soldier, against his father&#x27;s wishes.
* Eldest Son&#x27;s Wife – Daughter of a grain merchant and a town woman who hates the middle son&#x27;s wife due to seeing her as lower class. She is brought to the house before O-Lan&#x27;s death and is deemed proper and fit by the dying woman. Her first child is a boy.
* Middle Son&#x27;s Wife – A woman from the village. She hates the first son&#x27;s wife due to her snobbery and rudeness. Her first child is a girl.

===Wang Lung&#x27;s concubines and servants===
* Lotus Flower – Much-spoiled concubine and former prostitute. Eventually becomes old, fat, and less pretty from the tobacco and fattening foods. Helps arrange the eldest son&#x27;s and youngest daughter&#x27;s marriages. Loved by Wang Lung.
* Cuckoo – Formerly a slave in the house of Hwang. Becomes madame of the &quot;tea house&quot;, eventually becomes a servant to Lotus. Hated by O-Lan because she was cruel to her in the Hwang House.
* Pear Blossom – Bought as a young girl, she serves as a slave to Lotus. At the end of the novel, she becomes Wang Lung&#x27;s concubine because she says she prefers the quiet devotion of old men to the fiery passions of young men.
* Ching – Wang Lung&#x27;s faithful friend and neighbour. Shares a few beans with Wang Lung during the famine to save O-Lan&#x27;s life. After the famine kills Ching&#x27;s wife and forces him to give his daughter away, Ching sells his land to Wang Lung and comes to work for Wang Lung as his foreman. Dies from an accident in the fields because he was showing a fellow farmer how to thresh grain. Wang Lung has him buried just outside the entrance to the family graveyard, and orders that his own grave should be placed within the perimeter but as close to Ching as possible.

===Extended family line===
* Wang Lung&#x27;s Uncle – A sly, lazy man who is secretly one of the leaders of a band of thieves known as the Redbeards. He caused trouble for Wang Lung and others in the household for many years, until eventually, Wang Lung gives him enough opium to keep him in a harmless stupor for the rest of his life. He is described as skinny, gaunt, and very self-defensive. He takes advantage of the tradition that requires younger generations to care for their elders but completely disregards any moral obligation on himself.
* Uncle&#x27;s Wife – becomes a friend of Lotus; also becomes addicted to opium. Very fat, greedy and lazy.
* Uncle&#x27;s Son – Wild and lazy, leads Nung Wen into trouble and eventually leaves to become a soldier. Disrespectful and visits many concubines. Can be described as a sexual predator.

==Political influence==
Some scholars have seen &quot;The Good Earth&quot; as creating sympathy for China in the oncoming war with Japan. &quot;If China had not captured the American imagination,&quot; said one, &quot;it might just have been possible to work out a more satisfactory Far Eastern policy,&quot; but such works as &quot;The Good Earth&quot;, &quot;infused with an understandable compassion for the suffering Chinese, did little to inform Americans about their limited options in Asia.&quot; The diplomatic historian Walter LaFeber, however, although he agrees that Americans grew enamored of heroic Chinese portrayed by writers such as Buck, concluded that &quot;these views of China did not shape U.S. policy after 1937. If they had, Americans would have been fighting in Asia long before 1941.&quot;

The Columbia University political scientist Andrew J. Nathan praised Hilary Spurling&#x27;s book &quot;Pearl Buck in China: Journey to The Good Earth&quot;, saying that it should move readers to rediscover Buck&#x27;s work as a source of insight into both revolutionary China and the United States&#x27; interactions with it. Spurling observes that Buck was the daughter of American missionaries and defends the book against charges that it is simply a collection of racist stereotypes. In her view, Buck delves deeply into the lives of the Chinese poor and opposed &quot;religious fundamentalism, racial prejudice, gender oppression, sexual repression, and discrimination against the disabled.&quot;

==Peripatetic manuscript==
Buck wrote the novel in Nanjing, spending mornings in the attic of her university house to complete the manuscript in one year (). In 1952, the typed manuscript and several other papers belonging to Buck were placed on display at the museum of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in New York. It disappeared after the exhibit, and in a memoir (1966), Buck is said to have written, &quot;The devil has it. I simply cannot remember what I did with that manuscript.&quot; After Buck died in 1973, her heirs reported it stolen. It finally turned up at Freeman&#x27;s Auctioneers &amp; Appraisers in Philadelphia around 2007 when it was brought in for consignment. The FBI were notified and it was handed over by the consignor.

<text>Stephen Scott Emory McInnis (born May 9, 1953) is an American politician and lawyer who was a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Colorado from 1993 to 2005. In August 2010, McInnis lost his bid to become the Republican nominee for Governor of Colorado after a plagiarism accusation and apology hurt his standing. In November 2014, McInnis was elected a member of the Mesa County Board of County Commissioners—beginning term in office in January 2015.

The McInnis Canyons National Conservation Area, west of Grand Junction, is named for him.

==Education and professional history==
Born in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, McInnis graduated from Glenwood Springs High School and attended Mesa State College in Grand Junction, Colorado. He earned a B.A. from Fort Lewis College in 1975 and a J.D. from St. Mary&#x27;s University in San Antonio, Texas, in 1980. He served as a police officer in Glenwood Springs, worked as a hospital director, and started a law practice in Colorado.

McInnis is a member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) and is an honorary adviser for the National Student Leadership Conference.

==Political career==

=== Colorado House of Representatives ===
From 1983 to 1993, McInnis served in the state house of representatives, where he was elected House Majority Leader and served as Chairman of the Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee.

=== U.S. Congress ===
In 1992, McInnis was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives representing Colorado&#x27;s 3rd district and served six terms, from January 1993 to January 2005. Following the Chandra Levy investigation, McInnis &quot;proposed that the House of Representatives adopt strict rules prohibiting members from having romantic or sexual relationships with interns they supervise.&quot; While in Congress, McInnis held a position on the powerful Committee on Ways and Means.

Along with former Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, McInnis sponsored legislation to redesignate Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Monument as a national park in 1999. In 2000, McInnis and former senators Ben Nighthorse Campbell and Wayne Allard authored the Great Sand Dunes National Park Act, and four years later the Great Sand Dunes became the country&#x27;s 58th national park.

While in office, McInnis received numerous awards. He was named &quot;Person of the Decade&quot; by &quot;The Glenwood Post&quot; in 1999 and &quot;Best Local Government Official&quot; by &quot;The Grand Junction Daily Sentinel&quot; from 1999 to 2003. Other awards Scott has received include the Colorado Association of Homebuilders&#x27; Award for Government Service, the Legislator of the Year Award from the Colorado Wildlife Federation, the Golden Bulldog Award from Watchdogs of the Treasury, the National Security Leadership Award from the American Security Council, the Sound Dollar Award from the Free Congress Foundation, the Spirit of Free Enterprise Award from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Hero of the Taxpayer Award from The Americans for Tax Reform, the Tax Fighter Award from the National Tax Limitation Committee and the Friend of Farm Bureau award from the American Farm Bureau Federation.

McInnis once employed Josh Penry, who is now a former Colorado state senator, and McInnis has been described as Penry&#x27;s political &quot;mentor.&quot;

====Campaign Scrutiny====
McInnis&#x27;s Congressional campaign committee came under scrutiny in 2005 by the Federal Election Commission after Democrats filed a complaint alleging that the campaign improperly issued payments to McInnis&#x27;s wife for her work as campaign manager in 2004 when Scott McInnis was not actively seeking office. McInnis&#x27;s campaign explained that Lori McInnis was employed by the campaign committee to maintain campaign archives, direct money to other campaigns, and act as liaison with the accounting firm retained by the campaign. McInnis&#x27;s chief of staff stated that it was &quot;naive to assume that simply because Congressman McInnis is not seeking re-election that we aren&#x27;t participating in the election.&quot; The FEC ultimately dismissed the complaint and found no evidence of wrongdoing by the McInnis campaign.

After being regarded as the early Republican frontrunner in Colorado&#x27;s 2008 U.S. Senate election, McInnis decided not to enter the race, citing family reasons.

===2010 gubernatorial election===

McInnis had been mentioned as a possible candidate for either the United States Senate or the Colorado governorship in 2010. Although he stated that he was not planning to seek the Senate seat, he did indicate some interest in challenging incumbent Bill Ritter for Colorado&#x27;s top executive office. Ritter later announced his retirement. On May 21, 2009, McInnis officially announced his candidacy for Governor. Though he did not gain the nomination at the party convention, he was widely considered the front runner for the Republican nomination until accusations of plagiarism gained attention. In the August 10 primary he lost the nomination by slightly more than 1 percent of the ballots cast to entrepreneur Dan Maes.

====Plagiarism story====
In 2005, after leaving Congress, McInnis received a two-year fellowship at the Hasan Family Foundation. He was paid $300,000 to do speaking engagements and &quot;research and write a monthly article on water issues that can be distributed to media and organizations as well as be available on the Internet.&quot; Soon after he started his fellowship, McInnis took a full-time job at the firm Hogan &amp; Hartson (now Hogan Lovells).

In 2010, McInnis&#x27;s work for the Hasan foundation, a total of 150 pages in 23 parts, was posted to the foundation&#x27;s website. Teresa Fishman, director of the Center for Academic Integrity at Clemson University, reviewed McInnis&#x27;s work and called several of the parts a clear case of plagiarism. &quot;Both ... ideas and words [were] lifted&quot; from a 20-year-old essay by now-Colorado Supreme Court Justice Gregory J. Hobbs. A McInnis spokesperson said that McInnis &quot;relied on the research and expertise&quot; of Rolly Fischer, a Glenwood Springs engineer who worked at the Colorado River Water Conservation District, and Fischer was the one who handled the parts that were accused of being plagiarism. &quot;His GOP primary challenger, Dan Maes, says McInnis should &#x27;man up&#x27; about the plagiarism&quot; and &quot;faulted McInnis for blaming a research assistant.&quot; Fischer himself rebutted any effort to blame him: &#x27;Scott&#x27;s responsible for it,&#x27; he told the Glenwood Springs &quot;Post Independent&quot; and would not comment further. In a televised interview with KMGH-TV investigative reporter John Ferrugia, McInnis was asked several times who actually wrote the articles and he would not give a definitive answer. McInnis continued to evade the question until finally, in a written apology statement, McInnis said &quot;I should have been more vigilant in my review of research material Rolly submitted.&quot; The 82-year-old Fischer subsequently told KMGH-TV investigative reporter John Ferrugia he had not known the articles were to be published; had not known McInnis had a foundation grant; had been paid a few hundred dollars for each article; had considered them private communications; and had been asked by the McInnis campaign as the story broke in July 2010 to sign a letter apologizing for his, Fischer&#x27;s, failure to provide attribution. Fischer said he would never sign the letter, and felt that McInnis had lied to him.

An aide said McInnis had offered an apology to the judge and said McInnis hoped to meet with the judge, and in his statement McInnis apologized to voters for his &quot;mistake... It&#x27;s unacceptable, it&#x27;s inexcusable, but it was also unintentional.&quot;

The Hasan foundation chairwoman Seeme Hasan issued an initial statement saying in part, &quot;We will conduct an independent, internal investigation and if the allegations are proven to be true, we will demand Mr. McInnis return all monies paid to him by the Foundation.&quot; Hasan&#x27;s husband Dr. Malik Hasan, a foundation board member, said he had hired McInnis as a fellow. Speaking only for himself, he said he was &quot;deeply disappointed by the quantity and quality of McInnis&#x27;s work, [having among other things] ... expected it would be a full- or substantial-time job. ... I am doubly disappointed since learning of the plagiarism. ... I&#x27;m going to suggest [he] return a substantial amount of the money to the foundation.&quot; McInnis&#x27;s spokesperson said McInnis &quot;was also calling to offer apologies&quot; to the Hasan foundation. This report characterized the foundation as &quot;right-leaning.&quot;

Also in the 2010 election cycle, Dr. and Mrs. Hasan&#x27;s son Ali failed to receive the nomination for the position of state treasurer, and did not receive endorsement from McInnis in his bid. Dr. Hasan said that &quot;while he and his wife were upset that McInnis refused to endorse their son ..., it had nothing to do with asking McInnis for the foundation&#x27;s money back.&quot;

On Jan. 6, 2011, Hogan Lovells confirmed that McInnis would not return to its Denver office.

As of May 20, 2011, McInnis has been cleared of any official ethics violations as an attorney by the Office of Attorney Regulation Counsel (OARC). Upon review of the evidence and interviews with key witnesses, the Attorney Regulation Counsel determined there was insufficient evidence to support a claim of a violation of the disciplinary rules. Additionally, &quot;Regulation Counsel John S. Gleason says the &quot;Denver Post&quot; reported erroneous facts. &#x27;While both Fisher and [Hasan Family Foundation Chairwoman Seeme] Hasan provided contradictory accounts to the press at the time this issue was raised by the &quot;Denver Post&quot;, a more thorough review of their archived materials demonstrates that both had forgotten several specific communications with McInnis that had occurred several years before,&#x27; states Gleason.&quot;

Various correspondences between Rollie Fischer and McInnis demonstrate that in 2005, McInnis instructed Fischer not to plagiarize any work in the articles he drafted because they would likely be published by the Hasan Family Foundation. Moreover, Fischer continues to claim that his use of Justice Hobbs’ article did not constitute plagiarism, because the article was part of the &quot;public domain&quot;. Fischer also admits that he did not disclose to McInnis that he had imported the work of Justice Hobbs. &quot;&#x27;Mr. Fischer alone chose to import large sections of text previously written by the Honorable Justice Gregory Hobbs into one of the articles drafted for Mr. McInnis, without credit citation,&#x27; states the results of the investigation.&quot;

Additionally, as it turns out, in 2005, McInnis did disclose his retention of a research assistant to Ms. Hasan in writing, contrary to the Foundation&#x27;s representation in its press release in 2010. Ms. Hasan was responsible for the daily care of her ill mother at the time of the correspondence, and claims she had simply forgotten by 2010.

&quot;McInnis and the Hasan Foundation last summer reached a settlement agreement to repay the organization, though McInnis maintained that his only error was trusting Fischer.&quot;

&quot;Jennifer Raiffie, who served as Tom Tancredo&#x27;s communications director when he entered last year&#x27;s gubernatorial race as a third-party conservative candidate, ... believes McInnis has now been publicly exonerated. ... Tancredo entered the race [after the plagiarism allegations were made against McInnis] because he felt conservatives had lost a viable candidate.&quot; Raiffie suggested that the &quot;Post&quot; should now subject to an ethics investigation. &quot;I’m happy for Scott and his family that his name can now be cleared,&quot; Raiffie said. &quot;The &quot;Denver Post&quot; did a job on him with this story during the campaign. Their unfair and incomplete/biased reporting cost him personally and professionally. The &quot;Denver Post&quot; did a disservice to us all in Colorado and should be investigated by Ethics Watch … like that will ever happen.&quot;

Reporting on the OARC ruling, the &quot;Post&quot; detailed how comments from the various parties in 2005, summer 2010 and in depositions with OARC as summarized by OARC varied. Fischer acknowledged his OARC deposition but declined further comment. Hasan and foundation officials questioned some of the OARC assertions and stood by their 2010 comments but also was &quot;ready for the issue to be put to rest. Ethics Watch released a statement saying it considers the matter closed.&quot; OARC said it could not release the evidence on which it based its ruling under Colorado Supreme Court rules. McInnis did not return a phone message from the paper seeking comment.

==Electoral history==

<text>Marilyn Neoma Musgrave (née Shuler; born January 27, 1949), American politician, is a former Republican member of the United States House of Representatives who served from 2003 to 2009, representing the 4th District of Colorado.

Musgrave served on the Agriculture and Small Business Committees. In the 110th Congress, she served as Ranking Minority member of the Specialty Crops, Rural Development, and Foreign Agriculture subcommittee. She also served as the Region Two representative for the Republican Steering Committee. She was the first Republican woman elected to Congress from Colorado.

Musgrave lost her seat in 2008 to Democratic challenger Betsy Markey by a 56 to 44 percent margin.

Musgrave currently works for the Susan B. Anthony List, a non-profit that supports anti-abortion women in politics.

==Background and early political career==
Musgrave was born Marilyn Neoma Shuler in Greeley, Colorado. She graduated from Eaton High School in 1968, and attended Colorado State University (CSU) in Fort Collins, graduating with a B.A. in social studies in 1972. Musgrave married while attending CSU. She and her husband Steve Musgrave settled in Fort Morgan, south of Greeley, where they owned and operated a bale stacking business. Musgrave also taught school. The Musgraves have four children and eight grandchildren.

Musgrave&#x27;s career in elective office began in 1991, when she served one term on the Fort Morgan School Board, where she focused on changing the local sex education curriculum to abstinence-only. She was also involved in the Fort Morgan Right To Life chapter, at one time serving as its president. Musgrave was then elected to the Colorado State House of Representatives in 1992, and served there until after her successful 1998 campaign for a Colorado State Senate seat. While serving in the state senate, Musgrave was selected the Senate Republican Caucus Chairman. In 2002, Musgrave ran for the Fourth Congressional District seat being vacated by Bob Schaffer.

Musgrave is a devout Pentecostal (she is a member of the Assemblies of God), and was one of three Pentecostals serving in the 110th Congress. The others—Republicans—were Tim Johnson of Illinois and Todd Tiahrt of Kansas.

Musgrave was one of the most conservative members of the state legislature, often sparring with more socially moderate and liberal legislators. She focused her time on social issues. She staunchly opposed granting civil unions and marriage for same-sex couples. In another area she was active on small business and agricultural issues, particularly authoring bills to exempt farm equipment dealers from sales tax and lowering taxes on small business.

==Election history==

===2002 election===

In 2002, after Congressman Bob Schaffer retired, Musgrave ran for and won the Republican nomination to succeed him. Her opponent was businessman Jeff Bedingfield. She received a big boost in the primary when she gained the endorsements of Schaffer and former Senator William Armstrong.

In November 2002 Musgrave defeated Democratic State Senate President Stan Matsunaka 55% to 42%. She had been favored most of the way due to her large campaign war chest and the district&#x27;s traditional Republican lean (it had been in Republican hands since 1973).

===2004 re-election===
In 2004, Musgrave faced Matsunaka again. Matsunaka attacked Musgrave as a &quot;one-trick pony,&quot; referring to her focus on outlawing same-sex marriage (see below). He also claimed that Musgrave neglected the 4th&#x27;s needs and provided poor constituent services.

In the end, Musgrave held her seat by taking 51% of the vote to Matsunaka&#x27;s 45%. Musgrave won most of the counties in this large and mostly rural district by margins of 2-to-1 or more. However, 85% of the district&#x27;s vote is cast in two counties which account for only a third of its land—Larimer (home to Fort Collins) and Weld (home to Greeley). Musgrave lost Larimer County by 4,100 votes. She also lost the district&#x27;s share of Boulder County, including Longmont. She was only able to hold onto her seat by winning Weld County by 15 points (almost 10,000 votes)—far larger than the overall margin of victory. She was also undoubtedly helped by George W. Bush&#x27;s 58% win in the district.

While Matsunaka only entered the race in May and raised around $800,000, Musgrave was heavily targeted by a 527 group funded by Colorado activists such as Tim Gill. The ads featured an actress dressed up like Musgrave picking a corpse&#x27;s pocket and stealing from a soldier in combat.

===2006 re-election===

In 2006, Musgrave faced Democratic state representative Angie Paccione. Also running was Reform Party candidate Eric Eidsness, who had previously considered a Republican Party primary challenge to Musgrave but later decided to become a Democrat.

The election was even tighter than the last. Musgrave won a third term by only 5,984 votes, taking 45.61% of the vote to Paccione&#x27;s 43.12% and Eidsness&#x27; 11.28%. She lost Larimer County by an even larger margin than in 2004. However, Musgrave won Weld County by just under 6,700 votes/

===2008 campaign===

Musgrave ran for a fourth term in the 2008 election, held on November 4, 2008. Her opponent was Betsy Markey, the regional director for Senator Ken Salazar in the 4th.

Musgrave was soundly defeated, taking only 44 percent of the vote to Markey&#x27;s 56 percent—the second-largest margin of defeat for a Republican incumbent in the 2008 cycle, after Florida&#x27;s Tom Feeney. In a repeat of 2004 and 2006, she easily won most of the rural counties in her district while losing badly in Larimer County—this time by 32,300 votes. She lost Weld County by 5,700 votes after having carried it in her previous bids, sealing her defeat.

After her defeat, Musgrave would not comment on the election results with the media, nor would she concede the race or contact Markey to congratulate her. She later recorded a robocall for Republican Georgia senator Saxby Chambliss, saying that she was defeated by &quot;leftist special interests&quot; who &quot;smothered the truth with vicious attacks and lies.&quot;

==Political ideology==
The American Conservative Union ranked Musgrave as the most conservative member of the House, with a 99 lifetime rating. The National Journal ranked her as the 28th most conservative member based on her 2007 votes. Her original House Website contained the phrase, &quot;Defending our way of life through conservative leadership.&quot; She was a member of the conservative Republican Study Committee House caucus and its &quot;Values Action Team.&quot; In 2005, Musgrave received the &quot;Distinguished Christian Statesman&quot; award from D. James Kennedy&#x27;s Center for Christian Statesmanship.

Other political groups that Musgrave is allied with include the National Right to Life Committee, Focus on the Family, Alliance for Marriage, the Family Research Council, the National Taxpayers Union, the Christian Coalition, and the Traditional Values Coalition. Musgrave has taken trips sponsored by The Heritage Foundation and Club for Growth.

Following her defeat in 2008, Musgrave began working for the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion organization.

===Same-sex marriage===
Musgrave sponsored of the unsuccessful Federal Marriage Amendment in the 108th and 109th Congresses, originally drafted by the Alliance for Marriage. This proposed constitutional amendment would define marriage as &quot;the union of a man and a woman&quot; and bar any recognition of same-sex marriage or &quot;legal incidents thereof&quot; in the United States.

In a September 2006 speech to the Family Research Council&#x27;s &quot;Values Voters Summit&quot;, Musgrave said, &quot;as we face the issues that we are facing today, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything more important out there than the marriage issue.&quot; Musgrave later distanced herself from these claims during the 2006 election.

===Abortion===

Musgrave is anti-abortion, staunchly opposing elective abortion. At the national level, she has supported the Partial Birth Abortion Ban and the Child Custody Protection Act. Musgrave is an original cosponsor of the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act. She received the support of the Susan B. Anthony List as a candidate and now works for the organization.

Musgrave opposes public funding for embryonic stem cell research on abortion-related grounds, and was a vocal proponent of the 2005 congressional intervention into the Terri Schiavo case:

When we talk about a permanent vegetative state, I am offended by that. Terri smiles and acknowledges the people that love her when they come to see her. She cries when they leave. How heartless are we to call somebody like Terri Schiavo a vegetable? What are we thinking?When we think about this case, we need to think about the message that we are sending to our children and our grandchildren. What we do in this Chamber tonight is as important as anything we have done in defending our Nation, in doing the things that we do as Members of Congress.

Musgrave weighed in on the Emergency Contraception controversy. On July 25, 2005, Musgrave criticized a witness at a congressional subcommittee hearing who had claimed she was &quot;humiliated and discriminated against&quot; at a pharmacist&#x27;s refusal to fill a prescription for emergency contraception, claiming that it was only an issue of &quot;inconvenience&quot; to be denied emergency contraception. In 2003, a Musgrave submitted an amendment to the &quot;Runaway, Homeless, and Missing Children Protection Act&quot;, which would have prevented distribution of contraception to runaway teen. The amendment was not part of the final legislation

===Second Amendment rights===
Musgrave strongly opposes gun control and successfully passed an amendment prohibiting the enforcement of a federal requirement to sell trigger locks with all handguns. She is the founder of the 2nd Amendment Caucus and is working to protect gun manufacturers and dealers from certain types of lawsuits.

Musgrave is a close ally of the Gun Owners of America (GOA). Another close ally of Musgrave&#x27;s from her state legislative days is Dudley Brown, who directs the Colorado wing of the GOA, the Rocky Mountain Gun Owners.
On September 25, 2004, Musgrave was a special guest speaker at the 19th annual Gun Rights Policy Conference awards luncheon, where she was named &quot;Gun Rights Legislator of the Year.&quot;

===Home schooling===
Musgrave advocates changing the laws to lend more support to families who home-school their children. According to her website, she believes that government intrudes too much on family affairs. Musgrave home schooled one of her children, as well.

Musgrave is closely linked to the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA). Also, members of Generation Joshua, an HSLDA branch that tries to involve youth in politics, were sent to Musgrave&#x27;s district in the final hours of the 2006 campaign.

===Workforce and economy===
Musgrave is one of the staunchest proponents of national Right to Work legislation, and was a cosponsor of The National Right to Work Act. Musgrave was heavily targeted by labor unions in the 2006 election. National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation president Mark Mix held a fundraiser for Musgrave at New York&#x27;s Harvard Club in 2006. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Musgrave helped lead the effort to urge President Bush to suspend &quot;Davis-Bacon&quot; prevailing wage protection in the Gulf Coast region. (Bush was quickly forced to rescind this suspension.)

===Taxes===
Musgrave is a strong supporter of income tax cuts, and supports making the 2001 federal tax cuts permanent. She also supports the elimination of the Estate tax and has voted to reduce tariffs on imported goods.

===Religion and public law===
In June 2006, Musgrave sponsored a resolution in Congress to declare 2007 as &quot;National Year of the Bible&quot;. The resolution text requested that President Bush issue a proclamation calling on all citizens to &quot;rediscover and apply the priceless and timeless message of the Bible&quot; and encourage them to join the U.S. Federal government in celebrating the year with Bible &quot;programs, ceremonies, and activities.&quot; The resolution died in committee.

In June 2005, Musgrave cited Coral Ridge Ministries founder D. James Kennedy, a minister, evangelist and Christian social conservative leader, as one of her inspirations to enter politics:

In the 2002 Republican primary debate with opponent Jeff Beddingfield in Greeley, Colorado, Musgrave stated that the First Amendment does not offer &quot;freedom &quot;from&quot; religion.&quot; In a 2003 interview with &quot;Today&#x27;s Pentecostal Evangel&quot;, Musgrave explained how her religious beliefs play a key function in her public position:

The problems in our culture are just symptoms of spiritual problems in our nation. We must return to God and biblical principles for answers. There are limitations to what we can do, but I&#x27;m so thankful I have a voice and a vote.

In March 2007, Musgrave joined the Congressional Prayer Caucus, which is chaired by J. Randy Forbes. Forbes states the organization&#x27;s purpose is to &quot;build a spiritual wall around America.&quot;

In May 2007, Musgrave participated in a &quot;Bible Reading Marathon&quot; event on the West Front of the US Capitol.

===Other issues===
Musgrave is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online poker. In 2006, she cosponsored H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act. In June 2008, Musgrave voted with the House Democrats and a minority of Republicans to save energy though the use of public transportation.

== Interest group ratings ==
The NRA Political Victory Fund gave Musgrave an &#x27;A&#x27; for her support of pro-gun issues facing Congress. The NRA-PVF states than an &#x27;A&#x27; for Musgrave indicates that she is solidly &#x27;pro-gun&#x27; and that she has &quot;supported NRA positions on key votes.&quot;

The Center for Christian Statesmanship, founded by D. James Kennedy of Coral Ridge Ministries, awarded Musgrave the &quot;Distinguished Christian Statesman Award&quot; in 2005.

The Christian Coalition has ranked Musgrave&#x27;s voting record at &#x27;100%&#x27; in support of the pro-Christian Coalition legislation listed on their scorecard. The Christian Coalition was founded in 1989 by Pat Robertson and is dedicated to helping give conservative Christians a voice in their government.

<doc id="410141" wikidata="Q1485805" url="?curid=410141" title="Joel Hefley">
<text>Joel Maurice Hefley (born April 18, 1935) is an American Republican politician who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives representing the 5th Congressional District of Colorado from 1987 to 2007. His wife, Lynn Hefley, is, like him, a former member of the Colorado State House of Representatives. They have three daughters.

He was born in Ardmore, the seat of Carter County in southeastern Oklahoma, earned his B.A. at Oklahoma Baptist University in Shawnee, and his M.A. at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater. He worked as a management consultant and then as executive director of the Colorado Community Planning and Research Council, a nonprofit organization. He was a member of the Colorado House of Representatives for one term in 1977–78. Hefley was subsequently elected to the Colorado Senate before entering the U.S. House of Representatives.

He served as chairman of the House Ethics Committee until 2005. His tenure propelled him from being &quot;among the most obscure members&quot; in the House to gaining national attention, when the Committee formally admonished House Majority Leader Tom DeLay three times; Hefley also handled the expulsion case of James Traficant, and oversaw the investigation of Alan Mollohan. Because Hefley had served 3 terms as chairman, he was term limited from serving as chairman in the 109th Congress.

When the new Congress opened in January 2005, House Republicans pushed through new rules curtailing the ways ethics investigations can be launched. While Hefley voted for the rules, he criticized the procedure, &quot;saying he thought the changes were a mistake since they were done without bipartisan discussion.&quot; Within a month, Rep. Doc Hastings was chosen as Hefley&#x27;s replacement due to Hefley&#x27;s chairmanship expiring.

On February 16, 2006, Hefley ended speculation as to whether he would seek re-election in 2006, instead retiring after 10 terms in Congress, despite pledging in 1986 that he would not serve longer than three terms (6 years.)

==Gay rights==
In 1998, Hefley introduced an amendment blocking federal funding for Executive Order 13087, an executive order issued by President Bill Clinton to prohibit discrimination against gay and lesbian employees in the federal government.

== 2006 Congressional race ==
In the August GOP primary to succeed him, Hefley backed his long-time aide, former administrative director Jeff Crank, who lost in a contentious six-way race to State Senator Doug Lamborn. Hefley was incensed at the tactics used in the election, particularly a mailed brochure from the Christian Coalition of Colorado associating Crank with &quot;public support for members and efforts of the homosexual agenda.&quot; Hefley said that he &quot;suspected, but couldn&#x27;t prove, collusion between Lamborn&#x27;s campaign, which is managed by Jon Hotaling, and the Christian Coalition of Colorado, which is run by Hotaling&#x27;s brother, Mark.&quot; Hefley called it &quot;one of the sleaziest, most dishonest campaigns I&#x27;ve seen in a long time,&quot; and, as a result, refused to endorse Lamborn.

<text>Arthur Hertzberg (June 9, 1921 – April 17, 2006) was a Conservative rabbi and prominent Jewish-American scholar and activist.

==Biography==
Avraham Hertzberg was born in Lubaczów, Poland, the eldest of five children, and left Europe in 1926 with his mother and grandmother to join his father in the United States, where he took the name Arthur. Hertzberg recalled that as a teenager in an Orthodox Jewish neighborhood in Baltimore, Maryland, he would not accept the notion that the literary world of talmudic learning, the kabbalistic books and the writing of the chasidim were less worthy as compared to the &quot;Iliad&quot;, the &quot;Odyssey&quot; or Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;. His father was an Orthodox rabbi trained in Eastern Europe, who taught Arthur to appreciate the richness of the Talmud and the other great works of Judaism. Although Hertzberg would later stray from his Orthodox upbringing and be ordained as a Conservative rabbi, he &quot;never used my &#x27;heresy&#x27; as the excuse to prefer the majority culture to my own.&quot; Hertzberg was a student of Ernst Cassirer at Columbia University in the winter of 1944-1945. After Cassirer&#x27;s death there, he conducted his funeral service as a young rabbi.
He was married to the former Phyllis Cannon from 1950 until his death. They are the parents of two daughters, Dr. Linda Beth and Susan Riva, and they have four grandchildren named Rachel, Mike, Michelle, and Derek.

Hertzberg&#x27;s love of Judaism and the Jewish texts was at the core of his life as a rabbi, scholar, educator and Jewish communal leader. Over the course of his 50-plus year career, Rabbi Hertzberg served as a congregational rabbi, president of both the American Jewish Policy Foundation and the American Jewish Congress, vice president of the World Jewish Congress and a leading representative of world Jewry in the historic Catholic–Jewish dialogue that commenced during the papacy of Pope John XXIII. Hertzberg was at the center of crucial events shaping American Jewish life after World War II.

A resident of Englewood, New Jersey, Hertzberg died on April 17, 2006, of heart failure en route to Pascack Valley Hospital in Westwood, New Jersey, at the age of 84. He was survived by his wife, daughters, brothers Rabbi Isaiah and Rabbi Joshua, and a sister, Eve Rosenfeld.

===Social activism===
Hertzberg participated in the 1943 Rabbis&#x27; march, walked with Martin Luther King Jr. in both the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the 1965 &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;, during the first of the Selma to Montgomery marches, at the height of the American civil rights movement. Hertzberg also served as an intermediary between the American Jewish community and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Hertzberg played a major role in significant issues faced by world Jewry community in the decades following World War II, including discussions with the Roman Catholic Church over the Vatican&#x27;s refusal to release documents pertaining to Pius XII.

==Views and influences==
Mordecai Kaplan was an influence on Hertzberg when he attended the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City. Kaplan proved to him that with talent and guts, you could be your own man even in mainstream America. He agreed with Kaplan and Salo W. Baron, that cultural and religious identity in America would continue to exist &quot;only if they were redefined and reconstructed.&quot; After the Six-Day War in 1967, he proposed the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel and debated with Golda Meir and Menachem Begin over their policies.

Hertzberg challenged the wisdom of what he viewed as banking the future of Jewish continuity on the twin pillars of unquestioned support for Israel and the veneration of the Holocaust. Referring to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., as &quot;the national cathedral of American Jewry&#x27;s Jewishness&quot;, Hertzberg questioned whether the memory of the Holocaust was sufficient to keep Jews &quot;on the reservation.&quot; Citing demographic studies, he contended that the proliferation of courses on the Holocaust would not be sufficient to stop a large number of Jews from leaving the Jewish community.

==Academic career==
Hertzberg graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 1940, received rabbinic ordination from the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in 1943 and a Ph.D. in history from Columbia University in 1966. He began his career as the director of the for Amherst College and the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and taught at Princeton, Rutgers, Columbia, Hebrew University, and Dartmouth. He was the Bronfman Visiting Professor of the Humanities at New York University from 1991 until his death in 2006.

==Rabbinic career==
In addition to his academic posts, Hertzberg was a rabbi for congregations in Philadelphia and Nashville, served as a chaplain in the United States Air Force from 1951 to 1953. He lived in Englewood, New Jersey, where he served as rabbi of Temple Emanu-El from 1956 to 1985, and remained as rabbi emeritus until his death. He also served as president of the American Jewish Policy Foundation since 1978, president of the American Jewish Congress from 1972 to &#x27;78, and vice president of the World Jewish Congress from 1975 to 1991.

==Meeting with John Paul II==
During Pope John Paul&#x27;s March 2000 Jerusalem visit, he asked the Pope numerous questions about his activities during the Second World War.

==Jewish scholarship==
Hertzberg also made his mark in Jewish scholarship. His landmark book, &quot;The French Enlightenment and the Jews: The Origins of Modern Anti-Semitism&quot; (1968), argued that the source of modern antisemitism could be traced to the ideas of such Age of Enlightenment philosophers as Voltaire. Similarly, his &quot;The Zionist Idea: A Historical Analysis and Reader&quot; (1959) pioneered the study of Zionism and provided generations of students with the understanding that modern Zionism was a secular movement to remake Jewish identity into one of the many modern secular nationalisms. Finally, although a self-styled pragmatic liberal, Hertzberg saw no contradiction between his political convictions and his reverence for a Jewish tradition shorn of its religious fundamentalism.

Hertzberg wrote, edited or co-edited over thirteen books. Hertzberg had planned to write two more books and had partially completed one at the time of his death, entitled &quot;This I Believe&quot;, an exploration of his personal theology. He had also intended to write a book explicating the Talmud to an educated but non-Orthodox Jewish audience, preserving the integrity of the source material but also demonstrating its relevance and accessibility to modern readers.

In his memoir &quot;A Jew in America&quot;, Hertzberg frequently referred to American poet Ralph Waldo Emerson. Emerson, a descendant of American Puritans who revolted against his heritage and became a Unitarian, wrote that &quot;every man is a conveyance on which all his ancestors ride.&quot; Hertzberg said he may not have opted to agree with every word of his Jewish forebears but wrote &quot;my respect and reverence for them is the foundation of my being.&quot;

<text>Alan Bowlby Mollohan (born May 14, 1943) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 1983 to 2011. He was a member of the Democratic Party and the Blue Dog Coalition.

The district encompasses the northern part of the state; it is based in Wheeling and includes Parkersburg, Morgantown, Fairmont and Clarksburg. He served on the House Appropriations Committee and was ranking Democrat on the Ethics Committee until being asked to step down in 2006. He was defeated in the Democratic primary election held on May 11, 2010, by Mike Oliverio.

==Early life and education==
Born in Fairmont, West Virginia, Mollohan is the son of former U.S. Representative Robert Mollohan. He attended Greenbrier Military School and graduated from the College of William &amp; Mary. Thereafter, Mollohan completed a Juris Doctor at West Virginia University College of Law.

== Early career ==
He served as &quot;Of Counsel&quot; for the Huntington, West Virginia branch of the law firm Nelson Mullins Riley &amp; Scarborough.

=== Military service ===
He served in the United States Army Reserve from 1970 to 1983, reaching the rank of captain.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Appropriations
**Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (Chairman)
**Subcommittee on Homeland Security
**Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies

==Political campaigns==
When Mollohan&#x27;s father retired in 1982 after 18 years in Congress spread out over two stints, his son won a very competitive contest to succeed him. He faced another close race in 1984, but was unopposed for a third term in 1986. He did not face serious opposition in a general election again. Indeed, the Republicans only put up a candidate against him four other times, in 1988, 1990, 1994 and 2006. He ran unopposed in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2008 and only faced Libertarian Richard Kerr in 1998 and 2000.

He faced stiff electoral competition when, in 1992, West Virginia lost a House seat due to the 1990 Census. The redistricting placed Mollohan against 2nd District Congressman Buckey Staggers. No other party put up a candidate, meaning that the Democratic primary was tantamount to election. It was predicted to be a tough primary even though the new district was more Mollohan&#x27;s district than Staggers&#x27;, but Mollohan succeeded in winning his party&#x27;s nomination with 60% of the vote.

===2010===

Mollohan faced a Democratic primary challenge on May 11, 2010, and lost to State senator Mike Oliverio, 56% to 44%. It was Mollohan&#x27;s first contested primary since he faced Harley Staggers Jr. in 1992 after their Congressional districts were merged.

Since his first election in 1982 he only faced a total of six Republican challengers, the most recent being former state delegate Chris Wakim in 2006. In that race, Mollohan won 64% of the vote.

==Controversies==

On February 28, 2006, the National Legal and Policy Center filed a 500-page ethics complaint against Mollohan, alleging that the congressman misrepresented his assets on financial disclosure forms. Mollohan&#x27;s real estate holdings and other assets have increased from $562,000 in 2000 to at least $6.3 million in 2004. For the period 1996 through 2004, NLPC alleged that his Financial Disclosure Reports failed to disclose real estate, corporate and financial assets that public records showed were owned by Mollohan and his wife.

On April 7, 2006, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Mollohan &quot;has fueled five non-profit groups in his West Virginia district with $250 million in earmark funding.&quot; Mollohan created these nonprofit groups, which include the West Virginia High Technology Consortium Foundation, Institute for Scientific Research, Canaan Valley Institute, Vandalia Heritage Foundation, and MountainMade Foundation. Leaders of these groups were sometimes investors with him, possibly leading to his own personal gain.

On April 21, 2006, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi announced that Mollohan would temporarily step down as the Ranking Democrat on the House Ethics Committee. Howard Berman of California took Mollohan&#x27;s place.

On April 25, 2006, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Mollohan and CEO Dale R. McBride of FMW Composite Systems Inc. of Bridgeport, West Virginia made a joint purchase of a farm along West Virginia&#x27;s Cheat River. Mollohan had directed a $2.1 million government contract earmarked to FWM Composite Systems to develop lightweight payload pallets for space-shuttle missions. Federal Bureau of Investigation agents have asked questions in Washington and West Virginia about Mollohan’s investments and whether they were properly disclosed, according to the Journal. Mollohan had previously acknowledged he may have made inadvertent mistakes on financial disclosure forms, and in June he filed corrections to his disclosure statements.

In January 2010, the U.S. Department of Justice stated that no charges would be filed against Mollohan and that it had closed its investigation. Ben Friedman of the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s office in Washington told CREW that the Justice Department has &quot;closed the investigation into the case.&quot;

<text>Charles Henry Gordon-Lennox, 6th Duke of Richmond, 6th Duke of Lennox, 1st Duke of Gordon, (27 February 1818 – 27 September 1903), styled the Earl of March until 1860, was a British Conservative politician.

==Background and education==

Born at Richmond House, London, he was the son of Charles Lennox, 5th Duke of Richmond, and his wife Lady Caroline Paget, daughter of Field Marshal Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey. He was educated at Westminster and Christ Church, Oxford, where he had a short career as a cricketer. He served in the Royal Horse Guards and was aide-de-camp to the Duke of Wellington. Charles was born with the surname Lennox; when his father inherited the Gordon estates from his uncle, the father took the surname Gordon-Lennox for himself and his issue, by royal licence dated 9 August 1836.

He owned 286,000 acres mostly in Banff, Aberdeen and Inverness. His Sussex holdings were 17,000 acres. By 1883, he had an income of £80,000 a year.

==Political career==

March entered politics as member for West Sussex in 1841. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1859. In 1860, he succeeded his father as Duke of Richmond and entered the House of Lords. He chaired the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment, which reported in 1866, and the Royal Commission on Water Supply in 1869, which concluded that there was a need for some sort of overall planning of water supplies for domestic use.

He was made a Knight of the Garter in 1867, and filled various positions in government in the Conservative administrations of the Earl of Derby, Disraeli and the marquess of Salisbury. In 1876 he was rewarded for his public service by being created Duke of Gordon and Earl of Kinrara in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was also Chancellor of the University of Aberdeen from 1861 until his death at Gordon Castle in 1903.

==Family==
Richmond married Frances Harriett Greville, daughter of Algernon Greville, on 28 November 1843. They had six children:
* Lady Caroline Gordon-Lennox (12 October 1844 – 2 November 1934), who acted as châtelaine of Goodwood after her mother&#x27;s death in 1887. She died unmarried in 1934.

<doc id="410147" wikidata="Q159720" url="?curid=410147" title="Tom Tancredo">
<text>Thomas Gerard Tancredo (; born December 20, 1945) is an American politician from Colorado, who represented the state&#x27;s sixth congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 1999 to 2009 as a Republican. He ran for President of the United States during the 2008 election, and was the Constitution Party&#x27;s unsuccessful nominee for Governor of Colorado in 2010.

Tancredo was elected to the Colorado House of Representatives in 1976 and served two terms. After working in the United States Department of Education during the Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations, he was elected to the United States Congress, and served five terms. He decided to not seek re-election in 2008, instead running a presidential campaign, centered on the issues of illegal immigration and terrorism. He dropped out of the race in December 2007 to assist former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in his campaign for the nomination.

Tancredo announced on July 26, 2010, that he planned to change parties and run for Governor of Colorado on the American Constitution Party ticket. He received 617,030 votes (36.7%), coming in second place, well ahead of the Republican Party nominee Dan Maes, who got about 11% of the vote.

Tancredo ran for governor in 2014, this time as a Republican, because of his opposition to Colorado governor John Hickenlooper&#x27;s refusal to execute convicted murderer Nathan Dunlap, and because of Hickenlooper&#x27;s attempts to pass gun control legislation. Tancredo competed for the Republican Party&#x27;s nomination with Bob Beauprez, Steve House, Greg Brophy, Mike Kopp, and Scott Gessler. Tancredo lost the primary to Beauprez. He once again left the Republican Party in 2015, becoming an independent. Tancredo again ran as a Republican for governor in 2018, but withdrew from the race.

==Early life, education and career==
Tancredo was born in Denver, Colorado, the son of Adeline (née Lombardi) and Gerald Tancredo. All four of his grandparents emigrated from Italy. He grew up in the then-predominantly Italian neighborhood of North Denver, and attended St. Catherine&#x27;s Elementary School and Holy Family High School. He graduated from the University of Northern Colorado with a degree in political science. Tancredo was active with the College Republicans and a conservative organization, Young Americans for Freedom (YAF).

As a Republican student activist Tancredo spoke in support of the Vietnam War. After graduating from the University of Northern Colorado he became eligible to serve in Vietnam in June 1969. Tancredo has said he went for his physical, telling doctors he had been treated for depression, and eventually got a &quot;1-Y&quot; deferment.

In 1976, while teaching history at Drake Junior High School in Arvada, he ran for and won a seat in the Colorado House of Representatives. He served two terms (1977–1981) and was one of the leaders of a vocal group of conservative legislators opposing the policies of Colorado Governor Dick Lamm. During the 1970s, Tancredo pioneered opposition to bilingual education, an issue that would remain a feature of his political orientation.

Tancredo was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to be the regional representative in Denver for the Department of Education in 1981. He stayed on through President George H. W. Bush&#x27;s administration in 1992, and pared the office&#x27;s staff from 225 to 60 employees. He became president of the Independence Institute in 1993, a conservative think tank based in Golden, Colorado, serving there until his election to Congress. He was a leader in the Colorado term limits movement.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

After Dan Schaefer decided not to run for a seventh full term in the 6th Congressional District in 1998, Tancredo narrowly won the five-way Republican primary, and the election in November. He was only the second person to represent the 6th District since its creation in 1983 (former astronaut Jack Swigert was elected as the district&#x27;s first congressman in 1982, but died before taking office). Despite his promise to serve only three terms in Congress, he decided to run for a fourth term and won re-election.

===Committee assignments===
* Foreign Affairs Committee
** Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health
** Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade
* Natural Resources Committee
** Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands

=== Significant legislation ===
Tancredo sponsored the Sudan Peace Act. The Sudan Peace Act says &quot;A viable, comprehensive, and internationally sponsored peace process, protected from manipulation, presents the best chance for a permanent resolution of the war, protection of human rights, and a self-sustaining Sudan.&quot; The Act passed the House of Representatives with a 359–8 vote, was passed unanimously in the Senate without amendment seven days later, and was signed into law on November 21, 2002.

Tancredo introduced the Mass Immigration Reduction Act. The act would have imposed an indefinite moratorium on immigration to the United States. Under the act, only spouses and children of American citizens would be allowed to immigrate, which Tancredo estimated would amount to 300,000 immigrants annually. The moratorium would last for at least the first five years of the act and, after that, until such time as there were fewer than 10,000 illegal immigrants entering per year. When those conditions were met, immigration would only have been allowed at whatever level the president and both houses of Congress agreed would have no adverse impact on wages, housing, the environment, or schools. When last introduced in 2003, the bill had 11 cosponsors. Organizations that have endorsed Tancredo&#x27;s bill include: NumbersUSA, Population-Environment Balance, Carrying Capacity Network, Federation for American Immigration Reform, Negative Population Growth, and the American Patrol. Tancredo introduced the bill in 2001 (H. R. 2712) and 2003 (H. R. 946). Tancredo did not re-introduce the bill in 2005. In 2007, he proposed an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to &quot;establish English as the official language of the United States&quot;, (H.R. 19).

In 2005, Tancredo introduced a resolution calling on the president to recognize the government of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and to abandon the One-China policy. He has been critical of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. This has since been modified and reintroduced as H. Con. Res. 73.

==2008 presidential campaign==
In February 2005, Tancredo announced he would seek the Republican nomination for president if all other candidates failed to address the illegal immigration problem.

On February 9, 2006, Tancredo addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), the annual conference of the American Conservative Union. He scored 5% of the vote in the 2008 CPAC straw poll.

On January 16, 2007, Tancredo announced that he formed an exploratory committee on seeking the presidential nomination of the Republican Party. He said that the Republican Party needs someone who can offer America a &quot;common sense agenda&quot;.

A spokesman for Tancredo&#x27;s exploratory committee has confirmed that he would not run on a third party platform, and that &quot;they&#x27;ve had no intention to run as a third-party candidate, ever, and we&#x27;ll never consider that because he&#x27;s a Republican, period.&quot;

On February 13, the American Conservative Union issued ratings for potential presidential candidates. Tancredo took first with a lifetime ranking of 99 out of 100. The website ConservativesBetrayed.com polled 525 people who attended CPAC 2007, and 88.1% believed that Tancredo would govern as a conservative. Newt Gingrich polled next at 87.9%.

At the 2007 CPAC conference, held March 1–3, Tancredo was ranked sixth in the CPAC straw poll, with 9%, when first and second choices were combined.

On April 2, 2007, Tancredo announced that he would run for president in the 2008 election. This announcement was made on 1040 WHO Talk Radio in Iowa. He denounced other Republican candidates for their lack of consistency on the illegal immigration issue, the issue on which Tancredo will run. In early April, he also participated in what was billed as the first online presidential debate, against fellow Republican and presidential candidate Duncan Hunter.

In his speech in 2007 to CPAC, Tancredo said:

If you want to call me a single-issue candidate, that&#x27;s fine, just so long as you know that my single issue is the survival and the success of the conservative movement in America.

In a May 3, 2007, debate among the ten candidates for the 2008 Republican Presidential nomination, Tancredo was one of three who raised their hands when asked if anyone did not believe in the theory of evolution.

On August 10, 2007, Rep. Tom Tancredo&#x27;s presidential campaign reportedly was the victim of an e-mail hoax on the eve of the Republican Party straw poll in Ames, Iowa. &quot;The Des Moines Register&quot; reports that a hoax e-mail sent on Friday to almost 500 Tancredo supporters told them—falsely—that chartered buses to ferry them to the daylong events had either been cancelled or delayed.

On September 5, 2007, during a visit to Concord, New Hampshire, Tancredo made it clear that he supports strictly enforcing immigration laws and deporting all illegal immigrants. He believes so-called sanctuary policies provide safe havens for criminals. Tancredo also mentioned his support of the building of a fence between Mexico and the United States, and that mayors and city council members who adopt sanctuary city policies should face criminal charges. He urged New Hampshire Governor John Lynch to veto an upcoming immigration bill and demanded the ouster of the bill&#x27;s sponsors.

On November 13, 2007, the Tancredo campaign released an ad called &quot;Tough on Terror&quot; in which a hypothetical terrorist attack occurs in a shopping mall. The ad blames inept border security for the attack and flashes images of an injured child and a wrecked train. A voiceover comments, &quot;There are consequences to open borders beyond the 20 million aliens who have come to take our jobs... the price we pay for spineless politicians who refuse to defend our borders against those who come to kill.&quot;

On his 62nd birthday December 20, 2007, Tancredo ended his candidacy for the 2008 Republican Presidential nomination, and endorsed Mitt Romney.

Individual contributions made up most of the campaign cash that Tancredo had received, being about 97% of his total pocketbook. He granted himself $200 for his campaign and received no federal funding. $88,457 of his money came from interest from the campaign&#x27;s bank accounts and loans from outside sources. The majority of Tancredo&#x27;s funds were not disclosed.

==Gubernatorial campaigns==
===2010===
After he ended his run for president, Tancredo decided against running for reelection. Former Republican gubernatorial candidate Bob Beauprez said he spoke to Tancredo about possible runs for governor or Senate in 2010.

Tancredo spoke at the Constitution Party&#x27;s national committee meeting on October 23, 2009.

In July 2010, Tancredo warned the two Republican candidates for governor, Scott McInnis and Dan Maes, that he would launch a third-party bid as candidate of the Constitution Party&#x27;s Colorado branch if the Republican primary winner was behind in general election polling and did not drop out. Tancredo felt that McInnis was unelectable because his plagiarism scandal had exposed him as &quot;basically a fraud,&quot; while Maes&#x27; campaign finance violations likewise made him unelectable. Tancredo subsequently announced that he was going ahead with plans to run as a Constitution Party candidate.

Tancredo selected Pat Miller as his running mate.

Tancredo placed second in the election with 36.5 percent of the vote, well ahead of Maes, the Republican Party candidate.

In January 2011 Tancredo re-registered as a Republican, saying it is the &quot;only game in town&quot;.

===2014===

Tancredo announced he would run for governor again in 2014. He was angry at Colorado governor John Hickenlooper because Hickenlooper had passed gun restrictions, and because Hickenlooper had granted a stay of execution for Nathan Dunlap, the man responsible for the 1993 Aurora, Colorado shooting that killed 4. He lost the Republican primary to Bob Beauprez, who went on to lose the general election to Hickenlooper.

===2018===
On October 31, 2017, Tancredo announced he would run for Governor of Colorado a third time. His bid was fueled in part by Republican politicians&#x27; reluctance to criticize the cancellation of an April 2018 VDARE event where Tancredo was scheduled to speak. A central theme of his campaign is strong opposition to illegal immigration, and he vowed to defund the city of Denver due to its status as a sanctuary city.

On January 30, 2018, Tancredo announced he was withdrawing from the race.

==Political action committees==

===Team America PAC===
Tancredo founded the Team America political action committee in 2004 in order to raise contributions for congressional candidates who opposed illegal immigration. Campaign laws forced Tancredo to resign from Team America PAC. The PAC was noted for targeting incumbent Congressman Chris Cannon in the 2006 Republican primary. In 2009, reporters discovered that Marcus Epstein, the executive director of Team America, had assaulted an African American woman in 2007, and had used a racial epithet. Tancredo kept Epstein on his staff despite the guilty plea.

===American Legacy Alliance===
In June 2011 Tancredo founded a Super PAC called the American Legacy Alliance to support candidates for federal office who oppose illegal immigration.

==Political positions==

Tancredo traces his interest in politics to the eighth grade, when he played Fidel Castro in a class assignment. Tancredo urges America to reject &quot;the siren song of multiculturalism&quot; and depicts Islam as &quot;a civilization bent on destroying ours&quot;. In July 2005, Tancredo proposed that America respond to any future terrorist attack by bombing Mecca and other holy sites. In September 2006, when Pope Benedict XVI gave a speech quoting a 14th-century Byzantine emperor who said the prophet Mohammed had brought &quot;things only evil and inhuman&quot;, sparking Muslim anger throughout the world, Tancredo urged him not to apologize.

=== Abortion ===
Tancredo has said that abortion &quot;compromises the sanctity of life&quot; and &quot;attacks the most vulnerable among us: unborn boys and girls&quot;. He does not support the granting of federal funds to &quot;any organization that promotes abortion&quot;. He voted in favor of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, and in favor of legislation requiring parental notification when a minor seeks an abortion. He received an &quot;A&quot; on the National Right to Life Committee report card, indicating that he votes in Congress on the anti-abortion side of this issue.

In the first Republican debate held on May 3, 2007, Tancredo agreed that the U.S. Supreme Court should overturn the 1973 &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; decision, adding that it would be &quot;the greatest day in this country&#x27;s history&quot;.

Tancredo was criticized by anti-abortion forces for accepting over $20,000 in donations from John Tanton, founder of the Federation for American Immigration Reform and a founder of a Planned Parenthood chapter.

=== Immigration ===
Tom Tancredo is perhaps best known for his opposition to immigration. Tancredo founded the Congressional Immigration Reform Caucus in May 1999. He served as its chairman until January 2007, when he turned the chairmanship over to Brian Bilbray.

Tancredo has called for halting illegal immigration, and a three-year moratorium on all legal immigration to allow those immigrants already in the country to be assimilated. Tancredo called for the deportation of the family of Jesus Apodaca, an undocumented immigrant child in a Denver high school.

Tancredo criticized the Denver Public Library system for purchasing reading materials written in Spanish and for offering space for classes to be held for these library users, on the grounds that putting Spanish-speakers in a &#x27;linguistic ghetto&#x27; would delay their integration into American society.

Tancredo sponsored legislation to eliminate H-1B visas for temporary workers in 2005.

Tancredo was the sponsor of a successful, bi-partisan amendment to a Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill that would withhold federal emergency services funds from &#x27;sanctuary cities&#x27;.

On July 30, 2007, Tancredo &quot;criticized Congressional Democrats for eliminating a requirement that anyone applying for Medicaid and State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) services provide proof of U.S. citizenship&quot;. According to Tancredo, &quot;[t]he new Democrat plan would raise taxes and make it easier for illegal aliens to obtain taxpayer-funded medical benefits.&quot;

Tancredo has made it a point in all of his public speeches to differentiate between those who enter the United States legally and those who come illegally. He frequently attends naturalization ceremonies to support new citizens for &quot;doing it the right way&quot;.

In 2006, Tancredo published &quot;In Mortal Danger: The Battle for America&#x27;s Border and Security&quot; through Joseph Farah&#x27;s WND Books in Nashville, Tennessee. The volume focuses on American cultural identity and his proposals to remedy what he contends to be major flaws in the immigration system.

Tancredo&#x27;s has staunchly supported tightening immigration requirements from Islamic countries. On September 18, 2008, Tancredo introduced H.R. 6975, the Jihad Prevention Act, which would require aliens to attest that they will not advocate installing a Sharia law system in the United States as a condition for admission, and for other purposes. Aliens failing to make such an attestation would be ineligible for admission. Further, the visa of any alien advocating the installation of a Sharia law system in the United States would be subject to revocation.

In May 2011, Tancredo represented the affirmative with Kris Kobach in a radio-broadcast debate of the motion &quot;Don&#x27;t give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses.&quot; The two debated Mayor Julian Castro of San Antonio and Tamar Jacoby of ImmigrationWorks USA. Tancredo and Kobach were declared the victors based on before and after polling of the live in-attendance audience mostly by convincing much of the self-identified undecided audience members of the strength of the motion.
:Pre-Debate Poll Results: 16% For | 54% Against | 30% undecided
:Post Debate Poll Results: 35% For | 52% Against | 13% undecided

Tancredo&#x27;s anti-illegal immigration stance became a campaign issue during the 2011 Denver mayoral campaign, which Tancredo did not enter. The Chris Romer campaign tried to erode rival Michael Hancock&#x27;s support among Hispanics by emails and robocalls claiming that Tancredo had endorsed Hancock. Tancredo, who had neither met nor endorsed Hancock, responded by appearing on a radio talk show and endorsing Romer.

===Federalism===
He was one of 33 congressmen to vote against the renewal of the Voting Rights Act because he asserted that its requirement of multilingual ballots would result in a costly unfunded mandate. He was one of a handful of Republicans who voted for an amendment proposed by Maurice Hinchey and Dana Rohrabacher to stop the Department of Justice from raiding medical marijuana patients and caregivers in states where medical marijuana is legal, citing states&#x27; rights concerns.

On the other hand, Tancredo supports Federal action in what he considers its proper sphere. He has suggested state legislators and &#x27;sanctuary city&#x27; mayors should be imprisoned for passing laws contrary to federal immigration law. He also supports the Federal Marriage Amendment to ban gay marriage nationally, and defended this position by stating a constitutional amendment is the &quot;last resort&quot; to neutralize judicial activism that would legalize gay marriage in courts, against the wishes of voters. The amendment would also use Constitutional means to prevent voters and legislators from legalizing gay marriage in their states.

===Fiscal policy===
The National Taxpayers Union awarded Tancredo a grade of A for each year he has served in Congress. Tancredo was awarded a grade of A for votes he cast in 1999 to 2007 inclusively. Additionally, Tancredo received the National Taxpayers Union&#x27;s &quot;Taxpayers&#x27; Friend Award&quot; in 1999 to 2006 inclusively as well
 The award is given by the NTU to those members of Congress that are among &quot;the strongest supporters of responsible tax and spending policies&quot;. He is also a strong supporter of the FairTax and advocates the repeal of the 16th Amendment. He is also against raising minimum wage.

=== Foreign policy ===
Tancredo&#x27;s position on Iraq is, &quot;America&#x27;s noble sacrifice has purchased Iraqis a precious opportunity for democratic change; it is now up to them to ensure success. Setting the President&#x27;s &#x27;November benchmark for shifting control&#x27; as an actual timetable for disengagement will let regional powers and Iraqi factions cooperate to forge a new balance of power.&quot; Fellow Republican state treasurer Mike Coffman refused to share the stage with Tancredo at a pro-war rally for the Iraq war in 2003 because of Tancredo&#x27;s failure to serve in the Vietnam War. In 1970 Tancredo appealed his 1-A draft status, which would have put him at the top of the list for draft eligibility during the Vietnam War. Tancredo said he was diagnosed with depression when he was 16 or 17 and received medication for five years for panic attacks and bouts of anxiety and depression.

During a 2005 radio interview on Orlando talk-radio station WFLA AM 540, Tancredo responded to a questioner asking about the hypothetical U.S. response to a nuclear attack on U.S. cities by al-Qaeda, by saying that one possible response would be to retaliate by &quot;taking out&quot; Muslim holy sites (specifically, Mecca) if it were clearly proven that Islamic terrorists were behind such an attack. Several days later, in an interview on CNN together with James Zogby, Tancredo said that the attack was mentioned merely as a hypothetical response and insisted that there was nothing for which he should apologize.

During the Republican Presidential Debate broadcast on Fox on May 15, 2007, Tancredo made a statement in passing that the root cause of Islamic terrorism is &quot;a dictate of their religion&quot;. In September 2007 Tancredo defended his remarks: &quot;I still believe it is something we must consider as a possible deterrent because at the present time there are no negative consequences that would accrue to the people who commit a crime such as a nuclear, chemical or biological attack.&quot;

During a July 31, 2007 townhall meeting in Iowa, Tancredo said that a threat to bomb Mecca and Medina was &quot;the only thing I can think of&quot; that could deter a nuclear terrorist attack. This statement drew substantial criticism from the Council on American-Islamic Relations, as well as State Department spokesman Tom Casey, who stated that &quot;To somehow suggest that an appropriate response to terrorism would be to attack sites that are holy and sacred to more than a billion people throughout the world is just absolutely crazy.&quot;

=== Sonia Sotomayor nomination ===
Tancredo became one of the outspoken conservative opponents to the nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. On May 28, 2009, he made an appearance on CNN to voice his opposition and claimed that Sotomayor was a racist. When CNN&#x27;s Rick Sanchez asked him if Sotomayor was a racist, Tancredo replied &quot;certainly her words would indicate that that is the truth.&quot; He then compared the Hispanic-American advocacy group La Raza to the Ku Klux Klan by saying &quot;it&#x27;s a Latino KKK without the hoods or the nooses.&quot;

=== Voting rights ===
On February 4, 2010, Tancredo spoke at the National Convention for the Tea Party movement where he told attendees that Barack Obama won because of &quot;people who could not even spell the word &#x27;vote&#x27; or say it in English&quot;. He then proposed &quot;a civics literacy test&quot; as a prerequisite to voting. These remarks were criticized by the Democratic Colorado House Speaker Terrance Carroll and the Southern Poverty Law Center&#x27;s research director Heidi Beirich. Tancredo has denied the charge that his remarks were aimed at a specific group.

On April 14, 2009, a speech by Tancredo at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was disrupted by students protesting his views on immigration in which he called for a civics literacy test before voting.

=== Marijuana legalization ===
Tancredo has declared himself in favor of the legalization of marijuana. He said that his reasons to legalize marijuana include &quot;The issue of violence that surrounds it—not just on the border—and the crimes all over the place. The number of people in prison and the amount we spend to keep them there. The broken families.&quot; While in Congress, Tancredo voted each year to attach an amendment, which never passed, that would have prevented the US Justice Department from spending any money to &quot;enforce any drug laws in contradiction to state law.&quot;

=== Federal Marriage Amendment ===
Tancredo said in September 2007, &quot;You have to remember that we are always just one kooky judge away from actually having homosexual marriage forced on all the rest of us, because of the [full faith and credit] clause in the U.S. Constitution. Therefore, we need, we absolutely have to have, a constitutional amendment that defines marriage.&quot; He is in full support of the Federal Marriage Amendment. Due to his numerous stances opposing the gay rights movement, he has received ratings of 7% from the American Civil Liberties Union, 0% from the Human Rights Campaign, and 19% from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. As of 2007, however, Tancredo boasted a 97.8% rating from the American Conservative Union.

=== Barack Obama ===
In a speech given at a campaign event for Colorado Senate candidate Ken Buck on July 8, 2010, Tancredo said of President Barack Obama, &quot;... the greatest threat to the United States today, the greatest threat to our liberty, the greatest threat to the Constitution of the United States, the greatest threat to our way of life; everything we believe in. The greatest threat to the country that our founding fathers put together is the man that&#x27;s sitting in the White House today.&quot;

In April 2010, while not addressing directly widespread &quot;birther&quot; sentiment in the Republican Party, Tancredo said at a South Carolina Tea Party rally about the president: &quot;If his wife says Kenya is his homeland, why don&#x27;t we just send him back?&quot; On July 22, 2010, in an editorial in &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, Tancredo said that Congress should bring impeachment charges against President Obama. In February 2012, Tancredo said on &quot;Hardball with Chris Matthews&quot;, in a discussion of candidate Mitt Romney&#x27;s economic policy alternatives to the president: &quot;Hell, my dog&#x27;s better at it than Obama!&quot;

==Controversy==
===Conflict with party leadership===
Tancredo&#x27;s outspoken advocacy for immigration reform, and particularly his criticism of President George W. Bush&#x27;s border security controls, reportedly made him &quot;persona non grata&quot; in the Bush White House. According to Tancredo, he and Bush&#x27;s political adviser, Karl Rove, got into a &quot;screaming match&quot; after Tancredo claimed that &quot;if the nation suffered another attack at the hands of terrorists able to skirt immigration laws, the blood of the people killed&quot; would be on Bush&#x27;s and Congress&#x27; hands. Rove responded by calling Tancredo &quot;a traitor to the party&quot; and &quot;a traitor to the president,&quot; and warned him to never &quot;darken the doorstep of the White House.&quot;

In an interview, Tancredo said his falling out with the White House has lasted. &quot;One reason I am &quot;persona non grata&quot; at the White House is not just because of immigration... but because I refuse to support him on his trade policy, his education policy, Medicare and prescription drugs initiatives... Here was a Republican Congress increasing government to an extent larger than it had been increased since Medicare had come into existence.&quot; Tancredo reported that his career in Congress was threatened by the leadership because of his stances. &quot;I was called into Tom DeLay&#x27;s office because I was supporting Republican challengers to Republican incumbents. I had a group called Team America that went out and did that. He called me and said to me, &#x27;You&#x27;re jeopardizing your career in this place by doing these things.&#x27; And I said, &#x27;Tom, out of all the things you can threaten me with that is the least effective because I do not look at this place as a career.&#x27;&quot;

===Illegal employees of contractor===
In 2002, &quot;The Denver Post&quot; reported that two illegal immigrants were among the crew hired to remodel his basement. Tancredo said he could not have known their immigration status—they were subcontractors hired by the contractors he hired.
The contractor, Denver Audio Design, denied hiring illegal immigrants and the Denver Post refused to identify the two they said came to them with the claim that they worked on Tancredo&#x27;s basement remodeling.

===Americans Have Had Enough Coalition speech===
On September 11, 2006, in Columbia, South Carolina, Tancredo spoke to a gathering of the &quot;Americans Have Had Enough Coalition&quot;, which he had helped found. The League of the South also invited its own members to attend the event. The room at the South Carolina State Museum in which Tancredo spoke had a prominent picture of Robert E. Lee and was draped with Confederate battle flags. At the closing of the event, men dressed in Confederate military uniforms reportedly began to sing &quot;Dixie&quot;. Several days later, Tancredo came under heavy criticism from a group of Denver ministers for attending the function. In his defense, Tancredo said, &quot;I gave it [the same speech] in probably five or six different venues, this was just one, all of them were open to the public. I don&#x27;t check people at the door for their private thoughts.&quot;

===City of Miami===
In a November 19, 2006 interview with WorldNetDaily, Tancredo referred to the city of Miami, Florida, as a &quot;Third World country.&quot; His comments drew strong criticism from numerous political leaders and organizations, including Florida Governor Jeb Bush who, in a letter to the congressman, called Tancredo&#x27;s remarks &quot;naive.&quot; Tancredo replied in a letter, &quot;I certainly understand and appreciate your need and desire to try and create the illusion of Miami as a multiethnic &#x27;All American&#x27; city,&quot; he said. &quot;I can also appreciate ... that the cultural and ethnic diversity of the city offers many advantages to its residents. However, it is neither naïve nor insulting to call attention to a real problem that cannot be easily dismissed through politically correct happy talk.&quot;

On December 12, 2006, Tancredo was announced by the Rotary Club of Miami as its guest speaker. The next day, the event was canceled by the restaurant. News reports said, &quot;The manager of the restaurant where Tancredo was to speak, the Rusty Pelican on Key Biscayne, said Wednesday that the owners didn&#x27;t want him to appear on Thursday in order to keep up the integrity and reputation of the business. The manager also said staff members objected to working the party where his immigration talk was supposed to be held, some customers threatened to boycott the restaurant, and the restaurant had received bomb threats.&quot; Tancredo spokesman Carlos Espinosa said &quot;What is more &#x27;Third World country&#x27; than threatening to bomb the place?&quot; Tancredo referred to Miami as having been taken over by &quot;thugs&quot; and &quot;separatists&quot; and declared that &quot;I knew speaking your mind could be dangerous in Havana—I guess it&#x27;s equally dangerous to do so in Miami. Apparently, there isn&#x27;t much of a difference between the two anymore.&quot;

===Michigan State University speech===
In another incident, student protests against a Tancredo speech scheduled to be given at the Michigan State University College of Law on November 30, 2006, turned violent. Protesters tried to block Tancredo&#x27;s speech and police were called when protesters pulled a fire alarm prior to the speech on immigration policy. Michigan State University College Republicans and Young Americans for Freedom sponsored the event. According to Tancredo, one of the student backers of the speech &quot;was spit on, one was kicked, and one was punched&quot;. Protesters interrupted the speech with loud shouting. Tancredo said protesters organized on the Internet social networking site Facebook and &quot;declared ahead of time on Facebook that they would not allow me to speak&quot;.

===Catholic Church===
On April 17, 2008, Tancredo alleged that Pope Benedict XVI was encouraging illegal immigration to the US to boost membership in the Catholic Church. In response to a statement by the Pope at a Mass in Washington, Tancredo stated, &quot;I suspect the Pope&#x27;s immigration comments may have less to do with spreading the gospel than they do about recruiting new members of the church.&quot; While Tancredo was raised a Catholic, he now attends Cherry Hills Community Church, a congregation in the Evangelical Presbyterian Church.

===People&#x27;s Mujahedin Organization of Iran===
Tancredo has stated that he would like to see the United States give more support to the Iranian exile organization People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran (PMOI). The PMOI was designated as a terrorist organization by the United States State Department from 1997 to 2012. Tancredo states that this was done &quot;for political reasons&quot; by the Clinton administration. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton removed the designation of &quot;terrorist organization&quot; when no proof of terrorist activity or intent could be produced.

==Private life==
A former Catholic, Tancredo now attends Cherry Hills Community Church. Tancredo is married to Jackie Tancredo. They met at Drake Junior High School as teachers, and married in 1977. They have two children and five grandchildren.

On February 3, 2009, &quot;The Denver Post&quot; revealed that Tancredo had probably lost a significant amount of money invested in hedge funds with Agile Group, a Boulder-based investment company with substantial investments in Bernie Madoff&#x27;s investment firm.

<text>Robert Louis Beauprez (; born September 22, 1948) is an American politician and member of the Republican Party from the state of Colorado.

Beauprez is a Colorado native and graduate of the University of Colorado Boulder. He worked as a dairy farmer and community banker before serving as chairman of the Colorado Republican Party from 1999 to 2002. He was then elected to represent Colorado&#x27;s 7th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives, and served from 2003 to 2007. He gave up his seat to run for Governor of Colorado in the 2006 election but lost to Democratic nominee Bill Ritter. He was the Republican nominee for governor again in the 2014 election, losing to incumbent Democratic Governor John Hickenlooper. Beauprez is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

==Early life==
Beauprez was born in Lafayette, Colorado. He grew up on his family&#x27;s dairy farm, which had been purchased by his grandparents, outside of Boulder, Colorado. He is the son of Marie (née Stengel) and Joseph C. Beauprez. His paternal grandparents had emigrated from Belgium to Colorado and raised draft horses on the family&#x27;s land. His mother&#x27;s family was of German descent. His parents raised both Hereford and dairy cattle on the farm. Beauprez often cites his father&#x27;s example as a major influence on his life. Like his father and the majority of blue collar Catholics in the area he originally registered as a Democrat before switching parties in the 1970s. He attributes this to his frustration with prominent Colorado Democrats at that time.

Beauprez attended Fairview High School where he played football and was named all-conference offensive tackle. He went on to study physical education at the University of Colorado, and received his B.S. in 1970.

==Republican Party chairmanship==
While Beauprez had been involved in the Republican Party for some time, his first leadership role came in 1997 as the chairman of the Boulder County Republican Party.

In 1999, with the backing of Senator Wayne Allard, Beauprez became chairman of the Colorado Republican Party. His tenure as state party chairman was marked by an aggressive attempts to use redistricting to get more Republican candidates elected in Colorado. The Republican Party lost control of the Colorado State Senate for the first time in four decades while Beauprez was chairman.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
In 2002, Beauprez ran to represent Colorado&#x27;s 7th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives, regarded as a &quot;swing&quot; district. In beating Democrat Mike Feeley by only 121 votes he won the closest race in the nation. As a freshman, Beauprez served on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, the Veterans Affairs Committee, and the Small Business Committee. He was re-elected in 2004 and subsequently obtained a position on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee.

==2006 Colorado gubernatorial election==

Beauprez won the Republican Party nomination for governor in August 2006, running to succeed two-term governor Bill Owens, who was ineligible for a third consecutive term. Beauprez ended up winning the nomination uncontested; he was briefly opposed by Marc Holtzman, who dropped out of the race and endorsed Beauprez several months before the primary.

===Military service controversy===

On February 2, 2006, veterans called on Beauprez to apologize for appearing at a photo-op in a military-issued uniform, even though he had never served in the military. He had requested and received three draft deferments and then a medical release during the Vietnam War. In May 2006, ProgressNow, a liberal advocacy group, produced an Internet-based ad that again focused on Beauprez&#x27;s draft status during Vietnam. The Beauprez campaign dismissed the ad as done by a &quot;well-financed attack machine.&quot;

===NCIC database===
In October, Beauprez started running ads that attacked Ritter&#x27;s performance as Denver district attorney, citing a plea-bargained case against illegal immigrant and alleged heroin dealer Carlos Estrada Medina. Under the plea bargain, the dealer was given probation. Later, he was arrested in California, under an alias, on suspicion of sexual abuse on a child. But the fact that that information couldn&#x27;t be verified in public court records prompted inquiries to Beauprez&#x27;s campaign as to where it got its facts. Beauprez&#x27;s campaign manager, John Marshall told a local news station, &quot;In federal criminal databases, the guy&#x27;s information matches up.&quot; That comment set off alarms in Ritter&#x27;s campaign because federal criminal databases are off-limits to anyone but law enforcement and can be used only for law enforcement purposes.

As the subsequent arrest was under an alias, Ritter&#x27;s supporters argued that the information could only have been obtained by accessing the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database, which access is restricted by federal law. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation initiated an investigation, and found enough evidence to then ask FBI to join its probe.

Beauprez denied anything improper had occurred, and that he had never heard of the NCIC database. The &quot;Denver Post&quot; noted that, as a Congressman, Beauprez had cosponsored a bill relating to the database. When charges were brought against the ICE agent who provided the information to John Marshall, he was acquitted in a jury trial.

===Criticism and praise regarding Cory Voorhis===
Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Senior Special Agent Cory Voorhis was prosecuted for retrieving Medina&#x27;s rap sheet from the NCIC database and sharing it with Beauprez&#x27; staff. Beauprez defended the action as &quot;whistleblowing,&quot; citing a pattern of lenient plea bargains during Ritter&#x27;s term as district attorney. Many questioned why a Denver District Attorney employee, who accessed the same information and shared it with the Ritter campaign, was not also prosecuted. Voorhis was found not guilty on April 9, 2008. One of the jurors in the case said the jury didn&#x27;t think Voorhis had &quot;done anything intentionally wrong&quot; and there were &quot;some feelings&quot; that Voorhis had been unfairly &quot;singled out&quot; for prosecution.

During the investigation, Beauprez received criticism for appearing to be unsupportive of Voorhis. But following Voorhis&#x27; acquittal, it became public that Beauprez did offer assistance to Voorhis, which was turned down by Voorhis&#x27; attorneys in order to avoid the appearance of a partisan political relationship. In an open letter to Beauprez, Voorhis wrote &quot;You are indeed an honorable gentleman, and a great American.&quot; At least one media figure, Peter Boyles, apologized to Beauprez and retracted his criticism.

==2014 Colorado gubernatorial election==
In March 2014, Beauprez announced that he would seek the Republican nomination for governor to challenge incumbent Democratic Governor John Hickenlooper. Beauprez did not contest the Republican state assembly on April 12, instead petitioning his way onto the ballot.

The primary election was held on June 24 and Beauprez triumphed with a plurality, taking 116,333 votes (30.24%) to Tom Tancredo&#x27;s 102,830 (26.73%), Scott Gessler&#x27;s 89,213 (23.19%) and Mike Kopp&#x27;s 76,373 (19.85%).

On 1 July, Beauprez announced Douglas County Commissioner Jill Repella as his running mate.

On July 3, video footage surfaced of Beauprez speaking in 2010, where he made remarks similar to those made by Mitt Romney in 2012. Speaking to the Denver Rotary Club, said Beauprez:

Democrats responded that Beauprez, who was in the middle of a &quot;Unity Tour&quot; with his running mate and former primary opponents, had a &quot;funny way&quot; of showing unity with Coloradans and called him &quot;out of touch&quot; and &quot;elitist&quot; for &quot;[accusing] half of the population of being freeloaders.&quot; Beauprez&#x27;s campaign stood behind the comments and said that &quot;in full context, [he&#x27;s] saying that it&#x27;s sad more people are not doing well enough to pay federal income tax.&quot;

In August, Beauprez said that he would send Colorado Army National Guard troops to the Mexico border: &quot;If Rick Perry or another governor requested it, I would certainly step up and do my part.&quot; Beauprez was criticised as doing so would be against the law. He later clarified his comments, saying that he meant he would send them on a humanitarian effort, not a military one.

On November 5, Beauprez officially conceded to Hickenlooper.

==2016 election activity==
In the 2015-2016 election cycle, Beauprez founded Colorado Pioneer Action, which sponsored a number of communications (including websites and mailers) promoting and supporting certain candidates for (primarily state legislative) office and opposing others. In late June 2016, a watchdog organization (Campaign Integrity Watchdog) filed a campaign finance complaint alleging that Beauprez&#x27;s Colorado Pioneer Action organization was in reality an unregistered political committee operating in violation of Colorado campaign finance disclosure laws. After nearly a year of pre-trial motions, including multiple attempts by Beauprez to have the complaint dismissed, the case went to trial at the end of March 2017.

Colorado Pioneer Action was found to have committed multiple violations of Colorado campaign finance law, fined $17,735 and ordered to register and disclose its contributors. Beauprez and Colorado Pioneer Action appealed the ruling to the Colorado Court of Appeals, where a decision is pending.

== Treasurer for the American Conservative Union ==
Beauprez served as the treasurer for the American Conservative Union, the organization that hosts the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. He abruptly resigned his position on May 25, 2023, citing lack of transparency in the compensation given to the organization&#x27;s president Matt Schlapp.

==Personal life==
Beauprez is married and has four children and six grandchildren.

<text>Rinkeby () is a district in the Rinkeby-Kista borough, Stockholm, Sweden. Rinkeby had 19,349 inhabitants in 2016. The neighbourhood was part of the Million Programme.

The Stockholm metro station Rinkeby was also opened in 1975.

Rinkeby is noted for its high concentration of immigrants and people with immigrant ancestry. 89.1% of the suburb&#x27;s population had a first- or second-generation immigrant background as of 2007.

A sociolect called Rinkeby Swedish has been named after Rinkeby. It is said to have seen use throughout the suburbs of Stockholm as well as across Sweden, with its development attributed to youth populations in multi-ethnic areas of major cities such as Rinkeby.

The district was a part of the Rinkeby borough until 1 January 2007, when it was merged with Kista borough to form the Rinkeby-Kista borough.

In the years preceding 2008, the state Social Insurance Agency, state Public Employment Service, banks and postal services vacated their offices in the area.

In 2010, the official figures stated 15,000 people lived in the area, but officials admitted 17,000 were more likely though uncertainties meant the figure could be higher still. Of those, 90% had a migration background and 37.6% were from Africa. With the area being home to a large number of immigrants, many from Somalia, the area is sometimes called &#x27;Little Mogadishu&#x27;.

In its December 2014 report, Swedish Police placed it as most severe category of urban areas with high crime rates.

==Demographics==
Rinkeby is inhabited by a diverse array of immigrants. As of 2011, most were from Iraq (3,155), Iran (2,909), Somalia (2,878), Turkey (1,819), Finland (1,090), Ethiopia (1,026), Eritrea (914), former Yugoslavia (796), Greece (768), Poland (757), Chile (711), Syria (631), China (589), Pakistan (456), India (414), Bangladesh (414), Morocco (344) and Lebanon (289).

In the 2011-13 period, about 53% of the population originated outside the EU and the Nordic countries.

==Social unrest==

According to the Swedish Defence University, since the 1970s, a number of residents of Rinkeby and other local areas have been implicated in providing logistical and financial support to or joining various foreign-based transnational militant groups. Among these organizations are Hezbollah, Hamas, the PKK, the GIA, the Abu Nidal Organization, the Japanese Red Army, the Red Army Faction, Al-Qaeda, the Islamic State, Al-Shabaab, Ansar al-Sunna, Ansar al-Islam, and the Serb Volunteer Guard.

In June 2010, and again in 2014, the Rinkeby police station was attacked by rioting local youths; in 2014, it was shut down.

In 2016, an Australian news team from &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, along with Jan Sjunnesson, an editor of the Swedish far-right publication &quot;Avpixlat&quot; (who have since changed their name to Samhällsnytt), had their camera man allegedly hit by a car when they arrived in Rinkeby. After making contact with inhabitants, the team were surrounded by young, aggressive men. The police were present nearby, but had opted not to make their presence known, for fear of antagonising locals. In the attack that followed, the crew were hit and kicked. In May of the same year, an interview team of the Norwegian public broadcaster NRK, along with Swedish police and economist Tino Sanandaji were attacked.

Riots also broke out among immigrant youths in Rinkeby in 2010, 2013 and 2017. In 2017, fires were started by rioters, and at least seven cars were burned. Rioters threw rocks at police, who responded with warning shots, and later with &quot;shots for effect&quot; intended to hit their target.

In 2017, the construction of a new, more robust police station in the area was delayed, due to construction companies being unwilling to tender for the contract due to security concerns over attacks on equipment or threats towards employees. Owing to the threat level, and that people in the area were resisting the building of a police station, the construction site was given security guards. In August 2018, the construction site for the new police station was attacked by unidentified assailants. They used a car to force the gate and threw rocks and fireworks at security guards. The assailants then set the vehicle afire.

<doc id="410151" wikidata="Q333828" url="?curid=410151" title="Paul Murphy, Baron Murphy of Torfaen">
<text>Paul Peter Murphy, Baron Murphy of Torfaen, (born 25 November 1948) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Torfaen from 1987 to 2015, and served in the Cabinet from 1999 to 2005 and again from 2008 to 2009 in the roles of Northern Irish and Welsh Secretary. He was nominated for a life peerage in the 2015 Dissolution Honours.

==Background==
Paul Peter Murphy was born to Ronald and Marjorie (née Gough) Murphy. He has a younger brother, Neil. Murphy&#x27;s father, Ronald, was a miner of Irish descent. The family was devoutly Catholic. His mother, Marjorie (née Gough), was English, and her family were businesspeople.

Paul Murphy attended St Francis Roman Catholic School, Abersychan and West Monmouth School, Pontypool. He later attended Oriel College, Oxford to study history. He was a management trainee with the CWS, before becoming a lecturer in Government and History at Ebbw Vale College of Further Education, now part of Coleg Gwent. He has never married. Murphy once said in an interview &quot;I have so many books, there&#x27;s only enough room for me&quot;.

==Early political career==
Murphy joined the Labour Party at age 15, and is a member of the Transport and General Workers Union. He was Secretary of the Pontypool/Torfaen Constituency Labour Party from 1971 to 1987. He was a member of Torfaen Council from 1973 to 1987 and was chair of its finance committee from 1976 to 1986. He contested Wells constituency in Somerset in the 1979 general election.

==Senior Cabinet posts==
He was MP for Torfaen, Wales from the 1987 election. In opposition he served as a foreign affairs spokesperson and then in Defence as navy spokesperson.

Following the 1997 election Murphy was appointed to the position of Minister of State for Northern Ireland.

He joined the cabinet in July 1999 following his appointment as Secretary of State for Wales on 28 July 1999. In 2002 he moved departments and became Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, a role in which he served until his dismissal in the reshuffle that followed the 2005 general election, when he became chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee. He also served as the British chair of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body and an executive committee member of the British-American Parliamentary Group.

Following the resignation of Peter Hain from the cabinet on 24 January 2008, he was again appointed Secretary of State for Wales he was also given the job of chairing a new Cabinet Committee on the sensitive issue of IT and information security, in the wake of a rash of scandals surrounding the loss of personal data by Government agencies. In April 2008 he was appointed as the Government&#x27;s Minister for Digital Inclusion. Prior to joining the Cabinet he was Minister of State for political development in the Northern Ireland Office from 1997 to 1999 – acting as Mo Mowlam&#x27;s deputy – and was largely responsible for negotiating the so-called strand two (&#x27;North-South&#x27; or &#x27;Island of Ireland&#x27;) arrangements agreed in the Good Friday Agreement.

He left the cabinet in 2009 when he was replaced as Welsh Secretary by Peter Hain following the clearance of accusations against Hain of election donations.

In 2013, Murphy wrote a report on the lack of success of applicants to Oxbridge universities from Welsh state schools. The report suggested the creation of the Seren Network, a set of regional hubs to link schools to top universities.

==Voting record==
In 1979 Murphy was a fierce opponent of devolution. Murphy recently said &quot;I have been trying to work out whether or not I am a devo-sceptic and I have come to the conclusion that I am not. In 1978, I was a devo-opponent, and in 1997 I voted for devolution. My constituents agreed with me in 1978, but they did not agree with me in 1997, because they voted against a Welsh Assembly on both occasions. However, I would rather describe myself as a devo-realist, in the sense that what is here is here. I am not all that keen on a coalition in Cardiff, but we are where we are, and we have to work in the current political climate for the benefit of the people whom we represent, whether we are members of parliament, Assembly Members or members of local authorities&quot;.

In a free parliamentary vote on 20 May 2008, Murphy voted for cutting the upper limit for abortions from 24 to 12 weeks, along with two other Catholic cabinet ministers Ruth Kelly and Des Browne.

In February 2013, Murphy voted against the second reading of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013. Subsequently, in May 2013 the MP voted against the bill&#x27;s third and final reading, opposing the legalisation of same-sex marriage within England and Wales.

==Parliamentary expenses==
Murphy was subject to criticism over his expenses claims, revealed by the Daily Telegraph during the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal. Most notable of these was his £3,419.25 claim to have a new boiler installed in his Westminster house, stating that the previous one was a hazard as &quot;The hot water was far too hot&quot;.

Other claims submitted by Paul Murphy relate to purchases of a toilet roll holder, new carpeting and a television, as well as mortgage payments and stamp duty. Murphy was ordered to repay some of the money improperly &quot;claimed back&quot; in the amount of £2,237.72 in cleaning costs, mortgage payments and a wardrobe that exceeded the guideline price.

==Personal life==
Murphy was created a life peer taking the title Baron Murphy of Torfaen, of Abersychan in the County of Gwent on 20 October 2015.

He is a member of the Oxford and Cambridge Club.

<text>Andrew David Smith (born 1 February 1951) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Oxford East from 1987 until 2017. He served in the Cabinet as Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 1999 to 2002 and then as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions from 2002 to 2004.

Smith retired from the House of Commons at the 2017 general election.

==Early life==
Smith was educated at Reading School and St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he gained a BA and BPhil. He was the Member Relations Officer for Oxford and Swindon Co-op Society from 1979 to 1987. He became an Oxford city councillor in 1976, leaving the council in 1987. He contested Oxford East in 1983.

==Parliamentary career==
Smith was the Member of Parliament for Oxford East, which he won in 1987, defeating Conservative MP Steven Norris. After Labour won government in the 1997 general election he was made a minister in the Department for Education and Employment. He was Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 1999 to 2002, when he became Secretary of State for Work and Pensions; he resigned from this post on 6 September 2004, to spend more time with his family. He won re-election in his Oxford East seat in the 2005 General Election, but saw his majority slashed by 90%.

Smith is best remembered by some for his opposing of the privatisation of air traffic control in 1996 stating &quot;Our air is not for sale&quot; only for Labour to switch policies and thereby propose a public–private partnership for the National Air Traffic Services. Others point to his stewardship of the Department for Work and Pensions and his focus on reducing child poverty when minister there.

Smith was the chair and one of the founding members of the International Parliamentarians for West Papua, launched in October 2008.

Smith occasionally rebelled against his party in Parliament, on issues such as a third runway at Heathrow, the Government&#x27;s renewal of Trident, and notably backed opposition Liberal Democrats motions on votes concerning the rights of Gurkhas to remain in Britain and the introduction of single transferable vote for elections.

In 2005 the Liberal Democrats came within 963 votes of winning the seat, with the drop in support for Labour widely attributed to the Iraq War, but in 2010 Smith secured a comfortable victory with a 4.1% swing to Labour, bucking the national trend. Similarly, in 2015, he was re-elected with 50% of the vote, an increase of 7.5% over 2010.

In the 2010 Labour leadership election, Smith supported Ed Balls. In the 2015 Labour leadership election, with minutes to spare before the deadline for nominees ended, he nominated Jeremy Corbyn despite not actually supporting Corbyn. Smith nominated Corbyn because he wanted a &quot;broad debate&quot; about the direction of the Labour Party. Smith was the 35th Labour MP to nominate Corbyn, which gave Corbyn the minimum number of votes he needed to appear on the ballot.

Smith supported Owen Smith&#x27;s unsuccessful candidacy in the 2016 Labour leadership election after the Parliamentary Labour Party declared non-confidence in Corbyn&#x27;s leadership.

On 19 April 2017, Smith announced that he would not seek re-election in the 2017 general election.

==Personal life==
Smith was married to Valerie Miles, a former Lord Mayor of Oxford, county councillor on Oxfordshire County Council and city councillor on Oxford City Council from 26 March 1976 until her death in 2015. They had a son, Luke. Smith lives in the southeast Oxford council estate of Blackbird Leys.

<doc id="410156" wikidata="Q333318" url="?curid=410156" title="Ian McCartney">
<text>Sir Ian McCartney (born 25 April 1951) is a British Labour Party politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Makerfield from 1987 to 2010. McCartney served in Tony Blair&#x27;s Cabinet from 2003 until 2007, when Gordon Brown became Prime Minister. He was made a Knight Bachelor in the 2010 Dissolution Honours List.

==Early life==
He was born in Lennoxtown, Stirlingshire, to future Labour MP for East Dunbartonshire Hugh McCartney and his wife, Margaret, a trade unionist. McCartney had two sisters, Irene and Margaret.

Educated at Lenzie Academy, he left the school at the age of 15 &quot;under a bit of a cloud&quot; without any qualifications. He led a paper-boys&#x27; strike at the age of fifteen, and had a number of jobs after leaving school, including a seaman, a local government manual worker, and a kitchen worker. He was a councillor for Abram ward in Wigan from 1982 to 1987.

==Parliamentary career==
McCartney became the MP for Makerfield following the 1987 general election. He was one of the founders of the All-Party Parliamentary Rugby League Group the same year, and was its first chairman. He held a number of positions during Labour&#x27;s period in opposition, and was variously a spokesman on Health, Employment, Education and Social Services. In 1994, he ran John Prescott&#x27;s successful campaign to become Labour&#x27;s Deputy Leader. McCartney was one of the shortest MPs, standing five feet, one inch tall. He described himself on his parliamentary notepaper as the &quot;Socialist MP for Makerfield&quot;.

On 23 May 2009, McCartney announced he would not stand again at the 2010 general election due to poor health.

===Ministerial career===
McCartney was made Minister of State for Competitiveness at the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) following the 1997 general election when Labour came to power. While at the DTI, he steered the Competition Act 1998 through the House of Commons and introduced a major package of new employment rights which included whistleblowing protection, the National Minimum Wage and the first-ever right to paid holidays. As a former low-paid worker who had been sacked upon asking for a pound pay rise after having a child, McCartney later described the minimum wage as very important to him, saying that he would have &quot;died in the ditch&quot; for it. During this time he was also responsible for employment relations, the Post Office, Company Law and inward investment.

He was moved to be Minister of State at the Cabinet Office in 1999, where he was responsible for modernising Government and E-Government. During this year his drug addict son Hugh McCartney died of a heroin overdose in a Glasgow tenement block. In 2001, McCartney became Minister of State for Pensions at the Department for Work and Pensions, and he was promoted to the Cabinet as Minister Without Portfolio and Party Chairman in April 2003.

Between October 2004 and October 2005, he was Chairman of the Labour Party in two capacities – as the Party Chair (appointed by the party&#x27;s leader) with a seat in the Cabinet, and as the Chair of the National Executive Committee (elected by the members of the NEC). He was also chair of the party&#x27;s National Policy Forum, which formulates Labour party policy. The NPF also oversaw the &#x27;Big Conversation&#x27; project, which saw the Labour Government try to consult the general public on the future direction of party and government policy. Trusted by both leadership and membership, he was seen as a key link between the Government and the wider Labour movement.

He worked to make the role of Party Chair a voice for Labour Party members within the Labour Government. As architect of the Warwick Agreement by Labour&#x27;s National Policy Forum, he was a key figure in co-ordinating the election manifesto for Labour&#x27;s third term general election campaign. In 2006 he took a three-month leave of absence following heart bypass surgery, and publicly told of his fight to lose weight for the sake of his health. His return to frontline politics was marked by his speech to the Labour Party 2006 Spring Conference in Blackpool in which he shed a tear while celebrating 100 years of the Parliamentary Labour Party. He returned to government as Minister of State for Trade in May 2006, attending Cabinet but not voting there, but stepped down in 2007 when Gordon Brown became Prime Minister.

Beginning in October 2007, McCartney worked with the construction, engineering and nuclear energy company Fluor, providing them with advice in anti-corruption and business ethics policies; political, economic, environmental and regulatory issues; and outside relations including working with trade unions. After details of this position were published in &quot;The Independent&quot;, McCartney stated unequivocally that he personally received none of the remuneration for this role, instead using part of the fee to employ someone in the House of Commons from his Makerfield constituency. The remainder was used to support the Women&#x27;s Interlink Foundation, a charity based in India which rescues street children and disadvantaged women who are exposed to poverty and sometimes at the risk of rape and murder, providing them with clean drinking water, health treatments, housing and education.

In August 2008, after admitting that some of his claims for furnishing his second home were &quot;inappropriate&quot;, McCartney repaid £15,000 of expenses claimed for among other items, a dining table, 18-piece dinner set and champagne glasses. McCartney had asked for the review; although only a portion of the amount was deemed excessive, he said he felt strongly that the full amount should be returned. He commented that as a senior minister he held meetings at home and &quot;had to feed guests&quot;.

In May 2009, after stepping down citing health issues, McCartney said his family had urged him to step down following a further bout of illness after his 2005 heart surgery, and that he was also being treated for disc injury and was possibly facing further surgery.

==After Parliament==
McCartney was chair of Healthwatch Wigan, resigning from the post in 2016.

==Personal life==
He was married firstly to Jean (&quot;née&quot; Murray), with whom he had son Hugh and daughters Yvonne and Karen, later divorcing. Hugh died aged 23 of a drugs overdose in 1999 in his flat in Parkhead.

Hugh, known as &quot;Shug&quot;, had battled drug addiction since his teenage years. Only recently released from prison, he had been trying to break his habit. In 2002, McCartney gave an interview to the &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; discussing his son&#x27;s experiences in the justice system and how McCartney believed &quot;the way we deal with addicts sentenced his son to death&quot;. In 2003, McCartney stated in an interview he was still having break downs over the death of his only son.

McCartney&#x27;s second and current wife is Ann Kevan Parkes, whom he married in 1988.

<text>David Adam Smith (born June 15, 1965) is an American politician and retired attorney serving as the U.S. representative for . A member of the Democratic Party, Smith previously served in the Washington State Senate.

A graduate of the University of Washington School of Law, Smith briefly worked as a prosecutor and &quot;pro tem&quot; judge for the city of Seattle before entering politics. Smith was elected to the State Senate in 1990; at age 25, he was the youngest state senator in the country. He ran in and won his first congressional race in 1996, and has been reelected 11 times. Since 2019, he has chaired the House Armed Services Committee. Smith is a member of the New Democrat Coalition and the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He is the dean of Washington&#x27;s House delegation.

==Early life and education==
Born in Washington, D.C. and raised in SeaTac, Washington, Smith was adopted as an infant by Lelia June (née Grant) and his maternal uncle Ben Martin Smith III. He attended Bow Lake Elementary and Chinook Middle School before graduating from Tyee High School in 1983. In high school, Smith participated in the Close Up Washington civic education program. His father, who worked for United Airlines as a ramp serviceman and was active in the Machinists&#x27; Union, died when Smith was 19.

Smith attended Western Washington University in Bellingham for a year before graduating from Fordham University in 1987 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science. He completed a Juris Doctor from the University of Washington in 1990. He worked his way through college by loading trucks for United Parcel Service.

==Early career==
After law school, Smith worked as a private practice attorney with Cromwell, Mendoza &amp; Belur. From 1993 to 1995, he served as a prosecutor for Seattle. In 1996, he worked temporarily as a &quot;pro tem&quot; judge.

Smith served in the Washington State Senate from 1991 to 1997. He was 25 years old at the time of his election in 1990, defeating a 13-year incumbent Republican, Eleanor Lee, to become the nation&#x27;s youngest state senator.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
Smith won his seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1996 by defeating another incumbent Republican, Randy Tate.

In 2006, Smith won his sixth term in Congress against Republican Steve Cofchin, with 65.7% of the vote to Cofchin&#x27;s 34.3%.

In 2008, Smith won a seventh term in the House, defeating James Postma, a 74-year-old retired engineer running on a pro-nuclear power platform, with 65% of the vote.

For his first seven terms, Smith represented a district that straddled Interstate 5, from Renton through Tacoma to just outside of Olympia. Smith&#x27;s district was significantly redrawn after the 2010 census. It absorbed much of southeast Seattle as well as most of the Eastside. As a result, it became the state&#x27;s first with a majority of residents who are racial or ethnic minorities. It is also the state&#x27;s second-most Democratic district; only the neighboring 7th district, which covers the rest of Seattle, is more Democratic.

===Tenure===
Smith has been a long-time member in moderate &quot;New Democrats&quot; organizations and once chaired its political action committee.
In April 2007, Smith supported Barack Obama in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. He also appeared on &quot;Hardball with Chris Matthews&quot; speaking for Obama. The same year, he also appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, in the show&#x27;s 434-part series known as &quot;Better Know A District&quot;.

On July 8, 2024, Smith called for Joe Biden to withdraw from the 2024 United States presidential election. Smith voted with President Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 100% of the time in the 117th Congress, according to a &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; analysis.

===Foreign affairs===

On October 10, 2002, Smith was among the 81 Democratic members of the House to vote to authorize the invasion of Iraq. In March 2012, he said that U.S. troops had done &quot;amazing work&quot; in Afghanistan and that it was &quot;time to bring the troops home&quot;.

Smith voted against the Protect America Act of 2007, which has been criticized for violating Americans&#x27; civil liberties by allowing wiretapping without issued warrants. But in 2008, he voted for a similar bill, the FISA Amendment Act of 2008 (FAA), reauthorizing many of the provisions in the expired Protect America Act, leading critics like the ACLU to call it &quot;an unconstitutional bill that would significantly modify the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act&quot;, granting expansive new monitoring powers to the executive branch with very little court oversight. The FAA also ensured the dismissal of all pending cases against telecommunication companies for their previous illegal spying on American citizens on behalf of the Executive Branch. Smith also voted for the 2001 Patriot Act and to extend the Bush administration&#x27;s warrantless wiretapping program.
On December 16, 2010, Smith defeated Silvestre Reyes and Loretta Sanchez to become the Ranking Member of the House Armed Services Committee after Chairman Ike Skelton was defeated for reelection. In the first round, Sanchez and Smith earned 64 votes, and Reyes earned 53. In the runoff, Smith defeated Sanchez by 11 votes.

In 2011, recognized for his work in fighting global poverty, Smith became only the second member of Congress selected for the Borgen Project&#x27;s board of directors. The same year, he argued against cuts that could &quot;jeopardize our national security&quot; and leave the U.S. &quot;more vulnerable to nuclear terrorism&quot;.

In 2001, Congress passed the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), which gave the president authority to use &quot;all necessary and appropriate force&quot; against those who committed and aided the September 11 attacks. While this power has been rarely used to detain persons in the U.S., Smith introduced a bill to ensure that anyone detained on U.S. soil under the AUMF has access to due process and the federal court system. The bill also prohibits military commissions and indefinite detention for people detained in the U.S. and would ensure the detainees constitutional rights.

Smith and Representative Mac Thornberry co-sponsored an amendment to the fiscal 2013 defense spending bill reversing previous bans on disseminating Defense and State Department propaganda in the U.S., reversing the Smith–Mundt Act of 1948 and the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1987, designed to protect U.S. audiences from government misinformation campaigns. The bill passed on May 18, 2012, 299 to 120.

Smith, concerned about the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan, tried to contact Joe Biden in advance, without success; however, he did get a call from Biden after he criticised the disastrous Afghanistan escape —the only one he got from Biden in four years.

===Domestic affairs===
In December 2023, Smith introduced the End Hedge Fund Control of American Homes Act of 2023 to the House. This legislation would require hedge funds to sell at least 10% of the single-family homes they own yearly over 10 years. After this period, hedge funds will be banned from owning single-family homes.

<text>André-Gustave Citroën (; 5 February 1878 – 3 July 1935) was a French industrialist and the founder of French automaker Citroën. He is also remembered for his application of double helical gears.

==Life and career==
Born in Paris in 1878, André-Gustave Citroen was the fifth and last child of Jewish parents, diamond merchant Levie Citroen and Masza Amelia Kleinman. He was a cousin of the British philosopher Sir A. J. Ayer (the only son of his aunt Reine).

The Citroen family descended from a grandfather in the Netherlands who had been a greengrocer and seller of tropical fruit, and had taken the surname of , Dutch for &quot;lime man&quot;; his son however changed it to (), which in Dutch means &quot;lemon&quot;. In 1873 the family moved to Paris; upon arrival, the French was added to the surname (reputedly by one of André&#x27;s teachers), changing to .

His father died by suicide when André was six years old (presumably after failure in a business venture in a diamond mine in South Africa). It is reputed that the young André Citroën was inspired by the works of Jules Verne and had seen the construction of the Eiffel Tower for the World Exhibition, making him want to become an engineer.

Citroën was a graduate of the in 1900. In that year he visited Poland, the birthland of his mother, who had recently died. During that holiday, he saw a carpenter working on a set of gears with a &quot;fish bone&quot; structure. These gears were less noisy, and more efficient.

Citroën bought the patent for very little money, leading to the invention that is credited to Citroën: double helical gears. Their distinctive pattern was reputed to be the inspiration for the marque of the Citroën brand. In 1908, he was installed as a chairman for the automotive company Mors, where he was very successful.

During World War I, he was responsible for mass production of armaments. Citroën gained an international reputation during the war, and more as the leading production expert in France. His activities were extensive in connection with the Renault plant, which employed 35,000 men in the manufacture of munitions during the war.

In the middle of 1919, Citroën was one of the directors of the Société Française Doble, Paris, to build steam cars in France. Some other directors of the company were Paul Sicault, of the Renault Co.; M. Mery, of the Turcat-Mery Co.; M. Delage, the automobile designer. The design was not feasible and Citroën turned to other projects.

Citroën founded the Citroën automobile company in 1919, leading it to become the fourth largest automobile manufacturer in the world by the beginning of the 1930s (specifically 1932). The costs of developing the advanced front wheel drive unibody Traction Avant and redeveloping the factory to produce it at the same time, led to bankruptcy in 1934. It was taken over by the main creditor Michelin, who had provided tires for the cars. The Traction Avant after initial problems improved the sales for the company, and was a great success and was in production apart from during World War II until 1957.

He died in Paris, France, of stomach cancer in 1935, and was interred in the Montparnasse Cemetery, the funeral being led by the Chief Rabbi of Paris.

==Posthumous recognition==
On 9 October 1958, while the Motor show was running, the city fathers renamed the Quai de Javel as the &quot;Quai André Citroën,&quot; in recognition of the transformation effected since the city&#x27;s 15th arrondissement, two generations earlier characterized by market gardening, had been selected by Citroën as the location for Europe&#x27;s first mass production car plant.

This was the second celebrity name for the street which in 1843 had been baptised &quot;Quai de Javel,&quot; in recognition of the chemical factory that had been set up to produce a range of industrial acids, and which later numbered the well known eponymous &quot;Eau de Javel&quot; (bleach) among its products.

In 1992, the Parc André Citroën public garden in Paris was named after him. It was built on the site of the former automobile manufacturing plant of Citroën, which operated until its closure in the 1970s, and which had been demolished during an eight-year period, between 1976 and 1984. In 1998, André-Citroën was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in Dearborn, Michigan.
