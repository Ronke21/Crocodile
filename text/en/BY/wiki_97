<text>Morgan Valentine Spurlock (November 7, 1970 – May 23, 2024) was an American documentary filmmaker, writer, and television producer. He directed 23 films and was the producer of nearly 70 films throughout his career. Spurlock received acclaim for directing the documentary &quot;Super Size Me&quot; (2004), which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature Film. He produced &quot;What Would Jesus Buy?&quot; (2007) and directed &quot;Where in the World Is Osama bin Laden?&quot; (2008), &quot;POM Wonderful Presents: The Greatest Movie Ever Sold&quot; (2011), &quot;Comic-Con Episode IV: A Fan&#x27;s Hope&quot; (2011), and &quot;One Direction: This Is Us&quot; (2013).

Spurlock was executive producer and star of the reality television series &quot;30 Days&quot; (2005–2008). In June 2013, he became the producer and host of the CNN show &quot;Morgan Spurlock Inside Man&quot; (2013–2016). Spurlock was also the co-founder of the short-film content marketing company Cinelan, which produced the Focus Forward campaign for GE.

The documentary &quot;Super Size Me 2: Holy Chicken!&quot; was set to be released in 2017, until Spurlock wrote a social media post saying that he had a history of sexual misconduct and referring to himself as &quot;part of the problem&quot;, leading to a distribution drop and his resignation from the production company. The film was instead distributed in 2019 by Samuel Goldwyn Films. In 2024, Spurlock died at age 53 due to complications related to cancer.

== Early life ==
Morgan Valentine Spurlock was born on November 7, 1970, in Parkersburg, West Virginia, and was raised in Beckley, West Virginia. His parents, Ben and Phyllis Spurlock, raised him as a Methodist. Phyllis was an English teacher and guidance counselor while Ben owned an auto repair shop. Spurlock said he was of Scots-Irish and English descent. He would later state that he was sexually abused as a child.

Spurlock graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in Beckley, West Virginia, then attended New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts, graduating with a BFA in film in 1993. He was a member of the fraternity Phi Gamma Delta.

== Career ==

Spurlock was a playwright, winning awards for his play &quot;The Phoenix&quot; at both the New York International Fringe Festival in 1999 and the Route 66 American Playwriting Competition in 2000. In 2004, Spurlock co-founded the production studio Warrior Poets which would be the production studio for the films he directed and produced for the rest of his career.

The list of documentary films that inspired Spurlock includes &quot;Brother&#x27;s Keeper&quot;, &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot;, &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot;, &quot;Roger and Me&quot;, &quot;Harlan County, USA&quot;, and &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;. He considered &quot;Brother&#x27;s Keeper&quot; the greatest documentary of all time.

===&quot;Super Size Me&quot;===
Spurlock&#x27;s documentary &quot;Super Size Me&quot; was released in the U.S. on May 7, 2004. He conceived the idea for the film when he was at his parents&#x27; house for Thanksgiving, and while watching TV saw a news story about a lawsuit brought against McDonald&#x27;s by two teenage girls who blamed the fast food chain for their obesity. The film was produced for $65,000 and made $22 million in return.

The film depicts an experiment Spurlock conducted in 2003, in which he claimed he ate three McDonald&#x27;s meals every day (and nothing else) for 30 days, although he later disclosed he also drank copious amounts of alcohol. The film&#x27;s title derives from one of the rules of Spurlock&#x27;s experiment: he would not refuse the &quot;super-size&quot; option whenever it was offered to him but would never ask for it himself. The result, according to Spurlock, was a diet with twice the calories recommended by the USDA. Further, Spurlock attempted to curtail his physical activity to better match the exercise habits of the average American; he previously walked about a day, whereas the average American walks .

Over the course of filming, Spurlock gained 25 pounds (11 kg), became quite puffy, and suffered liver dysfunction and depression by the end. His supervising physicians noted the effects caused by his high-calorie diet—once even comparing it to a case of severe binge alcoholism. Following Spurlock&#x27;s December 2017 assertion that he had not been &quot;sober for more than a week&quot; in three decades, the claims of his liver dysfunction being caused by eating McDonald&#x27;s food solely for 30 days have been called into question. Spurlock also did not publicly release a diet log documenting his diet while filming the documentary.

After completing the project, it took Spurlock 14 months to return to his normal weight of 185 pounds (84 kg). His then-girlfriend (and later wife), Alexandra Jamieson, took charge of his recovery with her &quot;detox diet&quot;, which became the basis for her book, &quot;The Great American Detox Diet&quot;. &quot;Super Size Me&quot; was later nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature and Spurlock won the first Writers Guild of America Award for Best Documentary Screenplay. Spurlock wrote a book in 2005 as a follow-up to &quot;Super Size Me&quot; entitled &quot;Don&#x27;t Eat This Book: Fast Food and the Supersizing of America&quot;.

=== &quot;30 Days&quot; ===
In each episode, a person (sometimes Spurlock himself) or a group of people spend 30 days immersing themselves in a mode of life markedly different from their norm (being in prison, a devout Christian living in a Muslim family, a homophobe staying with a homosexual person, etc.), while Spurlock discusses the relevant social issues involved. The series ran on FX between 2005 and 2008. In the second-season finale, Spurlock spent 25 days locked in a Henrico County, Virginia (a county outside of Richmond), jail to experience life as an inmate. The third season of &quot;30 Days&quot; premiered on June 3, 2008. The first episode of the third season, titled &quot;Working in a Coal Mine&quot;, was filmed in Bolt, West Virginia, which is located roughly from the city of Beckley, West Virginia, where Spurlock was raised before leaving for New York. In 2008, he signed a deal with Fox Television Studios.

=== &quot;I Bet You Will&quot; ===
Spurlock also created &quot;I Bet You Will&quot; for MTV. &quot;I Bet You Will&quot; began as a popular Internet webcast of five-minute episodes featuring ordinary people doing stunts in exchange for money. Examples of the scenarios which transpired include eating a full jar of mayonnaise (US$235), eating a &quot;worm burrito&quot; (US$265), and taking shots of corn oil, Pepto-Bismol, lemon juice, hot sauce, cold chicken broth, and cod liver oil (US$450.00 for all nine shots). MTV later bought the show and aired it, which Spurlock hosted.

===Subsequent films===
Spurlock&#x27;s second feature documentary, &quot;Where in the World Is Osama Bin Laden?&quot; premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2008. In the film and during interviews, Spurlock explored the fight against terrorism and views the argument from both sides, in which he tries to find Osama bin Laden.

Spurlock directed &quot;The Simpsons 20th Anniversary Special – In 3-D! On Ice!&quot;.

&quot;Freakonomics&quot; is an adaptation of the book of the same name by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2010 and had a theatrical release later that year. Spurlock was at the helm of this project alongside five directors (Heidi Ewing, Rachel Grady, Alex Gibney, Seth Gordon, and Eugene Jarecki). Spurlock&#x27;s segment dealt with people with unusual names.

The one-hour documentary &quot;Committed: The Toronto International Film Festival&quot; premiered on AMC on October 12, 2010.

&quot;The Greatest Movie Ever Sold&quot; is a 2011 documentary film about product placement, marketing, and advertising which was reportedly itself financed through product placement. &quot;The Greatest Movie Ever Sold&quot; premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2011. In the United States, the film had a limited release, opening on April 22, 2011, in New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Washington D.C., Boston, Philadelphia, San Diego, Phoenix, and Austin, Texas. Six days later, the film opened the 2011 Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival.

In mid-2010, Spurlock worked with &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; creator Joss Whedon, Ain&#x27;t It Cool News founder Harry Knowles, and comic book creator Stan Lee to create the documentary &quot;Comic-Con Episode IV: A Fan&#x27;s Hope&quot;, to cover the stories of convention fans. Whedon, Lee, and Knowles served as executive producers. Legendary Pictures&#x27; Thomas Tull, who independently financed the documentary, told &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;We look forward to capturing the spirit, energy and people that Comic-Con has infused into legions of fans, bringing these audiences and projects out of the halls and onto a world stage.&quot;

Spurlock&#x27;s documentary &quot;Mansome&quot; was announced on March 8, 2012, as a Spotlight selection for the Tribeca Film Festival. The film takes a comedic look at male identity as defined through men&#x27;s grooming habits featuring celebrity and expert commentary.

Spurlock hosted and produced the CNN series &quot;Morgan Spurlock Inside Man&quot;, which aired from June 2013 to August 2016.

Spurlock helped distribute &quot;A Brony Tale&quot;, a documentary directed by Brent Hodge on the brony phenomenon and on the musician and voice acting career of Ashleigh Ball. The film was selected for theatrical distribution under the label Morgan Spurlock Presents. The film was released in theaters on July 8, 2014.

Spurlock teamed up with Hodgee Films again on the 2015 web series &quot;Consider the Source&quot;, in association with Disney&#x27;s Maker Studios.

While attending a screening of the movie &quot;Catfish&quot;, Spurlock approached the film&#x27;s producers afterwards and called &quot;Catfish&quot; &quot;the best fake documentary&quot; he had ever seen.

=== Other work ===

* Spurlock presented &quot;50 Documentaries to See Before You Die&quot; on Current TV. The show premiered on August 1, 2011.

=== Sexual misconduct and resignation ===
In December 2017, Spurlock wrote a blog post admitting to what he described as a history of sexual misconduct. In the midst of the #MeToo movement, Spurlock stated: &quot;I&#x27;ve come to understand after months of these revelations, that I am not some innocent bystander, I am also a part of the problem.&quot; In the post, he said that he committed sexual misconduct in his past, including being &quot;unfaithful to every wife and girlfriend [he] ever had&quot;. Spurlock recounts settling a sexual harassment allegation, brought by his assistant at his production company, Warrior Poets, for verbal harassment including yelling for her as &quot;hot pants&quot; or &quot;sex pants&quot; from across the office.

In the same post, Spurlock also recounted that he had been accused of sexual assault while in college. Spurlock wrote that while still &quot;in college, a girl who I hooked up with on a one night stand accused me of rape. Not outright. There were no charges or investigations, but she wrote about the instance in a short story writing class and called me by name.&quot; He wrote: &quot;This wasn&#x27;t how I remembered it at all [...] She believed she was raped. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m part of the problem.&quot; Spurlock said both he and the woman had been heavily drinking the night of the incident, and that during sex she had begun crying, and they had stopped.

After publishing his blog post, Spurlock stepped down from his position with Warrior Poets, the company he had co-founded in 2004. The move ended his career as a documentary filmmaker. Spurlock told the &quot;Associated Press&quot; in 2019: &quot;For me, there was a moment of kind of realization—as somebody who is a truth-teller and somebody who has made it a point of trying to do what&#x27;s right—of recognizing that I could do better in my own life. We should be able to admit we were wrong.&quot; Additionally, he told &quot;Deadline&quot;: &quot;Part of the reason I wrote that essay in the first place was to be on the right side of it. I&#x27;m hopeful that in time, with the work that I do and the changes that I continue to go through, that I can be there on the right side.&quot;

In the blog post, Spurlock further disclosed that he had been the victim of sexual abuse as a boy and teenager, and that he had &quot;consistently been drinking since the age of 13.&quot;

Spurlock released a sequel film, &quot;Super Size Me 2: Holy Chicken!&quot;, in 2017, to be distributed by YouTube Red, but it was dropped following Spurlock&#x27;s admission of sexual misconduct. Samuel Goldwyn Films instead distributed the film in September 2019. In October 2022, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Spurlock had &quot;suffered career death&quot; as a result of his misconduct.

==Personal life==
Spurlock&#x27;s marriages to Priscilla Sommer, Alexandra Jamieson, and Sara Bernstein all ended in divorce. He had two children.

Spurlock was raised Methodist. He stated in an interview with &quot;TV Guide&quot; in 2014 that he was agnostic.

==Death==
On May 23, 2024, Spurlock died from complications of cancer at the age of 53 in upstate New York.

<doc id="723303" wikidata="Q388796" url="?curid=723303" title="Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)">
<text>Sub-Zero is a fictional character in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. A warrior from the fictional Lin Kuei clan, he possesses ability to control ice in many forms. He is the only fighter to appear in every main installment of the series, along with the action-adventure spin-off &quot;Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero&quot; (1997).

In the games, the mantle of Sub-Zero is used by brothers Bi-Han () and Kuai Liang (). Bi-Han debuted as Sub-Zero in the original 1992 game before appearing in subsequent installments as Noob Saibot. Kuai Liang took over the mantle in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; (1993) and served as the franchise&#x27;s main Sub-Zero up to &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; (2019). In &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; (2023), Bi-Han returns as Sub-Zero, while Kuai Liang becomes Scorpion.

One of the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; franchise&#x27;s signature characters, Sub-Zero has appeared in various related media outside of the games. He has received acclaim for his appearance, abilities, and Fatality finishing moves.

==Character creation==
Sub-Zero was first conceived by &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; co-creator John Tobias as a mysterious character named simply &quot;Ninja&quot; and inspired by the book &quot;China&#x27;s Ninja Connection&quot; by Li Hsing, which &quot;posits historical evidence for the existence of the Lin Kuei and their influence on the Japanese ninja. I was aware of there being some controversy about the author’s claims. So when we split the character in two for palette swaps, I thought it would be fitting that one was of Chinese origin and the other Japanese to kind of embody the argument.&quot; According to Tobias, the original &quot;Hunter&amp;Hunted concept was going [to be] about a ninja escaping from his clan and hunted by another member. We used that later for SZ in &quot;MK3&quot;.&quot; Sub-Zero&#x27;s early name was Tundra.

In his early appearances, Sub-Zero was primarily portrayed and voiced by non-Asian actors. Midway Games later explained Sub-Zero&#x27;s rather occidental appearance for a Chinese assassin by giving him a white mother. According to this new backstory, his father had a wife, two sons, and a daughter while he lived in America to hide his personal role as an assassin for the Lin Kuei. Midway Games programmer Josh Tsui portrayed the unmasked Sub-Zero (Kuai Liang) in the character&#x27;s &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; ending.
===Designs===
Sub-Zero&#x27;s early costumes have been very simple due to technical limitations. &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; co-creator Ed Boon noted that Kuai Liang&#x27;s counterpart from DC Comics is Batman as both are &quot;dark, mysterious, brooding characters&quot;. Since &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot;, Sub-Zero has had a scar running down from his forehead and across his right eye as a mark of death. The scar was originally red, and later changed to blue in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot; as a result of Sub-Zero&#x27;s enhanced powers. Tobias said that Sub-Zero was unmasked in &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; in order to stir up fan speculation about the character&#x27;s backstory. The new Sub-Zero made his official debut on the cover of &quot;GamePro&quot; April 1995 issue, with Turk&#x27;s red outfit tinted blue (as it was for the game), but the photo used was a reversed negative, as his scar was over his left eye. 

&quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; and &quot;Deadly Alliance&quot; states that Sub-Zero is 6 feet 2 inches tall; in recent games such as &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;, his sprite appears to be similar to most characters. In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot;, his scar has faded to the point where it can no longer be seen. He now wore an armored uniform heavily inspired by Dynastic era Chinese battle armor, though it was often criticized by fans as being too reminiscent of &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; villain, the Shredder. However, Sub-Zero&#x27;s alternate uniform was very reminiscent of Chinese culture, even featuring Sub-Zero without a cowl and a Qing dynasty-era hairstyle. In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot;, Sub-Zero reverts to his masked costume from &quot;Deadly Alliance&quot;, retaining the scar, which is not part of his alternate costume (which is the primary one from &quot;Deception&quot;). Since &quot;Deadly Alliance&quot;, Sub-Zero is the only character who has shown considerable signs of aging. Concept art from &quot;Deadly Alliance&quot; depicted him with a graying, receding hairline, and a more pale and gaunt face, while his scar was now blue and his forearms frozen over. Although Sub-Zero originally had blue eyes, they turned white after he obtained the Dragon Medallion in the game. Sub-Zero&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks&quot; was one of the most revised ones from the title. Character lead Mark Lappin did almost ten passes on his design; producer Shaun Himmerick noted that &quot;we went through literally 5-6 heads and styles of head costume on him&quot; and commented that Sub-Zero&#x27;s design in &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; was difficult to make although most people called it &quot;simple&quot;. In the end, the staff was satisfied with his final look in the game as it reminisces them to his classic outfit. His appearance in &quot;Injustice 2&quot; was redesigned by Jim Lee.

===Gameplay===
When he first appeared in the first &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, Sub-Zero featured only two special moves: his ice blast and sliding kick. These moves have become Sub-Zero&#x27;s trademark since then, being featured in every game that Sub-Zero has appeared in (&quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; and subsequent games feature a younger Sub-Zero whose identity is Kuai Liang). &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; added his ground freeze move, and two new Fatalities including the now-famous one where he would freeze and shatter the victim. According to Boon, Sub-Zero&#x27;s Freeze was originally omitted from the game in place of the Ice Shower, but was brought back in the next revision following fan feedback at a local arcade. Sub-Zero&#x27;s &quot;Predator&quot;-inspired Fatality, the &quot;Spine Rip,&quot; is considered by Boon to be his favorite Fatality from the first game as well as the most controversial. 

Some home versions of the first game replaced the &quot;Spine Rip&quot; with another finishing move due to its violent content, for instance the SNES port had a freeze and shatter finishing move due to Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;family friendly&quot; policies (this tame fatality received a positive reception so it was added to Sub-Zero&#x27;s arsenal in the sequels). Unlike other returning characters whose moves remained intact, the spine rip Fatality was not carried over to &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat 3,&quot; (an explanation is because Kuai Liang was heroic compared to his villainous brother Bi-Han). The Nintendo 64 port of &quot;Mortal Kombat Trilogy&quot; gives Sub-Zero&#x27;s special techniques and finishing moves to the classic masked version, due to the fact the N64&#x27;s cartridge format had memory restrictions that did not allow the use of both masked and unmasked characters. The developers had to remove the &quot;Spine Rip&quot; from &quot;Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe&quot; as that game was aimed at a younger audience. Sub-Zero also gained a teleporting move in the game in which he freezes himself and falls back to the ground, appearing behind the foe.

==Appearances==
===Main &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; games===
Sub-Zero&#x27;s first appears as a man later named Bi-Han as a playable character in &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (1992). A cryomancer and warrior of the Chinese Lin Kuei clan, he is sent to kill Shang Tsung, host of the eponymous Mortal Kombat tournament. However, Bi-Han is revealed to be killed by the specter Scorpion following the events of the game. From there, Kuai Liang takes the name of Sub-Zero in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; (1993) and tries to do Bi-Han&#x27;s mission In &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; (1995), Kuai Liang leaves the Lin Kuei after the clan begins converting their warriors into cyborgs. Kuai Liang is recruited by Earthrealm&#x27;s protector Raiden to defeat the tyrant Shao Kahn. Additionally, an alternate playable character called &quot;Classic Sub-Zero&quot; appears in &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot; (1995) and &quot;Mortal Kombat Trilogy&quot; (1996). Initially believed to be Bi-Han, he is an unidentified warrior who emerges to assassinate Shang Tsung.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; (1997), Raiden summons Kuai Liang to help him defend Earthrealm against the fallen Elder God Shinnok, encountering Scorpion again who instead turns against Quan-Chi after learning he killed his family. In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot; (2002), Kuai Liang becomes the new leader of the Lin Kuei, takes on an apprentice named Frost who tries to betray him. In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot; (2004), Kuai Liang joins forces with the warrior Shujinko, among others, to combat the Dragon King Onaga and finds his brother. In the story mode of &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot; (2006), Sub-Zero faces the warrior Taven who aids him with defeating Noob Saibot to heal him in the future.

Both Bi-Han and Kuai Liang appear in &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2011). Just like in the original timeline, Bi-Han is killed by Quan-Chi who becomes Noob Saibot, leading to Kuai Liang to become Sub-Zero. While attempting to avenge Bi-Han, Kuai Liang is converted into a cyborg, but joins Raiden&#x27;s side upon regaining his mind. Kuai Liang is killed by Shao&#x27;s queen Sindel and kept by Quan Chi as an undead revenant. The sequel &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; (2015), has Kuai Lang restored to life by Raiden, becoming the Lin Kuei&#x27;s new grandmaster to kill Quan Chi. In &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; (2019), Kuai Liang opposes the former Lin Kuei who side the keeper of time Kronika. He also joins Earthrealm&#x27;s warriors in assaulting Kronika&#x27;s keep.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; (2023), Fire God Liu Kang creates a new timeline, where Bi-Han becomes Sub-Zero once more while his brother is Scorpion. Both appear as playable characters while an unidentified Sub-Zero appears as an assist character, or &quot;Kameo Fighter&quot;. Liu Kang sends Bi-Han, Kuai Liang, and their adopted brother Smoke to investigate Shang Tsung. Shang Tsung sways Bi-Han to his side by promising him control of the undead Dragon Army. Kuai Liang and Smoke escape to help Liu Kang stop Shang Tsung before heading to Japan to found the Shirai Ryu clan and replace the Lin Kuei as Earthrealm&#x27;s protectors. In the &quot;Khaos Reigns&quot; DLC, Bi-Han leads the Lin Kuei in an attack on the Shirai Ryu to test Sektor&#x27;s powered suits, only to be captured. Bi-Han reluctantly joins forces with Liu Kang to stop him, but is converted into Noob Saibot. Regardless of alliance with Liu Kang, Bi-Han intends to resume his war against the God and the Shirai Ryu.

====Other games====
Sub-Zero&#x27;s first spin-off is &quot;Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero&quot; as Bi-Han embarks a quest to aid Quan Chi as a payment for Shirai Ryu&#x27;s demise but later steals his superior Shinnok&#x27;s amulet under Raiden&#x27;s guidance. In an alternate take on the game&#x27;s events depicted in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks&quot; (2005), in which Kuai Liang appears as a boss and unlockable player character, he briefly allies himself with protagonists Liu Kang and Kung Lao while searching for Bi-Han, who had been transformed into the undead Noob Saibot. Kuai Liang appears as a playable character in &quot;Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe&quot; (2008), and &quot;Mortal Kombat: Onslaught&quot; (2023). Furthermore, he appears as a guest character in &quot;NBA Jam Tournament Edition&quot; (1995), &quot;The Grid&quot; (2000), and &quot;MLB Slugfest: Loaded&quot; (2004) as well as a downloadable playable character in &quot;Injustice 2&quot; (2017). A cosmetic skin of Sub-Zero was added to &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot; as a bonus reward in the battle pass for Chapter 6, Season 2.

An unidentified Sub-Zero makes a cameo appearance in &quot;&quot; (2013) while a character inspired by Sub-Zero called Sub-273 appears as the final boss of &quot;Punch Club&quot; (2016).

However, he is defeated and killed by Hasashi and the latter&#x27;s descendant Cole Young before Shang Tsung claims Bi-Han&#x27;s body. Taslim was surprised by how violent was his character and his death, which convinced him to take the role. Additionally, he has stated that he found Sub-Zero &quot;cool and he&#x27;s just kickass&quot; and wanted to humanize him, wanting audiences to feel his pain and that he still has dilemmas. He felt the character became scary and lacked any sort of humanity in the final project.

The Kuai Liang incarnation of Sub-Zero appears in &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Battle of the Realms&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Snow Blind&quot;, voiced by Bayardo De Murguia in the former and Ron Yuan in the latter.

==Reception==

Merchandise items of the character include action figures, statues, and a joystick released along with &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot; for the PlayStation 2.

Deemed one of the most popular and recognizable characters in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; franchise, as well as in the fighting-genre as a whole, Sub-Zero is regarded as the franchise&#x27;s most iconic character along with Scorpion. He was given the award of the best fighter of 1997 by &quot;SuperGamePower&quot; (readers vote). A GamesRadar article from 2011 discussed his and Scorpion&#x27;s evolution across the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series, citing them as its two most popular characters. IGN&#x27;s Brian Altano and Ryan Clements chose him as the most iconic character of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; to represent the series against Jin Kazama of &quot;Tekken&quot; and Ryu of &quot;Street Fighter&quot;. Together, Scorpion and Sub-Zero were voted the fifth most iconic characters in the two decades of the PlayStation by readers of &quot;PlayStation Official Magazine – UK&quot; in 2015. TheGamer.com said both Sub-Zero and Scorpion were manipulated by Quan Chi to be enemies and &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; ends the feud when both fighters join forces to kill the sorcerer. However, criticized Sub-Zero&#x27;s characterization from &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; as he comes across as an obvious villain when interacting with the rest of the cast.

Several writers focused on his designs. UGO noted his ninja costume as the most iconic from the series. GamePlayBook praised his freeze attacks and &quot;Head Rip&quot; Fatality, His redesign in &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; was disliked by &quot;GamePro,&quot; which they deemed &quot;suspenders&quot; and compared his scar to a red smear. However, his appearance in &quot;Deadly Alliance&quot; received praise by Gaming Age&#x27;s Tim Lewinson noting that &quot;Sub-Zero never looked so good.&quot; According to GameSpot&#x27;s Jeff Gerstmann, the unlocking of the hidden character Classic Sub-Zero in &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot; was &quot;annoying&quot; to the point that players would not do it. BBC News mentioned Sub-Zero as a prominent example of &quot;Western ninja-inspired nonsense&quot; in popular culture. 

His ice-projectile technique has been noted by 1UP.com to be one of the best mechanics that changed video games due to how practical it is as it gives players the opportunity of making any move while the opponent is frozen. Prima Games listed the same move as the 23rd in fighting games due to how it paralyses enemies, allowing the player to attack the enemy.

&quot;Hype&quot;r&#x27;s John Dewhurst opined that what contributed to the failure of &quot;Mythologies Sub-Zero&quot; is that Sub-Zero&#x27;s character alone &quot;isn&#x27;t that interesting without Johnny Cage and Kitana to bounce off.&quot; GameDaily listed his appearance in &quot;Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero&quot; as one of his worst moments. On the other hand, IGN staff liked how Sub-Zero was given his own video game, noting him to be one of the series&#x27; most popular characters, and that &quot;it offers gamers a new look at Sub Zero.&quot; Den of Geek praised his role in &quot;Mythologies Sub-Zero&quot; whereas the second Sub-Zero was noted for many of his actions such as his rivalry with Batman, as well as his role in the series such as his relationship with the Lin Kuei. The rivalry between Sub-Zero and Batman in &quot;Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe&quot; was emphasized by IGN who noted that although both characters were extremely powerful, Sub-Zero&#x27;s freezing skills were more entertaining than Batman&#x27;s abilities.

When it comes to voice acting, critics also found Steve Blum as one of the best actors in the franchise for his take on Sub-Zero and wished he would return in future installments. On the other hand, Dimitri Vegas&#x27; performance as Sub-Zero in &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; was the subject of heavy criticism for sounding &quot;truly awful&quot; according to Eurogamer as they noticed the celebrity is more skilled as a dee jay rather than voice acting. Bleeding Cool noted fan response was negative too, to the point it was as bad as Ronda Rousey&#x27;s performance as Sonya Blade in the same game. Instead, they preferred Blum. 

When it comes portrayals outside gaming, &quot;The Escapist&quot; called the Scorpion and Sub-Zero-themed episode 7 &quot;one of the best episodes&quot; in the &quot;Legacy&quot; series, lending an emotional weight to the most famous tale in the franchise. On the other hand, Film School Rejects bemoaned the series&#x27; expectation that its viewers be knowledgeable about the franchise&#x27;s history, explaining that without previous knowledge of the games, the viewer is left with too many questions that may never be answered. Stephen Wilds of ComingSoon.net said that while it is a cliche that Sub-Zero is rude mentor to Kenshi, the fact that he is tired of fighting might divide the audience. Ron Yuan&#x27;s voice acting as Sub-Zero was praised by Comic Book Resources. Taslim&#x27;s portrayal of the character was praised by Los Angeles Times for his violent moves performed on several characters from the 2021 movie referring to him as &quot;a Takashi Miike remake of &quot;Frozen&quot;&quot;. Espinof agreed with both Sub-Zero&#x27;s handling and Scorpion so much they would like to have them explored more in a prequel. Discussing Film enjoyed how entertaining is Sub-Zero as a villain due to the action scenes he is involved. However, &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; was more critical to the character, claiming he lacked a personality in the film other than being one of Shang Tsung&#x27;s pawns.

<text>Indian Heaven is a volcanic field in Skamania County in the state of Washington, in the United States. Midway between Mount St. Helens and Mount Adams, the field dates from the Pleistocene to the early Holocene epoch. It trends north to south and is dominated by six small shield volcanoes; these shields are topped by small spatter and cinder cones, and the field includes a number of subglacial volcanoes and tuyas. The northernmost peak in the field is Sawtooth Mountain and the southernmost is Red Mountain; its highest point is Lemei Rock at an elevation of .

Indian Heaven features both polygenetic and monogenetic volcanic activity; many of its volcanoes have only erupted once before coming extinct, while others have erupted several times. Approximately 50 eruptive centers lie within the Indian Heaven field, which also has approximately 40 lava flows. The field&#x27;s eruptive output totals , with sporadic activity taking place for the past 700,000 years. The last volcanic activity in the field produced a large cinder cone, Big Lava Bed, as well as a voluminous lava and scoria flows about 9,000 years ago. Future activity is possible, though the Volcano Hazards Program directed by the United States Geological Survey considers Indian Heaven&#x27;s volcanic threat level to be low.

The volcanic field is surrounded by the Indian Heaven Wilderness, a protected wilderness area within the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, supporting diverse flora and fauna. The local area has been inhabited by Native American populations for about 10,000 years, and the name Indian Heaven derives from the indigenous name for the vicinity. A popular recreation destination, the wilderness offers a number of trails, as well as more than 150 lakes for fishing, swimming, and boating.

== Geography ==
Located in Skamania County in the state of Washington, Indian Heaven volcanic field is part of the High Cascades, an eastern segment of the Cascade Range, which trends north–south. Formed towards the end of the Pleistocene Epoch, these mountains are underlain by more ancient volcanoes that subsided due to parallel north–south faulting in the surrounding region. The Indian Heaven field lies east of Vancouver, Washington and to the north of the Columbia River.

The Indian Heaven volcanic field lies between Mount St. Helens and Mount Adams, about southwest of the latter. The Simcoe Mountains volcanic field is located to the east. To the southwest lies a diffuse volcanic belt of at least 22 volcanic centers, in length, that runs in a southeast-trending direction and includes Marble Mountain, Bare Mountain, West Crater, and Trout Creek Hill. The field has a diameter of , with a total area of . The tallest point within the field is the Lemei Rock shield volcano, which reaches an elevation of .

=== Wilderness ===
The Indian Heaven Wilderness, which encompasses an area of , lies within a forested high plateau region. It includes subalpine meadows, the volcanic field and a number of other volcanic features, more than 150 lakes, and forests. Created in 1984 by the Washington Wilderness Bill, it sits between Mount Adams and the Columbia River Gorge, a canyon of the Columbia River. Part of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, the wilderness area includes of the Pacific Crest Trail, which traverses it from north to south, as well as seven other tributary trails, that form a network of trails. The area is relatively inaccessible, as roads are covered by snow until June annually though snow melts by mid-July in most years, permitting visitors in the fall season.

== Ecology ==
The plateau that contains the Indian Heaven Wilderness features forests, which are predominantly made up of Pacific silver fir, noble fir, and subalpine fir trees, though there are also Western red cedars, mountain hemlock, grand firs, and Engelmann spruce. Other flora found in the vicinity include an understory of huckleberry plants and beargrass, in addition to colorful wildflowers; vine maples; flowering plants such as blueberry, heather, vanilla leaf, and false hellebore; and aromatic wintergreen. Many of the area&#x27;s lakes get stocked with trout species like cutthroat, rainbow, and brook trout. Amphibians such as frogs can be found in the wilderness, while terrestrial animals in the area include deer, elk, and American black bears. Because of the abundance of mosquitoes within the vicinity, Indian Heaven is sometimes informally referred to as Insect Heaven.

== Human history ==
Indian Heaven and the surrounding wilderness area have played an important role in local Native American life for about 10,000 years, and the vicinity was originally called &quot;Sahalee Tyee&quot; by native peoples, which loosely translates to Indian Heaven. The Sawtooth Berry Fields, known globally for their huckleberries, burned during the late 1890s and again in 1902. Later fires helped maintain the fields by drying their berries. From 1902 to the mid-1920s, local tribes including the Yakama, Klickitat, Wasco-Wishram, and Umatilla, as well as Native American groups from Montana and Wyoming gathered in the Indian Heaven area during the summers for annual huckleberry feasts. During these gatherings, they celebrated, traded, and performed rituals; they also raced horses, played various games, constructed baskets, dried meat, tanned hides, and fished in the local lakes. In 1932, the Yakama Nation and the United States Forest Service agreed to set aside a portion of the Berry Fields for exclusive Indian use; the harvest remains an important local tradition. Today, the marks from the Race Track, a meadow used by Native Americans for horse racing, can be seen about off the segment of the Pacific Crest Trail that crosses through the Indian Heaven wilderness. Trees within the area have scars from where their bark was peeled for wood to make baskets. The area is also rich with large game animals and supports a number of roots and tuber plant species.

== Geology ==
The area near the Indian Heaven vicinity is composed of Western Cascade rocks from the Eocene to Miocene including andesite, tuffs, mud flows, pyroclastic flow deposits, and other volcaniclastic materials, as well as High Cascade rocks that date from between the Pliocene and Holocene epochs. Strata of rock underlying the area has been deformed to create faults, fractures (separations in geologic formation), volcanic igneous intrusions, and a gradual, dipping syncline that trends north to south. The Indian Heaven field resides within the syncline&#x27;s trough, and it consists of High Cascade rocks, which are far less altered than the surrounding rock strata. Similar to other Cascade volcanoes, the Indian Heaven volcanoes were fed by magma chambers produced by the subduction of the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate under the western edge of the North American tectonic plate. The field may share a deep magma chamber with Mount St. Helens that seismic imaging showed lying between the two volcanoes below two smaller magma chambers, each located more directly under their respective volcanic area.

Indian Heaven consists of several, overlapping shield volcanoes that run along a line from Sawtooth Mountain at the north to Red Mountain to the south, as well as cinder cones, lava flows, and spatter cones (low, steep-sided hills or mounds that consist of welded lava fragments). With a total magma output of , the field has about 50 mafic eruptive edifices (rich in magnesium and iron), whose activity lasted from the Pleistocene to the early Holocene. Roughly half of these vents mark a mountainous highland, in length, which runs parallel to the north–south trend of the Cascade Arc in southern Washington state.

Most of the volcanoes that comprise the Indian Heaven field are monogenetic, only erupting once before becoming extinct. The rest are polygenetic shield volcanoes. About 80 percent of the lava erupted by Indian Heaven volcanoes consists of basalt; it represents the most voluminous Quaternary basalt produced by a volcanic field in the Cascade Arc north of Newberry Volcano in Oregon, with an eruptive output volume between . Basalt composition varies from low-potassium high-alumina olivine tholeiite to calc-alkaline, shoshonite, and alkaline intraplate compositions, though olivine-bearing basalt with different amounts of porphyritic plagioclase dominates. Volcanoes within the field have produced smaller amounts of basaltic andesite and andesite with silicon dioxide compositions up to 59 percent, though dacite is not very common among Indian Heaven eruptive products. Unlike Mount St. Helens, the Indian Heaven field has generated large volumes of basalt but has not caused extensive crustal melting. Most of the lava flows produced by the field have been pāhoehoe, featuring smaller percentages of block flows and ʻaʻā flows. They vary in thickness from , reaching volumes up to ; there are about 40 distinct lava flow groups in the field, totaling in area.

Indian Heaven has been significantly altered through glacial erosion, including at least four major periods of glaciation. During the Hayden Creek Glaciation from 190,000 to 130,000 years ago, the Lewis River glacier advanced from Mount Adams to fill the Lewis River canyon, partly overlapping the Indian Heaven volcanic field. An ice cap originating at the northern end of the field also spread during this glacial era. The Lone Butte tuya volcano erupted through this glacier, which had a thickness of .

== Eruptive history and potential hazards ==
One of Indian Heaven&#x27;s vents produced a large effusive eruption about 9,000 years ago, forming the Big Lava Bed, which consisted of basaltic lava. With an area of and a volume of , the Big Lava Bed mostly consists of unvegetated basalt. It moved to the south down the Little White Salmon River drainage, which it filled for of its length. Ultimately, the flow extended from its initial source vent, an unnamed cinder cone. It came within of the Columbia River. Another, more ancient lava flow that was especially fluid encompassed the Trout Lake area and extended several miles south, also nearing the Columbia River. Highly voluminous, it also features lava tubes. These lava tubes can be found at many of the lava flows that comprise the Indian Heaven volcanic field, which range from basaltic to andesitic in composition, and extend as far as from their source vents. The eruptive units from the field show normal residual magnetism, suggesting that they were all formed less than 780,000 years ago, with the exception of lava within Gifford Peak&#x27;s eroded core.

The volcanic field also features a number of Pleistocene subglacial volcanoes, many of which formed móbergs, flat-topped peaks generated by subglacial eruptions. These mountains, such as Crazy Hills, formed pillow-like shapes when their lava interacted with ice or meltwater. The field also has tuyas, such as Lone Buttle, which formed as flat and steep volcanic cones created by lava that erupted through glaciers or ice sheets. Lone Butte in particular erupted through a glacier in the Indian Heaven field, building its upper cone above water and generating pyroclastic materials, lava flows, and tephra to reach a height of above its base. However, Lone Butte has since undergone significant glacial erosion, losing about half of its original structure.

Activity at the volcanic field has occurred sporadically for the past 700,000 years. Therefore, it remains likely that volcanoes from the field will erupt in the future, generating voluminous lava flows. Nonetheless, the Volcano Hazards Program directed by the United States Geological Survey lists Indian Heaven&#x27;s volcanic threat level as &quot;Low/Very Low&quot;. To assess threats from possible lava flows at Indian Heaven or at nearby Mount Adams, geologists from the United States Geological Survey headed by W. E. Scott determined its mean burial rate in 1995, calculated as the lava volume erupted per unit time divided by the area of the lava field. They found that Indian Heaven&#x27;s average burial rate was low, but noted that Indian Heaven &quot;has had a large lava flow in the past 10,000 years.&quot; Estimating the probability of lava flows from Indian Heaven covering a certain point in the zone surrounding the field, the geologists arrived at a range between one in 100,000 to one in a million.

== Major vents ==
The Global Volcanism Program of the Smithsonian Institution lists a number of major vents at Indian Heaven, including the Big Lava Bed pyroclastic cone, produced by the most recent eruption in the field; the Bird Mountain, East Crater, Gifford Peak, Lemei Rock, Red Mountain, and Sawtooth Mountain shield volcanoes; and the Lone Butte tuya volcano. The Big Lava Bed pyroclastic cinder cone has a smooth slope, and produced the Big Lava Bed flow, which represents the newest eruptive activity within the entire Indian Heaven field. Red Mountain, which has an elevation of , marks the southernmost point of the shield volcanoes in the volcanic field, while Sawtooth Mountain is the northernmost volcano.

== Recreation ==
Within the Indian Heaven Wilderness, visitors can fish in lakes and ponds, hike, backpack, ride horses, and view wildlife.
A popular trail is the Indian Heaven loop, which runs for from the Cultus Creek campground. Following the Indian Heaven Trail to Deep Trail and then Lemei Lake Trail, it passes through meadows and lakes to join the Pacific Crest Trail before it returns to the Cultus Creek campground where it starts. After the climb from the final paved road to enter the wilderness area, which lasts about , hiking in Indian Heaven is relatively undemanding. However, trails can vary in difficulty for horseback riders and hikers.

The Lake Wapiki trail, in length, gains in elevation and provides scenic views of Mount Adams and Mount Rainier. The Blue Lake trail in the Indian Heaven wilderness area runs for ; together with the Lemei Lake Trail, it forms a loop that last . A moderate hike, it offers views of lakes, ponds, meadows, and forests, as well as access to popular fishing lakes like Dee Lake, Heather Lake, Thomas Lake, and Eunice Lake. These lakes are also popular swimming spots, particularly among hikers with children. Before it merges with the Pacific Crest Trail, the route arrives at the Blue Lake, which has a depth of and marks the deepest lake within the entire wilderness. Blue Lake was carved by glacial motion.

One of the most popular camping spots is the Goose Lake Campground, which is frequented by fishermen, boaters, and swimmers. Operated by the United States Forest Service, the campground remains open from July through October. A designated camp site near Thomas and Blue Lakes within the wilderness was created by wilderness managers for the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, with the hope that it would mitigate resource damage in high use area and focus visitor use impact to smaller, more compact areas.

<doc id="723308" wikidata="Q3285256" url="?curid=723308" title="Tiger-Heli">
<text>is a vertically scrolling shooter game developed by Toaplan and released for arcades in 1985. It was published in Japan by Taito and in North America by Romstar. Controlling the titular attack helicopter, the player must fight endless waves of military vehicles while avoiding collision with their projectiles and other obstacles. The Tiger-Heli has a powerful bomb at its disposal that can clear the screen of enemies when fired. It was the first shoot &#x27;em up game from Toaplan, and their third video game overall.

&quot;Tiger-Heli&quot; was the creation of video game composers Masahiro Yuge and Tatsuya Uemura, who had previously worked on several titles for Japanese companies Orca and Crux before both of them declared bankruptcy. The development team drew inspiration from the arcade game &quot;Gyrodine&quot;. The team wanted to create a scrolling shooter that balanced between being entertaining and fun, and to have players keep wanting to play it after dying. The staff chose a helicopter as the player&#x27;s craft as they felt it would work for a game that had the screen continuously scrolling. The soundtrack, composed by Uemura, was made to convey a sense of bravery, which was hampered by technical limitations.

&quot;Tiger-Heli&quot; was well received by critics for its gameplay, graphics and weapons, and helped establish Toaplan as a leading producer of shooting games throughout the 1980s and 1990s. It was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System by Micronics, selling over one million copies. A PlayStation version was released in 1996 by Banpresto as part of the compilation &quot;Toaplan Shooting Battle 1&quot;. It was followed by two sequels: &quot;Twin Cobra&quot; (1987), and &quot;Twin Cobra II&quot; (1995). The rights to &quot;Tiger-Heli&quot; are owned by Tatsujin, a Japanese developer formed by Yuge. In 2021, the game was released in Japan for the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch as part of the &quot;Toaplan Arcade Garage&quot; compilation with an English release in Spring 2024 and a physical release by Limited Run Games.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Tiger-Heli&quot; is a military-themed vertically scrolling shoot &#x27;em up game, in which players take control of the titular attack helicopter through four increasingly difficult levels in order to defeat an assortment of military enemy forces like tanks, battleships, and artillery as the main objective. Besides some airplanes taking off, there are no flying enemies in the entire game. As far as vertical scrolling shooters go, the title initially appears to be very standard, as players control their craft over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until a helipad is reached. Players have only two weapons at their disposal: the standard shot that travels a max distance of half the screen&#x27;s height and two bombs.

A unique gameplay feature is the bomb mechanic; unlike other games in the genre released at the time, the bombs are powerful weapons capable of obliterating any enemy caught within its blast radius. The bombs also act as a shield against incoming enemy fire, however, as they can be triggered after taking enemy hits as well. There are also three types of items scattered through every stage in total that appear as destructible flashing crosses: extra bomb stocks and two variations of helicopter &quot;options&quot; that attack at the player&#x27;s will against incoming enemies, while is also possible to mix and match the two helicopter option types, totaling no more than two. These items can be picked up by shooting their respective cross color but grabbing any item when not necessary yields bonus points.

Players are given three lives initially and bonus lives are awarded by reaching certain score thresholds or collecting ten gold diamonds in a row by shooting them. Firing on determined locations is also crucial for reaching high-scores to obtain extra lives, as certain setpieces in some stages hosts a bonus secret within their scenery. There are also hidden bonus secrets to be found as well. The game employs a checkpoint system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying. Getting hit by enemy fire will result in losing a life, as well as the helicopter options and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless the player inserts more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. After completing the last stage, the game begins again with the second loop increasing in difficulty and enemies fire denser bullet patterns.

== Development ==
&quot;Tiger-Heli&quot; was created under the working title &quot;Cobra&quot; by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Orca and Crux before both companies declared bankruptcy, after which a group of employees from the two gaming divisions would go on to form Toaplan and among them were composers Masahiro Yuge and Tatsuya Uemura, both of which recounted the project&#x27;s development process and history between 1989 and 2012 through various Japanese publications. The team wanted to create a game that balanced frustrating and entertaining sections, as well as inciting audiences to keep playing after losing a live and progress further, though the idea of playing as a helicopter was influenced by &quot;Gyrodine&quot; because the team felt it could work as a shoot &#x27;em up title where the screen kept scrolling.

When creating the artwork for &quot;Tiger-Heli&quot;, which has been described as &quot;polygonal&quot; in recent interviews, Toaplan was realizing research for a possible flight simulator they could develop themselves and one of the project&#x27;s designers implemented a sample image from the simulator into the game. The concept of using a bomb in a shoot &#x27;em up game came up during development, where the team questioned how to make the title more engaging for players but it was never intended for defensive purposes according to them, as the mechanic was instead implemented to provide an aggressive feeling against enemies during difficult situations in the title. Several other features were integrated into the project as a way to keep audiences playing such as the continuous stage scrolling during the high score screen, which was akin to a drama. According to Uemura, development was financed with the team&#x27;s own funds, as Taito solely focused on distribution and Toaplan&#x27;s name could not be displayed in the game due to contractual arrangements.

The soundtrack was composed by Uemura, who also created the sound effects. When writing the music during development, Uemura intended the songs to convey a sense of bravery but he was limited due to technical and memory restrictions at the time of release.

== Release ==
&quot;Tiger-Heli&quot; was released in arcades across Japan and North America in October 1985 by Taito and Romstar. On 21 November 1988, an album containing music from the title and its sequel was co-published exclusively in Japan by Scitron and Pony Inc.

On 5 December 1986, a Nintendo Entertainment System port of &quot;Tiger-Heli&quot; developed by Micronics was first released in Japan by Pony Inc. It was then released in North America in September 1987 by Acclaim Entertainment, who also distributed the title across Europe in January 1990. This version was also released in South Korea by Hyundai Electronics in 1987. Both the original arcade version and the later NES port are similar but have a number of key differences between each other such as the latter having a smaller color palette and lower screen resolution that led to sprites being recolored and the graphics redrawn in different ways, an arranged soundtrack by Masahiro Yuge, among other changes.

On 30 August 1996, Banpresto released a compilation for the PlayStation exclusively in Japan titled &quot;Toaplan Shooting Battle 1&quot;, which included both arcade versions of &quot;Tiger-Heli&quot; and its sequel, an arranged soundtrack by Uemura and other additions. In 2021, both the arcade and Nintendo Entertainment System versions were included in the &quot;Kyukyoku Tiger-Heli&quot; compilation for Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 as part of M2&#x27;s &quot;Toaplan Arcade Garage&quot; label. &quot;Tiger-Heli&quot; was included as part of the &quot;Toaplan Arcade 1&quot; compilation for Evercade.

== Reception and legacy ==
According to Masahiro Yuge, &quot;Tiger-Heli&quot; proved to be popular in arcades during initial beta location testings. In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed it on their October 1, 1985 issue as being the most popular table arcade game at the time, outperforming titles such as &quot;Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins&quot; and &quot;Gradius&quot;.

&quot;Den of Geek&quot; noted it to be the title from Toaplan which established their gameplay style that would later be refined in the future with other titles, as well as its introduction of a bomb mechanism. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; called &quot;Tiger-Heli&quot; for the NES an excellent port, and concluded that it was &quot;one of the most exciting arcade shoot-&#x27;em-ups to turn up&quot;. However, fan reception of the NES conversion in Japan was mixed; in a poll taken by &quot;Family Computer Magazine&quot;, it received a score of 15.55 out of 30. The NES version sold over one million copies, making it one of the best-selling games for the platform.

&quot;Tiger-Heli&quot; had two sequels, &quot;Twin Cobra&quot; and &quot;Twin Cobra II&quot;. In addition, the titular craft makes an appearance on the &quot;Let&#x27;s! TV Play Classic&quot; plug and play game series by SSD Company Limited in &quot;Slap Fight Tiger&quot; as an alternative craft to the default Leopard space fighter. A game of a similar style titled &quot;Tiger Mission&quot; was developed in 1987 by Kele Line and published by Status Software across Europe only for the Commodore 64. In more recent years, the rights to the game and many other IPs from Toaplan are now owned by Tatsujin, a company named after &quot;Truxton&quot;&#x27;s Japanese title that was founded in 2017 by Yuge, and is part of Embracer Group since 2022.

<doc id="723314" wikidata="Q3020041" url="?curid=723314" title="Twin Cobra">
<text>Twin Cobra, known as in Japan, is a vertically scrolling shooter developed by Toaplan and released for arcades in 1987 by Taito in Japan and Europe, then in North America by Romstar. It is a sequel to the 1985 arcade game &quot;Tiger-Heli&quot;. Controlling the titular attack helicopter, the players must fight endless waves of military vehicles while avoiding collision with their projectiles and other obstacles. It was the fourth shoot &#x27;em up game from Toaplan, and their tenth video game overall. It was ported to multiple platforms, with each done by different third-party developers that made several changes or additions.

&quot;Twin Cobra&quot; was a success for Toaplan, garnering positive reception from western critics and earning several awards from &quot;Gamest&quot;. The game was met with mixed response from magazines, specifically the home versions. In 1995, the sequel &quot;Twin Cobra II&quot; was released. The rights to the game are owned by Tatsujin, a Japanese company formed by Masahiro Yuge.

==Hardware==
The game ran on the Toaplan Twin Cobra hardware (PCB), featuring a Motorola 68000 CPU clocked at 7 MHz with additional chips (a Z80 CPU clocked at 3.5 MHz and a 320C10 chip at 3.5 MHz) as well as a Yamaha YM3812 sound chip clocked at 3.5 MHz. Toaplan&#x27;s Flying Shark used the same arcade hardware board.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Twin Cobra&quot; is a military-themed vertically scrolling shoot &#x27;em up game, in which players take control of the titular attack helicopter through ten increasingly difficult levels, each with a boss at the end that must be fought before progressing any further, in order to defeat an assortment of military enemy forces like tanks, battleships, and artillery as the main objective. The title initially appears to be very standard, as players control their craft over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until a helipad is reached. Players have only two weapons at their disposal: the standard shot that travels a max distance of the screen&#x27;s height and three bombs.

The bombs are powerful weapons capable of obliterating any enemy caught within its blast radius and collecting &quot;B&quot; icons adds an extra bomb stock. A new gameplay addition compared to its predecessor are power-up items that appear via enemy carriers; There are four types of weapons in the game that can be switched between after destroying incoming carriers by picking up color-changing icons ranging from red, blue, green and yellow, while &quot;S&quot; icons increases the helicopter&#x27;s firepower. Other items scattered throughout the levels such as 1-ups and star-shaped gold medals, which grants a 3000-point bonus by collecting them, can also be picked up along the way. Players are given two lives initially and bonus lives are awarded at certain point thresholds and every point threshold thereafter.

Depending on the region, the title uses either a checkpoint system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying, or a respawn system where their ship immediately starts at the location they died at. Getting hit by enemy fire or colliding against enemies will result in losing a life, as well as a penalty of decreasing the helicopter&#x27;s firepower to his original state and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless the players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. After completing the last stage as with previous titles from Toaplan, the game begins again with the second loop increasing in difficulty and enemies fire denser bullet patterns.

== Development ==

&quot;Twin Cobra&quot;″s creation process and history was recounted through various Japanese publications by composers Masahiro Yuge and Tatsuya Uemura, both of which collaborated with the soundtrack using guitar and marked the second time Toaplan made use of FM synthesis. Yuge stated that the basic structure for the game was already decided during development of &quot;Slap Fight&quot; by pursuing the excitement of shooting and dodging, settling on the bomb and shot system, claiming that firing a bomb relieved stress from players, as they wanted to make a game that was fun by looking at and get passionate about it. Yuge also claimed that the word &quot;Kyūkyoku&quot; for its Japanese title derived from a translation of &quot;Going for the One&quot;, the eight studio album by English progressive rock band Yes, as it was not a popular word at the time and although the Japanese title was initially rejected by then-president of Toaplan, he was determined to implement it. The concept of using a bomb came up during development of &quot;Tiger-Heli&quot;, where the team questioned how to make a shoot &#x27;em up game more engaging for players but it was never intended for defensive purposes according to them, as the mechanic was instead implemented to provide an aggressive feeling against enemies on difficult situations, however enemies were made tougher to keep gameplay balance.

&quot;Twin Cobra&quot; was also, alongside &quot;Slap Fight&quot;, one of the earliest projects Toaplan made use of game design documents, with both Uemura and Yuge stating that ideas by the team were first written in text using A4 paper before reading it during meetings. Several features were integrated into the project by diverse factors such as items swirling around the screen, which was inspired by a donburi bowl, while the slow speed of the helicopter was due to make the title akin to puzzle games and require a level of strategy. Yuge stated that cooperative gameplay was originally not developed but were requested in doing so after completing the single-player version due to simultaneous two-player titles being &quot;a big trend&quot; in overseas regions and being conscious of the American market, as the game had a realistic war setting. Around five members collaborated with the project on a six-month development period including Uemura and Yuge acting as programmers, as well as three designers. Artist Kōetsu Iwabuchi, who previously worked on &quot;Guardian&quot;, was responsible for the artwork. Despite being published by Taito, Uemura stated that the publisher allowed them to reveal the project was made by Toaplan. Uemura also claimed the project was influenced by &quot;Halley&#x27;s Comet&quot;, as he wanted to portray the feeling of aiming and shooting.

== Release ==
&quot;Twin Cobra&quot; was first released across arcades worldwide in October 1987 by Taito in Japan and Europe, as well as Romstar in North America. On 21 November 1988, an album containing music from the title and its predecessor was co-published exclusively in Japan by Scitron and Pony Canyon.

=== Ports ===
&quot;Twin Cobra&quot; was converted to multiple platforms by various third-party developers including the PC Engine (1989), Nintendo Entertainment System (1989), Sega Genesis (1991), X68000 (1993) and the FM Towns (1994). The PC Engine port, developed by A.I Company, was released exclusively in Japan by Taito. The NES port, developed by Micronics, was first released in Japan CBS/Sony and later in North America by Sammy. The Genesis port, developed by GRC, was first published in Japan by Treco, then in North America by Sega and later in Brazil by Tectoy. On 30 August 1996, Banpresto released a compilation for the PlayStation exclusively in Japan titled &quot;Toaplan Shooting Battle 1&quot;, which included both arcade versions of &quot;Twin Cobra&quot; and its prequel, an arranged soundtrack by Uemura and other additions. In November 2019, &quot;Twin Cobra&quot; was re-released for iOS and Android mobile devices only in Japan by MOBIRIX Corporation under the name &quot;Kyukyoku Tiger Classic&quot;. A port for Samsung Smart TV platform is also available through a Samsung TV&#x27;s games panel.

==== M2 ShotTriggers ====
&quot;Twin Cobra&quot; was later included by M2 as part of their M2 ShotTriggers publishing label. An arcade version, alongside the PC Engine, Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis versions, were included in the &quot;Kyukyoku Tiger-Heli&quot; compilation for Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 as part of M2&#x27;s &quot;Toaplan Arcade Garage&quot; label in 2022.

==== Steam ====
&quot;Twin Cobra&quot; was released on Steam in February 2023. Bitwave Games was responsible for the port of this version.

== Reception ==

According to Masahiro Yuge and Tatsuya Uemura, &quot;Twin Cobra&quot; proved to be a popular hit for Toaplan, though &quot;Flying Shark&quot; was &quot;the biggest&quot; hit for them. In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed it on their 1 January 1988 issue as being the fourth most-successful table arcade unit of the month, outperforming titles such as &quot;Thundercade&quot; and &quot;Rainbow Islands: The Story of Bubble Bobble 2&quot;. It went on to become Japan&#x27;s highest-grossing arcade conversion kit of 1988.

&quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; reviewer Clare Edgeley gave an overall positive outlook to the arcade original.

== Legacy ==
A sequel, &quot;Twin Cobra II&quot;, was originally under development by Toaplan but the studio closed down in 1994 until Taito allowed Toaplan offshoot Takumi Corporation to finish work on the project as their first release in 1995, before being ported to Sega Saturn in 1997 under the name &quot;Kyukyoku Tiger II Plus&quot;. Former Seibu Kaihatsu artist Toshinobu Komazawa claimed that Seibu borrowed ideas from &quot;Twin Cobra&quot; when developing &quot;Raiden&quot;. Artist Perry &quot;Gryzor/Rozyrg&quot; Sessions cited &quot;Twin Cobra&quot; as one of the main influences for &quot;Super XYX&quot;. The rights to &quot;Twin Cobra&quot; and many other IPs from Toaplan are now owned by Tatsujin, a company named after &quot;Truxton&quot;&#x27;s Japanese title that was founded in 2017 by former Toaplan employee Masahiro Yuge, and is part of Embracer Group since 2022.

<text>is a run and gun arcade video game developed by Toaplan and published in Japan by Tecmo, North America by Romstar and Europe in August 1990. Set in a future where an alien race from the fictional planet Owagira are threatening to wipe out humanity after multiple failed attempts to defend Earth against their attacks, players assume the role of cyborg mercenaries recruited by the United Nations in a last-ditch effort to overthrow the invaders.

&quot;Out Zone&quot; received positive reception from critics since its release and has been praised for its visuals, sound design, gameplay, multiplayer, challenge and overall intensity but some lamented the lack of a console release. A spiritual successor, &quot;FixEight&quot;, was released for arcades in July 1992. As of 2019, the rights to the title is owned by Tatsujin, a company founded in 2017 by former Toaplan member Masahiro Yuge and now-affiliate of Japanese arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia alongside many other Toaplan IPs.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Out Zone&quot; is a science fiction-themed vertically scrolling run and gun game reminiscent of &quot;Commando&quot; and &quot;Ikari Warriors&quot;, where players assume the role of two cyborg mercenaries hired by the United Nations through seven increasingly difficult levels, each with a boss at the end that must be fought before progressing any further, in a last-ditch effort to overthrow an alien race from the planet Owagira from invading Earth as the main objective. Players fight enemies on foot, moving upward through the level, and are equipped with a number of bombs at the start, which obliterates any enemy caught in its blast radius, but player characters are not rendered invincible for any time period after using a bomb.

A unique gameplay feature is the weapon system; players are equipped with two main weapons at the beginning that can be upgraded by picking up to two &quot;P&quot; icons in a row and switch between them by picking up a &quot;C&quot; icon. The semi-automatic forward gun shoots forward no matter which way players move, but shoots three bullets in a slight spread each time the fire button is pressed, while the all-direction laser fires in the direction of movement, creating a sweep of bullets as the player character changes direction. The laser also shoots rapidly when tapping the fire button and each weapon is useful in certain situations, as players will often have to switch based on the enemy configuration. Other weapons appear on certain occasions as different colored &quot;SP&quot; icons to acquire, like a flamethrower and a rotating energy ball capable of piercing walls. Another gameplay feature is the energy bar; similar to &quot;Wonder Boy&quot;, players must remain aware of the energy bar, which constantly runs down at a steady pace and can only be refilled by collecting &quot;E&quot; icons scattered throughout the stage. The energy bar itself does not act as health, as players can still be killed with a single enemy shot. Various other &quot;SP&quot; items can also be picked up along the way such as 1UPs, a speed increaser, shield and an energy extender that increases the length of the energy meter.

The game hosts a number of hidden bonus secrets to be found, which is also crucial for reaching high-scores to obtain extra lives, as well as cameos of characters from other Toaplan games such as &quot;Flying Shark&quot;, &quot;Truxton&quot; and &quot;Zero Wing&quot;. The title uses a checkpoint system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying. Getting hit by enemy fire, colliding against solid stage obstacles, falling off the stage or running out of energy will result in losing a life, as well as a penalty of decreasing the characters&#x27; firepower and speed to his original state and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless the players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. Although there is an ending, the game loops back to the first stage after completing the last stage as with previous titles from Toaplan, with each one increasing the difficulty and enemies fire denser bullet patterns.

== Synopsis ==
In an advanced space era, humanity encountered, traded and formed alliances with many alien races to ensure security. Humanity had been subject to past invasions from hostile outside forces but the alliances Earth forged granted victories in the past. However in the year 2095, Earth had been subjected a to new invasion launched by the alien military force of planet Owagira, with overwhelmingly powerful and sophisticated weaponry than anything Earth&#x27;s alliance could counter. With the threat of annihilation looming over, Earth&#x27;s United Nations receive a message from an alien elder within their alliances about the existence of an ultra-elite mercenary unit named &quot;Out Zone&quot; at a remote region of the Milky Way galaxy. Known as &quot;Space Entrepreneurs&quot; and renowned for their fighting skills by other alien alliances, Out Zone takes sides with no one and are willing to fight any wars for the proper price. Under desperation and as a last-ditch effort to counterattack Owagira&#x27;s military force, the UN requests Out Zone&#x27;s service, guaranteeing the UN member nations&#x27; entire annual budget as payment. With negotiations complete, two very powerful cyborg mercenaries belonging to Out Zone volunteer for the mission. Having ties to Earth and realizing that their homeworld is in great peril, the two warriors rise up to save it from doom and destroy the Owagira Forces.

== Development and release ==
&quot;Out Zone&quot;″s soundtrack was composed by Tatsuya Uemura, who also created the sound effects while Naoki Ogiwara served as designer. Uemura recounted its development process and history in interviews, stating that it was difficult for him as he could not apply his experience from vertical-scrolling shooters with flying ships, as players controlled the game on-foot and could not design its progress. The project was fundamentally different due to the lack of forced scrolling, which did not require skills from vertical shoot &#x27;em ups and players could move or stop freely. Uemura said that the intro was written during creation of the demonstration sequence, as the game&#x27;s world was already established. The team integrated puzzle elements not found in ship-based shooters, which took time to plan out and Uemura said that the schedule for sound production was constantly being reduced, barely implementing the music during development. For the first stage&#x27;s music, Uemura revealed in response to a user on Twitter that the main melody was originally composed based on &quot;Taiyō ni Hoero!&quot;. When composing music for the last stage, Uemura wanted to convey the sense of a &quot;decisive battle&quot;. Uemura has since regarded the project as &quot;the most difficult product he worked on&quot;.

&quot;Out Zone&quot; was released in arcades worldwide in August 1990 by Tecmo, Romstar and Toaplan. On October 21 of the same year, an album containing music from the title and &quot;Snow Bros.&quot; was co-published exclusively in Japan by Scitron and Pony Canyon, featuring an arranged song composed by Uemura. Unlike several other releases by Toaplan, the title remained exclusive to arcades and did not receive any official port to home consoles. By 2020, a new version of &quot;Out Zone&quot; by M2 was announced as part of their M2 ShotTriggers publishing label. It was first announced to be released on the Nintendo Switch. In December 2020, the game was made available on the iiRcade arcade console, marking its first appearance outside the arcades. The game was included in 2022 as part of the Sega Astro City Mini V, a vertically-oriented variant of the Sega Astro City mini console.

== Reception and legacy ==
&quot;Out Zone&quot; received positive reception since its release, becoming a well regarded title from Toaplan in recent years. In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed it on their August 15, 1990 issue as being the fifth most-popular arcade game at the time. In Australia, &quot;Leisure Line&quot; magazine reported the game to be the fifth most-popular Japanese coin-op game in their September 1990 issue. In the November 1990 issue of Japanese publication &quot;Micom BASIC Magazine&quot;, the game was ranked on the number fifteenth spot in popularity. Likewise, &quot;RePlay&quot; reported &quot;Out Zone&quot; to be the fourteenth most-popular arcade game at the time in North America. In May 1991, UK magazine &quot;Zero&quot; ranked it on their number nine spot in popularity.

&quot;Sinclair User&quot; praised the fast-paced gameplay and frenetic action, stating that &quot;&quot;Outzone&quot; is one hell of a challenge, particularly past the initial stages, but is sure to set the pulse racing if you&#x27;ve got the reactions to match it!&quot;. Likewise, David Wilson of &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; praised the frenetic gameplay, although he drew comparison with &quot;Mercs&quot;. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;&#x27;s Mike Bevan gave positive remarks to the presentation but lamented the lack of a console release. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;″s Julian Rignall scored the game with an overall 80% rating. Nick Zverloff of &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot; gave it an overall mixed retrospective. Similarly, Malcolm Laurie from &quot;SHMUPS!&quot; lamented the lack of a console port but praised the visuals, sound design, gameplay and multiplayer.

&quot;Out Zone&quot; was included as one of the titles in the 2010 book &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot;. A spiritual sequel, &quot;FixEight&quot;, was released in July 1992 for arcades. In more recent years, the rights to the game, its spiritual follow-up and many other IPs from Toaplan are now owned by Tatsujin, a company named after &quot;Truxton&quot;″s Japanese title that was founded in 2017 by former Toaplan employee Masahiro Yuge, and is part of Embracer Group since 2022.

<doc id="723320" wikidata="Q266487" url="?curid=723320" title="H-II Transfer Vehicle">
<text>The H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV), also called , is an expendable Japanese automated cargo spacecraft designed for International Space Station (ISS) resupply missions, particularly the &quot;Kibō&quot; Japanese Experiment Module (JEM). 

Development of the spacecraft began in the early 1990s and the HTV&#x27;s first mission, HTV-1, was launched on 10September 2009 on an H-IIB launch vehicle. The name &quot;Kounotori&quot; was chosen because &quot;a white stork carries an image of conveying an important thing (a baby, happiness, and other joyful things), therefore, it precisely expresses the HTV&#x27;s mission to transport essential materials to the ISS&quot;.

The HTV is crucial for ISS resupply, especially after the retirement of the Space Shuttle, as it&#x27;s the only vehicle capable of transporting large International Standard Payload Racks (ISPR) and disposing of old ones within the ISS&#x27;s US Orbital Segment.

The final HTV mission, Kounotori 9, was launched on 20 May 2020. JAXA is currently developing its successor, the HTV-X, which is expected to make its maiden flight in early 2025.

== Design ==

The HTV is about long (including maneuvering thrusters at one end) and in diameter. Total mass when empty is , with a maximum total payload of , for a maximum launch weight of .

The HTV is comparable in function to the Russian Progress, the ESA ATV, the SpaceX Cargo Dragons, and the Cygnus spacecraft, all of which bring supplies to the ISS. Like the ATV, the HTV carries more than twice the payload of the Progress, but is launched less than half as often. Unlike Progress spacecraft, Cargo Dragon 2&#x27;s and ATV&#x27;s which use the docking ports automatically, HTVs and American Dragon 1 approach the ISS in stages, and once they reach their closest parking orbit to the ISS, crew grapple them using the robotic arm Canadarm2 and berth them to an open berthing port on the &quot;Harmony&quot; module.

The HTV has an external payload bay which is accessed by the robotic arm after it has been berthed to the ISS. New payloads can be moved directly from the HTV to &quot;Kibō&quot;&#x27;s exposed facility. Internally, it has eight International Standard Payload Racks (ISPRs) in total which can be unloaded by the crew in a shirt-sleeve environment. After the retirement of NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle in 2011, HTVs became the only spacecraft capable of transporting ISPRs to the ISS. The SpaceX Dragon and Northrop Grumman Cygnus can carry resupply cargo bags but not ISPRs.

The intent behind the HTV&#x27;s modularized design was to use different module configurations to match different mission requirements. However, to reduce the development cost it was decided to fly the mixed PLC/ULC configuration only.

To control the HTV&#x27;s attitude and perform the orbital maneuvers such as rendezvous and reentry, the craft has four 500-N-class main thrusters and twenty-eight 110-N-class attitude control thrusters. Both use bipropellant, namely monomethylhydrazine (MMH) as fuel and mixed oxides of nitrogen (MON3) as oxidizer. HTV-1, HTV-2, and HTV-4 use Aerojet&#x27;s 110 N R-1E, Space Shuttle&#x27;s vernier engine, and the 500 N based on the Apollo spacecraft&#x27;s R-4D. Later HTVs use 500 N class HBT-5 thrusters and 120 N class HBT-1 thrusters made by Japanese manufacturer IHI Aerospace Co., Ltd. The HTV&#x27;s four spherical propellant tanks usually carry about 2 tonnes of propellant (the maximum capacity is 2432 kg).

After the unloading process is completed, the HTV is loaded with waste and unberthed. The vehicle then deorbits and is destroyed during reentry, the debris falling into the Pacific Ocean.

== Flights ==
Initially seven missions were planned in 2008–2015. With the extension of the ISS project through 2028, three more missions were added, with the tenth flight seeing an improved, cost-reduced version called the HTV-X.

The first vehicle was launched on an H-IIB rocket, a more powerful version of the earlier H-IIA, at 17:01 UTC on 10 September 2009, from Launch Pad 2 of the Yoshinobu Launch Complex at the Tanegashima Space Center.

, a total of nine missions successfully launched — one each year for 2015–2019 (though there was no launch in 2017, pushing back the latest to 2020) — one fewer total mission than had been planned in August 2013 at the time the fourth HTV mission was underway.

The improved version of the craft HTV-X is planned to be first used for the tenth flight and will perform scheduled ISS resupply duties for 2021-2024 (with a first launch scheduled for February 2022). In addition, JAXA has agreed to provide HTV-X logistic resupply flights to the Gateway mini-space station (launched by either Falcon Heavy or Ariane 6) as part of its Gateway contribution in addition to co-developing a habitation module with the ESA.

== Successor ==
=== HTV-X ===
In May 2015, Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology announced a proposal to replace the HTV with an improved, cost-reduced version preliminary called HTV-X.

In December 2015, the plan to develop HTV-X was approved by the Strategic Headquarters for Space Policy of the Cabinet Office, targeting launch in fiscal year 2021 for the flight of HTV-X1 (Technical Demonstration Vehicle) by the H3 rocket. , new ISS plans from NASA&#x27;s Flight Planning Integration Panel have set the launch of HTV-X1 for February 2022, which is on schedule. In 2022 the debut of the HTV-X spacecraft has been furtherly delayed to January 2024.

The HTV-X has a length of 6.2 m, or 10 m with the unpressurised cargo module fitted. The payload fairing adaptor and payload dispenser have been widened from 1.7 m to 4.4 m to allow the pressurized cargo module to be swapped out for alternate modules, to add increased structural strength, and to accommodate the side hatch.

, an evolutionary version of HTV-X called HTV-XG is being considered for transferring cargo to the Lunar Gateway as part of the Artemis program.

== Former evolutionary proposals ==
=== HTV-R ===
, JAXA was planning to add a return capsule option. In this concept, HTV&#x27;s pressurized cargo would be replaced by a reentry module capable of returning cargo from ISS to Earth.

Further, conceptual plans in 2012 included a follow-on spacecraft design by 2022 which would accommodate a crew of three and carry up to of cargo.

=== Lagrange outpost resupply ===
, both JAXA and Mitsubishi conducted studies of a next generation HTV as a possible Japanese contribution to the proposed international crewed outpost at Earth-Moon L2. This variant of HTV was to be launched by H-X Heavy and can carry 1800 kg of supplies to EML2. Modifications from the current HTV includes the addition of solar electric paddles and extension of the propellant tank.

=== Human-rated variant ===
A proposal announced in June 2008, &quot;Preliminary Study for Manned Spacecraft with Escape System and H-IIB Rocket&quot; suggested combining HTV&#x27;s propulsion module with a human-rated capsule for four people.

=== Japanese space station ===
A Japanese space station has been proposed to be built up from HTV modules. This method is similar to how the modules in &quot;Mir&quot;, as well as many modules of the Russian Orbital Segment of the ISS are based on the TKS cargo vehicle design.

<text>Jennifer Westfeldt (born February 2, 1970) is an American actress, screenwriter, and producer. She is best known for co-writing, co-producing, and starring in the 2002 indie film &quot;Kissing Jessica Stein&quot;, for which she received an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best First Screenplay. She is also known for writing, producing, starring in, and making her directorial debut in the indie film, &quot;Friends with Kids&quot; (2012).

Westfeldt&#x27;s television work includes recurring roles on &quot;Notes from the Underbelly&quot; (2007–2009), &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; (2009), &quot;24&quot; (2010), and &quot;Younger&quot; (2017–2021) as well as guest starred on shows such as &quot;Girls&quot;, and &quot;This Is Us&quot;. Westfeldt made her Broadway debut in 2003 in the revival of &quot;Wonderful Town&quot; earning a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical.

==Early life and education==
Westfeldt is the daughter of Constance Perelson, a therapist, and Patrick M. Westfeldt Jr., an electrical engineer. Her stepfather is Michael Perelson, also a therapist. Her older sister is journalist Amy Westfeldt. Westfeldt grew up in Guilford, Connecticut, where she attended Guilford High School. She then attended Yale University, where she received a B.A. in Theater Studies. While at Yale, she starred in numerous plays and musicals and sang in the a cappella group Redhot &amp; Blue.

== Career ==
=== 1997–2005: Early roles and breakthrough ===
Upon graduating from Yale University with a B.A. in Theater Studies, Westfeldt started her career as a New York-based theater actress, starring in dozens of regional and Off-Broadway productions, including the long-running Off-Broadway musical &quot;The Fantasticks&quot;. In 1997, she was cast as a series regular on the 20th Century Fox/ABC sitcom &quot;Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place&quot;, alongside Ryan Reynolds, Traylor Howard and Richard Ruccolo. In 1997 Westfeldt co-wrote and co-starred with Heather Juergensen in an Off-Broadway play based on a series of sketches called &quot;Lipschtick: The Story of Two Women Seeking The Perfect Shade&quot;, which caught the attention of major Hollywood studios. The play was optioned by Radar Pictures to be made into a film, but after two years of studio development, Westfeldt and Juergensen bought back the rights to the script and decided to make the film independently.

&quot;Kissing Jessica Stein&quot; debuted at the LA International Film Festival in 2001, where it won the Audience Award for Best Feature, and a Special Jury Award for Writing and Acting for Westfeldt and Juergensen. The film was released by Fox Searchlight Pictures in March 2002. Westfeldt received the Golden Satellite Award for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy for her role as Jessica, and an Indie Spirit Nomination for Best First Screenplay. The film won the Audience Favorites Award at the Chicago International Film Festival, the Audience Award at the Miami Film Festival, Best Feature at the Louisville Jewish Film Festival, and the GLAAD Media Award, and it was included on more than a dozen top ten lists in 2002. Variety wrote, &quot;A fresh take on sex and the single girl, this buoyant, well-crafted romantic comedy blends pitch-perfect performances with deliciously smart writing.&quot; In &quot;Newsweek&quot; David Ansen said the film &quot;knows what it wants, what its limits are, and delivers its delights accordingly.&quot; In 2014, The Advocate listed the movie as an essential film for LGBTQ+ viewers that &quot;encourages exploration and self-awareness.&quot; In 2020, Kvellar writer Mara Reinstein looked back on the impact that this &quot;authentic&quot; and &quot;nuanced&quot; movie had, writing, &quot;I can&#x27;t overstate how much &quot;Kissing Jessica Stein&quot; pioneered the gay rom-com.&quot;

Westfeldt made her Broadway debut in the fall of 2003 in the critical and commercial hit &quot;Wonderful Town&quot;, starring opposite two-time Tony winner Donna Murphy and directed by three-time Tony winner Kathleen Marshall. Westfeldt received a 2004 Tony nomination, a Theater World Award for Outstanding Broadway Debut, and a Drama League Award for her role as Eileen Sherwood. Of her Broadway debut, John Simon of New York magazine wrote: &quot;Jennifer Westfeldt leaps onto the Broadway stage in full-fledged acting and singing splendor as the adorable Eileen.&quot; Ben Brantley of the New York Times wrote, &quot;Jennifer Westfeldt makes a charming Broadway debut as Eileen, Ruth&#x27;s boy-magnet of a sister.&quot; &quot;Ms. Westfeldt&#x27;s delightfully un-self-conscious interpretation suggests a virginal answer to the Vargas pinup girls,&quot; he added.

=== 2006–2011: Acting work and directorial debut ===
Westfeldt&#x27;s next feature, &quot;Ira &amp; Abby&quot;, marked her first solo screenwriting effort. The film debuted at the Los Angeles Film Festival in 2006, where it won the Audience Award for Best Feature. It was acquired by Magnolia Pictures and released in the fall of 2007 to strong reviews. Westfeldt won Best Actress at the HBO U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen in 2006 for her performance as Abby, where &quot;Ira &amp; Abby&quot; also took home the Jury Prize for Best Feature. The film won Audience Award for Best Feature at the Boston Jewish Film Festival.

After one season on &quot;Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place&quot;, 20th Century Fox Studios cast Westfeldt as the lead of another series, the short-lived &quot;Holding the Baby&quot; on Fox. She went on to star in multiple pilots, including the WB&#x27;s &quot;The Gene Pool&quot; opposite Chris Eigeman; &quot;The Untitled Paul Reiser Pilot&quot; on F/X; and Steve Levitan&#x27;s &quot;Dante&quot; on NBC, opposite Morris Chestnut and Kevin Hart. In 2002, Westfeldt, along with her journalist sister Amy, sold a one-hour newsroom drama pitch to Touchstone/ABC; Westfeldt was attached to star. Called &quot;The Independent&quot;, the series was loosely inspired by her sister&#x27;s experiences as a career journalist at the Associated Press. In 2006, she was cast as the female lead in ABC&#x27;s &quot;Notes from the Underbelly&quot;, which ran for two seasons. Andrew Johnston wrote in TimeOut: &quot;Jennifer Westfeldt is a total babe, with physical-comedy skills that, if properly honed, could approach Lucille Ball territory. In other words, she was basically born for TV. [Westfeldt] gets to show her serious side, too, and if the series gives her enough exposure to start competing with Hope Davis and Laura Linney for blond-WASP roles, &quot;Underbelly&quot; will have more than justified its existence.&quot; In 2010, with Alan Ball attached as executive producer, she sold a TV dramedy to HBO with her attached to star about the bird&#x27;s nest custody agreement in divorce cases.

In 2011, Westfeldt wrote, produced, starred in, and made her directorial debut in &quot;Friends with Kids&quot;, which was a breakout hit at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival. Lionsgate and Roadside Attractions obtained the rights to the film, and it was released in 2012. Westfeldt starred opposite Adam Scott, with a cast including Maya Rudolph, Kristen Wiig, Chris O&#x27;Dowd, Ed Burns, Megan Fox and Jon Hamm. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called &quot;Friends with Kids&quot; &quot;an indelibly funny and touching comedy with a real sting in its tail,&quot; and deemed Westfeldt &quot;an actress of rare wit and grace, and now a filmmaker with a keen eye for nuance. In front of the camera and behind it, she&#x27;s the live current that pulls us in and makes us care. Westfeldt is the pulse of &quot;Friends With Kids&quot;, presenting us with life in all of its vibrant, messy sprawl.&quot; The film was included on New York Magazine&#x27;s Top Ten Movies of 2012 list, as well as NPR&#x27;s Top 12 of 2012.

=== 2012–present ===
Her varied TV credits include memorable arcs on &quot;Younger&quot;, &quot;Queen America&quot; (opposite Catherine Zeta-Jones), &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;24&quot;, &quot;Judging Amy&quot;, and &quot;Hack&quot;; and guest-starring turns on NBC&#x27;s hit drama &quot;This Is Us&quot;, HBO&#x27;s &quot;Girls&quot;, and &quot;Childrens Hospital&quot;, among others. She provided the voice of Kit Luntayne in the &quot;Martha Speaks&quot; episodes &quot;Cora! Cora! Cora!&quot; and &quot;Cora Encore!&quot; on PBS.

Westfeldt&#x27;s other stage work includes the world premieres of Scott Z. Burns&#x27; &quot;The Library&quot; at The Public Theater opposite Chloe Grace-Moretz, directed by Steven Soderbergh; Nell Benjamin’s &quot;The Explorers Club&quot; at Manhattan Theater Club, directed by Marc Bruni; Nicky Silver&#x27;s &quot;Too Much Sun&quot; at The Vineyard Theater opposite Linda Lavin, directed by Mark Brokaw; Cusi Cram&#x27;s &quot;A Lifetime Burning&quot; at Primary Stages, directed by Pam MacKinnon; Joe Gilford’s &quot;Finks&quot; opposite Josh Radnor at The Powerhouse Theater/NYSAF, directed by Charlie Stratton; Stephen Belber&#x27;s &quot;The Power of Duff&quot; opposite Greg Kinnear at The Powerhouse Theater/NYSAF, directed by Peter Dubois; and Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros&#x27; &quot;Big Sky&quot; at The Geffen opposite Jon Tenney, directed by John Rando. In 2022 she received glowing reviews from the &quot;New York Times&quot; for her performance as Mama in Liba Vaynberg&#x27; s play &quot;The Gett.&quot;

Other film roles include the 2016 short &quot;Lemon&quot; opposite Noah Bean, which premiered at the 2016 Tribeca Film Festival and, in 2017, a supporting role in director Marielle Heller’s &quot;Can You Ever Forgive Me?&quot; opposite Melissa McCarthy, which later ended up on the cutting room floor. In 2017, Westfeldt produced the documentary &quot;Circus Kid&quot;, based on Lorenzo Pisoni&#x27;s life growing up in a circus family, which was bought and distributed by Sundance Now. In 2022 she wrote several episodes of the Showtime series &quot;The First Lady&quot;. 

Westfeldt sold to Amazon &quot;The Idea of You&quot;, an adapted screenplay based on the novel of the same name by Robinne Lee starring Anne Hathaway. The film completed shooting in December 2022 and was released in May 2024. With a self-reported 50 million viewers in the first two weeks it was Amazon MGM’s No. 1 romantic-comedy debut of all time, according to the studio. She is currently working on a film adaptation of Amy Poeppel&#x27;s novel &quot;The Sweet Spot.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Westfeldt was in a long-term relationship with actor Jon Hamm from 1997 to 2015. She divides her time between New York City and Los Angeles.

<text>John III, Duke of Cleves and Count of Mark (German: &quot;Johann III der Friedfertige&quot;; 10 November 1490 – 6 February 1539), known as John the Peaceful, was the Lord of Ravensberg, Count of Mark, and founder of the United Duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg.

== Life ==
John was born on 10 November 1490, as the son of John II, Duke of Cleves, and Mathilde of Hesse. In 1510, at the age of 19, John married Duchess Maria of Jülich-Berg, daughter of Duke William IV of Jülich-Berg and Sibylle of Brandenburg, who became heiress to her father&#x27;s estates Jülich, Berg and Ravensberg.

John became ruler of the United Duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg in 1521, and Lord of Ravensberg in 1528. John represented a compensatory attitude, which strove for a &quot;&quot; between the two confessions during the Protestant Reformation. In fact, the real influence at the court of Cleves was Erasmus. Many of his men were friends and followers of the Dutch scholar and theologian. In 1532 John wrote up a list of church regulations (&quot;Kirchenordnung&quot;), which expressed numerous ideas of Erasmus.

John had an instinct for balance as was shown when he married his eldest daughter Sybille to the elector of Saxony, John Frederick. John Frederick would go on to later head the Schmalkaldic League. In many ways, John of Cleves&#x27; court was ideal for raising a queen. It was fundamentally liberal, but serious-minded, theologically inclined, and profoundly Erasmian. It was from this court that his daughter Anne would be raised. Anne became the fourth wife of King Henry VIII of England.

==Family==

John and his wife Duchess Maria of Jülich-Berg had the following children:

# Sybille (17 January 1512 – 21 February 1554); married Elector John Frederick of Saxony, head of the Protestant Confederation of Germany, &quot;Champion of the Reformation&quot;. Had issue.
# Anne (28 June 1515 – 16 July 1557); who was briefly married to King Henry VIII of England, as his fourth wife. No issue. The marriage was annulled on 12 July 1540, on the grounds of non-consummation and her pre-contract to Francis of Lorraine.
# William (28 July 1516 – 5 January 1592); married Archduchess Maria, daughter of Emperor Ferdinand I, and had issue.
#Amalia (17 October 1517 – 1 March 1586); became Princess of the House of La Marck.
John also had with an unknown woman;

Elisabeth of Cleves (b.?- 15 July 1554) Married Gottfried von Bemmel, bailiff of Kervendonk and had issue.

Daughter (?- ? ) Became a nun.

<doc id="723339" wikidata="Q1184994" url="?curid=723339" title="Deltoidal icositetrahedron">
<text>In geometry, the deltoidal icositetrahedron (or trapezoidal icositetrahedron, tetragonal icosikaitetrahedron, tetragonal trisoctahedron, strombic icositetrahedron) is a Catalan solid. Its 24 faces are congruent kites. The deltoidal icositetrahedron, whose dual is the (uniform) rhombicuboctahedron, is tightly related to the pseudo-deltoidal icositetrahedron, whose dual is the pseudorhombicuboctahedron; but the actual and pseudo-d.i. are not to be confused with each other.

== Cartesian coordinates ==
In the image above, the long body diagonals are those between opposite red vertices and between opposite blue vertices, and the short body diagonals are those between opposite yellow vertices.&lt;br&gt;Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of the deltoidal icositetrahedron centered at the origin and with long body diagonal length 2 are:
*red vertices (lying in formula_1-fold symmetry axes):
:formula_2
*blue vertices (lying in formula_3-fold symmetry axes):
:formula_4
*yellow vertices (lying in formula_5-fold symmetry axes):
:formula_6
Where formula_7 is the silver ratio, δs. 

For example, the point with coordinates formula_8 is the intersection of the plane with equation formula_9 and of the line with system of equations formula_10

A deltoidal icositetrahedron has three regular-octagon equators, lying in three orthogonal planes.

== Dimensions and angles ==
=== Dimensions ===
The deltoidal icositetrahedron with long body diagonal length &quot;D&quot; = 2 has:
*short body diagonal length:
::formula_11
*long edge length:
::formula_12
*short edge length:
::formula_13
*inradius:
::formula_14

formula_15 is the distance from the center to any face plane; it may be calculated by normalizing the equation of plane above, replacing (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) with (0, 0, 0), and taking the absolute value of the result.

A deltoidal icositetrahedron has its long and short edges in the ratio:
:formula_16

The deltoidal icositetrahedron with short edge length formula_17 has:
*area:
::formula_18
*volume:
::formula_19

=== Angles ===
For a deltoidal icositetrahedron, each kite face has:
*three equal acute angles, with value:
::formula_20
*one obtuse angle (between the short edges), with value:
::formula_21

=== Side Lengths ===
In a deltoidal icositetrahedron, each face is a kite-shaped quadrilateral. The side lengths of these kites can be expressed in the ratio 0.7731900694928638:1.
Specifically, the side adjacent to the obtuse angle has a length of approximately 0.707106785, while the side adjacent to the acute angle has a length of approximately 0.914213565.

== Occurrences in nature and culture ==
The deltoidal icositetrahedron is a crystal habit often formed by the mineral analcime and occasionally garnet. The shape is often called a trapezohedron in mineral contexts, although in solid geometry the name trapezohedron has another meaning.

In Guardians of The Galaxy Vol. 3, the device containing the files about the experiments carried on Rocket Raccoon has the shape of a deltoidal icositetrahedron.

== Orthogonal projections ==
The &quot;deltoidal icositetrahedron&quot; has three symmetry positions, all centered on vertices:
== Related polyhedra ==
The deltoidal icositetrahedron&#x27;s projection onto a cube divides its squares into quadrants. The projection onto a regular octahedron divides its equilateral triangles into kite faces. In Conway polyhedron notation this represents an &quot;ortho&quot; operation to a cube or octahedron. 

The deltoidal icositetrahedron is tightly related to the disdyakis dodecahedron . The main difference is that the latter also has edges between the vertices on 3- and 4-fold symmetry axes .

=== Dyakis dodecahedron ===

A variant with pyritohedral symmetry is called a dyakis dodecahedron or diploid. It is common in crystallography.&lt;br&gt;A dyakis dodecahedron can be created by enlarging 24 of the 48 faces of a disdyakis dodecahedron. A tetartoid can be created by enlarging 12 of the 24 faces of a dyakis dodecahedron.
=== Stellation ===
The great triakis octahedron is a stellation of the deltoidal icositetrahedron.

== Related polyhedra and tilings ==
The deltoidal icositetrahedron is a member of a family of duals to the uniform polyhedra related to the cube and regular octahedron.

When projected onto a sphere (see right), it can be seen that the edges make up the edges of a cube and regular octahedron arranged in their dual positions. It can also be seen that the 3- and 4-fold corners can be made to have the same distance to the center. In that case the resulting icositetrahedron will no longer have a rhombicuboctahedron for a dual, since the centers of the square and triangle faces of a rhombicuboctahedron are at different distances from its center.

This polyhedron is a term of a sequence of topologically related deltoidal polyhedra with face configuration V3.4.&quot;n&quot;.4; this sequence continues with tilings of the Euclidean and hyperbolic planes. These face-transitive figures have (*&quot;n&quot;32) reflectional symmetry.

<text>Dalby Söderskog (literally &quot;Dalby South Forest&quot;) is a small national park in the province of Scania in southern Sweden, situated in the municipality of Lund, near Dalby. It has an area of and consists of broadleaf forest. It was established in 1918, when it was thought to be a unique remnant of primeval forest. In fact, the area has previously been used for pasture. The ground contains much limestone and chalk, which makes the flora rich. In particular, there are many spring flowers. An earth bank of unknown origin, possibly the ruins of an ancient fort, surrounds parts of the park. The national park encompasses the southern part of Dalby hage, while the northern parts (Dalby Norreskog and Hästhagen) form a nature reserve.

<text>John Weldon &quot;J. J.&quot; Cale (December 5, 1938 – July 26, 2013) was an American guitarist, singer, and songwriter. Though he avoided the limelight, his influence as a musical artist has been acknowledged by figures such as Neil Young, Mark Knopfler, Waylon Jennings, and Eric Clapton, who described him as one of the most important artists in rock history. He is one of the originators of the Tulsa sound, a loose genre drawing on blues, rockabilly, country, and jazz.

In 2008, Cale and Clapton received a Grammy Award for their album &quot;The Road to Escondido&quot;.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Cale was born on December 5, 1938, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. He was raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and graduated from Tulsa Central High School in 1956. As well as learning to play the guitar he began studying the principles of sound engineering while still living with his parents in Tulsa, where he built himself a recording studio. After graduation he was drafted into military service, studying at the Air Force Air Training Command in Rantoul, Illinois. Cale recalled, &quot;I didn&#x27;t really want to carry a gun and do all that stuff so I joined the Air Force and what I did is I took technical training and that&#x27;s kind of where I learned a little bit about electronics.&quot; Cale&#x27;s knowledge of mixing and sound recording turned out to play an important role in creating the distinctive sound of his studio albums.

===Early musical career===
Along with a number of other young Tulsa musicians, Cale moved to Los Angeles in late 1964, where he found employment as a studio engineer as well as playing at bars and clubs. Cale first tasted success that year when singer Mel McDaniel scored a regional hit with Cale&#x27;s song &quot;Lazy Me&quot;. He managed to land a regular gig at the increasingly popular Whisky a Go Go in March 1965, where club co-owner Elmer Valentine rechristened Cale as J.J. Cale to avoid confusion with the John Cale in the Velvet Underground. In 1966, while living in the city, he cut a demo single with Liberty Records of his songs &quot;After Midnight&quot; with &quot;Slow Motion&quot; as the B side. He distributed copies of the single to his Tulsa musician friends living in Los Angeles, many of whom were successfully finding work as session musicians. &quot;After Midnight&quot; would go on to have long-term ramifications for Cale&#x27;s career when Eric Clapton recorded the song and it became a Top 20 hit. Cale found little success as a recording artist. Not being able to make enough money as a studio engineer, he sold his guitar and returned to Tulsa in late 1967. There he joined a band with Tulsa musician Don White.

===Rise to fame===

In 1970, it came to his attention that Eric Clapton had recorded Cale&#x27;s &quot;After Midnight&quot; on his debut album. Cale, who was languishing in obscurity at the time, had no knowledge of Clapton&#x27;s recording until it became a radio hit in 1970. He recalled to &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine that when he heard Clapton&#x27;s version playing on his radio, &quot;I was dirt poor, not making enough to eat and I wasn&#x27;t a young man. I was in my thirties, so I was very happy. It was nice to make some money.&quot; Cale&#x27;s version of &quot;After Midnight&quot; differs greatly from Clapton&#x27;s frenetic version, which is itself based on Cale&#x27;s own arrangement:

It was suggested to Cale that he should take advantage of this publicity and cut a record of his own. His first album, &quot;Naturally&quot;, released on October 25, 1971, established his style, described by &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Richard Cromelin as a &quot;unique hybrid of blues, folk and jazz, marked by relaxed grooves and Cale&#x27;s fluid guitar and iconic vocals. His early use of drum machines and his unconventional mixes lend a distinctive and timeless quality to his work and set him apart from the pack of Americana roots music purists.&quot; His biggest U.S. hit single, &quot;Crazy Mama&quot;, peaked at No. 22 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in 1972. In the 2005 documentary film &quot;To Tulsa and Back&quot;, Cale recounts the story of being offered the opportunity to appear on Dick Clark&#x27;s &quot;American Bandstand&quot; to promote the song, which would have moved it higher on the charts. Cale declined when told he could not bring his band to the recording and would be required to lip-sync the words.

&quot;Really&quot; was produced by Audie Ashworth, who would go on to produce for Cale until 1983. Cale&#x27;s second album further developed the &quot;Tulsa sound&quot; that he would become known for: a swampy mix of folk, jazz, shuffling country blues, and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. Although his songs have a relaxed, casual feel, Cale, who often used drum machines and layered his vocals, carefully crafted his albums, explaining to Lydia Hutchinson in 2013, &quot;I was an engineer, and I loved manipulating the sound. I love the technical side of recording. I had a recording studio back in the days when no one had a home studio. You had to rent a studio that belonged to a big conglomerate.&quot; Cale often acted as his own producer / engineer / session player. His vocals, sometimes whispery, would be buried in the mix. He attributed his unique sound to being a recording mixer and engineer, saying, &quot;Because of all the technology now you can make music yourself and a lot of people are doing that now. I started out doing that a long time ago and I found when I did that I came up with a unique sound.&quot;

Although Cale would not have the success with his music that others would, the royalties from artists recording his songs would allow him to record and tour as it suited him. He scored another windfall when Lynyrd Skynyrd recorded &quot;Call Me the Breeze&quot; for their 1974 LP &quot;Second Helping&quot;. As he put it in an interview with Russell Hall, &quot;I knew if I became too well known, my life would change drastically. On the other hand, getting some money doesn&#x27;t change things too much, except you no longer have to go to work.&quot;
His third album &quot;Okie&quot; contains some of Cale&#x27;s most recorded songs. In the same year of its release, Captain Beefheart recorded &quot;I Got the Same Old Blues&quot; (shortened to &quot;Same Old Blues&quot;) for his &quot;Bluejeans &amp; Moonbeams&quot; LP, one of the few non-originals to ever appear on a Beefheart album. The song would also be recorded by Eric Clapton, Bobby Bland, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Bryan Ferry. &quot;Cajun Moon&quot; was recorded by Herbie Mann on his 1976 album &quot;Surprises&quot; with vocals by Cissy Houston, by Poco on their album &quot;Cowboys &amp; Englishmen&quot;, and by Randy Crawford on &quot;Naked and True&quot; (1995).

The 1976 album &quot;Troubadour&quot; includes &quot;Cocaine,&quot; a song that would be a major hit for Eric Clapton the following year. In the 2004 documentary &quot;To Tulsa and Back&quot;, Cale recalled, &quot;I wrote &#x27;Cocaine&#x27;, and I&#x27;m a big fan of Mose Allison...So I had written the song in a Mose Allison bag, kind of cocktail jazz kind of swing...And Audie said, &#x27;That&#x27;s really a good song, John, but you oughta make that a little more rock and roll, a little more commercial.&#x27; I said, &#x27;Great, man.&#x27; So I went back and recut it again as the thing you heard.&quot; The song&#x27;s meaning is ambiguous, although Eric Clapton describes it as an anti-drug song. He has called the song &quot;quite cleverly anti-cocaine&quot;, noting:

By the time he recorded &quot;5&quot; in 1979, Cale had also met singer and guitarist Christine Lakeland, and the LP marks her first appearance on his albums. In the 2005 documentary &quot;To Tulsa and Back&quot;, Lakeland says they met backstage at a prison benefit show featuring B.B. King and Waylon Jennings. Cale and Lakeland would later marry. As William Ruhlmann observes in his AllMusic review of the album, &quot;As Cale&#x27;s influence on others expanded, he just continued to turn out the occasional album of bluesy, minor-key tunes. This one was even sparer than usual, with the artist handling bass as well as guitar on many tracks. Listened to today, it sounds so much like a Dire Straits album, it&#x27;s scary.&quot; The release of &quot;5&quot; coincided with a notable live session with Leon Russell recorded at Russell&#x27;s Paradise Studios in June 1979 in Los Angeles. The previously unseen footage features several tracks from &quot;5&quot;, including &quot;Sensitive Kind,&quot; &quot;Lou-Easy-Ann,&quot; &quot;Fate of a Fool,&quot; &quot;Boilin&#x27; Pot,&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry Sister.&quot; Lakeland also performs with Cale&#x27;s band. While living in California in the late 1960s, Cale worked in Russell&#x27;s studio as an engineer. The footage was officially released in 2003 as &quot;J.J. Cale featuring Leon Russell: In Session at the Paradise Studios&quot;.

===1980s===
Cale moved to California in 1980 and became a recluse, living in a trailer without a telephone. In 2013, he reflected, &quot;…I knew what fame entailed. I tried to back off from that. I had seen some of the people I was working with forced to be careful because people wouldn&#x27;t leave them alone… What I&#x27;m saying, basically, is I was trying to get the fortune without having the fame.&quot; &quot;Shades&quot;, which continued Cale&#x27;s tradition of giving his albums one word titles, was recorded in various studios in Nashville and Los Angeles. It boasts an impressive list of top shelf session musicians, including Hal Blaine and Carol Kaye of the Wrecking Crew, James Burton, Jim Keltner, Reggie Young, Glen D. Hardin, Ken Buttrey, and Leon Russell, among many others. 1982&#x27;s &quot;Grasshopper&quot; was recorded in studios in Nashville and North Hollywood, and while a more polished production, it continues Cale&#x27;s exploration into a variety of musical styles that would become known as Americana.

His 1983 album &quot;#8&quot; was poorly received, and he asked to be released from his contract with PolyGram. Lyrically speaking, with the exception of &quot;Takin&#x27; Care of Business&quot;, the subject matter on &quot;#8&quot; is unremittingly grim. The cynical &quot;Money Talks&quot; (&quot;You&#x27;d be surprised the friends you can buy with small change…&quot;), &quot;Hard Times&quot;, &quot;Unemployment&quot; and &quot;Livin&#x27; Here Too&quot; deal with harsh economic woes and dissatisfaction with life in general, while the provocative &quot;Reality&quot; is about using drugs to escape many of the problems he chronicles on the album, singing &quot;One toke of reefer, a little cocaine, one shot of morphine and things begin to change,&quot; and adding &quot;When reality leaves, so do the blues.&quot; When later asked how he had spent the 1980s he replied: &quot;Mowing the lawn and listening to Van Halen and rap.&quot;

After making a name for himself in the 1970s as a songwriter, Cale&#x27;s own recording career came to a halt in the mid-1980s. Although he scored a handful of minor hits, Cale was indifferent to publicity, preferring to avoid the spotlight, so his albums never sold in high numbers.

1989&#x27;s &quot;Travel-Log&quot; was the first solo album Cale produced himself without long-time producer Audie Ashworth, although Ashworth co-wrote the opening track &quot;Shanghaid&quot; with Cale. While the album has a travel theme, with titles like &quot;Tijuana&quot; and &quot;New Orleans&quot;, Cale insisted he did not set out to make a concept album, and only recognized it after he picked the songs:

In 1990 he explained in an interview, &quot;In 1984 I was with a different record company, and it didn&#x27;t seem to be working out too good, so I asked to get out of my contract, and that took a couple of years to shuffle the paper around. Then when I got through doin&#x27; that, I thought I&#x27;d take a little break from recording; maybe go in once or twice a year and record somethin&#x27; I&#x27;d written.&quot;

===1990s===
The 1992 album &quot;Number 10&quot; was Cale&#x27;s second LP for Silvertone. Compared to his albums in the 1970s and 1980s, he employed fewer session players for this album, yet still achieved his signature sound. Notoriously wary of the spotlight, Cale quietly went about his own business his way, delivering his own unique blend of musical styles augmented by his laid-back vocal delivery. Ironically, in an era of grunge and the &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; trends, Cale became immersed in electronics and synthesizers. &quot;I did the unplugged, live kind of thing in the &#x27;70&#x27;s and the &#x27;80&#x27;s,&quot; he told one interviewer. &quot;I&#x27;ve gone to the other direction now that all that&#x27;s become popular. Been there done that! They didn&#x27;t call it unplugged in those days but that is what it was…There is a fascination about electronics…It is an art form in itself.&quot; 1994&#x27;s &quot;Closer to You&quot; is best remembered for the change in sound from Cale&#x27;s previous albums due to the prominence of synthesizers, with Cale employing the instrument on five of the twelve songs. Although the use of synthesizers may have seemed like a left turn for fans used to his laidback, rootsy sound, it was not new; Cale had used synthesizers on his 1976 &quot;Troubadour&quot; album. In an interview with &quot;Vintage Guitar&quot; in 2004, Cale acknowledged the dismay some fans felt, recalling:

Produced by Cale, &quot;Guitar Man&quot; differs from the albums he made in the 1970s and early 1980s in that while those records featured numerous top shelf session players, Cale provided the instrumentation on &quot;Guitar Man&quot; himself, augmented by wife Christine Lakeland on guitar and background vocals and drummer James Cruce on the opener &quot;Death in the Wilderness.&quot; In his AllMusic review of the LP, Thom Owens writes, &quot;Although he has recorded &quot;Guitar Man&quot; as a one-man band effort, it sounds remarkably relaxed and laid-back, like it was made with a seasoned bar band.&quot; In assessing the album, rock writer Brian Wise of &quot;Rhythm Magazine&quot; commented, &quot;&#x27;Lowdown&#x27; is typical Cale shuffle, &#x27;Days Go By&#x27; gives a jazzy feel to a song about smoking a certain substance while the traditional &#x27;Old Blue&#x27; reprises a song that many might first have heard with The Byrds version during the Gram Parsons era.&quot; After &quot;Guitar Man&quot;, Cale would take a second hiatus and not release another album for eight years.

===Later career===
Between 1996 and 2003, Cale released no new music but admiration for his work and musicianship only grew among his fans and admirers. In his 2003 biography &quot;Shakey&quot;, Neil Young remarked, &quot;Of all the players I ever heard, it&#x27;s gotta be [Jimi] Hendrix and J. J. Cale who are the best electric guitar players.&quot; In the 2005 documentary &quot;To Tulsa and Back: On Tour with J.J. Cale&quot;, Cale&#x27;s guitar style is characterized by Eric Clapton as &quot;really, really minimal&quot;, adding &quot;it&#x27;s all about finesse&quot;. Mark Knopfler was also effusive in his praise for the Oklahoma troubadour, but Cale&#x27;s early 90s experimental synth-heavy output left him at odds with the music industry. 2004&#x27;s &quot;To Tulsa and Back&quot; reunited him with long-time producer Audie Ashworth, as he recalled to Dan Forte:

The album returns to the style and sound Cale became famous for – a mix of laid-back shuffles, jazzy chords, and bluesy rock and roll with layered vocals – but it also embraces technology, resulting in a cleaner sound than on Cale&#x27;s earlier albums. Lyrically, Cale makes a rare foray into political songwriting with &quot;The Problem,&quot; an indictment of then-President George W. Bush with lines like, &quot;The man in charge, he don&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s doing, he don&#x27;t know the world has changed.&quot; &quot;Stone River&quot; is an understated protest song about the water crisis in the West.

In 2004, Eric Clapton held the Crossroads Guitar Festival, a three-day festival in Dallas, Texas. Among the performers was J. J. Cale, giving Clapton the opportunity to ask Cale to produce an album for him. The two ended up recording the album together, releasing it as &quot;The Road to Escondido&quot;. A number of high-profile musicians also agreed to work on the album, including Billy Preston, Derek Trucks, Taj Mahal, Pino Palladino, John Mayer, Steve Jordan, and Doyle Bramhall II. In a coup, whether intended or not, the entire John Mayer Trio participated on this album in one capacity or another. Escondido is a city in San Diego County near Cale&#x27;s home at the time located in the small, unincorporated town of Valley Center, California. Eric Clapton owned a mansion in Escondido in the 1980s and early 1990s. The road referenced in the album&#x27;s title is named Valley Center Road. The album won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album in 2008, with Cale writing 11 of the 14 tracks on the album, with two cuts, &quot;Any Way the Wind Blows&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry Sister&quot;, being re-recordings of songs that Cale recorded previously in the 1970s. In a 2014 interview with NPR, Clapton spoke at length about Cale&#x27;s influence on his music:

Clapton, who toured with Delaney &amp; Bonnie in 1969, recalled in the 2005 documentary &quot;To Tulsa and Back&quot;, &quot;Delaney Bramlett is the one that was responsible to get me singing. He was the one who turned me on to the Tulsa community. Bramlett produced my first solo album and &quot;After Midnight&quot; was on it, and those [Tulsa] players played on it...&quot;461 Ocean Boulevard&quot; was my kind of homage to J.J.&quot;

===Death===
Cale died at the age of 74 in San Diego, California, on July 26, 2013, following a heart attack. &quot;Stay Around&quot;, a posthumous album made of previously unreleased material, was released on April 26, 2019.

<text>Lysimachia ( ) is a genus consisting of 182 accepted species of flowering plants traditionally classified in the family Primulaceae. Based on a molecular phylogenetic study it was transferred to the family Myrsinaceae, before this family was later merged into the Primulaceae.

==Characteristics==
&quot;Lysimachia&quot; species often have yellow flowers, and grow vigorously. They tend to grow in damp conditions. Several species within &quot;Lysimachia&quot; are commonly called loosestrife, although this name is also used for plants within the genus &quot;Lythrum&quot;. The genus is named in honor of Lysimachus, a king of ancient Sicily, who is said to have calmed a mad ox by feeding it a member of the genus.

&quot;Lysimachia&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some butterflies and moths, including the dot moth, grey pug, lime-speck pug, small angle shades, and v-pug.

== Specialized pollinators ==
Bees of the genus &quot;Macropis&quot; are specialized to pollinate oil-producing &quot;Lysimachia&quot; plants. These bees use exclusively &quot;Lysimachia&quot; floral oils for building their nests and provisioning cells. &quot;Lysimachia&quot; floral-specific chemicals are strong attractors for &quot;Macropis nuda&quot; and &quot;Macropis fulvipes&quot; bees that are seldom found in other plant genera. 

==Fossil record==
Several fossil seeds of &quot;Lysimachia &quot; sp. have been described from middle Miocene strata of the Fasterholt area near Silkeborg in Central Jutland, Denmark. †&quot;Lysimachia nikitinii&quot; seed fossils have been collected from Pliocene strata of south eastern Belarus. The fossils are most similar to seeds of the East Asian &quot;Lysimachia davurica&quot;.

==Selected species==

282 species are accepted. Selected species include:

<text>The Imperial Seal of Japan or National Seal of Japan, also called the &#x27;, &#x27; or , is the &quot;mon&quot; used by the Emperor of Japan and members of the Imperial Family. 

It is one of the national seals of Japan and is used in a manner similar to a national coat of arms of Japan, e.g., on Japanese passports. The Japanese government uses a different emblem, the Paulownia seal.

== History ==
During the Meiji period (1868–1912), no one was permitted to use the Imperial Seal except the Emperor of Japan, who used a 16-petalled chrysanthemum with sixteen tips of another row of petals showing behind the first row. Therefore, each member of the Imperial family used a slightly modified version of the seal. Shinto shrines either displayed the imperial seal or incorporated elements of the seal into their own tag.

Earlier in Japanese history, when Emperor Go-Daigo, who tried to break the power of the shogunate in 1333, was exiled, he adopted the seventeen-petalled chrysanthemum in order to differentiate himself from the Northern Court&#x27;s Emperor Kōgon, who kept the imperial 16-petalled &quot;mon&quot;.

== Description ==
The symbol is a yellow or orange chrysanthemum with black or red outlines and background. A central disc is surrounded by a front set of 16 petals. A rear set of 16 petals are half staggered in relation to the front set and are visible at the edges of the flower. An example of the chrysanthemum being used is in the badge for the Order of the Chrysanthemum. 

Other members of the Imperial Family use a version with 14 single petals, while a form with 16 single petals is used for orders, passports, Diet members&#x27; pins, and other items that carry or represent the authority of the Emperor. The Imperial Seal is also used on the standards of the Imperial Family.

<doc id="723377" wikidata="Q91931" url="?curid=723377" title="Blame!">
<text>Blame! (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese science fiction manga series written and illustrated by Tsutomu Nihei. It was published by Kodansha in the manga magazine &quot;Monthly Afternoon&quot; from 1997 to 2003, with its chapters collected in ten volumes. A six-part original net animation (ONA) by Group TAC was produced in 2003, with a seventh episode included on the DVD release. An anime film adaptation by Polygon Pictures was released as a Netflix original in May 2017.

== Synopsis ==
=== Setting ===

&quot;Blame!&quot; is set in &quot;The City&quot;, a gigantic megastructure occupying much of what used to be the Solar System. Its exact size is unknown, but Tsutomu Nihei suggested its diameter to be at least equal to Jupiter&#x27;s orbit, or about 1.6 billion kilometers (a detail suggested in the manga by having Killy cross an empty, spherical room roughly the size of Jupiter, suggesting that it had housed the planet before its disassembly.)

According to the prequel manga &quot;NOiSE&quot;, the City began as a much smaller structure erected on Earth by the robotic &quot;Builders&quot;. Humanity controlled the Builders through the Netsphere, an advanced computer network whose access was restricted to human use only, and authenticated by a genetic marker known as the Net Terminal Gene. Anyone who attempted to access the Netsphere without the marker was eliminated by an automated security force known as the Safeguards. However, a terrorist cult known as &quot;the Order&quot; released a retrovirus that deleted the Net Terminal Gene from all humans, thus cutting off their access to the Netsphere and their control over the Builders. Without specific instructions, the Builders began to build chaotically and indefinitely, while the Safeguards&#x27; programming degraded into a mandate to kill all humans without the Net Terminal Gene, whether they wanted to access the Netsphere or not.

By the time of the events of the manga, the City has come to resemble a series of layered, concentric Dyson spheres, filled with haphazard architecture and largely devoid of life. These layers compose the supporting scaffold of the City, known as the Megastructure; the underside of each layer periodically illuminates the overside of the one below to provide a day–night cycle. The Megastructure is extremely durable, with only a direct blast from a Gravitational Beam Emitter being able to penetrate it. Travel between layers is challenging, both due to the City&#x27;s chaotic layout and the risk of provoking a Safeguard response; due to the size of the City, it is also extremely time-consuming, despite such amenities as elevators that can reach relativistic speeds. The buildings on each layer are largely uninhabited, although scattered human and post-human tribes, rogue Builders, hostile Safeguards, and Silicon Life can be found throughout the entire City.

=== Plot ===

Killy, a silent loner possessing an incredibly powerful weapon known as a Gravitational Beam Emitter, wanders a vast technological world known as &quot;The City&quot;. He is searching for Net Terminal Genes, a (possibly) extinct genetic marker that allows humans to access the &quot;Netsphere&quot;, a sort of computerized control network for The City. The City is an artificial structure of immense volume, separated into massive &quot;floors&quot; by nearly-impenetrable barriers known as &quot;Megastructure&quot;. The City is inhabited by scattered human and transhuman tribes as well as hostile cyborgs known as Silicon Life. The Net Terminal Genes appear to be the key to halting the unhindered, chaotic expansion of the Megastructure, as well as a way of stopping the murderous robot horde known as the Safeguard from destroying all of humanity.

Along the way, Killy meets and joins forces with a resourceful engineer named Cibo. Their quest is indirectly supported by the City&#x27;s Authority, which is unable to stop the Safeguard from opposing them. Together, Killy and Cibo meet a young girl named Sanakan and a tribe of human warriors called the Electro-Fishers. Killy&#x27;s cybernetic abilities are restored after he is attacked by a high-level Safeguard, which turns out to have been Sanakan in disguise. She transforms into her Safeguard form and attacks the Electro-Fishers&#x27; village when discovered. Killy and Cibo defend the Electro-Fishers by bringing them to the cylindrical megastructure of Toha Heavy Industries. Here they meet Mensab, an AI independent from the Administration, and her guardian Seu, a human. The megastructure is ultimately destroyed due to attacks by Silicon Life and Sanakan, but Mensab is able to give Cibo a sample of Seu&#x27;s DNA.

Killy and Cibo next come to a region of the City ruled by a group of Silicon Life, where they ally with a pair of &quot;provisional Safeguards&quot; named Dhomochevsky and Iko. Seu&#x27;s DNA is stolen by the Silicon leader, Davine, who uses it to access the Netsphere. Dhomochevsky sacrifices his life to kill Davine, but not before she downloads an extremely powerful Level 9 Safeguard from the Netsphere which manifests in Cibo&#x27;s body. The Cibo Safeguard destroys the entire region.

14 years later, Killy&#x27;s body repairs itself from the attack and he continues his journey. He meets a human whose physical body is dead and whose consciousness is preserved in a device resembling a USB stick, and takes her with him. Upon eventually finding Cibo again he discovers that she, having lost her memory, was eventually rescued by Sanakan, who is now allied with the Authority against the rest of the Safeguard. Cibo&#x27;s body is incubating a &quot;sphere&quot; which contains both her and Sanakan’s genetic information. Ultimately, Cibo and Sanakan both die in a final confrontation with the Safeguard, but Killy survives and preserves the sphere. The digital consciousness Killy picked up earlier is seen in human form in the Netsphere, recounting Killy’s quest to other entities an unknown amount of time in the future. She is told that Killy’s journey to the outside of the City will be longer and harder than anything that came before.
Killy finally reaches the edge of the City, where he is shot in the head and incapacitated, but a flood of water carries him to the surface of the City where stars are visible and the sphere begins to glow. In the final page, Killy is seen fighting in the corridors of the City again, alongside a small child wearing a hazmat suit.

== Media ==
=== Manga ===
&quot;Blame!&quot; was written and illustrated by Tsutomu Nihei. The series ran in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Monthly Afternoon&quot; from 1997 to 2003. Its chapters were collected in ten volumes by Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Afternoon KC&quot; imprint. 

In February 2005, Tokyopop announced that it has licensed &quot;Blame!&quot; for U.S. distribution, with publication beginning in August 2005. After releasing the final volume in 2007, the series has gone out of print with several volumes becoming increasingly hard to find. In February 2016, Vertical announced that it had licensed the series.

==== Volumes ====
; &quot;Tankōbon&quot; release





; Master&#x27;s edition



==== &quot;Blame Academy!&quot; ====
 is a spin-off series of &quot;Blame!&quot;. Set in the same &quot;City&quot; as &quot;Blame!&quot;, it is a parody and comedy about various characters in the main &quot;Blame!&quot; story in a traditional Japanese school setting. Various elements in the main &quot;Blame!&quot; story are being parodied, including the relationship between Killy and Cibo, and Dhomochevsky and Iko. It was irregularly published in &quot;Monthly Afternoon&quot;. A compilation volume, titled &quot;Blame Academy! and So On&quot; was published by Kodansha on September 19, 2008.

==== &quot;Blame!2&quot; ====
, subtitled , is a full-color, 16-page one-shot. Like &quot;NSE: NetSphere Engineer&quot;, &quot;Blame!2&quot; is a sequel to the original &quot;Blame!&quot;, taking place at a point in the distant future. It was published March 21, 2008 in the second volume of Kodansha&#x27;s Weekly Morning Special Edition magazine, &quot;Mandala&quot;. This one-shot was also compiled in one volume with &quot;Blame Academy!&quot;, titled &quot;Blame Academy! and So On&quot; in 2008. Set an undefined but long time after the events of &quot;Blame!&quot;, it follows an incarnation of Pcell. After Killy&#x27;s success in &quot;Blame!&quot;, humanity has begun to dominate The City once more and began wiping out most Silicon Life. After P-cell escapes the extinction as the sole survivor of her kind (which is beset by humanity and the Safeguard), she is saved from death by Killy. She eventually makes it to the edge of the City, where it is implied she travels to another planet and restarts Silicon Life civilization using the stored gene-data of her dead companions.

==== &quot;NSE: NetSphere Engineer&quot; ====
 is a sequel to &quot;Blame!&quot;. It was originally published as a one-shot in the &quot;Bessatsu Morning&quot; magazine. This one-shot was compiled in one volume with &quot;Blame Academy!&quot;, titled &quot;Blame Academy! and So On&quot; in 2008. &quot;NSE: NetSphere Engineer&quot; follows a &quot;Dismantler&quot;, a NetSphere Engineer in charge of disabling the remaining nexus towers that summon Safeguard interference upon its detection of humans without the net terminal genes. Like &quot;Blame!2&quot;, NSE is set in a long but undefined time period after the events of &quot;Blame!&quot;. However, it is implied it is even later than &quot;Blame!2&quot; as Safeguards are now very rare encounters.

==== &quot;Blame! Denki Ryōshi Kiki Kaisō Dasshutsu Sakusen&quot; ====
A manga adaptation of the &quot;Blame!&quot; film illustrated by Kotaro Sekine was serialized in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Monthly Shōnen Sirius&quot; from April 26 to October 26, 2017, and collected into one volume, released on February 9, 2018.

===&quot;Blame!: The Ancient Terminal City&quot;===
A trailer revealing a special &quot;Blame!&quot; short, appearing at the beginning of the 8th episode of &quot;Knights of Sidonia: Battle for Planet Nine&quot; (the second season of the anime adaptation of &quot;Knights of Sidonia&quot;), was released in November 2014. The episode aired in May 2015. The short is contextualized as a TV program that the people of Sidonia tune in for.

=== Film ===

Plans for a full-length CG animated film were announced in 2007. However, this proposed CG film project was not released before Micott and Basara (the studio hired) filed for bankruptcy in 2011. It was announced in November 2015 that the series would get an anime theatrical film adaptation. The film is directed by Hiroyuki Seshita and written by Tsutomu Nihei and Sadayuki Murai, with animation by Polygon Pictures and character designs by Yuki Moriyama. It was released globally as a Netflix original on May 20, 2017.

On October 5, 2017, Viz Media announced at their New York Comic Con panel that they licensed the home video rights to the film. They released it on DVD and Blu-ray on March 27, 2018.

== Reception ==
Jarred Pine from Mania.com commented &quot;[it] is not an easy task&quot; to talk about the story in the first volume as &quot;it leaves quite a gamut of questions open for the reader, nothing on the surface to give the reader a sense of direction or purpose&quot;. Pine said &quot;Blame!&quot; doesn&#x27;t have a mass appeal and &quot;there will be quite a strong line dividing those who love and hate Nihei&#x27;s unique and convoluted cyberpunk journey&quot;.

In 2006, the Tokyopop distribution was nominated for a Harvey Award in the category &quot;Best American Edition of Foreign Material&quot;.

<text>Abies&quot; × &quot;borisii-regis (Bulgarian fir) is a hybrid species of fir native to the mountains of the Balkan Peninsula in Bulgaria, northern Greece, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Albania and Serbia. It occurs at altitudes of , on mountains with an annual rainfall of over .

It is a large evergreen coniferous tree growing to (exceptionally ) tall and with a trunk diameter of up to . The leaves are needle-like, flattened, long and wide by thick, glossy dark green above, and with two blue-white bands of stomata below. The tip of the leaf is variable, usually pointed, but sometimes slightly notched at the tip, particularly on slow-growing shoots on older trees. The cones are long and broad, with about 150–200 scales, each scale with an exserted bract and two winged seeds; they disintegrate when mature to release the seeds.

It is closely related to (and in many respects intermediate between) silver fir to the north in central Europe, Greek fir to the south in southern Greece, and Nordmann fir to the east in northern Turkey. Some botanists treat it as a natural hybrid between silver Fir and Greek fir, while others treat it as a variety of silver fir, as &quot;Abies alba&quot; var. &quot;acutifolia&quot;. Another synonym is &quot;Abies pardei&quot;.

The scientific name honours Tsar Boris III of Bulgaria, during whose reign it was described as a new species in 1925. The name is sometimes cited without a hyphen (&quot;Abies borisiiregis&quot;), though under the provisions of ICBN Article 60.9 the hyphen is to be retained.

<doc id="723391" wikidata="Q1450279" url="?curid=723391" title="Flying Shark">
<text>Flying Shark, known as Sky Shark in North America, is a vertically scrolling shooter arcade video game originally developed by Toaplan and published in 1987 by Taito in Japan, Romstar in North America and Electrocoin in Europe. Controlling the titular biplane, the players must fight endless waves of military vehicles while avoiding collision with their projectiles and other obstacles. The plane has a powerful bomb at its disposal that can clear a portion of the screen of bullets and damage enemies when fired. It was the third shoot &#x27;em up game from Toaplan, and their eighth video game overall.

&quot;Flying Shark&quot; was ported to multiple systems, each version created by different third-party developers. The game proved to be a success for Toaplan among players in Japanese arcades and garnered mostly positive reception from western critics, but the game was met with mixed response from magazines, specifically the home conversions. In 1989 the sequel &quot;Fire Shark&quot; was released. The rights to the title are owned by Tatsujin, a Japanese company formed by Masahiro Yuge.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Flying Shark&quot; is a military-themed vertically scrolling shoot &#x27;em up game in which players take control of the titular biplane through five increasingly difficult levels in order to defeat an assortment of military enemy forces like tanks, battleships, airplanes and artillery as the main objective. The title initially appears to be very standard, as players control their plane over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until a runway is reached. Players have only two weapons at their disposal: the standard shot that travels a max distance of the screen&#x27;s height and three bombs.

The bombs are powerful weapons capable of obliterating any enemy caught within its blast radius. Various items are scattered through every stage that appear by destroying certain enemies: Shooting down colored waves of enemy planes spawn items like &quot;S&quot; power-up icons, point bonuses and extra lives. Certain enemies on the ground spawn &quot;B&quot; icons that increases the player&#x27;s bomb stock when destroyed. Every time the player lands at a runway beyond the first takeoff, the amount of bombs multiply 3000 points to the player&#x27;s total score.

Players are given three lives initially and bonus lives are awarded at 50000 points and thereafter. The game employs a checkpoint system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying. Getting hit by enemy fire will result in losing a live, as well as a penalty of decreasing the plane&#x27;s firepower to his original state and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. Completing the last stage restarts the game with the second loop increasing in difficulty.

== Development ==
&quot;Flying Shark&quot;″s creation process and history was recounted through various Japanese publications by composers Masahiro Yuge and Tatsuya Uemura, both of which collaborated with the soundtrack and marked the first time Toaplan made use of FM synthesis. Yuge stated that the basic structure for the game was already decided during development of &quot;Slap Fight&quot; by pursuing the excitement of shooting and dodging, settling on the bomb and shot system, claiming that firing a bomb relieved stress from players. Yuge also stated the theme for the title was a realistic depiction of war that would involve players emotionally, as the development team had the atmosphere portrayed by the 1979 epic war film &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; in their mind. The team also took a company trip to Thailand and wanted to convey the mood of the country&#x27;s scenery with the backgrounds, with Yuge stating that the decision of scrolling said backgrounds left and right was to immerse players more with the game&#x27;s world, though he expressed desire in making stages longer.

&quot;Flying Shark&quot; was also the first project by Toaplan to make use of the Motorola 68000 microprocessor and due to the improved hardware, it allowed the team with displaying more sprites on-screen, but the increased hardware also brought issues such as difficulties with making FM sounds and enemy planes aiming their shots at players more accurately. The team wanted to make a title where players could clear it via tricks and knowledge accumulated through gameplay. When asked about the increasing bullet speed and starting at the second stage during higher loops, Uemura claimed that this design choice was made due to the first stage being made for beginning players and that the bullet speed would return to normal after reaching an overflow. Despite being published by Taito, Uemura stated that the publisher allowed them to reveal the project was made by Toaplan.

== Release ==
&quot;Flying Shark&quot; was first released by Taito in Japan on March 14, 1987. It was then released across arcades worldwide the same month, by Romstar in North America under the name &quot;Sky Shark&quot; and by Electrocoin in Europe. In November 1988, an album containing music from the title was co-published exclusively in Japan by Scitron and Pony Canyon.

&quot;Flying Shark&quot; was converted to multiple platforms by various third-party developers including the Commodore 64 (1987), ZX Spectrum (1987), Amiga (1988), Amstrad CPC (1988), Atari ST (1988), Nintendo Entertainment System (1989), MS-DOS (1989), X68000 (1991) and the FM Towns (1993). Most of the microcomputer ports were only released in Europe or North America. Two version were developed for the Commodore 64; one for Europe and another for North America. The NES version, which was a North American exclusive, is notable for being one of the earliest soundtracks composed by Tim Follin on the system. The arcade version of the game was included in the &quot;Hishou Same! Same! Same!&quot; compilation for Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 as part of M2&#x27;s &quot;Toaplan Arcade Garage&quot; label. &quot;Flying Shark&quot; was included as part of the &quot;Toaplan Arcade 1&quot; compilation for Evercade.

== Reception ==

According to Tatsuya Uemura, &quot;Flying Shark&quot; proved to be more popular than &quot;Twin Cobra&quot; and was &quot;the biggest&quot; hit for Toaplan. In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed it on their April 15, 1987 issue as being the fourth most-popular arcade game of the month. It went on to become Japans&#x27;s second highest-grossing table arcade game of 1987 (below &quot;Arkanoid&quot;) and fourth highest-grossing arcade conversion kit of 1988.

&quot;Commodore User&quot;″s Nick Kelly gave the coin-op a 9 out of 10 score. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;″s Clare Edgeley gave an overall positive outlook to the arcade original. &quot;Sinclair User&quot;″s Tim Rolf stated that &quot;it is difficult, but Taito has made it so awesomely playable that the difficulty is a real joy&quot;. In contrast, Teresa Maughan gave a more mixed outlook to the arcade version. &quot;Edge&quot; magazine praised the gameplay, visuals and music, claiming that &quot;Toaplan arguably perfected the vertical shoot &#x27;em up with this early effort&quot;, though the publication lamented it never received a proper conversion. In a 2010 interview, composer Manabu Namiki regarded &quot;Flying Shark&quot; as one of the shoot &#x27;em up games he enjoys the most.

Yaegaki Nachi of Japanese magazine &quot;Oh!X&quot; gave the X68000 conversion a positive review. German magazine &quot;MAN!AC&quot; gave the FM Towns Marty port a 47% score.

== Legacy ==
A sequel, titled &quot;Fire Shark&quot; (known in Japan as &quot;Same! Same! Same!&quot;) was launched in 1989. Its main character, Schneider, later re-appears in &quot;Batsugun&quot;. In more recent years, the rights to &quot;Flying Shark&quot;, its successor and many other IPs from Toaplan are now owned by Tatsujin, a company named after &quot;Truxton&quot;″s Japanese title that was founded in 2017 by former Toaplan employee Masahiro Yuge, and is part of Embracer Group since 2022.

<text>The Panchathan Record Inn and AM Studios is composer/music director A. R. Rahman&#x27;s studio on his street at Kodambakkam, Chennai in Tamil Nadu.

== History ==
The Inn was established in 1989, attached to Rahman&#x27;s backyard, and developed into one of the most developed studios in Asia. Located very close to his home, it houses equipment like the Euphonix System 5 Audio Mixing system. The studio has been designed by Studio 440 and the state of the art equipment is from Daxco Digital. His team includes acclaimed sound engineers of Chennai film music including the late H. Sridhar, Mani Sharma, S. Sivakumar, Aditya Modi, A. S. Laxmi Narayanan, S. Saisarvajith, J. Ravinder, his manager Noell James, and Co-Ordinator Samidurai.

In 2005, A. R. Rahman built a new studio associating with Mani Sharma, part of a redevelopment and extension project of the inn, called AM Studios. Mixing takes place at both the inn and the commercial A. M Studios for films. Other music directors use AM Studios for recording. Rahman also owns newly built KM Musiq Studios in Mumbai, London and Los Angeles where he has also mixed scores.

In 2013, AM Studios acquired a Barco Auro 11.1 system to enhance its 3D sound recording capabilities. The sound mixing for the Tamil film &quot;Maryan&quot; whose score was composed by A. R. Rahman himself.

<doc id="723407" wikidata="Q763075" url="?curid=723407" title="Xanthosoma">
<text>Xanthosoma is a genus of flowering plants in the arum family, Araceae. The genus is native to tropical America but widely cultivated and naturalized in other tropical regions. Several are grown for their starchy corms, an important food staple of tropical regions, known variously as &quot;malanga&quot;, &quot;otoy&quot;, &quot;otoe&quot;, cocoyam (or new cocoyam), &quot;tannia&quot;, &quot;tannier&quot;, &quot;yautía&quot;, &quot;macabo&quot;, &quot;ocumo&quot;, &quot;macal&quot;, &quot;taioba&quot;, &quot;dasheen&quot;, &quot;quequisque&quot;, &quot;ʻape&quot; and (in Papua New Guinea) as Singapore taro (&quot;taro kongkong&quot;). Many other species, including especially &quot;Xanthosoma roseum&quot;, are used as ornamental plants; in popular horticultural literature these species may be known as ‘ape due to resemblance to the true Polynesian ʻape, &quot;Alocasia macrorrhizos&quot;, or as elephant ear from visual resemblance of the leaf to an elephant&#x27;s ear. Sometimes the latter name is also applied to members in the closely related genera &quot;Caladium&quot;, &quot;Colocasia&quot; (taro), and &quot;Alocasia&quot;.
The leaves of most &quot;Xanthosoma&quot; species are long, sagittate (arrowhead-shaped) or subdivided into three or as many as 18 segments. Unlike the leaves of &quot;Colocasia&quot;, those of &quot;Xanthosoma&quot; are usually not peltate- the upper v-notch extends into the point of attachment of the leaf petiole to the blade.

== Reproduction ==
The inflorescence in &quot;Xanthosoma&quot; is composed of a spadix with pistillate flowers at the base, a belt of sterile flowers offered as a reward for pollinators in the middle and staminate flowers on the upper part. Prior to opening, the inflorescence is enclosed within a leaf-like spathe. When the inflorescence is ready to open, the upper part of the spathe opens and exposes the staminate area of the spadix; the basal area of the spathe remains closed, forming a spacious chamber (i.e., the spathe tube) that encloses the pistillate and sterile flowers ().

The inflorescences last for two nights and are protogynous in some, but not all species. They change from the pistillate phase that attracts pollinators on the night it opens, to a staminate phase on the second night, when pollen is shed. When the inflorescence opens, it produces heat and releases a sweet scent attracting its pollinators, dynastine beetles (&quot;Cyclocephala&quot; spp.). Dynastines arrive covered with pollen from another inflorescence and remain in the spathe tube for 24 hours, pollinating the pistillate flowers as they feed on the sterile area of the spadix. On the second night, they come out of the tube and walk over the staminate flowers, getting covered with pollen, and then flying to a recently opened inflorescence nearby. ().
Fruit maturation takes several months. Fruits start to develop within the shelter of the spathe tube. When the infructescence
is mature, in some species, it arches back and downwards. In other species, it stays erect. Then, the tissue of the spathe tube rolls outwards, exhibiting the bright orange fruits and the velvety pink inner spathe surface.

==== Deprecated ====
*&quot;Phyllotaenium lindenii&quot; (as &quot;X. lindenii&quot; )

=== Etymology ===
The name is derived from the Greek words (), meaning &#x27;yellow&#x27;, and (), meaning &#x27;body&#x27;. It refers to the stigma or yellow inner tissues.

== Uses ==
Domestication of &quot;Xanthosoma&quot; species (especially &quot;X. sagittifolium&quot; but also &quot;X. atrovirens&quot;, &quot;X. violaceum&quot;, &quot;X. maffaffa&quot; and others) is thought to have originated in northern lowland South America, then spread to the Antilles and Mesoamerica. Today, &quot;Xanthosoma&quot; is still grown in all those regions, but is especially popular in Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, where it is used in &quot;alcapurrias&quot; or boiled. It is grown in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana and Jamaica to make the popular &quot;callaloo&quot; dish, and in St. Kitts and Nevis to make tannia fritters.

It is also grown in West Africa, now a major producer, where it can be used as a replacement for yams in a popular regional dish called &quot;fufu&quot;.

&quot;Xanthosoma&quot; is also grown as a crop in the Philippines.

Traditionally, &quot;Xanthosoma&quot; has been a subsistence crop with excess sold at local markets, but in the United States, large numbers of Latin American immigrants have created a market for commercial production. In general, production has yet to meet demand in some areas. In Polynesia, &quot;Alocasia macrorrhizos&quot; (&quot;‘ape&quot;) was considered a famine food, used only in the event of failure of the much preferred taro (&quot;kalo&quot;) crop. After having been introduced to Hawaii in the 1920s from South America, &quot;Xanthosoma&quot; has naturalized and has become more common than &quot;A. macrorrhizos&quot;, and has been given the same name, &quot;ʻape&quot;.

The typical &quot;Xanthosoma&quot; plant has a growing cycle of 9 to 11 months, during which time it produces a large stem called a corm, this surrounded by smaller edible &quot;cormels&quot; about the size of potatoes. These cormels (like the corm) are rich in starch. Their taste has been described as earthy and nutty, and they are a common ingredient in soups and stews. They may also be eaten grilled, fried, or puréed. The young, unfurled leaves of some varieties can be eaten as boiled leafy vegetables or used in soups and stews, such as the Caribbean &quot;callaloo&quot;.
Flour made from &quot;Xanthosoma&quot; species is hypoallergenic.

<text>Acid mine drainage, acid and metalliferous drainage (AMD), or acid rock drainage (ARD) is the outflow of acidic water from metal mines and coal mines.

Acid rock drainage occurs naturally within some environments as part of the rock weathering process but is exacerbated by large-scale earth disturbances characteristic of mining and other large construction activities, usually within rocks containing an abundance of sulfide minerals. Areas where the earth has been disturbed (e.g. construction sites or highway construction) may create acid rock drainage. In many localities, the liquid that drains from coal stocks, coal handling facilities, coal washeries, and coal waste tips can be highly acidic, and in such cases it is treated as acid rock drainage. These, combined with reduced pH, have a detrimental impact on the streams&#x27; aquatic environments.

The same type of chemical reactions and processes may occur through the disturbance of acid sulfate soils formed under coastal or estuarine conditions after the last major sea level rise, and constitutes a similar environmental hazard.

==Nomenclature==
Historically, the acidic discharges from active or abandoned mines were called acid mine drainage, or AMD. The term acid rock drainage, or ARD, was introduced in the 1980s and 1990s to indicate that acidic drainage can originate from sources other than mines. For example, a paper presented in 1991 at a major international conference on this subject was titled: &quot;The Prediction of Acid Rock Drainage – Lessons from the Database&quot;. Both AMD and ARD refer to low pH or acidic waters caused by the oxidation of sulfide minerals, though ARD is the more generic name.

In cases where drainage from a mine is not acidic and has dissolved metals or metalloids, or was originally acidic, but has been neutralized along its flow path, then it is described as &quot;neutral mine drainage&quot;, &quot;mining-influenced water&quot; or otherwise. None of these other names have gained general acceptance.

==Occurrence==

Sub-surface mining often progresses below the water table, so water must be constantly pumped out of the mine in order to prevent flooding. When a mine is abandoned, the pumping ceases, and water floods the mine. This introduction of water is the initial step in most acid rock drainage situations. Tailings piles or ponds, mine waste rock dumps, and coal spoils are also an important source of acid mine drainage.

After being exposed to air and water, oxidation of metal sulfides (often pyrite, which is iron-sulfide) within the surrounding rock and overburden generates acidity. Colonies of bacteria and archaea greatly accelerate the decomposition of metal ions, although the reactions also occur in an abiotic environment. These microbes, called extremophiles for their ability to survive in harsh conditions, occur naturally in the rock, but limited water and oxygen supplies usually keep their numbers low. Extremophiles known as acidophiles especially favor the low pH levels of abandoned mines. In particular, &quot;Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans&quot; is a key contributor to pyrite oxidation.

Metal mines may generate highly acidic discharges where the ore is a sulfide mineral or is associated with pyrite. In these cases the predominant metal ion may not be iron but rather zinc, copper, or nickel. The most commonly mined ore of copper, chalcopyrite, is itself a copper-iron-sulfide and occurs with a range of other sulfides. Thus, copper mines are often major culprits of acid mine drainage.

At some mines, acidic drainage is detected within 2–5 years after mining begins, whereas at other mines, it is not detected for several decades. In addition, acidic drainage may be generated for decades or centuries after it is first detected. For this reason, acid mine drainage is considered a serious long-term environmental problem associated with mining.

==Chemistry==
The chemistry of oxidation of pyrites, the production of ferrous ions and subsequently ferric ions, is very complex, and this complexity has considerably inhibited the design of effective treatment options.

Although a host of chemical processes contribute to acid mine drainage, pyrite oxidation is by far the greatest contributor. A general equation for this process is:

The oxidation of the sulfide to sulfate solubilizes the ferrous iron (iron(II)), which is subsequently oxidized to ferric iron (iron(III)):

Either of these reactions can occur spontaneously or can be catalyzed by microorganisms that derive energy from the oxidation reaction. The ferric cations produced can also oxidize additional pyrite and reduce into ferrous ions:

The net effect of these reactions is to release H+, which lowers the pH and maintains the solubility of the ferric ion.

==Effects==

===Effects on pH===

Water temperatures as high as have been measured underground at the Iron Mountain Mine, and the pH can be as low as −3.6.

Organisms which cause acid mine drainage can thrive in waters with pH very close to zero. Negative pH occurs when water evaporates from already acidic pools thereby increasing the concentration of hydrogen ions.

About half of the coal mine discharges in Pennsylvania have pH under 5. However, a portion of mine drainage in both the bituminous and anthracite regions of Pennsylvania is alkaline, because limestone in the overburden neutralizes acid before the drainage emanates. 

===Yellow boy===
When the pH of acid mine drainage is raised past 3, either through contact with fresh water or neutralizing minerals, previously soluble iron(III) ions precipitate as iron(III) hydroxide, a yellow-orange solid colloquially known as &quot;yellow boy&quot;. Other types of iron precipitates are possible, including iron oxides and oxyhydroxides, and sulfates such as jarosite. All these precipitates can discolor water and smother plant and animal life on the streambed, disrupting stream ecosystems (a specific offense under the Fisheries Act in Canada). The process also produces additional hydrogen ions, which can further decrease pH. In some cases, the concentrations of iron hydroxides in yellow boy are so high the precipitate can be recovered for commercial use in pigments.

===Trace metal and semi-metal contamination===
Many acid rock discharges also contain elevated levels of potentially toxic metals, especially nickel and copper with lower levels of a range of trace and semi-metal ions such as lead, arsenic, aluminium, and manganese. The elevated levels of heavy metals can only be dissolved in waters that have a low pH, as is found in the acidic waters produced by pyrite oxidation. In the coal belt around the south Wales valleys in the UK highly acidic nickel-rich discharges from coal stocking sites have proved to be particularly troublesome.

=== Effects on aquatic wildlife ===
Acid mine drainage also affects the wildlife living within the affected body of water. Aquatic macroinvertebrates living in streams or parts of streams affected by acid mine drainage show fewer individuals, less diversity, and lower biomass. Many species of fish also cannot tolerate the pollution. Among the macroinvertebrates, certain species can be found at only certain levels of pollution, while other species can be found over a wide range.

== Identification and prediction ==
In a mining setting it is leading practice to carry out a geochemical assessment of mine materials during the early stages of a project to determine the potential for AMD. The geochemical assessment aims to map the distribution and variability of key geochemical parameters, acid generating and element leaching characteristics.

The assessment may include:
# Sampling;
# Static geochemical testwork (e.g. acid-base accounting, sulfur speciation);
# Kinetic geochemical testwork - Conducting oxygen consumption tests, such as the OxCon, to quantify acidity generation rates
# Modelling of oxidation, pollutant generation and release; and
# Modelling of material composition.

==Treatment==

===Oversight===
In the United Kingdom, many discharges from abandoned mines are exempt from regulatory control. In such cases the Environment Agency and Natural Resources Wales working with partners such as the Coal Authority have provided some innovative solutions, including constructed wetland solutions such as on the River Pelenna in the valley of the River Afan near Port Talbot and the constructed wetland next to the River Neath at Ynysarwed.

Although abandoned underground mines produce most of the acid mine drainage, some recently mined and reclaimed surface mines have produced ARD and have degraded local ground-water and surface-water resources. Acidic water produced at active mines must be neutralized to achieve before discharge from a mine site to a stream is permitted.

In Canada, work to reduce the effects of acid mine drainage is concentrated under the Mine Environment Neutral Drainage (MEND) program. Total liability from acid rock drainage is estimated to be between and . Over a period of eight years, MEND claims to have reduced ARD liability by up to , from an investment of .

===Methods===

====Neutralization with calcium carbonate====
Often, limestone rocks or appropriate calcareous strata that could contribute to neutralize acid effluents are lacking, or insufficiently accessible (too short contact time with acidic waters flowing too fast, too low specific surface area, insufficient contact…), at sites affected by acidic rock drainage. In such cases, crushed limestone can be dumped on site as neutralizing agent.

However, although limestone is an unprocessed raw material available in large quantities and the least expensive neutralisation agent, it can suffer from a number of disadvantages possibly limiting its applications. Indeed, small calcium carbonate grains of crushed limestone can be prone to the formation of a coating of gypsum () surrounded by a thin impermeable and protective film of less soluble Fe-Al hydroxysulfate. This coating is sometimes referred to in the literature as an &quot;armor&quot; (shield, encrustation, rim, rind…). When present, it passivates the limestone surface, preventing calcite dissolution and the further release of bicarbonate in solution.

This might explain why at Cwm Rheidol in mid Wales, the positive impact of limestone application has been much less than anticipated because of the formation of a poorly soluble calcium sulfate layer onto the surface of limestone chips, binding the material and preventing further neutralization.

====Neutralization with lime====
Depending on the volume and flowrate of acid effluents to be neutralised and the scale of industrial installations, a commonly but more expensive commercial process for treating acid mine drainage is precipitation with lime in a high-density sludge (HDS) process. In this application, a slurry of lime (CaO –  after hydration) is dispersed into a tank containing acid mine drainage and recycled sludge to increase water pH to about 9. At this pH, most toxic metals become insoluble and precipitate, aided by the presence of recycled sludge. Optionally, air can be injected in the tank to oxidize iron(II) and manganese(II) and assist in their precipitation. The resulting slurry is directed to a sludge-settling vessel, such as a clarifier. In that vessel, clean water will overflow for release, whereas settled metal precipitates (sludge) are recycled to the acid mine drainage treatment tank, with a sludge-wasting side stream. A number of variations of this process exist, as dictated by the chemistry of ARD, its volume, and other factors. Generally, the products of the HDS process also contain gypsum (CaSO4) and unreacted lime, which enhance both its settleability and resistance to re-acidification and metal mobilization. 

A general equation for this neutralisation process is:

: H2SO4 +  → CaSO4 + 2 H2O

Less complex variants of this process, such as simple lime neutralization, may involve no more than a lime silo, a mixing tank and a settling pond. These systems are far less costly to build, but are also less efficient (longer reaction times are required, and they produce a discharge with higher trace metal concentrations, if present). They would be suitable for relatively small flows or less complex acid mine drainage.

====Neutralization with calcium silicate====
A calcium silicate feedstock, made from processed steel slag, can also be used to neutralize active acidity in AMD systems by removing free hydrogen ions from the bulk solution, thereby increasing pH. As the silicate anion captures H+ ions (raising the pH), it forms monosilicic acid (H4SiO4), a neutral solute. Monosilicic acid remains in the bulk solution and play many roles in correcting the adverse effects of acidic conditions. In the bulk solution, the silicate anion is very effective in neutralizing H+ cations in the soil solution. While its mode-of-action is quite different from limestone, the ability of calcium silicate to neutralize acid solutions is equivalent to limestone as evidenced by its CCE value of 90–100% and its relative neutralizing value of 98%.

In the presence of heavy metals, calcium silicate reacts in a different way than limestone. As limestone raises the pH of the bulk solution, when heavy metals are present, precipitation of the poorly soluble metal hydroxides is accelerated and the tendency for an impermeable metal hydroxide coating, termed &quot;armoring&quot;, to form on limestone grains surface increases significantly. Limestone grains become coated by a rind of gypsum encapsulated itself in a thin external film of impermeable and protective Fe-Al hydroxysulfate. &quot;Armoring&quot; slows the dissolution and prevents the limestone grains from releasing additional alkalinity in solution. In the calcium silicate aggregates, as silicic acid species are adsorbed onto the metal hydroxide surface, the development of silica layers (mono- and bi-layers) lead to the formation of colloidal complexes with neutral or negative surface charges. These negatively charged colloids are electrostatically repelled by each other (as well as with the negatively charged calcium silicate granules). The sequestered metal colloids are stabilized and remain in a stable dispersed state – effectively interrupting metal precipitation and reducing vulnerability of the material to &quot;armoring&quot; (formation of an impervious crust around material grains preventing their dissolution and decreasing their reactivity).

====Removal of toxic metals by ion exchange====
Cation exchange processes have previously been investigated as a potential treatment for acid mine drainage. The principle is that an ion-exchange resin can remove potentially toxic metals (cationic resins), or chlorides, sulfates and uranyl sulfate complexes (anionic resins) from mine water. Once the contaminants are adsorbed, the exchange sites on resins must be regenerated, which typically requires acidic and basic reagents and generates a brine that contains the pollutants in a concentrated form. A South African company that won the 2013 IChemE award for water management and supply (treating AMD) has developed a patented ion-exchange process that treats mine effluents (and AMD) economically.

====Constructed wetlands====
Constructed wetlands systems have been proposed during the 1980s to treat acid mine drainage generated by the abandoned coal mines in Eastern Appalachia. Generally, the wetlands receive near-neutral water, after it has been typically neutralized by a limestone-based treatment process. Metal precipitation occurs from their oxidation at near-neutral pH, complexation with organic matter, precipitation as carbonates or sulfides. The latter results from sediment-borne anaerobic bacteria capable of reducing sulfate ions into sulfide ions. These sulfide ions can then bind with heavy metal ions, precipitating heavy metals out of solution and effectively reversing the entire process.

The attractiveness of a constructed wetlands solution lies in its relative low cost. They are limited by the metal loads they can deal with (either from high flows or metal concentrations), though current practitioners have succeeded in developing constructed wetlands that treat high volumes (see description of Campbell Mine constructed wetland) and/or highly acidic water (with adequate pre-treatment). Typically, the effluent from constructed wetland receiving near-neutral water will be well-buffered at 6.5–7.0 and can readily be discharged. Some of metal precipitates retained in sediments are easily oxidised and remobilised when exposed to atmospheric oxygen (e.g., copper sulfide or elemental selenium), and it is very important that the wetland sediments remain largely and permanently submerged to maintain them insoluble and immobile. Prolonged droughts caused by climate warming might compromise the proper functioning and the safety of some constructed wetlands if during extremely hot summer period water supply decreases and evaporation accelerates causing them to dry up. 

An example of an effective constructed wetland is on the Afon Pelena in the River Afan valley above Port Talbot where highly ferruginous discharges from the Whitworth mine have been successfully treated.

====Precipitation of metal sulfides====
Most base metals in acidic solution precipitate in contact with free sulfide, e.g. from H2S or NaHS. Solid-liquid separation after reaction would produce a base metal-free effluent that can be discharged or further treated to reduce sulfate, and a metal sulfide concentrate with possible economic value.

As an alternative, several researchers have investigated the precipitation of metals using biogenic sulfide. In this process, sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) oxidize organic matter using sulfate as terminal electron acceptor, instead of oxygen. Their metabolic products include bicarbonate produced by organic matter oxidation, which can neutralize water acidity, and hydrogen sulfide, which forms highly insoluble precipitates with many toxic metals. Although promising, this process has been slow in being adopted for a variety of technical reasons.

=== Technologies ===
Many technologies exist for the treatment of AMD.

== Metagenomic study ==

With the advance of large-scale sequencing strategies, genomes of microorganisms in the acid mine drainage community are directly sequenced from the environment. The nearly full genomic constructs allows new understanding of the community and able to reconstruct their metabolic pathways. Our knowledge of acidophiles in acid mine drainage remains rudimentary: we know of many more species associated with ARD than we can establish roles and functions.

== Microbes and drug discovery ==
Scientists have recently begun to explore acid mine drainage and mine reclamation sites for unique soil bacteria capable of producing new pharmaceutical leads. Soil microbes have long been a source for effective drugs and new research, such as that conducted at the Center for Pharmaceutical Research and Innovation, suggests these extreme environments to be an untapped source for new discovery.

<text>In geomorphology, an outburst flood—a type of megaflood—is a high-magnitude, low-frequency catastrophic flood involving the sudden release of a large quantity of water. During the last deglaciation, numerous glacial lake outburst floods were caused by the collapse of either ice sheets or glaciers that formed the dams of proglacial lakes. Examples of older outburst floods are known from the geological past of the Earth and inferred from geomorphological evidence on Mars. Landslides, lahars, and volcanic dams can also block rivers and create lakes, which trigger such floods when the rock or earthen barrier collapses or is eroded. Lakes also form behind glacial moraines or ice dams, which can collapse and create outburst floods.

==Definition and classification==
Megafloods are paleofloods (past floods) that involved rates of water flow larger than those in the historical record. They are studied through the sedimentary deposits and the erosional and constructional landforms that individual megafloods have created. Floods that are known to us through historical descriptions are mostly related to meteorological events, such as heavy rains, rapid melting of snowpacks, or combination of these. In the geological past of the Earth, however, geological research has shown that much larger events have occurred. In the case of outburst floods, such floods are typically linked to the collapse of a barrier which formed a lake. They fall in the following classification according to the mechanism responsible:
*Collapse of glacier dams that impound proglacial lakes (Missoula Floods).
*Rapid erosion, melting of ice sheets (jökulhlaups).
*Collapse of earthen barriers (landslides or glacial moraines).
*Collapse of volcanic dams created by lava flows, lahars, or pyroclastic flows.
*Overtopping of earthen or rock barriers
**Lake overtopping (e.g., Lake Bonneville).
**Ocean spilling over a dividing ridge into a landlocked basin (e.g., Zanclean flood and Black Sea flood). A smaller scale example would be the Pantai Remis landslide.

==Examples==
Examples where evidence for large ancient water flows has been documented or is under scrutiny include:

===Overflow of lakes formed by landslides===
An example is the lake overflow that caused one of the worst landslide-related disasters in history on June 10, 1786. A landslide dam on Sichuan&#x27;s Dadu River, created by an earthquake ten days earlier, burst and caused a flood that extended downstream and killed 100,000 people.

===Postglacial rebound===
Postglacial rebound changes the tilt of ground. In lakes, this means that shores sink in the direction farther away from the former maximum depth of ice. When the lake rests against an esker, water pressure increases with the increased depth. The esker may then fail under the load and burst, creating a new outflow. Lake Pielinen in Finland is an example of this.

===Tectonic basins===

====Black Sea (around 7,600 years ago)====
A rising sea flood, the proposed and much-discussed refilling of the freshwater glacial Black Sea with water from the Aegean, has been described as &quot;a violent rush of salt water into a depressed fresh-water lake in a single catastrophe that has been the inspiration for the flood mythology&quot; (Ryan and Pitman, 1998). The marine incursion, caused by the rising level of the Mediterranean, apparently occurred around 7,600 years ago. It remains an active subject of debate among geologists, with subsequent evidence discovered to both support and refute the existence of the flood, while the theory that it is the basis of later flood myths is not proven.

====Persian Gulf Flood (24,000 to 14,000 years ago, or 12000 to 10000 years ago)====
Flooding of this area scattered peoples to both sides of the gulf depression. It was an area fed by four rivers. Rose calls it the &quot;Gulf Oasis&quot; which may have been a demographic refuge fed by the Tigris, Euphrates, Karun, and Wadi Batin rivers. It was suggested to be an area of freshwater springs and rivers.

====Glacial floods in North America (15,000 to 8,000 years ago)====
In North America, during glacial maximum, there were no Great Lakes as we know them, but &quot;proglacial&quot; (ice-frontage) lakes formed and shifted. They lay in the areas of the modern lakes, but their drainage sometimes passed south, into the Mississippi system; sometimes into the Arctic, or east into the Atlantic. The most famous of these proglacial lakes was Lake Agassiz. As ice-dam configurations failed, a series of great floods were released from Lake Agassiz, resulting in massive pulses of freshwater added to the world&#x27;s oceans.

The Missoula Floods of Oregon and Washington states were also caused by breaking ice dams, resulting in the Channeled Scablands.

Lake Bonneville, a pluvial lake, burst catastrophically in the Bonneville Flood about 14,500 years ago, due to its water overflowing and washing away a sill composed of two opposing alluvial fans which had blocked a gorge. Lake Bonneville was not a glacial lake, but glacial age climate change determined the lake level and its overflow. The first scientific report of a megaflood (Gilbert, 1890) describes this event.

The last of the North American proglacial lakes, north of the present Great Lakes, has been designated Glacial Lake Ojibway by geologists. It reached its largest volume around 8,500 years ago, when joined with Lake Agassiz. But its outlet was blocked by the great wall of the glaciers and it drained by tributaries, into the Ottawa and St. Lawrence Rivers far to the south. About 8,300 to 7,700 years ago, the melting ice dam over Hudson Bay&#x27;s southernmost extension narrowed to the point where pressure and its buoyancy lifted it free, and the ice-dam failed catastrophically. Lake Ojibway&#x27;s beach terraces show that it was above sea level. The volume of Lake Ojibway is commonly estimated to have been about , more than enough water to cover a flattened-out Antarctica with a sheet of water deep. That volume was added to the world&#x27;s oceans in a matter of months.

The detailed timing and rates of change after the onset of melting of the great ice-sheets are subjects of continuing study.

====The Caspian and Black Seas (around 16,000 years ago)====
A theory proposed by Andrey Tchepalyga of the Russian Academy of Sciences dates the flooding of the Black Sea basin to an earlier time and from a different cause. According to Tchepalyga, global warming beginning from about 16,000 BP caused the melting of the Scandinavia Ice Sheet, resulting in massive river discharge that flowed into the Caspian Sea, raising it to as much as above normal present-day levels. The Sea of Azov rose so high that it overflowed into the Caspian Sea. The rise was extremely rapid and the Caspian basin could not contain all the floodwater, which flowed from the northwest coastline of the Caspian Sea, through the Kuma-Manych Depression and Kerch Strait into the Black Sea basin. By the end of the Pleistocene this would have raised the level of the Black Sea by some below its present-day level, flooding large areas that were formerly available for settlement or hunting. Tchepalyga suggests this may have formed the basis for legends of the great Deluge.

====Red Sea floods====
The barrier across Bab-el-Mandeb, between Ethiopia and Yemen, seems to have been the source of outbreak flooding similar to that found in the Mediterranean. The Lake Toba event, approximately between 69,000 and 77,000 years ago, caused a massive drop in sea levels, exposing the barrier and enabling modern &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; to leave Africa via a route other than Sinai. The finding of saline evaporites on the floor of the Red Sea confirms that this dam has functioned at various periods in the past. Rising sea levels during the Flandrian transgression (and in earlier interglacial periods) suggest that this area may have been subject to outburst flooding.

====English Channel floods====
Originally there was an isthmus across the Strait of Dover. During an earlier glacial maximum, the exit from the North Sea was blocked to the north by an ice dam, and the water flowing out of rivers backed up into a vast lake with freshwater glacial melt on the bed of what is now the North Sea. A gently upfolding chalk ridge linking the Weald of Kent and Artois, perhaps some 30 metres (100 feet) higher than the current sea level, contained the glacial lake at the Strait of Dover. At some time, probably around 425,000 years ago and again around 225,000 years later the barrier failed or was overtopped, loosing a catastrophic flood that permanently diverted the Rhine into the English Channel and replacing the &quot;Isthmus of Dover&quot; watershed by a much lower watershed running from East Anglia east then southeast to the Hook of Holland and (as at modern sea level) separated Britain from the continent of Europe; a sonar study of the sea bed of the English Channel published in &quot;Nature&quot;, July 2007, revealed the discovery of unmistakable marks of a megaflood on the English Channel seabed: deeply eroded channels and braided features have left the remnants of streamlined islands among deeply gouged channels where the collapse occurred.

====Refilling of the Mediterranean Sea (5.3 million years ago)====

A catastrophic flood refilled the Mediterranean Sea 5.3 million years ago, at the beginning of the Zanclean age that ended the Messinian salinity crisis. The flood occurred when Atlantic waters found their way through the Strait of Gibraltar into the desiccated Mediterranean basin, following the Messinian salinity crisis during which it repeatedly became dry and re-flooded, dated by consensus to before the emergence of modern humans.

The Mediterranean did not dry out during the most recent glacial maximum. Sea level during glacial periods within the Pleistocene is estimated to have dropped only about 110 to 120 metres (361 to 394 ft). In contrast, the depth of the Strait of Gibraltar where the Atlantic Ocean enters ranges between .

<doc id="723420" wikidata="Q5029822" url="?curid=723420" title="Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives">
<text>The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA) is an independent think tank in Canada. It has been described as &quot;left leaning&quot;.

The CCPA concentrates on economic policy, international trade, environmental justice and social policy. It is especially known for publishing an alternative federal budget on an annual basis. The centre is based in Ottawa but has branch offices in Vancouver, Winnipeg, Regina, Toronto and Halifax. It is funded primarily through individual donations, research grants, and trade unions.

== History ==

The CCPA was founded in Ottawa in 1980 by a group of university professors and union activists. Many of those first involved with the CCPA&#x27;s founding wanted to use it to counter the neoliberal consensus that was emerging during this period. Following its formation, the centre began organizing conferences, publishing pamphlets, and producing booklets and reports created by volunteer researchers.

The organization ran into financial difficulties in the late 1980s due to inadequate funding. However, it was able to successfully lobby trade unions and other NGOs in the early 1990s to take out memberships. In 1994, the centre&#x27;s capacities expanded further when it increased membership outreach to individual donors. It then went on to set up provincial offices across the country. By 2002, it had established offices in British Columbia, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, and Saskatchewan.

In 2012, the Canada Revenue Agency launched a $13.4-million program through which it undertook a political audit of 52 charities, including the CCPA, &quot;to determine whether any [were] violating a rule that limits their spending on political activities to 10 per cent of resources&quot;. In 2014, the CRA claimed on its website that the CCPA appeared to be &quot;biased&quot; and &quot;one-sided.&quot; In an open letter, 400 academics called for a moratorium on the CCPA audit, claiming that it was an attempt by the Conservative Party of Canada government to &quot;intimidate, muzzle and silence its critics&quot;. The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; reported that two Canadian market-oriented think tanks, the C. D. Howe Institute and the Macdonald–Laurier Institute, were not under audit at the time.

== Projects and initiatives ==

=== Alternative federal budget===
In 1995, the CCPA published its first alternative federal budget (AFB) with the Winnipeg-based CHO!CES. The AFB has since become the centre’s signature initiative. The AFB is a collaborative project that includes inputs from various civil society groups from across the country.

===&quot;The Monitor&quot;===

In 1994, the CCPA launched &quot;The Monitor&quot;, which continues to serve as the organization’s regularly-published flagship magazine that complies analyses conducted by their researchers and affiliates.

=== Response to threatened US tariffs against Canadian exports ===

An article by CCPA staff dated February 3, 2025 named &quot;A dozen radical responses to Trump’s economic warfare that go beyond Canadian counter-tariffs&quot;, calls for Canada to consider various responses to threatened US tariffs against Canadian exports, including, &quot;Repatriate U.S.-owned assets, especially in the resource industry. As long as Trump wages economic war against Canada, American assets here should be considered forfeited. Simply freezing those assets as a first step would send alarm bells ringing across corporate America.&quot;

<text>Castelo is a municipality in the southwest of the state of Espírito Santo in Brazil. Its population was 37,747 (2020) and its area is 664 km².

==History==
There is information on two Amerindian tribes inhabiting the area before the colonial era. The main tribe was called Puris, and the secondary, with less presence, were the Botocudos. The first non-native immigration into the region was of gold prospectors who moved into the area, but this was a short-lived adventure which by 1830 had been abandoned. After 1830, local interest turned towards the land. Medium-sized properties were established using slave labour until 1888, when it was abolished. Soon after, Italian immigrants from the neighbouring municipality of Alfredo Chaves began to settle in Castelo. In 1891 Castelo became a district of Cachoeiro de Itapemirim and remained part of Cachoeiro de Itapemirim until 1928, when it separated.

==Geography==

Highest point in the municipality is the Forno Grande Peak (2039 m), which is also the highest point in the state after Bandeira Peak, shared with Minas Gerais.

Castelo is 145 km from the state capital Vitória, and stands at 100 meters above sea level. Castelo&#x27;s borders are: Alfredo Chaves and Domingos Martins (E), Venda Nova do Imigrante and Conceição do Castelo (N), Muniz Freire and Alegre (W) and Cachoeiro de Itapemirim (S).

The municipality contains the Forno Grande State Park, which protects the second highest peak in the state.
It also contains the Mata das Flores State Park, created in 1992.

==Population==
Castelo is strongly influenced by Italian immigrants, who make up the great majority of the municipality&#x27;s population. This influences today&#x27;s traditional commemorations, very much Catholic-based in traditions like &quot;Corpus Christi&quot;. This influence is also felt in the traditional Italian Folklore dance group, which still practices traditional Piedmontese dances.

<doc id="723434" wikidata="Q146992" url="?curid=723434" title="Abies alba">
<text>Abies alba, the European silver fir or silver fir, is a fir native to the mountains of Europe, from the Pyrenees north to Normandy, east to the Alps and the Carpathians, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia, and south to Italy, Bulgaria, Kosovo, Albania and northern Greece.

==Description==
&quot;Abies alba&quot; is a large evergreen coniferous tree growing to tall and with a trunk diameter up to . The largest measured tree was tall and had a trunk diameter of . It occurs at altitudes of (mainly over ), on mountains with rainfall over per year.

The leaves are needle-like, flattened, long and wide by thick, glossy dark green above, and with two greenish-white bands of stomata below. The leaf is usually slightly notched at the tip. The cones are long and broad, with about 150-200 scales, each scale with an exserted bract and two winged seeds; they disintegrate when mature to release the seeds. The wood is white, leading to the species name &quot;alba&quot;.

In the forest the evergreen tends to form stands with Norway spruce, Scots pine, and European beech. It is closely related to Bulgarian fir (&quot;Abies borisii-regis&quot;) further to the southeast in the Balkan Peninsula, Spanish fir (&quot;Abies pinsapo&quot;) of Spain and Morocco and Sicilian fir (&quot;Abies nebrodensis&quot;) in Sicily, differing from these and other related Euro-Mediterranean firs in the sparser foliage, with the leaves spread either side of the shoot, leaving the shoot readily visible from above. Some botanists treat Bulgarian fir and Sicilian fir as varieties of silver fir, as &quot;A. alba&quot; var. &quot;acutifolia&quot; and &quot;A. alba&quot; var. &quot;nebrodensis&quot;, respectively.

==Ecology==
Silver fir is an important component species in the dinaric calcareous block fir forest in the western Balkan Peninsula.

In Italy, the silver fir is an important component of the mixed broadleaved-coniferous forest of the Apennine Mountains, especially in northern Apennine. The fir prefer a cold and humid climate, in northern exposition, with a high rainfall (over 1500 mm per year). In the oriental Alps of Italy, silver firs grow in mixed forests with Norway spruce, beech, and other trees.

Its cone scales are eaten by the caterpillars of the tortrix moth &quot;Cydia illutana&quot;, while &quot;C. duplicana&quot; feeds on the bark around injuries or canker.

==Chemistry and pharmacology==

The bark and wood of silver fir are rich in antioxidative polyphenols. Six phenolic acids were identified (gallic, homovanillic, protocatechuic, p-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic and p-coumaric), three flavonoids (catechin, epicatechin and catechin tetramethyl ether) and eight lignans (taxiresinol, 7-(2-methyl-3,4-dihydroxytetrahydropyran-5-yloxy)-taxiresinol, secoisolariciresinol, lariciresinol, hydroxymatairesinol, isolariciresinol, matairesinol and pinoresinol).
The extract from the trunk was shown to prevent atherosclerosis in guinea pigs and to have cardioprotective effect in isolated rat hearts. Silver fir wood extract was found to reduce the post-prandial glycemic response (concentration of sugar in the blood after the meal) in healthy volunteers.

==Uses==
In Roman times the wood was used to make wooden casks to store and transport wine and other substances.

A resinous essential oil can be extracted. This pine-scented oil is used in perfumes, bath products, and aerosol inhalants. Its branches (including the leaves, bark and wood) were used for production of spruce beer.

Silver fir is the species first used as a Christmas tree, but has been largely replaced by Nordmann fir (which has denser, more attractive foliage), Norway spruce (which is much cheaper to grow), and other species. When cultivated on Christmas Tree plantations, the tree naturally forms a symmetrical conical shape. The trees are full and dense with a resinous fragrance, and are known to be one of the longest lasting after being cut. As well as in its native area, it is also grown on Christmas tree plantations in the northeast region of North America spanning New England in the USA to the Maritime Provinces of Canada.

The wood is strong, lightweight, light-coloured, fine grained, even-textured and long fibred. The timber is mainly used as construction wood, furniture, plywood, pulpwood and paper manufacture.

The honeydew which is produced by aphids sitting on the silver fir is collected by honey bees. The resulting honey is marketed as &quot;fir honey&quot;.

==Etymology==
&quot;Abies&quot; is derived from Latin, meaning &#x27;rising one&#x27;. The name was used to refer to tall trees or ships.

&quot;Alba&quot; means &#x27;bright&#x27; or &#x27;dead white&#x27;.

<text>A reverse Turing test is a Turing test in which failure suggests that the test-taker is human, while success suggests the test-taker is automated. 

Conventionally, the Turing test is conceived as having a few computer AI subjects communicate with each other and one human subject which attempts to also appear as a computer AI. After a few questions the AI subjects needs to correctly guess which of the participants is a human subject. 

==Reversal of objective==
Arguably the standard form of the reverse Turing test is one in which the subjects attempt to appear to be a computer rather than a human.

A formal reverse Turing test follows the same format as a Turing test. Human subjects attempt to imitate the conversational style of a conversation program. Doing this well involves deliberately ignoring, to some degree, the meaning of the conversation
that is immediately apparent to a human, and the simulation of the kinds of errors that conversational programs typically make. Arguably unlike the conventional Turing test, this is most interesting when the judges are very familiar with the art of conversation programs, meaning that in the regular Turing test they can very rapidly tell the difference
between a computer program and a human acting normally.

The humans that perform best in the reverse Turing test are those that know computers best, and so know the types of errors that computers can be expected to make in conversation. There is much shared ground between the skill of the reverse Turing
test and the skill of mentally simulating a program&#x27;s operation in the course of computer programming and especially debugging. As a result, programmers (especially hackers) will sometimes indulge in an informal reverse Turing test for recreation.

An informal reverse Turing test involves an attempt to simulate a computer without the formal structure of the Turing test. The judges of the test are typically not aware in advance that a reverse Turing test is occurring, and the test subject attempts to elicit from the &#x27;judges&#x27; (who, correctly, think they are speaking to a human) a response along the lines of &quot;is this really a human?&quot;. Describing such a situation as a &quot;reverse Turing test&quot; typically occurs retroactively.

There are also cases of accidental reverse Turing tests, occurring when a programmer is in a sufficiently non-human mood that his conversation unintentionally resembles that of a computer. In these cases the description is invariably retroactive and humorously intended.
The subject may be described as having passed or failed a reverse Turing test or as having failed a Turing test. The latter description is arguably more accurate in these cases; see also the next section.

==Failure by control subjects==
Since Turing test judges are sometimes presented with genuinely human subjects, as a control, it inevitably occurs that a small proportion of such control subjects are judged to be computers. This is considered humorous and often embarrassing for the subject.

This situation may be described literally as the human &quot;failing the Turing test&quot;, for a computer (the intended subject of the test) achieving the same result would be described in the same terms as having failed. The same situation may also be described as the human &quot;failing the reverse Turing test&quot; because to consider the human to be a subject of the test involves reversing the roles of the real and control subjects.

==Judgement by computer==

The term &quot;reverse Turing test&quot; has also been applied to a Turing test (test of humanity) that is administered by a computer. In other words, a computer administers a test to determine if the subject is or is not human. Such procedures, called CAPTCHAs, are used in some anti-spam systems to prevent automated bulk use of communications systems.

The use of captchas is controversial. Circumvention methods exist that reduce their effectiveness. Also, many implementations of captchas (particularly ones desired to counter circumvention) are inaccessible to humans with disabilities, and/or are difficult for humans to pass.

Note that &quot;CAPTCHA&quot; is an acronym for &quot;Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart&quot; so that the original designers of the test regard the test as a Turing test to some degree.

==Judgement of sufficient input==
An alternative conception of a Reverse Turing Test is to use the test to determine whether sufficient information is being transmitted between the tester and the subject. For example, if the information sent by the tester is insufficient for the human doctor to perform diagnosis accurately, then a medical diagnostic program could not be blamed for also failing to diagnose accurately.

This formulation is of particular use in developing Artificial Intelligence programs, because it gives an indication of the input needed for a system that attempts to emulate human activities.

<text>Methyltestosterone, sold under the brand names Android, Metandren, and Testred among others, is an androgen and anabolic steroid (AAS) medication which is used in the treatment of low testosterone levels in men, delayed puberty in boys, at low doses as a component of menopausal hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms like hot flashes, osteoporosis, and low sexual desire in women, and to treat breast cancer in women. It is taken by mouth or held in the cheek or under the tongue.
Side effects of methyltestosterone include symptoms of masculinization like acne, increased hair growth, voice changes, and increased sexual desire. It can also cause estrogenic effects like fluid retention, breast tenderness, and breast enlargement in men and liver damage. The drug is a synthetic androgen and anabolic steroid and hence is an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It has moderate androgenic effects and moderate anabolic effects, which make it useful for producing masculinization.
Methyltestosterone was discovered in 1935 and was introduced for medical use in 1936. It was made shortly after the discovery of testosterone and was one of the first synthetic AAS to be developed. In addition to its medical use, methyltestosterone is used to improve physique and performance, although it is not as commonly used as other AAS for such purposes due to its androgenic effects, estrogenic effects, and risk of liver damage. The drug is a controlled substance in many countries and so non-medical use is generally illicit.
==Uses==

===Medical===
Methyltestosterone is or has been used in the treatment of delayed puberty, hypogonadism, cryptorchidism, and erectile dysfunction in males, and in low doses to treat menopausal symptoms (specifically for osteoporosis, hot flashes, and to increase libido and energy), postpartum breast pain and engorgement, and breast cancer in women. It is specifically approved in the United States for the treatment of hypogonadism and delayed puberty in males and the treatment of advanced inoperable breast cancer in females. It was also approved in low doses in combination with esterified estrogens for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause in women in the United States, but this formulation was discontinued and hence is no longer used.

Methyltestosterone is less effective in inducing masculinization than testosterone, but is useful for maintaining established masculinization in adults.

The dosages of methyltestosterone used are 10 to 50 mg/day in men for common medical uses like hypogonadism and delayed puberty as well as physique- and performance-enhancing purposes and 2.5 mg/day in women for menopausal symptoms. Higher dosages of 50 to 200 mg/day have been used to treat women with inoperable breast cancer that has failed to respond to other therapies, although such dosages are associated with severe irreversible virilization.



===Non-medical===
Methyltestosterone is used for physique- and performance-enhancing purposes by competitive athletes, bodybuilders, and powerlifters, although it is not commonly used relative to other AAS for such purposes.

===Available forms===
Methyltestosterone is typically used as an oral medication. It is also available under the brand names Metandren and Oreton Methyl for use specifically by buccal or sublingual administration. Methyltestosterone is available in the form of 2, 5, 10, and 25 mg oral tablets. It was also available in combination with estrogens as esterified estrogens/methyltestosterone (0.625 mg/1.25 mg, 1.25 mg/2.5 mg) and conjugated estrogens/methyltestosterone (0.625 mg/5.0 mg, 1.25 mg/10 mg).

==Contraindications==
Methyltestosterone should be used with caution in women and children, as it can cause irreversible virilization. Due to its estrogenicity, methyltestosterone can also accelerate epiphyseal closure and thereby produce short stature in children and adolescents. It can worsen symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Methyltestosterone should not be used in men with prostate cancer, as androgens can accelerate tumor progression. The drug should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing hepatotoxicity, due to its own potential for hepatotoxicity.

==Side effects==
Adverse effects of methyltestosterone include androgenic side effects like oily skin, acne, seborrhea, increased facial/body hair growth, scalp hair loss, increased aggressiveness and sex drive, and spontaneous erections, as well as estrogenic side effects like breast tenderness, gynecomastia, fluid retention, and edema. In women, methyltestosterone can cause partially irreversible virilization, for instance voice deepening, hirsutism, clitoromegaly, breast atrophy, and muscle hypertrophy, as well as menstrual disturbances and reversible infertility. In men, the drug may also cause hypogonadism, testicular atrophy, and reversible infertility at sufficiently high dosages.

Methyltestosterone can sometimes cause hepatotoxicity, for instance elevated liver enzymes, cholestatic jaundice, peliosis hepatis, hepatomas, and hepatocellular carcinoma, with extended use. It can also have adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. AAS like methyltestosterone stimulate erythropoiesis (red blood cell production) and increase hematocrit levels and at high dosages can cause polycythemia (overproduction of red blood cells), which can greatly increase the risk of thrombic events such as embolism and stroke. With long-term treatment, AAS can increase the risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer. Violent and even homicidal behavior, hypomania/mania, depression, suicidality, delusions, and psychosis have all been associated with very high dosages of AAS.

==Interactions==
Aromatase inhibitors can be used to reduce or prevent the estrogenic effects of methyltestosterone and 5α-reductase inhibitors can be used to reduce its virilizing effects and thereby improve its ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity and reduce its rate of androgenic side effects.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
As an AAS, methyltestosterone is an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR), similarly to androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It is a substrate for 5α-reductase like testosterone, and so is potentiated analogously in so-called &quot;androgenic&quot; tissues like the skin, hair follicles, and prostate gland via transformation into the more potent AR agonist mestanolone (17α-methyl-DHT). As such, methyltestosterone has a relatively low ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity, with a similar ratio to that of testosterone (close to 1:1), and this makes it among the most androgenic AAS. Due to efficient aromatization into the potent and metabolism-resistant estrogen methylestradiol (17α-methylestradiol), methyltestosterone has relatively high estrogenicity and hence potential for estrogenic side effects such as gynecomastia and fluid retention. The drug possesses negligible progestogenic activity.

Due to its combined disadvantages of a relatively poor ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity, unusually high estrogenicity, and the potential for hepatotoxicity (as with other 17α-alkylated AAS), methyltestosterone has not been used as commonly as many other AAS either in medicine or for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes.

===Pharmacokinetics===

====Absorption====
Methyltestosterone has dramatically improved oral bioavailability and metabolic stability relative to testosterone. This difference is due to the C17α methyl group, which results in steric hindrance and prevents metabolism. The oral bioavailability of methyltestosterone is about 70%, and it is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Methyltestosterone can also be taken buccally or sublingually. Although effective orally, methyltestosterone is more effective by these non-oral routes, which are said to approximately double its bioavailability and require half the oral dosage.

Circulating levels of methyltestosterone with administration of 1.25 to 2.5 mg/day oral methyltestosterone in women are in the range of 20 to 30 ng/dL. For comparison to testosterone, methyltestosterone is at least as potent as an AAS. However, due to the large decrease in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels and hence increase in free unbound testosterone caused by methyltestosterone, androgenic effects may be greater than reflected merely by methyltestosterone levels.

====Distribution====
Methyltestosterone is highly protein-bound, by approximately 98%. The medication has low but significant affinity for human serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), about 25% of that of testosterone and 5% of that of DHT.

====Metabolism====
The biological half-life of methyltestosterone is approximately 3 hours (range 2.5–3.5 hours). The duration of action of methyltestosterone is said to be 1 to 3 days, and is described as relatively short among AAS.

====Excretion====
Methyltestosterone is excreted 90% in the urine as conjugates and other metabolites, and 6% in feces.

==Chemistry==
Methyltestosterone, also known as 17α-methyltestosterone or as 17α-methylandrost-4-en-17β-ol-3-one, is a synthetic, 17α-alkylated androstane steroid and a derivative of testosterone differing from it only in the presence of a methyl group at the C17α position. Close synthetic relatives of methyltestosterone include metandienone (17α-methyl-δ1-testosterone) and fluoxymesterone (9α-fluoro-11β-hydroxy-17α-methyltestosterone).

===Derivatives===
Methyltestosterone and ethyltestosterone (17α-ethyltestosterone) are the parent structures of all 17α-alkylated AAS. Major 17α-alkylated AAS include the testosterone derivatives fluoxymesterone, metandienone (methandrostenolone), and methyltestosterone and the DHT derivatives oxandrolone, oxymetholone, and stanozolol.

===Synthesis===
A chemical synthesis of methyltestosterone from dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) with methandriol as an intermediate proceeds as follows:

==History==
Methyltestosterone was first synthesized in 1935 along with methandriol and mestanolone. It was the second synthetic AAS to be developed, following mesterolone (1α-methyl-DHT) in 1934, and was the first 17α-alkylated AAS to be synthesized. The drug was introduced for medical use in 1936.

<doc id="723445" wikidata="Q1066236" url="?curid=723445" title="Tonight's the Night (Neil Young album)">
<text>Tonight&#x27;s the Night is the sixth studio album by Canadian / American songwriter Neil Young. It was recorded in August–September 1973, mostly on August 26, but its release was delayed until June 1975. It peaked at No. 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album is the third and final of the so-called &quot;Ditch Trilogy&quot; of albums that Young released following the major success of 1972&#x27;s &quot;Harvest&quot;, whereupon the scope of his success and acclaim became so difficult for Young to handle that he subsequently experienced alienation from his music and career.

In 2003, the album was ranked number 331 on Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, moving up to number 330 in the list&#x27;s 2012 edition and climbing further to number 302 in the 2020 update. 

==Background==
&quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; is a direct expression of grief. Crazy Horse guitarist Danny Whitten and Young&#x27;s friend and roadie Bruce Berry had both died of drug overdoses in the months before the songs were written. Bruce Berry was the brother of both Jan Berry of Jan and Dean fame and of Ken Berry, owner of S.I.R. studios where the album was recorded. Berry leveraged his music industry connections to work as a roadie for both Young and Stephen Stills during his Manassas tour. Berry died of a heroin overdose in June 1973. Danny Whitten was a singer, songwriter and guitarist in the band Crazy Horse, with whom Young had recorded two albums. He died in November 1972 the night after Young fired him during rehearsals for the &quot;Time Fades Away&quot; tour due to his inability to play. The sessions were the first time the remaining members of Crazy Horse had played together since the passing of Whitten. In 1975 Young explained to Bud Scoppa of &quot;Creem&quot; magazine how the loss was both personal and professional: 

&quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; was not the first of Young&#x27;s work to concern the dangers of heroin and the toll it had taken on the musicians around him. &quot;The Needle and the Damage Done&quot; from the album &quot;Harvest&quot; addresses the topic directly, and was partly inspired by Whitten&#x27;s struggles. The song was also inspired by several other artists Young had seen fall to heroin, as he explained to a January 1971 audience: &quot;I got to see to see a lot of great musicians before they happened. Before they became famous. When they were just gigging. Five and six sets a night. Things like that. I got to see a lot of great musicians who nobody got to see for one reason or another. But strangely enough the real good ones that you never got to see was because of heroin. And that started happening over and over. And then it happened to some that everybody knew about.&quot; 

The title track &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; mentions Berry by name, while Whitten&#x27;s guitar and vocal work highlight &quot;Come on Baby Let&#x27;s Go Downtown&quot;, taken from a March 1970 Crazy Horse concert at the Fillmore East. The song later appeared, unedited, on a live album from the same concerts, &quot;Live at the Fillmore East&quot;, with Whitten credited as the sole author. Nils Lofgren&#x27;s guitar parts on the album are intentionally played in a style reminiscent of how Berry would play: &quot;When I use Nils, like on &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; I used him for piano, and I played piano on a couple of songs and he played guitar. In the songs where he plays guitar he&#x27;s actually playing as Bruce Berry, the way Bruce Berry played guitar. The thing is, I&#x27;m talking about him and you can hear him. So Nils just fits in – he plays that hot rock &amp; roll style guitar. He was really into it.&quot;

The band assembled for the album was known as The Santa Monica Flyers. It consisted of Young, Ben Keith, Nils Lofgren, and the Crazy Horse rhythm section of Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina. Young had previously recorded with Talbot and Molina on &quot;Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere&quot;, with Lofgren on &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot; and with Keith on &quot;Harvest&quot;. &quot;Lookout Joe&quot; dates from an earlier session with his band The Stray Gators, with whom he had recorded &quot;Harvest&quot;. &quot;Borrowed Tune&quot; was recorded solo at Young&#x27;s ranch after the album&#x27;s sessions.

==Writing==
The title track &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; was written in Young&#x27;s head, &quot;without a guitar: I just heard the bass line.&quot; Its lyrics starkly address Berry&#x27;s death.

&quot;Borrowed Tune&quot; borrows its melody from &quot;Lady Jane&quot; by the Rolling Stones. In the liner notes to &quot;Decade&quot;, Young describes it as &quot;A song I had written at the beginning of the &quot;Time Fades Away&quot; tour reflecting on whether a big stadium tour was right for me.&quot; Young explains the song&#x27;s development to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1975: &quot;I played &#x27;Lady Jane&#x27; and forgot the chords. I started playing my own chords, it started sounding better to me, so I kept playing that. It just turned into another song.&quot;

&quot;Come On Baby Let&#x27;s Go Downtown&quot;, written and sung by Whitten, is about buying drugs.

&quot;Mellow My Mind&quot; is about being weary from a long tour and not being able to unwind. He tells an audience in 1976: &quot;This is a song about being on the road. It&#x27;s a song about wanting to stop after a long tour; just wanting to be able to slow down. Even though it&#x27;s over you can&#x27;t stop because you get going so fast from place to place. Then when it ends you keep on going for awhile. &quot;Albuquerque&quot; shares similar sentiments.

In &quot;Roll Another Number (For the Road)&quot;, written during the recording sessions, Young mourns the end of the Woodstock era, and the loss of members of that movement to drugs.

&quot;New Mama&quot; was written for Young&#x27;s partner Carrie Snodgress upon the birth of their son Zeke in September 1972. He explains in concert in January 1973: &quot;This next tune is a tune I wrote a little while ago, just a while ago, about five months ago or something, when my old lady had a baby. I wrote this song. People always come up and say, &#x27;Did you write a song about your kid yet? Hey, did you write a song about your kid?&#x27; And I say, &#x27;No, not yet. Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m gonna. Can&#x27;t think of anything nice.&#x27; But I finally did it anyway. I kept thinking about that morning, you know, too much.&quot;

The lyrics to &quot;Lookout Joe&quot; are about a soldier returning home from the Vietnam War.

&quot;Tired Eyes&quot; was inspired by an April 1972 drug deal gone bad that ended in murder in Topanga Canyon, an artistic community in Southern California where Young once lived: &quot;That actually happened to a friend of mine. It was just one of those deals that turned bad, he didn&#x27;t have any choice really. The lyric is just a straight narrative account of what happened.&quot;

==Recording==
In the summer of 1973, after the conclusion of the &quot;Time Fades Away&quot; tour, Young made another attempt to record with CSNY at his ranch, capturing the songs &quot;See the Changes&quot; and &quot;Human Highway&quot; with the group. As the sessions wound down, Young reached out to producer David Briggs, who had recorded Young&#x27;s first three solo albums. Briggs remembers Young knocking on his door: &quot;I opened it and there was Neil. He said, &#x27;Hey, I was just on my way to a CSNY session and I just don&#x27;t feel like going there. Let&#x27;s go make some rock and roll.&#x27; So, we packed our bags and came to L.A. and wound up with the Tonight&#x27;s the Night album.&quot; The album was recorded at S.I.R. Studios, or Studio Instrument Rentals, a Hollywood musical instrument rental business managed by Bruce Berry&#x27;s brother, Ken. Young commandeered the facility&#x27;s rehearsal space, knocked a hole through a wall to run cables and built a makeshift studio. &quot;Briggs rented a lot of recording equipment from Wally Heider, including a sixteen-track tape machine, some outboard gear, microphones, and a tube recording console called the Green Board,&quot; Young explains in &quot;Special Deluxe&quot;. Drummer Ralph Molina remembers the setting in an April 2023 interview: 

Young explains further in an August 1975 interview with Cameron Crowe for Rolling Stone: 

Much of the album was recorded live in the studio and features a raw sound. Young&#x27;s voice is sore on several tracks, and notably cracks during an emotional moment in &quot;Mellow My Mind&quot;. Drummer Ralph Molina shares &quot;I still get chills when it gets to that fuckin&#x27; note. It&#x27;s so real. I&#x27;ll tell ya, man, Neil was right there with us. He was wide open.&quot; Young discusses the album&#x27;s sound in a 1975 NME interview: &quot;Those mixes were a little unorthodox. Like it&#x27;s real music. Sometimes I&#x27;d be on mic and sometimes I&#x27;d be two feet off it. Sometimes I&#x27;d be lookin&#x27; around the room and singin&#x27; back off mic … we&#x27;d have to bring it way back up in the mix to get it. And you can hear the echo in the room. We were all on stage at SIR just playing, with the PA system and everything, just like a live thing.&quot;

In addition to the album tracks, the group also attempted the older songs &quot;Wonderin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Alone&quot; and &quot;One More Sign&quot; while at S.I.R. Joni Mitchell dropped by the sessions and sang her recent song &quot;Raised on Robbery&quot; with the group. In his memoir, Young describes the performance as &quot;the most sexy and revealing version that song ever had. She still refuses to let me release it. I don&#x27;t know what the hell she was thinking when she joined us and sang the song. It kicks ass. What the fuck was that about? It was funkier than anything she has ever cut. A total gem!&quot; Outtakes from the sessions were made available in 2020 on &quot;Neil Young Archives Volume II: 1972–1976&quot;.

At the conclusion of the sessions, the group performed the new repertoire in a series of inaugural concerts at the newly opened Roxy Theatre. The shows were released in 2018 as &quot;&quot;. The group also toured behind the material in North America and the United Kingdom. 

==Early version==
The album was recorded in August and September 1973, but not released until June 1975. The album was initially shelved. In interviews and on his website, Young has described an earlier, more somber version of &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot;. In a 1985 interview with Adam Swetting of The Melody Maker, Young explains that &quot;The original &quot;Tonight&#x27;s The Night&quot; was much heavier than the one that hit the stands. The original one had only nine songs on it. It was the same takes, but the songs that were missing were Lookout Joe and Borrowed Tune, a couple of songs that I added. They fit lyrically but they softened the blow a little bit. What happened was the original had only nine songs but it had a lot of talking, a lot of mumbling and talking between the group and me, more disorganized and fucked-up sounding than the songs, but they were intros to the songs. Not counts but little discussions, three and four word conversations between songs, and it left it with a spooky feeling. It was like you didn&#x27;t know if these guys were still gonna be alive in the morning, the way they were talking. More like a wake than anything else.&quot; 

Neil Young&#x27;s father, Scott Young, wrote of it in his memoir, &quot;Neil and Me&quot;: Ten years after the original recording, David Briggs and I talked about &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot;, on which he had shared the producer credit with Neil. At home a couple of weeks earlier he had come across the original tape, the one that wasn&#x27;t put out. &quot;I want to tell you, it is a handful. It is unrelenting. There is no relief in it at all. It does not release you for one second. It&#x27;s like some guy having you by the throat from the first note, and all the way to the end.&quot; After all the real smooth stuff Neil had been doing, David felt most critics and others simply failed to read what they should have into &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; – that it was an artist making a giant growth step. Neil came in during this conversation, which was in his living room. When David stopped Neil said, &quot;You&#x27;ve got that original? I thought it was lost. I&#x27;ve never been able to find it. We&#x27;ll bring it out someday, that original.&quot;

Young described the experience of sharing the album for the first time with his record company in a November 1978 Tony Schwartz interview for Newsweek: 

==Later sessions==
Between the shelving of the album and its ultimate release, Young tinkered with the running order, re-recording some songs and adding new songs. In spring 1974, he made a new attempt at the title track in an upbeat, power trio version recorded with Ralph Molina and Greg Reeves of CSNY. He also recorded an acoustic version of &quot;New Mama&quot; and a banjo performance of &quot;Mellow My Mind&quot; at his ranch. Different running orders of the album were proposed, incorporating songs from the &quot;On the Beach&quot; sessions. An acetate of one such alternate version circulated as a bootleg and included the songs &quot;Walk On&quot;, &quot;For the Turnstiles&quot;, &quot;Bad Fog of Loneliness&quot;, &quot;Winterlong&quot; and &quot;Traces&quot;. The released album ultimately reflected the original concept and running order. Archivist Joel Bernstein explained in an August 1988 interview: 

==Release==
After abandoning the album, in 1974, Young recorded and released &quot;On the Beach&quot;, went on tour with CSNY, and recorded the album &quot;Homegrown&quot;. At a listening party for the completed &quot;Homegrown&quot;, Young decided to change course, and elected to release &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; instead. Young played the new album to a group of friends including members of The Band, and &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; happened to be on the same reel. Young explains in &quot;Waging Heavy Peace&quot;: &quot;Ben Keith and I played the tapes one midnight in what is now known as the Belushi bungalow of Hollywood&#x27;s Chateau Marmont Hotel for Rick Danko of The Band and some other musicians. Rick said after hearing &quot;Homegrown&quot; and then &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot;, &quot;You ought to put THAT out! What the hell is THAT?&quot; So we did. It was Rick Danko who brought it back.&quot; Young further explains to Cameron Crowe: 

The released album largely matches the original running order, but without the dialogue between the songs, and with an additional three tracks. Young explains to Bud Scuppa: &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night didn&#x27;t come out right after it was recorded because it wasn&#x27;t finished. It just wasn&#x27;t in the right space, it wasn&#x27;t in the right order, the concept wasn&#x27;t right. I had to get the color right, so it was not so down that it would make people restless. I had to keep jolting every once in a while to get people to wake up so they could be lulled again.&quot; Young told Cameron Crowe how the final running order was selected: 

The decision to release the album in 1975 presented considerable career risk. In a 1987 interview with Dave Fanning, Young recalls: 

==Liner notes==
Included with the early original vinyl releases of &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; is a cryptic message written by Young: &quot;I&#x27;m sorry. You don&#x27;t know these people. This means nothing to you.&quot;

On the front of the insert is a letter to a character called &quot;Waterface&quot;; scratched into the run-out grooves on side one is the message &quot;Hello Waterface&quot; while the run-out grooves on side two read &quot;Goodbye Waterface&quot;. No explanation is given to this person&#x27;s identity. In Jimmy McDonough&#x27;s &quot;Shakey&quot;, Young says that &quot;Waterface is the person writing the letter. When I read the letter, I&#x27;m Waterface. It&#x27;s just a stupid thing—a suicide note without the suicide.&quot; The picture of Roy Orbison in the insert is taken from a bootleg tape Young came across and, feeling bad that Orbison most likely did not know the bootleg existed, printed it in the insert for him to see.

The back of the insert has some text superimposed over the credits to Young&#x27;s &quot;On the Beach&quot; album, released a year earlier. This text is reportedly the lyrics to a &quot;Homegrown&quot;-era unreleased song titled &quot;Florida&quot;, characterized by McDonough as &quot;a cockamamie spoken-word dream, set to the shrieking accompaniment of either Young or [Ben] Keith drawing a wet finger around the rim of a glass.&quot;

When unfolded, a whole side of the insert features a lengthy article printed entirely in Dutch. It is a review of a &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; live show by Dutch journalist Constant Meijers for the Dutch rock music magazine &quot;Muziekkrant OOR&quot;. In 1976 Young said he chose to print it &quot;Because I didn&#x27;t understand any of it myself, and when someone is so sickened and fucked up as I was then, everything&#x27;s in Dutch anyway.&quot; Meijers later spent a week at Young&#x27;s ranch in California: during this visit, Young explained that he chose the article after some Dutch girls who were visiting him translated the story and made him aware of the fact &quot;that someone on the other end of the world exactly understood what he was trying to say.&quot;

The Reprise Records label on the vinyl copy was printed in black and white rather than the standard orange color, a process Young undertook again on the CD label art for 1994&#x27;s &quot;Sleeps with Angels&quot;. Early editions of the sleeve were made on blotter paper.

In &quot;Shakey&quot;, Young maintains that along with the inserts there was a small package of glitter inside the sleeve that was meant to fall out (&quot;our Bowie statement&quot;), spilling when the listener took the record out. However, neither McDonough nor Young archivist Joel Bernstein have yet found a copy of &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; featuring the glitter package.

==Critical reception==
Dave Marsh wrote in the original &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review:

In a follow-up review published in the 1983 edition of &quot;The New Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot;, Marsh writes:
Chris Fallon of &quot;PopMatters&quot; said, &quot;&quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; is that one rare record I will never tire of.&quot;

<doc id="723447" wikidata="Q264397" url="?curid=723447" title="After the Gold Rush">
<text>After the Gold Rush is the third studio album by the Canadian-American musician Neil Young, released in September 1970 on Reprise Records. It is one of four high-profile solo albums released by the members of folk rock group Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young in the wake of their chart-topping 1970 album &quot;Déjà Vu&quot;. Young&#x27;s album consists mainly of country folk music along with several rock tracks, including &quot;Southern Man&quot;. The material was inspired by the unproduced Dean Stockwell-Herb Bermann screenplay &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot;.

&quot;After the Gold Rush&quot; entered &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop Albums chart on September 19, and peaked at number eight in October. Two of the three singles taken from the album, &quot;Only Love Can Break Your Heart&quot; and &quot;When You Dance I Can Really Love&quot;, made it to number 33 and number 93 respectively on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Despite a mixed initial reaction, the album has since appeared on a number of greatest albums of all time lists.

In 2014, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Background==
Young recorded the album while living in Topanga Canyon, an artistic community in Southern California. It was largely recorded in his home studio there. Songs on the album were influenced by people he met while living there, including producer David Briggs, Young&#x27;s then wife, Susan Acevedo, and actor Dean Stockwell, whom he met through Susan. The album was recorded with members of both of his associated groups at the time, Crazy Horse and Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, as well as the first appearance by long-time collaborator Nils Lofgren. By the time the album was released, however, Young had split with Susan and had moved to his Broken Arrow Ranch in Northern California, where he would record many of his subsequent albums.

==Writing==
Songs on the album were inspired by a screenplay written by Dean Stockwell and Herb Bermann also titled &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot;. The screenplay&#x27;s plot involves an apocalyptic ecological disaster that washes away the Topanga Canyon hippie community. Stockwell, a lifelong friend of Young, was also part of the Topanga Canyon artist culture of the time. Mutual friend Dennis Hopper encouraged Stockwell to write his own screenplay in wake of Hopper&#x27;s success with &quot;Easy Rider&quot;. Stockwell recalls writing the script: Young recalls coming in contact with the script in his 2012 memoir &quot;Waging Heavy Peace&quot;: 

In Young&#x27;s biography &quot;Shakey&quot;, the script, now lost, is described as an end of the world movie which culminates in a tidal wave crashing into local music venue and hangout The Topanga Corral. Stockwell explains, &quot;I was gonna write a movie that was personal, a Jungian self-discovery of the gnosis. It involved the Kabala; it involved a lot of arcane stuff.&quot; In a December 1995 interview with Nick Kent for Mojo Magazine, Young recalls: 

Ultimately, only two songs on the album were directly influenced by or had been intended for use in the film: &quot;After the Goldrush&quot; and &quot;Cripple Creek Ferry&quot;. The lyrics to &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot; were inspired by a dream and consider a future when mankind uses space travel to perpetuate the species in wake of environmental destruction.

The chorus of &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; features the memorable chorus question &quot;Tell me why/ Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself/ When you&#x27;re old enough to repay/ But young enough to sell?&quot; Young shares in a June 1988 interview for Spin Magazine that the lyrics lost meaning for him over time, and made it difficult to sing the song live: 

The song &quot;Only Love Can Break Your Heart&quot; was written for Graham Nash in the aftermath of his breakup with Joni Mitchell. Nash would tell Constant Meijers in September 1974: &quot;I&#x27;d broken up with Joni and Neil came to me and said he&#x27;d written a song for me, because he knew exactly how I felt. Joni is one of those people who can&#x27;t make a good relationship last. When we were doing alright, she quit.&quot;

The lyrics to &quot;Southern Man&quot; address slavery and segregation. The intensity of the song was influenced by conflict with Young&#x27;s then wife, Susan Acevedo: &quot;&#x27;Southern Man&#x27; was an angry song. I wrote &#x27;Southern Man&#x27; in my studio in Topanga. Susan was angry at me for some reason.&quot; &quot;Those girls always get jealous when you&#x27;re working on something with great intensity. Susan, who was a lot older than me, was very jealous. One morning, I got up early to work on &#x27;Southern Man&#x27; in the studio, she threw breakfast against the door. When I opened the door to see what was going on, she threw the coffee at me.&quot;

&quot;Oh Lonesome Me&quot; is a cover of the 1957 Don Gibson song, recorded in a somber and radically different arrangement than the original. Young&#x27;s arrangement dates from his coffeehouse folk days in Toronto in late 1965: &quot;I wanted to give the acoustic solo thing a try in the Village (Yorkville). I took my acoustic twelve-string to a few gigs and got some bad reviews. I had an arrangement of &#x27;Oh Lonesome Me&#x27; that I really liked, and people laughed at it, thinking it was a parody or something. I used it on &#x27;After the Gold Rush&#x27;, and that worked.&quot; The song is the first recording by Young to feature harmonica, as well as the first song Young recorded that he didn&#x27;t write himself. The song was released as a single in advance of the album in February 1970.

The lyrics to &quot;Don&#x27;t Let It Bring You Down&quot; deal with falling into depression, and how new experiences or acquaintances can snap you back out. Young explains to &quot;Spin&quot; in 1988: &quot;Every once in awhile something could happen, especially when I was younger, that would get me really depressed, then I would run into somebody and forget about it, just because I got into an another thing. People are wonderful that way; the presence of another human being can be so strong that it’ll change your whole outlook.&quot; Young wrote the song during his first transatlantic trip, while touring with CSNY. On the album &quot;4 Way Street&quot;, Young jokes as he introduces the song: &quot;Here is a new song. It&#x27;s guaranteed to bring you right down. It&#x27;s called &#x27;Don&#x27;t Let It Bring You Down&#x27;. It sort of starts off real slow and then it fizzles out all together.&quot;

&quot;Birds&quot; dates from at least 1968. Young attempted recording the song several times before the take featured on &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot;. One attempt, available on his &quot;Archives&quot; website, was recorded as a duet with new bandmate Graham Nash. Its lyrics concern a breakup, using bird imagery as metaphor.

&quot;I Believe in You&quot; is a somber ode to abandoned love. Young describes the song in a June 1988 &quot;Spin&quot; interview: 

==Recording==
Young would once again employ David Briggs as producer for the sessions, as he did for his first two albums. Sessions took place over the course of a year, from August 1969 to June 1970 and were held at both professional recording studios and at a recently built studio in Young&#x27;s Topanga Canyon home. During the recording of the album, Young toured with both Crazy Horse and Crosby, Stills and Nash, and made solo concert appearances. Sessions also overlapped with sessions for &quot;Déjà Vu&quot;, to which Young contributed the songs &quot;Helpless&quot; and &quot;Country Girl&quot;.

Initial sessions were conducted with backing band Crazy Horse at Sunset Sound Studios in August 1969. The sessions followed the band&#x27;s tour of North America in support of &quot;Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere&quot; from February to June of that year. Although progress was hampered by the deteriorating health of rhythm guitarist Danny Whitten, the sessions yielded two album tracks, &quot;I Believe In You&quot; and &quot;Oh, Lonesome Me&quot;. Songs &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Alone&quot;, &quot;Wonderin&#x27;&quot; and an alternate take of &quot;Birds&quot; were also recorded but not used for the album. The sessions coincided with rehearsals for Crosby, Stills and Nash&#x27;s tour in support of their debut album. Young was asked to join the group to facilitate performing the group&#x27;s material in a live setting. Young would explain to author Nick Kent: 

After the sessions, Young embarked on a tour of the US with Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young that would include their now-famous appearance at Woodstock. The band would also make appearances at the Big Sur Folk Festival and on American television. In October, Young would again resume sessions with Crazy Horse at Sunset Sound and Larrabee Sound Studios, recording Whitten&#x27;s &quot;Look at All the Things&quot; and Young&#x27;s &quot;Dance, Dance, Dance&quot; and &quot;Winterlong,&quot; each of which would go unused. In November, Young booked time with CSNY at Wally Heider Studios to record &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; before resuming their tour of North America followed by January appearances in Europe. In February and March, Young toured North America with Crazy Horse, performing the shows that would later see release on &quot;Live at the Fillmore East&quot;. Young&#x27;s split attention between Crazy Horse and CSNY would result in some resentment from the latter band: 

The bulk of the album was recorded in mid-March 1970 in Young&#x27;s home studio in Topanga Canyon, dubbed &quot;Redwood Studios&quot;. Young recalls building the studio in the liner notes to &quot;Decade&quot;: &quot;I put the wood on the walls myself and loved that feeling. My house was on a steep hill overlooking the canyon. The French horn player ran out of breath on my steep driveway.&quot; Musicians for these sessions generally feature CSNY bassist Greg Reeves, Crazy Horse drummer Ralph Molina and burgeoning eighteen-year-old musical prodigy Nils Lofgren of the Washington, D.C.–based band Grin on piano. The incorporation of Lofgren was a characteristically idiosyncratic decision by Young, as Lofgren had not played keyboards on a regular basis prior to the sessions. Along with Jack Nitzsche, Lofgren would join an augmented Crazy Horse sans Young before enjoying success with his own group as well as solo cult success and membership in Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s E Street Band. Biographer Jimmy McDonough has asserted that Young was intentionally trying to combine Crazy Horse and CSNY on this release, with members of the former band appearing alongside Stephen Stills and Reeves. The album features several song where Young performs on piano as the primary instrument; &quot;Oh, Lonesome Me&quot; also features his first use of harmonica on record.

The April session for &quot;When You Dance, I Can Really Love&quot; at Young&#x27;s Topanga home studio marks the last time Crazy Horse played together with Danny Whitten. Young remembers in a post on his website: &quot;Danny Whitten could not make the sessions but he did come in at the end and recorded with us, doing a lot of chorus singing on many songs and playing on one song, &quot;When You Dance I Can Really Love&quot;. Jack Nitzsche was there on a wild piano. Billy Talbot on bass. What a memory that is! Ralph Molina played drums on every track.&quot; He continues in his memoir: He further reminisces in &quot;Shakey&quot;: 

The final session for the album produced the song &quot;Birds.&quot; &quot;Birds&quot; was recorded on June 30, 1970, at Sound City Studios during a break in CSNY&#x27;s summer tour. Young had made several previous attempts to record the song. The first attempt was in August 1968 with Jim Messina on bass and George Grantham on drums for Young&#x27;s debut album. During the August 1969 Sunset Sound sessions, Young recorded a version featuring vibes with Crazy Horse that was erroneously released as the b-side to &quot;Only Love Can Break Your Heart.&quot; The version lacks the second verse. Young explains in the biography &quot;Shakey&quot;: &quot;The electric version of &quot;Birds&quot; with vibes turned out to be great, but it was only half the song. After the first verse I stopped. Forgot the second verse.&quot; Later that month during a break in CSNY&#x27;s first tour, Young recorded a duet version on acoustic guitar with Graham Nash on vocals. The final take used on the album features Young on solo piano accompanied by members of Crazy Horse on vocals.

==Album cover==
The album cover was designed by art director Gary Burden, who would go on to work with Young on his album covers until his death in 2018. Young describes the relationship in his memoir, &quot;Waging Heavy Peace&quot;: 

The cover art is a solarized image of Young passing an old woman at the New York University School of Law campus in the Greenwich Village district of New York City. The picture was taken by photographer Joel Bernstein and was reportedly out of focus. It was because of this he decided to mask the blurred face by solarizing the image. The photo is cropped; the original image included Young&#x27;s friend and CSNY bandmate Graham Nash. 

The back cover features a picture of the back of a pair of Young&#x27;s jeans with several patches. His wife at the time, Susan Acevedo, would patch his jeans using her own hair as thread. Young explains in &quot;Waging Heavy Peace&quot;: 

==Release==
&quot;After the Gold Rush&quot; was originally released on vinyl by Reprise on September 19, 1970. It was subsequently reissued on CD in 1986.

&quot;After the Gold Rush&quot; is one of four high-profile albums (all charting within the top fifteen) released by each of the members of folk rock collective Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young in the wake of their chart-topping 1970 album &quot;Déjà Vu&quot;, along with &quot;Stephen Stills&quot; (Stephen Stills, November 1970), &quot;If I Could Only Remember My Name&quot; (David Crosby, February 1971) and &quot;Songs for Beginners&quot; (Graham Nash, May 1971).

Lead single &quot;Only Love Can Break Your Heart&quot; entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart on October 24, 1970. An outtake version of &quot;Birds&quot; recorded at the initial Sunset Sound sessions has now been added to the album on the Neil Young Archives website, as have two versions of the song &quot;Wonderin&#x27;&quot;. The Sunset Sound &quot;Birds&quot; was first released, accidentally, as the B-Side of the &quot;Only Love Can Break Your Heart&quot; single.

A remastered version was released on HDCD-encoded CD and digital download on July 14, 2009, as part of the Neil Young Archives Original Release Series. The remastered CD exists both as a standalone album and as Disc 3 of a 4-CD box set &quot;Official Release Series Discs 1-4&quot;, released in the US in 2009 and Europe in 2012.

To mark its 50th anniversary, a CD version of the album was re-released by Reprise on December 11, 2020, as &quot;After The Gold Rush 50th Anniversary Edition&quot;, the original cover having been enhanced with a 50 below its title. A limited edition vinyl box set came out on March 19, 2021. The re-release includes two different versions of the song &quot;Wonderin&#x27;&quot; – on the CD as two extra tracks and in the vinyl box set as a 45rpm single in a picture sleeve. Side A, originally included on the &quot;Topanga 3&quot; disc in &quot;The Archives Vol. 1: 1963-1972&quot;, was recorded in Topanga, California, in March 1970; Side B is a previously unreleased version recorded at Sunset Sound in Hollywood in August 1969.

Digital high-resolution files of the album are also available via the Neil Young Archives website, including a longer 3:36 outtake of &quot;Birds&quot; recorded at the same Sunset Sound sessions as &quot;Wonderin&#x27;&quot;.

==Reception==

Critics were not immediately impressed; the 1970 review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine by Langdon Winner was negative, with Winner feeling that, &quot;none of the songs here rise above the uniformly dull surface.&quot; &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau was more enthusiastic, saying: &quot;While David Crosby yowls about assassinations, Young divulges darker agonies without even bothering to make them explicit. Here the gaunt pain of &quot;Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere&quot; fills out a little—the voice softer, the jangling guitar muted behind a piano. Young&#x27;s melodies—every one of them—are impossible to dismiss. He can write &#x27;poetic&#x27; lyrics without falling flat on his metaphor even when the subject is ecology or crumbling empire. And despite his acoustic tenor, he rocks plenty. A real rarity: pleasant and hard at the same time.&quot;

Critical reaction has improved with time; by 1975, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was referring to the album as a &quot;masterpiece&quot;, and &quot;Gold Rush&quot; is now considered a classic album in Young&#x27;s recording career.

===Accolades===
&quot;After the Gold Rush&quot; has appeared on a number of greatest albums lists. In 1998 &quot;Q&quot; magazine readers voted &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot; the 89th greatest album of all time. It was ranked 92nd in a 2005 survey held by British television&#x27;s Channel 4 to determine the 100 greatest albums of all time. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named the album the 71st greatest album of all time, 74th in a 2012 revised list, and 90th in the 2020 list. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; listed it 99th on their 2004 list of the &quot;Top 100 Albums of the 1970s&quot;. In 2006, &quot;Time&quot; magazine listed it as one of the &quot;All-Time 100 Albums&quot;. It was ranked third in Bob Mersereau&#x27;s 2007 book &quot;The Top 100 Canadian Albums&quot;. Its follow-up album, &quot;Harvest&quot;, was named the greatest Canadian album of all time in that book. In 2005, &quot;Chart&quot; magazine readers placed it fifth on a poll of the best Canadian albums. In 2002, &quot;Blender&quot; magazine named it the 86th greatest &quot;American&quot; album. &quot;New Musical Express&quot; named it the 56th greatest album of all time in 2013.

<text>Back injuries result from damage, wear, or trauma to the bones, muscles, or other tissues of the back. Common back injuries include sprains and strains, herniated discs, and fractured vertebrae. The lumbar spine is often the site of back pain. The area is susceptible because of its flexibility and the amount of body weight it regularly bears. It is estimated that low-back pain may affect as much as 80 to 90 percent of the general population in the United States.

== Classification ==
===Soft tissue graded system===
Muscle and soft tissue injuries can be classified using a graded system. 
* Grade 1 muscle strain is the least severe with damage to few muscle fibers and little if any loss of function. 
* Grade 2 muscle strain indicates a mild to moderate injury with appreciable tissue damage and some loss of function or strength. 
* Grade 3 muscle strain is the most severe injury grade with the muscle being either completely torn or experiencing complete loss of function.

===AO spine injury classification system===
Spinal column or vertebral injuries can be classified using the AO spine injury classification system. The three categories - A, B, and C - are based on the location of damage on the vertebra (either on the anterior or posterior segment) and by the direction of the applied injurious force. 
* Type A injuries are those associated with a compression force with damage to the vertebral bodies.
* Type B injuries are those associated with a distraction force resulting in structural damage to the posterior components of the vertebral column.
* Type C injuries are those associated with damage to both anterior and posterior aspects of the vertebral column resulting in displacement of the disconnected segments in any direction.
This classification system can be used to classify injury to the cervical, thoracolumbar, and sacral regions of the spinal column.

===MSU classification for herniated discs===
Herniated discs can be graded based on the size and location of the herniation as seen on an MRI.

====Size====
The size of the herniation is the extent to which it protrudes into the vertebral foramen. The MSU Classification for herniated discs uses the proximity of the disc to the facet joint when measuring the size of a herniated disc. Using the MSU Classification, a grade of 1, 2 or 3 can be used to describe the size of a herniated disc with 1 being the least severe and 3 being the most severe.

====Location====
The location of the herniation can also be described using the MSU Classification for herniated discs. This classification describes how far away from mid-line a disc protrusion is using a grade of A, B, or C. 
* Grade A describes a herniation at midline. 
* Grade C herniations are the most lateral and protrude into the intervertebral foramen (through which spinal nerves travel). 
* Grade B herniated discs are those located between grade A and C, using the facet joint as the landmark for the lateral border. 
MSU Classification is primarily used for classifying herniated discs in the lumbar spine.

== Causes ==
Many back injuries share similar causes. Strains and sprains to the back muscles can be caused by improper movements while lifting heavy loads, overuse of a muscle, sudden forceful movements, or direct trauma. Herniated discs are associated with age-related degeneration, trauma such as a fall or car accident, and bending or twisting while lifting heavy weights. Common causes of vertebral fractures include trauma from a direct blow, a compression force resulting in improper or excessive axial loading, and hyper-flexion or hyper-extension.

Vertebral fractures in children or elderly individuals can be related to the development or health of their spine. The most common vertebral fracture in children is spondylolysis which can progress to spondylolisthesis. The immature skeleton contains growth plates which have not yet completely ossified into stronger mature bone. Vertebral fractures in elderly individuals are exacerbated by weakening of the skeleton associated with osteoporosis.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis of a back injury begins with a physical examination and thorough medical history by health-care personnel. Some injuries, such as sprains and strains or herniated discs, can be diagnosed in this manner. To confirm these diagnoses, or to rule out other injuries or pathology, imaging of the injured region can be ordered. X-rays are often used to visualize pathology of bones and can be ordered when a vertebral fracture is suspected. CT scans produce higher resolution images when compared to x-rays and can be used to view more subtle fractures which may otherwise go undetected on x-ray. MRI is commonly referred to as the gold standard for visualizing soft tissue and can be used to assist with diagnosing many back injuries, including herniated discs and neurological disorders, bleeding, and edema.

== Prevention ==
Suggestions for preventing various back injuries primarily address the causes of those injuries. The risk for back sprains and strains may be reduced with lifestyle choices, including smoking cessation, limiting alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight, and keeping bones and muscles strong with adequate exercise and a healthy diet. The risk for disc herniations can be reduced by using proper techniques when lifting heavy loads, smoking cessation, and weight loss to reduce the load placed on the spine. Vertebral fractures may be difficult to prevent since common causes are related to accidents or age-related degeneration associated with osteoporosis. Treating osteoporosis with pharmacotherapy, enrolling in a fall prevention program, strengthening muscles and bones with a weight-bearing exercise program, and adopting a nutritional program that promotes bone health are all options to reduce the risk of vertebral fractures associated with osteoporosis.

== Treatment ==
Treatment for back injuries depends on the diagnosis, level of pain, and whether there is loss of function or quality of life.

=== Conservative ===
* Cold therapy reduces inflammation, edema, pain, and muscle spasms associated with acute back injury.
* Heat therapy is used to reduce pain and alleviate sore and stiff muscles. Heat therapy is proposed to work by facilitating delivery of nutrients and oxygen to the site of injury to accommodate healing.
* Medication: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen can be taken to reduce mild to moderate pain associated with back injuries. NSAIDs are suggested to be more effective for persistent pain than for acute pain. If pain remains intolerable while taking over the counter medications, a stronger pain medication such as a narcotic or a muscle relaxant can be prescribed at a physician&#x27;s discretion.
* Therapy and alternative medicine: an active approach to recovery is recommended over bed rest for most cases of back injury. Activity promotes strength and functional rehabilitation and counters atrophy associated with disuse. Physical therapy can help reduce pain and regain strength and function. The gentle movement of yoga and tai chi are suggested to improve function and to counter the negative psychosocial effects that can be secondary to injury. Spinal manipulation, massage, and acupuncture have been used to treat the pain associated with various back injuries, but there is little consensus on their degree of effectiveness.
* Injections: Spinal nerve blocks and epidural injections are options available to alleviate pain and neurological symptoms. Injections of anesthetics alleviate pain while steroid injections can be used to reduce the inflammation and swelling surrounding spinal nerves.

=== Non-Conservative ===
Surgery is considered when symptoms persist after attempting conservative treatment. It is estimated 10-20 percent of individuals with low back pain fail to improve with conservative measures.
* A discectomy is a common procedure used to alleviate the radiating pain and neurological symptoms associated with a herniated disc. There are multiple variations of a discectomy with differing approaches to access the herniated disc, but the goal of the procedure is to remove the portion of the intervertebral disc that is protruding into the vertebral foramen.
* A total disc replacement can also be performed to address a herniated disc. Rather than removing only the portion of the disc that has prolapsed as in a discectomy, this procedure involves removing the entire vertebral disc and replacing it with an artificial one.
* Surgical remedies for vertebral fractures are found to be more effective than conservative treatment. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are considered minimally invasive surgical procedures and are proposed to relieve pain and restore function of fractured vertebrae.

== Epidemiology ==
* The two age groups with the highest rate of vertebral column injuries are ages 15–29 and 65 and older.
* An estimated 50 percent of spinal injuries are attributed to motor vehicle accidents.
* Although the majority of vertebral fractures go undiagnosed, the annual cost related to treatment of vertebral fractures is estimated to be $1 billion in the U.S.

<text>Crazy Horse ( , ; – September 5, 1877) was a Lakota war leader of the Oglala band in the 19th century. He took up arms against the United States federal government to fight against encroachment by White American settlers on Native American territory and to preserve the traditional way of life of the Lakota people. His participation in several famous battles of the Black Hills War on the northern Great Plains, among them the Fetterman Fight in 1866, in which he acted as a decoy, and the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876, in which he led a war party to victory, earned him great respect from both his enemies and his own people.

In September 1877, four months after surrendering to U.S. troops under General George Crook, Crazy Horse was fatally wounded by a bayonet-wielding military guard while allegedly resisting imprisonment at Camp Robinson in northwestern Nebraska. He was honored by the U.S. Postal Service in 1982 with a 13¢ Great Americans series postage stamp.

==Early life==
Sources differ on the precise year of Crazy Horse&#x27;s birth, but most agree he was born between 1840 and 1845. According to Šúŋka Bloká (He Dog), he and Crazy Horse &quot;were both born in the same year at the same season of the year,&quot; which census records and other interviews place in 1842. Ptehé Wóptuȟ’a (Encouraging Bear), an Oglala medicine man and spiritual adviser to Crazy Horse, reported that Crazy Horse was born &quot;in the year in which the band to which he belonged, the Oglala, stole One Hundred Horses, and in the fall of the year,&quot; a reference to the annual Lakota calendar or winter count. Among the Oglala winter counts, the stealing of 100 horses is noted by Cloud Shield, and possibly by American Horse and Red Horse owner, as equivalent to the year 1840–41. Oral history accounts from relatives on the Cheyenne River Reservation place his birth in the spring of 1840. On the evening of his son&#x27;s death, the elder Crazy Horse told Lieutenant H.R. Lemly that the year of birth was 1840.

===Immediate family===

Crazy Horse was born to parents from two different bands of the Lakota division of the Sioux, his father being an Oglala and his mother a Miniconjou. His father, born in 1810, was also named Tȟašúŋke Witkó (Crazy Horse). Crazy Horse was named Čháŋ Óhaŋ (Among the Trees) at birth, meaning he was one with nature. His mother, Tȟašína Ȟlaȟlá Wiŋ (Rattling Blanket Woman, born 1814), gave him the nickname Pȟehíŋ Yuȟáȟa (Curly Son/Curly) or Žiží (Light Hair) as his light, curly hair resembled her own. She died when Crazy Horse was only four years old.

One account said that after the son had reached maturity and shown his strength, his father gave him his name and took a new one, Waglúla (Worm). Another version of how the younger Crazy Horse acquired his name is that he took it after going through the haŋbléčheya ceremony. Crazy Horse&#x27;s cousin (son of Hewáŋžiča, Lone Horn) was Maȟpíya Ičáȟtagya (Touch the Clouds). He saved Crazy Horse&#x27;s life at least once and was with him when he died.

Rattling Blanket Woman or Tȟašína Ȟlaȟlá Wiŋ (1814–1844) was the daughter of Black Buffalo and White Cow (also known as Iron Cane). Her older siblings were Lone Horn (born 1790, died 1877) and Good Looking Woman (born 1810). Her younger sister was named Looks At It (born 1815), later given the name They Are Afraid of Her. The historian George Hyde wrote that Rattling Blanket Woman was Miniconjou and the sister of Spotted Tail, who became a Brulé head chief. She may have been a member of either of the family of Lone Horn, one of the leaders of the Miniconjou. She was said to be beautiful and a fast runner.

In 1844, while out hunting buffalo, Waglula helped defend a Lakota village under attack by the Crow. In gratitude he gave Waglula his two eldest daughters as wives: Iron Between Horns (age 18) and Kills Enemy (age 17). Corn&#x27;s youngest daughter, Red Leggins, who was 15 at the time, requested to go with her sisters; all became Waglula&#x27;s wives. When Waglula returned with the new wives, Rattling Blanket Woman, who had been unsuccessful in conceiving another child, thought she had lost favor with her husband and hanged herself. Waglula went into mourning for four years. Rattling Blanket Woman&#x27;s sister, Good Looking Woman, came to offer herself as a replacement wife and stayed on to raise Crazy Horse. Other versions of the legend posit that she was grief-stricken by the deaths of those she knew; that her husband accused her of running off with her brother-in-law; or that she had an affair with a European-American man.

According to Frederick Hoxie&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia of North American Indians&quot;, Crazy Horse was the third in his male line to bear the name of Crazy Horse. The love of his life was Tȟatȟáŋkasápawiŋ (Black Buffalo Woman), whom he courted, but she married another man named Mní Níča (No Water). At one point, Crazy Horse persuaded Black Buffalo Woman to run away with him. No Water borrowed a pistol and ran after his wife. When he found her with Crazy Horse, he fired at him, injuring him in the face and leaving a noticeable scar. Crazy Horse was married two times, first to Tȟašinásápawiŋ (Black Shawl) and second to Nellie Larrabee (Laravie). Nellie Larrabee was given the task of spying on Crazy Horse for the military, so the marriage is suspect. Only Black Shawl bore him any children, a daughter named Kȟokípȟapiwiŋ (They Are Afraid of Her), who died at age three.

===Visions===
Crazy Horse lived in a Lakota camp in present-day Wyoming with his younger half-brother, Little Hawk, son of Iron Between Horns and Waglula. Little Hawk was the nephew of his maternal step-grandfather, Long Face, and a cousin, High Horse. In 1854, the camp was entered by Lieutenant John Lawrence Grattan and 29 other U.S. troopers, who intended to arrest a Miniconjou man for having stolen a cow. The cow had wandered into the camp, and after a short time, someone butchered it and passed the meat out among the people. Grattan went to Conquering Bear, saying the Sioux should arrest the guilty party and turn him over. Conquering Bear refused but offered a horse as compensation for the cow. Ending the discussion, when Grattan began walking back to his soldiers and Conquering Bear had turned to walk back, one of Grattan&#x27;s soldiers fatally shot Conquering Bear in the back. The Lakota killed all 30 soldiers and a civilian interpreter in what was later called the Grattan massacre.

After witnessing the death of Conquering Bear at the Grattan massacre, Crazy Horse began to get trance visions. Curly went out on a vision quest to seek guidance but without going through the traditional procedures first. In his vision, a warrior on his horse rode out of a lake and the horse seemed to float and dance throughout the vision. He wore simple clothing, no face paint, his hair down with just a feather in it, and a small brown stone behind his ear. Bullets and arrows flew around him as he charged forward, but neither he nor his horse was hit. A thunderstorm came over the warrior, and his people grabbed hold of his arms trying to hold him back. The warrior broke their hold and then lightning struck him, leaving a lightning symbol on his cheek, and white marks like hailstones appeared on his body. The warrior told Curly that as long he dressed modestly, his tribesmen did not touch him, and he did not take any scalps or war trophies, he would not be harmed in battle. As the vision ended, he heard a red-tailed hawk shrieking off in the distance. Curly&#x27;s father later interpreted the vision and said that the warrior was going to be him. The lightning bolt on his cheek and the hailstones on his body were to become his war paint. Curly was to follow the warrior&#x27;s role to dress modestly and to do as the warrior&#x27;s prophecy said so he would be unharmed in battle. For the most part, the vision was true and Crazy Horse was rarely harmed in battle, except for when he was struck by an arrow after taking two enemy scalps. He was shot in the face by No Water when Little Big Man tried to hold Crazy Horse back to prevent a fight from breaking out, and he was held back by one of his tribesmen—according to some reports, Little Big Man himself—when he was stabbed by a bayonet the night he died.

His father &quot;Waglula&quot; took him to what today is Sylvan Lake, South Dakota, where they both sat to do a &quot;hemblecha&quot; or vision quest. A red-tailed hawk led them to their respective spots in the hills; as the trees are tall in the Black Hills, they could not always see where they were going. Crazy Horse sat between two humps at the top of a hill north and to the east of the lake. Waglula sat south of Black Elk Peak but north of his son.

Crazy Horse&#x27;s vision first took him to the South where, in Lakota spirituality, one goes upon death. He was brought back and was taken to the West in the direction of the &quot;wakiyans&quot; (thunder beings). He was given a medicine bundle to protect him for life. One of his animal protectors would be the white owl which, according to Lakota spirituality, would give extended life. He was also shown his &quot;face paint&quot; for battle, to consist of a yellow lightning bolt down the left side of his face, and white powder. He would wet this and put marks over his vulnerable areas; when dried, the marks looked like hailstones. His face paint was similar to that of his father, who used a red lightning strike down the right side of his face and three red hailstones on his forehead. Crazy Horse put no make-up on his forehead and did not wear a war bonnet. Lastly, he was given a sacred song that is still sung by the Oglala people today and he was told he would be a protector of his people.

Black Elk, a contemporary and cousin of Crazy Horse, related the vision in &quot;Black Elk Speaks: Being the Life Story of a Holy Man of the Oglala Sioux&quot;, from talks with John G. Neihardt:
Crazy Horse received a black stone from a medicine man named Horn Chips to protect his horse, a black-and-white pinto he named &quot;Inyan&quot; (rock or stone). He placed the stone behind the horse&#x27;s ear so that the medicine from his vision quest and Horn Chips would combine—he and his horse would be one in battle. The more accepted account, however, is that Horn Chips gave Crazy Horse a sacred stone that protected him from bullets. Subsequently, Crazy Horse was never wounded by a bullet. In addition, &quot;Horn Chips&quot; is not the correct name of this medicine man, though it has become a repeated error since its first publication in 1982. His Lakota name was &quot;Woptura&quot;, and he was given the name &quot;Chips&quot; by the government and was referred to as Old Man Chips. Horn Chips was one of his sons, who was also known as Charles Chips.

===Personality===
Crazy Horse was known to have a personality characterized by aloofness, shyness, modesty and lonesomeness. He was generous to the poor, the elderly, and children. In &quot;Black Elk Speaks,&quot; Neihardt relays:

Crazy Horse was said to have &quot;deplored alcohol and its effect on tribes.&quot;

==War leadership==
===Title of &quot;Shirt Wearer&quot;===
Through the late 1850s and early 1860s, Crazy Horse&#x27;s reputation as a warrior grew, as did his fame among the Lakota. The Lakota told accounts of him in their oral histories. His first kill was a Shoshone raider who had murdered a Lakota woman washing buffalo meat along the Powder River. Crazy Horse fought in numerous battles between the Lakota and their traditional enemies, the Crow, Shoshone, Pawnee, Blackfeet, and Arikara, among the Plains tribes.

In 1864, after the Third Colorado Cavalry decimated Cheyenne and Arapaho in the Sand Creek Massacre, Oglala and Minneconjou bands allied with them against the U.S. military. Crazy Horse was present at the Battle of Platte Bridge and the Battle of Red Buttes in July 1865. Because of his fighting ability and his generosity to the tribe, in 1865, Crazy Horse was named an &quot;Ogle Tanka Un&quot; (&quot;Shirt Wearer&quot;, or war leader) by the tribe.

===Battle of the Hundred in the Hand (Fetterman Fight)===
On December 21, 1866, Crazy Horse and six other warriors, both Lakota and Cheyenne, decoyed Capt. William Fetterman&#x27;s 53 infantrymen and 27 cavalry troopers under Lt. Grummond into an ambush. They had been sent out from Fort Phil Kearny to follow up on an earlier attack on a wood train. Crazy Horse lured Fetterman&#x27;s infantry up a hill. Grummond&#x27;s cavalry followed the other six decoys along Peno Head Ridge and down toward Peno Creek, where several Cheyenne women taunted the soldiers. Meanwhile, Cheyenne leader Little Wolf and his warriors, who had been hiding on the opposite side of Peno Head Ridge, blocked the return route to the fort. The Lakota warriors swept over the hill and attacked the infantry. Additional Cheyenne and Lakota hiding in the buckbrush along Peno Creek effectively surrounded the soldiers. Seeing that they were surrounded, Grummond headed his cavalry back to Fetterman.

The combined warrior forces of nearly 1,000 killed all the US soldiers in what became known at the time to the white population as the Fetterman Massacre. It was the Army&#x27;s worst defeat on the Great Plains up to that time. The Lakota and Cheyenne call it the Battle of the Hundred in the Hand.

===Wagon Box Fight===
On August 2, 1867, Crazy Horse participated in the Wagon Box Fight, also near Fort Phil Kearny. Lakota forces numbering between 1000 and 2000 attacked a wood-cutting crew near the fort. Most of the soldiers fled to a circle of wagon boxes without wheels, using them for cover as they fired at the Lakota. The Lakota took substantial losses as the soldiers were firing new breech-loading rifles. These could fire ten times a minute compared to the old muzzle-loading rate of three times a minute. The Lakota charged after the soldiers fired the first time, expecting the delay of their older muskets before being able to fire again. The soldiers suffered only five killed and two wounded, while the Lakota suffered between 50 and 120 casualties. Many Lakota were buried in the hills surrounding Fort Phil Kearny in Wyoming.

===Controversy over Black Buffalo Woman===
In the fall of 1870, Crazy Horse invited Black Buffalo Woman to accompany him on a buffalo hunt in the Slim Buttes area of present-day northwestern South Dakota. She was the wife of No Water, who had a reputation for drinking too much. It was the Lakota&#x27;s custom to allow a woman to divorce her husband at any time. She did so by moving in with relatives or with another man, or by placing the husband&#x27;s belongings outside their lodge. Although some compensation might be required to smooth over hurt feelings, the rejected husband was expected to accept his wife&#x27;s decision. No Water was away from camp when Crazy Horse and Black Buffalo Woman left for the buffalo hunt.

No Water tracked down Crazy Horse and Black Buffalo Woman in the Slim Buttes area. When he found them in a teepee, he called Crazy Horse&#x27;s name from outside. When Crazy Horse answered, No Water stuck a pistol into the teepee and aimed for Crazy Horse. Touch the Clouds, Crazy Horse&#x27;s first cousin and son of Lone Horn, was sitting in the teepee nearest the entry. He knocked the pistol upward as No Water fired, deflecting the bullet to Crazy Horse&#x27;s upper jaw. No Water left, with Crazy Horse&#x27;s relatives in hot pursuit. No Water ran his horse until it died and continued on foot until he reached the safety of his own village.

Several elders convinced Crazy Horse and No Water that no more blood should be shed. As compensation for the shooting, No Water gave Crazy Horse three horses. Because Crazy Horse was with a married woman, he was stripped of his title as Shirt Wearer (leader).

===Black Shawl and Nellie Larrabee===
Crazy Horse married Black Shawl, a member of the Oglala Lakota and a relative of Spotted Tail. The elders sent her to heal Crazy Horse after his altercation with No Water. Crazy Horse and Black Shawl Woman were married in 1871. Black Shawl gave birth to Crazy Horse&#x27;s only child, a daughter named They Are Afraid Of Her, who died in 1873. Black Shawl outlived Crazy Horse. She died in 1927 during the influenza outbreaks of the 1920s.

Red Cloud also arranged to send a young woman, Nellie Larrabee, to live in Crazy Horse&#x27;s lodge. Interpreter William Garnett described Larrabee as &quot;a half-blood, not of the best frontier variety, an invidious and evil woman&quot;. Larrabee, also referred to as Chi-Chi and Brown Eyes Woman, was the daughter of a French trader and a Cheyenne woman. Garnett&#x27;s first-hand account of Crazy Horse&#x27;s surrender alludes to Larrabee as the &quot;half blood woman&quot; who caused Crazy Horse to fall into a &quot;domestic trap which insensibly led him by gradual steps to his destruction.&quot;

==Great Sioux War of 1876–77==
On June 17, 1876, Crazy Horse led a combined group of approximately 1,500 Lakota and Cheyenne in a surprise attack against brevetted Brigadier General George Crook&#x27;s force of 1,000 cavalry and infantry, and allied 300 Crow and Shoshone warriors in the Battle of the Rosebud. The battle, although not substantial in terms of human losses, delayed Crook&#x27;s joining the 7th Cavalry under George A. Custer. It contributed to Custer&#x27;s subsequent defeat at the Battle of the Little Bighorn.

A week later at 3:00 p.m. on June 25, 1876, Custer&#x27;s 7th Cavalry attacked a large encampment of Cheyenne and Lakota bands along the Little Bighorn River, marking the beginning of his last battle. Crazy Horse&#x27;s actions during the battle are unknown.

Hunkpapa warriors led by Chief Gall led the main body of the attack. Crazy Horse&#x27;s tactical and leadership role in the battle remains ambiguous. While some historians think that Crazy Horse led a flanking assault, ensuring the death of Custer and his men, the only proven fact is that Crazy Horse was a major participant in the battle. His personal courage was attested to by several eye-witness Indian accounts. Water Man, one of only five Arapaho warriors who fought, said Crazy Horse &quot;was the bravest man I ever saw. He rode closest to the soldiers, yelling to his warriors. All the soldiers were shooting at him, but he was never hit.&quot; Sioux battle participant Little Soldier said, &quot;The greatest fighter in the whole battle was Crazy Horse.&quot; Crazy Horse is said to have exhorted his warriors before the fight with the battle cry &quot;Hóka-héy! Today is a good day to die!&quot; but the quotation is inaccurately attributed. The earliest published reference is from 1881, in which the phrase is attributed to Low Dog. The English version is not an accurate translation from the Lakota language, &quot;Hóka-héy!&quot; Both phrases are used in context by Black Elk in Black Elk Speaks.

On September 10, 1876, Captain Anson Mills and two battalions of the Third Cavalry captured a Miniconjou village of 36 tipis in the Battle of Slim Buttes, South Dakota. Crazy Horse and his followers attempted to rescue the camp and its headman, (Old Man) American Horse, but they were unsuccessful. The soldiers killed American Horse and much of his family after they holed up in a cave for several hours.

On January 8, 1877, Crazy Horse&#x27;s warriors fought their last major battle at Wolf Mountain, against the US Cavalry in the Montana Territory. His people struggled through the winter, weakened by hunger and the long cold. Crazy Horse decided to surrender with his band to protect them, and went to Fort Robinson in Nebraska.

==Last Sun Dance of 1877==
The Last Sun Dance of 1877 is significant in Lakota history as the Sun Dance held to honor Crazy Horse one year after the victory at the Battle of the Little Big Horn, and to offer prayers for him in the trying times ahead. Crazy Horse attended the Sun Dance as the honored guest but did not take part in the dancing. Five warrior cousins sacrificed blood and flesh for Crazy Horse at the Last Sun Dance of 1877. The five warrior cousins were three brothers, Flying Hawk, Kicking Bear and Black Fox II, all sons of Chief Black Fox, also known as Great Kicking Bear, and two other cousins, Eagle Thunder and Walking Eagle. The five warrior cousins were braves considered vigorous battle men of distinction.

==Surrender and death==

Crazy Horse and other northern Oglala leaders arrived at the Red Cloud Agency, located near Fort Robinson, Nebraska, on May 5, 1877. Together with He Dog, Little Big Man, Iron Crow and others, they met in a solemn ceremony with First Lieutenant William P. Clark as the first step in their formal surrender.

For the next four months, Crazy Horse resided in his village near the Red Cloud Agency. The attention that Crazy Horse received from the Army drew the jealousy of Red Cloud and Spotted Tail, two Lakota who had long before come to the agencies and adopted the white ways. Rumors of Crazy Horse&#x27;s desire to slip away and return to the old ways of life started to spread at the Red Cloud and Spotted Tail agencies. In August 1877 officers at Camp Robinson received word that the Nez Perce of Chief Joseph had broken out of their reservation in Idaho and were fleeing north through Montana toward Canada. When asked by Lieutenant Clark to join the Army against the Nez Perce, Crazy Horse and the Miniconjou leader Touch the Clouds objected, saying that they had promised to remain at peace when they surrendered. According to one version of events, Crazy Horse finally agreed, saying that he would fight &quot;till all the Nez Perce were killed.&quot; But his words were apparently misinterpreted by a half-Tahitian scout, Frank Grouard, a person not to be confused with Fred Gerard, another U.S. Cavalry scout during the summer of 1876. Grouard reported that Crazy Horse had said that he would &quot;go north and fight until not a white man is left.&quot; When he was challenged over his interpretation, Grouard left the council. Another interpreter, William Garnett, was brought in but quickly noted the growing tension.

With the growing trouble at the Red Cloud Agency, General George Crook was ordered to stop at Fort Robinson. A council of the Oglala leadership was called, then canceled, when Crook was incorrectly informed that Crazy Horse had said the previous evening that he intended to kill the general during the proceedings. Crook ordered Crazy Horse&#x27;s arrest and then departed; leaving the post commander at Fort Robinson, Lieutenant Colonel Luther P. Bradley, to carry out his order. Additional troops were brought in from Fort Laramie. On the morning of September 4, 1877, two columns moved against Crazy Horse&#x27;s village, only to find that it had scattered during the night. Crazy Horse had fled to the nearby Spotted Tail Agency with his wife, who had become ill with tuberculosis. After meeting with military officials at Camp Sheridan, the adjacent military post, Crazy Horse agreed to return to Fort Robinson with Lieutenant Jesse M. Lee, the Indian agent at Spotted Tail.

On the morning of September 5, 1877, Crazy Horse and Lieutenant Lee, accompanied by Touch the Clouds as well as a number of Indian scouts, departed for Fort Robinson. Arriving that evening outside the adjutant&#x27;s office, Lieutenant Lee was informed that he was to turn Crazy Horse over to the Officer of the Day. Lee protested and hurried to Bradley&#x27;s quarters to debate the issue, but without success. Bradley had received orders that Crazy Horse was to be arrested and taken under the cover of darkness to Division Headquarters. Lee turned the Oglala war chief over to Captain James Kennington, in charge of the post guard, who accompanied Crazy Horse to the post guardhouse. Once inside, Crazy Horse struggled with the guard and Little Big Man and attempted to escape. Just outside the door, Crazy Horse was stabbed with a bayonet by one of the members of the guard. He was taken to the adjutant&#x27;s office, where he was tended by the assistant post surgeon at the post, Valentine McGillycuddy, and died late that night.

The following morning, Crazy Horse&#x27;s body was turned over to his elderly parents, who took it to Camp Sheridan and placed it on a burial scaffold. The following month, when the Spotted Tail Agency was moved to the Missouri River, Crazy Horse&#x27;s parents moved the remains to an undisclosed location. There are at least four possible locations as noted on a state highway memorial near Wounded Knee, South Dakota. His final resting place remains unknown.

===Controversy over his death===
McGillycuddy, who treated Crazy Horse after he was stabbed, wrote that Crazy Horse &quot;died about midnight.&quot; According to military records, he died before midnight, making it September 5, 1877.

John Gregory Bourke&#x27;s memoir of his service in the Indian wars, &quot;On the Border with Crook&quot;, describes a different account of Crazy Horse&#x27;s death. He based his account on an interview with Crazy Horse&#x27;s rival, Little Big Man, who was present at Crazy Horse&#x27;s arrest and fatal wounding. The interview took place over a year after Crazy Horse&#x27;s death. Little Big Man said that, as Crazy Horse was being escorted to the guardhouse, he suddenly pulled two knives from under his blanket and held one in each hand. One knife was reportedly fashioned from an army bayonet. Little Big Man, standing behind him, seized Crazy Horse by both elbows, pulling his arms up behind him. As Crazy Horse struggled, Little Big Man lost his grip on one elbow, and Crazy Horse drove his own knife deep into his own lower back. The guard stabbed Crazy Horse with his bayonet in the back, who then fell and surrendered to the guards.

When Bourke asked about the popular account of the guard bayoneting Crazy Horse first, Little Big Man said that the guard had thrust with his bayonet, but that Crazy Horse&#x27;s struggles resulted in the guard&#x27;s thrust missing entirely and lodging his bayonet into the frame of the guardhouse door. Little Big Man said that in the hours immediately following Crazy Horse&#x27;s wounding, the camp commander had suggested the story of the guard being responsible to hide Little Big Man&#x27;s role in the death of Crazy Horse and avoid any inter-clan reprisals.

Little Big Man&#x27;s account is questionable; it is the only one of 17 eyewitness sources (from Lakota, US Army, and &quot;mixed-blood&quot; individuals) that fails to attribute Crazy Horse&#x27;s death to a soldier at the guardhouse. The author Thomas Powers cites various witnesses who said Crazy Horse was fatally wounded when his back was pierced by a guard&#x27;s bayonet.

The identity of the soldier responsible for the bayoneting of Crazy Horse is also debated. Only one eyewitness account actually identifies the soldier as Private William Gentles. Historian Walter M. Camp circulated copies of this account to individuals who had been present who questioned the identity of the soldier and provided two additional names. To this day, the identification remains questioned.

==Photograph controversy==

Most sources question whether Crazy Horse was ever photographed. Valentine McGillycuddy doubted any photograph of the war leader had been taken. In 1908, Walter Camp wrote to the agent for the Pine Ridge Reservation inquiring about a portrait. &quot;I have never seen a photo of Crazy Horse,&quot; Agent Brennan replied, &quot;nor am I able to find any one among our Sioux here who remembers having seen a picture of him. Crazy Horse had left the hostiles but a short time before he was killed and it&#x27;s more than likely he never had a picture taken of himself.&quot;

In 1956, a small tintype portrait purportedly of Crazy Horse was published by J. W. Vaughn in his book &quot;With Crook at the Rosebud&quot;. The photograph had belonged to the family of the scout Baptiste &quot;Little Bat&quot; Garnier. Two decades later, the portrait was published with further details about how the photograph was produced at Fort Robinson, though the editor of the book &quot;remained unconvinced of the authenticity of the photograph.&quot;

In the late 1990s the original tintype was on exhibit at the Custer Battlefield Museum in Garryowen, Montana. The museum says that it is the only authentic portrait of Crazy Horse. Historians continue to dispute the identification.

Experts argue that the tintype was taken a decade or two after 1877. The evidence includes the individual&#x27;s attire, the length of the hair pipe breastplate, and the ascot tie, which closely resembles the attire of Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Indian performers active from 1883 to the early 1900s. Other experts point out that the gradient lighting in the photo indicates a skylight studio portrait, common in larger cities. In addition, no other photograph with the same painted backdrop has been found. Several photographers passed through Fort Robinson and the Red Cloud Agency in 1877—including James H. Hamilton, Charles Howard, David Rodocker and possibly Daniel S. Mitchell—but none used the backdrop that appears in the tintype. After the death of Crazy Horse, Private Charles Howard produced at least two images of the famed war leader&#x27;s alleged scaffold grave, located near Camp Sheridan, Nebraska.

==Legacy==
In the view of author Chris Hedges, &quot;there are few resistance figures in American history as noble as Crazy Horse,&quot; while adding that &quot;his ferocity of spirit remains a guiding light for all who seek lives of defiance.&quot;

===Memorials===
====Memorial sculpture====
Crazy Horse is commemorated by the incomplete Crazy Horse Memorial in the Black Hills of South Dakota, near the town of Berne. Like the nearby Mount Rushmore National Memorial, it is a monument carved out of a mountainside. The sculpture was begun by Polish-American sculptor Korczak Ziółkowski, who had worked under Gutzon Borglum on Mount Rushmore, in 1948. Plans call for the completed monument to be wide and high.
Ziółkowski was inspired to create the Crazy Horse Memorial after receiving a letter from native Lakota chief Henry Standing Bear, who asked if Ziółkowski would be interested in creating a monument for the native North Americans to show that the Indian nations also have their heroes. The Native Americans consider Thunderhead Mountain, where the monument is being carved, to be sacred ground. Thunderhead Mountain is situated between Custer and Hill City. Upon completion, the head of Crazy Horse will be the world&#x27;s largest sculpture of the human head, measuring approximately tall, more than 27 feet taller than the 60-foot faces of the U.S. Presidents depicted on Mount Rushmore, and the Crazy Horse Memorial as a whole will be the largest sculpture in the world.

The memorial is funded entirely by private donations, with no assistance from the U.S. federal government. There is no target completion date at this time; however, in 1998, the face of Crazy Horse was completed and dedicated. The Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation regularly takes the lead in cultural, social and educational events, including the Volksmarch, the occasion on which the public is allowed into the actual monument grounds. The foundation generates most of its funds from visitor fees, with visitors numbering more than one million annually.

The monument has been the subject of controversy. In Ziółkowski&#x27;s vision, the sculpted likeness of Crazy Horse is dedicated to the spirit of Crazy Horse and all Native Americans. It is well known that Crazy Horse did not want to be photographed during his lifetime and is reportedly buried in an undisclosed location. While Lakota chief Henry Standing Bear believed in the sincerity of the motives, many Native Americans still oppose the intended meaning of the memorial. Opponents of the monument have likened it to pollution and desecration of the landscape and environment of the Black Hills, and of the ideals of Crazy Horse himself.

====Other====
Crazy Horse has two highways named after him, both called the Crazy Horse Memorial Highway. In South Dakota, the designation has been applied to a portion of US 16/US 385 between Custer and Hill City, which passes by the Crazy Horse Memorial. In November 2010, Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman approved designating US 20 from Hay Springs to Fort Robinson in honor of Crazy Horse, capping a year-long effort by citizens of Chadron. The designation may extend east another 100 miles through Cherry County to Valentine.

Crazy Horse School in Wanblee, South Dakota is named after him.

<text>Crazy Horse is an American rock band best known for their association with the musician Neil Young. Since 1969, fifteen studio albums and eight live albums have been billed as being by Neil Young and Crazy Horse. They have also released six studio albums of their own between 1971 and 2009.

Billy Talbot (bass) and Ralph Molina (drums) have been the only consistent members of the band across its fifty-five years. Founding guitarist Danny Whitten died in 1972 after recording two studio albums, &quot;Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere&quot; (with Young) and &quot;Crazy Horse&quot;. Except for two notable intervals, Frank &quot;Poncho&quot; Sampedro (rhythm guitar) regularly performed with the group from 1975 until 2014. On four of Crazy Horse&#x27;s stand-alone studio albums, Talbot and Molina serve as the rhythm section to different sets of musicians. 

Following Sampedro&#x27;s retirement, Nils Lofgren, an early member of Crazy Horse between 1970 and 1971, rejoined the group. The quartet of Young, Talbot, Molina and Lofgren recorded three studio albums between 2019 and 2022. In 2024, guitarist Micah Nelson, who had previously played with Young in Promise of the Real, replaced Lofgren.

==History==
===Early years===
The band&#x27;s origins date to 1963 and the Los Angeles-based a cappella doo-wop group Danny &amp; the Memories, which consisted of lead singer Danny Whitten and supporting vocalists Lou Bisbal (soon to be replaced by Benjamin Rocco, the husband of actress Lorna Maitland), Billy Talbot, and Ralph Molina.

Sly Stone produced a single for the group (by then re-christened the Psyrcle) in San Francisco on Lorna Records (a subsidiary of Autumn Records) ; however, it did not sell very well either regionally or nationally.

Back in Los Angeles, the group evolved over the course of several years into the Rockets, a psychedelic pop/folk rock ensemble that juxtaposed the rudimentary instrumental abilities of Whitten (rhythm guitar), Talbot (bass) and Molina (drums) against the more accomplished Bobby Notkoff (violin) and Leon Whitsell (lead guitar). After leaving the group as sessions for their first album commenced, the mercurial and reclusive Whitsell was promptly replaced by his younger brother George, a R&amp;B-influenced guitarist also respected in the band&#x27;s social circle. After Leon petitioned to return, it was decided that both Whitsells would remain in the group.

This sextet recorded the Rockets&#x27; only album, a self-titled record released in 1968 on White Whale Records. Whitten and Leon Whitsell contributed four songs apiece, with one song credited to Talbot and Molina and another, &quot;Pill&#x27;s Blues&quot;, to George Whitsell. Whitten&#x27;s &quot;Let Me Go&quot; was prominently covered by Three Dog Night on their 1968 debut album; during this period, vocalist Danny Hutton considered recruiting Whitten for that band.

Although their album sold only about 5,000 copies, the Rockets soon re-connected with Neil Young, whom they had met two years earlier during the early days of Buffalo Springfield. In August 1968, three months after Buffalo Springfield dissolved, Young played with the group during a Rockets performance at the Whisky a Go Go; Molina would later recall that Young&#x27;s idiosyncratically distinctive guitar style &quot;blew George Whitsell&#x27;s away. He was kind of overshadowed.&quot;

===With Neil Young, 1968–1970===
Shortly after the club collaboration, Young enlisted Whitten, Talbot, and Molina to back him on his second solo album. Although all parties initially envisaged the Rockets continuing as a separate project, the older band soon folded due to Young&#x27;s insistence on having his new backing trio keep to a strict practice schedule. According to George Whitsell, &quot;My understanding was Neil was gonna use the guys for a record and a quick tour, bring &#x27;em back and help us produce the next Rockets album. It took me a year and a half to realize that my band had been taken.&quot;

Credited to Neil Young with Crazy Horse, &quot;Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere&quot; was released in May 1969. During a 98-week chart stay, it peaked at No. 34 on the Billboard 200 in August 1970 after Young had come to greater prominence as a member of Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young. It included the U.S. No. 55 pop hit &quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot;; the extended, jam-driven &quot;Down by the River&quot; and &quot;Cowgirl in the Sand&quot;; and a panoply of country and folk-influenced songs exemplified by the spare title track and &quot;Running Dry (Requiem for the Rockets),&quot; a florid tribute to the defunct band that featured a guest appearance by Notkoff.

Crazy Horse toured clubs with Young throughout the first half of 1969 and, following the October 1969 addition of frequent Young collaborator Jack Nitzsche on electric piano, in early 1970. The latter tour was showcased on the 2006 album &quot;Live at the Fillmore East&quot;. Young would later say that &quot;[on] some of the stuff, Nitzsche was in the way, tonally... Crazy Horse was so good with the two guitars, bass and drums it didn&#x27;t &quot;need&quot; anything else.&quot; Although Nitzsche openly disdained the rhythm section of Talbot and Molina, he retrospectively lauded Whitten (who was of Scotch-Irish American ancestry) as &quot;the only Black man in the band.&quot;

While Young worked on his second album with Crazy Horse (including takes of Whitten&#x27;s &quot;Look at All the Things&quot;, Whitten &amp; Young&#x27;s &quot;Come On Baby Let&#x27;s Go Downtown&quot; and Young&#x27;s &quot;Helpless&quot; and &quot;Winterlong&quot;) throughout the summer and autumn of 1969, Young joined Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash as a full fourth member contemporaneously, recording an album and touring with the ensemble in 1969 and 1970. When Young returned to his solo album in 1970, Crazy Horse found its participation more limited. The group as a whole appears on just three of the eleven tracks on &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot;, which was credited solely to Young upon its September 1970 release: &quot;When You Dance I Can Really Love&quot;, &quot;I Believe in You&quot;, and a cover of Don Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Oh Lonesome Me&quot; from the 1969 sessions. Even though Talbot&#x27;s appearances on the album were confined to the Crazy Horse tracks, Molina was the project&#x27;s main drummer (often performing in an ad hoc backing ensemble with emergent singer-songwriter/multi-instrumentalist Nils Lofgren and CSNY bassist Greg Reeves on the non-Crazy Horse tracks), while Whitten continued to contribute backing vocals and guitar to several songs (including &quot;Southern Man&quot; and &quot;Only Love Can Break Your Heart&quot;, a U.S. No. 33 hit) despite his escalating heroin abuse.

Young &quot;fired&quot; the group in the aftermath of the 1970 tour due to Whitten&#x27;s addiction (partially attributable to his severe rheumatoid arthritis, for which he had previously received a medical discharge from the United States Navy) following an incapacitated performance during the Fillmore East engagement. According to Molina, Whitten also felt that Young was &quot;holdin&#x27; him back&quot; as a guitarist and songwriter. Decades later, the extant recordings from the 1969 sessions (most notably a heretofore unknown iteration of &quot;Helpless&quot;, long presumed lost due to an engineering error) were combined with select alternate mixes from &quot;Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere&quot; on &quot;Early Daze&quot; (2024).

===With and without Young, late 1970–1989===
Despite Young&#x27;s dismissal, Crazy Horse capitalized on its newfound exposure and recorded its eponymous debut album for Reprise Records that year. The band retained Nitzsche (who co-produced the album with Bruce Botnick) and added Lofgren as a second guitarist; singer-songwriter and guitarist Ry Cooder also sat in on three tracks at the behest of Nitzsche to substitute for the ailing Whitten. Although the album peaked at only No. 84 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in 1971, Whitten&#x27;s &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Talk About It&quot; would later be covered by a wide range of artists, including Geoff Muldaur, the Indigo Girls, Pegi Young, and Rod Stewart.

Following the commercial failure of &quot;Crazy Horse&quot;, Lofgren and Nitzsche left the group to resume their solo careers; meanwhile, Whitten&#x27;s drug problems pushed Talbot and Molina to dismiss him and turn to outside musicians. The band released two albums (&quot;Loose&quot; and &quot;At Crooked Lake&quot;) on different labels to critical and commercial failure in 1972; along with Talbot and Molina, guitarist/singer-songwriter Greg Leroy was the only musician to appear on both albums. While the former saw Rockets guitarist George Whitsell briefly return to the fold, fronting the band in conjunction with Leroy and keyboardist John Blanton, the latter was dominated by the polished country rock of Rick and Mike Curtis, formerly of These Vizitors and best known for their later work as the Curtis Brothers.

In the fall of 1972, Young placed Whitten on retainer with a view toward including the guitarist in his new touring band, the Stray Gators. However, following his poor performance in rehearsals at Dress Review Sound Studio in Hollywood, the band pressured Young to dismiss him. Although Young let Whitten live on his ranch near Woodside, California and worked with him one-on-one during off-hours in an unsuccessful effort to keep him in the group, Young fired him and Whitten died several hours later after returning to Los Angeles, his death attributed to a fatal overdose of alcohol and Valium.

After Whitten&#x27;s death and the tepid reception of their most recent albums, Talbot and Molina were left as the only members of the band. They let the Crazy Horse name go unused while resolving not to retire it altogether. In mid-1973, Young brought together a band comprising Talbot, Molina, Lofgren, and pedal steel guitarist Ben Keith to record a new album, the majority of which became the basis of 1975&#x27;s &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night.&quot; In the autumn of 1973, that ensemble (initially billed as Crazy Horse for the inaugural concerts at the Roxy in September 1973) toured Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States as the Santa Monica Flyers. Molina and Whitsell would subsequently contribute to Young&#x27;s &quot;On the Beach&quot; in 1974.

Shortly after aborted Young sessions involving Talbot, Molina and Keith at Chicago&#x27;s Chess Studios in late 1974, the band spontaneously reconvened without Keith at Talbot&#x27;s Echo Park home in 1975. These jam sessions cemented the role of rhythm guitarist Frank &quot;Poncho&quot; Sampedro, a friend of Talbot who began to play with the group during the Chicago sessions and would go on to be a long-time member of Crazy Horse. &quot;It was great,&quot; Talbot would say of the gathering and the chemistry it evoked. &quot;We were all soaring. Neil loved it. We all loved it. It was the first time we heard the Horse since Danny Whitten died.&quot;

After the five-year hiatus since 1970, Young, Crazy Horse, and producer David Briggs, quickly recorded &quot;Zuma&quot; in the summer of 1975, in the basement of Briggs&#x27; rented house in Malibu. Sampedro&#x27;s lack of technical proficiency at the time (&quot;Neil kept writin&#x27; simpler songs so I could play them&quot;) and desire to see Young &quot;rockin&#x27; and having fun&quot; would greatly inform the sound of the record.

Following a warmup tour of unannounced appearances at various San Francisco Bay Area bars (dubbed by the media as the Rolling Zuma Revue in contrast to Bob Dylan&#x27;s contemporaneous Rolling Thunder Revue) in December 1975, Young and the band toured Japan and Europe from March to April 1976. However, they were shut out of a proposed leg of touring when Young re-kindled his collaboration with Stephen Stills. Crazy Horse toured America that autumn when Young was forced to make up a series of canceled concert dates after leaving the Stills-Young tour before it was finished.

Following sessions in November 1975 for an aborted Crazy Horse album, the band went on to appear on both 1977&#x27;s &quot;American Stars &#x27;n Bars&quot; (including several discrete tracks and the entire first side, which was credited to an expanded lineup [Neil Young, Crazy Horse and the Bullets] with Ben Keith, violinist Carole Mayedo and backing vocalists Linda Ronstadt and Nicolette Larson) and on two tracks (&quot;Look Out for My Love&quot; and &quot;Lotta Love&quot;) on 1978&#x27;s &quot;Comes a Time&quot;. 

In 1978, Crazy Horse released &quot;Crazy Moon&quot;, their fourth original album. It features instrumental contributions from Young, Bobby Notkoff, Greg Leroy, and Michael Curtis. Before the album&#x27;s release, the band joined Young on the autumn 1978 arena tour that served as both the basis of the live/studio album &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot; and the tour document &quot;Live Rust&quot;, both released in 1979 and credited to Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse.

As Young spent much of the eighties pursuing his most experimental work to date, Crazy Horse recorded with him more sporadically after the critically disparaged 1981 album &quot;Re·ac·tor&quot;. The band began to record &quot;Trans&quot; (1982) before Young designated the project as a solo album, and a 1984 album was abandoned after their performances were dubbed by Young and Briggs as subpar. Following sporadic performances in 1984 and 1985, Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse toured in 1986 and recorded the album &quot;Life&quot; (1987).

Immediately thereafter, Young included all three members of Crazy Horse in a horn-augmented ensemble, the Bluenotes, and toured clubs in the fall of 1987. But when Talbot and Molina proved ill-suited to a blues-oriented approach, Young replaced them while retaining Sampedro, who would remain with Young in various band permutations over the next two years. During this period, Talbot and Molina hired former Rain Parade lead guitarist Matt Piucci and recruited Sonny Mone from Hanover, Massachusetts to provide lead vocals and rhythm guitar. With seven songs by Mone, this incarnation of the band recorded the pointedly-titled &quot;Left for Dead&quot;, released in 1989.

===Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse: 1990–2014===
The split with Sampedro and Young proved relatively short-lived, as the duo reunited with Talbot and Molina under the name Crazy Horse in 1990 for the acclaimed album &quot;Ragged Glory&quot; and for a tour in 1991 that generated the live album &quot;Weld&quot; and the sound collage &quot;Arc&quot;. Over the next 12 years, Crazy Horse would steadily collaborate with Young, joining him for &quot;Sleeps with Angels&quot; (1994), &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; (1996), the live album &quot;Year of the Horse&quot; (1997), the long-shelved &quot;Toast&quot; (recorded in 2001 and ultimately released in 2022) and &quot;Greendale&quot; (2003). Sampedro, who was instructed to sit out the recording of &quot;Greendale&quot; (as Young felt the material called for only one guitar) considered leaving the band; eventually, he participated on guitar and organ for the ensuing tour of 2003-2004.

According to Jimmy McDonough, Crazy Horse had begun a sixth album of its own in the mid-1990s, but left the project unfinished when Young called upon the group to join him for some secret club dates in California (for which the quartet billed themselves as the Echoes), leading to the recording of &quot;Broken Arrow&quot;.

Crazy Horse remained on hiatus for seven years following the &quot;Greendale&quot; tour. Although Sampedro was employed as a full-time assistant to Kevin Eubanks on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; from 1992 to 2010, the band continued to rehearse several times a year and more intermittently with Young during this period. &quot;Trick Horse&quot;—based on previously unreleased Crazy Horse recordings, possibly derived from older Sampedro-funded sessions where session musicians were hired to play the instrumental parts—was released on iTunes in 2009. According to Young in a 2011 interview with &quot;American Songwriter&quot;, &quot;They have to be together before I can be together with them. They haven&#x27;t been doing anything together, so they need to be able to do it. I don&#x27;t have the time to support things. I have to go with things that are going to support me. But I think they can do it.&quot;

Shortly thereafter, Young and Crazy Horse convened to record two new albums, both of which were released in 2012. &quot;Americana&quot; was composed entirely of covers, mostly of American folk music revival standards, while &quot;Psychedelic Pill&quot; featured original songs written by Young for the band. Young and Crazy Horse embarked on the Alchemy Tour throughout 2012 and 2013 in support of both albums, traveling to the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe.

In 2013, Talbot, Molina, George Whitsell, and lead vocalist/guitarist Ryan James Holzer formed Wolves. They released their first recording, &quot;Wolves EP&quot;, on February 16, 2014.

With the addition of background singers Dorene Carter and YaDonna West, Young and Crazy Horse toured Europe in the summer of 2014 to make-up cancelled dates from the Alchemy Tour, relating to an injury suffered by Sampedro. For the tour, longtime Young collaborator Rick Rosas stood in for Talbot, who was recovering from a minor stroke. Rosas died from pulmonary hypertension with cardiac arrest on November 8, less than three months after the tour concluded.

===Poncho&#x27;s departure, Lofgren&#x27;s return and renewed activity: 2018–present===
In May 2018, Lofgren joined Young, Talbot, and Molina for a series of five minimally advertised &quot;open rehearsal&quot; concerts in Fresno, California and Bakersfield, California, with the marquee reading &quot;NYCH&quot; (the band described by Young as the &quot;Horse of a Different Color&quot;). According to Young, &quot;Life is an unfolding saga [...] Poncho is unable to join us right now but we all hope he will be back.&quot; In 2021, Sampedro confirmed that he had retired from music due to complications from arthritis in both wrists and a 2013 finger injury: &quot;It became painful for me to be on the road. When we were on that last tour [in 2014], I was rolling down the road with both of my hands in ice buckets and one foot in an ice bucket, every night. That&#x27;s really not that much fun. Then I got my finger slammed in the door [on the 2013 European tour]. There were too many signs saying it was over for me. It wasn&#x27;t for any other reason. [...] I was messing things up on the last tour during the early songs in the set.&quot;

In February 2019, the Lofgren-era line-up performed two shows in Winnipeg. Its first album, &quot;Colorado&quot;, was released in October 2019, leading to the most prolific period of recording in the band&#x27;s history. A second album, &quot;Barn&quot;, was recorded entirely in Young&#x27;s barn in Colorado and released on December 10, 2021. In 2022, the band released the shelved album &quot;Toast&quot; (retaining Sampedro&#x27;s guitar parts) and later the same year they released a third album with Lofgren in the lineup, &quot;World Record&quot;. In 2023, the members of Crazy Horse released &quot;All Roads Lead Home&quot;, a compilation comprising primarily solo recordings made during the COVID-19 pandemic. Young contributed a live version of a Crazy Horse song, and the collection was released under the collective name of Molina, Talbot, Lofgren &amp; Young.

In September 2023, the band performed two shows celebrating the 50th anniversary of The Roxy, with Promise of the Real guitarist Micah Nelson filling in for Lofgren. &quot;Fuckin&#x27; Up&quot;, a live recording of a private November 4, 2023 performance of &quot;Ragged Glory&quot; at Toronto&#x27;s The Rivoli, was released on April 26, 2024; credited to &quot;Neil &amp; the Horse,&quot; it features a line-up of Young, Talbot, Molina, Lofgren and Nelson.

In April 2024, Neil Young and Crazy Horse launched the acclaimed North America-based Love Earth Tour under the aegis of Young, Talbot, Molina and Nelson. On June 26, the remaining dates of the tour were cancelled due to unspecified illnesses in the band.

==Re-issued recordings==
The self-titled debut album was re-issued on CD in 1994. In 2005, Rhino Records&#x27; Handmade division released the two-disc set, &quot;Scratchy: The Complete Reprise Recordings&quot;, in a limited edition of 2,500 copies. It included re-mastered versions of the debut album and their second, &quot;Loose&quot; in their entirety on the first disc, with the second disc containing nine rarities and out-takes (including both sides of a 1962 single by Danny and the Memories). The original set is currently out of print, but was re-issued on Rhino in England and Wounded Bird in the United States. &quot;Loose&quot; was also re-issued as a stand-alone CD by Wounded Bird in 2006. The Australian re-issue specialty label Raven Records put out &quot;Crazy Moon&quot; in 1999 with seven rare bonus tracks, as well as a 20-track retrospective in 2005, &quot;Gone Dead Train: The Best of Crazy Horse 1971–1989&quot;, featuring material from each of the group&#x27;s five albums, with the exception of its second one, &quot;Loose&quot;. &quot;Left for Dead&quot; was released in 1995 on the Sisapa/Curb label, and &quot;Crazy Moon&quot; was re-issued on CD again as a BMG import in 2005. &quot;At Crooked Lake&quot; was re-issued in 2013 on the Floating World label.

<text>Söderåsen is a northwest–southwest elongated bedrock ridge in Scania in southern Sweden. On Söderåsen is Scania&#x27;s highest point at above sea level. It is intersected by several fissure valleys. The ridge extends from Röstånga in the southeast to the Åstorp in northwest.

Söderåsen National Park is located east of Helsingborg in Scania.

==Geography==
In Swedish the word &quot;ås&quot; commonly refer to eskers, a glacial landform, but in the case of Söderåsen it corresponds to a tectonic landform called horst in the Sorgenfrei-Tornquist Zone. The last glacial ice sheet, the Weichsel ice, left the area of Söderåsen 14,000 to 13,500 years BP. Following this there was a period up to 12,700 years BP of cold non-glacial conditions with permafrost and strong winds.

=== Kopparhatten ===
On Söderåsen is the viewpoint Kopparhatten at a height of . It is the highest point in Söderåsens national park. This part of the hill has a particularly dramatic landscape, with up to deep ravines. Various nivation hollows exists in the vicinity of Kopparhatten.

===Streams===
The Kvärkabäcken and Skäralid streams that traverses Söderåsen are believed to be antecedent rivers that existed prior to the present-day relief. These rivers may date to Neogene times when the South Småland peneplain formed. The streams were then likely modified by meltwater during the deglaciations.

=== Oden Lake ===
Oden Lake () is a lake in Scania, in Sweden and belongs to Söderåsens National park. The lake is circular in shape, with a diameter of and it is deep. Oden Lake likely formed from a glacier niche, and the name Oden Lake may have been due to the circular shape as compared to the Norse god Odin&#x27;s one eye. Earlier views have suggested the lake may be a volcanic explosion crater, a nivation hollow or formed by fluvial erosion or as plunge pool of glacial meltwater. These various theories that had accumulated up to the 1980s were proposed by Alfred Gabriel Nathorst, Lennart von Post, Mats Åkesson and Anders Rapp among others.

== Flora, fauna, and funga ==
The landscape offers views of leafy deciduous forests and powerful screes with high rocks, flowing watercourses and wide vistas.

The forest, is made up of different types of wood as for example beech, oak and ash. The ground of the forest is covered with a notable amount of plant species. The area is rich with mushrooms, insects, water creatures, mosses, birds and bats.

Because of the rugged landscape, many characteristics of primeval forest have been preserved, such as an abundance of dead trees. This makes the insect life rich, with many rare beetles. The flora is also extremely rich, with species such as hollowwort, enchanter&#x27;s nightshade and tall meadow-rue.
== Söderåsen National Park ==
The Söderåsen National Park () is a designated area of about . It was established in 2001 in the municipalities of Klippan and Svalöv and ranges from the Skäralid ravine in the north to the Nackarpsdalen in the south. It was already a protected area, and when it became a national park, the protection of the land increased.

Some of the noted features in the national park are the Oden Lake in Nackarpsdalen and the viewpoints Kopparhatten, Hjortsprånget and Lierna along the Skäralidsdalen.

<text>Skagafjörður () is a municipality that covers most of the land area of the region around the fjord with the same name (see Skagafjörður for details on the region) in northern Iceland.

==Overview==
The municipality was created in 1998 when 11 out of the 12 municipalities in Skagafjörður held votes on whether they should merge or not. The merge was approved in all the municipalities that held the vote. Akrahreppur was the only municipality in Skagafjörður that did not participate. In February 2022, residents of Akrahreppur and Skagafjörður voted to merge into a single municipality; the merger will be formalized in the spring of 2022.

The merge joined the town of Sauðárkrókur, the villages of Hofsós and Varmahlíð and several rural districts. It also includes the historic cathedral site of Hólar which is the site of a growing university today.

During the winter after the 1976 season, Dennis Lehman, who along with the Philadelphia Phillies Promotions Director, Frank Sullivan, thought the team needed a mascot similar to the Padres&#x27; San Diego Chicken. The Phanatic was created by Harrison/Erickson of New York City. Bonnie Erickson had ties with Jim Henson&#x27;s Muppets as designer of Miss Piggy and Statler and Waldorf. Instead of a number on the back of his jersey, he wears a star. The character was named for the fanatical fans of the team.

According to Bill Giles, the Phanatic was created to attract more families to the Phillies&#x27; home, Veterans Stadium.

The Phanatic replaced &quot;Philadelphia Phil&quot; and &quot;Philadelphia Phillis&quot;, a pair of siblings dressed in 18th-century garb to invoke the city&#x27;s revolutionary spirit from 1776. The pair were in the team logo from 1976 through 1978, and were part of the team&#x27;s &quot;Home Run Spectacular&quot; at The Vet from 1971 through 1979. They reappeared with their replacement as the Phillies celebrated their final year at Veterans Stadium in 2003, including opening day and the final game.

The Phanatic debuted on April 25, 1978, at The Vet, when the Phils played the Chicago Cubs. He was formally introduced to the public on the locally produced children&#x27;s show &quot;Captain Noah and His Magical Ark&quot; by then-Phillies player Tim McCarver, who was doing promotional work for the team.

In his book &quot;Pouring Six Beers at a Time&quot;, Giles wrote of the worst decision of his life when it came to the creation of the Phanatic. The design would cost $5,200 for both the costume and the copyright ownership, or $3,900 just for the costume with Harrison/Erickson retaining the copyright. Giles chose to just buy the costume. Five years later, when Giles and his group of investors bought the team from Ruly Carpenter, the franchise paid $250,000 to Harrison/Erickson for the assignment of the copyright.

==Portrayers==
The Phanatic was originally portrayed by David Raymond. In 1976, Raymond had a summer internship within the team&#x27;s front office. He returned in 1977. Raymond was asked to portray the mascot in 1978, which he did until 1993. Raymond&#x27;s father is Delaware Blue Hens Hall of Fame coach Tubby Raymond. David Raymond was inducted into the Delaware Sports Hall of Fame in 2024. Since 1993, Tom Burgoyne has portrayed the Phanatic, although in public – in order to retain the illusion that the Phanatic is a real creature – Burgoyne maintains that he is only the Phanatic&#x27;s &quot;best friend&quot;.

A major change occurred in the Phanatic&#x27;s portrayal because Raymond is left-handed while Burgoyne is right-handed – despite Raymond&#x27;s desire that his replacement be left-handed.

===Appearance change===

On August 2, 2019, the Phillies filed a lawsuit against the Phanatic creators for exercising their rights to renegotiate the 1984 licensing assignment according to copyright law. In response, in 2020, the Phillies unveiled an updated Phanatic, which included lighter-green fur, arm-scales, star-shaped eyelids, powder-blue feathers, a longer tail, a shorter nose and red shoes.

The Phillies regained the rights to original Phanatic beginning in the 2022 season after a settlement with Harrison/Erickson, the mascot&#x27;s copyright owners and the creators.

==Performance==

The Phanatic rides around on an ATV. During games, the Phanatic wanders the stadium, greeting fans and humorously mocking supporters of the opposition. The Phanatic performs a number of regular routines on the field before the game and between innings. Some of these routines are:

* Taunting the visiting team by dancing provocatively in front of their dugout, mocking the actions of their players, and smashing or stomping on an object, such as a batting helmet, representing the team.
* Standing on the roof of the Phillies dugout between halves of the seventh inning for &quot;The Phanatic Dance&quot; and remaining on the dugout roof for the home half of the inning to &quot;hex&quot; the opposing pitcher.
* Warming up in the bullpen.
* Shooting hot dogs into the stands using a pneumatic gun attached to his ATV.
* Visiting the various broadcast booths and committing various pranks such as pouring popcorn on the broadcasters, spraying Silly String on them, or serving them Philly cheesesteaks.
* Buffing the heads of any bald fans who happen to be sitting near him in the stands.

His mother, Phoebe Phanatic, occasionally appears on-field with the Phanatic. He also has a younger cousin Phred, and a girlfriend Phiona who are rarely seen. According to the Phanatic&#x27;s official biography, his birthplace is the Galápagos Islands.
The Phanatic&#x27;s favorite umpire was the late Eric Gregg, a Philadelphia native, and he would greet him enthusiastically on the field when Gregg was in charge. Gregg would often play along with the Phanatic between innings, sometimes dancing with him or otherwise participating in his routines.

One week before the Phillies had their 2006 opener, the Phanatic was &quot;dyed&quot; red as part of the team&#x27;s week-long promotion to &quot;Paint the Town Red&quot;. He was &quot;dipped into a special paint&quot; made by a team sponsor MAB Paints (now Sherwin-Williams) and changed from green to red. He returned to his regular color in time for the season opener for that year. This was repeated for the 2007 season, as he became red at a Philadelphia Fire Department station to help raise funds for smoke alarms in Philadelphia, raising over $4,000. &quot;Paint the Town Red Week&quot; has been repeated prior to the 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 seasons.

There is a running gag where the Phanatic humorously mocks opposition players and they would steal his ATV keys in retaliation. However, the Phanatic&#x27;s antics are not always popular with opposition players and coaches. During a September 1982 game, Cardinals outfielder (and former Phillies player) Lonnie Smith did not take kindly to the Phanatic&#x27;s taunts and tackled the mascot mid game out of frustration. Dodgers&#x27; manager Tommy Lasorda in particular did not like the Phanatic&#x27;s mocking of the Dodgers. In 1988, he assaulted the Phillie Phanatic during a nationally televised game after the Phanatic stomped on a life-sized dummy wearing Lasorda&#x27;s uniform (reportedly provided by Dodger infielder Steve Sax).

The Phanatic also has the dubious distinction of being the most sued mascot in sports. In 2010, a woman filed suit claiming that the Phanatic injured her knee at a minor league game.

==In popular culture==
In the 1970s, the &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; had a daily comic strip showing the adventures of the Phanatic.

The Phanatic appeared on the television series &quot;Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; in the episode &quot;Phind that Phanatic&quot; where The Phanatic is kidnapped by Top Grunge.

The Phanatic appeared on the episode of the television series &quot;Jon and Kate Plus 8&quot; titled &quot;Baseball Game with Daddy&quot;, where Jon took Cara and all three boys to a Phillies game.

The Phanatic&#x27;s head disappeared during the Phillies&#x27; &quot;Final Pieces&quot; charity sale and auction in 2004. Tom Burgoyne had taken off the costume for a break and found the head missing when he returned. One week later, someone anonymously called a local radio station claiming that he found the head and would bring it to the radio station. Police arrested and charged Bernard Bechtel with felony theft after he brought the $3,000 head to the station.

The Phanatic appeared in the closing credits of the film &quot;Rocky Balboa&quot; (2006).

In March 2009, the Phanatic appeared on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in the episode &quot;Gone Maggie Gone&quot;, greeting a party of nuns disembarking from a ship at the future site of Philadelphia. In the episode &quot;Dancin&#x27; Homer&quot;, there is a mascot that looks similar to the Phanatic, the Capital City Goofball.

In November 2009, the Phanatic was part of a bit on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; called &quot;Get to Know the Phillie Phanatic&quot;.

In 2010, the Phanatic appeared in the &quot;This is SportsCenter&quot; series of advertisements with Derek Jeter of the New York Yankees, where Jeter asks others in the ESPN locker room who used his razor, with the Phanatic&#x27;s signature green hair sticking out from the blades.

The Phanatic was mimicked in an episode of &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot; called &quot;The World Series Defense&quot;. In the episode, Charlie&#x27;s &quot;Green Man&quot; challenges that the &quot;Phrenetic&quot; (as it is referred to in the episode) should not be the only mascot for the Phillies. He is promptly put in his place by the &quot;Phrenetic&quot;. In an interview with Angelo Cataldi, Tom Burgoyne revealed that Major League Baseball declined to allow the Phanatic to be used in the episode. Charlie references this at the conclusion of the episode, attempting to file a countersuit against Major League Baseball due to the fact that he has to call the mascot the &quot;Phrenetic&quot; when he knows its name is the &quot;Phanatic&quot;.

On January 26, 2012, the Phanatic (credited to Tom Burgoyne) appeared as itself on an episode of the NBC sitcom &quot;30 Rock&quot; called &quot;The Ballad of Kenneth Parcell&quot;.

He and Mr. Met did a MasterCard commercial in 2013 to raise money for ending cancer.

In 2015, the podcast &quot;99% Invisible&quot; did an episode about the evolution of mascots focusing on the creation of the Phanatic.

The Phanatic was also on an episode of the show &quot;The Goldbergs&quot; in 2015 called &quot;The Lost Boy&quot;, and made a cameo appearance on &quot;College GameDay&quot; when the ESPN show visited Philadelphia for a matchup between Temple and Notre Dame. It reappeared in a 2018 episode of &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;.

The Phanatic appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Schooled&quot; episode &quot;Rocks for Jocks&quot;. 

On June 1, 2022, the Phanatic was the subject of a &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; clue during an episode in which two of the three contestants, Ryan Long and Vanessa Williams, were from Philadelphia. In 2019, Alex Trebek told a contestant that he was &quot;not a big fan&quot; of the Phanatic.

==Honors==
The Phanatic was voted &quot;best mascot ever&quot; by &quot;Sports Illustrated Kids&quot;. In January 2008, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine named the Phanatic the best mascot in sports.

In 2005, David Raymond founded the Mascot Hall of Fame, and the Phanatic was inducted as a charter member. Since 2003, Burgoyne has written several children&#x27;s books, published by the team, featuring the Phanatic.

In 2009, the Phanatic was one of several recipients of the Great Friend to Kids (GFTK) Awards, given by the Please Touch Museum (the Children&#x27;s Museum of Philadelphia).

The Phillie Phanatic, along with Youppi! also designed by Erickson, the mascot of the Montreal Expos, and the San Diego Chicken, are the only mascots on display in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York.

In 2010, an assortment of tall, fiberglass statues were painted by artists and placed on display throughout Philadelphia from April through August with all proceeds going to Phillies&#x27; Charities.

In 2015, &quot;Good Morning America&quot; bestowed the honor of the best mascot in baseball on the Phanatic.

==Relation to other mascots==
In 1989, Orlando&#x27;s NBA expansion team, the Magic, was founded largely through the efforts of former Philadelphia 76ers General Manager Pat Williams. Williams introduced Stuff, another Bonnie Erickson design, a furry green dragon with similarities to the Phillie Phanatic, as the team&#x27;s official mascot. When Williams staged the &quot;birth&quot; of Stuff at an Orlando event, the man inside Stuff was Dave Raymond.

The Hiroshima Toyo Carp mascot slyly bears a resemblance to the Phanatic. Both characters were designed by Harrison/Erickson.

On September 24, 2018, the Philadelphia Flyers introduced their new mascot, Gritty, at the Please Touch Museum. On September 28, 2018, Gritty hung out with the Phillie Phanatic at Citizens Bank Park. Since then, the two have been featured on tee shirts, including the one Bryce Harper wore when he arrived at Citizens Bank Park.

<text>Flores Island is a small island (approximately 155 km2) in Clayoquot Sound, off the west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada.

The area of Marktosis (population around 900) is the island&#x27;s only major settlement. Most residents are members of the Ahousaht nation (population around 2000) and form the largest part of the Nuu-chah-nulth or Nootka First Nation. Some of the indigenous language is spoken, though English is predominant.

Residing within the Clayoquot Sound Biosphere Reserve, Flores contains one of the largest tracts of contiguous old-growth forest on Vancouver Island. 41 km2 of the island has been demarcated as the Flores Island Marine Provincial Park. At 1.43 km2 in area is Gibson Marine Provincial Park. There are hot springs at the southern banks of the Matilda Inlet. The Marktosis reservation is 1.2 km2 ; the rest of the island is Crown land.

The island was named in 1791 by Francisco de Eliza, in honor of Manuel Antonio Flórez, 51st viceroy of New Spain.

Fishing is the island&#x27;s main industry. Tourism is promoted through the &#x27;Walk the Wild Side&#x27; hiking trail and accommodations at the Aauuknuck Lodge. Cow Bay on the island&#x27;s west side has been voted one of Canada&#x27;s top ten beaches.

The island can be reached by water taxi or seaplane from Tofino.

<text>Iona Brown, OBE, (7 January 19415 June 2004) was a British violinist and conductor.

==Early life and education==
Elizabeth Iona Brown was born in Salisbury and was educated at Cranborne Chase School, Dorset. Her parents, Antony and Fiona, were both musicians. Her brother Timothy has been principal horn of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, her other brother Ian is a pianist and her sister Sally plays viola in the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra.

==Career==
From 1963 to 1966, Brown played violin in the Philharmonia Orchestra. In 1964, she joined the Academy of St Martin in the Fields, working her way up through the ranks to become leader, solo violinist and director in 1974. She formally left the Academy in 1980, but continued to work with them for the rest of her life.

In 1981, she was appointed artistic director of the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra. King Olav V of Norway later awarded her the accolade Knight of First Class Order of Merit for her success with the NCO. She directed the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra from 1987 to 1992. She was dismissed as conductor because of an inability to commit to more than six weeks per season with the orchestra due to her other posts, a decision she protested. Brown ultimately returned as the orchestra&#x27;s principal conductor from 1995 to 1997 following a change in the orchestra&#x27;s leadership. From 1985 to 1989, she was guest director of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. As her health declined and her arthritis progressed, she shifted her focus from the violin to conducting, ending her violin career in 1998. In her last years, she was chief conductor of the South Jutland Symphony Orchestra of Denmark.

From 1968 to 2004, Brown&#x27;s principal residence was in the Wiltshire village of Bowerchalke. When she took part in the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;, explaining how hard it was to play her signature piece &quot;The Lark Ascending&quot; by Ralph Vaughan Williams, she said that the singing of larks she heard during long walks on nearby Marleycombe Down influenced the way she played it.

==Honours==
She was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1986, and in June 2003 was made an honorary Doctor of the University by the Open University.

==Death==
She died of cancer in 2004 at age 63 in Salisbury. She was married twice, and was survived by her second husband, Bjorn Arnils.

<doc id="723483" wikidata="Q1376168" url="?curid=723483" title="Memoization">
<text>In computing, memoization or memoisation is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls to pure functions and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. Memoization has also been used in other contexts (and for purposes other than speed gains), such as in simple mutually recursive descent parsing. It is a type of caching, distinct from other forms of caching such as buffering and page replacement. In the context of some logic programming languages, memoization is also known as tabling.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;memoization&quot; was coined by Donald Michie in 1968 and is derived from the Latin word (&#x27;to be remembered&#x27;), usually truncated as &quot;memo&quot; in American English, and thus carries the meaning of &#x27;turning [the results of] a function into something to be remembered&#x27;. While &quot;memoization&quot; might be confused with &quot;memorization&quot; (because they are etymological cognates), &quot;memoization&quot; has a specialized meaning in computing.

==Overview==

A memoized function &quot;remembers&quot; the results corresponding to some set of specific inputs. Subsequent calls with remembered inputs return the remembered result rather than recalculating it, thus eliminating the primary cost of a call with given parameters from all but the first call made to the function with those parameters. The set of remembered associations may be a fixed-size set controlled by a replacement algorithm or a fixed set, depending on the nature of the function and its use. A function can only be memoized if it is referentially transparent; that is, only if calling the function has exactly the same effect as replacing that function call with its return value. (Special case exceptions to this restriction exist, however.) While related to lookup tables, since memoization often uses such tables in its implementation, memoization populates its cache of results transparently on the fly, as needed, rather than in advance.

Memoized functions are optimized for &quot;speed&quot; in exchange for a higher use of computer memory &quot;space&quot;. The time/space &quot;cost&quot; of algorithms has a specific name in computing: &quot;computational complexity&quot;. All functions have a computational complexity in &quot;time&quot; (i.e. they take time to execute) and in &quot;space&quot;.

Although a space–time tradeoff occurs (i.e., space used is speed gained), this differs from some other optimizations that involve time-space trade-off, such as strength reduction, in that memoization is a run-time rather than compile-time optimization. Moreover, strength reduction potentially replaces a costly operation such as multiplication with a less costly operation such as addition, and the results in savings can be highly machine-dependent (non-portable across machines), whereas memoization is a more machine-independent, cross-platform strategy.

Consider the following pseudocode function to calculate the factorial of &quot;n&quot;:

 function factorial (&quot;n&quot; is a non-negative integer)
 if &quot;n&quot; is 0 then
 return 1 [&quot;by the convention that&quot; 0! = 1]
 else
 return factorial(&quot;n&quot; – 1) times &quot;n&quot; [&quot;recursively invoke factorial&quot; 
 &quot;with the parameter 1 less than n&quot;]
 end if
 end function

For every integer &quot;n&quot; such that codice_1, the final result of the function codice_2 is invariant; if invoked as codice_3, the result is such that &quot;x&quot; will &quot;always&quot; be assigned the value 6. The non-memoized implementation above, given the nature of the recursive algorithm involved, would require &quot;n + 1&quot; invocations of codice_2 to arrive at a result, and each of these invocations, in turn, has an associated cost in the time it takes the function to return the value computed. Depending on the machine, this cost might be the sum of:

# The cost to set up the functional call stack frame.
# The cost to compare &quot;n&quot; to 0.
# The cost to subtract 1 from &quot;n&quot;.
# The cost to set up the recursive call stack frame. (As above.)
# The cost to multiply the result of the recursive call to codice_2 by &quot;n&quot;.
# The cost to store the return result so that it may be used by the calling context.

In a non-memoized implementation, &quot;every&quot; top-level call to codice_2 includes the cumulative cost of steps 2 through 6 proportional to the initial value of &quot;n&quot;.

A memoized version of the codice_2 function follows:

 function factorial (&quot;n&quot; is a non-negative integer)
 if &quot;n&quot; is 0 then
 return 1 [&quot;by the convention that&quot; 0! = 1]
 else if &quot;n&quot; is in &quot;lookup-table&quot; then
 return &quot;lookup-table-value-for-n&quot;
 else
 let x = factorial(n – 1) times &quot;n&quot; [&quot;recursively invoke factorial&quot;
 &quot;with the parameter 1 less than n&quot;]
 store &quot;x&quot; in &quot;lookup-table&quot; in the &quot;n&quot;th slot [&quot;remember the result of n! for later&quot;]
 return x
 end if
 end function

In this particular example, if codice_2 is first invoked with 5, and then invoked later with any value less than or equal to five, those return values will also have been memoized, since codice_2 will have been called recursively with the values 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0, and the return values for &quot;each&quot; of those will have been stored. If it is then called with a number greater than 5, such as 7, only 2 recursive calls will be made (7 and 6), and the value for 5! will have been stored from the previous call. In this way, memoization allows a function to become more time-efficient the more often it is called, thus resulting in eventual overall speed-up.

==Other considerations==
===Functional programming===
Memoization is heavily used in compilers for functional programming languages, which often use call by name evaluation strategy. To avoid overhead with calculating argument values, compilers for these languages heavily use auxiliary functions called thunks to compute the argument values, and memoize these functions to avoid repeated calculations.

===Automatic memoization===

While memoization may be added to functions &quot;internally&quot; and &quot;explicitly&quot; by a computer programmer in much the same way the above memoized version of codice_2 is implemented, referentially transparent functions may also be automatically memoized &quot;externally&quot;. The techniques employed by Peter Norvig have application not only in Common Lisp (the language in which his paper demonstrated automatic memoization), but also in various other programming languages. Applications of automatic memoization have also been formally explored in the study of term rewriting and artificial intelligence.

In programming languages where functions are first-class objects (such as Lua, Python, or Perl), automatic memoization can be implemented by replacing (at run-time) a function with its calculated value once a value has been calculated for a given set of parameters. The function that does this value-for-function-object replacement can generically wrap any referentially transparent function. Consider the following pseudocode (where it is assumed that functions are first-class values):

 function memoized-call (&quot;F&quot; is a function object parameter)
 if &quot;F&quot; has no attached array &quot;values&quot; then
 allocate an associative array called &quot;values&quot;;
 attach &quot;values&quot; to &quot;F&quot;;
 end if;
 if &quot;F&quot;.&quot;values[arguments]&quot; is empty then
 &quot;F&quot;.&quot;values[arguments]&quot; = &quot;F&quot;(arguments);
 end if;
 return F.&quot;values[arguments]&quot;;
 end function

In order to call an automatically memoized version of codice_2 using the above strategy, rather than calling codice_2 directly, code invokes codice_13. Each such call first checks to see if a holder array has been allocated to store results, and if not, attaches that array. If no entry exists at the position codice_14 (where codice_15 are used as the key of the associative array), a &quot;real&quot; call is made to codice_2 with the supplied arguments. Finally, the entry in the array at the key position is returned to the caller.

The above strategy requires &quot;explicit&quot; wrapping at each call to a function that is to be memoized. In those languages that allow closures, memoization can be effected &quot;implicitly&quot; via a functor factory that returns a wrapped memoized function object in a decorator pattern. In pseudocode, this can be expressed as follows:

 function construct-memoized-functor (&quot;F&quot; is a function object parameter)
 allocate a function object called &quot;memoized-version&quot;;
 let memoized-version(arguments) be
 if &quot;self&quot; has no attached array values then [&quot;self is a reference to this object&quot;]
 allocate an associative array called &quot;values&quot;;
 attach &quot;values&quot; to &quot;self&quot;;
 end if;
 if self.&quot;values[arguments]&quot; is empty then
 self.&quot;values[arguments]&quot; = &quot;F&quot;(arguments);
 end if;
 return self.&quot;values[arguments]&quot;;
 end let;
 return &quot;memoized-version&quot;;
 end function

Rather than call codice_2, a new function object codice_18 is created as follows:

 memfact = construct-memoized-functor(factorial)

The above example assumes that the function codice_2 has already been defined &quot;before&quot; the call to codice_20 is made. From this point forward, codice_21 is called whenever the factorial of &quot;n&quot; is desired. In languages such as Lua, more sophisticated techniques exist which allow a function to be replaced by a new function with the same name, which would permit:

 factorial = construct-memoized-functor(factorial)

Essentially, such techniques involve attaching the &quot;original function object&quot; to the created functor and forwarding calls to the original function being memoized via an alias when a call to the actual function is required (to avoid endless recursion), as illustrated below:

 function construct-memoized-functor (&quot;F&quot; is a function object parameter)
 allocate a function object called &quot;memoized-version&quot;;
 let &quot;memoized-version&quot;(arguments) be
 if &quot;self&quot; has no attached array values then [&quot;self is a reference to this object&quot;]
 allocate an associative array called &quot;values&quot;;
 attach &quot;values&quot; to &quot;self&quot;;
 allocate a new function object called &quot;alias&quot;;
 attach &quot;alias&quot; to &quot;self&quot;; [&quot;for later ability to invoke F indirectly&quot;]
 self.&quot;alias&quot; = &quot;F&quot;;
 end if;
 if self.&quot;values[arguments]&quot; is empty then
 self.&quot;values[arguments]&quot; = self.&quot;alias&quot;(arguments); [not a direct call to F]
 end if;
 return self.&quot;values[arguments]&quot;;
 end let;
 return &quot;memoized-version&quot;;
 end function

(Note: Some of the steps shown above may be implicitly managed by the implementation language and are provided for illustration.)

===Parsers===
When a top-down parser tries to parse an ambiguous input with respect to an ambiguous context-free grammar (CFG), it may need an exponential number of steps (with respect to the length of the input) to try all alternatives of the CFG in order to produce all possible parse trees. This eventually would require exponential memory space. Memoization was explored as a parsing strategy in 1991 by Peter Norvig, who demonstrated that an algorithm similar to the use of dynamic programming and state-sets in Earley&#x27;s algorithm (1970), and tables in the CYK algorithm of Cocke, Younger and Kasami, could be generated by introducing automatic memoization to a simple backtracking recursive descent parser to solve the problem of exponential time complexity. The basic idea in Norvig&#x27;s approach is that when a parser is applied to the input, the result is stored in a memotable for subsequent reuse if the same parser is ever reapplied to the same input.

Richard Frost and Barbara Szydlowski also used memoization to reduce the exponential time complexity of parser combinators, describing the result as a memoizing purely functional top-down backtracking language processor. Frost showed that basic memoized parser combinators can be used as building blocks to construct complex parsers as executable specifications of CFGs. 

Memoization was again explored in the context of parsing in 1995 by Mark Johnson and Jochen Dörre. In 2002, it was examined in considerable depth by Bryan Ford in the form called packrat parsing.

In 2007, Frost, Hafiz and Callaghan described a top-down parsing algorithm that uses memoization for refraining redundant computations to accommodate any form of ambiguous CFG in polynomial time (Θ(n4) for left-recursive grammars and Θ(n3) for non left-recursive grammars). Their top-down parsing algorithm also requires polynomial space for potentially exponential ambiguous parse trees by &#x27;compact representation&#x27; and &#x27;local ambiguities grouping&#x27;. Their compact representation is comparable with Tomita&#x27;s compact representation of bottom-up parsing. Their use of memoization is not only limited to retrieving the previously computed results when a parser is applied to a same input position repeatedly (which is essential for polynomial time requirement); it is specialized to perform the following additional tasks:
* The memoization process (which could be viewed as a ‘wrapper’ around any parser execution) accommodates an ever-growing direct left-recursive parse by imposing depth restrictions with respect to input length and current input position.
* The algorithm&#x27;s memo-table ‘lookup’ procedure also determines the reusability of a saved result by comparing the saved result&#x27;s computational context with the parser&#x27;s current context. This contextual comparison is the key to accommodate indirect (or hidden) left-recursion.
* When performing a successful lookup in a memotable, instead of returning the complete result-set, the process only returns the references of the actual result and eventually speeds up the overall computation.
* During updating the memotable, the memoization process groups the (potentially exponential) ambiguous results and ensures the polynomial space requirement.

Frost, Hafiz and Callaghan also described the implementation of the algorithm in PADL’08 as a set of higher-order functions (called parser combinators) in Haskell, which enables the construction of directly executable specifications of CFGs as language processors. The importance of their polynomial algorithm&#x27;s power to accommodate ‘any form of ambiguous CFG’ with top-down parsing is vital with respect to the syntax and semantics analysis during natural language processing. The X-SAIGA site has more about the algorithm and implementation details.

While Norvig increased the &quot;power&quot; of the parser through memoization, the augmented parser was still as time complex as Earley&#x27;s algorithm, which demonstrates a case of the use of memoization for something other than speed optimization. Johnson and Dörre demonstrate another such non-speed related application of memoization: the use of memoization to delay linguistic constraint resolution to a point in a parse where sufficient information has been accumulated to resolve those constraints. By contrast, in the speed optimization application of memoization, Ford demonstrated that memoization could guarantee that parsing expression grammars could parse in linear time even those languages that resulted in worst-case backtracking behavior.

Consider the following grammar:

 S → (A c) | (B d)
 A → X (a|b)
 B → X b
 X → x [X]

(Notation note: In the above example, the production S → (A c) | (B d) reads: &quot;An &quot;S&quot; is either an &quot;A&quot; followed by a c or a &quot;B&quot; followed by a d.&quot; The production X → x [X] reads &quot;An &quot;X&quot; is an x followed by an optional &quot;X&quot;.&quot;)

This grammar generates one of the following three variations of string: &quot;xac&quot;, &quot;xbc&quot;, or &quot;xbd&quot; (where &quot;x&quot; here is understood to mean &quot;one or more &quot;x&quot;&#x27;s&quot;.) Next, consider how this grammar, used as a parse specification, might effect a top-down, left-right parse of the string &quot;xxxxxbd&quot;:

:The rule &quot;A&quot; will recognize &quot;xxxxxb&quot; (by first descending into &quot;X&quot; to recognize one &quot;x&quot;, and again descending into &quot;X&quot; until all the &quot;x&quot;&#x27;s are consumed, and then recognizing the &quot;b&quot;), and then return to &quot;S&quot;, and fail to recognize a &quot;c&quot;. The next clause of &quot;S&quot; will then descend into B, which in turn again descends into &quot;X&quot; and recognizes the &quot;x&quot;&#x27;s by means of many recursive calls to &quot;X&quot;, and then a &quot;b&quot;, and returns to &quot;S&quot; and finally recognizes a &quot;d&quot;.

The key concept here is inherent in the phrase again descends into &quot;X&quot;. The process of looking forward, failing, backing up, and then retrying the next alternative is known in parsing as backtracking, and it is primarily backtracking that presents opportunities for memoization in parsing. Consider a function codice_22, where the parameters are as follows:

* codice_23 is the name of the rule under consideration.
* codice_24 is the offset currently under consideration in the input.
* codice_25 is the input under consideration.

Let the return value of the function codice_26 be the length of the input accepted by codice_23, or 0 if that rule does not accept any input at that offset in the string. In a backtracking scenario with such memoization, the parsing process is as follows:

: When the rule &quot;A&quot; descends into &quot;X&quot; at offset 0, it memoizes the length 5 against that position and the rule &quot;X&quot;. After having failed at &quot;d&quot;, &quot;B&quot; then, rather than descending again into &quot;X&quot;, queries the position 0 against rule &quot;X&quot; in the memoization engine, and is returned a length of 5, thus saving having to actually descend again into &quot;X&quot;, and carries on &quot;as if&quot; it had descended into &quot;X&quot; as many times as before.

In the above example, one or &quot;many&quot; descents into &quot;X&quot; may occur, allowing for strings such as &quot;xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxbd&quot;. In fact, there may be &quot;any number&quot; of &quot;x&quot;&#x27;s before the &quot;b&quot;. While the call to S must recursively descend into X as many times as there are &quot;x&quot;&#x27;s, &quot;B&quot; will never have to descend into X at all, since the return value of codice_28 will be 16 (in this particular case).

Those parsers that make use of syntactic predicates are also able to memoize the results of predicate parses, as well, thereby reducing such constructions as:

 S → (A)? A
 A → /* some rule */

to one descent into &quot;A&quot;.

If a parser builds a parse tree during a parse, it must memoize not only the &quot;length&quot; of the input that matches at some offset against a given rule, but also must store the sub-tree that is generated by that rule at that offset in the input, since subsequent calls to the rule by the parser will not actually descend and rebuild that tree. For the same reason, memoized parser algorithms that generate calls to external code (sometimes called a semantic action routine) when a rule matches must use some scheme to ensure that such rules are invoked in a predictable order.

Since, for any given backtracking or syntactic predicate capable parser not every grammar will &quot;need&quot; backtracking or predicate checks, the overhead of storing each rule&#x27;s parse results against every offset in the input (and storing the parse tree if the parsing process does that implicitly) may actually &quot;slow down&quot; a parser. This effect can be mitigated by explicit selection of those rules the parser will memoize.

During the 1990s, Parker had supporting roles in a number of films. She has appeared in the 1995 horror anthology &quot;Tales from the Hood&quot;, Spike Lee&#x27;s Million Man March drama &quot;Get on the Bus&quot; (1996), the urban comedy &quot;Sprung&quot; (1997), the Jada Pinkett Smith starring romantic comedy &quot;Woo&quot; (1997), and the Frankie Lymon biography, &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; (1998). In the early 2000s, Parker co-starred in &quot;30 Years to Life&quot;, &quot;High Crimes&quot;, &quot;Phone Booth&quot;, and &quot;My Baby&#x27;s Daddy&quot;. In 2004, she played a role in the comedy-drama, &quot;She Hate Me&quot;, and appeared as Ruth Brown in biographical film &quot;Ray&quot;. Her breakthrough was in the 2005 independent drama &quot;Hustle &amp; Flow&quot; starring Terrence Howard. She later was cast opposite Howard in musical film &quot;Idlewild&quot; (2006).

From 2001 to 2005, Parker voiced the matriarch Trudy Proud in the Disney Channel animated comedy series, &quot;The Proud Family&quot; and its 2005 film &quot;The Proud Family Movie&quot;. She also played the iutstanding role of Billie Holiday on the episode of &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; in 2000, and later guest-starred on &quot;The Shield&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot;, and &quot;The Mentalist&quot;. She co-starred in the 2007 thriller film &quot;Cover&quot; starring Aunjanue Ellis, and in later years worked in low-profile independent movies.

From 2013 to 2014, Parker had a recurring role in the HBO series &quot;True Blood&quot; during the show&#x27;s seventh and final season. In 2014, she was cast as one of five leads on the TV One reality series, &quot;Hollywood Divas&quot;. In 2015, Parker was cast in the recurring roles on the Amazon drama &quot;Hand of God&quot;, as well as Freeform series, &quot;Recovery Road&quot;. In August 2016, she released an extended play album entitled &quot;Paula Jai &amp; Friends&quot;, which featured the single &quot;Going Down&quot;.

==Personal life==
Parker married Forrest Martin in 2004. The couple met on the set of &quot;Hustle &amp; Flow&quot;, where Forrest, who had just graduated with a Master of Fine Arts, was working as an intern. She almost passed on shooting the critically acclaimed movie and only took the part at the urging of her manager. They have one son.

<text>Miranda Taylor Cosgrove (born May 14, 1993) is an American actress and singer. A teen idol of the 2000s and early 2010s, she was listed as the highest-paid child actor of 2012 by Guinness World Records and appeared on &quot;Forbes&quot;&#x27; &quot;30 Under 30&quot; list in 2022. Her accolades include four Kids&#x27; Choice Awards and an Emmy nomination.

Cosgrove began her career at the age of seven, making several appearances in television commercials. She made her acting debut as Summer Hathaway in the film &quot;School of Rock&quot; (2003), and her breakthrough role was Megan Parker on the Nickelodeon sitcom &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot; (2004–2007). She rose to mainstream prominence for playing Carly Shay on the Nickelodeon sitcom &quot;iCarly&quot; (2007–2012), and Cosgrove was the executive producer for &quot;iCarly&quot;″s Paramount+ revival run (2021–2023). She also voices Margo in the &quot;Despicable Me&quot; film series (2010–present), appeared in the films &quot;The Intruders&quot; (2015), &quot;3022&quot; (2019), &quot;North Hollywood&quot; (2021), &quot;Drugstore June&quot; (2024), and &quot;Mother of the Bride&quot; (2024), and hosts the CBS series &quot;Mission Unstoppable with Miranda Cosgrove&quot; (2019–present).

Cosgrove made her musical debut in 2008 with the soundtrack for &quot;iCarly&quot;, in which she performed four songs, including the show&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Leave It All To Me&quot;. In 2009, she debuted her first extended play, &quot;About You Now&quot;. In April 2010, she released her debut studio album, &quot;Sparks Fly&quot;. The album featured the single &quot;Kissin U&quot; which peaked at number 54 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was certified gold. The following year, she released the extended play &quot;High Maintenance&quot; and embarked on the Dancing Crazy Tour.

==Early life==
Cosgrove was born on May 14, 1993 in Los Angeles to Tom Cosgrove, who owns a dry-cleaning business, and Chris (née Casey), a homemaker. She has said that she is of Irish, English, and French descent. She is an only child and was homeschooled from sixth grade onwards. She struggled with body image during childhood. Before becoming an actress, she wanted to be a veterinarian.

At the age of three, she was discovered by a talent agent while singing and dancing at the Los Angeles restaurant Taste of L.A. Cosgrove says that when the agent approached her and her mother, she had &quot;never really thought of being an actress&quot; and &quot;was lucky&quot;. She then appeared in numerous television commercials for McDonald&#x27;s and Mello Yello, and also modeled for various brands. At the age of seven, she began auditioning for theater and television roles.

== Career ==
=== 2000s ===
Cosgrove&#x27;s first television appearance was in 2001 when she provided the voice of young Lana Lang in the pilot episode of &quot;Smallville&quot;. She made her film debut in &quot;School of Rock&quot; (2003), directed by Richard Linklater. In the movie, she played Summer Hathaway, a young girl with great ambition and discipline who finds herself adjusting to the free-spirited nature of her new music teacher (Jack Black). On working with Black, Cosgrove said that &quot;He just acts [as] the most normal, nice guy. He doesn’t seem like he thinks he’s Jack Black at all.&quot; She also cited the scene in which her character tries to sing as particularly difficult: &quot;[I&#x27;d] been taking singing lessons for about five years, so getting to sing badly was new. The director kept saying, &#x27;Try to sing even worse, Miranda,&#x27; so it was weird.&quot; &quot;School of Rock&quot; was both a box office hit, grossing over $130 million worldwide, and a critical success. David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; described her performance as &quot;spot on&quot;.

In 2004, Cosgrove landed her first major role in a television series when she was cast in the Nickelodeon series &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot;, alongside Drake Bell and Josh Peck. In the series, she portrayed Megan Parker, the mischievous younger sister of the title characters. In 2005, Cosgrove was awarded the role of Munch in the Cartoon Network film &quot;Here Comes Peter Cottontail: The Movie&quot;. In the film, Cosgrove portrays a female mouse who is rescued from a hawk by Junior and Flutter and who goes on to join them on their adventure. Cosgrove also guest-starred on two episodes of the animated comedy, &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series&quot;. She won her second major role in a theatrical film when she cast alongside her &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot; co-star Drake Bell in the comedy film &quot;Yours, Mine &amp; Ours&quot;. The film performed mildly at the box office. &quot;Yours, Mine &amp; Ours&quot; opened in third place, earning $17 million at the U.S. box office during its first weekend. Cosgrove&#x27;s third theatrical release, &quot;Keeping Up with the Steins&quot;, was released in 2006. It received generally negative reviews from critics and performed poorly at the box office.

Cosgrove made guest appearances in a number of Nickelodeon series, the first of which was &quot;Zoey 101&quot;. Cosgrove later guest starred on an episode of &quot;Unfabulous&quot;, which starred Emma Roberts. Cosgrove was cast as the titular lead character in the sitcom &quot;iCarly&quot;, which premiered on September 8, 2007. Creator Dan Schneider tailored &quot;iCarly&quot; around the interest young people have in the internet; viewers could submit their own videos and be included in the sitcom. The final &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot; episode was aired on September 16, 2007. By the summer of 2008, &quot;iCarly&quot; was the third highest rated series in the 9–14 demographic. The &quot;iCarly Saves TV&quot; special became the most-viewed entertainment show on cable television in June 2008.

Her debut as a recording artist began with the &quot;iCarly&quot; theme song &quot;Leave It All to Me&quot;, which featured Drake Bell and was released as a single on December 2, 2007. In June 2008, Columbia Records released the &quot;iCarly&quot; soundtrack, which featured four songs performed by Cosgrove and debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Kid Albums chart. &quot;Stay My Baby&quot; was released as a promotional single from the album. In December 2008, a cover of the Christmas song &quot;Christmas Wrapping&quot; was released to promote the two hour-long film &quot;Merry Christmas, Drake &amp; Josh&quot;. On January 28, 2009, Cosgrove released &quot;About You Now&quot; as the lead single from her upcoming debut extended play of the same name, that was released on February 3, 2009. &quot;About You Now&quot; peaked at number 47 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. To promote the 2009 animated film &quot;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs&quot;, Columbia Records released the promotional single &quot;Raining Sunshine&quot; with an accompanying music video in August 2009. Cosgrove became one of MTV&#x27;s Female Pop Rookies of 2009. The same year, Cosgrove had a role in the straight-to-DVD film &quot;The Wild Stallion&quot; (2009).

=== 2010s ===

On March 17, 2010, it was reported that Cosgrove signed a deal, reportedly in the &quot;low- to mid-seven-figure range&quot; to do 26 additional episodes of &quot;iCarly&quot;. Cosgrove also voiced Margo in the Universal Studios animated feature &quot;Despicable Me&quot;, released in July 2010. In 2010, Cosgrove worked with songwriters The Matrix, Dr. Luke, Max Martin, Leah Haywood and Daniel James for her debut studio album, &quot;Sparks Fly&quot;. &quot;Kissin U&quot; was released as the sole single from &quot;Sparks Fly&quot; and premiered on Ryan Seacrest&#x27;s radio show on March 12, 2010. &quot;Kissin U&quot; became Cosgrove&#x27;s best-selling single release, peaking at number 54 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and being certified gold. &quot;Sparks Fly&quot; was released in April 2010 and peaked at number 8 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. In March 2011, Cosgrove released her follow-up EP &quot;High Maintenance&quot;. It was preceded by the single &quot;Dancing Crazy&quot;, which was written by Max Martin, Shellback and Avril Lavigne, and produced by Martin and Shellback. The single peaked on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 100.

On January 24, 2011, she embarked on the Dancing Crazy Tour. The tour began in Missouri, traveled throughout the United States, and ended in Ohio. On July 15, 2011, the tour continued with the title, Dancing Crazy Summer Tour; Cosgrove traveled the United States and Canada and performed at music festivals and state fairs. On May 17, 2012, it was announced that &quot;iCarly&quot;″s sixth season would be its last. The series finale, &quot;iGoodbye&quot;, aired on November 23, 2012. On January 24, 2012, Cosgrove was featured on the &quot;iCarly&quot; soundtrack, &quot;&quot;. Following the filming of &quot;iCarly&#x27;s&quot; finale in June 2012, Cosgrove embarked on a new tour dubbed the Summer Tour in July and August 2012.

On February 15, 2013, &quot;Deadline&quot; reported that Cosgrove would star in &quot;Girlfriend in a Coma&quot;, a television series written by Liz Brixius for NBC and adapted from the novel of the same title by Douglas Coupland. However, following production difficulties, the project was canceled. Cosgrove again voiced Margo in &quot;Despicable Me 2&quot;, released on June 5. In 2013, she appeared in the animated short films &quot;Training Wheels&quot; as Margo and &quot;Gru&#x27;s Girls&quot; as Savana. In December, she announced on &quot;The Today Show&quot; that she was recording a new album. In 2014, Cosgrove performed voice work in the animated film &quot;A Mouse Tale&quot;, which was released on February 10, 2015. Cosgrove also starred in the horror film &quot;The Intruders&quot; with Austin Butler, portraying the role of Rose Halshford. She was cast in the NBC sitcom &quot;Crowded&quot;, which aired from March 15 to May 22, 2016.

In 2017, Cosgrove reprised her role as Margo once again in &quot;Despicable Me 3&quot;, which was released on June 14, 2017. In 2019, she appeared in the limited budget Netflix science fiction film &quot;3022&quot;. Since 2019, she has been the host of &quot;Mission Unstoppable with Miranda Cosgrove&quot;, a show which airs on CBS and earned the actress a Daytime Emmy Award nomination in 2020.

=== 2020s ===
In 2021, Cosgrove played Rachel in the independent film &quot;North Hollywood&quot;. She reprised her role as Carly Shay in an &quot;iCarly&quot; revival, which premiered on Paramount+ in June 2021, and ran for three seasons until July 2023. She additionally served as an executive producer for the series, on which Cosgrove stated &quot;I knew from a really young age how the executive producer of the show pretty much got to decide almost every aspect, now I get to have a say in everything.&quot; The first season received a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. She won the award for Favorite Female TV Star at the 2022 Kids&#x27; Choice Awards, marking her second win from the association. Cosgrove told &quot;Yahoo! Lifestyle&quot; in 2022 that she has no plans to return to music.

Cosgrove had a starring role in the comedy film &quot;Drugstore June&quot;, which earned a limited theatrical release in February 2024. She next starred in the Netflix film &quot;Mother of the Bride&quot; opposite Brooke Shields, which was released in May 2024. Of her experience with the film, Cosgrove said that &quot;all the people in this movie were so nice, from the crew to all the actors. It couldn’t have come at a more perfect moment in my life.&quot; While &quot;Mother of the Bride&quot; received mixed reviews, Amy Amatangelo of &quot;Paste&quot; believed Cosgrove &quot;shines&quot; in the film&#x27;s emotional moments, and Courtney Howard of &quot;Variety&quot; called her performance &quot;nuanced&quot; and &quot;thoughtful&quot;. Cosgrove then reprised the role of Margo in &quot;Despicable Me 4&quot;, which was released in July 2024.

== Media image ==
Cosgrove is considered a teen idol of the 2000s and early 2010s, both for her Nickelodeon roles and her musical career. She found this challenging, telling &quot;People&quot; magazine that &quot;when you&#x27;re a little kid and someone&#x27;s calling you a role model, it&#x27;s like, &quot;Oh no, I don&#x27;t want to let anyone down,&quot; but you also aren&#x27;t fully formed and you don&#x27;t really know how to be a role model. So there are nice things about it but it&#x27;s also challenging.&quot; On how she is perceived in the media, Cosgrove told &quot;Bustle&quot; that &quot;there’s still a little part of me that’s like, &#x27;It’d be nice if people could see me in a different light.&#x27; I like my little bubble and my life, so I’m torn a lot because I’m like, how much should I put out there on social media? How much should I really want people to know about me? Maybe it’s nice that I just have one thing people think of me [for], and at least it’s a nice thing, and then I can live my life on the inside.&quot;

Cosgrove was chosen by Common Sense Media as the role model of 2011, being the youngest artist honored at the time. In the 2012 edition of the Guinness World Records, Cosgrove was listed as the highest paid child actress. Cosgrove was included on &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;30 Under 30&quot; list in 2022.

Cosgrove hosted the 2022 Kids&#x27; Choice Awards alongside Rob Gronkowski. She appeared on Whitney Cummings&#x27; &quot;Good for You&quot; podcast in 2020, and a clip of her cursing went viral on TikTok two years later in 2022.

==Personal life==
Cosgrove graduated from the University of Southern California with a degree in psychology. She does not drink or smoke.

Cosgrove is an active supporter of St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. She also visits other children&#x27;s hospitals and considers Education Through Music one of her favorite charities. She is a national spokesperson for Light the Night Walk, an organization that creates awareness for blood cancer.

In 2014, Cosgrove was granted a restraining order from a Los Angeles court against a stalker who had allegedly followed her, sent her unsolicited gifts and threatened suicide. The man was subsequently arrested for violating that order and sentenced to three years of probation.

In 2016, a man who had been stalking Cosgrove shot at a woman in a car near Cosgrove&#x27;s home before lighting himself on fire and shooting himself in Cosgrove&#x27;s yard. The man was found dead at the scene.

<text>Brian Richard Gaskill (born January 22, 1970, in Honolulu, Hawaii, raised in Neptune Township, New Jersey) is an American actor.

==Career==
While living in Neptune, he attended Red Bank Regional High School as a drama major in the school&#x27;s Academy of Visual and Performing Arts. He went on to receive his B.F.A. from the acting conservatory at State University of New York at Purchase.

His television debut was in the series &quot;Models Inc.&quot; in 1994. In 1995, he was cast as Bobby Warner in the soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;, on which he appeared until 1997.

In 2001 he appeared in the role as angel/vampire hunter Rafe Kovich on the &quot;General Hospital&quot; spinoff &quot;Port Charles&quot;. He continued with the role until the show was canceled in 2003.

After &quot;Port Charles&quot; was canceled, he appeared as Oscar Marone on &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; from 2003 to 2004.

From September 2005 to December 2005, Gaskill briefly joined the cast of &quot;As the World Turns&quot; as B.J. Green. Gaskill and his wife, Tonya Watts, welcomed their first child, Alabama Zoe, on September 26, 2005.

In March 2007, Gaskill joined the cast of &quot;Guiding Light&quot; as a recast of Dylan Lewis, the son of Reva Shayne and Billy Lewis and the estranged father of Daisy Lemay.

In 2010, Brian also been directed music videos; including one for Georgette Jones that included her legendary father George Jones, and one for Americana/Rock/Blues artist Anne McCue called &quot;don&#x27;t go to Texas (without me). The later video made it into the top ten in 2010 on Logo; an MTV subsidiary. 

In December 2023, it was announced he had joined the cast of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; in the role of Seth Morgan. On March 5, 2024, Gaskill announced on his social media accounts that his final episode was airing that day, with his character Seth having been killed.

<doc id="723493" wikidata="Q147181" url="?curid=723493" title="Rhinanthus minor">
<text>Rhinanthus minor, known as yellow rattle, is a herbaceous wildflower in the genus &quot;Rhinanthus&quot; in the family Orobanchaceae (the broomrapes). It has circumpolar distribution in Europe, Russia, western Asia, and northern North America. An annual plant, yellow rattle grows up to tall, with upright stems and opposite, simple leaves. The fruit is a dry capsule, with loose, rattling seeds.

The preferred habitat of &quot;Rhinanthus minor&quot; is dry fields or meadows; it tolerates a wide range of soil types. It flowers in the summer between May and September. It is hemiparasitic, notably on Poaceae (grasses) and Fabaceae (legumes), and farmers consider it to be a pest, as it reduces grass growth. 

Yellow rattle is used to create or restore wildflower meadows, where it maintains species diversity by suppressing dominant grasses and the recycling of soil nutrients. The seed is sown thinly onto grassland from August to November—to germinate the following spring, the seeds need to remain in the soil throughout the winter months.

==Description==

Yellow rattle is a herbaceous annual plant that resembles the larger greater yellow rattle (&quot;Rhinanthus angustifolius&quot;). The plant grows to up to tall, with opposite, simple leaves measuring  × . 

The leaves are sessile (they grow directly from the stem), somewhat heart-shaped at the base, otherwise ovate (oval-shaped) to lanceolate (shaped like a lance tip), dentate (toothed) and scabrid (a little rough to the touch). The stem, which stands upright, can be simple or branched, is four-angled and often streaked or spotted black.

The yellow flowers are across and have a straight tube for the petals. The silvery-coloured fruit is a dry capsule, which contains loose, rattling seeds when ripe that give the plant one of its common names.

The herbalist Nicholas Culpeper, in his &quot;The English Physician&quot; (first published in 1652), wrote of yellow rattle as being &quot;good for cough, or dimness of sight&quot;. The plant has a reputation of being toxic to animals. The seeds contain iridoids which cause them to have a bitter taste.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Rhinanthus minor&quot; is a flowering plant in the genus &quot;Rhinanthus&quot; in the family Orobanchaceae. It was described by the Swedish taxonomist Carl Linnaeus in volume 3 of &quot;Amoenitates Academici&quot; (1756). The species name is derived from Ancient Greek and means &#x27;nose flower&#x27;, which is in reference to the shape of the upper lip of the corolla. &quot;Minor&quot; means &#x27;smaller&#x27;.

Synonyms include:

* &quot;Alectorolophus minor&quot; 
* &quot;Fistularia minor&quot; 
* &quot;Rhinanthus crista-galli&quot; , the name Linnaeus gave the species
* &quot;Rhinanthus crista-galli&quot; var. &quot;fallax&quot; 
* &quot;Rhinanthus rigidus&quot; 
* &quot;Rhinanthus stenophyllus&quot; 
* &quot;Rhinanthus crista-galli&quot; var. &quot;fallax&quot; 
* &quot;Rhinanthus kyrollae&quot; 
* &quot;Rhinanthus borealis&quot; subsp. &quot;kyrollae&quot; 

==Distribution and ecology==

&quot;Rhinanthus minor&quot; is found in Europe, western Russia, western Siberia, northern USA and throughout Canada. The preferred habitat of &quot;Rhinanthus minor&quot; is dry fields or meadows, where its flowering period is in the summer between May and September, but it can thrive with semi-natural species-rich water-meadows. It can tolerate a wide range of soil types but does not grow where the soil has a pH less than 5.0. Yellow rattle flowers are pollinated by bumblebees during the summer months; the plant is also capable of self-fertilization. 

Yellow rattle is an annual wildflower. It is hemiparasitic, in that it can gain its nutrients by penetrating the roots of neighbouring green plants with its own roots, but is a facultative parasite, in that it acts opportunistically when in contact with a root. The hemiparasitic nature of yellow rattle can result in stunted, unbranched individual specimens. The plant can associate with many different host species, notably Poaceae (grasses) and Fabaceae (legumes).

In Ireland and Scotland, yellow rattle is often associated with Machair habitat, which consists of coastal grassland. The seeds are spread effectively by traditional hay-making practices. Farmers seek to remove it since it affects yields by weakening grass; it is an indicator of poor grassland.

===Effects on plant community structure===

Yellow rattle can change the structure of plant communities through its parasitism. Vulnerability to attack varies across host taxa, with forbs developing lignified barriers to obstruct the parasite.

Research, including that at the UK&#x27;s Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, has shown that encouraging it to grow in hay meadows greatly increases biodiversity, by restricting grass growth and thereby allowing other species to thrive. As of 2021 a majority of studies had found positive or neutral effects of the introduction of &quot;Rhinanthus&quot; spp. on grassland species richness and diversity, with most finding a negative effect on grasses.

===Conservation status===
&quot;Rhinanthus minor&quot; is found in low-lying fields with poor quality soil. It is currently not under threat; as such it is rated as of Least Concern (LC).

Being an annual, it is not found in regularly mown or grazed grassland where the seeds are not provided with an opportunity to spread over the ground. The lack of a seed bank for yellow rattle means that it depends on seed produced from plants during the previous year.

===Pasture and hay field infestation===
In the northeastern United States, yellow rattle is considered a pest, as it decreases crop yields of grass and hay. Where the plant is found to have infested farmland it has to be suppressed; non-herbicidal strategies for removing it include the application of wood ash and sawdust on affected pastures.

==Uses and cultivation==
Yellow rattle is used to proactively create or restore wildflower meadows. It is used to reduce the dominance of grasses, when more expensive methods, such as removing the nutrient-rich topsoil, or impractical methods, such as changing the timing and intensity of grazing, cannot be used. This improves the chances of other species of flowers becoming established. According to Natural England, the optimum density of yellow rattle plants needed to enable other species to be introduced is 100 to 200 per m2. Studies have shown that the plant&#x27;s role in maintaining species diversity is through differential growth suppression effects and enhanced soil nutrient recycling.

The yellow rattle seed is sown thinly onto grassland where gaps have been created, or where all the grass has been cut back and the clippings removed. Seeds can be also be introduced by the spreading of green hay. The grass should be kept short until the beginning of March, after which the seedlings become established.

After the yellow rattle plants have germinated and matured, the fruits shed their seeds. The meadow hay is cut and removed to encourage the growth introduced wild flowers. The seed, which is short-lived, is sown in the autumn, using seed harvested that year. The seeds have to remain on or under the ground throughout the cold months of winter in order to germinate in the spring.

<text>Megan &quot;Meg&quot; Griffin is a fictional character from the American animated television series &quot;Family Guy&quot;. She first appeared in the show&#x27;s pilot episode, &quot;Death Has a Shadow&quot;, on January 31, 1999. The character was originally voiced by Lacey Chabert; however, she has been voiced by Mila Kunis since the show&#x27;s second season. Writer Seth MacFarlane created and designed Meg after his 1995 student film, &quot;The Life of Larry&quot;, was picked up by 20th Century Fox for a series order. Meg is the eldest child and only daughter of Peter and Lois Griffin and the sister of Chris and Stewie. Meg is often depicted as an outcast who receives heavy ridicule from her family and peers.

== Personality ==
Meg is a self-conscious and insecure adolescent. She is treated unfairly and abused by various people and has numerous insecurities that prompt her to try to be part of the &quot;in-crowd&quot;. However, this only results in her getting rebuffed by the many bullies of this circle, particularly Connie D&#x27;Amico, the head cheerleader of the local high school, James Woods Regional High School. However, a nerdy Jewish student named Neil Goldman is attracted to her.

Meg is usually the butt of Peter&#x27;s jokes due to her unpopularity and &quot;ugliness&quot;; Peter resorts to outrageous stunts and names. Stewie and Brian tend to disdain her kindness, but they typically do it behind Meg&#x27;s back. Lois constantly puts Meg down, while boosting her own ego. Lois is usually of little to no help to Meg when she is abused by others; though her attitude is more negligent or apathetic than the more overt and direct abuse given by Peter.

While Meg is usually a pushover, she can get angry when pushed too far, though such occasions are usually rare. This can be seen in the episode &quot;Seahorse Seashell Party&quot;, where she strongly insults and defames Peter, Lois, and even Chris for their inconsiderate actions toward her. This causes Peter, Lois, and Chris to distance themselves in shame and sends Peter into depression; though she later apologizes upon realizing that the family needs a &quot;lightning rod&quot; to absorb the dysfunction. In the episode &quot;Road to Rupert&quot;, Meg assaults a man for insulting her after a fender-bender.

Despite her persistent mistreatment, Meg has proven a variety of times throughout the series that she is more talented and has greater potential than most people bother to realize, such as bird calls, playing the saxophone, speaking and singing in foreign languages, and even sports such as bowling, field hockey, basketball, roller derby, and even Olympic sports. However, she lacks far too much of the proper support or self-esteem to strive on these abilities, mostly due to her family&#x27;s lack of regard or interest in her or her inability to stick up against them.

Many of the show&#x27;s storylines about Meg involve her trying to improve her life, find a boyfriend, being a Russian sleeper agent, and reaching breaking points with her family and others who victimize her. She often becomes obsessed with men who show any kindness or affection to her, including the Griffin&#x27;s friend and neighbor Joe Swanson in the episode &quot;The Hand That Rocks the Wheelchair&quot;, and Brian in &quot;Barely Legal&quot;.

Out of all the members of the family, her father Peter abuses her the most, however he is shown to actually care about Meg in various episodes, such as in &quot;Meg and Quagmire&quot; when he goes out of his way to prevent friend and neighbor Glenn Quagmire from having sex with her, and in &quot;This Little Piggy&quot; where he tries to get Meg out of a foot fetishism business objectifying her for men&#x27;s sexual amusement. Peter occasionally cares about Meg but is not open about it to anyone.

== Voice actors ==
On the season 1 DVD commentary for the &quot;Drawn Together&quot; episode &quot;Hot Tub&quot;, Cree Summer claims she was offered the role to play Meg but was dismissed by the producers. Meg was voiced by an uncredited Lacey Chabert for the first season, and by Mila Kunis in subsequent seasons after Chabert became busy with school and her role on &quot;Party of Five&quot;, although some of her work became second season episodes due to production order. Mila Kunis won the role after a series of auditions and callbacks where she was asked to speak more slowly and enunciate more; she was ultimately hired despite being unsure she understood what was expected of her. MacFarlane felt that Kunis invigorated the character, and that her work on &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; showed she could command a scene. MacFarlane stated that Kunis &quot;had a very natural quality to Meg&quot; and she&#x27;s &quot;in a lot of ways [...] almost more right for the character&quot;. Kunis&#x27; voice is first heard as Meg in Episode 3 of season two &quot;Da Boom&quot;, and the voices switch back and forth in the broadcast order until settling on Kunis. Tara Strong provides Meg&#x27;s singing voice in &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Over&quot;. Archival recordings of Lacey Chabert&#x27;s voice that she provided as Meg Griffin are used in the tenth season episode &quot;Back to the Pilot&quot; in which Brian and Stewie go back in time to the events of &quot;Death Has a Shadow&quot;. However, Chabert does in fact return for the eleventh season episode &quot;Yug Ylimaf&quot; as Stewie references the fact that time has reversed so much that Meg&#x27;s voice has reverted back from that of Kunis&#x27; to Chabert&#x27;s.

== Social life ==
Meg is very unpopular in high school due to both her plain appearance and personality. She desperately tries to be part of the cool crowd, but is usually coldly rebuffed. Because of her eagerness for acceptance, she has been recruited &quot;unknowingly&quot; into a suicidal religious cult, and later recruited again unwittingly into her school&#x27;s Lesbian Alliance (in the episode &quot;Brian Sings and Swings&quot; ). However, Meg does have a moderate number of friends, the best of whom being a group of girls who are often seen with her during occasions such as her slumber parties and gossiping about boys. In later episodes, these girls, known by the names Beth, Patty, Collette, Esther, and Ruth, are characterized as being highly unpopular and dateless, much like Meg.

Meg is so unpopular at school that one student fires a nail gun into his own abdomen twice (in shop class) in order to avoid a date with her, and then in a later episode, another student shoots his own brother as an excuse not to go to a dance with her the following night. In &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Over&quot;, Lois is looking for new clothes for Meg, but with no luck; a saleswoman ends up pouring gasoline on herself, lighting a match, catching fire, and then jumping out of a window after looking at Meg in a pair of jeans. However, she is sought by nerd Neil Goldman. In &quot;8 Simple Rules for Buying My Teenage Daughter&quot;, Neil starts dating a girl named Cecilia, Meg becomes instantly jealous and pretends to date Jake Tucker to make him jealous. This leads to her signing a contract to become Neil&#x27;s girlfriend and (not knowing at first) his slave, but she gets him to tear up the contract after Lois seduces him. Perverted neighbor Glenn Quagmire has shown a repeated interest in her, mostly due to his very low standards, asking if she has reached the age of consent. Quagmire comes close to succeeding in &quot;Meg and Quagmire&quot; when Lois tells Peter to back off after he was ruining Meg and Quagmire&#x27;s &#x27;dates&#x27;. Then, they rescue Meg after Glenn takes her to his cabin, Peter and Lois arriving in time before anything happens. In several episodes she is shown dating, including stories with characters Mayor Adam West and nudist Jeff Campbell. She also loses her virginity unknowingly on live television to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; host Jimmy Fallon after having a drastic makeover; but, before all that happens, she goes out with a rebel at her school named Craig Hoffman. In &quot;Jerome is the New Black&quot;, Jerome, an old flame of Lois&#x27;s and Peter&#x27;s new friend, admits to having sex with Meg, to which Peter replies indifferently.

In the episode &quot;Brian Sings and Swings&quot;, a lesbian student named Sarah invites Meg to join in her Lesbian Alliance Club, with Meg not knowing at first what kind of club it was. Desperate to fit in, she pretends to be a lesbian and also pretends to be attracted to Sarah and even goes so far as to kiss her to prove it. At the end of the episode, Meg goes over to Sarah&#x27;s house to admit she lied about being a lesbian (Sarah thought that Meg came over to have sex and even undresses when Meg is telling her that she lied), much to Glenn&#x27;s (who was hiding in Sarah&#x27;s closet) disappointment. She also used to have a crush on anchorman Tom Tucker, but it ended after she discovered his vanity and selfishness. In other episodes, she is portrayed as chronically incapable of finding a boyfriend. For her Junior Prom she accepts a pity date from Brian, the family dog and only after threatening suicide.

Earlier in season 2, she dated Joe Swanson&#x27;s son Kevin Swanson, but in &quot;Stew-Roids&quot; it is mentioned that Kevin died in Iraq. In the episode, &quot;Prick Up Your Ears&quot;, she dates a boy named Doug, but he breaks up with her when he sees her naked right before almost having sex. In the episode &quot;Peter&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, Meg falls in love with a medical student named Michael Milano after coming out of a short coma (caused by Peter when he asked her to &quot;rescue&quot; beer and make him a sandwich out of an already flooded kitchen) and they start to date. After he breaks up with Meg (because of Peter being overprotective of her after promising that if she came out of the coma, he would &quot;treat her like a princess&quot;), she announces that she is pregnant by Michael and the two get engaged. After finding out that she is not actually pregnant, Meg tells Michael the truth hoping that he will stay, however, Michael quickly leaves Meg at the altar. In the episode &quot;Dial Meg for Murder&quot;, she is dating a convict, while in the episode &quot;Go, Stewie, Go!&quot; she dates an attractive young man named Anthony, who is absolutely normal (much to the surprise of many of the other characters). They were so shocked that they had to do tests just to see if he was completely normal which annoyed Meg. It is presumed that she broke up with him after he and Lois had an affair. Meg also shows extremely possessive behavior when she encounters someone she believes she has a romantic connection with such as kidnapping Brian and detaining Bonnie Swanson at the airport by planting a gun in her purse.

Overall, Meg has shown romantic interest in and dated several men throughout the series. However, there have been several instances in which she has shown hints of being bisexual or a lesbian: examples of this include &quot;Brian Sings and Swings&quot;, &quot;Stew-Roids&quot;, and &quot;Dial Meg for Murder&quot;.

In November 2016, when asked by Splitsider if the writers will further develop the characters of Chris and Meg in future episodes, showrunner Alec Sulkin confirmed that the series crew members are working on doing so and added that there are plans for an episode where Meg comes out as a lesbian, taking inspiration from previous instances in which she exhibited signs of lesbian characteristics, like when she joins a lesbian alliance group at school in &quot;Brian Sings and Swings&quot; and is identified as a &quot;transgender man&quot; named &quot;Ron&quot; in &quot;Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story&quot;, the latter which takes place in the future. However, Sulkin also noted that the plotline has not yet been finalized and thus isn&#x27;t officially set to be used in an episode.

== Family life ==
In the first three seasons of the show, Meg was portrayed with a more whiny and uptight personality who was often embarrassed by the family’s acts of bumbling and stupidity, though they cared for her and meant well. In the post-cancellation seasons, this began to change as the inadvertent embarrassment became deliberate bullying and disrespect. Additionally, the show started to flesh out the characters to the point where it appears that most of the population of Quahog who knows her, or even just meets her, picks on or disdains her for no reason other than her simply being &quot;Meg&quot;. This basically means that she is a victim of circumstance, as Meg is normally docile and well-behaved and never seems to do anything mean or inconsiderate. In an interview, Mila Kunis stated: &quot;Meg gets picked on a lot. But it&#x27;s funny. It&#x27;s like the middle child. She is constantly in the state of being an awkward 16-year-old, when you&#x27;re kind of going through puberty and what-not. She&#x27;s just in perpetual mode of humiliation, and it&#x27;s fun.&quot;

While Meg is, in reality, the least obnoxious or self-involved of the family, she is also the least respected and most misunderstood, often shown by people avoiding her company, disparaging her in person, gathering in her bedroom to read her diary for laughs, etc. Peter reminds Lois, &quot;We agreed that if we could only save two, we&#x27;d leave Meg!&quot; even randomly shooting her when she simply said &quot;Hi Dad&quot; (&quot;Peter&#x27;s Daughter&quot;) but despite this he also was going to say &quot;I love you&quot; in &quot;Hell Comes to Quahog&quot;, and in &quot;Road to Rupert&quot; he stated they were &#x27;secret best friends&#x27; before throwing lemonade in her face, saying he would have to continue to treat her badly in public in order to maintain his reputation due to &quot;peer pressure&quot;, thus giving hope that they may be on good terms. Occasionally, when Meg asks a question to Peter or just speaks when he is in the room, Peter responds by saying &quot;Shut up, Meg&quot;, which is immediately followed by a line from another character.

When the family tries an anger management technique of writing letters and not sending them, Meg finds Peter&#x27;s letter to her, which says, &quot;Dear Meg, for the first four years of your life, I thought you were a house cat.&quot; And in Peter&#x27;s short story of her birth, they had to go back to get her once they realized they grabbed the afterbirth. In the episode &quot;Stewie Kills Lois&quot;, Peter tells guests on a cruise ship about how he and Lois had gone to get an abortion but decided against it when they arrived at the clinic and found out the abortionist had one hand. He then says &quot;two and a half months later, our daughter Meg was born&quot; – indicating that they had tried to abort her when Lois was already over six months pregnant. Another hint to this is when Meg is in the car with Lois and at an attempt to make civilized conversation, says, &quot;Hey Meg, did you know that if you&#x27;re on birth control and you take an antibiotic it makes it not work? &#x27;Cause no one told me! I just thought you should know&quot; and laughs awkwardly. On Meg&#x27;s 17th birthday, her mother and father both try to hide from Meg that they do not remember her age. Peter states that Meg sucks in the episode &quot;PTV&quot;, and Chris says that people think the same thing about her in &quot;Long John Peter&quot;. In &quot;Not All Dogs Go to Heaven&quot;, Brian says to Meg&#x27;s face that she lives in a home &quot;where nobody respects or cares about [her], not even enough to get [her] a damn mumps shot!&quot; Chris, however, has more of a typical brother-sister relationship with Meg, with Chris telling those who condemn her that it is never her fault. Chris, at one point, threatened to quit his job at the local mini-mart if his boss didn&#x27;t re-hire Meg (at the insistence of Lois). Like Chris, Meg has an anthropomorphic monkey in her closet, and although she has proved it, her father coldly state that they were talking about Chris&#x27;, not hers. Cleveland comments to Peter &quot;Meg is my least favorite of your children.&quot;

Apparently, a double standard also exists against Meg, further underscoring the mistreatment she suffers from the people around her. In &quot;Big Man on Hippocampus&quot;, an episode wherein Peter loses his memory, as he reacquaints himself with the pleasures of sex, Lois tells him that it is inappropriate to have sex with his own children; in response, Meg attempts an incest joke. Lois then lambastes her for this and kicks her out of the room. However, in the season finale &quot;Partial Terms of Endearment&quot;, Lois tells a joke that implies that it was Meg that gave birth to Stewie, and apart from a shocked reaction from the latter, Lois receives no such violent reaction. Additionally, in &quot;Model Misbehavior&quot;, when Lois starts a modeling career, Peter states that he will pleasure himself to Lois&#x27; pictures, followed by Chris and Meg both exclaiming &quot;Me too!&quot; to which Peter shouts &quot;Oh God, Meg, that&#x27;s sick! That&#x27;s your mother!&quot;, ignoring the fact that Chris said the same thing first. Meg responded by saying &quot;I was only trying to fit in!&quot; Peter immediately kicks her out of the house. Later, during an unrelated conversation, when she tried to insight Peter on how Lois&#x27; behavior from modeling made a poor example for women, he said &quot;Meg, who let you back in the house?&quot;

Brian&#x27;s attention initially softens the lack of respect from Peter and the rest of family; he admits that he cares for Meg when she goes out with Mayor Adam West. While initially seeming to have more common decency for Meg than most people, this appears to almost completely disappear after the tenth season, as Brian&#x27;s increasingly shallow and self-centered character begins to take more pleasure and joy in being rotten to Meg and often refuses to give her the time of day, such as desperately trying to avoid having to comfort her, rejecting an offer by Peter to be Meg&#x27;s godfather, attempting to pin the blame on (or trying to frame) her for a misdeed, finding humor in her being puked on, and even willing to deliberately urinate on her bed. Meg&#x27;s most complicated relationship among the family members after Peter would be with her mother Lois. Although not as abusive as Peter, Lois seldom (if ever) reprimands her husband for their treatment of their daughter and tends to be rather thoughtless of Meg herself, often putting her down for her lack of social achievement or social popularity. Throughout the series, Lois can best be described as a general foil to her daughter, being more rebellious, outgoing, and loose-spirited compared to her daughter&#x27;s own uptight demeanor, easily-embarrassed personality, and lack of confidence. Before the more recent seasons of the series, Lois has also often shown sympathy for Meg and tried to boost her confidence in terms of teenage social matters. Occasionally however, such occasions resulted in the former getting carried away and stealing the show, for example, taking her to Spring Break at the beach, only for her former younger wild side to kick in and completely exclude Meg from the excitement. Lois would very often comfort Meg when she is down; however, she gives up one attempt after 45 minutes and gives her a Sylvia Plath novel and a bottle of Ambien, and with a &quot;Whatever happens, happens&quot;, leaves Meg to her misery.
One of the most cruel examples of the family&#x27;s lack of humanity or gratitude for Meg comes in the episode &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That On Television, Peter&quot;. When Peter is mauled by a puma, Meg uses medical training to save his life. However, no one thanks her afterward and when she tries to point it out, Peter just tells her to get him water.

While she is well aware of how poorly she is treated by others, Meg is usually much too fragile and passive to push back or retaliate against her family and school tormentors. The family&#x27;s treatment of Meg, however, finally reaches her limit in &quot;Dial Meg for Murder&quot; when Meg emerges from a short stint in a Young Offenders Institution as a hardened criminal, abusing her family and beating up anyone who makes fun of her. It is only after a conversation with Brian that she changes her ways. However, it comes to a head once again in &quot;Seahorse Seashell Party&quot;, when Meg finally grows tired of her mistreatment and lashes out against Lois and Peter, informing them of their own flaws. Lois condescendingly tells Meg that she is simply taking her own problems out on everyone else invoking Meg to bring up her mother&#x27;s delinquent past. Meg tells her that she is far from the perfect parent, harshly berates her for constantly and ruthlessly pointing out Meg&#x27;s shortcomings. Lois tries to justify that she&#x27;s a better person because of her past and she is open that she isn&#x27;t the perfect parent, but Meg tells her that she&#x27;s the farthest thing from and states how she has neglected to guide her through life and navigate her through the hardships and difficulties of being a young woman. Meg also informs Lois that when she turns 18, she may never want to see her again. This breaks Lois&#x27; heart and she finally admits that she&#x27;s been a terrible mother to Meg. Finally, Meg turns on Peter who, unable to comprehend her insults, thinks that his daughter&#x27;s argument is amusing, even when she points out Peter&#x27;s destructive tendencies and that he would go to jail if someone could witness his negative treatment towards her. It dawns on Peter that he is being insulted when Meg calls him a &quot;waste of a man.&quot; A disillusioned Peter asks Lois to tell Meg to &quot;knock it off&quot;, but Lois refuses because he didn&#x27;t stick up for her. Within moments, Peter turns his abusive criticisms and insults on Chris and Lois. Peter finally runs to his room crying, with Lois running after him, leaving behind Meg and Brian, who is now fully recovered from his trip, to discuss what just happened. Brian likes that Meg stood up for herself, but she sadly tells him that even though she meant every word, seeing Peter turn on everyone like wolves has made her think that it is ultimately her non-ideal role to serve as the Griffins&#x27; &quot;lightning rod that absorbs all the dysfunction&quot;. He commends her on her maturity, and even goes on to say that Meg is the &quot;strongest person&quot; in the family. She soon apologizes to the others and says that she is actually the one at fault.

Since this episode, the abuse that Meg receives begins to fade away as a storyline. She also notices that Peter&#x27;s pro wrestler sister Karen treats Peter exactly the way Peter treats her, and they bond over this with a plan to embarrass Karen at a wrestling show—which goes awry when Meg hits her with a metal folding chair instead of a breakaway one and injures Karen to the point where she ends up in a coma and (as it is implied) possibly will die from her injuries without a blood transfusion.

<text>The Gokstad ship is a 9th-century Viking ship found in a burial mound at Gokstad in Sandar, Sandefjord, Vestfold, Norway. It is displayed at the Viking Ship Museum in Oslo, Norway. It is the largest preserved Viking ship in Norway.

==Discovery==
The site where the boat was discovered, situated on arable land, had long been named &quot;Gokstadhaugen&quot; or &quot;Kongshaugen&quot; (from the Old Norse words &quot;konungr&quot; meaning king and &quot;&quot; meaning mound), although the relevance of its name had been discounted as folklore, as other sites in Norway bear similar names. In 1880, sons of the owner of Gokstad farm, having heard of the legends surrounding the site, uncovered the bow of a boat while digging in the still frozen ground. As word of the find got out, Nicolay Nicolaysen, then President of the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments, reached the site during February 1880. Having ascertained that the find was indeed that of an ancient artifact, he liaised for the digging to be stopped. Nicolaysen later returned and established that the mound still measured 50 metres by 43 metres, although its height had been diminished down to 5 metres by constant years of ploughing. With his team, he began excavating the mound from the side rather than from the top down, and on the second day of digging found the bow of the ship.

==Construction==

The Gokstad ship is clinker-built and constructed largely of oak. The ship was intended for warfare, trade, transportation of people and cargo. The ship is long and wide. It is the largest in the Viking Ship Museum in Oslo. The ship was steered by a quarter rudder fastened to a large block of wood attached to the outside of the hull and supported by an extra stout rib. The block is known as the wart, and is fastened by osiers, bent willow shoots on the outside passed through both the rudder and wart to be firmly anchored in the ship.

There are 16 tapered planks per side. The garboard planks are near vertical where they attach to the keel. The garboard planks are narrow and remain only slightly wider to take the turn of the bilge. The topside planks are progressively wider. Each oak plank is slightly tapered in cross section to allow it to overlap about 30mm the plank above and below in normal clinker (&quot;lapstrake&quot;) style. Iron rivets are about 180 mm apart where the planks lie straight and about 125 mm apart where the planks turn.

At the bow, all of the planks taper to butt the stem. The stem is carved from a single curved oak log to form the cutwater and has one land for each plank. The inside of the stem is hollowed into a v shape so the inside of the rivets can be reached during construction or repair. Each of the crossbeams has a ledge cut about 25 mm wide and deep to take a removable section of decking. Sea chests were placed on top of the decking to use when rowing. Most likely on longer voyages sea chests were secured below decks to act as ballast when sailing. The centre section of the keel has little rocker and together with flat midships transverse section the hull shape is suited to medium to flat water sailing. When sailing downwind in strong winds and waves, directional control would be poor, so it is likely that some reefing system was used to reduce sail area. In such conditions the ship would take water aboard at an alarming rate if sailed at high speed.

The method of fastening the planking to the frames above the waterline is by iron rivets in the form of iron nails driven from outside and then turned over a cinch plate on the inside. The lowest nine planks on each side of the keel up to the around the waterline are held to the frames by the archaic method of tying using withies. These nine bottom planks are also thinner than elsewhere being about 2.5 cm in thickness compared with a thickness of about 3 to 4 cm for the upper planks. The thinner bottom planks are formed with cleats projecting from their inner face to allow the planks and frames to be tied together using withies. The overall effect of this construction is to make the bottom of the ship lighter and more flexible. The 1893 &#x27;Viking&#x27; replica of the Gokstad ship reproduced this form of construction. The Viking&#x27;s captain, Magnus Andersen, reported that the lightness and flexibility allowed the bottom to rise and fall up to 18 mm in heavy seas without leaking and the gunwale could twist up to 15 cm out of line. Speeds of around 10 or 11 knots were recorded.

The ship was built to carry 32 oarsmen, and the oar holes could be hatched down when the ship was under sail. It utilized a square sail of approximately , which, it is estimated, could propel the ship to over . The mast could be raised and lowered. While the ship was traveling in shallow water, the rudder could be raised very quickly by undoing the fastening. Dendrochronological dating suggests that the ship was built of timber that was felled around 890 AD. This period is the height of Norse expansion in Dublin, Ireland and York, England. The Gokstad ship was commissioned at the end of the 9th century during the reign of King Harald Fairhair. The ship could carry a crew of between forty and seventy men. The ship&#x27;s design has been demonstrated to be very seaworthy.


== Human remains and grave goods ==
During the excavations, a human skeleton was found in a bed inside a timber-built burial chamber. The skeleton was that of a man aged approximately forty to fifty years old, of powerful build and between 181 and 183 cm (5’11&quot; to 6&#x27;) tall; his identity is unknown. The bones of twelve horses, six dogs, and one peacock were found laid out around the man&#x27;s body. In the 1920s Professor Anton Willem Brogger of the University of Oslo asserted that the man was King Olaf Gudrodson, gout-ridden son of the elderly king Gudrod of Vestfold. But this has not been sufficiently proven.

The grave was furnished with grave goods in addition to the ship itself: three small boats, a tent, a sledge, and riding equipment. Other grave goods were probably plundered in ancient times: the excavation in 1880 found no gold or silver. In the Viking period, weapons were considered an important part of a man&#x27;s grave goods, but again, none were found in the Gokstad ship. 
==Public exhibition==
The ship, the reconstructed burial chamber, two of the small boats and two tent boards from the burial chamber are displayed in the Viking Ship Museum located on Bygdøy peninsula in Oslo, Norway. Some other artifacts that survived the plundering are also on display in the museum. After thirteen years of debate regarding a possible relocation, Education Minister Kristin Halvorsen stated on May 3, 2012, that the ship would not be moved from Bygdøy.

==Replicas==

&quot;Viking&quot;, an exact replica of the Gokstad ship, crossed the Atlantic Ocean from Bergen, Norway to be exhibited at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893; it remains on exhibit near Chicago.

The Gaia ship is an exact replica of the Gokstad ship. &quot;Gaia&quot; was constructed during the winter of 1989–1990 in Bjørkedal in Volda. On May 17, 1991, it was sailed by Ragnar Thorseth to North America to mark the 1000th anniversary of Leiv Eriksson’s founding of Vinland. It was named &quot;Gaia&quot; on June 19, 1991, by Vigdis Finnbogadottir, the President of Iceland, during this voyage. In May 1993, the vessel was donated to the city of Sandefjord by Knut Utstein Kloster of the Gaia Ship Foundation and this remains its home port. The ship&#x27;s oak mast is constructed in one piece and stone provides ballast. &quot;Gaia&quot; can reach ten knots under its full canvas, which is 120 sq. m., and it has sixteen pairs of oars. &quot;Gaia&quot; also sailed to the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit via the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Greenland, and North America.

Other replicas include &quot;Munin&quot;, a half-scale replica in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the &quot;Íslendingur&quot; in the Viking World museum in Iceland, the &quot;Hugin&quot;, in Ramsgate, England, and a replica at the Hjemkomst Center in Moorhead, Minnesota.

<text>Medical cybernetics is a branch of cybernetics which has been heavily affected by the development of the computer, which applies the concepts of cybernetics to medical research and practice. At the intersection of systems biology, systems medicine and clinical applications it covers an emerging working program for the application of systems- and communication theory, connectionism and decision theory on biomedical research and health related questions.

== Overview ==
Medical cybernetics searches for quantitative descriptions of biological dynamics. It investigates intercausal networks in human biology, medical decision making and information processing structures in the living organism.

Approaches of medical cybernetics include:
* Systems theory in medical sciences: The scope of systems theory in the medical sciences is searching for and modelling of physiological dynamics in the intact and diseased organism. Its aim is to arrive at deeper insights into the organizational principles of life and its perturbations. Based on cybernetic models, improved diagnostical strategies and methods for personalised therapy of chronic diseases have been developed. With focus on medical application this field is also referred to as systems medicine.
* Medical information and communication theory: Motivated by the awareness of information being an essential principle of life, the application of communication theory to biomedicine aims at a mathematical description of signalling processes and information storage in different physiological layers. This attempt also includes theories on the information theory of the genetic code.
* Connectionism: Connectionistic models describe information processing in neural networks – thus forming a bridge between biological and technological research.
* Medical decision theory (MDT): The Goal of MDT is to gather evidence based foundations for decision making in the clinical setting.

<text>New Slovenia – Christian Democrats (, NSi) is a Christian democratic and conservative political party in Slovenia. Since 2018, it is led by Matej Tonin. The party was formed on 4 August 2000 following a split in the unified Slovenian People&#x27;s Party and Slovene Christian Democrats (SLS+SKD). NSi is a member of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) and in the European Parliament its MEP Ljudmila Novak sits with the European People&#x27;s Party Group.

Following the 2022 Slovenian parliamentary election, NSi is in opposition to the Golob government.

==History==

=== Establishment ===
In July 2000, Andrej Bajuk, by the time Prime Minister of a centre-right coalition government, and other centrist Christian democrats disagreed with the rest of the Slovenian People&#x27;s Party (SLS+SKD) over the question of a new electoral system. While Bajuk wanted the National Assembly to abandon proportional representation, the SLS+SKD party voted against any changes. Therefore, Bajuk retired from the party and created New Slovenia as his Prime Ministerial vehicle. Other former members of the Slovene Christian Democrats opposed to the merger of SKD and SLS, followed the foundation appeal. In the October 2000 parliamentary election, the new party won 8.6% of the vote and eight seats. Thereupon, Bajuk resigned as Prime Minister and New Slovenia went into opposition.

=== Since 2004 ===
From 2004 to 2008, New Slovenia was part of the 8th Government of Slovenia, a centre-right coalition led by Prime Minister Janez Janša of the Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS).

The first European Parliament election with Slovenian participation in 2004 was won by New Slovenia which received 24% of the votes and secured two of the seven Slovenian seats.

At the 2008 legislative elections, the party won only 3.4% of the popular vote and did not win any seats in the 90-seat National Assembly. After the elective failure of 2008, Bajuk announced his immediate resignation and retirement from politics. Ljudmila Novak succeeded him as party president.

At the 2011 Slovenian parliamentary election on 4 December 2011, it won 4.9% of votes, thus gaining four seats in the National Assembly.

In the 2014 European election, NSi ran in a joint electoral list with the Slovenian People&#x27;s Party, which received 16.6% of the vote and came in second place, returning 2 MEPs.

The party received 5.5% of the vote in the Slovenian parliamentary election on 13 July 2014, and won five seats in parliament.

At the 2018 Parliamentary election, NSi received 7.2% of electoral votes, which resulted in seven parliamentary seats. The party was in opposition until March 2020, when it entered a centre-right coalition with the SDS, Modern Centre Party and Democratic Party of Pensioners of Slovenia.

NSi&#x27;s Ljudmila Novak was elected as one of eight MEPs of Slovenia at the 2019 European election.

In the 2022 parliamentary election, NSi secured 6.9% of the vote, gaining eight seats in the National Assembly. It is currently in opposition.

==Ideology==
New Slovenia has taken a Christian conservative position on some issues, advocating traditional social values and defending the position of the Catholic Church on moral questions. The party is based on social conservatism, and has also been opposed to same-sex marriage and adoption by same sex couples, although it does support (and it also voted for) the current legislation, which gives certain rights to registered same sex couples.

In economic issues, it is generally liberal, but it defends a social market economy. It is a pro-European party.

In 2019, party leader Matej Tonin announced that the party would reposition itself in the political centre while refreshing its programme, reiterating its stated commitment to social market economy.

<doc id="723514" wikidata="Q2720155" url="?curid=723514" title="Michael Bruce (musician)">
<text>Michael Owen Bruce (born March 16, 1948) is an American rock musician who was a founding member of the original Alice Cooper band.

==Early life and Alice Cooper Group==
Michael Bruce started playing guitar and piano in early adolescence and was heavily influenced by the Beatles. In 1966, Bruce replaced John Tatum in popular Phoenix-based group The Spiders alongside Vincent Furnier, Glen Buxton, Dennis Dunaway, and John Speer. The group quickly established themselves as a top regional act, sharing the stage with such notable groups as The Yardbirds, The Animals, and The Hollies. After relocating to Los Angeles, the group rebranded themselves as the Nazz.

In 1968, after discovering that Todd Rundgren had formed a group called Nazz, Bruce and company changed the name of their project to Alice Cooper, reflecting the sardonic humor that characterized the group and their style. With Bruce&#x27;s contributions as a songwriter, the band released a string of hit albums in the 1970s, including &quot;Love It to Death&quot;, &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot;, and &quot;Billion Dollar Babies&quot;.

Bruce&#x27;s distinctive guitar riffs and keyboard parts became an essential component of the group’s sound, and his songwriting skills were crucial to the band&#x27;s success. He wrote or co-wrote many of the band&#x27;s most famous hits, including &quot;I&#x27;m Eighteen&quot;, &quot;Under My Wheels&quot;, &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot;, and &quot;No More Mr. Nice Guy&quot;.

==&quot;In My Own Way&quot;==
In 1973, Bruce began working on his own recordings with a group of musicians that included Mick Mashbir (guitars and vocals), Bob Dolin (keyboards and vocals), Frank Crandall (bass and vocals), and Don Lindley (percussion and vocals). Mashbir and Dolin had performed as members of the touring band with the Alice Cooper &quot;Billion Dollar Babies&quot; tour. This line-up recorded and produced four songs (&quot;King of America&quot;, &quot;As Rock Rolls On&quot;, &quot;Oh, My Love&quot; and &quot;Nothing on Earth&quot;) that producer Jack Douglas mixed.

When Bruce decided to leave Connecticut in 1974 and move to Lake Tahoe, Crandall and Lindley did not follow. Bruce, Dolin and Mashbir were then faced with finding a new rhythm section. Drummers such as William &quot;Curly&quot; Smith (Jo Jo Gunne) and John Barbata (The Turtles; Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young) came to play and record at Bruce&#x27;s Nevada home.

Bruce&#x27;s album &quot;In My Own Way&quot; was recorded over the course of three months in 1975 with producers Gene Cornish and Dino Danelli of The Rascals. Many different musicians came to the Record Plant and participated in the sessions for the album, including Keith Moon (The Who), Gerry Beckley (America), Jackie Lomax (Badger), Ricky Fataar (The Beach Boys), David Foster (Airplay), Hunt Sales (Todd Rundgren, Iggy Pop), Tony Sales (Todd Rundgren, Iggy Pop), Mylon LeFevre, Lynn Carey, and many more. American fashion photographer Francesco Scavullo did a shoot for Bruce that yielded the cover of &quot;In My Own Way&quot;.

==Billion Dollar Babies (band)==
Billion Dollar Babies was the name of the band founded in 1976 by Michael Bruce, Mike Marconi, Dennis Dunaway, Bob Dolin and Neal Smith after they split from Alice Cooper. Originally, Billion Dollar Babies started out in the hope that Alice would return and &quot;Battle Axe&quot; would be the new record from the Alice Cooper group.&quot; Time Magazine&quot; featured the group in a brief but hopeful write-up in 1977. There had been a theatrical stage show planned in which Bruce and Marconi would battle each other in the fashion of gladiators. Despite the positive start, the band was embroiled in a legal suit over the use of the name. The stage show was far too costly and the tour was quite brief. Their only release was 1977&#x27;s &quot;Battle Axe&quot;. The &quot;Battle Axe&quot; record lost any momentum it had when it was recalled for mastering problems which caused the turntable needle to skip. Jack Douglas, who had worked on &quot;Muscle of Love&quot; with Jack Richardson, was hired to fix the mastering problem. With so many problems weighing them down, the group disbanded.

During 2010, Bruce was called on for participation in a new Alice Cooper record &quot;Welcome 2 My Nightmare&quot; (the sequel to the original &quot;Welcome to My Nightmare&quot;). Bruce co-wrote the song &quot;When Hell Comes Home&quot; on the album. &quot;Welcome 2 My Nightmare&quot; also featured performances by Neal Smith, Dennis Dunaway, Dick Wagner and Steve Hunter. Additionally, Alice invited Bruce, Hunter, Dunaway and Smith to perform with him that December at his annual Christmas Pudding fundraiser at The Dodge Theatre in Phoenix, Arizona.

In spring 2011, Bruce (as a member of the original Alice Cooper group) was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the &quot;Performer&quot; category.

In early 2016, Bruce&#x27;s new band, Michael Bruce Force, played a show at Asylum Records celebrating Record Store Day on April 6, 2016, in Mesa, Arizona.

Bruce was featured on three songs on Alice Cooper&#x27;s next release, the 2017 album &quot;Paranormal&quot;: the song &quot;Rats&quot;, as well as two bonus tracks featuring original Alice Cooper band members: &quot;Genuine American Girl&quot; and &quot;You and All of Your Friends&quot;. He was subsequently featured on several tracks on Cooper&#x27;s 2021 album Detroit Stories.

<text>William Murdoch (24 February 1823 – 4 May 1887) was a Scottish-Canadian poet.

Born in Paisley, Renfrewshire, Scotland, Murdoch migrated to Canada in 1854, aged 31. The following year, he was appointed manager of the gasworks on Partridge Island in Saint John, New Brunswick. He contributed to the &quot;Saint John Morning News&quot; from 1865, and published &quot;Poems and Songs&quot; (1860) and &quot;Discursory Ruminations: A Fireside Drama&quot; (1876).

Murdoch died in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada.

==Style==
He wrote in the Lowland Scots dialogue made popular by Robert Burns. The &quot;Literary History of Canada&quot; describes Murdoch&#x27;s poems as having &quot;style and polish&quot; and it cites the following stanza as representative:

&quot;God pity then the poor blue noses Their cheeks like flour, their nebs like roses; They puff, they grue, and swallow doses&quot;
:&quot;To heat their wame&quot;
&quot;Till aft when night their business closes&quot;
:&quot;They hiccup hame.&quot;
:: – from &quot;Poems and Songs&quot;

<text>Palmyrene Aramaic was a Middle Aramaic dialect, exhibiting both Eastern and Western Aramaic grammatical features, and is therefore often regarded as a dialect continuum between the two branches. It was primarily documented in Palmyra itself, but also found in the western parts of the Roman Empire, extending as far as Britannia. Dated inscriptions range from 44 BCE to 274 CE, with over 4,000 known inscriptions, mostly comprising honorific, dedicatory, and funerary texts. The dialect still retains echoes of earlier Imperial Aramaic. The lexicon bears influences from both Koine Greek and, to some extent, Arabic.

The dual had disappeared from it.

The written Palmyrene language was composed in a rounded script that later exhibited resemblances to the Syriac Estrangela script.

<doc id="723544" wikidata="Q3509310" url="?curid=723544" title="Svalbard Undersea Cable System">
<text>The Svalbard Undersea Cable System is a twin submarine communications cable which connects Svalbard to the mainland of Norway. The two optical fiber cable consist of two segments, from Harstad to Breivika in Andøy Municipality, and from Breivika to Hotellneset near Longyearbyen in Svalbard. The segments from Harstad to Breivika are long, respectively, and the segments from Breivika to Hotellneset . Each consists of eight fiber pairs and there are twenty optical communications repeaters on each segment. Each segment has a speed of 10 gigabits per second (Gb/s), with a future potential capacity of 2,500 Gbit/s. The system is now the sole telecommunications link to the archipelago.

Planning of the cables started in 2002 by the Norwegian Space Centre (NSC), who wanted increased bandwidth to expand their business at Svalbard Satellite Station (SvalSat). At the time all telecommunications from Svalbard were relayed via communications satellite. Financing was secured through a deal with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The cable system was supplied by Tyco Telecommunications and laying of the cable was carried out by Global Marine Systems in July and August 2003.

==History==
Svalbard was chosen for the location of SvalSat because of its high latitude which allows all satellites in a low Earth orbit with an orbit above to use only a single ground station, yet allow downloading from every orbit. SvalSat opened on 15 April 1999. It was established as a cooperation between NASA and NS. However, the ground station&#x27;s capacity was limited by its broadband capacity. Transmission took place via a 55-Mbit/s connection via Intelsat, which served the archipelago&#x27;s needs within telephone and Internet connection.

Telenor and the NSC conducted a feasibility study in 2002 for connecting SvalSat to the mainland by fiber. It was estimated to cost between NOK 400 and 500 million, or US$50 million, which presumed the laying of one cable with satellite used as backup. A stakeholder meeting was held on 24 and 25 July, which saw representatives from NASA, the Integrated Programme Office (IPO), the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and the European Space Agency (ESA). Later that year the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System selected Helsinki over Svalbard for its ground station, largely because of the former&#x27;s connection to the fiber network. NSC was in October offered various prices between US$30 and 40 million for the laying of a single fiber cable.
NSC conducted negotiations with NASA on 31 October 2002, resulting in an understanding of NASA being able to provide $US20 million towards the line, paid over seven years. The following day Telenor stated they were not interested in participating in the venture. Telenor changed its opinion in the following weeks and agreed to press forward on 18 November. The invitation to tender was issued on 21 December, with a deadline of 3 February. Bringing the line out from Andøya was selected because it is the only trawler-free area along the Norwegian coast north of Trondheim. The tender deadline was extended to 25 February. The bids showed the possibility of laying a twin cable ring for US$40 million. However, the cable-laying companies were not willing to accept a payment over seven years.

Tyco Communications was announced as the winner on 7 March and negotiations were finalized on 14 April, as a turnkey contract on the condition that the cable could be financed. The main difficulty was that NSC, a foundation, had very little equity, and spent most of its cash on a US$300,000 detailed study for Tyco to advance the planning. Hannon Armstrong was selected as a financial partner and the money was guaranteed by the Ministry of Trade and Industry. The first work took place at Breivika: the land-owner was contacted on 7 May, a sales agreement was signed on 13 May, permits were finalized on 23 May, construction started the next day and the NOK 5-million facility was completed on 25 July. Permission for the installations on Svalbard was granted on 17 June.

Cable-laying started on 21 July and lasted until 15 August. The work set a world record deep plow. The work was carried out using the cable-laying vessels &quot;Cable Innovator&quot; and &quot;Maersk Recorder&quot;. Segment 1 was spliced on 1 August and Segment 2 was spliced on 13 August. Any costs exceeding US$40 million were covered by Telenor Svalbard, who levied it on other users on Svalbard over a period of six years.

==Specifications==
The fiber cable system runs from Harstad via Breivika on the island of Andøya to Hotellneset on Svalbard. The system consists of two separate cables, Segment 1 and Segment 2 between Breivika and Hotellneset, and Segment 1A and Segment 2A between Breivika and Harstad. The lengths for Segment 1 and 2 are , respectively, and for Segment 1A and 2A . Both cables have eight fiber pairs, of which only one is in use. Use of additional pairs requires new equipment to be installed in Harstad and Hotellneset. Segment 2 is redundant to Segment 1 and is only used if the former should fall out. Near shore the cables are armored.

On the main section, each segment is equipped with twenty optical communications repeaters. These run off direct current fed from Breivika, with the seawater and seabed used for return current. Power is provided through a single-end feed; although supplying from both ends is safer, a single feed was regarded as sufficient. The cables are fed 1.1 ampere at 2,500 volt, fed from two redundant converters. Each repeater has eight erbium doped fiber amplifier pairs. The pairs operate independently of each other, including having their own power supply, allowing for redundancy should one fall out. The repeaters have an estimated lifetime of twenty-five years. The cables are equipped with an ocean ground protection panel to provide isolation and thus hinder damage from lightning.

If it is necessary to pick up the cables, the power feed equipment can send a 4 to 5 hertz sine wave through the high-voltage output, which can be detected on the seabed. Line terminating equipment (LTE) is installed at Longyearbyen and Harstad. The system is capable of handling the entire length without regeneration of the signal. It employs clear-channel transmission, which is protocol-independent, with the transmissions using the Synchronous Digital Hierarchy protocols. The LTE is fed both an STM-1 at 155 Mbit/s and an STM-64 at 10 Gbit/s, resulting in a STM-64 and OC-192 protocol for transmission. The system is monitored using the Tyco Element Manager System, which are installed in Longyearbyen, Harstad and at Telenor&#x27;s Network Operations Center in Fornebu. The system can be extended to 2,500 Gbit/s on each cable, by employing all pairs and adding additional wavelengths.

==Severing of the Undersea cable==
The Svalbard undersea cable system connecting the archipelago to the mainland was unexpectedly severed in January 2022. A preliminary police investigation implicates human activity.

<text>Martin Campbell (born 24 October 1943) is a New Zealand film and television director, based in the United Kingdom. He is best known for his works in the action and thriller film genres, including the James Bond films &quot;GoldenEye&quot; (1995) and &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (2006), &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; (1998) and its sequel &quot;The Legend of Zorro&quot; (2005), &quot;Vertical Limit&quot; (2000), and &quot;The Foreigner&quot; (2017). Earlier in his career, he directed the critically acclaimed BBC drama serial &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; (1985), which earned him a British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series. He later directed the 2010 theatrical film adaptation of the serial.

==Life and career==
Born in Hastings, New Zealand, Campbell moved to London, where he began his career as a director of softcore sex comedies and action television series in the 1970s. He went on to direct two James Bond films, 1995&#x27;s &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, starring Pierce Brosnan, and 2006&#x27;s &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, starring Daniel Craig. At 62 years old, Campbell was the oldest director in the series&#x27; history, beating the previous record set by Lewis Gilbert. Campbell stated that he was offered the opportunity to direct further James Bond films after &quot;GoldenEye&quot;; however, he found the plots to be limiting and only considered directing further films if working with a new Bond actor – as he subsequently did with Daniel Craig on &quot;Casino Royale&quot;.

He directed two Zorro films: &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; (1998) and &quot;The Legend of Zorro&quot; (2005), both starring Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Campbell also directed the 2011 film adaptation of the DC Comics superhero &quot;Green Lantern&quot;, as well as &quot;The Foreigner&quot; (2017), starring Jackie Chan. 
On television, Campbell directed the film &quot;Cast a Deadly Spell&quot; and oversaw some of the more action-oriented episodes from the TV series &quot;The Professionals&quot; (1977–1983). However, his best-known work is the 1985 BBC Television drama serial &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot;, for which he won the British Academy Television Award for Best Director in 1986. Campbell has also directed a 2010 movie remake of &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot;, starring Mel Gibson and Ray Winstone. Campbell directed the first episode of the US TV series &quot;Last Resort&quot;. and his upcoming film &quot;Cleaner&quot; is set to be released in 2025.

===Unrealized projects===
In June 2007, Campbell was in negotiations to replace Robert Schwentke as director of the film, now titled &quot;Unstoppable&quot;. Campbell was involved until March 2009, when Tony Scott came on board as director.

In July 2010, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that a film based on the 1980s series &quot;The Fall Guy&quot; was in development. DreamWorks Pictures had teamed up with producers Walter F. Parkes and Laurie MacDonald on the project, and Campbell was in talks to direct the film. In September 2020, Universal Pictures announced that &quot;The Fall Guy&quot; would star Ryan Gosling and be directed by David Leitch.

Campbell was initially chosen to direct &quot;Hunter Killer,&quot; but, on 2 March 2016 it was announced that Donovan Marsh would direct the film.

==Personal life==
Martin Campbell has been married to his wife Sol E. Romero, since 2006. Previously in 2002 he had married Valarie Trapp but they divorced in 2006.

<doc id="723549" wikidata="Q16259089" url="?curid=723549" title="Pyst">
<text>Pyst (stylised as PYST) is an adventure computer game released in October 1996. It was created as a parody of the highly successful adventure game &quot;Myst&quot;. &quot;Pyst&quot; was written by Peter Bergman, a co-founder of the Firesign Theatre, and was published by Parroty Interactive, with Bergman, Stallone, Inc. as co-publisher. Mindscape began distributing the game on August 20, 1997. The parody features full motion video of actor John Goodman as &quot;King Mattruss&quot;, the ruler of &quot;Pyst Island&quot;. Versions of the game were produced for both the Windows PC and Apple Macintosh operating systems.

Parroty Interactive was a division of Palladium Interactive, whose other brands included Ultimate Family Tree and Palladium Kids. Parroty intended to create &quot;National Lampoon&quot;-esque &quot;humorous CD-ROMs, web sites and other forms of interactive comedy&quot;. This title served as Parroty&#x27;s debut game in the interactive parody space, which would be followed by games such as their &quot;Star Wars&quot; parody &quot;Star Warped&quot;.

==Development==
The basic concept of &quot;Pyst&quot; was to show what Myst Island (from the best-selling game) would look like after four million people (that game&#x27;s players) had visited and &quot;explored&quot;. &quot;Pyst&quot; developer and comedian Peter Bergman wanted to give &quot;Myst&quot; players the ability to &quot;&#x27;experience the island in a whole new light&quot;. Palladium President Ed Bernstein wanted the game to be a &quot;transformative work that moved way beyond &quot;Myst&quot;&quot;, in order to avoid copyright issues with &quot;Myst&quot; publisher Broderbund, on the grounds of the new game being a parody work. A spokesman from Broderbund said the company was unfazed by the project, commenting: &quot;We&#x27;ve seen imitators and they usually just give us a good chuckle&quot;. Bergman discovered that the sense of comic timing he had for his live shows couldn&#x27;t be replicated in the digital realm, and he had to adapt accordingly. Firesign Theatre website &quot;Firezine&quot; said that the game was illustrative of Bergman&#x27;s ability to &quot;survey America&#x27;s culture and obsessions like a maniacal monitor reflecting the absurdness of it all, while casting his iconoclastic eye to read the entrails of the present coarse and our delirious future&quot;.

Bergman collaborated with David Ossman, Phil Proctor, Melinda Peterson, sound designer Ted Bonnitt and other players from his &quot;Radio Free Oz&quot; show to produce the game. In addition, he hired Mike Sansonia to create the game&#x27;s music, while Ted Bonnitt directed mouth-sound-effects artist Fred Newman to record voice tracks to blend with recorded sound effects. The effect was to create a sound design with distinct, comedic character. John Goodman plays &quot;King Mattruss&quot;, the ruler of &quot;Pyst Island&quot;. The 2004 book &quot;Game Work: Language, Power, and Computer Game Culture&quot; noted that this was an example of the then-recent trend of famous actors starring in digital movies within games. Goodman and Bergman had worked together in radio, while Goodman also had appeared on the &quot;Proctor and Bergman Comedy Service&quot; series prior to &quot;Pyst&quot;. The game also includes an original song, &quot;I&#x27;m Pyst&quot;, performed by Goodman and written by Bergman.

===Release===
Before the game&#x27;s release, Bergman and the Parroty Interactive marketing department were both secretive about game-related information; Bergman said that this was unusual experience for him. The game was originally planned for release on October 15, 1996. Released for Christmas 1996, &quot;Pyst&quot; remained on the CD-ROM best-seller list through 1999, according to the &quot;Official Millennium Survival Handbook&quot;. The game was &quot;highly successful&quot;; in 1997 Palladium&#x27;s vice president of marketing Rob Halligan said that &quot;Pyst&quot; was &quot;tremendously successful last Christmas and continues to sell well&quot;. A Mindscape press release issued through &quot;Business Wire&quot; said the game was the &quot;top-selling parody product of 1996&quot;, selling over 200,000 copies worldwide. There was a website extension to the game, which allowed players to further interact with the game by &quot;download[ing] updated video and audio clips and chat[ing] with other &quot;Pyst&quot; aficionados&quot;, the game being the first product by Palladium to include dial-up access to AT&amp;T WorldNet Service. Hal Josephson, executive producer for &quot;Pyst&quot;, said that there were few business models at the time for how to make money online. In 1998, after Parroty&#x27;s acquisition by The Learning Company, Palladium founder and chief executive officer Ed Bernstein said that &quot;it was a fun business, but not terribly lucrative&quot;.

==Plot and gameplay==

Pyst Island is full of litter, most of the buildings are ruined, and graffiti reveals secret doors and solutions to puzzles that challenged players in &quot;Myst&quot;. &quot;Pyst&quot; utilizes three-dimensional graphics, animated drawings, and pre-recorded video and audio.

Gameplay is a simplified version of the playing style used for &quot;Myst&quot;. The game consists of a series of pre-rendered, interactive visuals of Pyst Island locations. With Bergman&#x27;s &quot;seal of disapproval&quot;, the concept is that the familiar &quot;Myst&quot; locations have been vandalized by millions of virtual players who have been trapped on the island, having &quot;giv[en] up on trying to finish the damn thing&quot;, and as a result have trashed the space, while a shady entrepreneur has built a &quot;Dorian Grey money-making scheme&quot;. Unlike in &quot;Myst&quot; there are no real puzzles to solve. The player simply explores a setting, and then moves to adjoining locations at will.

The game does not feature the &quot;Myst&quot;-style point-and-click interface. Instead, the players are shown an image on a postcard with four arrow keys, on the edges, that players click to change the image on the postcard. The player moves through the scenes clicking the lateral arrow keys; clicking the upper and lower arrow keys two postcards are shown for every scene, all featuring a special Pyst currency in a stamp, stylised as &quot;5&quot;.

==Critical reception==
The game received mixed reviews. While noted for its novelty as one of the first parody video games, &quot;Pyst&quot; was seen as not living up to its full potential as a parody of ripe and timely subject matter and was criticized for lacking in gaming content, being more of an interactive story than a game.

&quot;Electric Playground&quot; praised the game for having a &quot;cheeky attitude and an irreverence&quot; not found in the source material. &quot;Hop on Pop: The Politics and Pleasures of Popular Culture&quot; wrote that &quot;Pyst&quot; challenges the central conceit of &quot;Myst&quot;, whereby the &quot;untouched landscape&quot; navigated by a &quot;lone trailblazer&quot; is reimagined as a popular, commercialised tourist attraction. &quot;PC Primer&quot; thought it was &quot;side-splitting&quot; and &quot;light-hearted&quot;. &quot;MacGamer&quot; gave it the distinction of being the first parody video game, and deemed it a &quot;mildly amusing, short-lived parody with no gaming component&quot;. &quot;Electric Games&quot; unfavourably compared it to an older, and in its opinion better, parody entitled &quot;Mylk&quot; due to the latter being free and having gameplay. &quot;Computer World&quot; thought that the game offered salvation to the multitude of players who remained perpetually stuck on Myst Island. The &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; thought Goodman was &quot;at the core of the game&quot;. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; thought it was a good alternative to those stumped by &quot;Myst&quot;, describing it as &quot;not really a game but...a lot of fun&quot;. &quot;Salon&quot; said the game &quot;cheerfully capitalizes on that frustration&quot; of playing the mysterious and elusive &quot;Myst&quot;, and added that the &quot;emergence of full-scale parodies&quot; like this was a sign of the video game industry&#x27;s &quot;arid decadence&quot;.

&quot;Electronic Design&quot; called the game a &quot;wacky parody&quot; that reimagines the well-known island as something out of an industrial nightmare. &quot;In the Eyes of the Setting Sun&quot; deemed it &quot;satirical&quot;, while &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; thought all of Parroty Interactive&#x27;s work was &quot;hilarious&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; found it to be funnier than &quot;Myst&quot; and &quot;all-too-short&quot;. &quot;Plotting New Media Frontiers&quot; thought that the existence of parody games demonstrated that &quot;generic conventions are well established and part of the culture associated with computer game playing&quot;, citing &quot;Pyst&quot; as a prime example. &quot;Computer Shopper&quot; said the title was &quot;no-holds-barred&quot; and &quot;pulls no punches&quot; in its odd sense of humour, and deemed it a favourable alternative to those who were annoyed by &quot;Myst&quot;″s &quot;inscrutable puzzles&quot;. &quot;CD Mag&quot; thought the game was &quot;somewhat witty&quot;. Emil Pagliarulo of &quot;The Adrenaline Vault&quot; saw &quot;Pyst&quot; as an example of how Parroty Interactive made games that were &quot;completely original simply by capitalizing on unoriginality&quot;.

&quot;PC Gamer&quot; said that &quot;Pyst&quot;″s two main problems were that it was not funny as a parody of &quot;Myst&quot;, and that it was not so much a game than a &quot;series of rendered slides in sequence&quot;. &quot;Giant Bomb&quot; writer Alex Navarro thought he had not enjoyed the game&#x27;s humour in his youth as he had not played &quot;Myst&quot;; he retrospectively claimed that the game was &quot;not a very good parody&quot;. K. R. Parkinson of &quot;Adventure Gamers&quot; wrote that the game &quot;ultimately comes up lacking in its attempt to lampoon its best-selling target of derision&quot;. &quot;BrutalMoose&quot; felt the game was a good idea wrapped up in a bad execution. A reviewer from &quot;Game Revolution&quot; gave it a scathing review, deeming it &quot;pathetic&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described it as a &quot;pretension-busting romp through a ripe-for-puncturing cult classic&quot;, comparing it to &quot;Mad&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;201 Min. of a Space Idiocy&quot; parody of &quot;A Space Odyssey&quot;. &quot;PC Multimedia &amp; Entertainment&quot; initially thought the game was a &quot;stupid idea&quot;, but upon playing it found it to be a &quot;very funny multimedia presentation&quot;. &quot;The Daily Pennsylvanian&quot; concluded their review by saying that while &quot;Myst&quot; sucked the player in, &quot;Pyst&quot; &quot;just plain sucked&quot;. Andy Oldfield of &quot;The Independent&quot; thought the game was merely a &quot;series of puns and visual gags&quot;, not a proper parody. &quot;HardcoreGaming101&quot; felt the game only had 30 minutes of gameplay.

==Legacy==
The game is considered by many to be the earliest parody video game and the first parody of the &quot;Myst&quot; series, but a free &quot;homage&quot; game entitled &quot;Mylk&quot; was created by Bart Gold using Macromedia Director and released earlier. &quot;Mylk&quot;″s PC version was by Wayne Twitchell. The plot of this game involves a &quot;dairy cow fall[ing] through a crevice to a ranch&quot;. &quot;Stories in Between: Narratives and Mediums @ Play&quot; listed &quot;Pyst&quot;, &quot;Mysty&quot;, &quot;Missed&quot;, and &quot;Mylk&quot; as four parody games based on the &quot;Myst&quot; series. &quot;The Mysterious World of Missed&quot;, or &quot;Missed&quot;, was developed by Jason Bloomberg. &quot;100 Videogames&quot; noted the success of &quot;Myst&quot; is &quot;best demonstrated by the amount of parodies constructed of it&quot;. Daniel Rosen of &quot;Built To Play&quot; thought the game was a predecessor to exploration video games like &quot;Gone Home&quot; and &quot;Dear Esther&quot;.

A demo of the planned sequel to &quot;Pyst&quot;, &quot;Driven&quot; (an allusion to the &quot;Myst&quot; sequel &quot;Riven&quot;), was included on CD-ROMs of later Parroty Interactive games, including the &quot;&quot;Pyst&quot; Special Edition&quot; re-release of the game. &quot;Driven&quot; was graphically more advanced and allowed greater movement. The full game was never released, however. Palladium Interactive was bought by The Learning Company in 1998, who proceeded to dissolve Parroty Interactive before the title was finished.

<doc id="723555" wikidata="Q917211" url="?curid=723555" title="Social Democrats (Slovenia)">
<text>The Social Democrats (, SD) is a centre-left social democratic political party in Slovenia. Led by Matjaž Han, the party was known as the United List of Social Democrats ( ) from 1993 until 2005. It is the successor of the League of Communists of Slovenia. As of 2022, the party is a member of a three-party coalition government with Robert Golob&#x27;s Freedom Movement alongside The Left, as well as a full member of the Party of European Socialists and Progressive Alliance.

==History==
===Origins===
The origins of the modern-day party date from the end of 1989, when the League of Communists of Slovenia decided to renounce the absolute monopoly over political, social and economic life in the Socialist Republic of Slovenia, and agreed to introduce a system of political pluralism. On 23 January 1990, the Slovenian Communists left the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and on 4 February 1990 renamed themselves to League of Communists of Slovenia-Party of Democratic Renewal (&quot;Zveza komunistov Slovenije-&quot;, ZKS-SDP). Former prominent Communist politician Ciril Ribičič was elected as the party&#x27;s new president. The party lost against the Democratic Opposition of Slovenia (DEMOS) centre-right coalition at the first democratic elections in Slovenia in April 1990, gaining 17.3% of the popular vote. They nevertheless became the single largest party in Slovenia.

Between 1990 and 1992, the party remained in opposition against the centre-right coalition government of Lojze Peterle. After the fall of Peterle&#x27;s cabinet in 1992, the party entered the first coalition government of Janez Drnovšek, formed by the left wing of the dissolved DEMOS coalition (the Social Democratic Party of Slovenia, the Democratic Party of Slovenia and the Greens of Slovenia). The same year, the party was renamed to Social Democratic Renewal (), maintaining the same acronym, SDP.

===Constitution of the United List===
Prior to the 1992 general election intensive discussions were held and agreements reached between left-oriented political parties and groups on an electoral coalition. Thus just prior the parliamentary election of 1992, an agreement was reached between the Social Democratic Renewal (SDP) and three smaller extra-parliamentary centre-left and left-wing parties (the Social Democratic Union, the Workers&#x27; Party of Slovenia and the Democratic Party of Pensioners of Slovenia) to form an electoral coalition under the name United List. The newly formed coalition gained 13.6% of the popular vote, thus becoming the third political force in the country, after Liberal Democracy of Slovenia and the Slovene Christian Democrats. These three largest parties decided to form a government coalition, which soon became popularly known as the &quot;grand coalition&quot; (), under the leadership of Liberal Democrat Prime Minister Janez Drnovšek. Until March 1994, the Social Democratic Party of Slovenia also participated in this government coalition.

On 29 May 1993, a congress was held in Ljubljana at which the constitutive members of the United List decided to form a unified party. The new party was named the United List of Social Democrats and Janez Kocijančič was elected as its president. The party remained in government until January 1996, when it left the ruling coalition in disagreement over the government&#x27;s social welfare policies. Furthermore, several prominent members exited the party and re-established Democratic Party of Pensioners of Slovenia. In the general elections of 1996, the United List of Social Democrats suffered a substantial loss support, gaining only around 9% of the popular vote.

===Pahor era===
In the period between 1996 and 2000, the party remained in opposition. On the third National Congress of the United List of Social Democrats in 1997 a new party president, Borut Pahor, was elected. A gradual evolution towards more moderate positions started. In the election of 2000, the party rose to 12% of the vote and entered the centre-left coalition government led by Janez Drnovšek, while the party&#x27;s president Borut Pahor was elected chairman of the Slovenian National Assembly. In the general elections of 2004, the party gained around 10.2% of the vote and went into opposition against the centre-right government dominated by the Slovenian Democratic Party.

In the fifth party Congress held in 2005 in Ljubljana, the decision was taken to shorten the party name to the Social Democrats. Borut Pahor was confirmed as the party president, strengthening his positions against internal opposition from the left wing of the party. In the programmatic congress held in Nova Gorica in July 2006, the party clearly distanciated itself against its communist past, while its president publicly condemned the socialist regime in Slovenia and Yugoslavia established after World War II.

After the internal crisis in the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia (LDS) following the loss of election in 2004, which resulted in the split of the party, the Social Democrats emerged as the main centre-left opposition force against the centre-right government led by Janez Janša. In 2007, several prominent members of the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia, including former Prime Minister Anton Rop, left their party and joined the Social Democrats. Following these developments, the Social Democrats became the second largest parliamentary party in Slovenia, after the Slovenian Democratic Party.

In 2008, the Social Democrats signed a coalition agreement with the extra-parliamentary &quot;Christian Socialists of Slovenia&quot;, and decided to set up a common election list on the coming elections.

In September 2008, Social Democrats won the parliamentary election with 30.45%. The ruling Slovenian Democratic Party finished second with 29.26%. Social Democrats formed a new Slovenian government in coalition with Zares, DeSUS and LDS. They won 29 seats in the 90-member National Assembly, one of which was won by Andrej Magajna, the president of the Christian Socialists of Slovenia. In October 2010, Andrej Magajna left the deputy group of Social Democrats due to differences of opinion with the rest of the group. He especially criticised the party leader Borut Pahor and the Minister of Economic Development Mitja Gaspari, claiming that he had been threatened with &quot;removal&quot; for not having supported the new act on the public broadcaster RTV Slovenija. After Magajna&#x27;s break with the party, the SD parliamentary group was left with 28 MPs.

SD won 10.5% of the vote at the early 2011 Slovenian parliamentary election on 4 December 2011, gaining 10 seats in the National Assembly. SD were therefore in third place behind the SDS and new centre-left party Positive Slovenia (PS). SDS leader Janez Janša became Prime Minister for a second time on 10 February 2012 heading a centre-right coalition government.

===Lukšič era===
In June 2012, Pahor unsuccessfully ran for re-election as president of the Social Democrats. He was defeated by Igor Lukšič by a narrow margin.

However, on 20 March 2013 Janša&#x27;s coalition was replaced by a new government headed by PS interim leader Alenka Bratušek, a comprising PS, the Social Democrats, Civic List and DeSUS. Bratušek resigned as Prime Minister on 3 May 2014 seeking an early general election.

After the party won only one MEP seat and 8.0% of the vote in 2014 European Parliament election, Lukšič resigned as SD party president on 26 May.

The party received 5.95% of the vote in the Slovenian parliamentary election on 13 July 2014, and won 6 seats in parliament. On 18 September 2014, the Social Democrats joined the cabinet of Miro Cerar, also comprising Prime Minister Cerar&#x27;s Modern Centre Party (SMC) and DeSUS.

===Židan leadership===

SD scored badly at the 2014 European election, only obtaining 8,08% of votes and one seat. Following the result, Lukšič resigned and Dejan Židan was elected as new leader of the party.

The party improved its result in the 2018 parliamentary election, scoring 9,9% of votes and winning ten seats in the National Assembly. The Social Democrats later joined Marjan Šarec&#x27;s government and held the posts of Minister of Justice and Minister of Culture until the dissolution of government in January 2020 by Marjan Šarec.

==International affiliations==
The United List of Social Democrats became full member party of Socialist International at the organisation&#x27;s 20th Congress in September 1996 in New York City. Since 16 May 2003, the Social Democrats have been a full member party of the Party of European Socialists (PES). SD party representatives were present at the foundation of the Progressive Alliance on 22 May 2013. SD was delisted from the Socialist International in December 2014 for not paying membership fees.

<doc id="723558" wikidata="Q1097007" url="?curid=723558" title="Claude Moraes">
<text>Claude Ajit Moraes, Baron Moraes, (born 22 October 1965), is a British Labour Party politician and campaigner, who was a member of the European Parliament (MEP) for London between 1999 and the United Kingdom&#x27;s withdrawal from the EU in 2020. He was chair of the Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Committee, deputy leader of the European Parliamentary Labour Party and vice-president of the Socialists and Democrats Group in the European Parliament.

==Background==
Claude Moraes is of Indian descent. He was born in Aden, and grew up in Scotland, having moved to Dundee aged four from India. His parents are Indian Catholics from Karnataka and Mumbai. He attended St Modan&#x27;s High School, Stirling and studied law and postgraduate international law at the University of Dundee, Birkbeck, University of London and the London School of Economics and Political Science. He was Associate Fellow at City Law School, University of London.

==Previous work==
After leaving Scotland, Moraes settled in East London, living and volunteering at Toynbee Hall, an anti-poverty charity, where he was later a Council Member.

He was House of Commons researcher to MPs John Reid and Paul Boateng following the 1987 General Election and a national officer at the Trades Union Congress in 1989, where he also represented the TUC at the European Trade Union Confederation.

Prior to his MEP election, Moraes received recognition as director of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, a UK-based independent legal protection NGO founded in 1967 specialising in refugee and migration issues. At JCWI he helped organise legal challenges in the UK and European Courts succeeding Dame Anne Owers as director in 1992. Moraes was appointed a Commissioner at the Commission for Racial Equality 1997-2002 and was an elected council member of Liberty 1994–2002.

He contested the parliamentary constituency of Harrow West in the 1992 General Election, placing second.

==Member of the European Parliament, 1999–2020==
He was elected to the European Parliament in the 1999 European elections, that year becoming the first South Asian (Indian) origin MEP elected to the European Parliament. He was re-elected to the European Parliament at the number one position on the Labour Party list in the 2004 and again in the first-place position in the 2009, and 2014 European Elections.

Initially a member of the Employment and Social Affairs and Legal Affairs and Internal Market Committees he was involved in the campaign for and identifying barriers to the EU wide implementation of the Race Equality Directive (2000). His legislative reports include the Protection of Minorities in an Enlarged Europe (2005), Protection of Seasonal Workers in the EU (2014) and Blue Card Migration Directive (Revision) (2017).

From 2009 to 2014 he was the elected Spokesperson for the Socialists and Democrats Group (S&amp;D) on the Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Committee.

In 2013 Moraes was appointed Rapporteur for the Parliament Inquiry into Mass Surveillance following the leaks from Edward Snowden. The Inquiry and his Report &quot;US NSA surveillance programmes, surveillance bodies in various Member States and their impact on EU citizens&#x27; fundamental rights and on transatlantic cooperation in Justice and Home Affairs&quot;, voted in March 2014, was sometimes referred to as the Parliament&#x27;s &quot;European Digital Bill of Rights&quot; as it looked at human rights and commercial priorities for the EU in the areas of data protection, privacy, surveillance, governance of the internet, extreme content and take-down policy, encryption, and cybercrime.

He was chair of the European Parliament Inquiry into Facebook in 2018 opening with a special evidence session questioning Mark Zuckerberg and the inquiry looked at wider issues of electoral interference, misuse of personal data, and the implications of Cambridge Analytica.

In July 2014 Moraes was elected chairman of the European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE Committee) where he chaired EU legislative trilogues including GDPR, and the Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD), and negotiated for the Parliament with third countries on a number of security and data agreements including the EU/US Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme (SWIFT).

Following the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, he became a member of the European Parliament&#x27;s Brexit Steering Committee until the 2019 European Elections. He contributed to the Parliament&#x27;s position on the Withdrawal Agreement in the areas of EU citizens rights, rights of British citizens in the EU, security union and law enforcement, data adequacy, migration, asylum law and free movement.

In 2018 as part of his committee&#x27;s increasing role in the humanitarian, budgetary and legislative aspects of the refugee crisis, he led delegations to Libya, Niger, Lebanon, and the Greek and Italian reception &quot;hotspots&quot; to improve the EU&#x27;s response. In 2019 he continued his long standing refugee work as Rapporteur for the European Asylum Support Agency.

Also in 2018 he was Standing Rapporteur for the European Parliament consent procedure on the European Commission&#x27;s decision to directly invoke Article 7 of the EU Treaties for the first time into alleged rule of law breaches by the Polish government. He led all-party European Parliament rule of law delegations that year to Poland and Slovakia following the murder there of investigative journalist Ján Kuciak.

In 2019 he oversaw, with the Committee on Budget Control, the European Parliament mandate to appoint the first European Chief Public Prosecutor and operational office tackling corruption, calling on EPPO&#x27;s remit to be extended to fight serious organised criminals, including people traffickers.

In May 2019, Moraes stood for the Labour Party at the number one position in the London constituency and was reelected in the 2019 European Elections. Following those elections he was elected vice president of the Socialists and Democrats Group (S&amp;D) in the European Parliament.

==House of Lords==
Moraes was nominated for a life peerage by Prime Minister Keir Starmer in late 2024. He was created &quot;Baron Moraes, of Hawkhill in the City of Dundee&quot;, on 15 January 2025, and was introduced to the House of Lords on 16 January. On 10 February 2025, Moraes was appointed as a lord-in-waiting government whip.

==Honours and recognition==
In 2011 Moraes was &quot;Dod&#x27;s&quot; and the &quot;European Parliament Magazine&quot;&#x27;s &#x27;MEP of the Year&#x27; for work on human rights. In 2016 he was named as one of Politico Magazine&#x27;s &quot;40 MEPs Who Actually Matter&quot;. In 2017 the organisation Vote Watch Europe listed him as &quot;the most influential&quot; British MEP and sixth most influential MEP in the European Parliament. In 2019, with MPs Alberto Costa and Stuart McDonald he was given the Ambassador Award for work on EU citizens rights by the3million. Claude Moraes was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to human rights, and awarded an honorary doctorate (DUniv) by the University of Greenwich in 2022.

<doc id="723561" wikidata="Q2742406" url="?curid=723561" title="Biological agent">
<text>Biological agents, also known as biological weapons or bioweapons, are pathogens used as weapons. In addition to these living or replicating pathogens, toxins and biotoxins are also included among the bio-agents. More than 1,200 different kinds of potentially weaponizable bio-agents have been described and studied to date.

Some biological agents have the ability to adversely affect human health in a variety of ways, ranging from relatively mild allergic reactions to serious medical conditions, including serious injury, as well as serious or permanent disability or death. Many of these organisms are ubiquitous in the natural environment where they are found in water, soil, plants, or animals. Bio-agents may be amenable to &quot;weaponization&quot; to render them easier to deploy or disseminate. Genetic modification may enhance their incapacitating or lethal properties, or render them impervious to conventional treatments or preventives. Since many bio-agents reproduce rapidly and require minimal resources for propagation, they are also a potential danger in a wide variety of occupational settings.

The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention is an international treaty banning the development, use or stockpiling of biological weapons; as of March 2021, there were 183 states parties to the treaty. Bio-agents are, however, widely studied for both defensive and medical research purposes under various biosafety levels and within biocontainment facilities throughout the world.

==Classifications==
===Operational===
The former United States biological weapons program (1943–1969) categorized its weaponized anti-personnel bio-agents as either &quot;lethal agents&quot; (&quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot;, &quot;Francisella tularensis&quot;, Botulinum toxin) or &quot;incapacitating agents&quot; (&quot;Brucella suis&quot;, &quot;Coxiella burnetii&quot;, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, staphylococcal enterotoxin B).

===Legal===
Since 1997, United States law has declared a list of bio-agents designated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services or the U.S. Department of Agriculture that have the &quot;potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety&quot; to be officially defined as &quot;select agents&quot; and possession or transportation of them are tightly controlled as such. Select agents are divided into &quot;HHS select agents and toxins&quot;, &quot;USDA select agents and toxins&quot; and &quot;Overlap select agents and toxins&quot;.

===Regulatory===
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) breaks biological agents into three categories: Category A, Category B, and Category C. Category A agents pose the greatest threat to the US. Criteria for being a Category &quot;A&quot; agent include high rates of morbidity and mortality, ease of dissemination and communicability, ability to cause a public panic, and special action required by public health officials to respond. Category A agents include anthrax, botulism, plague, smallpox, and viral hemorrhagic fevers.

==List of bio-agents of military importance==
:&quot;The following pathogens and toxins were weaponized by one nation or another at some time. NATO abbreviations are included where applicable.&quot;

===Bacterial bio-agents===
===Chlamydial bio-agents===
===Rickettsial bio-agents===
===Viral bio-agents===
===Mycotic bio-agents===
===Biological toxins===
===Biological vectors===
===Simulants===
Simulants are organisms or substances which mimic physical or biological properties of real biological agents, without being pathogenic. They are used to study the efficiency of various dissemination techniques or the risks caused by the use of biological agents in bioterrorism. To simulate dispersal, attachment or the penetration depth in human or animal lungs, simulants must have particle sizes, specific weight and surface properties, similar to the simulated biological agent.

The typical size of simulants (1–5 μm) enables it to enter buildings with closed windows and doors and penetrate deep into the lungs. This bears a significant health risk, even if the biological agent is normally not pathogenic.
* &quot;Bacillus globigii&quot; (historically named &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; in the context of bio-agent simulants) (BG, BS, or U)
* &quot;Serratia marcescens&quot; (SM or P)
* &quot;Aspergillus fumigatus&quot; mutant C-2 (AF)
* &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; (EC)
* &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot; (BT)
* &quot;Erwinia herbicola&quot; (current accepted name: &quot;Pantoea agglomerans)&quot; (EH)
* Fluorescent particles such as zinc cadmium sulfide, ZnCdS (FP)

== International law ==

While the history of biological weapons use goes back more than six centuries to the siege of Caffa in 1346, international restrictions on biological weapons began only with the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which prohibits the use but not the possession or development of chemical and biological weapons in international armed conflicts. Upon ratification of the Geneva Protocol, several countries made reservations regarding its applicability and use in retaliation. Due to these reservations, it was in practice a &quot;no-first-use&quot; agreement only.

The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention supplements the Geneva Protocol by prohibiting the development, production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling and use of biological weapons. Having entered into force on 26 March 1975, this agreement was the first multilateral disarmament treaty to ban the production of an entire category of weapons of mass destruction. As of March 2021, 183 states have become party to the treaty. The treaty is considered to have established a strong global norm against biological weapons, which is reflected in the treaty&#x27;s preamble, stating that the use of biological weapons would be &quot;repugnant to the conscience of mankind&quot;. However, its effectiveness has been limited due to insufficient institutional support and the absence of any formal verification regime to monitor compliance.

In 1985, the Australia Group was established, a multilateral export control regime of 43 countries aiming to prevent the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons.

In 2004, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1540, which obligates all UN Member States to develop and enforce appropriate legal and regulatory measures against the proliferation of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons and their means of delivery, in particular, to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction to non-state actors.

<text>William &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Langer (September 30, 1886November 8, 1959) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 17th governor of North Dakota from 1932 to 1934 and the 21st governor from 1937 to 1939. His governorship was demarcated by a scandal that forced him out of office and into multiple trials.

Langer was elected to the United States Senate in 1940, serving until he died in office in 1959. As a Senator, he strongly opposed American military involvement in world affairs, being derided by his opponents as an isolationist.

==Early life, education and early career==
Langer was born on September 30, 1886, near Casselton, Dakota Territory, to German-Americans Frank and Mary (Weber) Langer. His Catholic father, Frank Langer, was a member of the first legislature of the state of North Dakota. William, who spoke German fluently, was valedictorian of Casselton High School upon graduation in 1904. He obtained a bachelor of laws from the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks, but was too young upon graduation to practice law. He therefore continued his undergraduate education at Columbia, where he graduated at the top of his class in 1910. Although he was offered a position at a prominent New York law firm, he elected to return to North Dakota, where he practiced law in the town of Mandan before starting his career in politics.

==Personal life==
Langer married Lydia Cady, the daughter of New York architect J. Cleaveland Cady, in 1918, and had four daughters, Emma, Lydia, Mary, and Cornelia (who became a wife of abstract painter Kenneth Noland).

==Career==

In 1914, Langer was appointed state&#x27;s attorney of Morton County and was one of a few non-farmers on the Nonpartisan League (NPL) Republican 1916 state ticket. He was elected state attorney general as the newly formed NPL party swept to victory in the 1916 election, but soon clashed with the party&#x27;s founder and mercurial leader Arthur C. Townley. By 1920, Langer was publicly accusing Townley of Bolshevism, and failed in a primary campaign to replace the incumbent NPL governor Lynn Frazier as the party&#x27;s gubernatorial candidate. Langer&#x27;s break with the NPL leadership was a reflection of the infighting that limited the party&#x27;s eventual influence on North Dakota politics.

===Governor===
Langer eventually mended his rift with the NPL and was elected governor of North Dakota in 1932. As governor, Langer in 1933 required all state employees to donate part of their annual salaries to the NPL and to the &quot;Leader,&quot; a weekly newspaper owned by high-ranking officials in his administration. Collecting this money was not prohibited by state law and was a common, traditional practice. But when donations were made by highway department employees, who were paid through federal relief programs, the U.S. Attorney for North Dakota, P. W. Lanier, charged that the donations constituted a conspiracy to defraud the federal government. Brought to trial in 1934, Langer and five co-conspirators were convicted. The trial was presided over by Judge Andrew Miller and prosecuted by Lanier, two of Langer&#x27;s strongest political opponents in the state.

The first trial was littered with procedural errors that made it invalid on appeal, including improper and rigged jury selection (the jurors were alleged to have had personal bias against Langer and been hand-picked by Lanier) and heavily biased jury instructions.

Because of the felony conviction, the North Dakota Supreme Court on September 19, 1934, ordered Langer removed from office and declared Lieutenant Governor Ole H. Olson the legitimate governor. Langer signed a Declaration of Independence of North Dakota, declared martial law in Bismarck, and barricaded himself in the governor&#x27;s mansion. He eventually relented when his own officers refused to recognize his authority, and Olson served the remainder of Langer&#x27;s term as governor.

In 1935, the convictions were overturned on appeal. The case against Langer was retried twice in 1935. Miller, following a recusal motion by Langer, refused to step down as judge in the first retrial, which resulted in a hung jury. Between the second and third trials, Lanier filed charges against Langer for committing perjury in his recusal motion against Miller. This trial, unprecedented on perjury in an affidavit requesting a recusal, resulted in a directed verdict to acquit Langer. The second retrial of the original charges, presided over by a judge other than Miller, resulted in Langer&#x27;s acquittal.

Throughout the trials, Langer maintained that he was innocent and the victim of a political vendetta by Miller and Lanier. He was reelected governor in 1936. Historian Lawrence Larsen has called Langer &quot;a master of political theater&quot;.

Langer&#x27;s wife, Lydia, ran for governor in 1934 but lost to Democratic candidate Thomas H. Moodie.

===Senate career===
In 1938, Langer ran for the Senate as an independent, and received 42% of the vote, losing to Republican Gerald Nye.

The 1940 Senate election was another very dramatic one. Langer defeated incumbent Lynn Frazier in the Republican primary, and then faced both the Democratic candidate, Charles Joseph Vogel, and Republican/NPL Congressman William Lemke, who declined to run for reelection to Congress in order to run for the Senate as an independent. Langer won the election with 38% of the vote.

Because of the trials mentioned above, Langer&#x27;s qualifications were questioned under Article 1, Section 5 of the Constitution, which declares the U.S. Senate the ultimate judge of its members&#x27; elections, qualifications, and returns. The Senate seated Langer conditionally and began an investigation into his trials. The Committee on Privileges and Elections found Langer guilty of &quot;moral turpitude&quot; and unqualified to be a U.S. senator. The full Senate reversed the committee and voted to seat Langer. The vote to expel Langer failed, then needing 64 votes to reach the two-third majority to pass.

Biographer Glenn H. Smith calls Langer&#x27;s Senate career &quot;A Study in Isolationism, 1940–1959&quot; and emphasizes his close ties with German American and Scandinavian American voters who bitterly remembered the First World War in the Dakotas and deeply distrusted Britain and the United Nations. Like Senator Henrik Shipstead of Minnesota, Langer championed non-interventionism and supported minimizing America&#x27;s involvement in World War II. At home, he concentrated on making life easier for North Dakotan farmers by raising wheat prices and granting government relief. He was also adamant about implementing affordable healthcare for everyone. As a senator, he served on the Post Office, Civil Service and Indian Affairs committees. He and Shipstead were the only senators to vote against the United Nations Charter in 1945. He was also one of seven senators to oppose full U.S. entry into the United Nations.

After African-American organizations asked Langer to propose a bill for the federal government to pay for the repatriation of African-Americans to the African continent, he did so. The bill, S. 1800, failed to pass. Langer was a Zionist who supported the establishment of Israel. During World War II, he had also supported American action to rescue Jewish refugees.

In September 1950, Langer filibustered to prevent the override of President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s veto of the McCarran Internal Security Act for five hours before collapsing.

In 1951, Langer lobbied John J. McCloy, the U.S. High Commissioner for Germany, to grant a reprieve to Martin Sandberger, a high-ranking SS official who had been convicted of crimes against humanity and war crimes for his role in the mass murder of Jews and others in Estonia during the Holocaust. Although sentenced to die by the tribunal of the Einsatzgruppen trial, in no small part due to Langer&#x27;s lobbying, Sandberger&#x27;s sentence was commuted and he served only 13 years in custody. He died in 2010, at the age of 98.

After the Nonpartisan League merged with the state Democratic party, Langer remained on the Republican ticket in the 1958 Senate elections and won without making a single campaign appearance in the state. He voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1957. Langer died in Washington, D.C., on November 8, 1959. He was the last U.S. senator to lie in state in the Senate Chamber until Robert Byrd of West Virginia in 2010.

<text>Mary Hilda Rosamund Honeyball (born 12 November 1952 in Weymouth, Dorset) is a former British Labour Party politician. She was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for London from 2000 to 2019. Seventh on Labour&#x27;s 1999 list, she had not been elected in the 1999 European Parliament election, but replaced Pauline Green, who resigned as an MEP in November 1999. Honeyball was subsequently elected to the European Parliament in 2004, 2009, and 2014. She did not stand for re-election in 2019, and resigned from the Labour Party shortly after voting closed in the UK. Honeyball rejoined the Labour Party during 2021.

==Biography==
Honeyball was educated at Somerville College, Oxford. Before her election to the European Parliament, Honeyball&#x27;s career was in the charitable and non-governmental sector. During the 1980s, she ran the Council for Voluntary Service in the London Borough of Newham, before going on to work as a Senior Manager for Scope, the disability charity. She was later the General Secretary of the Association of Chief Officers of Probation from 1994 to 1998, and prior to that Chief Executive of Gingerbread, the charity for single parent families. She was also a councillor in the London Borough of Barnet from 1978 to 1986. Honeyball unsuccessfully contested Enfield Southgate in 1983 and Norwich North for Labour in 1987.

Honeyball was Chair of the Greater London Labour Party Women&#x27;s Committee during the 1980s and spent three years as Treasurer of Emily&#x27;s List, an organisation that helps pro-choice Labour women campaign for seats in Parliament. Honeyball was the UK Labour representative in the Women&#x27;s Rights and Gender Equality Committee in the European Parliament and served as Vice-Chair of the Committee from 2014 to 2019. She also held the position of Socialist &amp; Democrat group co-ordinator on the Parliament&#x27;s Culture and Education committee. She was also a regular blogger on women&#x27;s rights, religion and politics, and is an honorary associate of the National Secular Society.

When commenting on the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill in May 2008, Honeyball asked whether ministers should be allowed to remain on the front bench of government if they decide to oppose abortion legislation. In the same article, Honeyball also said that Catholicism exercised a &quot;vice-like grip&quot; on the legislative processes over large parts of Continental Europe, blocking women in Ireland and Portugal&#x27;s right to abortion.

On 20 June 2018, Honeyball voted in favour of controversial mechanisms contained in the European Copyright Directive that would require internet companies to make &#x27;best efforts&#x27; to prevent people uploading copyrighted materials, including those contained in internet memes.

Honeyball did not stand in the Labour list for the 2019 European Parliament election, and announced, shortly after voting closed, that she had left the Labour Party, citing the party&#x27;s &quot;disastrous stance on Brexit&quot; and the party&#x27;s failure to act on anti-Semitism within the party. She rejoined the Labour Party in 2021.

Honeyball has described herself as &quot;a humanist&quot;, and has been a regular blogger on women&#x27;s rights, religion, and politics. She is a patron of Humanists UK.

<text>Robert John Emlyn Evans (born 23 October 1956) is a British Labour Co-operative politician who served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1994 until 2009. He was first elected to the European Parliament for London North West, and then in 1999 and 2004 for the London constituency. He has been a Surrey county councillor for the Stanwell and Stanwell Moor ward since 2013.

== Early life and career ==
Robert John Emlyn Evans was born in 1956 in Ashford (at that time in Middlesex, now in Surrey). He was educated at Ashford County Grammar School before gaining a BEd and MA from the Institute of Education, University of London. He then became a teacher and, at the time of his election to the European Parliament, was head of Crane Junior School in Hounslow.

== Political career ==
Evans was elected to the European Parliament for London North West in the 1994 European Parliament election, having previously stood unsuccessfully in 1989. He sat with the Party of European Socialists group and on the European Parliament&#x27;s Committee on Transport and Tourism. His main achievement was to create a new Europe-wide law to outlaw discrimination against disabled passengers when travelling by air. He was a substitute for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, chair of the delegation for relations with the countries of South Asia and was also closely involved with Romania and Moldova. From 1999 to 2004 he was vice-chairman of the Committee on Citizens&#x27; Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. From 2004 to 2007 he was chairman of the European Parliamentary Labour Party.

Evans was an election observer for the European Parliament, and was chair of the mission to observe the Pakistan elections in 2008 and EU Chief Observer to Cambodia in 2003.

Evans announced in November 2008 that he would not be seeking re-election to the European Parliament in 2009. He has since been an independent consultant and freelance advisor to various MPs, MEPs, to CAMS College in Hayes, and with his special expertise in Bangladesh to the charities BRAC, London Tigers and the Brussels-based NGO Shipbreaking. Additionally he is a part-time lecturer at Royal Holloway College, London University.

Evans stood unsuccessfully for Parliament as the Labour Party&#x27;s candidate in East Berkshire in 1987 and Uxbridge in 1992, and later in the 2003 Brent East by-election. Brent East was previously a safe seat for the Labour Party, and had once been held by Ken Livingstone, but Evans lost to the Liberal Democrat candidate Sarah Teather.

Evans was awarded an honorary doctorate by Brunel University London in 1998.

Evans is a Vice President of the League Against Cruel Sports, a trustee of BRAC-UK, and of the Brussels-based South Asian charity, NGO Shipbreaking Platform. He is a Life Member of Ashford Cricket Club, Cambridge University Cricket Club, and a long-standing member of Ashford Middlesex Hockey Club, MCC and Middlesex County Cricket Club.

In November 2012, Evans was Labour&#x27;s candidate for Police and Crime Commissioner in Surrey. On 2 May 2013, he was elected Surrey County Councillor for the Stanwell and Stanwell Moor ward.

As a Surrey county councillor, Evans has campaigned in favour of public services, particularly the retention of his local fire station, Staines Fire Station in Stanwell. He campaigned against a third runway at Heathrow Airport and in favour of the airport being &quot;better not bigger&quot;. In May 2014, Evans proposed a successful vote to achieve Fairtrade status for Surrey – the first county in the south of England to do so. The change was opposed by the Conservative leader of many years&#x27; standing. Despite being a lone Labour councillor, Evans has achieved a string of successes at County Council level, including persuading Surrey to oppose a return to grammar schools, to acknowledge and congratulate Sadiq Khan on being elected in 2016 as Mayor of London and to adopt the Co-operative Party charter against modern slavery. He was profiled by the political journalist Richard Heller on politics.co.uk, Evans was re-elected to his council seat in May 2017 with an 11% increase in his vote, on what was otherwise a disappointing night for Labour. He was again comfortably re-elected with an increased vote in 2021.

During the lockdown period from 2020 to 2022, Evans studied part-time for an MSc in South Asian politics at SOAS, University of London. He was awarded his degree with merit.

Evans was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2023 New Year Honours for political and public service.

== Personal life ==
Evans speaks French and Spanish, and is learning Bengali.
