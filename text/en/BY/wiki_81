<text>In 1945 Albert Lasker and Mary Woodard Lasker created the Lasker Awards. Every year since then the award has been given to the living person considered to have made the greatest contribution to medical science or who has demonstrated public service on behalf of medicine. They are administered by the Lasker Foundation. The Lasker is sometimes referred to as &quot;America&#x27;s Nobels&quot;.

The Lasker Awards have gained a reputation for identifying future winners of the Nobel Prize. Eighty-six Lasker laureates have received the Nobel Prize, including 32 in the last two decades. Claire Pomeroy is the current president of the Lasker Foundation.

==Award==
The award is given in four branches of medical science:

# Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award
# Lasker–DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award
# Lasker–Bloomberg Public Service Award (Renamed in 2011 from Mary Woodard Lasker Public Service Award. Renamed in 2000 from Albert Lasker Public Service Award.)
# &quot;Lasker–Koshland Special Achievement Award in Medical Science (1994– renamed to that name in 2008)&quot; (optional)
The awards carry an honorarium of $250,000 for each category.

A collection of papers from the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation were donated to the National Library of Medicine by Mrs. Albert D. Lasker in April 1985.

In addition to the main awards, there are historical awards that are no longer awarded.

<doc id="717084" wikidata="Q2179433" url="?curid=717084" title="Eric Peterson">
<text>Eric Neal Peterson (born October 2, 1946) is a Canadian stage, television, and film actor, known for his roles in three major Canadian television series – &quot;Street Legal&quot; (1987–1994), &quot;Corner Gas&quot; (live-action 2004–2009 and film 2014, animated 2018–2021), and &quot;This is Wonderland&quot; (2004–2006).

==Career==

===Stage===
In 1971, Peterson began his acting career when he helped found the collective theatre company &quot;Tamahnous Theatre&quot; in Vancouver, British Columbia. There he received major roles in versions of &quot;The Bacchae&quot; and &quot;Nijinsky&quot;, both directed by John Gray.

In 1974, he moved to Toronto, Ontario, and joined Theatre Passe Muraille, a leading collective ensemble in Canada. He had main roles in productions of &quot;The Farm Show&quot;, &quot;The West Show&quot;, &quot;Them Donnelly’s&quot;, and &quot;1837: The Farmers&#x27; Revolt&quot;. It was in this latter Rick Salutin production that he gained the greatest recognition, playing William Lyon Mackenzie and Lady Backwash.

In 1976, Peterson began to collaborate with John Gray again, writing &quot;Billy Bishop Goes to War&quot;. The play, which premiered in Vancouver in 1978, went on tour internationally, garnering positive reviews on Broadway, where Peterson won the Clarence Derwent Award for most promising performer, in London&#x27;s West End. He was also nominated for Best Actor at the Edinburgh Festival Mainstage. In 1998, Peterson acted in the play once more at the Canadian Stage in Toronto.

Peterson&#x27;s later stage appearances include &quot;Love and Anger&quot; at the Factory Theatre, &quot;Health&quot; (another collaboration with John Gray) at the Vancouver Playhouse and the lead role in &quot;Richard Ill&quot; at the &quot;Young People’s Theatre&quot;. In October 2000, he performed in &quot;Hysteria&quot; at the Canadian Stage and in January 2001, he appeared in &quot;Clout&quot; at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa.

Between November 20 and December 13, 2008, Peterson starred as family patriarch and business man Helge Klingenfeldt in The Company Theatre&#x27;s production of Festen at the Berkeley Street Theatre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Between August 8 and 29, 2009, Peterson reprised the lead role in &quot;Billy Bishop Goes to War&quot; at the Soulpepper Theatre Company in Toronto. The company announced that the production was planned to return in 2010. In the same year, he played Wiff Roach in Soulpepper&#x27;s revival of David French&#x27;s 1973 play &quot;Of the Fields, Lately&quot;.

In the early to mid 2010s he played the role of Percy Schmeiser in the docu-drama play &quot;Seeds&quot;.

===Television===
Until &quot;Corner Gas&quot;, his most famous role on television was his award-winning role as Leon Robinovitch, a left-wing lawyer, on &quot;Street Legal&quot;. His more notable television work includes 1998&#x27;s &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot; (a movie for which he also co-produced and appeared in the stage version), &quot;Night Heat&quot; and &quot;This Is Wonderland&quot;. He also appeared as Hank Stewart in the &quot;Hippocratic Oath&quot; episode of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; for AHF Film Productions.

In total, Peterson has appeared in fifty-two movie and television productions. He also appeared in an infomercial for Amnesty International. He also appeared in the Goosebumps episode &quot;Shocker on Shock Street&quot; as Mr. Wright

Peterson&#x27;s most famous television role was that of Oscar Leroy on the Canadian television program &quot;Corner Gas&quot;. Peterson played the father of Brent Leroy (played by Brent Butt), who inherited the gas station after his father decided to retire. Much to the dismay of his son and his wife Emma (played by Janet Wright), he uses his new-found free time to unwittingly annoy his family and the town at large. Following the end of that show&#x27;s run, Peterson made a guest appearance on the show &quot;Dan for Mayor&quot;, a show starring his former &quot;Corner Gas&quot; co-star Fred Ewanuick. As of 2014 he appears in &quot;The Best Laid Plans&quot; as Jerry Stockton.

Since January 2007, he has been performing in &quot;Half Life&quot;, a play by John Mighton, at the Canadian Stage. According to The Canadian Encyclopedia, &quot;his fresh, energetic, natural acting style has made him popular with Canadian audiences, and he continues to be a mainstay of Canadian television.&quot;

==Personal life==
Peterson was born in Indian Head, Saskatchewan, Canada. He is married to fellow actor and &quot;People for Education&quot; executive director Annie Kidder, who is the sister of Margot Kidder. Peterson and his wife live in Toronto, Ontario, with their two daughters, although he still frequents his home province of Saskatchewan, where he owns a cottage on Katepwa Lake in the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley near his hometown.

===Awards===
Peterson has won numerous awards over his career. For his portrayal of Leon Robinovitch on &quot;Street Legal&quot;, he was nominated for the Gemini Award for Best Performance by a Lead Actor in a Continuing Dramatic Role six times: in 1987, 1989, and every year from 1992 through 1995. He tied for the win with Winston Rekert (for &quot;Adderly&quot;) the first year, and won the next two outright. He has also been nominated twice under Best Ensemble Performance in a Comedy Program or Series with &quot;Corner Gas&quot; at the Gemini Awards, and once for Best Performance by an Actor in a Featured Supporting Role in a Dramatic Series for Episode 4 of &quot;This is Wonderland&quot; for his portrayal of Judge Malone. His fourth Gemini Award came in 2001 for Best Performance in a Pre-School Program.

He has also been nominated four times for Canadian Comedy Awards for his role on &quot;Corner Gas&quot;.

<doc id="717088" wikidata="Q289577" url="?curid=717088" title="Himyar">
<text>Himyar was a polity in the southern highlands of Yemen, as well as the name of the region which it claimed. Until 110 BCE, it was integrated into the Qatabanian kingdom, afterwards being recognized as an independent kingdom. According to classical sources, their capital was the ancient city of Zafar, relatively near the modern-day city of Sana&#x27;a. Himyarite power eventually shifted to Sana&#x27;a as the population increased in the fifth century. After the establishment of their kingdom, it was ruled by kings from dhū-Raydān tribe. The kingdom was named Raydān.

The kingdom conquered neighbouring Saba&#x27; in c. 25 BCE (for the first time), Qataban in c. 200 CE, and Haḍramaut c. 300 CE. Its political fortunes relative to Saba&#x27; changed frequently until it finally conquered the Sabaean Kingdom around 280. With successive invasion and Arabization, the kingdom collapsed in the early sixth century, as the Kingdom of Aksum conquered it in 530 CE.

The Himyarites originally worshiped most of the South-Arabian pantheon, including Wadd, ʿAthtar, &#x27;Amm and Almaqah. Since at least the reign of Malkikarib Yuhamin (c. 375–400 CE), Judaism was adopted as the &quot;de facto&quot; state religion. The religion may have been adopted to some extent as much as two centuries earlier, but inscriptions to polytheistic deities ceased after this date. It was embraced initially by the upper classes, and possibly a large proportion of the general population over time. Native Christian kings ruled Himyar in 500 CE until 521–522 CE as well, Christianity itself became the main religion after the Aksumite conquest in 530 CE.

Descendants of the Himyarites, namely the aristocratic families of Dhu&#x27;l-Kala and Dhu Asbah, played a prominent role in early Islamic Syria. They led the South Arabian contingents of the Muslim army during the conquest of Homs in 638 and contributed to making Homs a center for South Arabian settlement, culture and political power. Their chiefs supported Mu&#x27;awiya ibn Abi Sufyan against Caliph Ali in the First Muslim Civil War (656–661). Their influence waned with their defeat at the Battle of Marj Rahit against the Quda&#x27;a confederation and the Umayyad caliph Marwan I in 684 and practically diminished with the death of their leader at the Battle of Khazir in 686. Nonetheless, members of the Dhu&#x27;l-Kala and Dhu Asbah played important roles at different times through the remainder of Umayyad rule (661–750) as governors, commanders, scholars, and pietists.

== History ==

The Himyarite Kingdom was a confederation of tribes, several inscriptions and monumental buildings survive of this period which shows evidence of a wealthy, sophisticated, relatively literate society that had a rich variety of local gods and religions. Trade was already well established by the 3rd century AD, with Yemen supplying the Roman Empire with frankincense and myrrh. Further, the late 1st century AD writer Pliny the Elder mentioned that the kingdom was one of &quot;the richest nations in the world&quot;. It was a hub of international trade, linking the Mediterranean, the Middle East and India.

The trade linking East Africa with the Mediterranean world largely consisted of exporting ivory from Africa to be sold in the Roman Empire. Ships from Ḥimyar regularly travelled the East African coast, and the state also exerted a large amount of influence both cultural, religious and political over the trading cities of East Africa whilst the cities of East Africa remained independent. The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea describes the trading empire of Himyar and its ruler &quot;Charibael&quot; (probably Karab&#x27;il Watar Yuhan&#x27;emII), who is said to have been on friendly terms with Rome:

=== Early period ===

During this period, the Kingdom of Ḥimyar conquered the kingdoms of Saba&#x27; and Qataban and took Raydan/Zafar for its capital instead of Ma&#x27;rib; therefore, they have been called Dhu Raydan (). In the early 2nd century AD Saba&#x27; and Qataban split from the Kingdom of Ḥimyar; yet in a few decades Qataban was conquered by Hadhramaut (conquered in its turn by Ḥimyar in the 4th century), whereas Saba&#x27; was finally conquered by Ḥimyar in the late 3rd century.
Ẓafār&#x27;s ruins cover scattered over 120 hectare on Mudawwar Mountain 10 km north-north-west of the town of Yarim. Early, Empire and Late/Post art periods have been identified. Around the same time in the north a Himyar General by the name of Nuh Ifriqis led an expedition to Barbaria and took control of eastern ports in modern-day Djibouti. Other Himyarite generals went as far as invading Rhapta in modern-day Mozambique.

By the 4th century, the rich Himyarite export of incense, which had once supplied pagan Rome in its religious offerings, now began to wane with the Christianization of Rome, contributing to a collapse in the local economy.

=== Jewish monarchy===
==== Conversion ====
By 300, the Himyarite Kingdom had vanquished other political units (including the Saba, Qataban, and Hadrawat kingdoms) and became the ruling power of southern Arabia, uniting the region for the first time. In the mid- to late-fourth century, Himyar or at least its ruling class had adopted Judaism, having transitioned from a polytheistic practice. These events are chronicled by the Book of the Himyarites and the fifth-century &quot;Ecclessiastical History&quot; of the Anomean Philostorgius. Such sources implicate the motive for conversion as a wish on the part of the Himyarite rulers to distance themselves from the Byzantine Empire which had tried to convert them to Christianity. This also took place several decades after the Kingdom of Aksum converted to Christianity in 328. No changes occurred in the people&#x27;s script, calendar, or language (unlike at Aksum after its conversion). The conversion from polytheism and the institutionalization of Judaism as the official religion is credited in these sources to Malkīkarib Yuha’min (r. c. 375–400). According to traditional Islamic sources, the conversion took place under his son, Abu Karib (r. c. 400–445). It is in the mid-fourth century that inscriptions suddenly transition from polytheistic invocations to ones mentioning the high god Rahmanan, &quot;the Lord of Heaven&quot; or &quot;Lord of Heaven and Earth&quot;. A Sabaic inscription dating to this time, titled Ja 856 (or Fa 60) describes the replacement of a polytheistic temple dedicated to the god Almaqah with a &quot;mikrāb&quot; (which might be the equivalent of a synagogue or an original form of organization local to Himyarite Judaism). The evidence suggests a sharp break with polytheism, coinciding with the sudden appearance of Jewish and Aramaic words (‘&quot;ālam&quot;/world, &quot;baraka&quot;/bless, &quot;haymanōt&quot;/guarantee, &quot;kanīsat&quot;/meeting hall) and personal names (Yṣḥq/Isaac, Yhwd’/Juda), Yws’f/Joseph). Nevertheless, the nature of the Judaism practiced by the rulers is not clear and the Jewish nature of the kings rule was not frequently made explicit.

==== Conversion of king Abu Karib to Judaism ====
According to Arabian legends and folklore, king Abu Karib (r. 390–420) was the first Jewish convert. His conversion is thought to have followed a military expedition into northern Arabia in an effort to eliminate Byzantine influence, who had sought to expand their influence in the peninsula. He reached and seized Yathrib (Medina) and there installed his son as governor. Later, he would learn that his son was killed, and so he returned to besiege the city, during which the Jewish population fought against him. Abu Karib fell ill during the siege, but two Jewish scholars named Ka&#x27;b and As&#x27;ad were able to restore him to health. They also convinced him to lift the siege and make peace; afterwards, he and his army converted. When he returned home, he brought the scholars back with him into the capital, where he was able to convince the population to also convert. After his eventual death, it was reported that a pagan, Dhū-Shanatir, seized the throne as his children he left to rule were all still minors.

Historically, however, Judaism itself was introduced during the reign of Malkikarib Yuhamin, the father of Abu Karib.

==== The rise of Dhu Nuwas and the persecution of Christians in the Himyarite realms ====
In 470, the Himyarite king Sharhabil Yakkuf ordered the execution of a Christian priest named Azqir for erecting a chapel with a cross in the city of Najran.

By the year 500, during the rule of the Jewish monarch Marthad&#x27;ilan Yu&#x27;nim (c. 400–502) the kingdom of Himyar exercised control over much of the Arabian peninsula. It was around this time that the Kingdom of Aksum invaded the peninsula, overthrowing the Himyarite king and installing in his place the native Christian king, Ma&#x27;dikarib Ya&#x27;fur. A Himyarite prince and hardline follower of Judaism, Dhu Nuwas (who had attempted to overthrow the dynasty several years earlier), took power after Ma&#x27;dikarib Ya&#x27;fur had died via a coup d&#x27;état, assuming authority after killing the Aksumite garrison in Zafār. He proceeded to engage the Ethiopian guards, and their Christian allies in the Tihāma coastal lowlands facing Abyssinia. After taking the port of Mukhawān, where he burnt down the local church, he advanced south as far as the fortress of Maddabān overlooking the Bab-el-Mandeb, where he expected Kaleb Ella Aṣbeḥa to land his fleet. The campaign eventually killed between 11,500 and 14,000, and took a similar number of prisoners. Mukhawān became his base, while he dispatched one of his generals, a Jewish prince named Sharaḥ&#x27;īl Yaqbul dhu Yaz&#x27;an, against Najrān, a predominantly Christian oasis, with a good number of Jews, who had supported with troops his earlier rebellion, but refused to recognize his authority after the massacre of the Aksumite garrison. The general blocked the caravan route connecting Najrān with Eastern Arabia.

==== The end of Jewish rule over Himyar ====
Dhu Nuwas went on to try combatting the Christianizing influence from the Kingdom of Aksum militarily and massacred the Christian community of Najran, which is in part documented by an inscription made by Sarah&#x27;il Yaqbul-Yaz&#x27;an, Ja 1028, which describes the burning of a church and slaughtering of Abyssinians (Ethiopian Christians), claiming thousands of deaths and prisoners. These events are also discussed in several contemporary Christian sources: in the writings of Procopius, Cosmas Indicopleustes, John Malalas, and Jacob of Serugh. Soon afterwards, John of Ephesus (d. 588) related a letter from another contemporary, Mar Simeon, directed to Abbot von Gabula about the events. In addition, an anonymous author produced the Book of the Himyarites, a sixth-century Syriac chronicle of the persecution and martyrdom of the Christians of Najran. This event to a significant counterattack by the Ethiopian kingdom, leading to the conquest of Himyar in 525–530 and the ultimate defeat and deposition of Dhu Nuwas. This signified the end of the Jewish leadership of southern Arabia, and Kaleb appointed a Christian Himyarite, Sumyafa Ashwa, as his viceroy and vassal ruler of Himyar.

==== Aksumite-Sasanian Wars and the Sasanian conquest of Yemen ====
The Aksumite general, Abraha, eventually deposed Sumyafa Ashwa and took power, becoming the new ruler of Himyar.
After Abraha&#x27;s death, his son Masruq ibn Abraha continued the Aksumite vice-royalty in Yemen, resuming payment of tribute to the Aksumites. However, his maternal brother Ma&#x27;adi Yakrib revolted.

After being denied by Justinian, Ma&#x27;adi Yakrib sought help from Khosrow I, the Sassanid Persian Emperor, thus triggering the Aksumite–Persian wars. Khosrow I sent a small fleet and army under Persian military commander Wahrez to depose the king of Yemen. The war culminated with the Siege of Sana&#x27;a, capital of Aksumite Yemen. Following the capture of Sanaʽa by Sasanian forces, Wahrez placed Ma&#x27;adi Yakrib on the throne of Himyar as a vassal of the Sasanian Persian Empire.

In 575 or 578, the war resumed again, after Ma&#x27;adi Yakrib was killed by Aksumite servants. Wahrez led another army of 8000, ending Axumite overlordship on Yemen. Subsequently, Yemen was annexed by the Sasanian Empire as a province, and Wahrez was installed as its direct governor by the Sasanian emperor Khosrow I. Greater Yemen remained under firm Sasanian control until the rise of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in the early 7th century.

==Religion==

=== Polytheistic period ===
There is evidence prior to the fourth century that the solar goddess Shams was especially favoured in Himyar, being the national goddess and possibly an ancestral deity.

=== Jewish period ===

During the fourth century onwards after the Himyarite kingdom (or at least its ruling class) converted to Judaism, or a Jewish-inflected monotheism, references to pagan gods disappeared from royal inscriptions and texts on public buildings, and were replaced by references to a single deity in official texts. Inscriptions in the Sabean language, and sometimes Hebrew, called this deity &quot;Rahmanan&quot; (&quot;The Merciful&quot;), “Lord of the Heavens and Earth,” the “God of Israel” and “Lord of the Jews”. Prayers invoking Rahman&#x27;s blessings on the “people of Israel” in monumental inscriptions often ended with the Hebrew words &quot;shalom&quot; and &quot;amen&quot;.

There is scanter material regarding the religious affiliations of the locals. All inscriptions are monotheistic, but the religious identity of their authors is not always explicit. However, there is evidence for the practice of Judaism among locals as well. The name &quot;Israel&quot; appears in four inscriptions and replaces the earlier term shaʿb/community: one inscription from the fifth century mentions the &quot;God of Israel&quot;. Three inscriptions mention the &quot;God of the Jews&quot;. MAFRAY-Ḥaṣī 1, describes the construction of a graveyard specifically for the Jewish community. There is a Hebrew inscription known as DJE 23 from the village of Bayt Hadir, 15 km east of Sanaa. It lists the &quot;mishmarot&quot; (&quot;guards&quot;), enumerating the twenty-four Priestly families (and their place of residence in Galilee) appointed to protect the Solomon&#x27;s Temple after the return of the Jews following the Babylonian exile. It is also written in biblical as opposed to Aramaic orthography. Mentions of synagogues, indicating the formal organization of Jews in Southern Arabia, are present in a fourth-century Sabaic inscription and a late sixth century Greek inscription from the port of Qāniʾ which uses the phrase &quot;eis Theos&quot; to refer to God and mentions a &quot;hagios topos&quot;, a phrase typically connoting a synagogue. Additional evidence is also known.

Christian Julien Robin argues that the epigraphic evidence argues against viewing the Judaism of Himyar as rabbinic. This is based on the absence of belief in the afterlife (shared by the Sadducees), the predominant use of a local language (Sabaic) as opposed to Hebrew, and the priestly emphasis of DJE 23, Himyarite Judaism may have been more &quot;Priestly&quot; than &quot;Rabbinic&quot;. However, Iwona Gajda interprets DJE 23 as evidence for the presence of rabbinic Judaism, and further points to evidence that the loanwords present in Ḥasī 1 indicate that its author was strongly familiar with Jewish law.

Unfortunately, Jewish literary texts outside of Yemen do not discuss the Jewish community there. However, epigraphs from Palestine and Jordan do reflect communication and knowledge from the Yemenite Jewish community:

* An inscription from Palestine using the Sabaic script (a South Arabian script) is known.
* A Greek inscription from the village of Beit She&#x27;arim mentions the burial of a &quot;Himyarite&quot;.
* A fifth-century Hebrew epitaph from Zoara, Jordan describes an individual named Ywsh br ʾWfy who &quot;died in Ẓafār, the land of the Ḥimyarites&quot;.

These communication routes may have also transferred rabbinic and other Jewish teachings.

=== Christian period ===

During the Ethiopian Christian period, Christianity appears to have become the official religion. Many churches began to be built. For example, the inscription RIÉ 191, discovered in Axum, describes the construction of a church off the coast of Yemen. The Marib Dam inscription from 548 mentions a priest, a monastery, and an abbot of that monastery. As in the Himyarite period, Christian inscriptions continue to refer to the monotheistic deity using the name Rahmanan, but now these inscriptions are accompanied with crosses and references to Christ as the Messiah and the Holy Spirit. For example, one (damaged) inscription, as for example in Ist 7608 bis. Another extensive inscription, CIH 541, documents Abraha sponsoring the construction of a church at Marib, besides invoking/mentioning the Messiah, Spirit, and celebrations hosted by a priest at another church. Abraha celebrated the construction of the dam by holding mass in the city church and inviting ambassadors from Rome and Persia. Later Islamic historiography also ascribes to Abraha the construction of a church at Sanaa. Abraha&#x27;s inscriptions bear a relatively low Christology, perhaps meant to assuage the Jewish population, and their formulae resemble descriptions of Jesus in the Quran. (The Jabal Dabub inscription is another South Arabian Christian graffito dating to the sixth century and containing a pre-Islamic variant of the Basmala.) Whereas Abraha&#x27;s predecessor more explicitly denoted Jesus as the Son of Rahmanan and as &quot;Victor&quot; (corresponding to Aksumite description under Kaleb of Axum), and made use of Trinitarian formulae, Abraha began to only describe Jesus as God&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; (but not Son) and, in aligning himself more closely with Syriac Christianity, replaced Aksumite Christian with Syriac loanwords. The use of the phrase &quot;Rahmanan and his son Christ the conqueror&quot; in inscriptions from this time owes to the use of the Syriac loanword Masīḥ. More broadly, the separation of Abraha&#x27;s Himyar from the Akumsite kingdom corresponded to its greater alignment with the Christianity espoused in Antioch and Syria. Inscriptions from this region disappear after 560. Abraha&#x27;s influence would end up extending across the regions he conquered, including regions of eastern Arabia, central Arabia, Medina in the Hejaz, and an unidentified site called Gzm.

== Military ==
As the Byzantines were usually equipped with armored horses, Indian fenestrated battle axe, round shield, spear, and scale or mail armor, Paul Yule argued that the Himyarite soldiers were armed in comparable fashion, if not as consistently.

==Language==
It is a matter of debate whether the Ṣayhadic Himyarite language was spoken in the south-western Arabian peninsula until the 10th century. The few &#x27;Himyarite&#x27; texts seem to be rhymed.

==List of rulers==
==Himyarite dynasties after the coming of Islam==

After the spread of Islam in Yemen, Himyarite noble families were able to re-establish control over parts of Yemen.
* Yufirid Dynasty over most of Yemen (847–997)
* Mahdid Dynasty over Southern Tihama (1159–1174)
* Manakhis over Taiz (ninth century)

Many Himyarites participated in the Muslim conquest of Syria in the 630s and, along with other South Arabian tribes, settled in city of Homs after its capture in 637. The city became the center of these tribes in Islamic Syria, which served as the center of the Caliphate during Umayyad rule (661–750). The two principal Himyarite families that established themselves in Homs were the Dhu Asbah and Dhu&#x27;l-Kala. The latter had been the most influential family in South Arabia before the advent of Islam there.

Among the leaders of the conquering Muslim troops was the Himyarite prince Samayfa ibn Nakur of the Dhu&#x27;l-Kala. The Asbah chief Kurayb ibn Abraha Abu Rishdin led the Himyar of Homs, but he later moved to Egypt with most of the Dhu Asbah. Members of that family, Abraha ibn Sabbah and his son Abu Shamir, had participated in the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 640–641. Samayfa was another dominant figure of the city and was referred to in the early Muslim sources as the &quot;king of Himyar&quot;. During the governorship of Syria by Mu&#x27;awiya ibn Abi Sufyan (640s–661), the Himyarites supported him against Caliph Ali () during the First Muslim Civil War. At the Battle of Siffin with Ali in 657, Samayfa led the Homs contingent in Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s army and was slain. He was succeeded by his son Shurahbil as the power-broker of the Homs tribesmen.

According to the historian Werner Caskel, the Himyar and the other South Arabian tribes of Homs, including the Hamdan, formed a confederation called after their supposed ancestor Qahtan in opposition to the Quda&#x27;a confederation, whose constituent tribes had long resided in Syria before the advent of Islam. To the chagrin of the South Arabians in Homs and the Qays tribes of northern Syria, the Quda&#x27;a, led by the Banu Kalb tribe, held the supreme position among the tribal groups in the courts of the first Umayyad caliphs Mu&#x27;awiya ibn Abi Sufyan () and Yazid I (). With the strong presence of the Himyarite elite and South Arabian tribesmen in Homs, their scholars there developed and propagated an ideology of Qahtanite preeminence that sought to compete with the elite groups of Islam, including the Quraysh, whose members held the office of the caliph. To that end, they composed and transmitted narratives of the pre-Islamic South Arabian kingdoms, including war stories of these kings&#x27; far-flung conquests and heroics and tales of their wealth.

After the deaths of Yazid I and his son and successor Mu&#x27;awiya II in 683 and 684, respectively, the Qahtan and the Qays backed the rival caliphate of Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, who was based in Mecca, while the Quda&#x27;a supported the candidacy of the Umayyad Marwan I. Kurayb ibn Abraha also backed Ibn al-Zubayr in Egypt. The Qahtan joined Ibn al-Zubayr&#x27;s representative in Syria, Dahhak ibn Qays al-Fihri, in the Battle of Marj Rahit against Marwan and the Quda&#x27;a in 684. The latter decisively won that battle. Afterward, Dahhak&#x27;s commander in Homs, Nu&#x27;man ibn Bashir al-Ansari, was tracked down and killed by the Dhu&#x27;l-Kala. A member of the family who had served as the head of Yazid I&#x27;s &quot;shurta&quot; (select troops), Khalid ibn Ma&#x27;dan ibn Abi Karib, decapitated Nu&#x27;man and sent his head to Marwan I. Not long after Marj Rahit, Qahtan and Quda&#x27;a reconciled under unclear circumstances and formed the super-tribal group of the Yaman in alliance against the Qays. The resulting Qays–Yaman rivalry for political power and privilege persisted through the remainder of Umayyad rule.

In 686 Shurahbil ibn Dhi&#x27;l-Kala, the leader of the Himyar in Syria, was slain commanding his troops in the Umayyad army at the Battle of Khazir. As a consequence, the Himyar in Homs &quot;sank to military insignificance&quot;, according to the historian Wilferd Madelung. Khalid ibn Ma&#x27;dan maintained his position of prestige with the Umayyad dynasty and Syrian Muslim society in general, having shifted to a new role as a prominent Muslim scholar. Kurayb&#x27;s cousin Ayyub ibn Shurahbil ibn Sabbah served as the governor of Egypt under Caliph Umar II (), while a Dhu&#x27;l-Kala member, Imran ibn al-Nu&#x27;man, served as the Caliph&#x27;s governor of Sind.

During the Third Muslim Civil War, the Dhu Asbah tribesmen who had remained in South Arabia are recorded among the supporters of the Kharijite leader Abu Hamza. A possible member of the family in Syria, Nadr ibn Yarim, led a summertime military expedition against the Byzantines under the Abbasid caliph al-Saffah ().

==Ancestral divisions of Himyar==

*Himyar: The most famous of whose septs were Zaid Al-Jamhur, Banu Quda&#x27;a and Sakasik.
*Kahlan: The most famous of whose septs were Hamdan, Azd, Anmar, Ṭayy (today their descendants are known as Shammar), Midhhij, Kinda, Lakhm, Judham
Kahlan septs emigrated from Yemen to dwell in the different parts of the Arabian Peninsula prior to the Great Flood (Sail Al-‘Arim of Marib Dam), due to the failure of trade under the Roman pressure and domain on both sea and land trade routes following Roman occupation of Egypt and Syria.

Naturally enough, the competition between Kahlan and Ḥimyar led to the evacuation of the first and the settlement of the second in Yemen.

The emigrating septs of Kahlan can be divided into four groups:

*Azd: Who, under the leadership of ‘Imrān bin ‘Amr Muzaiqbā’, wandered in Yemen, sent pioneers and finally headed northwards. Details of their emigration can be summed up as follows:
**Tha‘labah bin ‘Amr left his tribe Al-Azd for Ḥijāz and dwelt between Tha‘labiyah and Dhī Qār. When he gained strength, he headed for Madīnah where he stayed. Of his seed are Aws and Khazraj, sons of Haritha bin Tha‘labah.
**Haritha bin ‘Amr, known as Khuzā‘ah, wandered with his people in Hijaz until they came to Mar Az-Zahran. They conquered the Ḥaram, and settled in Makkah after having driven away its people, the tribe of Jurhum.
**‘Imrān bin ‘Amr and his folks went to ‘Oman where they established the tribe of Azd whose children inhabited Tihama and were known as Azd-of-Shanu’a.
**Jafna bin ‘Amr and his family, headed for Syria where he settled and initiated the kingdom of Ghassan who was so named after a spring of water, in Ḥijāz, where they stopped on their way to Syria.
*Lakhm and Judham: Of whom was Nasr bin Rabi‘a, father of Manadhira, Kings of al-Hirah.
*Banū Ṭayy: Who also emigrated northwards to settle by the so- called Aja and Salma Mountains which were consequently named as Tai’ Mountains. The tribe later became the tribe of Shammar.
*Kinda: Who dwelt in Bahrain but were expelled to Hadramout and Najd where they instituted a powerful government but not for long, for the whole tribe soon faded away.

Another tribe of Himyar, known as Banū Quḑā&#x27;ah, also left Yemen and dwelt in Samāwah on the borders of Iraq.

However, it is estimated that the majority of the Ḥimyar Christian royalty migrated into Jordan, Al-Karak, where initially they were known as Banū Ḥimyar (Sons of Ḥimyar). Many later on moved to central Jordan

<text>Mutual Street Arena, initially called Arena Gardens or just the Arena, was an ice hockey arena and sports and entertainment venue in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. From 1912 until 1931, with the opening of Maple Leaf Gardens, it was the premier site of ice hockey in Toronto, being home to teams from the National Hockey Association (NHA), the National Hockey League (NHL), the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) and the International Hockey League (IHL). It was the first home of the Toronto Maple Leafs, who played at the arena under various names for their first 13½ seasons. The Arena Gardens was the third rink in Canada to feature a mechanically frozen or &#x27;artificial&#x27; ice surface (Shea&#x27;s Amphitheatre opened in 1909 and Patrick Arena opened in 1911), and for eleven years was the only such facility in eastern Canada. In 1923, it was the site of the first radio broadcast of an ice hockey game, the first radio broadcast of an NHL game, and the first broadcast of an ice hockey game by long-time broadcaster Foster Hewitt.

The Arena was also used for musical concerts, gatherings, and other sporting events, including professional boxing, cycling, wrestling, and tennis. In 1962, it was converted into a curling club and roller skating rink known as The Terrace. The building was demolished in 1989 and the &quot;Cathedral Square&quot; residential complex and &quot;Arena Gardens&quot; municipal park now occupy the site. It was located on Mutual Street, just south of Dundas Street East and two blocks east of Church Street in downtown Toronto.

==History==
It was constructed for a reported cost of and opened in 1912. It was built on the site of the Mutual Street Rink, used primarily for curling and ice skating between Dundas Street East and Shuter Street. At the time, it was billed as the largest indoor arena in Canada and held about 7,500 for hockey. The rink was owned by the Toronto Arena Company, organized September 19, 1911, with Sir Henry Pellatt as president, Lol Solman as managing director, and directors Aemilius Jarvis, Joseph Kilgour, T.W. Horn, R.A. Smith, and Col. Carlson. There were two other directors from Montreal. W. J. Bellingham was the initial manager.

The Arena opened with a performance by Nathan Franko&#x27;s Orchestra on October 7, 1912, supporting a recital by Alice Neville, soprano of the Metropolitan Opera, tenor Orville Harold, and a company of opera singers from the Boston Opera Company organized by Neville. It was the first of a series called the &quot;Toronto Music Festival.&quot; Entrances to the various blue and red seating sections were indicated by corresponding blue and red lights on the outside of the building. It was followed the next day by a recital by Johanna Gadski with Franko&#x27;s orchestra. The festival continued all week, concluding on October 12 with a variety show headlined by Canadian theatre and film actress Marie Dressler. Americans Yvonne de Tréville, Charlotte Maconda and Rosa Olitzka sang arias from several operas while Dressler performed a comedic reading of the poem &quot;The Glove&quot; by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, singing &quot;burlesque opera solos&quot; to the accompaniment of Nathan Franko&#x27;s Orchestra.
Arena Gardens was initially home to two new teams in the National Hockey Association (NHA): the Toronto Hockey Club and the Tecumseh Hockey Club. Delays in construction meant that the teams could not play in the 1911–12 season, as was originally scheduled. The of piping for the artificial ice was installed improperly and had to be reinstalled in December 1912. The first professional ice hockey game in the building was on December 21, 1912, an exhibition between the Montreal Canadiens and Montreal Wanderers. Sprague Cleghorn was suspended for four weeks and fined $65 by the NHA for assaulting the Canadiens&#x27; Newsy Lalonde in the game. The first official game was on December 25, 1912, a game between the Canadiens and the Torontos. Upon the suspension of the NHA in 1917, the professional franchise of the new National Hockey League (NHL) for Toronto was operated by the Toronto Arena itself. The franchise was operated by the Arena for two years before being sold to become the Toronto St. Patricks. The St. Pats became the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1927 and played at Arena Gardens until the completion of Maple Leaf Gardens in 1931. Until 1923, the Arena was the only facility east of Manitoba with artificial ice-making capability. With this in mind, the St. Pats often let other teams use the Arena as a neutral site during the early and late months of the season when it was usually too warm for proper ice.

The year 1922 saw the first professional wrestling bout at the Arena, between former world champion Stanislaus Zbyszko and Canadian champion George Walker. Professional wrestling would continue at the Arena until 1938. Promoter Ivan Mickailof began promoting weekly shows in 1929. Some of the names that Mickailof presented at the Arena included Strangler Lewis and Toots Mondt, as well as reigning world champions Gus Sonnenberg, Ed Don George, Henri Deglane, Jim Londos, Ali Baba, Vic Christie, Everett Marshall and Billy Weidner, who all defended their titles at the Arena.

On February 8, 1923, the first radio broadcast of an ice hockey game was made from the Arena by the Toronto Daily Star&#x27;s CFCA radio station. Norman Albert did the play-by-play of the third period of a game between North Toronto and Midland, won by North Toronto 16–4. Later that season, Foster Hewitt made his first radio broadcasts from the Arena, also on CFCA. A game on February 14, 1923, between the Toronto St. Pats and Ottawa Senators was the first NHL game broadcast on radio. The Stanley Cup Finals was played at Arena Gardens four times: 1914, 1918, 1920 and 1922. Arena Gardens also hosted the Memorial Cup finals nine times from 1919 to 1931. The Gardens also hosted the Allan Cup final series. A 1931 game between the Montreal Canadiens and the Maple Leafs was filmed by the National Film Board of Canada.

The building was also used for mass assemblies. An assembly was held for Sir Wilfrid Laurier in 1913 by the Liberal Party of Canada. On June 10, 1925, this building was used as the venue for the inaugural service of the United Church of Canada, which united four existing denominations: the Presbyterians, the Methodist Church of Canada, the Congregational Union of Canada, and the Association of Local Union Churches. On December 3, 1933, 7,000 persons attended a memorial service for Sir Arthur Currie, commander of the Canadian Corps in World War I. On October 9, 1936, it was the site of a mass assembly by the Communist Party of Canada.

After the Maple Leafs left in 1931, the building was no longer a venue for professional ice hockey but remained open as a venue for sports and entertainment. Some of the other sports included bicycle racing, professional boxing, and tennis. By 1934, revenues did not keep up with interest on bonds on the property, property taxes, and the expenses of operating the arena. The bondholders made it known that the building was for sale. By 1937, with $200,000 of bonds in default, and the Arena in default of 1933 and 1934 taxes of nearly $16,000, and a similar amount estimated for 1936 and 1937, the Arena was listed for sale by the City of Toronto.

In 1938, the Arena was leased to Edward &quot;Ted&quot; Dickson who turned it into a recreation facility offering ice skating in winter and roller skating in summer. The name was changed that year to the Mutual Street Arena. The Glenn Miller big band played at the Arena in January 1942, Miller&#x27;s only appearance in Toronto. Frank Sinatra made his first appearance in Toronto here in 1949. Roller hockey was introduced to the Arena in the late 1940s. Hank Williams Sr played a concert at the Arena in 1952. The city&#x27;s first boat show was held in 1954. The &quot;Melody Fair&quot; theatre-in-the-round operated at the Arena in 1954.

Dickson bought the building in 1945 and it remained in the family for the next 43 years. The arena was renovated for $3 million in 1962, adding 18 curling sheets, year-round roller skating, a parking garage, and a new facade. The Arena was renamed &quot;The Terrace&quot;, a name it kept until it was sold in 1988. It closed its doors on April 30, 1989, and was demolished a few months later. The site was converted into a residential development with some of the site reserved for a city park. The Terrace name was retained for one of the residential buildings. In May 2011, the name of the city park on the site was changed from &quot;Cathedral Square Park&quot; to &quot;Arena Gardens&quot;.

<doc id="717119" wikidata="Q55609930" url="?curid=717119" title="Double depression">
<text>Double depression refers to the co-existence of major depressive disorder (MDD) and persistent depressive disorder (PDD), the latter previously referred to as dysthymia. Research has shown that double depression tends to be more severe than either MDD or PDD alone and that individuals with double depression experience relapse more often than those with either MDD or PDD alone. However, there is some research that indicates few differences exist between double depression, MDD, and PDD; as a result, those researchers conclude that double depression is not a distinct disorder.

The literature that details the pharmaceutical treatment of double depression is sparse. Although there are studies that demonstrate that certain medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are effective methods of treatment, those studies lack placebo controls; therefore, the studies&#x27; conclusions are questionable.

Research has found that, as is the case with other depressive disorders, pharmaceutical and therapeutic treatments combined are more effective than the use of either form of treatment alone. Individuals with double depression tend to experience more functional impairment than those with either MDD or PDD alone. As a result, researchers emphasize the need for unique treatments for double depression to be developed and implemented.

==Presentation==

Individuals with double depression meet the DSM-5 classification criteria for both MDD and PDD. Goldney and Fisher (2004) determined that, in a sample of 3,010 individuals from southern portions of Australia calculated a prevalence rate of double depression of 2.2%. Jonas et al. (2003) reported a prevalence rate of double depression in the United States of 3.4%—based upon an assessment of 7,667 Americans. The prevalence rate of double depression can be compared to rates of PDD at 6.2%, major depressive episode (MDE) at 8.6%, and major depressive episode with severity (MDE-s) at 7.7%. Keller and Shapiro (1982) found that 26% of patients within a sample of 101 met the criteria for both MDD and PDD; however, the aforementioned sample is much smaller—and much more inclined to inaccuracies—than the samples (3,010 and 7,667) described above. Thus, double depression is less common than other forms of depression, but it is still a form of depression that warrants medical attention in the form of behavioral therapies; pharmaceutical treatments; or, both (Miller, Norman, and Keitner, 1999).

The characteristics of those with double depression tend to be more severe in nature than those associated with those who have either MDD or PDD. Levitt, Joffe, and MacDonald (1991) found that those with double depression experience fluctuations in mood at an earlier point in life, a more substantial number of depressive episodes, as well as co-morbid disorders of anxieties more often than their MDD-alone counterparts. Goldney and Fisher (2004) reported that individuals with double depression seek medical attention more often than those with either MDD or PDD alone. Leader and Klein (1996) found that individuals with double depression experience a more substantial level of social impairment, which includes factors such as leisure pursuits and relationship characteristics, than those with either MDD or PDD. Dixon and Thyer (1998) concluded that individuals with double depression experiences recoveries on a more frequent basis than their counterparts who have MDD alone (88% to 69%); however, individuals with double depression experience the most substantial rates of relapse of all of those who suffer from chronic depression. In addition, remission from MDD tends to happen faster than remission from PDD (Dixon &amp; Thyer, 1998).

Miller, Norman, and Dow (1986) reported that individuals with double depression endure a more severe path of illness, but experience few differences with respect to social impairment compared to their MDD-alone counterparts. In addition, McCullough et al. (2000) found that, with the exception that patients with double depression tended to experience of more severe illness, few differences were apparent. Therefore, the conclusions drawn in previous research that are associated with the nature of the clinical presentation of double depression are mixed. Multiple scientists emphasize the need for additional research to determine adequate treatments for those with double depression, as depression is a disease that places a considerable burden upon communities and societies; furthermore, those researchers predict depression will be, in an economic sense, the second-most burdensome disease on societies come 2020.

==Treatment==

Research on pharmaceutical treatment of double depression in particular is sparse. Certain medications, such as fluoxetine, were found in numerous studies to be effective at reducing symptom severity; however, these studies involved open-label trials, double-blind randomized trials that lack placebo conditions, and small sample sizes. Thus, placebo-controlled trials are needed in order to determine adequate and unique treatments for double depression. In addition, the considerable burden depression places upon communities and societies (Goldney &amp; Fisher, 2004) emphasizes the need for additional research into the treatment of chronic depression.

Hellerstein et al. (1994) theorized that antidepressant medications could be used to ameliorate both MDD and PDD; a pharmaceutical trial found that fluoxetine facilitated remission in 57.1% of patients after five months of treatment. In addition, Miller, Norman, and Keitner (1999) conducted an intervention in which one cohort received pharmaceutical treatment while another cohort received both pharmaceutical and therapeutic treatment. Their results indicated that those who received the combined intervention were more functional—in a social sense—as well as relieved of their depression than those who received the pharmaceutical intervention alone (Miller, Norman, &amp; Keitner, 1999). However, the researchers found that the effect disappeared at both the 6 and 12-month follow-up assessments.

Vasile et al. (2012) conducted a pharmaceutical trial with 16 patients with double depression (who had comorbid alcohol dependence) who were treated and monitored for six months. Results showed that three antidepressants—venlafaxine, duloxetine, and milnacipran—were associated with substantial improvement; venlafaxine was the most effective of the three antidepressants.

Koran, Aboujaoude, and Gamel (2007) conducted a pharmaceutical trial with 24 adults who received duloxetine over the course of a 12-week period. Results showed that duloxetine was successful in the treatment of both PDD as well as double depression. However, the researchers&#x27; trial was an open-label trial; as a result, the researchers called for a double-blind and placebo-controlled trial to be conducted in order to further validate the benefits the medication seems to provide.

In addition, Waslick et al. (1999) used duloxetine to treat 19 children and adolescents with either PDD or double depression; after eight weeks of pharmaceutical treatment, 11 of the patients failed to meet the classification criteria for one of the two disorders, which led to the conclusion that duloxetine was a medication that appeared to provide relief from PDD and double depression in children and adolescents. However, the aforementioned trial (in addition to Koran et al.&#x27;s (2007) trial) was an open-label trial, which the authors noted as a limitation.

Hirschfield et al. (1998) conducted a 12-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) that involved the administration of sertraline or imipramine, after which 324 of 623 patients either qualified for remission or experienced a substantive improvement in clinical presentation. In a double-blind, fixed-dose trial that involved the use of either the monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) moclobemide or the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine, Duarte, Mikkelsen, and DeliniStula (1996) were able to facilitate a minimum of a 50% score reduction on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). 71% of cases that involved moclobemide—versus 38% of cases that involved fluoxetine—were determined to achieve the aforementioned desired outcome. As a result, the researchers concluded that both antidepressants were similar in their abilities to treat double depression in an effective fashion. However, the lack of a placebo control undermines the extent to which the results can be applied.

Marin, Kocsis, Frances, and Parides (1994) conducted an eight-week open trial that entailed the administration of desipramine to 42 individuals with double depression and 33 individuals with PDD. The researchers found that 70% of the PDD patients experienced a substantial improvement in clinical presentation; the proportion associated with the double depression-cohort was said to be similar. However, the lack of blindness as well as a placebo control notes a considerable limitation of the aforementioned research.

Goldney and Bain (2006) found that those who have double depression receive some form of treatment on a more substantial basis than their MDD-alone and PDD-alone counterparts. To elaborate, the authors measured that, in Australia, 41.4% of those evaluated with double depression received treatment three or more times over the course of the previous month, whereas 34.5% of those with MDD alone; 23.2% of those with PDD alone; and 10.3% of those who were not depressed received treatment three or more times over the course of the previous month (Goldney &amp; Bain, 2006). In addition, the researchers concluded that those with double depression acquire a more substantial number of treatment visits per month (a mean of 4.3) when compared to their MDD-alone counterparts (a mean of 3.0); their PDD-alone counterparts (a mean of 2.6); and their non-depressed counterparts (a mean of 1.5).

==Prognosis==

Although double depression is less prevalent than either MDD or PDD, it is still a form of depression that warrants medical attention in the form of behavioral therapies; pharmaceutical treatments; or, both. Miller, Norman, and Keitner (1999) found that the use of both behavioral and pharmaceutical treatments was more effective on a short-term basis in the reduction of depression than the use of pharmaceutical treatments alone.

Klein, Shankman, and Rose (2008) determined that poor maternal-child relationship, histories of sexual abuse, co-morbid disorders of anxieties, and lower educational attainment predicted an increased HAM-D score after a decade; the researchers also determined that those same factors predicted, after a decade, increased functional impairment. In addition, the results showed that the life course of depression did not differ to a substantial extent between individuals with MDD-alone and double depression.

Hirschfield et al. (1998) conducted a 12-week RCT that involved the administration of sertraline or imipramine, in which the most notable predictors of treatment response were educational attainment and relationship status; in addition, the authors noted the apparent influence of intrinsic personal traits. However, Hirschfield et al. noted the limitation of a lack of a placebo control.

Klein, Taylor, Harding, and Dickstein (1988) reported that, via their assessment of clinical, familial, and socio-environmental characteristics of those with chronic depression, at a six-month follow-up, individuals with double depression experienced decreased rates of remission, increased manifestations of clinical depressive phenomena, increased functional impairment, and increased likelihood of the development and onset of a hypomanic episode than their MDD-alone counterparts; as a result, the authors underscore the importance of the creation of a distinct classification of double depression due to its unique episodic path.

==Controversies==

Previous research on the clinical presentation of double depression tends to be mixed. Numerous studies indicate that the course of double depression tends to be more severe in nature. In addition, numerous studies demonstrate that individuals with double depression seek medical attention to a more substantial extent than those with either MDD or PDD. However, Miller, Norman, and Dow (1986) determined that individuals with MDD or PDD versus individuals with double depression experienced similar levels of social impairment. In addition, McCullough and colleagues found that there were few additional differences overall between the characteristics of those with double depression versus those with either MDD or PDD.

Research on the course of double depression is also mixed. Klein, Taylor, Harding, and Dickstein (1988) found that remission in individuals with double depression is less probable than it is in individuals with either MDD or PDD; the researchers also noted that those with double depression are more prone to the development and onset of a hypomanic episode than those with either MDD or PDD. In addition, Klein, Shankman, and Rose (2008) and Hirschfield et al. (1998) both concluded that educational status predicted treatment outcome. However, Levitt, Joffe, and MacDonald (1991) demonstrated that the courses of the respective depressive disorders did not differ to a substantial extent. While Klein, Shankman, and Rose (2008) advocate for the creation of a distinct classification of double depression in the future edition(s) of the DSM, Levitt and colleagues (as well as McCullough and colleagues) seem to indicate that, due to the numerous similarities as well as limited differences between double depression and either MDD or PDD, the creation of such a classification would be inappropriate and incorrect. Remick, Sadovnick, Lam, Zis, and Yee (1996) determine that the heritable bases of MDD, PDD, and double depression are similar and that, as a result, the three disorders are unable to be differentiated.

<text>Kevin Hamilton McDonald (born May 16, 1961) is a Canadian actor and comedian. He is a member of the comedy troupe The Kids in the Hall, who have appeared together in a number of stage, television and film productions, most notably the 1988–1995 TV series &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot;. He played Pastor Dave in &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;, and starred as a co-pilot in the 2011 web comedy series &quot;Papillon&quot;. He also does voice work in animation, most notably as Agent Wendy Pleakley in the &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; franchise, Waffle in &quot;Catscratch&quot;, and the Almighty Tallest Purple in &quot;Invader Zim&quot;.

He starred alongside Rodney Dangerfield, Lou Ferrigno and Dom DeLuise as the titular character in the gangster parody film &quot;The Godson&quot;.

==Early life==

McDonald was born in Montréal, Québec, the son of Sheila and Hamilton &quot;Hammy&quot; McDonald, who was a dental equipment salesman. He moved to Los Angeles, California, at the age of seven, after his father was transferred there. His family subsequently lived in Toronto, Ontario, as well. McDonald has a younger sister, Sandra.

During an interview on &quot;WTF with Marc Maron&quot;, McDonald discussed his father&#x27;s severe alcoholism, which inspired the &quot;Kids in the Hall&quot; sketches &quot;Daddy Drank&quot; and &quot;Girl Drink Drunk.&quot; Although he calls his mother &quot;a wonderful woman,&quot; she was nevertheless reluctant to leave his father until Kevin turned 19, when his father&#x27;s drinking had escalated to two bottles of vodka daily. McDonald, his mother and sister rented an apartment, where they quietly moved their belongings &quot;every night [after his father would] collapse on the stairs.&quot; Once they had completely moved, his parents divorced, his father lost his job, went bankrupt and lived in a homeless shelter for a year, during which he abstained from drinking (although he alleged &quot;his roommates were drinking Drano&quot;); coincidentally, McDonald used the same building to rehearse with &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot; as they were starting out on stage. His father was able to find employment at a flower shop, then an apartment and, over time, resume his career in dental equipment sales. Eventually, he did drink again, but not to the extent he had earlier in his life. He died of an aneurysm in 2004. McDonald used his relationship with his father as the basis for a one-man show, &quot;Hammy and the Kids&quot;, in which he said he had no happy ending to the story of his father. However, during an interview with Marc Maron, he said after one performance of his one-man show, he was approached by a stranger who said that he had served his father as a bartender, and that his father mentioned how proud he was of his son, the famous comedian, which moved McDonald to tears &quot;like the ending to a bad movie.&quot;

McDonald briefly studied acting at a community college, where he was kicked out for being &quot;a one-legged actor&quot; (i.e. he could perform comedy, but not drama) by a dean who had a leg amputated, and was therefore a literal one-legged actor. However, one of his professors, William B. Davis (who later found fame in his portrayal of Cigarette Smoking Man on &quot;The X-Files&quot;), saw McDonald&#x27;s potential and encouraged him to pursue improv comedy by giving him the number to The Second City in Toronto.

==Career==
McDonald founded The Kids in the Hall comedy troupe with his friend Dave Foley. They met in Toronto at the Second City Training Center, and the two wrote and performed in sketches together more than any other pair in the group. In the troupe&#x27;s TV and stage shows, he portrays several popular recurring characters, such as the King of Empty Promises, Sir Simon Milligan, and Jerry Sizzler. A frequent running gag was that McDonald is the least popular member and always struggling not to get kicked out.

When the troupe ended the five-season run of its eponymous television series in 1994, the five members moved to a number of solo projects. McDonald has played roles in movies like &quot;Boy Meets Girl&quot;, Pleakley in the &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; franchise, and Harry Potter in &quot;Epic Movie&quot;. On television, he has appeared on &quot;The Martin Short Show&quot;, &quot;Ellen&quot; (as a radio personality), &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; (as a confused young cleric, Pastor Dave), &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;NewsRadio&quot; (on which Foley starred), &quot;MADtv&quot;, &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, and &quot;Corner Gas&quot;. McDonald has also done voice work for various animated series, including &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot;, &quot;Invader Zim&quot; (in which he did the voice for Almighty Tallest Purple), &quot;The Angry Beavers&quot;, &quot;Catscratch&quot; (in which he voiced Waffle), and &quot;&quot;. He also played an imaginary friend named Ivan in the &quot;Foster&#x27;s Home for Imaginary Friends&quot; episode &quot;Sight For Sore Eyes&quot;, and appeared in the music video for &quot;Roses&quot; by OutKast.

In 2006, McDonald hosted a CBC Television special, &quot;Sketch with Kevin McDonald&quot;, featuring several of Canada&#x27;s best-known sketch comedy troupes. The special received two nominations, for the performances by The Minnesota Wrecking Crew and by The Imponderables, for Canadian Comedy Award in the category Best Taped Live Performance, with The Minnesota Wrecking Crew winning the award.

Since 2000, McDonald and the other members of The Kids in the Hall have reunited for a number of tours and televised performances. The troupe played the 2007 Just for Laughs festival, where McDonald also performed his one-and-a half-man show &quot;Hammy and the Kids&quot; with Craig Northey, based on his two dysfunctional families, his father (&quot;Hammy&quot;) and The Kids in the Hall.

<text>The [[Faroe Islands]] are divided into 29 municipalities, six regions/shires (, in plural) and since 2007 there has been only one constituency, earlier there were seven constituencies. Each region has one sheriff ().

*Eysturoyar &quot;sýsla&quot; – Eysturoy region.
*Norðoya - Norðoyar (&quot;Northern Isles&quot;) region. (KG) Borðoy, Fugloy, Kalsoy, Kunoy, Svínoy, Viðoy.
*Sandoyar – Sandoy region (SA), Sandoy, Skúvoy, Stóra Dímun.
*Streymoyar – Streymoy region (TN). Streymoy, Hestur, Koltur, Nólsoy.
*Suðuroyar – Suðuroy region. Lítla Dímun, Suðuroy (TG).
*Vága – Vágar region. Mykines, Vágar (VA).

The administrative subdivisions of the Faroe Islands are frequently changing. In the 1980s there were more than 50 municipalities. During the last past decades the number has been decreasing steadily, and more municipal-mergers can be expected within the following years. The aim of the ministry of interior is that in 2015 there will be only seven or nine municipalities in the Faroe Islands, more or less following the boundaries of the districts and constituencies. If this happens the Faroe Islands will have left the administrative structure of parish municipalities, which was built up in the first half of the 20th century and entered a structure of regional municipalities.

Furthermore, there was a long-running discussion on reducing or even removing the constituencies. In the end, from the 2008 election onwards, the constituencies were abolished.

The regions () are not administrative parts of the islands like the municipalities (). Municipalities charge taxes from inhabitants, while regions cannot charge taxes. Regions are mostly used by the public churches for the registration of births, deaths, marriages, divorces, christenings, etc., but the central administration which gathers these informations from the priest and the municipalities is located in Tórshavn. It is called and is now a part of the Environmental Agency ().

The regions are also relevant to pilot whale hunts. The sheriff decides if a pod of pilot whales can be killed or not. The boats need to get the sheriff&#x27;s permission before any slaughter can take place, and in some regions the sheriff also decides which villages the whale meat and blubber should be given to. This is the case in Suðuroy: if people from the southern part of the island participate in a whale hunt, they are not sure to get any meat at all if the sheriff decides that there are too few whales to divide it among the whole island. The sheriff can decide to give the meat only, for example, to the northern part or to specific villages or to homes for the elderly.

<text>A History of the World in 10½ Chapters by English writer Julian Barnes published in 1989 is usually described as a novel, though it is actually a collection of subtly connected short stories, in different styles. Most are fictional but some are historical.

One of the several recurrent motifs is that of ships.

==Plot==
Chapter 1, &quot;The Stowaway&quot;, is an alternative account of the story of Noah&#x27;s Ark from the point of view of the woodworms, who were not allowed onboard and were stowaways during the journey. The woodworm who narrates the first chapter questions the wisdom of appointing Noah as God&#x27;s representative. The woodworm was left out of the ark, just like the other &quot;impure&quot; or &quot;insignificant&quot; species; but a colony of woodworms enters the ark as stowaways and they survive the Great Deluge. The woodworm becomes one of the many connecting figures, appearing in almost every chapter and implying processes of decay, especially of knowledge and historical understanding.

Chapter 2, &quot;The Visitors&quot;, describes the hijacking of a cruise liner, similar to the 1985 incident of the &quot;Achille Lauro&quot;.

Chapter 3, &quot;The Wars of Religion&quot;, reports a trial against the woodworms in a church, as they have caused the building to become unstable.

Chapter 4, &quot;The Survivor&quot;, is set in a world in which the Chernobyl disaster was &quot;the first big accident&quot;. Journalists report that the world is on the brink of nuclear war. The protagonist escapes by boat to avoid the assumed inevitability of a nuclear holocaust. Whether this occurred or is merely a result of the protagonist&#x27;s paranoia is left ambiguous.

Chapter 5, &quot;Shipwreck&quot;, is an analysis of Géricault&#x27;s painting, &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot;. The first half narrates the historical events of the shipwreck and the survival of the crew members. The second half of the chapter analyses the painting itself. It describes Géricault&#x27;s &quot;softening&quot; the impact of reality in order to preserve the aestheticism of the work, or to make the story of what happened more palatable.

Chapter 6, &quot;The Mountain&quot;, describes the journey of a religious woman to a monastery where she wants to intercede for her dead father. &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot; plays a role in this story as well.

Chapter 7, &quot;Three Simple Stories&quot;, portrays a survivor from the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;, the Biblical story of Jonah and the whale, and the Jewish refugees on board the MS &quot;St. Louis&quot; in 1939, who were prevented from landing in the United States and other countries.

Chapter 8, &quot;Upstream!&quot;, consists of letters from an actor who travels to a remote jungle for a film project, described as similar to &quot;The Mission&quot; (1986). His letters grow more philosophical and complicated as he deals with the living situations, the personalities of his costars and the director, and the peculiarities of the indigenous population, coming to a climax when his colleague is drowned in an accident with a raft.

The unnumbered half-chapter, &quot;Parenthesis&quot;, is inserted between Chapters 8 and 9. It is in the form of an essay rather than a short story and offers a philosophical discussion on love, and briefly history. There is a direct reference to Julian Barnes in this half chapter. A parallel is drawn with El Greco&#x27;s painting &quot;Burial of the Count of Orgaz&quot;, in which the artist confronts the viewer. The piece includes a discussion of lines from Philip Larkin&#x27;s poem &quot;An Arundel Tomb&quot; (&quot;What will survive of us is love&quot;) and from W. H. Auden&#x27;s &quot;September 1, 1939&quot; (&quot;We must love one another or die&quot;).

Chapter 9, &quot;Project Ararat&quot;, tells the story of a fictional astronaut Spike Tiggler, based on James Irwin. Tiggler launches an expedition to recover what remains of Noah&#x27;s Ark. There is overlap with Chapter 6, &quot;The Mountain.&quot;

Chapter 10, &quot;The Dream&quot;, is an account of a modernized version of heaven, where even Hitler is found. It is individualised for each person and the occupants eventually &quot;die&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Reviewing &quot;A History of the World in 10½ Chapters&quot; for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Jonathan Coe found that it, &quot;while hardly a ground-breaking piece of experimentalism, succeeds to the extent that it is both intelligent and reasonably accessible. Where it falls down is in denying its reader any real focus of human attention or involvement&quot;. He added that, &quot;To dismiss the book as being too clever (or merely clever, for that matter) would be ungenerous as well as facile. Barnes is clearly serious about his themes, and there&#x27;s more than a nod towards emotional commitment. One of his central concerns is the nature of history, and naturally enough - as a good, free-thinking, commonsense, late-20th-century liberal - he rejects any theory of history as pattern or continuum: &#x27;It&#x27;s more like a multi-media collage,&#x27; he explains, and this, of course, is the rationale behind the novel&#x27;s own structural disjointedness&quot;. Coe judged that the book failed to explore history&#x27;s relationship with the exercise of power &quot;via the interaction of character. And this is where Barnes disappoints: I can&#x27;t remember reading a novel which showed so little interest in the politics of everyday relationships - or one, at any rate, which isolated them so ruthlessly from the speculative realm of &#x27;ideas&#x27;&quot;. Coe found the &quot;Parenthesis, or half-chapter&quot; to be &quot;both too florid and too cool at the same time&quot;, but concluded that, overall, &quot;Readers of this novel will feel awed, I&#x27;m sure, by the range of its concerns, the thoroughness of its research, and the agility with which it covers its ground. But when there are such big themes at stake, the reader can get tired of being teased, however ever waggishly. It&#x27;s like finally going to bed with the partner of your dreams and then, instead of making love, being given a jolly good tickle&quot;.

Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Joyce Carol Oates began by noting, &quot;Post-modernist in conception but accessibly straightforward in execution, Julian Barnes&#x27;s fifth book is neither the novel it is presented as being nor the breezy pop-history of the world its title suggests. Influenced to varying degrees by such 20th-century presences as the inevitable Borges, Calvino and Nabokov, as well as by Roland Barthes and perhaps Michel Tournier among others, &quot;A History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters&quot; is most usefully described as a gathering of prose pieces, some fiction, others rather like essays&quot;. She found his &quot;concerns throughout are abstract and philosophical, though his tone is unpretentious […]. Very like Borges, Julian Barnes has a predilection for tracing leitmotifs through a variety of metamorphoses&quot;. For Oates, &quot;Given the principle of repetition, of permutations and combinations, it is inevitable that some of Mr. Barnes&#x27;s prose pieces are more successful than others.[…] the second piece, &quot;The Visitors,&quot; […] is wholly unbelievable, and the head terrorist speaks a stagey, mock-Hollywood lingo&quot;. &quot;But&quot;, she wrote, &quot;as &quot;A History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters&quot; progresses and leitmotifs recur, often in comically ingenious combinations, the book becomes increasingly engaging and entertaining; and […] the book attains that genial mastery of tone that characterized &quot;Flaubert&#x27;s Parrot&quot;.&quot; 
Oates concluded by writing, &quot;&quot;A History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters&quot; demystifies its subjects and renders them almost ordinary: &#x27;Myth will become reality, however sceptical we might be.&#x27; In so doing it deconstructs, perhaps even mocks, its own ambition. If the reader does not come to the book with certain of the expectations of prose fiction - that ideas will be dramatized with such narrative momentum that one forgets they are &#x27;ideas,&#x27; and that complete worlds will be evoked by way of prose, not merely discussed - this is a playful, witty and entertaining gathering of conjectures by a man to whom ideas are quite clearly crucial: a quintessential humanist, it would seem, of the pre-post-modernist species&quot;.

For D. J. Taylor, writing in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, &quot;[…] &quot;A History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters&quot; is not a novel, according to the staider definitions; it possesses no character who rises above the level of a cipher and no plot worth speaking of. It is sharp, funny and brilliant without suggesting that this sharpness, humour and brilliance is sufficient to carry through its purpose to any satisfactory conclusion. Yet it is a significant novel, if only because it provides an inventory of the hoops through which the contemporary novelist has to jump if he wants to be taken seriously&quot;. He went on to claim that &quot;there exists a whole pack of modern writers who delight in giving the game away, in telling you that they are making it up, in indulging in outrageous manipulations of character and plot. The result is that hardly anyone in these novels — brilliant novels, swimming with lively conceits — has that most necessary fictional quality, a life of their own&quot; and that &quot;&quot;A History&quot; is another of these newfangled romps, a series of neat, artfully stage-managed stories which combine to create a bizarre, off-centre view of world history&quot;. In the end, he decided, &quot;This is an entertaining book, containing any number of sparkling jokes, but to suggest, as one or two people have begun to suggest, that it pushes back some sort of fictional frontier would be a mistake. […] Like a great deal of theoretical literary criticism — to which it bears a strong resemblance — &quot;A History&quot; expends vast ingenuity on proving something that might be regarded as an axiom. Tous les significations sont arbitraires, [&quot;all significations are arbitrary&quot;] as a French theorist once put it. Well, we knew that&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Tarpon&quot; (SS-175), second United States Navy ship of this name, was a &quot;Porpoise&quot;-class diesel-electric submarine. &quot;Tarpon&quot; conducted war patrols in the Pacific Ocean during World War II.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Tarpon&quot; was laid down on 22 December 1933 at Groton, Connecticut, by the Electric Boat Corporation; launched on 4 September 1935; sponsored by Miss Eleanore Katherine Roosevelt, daughter of Assistant Secretary of the Navy Henry L. Roosevelt; and commissioned on 12 March 1936.

==Pre-war==
&quot;Tarpon&quot; operated from San Diego and Pearl Harbor with Submarine Division 13 (SubDiv 13) for several years and was then assigned to SubDiv 14. In October 1939, SubDiv 14 was transferred to the Philippines, augmenting the six old S-boats at Manila. All submarines there were then reorganized into Submarine Squadron 5. In October 1941, SubDivs 15 and 16 were transferred from Pearl Harbor to Manila, increasing the Asiatic Fleet strength to 29 submarines. They were divided into five divisions; &quot;Tarpon&quot; was assigned to SubDiv 203.

== World War II ==

=== 1942 ===
Two days after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, 18 submarines departed the Philippines on their first war patrols. &quot;Tarpon&quot;, under Lt. Comdr. Lewis Wallace, was assigned an area off southeastern Luzon. Since all the ships that she definitely identified as Japanese presented unfavorable firing angles, the submarine ended her patrol on 11 January 1942 at Darwin, Australia, without having fired a torpedo.

&quot;Tarpon&quot; got underway on 25 January for her second patrol which took her to the Moluccas. On the 30th, she sighted a convoy; but, since the enemy ships were well escorted, the submarine abandoned the chase. On 1 February, &quot;Tarpon&quot; fired a spread of four torpedoes at a freighter. One hit. She then fired two more; both hit. Her victim was apparently sinking when the submarine left the scene of the attack, but postwar analysis of Japanese records did not confirm the kill. On 11 February, while investigating a surface contact. &quot;Tarpon&quot; was illuminated by the enemy&#x27;s searchlight. She dived and went deep but was severely jolted by four depth charges that knocked out her bow planes, rudder angle indicator, and port annunciator. On the night of 23 February – 24 February, &quot;Tarpon&quot; ran aground while attempting to navigate Boling Strait, west of Flores Island. Jettisoning ammunition, fresh water, fuel, and torpedoes failed to lighten the ship enough to float her off. A native boat then took an officer ashore on the island of Adonara, later returning with the only white man on the island, a Dutch missionary, Pastor H. von Den Rulst. He informed Wallace the next high tide would occur between 16:00 and 18:00. His warning that Japanese planes had been over the island during each of the past four days caused the crew a bit of uneasiness until flood tide. Then, with three engines backing, she slid off the bottom, returning to Fremantle on 5 March.

&quot;Tarpon&quot; began her third patrol on 28 March and ended at Pearl Harbor on 17 May with no contacts except a hospital ship. Her next mission, which took her north of Oahu for defense during the Battle of Midway, lasted only ten days, from 30 May to 9 June; but the submarine contacted no enemy shipping. She was then routed back to San Francisco for an overhaul which was completed on 30 September.

On 22 October, &quot;Tarpon&quot; stood out of Pearl Harbor to begin her fifth war patrol which took her to waters north of Bougainville. She sighted many fishing boats which were not worthy of a torpedo and terminated the patrol at Midway on 10 December 1942.

=== 1943 ===
&quot;Tarpon&quot; then returned to Pearl Harbor for a refit and began her next patrol from there on 10 January 1943, with Tom Wogan in command. Her assigned area was in Japanese home waters, south of Honshū. At 21:30 on 1 February, approximately south of Mikura-jima, the submarine fired four torpedoes at a ship and scored one hit. A follow-up attack with two torpedoes broke the 10,935-ton passenger-cargo ship &quot;Fushimi Maru&quot; in two. Four days later, &quot;Tarpon&quot; began patrolling the sea lanes leading to Truk. On 8 February, she made radar contact on a large, unidentified ship. She fired a spread of four torpedoes, and all hit the target. The submarine was forced to go deep by escorts and could not watch the 16,975-ton transport sink. The victim was the &quot;Tatsuta Maru&quot;, bound for Truk with a load of soldiers. &quot;Tarpon&quot; made no further contacts before returning to Midway on 25 February, with the highest-scoring patrol of the war so far.

Her seventh patrol, conducted from 29 March to 15 May, produced no ship contacts; but &quot;Tarpon&quot; did bombard the radio station at Taroa with her deck gun until return fire from Japanese batteries ashore prompted her to withdraw from the area.

On 30 July, &quot;Tarpon&quot; again headed for Japanese home waters. On 16 August, she sighted a Japanese task force which reportedly included an aircraft carrier of the &quot;Otaka&quot;-class (there was, in fact, no such class; intelligence had misidentified ), but its high speed prohibited an attack. On the 21st, the submarine contacted two large, escorted, cargo ships. She fired a spread of three torpedoes at each and damaged both targets. Seven days later, &quot;Tarpon&quot; damaged another freighter as it was leaving Mikura-jima. On 4 September, she sank a patrol ship with all hands and then returned to Midway on 8 September.

&quot;Tarpon&quot; conducted her ninth war patrol off the coast of Honshū from 1 October to 3 November. On the night of 16 October, she was patrolling the approaches to Yokohama when she sighted a ship which she tentatively identified as a large auxiliary. The submarine tracked the target until 01:56 the next morning when she attacked it with four torpedoes which stopped it dead in the water. However, it soon got underway again and headed straight for &quot;Tarpon&quot;. The submarine submerged, went under the ship, and attacked the target from the other side with three more torpedoes which produced one hit in the stern. The enemy still did not sink, so &quot;Tarpon&quot; fired again with a torpedo which struck the target in the same place as the first. The vessel exploded and disappeared. Postwar examination of enemy records revealed that the victim was the German raider &quot;Michel&quot; (&quot;Schiff&quot; 28) which had been preying on Allied shipping in both the Atlantic and the Pacific. &quot;Michel&quot; was the only German raider sunk by a United States submarine in the Pacific.

Four days later, &quot;Tarpon&quot; contacted an aircraft carrier and a destroyer. She made a submerged approach and fired four torpedoes at the carrier. However, both ships increased speed and avoided the torpedoes. On the morning of 23 October, the submarine made radar contact on two ships and fired five torpedoes at the larger target. All apparently passed under the freighter. The submarine returned to Pearl Harbor on 3 November.

&quot;Tarpon&quot;&#x27;s next war patrol, a photo reconnaissance of various atolls in the Marshall Islands group from 4 December 1943 to 12 January 1944, was largely uneventful. She did get an opportunity at an inter-island tanker and fired two torpedoes, but both missed and the vessel escaped.

=== 1944 ===

From 19 June to 8 August, &quot;Tarpon&quot; performed lifeguard duty in the Truk area, but made no rescues. On 14 July, she fired three torpedoes at what was thought to be an inter-island freighter. All missed, and the ship turned out to be a disguised antisubmarine ship. &quot;Tarpon&quot; went deep to evade the depth charges and cleared the area. On the 25th, she made radar contact on a small convoy and fired three torpedoes at the largest ship. All missed, and the submarine closed to engage with her deck guns. After the second shot, the gun jammed, and only the machine guns continued firing. &quot;Tarpon&quot; withdrew to clear the gun and then returned to the attack. She inflicted considerable damage on the enemy ship before she was outgunned and forced to break off the engagement.

&quot;Tarpon&quot;&#x27;s final war patrol, from 31 August to 14 October, consisted of lifeguard duty in the Truk area. When she returned to Pearl Harbor, she was ordered to the east coast of the United States. The submarine departed Pearl Harbor on Christmas Eve, 1944, and arrived at New London, Connecticut, on 17 January 1945.

== Post-war ==

After operations on the United States East Coast, &quot;Tarpon&quot; was decommissioned at Boston on 15 November 1945. Early in 1947, the submarine was scheduled for duty as a Naval Reserve training ship. &quot;Tarpon&quot; left Boston under tow on 28 March and arrived at New Orleans on 9 April and was placed in service there on the 17th. She served as a training submarine in the 8th Naval District until placed out of service and stricken from the Navy list on 5 September 1956.

&quot;Tarpon&quot; foundered in deep water, south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, on 26 August 1957, while under tow to the scrap yard.
Her wreck is located at .

North Sydney is a suburb and commercial district on the Lower North Shore of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It is located three kilometres north of the Sydney central business district and is the administrative centre for the local government area of North Sydney Council.

==History==

The Indigenous people on the southern side of Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour) called the north side &quot;warung&quot; which meant &quot;the other side&quot;, while those on the northern side used the same name to describe the southern side.

The first name used by European settlers was &quot;Hunterhill&quot;, named after a property owned by Thomas Muir of Huntershill (1765–1799), a Scottish political reformer. He purchased land in 1794 near the location where the north pylon of the Sydney Harbour Bridge is now located, and built a house which he named after his childhood home. This area north of Gore Hill became known as St Leonards. The township of St Leonards was laid out in 1836 in what is now North Sydney, bounded by what is now Miller, Walker, Lavender and Berry Streets. By 1846 there were 106 houses here and by 1859, the commercial centre had extended from Milsons Point to Miller Street. A bus service operated by Jeremiah Wall ran between Milsons Point and &quot;North Sydney Shops&quot;, and North Sydney thus developed its own identity.
The North Sydney municipality was incorporated in 1890 and after naming disputes, &quot;North Sydney&quot; was settled upon. The post office which opened in 1854 as St Leonards was changed to North Sydney in 1890. The first public school which opened in 1874 as St Leonards was renamed North Sydney in 1910.

North Sydney underwent a dramatic transformation into a commercial hub in 1971–72. In this period no less than 27 skyscrapers were built.

===Trams===

The history of the North Sydney tramway system can be divided into three periods – the first from the original opening in 1886 to 1909, when the McMahons Point line opened. The second period covers the time until the Wynyard line was opened across the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932, and the third until construction of the Cahill Expressway on the eastern side of Sydney Harbour Bridge and the wider closure of the system in 1962.

The first part of the North Sydney tramway system was a double-track cable tramway which commenced at the original Milsons Point ferry wharf, located where the north pylon of the Harbour Bridge is now. The line originally extended via Alfred Street (now Alfred Street South), Junction Street (now Pacific Highway), Blue Street and Miller Street to the Ridge Street Tram Depot. It used cable grip cars called &quot;dummies&quot; and un-powered trailer cars.

A feature of these lines was the underground tram terminus at Wynyard railway station (the only one in Australia), and the tracks over the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Trams ran from Blue Street over a now-demolished steel arch bridge over the Harbour Bridge Roadway, then over the eastern side of the harbour bridge (now road lanes), through a tram platform at Milsons Point railway station, before descending underground into platforms 1 and 2 of Wynyard station.

<doc id="717184" wikidata="Q1809853" url="?curid=717184" title="Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports">
<text>The Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports is a ceremonial official in the United Kingdom. The post dates from at least the 12th century, when the title was Keeper of the Coast, but may be older. The Lord Warden was originally in charge of the Cinque Ports, a group of five (&quot;cinque&quot; in Norman French) port towns on the southeast coast of England that was formed to collectively supply ships for The Crown in the absence at the time of a formal navy. Today the role is a sinecure and an honorary title, and fourteen towns belong to the Cinque Ports confederation. The title is one of the higher honours bestowed by the Sovereign; it has often been held by members of the Royal Family or prime ministers, especially those who have been influential in defending Britain at times of war.

The Lord Warden was solely responsible for the return of all writs to the Crown, along with the collection of taxes and the arrest of criminals. His court was held in St James&#x27;s church, near Dover Castle, and there he exercised jurisdiction broadly equivalent to that of Chancery. He also had a &quot;lieutenant&#x27;s powers of muster&quot;, and the Constableship of Dover Castle, later added (1267) to the warden&#x27;s office, enabled him to keep a garrison and administrative staff, including the clerk and the lieutenant of the castle.

The coat of arms of the Cinque Ports first appeared in 1305, second amongst the earliest English known heraldic emblems, predating even the coat of arms of the City of London. The coat of arms of the Cinque Ports displays three ships&#x27; hulls and three lions conjoined to these hulls, all in gold. These may originally have been &quot;Gules three lions passant gardant in pale &quot; (for England) dimidiating &quot;Gules three ships&#x27; hulks in pale Or&quot;. The coat of arms of the Confederation of the Cinque Ports is set out on a red and blue background and traditionally represents the fourteen &quot;corporate&quot; members.

==Creation and appointment of the Lord Warden==
The creation and appointment of the Lord Warden, once among the most powerful appointments of the realm, by the Sovereign was instituted principally after the portsmen sided with the Earl of Leicester against King Henry III, in the Second Barons&#x27; War, and was intended to provide some central authority over the Cinque Ports, which were essentially otherwise independent of the King&#x27;s sheriffs. It was combined from 1267 with the office of Constable of Dover Castle. However, from 1708 Walmer Castle at Deal was to be preferred as the official residence of the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. The Lord Warden also holds the office of Admiral of the Cinque Ports with a maritime jurisdiction extending to the middle of the English Channel, from Redcliffe near Seaford, in Sussex to the shore underneath the Naze Tower, encompassing Brightlingsea in Essex, the only Cinque Port north of the Thames. In earlier centuries the northern limit was taken as the Shoe Beacon in Essex.

The courts of Brodhull and Guestling were established to protect the privileges of the Cinque Ports by the portsmen themselves. From the 15th century these courts had been largely replaced by the Lord Warden&#x27;s Court at Dover. From the 16th century the principal business of the courts was the installation of the Lord Warden and the court is now only occasionally summoned. The office continued to be a powerful one. In 1550 the Mayor and Jurats of Dover refused to accept a Royal Writ because it was not accompanied by a letter of attendance from the Lord Warden. The member ports&#x27; parliamentary representatives were appointed by the Lord Warden at first; despite an act passed in 1689 to curb this influence, it continued until the 19th century.

At the installation of a new Lord Warden, the Speaker of the Confederation of the Cinque Ports instructs the Lord Warden: &quot;to undertake the duties of the Ancient and Honourable Office and to uphold the Franchises, Liberties, Customs and Usages of the port.&quot;

The office of Speaker has traditionally rotated between the affiliate townships every year dating from at least 1550. Inaugurations are begun on 21 May, and membership is ordained through a longstanding maritime tradition of a principle of the prevailing winds coming from west to east.

A unique uniform is specified for the Lord Warden (though Admiral of the Fleet Michael Boyce, Baron Boyce, whose term ended with his death in 2022, wore his naval uniform in preference). The uniform is very similar to a pre-1956-pattern Admiral&#x27;s uniform (complete with cocked hat) trimmed in red and with Cinque Ports insignia. Sir Robert Menzies&#x27;s uniform (pictured), which he wore as Lord Warden from 1966 to 1978, is preserved at the National Library of Australia.

==Barons of the Cinque Ports==
All freemen of the ports, termed &quot;portsmen&quot;, were deemed in the age of feudalism to be barons, and thus members of the baronage entitled to attend the king&#x27;s parliament. Termed &quot;Barons of the Cinque Ports&quot;, they reflected an early concept that military service at sea constituted land tenure &quot;per baroniam&quot; making them &quot;quasi&quot; feudal barons. The early 14th-century treatise &quot;Modus Tenendi Parliamentum&quot; stated the Barons of the Cinque Ports to hold a place of precedence below the lay magnates but above the representatives of the shires and boroughs. Writs of summons to Parliament were sent to the warden following which representative barons of the Cinque Ports were selected to attend parliament. Thus the warden&#x27;s duty in this respect was similar to that of the sheriff who received the writs for distribution to the barons in the shires. The warden and barons often experienced clashes of jurisdiction. In the 21st century the title &quot;Baron of the Cinque Ports&quot; is now reserved for Freemen elected by the Mayor, Jurats, and Common Council of the Ports to attend a Coronation, and is solely honorary in nature.

&quot;The History of the Castle, Town, and Port of Dover&quot;

==List of Lords Warden of the Cinque Ports==
The first authoritative list of Cinque Ports Confederation Members was produced in 1293 when Stephen of Pencester was Warden. The Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports is appointed for life, but in the earliest of records this was not the case. The office of Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports has been traced from the year 1226 from the appointment of William de Averanch, although he was not the first incumbent of this office. The longest term of office was that of William Brook, Lord Cobham, who presided at the court for 40 years.

<text>The Flying Dutchman () is a legendary ghost ship, allegedly never able to make port, but doomed to sail the sea forever. The myths and ghost stories are likely to have originated from the 17th-century Golden Age of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and of Dutch maritime power. The oldest known extant version of the legend dates from the late 18th century. According to the legend, if hailed by another ship, the crew of the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; might try to send messages to land, or to people long dead. Reported sightings in the 19th and 20th centuries claimed that the ship glowed with a ghostly light. In ocean lore, the sight of this phantom ship functions as a portent of doom. It was commonly believed that the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; was a 17th-century cargo vessel known as a &quot;fluyt&quot;.

==Origins==

The first known print reference to the ship appears in &quot;Travels in various part of Europe, Asia and Africa during a series of thirty years and upward&quot; (1790) by John MacDonald:

The next literary reference appears in Chapter VI of &quot;A Voyage to Botany Bay&quot; (1795) (also known as &quot;A Voyage to New South Wales&quot;), attributed to George Barrington (1755–1804):

The next literary reference introduces the motif of punishment for a crime, in &quot;Scenes of Infancy&quot; (Edinburgh, 1803) by John Leyden (1775–1811):

Thomas Moore (1779–1852) places the vessel in the north Atlantic in his poem &quot;Written on passing Dead-man&#x27;s Island in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Late in the evening, September 1804&quot;: &quot;Fast gliding along, a gloomy bark / Her sails are full, though the wind is still, / And there blows not a breath her sails to fill.&quot; A footnote adds: &quot;The above lines were suggested by a superstition very common among sailors, who call this ghost-ship, I think, &#x27;the flying Dutch-man&#x27;.&quot;

Sir Walter Scott (1771–1832), a friend of John Leyden&#x27;s, was the first to refer to the vessel as a pirate ship, writing in the notes to &quot;Rokeby&quot; (first published December 1812) that the ship was &quot;originally a vessel loaded with great wealth, on board of which some horrid act of murder and piracy had been committed&quot; and that the apparition of the ship &quot;is considered by the mariners as the worst of all possible omens&quot;.

According to some sources, 17th-century Dutch captain Bernard Fokke is the model for the captain of the ghost ship. Fokke was renowned for the speed of his trips from the Netherlands to Java and was suspected of being in league with the Devil. The first version of the legend as a story was printed in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Edinburgh Magazine&quot; for May 1821, which puts the scene as the Cape of Good Hope. This story names the &quot;Dutchman&quot;’s captain as Hendrick van der Decken and introduces the motifs (elaborated by later writers) of letters addressed to people long dead being offered to other ships for delivery, but if accepted will bring misfortune; and the captain having sworn to round the Cape of Good Hope though it should take until the day of judgment.

==Reported sightings==
There have been many reported or alleged sightings in the 19th and 20th centuries. A well-known sighting was by Prince George of Wales, the future King George V. He was on a three-year voyage during his late adolescence in 1880 with his elder brother Prince Albert Victor of Wales and their tutor John Neill Dalton. They temporarily shipped into after the damaged rudder was repaired in their original ship, the 4,000-tonne corvette &quot;Bacchante&quot;. The prince&#x27;s log (indeterminate as to which prince, due to later editing before publication) records the following for the pre-dawn hours of 11 July 1881, off the coast of Australia:

Nicholas Monsarrat, the novelist who wrote &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot;, described the phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean in his unfinished final book &quot;Master Mariner&quot;, which was partly inspired by this tale (he lived and worked in South Africa after the war) and the story of the Wandering Jew.

==Explanations as an optical illusion==

Probably the most credible explanation is a superior mirage or Fata Morgana seen at sea:
The news soon spread through the vessel that a phantom-ship with a ghostly crew was sailing in the air over a phantom-ocean, and that it was a bad omen, and meant that not one of them should ever see land again. The captain was told the wonderful tale, and coming on deck, he explained to the sailors that this strange appearance was caused by the reflection of some ship that was sailing on the water below this image, but at such a distance they could not see it. There were certain conditions of the atmosphere, he said, when the sun&#x27;s rays could form a perfect picture in the air of objects on the earth, like the images one sees in glass or water, but they were not generally upright, as in the case of this ship, but reversed—turned bottom upwards. This appearance in the air is called a mirage. He told a sailor to go up to the foretop and look beyond the phantom-ship. The man obeyed, and reported that he could see on the water, below the ship in the air, one precisely like it. Just then another ship was seen in the air, only this one was a steamship, and was bottom-upwards, as the captain had said these mirages generally appeared. Soon after, the steamship itself came in sight. The sailors were now convinced, and never afterwards believed in phantom-ships.

Another optical effect known as looming occurs when rays of light are bent across different refractive indices. This could make a ship just off the horizon appear hoisted in the air.

==Adaptations==
===In literature===
The 1797–98 poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;, contains a similar account of a ghost ship, which may have been influenced by the tale of the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;.

One of the first &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; short stories was titled &quot;Vanderdecken&#x27;s Message Home; or, the Tenacity of Natural Affection&quot; and was published in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s&quot; during 1821.

John Boyle O&#x27;Reilly wrote a poem titled &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot; (1867). It was first published in &quot;The Wild Goose&quot;, a handwritten newspaper produced by Fenian convicts being transported to Western Australia.

Dutch poet J. Slauerhoff published a number of related poems, particularly in his 1928 volume &quot;Eldorado&quot;.

Ward Moore&#x27;s 1951 story &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; used the myth as a metaphor for an automated bomber which continues to fly over an Earth where humanity long since totally destroyed itself and all life in a nuclear war.

British author Brian Jacques wrote a trilogy of fantasy/young adult novels concerning two reluctant members of the &quot;Dutchman&quot;″s crew, a young boy and his dog, whom an angel charges to help those in need. The first novel was titled &quot;Castaways of the Flying Dutchman&quot; (2001); the second was titled &quot;The Angel&#x27;s Command&quot; (2003), and the third was titled &quot;Voyage of Slaves&quot; (2006).

The comic fantasy &quot;Flying Dutch&quot; by Tom Holt is a version of the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; story. In this version, the Dutchman is not a ghost ship but crewed by immortals who can only visit land once every seven years when the unbearable smell that is a side-effect of the elixir of life wears off.

===In opera and theatre===

The story was adapted into the English melodrama &quot;The Flying Dutchman; or the Phantom Ship: a Nautical Drama, in three acts&quot; (1826) by Edward Fitzball, with music by George Rodwell. The 48-page text, published c. 1829, acknowledges the &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s&quot; story as the source.

Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot; (1843) is adapted from an episode in Heinrich Heine&#x27;s satirical novel &quot;The Memoirs of Mister von Schnabelewopski&quot; (&quot;Aus den Memoiren des Herrn von Schnabelewopski&quot;) (1833), in which a character attends a theatrical performance of &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot; in Amsterdam. Heine had first used the legend in his &quot;Reisebilder: Die Nordsee&quot; (&quot;Pictures of Travel: the North Sea&quot;) (1826), which simply repeats from &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; the features of the vessel being seen in a storm and sending letters addressed to persons long since dead. In his 1833 elaboration, Heine introduced the chance of salvation through a woman&#x27;s devotion and the opportunity to set foot on land every seven years to seek a faithful wife. It was once thought that Heine may have based the episode on Fitzball&#x27;s play, which was playing at the Adelphi Theatre in London, but the run had ended on 7 April 1827 and Heine did not arrive in London until the 14th; it was not published until its revival in 1829. Unlike Fitzball&#x27;s play, which is set off the Cape of Good Hope, Heine&#x27;s account is set in the North Sea off Scotland. Wagner&#x27;s opera was similarly planned to take place off the coast of Scotland, although during the final rehearsals he transferred the action to another part of the North Sea, off Norway.

Pierre-Louis Dietsch composed an opera &quot;Le vaisseau fantôme, ou Le maudit des mers&quot; (&quot;The Phantom Ship, or The Accursed of the Sea&quot;), which was first performed on 9 November 1842 at the Paris Opera. The libretto by Paul Foucher and H. Révoil was based on Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;The Pirate&quot; as well as Frederick Marryat&#x27;s novel &quot;The Phantom Ship&quot; and other sources, although Wagner thought it was based on the scenario of his own opera, which he had just sold to the Opera. The similarity of Dietsch&#x27;s opera to Wagner&#x27;s is slight, although Wagner&#x27;s assertion is often repeated. Berlioz thought &quot;Le vaisseau fantôme&quot; too solemn, but other reviewers were more favourable.

&quot;Dutchman&quot; (1964), a short play by Amiri Baraka, uses the legend as a symbol of entrapment.

===In art and design===
The &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; has been captured in paintings by Albert Ryder, now in the Smithsonian American Art Museum, and by Howard Pyle, whose painting of the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; is on exhibit at the Delaware Art Museum.

===In television===
In &quot;The Buccaneers&quot; 1956, episode 22 of Season 1 features a ghost ship known as &quot;The Dutchman&quot;. Ultimately, it is found that a crew of pirates had taken the ship after the previous captain was hanged and used it in lucrative business, drawing other ships in, stealing their cargo, then scuttling them, all while haunting the crews. This is ultimately thwarted by Dan Tempest and crew, when they attempt to take the ship to harbor.

In &quot;Judgment Night&quot;, a 1959 episode of Rod Serling&#x27;s &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, the U-boat captain who sank an Allied passenger ship in World War II finds himself doomed to forever relive the experience as a &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; passenger of the torpedoed ship. Two other &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episodes, &quot;The Arrival&quot; and &quot;Death Ship&quot; also refer to the legend. The &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; was also featured in &quot;Cave of the Dead&quot;, a 1967 episode of &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;.

In the 1967 &quot;Spider-Man&quot; cartoon &quot;Return of the Flying Dutchman&quot;, the ship appears as an illusion created by Mysterio.

In the 1976 &quot;Land of the Lost&quot; episode &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;, the ship appears captained by Ruben Van de Meer, who attempts to take Holly with him to give him company on his endless voyage.

A ghostly pirate known as the Flying Dutchman appears as a recurring character in the animated television series &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;.

In the anime/manga series &quot;One Piece&quot;, the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; is an undersea pirate ship captained by Vander Decken and his descendants over the course of generations and has maintained a reputation as a ghost ship accordingly through its damaged appearance.

===In comics===
Carl Barks wrote and drew a 1959 comic book story where Uncle Scrooge, Donald Duck and Huey, Dewey, and Louie meet &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot;. Barks ultimately explains the &quot;flying&quot; ship as an optical illusion.

&quot;Journey Into Mystery&quot; #56 (cover date January 1960) includes the story &quot;I Spent a Night in the Haunted Lighthouse&quot; (Author unknown; drawn by Joe Sinnott), in which a tourist stranded in an abandoned lighthouse during a nighttime storm sees a ghostly ship and pirates. The following day, he finds a life preserver from &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot;.

&quot;Silver Surfer&quot; #8–9 (cover date September/October 1969), art by John Buscema and Dan Adkins, with dialogue and editing by Stan Lee, features a retelling of &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot; legend. Here, it is the captain of the doomed ship (named Joost van Straaten) who gets the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; name, rather than his boat.

===In film===

The story was dramatised in the 1951 film &quot;Pandora and the Flying Dutchman&quot;, starring James Mason and Ava Gardner. In this version, the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; is a man, not a ship, and the main action takes place on the Mediterranean coast of Spain during the summer of 1930. Centuries earlier, the Dutchman had killed his wife, wrongly believing her to be unfaithful. At his trial, he was unrepentant and cursed God. Providence condemned him to roam the seas until he found the true meaning of love. In the only plot point taken from earlier versions of the story, once every seven years, the Dutchman is allowed ashore for six months to search for a woman who will love him enough to die for him, releasing him from his curse, and he finds her in Pandora, played by Gardner.

The &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; franchise features a ship named the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;. It first made appearances in &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; (2006) and &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot; (2007), captained by Davy Jones until his heart was stabbed by Will Turner, who became the new captain of the &quot;Dutchman&quot;. In a story partly inspired by Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera, he can step on land once every ten years, and that at any time, if he finds a love that is true, then his attachment to the ship is broken. Although it was believed that Will&#x27;s curse was lifted after the &quot;Ten years later&quot; post-credit scene of &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot;, Will was still cursed aboard the &quot;Dutchman&quot; over 20 years later in &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot; (2017). The &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; also made appearances in the video games &quot;Disney Infinity&quot;, &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;, and &quot;Sea of Thieves: A Pirate&#x27;s Life&quot;.

===In music===
In 1949, RCA Victor, inventors of the single 45 RPM format, released as one of their first singles a recording of the legend in song in bandleader Hugo Winterhalter&#x27;s &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot;, sung as a sea shanty.

Dutch symphonic black metal band Carach Angren wrote a concept album about the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; entitled &quot;Death Came Through a Phantom Ship&quot;.

Tin Machine, fronted by David Bowie, mentions it in their song &quot;Amlapura&quot; on the &quot;Tin Machine II&quot; (1991) album.

&quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot; is a song by the pirate-themed music group The Jolly Rogers. Its lyrics narrate the encounter of a ship crew with the titular ghost ship.

&quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; is a B-side from Tori Amos&#x27;s 1992 debut album &quot;Little Earthquakes.&quot;

&quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; is a track on Jethro Tull&#x27;s 1979 twelfth studio album &quot;Stormwatch.&quot;

===In radio drama===
The story was adapted by Judith French into a play, &quot;The Dutch Mariner&quot;, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 13 April 2003.

=== In leisure ===

The Efteling amusement park in the Netherlands has a roller coaster called De Vliegende Hollander (&quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot; in English), which features a captain named Willem van der Decken (nl).

===In aviation===
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines references the endless traveling aspect of the story by having &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot; painted on the rear sides of all its aircraft with regular livery.

===In sailing===
There is a design of 20-foot, one-design, high-performance, two-person racing dinghy named the Flying Dutchman. It made its Olympic debut at the 1960 Summer Games competitions in the Gulf of Naples and is still one of the fastest racing dinghies in the world.

===People===
Several people have been nicknamed the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;, including Anthony Fokker. Dutch football player Dennis Bergkamp was nicknamed &quot;the Non-Flying Dutchman&quot;, because of his fear of flying. American baseball player Johannes Peter &quot;Honus&quot; Wagner was nicknamed the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; because of his speed and German heritage. Famous Dutch football player Robin van Persie also got the nickname &quot;the Flying Dutchman&quot; after his goal against Spain in the 2014 World Cup because of the way he scored with the header. In the 1970s, the British and American press often dubbed the Dutch rock band Golden Earring &quot;The Flying Dutchmen&quot; because of their exuberant stage act, which included drummer Cesar Zuiderwijk leaping over his drum kit and guitarist George Kooymans performing high jumps. More recently, Dutch Formula 1 driver Max Verstappen is sometimes called &quot;the Flying Dutchman&quot;.

===Horse racing===
The 13th Earl of Eglinton owned a racehorse named The Flying Dutchman.

<text>.de is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Germany. DENIC (the Network Information Centre responsible for .de domains) does not require specific second-level domains, and there are no official ccSLDs under .de ccTLD, as it is the case with the .uk domain range which until 2014 required .co.uk domain for example.

== Namesake ==
The name is based on the first two letters of the German name for Germany (&quot;Deutschland&quot;). Prior to 1990, East Germany had a separate ISO 3166-1 code (&quot;dd&quot;), and had never delegated a ccTLD, .dd.

== Usage ==
.de is currently the second most popular ccTLD in terms of number of registrations with .cn being the first most popular ccTLD and .uk being third. It is third after .com and .cn among all TLDs.

The first point of registration for .de domains was at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Dortmund. &quot;uni-dortmund.de&quot; was among the first registered .de-domains.

.de registrations may be directly ordered from DENIC but it is faster and cheaper to do so via a DENIC member (registrar).

== Registration ==
Previously, domain names had to be at least three letters long. 

There were a few two-letter domains registered before the rule was put in place: db.de (Deutsche Bahn, German Railways), ix.de (the German computing magazine iX), and hq.de. Another domain, bb.de (Bilfinger Berger), was later deregistered (and after 2009 registered by another company). 

As a result of a lawsuit by Volkswagen, which wanted to register the two-letter domain &quot;vw.de&quot;, after 23 October 2009, DENIC was forced to allow the registration of single- and two-letter domains as well as number-only domains, such as 123.de, xx.de or v.de.

Registrations of internationalized domain names (IDN) are also accepted so that all diacritics of German, many diacritics of other languages and the eszett, ß, may be used.

In many of the Romance languages, e.g., Spanish, French, Romanian and Portuguese, &quot;&quot;de&quot; expresses the genitive of a noun (like &quot;of&quot;&quot; in English). This is exploited in domain registrations under the German TLD for romance language webhosts that offer customized sites, like &quot;elforo.de&quot; (theforum.of), encoding the site name into the URL path, such as &quot;elforo.de/wikipedia&quot;, meaning theforum.of/Wikipedia.

<text>Middle Harbour (or Warrin ga), a semi–mature tide dominated drowned valley estuary, is the northern arm of Port Jackson, an inlet of the Tasman Sea located north of Sydney central business district on the coast of New South Wales, Australia.

Middle Harbour has its source in the upper reaches of Garigal National Park where it forms Middle Harbour Creek and flows southeast to become Middle Harbour at Bungaroo and travels for approximately before reaching its mouth at Port Jackson between Grotto Point near Clontarf and Middle Head.

The catchment area of Middle Harbour is approximately .

==Geography==

The shore of Middle Harbour is nearly everywhere rugged, barren and forested and for this reason Middle Harbour was almost entirely neglected during the first two centuries of European settlement in Sydney. There are only a few small patches of flat land on its shores. There are many small creeks draining the surrounding hills, but no significant rivers flow into Middle Harbour.

Within Middle Harbour are, from upstream to downstream, Shell Cove, Pearl Bay, Long Bay, Sugarloaf Bay, Bantry Bay, Fisher Bay, Sandy Bay, Sailors Bay, Powder Hulk Bay, Willoughby Bay and Quakers Hat Bay.

Middle Harbour is a significant physical barrier between Sydney&#x27;s North Shore and the suburbs known as the Northern Beaches area which lie north and east of Middle Harbour.

There are only two bridges – the Spit Bridge and the Roseville Bridge – and because of this obstacle, historically the main transport between Manly and Sydney was by ferry.

Since the 1920s, most of the land on the ridge-tops around Middle Harbour has been developed for suburban housing. Much of the rugged shore of the Middle Harbour remains covered with bushland, most of it now protected by parks and reserves. Middle Harbour is a popular area for recreational boating and fishing.

==History==

Middle Harbour is also extremely significant culturally, spiritually and recreationally to those who live near the water. The harbour is popular amongst fisherman and recreational boaters. An example of the cultural significance of Middle Harbour is highlighted through an odd custom amongst boaters who use the Tunks Park boat ramp in Cammeray. Becoming popular in the late 1980s and 1990s, boaters exiting the 4 knot zone outside of the Cammeray Marina would play &quot;The Old Man Down The Road&quot;, a swamp rock song written by Creedence Clearwater Revival lead singer and guitarist, John Fogerty, on their cassettes. Although the origin of this custom is argued upon by locals, many believe it began with fisherman who sought a way to &quot;burn away the sandman (drowsiness)&quot;. Others believe the term &quot;The Old Man&quot; may refer to an old folk name for the harbour.

<text>Crows Nest is a suburb on the lower North Shore of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It is also part of the North Sydney region, 5 kilometres north of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of North Sydney Council.

==History==
Crows Nest was originally part of a land grant made to Edward Wollstonecraft in 1821. 
The grant extended from the site of the present day Crows Nest to Wollstonecraft. Edward Wollstonecraft built a cottage, the &#x27;Crow&#x27;s Nest&#x27; and, according to his business partner Alexander Berry, chose the name &quot;on account of its elevated and commanding position&quot;.
Berry later built a more substantial Crow&#x27;s Nest House on the estate in 1850, taking the name of the earlier cottage.
This site is now the site of North Sydney Demonstration School. The gates of Crows Nest House (added in the 1880s) still stand at the Pacific Highway entrance to the school. Berry died at Crows Nest House on 30 November 1873.

== Heritage listings ==
Crows Nest has some heritage-listed sites, including:
* 23 Albany Street: Electricity Power House

==St Thomas Rest Park==
St Thomas Rest Park, located in West Street, was originally the cemetery of St Thomas&#x27;s Church. It was the first burial ground established on Sydney&#x27;s north shore. The land for the cemetery was donated to the Anglican Parish of St Leonards in 1845 by the prominent landowner and merchant, Alexander Berry. Notable people buried there include Alexander Berry and George Barney. Alexander Berry was buried there with his wife, in 1873, when he died at the age of 92. They are interred in an unusual, pyramid-shaped tomb with his wife&#x27;s brother, Edward Wollstonecraft, former owner of Crows Nest Farm, after which the area is named. George Barney (lieutenant colonel) was born in London in 1792, and arrived in Sydney in 1835. He held a number of posts, including Commander of the Royal Engineers, and he designed Victoria Barracks. He was responsible for the completion of Fort Denison, Circular Quay, Cockatoo Dock and Darlinghurst Gaol.

The park includes the original Sexton&#x27;s Cottage, which is now used as a museum of local history, and is heritage-listed.

==Population==
At the 2021 census, there were 4,974 residents in Crows Nest. 57.0% of residents were born in Australia. The other most common countries of birth were England 5.6%, New Zealand 3.2%, China 3.1%, India 2.3% and Japan 1.8%. 71.5% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 3.9%, Cantonese 2.9%, Japanese 2.1%, Spanish 1.8% and French 1.3%. The most common responses for religious affiliation were No Religion 49.7% and Catholic 20.7%, Anglican 8.0%, 5.1% of residents did not state their religion, and 2.9% practised Buddhism.

The median age recorded at the 2021 census was 36. 36.0% of people were in the 25-39 year age group, compared to 21.5% nationally. The most common ancestries were English 32.9%, Australian 24.5%, Irish 12.5%, Chinese 10.9% and Scottish 10.4%.

==Commercial area==
Crows Nest is a significant commercial district which is noted for its variety of shops and restaurants. It is centred on the junction of five main roads about 1 kilometre north by northwest of the original site of Crows Nest House.

==Transport==
The Warringah Freeway runs along the northern border of Crows Nest and the Pacific Highway is a major road along the western border. Crows Nest railway station is a Sydney Metro station part of the Sydney Metro City &amp; Southwest line, opened on 19 August 2024.

<text>How the Other Half Lives: Studies among the Tenements of New York (1890) is an early publication of photojournalism by Jacob Riis, documenting squalid living conditions in New York City slums in the 1880s. The photographs served as a basis for future &quot;muckraking&quot; journalism by exposing the slums to New York City&#x27;s upper and middle classes. They inspired many reforms of working-class housing, both immediately after publication as well as making a lasting impact in today&#x27;s society.

==Background==
===19th century, New York City===
In the 1880s many people in upper- and middle-class society were unaware of the dangerous conditions in the slums among poor immigrants. After the Civil War, the country transformed into an industrial superpower and became largely urban. Simultaneously, a wave of unskilled southern European, eastern European, and Asian immigrants came to settle in the &quot;promised land&quot; of the United States. This migration was vastly different from the previous booms due to the influx of non-western European and non-Protestant individuals, which made the split between the &quot;new&quot; and &quot;old&quot; immigrants much larger. In the 1880s, over 5.2 million immigrants came to the United States, with many of these people staying in New York City. This increased New York City&#x27;s population by 25%, therefore making the tenement problem much more extreme.
In the years after the Civil War, many of the former residents of the most notorious slums were wealthy enough to move out of these conditions, or had died in the war. Also, the elevated railway in the Bowery in 1889 transformed this evolving neighborhood back into the squalid, seedy neighborhood it was before the war, and even made it worse.

The slums were viewed as a problem by people before the publication of &quot;How the Other Half-Lives&quot;. Some political reformers believed that a wider distribution of wealth would fix the problem, while the Socialists believed that public ownership and a redistribution of wealth would fix the problem. National organizations such as the American Red Cross, The National Conference of Charities and Corrections, and the Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union were involved in different aspects of the slum problem, but these efforts were local in scope instead of national.

===Tenements===

By 1865, a total of 15,309 tenements existed in New York City, and the city&#x27;s population was approaching 1,000,000. It was colloquially known to be a housing type for the poor made for maximum densities, within the constraints of a 25-by-100-foot (8-by-30-metre) lot. When the Tenement House Act of 1867 was passed, the tenement was defined as:

Any house, building, or portion thereof, which is rented, leased, let or hired out to be occupied or is occupied, as the home or residence of more than three families living independently of one another and doing their own cooking upon the premises, or by more than two families upon a floor, so living and cooking and having a common right in the halls, stairways, yards, water-closets, or privies, or some of them. 

It was with the publication of this act that the basic &quot;dumbbell&quot; layout of the tenement was first used. This tenement style was supposed to allow more natural light and air ventilation into these living quarters, as well as adding more water closets and allowing for the fire safety regulations explained in the Tenement House Act of 1867.

On top of this, many of the landlords of these tenements did little to improve their conditions. When asked about the enforcement of the new statutes, the Superintendent of Buildings said that he was satisfied with hard wood in these tenements because it &quot;burned slowly.&quot;

==Jacob Riis==

Jacob Riis emigrated from Denmark in 1870 to New York City, eager to prove himself. Finding it difficult to find work, he found a home in the slums of New York&#x27;s Lower East Side. He went back to Denmark for a short time, returning to New York to become a police reporter. During this time, Riis became a devout Christian and devoted himself to &quot;the service of God and his fellows.&quot;

Riis turned to photography as a sort of &quot;pastime&quot; and found it a useful tool when writing his police reports. Once he began using magnesium flash powder, he could capture the dark and dingy conditions of the tenements.

&quot;How the Other Half-Lives&quot; was only one book in Riis&#x27; bibliography highlighting the conditions in the slums of New York. Some of his other works that highlighted more in depth views into slum life were &quot;The Children of the Poor,&quot; &quot;Children of the Tenements&quot;, &quot;The Battle with the Slums&quot;, and &quot;Out of Mulberry Street&quot;.

==Summary==

In January 1888, Riis bought a detective camera and went on an expedition to gather images of what life was like in the slums of New York City. This both included Riis&#x27; taking his own photos as well as his using the images of other photographers. Finally, on January 28, 1888, Riis presented &quot;The Other Half: How It Lives and Dies in New York&quot; using his images on a projection screen and taking the viewer on a journey by describing the images. Throughout 1888, Riis continued his lectures in local New York City churches, which were reviewed in several newspapers including &quot;New York Sun&quot;, &quot;Brooklyn Times&quot;, &quot;New York Evening Post&quot;, and &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;.

In February 1889, Riis wrote a magazine article based on his lectures in &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, which was a resounding success. The book version of Riis&#x27; work was published in January 1890 as &quot;How the Other Half Lives: Studies among the Tenements of New York&quot;.

The title of the book is a reference to a sentence by French writer François Rabelais, who wrote in &quot;Pantagruel&quot;: &quot;one half of the world does not know how the other half lives&quot; (&quot;la moitié du monde ne sait comment l&#x27;autre vit&quot;).

&quot;How the Other Half Lives: Studies among the Tenements of New York&quot; explained the living conditions in New York slums as well as the sweatshops in some tenements, which paid workers only a few cents per day. The book explains the plight of working children; they would work in factories and at other jobs. Some children became garment workers and newsies (newsboys).

Riis describes a system of tenement housing that had failed, as he claims, because of greed and neglect from wealthier people. He claims a correlation between the high crime rate, drunkenness, and reckless behavior of the poor and their lack of a proper home. Chapter by chapter he uses his words and photographs to expose the conditions inhabited by the poor in a manner that &quot;spoke directly to people&#x27;s hearts&quot;.

While Riis treats many of the ethnic groups he encounters with slurs and numerous stereotypes, he still keeps his general hypothesis that the reason for the poverty in these communities is caused by the conditions surrounding them. Riis often does have an &quot;ethnic hierarchy,&quot; often its most extreme toward the Chinese.

Riis ends &quot;How the Other Half Lives&quot; with a plan of how to fix the problem. He asserts that the plan is achievable and that the upper classes will not only profit financially from such ventures, but have a moral obligation to tend to them as well.

&quot;How the Other Half Lives&quot; follows a general outline for the charity writings of the nineteenth century: a section on crime, the Protestant virtues and vices (intemperance, idleness, disorder, uncleanliness), miserable conditions of living, disease, the loss of modesty (especially women), the dissolution of the family, the institutions that would help in their uplift, as well as future sources of reform. The difference introduced photography to prove the squalid conditions and to increase sympathy for the individuals living in these slums. Riis finally convinced the average reader of newspapers that the poor were not so by choice; that the dangerous and unhygienic conditions in which they lived were imposed by society, rather than the result of loose moral standards; that the slums were something that needed to be fixed rather than gaped at or shunned.

==Critical reception==
===After publication===

The article proved to be popular, and Riis spent the better part of a year expanding it into the book published by Scribner&#x27;s Books in 1890. It offered more illustrations and halftones than the magazine articles could offer.

The book was successful. Soon after its publication, &quot;The New York Times&quot; lauded its content, calling it a &quot;powerful book&quot;. The praise for &quot;How the Other Half Lives&quot; continued in many other newspapers across the country. Many of these enthusiastic reviews were seen in Christian newsletters, which enjoyed Riis&#x27; view on the moral issues of poverty. &quot;The Christian Intelligencer&quot; reviewed the first edition saying &quot;Books like this that lift the curtains and expose to public gaze the great evils of the system will hasten the day of reform.&quot; Many of these Christian reviewers found Riis&#x27; work to apply their own cities, and called for similar reforms that Riis outlines in &quot;How the Other Half Lives&quot;.

One of the most famous people who liked Riis&#x27; work was Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt became close to Riis during the former&#x27;s two years as the President of the Police Board. Roosevelt and Riis worked together to abolish police lodging houses, as well as the reenactment of the Civil Service Law, the Tenement House Commission, laws that increased the amount of factory inspectors, making the eight-hour and prevailing rate of wages law effective, regulation of the working hours of women and children, as well as multiple other labor reforms.

===Lasting impact===
Because of this awakening caused by Riis&#x27; efforts, many reforms were quickly compiled to improve conditions for the working poor. In 1894, the Tenement House Committee was established. In 1895, they published the New York Tenement House Act, which outlawed rear tenements, and also was the first official document to supplement a written description of tenement housing with photographs. In addition to this legislature, more reform was brought about by the New York Tenement House Act of 1901, which changed the minimum requirements of tenement housing to include reforms in the amount of light received by living quarters, increased fire safety regulations, more ventilation, restrictions on building height, and increased room space. For these reforms, Riis has almost been given full credit for inspiring these acts, especially the Act of 1901. Because of his poignant descriptions of the degradation of Mulberry Bend, this area was razed and replaced with a city park.

&quot;How the Other Half Lives&quot; also inspired reform on a national scale. The Department of Labor published &quot;The Housing of the Working People&quot; in 1895, which was the second major tenement study of the decade.

Jacob Riis was only the first to expose the conditions that the impoverished lived in using photographs. Some other works that detailed life in poverty were the images of the migrants during the Dust Bowl commissioned by the Farm Security Administration by Dorothea Lange; &quot;The Other America&quot; by Michael Harrington; and &quot;The American Way of Poverty: How the Other Half Still Lives&quot; by Sasha Abramsky.

<text>Stephan G. Stephansson (October 3, 1853 – August 10, 1927) was a Western Icelander, poet, and farmer. His given name was Stefán Guðmundur Guðmundsson.

He was born in Skagafjörður, Iceland but immigrated to Wisconsin, United States in 1873, at age 19. In 1889 he moved to Markerville, Red Deer County, Alberta, Canada. He did not see Iceland again until 1917, when he was 64 years old.

Stephan was self-educated and worked hard all his life. He wrote after work, and, being an insomniac, he often wrote till dawn. He was under the influence of the American writer Ralph Waldo Emerson and they shared the same beliefs in many matters, including equal rights for men and women. Stephan wrote only in Icelandic and had great influence in his home country.

His poems were published in a six volume book called &quot;Andvökur&quot; (Wakeful Nights).

His letters and essays were published in four volumes, and even if nothing of his poetry had survived, those would have been enough to single him out as one of Iceland&#x27;s foremost men of letters.

==Legacy==
His homestead near Markerville is an Alberta Provincial Historic Site. It has been restored and is open to the public from May 15 until August 31.

The Stephan G. Stephansson Award is named in his honor and awarded annually by the Writers Guild of Alberta.

In 1984 folk artist Richard White released an album of Stephansson poems sung in English translation and set to original music called &quot;Sun Over Darkness Prevail&quot;.

<doc id="717277" wikidata="Q3438976" url="?curid=717277" title="Greater Western Sydney">
<text>Greater Western Sydney (GWS) is a large region of the metropolitan area of Greater Sydney, New South Wales (NSW), Australia that generally embraces the north-west, south-west, central-west, far western and the Blue Mountains sub-regions within Sydney&#x27;s metropolitan area and encompasses 11 local government areas: Blacktown, Blue Mountains, Camden, Campbelltown, Cumberland, Fairfield, Hawkesbury, Liverpool, Parramatta, Penrith and Wollondilly. It includes Western Sydney, which has a number of different definitions, although the one consistently used is the region composed of ten local government authorities, most of which are members of the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils (WSROC). The NSW Government&#x27;s Office of Western Sydney calls the region &quot;Greater Western Sydney&quot;.

Radiocarbon dating suggests human activity occurred in the Sydney metropolitan area from around 30,000 years ago. The Darug people lived in the area that was greater western Sydney before European settlement regarded the region as rich in food from the river and forests. Parramatta was founded in 1788, the same year as Sydney, making it the second oldest city in Australia. Opened in 1811, Parramatta Road, which navigates into the heart of greater western Sydney, is one of Sydney&#x27;s oldest roads and Australia&#x27;s first highway between two cities – Sydney central business district (CBD) and Parramatta, which is now the sixth largest business district in Australia. Rapid population increase after World War II saw the settlement of many ex-service men and migrants in the greater west, making it one of the most urbanised regions in the country and an area of growing national importance.

Being the third largest economy in Australia, behind Sydney CBD and Melbourne, the region covers and is one of the fastest growing populations in Australia, with an estimated resident population of 2,288,554 in 2017. Western Sydney has the most multicultural suburbs in the country with 38% of the population speaking a language other than English at home, and up to 90% in some suburbs. Containing about 9% of Australia&#x27;s population and 44% of Sydney&#x27;s population, the people of GWS are predominantly of a working class background, with major employment in the heavy industries and vocational trade.

Encompassing significant areas of national parks, waterways and parklands, agricultural lands, natural bushland and a range of recreational and sporting facilities, the region also largely contains remnants of critically endangered native Cumberland Plain Bushland and World Heritage-listed areas of the Blue Mountains. The Hawkesbury and Nepean River system is Sydney&#x27;s firsthand water source and the mainstay of the region&#x27;s agricultural and fishing industries, and is also major recreational area for the inhabitants of GWS. The heritage-listed Warragamba Dam, the primary reservoir for water supply for Sydney, is located in the greater west.

==History==
===Indigenous settlement===
Near Penrith, numerous Aboriginal stone tools were found in Cranebrook Terraces gravel sediments dating to 50,000–45,000 BP. For more than 30,000 years, Aboriginal people from the Gandangara tribe have lived in the Fairfield area. Prior to the arrival of the Europeans, the Penrith area was home to the Mulgoa tribe of the Dharug people, who spoke the Dharug language. They lived in makeshift huts called &quot;gunyahs&quot;, hunted native animals such as kangaroos, and fished in the Nepean River. The Auburn area was once used by Dharug people as a market place for the exchange of goods between them and Dharawal people on the coast. The area that later became Campbelltown was inhabited prior to European settlement by the Tharawal people. For more than 30,000 years, Aboriginal people from the Gandangara tribe have lived in the Fairfield area. The people of what is now known as Carlingford, a suburb on the eastern peripheries of the greater west, were the Wallumedegal people, who practised fire-stick farming along the northern banks of the Parramatta River, which encouraged animals to graze, thus enhancing the ease of hunting and gathering. Most of the natives died due to introduced diseases, such as smallpox, following the arrival of the First Fleet, and the remainder were largely relocated to government farms and a series of settlements.

===British colony===
In 1788, Governor Arthur Phillip had reconnoitred several places before choosing Parramatta as the most likely place for a successful large farm, making it the second European settlement in Australia, after Sydney. Old Toongabbie was established in the same year. The Sydney Cove region originally settled in 1788 turned out to be unsuitable for farming, and after a number of years of near-famine in the colony, efforts were made to relocate food production inland to hopefully more climatically stable regions. Phillip sent exploratory missions in search of better soils and fixed on the Parramatta region as a promising area for expansion and moved many of the convicts from late 1788 to establish a small township, which became the main centre of the colony&#x27;s economic life. Nevertheless, poor equipment and unfamiliar soils and climate continued to hamper the expansion of farming from Farm Cove to Parramatta and Toongabbie.

In February 1793, the Auburn area was established as the first free-agricultural settlement thanks to Governor Phillip&#x27;s repeated applications to the British government for free settlers, and by the end of that decade Prospect, West Pennant Hills, Baulkham Hills and Greystanes were established. Eighteen months after the landing of the First Fleet, an exploring party led by Captain Watkin Tench set out to further findings made by Governor Phillip where, in 1789, they discovered the broad expanse of the Nepean River and Penrith. Windsor Road, one of the oldest roads in Sydney, was opened in 1794. In 1795, Matthew Flinders and George Bass explored up the Georges River for about 20 miles beyond what had been previously surveyed, and reported favourably to Governor John Hunter of the land on its banks. The earliest recorded white settlement in the Fairfield district is described in William Bradley&#x27;s Journal where he noted an expedition from Rose Hill to Prospect Creek to determine whether Prospect Creek led to Botany Bay.

The Battle of Parramatta, a major battle of the Hawkesbury and Nepean Wars, occurred in March 1797 where resistance leader Pemulwuy led a group of Bidjigal warriors, estimated to be at least 100, in an attack on a government farm at Toongabbie, challenging the British Army to fight. On 4 March 1804 Irish convicts rose up in Rouse Hill as one, in what was to become known as the Castle Hill convict rebellion.

Governor Lachlan Macquarie and Mrs Macquarie preferred the clean air of rural Parramatta to the unsanitary and crime-ridden streets of Sydney and transformed Old Government House, Parramatta, into an elegant Palladian-style home in the English manner. Originally constructed under Governor Hunter in 1799 to reflect the economic importance of the Parramatta district, the building remains today Australia&#x27;s oldest public building and was given World Heritage Listing by UNESCO in 2010.

In 1803 a government stock farm was established in what was to become the Riverstone/Marsden Park area, on the basis of the abundant water supply and good grazing land there, and also in Smithfield, due to its good soil and dependable water supply. Windsor is the fourth-oldest place of British settlement on the Australian continent, where European settlers utilised the fertile river flats for agriculture. Governor Phillip Gidley King began granting land in the area to settlers in 1804 with Captain Daniel Woodriff&#x27;s on the banks of the river the first land grant in the area.

===Urban development===

Liverpool Hospital was founded on a portion of land beside the Georges River, making it the second oldest hospital in Australia. Fairfield railway station was opened in 1856 and has the oldest surviving railway building in New South Wales. Quarrying in the Prospect area began in the 1820s and naturalist Charles Darwin visited Prospect Hill in January 1836, to observe the geology. Designed and constructed by the NSW Public Works Department, Prospect Reservoir was built as Sydney&#x27;s main water supply in the 1880s. The Upper Nepean Scheme was commenced in 1880 after it was realised that the Botany Swamps scheme was insufficient to meet Sydney&#x27;s water supply needs. By the latter part of the nineteenth century coarse-grained picrite, and other dolorite rock types were being extracted from William Lawson&#x27;s estate on the west and north sides of Prospect Hill.

Lansvale was a popular recreational site of the early 20th century due to its waterways and meadows. During World War II, Bankstown Airport was established as a key strategic air base to support the war effort and the control of Bankstown Airport was handed to US Forces. Campbelltown was designated in the early 1960s as a satellite city by the New South Wales Planning Authority, and a regional capital for the south west of Sydney. Until the 1950s, Liverpool was still a satellite town with an agricultural economy based on poultry farming and market gardening. However the urban sprawl of Sydney across the Cumberland Plain soon reached Liverpool, and it became an outer suburb of metropolitan Sydney with a strong working-class presence and manufacturing facilities. In the 1950s and 1960s, there was a large amount of suburban development both in the current suburb of Blacktown and the new suburbs that sprung up around it, which led to civic development in the town centre with the Blacktown Hospital opening in 1965.

===Migrant communities===
In the 1960s and 1970s, migration from south-east Asia as a result of the Vietnam War transformed Cabramatta into a thriving Asian community. Also in the 1970s, an influx of Middle Eastern immigrants, namely Lebanese people, settled in Lidcombe, Bankstown and the surrounding suburbs. Opened in December 1985, in Eastern Creek, Wonderland Sydney was the largest amusement park in the southern hemisphere until its closure in 2004. In 2015, the Abbott government granted 12,000 extra humanitarian visas to persecuted Christians, largely the Assyrians, in the war-torn Middle Eastern countries, which were admitted to Australia as part of its one-off humanitarian intake, with half of them primarily settling in Fairfield and also Liverpool.

== Geography ==
===Topography===
The Greater Western Sydney region spans from Windsor in the north to Campbelltown in the south, Lidcombe and Roselands in the east, with the A3 creating the boundary between the greater west and inner West, to Penrith and the lower parts of the Blue Mountains in the far west. The 151st meridian east passes through the heart of western Sydney, namely in the suburbs of Castle Hill, Parramatta, Granville, and Revesby, with the suburbs west of those being on the eastern end of the 150th meridian, which is a line that passes through the Russian city of Magadan in the northern hemisphere.

In 1820s, Peter Cunningham described the country west of Parramatta and Liverpool as &quot;a fine timbered country, perfectly clear of bush, through which you might, generally speaking, drive a gig in all directions, without any impediment in the shape of rocks, scrubs, or close forest&quot;. This confirmed earlier accounts by Governor Arthur Phillip, who suggested that the trees were &quot;growing at a distance of some twenty to forty feet from each other, and in general entirely free from brushwood...&quot; 

Greater western Sydney predominantly lies on the Cumberland Plain and is relatively flat in contrast to the above regions. The region is situated on a rain shadow, due to the Hills District to the northeast, where it tends to be drier than the coast and less lush than the hilly Northern Suburbs. Though Wetherill Park was listed by &quot;Domain&quot; as one of the five most leafiest suburbs in Sydney, in addition to being the only suburb in Western Sydney to be listed as such.

Although the region is relatively flat, several elevated areas on the plain exist — Western Sydney Parklands, one of the largest parklands in the world, and Prospect Hill, the only area in Sydney with ancient volcanic activity, are between high. Highly elevated suburbs, which typically range between in height, include Leppington and Oran Park to the southwest, Pemulwuy, Cecil Hills and Horsley Park to the greater west, and Greystanes, Seven Hills and Mount Druitt to the northwest.

===Ecology===
The main plant communities in the Greater Western Sydney region are sclerophyll grassy woodlands (i.e. savannas), dry sclerophyll forests and small pockets of wet sclerophyll forests to the northeast as one approaches the Hornsby Plateau. The grassy woodlands contain eucalyptus trees which are usually in open woodlands that have sclerophyllous shrubs and sparse grass in the understory, reminiscent of Mediterranean forests. It has been calculated that around 98,000 hectares of native vegetation remains in the Sydney metropolitan area, about half of what is likely to have been existing at the time of European arrival.

The endemic flora is home to a variety of bird, insect, reptile and mammal species, which are conspicuous in urban areas. Introduced birds such as the house sparrow, common myna and feral pigeon are ubiquitous in the CBD areas of Sydney. Possums, bandicoots, rabbits, feral cats, lizards, snakes and frogs may also be present in the urban environment, albeit seldom in city centres.

===Geology===
The Sydney area lies on Triassic shales and sandstones with low rolling hills and wide valleys in a rain shadow area. Sydney sprawls over two major regions: the Cumberland Plain, a relatively flat region lying to the west of Sydney Harbour, and the Hornsby Plateau, a plateau north of the Harbour rising to 200 metres and dissected by steep valleys. Sydney&#x27;s native plant species are predominantly eucalyptus trees. The moderately-fertile Soils in western Sydney are usually red and yellow in texture as they are rich in clay, are fine-textured and acidic. Soil moisture is relatively high through the months reaching a peak in winter (due to the lower evaporation rate), despite the lower rainfall in that season.

At a time in the past, monocline formed to the west of Sydney. The monocline is a sloping bend that raises the sandstone well above where it is expected to be seen, and this is why the whole of the visible top of the Blue Mountains is made of sandstone. Sandstone slopes in the Sydney area are on three sides: to the west the Blue Mountains, and to the north and south, the Hornsby and Woronora plateau. The centre of the Sydney basin is located beneath Fairfield. Bringelly Shale and Minchinbury Sandstone are often seen in the greater western parts of Sydney, which are part of the Wianamatta Shale group. The Prospect dolerite intrusion in Pemulwuy is the largest assemblage of igneous rock in Sydney. The oval-shaped ridge was made many millions of years ago when volcanic material from the Earth&#x27;s upper mantle moved upwards and then sideways.

Swamps and lagoons are existent on the floodplain of the Nepean River, one being Bents Basin, which is also a recreational area. Parramatta River drains a large area of Sydney&#x27;s western suburbs. With 5,005,400 inhabitants (as of 2016) and an urban population density of 2037 people per square kilometre, Sydney&#x27;s urban area covers , comprising 35% of Sydney and is constantly growing. The south and southwest of Sydney is drained by the Georges River, flowing north from its source near Appin, towards Liverpool and then turning east towards Botany Bay. Minor waterways draining Sydney&#x27;s western suburbs include South Creek and Eastern Creek, flowing into the Hawkesbury, and Prospect Creek draining into the Georges River. Cowan Creek and Berowra Creek run north from the Upper North Shore to the Hawkesbury river.

== Climate ==

Western Sydney experiences a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfa&quot;) with the annual temperatures having an average maximum of and a minimum of , making the region a few degrees warmer than the Sydney CBD. Maximum summer temperatures average at around and winter temperatures are mild, averaging at around , depending on the location. Autumn and spring are the transitional seasons, with spring showing a larger variation than autumn in terms of temperatures.

Rainfall is almost evenly spread throughout the year, although the first few months tend to be wetter, namely February through to April. The months from July through to December tend to be drier (late winter through to early summers). Thunderstorms are common in late summer and early autumn. Winters are pleasantly cool and relatively sunny (especially August), although east coast lows can bring large amounts of rainfall, especially in June. Most suburbs in the west have an annual precipitation that averages at around , in contrast to Sydney CBD&#x27;s .

Sydney usually experiences a föhn effect that originates from the Great Dividing Range, where the lifting of winds on the windward side of the Blue Mountains forces the air to gradually warm up and lose moisture as the winds descend into the Sydney basin. They may exacerbate fire danger in the warm months, although they usually tend to occur between late winter and early spring when westerly cold fronts become more frequent and would therefore be blocked by the ranges – This phenomenon thereby permits the late winter and early spring period to feature the highest amount of clear days in the year. It should be worth noting that Richmond features the greatest temperature range ever recorded in Australia; to .
;Summer
Western Sydney is much warmer than Sydney city in summer. During this time, daytime temperatures can be warmer than the city (in extreme cases the West can even be hotter). This is because sea breezes in the City do not penetrate the inland areas. Northwesterlies occasionally bring hot winds from the desert that raise temperatures as high as . Though southerly busters may still end the hot conditions. The humidity in the summer is usually in the comfortable range, though some days can be slightly humid (due to the ocean proximity) or very dry (due to the heat from the desert). 

;Autumn
In early autumn, hot days are possible, with temperatures above possible in March, but quite rare. April is cooler, with days above happening on average only 1.1 times during the month. Days cooler than occur more regularly leading into May. In May, days are usually mild, ranging from , but can get quite cold, with maximums of or lower starting to occur. Average minimums fall throughout the season, with the first night below often occurring in April.

;Winter
Winter temperatures often show a higher variation in late winter than early winter, with a day in August rarely reaching above , which is unknown in June and July. Winter daytime average around between . Winter nights average , although a few nights per year see temperatures fall below , mostly in July. Nights reaching below more often occur in the far-western suburbs, such as Campbelltown, Camden, Penrith and Richmond. These low temperatures often occur when the night sky is clear and the ground can radiate heat back into the atmosphere. Winter nights, though, are typically a few degrees cooler and frost is not uncommon in some areas, especially those in the far west such as Penrith and Richmond.

;Spring
Spring temperatures are highly variable, with temperatures fluctuating quite often. September will normally see 1 day reaching above , and extremely rare, above . Cool days in September can occur, occasionally failing to reach . October and November show high variability, where hot north-westerlies can cause temperatures to rise above , and even above in November, while cool days below are also quite common. The average minimum temperature increases throughout the season, September can still have nights falling below . October and November occasionally have nights falling below .

==Demographics==
===Languages===

The residents of GWS come from more than 170 countries and speak over 100 different languages and 12% of them, namely the newcomers, do not speak English very well. Cabramatta is made up of 87.7% of people from non-English speaking backgrounds, the highest anywhere in Australia (excluding remote indigenous communities). Other Western Sydney suburbs, such as Fairfield, Bankstown and Canley Vale, are also over 80%.

Although many of these communities are Australian-born (including Arabic speakers, with about 50% born therein), Western Sydney still is the main centre of Australian migration, with 60% of new arrivals settling in greater western Sydney in between 2006 and 2011, with the majority coming from India, China, Iraq, the Philippines and Vietnam. Furthermore, GWS also has more Indigenous Australian residents than either South Australia or Victoria, making it the largest indigenous community in Australia. These are some of the largest population groups of Australia&#x27;s non-English speakers found in Western Sydney:

*62% of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic speakers
*50% of Akan speakers
*48% of Lao speakers
*45% of Arabic speakers
*43% of Kurdish speakers
*37% of Tongan speakers
*34% of Samoan speakers
*33% of Hindi speakers
*29% of Vietnamese
*28% of Filipino/Tagalog speakers
*28% of Tamil speakers
*27% of Maltese speakers

===Religion===
Western Sydney is the most religious and socially conservative region in Sydney. Previously, the districts of Ku-ring-gai, Hornsby Shire and The Hills Shire in the north were the most religious areas in Sydney, and were formerly known as being part of Sydney&#x27;s &quot;bible belt&quot;. Today however, the western suburbs have become Sydney&#x27;s so-called believer belt, with a high proportion of believers found in a band of suburbs that span the cities of Liverpool, Fairfield, Cumberland and Canterbury-Bankstown.

According to the Bureau of Statistics, areas with the highest percentage of Christians were found in the western and south-western suburbs such as, Bossley Park (85%), Grasmere (82.3%), Theresa Park (81.1%), Abbotsbury (81%) and Horsley Park (79.6%), with the most popular denominations being Catholic and Anglican, respectively. The suburbs east of those, in the City of Canterbury-Bankstown and Camden Council, had a high amount of Islamic adherents, such as Lakemba (59.2%), South Granville (49%) and Old Guildford (45.9%).

Buddhism was the common response in the suburbs of Cabramatta, Canley Vale and Canley Heights, with 43.0%, 37.1% and 38.4% adhering to it, respectively. In Harris Park, to the northwest, Hinduism was the common religion with 44.8% of its inhabitants practicing it. Westmead (40.8%), Parramatta (28.5%) and Rosehill (24.0%) also had Hinduism as the most common faith.

===Society===
The region&#x27;s major city centre is Parramatta, and the rest of the LGAs are growing immensely when it comes population, economic opportunity and environmental diversity. In the early 2010s, urban development has occurred in places like Camden, Campbelltown and Penrith, while Parramatta and Blacktown have grown rapidly. The GWS region overall grew at 2.1% in 2014 and 1.6% p.a. for the past decade. The South-West, such as, Leppington, spanning Liverpool, Camden and Campbelltown councils, had higher number of families. The region&#x27;s population is projected to reach 3 million by 2036. The more recent suburban developments tend to be less leafy than more established Sydney neighbourhoods.

Home to around 1 in every 11 Australians, the 2 million inhabitants of GWS live in 743,940 dwellings with an average household size of 3.02. While Sydney CBD and the Inner West mostly consist of federation-era homes, the west usually features larger modern homes, which are predominantly found in the outer, newer suburbs, starting from the City of Fairfield and Blacktown and including Stanhope Gardens, Kellyville Ridge, and Bella Vista to the northwest, Bossley Park, Abbotsbury, and Cecil Hills to the west, and Hoxton Park, Harrington Park, and Oran Park to the southwest.

High school retention rates for years 7 to 12 are the lowest in the Sydney metropolitan area, recording 69.5% compared to 95.2% in Northern Sydney. In 2009, twice as many people in GWS aged 15 or older hadn&#x27;t attended school at all compared to the rest of Sydney and NSW. The region has strong automobile dependency with consequent effects on air quality, health, quality of life and household budgets.

===Regions===
The Department of Planning and Infrastructure Metropolitan Strategy for Sydney divides Greater Western Sydney into three sub-regions:

====Western Sydney====
Western Sydney as defined by the WSROC region covers and had an estimated resident population as at 30 June 2008 of 1,665,673. The region comprises the areas administered by the Blacktown City Council, Blue Mountains City Council, City of Canterbury-Bankstown, Cumberland Council, Fairfield City Council, Hawkesbury City Council, Hills Shire Council, Liverpool City Council, City of Parramatta Council, and the Penrith City Council.

Western Sydney is also sometimes used to refer to the whole Greater Western Sydney region, which is the combination of Western Sydney as defined above and the Macarthur Region (also referred to as South-western Sydney). As well as the ten councils listed above, the GWS region includes Camden Council, Campbelltown City Council and Wollondilly Shire Council.

==Economy==
With more than 240,000 local businesses which generated more than $95 billion gross regional product in 2009, Western Sydney is a diverse area when it comes to socio-economics, with the two largest industries in the region being manufacturing and construction. Of the 544,000 jobs situated in the GWS, 75% of those who live in the region also work there. The Smithfield–Wetherill Park Industrial Estate is the largest industrial estate in the southern hemisphere and is the centre of manufacturing and distribution in GWS. Lying strategically between the major population growth zones in the north-west and south-west of Sydney, it contains more than 1,000 manufacturing, wholesale, transport and service firms which employ more than 20,000 persons.

While overall a lower income area for Sydney, with families who are dependent on childcare as both parents work, and higher than average unemployment and lower than average salary levels, Western Sydney has some exceedingly high income suburbs nonetheless. Namely, the suburb of The Ponds, in the City of Blacktown, which is the most highly advantaged suburb in NSW on the SEIFA index of advantage-disadvantage, ahead of suburbs on the North Shore, such as St Ives and Avalon. 

Other affluent suburbs in western Sydney, ranging from upper middle class to upper class neighbourhoods, include, Acacia Gardens, Bella Vista, Castle Hill, Cherrybrook, Pemulwuy, Rouse Hill, Schofields, Edmondson Park, Beaumont Hills, Glenmore Park, Cecil Hills, Elizabeth Hills, Middleton Grange, Carnes Hill, Oran Park, Leppington and Spring Farm, among others.

Lower middle class and working class neighbourhoods are mainly concentrated near the heart of the central business district areas of Fairfield, Mount Druitt, Guildford, Cabramatta, Merrylands, Rosehill, Granville, Canley Vale and Auburn. Yennora is known to be the most poorest suburb of western Sydney overall, where the median personal income is just $19,000, followed by Landsdowne, Blairmount, Wiley Park, Campsie, Roselands, Carramar, Villawood and Punchbowl. Furthmore, Claymore in the southwest was listed as one of the most socially disadvantaged areas in New South Wales. Nonetheless, the rest of the GWS region is generally made up of a middle class population, with such even found in both affluent and low income suburbs.

===Livability===
Due to Parramatta&#x27;s emergence as &quot;Sydney&#x27;s second CBD&quot;, livability in the surrounding western suburbs has been advancing, with Harris Park being 63rd most liveable area by Domain Group, followed by Parramatta at 110 and Rosehill at 187. Further to the west, Penrith warranted a spot in the top 200 suburbs of the 555 on the list. Seven of the top ten suburbs for home purchasers were more than west of the Sydney CBD, which included areas with high construction activity such as Baulkham Hills, Castle Hill, Liverpool and Blacktown, which has become Sydney&#x27;s most popular area for home buyers, with more sales than any other suburb.

This is mainly due to the immense cultural activities and high affordability in the region, and also the development of new restaurants, high-rise apartments, telecommunications, local employment, retail and education. Regarding this, &quot;Allworth Homes&quot; director Stephen Thompson states, &quot;While the outskirts of Sydney were once considered undesirable, improved infrastructure coupled with soaring house prices has meant many property seekers are looking further afield for their homes, including high-income earners&quot;. With Western Sydney Airport opening in the mid 2020s, Penrith is slated to become another CBD, with the airport creating 35,000 jobs by 2035.

===Agriculture===

Agriculture is mainly concentrated in the outskirts of the Greater Western Sydney area, such as in suburbs of Kemps Creek, Mount Vernon, Mulgoa, Bringelly, Silverdale, Orchard Hills, Luddenham and Horsley Park, among others, which lie in a countryside adjacent to the footsteps of the Blue Mountains westwards of these country plains. Abbotsbury, Cecil Hills and Glenmore Park were farms through until the 1980s when it was decided to redevelop them for housing. The area around the site of Regentville has remained largely rural, if hemmed in somewhat by the modern residential suburbs of Jamisontown and Glenmore Park.

In the 1800s, John Blaxland built an original wooden weir at &quot;Grove Farm&quot; (now known as Wallacia) for a sandstone flour mill and additional brewery. The land was also used for wheat farming until 1861 when wheat rust infected the entire crop. The rural regions were chiefly one of dairying and grazing during the 19th century, but in the early 20th century – because of its rural atmosphere and proximity to Sydney – tourism developed as people opened their homes as guest houses. Today, the rural areas include a number of orchards and vineyards in the meadows. Vegetable farming and fruit picking are common activities.

==Transport==
 Railway lines in Greater Western Sydney include the Main Western railway line, Main Southern railway line, Bankstown railway line, Richmond railway line, Main Suburban railway line, East Hills railway line and Old Main South railway line, connecting the region to central Sydney. The region is also served by several bus operators. Sydney Metro&#x27;s Sydney Metro West and Western Sydney Airport Metro projects are currently under construction in the region.

The M4 Western Motorway is a prominent dual carriageway motorway in western Sydney, that stretches from in the east, where it connects with the Great Western Highway/Parramatta Road as the A4 to in west. It continues as the Great Western Highway as the A32, passing the southern fringe of the Parramatta central business district, moving due west across western metropolitan Sydney to Penrith, north of the central business district, crossing the Nepean River via the 1867 Victoria Bridge.

Cumberland Highway links the Pacific Highway (A1/B83) and Pacific Motorway (M1) at Pearces Corner, Wahroonga in the northeast with the Hume Highway (A22/A28) at Liverpool in the southwest.

The M5 Motorway is the primary route from to the Sydney CBD, with its terminus being in the south of an interchange near Prestons where the M5 meets the Westlink M7 and the M31 Hume Motorway.

The A6 is a major arterial road that provides a link from the northern and western suburbs to the centre western suburbs – Bankstown and the Princes Highway at , via Lidcombe and Bankstown.

Henry Lawson Drive was conceived of as a scenic drive to follow the north bank of the Georges River in Sydney&#x27;s southwest.

The Light Horse Interchange is a motorway interchange located in Eastern Creek at the junction of the M4 Western Motorway and the Westlink M7 that was opened to traffic in December 2005 due to the population boom in Sydney&#x27;s western suburbs.

== Politics ==
Greater Western Sydney local government authorities agree on the broad definition of greater western Sydney, but divide the region based on the regional organisations of councils. The Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils (WSROC) includes the local government areas of Blacktown, Fairfield, Hawkesbury, Cumberland, Liverpool, Parramatta and Penrith. The Macarthur Regional Organisation of Councils (MACROC) includes the local government areas of Camden, Campbelltown and Wollondilly. In government administration, the region has a Minister for Western Sydney, currently held by the Hon. David Elliott, MP.

Western Sydney is home to a large number of marginal electorates at both a state and federal level. Western Sydney includes, or partially includes, the NSW Electoral Districts of Penrith, Londonderry, Badgerys Creek, Camden, Macquarie Fields, Leppington, Campbelltown, Liverpool, Cabramatta, Fairfield, Prospect, Bankstown, Granville, Parramatta, Winston Hills, Kellyville, Castle Hill, Riverstone, Mount Druitt, Blacktown, Holsworthy, Auburn, Hawkesbury.

Western Sydney is considered a particularly crucial region in federal politics, and the region&#x27;s social conservativism from its Christian and Muslim communities has been credited with forming policy on migration and the treatment of asylum seekers by both major political parties. Western Sydney voted &#x27;no&#x27; in high margins in the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey held in 2017. 12 of the 17 divisions that voted &#x27;no&#x27; nationally were from Western Sydney. Despite this, Western Sydney is largely dominated by Labor, while the conservative Christian Democrats draw much of their support from the large and devout Arab Christian and Assyrian populations. Western Sydney can therefore be described as an economically left-wing but very socially conservative region, at least compared to the other regions of Sydney.

Western Sydney, could be drawn similar to the South of America. Due to its social conservatism and economic populism.

<doc id="717281" wikidata="Q1265869" url="?curid=717281" title="Pandora and the Flying Dutchman">
<text>Pandora and the Flying Dutchman is a 1951 British Technicolor romantic fantasy drama film written and directed by Albert Lewin. The screenplay is based on legend of the Flying Dutchman.

The film stars James Mason and Ava Gardner in the title roles, with Nigel Patrick, Sheila Sim, Harold Warrender, Mario Cabré and Marius Goring supporting.

==Plot==
In autumn 1930, fishermen in the fictitious small Spanish port of Esperanza make a grim discovery in their nets, the bodies of a man and a woman. The resultant ringing of church bells in the village brings the local police and the resident archaeologist, Geoffrey Fielding, to the beach. Fielding returns to his villa, and, breaking the &quot;fourth wall&quot;, retells the story of these two people to the audience.

Esperanza&#x27;s small group of English expatriates revolves around Pandora Reynolds, an alluring American nightclub singer and femme fatale. All the men love her (or believe that they do), but Pandora is unable to love anyone. One of her admirers Reggie Demarest commits suicide in front of Pandora and her friends by drinking wine that he has laced with poison, but Pandora shows indifference and later comments that she is relieved by his death.

She tests her admirers by demanding they give up something they value. Pandora agrees to marry a land-speed record holder, Stephen Cameron, after he sends his racing car tumbling into the sea at her request. That same night, the Dutch captain Hendrik van der Zee arrives in Esperanza. Pandora swims out to his yacht and finds him painting a picture of her posed as her namesake, Pandora, whose actions brought an end to the earthly paradise in Greek mythology. Hendrik appears to fall in love with Pandora, and he moves into the same hotel complex as the other expatriates.

Geoffrey and Hendrik become friends, collaborating to seek background information on Geoffrey&#x27;s local finds. One of these relics is a notebook written in Old Dutch, which confirms Geoffrey&#x27;s suspicion that Hendrik van der Zee is the Flying Dutchman, a 16th-century ship captain who murdered his wife, believing her to be unfaithful. He blasphemed against God at his murder trial, where he was sentenced to death.

The evening before his execution, a mysterious force opened the Dutchman&#x27;s prison doors and allowed him to escape to his waiting ship, where in a dream it was revealed to him that his wife was innocent and he was doomed to sail the seas for eternity unless he could find a woman who loved him enough to die for him. Every seven years, the Dutchman could go ashore for six months to search for that woman.

Despite her impending wedding to Stephen, Pandora declares her love for Hendrik, but he is unwilling to have her die for his sake, and tries to provoke her into hating him.

Pandora is also loved by Juan Montalvo, an arrogant, famous bullfighter, who murders Hendrik out of jealousy. But as soon as Montalvo leaves, Hendrik comes back to life as if nothing had happened. He attends the bullfight the next day, and when Montalvo sees him in the audience, he becomes petrified with fear and is fatally gored by the bull. Before dying, Montalvo tells Pandora about his murder of his romantic rival, leaving her confused.

On the eve of her wedding, Pandora asks Geoffrey if he knows anything about Hendrik that will clear up her confusion. Once he sees the Flying Dutchman preparing to sail away, he hands her his translation of the notebook. However, the Dutchman&#x27;s yacht is becalmed. On learning the truth, Pandora swims out to Hendrik again. He shows her a small portrait of his murdered wife. She and Pandora look exactly alike. Hendrik explains they are man and wife and that through her he has been given the chance to escape his doom, but he rejected it because it will cost her death. They embrace. She asks him when it will happen. He explains they have eternity now. They kiss, and suddenly, there is a fierce storm. Geoffrey watches as the vessel is overwhelmed and sinks.

In the present, Geoffrey toasts the Dutchman: &quot;May the consummation of your love endure as long as the punishment that made you worthy of it!&quot;

==Production==
Albert Lewin, an MGM producer at the time, was able to produce &quot;Pandora&quot; due to the postponement of &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; in 1949. The film includes a number of literary references, including Matthew Arnold&#x27;s &quot;Dover Beach&quot;, &quot;The Rubaiyat&quot;, and Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s 1926 novel &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;.

It was primarily filmed in Tossa de Mar, on the Costa Brava in Catalonia, Spain. The land record speed scenes were shot at Pendine Sands in Wales. In Tossa de Mar, a statue of Gardner was erected in 1996 on the hill overlooking the town&#x27;s main beach.The film is mostly spoken in English, but some characters speak Catalan (the local fishermen at the beginning of the film) and Spanish (the bullfighter&#x27;s entourage).

Artist Man Ray, a friend of Albert Lewin, produced some sets for &quot;Pandora&quot;. He created particular cubist-style chess pieces and several paintings seen in the film, notably the surrealist scene in the De Chirico fashion.

In the United States, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer delayed the film until the release of Gardner&#x27;s star-making performance in &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1951). The tactic proved effective, as &quot;Show Boat&quot; solidified her status as a rapidly rising star.

A digitally restored version of the film was released in February 2020. The restoration process took more than a dozen years, with the Cohen Media Group ultimately funding a 4K version, which included more than 700 hours of digital restoration on 177,120 frames of the film.

==Reception==
According to MGM records, &quot;Pandora and the Flying Dutchman&quot; earned $1,247,000 in the US and Canada and $354,000 elsewhere. Other records say it cost £308,800 and earned producer income of £225,000. The film was one of the most popular films at the British box office 1951.

Howard Thompson, of The New York Times, gave the film a mixed review upon release. He described the film as a &quot;serious, complex but unexciting study of passions and sublime love&quot;. Thompson also praised the “brilliance and invention” of the cinematography by Jack Cardiff, noting that its most rewarding moments include Cardiff&#x27;s &quot;capturing the ghostly qualities of the tale and the exquisite beauties of Spanish settings and folkways.&quot;

It holds a rating of 67% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 33 reviews.

<text>Southern Sydney, also commonly referred to as the Southern suburbs, is the southern metropolitan area of Greater Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia.

Southern Sydney is a title for the regions and neighbourhoods which fall directly south and south-west of the Sydney CBD from the southern boundaries of Central Station down to the Airport and St George region around the southern and western shores of Botany Bay with the southern most concluding point being the Sutherland Shire. This includes all the suburbs in the local government areas of Georges River Council, The Sutherland Shire, most of Bayside Council and the southern suburbs of City of Sydney. The Australian Bureau of Statistics defines a statistical area called The St George-Sutherland Statistical Subdivision and The City and Inner South Statistical Subdivision.

Because the regions that make up Southern Sydney are mostly separated by Botany Bay and The Georges River, rather than directly bordering each other, occasionally suburbs on the eastern shore of Botany Bay are included within Southern Sydney.

The Southern Sydney councils participate in the Southern Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils (SSROC) along with six other councils in the City, Eastern Suburbs and Inner West regions.

The southern suburbs of Sydney can be grouped into three regions:

== Inner South ==

The Inner Southern Suburbs of Sydney, sometimes referred to as &#x27;South Sydney&#x27; include the southern suburbs of City of Sydney as well as some of Bayside Council. The area encompasses the suburbs directly south of Central Station or more specifically Cleveland Street leading all the way down to the Airport and fall west of the Eastern Distributor but east of the Alexandra Canal. The area starts with Redfern then continues down through Eveleigh, Waterloo, Zetland, Alexandria, Beaconsfield, Rosebery, Eastlakes (West of Eastern Distributor) and ends in Mascot.

The postcodes start at 2015 and end in 2020 with the suburbs of Botany and Banksmeadow being the exception having the postcode of 2019 which while being geographically south of the CBD along with the included suburbs are actually on the other side of the Eastern Distributor usually deeming them Eastern Suburbs that are south-east of CBD rather than part of South Sydney.

The region consists of three train stations being Redfern, Green Square and Mascot as well as one Metro station in Waterloo. Green Square is a locality situated at the meeting point of Alexandria, Zetland, Waterloo, and Beaconsfield. Green Square and Mascot station are on the Airport Link completed in 2000 which is part of the T8 Airport &amp; South Line. Many of these suburbs were predominantly industrial and commercial but have now developed into new residential neighbourhoods of high rise apartments.

The Inner Southern Suburbs are sometimes considered inner city or included as part of the Eastern Suburbs that are south-east of CBD however strictly speaking these suburbs geographically are neither east nor south-east of the Sydney CBD.

== St George ==

The St George area, considered the southern suburbs includes all the suburbs in the Georges River Council and the western part of Bayside Council which was Rockdale City prior to 2016. This is everything within the boundaries of Salt Pan Creek to the west, The Georges River to the south, Botany Bay to the east and the M5 Motorway and Wolli Creek to the north. This area corresponds to the southern portion of the cadastral Parish of St George, from which the region derives its name. This southern portion of the parish below the M5 and Wolli Creek is the more contemporary definition of The St George Region that is considered part of Southern Sydney.

The northern portion of the Parish of St George that is north of the M5 and Wolli Creek but south of The Cooks River is considered South-Western Sydney rather than Southern Sydney. This northern portion of the cadastral parish was formerly in the City of Canterbury but now within the amalgamated City of Canterbury-Bankstown. In some instances the whole cadastral Parish of St George (both north and south) is grouped together and considered the inner south-west due to its geographical location from Sydney CBD.

== Sutherland Shire ==

The Sutherland Shire is the area to the south of Botany Bay and the Georges River. The Sutherland Shire is south of Sydney central business district, and is bordered by the City of Canterbury-Bankstown, and Georges River Council local government areas.

The administrative centre of the local government is located in the suburb of Sutherland.

<text>Hanover State Opera () is a German opera company based in Hanover, the state capital of Lower Saxony. The company is resident in the Hanover Opera House (), and is part of a publicly-funded umbrella performing arts organisation called Hanover State Theatre of Lower Saxony (), or simply Hanover State Theatre ().

Hanover State Theatre comprises the following divisions that put on operas, stage productions, and concert programs, in addition to maintaining a theatre museum, with seasons running from September through to June.
==Hanover Opera House==
Hanover State Opera is resident in the Hanover Opera House, built in classical style between 1845 and 1852 based on a plan by Georg Ludwig Friedrich Laves. The building was rebuilt from 1948 after being badly damaged by the aerial bombings of Hanover during World War II. In 1985, the acoustics were improved, and between 1996 and 1998, the stage facilities were renovated.

The International Choreographic Competition Hannover has taken place at Hanover Opera House since the early 1980s, and is the longest-running choreography competition in the world. It is organised by the Ballet Association of Hanover ().

==Administration==
The current intendant of the opera company is replacing Michael Klügl in 2019. 

The longest-serving general music director (GMD) of the opera company was George Alexander Albrecht, from 1965 until 1993. The first woman, and first American, to hold the post of general music director was Karen Kamensek, from 2011 until 2014. The current GMD of the opera company is Stephan Zilias, named to the post in February 2020 following his debut with the opera company in the 2019–2020 season. In April 2024 the company announced the extension of Zilias&#x27; contract as GMD through the 2025–2026 season.

<doc id="717312" wikidata="Q1150069" url="?curid=717312" title="The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual">
<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual&quot; is a short story by Arthur Conan Doyle, featuring his fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. The story was originally published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in the United Kingdom in May 1893, and in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; in the United States on 13 May 1893. It was collected in &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

Unlike the majority of Holmes stories, the main narrator is not Doctor Watson, but Sherlock Holmes himself. With Watson providing an introduction, the story within a story is a classic example of a frame tale. It is one of the earliest recorded cases investigated by Holmes, and establishes his problem solving skills.

&quot;The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual&quot; shares elements with two Edgar Allan Poe tales: &quot;The Gold-Bug&quot; and &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot;.

In 1927, Conan Doyle ranked the story at 11th place on his top 12 Holmes stories list. The story did better in a 1999 chart produced by &quot;The Baker Street Journal&quot;, ranking 6th out of 10.

== Plot ==
=== Summary of &quot;The Musgrave Ritual&quot; by Arthur Conan Doyle ===
&quot;The Musgrave Ritual&quot; is a short story from &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, written by Arthur Conan Doyle. It is one of the cases Sherlock Holmes solved before meeting Dr. Watson and becoming famous. The story is narrated by Holmes himself as he recounts the case to Watson.

==== Introduction ====
Holmes tells Watson about one of his early cases involving his old university acquaintance, Reginald Musgrave. Musgrave, a member of an aristocratic family, comes to Holmes for help regarding a strange and troubling event at his ancestral estate in Sussex.

==== The Mystery ====
Musgrave explains that his butler, Richard Brunton, had been caught snooping around family documents, specifically an old, seemingly meaningless text called &quot;The Musgrave Ritual.&quot; Musgrave had dismissed Brunton but gave him a week to leave. However, Brunton mysteriously disappeared before his departure. Additionally, a maid named Rachel Howells, who had been romantically involved with Brunton, was acting strangely and later vanished as well.

The Musgrave Ritual is an old, cryptic set of questions and answers passed down through generations in the Musgrave family. It appears to be a riddle about a hidden treasure. The text of the ritual is:

&quot;&quot;Where was the sun? Over the oak.&quot;

Where was the shadow? Under the elm.*

How was it stepped? North by ten and by ten, east by five and by five, south by two and by two, west by one and by one, and so under.*

What shall we give for it? All that is ours.*

Why should we give it? For the sake of the trust.*

Holmes realizes that the ritual is a set of directions meant to locate something hidden long ago. Using the positioning of the sun and trees, Holmes follows the instructions and discovers a hidden chamber beneath the floor of an old storeroom. Inside, they find Brunton’s dead body—he had been trapped while searching for the treasure.

==== The Solution ====
Holmes deduces that Brunton had deciphered the ritual and found the location of the treasure but had enlisted Rachel’s help to move a heavy stone slab. However, Rachel, in a fit of anger or madness, had sealed Brunton inside the chamber, leaving him to suffocate. She later fled and was never found again.

The treasure turned out to be a centuries-old crown belonging to King Charles I, hidden by an ancestor of the Musgrave family during the English Civil War. Unfortunately, due to the passage of time, the crown had deteriorated into an unrecognizable state.

==== Conclusion ====
Holmes solves the case, revealing the tragic fate of Brunton and the significance of the Musgrave Ritual. Musgrave, though regretful of the events, is relieved to understand the truth. However, the missing maid, Rachel Howells, is never found, adding an element of mystery to the case.

This story highlights Holmes’s brilliant deduction skills, his ability to interpret historical clues, and his methodical approach to solving mysteries.

== Publication history ==
The story was originally published in the &quot;Strand Magazine&quot; in May 1893, with illustrations by Sidney Paget. It was later collected in &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The &quot;Strand&quot;″s text of the ritual did not specify the month in which the shadow of the elm should be measured (the shadow would be longer in winter and point in different directions throughout the year), but a couplet was added for the &quot;Memoirs&quot; identifying the month as the &quot;sixth from the first&quot;.

&quot;The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual&quot; was also published in the US in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; on 13 May 1893, and in the US edition of &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in June 1893. The story was published with six illustrations by Sidney Paget in the &quot;Strand&quot;, and with two illustrations by W. H. Hyde in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. It was included in &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in December 1893 in the UK and February 1894 in the US.

== Adaptations ==

===Film and television===
The story was adapted for the 1912 French-British Éclair film series as a silent short film.

It was also adapted as a short film as part of the Stoll film series. The film was released in 1922.

The 1943 film &quot;Sherlock Holmes Faces Death&quot;, part of the Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce series of films, loosely adapted the story, though the ritual was completely re-written to represent a chess game played on the floor of the Musgrave mansion. Also the treasure is a land grant that was given to the Musgraves by Henry VIII instead of the lost crown of Charles I.

The story was adapted for the 1954 television series, &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, there titled &quot;The Case of the Greystone Inscription&quot;.

The story was adapted for the 1965 BBC series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; with Peter Cushing. The episode is now lost.

The story was adapted for an episode of &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, the Granada Television series starring Jeremy Brett. The episode deviated from the original by including Watson in the adventure; the story nods to the framing device of the original by having Holmes, not looking forward to the trip, remark that he intends to organise some of his old cases before he met Watson in order to keep himself occupied. In addition, the story features an actual oak tree, which Holmes describes as &quot;a patriarch among oaks, one of the most magnificent trees that I have ever seen.&quot; In the Granada film version, however, Holmes utilizes a weathervane in the shape of an oak perched on top of the Musgrave mansion to solve the mysterious ritual. At the very end of the teleplay, Rachel&#x27;s body is shown to have been found after having floated up from the mere. Further, the 12th line of the ritual is adapted to suit the scenery and the 5th and 6th lines are omitted. It was filmed in the 400-year-old Baddesley Clinton Manor House near Birmingham, UK. This house was the Musgrave home in the TV episode. In the original story, this was one of Holmes&#x27; early cases just after he had graduated from college; in the adaptation, the time sequence is moved to when Holmes had partnered with Watson to solve mysteries.

An episode of the animated television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century&quot; was based on the story. The episode, titled &quot;The Musgrave Ritual&quot;, first aired in 1999.

Episodes 9 and 10 of the 2013 Russian TV series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; are based on the story, although the storyline is quite different including some action scenes and Brunton being in fact a revenging member of a family of Musgraves&#x27; rivals.

The Musgrave Ritual is adapted as part of the storyline of the final episode of the fourth season of &quot;Sherlock&quot;, &quot;The Final Problem&quot;; as children, the Holmes family lived in an old house called Musgrave, but after Sherlock and Mycroft&#x27;s sister Eurus was involved in the disappearance of Sherlock&#x27;s dog/best friend (Sherlock had for years believed it was a dog as he buried the memory due to the scale of the mental trauma), all Eurus would provide as a clue was a strange song. Years later, with John Watson&#x27;s life at stake as he is trapped in the same location where Eurus left her first victim, Sherlock deduces that the song relates to the unusual dates on various fake gravestones around the house, the resulting &#x27;code&#x27; leading him to Eurus&#x27; old room to make an emotional appeal to his sister to spare John.

===Radio===
Edith Meiser adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; which aired on 5 January 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.

The story was adapted for the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson. The episode aired on 16 July 1943.

A 1962 BBC Light Programme radio adaptation aired as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson.

An adaptation aired on BBC radio in June 1978, starring Barry Foster as Holmes and David Buck as Watson. It was adapted by Michael Bakewell.

&quot;The Musgrave Ritual&quot; was adapted as a 1981 episode of the series &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot; with Gordon Gould as Sherlock Holmes and Court Benson as Dr. Watson.

&quot;The Musgrave Ritual&quot; was dramatised by Peter Mackie for BBC Radio 4 in 1992 as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Robert Daws as Reginald Musgrave and Michael Kilgarriff as Sergeant Harris.

A 2014 episode of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, was adapted from the story, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

===Stage===
T. S. Eliot stated that he adapted part of the Ritual in his 1935 verse play &quot;Murder in the Cathedral&quot; as a deliberate homage.

<doc id="717316" wikidata="Q4775137" url="?curid=717316" title="Antiprocess">
<text>Antiprocess is the preemptive recognition and marginalization of undesired information by the interplay of mental defense mechanisms: the subconscious compromises information that would cause cognitive dissonance. It is often used to describe a difficulty encountered when people with sharply contrasting viewpoints are attempting (and failing) to discuss a topic.

In other words, when one is debating with another, there may be a baffling disconnect despite one&#x27;s apparent understanding of the argument. Despite the apparently sufficient understanding to formulate counter-arguments, the mind of the debater does not allow him to be swayed by that knowledge.

There are many instances on the Internet where antiprocess can be observed, but the prime location to see it is in Usenet discussion groups, where discussions tend to be highly polarized. In such debates, both sides appear to have a highly sophisticated understanding of the other position, yet neither side is swayed. As a result, the debate can continue for years without any progress being made.

== Dynamics ==
Antiprocess occurs because:

# The mind is capable of multitasking;
# The mind has the innate capability to evaluate and select information at a preconscious level so that we are not overwhelmed with the processing requirements;
# It is not feasible to maintain two contradictory beliefs at the same time;
# It is not possible for people to be aware of every factor leading up to decisions they make;
# People learn argumentatively effective but logically invalid defensive strategies (such as rhetorical fallacies);
# People tend to favour strategies of thinking that have served them well in the past; and
# The truth is just too unpalatable to the mind to accept.

The ramifications of these factors are that people can be engaged in a debate sincerely, yet the appearances suggest that they are not. This can lead to acrimony if neither party is aware of antiprocess and does not adjust his or her debating style accordingly.

<text>Amália da Piedade Rebordão Rodrigues (23 July 1920 – 6 October 1999), known as simply Amália Rodrigues () or popularly as Amália, was a Portuguese fado singer (&quot;fadista&quot;). 

Dubbed &quot;Rainha do Fado&quot; (&quot;Queen of Fado&quot;), she was instrumental in popularising fado worldwide and travelled internationally throughout her career. Rodrigues remains the best-selling Portuguese artist in history.

==Early years==
===Early life===
Even though official documents give her date of birth as 23 July, Amália herself maintained that her birthday was actually 1 July 1920. The baptism certificate of Rodrigues is in the Parish Church of Fundão, and the document was published in the Journal of Fundão after the singer&#x27;s death, following its discovery in an investigation by Salvado J. Travassos.

She was born in Pena, a parish of Lisbon, Portugal. Her father was Albertino de Jesus Rodrigues, originally from the Castelo Branco district in Central Portugal, and her mother was Lucinda da Piedade Rebordão, of Fundão parish, also in the Castelo Branco district. Her maternal family had roots in Souto da Casa, a parish in Fundão, where Rodrigues&#x27;s grandfather worked as a blacksmith. According to the testimony of José Filipe Duarte Gonçalves, her sister, Celeste, was born in Lisbon (in addition to another child who died). Rodrigues grew up in poverty and doing odd jobs such as selling fruit on Lisbon&#x27;s quays.

===Singing career===
Rodrigues started singing around 1935. Her first professional engagement in a fado venue took place in 1939, and she was a guest in stage revues.
Around that time she met Frederico Valério, a classically trained composer who recognised Amália&#x27;s potential and composed numerous melodies especially designed for her- adding orchestral accompaniments. Such as &#x27;Fado do Ciúme&#x27;, &#x27;Ai Mouraria&#x27;, &#x27;Que Deus Me Perdoe&#x27;, and &#x27;Não Sei Porque Te Foste Embora.&#x27;

By the early 1940s, Amália had become a famous singer in Portugal. Rodrigues began acting with a debut film in 1946 titled &#x27;Capas Negras&#x27; followed by her best known movie, &#x27;Fado&#x27; (1947).

She gained popularity in Spain and Brazil (where, in 1945, she made her first recordings on Brazilian label Continental) where she spent some time and Paris (1949) where she resided. In 1950, while performing at the Marshall Plan international benefit shows, she introduced the song &#x27;April in Portugal&#x27; to international audiences, under its original title &quot;Coimbra&quot;.

In the early 1950s, the involvement of Portuguese poet David Mourão-Ferreira marked a new phase in her career where leading poets were writing specifically for her.

==The middle years==

===International career===

Amalia Rodrigues travelled abroad for the first time in 1943, to perform at the Portuguese ambassador in Madrid Pedro Teotónio Pereira&#x27;s gala party. She was accompanied by singer Júlio Proença and musicians Armandinho and Santos Moreira. She performed in Brazil in 1945 where she made her first recordings, in Berlin in 1950 and also performed in Mexico and France. She was the first Portuguese artist to appear on American TV on ABC in 1953. She sang at Hollywood&#x27;s Mocambo club in 1954.
Rodrigues appeared in Henri Verneuil&#x27;s film &quot;The Lovers of Lisbon&quot; (&quot;Les Amants du Tage&quot;), in a supporting role. In France she was almost as popular as in Portugal, and she performed at the prestigious Parisian Olympia hall. This led to the release of the album &quot;Portugal&#x27;s Great Amália Rodrigues Live at the Olympia Theatre in Paris,&quot; in 1957. 

In France during the 1950s–1960s she performed on television and became a well-known artist. Charles Aznavour wrote a fado in French especially for her &#x27;Aie Mourir Pour Toi&#x27; and she created French versions of her own songs (e.g. Coimbra became Avril au Portugal. She performed at Olympia for 10 seasons between 1956 and 1992.

She then said she would sing only once in a while. She returned in 1962 concentrating on recording and performing live at a slower pace.

Her comeback album, 1962&#x27;s &quot;Amália Rodrigues&quot;, was with French composer Alain Oulman (1929–1990), who was to become her main songwriter and musical producer. He wrote melodies for creating a Fado sub-genre known as &#x27;Busto&#x27; (Bust). Rodrigues also began to sing her own poems (&#x27;Estranha Forma de Vida&#x27;) on &quot;Amália Rodrigues&quot;, as well as poems written by other poets, such as Pedro Homem de Mello and David Mourão-Ferreira. This album also established her signature songs like &#x27;Povo Que Lavas no Rio&#x27;, &#x27;Maria Lisboa&#x27; and &#x27;Abandono&#x27;. Oulman, a left-wing intellectual, was arrested by Portugal&#x27;s political police (known as PIDE) in 1966, and forced into exile, but he continued contributing for Amália.

She resumed her stage-career singing in Israel, the UK, France, and returning to the US for Promenade Concerts at the Hollywood Bowl, and New York City, accompanied by Andre Kostelanetz, in 1966 and 1968. She also sang in the ex-USSR and Romania.

===Acting career===

She continued her acting career, in films like &#x27;Sangue Toureiro&#x27; (1958), and &#x27;Fado Corrido&#x27; (1964).

Rodrigues appeared in Carlos Vilardebó&#x27;s 1964 arthouse film &quot;The Enchanted Islands&quot; based on a short story by Herman Melville. Her 1965 recording of poems by 16th century poet Luís de Camões generated acres of newspaper polemics. Her 1968 single &quot;Vou dar de beber à dor&quot; broke all sales records and her 1970 album &quot;Com que voz&quot; won a number of international awards.

Having been given Portugal&#x27;s Film Award for Best Actress for &#x27;Fado&#x27; in 1947, once again she was awarded as Portugal&#x27;s Best Film Actress in 1965, in a movie where she didn&#x27;t sing.

In between she performed in other genres: she recorded some of her old songs with an orchestra, recorded an album with jazz saxophonist Don Byas &#x27;Encontro&#x27; (1968), and recorded an album of American songs with Norrie Paramor&#x27;s orchestra, &#x27;Amália On Broadway&#x27; which includes a rendition of &#x27;Summertime&#x27;, &#x27;The Nearness of You&#x27;.

An important album in the 1960s was &#x27;Com Que Voz&#x27;, (1969), reprising many of her successes and adding a few more, all poems by Portuguese-speaking poets, and music by Alain Oulman. Rodrigues was at the height of her vocal and performing powers during the 1960s.

==The later years==
In the 1970s, Rodrigues concentrated on live concert performances. During the post-25 April 1974 period, she was falsely accused of being a covert agent of the PIDE; this unjust charge triggered a severe bout of depression on her part. While Salazar had been Prime Minister, Rodrigues had been a financial supporter of the Portuguese Communist Party. At the same time she had occasionally expressed some admiration for Salazar himself, reportedly writing love letters to Salazar when he was hospitalized in 1968. Despite the government&#x27;s heavy promotion of Rodrigues as a national symbol of Portugal, in private, Salazar hated Fado and Rodrigues (whom he referred to as &quot;that creature&quot;), considering its central concept of &#x27;saudade&#x27; (nostalgia or a painful yearning for the past) as anti-modern and &quot;has a softening influence on the Portuguese character&quot;, one that &quot;sapped all energy from the soul and led to inertia&quot;.
From the 1970s Rodrigues enjoyed particularly marked success in Italy and Japan. She recorded an album of Italian traditional songs, &quot;A Una Terra Che Amo&quot; (1973), and made versions of her own songs in Italian. She recorded live performances in an album called &quot;Amália in Italia&quot; (1978). Her return to the recording studio with Portuguese material came in 1977 with &quot;Cantigas numa Língua Antiga&quot;.

Soon after that release, Rodrigues suffered her first really serious troubles in terms of physical health, which caused her to be away from the stage for a short period again, and forced her to concentrate on performing, especially in Portugal. Those problems were followed by two very personal albums: &quot;Gostava de Ser Quem Era&quot; (1980) (literally &#x27;I&#x27;d Like To Be Who I Was&#x27;) and &#x27;Lágrima&#x27; (1983): all these songs used poems that she herself wrote. In between she sang Frederico Valerio&#x27;s songs again, in an album called &quot;Fado&quot; (1982).

The 1980s and 1990s brought her enthronement as a living legend. Her last all-new studio recording, &quot;Lágrima&quot;, was released in 1983. It was followed by a series of previously lost or unreleased recordings and two greatest hits collections.

===Illness===

Rodrigues returned to the Olympia in Paris in 1985 for a series of concerts. From 1985 to 1994, she enjoyed great international success. During these years she held concerts in France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Brazil, Argentina, Israel, and the USA, in addition to Portugal.

In 1990 the celebrations of her 50th career anniversary started with a major concert in Lisbon&#x27;s Coliseu dos Recreios at the age of 69. She was decorated by the President of the Republic on stage. Her voice had changed: it was lower in pitch and had acquired a new intensity.

Despite a series of illnesses involving her voice, Rodrigues continued recording as late as 1990. She eventually retreated from public performance, although her career gained in stature with an official biography by historian and journalist Vítor Pavão dos Santos, and a five-hour TV series documenting her half-century-long career featuring rare archival footage (later distilled into the 90-minute film documentary, &quot;The Art of Amália&quot;). Its director, Bruno de Almeida, has also produced &quot;Amália, Live in New York City&quot;, a concert film of her 1990 performance at The Town Hall.

Rodrigues launched a final album of originals in 1990, &quot;Obsessão&quot;. In December 1994 she gave her last concert, aged 74, during the Lisbon European Capital of Culture concerts. She underwent a lung operation soon after, in 1995. Television specials, interviews and tributes were held. She released a new album with original recordings from the 1960s and 1970s, &quot;Segredo&quot; (1997), and a book of her poems, including the ones she had sung: &quot;Amália: Versos&quot; (1997).

In 1998, Rodrigues was paid a national tribute at Lisbon&#x27;s Universal Exhibition (Expo &#x27;98), and in February 1999 was considered one of Portugal&#x27;s 25 most important personalities of the democratic period. Soon after she recorded what would become her last interview for television. The &#x27;Cinématheque de Paris&#x27; did her a tribute in April 1999, by showing some of her movies.

===Death===

On 6 October 1999, Rodrigues died at age 79, in her Lisbon home. The Portuguese government, at the time led by Prime Minister António Guterres, promptly declared three days of national mourning. Her house, in Rua de São Bento, is now a museum. She is interred at the National Pantheon alongside other Portuguese notables.

She was given a state funeral, attended by tens of thousands, and later transferred to the National Pantheon in 2001; the first woman ever to be laid among the greatest Portuguese figures, an exceptional honour awarded by Parliament.

==Civil awards and decorations==
* Dame of the Military Order of Saint James of the Sword, Portugal (16 July 1958)
* Officer of the Military Order of Saint James of the Sword, Portugal (16 February 1971)

==Legacy==
According to her will, the &quot;Amália Rodrigues Foundation&quot; (Fundação Amália Rodrigues) was established. The foundation manages her legacy and assets, except her copyright, willed to two of her nephews. By the time of her death in 1999, Rodrigues had received more than 40 decorations and honors from France (including the Légion d&#x27;Honneur), Lebanon, Portugal, Spain, Israel and Japan.

In 2004, Italian director Francesco Vezzoli released short black-and-white film &quot;Amália Traïda&quot;. In 2007, she came in 14th in Portugal&#x27;s election of Os Grandes Portugueses (The Greatest Portuguese). One year later, in 2008, a film about her life Amália was released, with Sandra Barata portraying her.

Rodrigues was once considered by &quot;Variety&quot; as one of the voices of the century. She remains one of the most international of Portuguese artists and singers, and in Portugal, a national icon.
She put Fado in the world map as a musical genre, and her works continue to inspire other performers and singers today, many of whom sing her repertoire.

Rodrigues remains one of Portugal&#x27;s most famous artists and singers. She was born into a humble family and became one of Portugal&#x27;s biggest celebrities, internationally recognised artist and singer. Her career spanned 55 years and she recorded songs in several languages (especially Portuguese, French, English, Spanish and Italian). Versions of her own songs, for instance &quot;Coimbra&quot; (&quot;April in Portugal&quot;) achieved success in France, Italy, USA, Brazil, Argentina, Spain, Mexico, Romania, Japan and The Netherlands, among other countries.

==Family==
Amália Rodrigues&#x27; parents had nine children, but only five reached adulthood: Vicente, Filipe, José and António (died as infants), Amália, Celeste, Aninhas (who died at sixteen), Maria da Glória (who died shortly after birth), and Odete. In 1940, she married Francisco Cruz, a lathe worker and amateur guitar player from whom she separated in 1943 and whom she divorced in 1946. In 1961, in Rio de Janeiro, she married César Seabra and remained married until his death in 1997.

<doc id="717343" wikidata="Q7989131" url="?curid=717343" title="Westminster Bubble">
<text>The Westminster bubble (also called the Westminster village) is a characterisation including members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as being isolated from life outside Parliament. As well as referring to Members of Parliament and Peers, the characterisation also extends to people such as lobbyists, researchers, secretaries, civil servants, lobby correspondents and leader writers for newspapers and is so named because Parliament is located in Westminster, London.

Politicians in this bubble often graduate from prestigious private schools and elite Russell Group Universities to then climb the political ladder to become MPs, always remaining in the professional bubble of Westminster, creating a certain set of life experiences in which of often argued to be displayed in many of the MPs in London.

Furthermore, the Westminster bubble can also be viewed as a centralisation of political issues geographically around Westminster and Parliament, where in which London based and diplomatic issues gain more attention than more regional issues in other areas of the United Kingdom, particularly Scotland, Wales, Northern England and Northern Ireland, in which have been argued to have been in some cases &quot;left behind&quot; in the decision-making processes in Westminster due to a centralisation of focus on issues specific to the capital of London and England, especially in regard to Brexit: both Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain in the European Union, but have been forced to undertake the verdict of the Westminster government.

A similar situation occurs in the United States, where the governmental culture in and around Washington, D.C. is sometimes known as the &quot;Washington bubble&quot; or more often &quot;Inside the Beltway&quot;. More recently, in Scotland, there has been a development of a &quot;Holyrood bubble&quot;, as the Scottish Parliament is in the Holyrood district of Edinburgh. 

An example of the characterization includes Peter Hain speaking in the House on 29 January 2004:
&quot;All broadcasters, the whole coverage of politics, the Westminster bubble that we as politicians of the Government and Opposition occupy together with the Westminster lobby; together we are all conducting politics in a way that is turning off voters, listeners, readers and watchers by the million.&quot;

In July the previous year he had described it in a newspaper article as:

 &quot;That politically incestuous world occupied by politicians, government and opposition, together with the media. Politicians, news broadcasters and journalists now form a &#x27;political class&#x27; which is in a frenzied world of its own, divorced from the people, and which is turning off viewers, listeners and readers from politics by the million.&quot;.
In November 2003 Conservative Party Leader Michael Howard indicated on the day of his appointment that he wished to be a &quot;leader outside the Westminster Bubble.&quot;

Sometimes, some politicians recently have claimed some issues to be &quot;Westminster bubble&quot; issues, arguing that they are issues that have not gained, or are not gaining, traction with the general public and cutting through.

<text>In geometry, the 120-cell is the convex regular 4-polytope (four-dimensional analogue of a Platonic solid) with Schläfli symbol {5,3,3}. It is also called a C120, dodecaplex (short for &quot;dodecahedral complex&quot;), hyperdodecahedron, polydodecahedron, hecatonicosachoron, dodecacontachoron and hecatonicosahedroid.

The boundary of the 120-cell is composed of 120 dodecahedral cells with 4 meeting at each vertex. Together they form 720 pentagonal faces, 1200 edges, and 600 vertices. It is the 4-dimensional analogue of the regular dodecahedron, since just as a dodecahedron has 12 pentagonal facets, with 3 around each vertex, the &quot;dodecaplex&quot; has 120 dodecahedral facets, with 3 around each edge. Its dual polytope is the 600-cell.

== Geometry ==
The 120-cell incorporates the geometries of every convex regular polytope in the first four dimensions (except the polygons {7} and above). As the sixth and largest regular convex 4-polytope, it contains inscribed instances of its four predecessors (recursively). It also contains 120 inscribed instances of the first in the sequence, the 5-cell, which is not found in any of the others. The 120-cell is a four-dimensional Swiss Army knife: it contains one of everything.

It is daunting but instructive to study the 120-cell, because it contains examples of &quot;every&quot; relationship among &quot;all&quot; the convex regular polytopes found in the first four dimensions. Conversely, it can only be understood by first understanding each of its predecessors, and the sequence of increasingly complex symmetries they exhibit. That is why Stillwell titled his paper on the 4-polytopes and the history of mathematics of more than 3 dimensions &quot;The Story of the 120-cell&quot;.

===Cartesian coordinates===
Natural Cartesian coordinates for a 4-polytope centered at the origin of 4-space occur in different frames of reference, depending on the long radius (center-to-vertex) chosen.

==== √8 radius coordinates ====
The 120-cell with long radius = 2 ≈ 2.828 has edge length 4−2φ = 3− ≈ 0.764. 

In this frame of reference, its 600 vertex coordinates are the {permutations} and of the following: 
where φ (also called 𝝉) is the golden ratio, ≈ 1.618.

==== Unit radius coordinates ====
The unit-radius 120-cell has edge length ≈ 0.270. 

In this frame of reference the 120-cell lies vertex up in standard orientation, and its coordinates are the {permutations} and in the left column below:
The table gives the coordinates of at least one instance of each 4-polytope, but the 120-cell contains multiples-of-five inscribed instances of each of its precursor 4-polytopes, occupying different subsets of its vertices. The (600-point) 120-cell is the convex hull of 5 disjoint (120-point) 600-cells. Each (120-point) 600-cell is the convex hull of 5 disjoint (24-point) 24-cells, so the 120-cell is the convex hull of 25 disjoint 24-cells. Each 24-cell is the convex hull of 3 disjoint (8-point) 16-cells, so the 120-cell is the convex hull of 75 disjoint 16-cells. Uniquely, the (600-point) 120-cell is the convex hull of 120 disjoint (5-point) 5-cells.

===Chords===

The 600-point 120-cell has all 8 of the 120-point 600-cell&#x27;s distinct chord lengths, plus two additional important chords: its own shorter edges, and the edges of its 120 inscribed regular 5-cells. These two additional chords give the 120-cell its characteristic isoclinic rotation, in addition to all the rotations of the other regular 4-polytopes which it inherits. They also give the 120-cell a characteristic great circle polygon: an &quot;irregular&quot; great hexagon in which three 120-cell edges alternate with three 5-cell edges.

The 120-cell&#x27;s edges do not form regular great circle polygons in a single central plane the way the edges of the 600-cell, 24-cell, and 16-cell do. Like the edges of the 5-cell and the 8-cell tesseract, they form zig-zag Petrie polygons instead. The 120-cell&#x27;s Petrie polygon is a triacontagon {30} zig-zag skew polygon.

Since the 120-cell has a circumference of 30 edges, it has 15 distinct chord lengths, ranging from its edge length to its diameter. Every regular convex 4-polytope is inscribed in the 120-cell, and the 15 chords enumerated in the rows of the following table are all the distinct chords that make up the regular 4-polytopes and their great circle polygons.
The first thing to notice about this table is that it has eight columns, not six; in addition to the six regular convex 4-polytopes, two irregular 4-polytopes occur naturally in the sequence of nested 4-polytopes: the 96-point snub 24-cell and the 480-point diminished 120-cell.

The second thing to notice is that each numbered row (each chord) is marked with a triangle , square ☐, phi symbol 𝜙 or pentagram ✩. The 15 chords form polygons of four kinds: great squares ☐ characteristic of the 16-cell, great hexagons and great triangles △ characteristic of the 24-cell, great decagons and great pentagons 𝜙 characteristic of the 600-cell, and skew pentagrams ✩ or decagrams characteristic of the 5-cell which are Petrie polygons that circle through a set of central planes and form face polygons but not great polygons.


The annotated chord table is a complete bill of materials for constructing the 120-cell. All of the 2-polytopes, 3-polytopes and 4-polytopes in the 120-cell are made from the 15 1-polytopes in the table.

The black integers in table cells are incidence counts of the row&#x27;s chord in the column&#x27;s 4-polytope. For example, in the #3 chord row, the 600-cell&#x27;s 72 great decagons contain 720 #3 chords in all.

The integers are the number of disjoint 4-polytopes above (the column label) which compounded form a 120-cell. For example, the 120-cell is a compound of disjoint 24-cells (25 * 24 vertices = 600 vertices).

The integers are the number of distinct 4-polytopes above (the column label) which can be picked out in the 120-cell. For example, the 120-cell contains distinct 24-cells which share components.

The integers in the right column are incidence counts of the row&#x27;s chord at each 120-cell vertex. For example, in the #3 chord row, #3 chords converge at each of the 120-cell&#x27;s 600 vertices, forming a double icosahedral vertex figure 2{3,5}. In total major chords of 15 distinct lengths meet at each vertex of the 120-cell.

=== Relationships among interior polytopes ===
The 120-cell is the compound of all five of the other regular convex 4-polytopes. All the relationships among the regular 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-polytopes occur in the 120-cell. It is a four-dimensional jigsaw puzzle in which all those polytopes are the parts. Although there are many sequences in which to construct the 120-cell by putting those parts together, ultimately they only fit together one way. The 120-cell is the unique solution to the combination of all these polytopes.

The regular 1-polytope occurs in only 15 distinct lengths in any of the component polytopes of the 120-cell. By Alexandrov&#x27;s uniqueness theorem, convex polyhedra with shapes distinct from each other also have distinct metric spaces of surface distances, so each regular 4-polytope has its own unique subset of these 15 chords.

Only 4 of those 15 chords occur in the 16-cell, 8-cell and 24-cell. The four , , and are sufficient to build the 24-cell and all its component parts. The 24-cell is the unique solution to the combination of these 4 chords and all the regular polytopes that can be built from them.

An additional 4 of the 15 chords are required to build the 600-cell. The four are square roots of irrational fractions that are functions of . The 600-cell is the unique solution to the combination of these 8 chords and all the regular polytopes that can be built from them. Notable among the new parts found in the 600-cell which do not occur in the 24-cell are pentagons, and icosahedra.

All 15 chords, and 15 other distinct chordal distances enumerated below, occur in the 120-cell. Notable among the new parts found in the 120-cell which do not occur in the 600-cell are 
The relationships between the &quot;regular&quot; 5-cell (the simplex regular 4-polytope) and the other regular 4-polytopes are manifest directly only in the 120-cell. The 600-point 120-cell is a compound of 120 disjoint 5-point 5-cells, and it is also a compound of 5 disjoint 120-point 600-cells (two different ways). Each 5-cell has one vertex in each of 5 disjoint 600-cells, and therefore in each of 5 disjoint 24-cells, 5 disjoint 8-cells, and 5 disjoint 16-cells. Each 5-cell is a ring (two different ways) joining 5 disjoint instances of each of the other regular 4-polytopes.

=== Geodesic rectangles ===
The 30 distinct chords found in the 120-cell occur as 15 pairs of 180° complements. They form 15 distinct kinds of great circle polygon that lie in central planes of several kinds: in an irregular dodecagon, in a regular decagon, and in several kinds of rectangle, including a square.

Each great circle polygon is characterized by its pair of 180° complementary chords. The chord pairs form great circle polygons with parallel opposing edges, so each great polygon is either a rectangle or a compound of a rectangle, with the two chords as the rectangle&#x27;s edges.

Each of the 15 complementary chord pairs corresponds to a distinct pair of opposing polyhedral sections of the 120-cell, beginning with a vertex, the 00 section. The correspondence is that each 120-cell vertex is surrounded by each polyhedral section&#x27;s vertices at a uniform distance (the chord length), the way a polyhedron&#x27;s vertices surround its center at the distance of its long radius. The #1 chord is the &quot;radius&quot; of the 10 section, the tetrahedral vertex figure of the 120-cell. The #14 chord is the &quot;radius&quot; of its congruent opposing 290 section. The #7 chord is the &quot;radius&quot; of the central section of the 120-cell, in which two opposing 150 sections are coincident.

===Concentric hulls===
These hulls illustrate sections 1 - 8 of the 120-cell beginning with a cell (hull 1). A &quot;section&quot; is a flat 3-dimensional hyperplane slice through the 3-sphere: a 2-sphere (ordinary sphere). It is dimensionally analogous to a flat 2-dimensional plane slice through a 2-sphere: a 1-sphere (ordinary circle). 

The hulls are illustrated as if they were all the same size, but actually they increase in radius as numbered: they are concentric 2-spheres that nest inside each other. Every cell of the 120-cell is the smallest hull in its own set of 8 concentric hulls. There are 120 distinct nesting sets of 8 hulls.

The 120-cell actually has 15 sections beginning with a cell, numbered 1 - 15 with number 8 in the center. After increasing in size from 1 to 8, the hulls get smaller again. Sections 1 and 15 are both a hull 1, the smallest hull, a dodecahedral cell of the 120-cell. Section 8 is the central section, the largest hull, with the same radius as the 120-cell. Except for the central section 8, the sections occur in parallel pairs, on either side of the central section. Hull 8 is dimensionally analogous to the equator, while hulls 1 - 7 are dimensionally analogous to lines of latitude. There are 120 of each kind of hull 1 - 7 in the 120-cell, but only 60 of the central hull 8.

===Polyhedral graph===
Considering the adjacency matrix of the vertices representing the polyhedral graph of the unit-radius 120-cell, the graph diameter is 15, connecting each vertex to its coordinate-negation at a Euclidean distance of 2 away (its circumdiameter), and there are 24 different paths to connect them along the polytope edges. From each vertex, there are 4 vertices at distance 1, 12 at distance 2, 24 at distance 3, 36 at distance 4, 52 at distance 5, 68 at distance 6, 76 at distance 7, 78 at distance 8, 72 at distance 9, 64 at distance 10, 56 at distance 11, 40 at distance 12, 12 at distance 13, 4 at distance 14, and 1 at distance 15. The adjacency matrix has 27 distinct eigenvalues ranging from ≈ 0.270, with a multiplicity of 4, to 2, with a multiplicity of 1. The multiplicity of eigenvalue 0 is 18, and the rank of the adjacency matrix is 582.

The vertices of the 120-cell polyhedral graph are 3-colorable.

The graph is Eulerian having degree 4 in every vertex. Its edge set can be decomposed into two Hamiltonian cycles.

=== Constructions ===
The 120-cell is the sixth in the sequence of 6 convex regular 4-polytopes (in order of size and complexity). It can be deconstructed into ten distinct instances (or five disjoint instances) of its predecessor (and dual) the 600-cell, just as the 600-cell can be deconstructed into twenty-five distinct instances (or five disjoint instances) of its predecessor the 24-cell, the 24-cell can be deconstructed into three distinct instances of its predecessor the tesseract (8-cell), and the 8-cell can be deconstructed into two disjoint instances of its predecessor (and dual) the 16-cell. The 120-cell contains 675 distinct instances (75 disjoint instances) of the 16-cell.

The reverse procedure to construct each of these from an instance of its predecessor preserves the radius of the predecessor, but generally produces a successor with a smaller edge length. The 600-cell&#x27;s edge length is ~0.618 times its radius (the inverse golden ratio), but the 120-cell&#x27;s edge length is ~0.270 times its radius.

The 120-cell is also the convex hull of the regular compound of 120 disjoint regular 5-cells. This can be seen to be equivalent to the compound of 5 disjoint 600-cells, as follows. Beginning with a single 120-point 600-cell, expand each vertex into a regular 5-cell. For each of the 120 vertices, add 4 new equidistant vertices, such that the 5 vertices form a regular 5-cell inscribed in the 3-sphere. The 120 5-cells are disjoint, and the 600 vertices form 5 disjoint 120-point 600-cells: a 120-cell.

==== Dual 600-cells ====
Since the 120-cell is the dual of the 600-cell, it can be constructed from the 600-cell by placing its 600 vertices at the center of volume of each of the 600 tetrahedral cells. From a 600-cell of unit long radius, this results in a 120-cell of slightly smaller long radius ( ≈ 0.926) and edge length of exactly 1/4. Thus the unit edge-length 120-cell (with long radius φ2 ≈ 3.702) can be constructed in this manner just inside a 600-cell of long radius 4. The unit radius 120-cell (with edge-length ≈ 0.270) can be constructed in this manner just inside a 600-cell of long radius ≈ 1.080.

Reciprocally, the unit-radius 120-cell can be constructed just outside a 600-cell of slightly smaller long radius ≈ 0.926, by placing the center of each dodecahedral cell at one of the 120 600-cell vertices. The 120-cell whose coordinates are given above of long radius = 2 ≈ 2.828 and edge-length = 3− ≈ 0.764 can be constructed in this manner just outside a 600-cell of long radius φ2, which is smaller than in the same ratio of ≈ 0.926; it is in the golden ratio to the edge length of the 600-cell, so that must be φ. The 120-cell of edge-length 2 and long radius φ2 ≈ 7.405 given by Coxeter can be constructed in this manner just outside a 600-cell of long radius φ4 and edge-length φ3.

Therefore, the unit-radius 120-cell can be constructed from its predecessor the unit-radius 600-cell in three reciprocation steps.

==== Cell rotations of inscribed duals ====
Since the 120-cell contains inscribed 600-cells, it contains its own dual of the same radius. The 120-cell contains five disjoint 600-cells (ten overlapping inscribed 600-cells of which we can pick out five disjoint 600-cells in two different ways), so it can be seen as a compound of five of its own dual (in two ways). The vertices of each inscribed 600-cell are vertices of the 120-cell, and (dually) each dodecahedral cell center is a tetrahedral cell center in each of the inscribed 600-cells. 

The dodecahedral cells of the 120-cell have tetrahedral cells of the 600-cells inscribed in them. Just as the 120-cell is a compound of five 600-cells (in two ways), the dodecahedron is a compound of five regular tetrahedra (in two ways). As two opposing tetrahedra can be inscribed in a cube, and five cubes can be inscribed in a dodecahedron, ten tetrahedra in five cubes can be inscribed in a dodecahedron: two opposing sets of five, with each set covering all 20 vertices and each vertex in two tetrahedra (one from each set, but not the opposing pair of a cube obviously). This shows that the 120-cell contains, among its many interior features, 120 compounds of ten tetrahedra, each of which is dimensionally analogous to the whole 120-cell as a compound of ten 600-cells.

All ten tetrahedra can be generated by two chiral five-click rotations of any one tetrahedron. In each dodecahedral cell, one tetrahedral cell comes from each of the ten 600-cells inscribed in the 120-cell. Therefore the whole 120-cell, with all ten inscribed 600-cells, can be generated from just one 600-cell by rotating its cells.

==== Augmentation ====
Another consequence of the 120-cell containing inscribed 600-cells is that it is possible to construct it by placing 4-pyramids of some kind on the cells of the 600-cell. These tetrahedral pyramids must be quite irregular in this case (with the apex blunted into four &#x27;apexes&#x27;), but we can discern their shape in the way a tetrahedron lies inscribed in a dodecahedron.

Only 120 tetrahedral cells of each 600-cell can be inscribed in the 120-cell&#x27;s dodecahedra; its other 480 tetrahedra span dodecahedral cells. Each dodecahedron-inscribed tetrahedron is the center cell of a cluster of five tetrahedra, with the four others face-bonded around it lying only partially within the dodecahedron. The central tetrahedron is edge-bonded to an additional 12 tetrahedral cells, also lying only partially within the dodecahedron. The central cell is vertex-bonded to 40 other tetrahedral cells which lie entirely outside the dodecahedron.

==== Weyl orbits ====
Another construction method uses quaternions and the Icosahedral symmetry of Weyl group orbits formula_1 of order 120. The following describe formula_2 and formula_3 24-cells as quaternion orbit weights of D4 under the Weyl group W(D4):
O(0100) : T = {±1,±e1,±e2,±e3,(±1±e1±e2±e3)/2}
O(1000) : V1
O(0010) : V2
O(0001) : V3

formula_4

With quaternions formula_5 where formula_6 is the conjugate of formula_7 and formula_8 and formula_9, then the Coxeter group formula_10 is the symmetry group of the 600-cell and the 120-cell of order 14400.

Given formula_11 such that formula_12 and formula_13 as an exchange of formula_14 within formula_7, we can construct:

* the snub 24-cell formula_16
* the 600-cell formula_17 
* the 120-cell formula_18
* the alternate snub 24-cell formula_19
* the dual snub 24-cell = formula_20.

=== As a configuration ===
This configuration matrix represents the 120-cell. The rows and columns correspond to vertices, edges, faces, and cells. The diagonal numbers say how many of each element occur in the whole 120-cell. The nondiagonal numbers say how many of the column&#x27;s element occur in or at the row&#x27;s element.

formula_21

Here is the configuration expanded with &quot;k&quot;-face elements and &quot;k&quot;-figures. The diagonal element counts are the ratio of the full Coxeter group order, 14400, divided by the order of the subgroup with mirror removal.
== Visualization ==
The 120-cell consists of 120 dodecahedral cells. For visualization purposes, it is convenient that the dodecahedron has opposing parallel faces (a trait it shares with the cells of the tesseract and the 24-cell). One can stack dodecahedrons face to face in a straight line bent in the 4th direction into a great circle with a circumference of 10 cells. Starting from this initial ten cell construct there are two common visualizations one can use: a layered stereographic projection, and a structure of intertwining rings (discrete Hopf fibration).

=== Layered stereographic projection ===
The cell locations lend themselves to a hyperspherical description. Pick an arbitrary dodecahedron and label it the &quot;north pole&quot;. Twelve great circle meridians (four cells long) radiate out in 3 dimensions, converging at the fifth &quot;south pole&quot; cell. This skeleton accounts for 50 of the 120 cells (2 + 4 × 12).

Starting at the North Pole, we can build up the 120-cell in 9 latitudinal layers, with allusions to terrestrial 2-sphere topography in the table below. With the exception of the poles, the centroids of the cells of each layer lie on a separate 2-sphere, with the equatorial centroids lying on a great 2-sphere. The centroids of the 30 equatorial cells form the vertices of an icosidodecahedron, with the meridians (as described above) passing through the center of each pentagonal face. The cells labeled &quot;interstitial&quot; in the following table do not fall on meridian great circles.
The cells of layers 2, 4, 6 and 8 are located over the faces of the pole cell. The cells of layers 3 and 7 are located directly over the vertices of the pole cell. The cells of layer 5 are located over the edges of the pole cell.

=== Intertwining rings ===
The 120-cell can be partitioned into 12 disjoint 10-cell great circle rings, forming a discrete/quantized Hopf fibration. Starting with one 10-cell ring, one can place another ring alongside it that spirals around the original ring one complete revolution in ten cells. Five such 10-cell rings can be placed adjacent to the original 10-cell ring. Although the outer rings &quot;spiral&quot; around the inner ring (and each other), they actually have no helical torsion. They are all equivalent. The spiraling is a result of the 3-sphere curvature. The inner ring and the five outer rings now form a six ring, 60-cell solid torus. One can continue adding 10-cell rings adjacent to the previous ones, but it&#x27;s more instructive to construct a second torus, disjoint from the one above, from the remaining 60 cells, that interlocks with the first. The 120-cell, like the 3-sphere, is the union of these two (Clifford) tori. If the center ring of the first torus is a meridian great circle as defined above, the center ring of the second torus is the equatorial great circle that is centered on the meridian circle. Also note that the spiraling shell of 50 cells around a center ring can be either left handed or right handed. It&#x27;s just a matter of partitioning the cells in the shell differently, i.e. picking another set of disjoint (Clifford parallel) great circles.

=== Other great circle constructs ===
There is another great circle path of interest that alternately passes through opposing cell vertices, then along an edge. This path consists of 6 edges alternating with 6 cell diameter chords, forming an irregular dodecagon in a central plane. Both these great circle paths have dual great circle paths in the 600-cell. The 10 cell face to face path above maps to a 10 vertex path solely traversing along edges in the 600-cell, forming a decagon. The alternating cell/edge path maps to a path consisting of 12 tetrahedrons alternately meeting face to face then vertex to vertex (six triangular bipyramids) in the 600-cell. This latter path corresponds to a ring of six icosahedra meeting face to face in the snub 24-cell (or icosahedral pyramids in the 600-cell), forming a hexagon.

Another great circle polygon path exists which is unique to the 120-cell and has no dual counterpart in the 600-cell. This path consists of 3 120-cell edges alternating with 3 inscribed 5-cell edges (#8 chords), forming the irregular great hexagon with alternating short and long edges illustrated above. Each 5-cell edge runs through the volume of three dodecahedral cells (in a ring of ten face-bonded dodecahedral cells), to the opposite pentagonal face of the third dodecahedron. This irregular great hexagon lies in the same central plane (on the same great circle) as the irregular great dodecagon described above, but it intersects only {6} of the {12} dodecagon vertices. There are two irregular great hexagons inscribed in each irregular great dodecagon, in alternate positions.

=== Perspective projections ===
As in all the illustrations in this article, only the edges of the 120-cell appear in these renderings. All the other chords are not shown. The complex interior parts of the 120-cell, all its inscribed 600-cells, 24-cells, 8-cells, 16-cells and 5-cells, are completely invisible in all illustrations. The viewer must imagine them.

These projections use perspective projection, from a specific viewpoint in four dimensions, projecting the model as a 3D shadow. Therefore, faces and cells that look larger are merely closer to the 4D viewpoint.

A comparison of perspective projections of the 3D dodecahedron to 2D (below left), and projections of the 4D 120-cell to 3D (below right), demonstrates two related perspective projection methods, by dimensional analogy. Schlegel diagrams use perspective to show depth in the dimension which has been flattened, choosing a view point &quot;above&quot; a specific cell, thus making that cell the envelope of the model, with other cells appearing smaller inside it. Stereographic projections use the same approach, but are shown with curved edges, representing the spherical polytope as a tiling of a 3-sphere. Both these methods distort the object, because the cells are not actually nested inside each other (they meet face-to-face), and they are all the same size. Other perspective projection methods exist, such as the rotating animations above, which do not exhibit this particular kind of distortion, but rather some other kind of distortion (as all projections must).

=== Orthogonal projections ===
Orthogonal projections of the 120-cell can be done in 2D by defining two orthonormal basis vectors for a specific view direction. The 30-gonal projection was made in 1963 by B. L. Chilton.

The H3 decagonal projection shows the plane of the van Oss polygon.

3-dimensional orthogonal projections can also be made with three orthonormal basis vectors, and displayed as a 3d model, and then projecting a certain perspective in 3D for a 2d image.

The 120-cell is one of 15 regular and uniform polytopes with the same H4 symmetry [3,3,5]:
=== {p,3,3} polytopes ===
The 120-cell is similar to three regular 4-polytopes: the 5-cell {3,3,3} and tesseract {4,3,3} of Euclidean 4-space, and the hexagonal tiling honeycomb {6,3,3} of hyperbolic space. All of these have a tetrahedral vertex figure {3,3}:
=== {5,3,p} polytopes ===
The 120-cell is a part of a sequence of 4-polytopes and honeycombs with dodecahedral cells:
=== Tetrahedrally diminished 120-cell ===
Since the 600-point 120-cell has 5 disjoint inscribed 600-cells, it can be diminished by the removal of one of those 120-point 600-cells, creating an irregular 480-point 4-polytope. 
Each dodecahedral cell of the 120-cell is diminished by removal of 4 of its 20 vertices, creating an irregular 16-point polyhedron called the tetrahedrally diminished dodecahedron because the 4 vertices removed formed a tetrahedron inscribed in the dodecahedron. Since the vertex figure of the dodecahedron is the triangle, each truncated vertex is replaced by a triangle. The 12 pentagon faces are replaced by 12 trapezoids, as one vertex of each pentagon is removed and two of its edges are replaced by the pentagon&#x27;s diagonal chord. The tetrahedrally diminished dodecahedron has 16 vertices and 16 faces: 12 trapezoid faces and four equilateral triangle faces. 

Since the vertex figure of the 120-cell is the tetrahedron, each truncated vertex is replaced by a tetrahedron, leaving 120 tetrahedrally diminished dodecahedron cells and 120 regular tetrahedron cells. The regular dodecahedron and the tetrahedrally diminished dodecahedron both have 30 edges, and the regular 120-cell and the tetrahedrally diminished 120-cell both have 1200 edges.

The 480-point diminished 120-cell may be called the tetrahedrally diminished 120-cell because its cells are tetrahedrally diminished, or the 600-cell diminished 120-cell because the vertices removed formed a 600-cell inscribed in the 120-cell, or even the regular 5-cells diminished 120-cell because removing the 120 vertices removes one vertex from each of the 120 inscribed regular 5-cells, leaving 120 regular tetrahedra.

=== Davis 120-cell ===
The Davis 120-cell, introduced by , is a compact 4-dimensional hyperbolic manifold obtained by identifying opposite faces of the 120-cell, whose universal cover gives the regular honeycomb {5,3,3,5} of 4-dimensional hyperbolic space.

<text>The Nith River is a river in Brant, Oxford and Perth counties and the Regional Municipality of Waterloo in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. The Nith River is approximately 125km in length and empties into the Grand River at the town of Paris. It is named after the River Nith in Scotland.

==Course==
The Nith river begins in a woodland northwest of Crosshill and west of Waterloo Regional Road 5 in the township of Wellesley, Region of Waterloo. It heads north into Perth County, then turns sharply southwest and passes through the communities of Fernbank and Millbank in Perth East. It continues south, takes in the right tributary Smith Creek and arrives at the community of Nithburg. The river flows east back into Waterloo Region, takes in the right tributary Silver Creek, and then the left tributary Firella Creek south of the community of Wellesley in the township of Wellesley. The river turns south into the township of Wilmot, takes in the left tributary Bamberg Creek and passes through the communities of Phillipsburg and New Hamburg, Ontario. The Nith continues south, takes in the left tributaries Baden Creek and Hunsburger Creek, enters into Blandford-Blenheim, Oxford County and reaches the community of Plattsville. The river turns east, takes in the right tributary Black Creek, and left tributaries Hiller Creek, Alder Creek and Eden Creek, passes back into Waterloo Region, and reaches the community of Ayr in the township of North Dumfries, where it takes in the left tributary Cedar Creek. It then turns sharply west, flows back into Oxford County, then turns southeast passing through the communities of Wolverton and Canning. The Nith then flows into Brant County, takes in the right tributary Mud Creek and left tributary Charlie Creek, passing Barker&#x27;s Bush and reaching its mouth at the Grand River in Paris.

== Recreation ==
The Nith River is flat water with a few riffles, but rain and snowmelt can significantly increase the flow rate. In the early spring the maximum flow rate reaches a median value of 30 and mean of 40, but commonly exceeds 200 m3/s, causing major flooding in the flat regions upstream such as in and around New Hamburg. The Nith offers excellent paddling conditions in April, including a set of Class III whitewater rapids as the Nith enters Paris, yet by May, the flow rate drops below 5 m3/s and becomes unsuitable for paddling.

The river is under the auspices of the Grand River Conservation Authority.

Wayne Gretzky stated on the April 26, 2022 episode of the podcast Spittin&#x27; Chiclets that the first time he ice skated was at 2 1/2 years-old on the frozen Nith River in his grandfolks&#x27; back yard.

<text>In mathematics, an algebraic stack is a vast generalization of algebraic spaces, or schemes, which are foundational for studying moduli theory. Many moduli spaces are constructed using techniques specific to algebraic stacks, such as Artin&#x27;s representability theorem, which is used to construct the moduli space of pointed algebraic curves formula_1 and the moduli stack of elliptic curves. Originally, they were introduced by Alexander Grothendieck to keep track of automorphisms on moduli spaces, a technique which allows for treating these moduli spaces as if their underlying schemes or algebraic spaces are smooth. After Grothendieck developed the general theory of descent, and Giraud the general theory of stacks, the notion of algebraic stacks was defined by Michael Artin.

== Definition ==

=== Motivation ===
One of the motivating examples of an algebraic stack is to consider a groupoid scheme formula_2 over a fixed scheme formula_3. For example, if formula_4 (where formula_5 is the group scheme of roots of unity), formula_6, formula_7 is the projection map, formula_8 is the group actionformula_9and formula_10 is the multiplication mapformula_11on formula_5. Then, given an formula_3-scheme formula_14, the groupoid scheme formula_15 forms a groupoid (where formula_16 are their associated functors). Moreover, this construction is functorial on formula_17 forming a contravariant 2-functorformula_18where formula_19 is the 2-category of small categories. Another way to view this is as a fibred category formula_20 through the Grothendieck construction. Getting the correct technical conditions, such as the Grothendieck topology on formula_17, gives the definition of an algebraic stack. For instance, in the associated groupoid of formula_22-points for a field formula_22, over the origin object formula_24 there is the groupoid of automorphisms formula_25. However, in order to get an algebraic stack from formula_26, and not just a stack, there are additional technical hypotheses required for formula_26.

=== Algebraic stacks ===
It turns out using the fppf-topology (faithfully flat and locally of finite presentation) on formula_17, denoted formula_29, forms the basis for defining algebraic stacks. Then, an algebraic stack is a fibered categoryformula_30such that

# formula_31 is a category fibered in groupoids, meaning the overcategory for some formula_14 is a groupoid
# The diagonal map formula_33 of fibered categories is representable as algebraic spaces
# There exists an formula_34 scheme formula_35 and an associated 1-morphism of fibered categories formula_36 which is surjective and smooth called an atlas.

==== Explanation of technical conditions ====

===== Using the fppf topology =====
First of all, the fppf-topology is used because it behaves well with respect to descent. For example, if there are schemes formula_37 and formula_38can be refined to an fppf-cover of formula_39, if formula_40 is flat, locally finite type, or locally of finite presentation, then formula_39 has this property. this kind of idea can be extended further by considering properties local either on the target or the source of a morphism formula_42. For a cover formula_43 we say a property formula_44 is local on the source ifformula_42 has formula_44 if and only if each formula_47 has formula_44.There is an analogous notion on the target called local on the target. This means given a cover formula_49formula_42 has formula_44 if and only if each formula_52 has formula_44.For the fppf topology, having an immersion is local on the target. In addition to the previous properties local on the source for the fppf topology, formula_54 being universally open is also local on the source. Also, being locally Noetherian and Jacobson are local on the source and target for the fppf topology. This does not hold in the fpqc topology, making it not as &quot;nice&quot; in terms of technical properties. Even though this is true, using algebraic stacks over the fpqc topology still has its use, such as in chromatic homotopy theory. This is because the Moduli stack of formal group laws formula_55 is an fpqc-algebraic stackpg 40.

===== Representable diagonal =====
By definition, a 1-morphism formula_56 of categories fibered in groupoids is representable by algebraic spaces if for any fppf morphism formula_35 of schemes and any 1-morphism formula_58, the associated category fibered in groupoidsformula_59is representable as an algebraic space, meaning there exists an algebraic spaceformula_60such that the associated fibered category formula_61 is equivalent to formula_59. There are a number of equivalent conditions for representability of the diagonal which help give intuition for this technical condition, but one of main motivations is the following: for a scheme formula_63 and objects formula_64 the sheaf formula_65 is representable as an algebraic space. In particular, the stabilizer group for any point on the stack formula_66 is representable as an algebraic space.

Another important equivalence of having a representable diagonal is the technical condition that the intersection of any two algebraic spaces in an algebraic stack is an algebraic space. Reformulated using fiber productsformula_67the representability of the diagonal is equivalent to formula_68 being representable for an algebraic space formula_39. This is because given morphisms formula_70 from algebraic spaces, they extend to maps formula_71 from the diagonal map. There is an analogous statement for algebraic spaces which gives representability of a sheaf on formula_72 as an algebraic space.

Note that an analogous condition of representability of the diagonal holds for some formulations of higher stacks where the fiber product is an formula_73-stack for an formula_74-stack formula_31.

==== Surjective and smooth atlas ====

===== 2-Yoneda lemma =====
The existence of an formula_34 scheme formula_35 and a 1-morphism of fibered categories formula_36 which is surjective and smooth depends on defining a smooth and surjective morphisms of fibered categories. Here formula_79 is the algebraic stack from the representable functor formula_80 on formula_81 upgraded to a category fibered in groupoids where the categories only have trivial morphisms. This means the setformula_82is considered as a category, denoted formula_83, with objects in formula_84 as formula_34 morphismsformula_86and morphisms are the identity morphism. Henceformula_87is a 2-functor of groupoids. Showing this 2-functor is a sheaf is the content of the 2-Yoneda lemma. Using the Grothendieck construction, there is an associated category fibered in groupoids denoted formula_36.

===== Representable morphisms of categories fibered in groupoids =====
To say this morphism formula_36 is smooth or surjective, we have to introduce representable morphisms. A morphism formula_90 of categories fibered in groupoids over formula_91 is said to be representable if given an object formula_92 in formula_91 and an object formula_94 the 2-fibered product formula_95is representable by a scheme. Then, we can say the morphism of categories fibered in groupoids formula_96 is smooth and surjective if the associated morphismformula_97of schemes is smooth and surjective.

=== Deligne–Mumford stacks ===
Algebraic stacks, also known as Artin stacks, are by definition equipped with a smooth surjective atlas formula_36, where formula_79 is the stack associated to some scheme formula_35. If the atlas formula_101 is moreover étale, then formula_31 is said to be a Deligne–Mumford stack. The subclass of Deligne-Mumford stacks is useful because it provides the correct setting for many natural stacks considered, such as the moduli stack of algebraic curves. In addition, they are strict enough that object represented by points in Deligne-Mumford stacks do not have infinitesimal automorphisms. This is very important because infinitesimal automorphisms make studying the deformation theory of Artin stacks very difficult. For example, the deformation theory of the Artin stack formula_103, the moduli stack of rank formula_74 vector bundles, has infinitesimal automorphisms controlled partially by the Lie algebra formula_105. This leads to an infinite sequence of deformations and obstructions in general, which is one of the motivations for studying moduli of stable bundles. Only in the special case of the deformation theory of line bundles formula_106 is the deformation theory tractable, since the associated Lie algebra is abelian.

Note that many stacks cannot be naturally represented as Deligne-Mumford stacks because it only allows for finite covers, or, algebraic stacks with finite covers. Note that because every Etale cover is flat and locally of finite presentation, algebraic stacks defined with the fppf-topology subsume this theory; but, it is still useful since many stacks found in nature are of this form, such as the moduli of curves formula_107. Also, the differential-geometric analogue of such stacks are called orbifolds. The Etale condition implies the 2-functorformula_108sending a scheme to its groupoid of formula_5-torsors is representable as a stack over the Etale topology, but the Picard-stack formula_110 of formula_111-torsors (equivalently the category of line bundles) is not representable. Stacks of this form are representable as stacks over the fppf-topology.

Another reason for considering the fppf-topology versus the etale topology is over characteristic formula_96 the Kummer sequenceformula_113is exact only as a sequence of fppf sheaves, but not as a sequence of etale sheaves.

=== Defining algebraic stacks over other topologies ===
Using other Grothendieck topologies on formula_114 gives alternative theories of algebraic stacks which are either not general enough, or don&#x27;t behave well with respect to exchanging properties from the base of a cover to the total space of a cover. It is useful to recall there is the following hierarchy of generalizationformula_115of big topologies on formula_114.

== Structure sheaf ==
The structure sheaf of an algebraic stack is an object pulled back from a universal structure sheaf formula_117 on the site formula_91. This universal structure sheaf is defined asformula_119and the associated structure sheaf on a category fibered in groupoidsformula_120is defined asformula_121where formula_122 comes from the map of Grothendieck topologies. In particular, this means is formula_123 lies over formula_63, so formula_125, then formula_126. As a sanity check, it&#x27;s worth comparing this to a category fibered in groupoids coming from an formula_3-scheme formula_40 for various topologies. For example, if formula_129is a category fibered in groupoids over formula_91, the structure sheaf for an open subscheme formula_131 givesformula_132so this definition recovers the classic structure sheaf on a scheme. Moreover, for a quotient stack formula_133, the structure sheaf this just gives the formula_134-invariant sectionsformula_135for formula_136 in formula_91.

== Examples ==

=== Classifying stacks ===

Many classifying stacks for algebraic groups are algebraic stacks. In fact, for an algebraic group space formula_134 over a scheme formula_3 which is flat of finite presentation, the stack formula_140 is algebraictheorem 6.1.

<text>Krosno Odrzańskie () is a town in Lubusz Voivodeship in western Poland, on the east bank of Oder River, at the confluence with the Bóbr. With 11,319 inhabitants (2019) it is the capital of Krosno County.

==History==

The town was first mentioned as &quot;Crosno&quot; in 1005, when Duke Bolesław I Chrobry of Poland had a fortress built here in the course of his armed conflict with Emperor Henry II and the West Slavic Veleti confederation. Due to its strategic location as a point of passage across the Oder, it played an important role at the western border of the Polish kingdom with the Holy Roman Empire during the 11th to 13th centuries. As a result of the fragmentation of Poland, in 1163 Krosno was part of the Duchy of Silesia ruled by Bolesław I the Tall of the Silesian Piasts. In 1201 it received its town charter by Bolesław&#x27;s son Duke Henry I the Bearded. Henry erected a stone castle at Krosno, where he died in 1238 and where his widow, Hedwig of Andechs, took refuge during the 1241 first Mongol invasion of Poland. When the Duchy of Wrocław was finally divided in 1251, the town became part of the newly created Duchy of Głogów under Konrad I.

The town changed hands several times; once it was given as payment to soldiers of the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg. When the last Piast duke Henry XI of Głogów died without issue in 1476, his widow Barbara of Brandenburg, daughter of Elector Albert Achilles of Brandenburg, inherited the territory of Krosno. The Brandenburg influence met with fierce opposition by Henry&#x27;s cousin Duke Jan II the Mad of Żagań, who devastated Krosno but in 1482 had to sign an agreement with Albert Achilles, who was able to retain the Krosno (&quot;Crossen&quot;) area. As a former part of the Duchy of Głogów it officially remained a lien of the Bohemian kingdom until in 1538 King Ferdinand I of Habsburg, renounced all rights to &quot;Crossen&quot; in 1538, thereby finalizing the district&#x27;s belonging to the Neumark region of the Brandenburg margraviate.
With Brandenburg, Crossen became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701. In reforms after the Napoleonic Wars, the town became part of the Province of Brandenburg in 1815 and was the seat of Landkreis Crossen as part of Regierungsbezirk Frankfurt. As a result of the Unification of Germany, it became part of the German Empire in 1871. In May 1886 the town was devastated by a whirlwind.

In 1945 during World War II, the town was conquered by the Soviet Red Army. After Germany&#x27;s defeat in the war, the town once again became part of Poland. Already in March 1945 the town was claimed by the Polish state, with the assignment of the town being switched back and forth between Western Pomerania and Lower Silesia several times. On May 2, a group of Polish communists from Poznań arrived to assume administration of the town. The situation complicated when another group with 66 members arrived, who likewise intended to rule the town. By June 1945, conflicts between these groups had been resolved. The adjective &quot;Odrzańskie&quot; after the Oder river, upon which the town is situated, was added for distinction from other settlements of the same name in Poland, most notably the town of Krosno.

From 1975 to 1998, it was administratively located in the Zielona Góra Voivodeship.

<doc id="717402" wikidata="Q542946" url="?curid=717402" title="Hyperdontia">
<text>Hyperdontia is the condition of having supernumerary teeth, or teeth that appear in addition to the regular number of teeth (32 in the average adult). They can appear in any area of the dental arch and can affect any dental organ. The opposite of hyperdontia is hypodontia, where there is a congenital lack of teeth, which is a condition seen more commonly than hyperdontia. The scientific definition of hyperdontia is &quot;any tooth or odontogenic structure that is formed from tooth germ in excess of usual number for any given region of the dental arch.&quot; The additional teeth, which may be few or many, can occur on any place in the dental arch. Their arrangement may be symmetrical or non-symmetrical.

==Signs and symptoms==
The presence of a supernumerary tooth, particularly when seen in young children, is associated with a disturbance of the maxillary incisor region. This commonly results in the impaction of the incisors during the mixed dentition stage. The study debating this also considered many other factors such as: the patient&#x27;s age, number, morphology, growth orientation and position of the supernumerary tooth. Alongside this issue, the presence of an extra tooth can impede the eruption of adjacent additional or normal teeth. Therefore, the presence of a supernumerary tooth when found must be approached with the appropriate treatment plan, incorporating the likelihood of incisal crowding. In some individuals, the additional teeth can erupt far from the dental arch, within the maxillary sinus. The extra teeth may also migrate to a different location after development. In some cases, supernumerary teeth can lead to the formation of cysts. Crowding is also frequently seen in people with hyperdontia.

==Causes==
There is evidence of hereditary factors along with some evidence of environmental factors leading to this condition. While a single excess tooth is relatively common, multiple hyperdontia is rare in people with no other associated diseases or syndromes. Many supernumerary teeth never erupt, but they may delay eruption of nearby teeth or cause other dental or orthodontic problems. Molar-type extra teeth are the most common type. Dental X-rays are often used to diagnose hyperdontia.

It is suggested that supernumerary teeth develop from a third tooth bud arising from the dental lamina near the regular tooth bud or possibly from splitting the regular tooth bud itself. Supernumerary teeth in deciduous (baby) teeth are less common than in permanent teeth.

===Evolution===
Specific genes play a role in determining the number and pattern of teeth that develop in an individual, and mutations or variations in these genes can result in the formation of extra teeth. An individual can inherit a genetic predisposition to hyperdontia from its parents. If an individual with hyperdontia reproduces, their offspring have an increased likelihood of having the same condition, as their offspring have an increased likelihood of having the same condition because hyperdontia has been proposed as having an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. This is the result of mutations that can be passed on to offspring through several different genes associated with tooth development. The MSX1 and MSX2 genes are among the most well-documented genetic factors associated with hyperdontia. Because these genes play a crucial role in tooth development and patterning, mutations in MSX1 and MSX2 can lead to the formation of extra teeth or changes in tooth number and shape. Additionally, mutations in the AXIN2 gene have been linked to hyperdontia and other anomalous dental traits. The AXIN2 gene is involved in regulating the Wnt signaling pathway, which plays a role in tooth development. Therefore, variations in this gene can disrupt tooth development and result in supernumerary teeth. PAX9 is another gene important to tooth development, and mutations in this gene have been associated with dental anomalies, including hyperdontia. PAX9 is involved in the formation of molar teeth, and disruptions in its function can lead to extra molars or changes in tooth morphology.

The formation of teeth begins during embryonic development and is a process that is highly regulated by various signaling pathways, which, if disrupted as a result of genetic mutations or environmental factors, can lead to developmental anomalies, including hyperdontia. Tooth development begins with the formation of tooth buds in the jaw. The dental lamina is a band of tissue in the developing oral cavity that gives rise to tooth buds. Hyperactivity of the dental lamina, as well as disruption of the differentiation and morphogenesis stages of tooth development, can lead to the formation of extra tooth buds, which can develop into supernumerary teeth. 
Furthermore, some developmental syndromes or medical conditions may also result in hyperdontia. For instance, cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is a genetic disorder that affects skeletal and dental development and is associated with the presence of supernumerary teeth. Trauma or injury to the oral cavity, particularly during tooth development, also has the potential to trigger the formation of supernumerary teeth because it disrupts normal tooth development. Occasionally, additional teeth may also arise from developmental anomalies like fusion or gemination. Fusion occurs when two tooth buds fuse together, creating a single, larger tooth. Gemination involves the incomplete division of a single tooth bud into two teeth. In some cases, these anomalies may take the form of the appearance of extra teeth. 

Evolutionarily, hyperdontia can be seen as a result of genetic variation. Although extra teeth may be a maladaptive trait in modern humans due to potential dental issues and crowding, whether individuals with supernumerary teeth have a benefit or disadvantage is unknown. In the context of human evolutionary history, dental care was virtually nonexistent, meaning that there was no way to address dental issues such as tooth decay, infection, or loss of teeth. Therefore, individuals with supernumerary teeth may have been better equipped to cope with dental problems, for the loss of necessary teeth could be alleviated by having extra teeth present so that chewing and processing food remained possible. Furthermore, ancestral diets were often tougher and required more extensive chewing, meaning that being in the possession of extra teeth could help to facilitate the consumption of fibrous plant material and raw foods. 

===Related conditions===
Hyperdontia is seen in a number of disorders, including Gardner&#x27;s syndrome and cleidocranial dysostosis, where multiple supernumerary teeth develop.

Other associated conditions are: Cleidocranial dysplasia, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome Type III, Ellis–van Creveld syndrome, Gardner&#x27;s syndrome, Goldenhar syndrome, Hallermann–Streiff syndrome, Orofaciodigital syndrome type I, Incontinentia pigmenti, Marfan syndrome, Nance–Horan syndrome, and Tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndrome Type 1.

== Diagnosis ==

Supernumerary teeth may be detected by taking two different dental X-rays at different angles. Examples of this may be an intra-oral X-ray (one that is taken inside the mouth) and a panoramic radiograph. However, these X-rays are 2D and therefore do not accurately portray the 3D view of the teeth.

===Types===

Supernumerary teeth can be classified by shape and by position. The shapes include the following:
* Supplemental (where the tooth has a normal shape for the teeth in that series);
* Tuberculate (also called &quot;barrel shaped&quot;);
* Conical (also called &quot;peg shaped&quot;);
* Compound odontoma (multiple small tooth-like forms);
* Complex odontoma (a disorganized mass of dental tissue)

When classified by position, a supernumerary tooth may be referred to as a &quot;mesiodens&quot;, a &quot;paramolar&quot;, or a &quot;distomolar&quot;. Occasionally, these teeth do not erupt into the oral cavity but manifest as a malocclusion.

The most common supernumerary tooth is a mesiodens, which is a malformed, peg-like tooth that occurs between the maxillary central incisors.

Fourth and fifth molars that form behind the third molars are another kind of supernumerary teeth.
==Treatment==
Although these teeth are usually asymptomatic and pose no threat to the individual, they are often extracted for aesthetic reasons, to allow the eruption of other teeth, orthodontic reasons and/or suspected pathology. This is done particularly if the mesiodens is positioned in the maxillary central incisor region. The traditional method of removal is done by using bone chisels, although a more advanced technique has been found to be more beneficial, especially if surgery is required. Through the use of piezoelectricity, piezoelectric ultrasonic bone surgery may be more time-consuming than the traditional method but it seems to reduce the post-operative bleeding and associated complications quite significantly.

==Epidemiology==
It is evident that hyperdontia is more common in the permanent dentition than in the primary. There is a considerable difference between males and females in the prevalence of these teeth in permanent dentition; hyperdontia is twice as common in males as in females. However, this approximation varies in terms of location, other associating syndromes that may be present, and the ethnicity of the individual. In terms of ethnicity, it can be seen that hyperdontia is in fact less common in European than in Asian populations. There is evidence to show that an individual is more likely to have hyperdontia if other members of their family also have the condition.

==Famous people with hyperdontia==
The actor Gaten Matarazzo had hyperdontia but underwent surgery to remove his extraneous teeth. 

David DeVore Jr. gained internet fame after being filmed after removing a supernumerary tooth at the dentist. 

Kalpana Balan, an Indian woman entered Guinness World Records for having the most teeth in a human mouth.

== Historical mentions ==

Timarchos (either son or father of Nicocles of Paphos) is said to have had &quot;a double row of cheek-teeth.&quot;

The daughter of Mithridates VI, Drypetina, is said to have a double row of teeth.

Agrippina the Younger, sister of Caligula, wife of Claudius, and mother of Nero, is said to have had a double canine in her right upper jaw, something that was seen as a sign of good fortune by the Romans.

The semi-mythological Emperor Ku is attributed with this condition. 

One of the Great Peacemaker&#x27;s names is &quot;Deganawidah,&quot; which has been translated by some to mean &quot;Double Row of Teeth.&quot;

Realdo Colombo, a 16th-century physician, mentioned in his writings that one of his sons, Phoebus, had &quot;a treble row of teeth&quot;

Louis XIII had a double row of teeth in one of his jaws, which impacted his speech.

Fabian Fournier, a 19th-century Canadian lumberjack (who is said to have inspired the American folklore figure Paul Bunyan)

William Morgan (an anti-mason who was found dead under suspicious circumstances) was identified by his wife, as she recognized the body by his having &quot;double teeth all around&quot;

Freddie Mercury of Queen had four extra teeth in his upper jaw. He was self-conscious of this, so he often covered them up with his lip or hand, and by growing a mustache. Mercury refused to correct his alignment issue because he believed it contributed to his incredible singing range and that correcting his teeth would negatively affect his voice.

Peter Steele is said to have had hyperdontia.

== Folklore and mythology ==

A poem by ancient Greek poet Ion describe the hero Heracles as having three rows of teeth.

Len Linfhiaclach (lit. &quot;Len of the Many Teeth&quot;), a goldsmith who lived about the year 300, is the subject of Gaelic text &quot;Dindseanchas&quot;

Tukwishhemish is a character from a Cahuilla folk tale, a beautiful woman who smiled but never laughed on account of her having double rows of teeth in her upper jaw.

Witches in certain parts of Estonia are said to be able to be recognized by having unusual teeth including double rows of teeth, giving rise to their being called &quot;hambamees&quot; (lit. &quot;tooth-man&quot;); so as well can the Slavic upyr be recognized by its double rows of teeth.

== Literature ==
&quot;A Legend of MacAlister More&quot; (1828) features the character of Duncan Roy or &quot;Duncan Roy tda reugh cachghlin&quot; or &quot;Red Duncan of the two rows of teeth.&quot;

<text>Canoe slalom (previously known as whitewater slalom) is a competitive sport with the aim to navigate a decked canoe or kayak through a course of hanging downstream or upstream gates on river rapids in the fastest time possible. It is one of two kayak and canoeing disciplines at the Summer Olympics, and is referred to by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as Canoe/Kayak Slalom. The other Olympic canoeing discipline is canoe sprint. Wildwater canoeing is a non-Olympic paddlesport.

==History==
Canoe slalom racing started in Switzerland in 1933, initially on a flatwater course. In 1946, the International Canoe Federation (ICF), which governs the sport, was formed. The first World Championships were held in 1949 in Switzerland. From 1949 to 1999, the championships were held every odd-numbered year and have been held annually in non-Summer Olympic years since 2002. Folding kayaks were used from 1949 to 1963; and in the early 1960s, boats were made of fiberglass and nylon. Boats were heavy, usually over 30 pounds (14 kilos). With the advent of kevlar and carbon fiber being used in the 1970s, the widths of the boats were reduced by the ICF, and the boats were reduced in volume to pass the gates, and boats have become much lighter and faster.

From 1949 to 1977, all World Championships were held in Europe. The first World Championship held in North America was held at Jonquière, in Québec, Canada, in 1979. It has been a regular Olympic sport since 1992.

Canoe double (C2) men lost its status as an Olympic event to be replaced by canoe single (C1) women, starting in 2021 at Tokyo. 

==Rules==
Each gate consists of two poles hanging from a wire strung across the river. There are 18-25 numbered gates in a course, of which 6 or 8 must be upstream gates, and they are colored as either green (downstream) or red (upstream), indicating the direction they must be negotiated. Upstream gates are typically placed in eddies, where the water is flat or moving slightly upstream; the paddler enters an eddy from the main current and paddles upstream through the gate. Downstream gates may also be placed in eddies, to increase the difficulty, and downstream gates in the current can be offset to alternating sides of the current, requiring rapid turns in fast-moving water.

Most slalom courses take 80 to 120 seconds to complete for the fastest paddlers. Depending on the level of competition, difficulty of the course, degree of water turbulence, and ability of the other paddlers, times can go up to 200 seconds.

In international competitions (World Championships, World Cups, World Ranking Races) all competitors complete a first run in the qualification round, called the &quot;heats&quot;; the fastest 20 to 30 boats make it through to the semi-final. The remaining competitors complete a second run, with a further 10 moving forward. The qualifying format is different for the Olympic Games, where each competitor completes two runs and the time of their faster run gives the qualification result. Depending on the number of participants in the event, 10 to 40 boats make it through to the semi-final; this consists of one run on a different course. The fastest semi-final boats, the number determined by the number of participants, make it through to the final, where they navigate the semi-final course once more. Their ranking within the final group is based on the time of that last run alone.

For the gate to be considered correctly negotiated, the whole head of the athlete (or all athletes) and at the same time a part of the boat must pass through the gate. If the competitor&#x27;s boat, paddle or body touches either pole of the gate, a time penalty of two seconds is added. If the competitor misses a gate, deliberately pushes the gate to pass through, goes through the gate in the wrong direction or upside-down, or goes through it in the wrong order, a 50-second penalty is given. Only one penalty can be incurred on each gate, and this will be taken as the highest one.
In the 1960s and early 1970s, boats were made of heavy fiberglass and nylon. The boats were high volume and weighed over 30 pounds (14 kilos). In the early 1970s Kevlar was used and the boats became lighter as well as the volume of the boats was being reduced almost every year as new designs were made. A minimum boat weight was introduced to equalize competition when super light materials began to affect race results. The ICF also reduced the width of the boats in the early 1970s. The gates were hung about 10 cm above the water. When racers began making lower-volume boats, the gates were raised in response to fears that new boats would be of such low volume as to create a hazard to the paddler. Their low-volume sterns allow the boat to slice through the water in a quick turn, or &quot;pivot&quot;.

Typically, new racing boats cost between $1,200 and $2,500 (or $850 onwards for the cheapest constructions in fiberglass). Usually boats are made with carbon fiber, Kevlar and fiberglass cloth, using epoxy or polyester resin to hold the layers together. Foam sandwich construction in between layers of carbon, Kevlar, or Aramid is another technique in use to increase the stiffness of slalom boats.

In 2005 the minimum length of these boats was reduced from 4 meters down to 3.5 meters, causing a flurry of new, faster boat designs which are able to navigate courses with more speed and precision. The shorter length also allows for easier navigation and less boat damage in the smaller manmade river beds that are prevalent in current elite competitions.

Boat design progression is rather limited year to year. Directly from the 2017 ICF Canoe Slalom Rules:

*7.1.1 Measurements
**All types of K1 Minimum length 3.50 m minimum width 0.60 m
**All types of C1 Minimum length 3.50 m minimum width 0.60 m
**All types of C2 Minimum length 4.10 m minimum width 0.75 m
*7.1.2 Minimum Weight of Boats
**(The minimum weight of the boat is determined when the boat is dry. The weight minimums were raised for 2017.)
**All types of K1 . (Previously 8 kg).
**All types of C1 . (Previously 8 kg).
**All types of C2 .
*7.1.3 All boats must have a minimum radius at each end of horizontally and vertically.
*7.1.4 Rudders are prohibited on all boats
*7.1.5 Boats must be designed to, and remain within, the required dimensions.
*7.1.6 Kayaks are decked boats, which must be propelled by double-bladed paddles and inside which the competitors sit. Canoes are decked boats that must be propelled by single-bladed paddles and inside which the competitors kneel.

There are rules governing almost every aspect of slalom equipment used in major competition, including sponsor advertisement. Some of these rules vary from country to country; each national canoe and kayak governing body publishes its own variation of the rules.

==Courses==

Slalom courses are usually on Class II - IV whitewater. Some courses are technical, containing many rocks. Others are on stretches containing fewer rocks and larger waves and holes.

==Kayak cross==
Kayak cross, previously known as extreme slalom, is a discipline in which four kayaks race each other on a single course, similarly to BMX racing, ski cross and snowboard cross. The competitors drop into the water from a starting ramp, must pass through gates, and must perform a kayak roll during the run. Contact with other boats is permitted, but competitors may be disqualified for dangerous paddling. Faults may be assessed for rule violations (such as not properly navigating a gate). Competitors with zero faults are ranked by order of finish and ahead of any competitors with one or more faults; if two or more competitors have faults, they are ranked by number of faults and then by the distance traveled without a fault.

==Olympics==
Slalom canoeing made its Olympic debut in 1972 in Augsburg, West Germany, for the Munich Games. It was not seen again until 1992 in La Seu d&#x27;Urgell as part of the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. Since then, slalom paddling has been a regular Olympic event in the following locations:
*1972: Augsburg, West Germany 
*1992: La Seu d&#x27;Urgell, Spain 
*1996: Ocoee River, United States 
*2000: Penrith, Australia
*2004: Athens, Greece
*2008: Shunyi, Beijing, China
*2012: Lee Valley, UK
*2016: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
*2020: Tokyo, Japan
*2024: Vaires-sur-Marne, Paris, France
*2028: OKC Riversport, Oklahoma City, United States
*2032: TBA, Brisbane, Australia 

The 1972 Olympics in Augsburg were held on an artificial whitewater course. The Augsburg Eiskanal set the stage for the future of artificial course creation. With the exception of the altered river bed of the Ocoee River in 1996, every Olympic venue has been a manmade concrete channel. Since the late 1980s, artificial course creation has surged; now most countries that field Olympic slalom teams have more than one artificial course to train on. Artificial river creation has evolved and new courses have fewer issues than some of the initial designs.

There are currently six Olympic Medal events:
*Men&#x27;s C-1 (canoe singles)
*Men&#x27;s K-1 (kayak singles)
*Men&#x27;s KX-1 (kayak cross), introduced in 2024
*Women&#x27;s C-1, introduced in 2021
*Women&#x27;s K-1
*Women&#x27;s KX-1, introduced in 2024

<doc id="717425" wikidata="Q3125017" url="?curid=717425" title="HMS Dreadnought (1801)">
<text>HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was a Royal Navy 98-gun second rate. This ship of the line was launched at Portsmouth at midday on Saturday, 13 June 1801, after she had spent 13 years on the stocks. She was the first man-of-war launched since the Act of Union 1800 created the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and at her head displayed a lion couchant on a scroll bearing the Royal arms as emblazoned on the Standard.

==Launch==

The launch was a spectacle; it was reported that at least 10,000 people witnessed Commissioner Sir Charles Saxton break a bottle of wine over her stem, and that after the launch Sir Charles gave a most sumptuous cold collation to the nobility and officers of distinction.

After the launch, &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was brought into dock for coppering, and a great number of people went on board to view her. The following day, due to the exertions of Mr Peake, the builder, and the artificers of the dockyard, she was completely coppered in six hours and on Monday morning she went out of dock for rigging and fitting.

==Active service==

Her first commander was Captain James Vashon. After cruising for some time in the Channel he proceeded off Cádiz and Menorca where he continued until the summer of 1802.

Her first master was Mr. Banks followed by Joseph Foss Dessiou (1769–1853), who was paid off on 15 July 1802.

In 1803, Captain Edward Brace briefly took command as flag captain to William Cornwallis, until he was relieved that same year by Captain John Child Purvis.

Purvis served under the orders of Admiral Cornwallis until he was promoted to rear-admiral in April 1804. The next commander until August was Robert Carthew Reynolds. He was superseded that month by George Reynolds, who, in turn, was replaced in December that year by Edward Rotheram, who stayed as flag captain to Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood until just before Trafalgar. The winter gale weather off the French coast badly damaged five of the major warships maintaining the blockade. &quot;Dreadnought&quot; lost most of her powder when water poured into the magazine.

In the spring of 1805, Admiral Cornwallis was replaced by an ailing Lord Gardner who allowed the close blockade to be slackened. On 30 March the French fleet escaped from Toulon and reached Cádiz on 9 April. The French and Spanish squadrons sailed separately from there and joined forces in Martinique on 26 May. On 15 May, Collingwood and his squadron of seven ships received orders from the Admiralty to sail for Barbados. Before they could depart; however, Horatio Nelson arrived from the Mediterranean Sea in pursuit of the French, and &quot;Dreadnought&quot; proceeded to Cádiz for Collingwood to command a close blockade there.

Early in October 1805, Captain John Conn assumed command of &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, after having brought &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; out from England for Vice-Admiral Collingwood. Collingwood and Rotheram then moved to the newly recoppered first rate on 10 October 1805, leaving Conn in command of the now sluggish &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, with her barnacled hull badly in need of careening, but nevertheless with a well exercised ship&#x27;s company, who for months having been under Collingwood&#x27;s watchful eye, now contained the most efficient gun crews in the fleet.

At the battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805, &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was the eighth ship in the lee division to enter the action. She started firing on &quot;San Juan Nepomuceno&quot; at two o&#x27;clock and fifteen minutes later ran her on board and forced her to surrender after her commander Commodore Cosme Damian de Churruca y Elorza had been killed in action. She then attempted to engage &quot;Principe de Asturias&quot; but the Spanish ship hauled off. During the battle &quot;Dreadnought&quot; lost seven killed and 26 wounded.

After Trafalgar, &quot;Dreadnought&quot; continued in the blockade of Cadiz. On 25 November, detained the Ragusan ship &quot;Nemesis&quot;, which was sailing from Isle de France to Leghorn, Italy, with a cargo of spice, indigo dye, and other goods. &quot;Dreadnought&quot; shared the prize money with ten other British warships.

&quot;Dreadnought&quot; continued to patrol the Channel and the Baltic for another seven years.

In 1807, under Captain William Lechmere, she was part of the Channel Fleet. From 1808 to 1809, she was under Captain G. B. Salt, serving as the flagship of Rear-Admiral Thomas Sotheby, off Ushant.

On 9 November &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, , &quot;Christian VII&quot;, &quot;Milford&quot;, &quot;Naiad&quot;, &quot;Unicorn&quot;, and the hired armed cutters &quot;Nimrod&quot; and &quot;Adrian&quot; were all in sight when the Ballahoo class schooner captured the French brig &quot;Modeste&quot;.

On 7 September 1810 &quot;Snapper&quot; spotted a ship among the rocks on the west side of Ushant. She notified &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, which attempted a cutting out expedition. The British succeeded in taking the Spanish merchant brig &quot;Maria-Antonia&quot;, which had been taken by a French privateer. However, the success was bought at a cost of six dead, 31 wounded and six missing, as well as two ship’s boats, as a result of an ambush by a large party of French troops with two field guns on a cliff overlooking the anchorage.

In spring 1811, &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, under Captain Samuel Hood Linzee, was in Lisbon. She then was in the Baltic at the end of the year. On 16 December 1811, a fleet of about 150 merchant ships sailed from Wingo, near Gothenburg, under the escort of a number of ships, including &quot;Dreadnought&quot;. A gale resulted in the loss of &quot;St George&quot; and &quot;Defence&quot; but &quot;Dreadnought&quot; and the other ships arrived safely.

==Fate==

&quot;Dreadnought&quot; was taken out of commission at Portsmouth in 1812.
In 1827, she became a lazaretto (quarantine ship) at Milford on Sea and became the second of the ships used by the Seamen&#x27;s Hospital Society, between 1831 and 1857, as a hospital ship for ex-members of the Merchant Navy or fishing fleet, and their dependents. &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was broken up in 1857.

==Post-script==

When the Admiralty had &quot;Dreadnought&quot; broken up, it transferred the infirmary to the , which was renamed &quot;Dreadnought&quot;. In 1870 the infirmary transferred onto land as the Seamen&#x27;s Dreadnought Hospital at the Royal Greenwich Hospital. Since 1986, this has become the &#x27;Dreadnought Unit&#x27; at St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital. In addition, the Seamen&#x27;s Dreadnought Hospital provided in 1919 the foundation for the UK&#x27;s dedicated Hospital for Tropical Diseases. The Dreadnought (Hospital) Building at Greenwich is now part of the University of Greenwich and was redeveloped and reopened in 2018. The building hosts the Faculty of Education, Health and Human Sciences (FEHHS) and the Greenwich Students Union along with student support services.

<doc id="717434" wikidata="Q1076566" url="?curid=717434" title="Ordinary (heraldry)">
<text>In heraldry, an ordinary is one of the two main types of charges, beside the &quot;mobile charges&quot;. An ordinary is a simple geometrical figure, bounded by straight lines and running from side to side or top to bottom of the shield. There are also some geometric charges known as subordinaries, which have been given lesser status by some heraldic writers, though most have been in use as long as the traditional ordinaries. Diminutives of ordinaries and some subordinaries are charges of the same shape, though thinner. Most of the ordinaries are theoretically said to occupy one-third of the shield; but this is rarely observed in practice, except when the ordinary is the only charge (as in the coat of arms of Austria).

The terms &quot;ordinary&quot; and &quot;subordinary&quot; are somewhat controversial, as they have been applied arbitrarily and inconsistently among authors, and the use of these terms has been disparaged by some leading heraldic authorities. In his &quot;Complete Guide to Heraldry&quot; (1909), Arthur Charles Fox-Davies asserted that the terms are likely inventions of &quot;heraldic writers&quot; and not of &quot;heralds&quot;, arguing the &quot;utter absurdity of the necessity for any [such] classification at all,&quot; and stating that the ordinaries and sub-ordinaries are, in his mind, &quot;no more than first charges.&quot;

== Types ==

=== Ordinaries ===

Ordinaries (sometimes called &quot;honourable ordinaries&quot;) resemble partitions &quot;of&quot; the field, but are formally considered objects &quot;on&quot; the field. Though there is some debate as to exactly which geometrical charges—with straight edges and running from edge to edge of the shield—constitute ordinaries, certain ones are agreed on by everyone. Except for the chief they are central to the shield. Ordinaries should not be mixed with Division of the field.

*&quot;Cross&quot;: a pale and a fess of equal widths conjoined (though the cross is typically thinner than this would suggest), as in the arms of the City of London.
*&quot;Pale&quot;: a vertical stripe right down the middle of the shield. Typically to the width of the field.
** A variant is the Canadian pale, invented in 1964 for the new Canadian national flag: it takes up half the width of the field.
* &quot;Fess&quot;: a horizontal stripe, as in the coat of arms of Austria. Typically to the height of the field.
** &quot;Bar&quot;: a narrower fess (said in theory to occupy one-fifth of the field), sometimes reckoned as an ordinary in its own right. It is rarely borne singly.
*&quot;Bend&quot;: an oblique band from the dexter chief (the bearer&#x27;s upper right, viewer&#x27;s upper left) to the opposite corner, as in the arms of the former grand duchy of Baden.
*&quot;Bend sinister&quot;: a bend in the opposite direction (sinister chief to dexter base).
*&quot;Chevron&quot;: two diagonal bands meeting in the centre in the form of an inverted V, or like the beams of a gable; as in the arms of Udine, Italy, or Trans, Switzerland.
*&quot;Saltire&quot;: a bend and a bend sinister both of equal widths conjoined to form a diagonal cross (×), as in the Scots national banner (often referred to simply as &quot;the Saltire&quot;), and also known colloquially as a St Andrew&#x27;s cross.
*&quot;Chief&quot;: a horizontal band right across the top of the shield, as in the arms of the district of Lausanne (Vaud, Switzerland).
** &quot;Chief triangular&quot; begins in the corners and extends to a point that is one quarter to one third the way down the shield. It is a complex line division variant of a chief.
** &quot;Chief enarched&quot; is drawn with a concave arch
** &quot;Chief double-arched&quot; has two concavities
*&quot;Terrace in base&quot; (French: &quot;champagne&quot;, &quot;terrace&quot;; Italian &quot;campagna&quot;; German &quot; Schildfuß&quot;)
**&quot;Mount&quot; when represented in green and curved or arched, as a hill.
**&quot;Mount mounted&quot;, or &quot;Shapournet shapourned&quot;: a trimount.

=== Ordinaries or subordinaries ===
The following are sometimes classed as ordinaries, sometimes as &quot;subordinaries&quot; (see below):
*&quot;Bordure&quot;: the boundary of the shield; often used for cadency
*&quot;Pile&quot;: downward pointing triangle, issuing from the top of the shield
*&quot;Pall or Pairle&quot;: a Y-shape
**A variant is the &quot;shakefork&quot;: a pall cut short of the margins, with pointed ends. It is frequent in Scotland, owing to its prominence in the armoury of Clan Cunningham.

=== Subordinaries ===
Some geometric figures are not considered to be &quot;honourable ordinaries&quot; and are called &quot;subordinaries&quot;. Very loosely, they are geometric or conventional charges that, unlike ordinaries, do not stretch from edge to edge of the shield. There is no definitive list or definition, but they generally include:

==== Fixed subordinaries ====
Fixed subordinaries are those that have a particular place to go on a shield—or at least a very limited range of places.
* &quot;Quarter&quot;: the dexter chief quadrant of the shield
** &quot;Canton&quot;: smaller than the quarter, formally said to occupy one-ninth of the shield, though sometimes drawn smaller, but generally accepted as a square 1/3 the width of the shield. The canton is often said to be the quarter&#x27;s diminutive, but perhaps it should be treated as a subordinary in its own right as it fulfils heraldic functions not fulfilled by the quarter, and behaves according to its own special rules—as for example in the case of the canton on which baronets in the UK may display the badges of their &#x27;rank&#x27;, which is very rarely shown occupying such a large area as the upper left third of the field, and is usually much less and very often shown not as square but as a rectangle with its longer side vertical. Very occasionally a &#x27;sinister canton&#x27; is found, on the shield&#x27;s other side.
* &quot;Flaunches&quot;, always borne in pairs: a circular arc emerging out of each flank of the shield.
* &quot;Fret&quot;: interlacing bendlet, bendlet sinister and mascle.
* &quot;Gore&quot;: two arcs meeting in the fess point to form a triangular segment.
* &quot;Gyron&quot;: the lower half of a &quot;quarter&quot; cut diagonally, said to be an old charge but rare although there are modern examples (e. g. de Cluseau)
* &quot;Orle&quot;: A bordure separated from the outside of the shield. Like the bordure the orle takes on the shape of the shield or flag it is on. Although the orle&#x27;s diminutive is the tressure, there are examples of &quot;fillet orles&quot; (orles narrower than usual). When a number of charges are arranged as if on a bordure, they are said to be &quot;in orle&quot; or to form &quot;an orle of&quot; such charges. It is often said that an orle may not have other charges charged on it, but the Scots Public Register has the coat of Norie of Noristone: &#x27;Parted per pale argent and sable ane orle engrailed on both sydes charged with four quaterfoiules within a bordur all counterchanged&#x27;.
** &quot;Tressure&quot;: a thinner version and hence diminutive of the orle. The most famous tressure is probably the &quot;double tressure flory counter flory&quot; in the royal coat of arms of Scotland. Tressures with other ornamentation exist, such as with maple leaves, crescents, thistles and roses.


==== Mobile subordinaries ====

Other subordinaries can be placed anywhere on the field.

* &quot;Escutcheon&quot;: a shield used as a charge.

:*&quot;escutcheon of pretence&quot; or &quot;en surtout&quot;—When one escutcheon is borne in the centre of the coat, it is sometimes called an &quot;inescutcheon&quot; or an &quot;escutcheon of pretence&quot; or an &quot;escutcheon en surtout&quot;. Such centrally placed escutcheons usually have some particular significance. For example, in arms of dominion an inescutcheon typically shows the dynastic arms of the prince, whose possessions are shown in the quarters of the main shield; current examples include the arms of the Danish royal family, with an inescutcheon of the house of Oldenburg, and the coat of arms of Spain, with an inescutcheon of the house of Bourbon-Anjou. In Scots heraldry the escutcheon &quot;en surtout&quot; serves several different purposes. This all comes under the heading of marshalling.
* &quot;Lozenge&quot;: a rhombus with its long axis upright, resembling the diamond of playing-cards.
:* &quot;Fusil&quot;: a thin lozenge; very much taller than it is wide.
:* &quot;Mascle&quot;: a voided lozenge (i.e. with a largish lozenge shaped hole)
:* &quot;Rustre&quot; (very rare): a lozenge pierced (i.e. with a smallish round hole)

* &quot;Roundel&quot;: a disc or ball, as in the arms of the Duchy of Cornwall or of the Medici. In the Anglophone heraldries differently coloured roundels have different names, e.g. a roundel or is called a bezant and a roundel azure is called a hurt. French heraldry solely distinguishes besants (roundels of a metal tincture) and tourteaux (roundels of a colour tincture): hence, the Canadian Francophone versions of blazons follow suit — Anglophone hurt is Francophone &quot;tourteau d&#x27;azur&quot;, and Anglophone bezant is a &quot;besant d&#x27;or&quot;
:* &quot;Annulet&quot;: a voided roundel (i.e. with a largish round hole, resembling a ring)

* &quot;Billet&quot;: a small rectangle, resembling a brick or a letter. Billets are normally vertical (as in the arms of the Kingdom of the Netherlands), but can be horizontal (as in the arms of Friesland).
== Variations ==

=== Lines ===

Ordinaries need not be bounded by straight lines.
=== Diminutives ===
When a coat of arms contains two or more of an ordinary, they are nearly always blazoned (in English) as &quot;diminutives&quot; of the ordinary, as follows.

==== Diminutives of the pale ====
* pallet: theoretically half the width of a pale.
* endorse: half the width of a pallet; also found in pairs on either side of a pale when the term &quot;endorsed&quot; is used
==== Diminutives of the fess ====
* bar, see above.
* closet, half the width of the bar
* barrulet, narrower than both.
* hamade (also called &quot;hamaide&quot; or &quot;hummet&quot;): a bar couped which doesn&#x27;t reach the edges of the shield, usually in threes
==== Diminutives of the bend ====
* bendlet, half the width of a bend.
* ribbon or riband, half the width of a bendlet, occasionally called a cost
* baton: a bendlet couped which doesn&#x27;t reach the edges of the shield, often said to be only a bendlet sinister couped, but has certainly been used as a couped bendlet &#x27;dexter&#x27; since the 17th century at the latest
==== Diminutive of the bend sinister ====
* bendlet sinister, half the width of a bend sinister, also very occasionally called a &quot;scarpe&quot;;
*baton sinister, a bendlet sinister couped
==== Diminutives of the chevron ====
* chevronel: half the width of a chevron.
*couple close: half the width of a chevronnel, but only to be found in pairs with a chevron between them; the phrase &#x27;a chevron between two couple closes&#x27; has the alternative &#x27;a chevron couple closed&#x27;; in essence the same as cottising a chevron; couple close is not found much in modern blazons

==== Diminutives of the chief ====
* comble, &quot;half&quot; a chief; rare in the Anglophone heraldries, but does appear in the civic heraldry of France—there even being at least one chief charged with a comble
* chief enhanced, again &quot;half&quot; a chief, sometimes said not to be a diminutive, but is indistinguishable from the comble which is.
* fillet: said, by those who do not believe in the comble or chief enhanced, to be the nearest that the chief comes to having a diminutive, which is effectively a barrulet conjoined to a chief at its bottom edge—blazoned either as &#x27;a chief supported by a fillet&#x27; or as &#x27;a chief filleted&#x27; (or things similar); occasionally appears in its own right—though it is then very little other than a barrulet enhanced.

==== Diminutive of the cross ====
* cross fillet (or fillet cross), somewhat less than half the width of a cross.

==== Diminutive of the saltire ====
* fillet saltire, something less than half the width of a saltire
* saltorel, is sometimes said to be a diminutive saltire, but is best thought of simply as a saltire couped, the word being sometimes used when there are three or more (rather like lioncel and eaglet were used at times when there were three or more lions or eagles in a coat)—a 19th-century armorial uses &#x27;saltorels&#x27; only once for every ten or eleven &#x27;saltires&#x27;. A common charge in Dutch heraldry.

=== Cottise and cottising ===

The &quot;cottise&quot; (the spelling varies—sometimes only one &quot;t&quot; and sometimes &quot;c&quot; instead of the &quot;s&quot;) originated as an alternative name to &quot;cost&quot; (see above) and so as a diminutive of the bend, most commonly found in pairs on either side of a bend, with the bend being blazoned either as &quot;between two cottises&quot; or as &quot;cottised&quot;.

Nowadays cottising is used not just for bends but for practically all the ordinaries (and occasionally collections of charges), and consists in placing the ordinary between two diminutive versions of itself (and occasionally other things). A pale so treated is usually blazoned &quot;endorsed&quot; and a chevron very occasionally &quot;couple closed&quot; or between two couple closes. A chief, however, cannot be cottised.

The ordinary and its cottices need not have the same tincture or the same line ornamentation.

Ordinaries very occasionally get cottised by things shaped quite differently from their diminutives—like demi maple leaves.

Occasionally a collection of charges aligned as if on an ordinary—&quot;in bend&quot;, etc.—is accompanied by cotticing.
=== Voiding, surmounting with another, and fimbriation ===
Any type of charge, but probably most often the ordinaries and subordinaries, can be &quot;voided&quot;; without further description, this means that a hole in the shape of the charge reveals the field behind it. Occasionally the hole is of different tincture or shape (which must then be specified), so that the charge appears to be surcharged with a smaller charge.

<doc id="717439" wikidata="Q598949" url="?curid=717439" title="Sub-replacement fertility">
<text>Sub-replacement fertility is a total fertility rate (TFR) that (if sustained) leads to each new generation being less populous than the older, previous one in a given area. The United Nations Population Division defines sub-replacement fertility as any rate below approximately 2.1 children born per woman of childbearing age, but the threshold can be as high as 3.4 in some developing countries because of higher mortality rates. Taken globally, the total fertility rate at replacement was 2.33 children per woman in 2003. This can be &quot;translated&quot; as 2 children per woman to replace the parents, plus a &quot;third of a child&quot; to make up for the higher probability of males born and mortality prior to the end of a person&#x27;s fertile life. In 2020, the global average fertility rate was around 2.4 children born per woman.

Replacement-level fertility in terms of the net reproduction rate (NRR) is exactly one, because the NRR takes both mortality rates and sex ratios at birth into account.

As of 2010, about 48% (3.3 billion people) of the world population lives in nations with sub-replacement fertility. Nonetheless most of these countries still have growing populations due to immigration, population momentum and increase of the life expectancy. This includes most nations of Europe, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Russia, Iran, Tunisia, China, India, the United States and many others. In 2016, all European Union countries had a sub-replacement fertility rate, ranging from a low of 1.3 in Portugal, Poland, Greece, Spain and Cyprus to a high of 2.0 in France. The countries or areas that have the lowest fertility are in developed parts of East and Southeast Asia: Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea. Only a few countries have had, for the time being, sufficiently sustained sub-replacement fertility (sometimes combined with other population factors like higher emigration than immigration) to have population decline, such as Japan, Germany, Lithuania, and Ukraine. As of 2020, the total fertility rate varied from 0.84 in South Korea to 7.0 in Niger.

==Causes==
===Higher education===

The fact that more people are going to colleges and universities, and are working to obtain more post-graduate degrees there, along with the soaring costs of education, have contributed greatly to postponing marriage in many cases, and bearing children at all, or fewer numbers of children, and the fact that the number of women getting higher education has increased has contributed to fewer of them getting married younger, if at all. In the US, for example, females make up more than half of all college students, which is a reversal from a few decades back.

The relationship between higher education and childbearing varies by country: for example, in Switzerland by age 40, childlessness among women who had completed tertiary education is 40%, while in France it is only 15%. In some countries, childlessness has a longer tradition, and was common even before educational levels increased, but in others, such as Southern European ones, it is a recent phenomenon; for instance in Spain the childlessness rate for women aged 40–44 in 2011 was 21.60%, but historically throughout the 20th century it was around 10%. Not all countries show a relationship between low fertility and education: in Czech Republic, of women born in 1961–1965, low educated women were more likely to be childless than high educated women. In the United States in 2022, women between the ages of 15 and 50 with a graduate or professional degree had the highest birthrate (62 births per 1,000 women), whereas women between the ages of 15 and 50 with less than a high school graduate had the lowest birthrate (32 births per 1,000 women) among all levels of educational attainment of the mother.

==== A general trade-off ====

People are more likely in modern society to invest strongly in the needs of their children, such as offering them the best education, shelter (a room only for the child), travel, cultural activities etc. In the past, when child mortality was high, people had more children, but invested less in them. Today, parents usually experience much less doubt about whether the child will live to adulthood, and so are more likely to strongly invest in that child. But strongly investing in each child makes it irrational to have a large numbers of children—this is a &quot;quantity vs. quality trade-off&quot;—with education as the most important such qualitative investment.

===Economic fluctuation===

The growth of wealth and human development are related to sub-replacement fertility, although a sudden drop in living conditions, such as the Great Depression, can also lower fertility.

In Eastern European countries, the fall of communism was followed by an economic collapse in many of these countries in the 1990s. Some countries, such as those that experienced violent conflicts in the 1990s, were badly affected. Large numbers of people lost their jobs, and massive unemployment, lack of jobs outside the big cities, and economic uncertainty discourages people from having children. For instance, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the total fertility rate in 2016 was only 1.28 children born/woman.

Financial challenges such as increased housing prices, concern about job security, cost of raising children (child care, education cost) have also impact on TFR.

===Urbanization===
Some consider the increase of urbanization around the world a central cause. In recent times, residents of urban areas tend to have fewer children than people in rural areas. The need for extra labour from children on farms does not apply to urban-dwellers. Cities tend to have higher property prices, making a large family more expensive, especially in those societies where each child is now expected to have their own bedroom, rather than sharing with siblings as was the case until recently. Rural areas also tend to be more conservative, with less contraception and abortion than urban areas.

===Reduction in child labour===

Countries which have a high fertility rate are usually less developed countries, where families rely on children to help them, with labour such as agricultural work, tending to livestock, or even paid work. In such countries child labour is quite common, with children bringing money home, or directly supporting the family through physical work. By contrast, in high-income nations, child labour is almost universally banned, and it is the parents who are expected to invest extensively into their children.

===Views on the &quot;ideal&quot; family===
Although fertility rates are often discussed in terms of state policies (e.g. financial benefits, combining work with family etc.), the deeply entrenched social views on what constitutes an &quot;ideal&quot; family may play a crucial role: if parents do not envision large families in a positive way, it is difficult to &quot;convince&quot; them to have many children. In this regard, there are major differences between European countries: while 50.23% of women aged 15–39 state that the &quot;ideal&quot; family has 3 or more children in Estonia, and 46.43% say this in Finland; only 11.3% say this in Czech Republic, and 11.39% in Bulgaria.

===Contraception===
Changes in contraception are also an important cause, and one that has seen dramatic changes in the last few generations. Legalization and widespread acceptance of contraception in the developed world is a large factor in decreased fertility levels; however, for instance in a European context where its prevalence has always been very high in the modern era, the fertility rates do not seem to be influenced significantly by availability of contraception.

While contraception can reduce the number of unwanted births and contribute to a smaller ideal family size, contraception does not start fertility reductions nor substantially affect their size, with these being attributable to other factors.

===Assisted reproductive technology===

The availability of assisted reproductive technology (ART) may foster delay of childbearing, because many couples think that it can solve any future fertility problems. Its effect on total fertility rate is extremely small but government support for it is beneficial for families.

===Human Development Index===

The Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite statistic of life expectancy, education, and per capita income indicators, which are used to rank countries into four tiers of human development. A country scores higher HDI when the lifespan is higher, the education level is higher, and the GDP per capita is higher. There is a strong inverse correlation between the HDI and the fertility rate of the population: the higher the HDI, the lower the fertility rate. As of 2016, the countries with the highest fertility rate are Burundi, Mali, Somalia, Uganda, Burkina Faso, Zambia, Malawi, Angola, and Afghanistan; while most high-income countries have sub-replacement fertility rates. This is part of the fertility-income paradox, as these high fertility countries are very poor, and it may seem counter-intuitive for families there to have so many children. The inverse relationship between income and fertility has been termed a &quot;demographic-economic &quot;paradox&quot;&quot; by the notion that greater means would enable the production of more offspring as suggested by the influential Thomas Malthus.

===Government policies===
Some governments have launched programmes to reduce fertility rates and curb population growth. The People&#x27;s Republic of China implemented a one-child policy for 35 years (from 1979 to 2015); this was relaxed to a two-child policy in 2016 and relaxed further to a three child policy in 2021.
Although today Singapore has a low fertility rate, and the government encourages parents to have more children because birth rates have fallen below the replacement rate, in the 1970s the situation was the opposite: the government wished to slow and reverse the boom in births that started after World War II.

===Ability to choose===
The total fertility rate is also influenced by the ability to choose what type of family to have, if and when to have children, and the number of children to have - free from coercion, pressure, or interference from the community, extended family, state or church. This includes prohibition on practices such as child marriage, forced marriage or bride price. In some cultures for instance, the payment of the bride price creates an obligation on the wife to have children, and failure to do so often results in threats and violence. High-income countries have substantially lower fertility rates, and increased childlessness, because people who remain childless or who have small families are less likely to be stigmatized. In many cultures childless women suffer discrimination, stigma, ostracism, and social isolation.

===Tempo effect===
Total fertility rate (TFR) is affected by a phenomenon called the tempo effect, which describes &quot;distortions due to changes in the timing of births.&quot; John Bongaarts and Griffith Feeney have suggested that this tempo effect is driving the decline of measured fertility rate in the developed world. Specifically, the trend in developed countries of having children at later ages can cause the TFR to be underestimated. For example, as measured by the Human Fertility Database, the United States tempo-adjusted TFR was over a 2.1 replacement level between 1992 and 2015.

===Type of partnership===
A study of the United States and multiple countries in Europe came to the result that women who continue to cohabit rather than get married after birth have significantly lower probability of having a second child than married women in all countries except those in Eastern Europe. Another study, on the contrary, came to the result that cohabiting couples in France have equal fertility as married ones.

A large survey in the United States came to the result that married women had an average of 1.9 children, compared to 1.3 among those cohabiting. The corresponding numbers for men were 1.7 and 1.1, respectively. The difference of 0.6 children for both sexes was expected to decrease to between 0.2 and 0.3 over the lifetime when correcting for the confounder that married people have their children earlier in life.
In the United States, those who cohabit without marrying had increased fertility when the male earns considerably more than the female.

===Gender expectations and norms===
Social norms both within the family and in society at large determine fertility levels.
The quality of couple relations in terms of support given to the woman matters, with studies on fertility in the high-income world showing a U-shaped relationship between gender equity within the couple and fertility: in countries with very low fertility rates, the probability of a woman to have the second child occurs at the extremes - either very low gender equality or very high gender equality. This is also reflected at a social level: countries that are neither sufficiently patriarchal to coerce women into having large families, nor sufficiently egalitarian to incentivize women to have more children through strong support (such as subsidized childcare and good support of working mothers), have very low fertility rates, especially among educated women. Where women are expected to &#x27;choose&#x27; between their professional and public life, or having children, the more educated the woman is, the more likely she is to choose the former. The strong emphasis on the domestic role of women in Germany (unlike Scandinavia and France) was described as the cause of the very low fertility in that country.

==Historical effects==
The Greek historian Polybius largely blamed the decline of the Hellenistic world on low fertility rates, writing in his work &quot;The Histories&quot; that:
In a speech to Roman nobles, the Emperor Augustus commented on the low birthrates of the Roman elite:

Upon the establishment of the Roman Empire, Emperor Augustus would introduce legislation to increase the birthrates of the Roman nobility.

Some believe that not only the Great Recession, but the Great Depression, may have been the result of a decline in birthrates overall. Clarence L. Barber, an economist at the University of Manitoba, pointed out how demand for housing in the US, for example, began to decline in 1926, due to a decline in &#x27;household formation&#x27; (marriage), due, he believed, to the effects of World War I upon society. In early 1929, US housing demand declined precipitously and the stock market crash followed in October of that same year.

==Attempts to increase the fertility rate==

There have been several historical attempts to increase the fertility rate via natalist policies that attempt to encourage women to have more children. Upon the establishment of the Roman Empire, Caesar Augustus introduced legislation designed to increase the birthrate. Men aged 20 to 60 and women aged 20 to 50 were legally obliged to marry, and widowed or divorced individuals within the relevant age range were required to remarry. Exemptions were granted to those who had already had three children in the case of free-born people and four in the case of freed slaves. For political or bureaucratic office, preference was given to those with at least three legitimate children. Diminished inheritance rights awaited those who failed to reproduce.

In modern times, one of the most forceful attempts to increase the TFR occurred in Communist Romania between 1967 and 1990. Communist leader Nicolae Ceaușescu adopted a very aggressive natalist policy that included outlawing abortion and contraception, routine pregnancy tests for women, taxes on childlessness, and legal discrimination against childless people. This period was depicted in movies and documentaries (such as &quot;4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days&quot;, &quot;Children of the Decree&quot;). These policies increased birth rates during the period of policy implementation, but was followed by a decline due to increased illegal abortion. Ceaușescu&#x27;s policy resulted in over 9,000 women who died due to illegal abortions, large numbers of children put into orphanages by parents who could not cope with raising them, street children in the 1990s (when many orphanages were closed and the children ended up on the streets), and overcrowding in homes and schools. In addition, Ceaușescu&#x27;s demographic policies are feared of having very serious effects in the future, because the generations born under Ceaușescu are large (especially the late 1960s and the 1970s), while those born in the 1990s and 2000s are very small. This is believed to cause a very serious demographic shock when the former generations retire, as there will be insufficient young people in the workforce to support the elderly. Apart from Romania, a relatively similar policy of restricted reproductive rights during that period also existed in Communist Albania, under Enver Hoxha (see Abortion in Albania).

At present, many governments provide financial incentives to have more children. These include tax allowances for working parents, improving child-care provision, reducing working hours/weekend working in female-dominated professions such as healthcare and a stricter enforcement of anti-discrimination measures to prevent professional women&#x27;s promotion prospects being hindered when they take time off work to care for children. In 2002, Australia introduced a Baby Bonus that did increase birth rates in the years immediately after. The fertility rate also increased to around 2.0 in France and 1.9 in Britain and some other northern European countries, but the role of population policies in these trends is debated. In Italy, for example, natalist policies may have actually discouraged the Italian population from having more children. This &quot;widespread resistance&quot; was the result of the Italian government, at one point, taxing single persons and criminalizing abortion and even contraception.

European analysts hope, with the help of government incentives and large-scale change towards family-friendly policies, to stall the population decline and reverse it by around 2030, expecting that most of Europe will have a slight natural increase by then. C. D. Howe Institute, for example, tries to demonstrate that immigration cannot be used to effectively counter population ageing.

==Current effects==
Population aging may pose an economic challenge to governments as the number of retired citizens drawing public pensions rises in relation to the number of workers. This has been raised as a political issue in France, Germany, and the United States where many people have advocated policy changes to encourage higher birth and immigration rates.

Analysing data for 40 countries, Lee et al. show that typically fertility well above replacement and population growth would be most beneficial for government budgets. Fertility near replacement and population stability, however, would be most beneficial for standards of living when the analysis includes the effects of age structure on families as well as governments. Fertility moderately below replacement and population decline would maximize standards of living when the cost of providing capital for a growing labour force is taken into account.

==Forecasts==

Sub-replacement fertility does not automatically translate into a population decline because of increasing life expectancy and population momentum: recently high fertility rates produce a disproportionately young population, and younger populations have higher birth rates. This is why some nations with sub-replacement fertility still have a growing population, because a relatively large fraction of their population are still of child-bearing age. But if the fertility trend is sustained (and not compensated by immigration), it results in population ageing and/or population decline. This is already happening and impacts most of the countries of Europe and East Asia.

Current estimates expect the world&#x27;s total fertility rate to fall below replacement levels by 2050. There are several projections of population growth after 2050. The UN Population Division projects the world population, which is 7.8 billion as of 2020, to level out around 2100 at 10.9 billion A 2020 study published by The Lancet from researchers funded by the Global Burden of Disease Study promotes a lower growth scenario, projecting that world population will peak in 2064 at 9.7 billion and then decline to 8.8 billion in 2100. An analysis from the Wittgenstein Center IIASA predicts global population to peak in 2070 at 9.4 billion and then decline to 9.0 billion in 2100.

==Cases of fertility rate increases in individual countries==

===United States===
For twenty years, the total fertility rate in the United States remained relatively stable compared to much of the world. However, US TFR declined from 2.12 in 2007 to 1.64 in 2020.

===Other developed countries===
Some other developed countries experienced temporary increases in their birth rate in the first decade of the 21st century before seeing TFR steadily decline to all-time lows in the subsequent decade, including France, which recorded a TFR of over 2.00 in 2008, though it has since declined to 1.8 as 2020; the United Kingdom where TFR increased from 1.64 in 2000 to 1.98 in 2010, and then declined to 1.6 in 2020; Australia, where the birth rate rose from 1.73 in 2001 to 1.93 in 2007 before declining to 1.6 in 2020, and New Zealand, where the TFR was 2.2 in 2008 and then declined to 1.6 in 2020.

Israel is the only developed country that has never had sub-replacement fertility; a declining Arab and Bedouin fertility rate is countered by religious Jewish groups (mostly Haredim) with higher than average fertility rates. In addition, the (mostly non-religious) aliyah Jews from the former USSR shifted from a 1 child per woman fertility rate to an average fertility rate close to 2.2 children per woman. As of 2008, Israel&#x27;s Jewish fertility rate is the highest among the industrial nations.

<text>The Cadre Noir (; ) is a corps of écuyers, or instructors, at the French military riding academy École Nationale d&#x27;Équitation at Saumur in western France, founded in Versailles before transferring to Saumur in 1828. During the Second World War, the premises of the school were occupied by German forces and the remaining instructors and horses were moved temporarily to Fontainebleau. The school today also performs as an equestrian display team. Its name comes from the black uniforms that are still in use today. It is one of the &quot;Big Four&quot;, the most prestigious classical riding academies in the world.

== History ==
The historic role of the Saumur Cavalry School was to provide training for the officers and non-commissioned officers of the French cavalry. The style of equitation characteristic of the school was first taught by François Robichon de La Guérinière, the French riding master to King Louis XV and author of the manual &quot;École de Cavalerie&quot; published in 1731. La Guérinière perfected the previous 17th century methods of Antoine de Pluvinel and Louis de Nestier. In 1843, François Baucher introduced his method into the school. This event marked the beginning of a small &quot;war&quot; between the vicomte d&#x27;Aure (head of the school) and Baucher, which continued for several years.

After World War II the mounted element of the French Army had been reduced to a few squadrons of North African spahis (disbanded in 1962) and the primarily ceremonial Cavalry of the Republican Guard. While the need for a purely military riding academy had almost vanished, the international prestige of French horsemanship ensured the survival of the Saumur training centre in the form of a national riding school under the Ministry of Sports.

Accordingly, in 1972, the National School of &quot;Équitation&quot; was constituted around the Cadre Noir, which provided its core teaching staff. Today, there are about 50 horses and a team of elite riders, usually limited to 22. The members of the Cadre Noir have either civilian or military status. Military and civilian riders are distinguished by the insignia on their collar: a grenade for the military or a sun for the civilians. The military members can be either officers or non-commissioned officers. Some of the riders have reached the highest level of international sport, being Olympic gold-medallists or world champions.

The Cadre Noir mainly uses Thoroughbreds, Anglo-Arabians, Hanoverians and Selle Français, but also keeps Lusitano horses to demonstrate the 16th and 17th century baroque style of riding. The Thoroughbreds and Anglo Arabians are used for the Grand Prix dressage, and perform individually, &quot;pas de deux&quot; (two horses), &quot;pas de trois&quot; (three horses), and &quot;dûe quantité&quot; (four or more horses). They may be either displayed in hand or ridden.

The Selle Français are used to display the &#x27;airs above the ground.&#x27;

<text>HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was an ironclad turret ship built for the Royal Navy during the 1870s. Construction was halted less than a year after it began and she was redesigned to improve her stability and buoyancy. Upon completion in 1879, the ship was placed in reserve until she was commissioned in 1884 for service with the Mediterranean Fleet. Upon her return 10 years later, she became a coast guard ship in Ireland for two years. The ship then became a depot ship in 1897 before she was reclassified as a second-class battleship in 1900. &quot;Dreadnought&quot; participated in the annual fleet manoeuvres for the next two years before she became a training ship in 1902. The ship was taken out of service three years later and sold for scrap in 1908.

==Background and design==
&quot;Dreadnought&quot; was originally named &quot;Fury&quot; and was designed by the Director of Naval Construction (DNC), Sir Edward Reed, as an improved and enlarged version of the preceding turret ships. The ship was laid down, fully framed and partially plated up to the bottom of the waterline belt armour when work was ordered stopped in 1871 in light of the loss of the ironclad turret ship in a heavy storm the previous year. A Committee on Designs was formed in January 1871 to evaluate existing ship designs with special consideration as to their stability and buoyancy and found that the designs of &quot;Devastation&quot; and &quot;Fury&quot; were lacking in both qualities and needed to be modified. Reed had resigned before &quot;Captain&quot; was lost and he vehemently opposed the changes made by the new DNC, Nathaniel Barnaby and his assistant, William White, himself a future DNC.

The main changes were to increase the beam by and widen Reed&#x27;s armoured breastwork to cover the full width of the hull. This increased the ship&#x27;s freeboard amidships which improved buoyancy and stability and provided additional, badly needed accommodation for the crew. In addition, the maximum thickness of the armour was increased from , it was extended all the way to the bow and reinforced the ram. Barnaby and White&#x27;s initial plan was to extend the breastwork fore and aft, almost to the ends of the ship, but this was changed to run all the way to the ends after the results of &#x27;s sea trials in 1873–74 revealed that her low bow caused major problems in head seas. Other changes was the substitution of more economical inverted vertical compound-expansion steam engines for Reed&#x27;s original horizontal, low-pressure engines, more powerful guns for the ones first chosen, and the fitting of hydraulic pumps to work the gun turrets.

==Description==

&quot;Dreadnought&quot; had a length between perpendiculars of and was long overall, some longer than the &quot;Devastation&quot; class. She had a beam of , and a draught of . The ship displaced . &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was the first ship to have a longitudinal watertight bulkhead that divided the engine and boiler rooms down the centreline. Her crew consisted of 369 officers and ratings. She proved to be a very steady ship with minimal rolling, although she was very wet as high seas usually swept her deck from end to end.

The ship was the first large ironclad to have two 3-cylinder inverted vertical compound-expansion steam engines. These were built by Humphry &amp; Tennant and each drove a single four-bladed, propeller. &quot;Dreadnought&quot;″s engines were powered by a dozen cylindrical boilers with a working pressure of . The engines were designed to produce a total of for a speed of , this was more and faster than the &quot;Devastation&quot; class. &quot;Dreadnought&quot; reached a maximum speed of from during her sea trials. The ship carried a maximum of of coal, enough to steam at .

&quot;Dreadnought&quot; was originally intended to be equipped with a pair of RML 12-inch rifled muzzle-loading guns in each turret, but these were replaced by RML 12.5-inch guns while the ship was being redesigned. The shell of the 12.5-inch gun weighed while the gun itself weighed . The shell had a muzzle velocity of and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal of wrought iron armour at the muzzle. The gun turrets were rotated by steam power and loaded by hydraulic power.

The ship had a complete wrought iron, waterline armour belt that was thick amidships and tapered to outside the armoured citadel towards the ends of the ship. The armour plates were tapered to a thickness of 8 inches at their bottom edge and they extended above the waterline and below it. The armoured citadel protected the bases of the gun turrets, the funnel uptakes and the crew&#x27;s quarters. The sides of the citadel were thick and it had thick curved ends. The turrets were protected by two plates, each backed by wood. The aft 13-inch bulkhead of the original design was retained, but the forward one was made redundant by the forward extension of the belt. The conning tower ranged in thickness from and the upper deck was thick inside the citadel and outside.

==Construction and career==

&quot;Dreadnought&quot;, the fifth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy, was laid down on 10 September 1870 at No. 2 Slip, Pembroke Dockyard, Wales with the name of &quot;Fury&quot;. Construction was subsequently halted for a time in 1871 to redesign the ship and she was renamed &quot;Dreadnought&quot; on 1 February 1875. The renamed ship was launched on 8 March by Agnes Wood, daughter of William Courtenay, 11th Earl of Devon. She was completed on 15 February 1879 at a cost of £619,739.

The ship was then immediately placed in reserve until 1884 when she was commissioned for service with the Mediterranean Fleet. &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was fitted with ten 1-inch (25 mm) Nordenfelt guns on the hurricane deck when she was commissioned. The ship sailed for the Mediterranean Sea on 14 October and remained there for the next decade. The future King George V served aboard in 1886–88. She returned to British waters in September 1894 and began a refit at Chatham Dockyard that included the replacement of her Nordenfelt guns with six quick-firing (QF) 6-pounder and ten QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns. &quot;Dreadnought&quot; became a coast guard ship at Bantry Bay, Ireland in March 1895.

Two years later, in March 1897, she was relieved of that duty and became a depot ship in July at Devonport. The ship was reboilered and had more QF guns installed in 1898. &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was reclassified as a second-class battleship in 1900 and took part in British fleet manoeuvres in that year and the following one. In June 1902, she was refitted at Chatham to serve as a tender to HMS &quot;Defiance&quot;, torpedo school ship at Devonport, and later as a depot ship. She took part in the fleet review held at Spithead on 16 August 1902 for the coronation of King Edward VII, and was commissioned as tender four days later, on 20 August 1902. Lieutenant Harry Louis d′Estoteville Skipwith was appointed in command in October 1902. She was taken out of service and transferred to the Kyles of Bute in 1905. The ship was sold to Thos. W. Ward for scrap for £23,000 on 14 July 1908 and was broken up by February 1909.

<text>HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was a Royal Navy battleship, the design of which revolutionised naval power. The ship&#x27;s entry into service in 1906 represented such an advance in naval technology that her name came to be associated with an entire generation of battleships, the dreadnoughts, as well as the class of ships named after her. Likewise, the generation of ships she made obsolete became known as pre-dreadnoughts. Admiral Sir John &quot;Jacky&quot; Fisher, First Sea Lord of the Board of Admiralty, is credited as the father of &quot;Dreadnought&quot;. Shortly after he assumed office in 1904, he ordered design studies for a battleship armed solely with guns and a speed of . He convened a Committee on Designs to evaluate the alternative designs and to assist in the detailed design work.

&quot;Dreadnought&quot; was the first battleship of her era to have a uniform main battery, rather than having a few large guns complemented by a heavy secondary armament of smaller guns. She was also the first capital ship to be powered by steam turbines, making her the fastest battleship in the world at the time of her completion. Her launch helped spark a naval arms race as navies around the world, particularly the Imperial German Navy, rushed to match it in the build-up to the First World War.

Although designed to engage enemy battleships, her only significant action was the ramming and sinking of German submarine ; thus she became the only battleship confirmed to have sunk a submarine. &quot;Dreadnought&quot; did not participate in the Battle of Jutland in 1916 as she was being refitted, nor did she participate in any of the other naval battles in World War I. In July 1916 she was relegated to coastal defence duties in the English Channel, before rejoining the Grand Fleet in 1918. The ship was reduced to reserve in 1919 and sold for scrap two years later.

==Genesis==
===Background===
Gunnery developments in the late 1890s and the early 1900s, led in the United Kingdom by Percy Scott and in the United States by William Sims, were already pushing expected battle ranges out to an unprecedented , a distance great enough to force gunners to wait for the shells to arrive before applying corrections for the next salvo. A related problem was that the shell splashes from the more numerous smaller weapons tended to obscure the splashes from the bigger guns. Either the smaller-calibre guns would have to hold their fire to wait for the slower-firing heavies, losing the advantage of their faster rate of fire, or it would be uncertain whether a splash was due to a heavy or a light gun, making ranging and aiming unreliable. Another problem was that longer-range torpedoes were expected soon to be in service and these would discourage ships from closing to ranges where the smaller guns&#x27; faster rate of fire would become preeminent. Keeping the range open generally negated the threat from torpedoes and further reinforced the need for heavy guns of a uniform calibre.

In 1903, the Italian naval architect Vittorio Cuniberti first wrote about the concept of an all-big-gun battleship. When the Italian Navy did not pursue his ideas, Cuniberti wrote an article in &quot;Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; advocating his concept. He proposed an &quot;ideal&quot; future British battleship of , with a main battery of a dozen 12-inch guns in eight turrets, 12 inches of belt armour, and a speed of .
The Royal Navy (RN), the Imperial Japanese Navy and the United States Navy all recognised these issues before 1905. The RN modified the design of the to include a secondary armament of guns that could fight at longer ranges than the guns on older ships, but a proposal to arm them solely with 12-inch guns was rejected. The was laid down as an all-big-gun battleship, five months before &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, but gun shortages allowed her to be equipped with only four of the twelve 12-inch guns that had been planned. The Americans began design work on an all-big-gun battleship around the same time in 1904, but progress was leisurely and the two s were not ordered until March 1906, five months after &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was laid down, and the month after she was launched.

The invention by Charles Algernon Parsons of the steam turbine in 1884 led to a significant increase in the speed of ships with his dramatic unauthorised demonstration of his yacht &quot;Turbinia&quot; with her speed of up to at Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee at Spithead in 1897. After further trials of two turbine-powered destroyers, and , coupled with the positive experiences of several small passenger ships with turbines, &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was ordered with turbines.

The Battle of the Yellow Sea and Battle of Tsushima were analysed by Fisher&#x27;s Committee, with Captain William Pakenham&#x27;s statement that &quot;12-inch gunfire&quot; by both sides demonstrated hitting power and accuracy, whilst 10-inch shells passed unnoticed. Admiral Fisher wanted his board to confirm, refine and implement his ideas of a warship that had both the speed of 21 knots and 12-inch guns, pointing out that at the Battle of Tsushima, the Japanese ships commanded by Admiral Togo had been able to &quot;cross the T&quot; of the Russian ships due to speed. The long-range () engagement during the Battle of the Yellow Sea, in particular, although never experienced by any navy prior to the battle, seemed to confirm what the RN already believed.

===Development===

Admiral Fisher proposed several designs for battleships with a uniform armament in the early 1900s, and he gathered an unofficial group of advisors to assist him in deciding on the ideal characteristics in early 1904. After he was appointed First Sea Lord on 20 October 1904, he pushed through the Board of Admiralty a decision to arm the next battleship with 12 inch guns and that it would have a speed no less than 21 knots. In January 1905, he convened a &quot;Committee on Designs&quot;, including many members of his informal group, to evaluate the various design proposals and to assist in the detailed design process. While nominally independent it served to deflect criticism of Fisher and the Board of Admiralty as it had no ability to consider options other than those already decided upon by the Admiralty. Fisher appointed all of the members of the committee and he was President of the .

The committee decided on the layout of the main armament, rejecting any superfiring arrangements because of concerns about the effects of muzzle blast on the open sighting hoods on the turret roof below, and chose turbine propulsion over reciprocating engines to save in total displacement on 18 January 1905. Before disbanding on 22 February, it decided on a number of other issues, including the number of shafts (up to six were considered), the size of the anti-torpedo boat armament, and most importantly, to add longitudinal bulkheads to protect the magazines and shell rooms from underwater explosions. This was deemed necessary after the was thought to have survived a Japanese torpedo hit during the Russo–Japanese War by virtue of her heavy internal bulkhead. To avoid increasing the displacement of the ship, the thickness of her waterline belt was reduced by .

The Committee reported their findings in March 1905. It was decided due to the experimental nature of the design to delay placing orders for any other ships until &quot;Dreadnought&quot; and her trials had been completed. Once the design had been finalised the hull form was designed and tested at the Admiralty&#x27;s experimental ship tank at Gosport. Seven iterations were required before the final hull form was selected. Once the design was finalized, a team of three assistant constructors and 13 draughtsmen produced detailed drawings. To assist in speeding up the ship&#x27;s construction, the internal hull structure was simplified as much as possible and an attempt was made to standardize on a limited number of standard plates, which varied only in their thickness.

==Description==
===Overview===

&quot;Dreadnought&quot; was significantly larger than the two ships of the &quot;Lord Nelson&quot; class, which were under construction at the same time. She had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. She displaced at normal load and at deep load, almost more than the earlier ships. She had a metacentric height of at deep load and a complete double bottom.

Officers were customarily housed aft, but &quot;Dreadnought&quot; reversed the old arrangement, so that the officers were closer to their action stations. This was very unpopular with the officers, not least because they were now berthed near the noisy auxiliary machinery while the turbines made the rear of the ship much quieter than they had been in earlier steamships. This arrangement lasted among the British dreadnoughts until the of 1910. The crew numbered 700 officers and ratings in 1907, but increased to 810 in 1916.

===Propulsion===
Vickers, Sons &amp; Maxim was the prime contractor for the ship&#x27;s machinery, but as they had no large turbine experience, they sourced them from Parsons. &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was the first battleship to use turbines in place of the older reciprocating triple-expansion steam engines. She had two paired sets of direct-drive turbines, each of which drove two diameter, three-bladed propellers using steam provided by 18 Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers that had a working pressure of . The turbines, rated at , were intended to give a maximum speed of 21 knots; the ship reached from during her sea trials on 9 October 1906.

&quot;Dreadnought&quot; carried of coal, and an additional of fuel oil that was to be sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. At full capacity, she could steam for at a speed of .

===Armament===

&quot;Dreadnought&quot;″s main armament consisted of ten 45-calibre BL 12-inch Mark X guns in five twin Mark BVIII gun turrets. The forward turret (&#x27;A&#x27;) and two aft turrets (&#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27;) were located along the centreline of the ship. Two wing turrets (&#x27;P&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27;) were located port and starboard of the forward superstructure respectively. &quot;Dreadnought&quot; could deliver a broadside of eight guns between 60° before the beam and 50° the beam. Beyond these limits she could fire six guns aft, and four forward. On bearings 1° ahead or astern she could fire six guns, although she would have inflicted blast damage on the superstructure.

The guns could be depressed to −3° and elevated to +13.5°. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of , giving a maximum range of with armour-piercing (AP) 2 crh shells. Using the more aerodynamic, but slightly heavier, 4 crh AP shells extended the range to . The rate of fire of these guns was about two rounds per minute. The ships carried 80 rounds per gun.
The secondary armament initially consisted of twenty-seven 50-calibre, quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder 18 cwt Mark I guns. The guns had an elevation range between −10° and +20°. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of . The guns had a rate of fire of 20 rounds per minute. The ship carried three hundred rounds for each gun.

The original plan was to dismount the eight guns on the forecastle and quarterdeck and stow them on chocks on the deck during daylight to prevent them from being damaged by muzzle blast from the main guns. Gun trials in December 1906 proved that this was more difficult than expected and the two port guns from the forecastle and the outer starboard gun from the quarterdeck were transferred to turret roofs, giving each turret two guns. The remaining forecastle guns and the outer port gun from the quarterdeck were removed by the end of 1907, which reduced the total to twenty-four guns. During her April–May 1915 refit, the two guns from the roof of &#x27;A&#x27; turret were reinstalled in the original positions on the starboard side of the quarterdeck. A year later, the two guns at the rear of the superstructure were removed, reducing the ship to twenty-two guns. Two of the quarterdeck guns were given high-angle mounts for anti-aircraft duties and the two guns abreast the conning tower were removed in 1917.

A pair of QF six-pounder () Hotchkiss anti-aircraft guns on high-angle mountings were mounted on the quarterdeck in 1915. They had a maximum depression of −8° and a maximum elevation of +60°. The shell was fired at a muzzle velocity of . They were replaced by a pair of QF 3-inch 20 cwt guns on high-angle Mark II mounts in 1916. These guns had a maximum depression of 10° and a maximum elevation of 90°. They fired a 12.5-pound shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of 29 rounds per minute. They had a maximum effective ceiling of .

&quot;Dreadnought&quot; carried five 18-inch (450 mm) submerged torpedo tubes, two on each broadside and one in the stern. Twenty-three torpedoes were carried for them. In addition six torpedoes were carried for her steam picket boats.

===Fire control===
&quot;Dreadnought&quot; was one of the first vessels of the Royal Navy to be fitted with instruments for electrically transmitting range, order and deflection information to the turrets. The control positions for the main armament were located in the spotting top at the head of the foremast and on a platform on the roof of the signal tower. Data from a Barr and Stroud FQ-2 rangefinder located at each control position was input into a Dumaresq mechanical computer and electrically transmitted to Vickers range clocks located in the Transmitting Station located beneath each position on the main deck, where it was converted into range and deflection data for use by the guns. Voice pipes were retained for use between the Transmitting Station and the control positions. The target&#x27;s data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. The turrets, Transmitting Stations, and control positions could be connected in almost any combination.

Firing trials against in 1907 revealed this system&#x27;s vulnerability to gunfire, as its spotting top was hit twice and a large splinter severed the voice pipe and all wiring running along the mast. To guard against this possibility, &quot;Dreadnought&quot;″s fire-control system was comprehensively upgraded during her refits in 1912–13. The rangefinder in the foretop was given a gyro-stabilized Argo mount and &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; turrets were upgraded to serve as secondary control positions for any portion or all of the main armament. An additional 9-foot rangefinder was installed on the compass platform. In addition, &#x27;A&#x27; turret was fitted with another 9-foot rangefinder at the rear of the turret roof and a Mark I Dreyer Fire Control Table was installed in the main Transmitting Station. It combined the functions of the Dumaresq and the range clock.

Fire-control technology advanced quickly during the years immediately preceding the First World War, and the most important development was the director firing system. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided data to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crew were to follow. The director layer fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. A prototype was fitted in &quot;Dreadnought&quot; in 1909, but it was removed to avoid conflict with her duties as flagship of the Home Fleet. Preparations to install a production director were made during her May–June 1915 refit and every turret received a rangefinder at the same time. The exact date of the installation of the director is not known, other than it was not fitted before the end of 1915, and it was most likely mounted during her April–June 1916 refit.

===Armour===
&quot;Dreadnought&quot; used Krupp cemented armour throughout, unless otherwise mentioned. Her waterline belt measured thick, but tapered to at its lower edge. It extended from the rear of &#x27;A&#x27; barbette to the centre of &#x27;Y&#x27; barbette. Oddly, it was reduced to abreast &#x27;A&#x27; barbette. A extension ran from &#x27;A&#x27; barbette forward to the bow and a similar 4 inch extension ran aft to the stern. An bulkhead was angled obliquely inwards from the end of the main belt to the side of &#x27;X&#x27; barbette to fully enclose the armoured citadel at middle deck level. An 8-inch belt sat above the main belt, but only ran as high as the main deck. One major problem with &quot;Dreadnought&quot;″s armour scheme was that the top of the 11 inch belt was only above the waterline at normal load and it was submerged by over 12 inches at deep load, which meant that the waterline was then protected only by the 8 inch upper belt.

The turret faces and sides were protected by 11 inches of armour, while the turret roofs used 3 inches of Krupp non-cemented armour (KNC). The exposed faces of the barbettes were 11 inches thick, but the inner faces were 8 inches thick above the main deck. &#x27;X&#x27; barbette&#x27;s was 8 inches thick all around. Below the main deck, the barbettes&#x27; armour thinned to four inches except for &#x27;A&#x27; barbette (eight inches) and &#x27;Y&#x27; which remained 11 inches thick. The thickness of the main deck ranged from . The middle deck was thick on the flat and where it sloped down to meet the bottom edge of the main belt. Over the magazine for &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; turrets it was 3 inches thick, on slope and flat both. The lower deck armour was forward and 2 inches aft where it increased to 3 inches to protect the steering gear.

The sides of the conning tower were 11 inches thick and it had a 3-inch roof of KNC. It had a communications tube with 8 inch walls of mild steel down to the Transmitting Station on the middle deck. The walls of the signal tower were 8 inches thick while it had a roof of 3 inches of KNC armour. 2 inch torpedo bulkheads were fitted abreast the magazines and shell rooms of &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; turrets, but this increased to 4 inches abreast &#x27;P&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27; turrets to compensate for their outboard location.

In common with all major warships of her day, &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was fitted with anti-torpedo nets, but these were removed early in the war, since they caused considerable loss of speed and were easily defeated by torpedoes fitted with net-cutters.

===Electrical equipment===
Electrical power was provided by three 100 kW, 100 V DC Siemens generators, powered by two Brotherhood steam and two Mirrlees diesel engines (which later changed to three steam and one diesel). Among the equipment powered by 100 volt DC and 15 volt DC electrical systems were five lifts (elevators), eight coaling winches, pumps, ventilation fans, lighting and telephone systems.

==Construction==

&quot;Dreadnought&quot; was the sixth ship of the RN to bear the name &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, which means &quot;fear nothing&quot;. To meet Fisher&#x27;s goal of building the ship in a single year, material was stockpiled in advance and a great deal of prefabrication was done from May 1905 with about 6,000 man weeks of work expended before she was formally laid down on 2 October 1905. She was built at HM Dockyard, Portsmouth, which was regarded as the fastest-building shipyard in the world. No. 5 Slip was screened from prying eyes; attempts were made to indicate that the design was no different to other battleships. Some 1,100 men were already employed by the time she was laid down, but soon this number rose to 3,000. Whereas on previous ships the men had worked a 48-hour week, they were required on &quot;Dreadnought&quot; to work a 69-hour, six-day week from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., which included compulsory overtime with only a 30-minute lunch break. While double-shifting was considered to ease the long hours which were unpopular with the men, this was not possible due to labour shortages. On Day 6 (7 October), the first of the bulkheads and most of the middle-deck beams were in place. By Day 20, the forward part of the bow was in position and the hull plating was well underway. By Day 55 all of the upper-deck beams were in place, and by Day 83 the upper deck plates were in position. By Day 125 (4 February), the hull was finished.

&quot;Dreadnought&quot; was christened with a bottle of Irvine&#x27;s sparkling Australian wine by King Edward VII on 10 February 1906, after only four months on the ways. The bottle required multiple blows to shatter on a bow that later became famous. Signifying the ship&#x27;s importance the launch had been planned to be a large elaborate festive event. But the court was still in mourning for Queen Alexandra&#x27;s father who had died 12 days before, so she did not attend and a more sober event occurred. Post-launch fitting out of the ship was done at No.15 Dock.

Sources differ on the cost of the ship&#x27;s construction: £1,785,683, £1,783,883, and £1,672,483.

==Trials==
On 1 October 1906, steam was raised and she went to sea on 3 October 1906 for two days of trials at Devonport, only a year and a day after construction started. On the 9th she undertook her eight-hour-long full-power contractor trials off Polperro on the Cornwall coast during which she averaged 20.05 knots and 21.6 knots on the measured mile. She returned to Portsmouth for gun and torpedo trials before she completed her final fitting out. She was commissioned into the fleet on 11 December 1906, fifteen months after she was laid down. The suggestion that her building had been sped up by using guns and/or turrets originally designed for the &quot;Lord Nelson&quot;-class ships which preceded her is not borne out as the guns and turrets were not ordered until July 1905. It seems more likely that &quot;Dreadnought&quot;″s turrets and guns merely received higher priority than those of the earlier ships.

&quot;Dreadnought&quot; sailed for the Mediterranean Sea for extensive trials in December 1906 calling in at Arosa Bay, Gibraltar and Golfo d&#x27;Aranci before crossing the Atlantic to Port of Spain, Trinidad, in January 1907, returning to Portsmouth on 23 March 1907. During this cruise, her engines and guns were given a thorough workout by Captain Reginald Bacon, Fisher&#x27;s former Naval Assistant and a member of the Committee on Designs. His report stated, &quot;No member of the Committee on Designs dared to hope that all the innovations introduced would have turned out as successfully as had been the case.&quot; During this time she averaged between Gibraltar and Trinidad and from Trinidad to Portsmouth, an unprecedented high-speed performance. This shakedown cruise revealed several issues that were dealt with in subsequent refits, notably the replacement of her steering engines and the addition of cooling machinery to reduce the temperature levels in her magazines (cordite degrades more quickly at high temperatures). The most important issue, which was never addressed in her lifetime, was that the placement of her foremast behind the forward funnel put the spotting top right in the plume of hot exhaust gases, much to the detriment of her fighting ability.

==Career==

From 1907 to 1911, &quot;Dreadnought&quot; served as flagship of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Home Fleet. In 1910, she attracted the attention of notorious hoaxer Horace de Vere Cole, who persuaded the Royal Navy to arrange for a party of Abyssinian royals to be given a tour of a ship. In reality, the &quot;Abyssinian royals&quot; were some of Cole&#x27;s friends in blackface and disguise, including a young Virginia Woolf and her Bloomsbury Group friends; it became known as the &quot;Dreadnought&quot; hoax. Cole had picked &quot;Dreadnought&quot; because she was at that time the most prominent and visible symbol of Britain&#x27;s naval might.

She was replaced as flagship of the Home Fleet by in March 1911 and was assigned to the 1st Division of the Home Fleet. She participated in King George V&#x27;s Coronation Fleet Review in June 1911. &quot;Dreadnought&quot; became flagship of the 4th Battle Squadron in December 1912 after her transfer from the 1st Battle Squadron, as the 1st Division had been renamed earlier in the year. Between September and December 1913 she was training in the Mediterranean Sea.

At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, she was flagship of the 4th Battle Squadron in the North Sea, based at Scapa Flow. She was relieved as flagship on 10 December by . Ironically for a vessel designed to engage enemy battleships, her only significant action was the ramming and sinking of German submarine , skippered by K/Lt Otto Weddigen (of fame), in the Pentland Firth on 18 March 1915. &quot;U-29&quot; had broken the surface immediately ahead of &quot;Dreadnought&quot; after firing a torpedo at &quot;Neptune&quot;, and &quot;Dreadnought&quot; cut the submarine in two after a short chase. She almost collided with who was also attempting to ram the submarine. &quot;Dreadnought&quot; thus became the only battleship ever to purposefully sink an enemy submarine.

She was refitting at Portsmouth from 18 April to 22 June 1916 and missed the Battle of Jutland on 31 May, the most significant fleet engagement of the war. &quot;Dreadnought&quot; became flagship of the 3rd Battle Squadron on 9 July, based at Sheerness on the Thames, part of a force of pre-dreadnoughts intended to counter the threat of shore bombardment by German battlecruisers. During this time, she fired her AA guns at German aircraft that passed over her headed for London. She returned to the Grand Fleet in March 1918, resuming her role as flagship of the 4th Battle Squadron, but was paid off on 7 August 1918 at Rosyth. She was recommissioned on 25 February 1919 as a tender to to act as a parent ship for the Reserve Fleet.

&quot;Dreadnought&quot; was put up for sale on 31 March 1920 and sold for scrap to Thos. W. Ward on 9 May 1921 as one of the 113 ships that the firm purchased at a flat rate of £2. 10/- per ton, later reduced to £2. 4/- per ton. As &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was assessed at 16,650 tons, she cost the shipbreaker £36,630 though another source states £44,750. She was broken up at Ward&#x27;s new premises at Inverkeithing, Scotland, upon arrival on 2 January 1923. Very few artifacts from &quot;Dreadnought&quot; have survived, although a gun tompion is in the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich.

==Significance==

Her design so thoroughly eclipsed earlier types that subsequent battleships of all nations were generically known as &quot;dreadnoughts&quot; and older battleships as &quot;pre-dreadnoughts&quot;. Her very short construction time was intended to demonstrate that Britain could build an unassailable lead in the new type of battleships. Her construction sparked a naval arms race, and soon all major fleets were adding &quot;Dreadnought&quot;-like ships.

In 1960, Britain&#x27;s first nuclear submarine was named . The name will be used again for the lead ship of the new class of Trident missile submarines.

The modern acoustic guitar developed with a wide, deep body was named the Dreadnought shape after this ship.

In 2014, a newly classified genus of Titanosaurid sauropod dinosaurs was named &quot;Dreadnoughtus&quot; due to its gigantic size making it &quot;virtually impervious&quot; to attack; the name, which means &quot;fear nothing&quot;, was inspired by the battleship.

<doc id="717455" wikidata="Q11253736" url="?curid=717455" title="Skinner v. Oklahoma">
<text>Skinner v. State of Oklahoma, ex rel. Williamson, 316 U.S. 535 (1942), is a unanimous United States Supreme Court ruling that held that laws permitting the compulsory sterilization of criminals are unconstitutional as it violates a person&#x27;s rights given under the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution, specifically the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause. The relevant Oklahoma law applied to &quot;habitual criminals&quot; but excluded white-collar crimes from carrying sterilization penalties.

==Background==
In 1935, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma ruled in favor of the Habitual Criminal Sterilization Act, which allowed the state to impose a sentence of compulsory sterilization as part of their judgment against individuals who had been convicted three or more times of crimes &quot;amounting to felonies involving moral turpitude.&quot; Exceptions to that ruling were those who committed what are considered white-collar crimes.

All defendants were provided with a jury trial organized by the State Attorney. The jury was asked whether the defendant was a habitual criminal according to the definition of the act and, if so, to conclude that sterilization would have no other negative effect on the defendant&#x27;s health; if the jury so determined, the defendant would be punished by sterilization. Most punitive sterilization laws, including the Oklahoma statute, prescribed vasectomy for males and salpingectomy for females as the method of rendering the individual infertile.

The Sterilization Act was first put to use in May 1936. Hubert Moore, a five-time convict, was the first individual the state had given an approved petition for sterilization. When other prisoners heard the news of the approved petition, they rioted and attempted to escape. Hubert Moore escaped from prison in June 1936.

The second petition approved was for Jack T. Skinner, convicted once for stealing chickens and twice for armed robbery. In October 1936, he was convicted a fourth time and sentenced to sterilization. Skinner&#x27;s lawyers, Heba Irwin Aston and Guy Andrews, took their appeal to the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, claiming jeopardization of Skinner&#x27;s rights as given under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court of Oklahoma ruled against the appeal 5-4 and maintained the sentence of sterilization.

Skinner&#x27;s lawyers challenged the ruling of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma by bringing an appeal to the United States Supreme Court. The oral arguments were heard May 6, 1942, and the decision was given on June 1, 1942.

==Decision==
The Court held unanimously that the Act violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because those convicted of white-collar crime, such as embezzlement, were excluded from the Act&#x27;s jurisdiction.

Justice William O. Douglas concluded:

Furthermore, because of the social and biological implications of reproduction and the irreversibility of sterilization operations, Justice Douglas also stressed that compulsory sterilization laws in general should be held to strict scrutiny:

In a separate concurring opinion, Chief Justice Harlan F. Stone stated that while he concurred with Justice Douglas&#x27;s opinion, he believed that in his opinion, the Act violated the Due Process Clause, specifically procedural due process, more than it violated the Fourteenth Amendment. His main argument was that for legislation to convict and sterilize the defendant, there needed to be proof that criminal behavior could be inherited genetically, which the court had none at the time. He cited &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot; and said that because it has been proven that feeblemindedness is inheritable, sterilization was acceptable, but in the case of &quot;Skinner v. Oklahoma&quot;, it was not.

==Aftermath==
The only types of sterilization that the Court&#x27;s ruling immediately ended were punitive sterilization. It did not directly comment on compulsory sterilization of the mentally disabled or the mentally ill and was not a strict overturning of &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot; (1927). Furthermore, most of the over 64,000 sterilizations performed in the US under the aegis of eugenics legislation were not in prison institutions or performed on convicted criminals. Punitive sterilizations made up only negligible amounts of the total operations performed, as most states and prison officials were nervous about their legal status, which was not affirmed in &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot; specifically, as possible violations of the Eighth (&quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot;) or Fourteenth Amendments (&quot;Due Process&quot; and &quot;Equal Protection Clauses&quot;). Compulsory sterilizations of the mentally disabled and mentally ill continued in the US in significant numbers until the early 1960s. Although many state laws stayed on the books for many years longer, the last known forced sterilization in the United States occurred in 1981 in Oregon. Federal law prohibits use of federal funds to sterilize &quot;any mentally incompetent or institutionalized individual,&quot; but states including California use state funds for tubal ligations. A 2013 report showed that between 2006 and 2010, at least 148 women were sterilized after childbirth while incarcerated in two California prisons. In violation of state rules passed in 1994, none of the cases were reviewed by a state oversight committee.

Over a third of all compulsory sterilizations in the United States (over 22,670) took place after &quot;Skinner v. Oklahoma&quot;. The 1942 ruling, however, created a nervous legal atmosphere regarding the other forms of sterilizations and put a heavy damper on sterilization rates, which had boomed since &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot; in 1927. After the discovery of the Nazi atrocities done in the name of eugenics, including the compulsory sterilization of 450,000 individuals in barely more than a decade, under a sterilization law, which drew heavy inspiration from American statutes, and the close association between eugenics and racism, eugenics, as an ideology, lost almost all public favor.

In Equal Protection analysis, &quot;Skinner&quot; applied the compelling state interest test to punitive sterilization, but &quot;Buck&quot; applied the less rigorous rational basis test to compulsory sterilization of the mentally disabled.

In 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that an inmate, incarcerated by the California Department of Corrections and serving a life sentence, was not permitted to inseminate his wife artificially because &quot;the right to procreate is fundamentally inconsistent with incarceration.&quot; The Appellate Court distinguished the case from &quot;Skinner v. Oklahoma&quot; because &quot;the right to procreate while incarcerated and the right to be free from surgical sterilization by prison officials are two very different things.&quot;

<text>[[Sir]] Bryn Terfel Jones, (; born 9 November 1965; known professionally as Bryn Terfel), is a Welsh bass-baritone opera and concert singer. Terfel was initially primarily associated with the roles of Mozart, particularly &quot;Figaro&quot;, &quot;Leporello&quot; and &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, and has subsequently shifted his attention to heavier roles, especially those by Puccini and Wagner.

==Biography==
Bryn Terfel Jones was born in Pant Glas, Caernarfonshire, Wales, the son of a farmer. His first language is Welsh. To avoid confusion with another Welsh baritone, Delme Bryn-Jones, he chose Bryn Terfel as his professional name. He had an interest in and talent for music from a very young age. A family friend taught him how to sing, starting with traditional Welsh songs.

After winning numerous competitions for his singing, he moved to London in 1984 and entered the Guildhall School of Music and Drama where he studied under Rudolf Piernay. In 1988 he entered and won the Morriston Orpheus Choir Supporters&#x27; Association Young Welsh Singer of the Year Competition. He graduated in 1989, winning both the Kathleen Ferrier Memorial Award and the Gold Medal. The same year he came second behind Dmitri Hvorostovsky in the Cardiff Singer of the World competition, but won the Lieder Prize.

===Career===
====1990s====
In 1990 Terfel made his operatic debut as Guglielmo in &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; for Welsh National Opera, and later in the same season he sang the title role in &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, a role with which he made his debut with English National Opera in 1991.

His international operatic career began that same year when he sang the Speaker in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; at the Théâtre de la Monnaie in Brussels and he made his United States debut as Figaro at the Santa Fe Opera.

In 1992 Terfel made his Royal Opera House, Covent Garden debut as Masetto in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, with Thomas Allen in the title role. That same year he made his Salzburg Easter Festival debut singing the role of the Spirit Messenger in &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot;. This was followed by an international breakthrough at the main Salzburg Festival when he sang Jochanaan in Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Salome&quot;. He went on to make his debut as Figaro at the Vienna State Opera.

On 19 June 1992 Terfel made his U.S. concert debut singing in Mahler&#x27;s Eighth Symphony with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at the Ravinia Festival under the baton of James Levine. Also at the festival, on 22 June, he and Levine (at the piano) performed Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Liederkreis&quot; (op. 39) and Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Schwanengesang&quot;, and on 27 June he was Abimélech in Saint-Saëns&#x27;s &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; (with Plácido Domingo and Denyce Graves in the title roles), also with the CSO under Levine. In January and February 1993, Terfel sang the role of Donner in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; at Lyric Opera of Chicago; Zubin Mehta conducted.

Also in 1992, he signed an exclusive recording contract with Deutsche Grammophon, and returned to the Welsh National Opera to sing Ford in &quot;Falstaff&quot;. In 1993, he recorded the role of Wilfred Shadbolt in &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot;, by Gilbert and Sullivan and sang Figaro to acclaim at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris.
In 1994 Terfel sang Figaro at Covent Garden, and made both his Metropolitan Opera and Teatro Nacional de São Carlos debuts in the same role. However, back surgery in 1994 (and again in 2000) prevented him from performing in several scheduled events.

In 1996 he expanded his repertoire to include more Wagner, singing Wolfram in &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera, and Stravinsky, singing Nick Shadow in &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; at the Welsh National Opera. These performances won him the Royal Philharmonic Society Award for the singer of the year.

In 1997 Terfel made his La Scala debut as Figaro. In 1998, he had a recital at Carnegie Hall which included works by Wolf, Fauré, Brahms, Schumann, Schubert, and others. In 1999, he performed in Paris the title role of &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; for the first time and sang his first &quot;Falstaff&quot; at the Lyric Opera of Chicago; the latter of which he reprised in the inaugural production at the newly refurbished Royal Opera House.

In 1999 Terfel performed the Rugby World Cup anthem &quot;World in Union&quot; with Shirley Bassey at the Millennium Stadium before the 1999 Rugby World Cup Final.

====2000s====
In 2000 Terfel said that he would like to record &quot;an album of Gilbert and Sullivan arias&quot;.

In 2003, Terfel hosted and performed on the stage with opera tenor José Carreras and soprano Hayley Westenra in front of the capacity crowd of 10,000 people at the Faenol Festival in Wales.

In 2007 Terfel performed at the opening gala concert for the re-dedication of the Salt Lake Tabernacle with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir on 6–7 April. Later, he performed the title role in a concert version of &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; that had four performances from 5–7 July at London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall. This idea came from Terfel and his fellow bass-baritone and friend, the Irishman Dermot Malone.

Terfel has not shied away from popular music either. He has recorded CDs of songs by Lerner and Loewe and Rodgers and Hammerstein. In 2001 he commissioned and performed &#x27;Atgof o&#x27;r Sêr&#x27; (&#x27;Memory of the Stars&#x27;) in the National Eisteddfod with the composer Robat Arwyn.

In September 2007 Terfel withdrew, to severe criticism, from Covent Garden&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; when his six-year-old son required several operations on his finger. But he successfully returned to the Met in November 2007 to sing the role of Figaro. He told reporters in New York City that he would retire Figaro from his repertoire. But he sang the role of Wotan in Covent Garden&#x27;s revival of &quot;Der Ring&quot; in September to November 2012.

Terfel intended to take 2008 as a sabbatical from opera performances, but broke this to take the title role in WNO&#x27;s revival of &quot;Falstaff&quot;. He had sung in this production in 1993, when he played the role of Ford. In 2009 Terfel sang Scarpia and the Dutchman for the Royal Opera House.

====Since 2010====
In 2010, Terfel made his debut as Hans Sachs in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot; in a production for Welsh National Opera, in Cardiff and on tour.

On 17 July 2010, the cast of this production gave a &quot;concert staging&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall as part of the 2010 BBC Proms, which was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 and on BBC Four television. On 31 July, again at the Proms, he performed in a concert from the Royal Albert Hall celebrating the works of Stephen Sondheim, in his 80th birthday year.

Terfel took on the role of Wotan for the premiere performances of Robert Lepage&#x27;s new Met staging of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring&quot; 2010–12. He sang the role in all three of the four &quot;Der Ring&quot; operas that feature Wotan: &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;, &quot;Die Walküre&quot; and &quot;Siegfried&quot;.

In September 2013 Terfel collaborated with Mormon Tabernacle Choir released the album &quot;Homeward Bound&quot; which reached No. 58 Official UK Charts.

In September 2014 Terfel reprised his role as Sweeney Todd in the Live from Lincoln Center concert production of &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;, which was broadcast on PBS. This production also starred Emma Thompson as Mrs Lovett, Philip Quast as Judge Turpin, and Audra McDonald as The Beggar Woman. Terfel, Thompson, and Quest reprised their roles in 2015 with the English National Opera opposite John Owen-Jones and Katie Hall as Pirelli and Johanna at the London Coliseum.

In 2016 Terfel took the title role in Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, directed by Antonio Pappano at the Royal Opera House.

On 6 May 2023 Terfel performed a setting in Welsh, by Paul Mealor, of Kyrie eleison at the Coronation of Charles III and Camilla in Westminster Abbey. This was the first time Welsh had been sung at a coronation service. On 7 May he sang &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;, in a duet with Andrea Bocelli, at the Coronation Concert at Windsor Castle.

In February 2024 Terfel released a new album, &quot;Sea Songs&quot;, on Deutsche Grammophon.

In 2025 Terfel was one of the coaches in &quot;Y Llais&quot;, a Welsh-language version of The Voice UK.

===Personal life===
Terfel was married to his childhood sweetheart, Lesley, in 1987 until their divorce in 2013.
 The couple have three sons.

In 2017 he and harpist Hannah Stone had a daughter. The couple married on 26 July 2019 at Caersalem Newydd Baptist Church in the bride&#x27;s home city of Swansea.

Terfel was a leading petitioner in the creation of Bontnewydd railway station on the rebuilt Welsh Highland Railway, and in part sponsored its construction.

==Faenol Festival==
In 2000 Terfel founded the Faenol Festival (known in Welsh as &quot;Gŵyl y Faenol&quot;), at the Faenol Estate near Snowdonia, Wales. Billed as &quot;Bryn Terfel&#x27;s Faenol Festival&quot; (often referred to as &quot;BrynFest&quot;) turned into an annual music festival featuring internationally famous opera singers as well as popular Welsh artists. In the same year he released &quot;We&#x27;ll Keep a Welcome – The Welsh Album&quot;, an anthology of favourite traditional songs. The festival had been voted a £250,000 grant by the Welsh Assembly, but did not take place in 2009 or 2010 and ended as of 2010. Subsequently, the 2012 Faenol Festival took place in London.

<text>MetroLink is a light rail system that serves the Greater St. Louis area. Operated by Metro Transit in a shared fare system with MetroBus, the two-line, 38-station system runs from St. Louis Lambert International Airport and Shrewsbury in Missouri to Scott Air Force Base in Illinois. Intermediate destinations include downtown Clayton, Forest Park, and downtown St. Louis. It is the only U.S. light rail system that crosses state lines. 

MetroLink shares some characteristics of a light metro or rapid transit service, including a largely independent right-of-way, a higher top speed, and level boarding at all platforms. Being a light rail network, but with sections of tunnels creating a separate right-of-way, MetroLink can therefore be categorised as a semi-metro system.

In , the system had an annual ridership of , or about per weekday.

== History ==

Construction on the initial MetroLink line from St. Louis Lambert International Airport to the 5th &amp; Missouri station in East St. Louis began in 1990. The first segment opened on July 31, 1993, with 16 stations between North Hanley and 5th &amp; Missouri. The extension to Lambert Airport Main opened on June 25, 1994. Three infill stations have since been added to this alignment: East Riverfront in 1994, Lambert Airport East in 1998, and Cortex in 2018.

About of the original alignment reused existing railroad right-of-way including historic downtown tunnels. The capital cost to build the initial phase of MetroLink was $465 million, including $348 million from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA).

Construction on the St. Clair County MetroLink extension from the 5th &amp; Missouri station to the College station in Belleville began in 1998 and opened in May 2001. The extension added eight stations and seven park-ride lots. The total project cost was $339.2 million with $243.9 million paid by the FTA and $95.2 million paid by the St. Clair County Transit District (via a 1/2 cent sales tax passed in November 1993).

In May 2003, a extension from the College station to the Shiloh-Scott station opened. This $75 million project was funded by a $60 million grant from the Illinois FIRST (Fund for Infrastructure, Roads, Schools, and Transit) Program and $15 million from the St. Clair County Transit District.

The Cross County Extension opened on August 26, 2006 and added nine stations from Forest Park-DeBaliviere to Shrewsbury, Missouri. Intermediate stops include service to Washington University, Clayton, the Saint Louis Galleria and Maplewood. The entire project was funded by a $430 million Metro bond issue. Citing repeated delays and cost overruns, Metro fired and then sued its general contractor, Cross County Collaborative, in the summer of 2004. Metro sought $81 million in damages for fraud and mismanagement while the Collaborative counter-sued for $17 million for work that Metro hadn&#x27;t paid for. On December 1, 2007, a jury awarded the Collaborative $2.56 million.On October 27, 2008, Metro renamed the Lambert Airport branch the Red Line and the Shrewsbury branch the Blue Line. Blue Line service was also extended from its former terminus at Emerson Park to Fairview Heights. All trains have signs on the front and side that identify the train as a Red or Blue line train, and operators make live announcements identifying lines and stations.

On September 9, 2014, the United States Department of Transportation announced $10.3 million in funding for a new Metrolink station between the Central West End and Grand stations in the Cortex Innovation Community. An additional $5 million in funding was provided by a public-private partnership including Washington University, BJC HealthCare, Great Rivers Greenway and Cortex. The new Cortex station, located just east of Boyle Avenue, opened to the public on July 31, 2018.

On June 15, 2019, MetroLink set its single day ridership record when over 100,000 people used the service to attend the parade after the St. Louis Blues won the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs.

On July 26, 2022, a flash flood shut down MetroLink for nearly 72 hours and caused roughly $40 million in damage. The flood damaged nearly of track bed, two elevators, two communications rooms, three signal houses and destroyed two MetroLink vehicles. By that September, normal Red Line service had resumed while restricted service continued on the Blue Line. On July 31, 2023, Metro received $27.7 million in federal emergency disaster relief funding to help cover the cost of restoration. In March 2024, Blue Line platform and speed restrictions were lifted after repairs on the last signal house were completed.

In 2023, Bi-State&#x27;s board approved a memorandum of understanding authorizing the Metro team to plan and develop the Green Line expansion with the City of St. Louis. In May, Metro received a $196.2 million federal grant to purchase new light rail vehicles to replace the remaining SD-400 cars. Six months later, Bi-State&#x27;s board approved a contract with Siemens Mobility worth up to $390.4 million for as many as 55 new S200 light rail vehicles with delivery expected to begin in 2027.

=== Chronology ===
Below is a list of dates on which segments of the MetroLink system opened for service.

== Current rail lines ==
=== Red Line ===
The 38-mile (61 km) Red Line begins at St. Louis Lambert International Airport, making stops at the Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 stations. It proceeds through Kinloch, then stops at the North Hanley station near Bel-Ridge. It makes two stops (UMSL North &amp; UMSL South) at the University of Missouri St. Louis in Normandy. After UMSL, trains run on the old Wabash/Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad&#x27;s Union Depot line that once brought passenger trains from Ferguson to Union Station. Traveling into Pagedale, it stops at the Rock Road station and then at Wellston&#x27;s namesake station on Plymouth Street. Entering St. Louis City at Skinker Boulevard, the line stops at the Delmar Loop station and its namesake entertainment district. At the following station, Forest Park-DeBaliviere, the Red Line meets the Blue Line; the lines then share tracks until the Blue Line terminates at the Fairview Heights station in Illinois.

=== Blue Line ===

The Blue Line alignment starts at the Shrewsbury-Lansdowne I-44 station in Shrewsbury, just west of the River des Peres. It crosses over Interstate 44 and continues north to two stations in Maplewood, Missouri (Sunnen and Maplewood/Manchester). The line continues north to the Brentwood I-64 station in Brentwood, Missouri, just south of Interstate 64. It then proceeds in a tunnel underneath Interstate 64, continuing to the Richmond Heights station, which serves the Saint Louis Galleria shopping mall. The line then proceeds through a sharp turn east to the Clayton station in the median of Forest Park Parkway in Clayton, Missouri, where it serves the Central Business District of St. Louis County. It heads east to the Forsyth station where it enters a tunnel to the University City-Big Bend subway station. After crossing the St. Louis City/County boundary, the Blue Line stops at the Skinker subway station, the last stop serving nearby Washington University. At the following station, Forest Park-DeBaliviere, the Blue Line meets the Red Line. From this station, the two services share track until the Blue Line terminates at the Fairview Heights station in Illinois. 

=== Shared alignment ===
In all, the Red and Blue lines share tracks for 16 stations. From west to east: the Central West End and Cortex stations that serve the Central West End neighborhood, Washington University Medical Center, and Cortex Innovation Community. The Grand station transfers with the busy #70 MetroBus line and serves Saint Louis University and its hospital. Next, the Union Station, Civic Center, Stadium, 8th &amp; Pine, Convention Center, and Laclede&#x27;s Landing stations serve downtown St. Louis and its many destinations. Crossing the historic Eads Bridge into Illinois, the line serves the East Riverfront, 5th &amp; Missouri, Emerson Park, Jackie Joyner-Kersee Center, and Washington Park stations in East St. Louis, Illinois. At the next station, Fairview Heights, the Blue Line ends. The Red Line continues south through Belleville, Illinois, to its terminus at the Shiloh–Scott station near Scott Air Force Base.

== Rolling stock ==

MetroLink operates 87 Siemens SD-400 and SD-460 light rail vehicles. Each , single articulated vehicle has four high platform doors per side and can hold 72 seated and 106 standing passengers. The cars are powered by an electric motor which gets its electricity from an overhead line with a supply.

Each car has an enclosed operator cab at each end. This configuration is the most flexible for operations but prevents travel between cars. Bicycles are permitted in the door vestibules adjacent to each unused cab. Each car has separate doors for boarding at station level and track level; in normal operations, the track-level doors (equipped with stairs) are unused.

In 2026, Metro plans to begin phasing out the original SD-400 cars and to refurbish the SD-460 cars for continued use. In May 2023, Metro received a $196.2 million federal grant to purchase up to 48 Siemens S200 high-floor light rail vehicles to replace 25 of the oldest cars. Six months later, Bi-State&#x27;s board approved a contract with Siemens Mobility worth up to $390.4 million for as many as 55 new light rail vehicles.

Metro operates two storage and maintenance facilities. Ewing Yard sits between the Grand and Union Station stops just west of downtown St. Louis; 29th Street Yard is located between the JJK Center and Washington Park stops in East St. Louis.

=== Roster ===
== Fares ==

MetroLink uses a proof-of-payment system. Tickets can be purchased at ticket-vending machines at the entrance to all stations and must be validated before boarding the train. Single-ride tickets are good for up to two hours in the direction that a passenger initially boards. Some fares, such as monthly or weekly fares, do not need to be validated, but passengers must have the pass in their possession while riding and must show the pass to security personnel upon request. Reduced fares can be purchased by seniors ages 65+, people with disabilities, and children ages 5–12. Up to three children under 5 may ride free with a fare-paying rider. Proof of age may be requested of all people riding with reduced fares. Other types of passes include a Semester Pass for full-time students.

In 2018, Metro introduced the Gateway Card, a multi-use smart card that was intended to eliminate most paper passes and tickets. In 2023, Metro announced that it would replace the Gateway Card—one Bi-State official called it a &quot;failed system&quot;—with a new fare collection system as part of the Secure Platform Plan.
== Projects in progress ==
=== MidAmerica Airport extension ===
In 2019, the St. Clair County Transit District was awarded $96 million in Illinois infrastructure funding to build a extension of the Red Line from Shiloh–Scott to MidAmerica St. Louis Airport in Mascoutah. This extension will include two segments, a double-track and a single-track segment, along with a station at the airport. Construction on the extension began in 2023 with Metro expecting completion in the spring of 2026.

=== System rehabilitation ===
In 2023, Metro began a system-wide rehabilitation program that will last several years. That spring, Metro began rehabilitating the downtown subway tunnels, including the Laclede&#x27;s Landing, Convention Center, and 8th &amp; Pine stations. Elsewhere, catenary wire, curve tracks, platforms, retaining walls, staircases, and system conduit are to be upgraded or replaced.

Beginning in 2025, Metro will start rehabilitating the Union Station tunnel with rehabilitation of the Cross County tunnels beginning in 2026. The latter will include the renovation of the Skinker and University City–Big Bend subway stations and the construction of a storage siding near the Richmond Heights station. In 2026, Metro expects to complete upgrades to the Supervisory Control Automated Data Acquisition (SCADA) and Public Address/Customer Information (PA/CIS) systems. The upgraded SCADA/PA/CIS will operate as an integrated system that monitors and controls operations and will allow Metro to provide real-time arrival information to passengers, such as live displays at stations.

=== Secure Platform Plan ===
In 2024, Metro Transit began adding turnstiles at all MetroLink stations as part of its $52 million Secure Platform Plan (SPP). Stations will also receive a new fare collection system, more fences, passenger-assist telephones, and more than 1,800 cameras to be monitored at a center opened in November 2022 at Metro&#x27;s Central Garage.

The SPP will be implemented in three &quot;packages&quot; with full operation expected to begin in 2026. In September 2023, Bi-State awarded a $6.4 million contract to Millstone Weber LLC for the first package covering four Illinois stations. The gates at these first four stations began operating in September 2024. However, due to delays in implementing a new fare collection system, Metro staff will operate the fare gates manually at first. The second package covers seven Missouri stations and is also slated for completion by early 2025. The remaining stations and the upgraded fare collection system are expected to be operational by early 2026.

== Projects in planning ==

=== North-South expansion ===
MetroLink&#x27;s proposed North-South light rail line would lack the rapid transit-like characteristics of the Red and Blue lines, resembling instead other U.S. on-street light rail lines, such as those in Houston or Phoenix. The new line has been named the Green Line and would connect to the Red and Blue lines with an infill transfer station.

This line would serve about 10 stations between Chippewa Street in South St. Louis and Grand Boulevard in North St. Louis running primarily on Jefferson Avenue. It would provide a fixed rail upgrade to Metro&#x27;s #11 (Chippewa) and #4 (Natural Bridge) bus routes. In September 2023, Bi-State Development&#x27;s board approved a 4-year, $18.9 million contract with the joint venture Northside-Southside Transit Partners to provide consulting services for the design phase of the project. In February 2024, the East-West Gateway Council of Governments approved the updated locally preferred alternative along Jefferson. The 2023 design study estimates 5,000 daily boardings, $8-9 million in annual operating costs, and $1.1 billion in capital costs.

An extension of the Green Line into North St. Louis County had been explored. In 2023, four alternatives were proposed that would have continued the line from the Grand/Fairground station along Natural Bridge Avenue toward the county. By 2024, County leadership had rejected all four routes primarily due to the unfunded gap between the Grand/Fairground station and the county line. Additionally, concerns were raised about federal funding, ridership, right-of-way constraints and other factors. Instead, county leaders are exploring alternatives for North County such as light rail branching off the existing Red Line near the University of Missouri–St. Louis, rapid bus service or a hybrid of the four 2023 alternatives.

== Previous proposals ==
These extensions were proposed between the year 2000 and in 2010 when Metro released its 30-year long range plan, Moving Transit Forward. Most are defunct; regional leaders have said their priorities are the proposed extensions in the city of St. Louis and North St. Louis County.

=== North-South ===

* Northside/Southside 2008. This expansion was planned in two separate locally preferred alternatives (LPA). In 2008 a Northside LPA was selected that would have traveled between downtown St. Louis and St. Louis Community College-Florissant Valley via North City and County. That same year, a Southside LPA was selected that would have traveled between downtown St. Louis and Bayless Avenue via South City and County.
* Northside/Southside 2018. In 2018, a updated Northside/Southside LPA was approved that shortened the expansion to an approximately alignment between Grand in North St. Louis and Chippewa in South St. Louis via a loop on 9th and 10th streets in downtown St. Louis. See Projects in planning section for updates on Northside/Southside as of 2024.

=== Cross County ===

* MetroSouth. This extension was envisioned as Cross County Segment 2 and would have extended the current Blue Line from its terminus in Shrewsbury further south beyond Interstates 270/255 to Butler Hill Road. A third alternative would have ended at Watson Road. An environmental impact study was completed in 2004; however, selection of an LPA was deferred due to the lack of local funding sources as well as other factors.
* MetroNorth. This approximately extension was envisioned as Cross County Segment 3 and would have extended the current Blue Line from Clayton towards Florissant, Missouri. Some of this segment would have followed the former Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis&#x27; Central Belt right-of-way paralleling Interstate 170.
* Daniel Boone. This extension would have branched off the Cross County corridor near Olive Boulevard along disused Rock Island Railroad right-of-way. It would then turn west and follow existing trackage operated by Central Midland Railway to Page Avenue where the line would continue to Westport Plaza. An approximately extension to Chesterfield would have been a potential Phase 2 of the Daniel Boone branch. The alignment would have continued west following Page Avenue and Highway 364 then turning towards Creve Coeur Lake Memorial Park. From there it would have headed to Spirit of St. Louis Airport in the Chesterfield Valley. This alignment has not been given serious consideration because of its perceived low ridership potential.

=== St. Charles County ===

* A plan to expand MetroLink from St. Louis Lambert International Airport northwest to St. Charles County was abandoned after St. Charles County voters twice rejected a sales tax for the extension in 1996; subsequently, all MetroBus service was ended. Had the extension been funded, the route would have used the Old St. Charles Bridge (now demolished) over the Missouri River to access the county.

=== Madison County ===

* In 2005, a study was performed to analyze extending MetroLink into Madison County, Illinois. The study recommended two alignments that would have begun near the 5th &amp; Missouri station in East St. Louis then continue through Granite City, Collinsville, Wood River, and Glen Carbon between away. The alignment would have split in Madison, Illinois with one branch ending in Alton and the other in Edwardsville. In order to execute any Madison County extensions, Metro would have to collaborate with Madison County Transit.

<text>The de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter is a Canadian STOL (Short Takeoff and Landing) utility aircraft developed by de Havilland Canada in the mid-1960s and still in production today. Built by De Havilland Canada from 1965 to 1988, Viking Air purchased the type certificate and restarted production in 2008, before re-adopting the DHC name in 2022. In 2023 DHC restarted production of the 300 series, in addition to the Series 400 produced by Viking.

The aircraft&#x27;s fixed tricycle undercarriage, STOL capabilities, twin turboprop engines and high rate of climb have made it a successful commuter airliner, typically seating 18–20 passengers, as well as a cargo and medical evacuation aircraft. In addition, the Twin Otter has been popular with commercial skydiving operations, and is used by the United States Army Parachute Team and the 98th Flying Training Squadron of the United States Air Force.

==Design and development==
Development of the aircraft began in 1964, with the first flight on 20 May 1965. A twin-engine replacement for the single-engine DHC-3 Otter retaining the DHC-3&#x27;s STOL qualities, its design features included double-slotted trailing-edge flaps and ailerons that work in unison with the flaps to boost STOL performance. The availability of the Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-20 turboprop in the early 1960s made the concept of a twin feasible. A DHC-3 Otter with its piston engine replaced with two PT6A-4 engines had already flown in 1963. It had been extensively modified for STOL research. To bush plane operators, the improved reliability of turboprop power and the improved performance of a twin-engine configuration made it an immediately popular alternative to the piston-powered Otter which had been flying since 1951.
The first six aircraft produced were designated Series 1, indicating that they were prototype aircraft. The initial production run consisted of Series 100 aircraft, serial numbers seven to 115 inclusive. In 1968, Series 200 production began with serial number 116. Changes made at the beginning of Series 200 production included improving the STOL performance, adding a longer nose that was equipped with a larger baggage compartment (except for aircraft fitted with floats), and fitting a larger door to the rear baggage compartment. All Series 1, 100, and 200 aircraft and their variants (110, 210) were fitted with the PT6A-20 engines.

In 1969, the Series 300 was introduced, beginning with serial number 231. Both aircraft performance and payload were improved by fitting more powerful PT6A-27 engines. This was a engine that was flat rated to for use in the Series 300 Twin Otter. The Series 300 proved to be the most successful variant by far, with 614 Series 300 aircraft and their subvariants (Series 310 for United Kingdom operators, Series 320 for Australian operators, etc.) sold before production in Toronto by de Havilland Canada ended in 1988.

In 1972, its unit cost was US$680,000,
In 1976, a new -300 would have cost $700,000 ($ million 31 years later) and is still worth more than $2.5 million in 2018 despite the -400 introduction, many years after the -300 production ceased. 844 had been produced by the time the first production end run ended in 1988.

===New production===

After Series 300 production ended, the remaining tooling was purchased by Viking Air of Victoria, British Columbia, which manufactures replacement parts for out-of-production de Havilland Canada aircraft. On 24 February 2006, Viking purchased the type certificates from Bombardier Aviation for all out-of-production de Havilland Canada aircraft (DHC-1 through DHC-7). The ownership of the certificates gives Viking the exclusive right to manufacture new aircraft.

On 17 July 2006, at the Farnborough Airshow, Viking Air announced its intention to offer a Series 400 Twin Otter. On 2 April 2007, Viking announced that with 27 orders and options in hand, it was restarting production of the Twin Otter, equipped with more powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-34 engines. As of November 2007, 40 firm orders and 10 options had been taken and a new final assembly plant was established in Calgary, Alberta. Zimex Aviation of Switzerland received the first new production aircraft, serial number 845, in July 2010. By mid-2014, Viking had built 55 new aircraft at its Calgary facility. The production rate as of summer 2014 was about 24 aircraft per year. In April 2015, Viking announced a reduction of the production rate to 18 aircraft per year. On 17 June 2015, Viking announced a partnership with a Chinese firm, Reignwood Aviation Group; the group would purchase 50 aircraft and become the exclusive supplier of new Series 400 Twin Otters in China.

Major changes introduced with the Series 400 include Honeywell Primus Apex fully integrated avionics, deletion of the AC electrical system, modernization of the electrical and lighting systems, and use of composites for non load-bearing structures such as doors.

The 100th Series 400 Twin Otter (MSN 944) was displayed at the July 2017 EAA AirVenture Oshkosh. At the time 38% were operated as regional airliners, 31% were in military aviation use, 26% in industrial support and 5% were in private air charter. Seventy were on regular landing gear wheels, 18 were configured as straight or amphibious floatplanes, 10 had tundra tires and two had wheel skis.

In 2019, Viking started making plastic components for the Twin Otter by 3D printer to help reduce cost.
Twin Otter production was suspended in 2019 during the COVID-19 pandemic. In July 2022, DHC announced that it was reviewing the program and supply chain, with a decision on when to resume production expected &quot;in the near future&quot;.
In 2023, its equipped price was $7.25M.

In June 2023 Viking, now operating as De Havilland Canada started production of new DHC-6 Classic 300-G.

==Operational history==



Twin Otters could be delivered directly from the factory with floats, skis, or tricycle landing gear fittings, making them adaptable bush planes for remote and northern areas. Areas including Canada and the United States, (specifically Alaska) had much of the demand. Many Twin Otters still serve in the Arctic and subarctic, but they can also be found in Africa, Australia, Asia, Antarctica, and other regions where bush planes are the optimum means of travel. Their versatility and manoeuvrability have made them popular in areas with difficult flying environments such as Papua New Guinea. In Norway, the Twin Otter paved the way for the network of short-field airports, connecting rural areas with larger towns. The Twin Otter showed outstanding reliability, and remained in service until 2000 on certain routes. Widerøe of Norway was, at one time, the world&#x27;s largest operator of Twin Otters. During one period of its tenure in Norway, the Twin Otter fleet achieved over 96,000 cycles (take-off, flight, and landing) per year.

A number of commuter airlines in the United States got their start by operating Twin Otters in scheduled passenger operations. Houston Metro Airlines (which later changed its name to Metro Airlines) constructed their own STOLport airstrip with a passenger terminal and maintenance hangar in Clear Lake City, Texas, near the Johnson Space Center. The Clear Lake City STOLport was specifically designed for Twin Otter operations. According to the February 1976 edition of the &quot;Official Airline Guide&quot;, Houston Metro operated 22 round-trip flights every weekday at this time between Clear Lake City (CLC) and Houston Intercontinental Airport, now George Bush Intercontinental Airport, in a scheduled passenger airline shuttle operation. Houston Metro had agreements in place for connecting passenger feed services with Continental Airlines and Eastern Air Lines at Houston Intercontinental, with this major airport having a dedicated STOL landing area at the time specifically for Twin Otter flight operations. The Clear Lake City STOLport is no longer in existence.

The Walt Disney World resort in Florida was also served with scheduled airline flights operated with Twin Otter aircraft. The Walt Disney World Airport, also known as the Lake Buena Vista STOLport, was a private airfield constructed by The Walt Disney Company with Twin Otter operations in mind. In the early 1970s, Shawnee Airlines operated scheduled Twin Otter flights between the Disney resort and nearby Orlando Jetport, now Orlando International Airport, as well as to Tampa International Airport. This service by Shawnee Airlines is mentioned in the &quot;Air Commuter Section&quot; of the 6 September 1972 Eastern Air Lines system timetable as a connecting service to and from Eastern flights. This STOL airfield is no longer in use.

Another commuter airline in the United States, Rocky Mountain Airways, operated Twin Otters from the Lake County Airport in Leadville, Colorado. At an elevation of above mean sea level, this airport is the highest airfield in the United States ever to have received scheduled passenger airline service, thus demonstrating the wide-ranging flight capabilities of the Twin Otter. Rocky Mountain Airways went on to become the worldwide launch customer for the larger, four-engine de Havilland Canada Dash 7 STOL turboprop, but continued to operate the Twin Otter, as well.

Larger scheduled passenger airlines based in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and Australia, particularly jetliner operators, also flew Twin Otters, with the aircraft providing connecting feeder service for these airlines. Jet aircraft operators which also flew the Twin Otter included Aeronaves de Mexico, Air BC, Alaska Airlines, ALM Antillean Airlines, Ansett Airlines, Cayman Airways, Frontier Airlines, LIAT, Norcanair, Nordair, Ozark Air Lines, Pacific Western Airlines, Quebecair, South Pacific Island Airways, Time Air, Transair, Trans Australia Airlines (TAA), Wardair and Wien Air Alaska. In many cases, the excellent operating economics of the Twin Otter allowed airlines large and small to provide scheduled passenger flights to communities that most likely would otherwise never have received air service.

Twin Otters are also a staple of Antarctic transportation. Four Twin Otters are employed by the British Antarctic Survey on research and supply flights, and several are employed by the United States Antarctic Program via contract with Kenn Borek Air. On 24–25 April 2001, two Twin Otters performed the first winter flight to Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station to perform a medical evacuation.

On 21–22 June 2016, Kenn Borek Air&#x27;s Twin Otters performed the third winter evacuation flight to Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station to remove two people for medical reasons.

The Argentine Air Force has used the Twin Otter in Antarctica since the 1970s, with at least one of them deployed year-round at Marambio Base. The Chilean Air Force has operated the type since 1980, usually having an example based at Presidente Frei Antarctic base of the South Shetland Islands.

Alfredo Stroessner, Paraguayan head of state from 1954 until 1989, used a Twin Otter as a presidential aircraft; although the Twin Otter remained in the Paraguayan Air Force inventory after he was deposed, subsequent presidents switched to other, private aircraft for official duties.

As of August 2006, a total of 584 Twin Otter aircraft (all variants) remained in service worldwide. Major operators at the time included: Libyan Arab Airlines, Maldivian Air Taxi, Trans Maldivian Airways, Kenn Borek Air, and Grand Canyon Scenic Airlines. Some 115 airlines operated smaller numbers of the aircraft including Yeti Airlines in Nepal, Malaysia Airlines (which used the Twin Otter exclusively for passenger and freight transportation to the Kelabit Highlands region in Sarawak), and in the United Kingdom, the Scottish airline, Loganair which uses the aircraft to service the island of Barra in the Outer Hebrides. This daily scheduled service is unique as the aircraft lands on the beach and the schedule is partly influenced by the tide tables. Trials at Barra Airport with heavier planes than the Twin Otter, like the Short 360, failed because they sank in the sand. The Twin Otter is also used for landing at Juancho E. Yrausquin Airport, the world&#x27;s shortest commercial runway, on the Caribbean island of Saba, Netherlands Antilles.

The Twin Otter has been popular with commercial skydiving operations. It can carry up to 22 skydivers to over (a large load compared to most other aircraft in the industry); presently, the Twin Otter is used in skydiving operations in many countries. The United States Air Force operates three Twin Otters for the United States Air Force Academy&#x27;s skydiving team.

On 26 April 2001, the first ever air rescue during polar winter from the South Pole occurred with a ski-equipped Twin Otter operated by Kenn Borek Air.

On 25 September 2008, the Series 400 Technology Demonstrator achieved &quot;power on&quot; status in advance of an official rollout. The first flight of the Series 400 technical demonstrator, C-FDHT, took place 1 October 2008, at Victoria International Airport.

Two days later, the aircraft departed Victoria, British Columbia for a ferry flight to Orlando, Florida, site of the 2008 National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) Conference and exhibition. The first new build Series 400 Twin Otter (SN 845) made its first flight on 16 February 2010, in Calgary, Alberta. Transport Canada presented Viking Air Limited with an amended DHC-6 Type Certificate including the Series 400 on 21 July 2010. Six years after, in July 2016, 100 series 400 have been delivered to 34 customers operating in 29 countries.

In June 2017, 125 have been made since restarting production in 2010.
