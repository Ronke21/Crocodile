<doc id="711405" wikidata="Q56593" url="?curid=711405" title="Levantine Arabic">
<text>Levantine Arabic, also called Shami (autonym: or ), is an Arabic variety spoken in the Levant, namely in Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel and southern Turkey (historically only in Adana, Mersin and Hatay provinces). With over 60 million speakers, Levantine is, alongside Egyptian, one of the two prestige varieties of spoken Arabic comprehensible all over the Arab world.

Levantine is not officially recognized in any state or territory. Although it is the majority language in Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, and Syria, it is predominantly used as a spoken vernacular in daily communication, whereas most written and official documents and media in these countries use the official Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), a form of literary Arabic only acquired through formal education that does not function as a native language. In Israel and Turkey, Levantine is a minority language.

The Palestinian dialect is lexically the closest vernacular Arabic variety to MSA, with about 50% of common words. Nevertheless, Levantine and MSA are not mutually intelligible. Levantine speakers therefore often call their language  , &#x27;slang&#x27;, &#x27;dialect&#x27;, or &#x27;colloquial&#x27;. With the emergence of social media, attitudes toward Levantine have improved. The amount of written Levantine has significantly increased, especially online, where Levantine is written using Arabic, Latin, or Hebrew characters. Levantine pronunciation varies greatly along social, ethnic, and geographical lines. Its grammar is similar to that shared by most vernacular varieties of Arabic. Its lexicon is overwhelmingly Arabic, with a significant Aramaic influence.

The lack of written sources in Levantine makes it impossible to determine its history before the modern period. Aramaic was the dominant language in the Levant starting in the 1st millennium BCE; it coexisted with other languages, including many Arabic dialects spoken by various Arab tribes. With the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 7th century, new Arabic speakers from the Arabian Peninsula settled in the area, and a lengthy language shift from Aramaic to vernacular Arabic occurred.

== Naming and classification ==

Scholars use &quot;Levantine Arabic&quot; to describe the continuum of mutually intelligible dialects spoken across the Levant. Other terms include &quot;Syro-Palestinian&quot;, &quot;Eastern Arabic&quot;, &quot;East Mediterranean Arabic&quot;, &quot;Syro-Lebanese&quot; (as a broad term covering Jordan and Palestine as well), &quot;Greater Syrian&quot;, or &quot;Syrian Arabic&quot; (in a broad meaning, referring to all the dialects of Greater Syria, which corresponds to the Levant). Most authors only include sedentary dialects, excluding Bedouin dialects of the Syrian Desert and the Negev, which belong to the dialects of the Arabian Peninsula. Mesopotamian dialects from northeast Syria are also excluded. Other authors include Bedouin varieties.

The term &quot;Levantine Arabic&quot; is not indigenous and, according to linguists Kristen Brustad and Emilie Zuniga, &quot;it is likely that many speakers would resist the grouping on the basis that the rich phonological, morphological and lexical variation within the Levant carries important social meanings and distinctions.&quot; Levantine speakers often call their language , &#x27;slang&#x27;, &#x27;dialect&#x27;, or &#x27;colloquial&#x27; (), to contrast it to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Classical Arabic ( , ). They also call their spoken language , &#x27;Arabic&#x27;. Alternatively, they identify their language by the name of their country. can refer to Damascus Arabic, Syrian Arabic, or Levantine as a whole. Lebanese literary figure Said Akl led a movement to recognize the &quot;Lebanese language&quot; as a distinct prestigious language instead of MSA.

Levantine is a variety of Arabic, a Semitic language. There is no consensus regarding the genealogical position of Arabic within the Semitic languages. The position of Levantine and other Arabic vernaculars in the Arabic macrolanguage family has also been contested. According to the Arabic tradition, Classical Arabic was the spoken language of the pre-Islamic and Early Islamic periods and remained stable until today&#x27;s MSA. According to this view, all Arabic vernaculars, including Levantine, descend from Classical Arabic and were corrupted by contacts with other languages. Several Arabic varieties are closer to other Semitic languages and maintain features not found in Classical Arabic, indicating that these varieties cannot have developed from Classical Arabic. Thus, Arabic vernaculars are not a modified version of the Classical language, which is a sister language rather than their direct ancestor. Classical Arabic and vernacular varieties all developed from an unattested common ancestor, Proto-Arabic. The ISO 639-3 standard classifies Levantine as a language, member of the macrolanguage Arabic.

Sedentary vernaculars (also called dialects) are traditionally classified into five groups according to shared features: Peninsular, Mesopotamian, Levantine, Egyptian, and Maghrebi. The linguistic distance between these vernaculars is at least as large as between Germanic languages or Romance languages. It is, for instance, extremely difficult for Moroccans and Iraqis, each speaking their own variety, to understand each other. Levantine and Egyptian are the two prestige varieties of spoken Arabic; they are also the most widely understood dialects in the Arab world and the most commonly taught to non-native speakers outside the Arab world.

== Geographical distribution and varieties ==
=== Dialects ===
Levantine is spoken in the fertile strip on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean: from the Turkish coastal provinces of Adana, Hatay, and Mersin in the north to the Negev, passing through Lebanon, the coastal regions of Syria (Latakia and Tartus governorates) as well as around Aleppo and Damascus, the Hauran in Syria and Jordan, the rest of western Jordan, Palestine and Israel. Other Arabic varieties border it: Mesopotamian and North Mesopotamian Arabic to the north and north-east; Najdi Arabic to the east and south-east; and Northwest Arabian Arabic to the south and south-west.

The similarity among Levantine dialects transcends geographical location and political boundaries. The urban dialects of the main cities (such as Damascus, Beirut, and Jerusalem) have much more in common with each other than they do with the rural dialects of their respective countries. The sociolects of two different social or religious groups within the same country may also show more dissimilarity with each other than when compared with their counterparts in another country.

The process of linguistic homogenization within each country of the Levant makes a classification of dialects by country possible today. Linguist Kees Versteegh classifies Levantine into three groups: Lebanese/Central Syrian (including Beirut, Damascus, Druze Arabic, Cypriot Maronite), North Syrian (including Aleppo), and Palestinian/Jordanian. He writes that distinctions between these groups are unclear, and isoglosses cannot determine the exact boundary.


The dialect of Aleppo shows Mesopotamian influence. The prestige dialect of Damascus is the most documented Levantine dialect. A &quot;common Syrian Arabic&quot; is emerging. Similarly, a &quot;Standard Lebanese Arabic&quot; is emerging, combining features of Beiruti Arabic (which is not prestigious) and Jabale Arabic, the language of Mount Lebanon. In Çukurova, Turkey, the local dialect is endangered. Bedouin varieties are spoken in the Negev and the Sinai Peninsula, areas of transition between Levantine and Egyptian. The dialect of Arish, Egypt, is classified by Linguasphere as Levantine. The Amman dialect is emerging as an urban standard in Jordanian Arabic, while other Jordanian and Palestinian Arabic dialects include &quot;Fellahi&quot; (rural) and &quot;Madani&quot; (urban). The Gaza dialect contains features of both urban Palestinian and Bedouin Arabic.

=== Ethnicity and religion ===
The Levant is characterized by ethnic diversity and religious pluralism. Levantine dialects vary along sectarian lines. Religious groups include Sunni Muslims, Shia Muslims, Alawites, Christians, Druze, and Jews. Differences between Muslim and Christian dialects are minimal, mainly involving some religious vocabulary. A minority of features are perceived as typically associated with one group. For example, in Beirut, the exponent is only used by Muslims and never by Christians who use . Contrary to others, Druze and Alawite dialects retained the phoneme . MSA influences Sunni dialects more. Jewish dialects diverge more from Muslim dialects and often show influences from other towns due to trade networks and contacts with other Jewish communities. For instance, the Jewish dialect of Hatay is very similar to the Aleppo dialect, particularly the dialect of the Jews of Aleppo. It shows traits otherwise not found in any dialect of Hatay. Koineization in cities such as Damascus leads to a homogenization of the language among religious groups. In contrast, the marginalization of Christians in Jordan intensifies linguistic differences between Christian Arabs and Muslims.

Levantine is primarily spoken by Arabs. It is also spoken as a first or second language by several ethnic minorities. In particular, it is spoken natively by Samaritans and by most Circassians in Jordan, Armenians in Jordan and Israel, Assyrians in Israel, Turkmen in Syria and Lebanon, Kurds in Lebanon, and Dom people in Jerusalem. Most Christian and Muslim Lebanese people in Israel speak Lebanese Arabic. Syrian Jews, Lebanese Jews, and Turkish Jews from Çukurova are native Levantine speakers; however, most moved to Israel after 1948. Levantine was spoken natively by most Jews in Jerusalem, but the community shifted to Modern Hebrew after the establishment of Israel. Levantine is the second language of Dom people across the Levant, Circassians in Israel, Armenians in Lebanon, Chechens in Jordan, Assyrians in Syria and Lebanon, and most Kurds in Syria.

=== Speakers by country ===
In addition to the Levant, where it is indigenous, Levantine is spoken among diaspora communities from the region, especially among the Palestinian, Lebanese, and Syrian diasporas. The language has fallen into disuse among subsequent diaspora generations, such as the 7 million Lebanese Brazilians.

== History ==
=== Pre-Islamic antiquity ===
Starting in the 1st millennium BCE, Aramaic was the dominant spoken language and the language of writing and administration in the Levant. Greek was the language of administration of the Seleucid Empire (in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE) and was maintained by the Roman (64 BCE–475 CE), then Byzantine (476–640) empires. From the early 1st millennium BCE until the 6th century CE, there was a continuum of Central Semitic languages in the Arabian Peninsula, and Central Arabia was home to languages quite distinct from Arabic.

Because there are no written sources, the history of Levantine before the modern period is unknown. Old Arabic was a dialect continuum stretching from the southern Levant (where Northern Old Arabic was spoken) to the northern Hijaz, in the Arabian Peninsula, where Old Hijazi was spoken. In the early 1st century CE, a great variety of Arabic dialects were already spoken by various nomadic or semi-nomadic Arabic tribes in the Levant, such as the Nabataeans—who used Aramaic for official purposes, the Tanukhids, and the Ghassanids. These dialects were local, coming from the Hauran—and not from the Arabian Peninsula— and related to later Classical Arabic. Initially restricted to the steppe, Arabic-speaking nomads started to settle in cities and fertile areas after the Plague of Justinian in 542 CE. These Arab communities stretched from the southern extremities of the Syrian Desert to central Syria, the Anti-Lebanon Mountains, and the Beqaa Valley.&lt;ref name=&quot;EALL Aramaic/Syriac Loanwords&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Muslim conquest of the Levant ===
The Muslim conquest of the Levant (634–640) brought new groups of Arabic speakers from the Arabian Peninsula who settled in the Levant. Arabic became the language of trade and public life in cities, while Western Aramaic languages continued to be spoken at home and in the countryside. Arabic gradually replaced early Medieval Greek as the language of administration in 700 by order of the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan. The language shift from Aramaic to vernacular Arabic was a long process over several generations, with an extended period of multilingualism, especially among non-Muslims. Christians continued to speak Syriac for about two centuries, and Syriac remained their literary language until the 14th century. In its spoken form, Aramaic nearly disappeared, except for a few Western Neo-Aramaic-speaking villages, but it has left substrate influences on Levantine.

Different Peninsular Arabic dialects competed for prestige in the Levant, including the Old Hijazi Arabic of the Umayyad elites. These Peninsular dialects mixed with ancient Levantine forms of Arabic. By the mid-6th century, the Petra papyri show that the onset of the article and its vowel seem to have weakened. The article is sometimes written as /el-/ or simply /l-/. A similar, but not identical, situation is found in the texts from the Islamic period. Unlike the pre-Islamic attestations, the coda of the article in &#x27;conquest Arabic&#x27; assimilates to a following coronal consonant. According to Pr. Simon Hopkins, this document shows that there is &quot;a very impressive continuity in colloquial Arabic usage, and the roots of the modern vernaculars are thus seen to lie very deep&quot;.

=== Medieval and early modern era ===
The Damascus Psalm Fragment, dated to the 9th century but possibly earlier, sheds light on the Damascus dialect of that period. Because its Arabic text is written in Greek characters, it reveals the pronunciation of the time; it features many examples of imāla (the fronting and raising of toward ). It also features a pre-grammarian standard of Arabic and the dialect from which it sprung, likely Old Hijazi. Scholars disagree on the dates of phonological changes. The shift of interdental spirants to dental stops dates to the 9th to 10th centuries or earlier. The shift from to a glottal stop is dated between the 11th and 15th centuries. Imāla seems already important in pre-Islamic times.

Swedish orientalist writes about the vulgarisms encountered in Damascene poet Usama ibn Munqidh&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs&quot;: &quot;All of them are found in today&#x27;s spoken language of Syria and it is very interesting to note that that language is, on the whole, not very different from the language of ˀUsāma&#x27;s days&quot;, in the 12th century. Lucas Caballero&#x27;s &quot;Compendio&quot; (1709) describes spoken Damascene Arabic in the early 1700s. It corresponds to modern Damascene in some respects, such as the allomorphic variation between -&quot;a&quot;/-&quot;e&quot; in the feminine suffix. On the contrary, the insertion and deletion of vowels differ from the modern dialect.

From 1516 to 1918, the Ottoman Empire dominated the Levant. Many Western words entered Arabic through Ottoman Turkish as it was the main language for transmitting Western ideas into the Arab world.

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
The dissolution of the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century reduced the use of Turkish words due to Arabization and the negative perception of the Ottoman era among Arabs. With the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon (1920–1946), the British protectorate over Jordan (1921–1946), and the British Mandate for Palestine (1923–1948), French and English words gradually entered Levantine Arabic. Similarly, Modern Hebrew has significantly influenced the Palestinian dialect of Arab Israelis since the establishment of Israel in 1948. In the 1960s, Said Akl—inspired by the Maltese and Turkish alphabets— designed a new Latin alphabet for Lebanese and promoted the official use of Lebanese instead of MSA, but this movement was unsuccessful.

Although Levantine dialects have remained stable over the past two centuries, in cities such as Amman and Damascus, language standardization occurs through variant reduction and linguistic homogenization among the various religious groups and neighborhoods. Urbanization and the increasing proportion of youth constitute the causes of dialect change. Urban forms are considered more prestigious, and prestige dialects of the capitals are replacing the rural varieties. With the emergence of social media, the amount of written Levantine has also significantly increased online.

== Status and usage ==
=== Diglossia and code-switching ===
Levantine is not recognized in any state or territory. MSA is the sole official language in Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, and Syria; it has a &quot;special status&quot; in Israel under the Basic Law. French is also recognized in Lebanon. In Turkey, the only official language is Turkish. Any variation from MSA is considered a &quot;dialect&quot; of Arabic. As in the rest of the Arab world, this linguistic situation has been described as diglossia: MSA is nobody&#x27;s first acquired language; it is learned through formal instruction rather than transmission from parent to child. This diglossia has been compared to the use of Latin as the sole written, official, liturgical, and literary language in Europe during the medieval period, while Romance languages were the spoken languages. Levantine and MSA are mutually unintelligible. They differ significantly in their phonology, morphology, lexicon and syntax.

MSA is the language of literature, official documents, and formal written media (newspapers, instruction leaflets, school books). In spoken form, MSA is mostly used when reading from a scripted text (e.g., news bulletins) and for prayer and sermons in the mosque or church. In Israel, Hebrew is the language used in the public sphere, except internally among the Arab communities. Levantine is the usual medium of communication in all other domains.

Traditionally in the Arab world, colloquial varieties, such as Levantine, have been regarded as corrupt forms of MSA, less eloquent and not fit for literature, and thus looked upon with disdain. Because the French and the British emphasized vernaculars when they colonized the Arab world, dialects were also seen as a tool of colonialism and imperialism. Writing in the vernacular has been controversial because pan-Arab nationalists consider that this might divide the Arab people into different nations. On the other hand, Classical Arabic is seen as &quot;the language of the Quran&quot; and revered by Muslims who form the majority of the population. It is believed to be pure and everlasting, and Islamic religious ideology considers vernaculars to be inferior. Until recently, the use of Levantine in formal settings or written form was often ideologically motivated, for instance in opposition to pan-Arabism. Language attitudes are shifting, and using Levantine became de-ideologized for most speakers by the late 2010s. Levantine is now regarded in a more positive light, and its use in informal modes of writing is acknowledged, thanks to its recent widespread use online in both written and spoken forms.

Code-switching between Levantine, MSA, English, French (in Lebanon and among Arab Christians in Syria), and Hebrew (in Israel) is frequent among Levantine speakers, in both informal and formal settings (such as on television). Gordon cites two Lebanese examples: &quot;Bonjour, ya habibti, how are you?&quot; (&quot;Hello, my love, how are you?&quot;) and &quot;Oui, but leish?&quot; (&quot;Yes, but why?&quot;). Code-switching also happens in politics. For instance, not all politicians master MSA in Lebanon, so they rely on Lebanese. Many public and formal speeches and most political talk shows are in Lebanese instead of MSA. In Israel, Arabic and Hebrew are allowed in the Knesset, but Arabic is rarely used. MK Ahmad Tibi often adds Palestinian Arabic sentences to his Hebrew speech but only gives partial speeches in Arabic.

=== Education ===
In the Levant, MSA is the only variety authorized for use in schools, although in practice, lessons are often taught in a mix of MSA and Levantine with, for instance, the lesson read out in MSA and explained in Levantine. In Lebanon, about 50% of school students study in French. In most Arab universities, the medium of instruction is MSA in social sciences and humanities, and English or French in the applied and medical sciences. In Syria, only MSA is used. In Turkey, article 42.9 of the Constitution prohibits languages other than Turkish from being taught as a mother tongue and almost all indigenous Arabic speakers are illiterate in the Arabic script unless they have learned it for religious purposes.

In Israel, MSA is the only language of instruction in Arab schools. Hebrew is studied as a second language by all Palestinian students from at least the second grade and English from the third grade. In Jewish schools, in 2012, 23,000 pupils were studying spoken Palestinian in 800 elementary schools. Palestinian Arabic is compulsory in Jewish elementary schools in the Northern District; otherwise, Jewish schools teach MSA. Junior high schools must teach all students MSA, but only two-thirds meet this obligation. At all stages in 2012, 141,000 Jewish students were learning Arabic. In 2020, 3.7% of Jewish students took the Bagrut exam in MSA.

=== Films and music ===
Most films and songs are in vernacular Arabic. Egypt was the most influential center of Arab media productions (movies, drama, TV series) during the 20th century, but Levantine is now competing with Egyptian. As of 2013, about 40% of all music production in the Arab world was in Lebanese. Lebanese television is the oldest and largest private Arab broadcast industry. Most big-budget pan-Arab entertainment shows are filmed in the Lebanese dialect in the studios of Beirut. Moreover, the Syrian dialect dominates in Syrian TV series (such as &quot;Bab Al-Hara&quot;) and in the dubbing of Turkish television dramas (such as &quot;Noor&quot;), famous across the Arab world.

, most Arabic satellite television networks use colloquial varieties in their programs, except news bulletins in MSA. The use of vernacular in broadcasting started in Lebanon during the Lebanese Civil War and expanded to the rest of the Arab world. In 2009, Al Jazeera used MSA only and Al Arabiya and Al-Manar used MSA or a hybrid between MSA and colloquial for talk shows. On the popular Lebanese satellite channel Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation International (LBCI), Arab and international news bulletins are only in MSA, while the Lebanese national news broadcast is in a mix of MSA and Lebanese Arabic.

=== Written media ===
Levantine is seldom written, except for some novels, plays, and humorous writings. Most Arab critics do not acknowledge the literary dignity of prose in dialect. Prose written in Lebanese goes back to at least 1892 when Tannus al-Hurr published , &#x27;The tale of the drunken youth, or The story of Nassur the Drunkard&#x27;. In the 1960s, Said Akl led a movement in Lebanon to replace MSA as the national and literary language, and a handful of writers wrote in Lebanese. Foreign works, such as La Fontaine&#x27;s &quot;Fables&quot;, were translated into Lebanese using Akl&#x27;s alphabet. The Gospel of Mark was published in Palestinian in 1940, followed by the Gospel of Matthew and the Letter of James in 1946. The four gospels were translated in Lebanese using Akl&#x27;s alphabet in 1996 by Gilbert Khalifé. Muris &#x27;Awwad translated the four gospels and &quot;The Little Prince&quot; in 2001 in Lebanese in Arabic script. &quot;The Little Prince&quot; was also translated into Palestinian and published in two biscriptal editions (one Arabic/Hebrew script, one Arabic/Latin script).

Newspapers usually use MSA and reserve Levantine for sarcastic commentaries and caricatures. Headlines in Levantine are common. The letter to the editor section often includes entire paragraphs in Levantine. Many newspapers also regularly publish personal columns in Levantine, such as , in the weekend edition of &quot;Al-Ayyam&quot;. From 1983 to 1990, Said Akl&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Lebnaan&quot; was published in Lebanese written in the Latin alphabet. Levantine is also commonly used in zajal and other forms of oral poetry. Zajal written in vernacular was published in Lebanese newspapers such as &quot;Al-Mashriq&quot; (&quot;The Levant&quot;, from 1898) and &quot;Ad-Dabbur&quot; (&quot;The Hornet&quot;, from 1925). In the 1940s, five reviews in Beirut were dedicated exclusively to poetry in Lebanese. In a 2013 study, Abuhakema investigated 270 written commercial ads in two Jordanian (&quot;Al Ghad&quot; and &quot;Ad-Dustour&quot;) and two Palestinian (&quot;Al-Quds&quot; and &quot;Al-Ayyam&quot;) daily newspapers. The study concluded that MSA is still the most used variety in ads, although both varieties are acceptable and Levantine is increasingly used.

Most comedies are written in Levantine. In Syria, plays became more common and popular in the 1980s by using Levantine instead of Classical Arabic. Saadallah Wannous, the most renowned Syrian playwright, used Syrian Arabic in his later plays. Comic books, like the Syrian comic strip , are often written in Levantine instead of MSA. In novels and short stories, most authors, such as Arab Israelis and , write the dialogues in their Levantine dialect, while the rest of the text is in MSA. Lebanese authors Elias Khoury (especially in his recent works) and Kahlil Gibran wrote the main narrative in Levantine. Some collections of short stories and anthologies of Palestinian folktales (, &#x27;heritage literature&#x27;) display full texts in dialect. On the other hand, Palestinian children&#x27;s literature is almost exclusively written in MSA.

Internet users in the Arab world communicate with their dialect language (such as Levantine) more than MSA on social media (such as Twitter, Facebook, or in the comments of online newspapers). According to one study, between 12% and 23% of all dialectal Arabic content online was written in Levantine depending on the platform.

== Phonology ==


Levantine phonology is characterized by rich socio-phonetic variations along socio-cultural (gender; religion; urban, rural or Bedouin) and geographical lines. For instance, in urban varieties, interdentals , , and tend to merge to stops or fricatives ~ ; ~ ; and ~ respectively. The Classical Arabic voiceless uvular plosive is pronounced (among Druze), (in most urban centers, especially Beirut, Damascus, and Jerusalem, and in Amman among women), (in Amman among men, in most other Jordanian dialects and in Gaza), or even (in rural Palestinian).

Vowel length is phonemic in Levantine. Vowels often show dialectal or allophonic variations that are socially, geographically, and phonologically conditioned. Diphthongs and are found in some Lebanese dialects, they respectively correspond to long vowels and in other dialects. One of the most distinctive features of Levantine is word-final imāla, a process by which the vowel corresponding to is raised from to , , or even in some dialects. The difference between the short vowel pairs and as well as and is not always phonemic. The vowel quality is usually and in stressed syllables. Vowels in word-final position are shortened. As a result, more short vowels are distinguished.

In the north, stressed and merge. They usually become , but might also be near emphatic consonants. Syrians and Beirutis tend to pronounce both of them as schwa . The long vowel &quot;ā&quot; is pronounced similar to &quot;ē&quot; or even merges with &quot;ē&quot;, when it is not near an emphatic or guttural consonant.

Syllabification and phonotactics are complex, even within a single dialect. Speakers often add a short vowel, called helping vowel or epenthetic vowel, sounding like a short schwa right before a word-initial consonant cluster to break it, as in , &#x27;very good/well&#x27;. They are not considered part of the word and are never stressed. This process of anaptyxis is subject to social and regional variation. They are usually not written. A helping vowel is inserted:
* Before the word, if this word starts with two consonants and is at the beginning of a sentence,
* Between two words, when a word ending in a consonant is followed by a word that starts with two consonants,
* Between two consonants in the same word, if this word ends with two consonants and either is followed by a consonant or is at the end of a sentence.

In the Damascus dialect, word stress falls on the last superheavy syllable (CVːC or CVCC). In the absence of a superheavy syllable:
* if the word is bisyllabic, stress falls on the ,
* if the word contains three or more syllables and none of them is superheavy, then stress falls:
** on the penultimate, if it is heavy (CVː or CVC),
** on the antepenult, if the penultimate is light (CV).

== Orthography and writing systems ==
Until recently, Levantine was rarely written. Brustad and Zuniga report that in 1988, they did not find anything published in Levantine in Syria. By the late 2010s, written Levantine was used in many public venues and on the internet, especially social media. There is no standard Levantine orthography. There have been failed attempts to Latinize Levantine, especially Lebanese. For instance, Said Akl promoted a modified Latin alphabet. Akl used this alphabet to write books and publish a newspaper, &quot;Lebnaan&quot;.

Written communication takes place using a variety of orthographies and writing systems, including Arabic (right-to-left script), Hebrew (right-to-left, used in Israel, especially online among Bedouin, Arab Christians, and Druze), Latin (Arabizi, left-to-right), and a mixture of the three. Arabizi is a non-standard romanization used by Levantine speakers in social media and discussion forums, SMS messaging, and online chat. Arabizi initially developed because the Arabic script was not available or not easy to use on most computers and smartphones; its usage declined after Arabic software became widespread. According to a 2020 survey done in Nazareth, Arabizi &quot;emerged&quot; as a &quot;&#x27;bottom-up&#x27; orthography&quot; and there is now &quot;a high degree of normativization or standardisation in Arabizi orthography.&quot; Among consonants, only five (ج ,ذ ,ض ,ظ ,ق) revealed variability in their Arabizi representation.

A 2012 study found that on the Jordanian forum Mahjoob about one-third of messages were written in Levantine in the Arabic script, one-third in Arabizi, and one-third in English. Another 2012 study found that on Facebook, the Arabic script was dominant in Syria, while the Latin script dominated in Lebanon. Both scripts were used in Palestine, Israel, and Jordan. Several factors affect script choice: formality (the Arabic script is more formal), ethnicity and religion (Muslims use the Arabic script more while Israeli Druze and Bedouins prefer Hebrew characters), age (young use Latin more), education (educated people write more in Latin), and script congruence (the tendency to reply to a post in the same script). Levantine speakers in Turkey use the Latin-based Turkish alphabet.
The Arabic alphabet is always cursive, and letters vary in shape depending on their position within a word. Letters exhibit up to four distinct forms corresponding to an initial, medial (middle), final, or isolated position (IMFI). Only the isolated form is shown in the tables below. In the Arabic script, short vowels are not represented by letters but by diacritics above or below the letters. When Levantine is written with the Arabic script, short vowels are usually only indicated if a word is ambiguous. In the Arabic script, a shadda above a consonant doubles it. In Latin alphabet, the consonant is written twice: , , &#x27;a female teacher&#x27; / , , &#x27;a school&#x27;. Said Akl&#x27;s Latin alphabet uses non-standard characters.

== Grammar ==
VSO and SVO word orders are possible in Levantine. In both cases, the verb precedes the object. SVO is more common in Levantine, while Classical Arabic prefers VSO. Subject-initial order indicates topic-prominent sentences, while verb-initial order indicates subject-prominent sentences. In interrogative sentences, the interrogative particle comes first.

=== Nouns and noun phrases===
Nouns are either masculine or feminine and singular, dual or plural. The dual is formed with the suffix . Most feminine singular nouns end with , pronounced as –a or -e depending on the preceding consonant: -a after guttural () and emphatic consonants (), -e after other consonants. Unlike Classical Arabic, Levantine has no case marking.

Levantine has a definite article, which marks common nouns (i.e. nouns that are not proper nouns) as definite. Its absence marks common nouns as indefinite. The Arabic definite article precedes the noun or adjective and has multiple pronunciations. Its vowel is dropped when the preceding word ends in a vowel. A helping vowel &quot;e&quot; is inserted if the following word begins with a consonant cluster. It assimilates with &quot;sun letters&quot; (consonants that are pronounced with the tip of the tongue). The letter Jeem () is a sun letter for speakers pronouncing it as [] but not for those pronouncing it as [].

For nouns referring to humans, the regular (also called sound) masculine plural is formed with the suffix -īn. The regular feminine plural is formed with -āt. The masculine plural is used to refer to a group with both genders. There are many broken plurals (also called internal plurals), in which the consonantal root of the singular is changed. These plural patterns are shared with other varieties of Arabic and may also be applied to foreign borrowings. Several patterns of broken plurals exist, and it is impossible to predict them exactly. One common pattern is for instance CvCvC =&gt; CuCaCa (e.g.: singular: , &#x27;manager&#x27;; plural: , &#x27;managers&#x27;). Inanimate objects take feminine singular agreement in the plural, for verbs, attached pronouns, and adjectives.

The genitive is formed by putting the nouns next to each other in a construct called &quot;iḍāfah&quot;, . The first noun is always indefinite. If an indefinite noun is added to a definite noun, it results in a new definite compound noun: , &#x27;the book of the teacher&#x27;. Besides possessiveness, the &quot;iḍāfah&quot; can also specify or define the first term. Although there is no limit to the number of nouns in an &quot;iḍāfah&quot;, it is rare to have three or more. The first term must be in the construct state: if it ends in the feminine marker (/-ah/, or /-ih/), it changes to (/-at/, /-it/) in pronunciation (i.e. pronounced as /t/): , &#x27;New York City&#x27;.

Adjectives typically have three forms: a masculine singular, a feminine singular, and a plural. In most adjectives, the feminine is formed through the addition of -a/e. Many adjectives have the pattern ( / CCīC or / CaCīC), but other patterns exist. Adjectives derived from nouns using the suffix are called nisba adjectives. Their feminine form ends in and their plural in . Nouns in dual have adjectives in plural. The plural of adjectives is either regular ending in or is an irregular &quot;broken&quot; plural. It is used with nouns referring to people. For non-human, inanimate, or abstract nouns, adjectives use either the plural or the singular feminine form regardless of gender.

Adjectives follow the noun they modify and agree with it in definiteness. Adjectives without an article after a definite noun express a clause with the invisible copula &quot;to be&quot;:
* , &#x27;a big house&#x27;
* , &#x27;the big house&#x27;
* , &#x27;the house is big&#x27;

The elative is used for comparison, instead of separate comparative and superlative forms. The elative is formed by adding a hamza at the beginning of the adjective and replacing the vowels by &quot;a&quot; (pattern: / aCCaC, e.g.: , &#x27;big&#x27;; , &#x27;bigger/biggest&#x27;). Adjective endings in (i) and (u) are changed into (a). If the second and third consonant in the root are the same, they are geminated (pattern: / ʾaCaCC). When an elative modifies a noun, it precedes the noun, and no definite article is used.

Levantine does not distinguish between adverbs and adjectives in adverbial function. Almost any adjective can be used as an adverb: , &#x27;good&#x27; vs. , &#x27;Did you sleep well?&#x27;. MSA adverbs, with the suffix -an, are often used, e.g., , &#x27;at all&#x27;. Adverbs often appear after the verb or the adjective. , &#x27;very&#x27; can be positioned after or before the adjective. Adverbs of manner can usually be formed using bi- followed by the nominal form: , &#x27;fast, quickly&#x27;, .

 or in Syrian Arabic negate adjectives (including active participles), demonstratives, and nominal phrases:
* , &#x27;I&#x27;m not Palestinian.&#x27;
* , &#x27;She doesn&#x27;t know.&#x27;
* / , &#x27;That&#x27;s not good.&#x27;

=== Pronouns ===
Levantine has eight persons and eight pronouns. Contrary to MSA, dual pronouns do not exist in Levantine; the plural is used instead. Because conjugated verbs indicate the subject with a prefix or a suffix, independent subject pronouns are usually unnecessary and mainly used for emphasis. Feminine plural forms modifying human females are found primarily in rural and Bedouin areas. They are not mentioned below.

Direct object pronouns are indicated by suffixes attached to the conjugated verb. Their form depends on whether the verb ends with a consonant or a vowel. Suffixed to nouns, these pronouns express possessive. Levantine does not have the verb &quot;to have&quot;. Instead, possession is expressed using the prepositions , (meaning &quot;to possess&quot;) and , (meaning &quot;to have on oneself&quot;), followed by personal pronoun suffixes.

Indirect object pronouns (dative) are suffixed to the conjugated verb. They are formed by adding an ل (-l) and then the possessive suffix to the verb. They precede object pronouns if present:
* , &#x27;he brought the newspaper to my father&#x27;,
* , &#x27;he brought it to my father&#x27;,
* , &#x27;he brought him the newspaper&#x27;,
* , &#x27;he brought it to him&#x27;.

Demonstrative pronouns have three referential types: immediate, proximal, and distal. The distinction between proximal and distal demonstratives is of physical, temporal, or metaphorical distance. The genderless and numberless immediate demonstrative article is translated by &quot;this/the&quot;, to designate something immediately visible or accessible.

=== Verbs and verb phrases ===
==== Root and verb forms ====
Most Levantine verbs are based on a triliteral root (also called radical or Semitic root) made of three consonants. The set of consonants communicates the basic meaning of a verb, e.g. k-t-b (&#x27;write&#x27;), q-r- (&#x27;read&#x27;), -k-l (&#x27;eat&#x27;). Changes to the vowels in between the consonants, along with prefixes or suffixes, specify grammatical functions such as tense, person, and number, in addition to changes in the meaning of the verb that embody grammatical concepts such as mood (e.g., indicative, subjunctive, imperative), voice (active or passive), and functions such as causative, intensive, or reflexive. Quadriliteral roots are less common but often used to coin new vocabulary or Arabicize foreign words. The base form is the third-person masculine singular of the perfect (also called past) tense.

Almost all Levantine verbs belong to one of ten verb forms (also called verb measures, stems, patterns, or types). Form I, the most common one, serves as a base for the other nine forms. Each form carries a different verbal idea relative to the meaning of its root. Technically, ten verbs can be constructed from any given triconsonantal root, although not all of these forms are used. After Form I, Forms II, V, VII, and X are the most common. Some irregular verbs do not fit into any of the verb forms.

In addition to its form, each verb has a &quot;quality&quot;:
* Sound (or regular): 3 distinct radicals, neither the second nor the third is &#x27;w&#x27; or &#x27;y&#x27;,
* Verbs containing the radicals &#x27;w&#x27; or &#x27;y&#x27; are called weak. They are either:
** Hollow: verbs with &#x27;w&#x27; or &#x27;y&#x27; as the second radical, which becomes a long &#x27;a&#x27; in some forms, or
** Defective: verbs with &#x27;w&#x27; or &#x27;y&#x27; as the third radical, treated as a vowel,
* Geminate (or doubled): the second and third radicals are identical, remaining together as a double consonant.

==== Regular verb conjugation ====

The Levantine verb has only two tenses: past (perfect) and present (also called imperfect, b-imperfect, or bi-imperfect). The present tense is formed by adding the prefix b- or m- to the verb root. The future tense is an extension of the present tense. The negative imperative is the same as the negative present with helping verb (imperfect). Various prefixes and suffixes designate the grammatical person and number as well as the mood. The following table shows the paradigm of a sound Form I verb, , &#x27;to write&#x27;. There is no copula in the present tense in Levantine. In other tenses, the verb is used. Its present tense form is used in the future tense.

The b-imperfect is usually used for the indicative mood (non-past present, habitual/general present, narrative present, planned future actions, or potential). The prefix b- is deleted in the subjunctive mood, usually after modal verbs, auxiliary verbs, pseudo-verbs, prepositions, and particles. The future can also be expressed by the imperfect preceded by the particle or by the prefixed particle . The present continuous is formed with the progressive particle followed by the imperfect, with or without the initial b/m depending on the speaker.

The active participle, also called present participle, is grammatically an adjective derived from a verb. Depending on the context, it can express the present or present continuous (with verbs of motion, location, or mental state), the near future, or the present perfect (past action with a present result). It can also serve as a noun or an adjective. The passive participle, also called past participle, has a similar meaning as in English (i.e., sent, written). It is mainly used as an adjective and sometimes as a noun. It is inflected from the verb based on its verb form. However, passive participles are largely limited to verb forms I (CvCvC) and II (CvCCvC), becoming maCCūC for the former and mCaCCaC for the latter.

==== Compound tenses ====
The verb , followed by another verb, forms compound tenses. Both verbs are conjugated with their subject.

==== Passive voice ====
Form I verbs often correspond to an equivalent passive form VII verb, with the prefix n-. Form II and form III verbs usually correspond to an equivalent passive in forms V and VI, respectively, with the prefix t-. While the verb forms V, VI and VII are common in the simple past and compound tenses, the passive participle (past participle) is preferred in the present tense.

==== Negation ====
Verbs and prepositional phrases are negated by the particle either on its own or, in the south, together with the suffix at the end of the verb or prepositional phrase. In Palestinian, it is also common to negate verbs by the suffix only.

== Vocabulary ==

The lexicon of Levantine is overwhelmingly Arabic, and a large number of Levantine words are shared with at least another vernacular Arabic variety outside the Levant, especially with Egyptian. Many words, such as verbal nouns (also called gerunds or ), are derived from a Semitic root. For instance, , &#x27;a lesson&#x27; is derived from , &#x27;to study, to learn&#x27;. Levantine also includes layers of ancient languages: Aramaic (mainly Western Aramaic), Canaanite, classical Hebrew (Biblical and Mishnaic), Persian, Greek, and Latin.

Aramaic influence is significant, especially in vocabulary and in rural areas. Aramaic words underwent morphophonemic adaptation when they entered Levantine. Over time, it has become difficult to identify them. They belong to different fields of everyday life such as seasonal agriculture, housekeeping, tools and utensils, and Christian religious terms. Aramaic is still spoken in the Syrian villages of Maaloula, al-Sarkha, and Jubb&#x27;adin; near them, Aramaic borrowings are more frequent.

Since the early modern period, Levantine has borrowed from Turkish and European languages, mainly English (particularly in technology and entertainment), French (especially in Lebanese due to the French Mandate), German, and Italian. Modern Hebrew significantly influences the Palestinian dialect spoken by Arab Israelis. Loanwords are gradually replaced with words of Arabic root. For instance, borrowings from Ottoman Turkish that were common in the 20th century have been largely replaced by Arabic words after the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. Arabic-speaking minorities in Turkey (mainly in Hatay) are still influenced by Turkish.

With about 50% of common words, Levantine (especially Palestinian) is the closest colloquial variety to MSA in terms of lexical similarity. In the vocabulary of five-year-old native Palestinians: 40% of the words are not present in MSA, 40% are related to MSA but phonologically different (sound change, addition, or deletion), and 20% are identical to MSA. In terms of morphemes, 20% are identical between MSA and Palestinian Arabic, 30% are strongly overlapping (slightly different forms, same function), 20% are partially overlapping (different forms, same function), and 30% are unique to Palestinian Arabic.

<doc id="711408" wikidata="Q191957" url="?curid=711408" title="Ignacy Jan Paderewski">
<text>Ignacy Jan Paderewski (;  [or 1859] – 29 June 1941) was a Polish pianist, composer and statesman who was a spokesman for Polish independence. In 1919, he was the nation&#x27;s prime minister and foreign minister during which time he signed the Treaty of Versailles, which ended World War I.

A favorite of concert audiences around the world, his musical fame gave him access to diplomacy and the media, as well as, possibly, his status as a freemason, and the charitable work of his second wife, Helena Paderewska. During World War I, Paderewski advocated for an independent Poland, including by touring the United States, where he met President Woodrow Wilson, who came to support the creation of an independent Poland. Wilson included that aim in his Fourteen Points and argued for it at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, which drew up the Treaty of Versailles.

Shortly after his resignation from office, Paderewski resumed his concert career to recoup his finances, and rarely visited the politically chaotic Poland thereafter, the last time being in 1924.

==Early life, marriage and education==
Paderewski was born to Polish parents in the village of Kurilovka, in the Podolia Governorate of the Russian Empire. The village is now part of the Khmilnyk raion of Vinnytsia Oblast in Ukraine. His father, Jan Paderewski, administered large estates. His mother, Poliksena, &quot;née&quot; Nowicka, died several months after Paderewski was born, and he was raised mostly by distant relatives.

From his early childhood, Paderewski was interested in music. He initially lived at a private estate near Zhytomyr, where he had moved with his father. However, soon after his father&#x27;s arrest in connection with the January Uprising of 1863, he was adopted by his aunt. After being released, Paderewski&#x27;s father married again and moved to the town of Sudylkov, near Shepetovka.

Initially, Paderewski took piano lessons with a private tutor. At the age of 12, in 1872, he went to Warsaw and was admitted to the Warsaw Conservatory. Upon graduating in 1878, he became a piano tutor at his &quot;alma mater&quot;. In 1880, Paderewski married a fellow student at the conservatory, Antonina Korsakówna. The next year, their son Alfred was born severely handicapped. Antonina never recovered from childbirth and died several weeks later. Paderewski decided to devote himself to music and left his son in the care of friends and, in 1881, he went to Berlin to study music composition with Friedrich Kiel and Heinrich Urban.

In 1884, a chance meeting with a famous Polish actress, Helena Modjeska, began his career as a virtuoso pianist. Modrzejewska arranged for a public concert and joint appearance in Kraków&#x27;s Hotel Saski to raise funds for Paderewski&#x27;s further piano study. The scheme was a tremendous success and Paderewski soon moved to Vienna, where he studied with Theodor Leschetizky (Teodor Leszetycki). On 31 May 1899, he married his second wife, Helena Paderewska (née von Rosen, 1856–1934), shortly after she received an annulment of a prior marriage. While she had previously cared for his son Alfred (1880–1901), they had no children together.

==Pianist, composer and supporter of new composers==
Paderewski dedicated three more years to diligent study, and a teaching appointment at the conservatory in Strasbourg which Leschetizky arranged. In 1887, he made his concert debut in Vienna, soon gaining great popularity, and had popular successes in Paris in 1889 and in London in 1890. Audiences responded to his brilliant playing with almost extravagant displays of admiration, and Paderewski also gained access to the halls of power. In 1891, he repeated his triumphs on an American tour. He toured the country more than 30 times for the next five decades and it would become his second home. His stage presence, striking looks, and immense charisma contributed to his stage success, which later proved important in his political and charitable activities. His name became synonymous with the highest level of piano virtuosity. Not everyone was equally impressed, however. After hearing Paderewski for the first time, when Paderewski was exhausted from his American tour, Moriz Rosenthal quipped, &quot;Yes, he plays well, I suppose, but he&#x27;s no Paderewski.&quot;

Paderewski kept up a furious pace of touring and composition, including many of his own piano works in his concerts. He also wrote an opera, &quot;Manru&quot;, which had its official premiere in Lviv in 1901. A &quot;lyric drama&quot;, &quot;Manru&quot; is an ambitious work that was formally inspired by Wagner&#x27;s music dramas. It lacks an overture and closed-form arias, but uses Wagner&#x27;s device of &quot;leitmotifs&quot; to represent characters and ideas. The story centres on a doomed love triangle, social inequality, and racial prejudice (Manru is a Gypsy), and is set in the Tatra Mountains. It is still the only opera by a Polish composer that the Metropolitan Opera has performed in its 135-year history. In addition to the Met, a private royal viewing of &quot;Manru&quot; was staged in Dresden, and it was staged in Prague, Cologne, Zürich, Warsaw, Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, Pittsburgh and Baltimore, Moscow, and Kiev.

In 1904, Paderewski, accompanied by his second wife, entourage, parrot, and Érard piano, gave concerts in Australia and New Zealand, in collaboration with Polish-French composer Henri Kowalski. Paderewski toured tirelessly around the world and was the first to give a solo performance at the new 3,000-seat Carnegie Hall. In 1909 came the premiere of his Symphony in B minor &quot;Polonia&quot;, a massive work lasting 75 minutes. Paderewski&#x27;s compositions were quite popular in his lifetime and, for a time, entered the orchestral repertoire, particularly his &quot;Fantaisie polonaise sur des thèmes originaux&quot; (Polish Fantasy on Original Themes) for piano and orchestra, Piano Concerto in A minor, and &quot;Polonia&quot; symphony. His piano miniatures became especially popular, and the Minuet in G major, Op. 14 No. 1, written in the style of Mozart, became one of the most recognized piano tunes of all time. Despite his relentless touring schedule and his political and charitable engagements, Paderewski left a legacy of over 70 orchestral, instrumental, and vocal works.

All of his works evoke a romantic image of Poland. They incorporate references to Polish dances, such as the polonaise, krakowiak, and mazurka, and highlander music (Tatra album [Album tatrzańskie], op. 12, Polish Dances [Tańce polskie], op. 5). Paderewski&#x27;s love of his country is reflected in the titles of his compositions, including Polish Fantasy [Fantazja polska], op. 19 and Symphony in B minor &quot;Polonia&quot;, which includes a quote from Dąbrowski&#x27;s Mazurka [Mazurek Dąbrowskiego]), themes (Manru), and musical settings of quotes from Polish poets (e.g., Asnyk and Mickiewicz).

== Philanthropy ==
In 1896, Paderewski donated US$10,000 to establish a trust fund to encourage American-born composers. The fund underwrote a triennial the Paderewski Prize competition that began in 1901. Paderewski also launched a similar contest in Leipzig in 1898. He was so popular internationally that the music hall duo &quot;The Two Bobs&quot; had a hit song in 1916 in music halls across Britain with the song &quot;When Paderewski Plays&quot;. He was a favorite of concert audiences around the globe and women, especially, admired his performances.

By the turn of the century, Paderewski was an extremely wealthy man, generously donating to numerous causes and charities, and sponsoring monuments, among them the Washington Arch in New York, in 1892. Paderewski shared his fortune generously with fellow countrymen, as well as with citizens and foundations from around the world. He established a foundation for young American musicians and the students of Stanford University (1896), another at the Parisian Conservatory (1909), yet another scholarship fund at the Ecole Normale (1924), funded students of the Moscow Conservatory and the Saint Petersburg Conservatory (1899), as well as spas in the Alps (1928), for the British Legion.

During the Great Depression, Paderewski supported unemployed musicians in the United States (1932) and the unemployed in Switzerland in 1937. He publicly supported an insurance fund for musicians in London (1933) and aided Jewish intellectuals in Paris (1933). He also supported orphanages and the Maternity Centre in New York. The many Paderewski-sponsored concert halls and monuments included Debussy (1931) and Édouard Colonne (1923) monuments in Paris, Liszt Monument in Weimar, Beethoven Monument in Bonn, Chopin Monument in Żelazowa Wola (the composer&#x27;s birthplace), Kosciuszko Monument in Chicago, and Washington Arch in New York.

==California==
In 1913, Paderewski settled in the United States. On the eve of World War I and at the height of his fame, Paderewski bought a 2,000-acre (810-ha) property, Rancho San Ignacio, near Paso Robles, in San Luis Obispo County, in California&#x27;s Central Coast region. A decade later, he planted Petite Sirah and Zinfandel on his vineyard in the Adelaida area and the fruit was processed at the nearby York Mountain Winery, which was, as it still is, one of the best-known wineries between Los Angeles and San Francisco.

==Politician and diplomat==
In 1910, Paderewski funded the Grunwald Monument in Kraków to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the Battle of Grunwald. The monument&#x27;s unveiling led to great patriotic demonstrations. In speaking to the gathered throng, Paderewski proved as adept at capturing their hearts and minds for the political cause as he was with his music. His passionate delivery needed no recourse to notes. Paderewski&#x27;s status as an artist and philanthropist and not as a member of any of the many Polish political factions became one of his greatest assets and so he rose above the quarrels, and he could legitimately appeal to higher ideals of unity, sacrifice, charity, and work for common goals.

In World War I, Paderewski became an active member of the Polish National Committee in Paris, which was soon accepted by the Triple Entente as the representative of the forces trying to create the state of Poland. Paderewski became the committee&#x27;s spokesman, and soon, he and his wife also formed other organizations, including the Polish Relief Fund in London, and the White Cross Society in the United States. Paderewski met the English composer Edward Elgar, who used a theme from Paderewski&#x27;s &quot;Fantasie Polonaise&quot; in his work &quot;Polonia&quot;, written for the Polish Relief Fund concert in London on 6 July 1916 (the title certainly recognises Paderewski&#x27;s Symphony in B minor).

Paderewski urged fellow Polish immigrants to join the Polish armed forces in France, and pressed elbows with all the dignitaries and influential men whose salons he could enter. He spoke to Americans directly in public speeches and on the radio, appealing to them to remember the fate of his nation. He kept such a demanding schedule of public appearances, fundraisers and meetings that he stopped musical touring altogether for a few years, instead dedicating himself to diplomatic activity. In January 1917, on the eve of the American entry into the war, US President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s main advisor, Colonel House, turned to Paderewski to prepare a memorandum on the Polish situation. Two weeks later, Wilson spoke before Congress and issued a challenge to the status quo: &quot;I take it for granted that statesmen everywhere are agreed that there should be a united, independent, autonomous Poland.&quot; The establishment of &quot;New Poland&quot; became one of Wilson&#x27;s famous Fourteen Points, the principles that Wilson followed during peace negotiations to end World War I. In April 1918, Paderewski met leaders of the American Jewish Committee in New York City, in an unsuccessful attempt to broker a deal in which organised Jewish groups would support Polish territorial ambitions in exchange for support for equal rights. However, it soon became clear that no plan would satisfy both Jewish leaders and Roman Dmowski, the head of the Polish National Committee, who was strongly anti-Semitic.

At the end of the war, with the fate of the city of Poznań and the whole region of Greater Poland (Wielkopolska) still undecided, Paderewski visited Poznań. Following his public speech there on 27 December 1918, the Polish inhabitants of the city began the Greater Poland uprising against Germany.

In 1919, in the newly independent Poland, Józef Piłsudski, who was the Chief of State, appointed Paderewski as the Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland (January 1919 – December 1919). Paderewski and Roman Dmowski represented Poland at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference and dealt with issues regarding territorial claims and minority rights. Paderewski signed the Treaty of Versailles, which recognized Polish independence won after World War I. There were some achievements during Paderewski&#x27;s ten-month period in government: democratic elections to Parliament, the ratification of the Treaty of Versailles, legislation on protection of ethnic minorities in the new state, and the establishment of a public education system. But Paderewski &quot;proved to be a poor administrator and worse politician&quot; and resigned from the Government in December 1919, having received criticism for his perceived submissiveness to the Western powers. At the request of his successor as Prime Minister, Władysław Grabski, Paderewski represented Poland at the Spa Conference, when Poland was threatened by the Polish–Soviet War, but Piłsudski&#x27;s success at the Battle of Warsaw later that year rendered those negotiations redundant, and put to an end Paderewski&#x27;s hopes of regaining office.

==Return to music==
In 1922, Paderewski retired from politics and returned to his musical life. His first concert after a long break, held at Carnegie Hall, was a significant success. He also filled the 20,000-seat Madison Square Garden, and toured the United States in a private railway car.

In 1897, Paderewski had bought the manor house of the former Duchess of Otrante near Morges, Switzerland, where he rested between concert tours. After Piłsudski&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état in 1926, Paderewski became an active member of the opposition to Sanacja rule. In 1936, two years after his second wife&#x27;s death at their Swiss home, a coalition of members of the opposition met in the mansion and was nicknamed the Front Morges after the village.

By 1936, Paderewski agreed to appear in a film that showcased his talent and art. Although the proposal had come while the mourning Paderewski avoided public appearances, the film project went ahead. It became notable, primarily, for its rare footage of his piano performance. The exiled German-born director, Lothar Mendes, directed the feature, which was released in Britain in 1937 as &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot;, and was re-titled &quot;The Charmer&quot; when re-released in the US in 1943.

In November 1937, Paderewski agreed to take on one last piano student. The musician was Witold Małcużyński, who had won third place at the International Chopin Piano Competition.

==Return to public life==
After the invasion of Poland in 1939, Paderewski returned to public life. In 1940, he became the head of the National Council of Poland, a Polish sejm (parliament) in exile in London. He again turned to America for help and his broadcast was carried by over 100 radio stations in the United States and Canada. He advocated in person for aid to Europe and the defeat of Nazism.

In 1941, Paderewski witnessed a touching tribute to his artistry and humanitarianism as US cities celebrated the 50th anniversary of his first American tour by putting on a Paderewski Week, with over 6000 concerts in his honour. The 80-year-old artist also restarted his Polish Relief Fund and gave several concerts to gather money for it. However, his mind was not what it had once been and, scheduled again to play Madison Square Garden, he refused to appear, insisting that he had already played the concert, presumably remembering his performance there in the 1920s.

==Death and legacy==
Paderewski fell ill on tour on 27 June 1941. Sylwin Strakacz bypassed his secretary and other tour personnel to summon physicians, who diagnosed pneumonia. Despite signs of improving health and recovery, Paderewski died in New York at 11:00 p.m., 29 June, aged 80. He was temporarily laid in repose in the crypt of the &quot;USS Maine&quot; Mast Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia, near Washington, DC, despite anecdotal accounts that he wished to be buried in France, near his second wife and son.

In 1992, after the end of communist rule in Poland, his remains were transferred to Warsaw and placed in St. John&#x27;s Archcathedral. His heart is encased in a bronze sculpture in the National Shrine of Our Lady of Czestochowa near Doylestown, Pennsylvania.

In early 1941, the music publisher Boosey &amp; Hawkes commissioned 17 prominent composers to contribute a solo piano piece each for an album to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Paderewski&#x27;s American debut in 1891. It became a posthumous tribute to Paderewski&#x27;s entire life and work, &quot;Homage to Paderewski&quot; (1942). As well, Helena Paderewska had prepared a memoir of her husband&#x27;s political activities between 1910 and 1920, the typescript of which was not published in either of their lifetimes but was discovered in 2015 by an archivist at the Hoover Institution and published.

Paderewski is credited as the chief editor of the edition of Chopin&#x27;s complete works published by the Instytut Fryderyka Chopina, but he died before the work began.

===Museum displays===
The Polish Museum of America in Chicago received a donation of his personal possessions after his death in June 1941. Both Ignacy Paderewski and his sister, Antonina Paderewska Wilkonska were enthusiastic supporters and generous sponsors of the Museum. Antonina, executor of Ignacy&#x27;s will, decided to donate the personal possessions to the Museum, as well as artifacts from his apartment in New York. The space was officially opened on 3 November 1941. Another museum in his honour exists at Morges, Switzerland, although Paderewski&#x27;s mansion was razed in 1965.

===Memorials and tributes===

In 1948, the Ignacy Paderewski Foundation was established in New York City, on the initiative of the local Polish community, with the goal of promoting Polish culture in the United States. Two other Polish-American organizations are named in his honour and are dedicated to promoting the legacy of the maestro: the Paderewski Association in Chicago and the Paderewski Music Society in Southern California.

In the Irving Berlin song, &quot;I Love a Piano&quot;, recorded in 1916 by Billy Murray, the narrator says: &quot;And with the pedal, I love to meddle/When Paderewski comes this way./I&#x27;m so delighted, when I&#x27;m invited/To hear that long-haired genius play.&quot;

Charlie Chaplin wrote:

There is an anecdote in circulation about Paderewski having been booked for a concert at Stanford by the future president Hoover and not receiving the full fee for his performance. Thomas F. Schwartz, Director of the Hoover Presidential Library, concludes:
His unusual combination of being a world-class pianist and successful politician led to Saul Kripke using Paderewski as a famous philosophical example in his article &quot;A Puzzle about Belief.&quot; Paderewski was so famous that in the 1953 motion picture &quot;The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.&quot;, written by Theodor Seuss Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, piano teacher Terwilliker tells his pupils that he will &quot;make a Paderewski&quot; out of them.

Two music festivals honouring Paderewski are held in the United States, both in November. The first has been organised each year since 1993, in Paso Robles, California. The second has been held since 2014 in Raleigh, North Carolina.

The facade of White Eagle Hall, in Jersey City, New Jersey, is adorned with busts of Polish heroes Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Casimir Pulaski, Tadeusz Kościuszko and Henryk Sienkiewicz.

A plaque honoring Paderewski can be found in Chicago&#x27;s Wicker Park, near the park&#x27;s fieldhouse. It was in the Wicker Park neighborhood that Paderewski had his headquarters during World War I. The memorial notes that he was declared an honorary citizen of Chicago in 1932.
===Honours and awards===

The Academy of Music in Poznań is named after Paderewski, and many major cities in Poland have streets and schools named after him. Streets are also named after him in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. Since 1960, Paderewski has had a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles.

<text>M-239 is a north–south state trunkline highway in Berrien County in the extreme southwestern corner of the US state of Michigan connecting State Road 39 (SR 39) in Indiana to Interstate 94 (I-94). The highway was designated in 1963, and it provided the only connection from the southern end of I-94 into Indiana until 1972.

==Route description==
As SR 39 crosses into Michigan it becomes M-239. As soon as it crosses the border, the road curves around to the northwest where it continues through a generally rural area. The trunkline intersects Wilson Road and passes next to a commercial development. After a little over a mile (1.8 km), the road comes to its northern terminus at an interchange with I-94 at exit 1. While M-239 officially ends at the interchange, the roadway, known as Harbor Country Drive, continues to the northwest and into New Buffalo, providing access to US Highway 12. Like other state highways in Michigan, M-239 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). In 2011, the department&#x27;s traffic surveys showed that on average, 6,231 vehicles used the highway daily. No section of M-239 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.

==History==
M-239 always ended at I-94, even though Harbor Country Drive continues into New Buffalo. Before completion of the Indiana portion of I-94, the freeway ended at the present exit 1. A stretch of LaPorte Road was designated as M-239 in 1963 to carry traffic to SR 39, which connects to the Indiana Toll Road. Until 1972, when Indiana constructed their section of I-94, M-239 and SR 39 were the only connection from the southern end of I-94 in Michigan across the state line. That year, the highway carried more than 15,000 vehicles a day.

<text>Ascetical theology is the organized study or presentation of spiritual teachings found in Christian Scripture and the Church Fathers that help the faithful to more perfectly follow Christ and attain to Christian perfection. Christian asceticism is commonly thought to imply self-denial for a spiritual purpose. The term &quot;ascetical theology&quot; is used primarily in Roman Catholic theology; Eastern Orthodox theology carries its own distinct terms and definitions (see below), and other religious traditions conceive of following and conforming to God and Christ differently from either Orthodoxy or Catholicism.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;ascetic&quot; is from the Greek word ἄσκησις &quot;askesis&quot;, meaning &quot;practice&quot;. The English term &quot;ascesis&quot; means &quot;the practice of self-discipline&quot;.

== Essential concepts ==
* Dogmatic theology addresses what the religion affirms as truth. It relates to &quot;ascetical theology&quot; by answering the question, what are we following? What do we know about God, our nature, and our redemption? Ascetical theology depends upon dogmatic theology for a foundation. For example, if the religion didn&#x27;t teach that we have a fallen nature, ascetical theology would be premised on an erroneous assumption and may then be unproductive compared to other approaches to God.
* Moral theology addresses how we must behave. It is the behavioral dimension, expounded. Here are developed the implications of the Decalogue, the Sermon on the Mount, and other precepts of the faith. These are especially important for guiding the faithful through the first phases of prayer life, and for being certain one is on the right path: if one believes oneself to be growing in holiness yet still violates the basic precepts of the faith, one is not understanding the process. Moral theology, then, guides the ascetic who strives to live these moral truths that are informed by the dogmas of the religion, and who also seeks also to go beyond moral requirements.
* Mystical theology addresses the aspects of the soul&#x27;s union with God that are specifically not produced by human agency or effort. In the earlier stages of prayer life, &quot;aridities&quot; are experienced, which are moments during which the zeal for prayer seems lessened. In later stages, &quot;passive trials&quot; such as the &quot;dark night of the soul&quot; (St. John of the Cross) are experienced. In these phenomena, God is said to be purifying the soul, making her (the soul is feminine in Catholic theology) continue on the basis of sheer faith rather than any palpable feeling derived from prayer. These and other experiences are studied in mystical theology. Christian dogma does not teach that mystical phenomena are necessary to be granted a place in Heaven.
* The Sacraments (Catholic Church), according to dogmatic theology, both symbolize and confer grace. The two sacraments that are routinely encountered by the faithful are Eucharist and confession. &quot;Grace&quot; is a rather complicated subject; see References below. The Eucharist affords a real and transforming union with God; see for example John 6:58. It is spiritual as well as real, and transformative. For a discussion of the spiritual implications of Eucharist, see historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology. Confession is purifying if the penitent is well-disposed, i.e. sorry for having offended God. It is considered essential to undertake this purifying act before receiving the Eucharist. As one progresses toward union with God, more and more problems within the soul become apparent. Habits that didn&#x27;t seem sinful at first blush suddenly stand out as harmful to charity. Once confessed, new problems emerge. In this way the penitent embarks on a program of purgation, developing greater sensitivity as to what is most conducive to Christian love.
==Catholicism==

Ascetics, as a branch of theology, may be briefly defined as the scientific exposition of Christian asceticism. It has been defined as the theological &quot;science of the spiritual life&quot;, &quot;far behind either from the Dogma or the Moral&quot;, rested on the truths of faith and tensed up to the Christian perfection as &quot;logical outcome of Dogma, especially of the fundamental dogma of the Incarnation&quot;, useful to Religious as to lay-apostolate. Asceticism (&quot;askesis, askein&quot;), taken in its literal signification, means a polishing, a smoothing or refining. The Greeks used the word to designate the exercises of the athletes, developing the powers dormant in the body and training it to its full natural beauty. The end for which these gymnastic exercises were undertaken was the laurel-wreath bestowed on the victor in the public games. The life of the Christian is, as Christ assures, a struggle for the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 11:12). To give his readers an object-lesson of this spiritual battle and moral endeavour, St. Paul, who had been trained in the Greek fashion, used the picture of the Greek pentathlon (1 Corinthians 9:24). The exercises to be assumed in this combat tend to develop and strengthen the moral stamina, while their aim is Christian perfection leading up to man&#x27;s ultimate end, union with God (named the Mystical Body of Jesus Christ God). Human nature having been weakened by original sin and ever inclining toward what is evil, this end cannot be reached except at the price of overcoming, with God&#x27;s grace, many and serious obstacles.
The moral struggle then consists first of all in attacking and removing the obstacles, that is the evil concupiscences (concupiscence of the flesh, concupiscence of the eyes and pride of life), which effects of original sin serve to try and test man (Trid., Sess. V, De peccato originali). This first duty is called by the Apostle Paul the putting off of &quot;the old man&quot; (Ephesians 4:22). The second duty, in his words, is to &quot;put on the new man&quot; according to the image of God (Ephesians 4:24). A Christian&#x27;s duty is to strive to become like unto Christ, who is &quot;the way, and the truth, and the life&quot; (John 14:6), but this endeavour is based on the supernatural order and, therefore, cannot be accomplished without Divine grace. Its foundation is laid in baptism, which adopts Christians as children of God through the imparting of sanctifying grace. Thenceforth, it must be perfected by the supernatural virtues, the gifts of the Holy Ghost and actual grace.
Since, then, ascetics is the systematic treatise of the striving after Christian perfection, it may be defined as the scientific guide to the acquisition of Christian perfection, which consists in expressing within ourselves, with the help of Divine grace, the image of Christ, by practising the Christian virtues, and applying the means given for overcoming the obstacles. Let us subject the various elements of this definition to a closer examination.

=== Nature of Christian perfection ===

Catholics must reject the conception of the Protestants who fancy that Christian perfection, as understood by Catholics, is essentially negative asceticism (cfr. Seberg in Herzog-Hauck, &quot;Realencyklopädie für prot. Theologie&quot;, III, 138), and that the correct notion of asceticism was discovered by the Reformers. There can be no doubt as to the Catholic position, clearly voiced by St. Thomas and St. Bonaventure who never tired of repeating that the ideal of asceticism upheld by them was the ideal of the Catholic past, of the Fathers, of Christ Himself, emphatically stating that bodily asceticism has not an absolute, but only a relative, value. St. Thomas calls it a &quot;means to an end&quot;, to be used with discretion. St. Bonaventure says that bodily austerities &quot;prepare, foster and preserve perfection&quot; (&quot;Apolog. pauperum&quot;, V, c. viii). As proof he shows that to put an absolute value on bodily asceticism would lead to Manichæism. He also points to Christ, the ideal of Christian perfection, who was less austere in fasting than John the Baptist, and to the founders of religious orders, who prescribed fewer ascetic exercises for their communities than they themselves practised (cf. J. Zahn, &quot;Vollkommenheitsideal&quot; in &quot;Moralprobleme&quot;, Freiburg, 1911, p. 126 sqq.). On the other hand, Catholics do not deny the importance of ascetic practices for acquiring Christian perfection. Considering the actual condition of human nature, they declare these necessary for the removal of obstacles and for the liberation of man&#x27;s moral forces, thus claiming for asceticism a positive character. A like value is put upon those exercises which restrain and guide the powers of the soul. Consequently, Catholics actually fulfil and always have fulfilled what Harnack sets down as a demand of the Gospel and what he pretends to have looked for in vain among Catholics; for they do &quot;wage battle against mammon, care, and selfishness, and practise that charity which loves to serve and to sacrifice itself&quot; (Harnack, &quot;Essence of Christianity&quot;). The Catholic ideal, then, is by no means confined to the negative element of asceticism, but is of a positive nature.

The essence of Christian perfection is love. St. Thomas (Opusc. de perfectione christ., c. ii) calls that perfect which is conformable to its end (&quot;quod attingit ad finem ejus&quot;). As the end of man is God, what unites him, even on earth, most closely with God is love (1 Corinthians 6:17; 1 John 4:16). All the other virtues are subservient to love or its natural prerequisites, as faith and hope; Love seizes man&#x27;s whole soul (intellect, will), sanctifies it and fuses new life into it. Love lives in all things and all things live in and through love. Love imparts to all things the right measure and directs them all to the last end. &quot;Love is thus the principle of unity, no matter how diversified are the particular states, vocations and labours. There are many provinces, but they constitute one realm. The organs are many, but the organism is one&quot; (Zahn, l. c., p. 146). Love is therefore rightly called &quot;the bond of perfection&quot; (Colossians 3:14) and the fulfilment of the law (Romans 13:8). That Christian perfection consists in love has ever been the teaching of Catholic ascetical writers. A few testimonies may suffice. Writing to the Corinthians, Clement of Rome says (1 Corinthians 49:1): &quot;It was love that made all the elect perfect; without love nothing is acceptable to God&quot; (en te agape ateleiothesan pantes oi eklektoi tou theou dicha agapes ouden euareston estin to theo; Funk, &quot;Patr. apost.&quot;, p. 163). The &quot;Epistle of Barnabas&quot; insists that the way of light is &quot;the love of him who created us&quot; (agapeseis ton se poiesanta; Funk, l. c., p. 91), &quot;a love of our neighbour that does not even spare our own life&quot; (agapeseis ton plesion sou hyper ten psychen sou), and it affirms that perfection is nothing else than &quot;love and joy over the good works which testify to justice&quot; (agape euphrosyns kai agalliaseos ergon dikaiosynes martyria). St. Ignatius never wearies in his letters of proposing faith as the light and love as the way, love being the end and aim of faith (&quot;Ad Ephes.&quot;, ix, xiv; &quot;Ad Philad.&quot;, ix; &quot;Ad Smyrn.&quot;, vi). According to the &quot;Didache&quot;, love of God and of one&#x27;s neighbour is the beginning of the &quot;way of life&quot; (c. i), and in the &quot;Epistle to Diognetus&quot; active love is called the fruit of belief in Christ. The &quot;Pastor&quot; of Hermas acknowledges the same ideal when he sets down &quot;a life for God&quot; (zoe to theo) as the sum-total of human existence. To these Apostolic Fathers may be added St. Ambrose (De fuga sæculi, c. iv, 17; c. vi, 35-36) and St. Augustine, who regards perfect justice as tantamount to perfect love. Both St. Thomas and St. Bonaventure speak the same language, and the ascetical writers of all subsequent centuries have faithfully followed in their authoritative footsteps (cf. Lutz, &quot;Die kirchl. Lehre von den evang. Räten&quot;, Paderborn, 1907, pp. 26–99).

However, though perfection is essentially love, not any degree of love is sufficient to constitute moral perfection. The ethical perfection of the Christian consists in the perfection of love, which requires such a disposition &quot;that we can act with speed and ease even though many obstacles obstruct our path&quot; (Mutz, &quot;Christl. Ascetik&quot;, 2nd ed., Paderborn, 1909). But this disposition of the soul supposes that the passions have been subdued; for it is the result of a laborious struggle, in which the moral virtues, steeled by love, force back and quell the evil inclinations and habits, supplanting them by good inclinations and habits. Only then has it really become &quot;a man&#x27;s second nature, as it were, to prove his love of God at certain times and under certain circumstances, to practise virtue and, as far as human nature may, to preserve his soul even from the slightest taints&quot; (Mutz, l. c., p. 43). Owing to the weakness of human nature and the presence of the evil concupiscence (fomes peccati: Trid., Sess. VI, can. xxiii), a perfection that would exclude every defect cannot be attained in this life without a special privilege (cf. Proverbs 20:9; Ecclesiastes 7:21; James 3:2). Likewise, perfection on this side of the grave will never reach such a degree that further growth is impossible, as is clear from the mind of the Church and the nature of our present existence (status vioe); in other words, our perfection will always be relative. As St. Bernard says: &quot;An unflagging zeal for advancing and a continual struggle for perfection is itself perfection&quot; (Indefessus proficiendi studium et iugis conatus ad perfectionem, perfectio reputatur; &quot;Ep. ccliv ad Abbatem Guarinum&quot;). Since perfection consists in love, it is not the privilege of one particular state, but may be, and has as a fact been, attained in every state of life (cf. Christian and Religious Perfection). Consequently, it would be wrong to identify perfection with the so-called state of perfection and the observance of the evangelical counsels. As St. Thomas rightly observes, there are perfect men outside the religious orders and imperfect men within them (Summa theol., II-II, Q. clxxxiv, a. 4). True it is that the conditions for realizing the ideal of a Christian life are, generally speaking, more favourable in the religious state than in the secular avocations. But not all are called to the religious life, nor would all find in it their contentment. To sum up, the end is the same, the means are different. This sufficiently answers Harnack&#x27;s objection (Essence of Christianity) that the Church considers the perfect imitation of Christ possible only for the monks, while she accounts the life of a Christian in the world as barely sufficient for the attainment of the last end.

The ideal, to which the Christian should conform and towards which he should strive with all his powers both natural and supernatural, is Jesus Christ. His whole life should be so penetrated by Christ that he becomes Christian in the full sense of the word (&quot;until Christ be formed in you&quot;; Galatians 4:19). That Christ is the supreme model and pattern of the Christian life follows from Scripture, e. g. from John, xiii, 15, and I Peter, ii, 21, where imitation of Christ is directly recommended, and from John, viii, 12, where Christ is called &quot;the light of the world&quot;. Cf. also Rom., viii, 29, Gal., ii, 20, Phil., iii, 8, and Heb., i, 3, where the Apostle extols the excellent knowledge of Jesus Christ, for whom he has suffered the loss of all things, counting them but as dung, that he may gain Christ. Of the numerous testimonies of the Fathers we only quote St. Augustine: &quot;Finis ergo noster perfectio nostra esse debet; perfectio nostra Christus&quot; (P. L., XXXVI, 628; cf. also &quot;In Psalm.&quot;, 26, 2, in P. L., XXXVI, 662). In Christ there is no shadow, nothing one-sided. His Divinity guarantees the purity of the model; His humanity, by which He became similar to us, makes the model attractive. But this picture of Christ, unmarred by addition or omission, is to be found only in the Catholic Church and, owing to her indefectibility, will always continue there in its ideal state. For the same reason, the Church alone can give us the guarantee that the ideal of the Christian life will always remain pure and unadulterated, and will not be identified with one particular state or with a subordinate virtue (cf. Zahn, l. c., p. 124). An unprejudiced examination proves that the ideal of Catholic life has been preserved in all its purity through the centuries and that the Church has never failed to correct the false touches with which individuals might have sought to disfigure its unstained beauty. The individual features and the fresh colours for outlining the living picture of Christ are derived from the sources of Revelation and the doctrinal decisions of the Church. These tell us about the internal sanctity of Christ (John 1:14; Colossians 2:9; Hebrews 1:9; etc.). His life overflowing with grace, of whose fulness we have all received (John 1:16), His life of prayer (Mark 1:21, 35; 3:1; Luke 5:16; 6:12; 9:18; etc.), His devotion to His heavenly Father (Matthew 11:26; John 4:34; 5:30; 8:26, 29), His intercourse with men (Matthew 9:10; cf. 1 Corinthians 9:22), His spirit of unselfishness and sacrifice, His patience and meekness, and, finally, His asceticism as revealed in his fastings (Matthew 4:2; 6:18).

=== Dangers ===
The second task of ascetical theology is to point out the dangers which may frustrate the attainment of Christian perfection and to indicate the means by which they can be avoided successfully. The first danger to be noticed is evil concupiscence. A second danger lies in the allurements of the visible creation, which occupy man&#x27;s heart to the exclusion of the highest good; to the same class belong the enticements of the sinful, corrupt world (1 John 5:19): those men who promulgate vicious and ungodly doctrines and thereby dim or deny man&#x27;s sublime destiny, or who by perverting ethical concepts and by setting a bad example give a false tendency to man&#x27;s sensuality. Thirdly, ascetics acquaints not only with the malice of the devil, lest one falls prey to his cunning wiles, but also with his weakness, lest one lose heart. Finally, not satisfied with indicating the general means to be used for waging a victorious combat, ascetics offers particular remedies for special temptations (cf. Mutz, &quot;Ascetik&quot;, 2nd ed., p. 107 sqq.).

=== Means for realizing the Christian ideal ===

Prayer, above all, in its stricter meaning, is a means of attaining perfection; special devotions approved by the Church and the sacramental means of sanctification have a special reference to the striving after perfection (frequent confession and communion). Ascetics proves the necessity of prayer (2 Corinthians 3:5) and teaches the mode of praying with spiritual profit; it justifies vocal prayers and teaches the art of meditating according to the various methods of St. Peter of Alcantara, of St. Ignatius, and other saints, especially the &quot;tres modi orandi&quot; of St. Ignatius. An important place is assigned to the examination of conscience, because ascetical life wanes or waxes with its neglect or careful performance; without this regular practice, a thorough purification of the soul and progress in spiritual life are out of the question. It centres the searchlight of the interior vision on every single action: all sins, whether committed with full consciousness or only half voluntarily, even the negligences which, though not sinful, lessen the perfection of the act, all are carefully scrutinized (peccata, offensiones, negligentioe; cf. &quot;Exercitia spiritualia&quot; of St. Ignatius, ed. P. Roothaan, p. 3). Ascetics distinguishes a twofold examination of conscience: one general (examen generale), the other special (examen particulare), giving at the same time directions how both kinds may be made profitable by means of certain practical and psychological aids. The general examination recalls all the faults of one day; the particular, on the contrary, focusses on one single defect and marks its frequency, or on one virtue to augment the number of its acts.

Ascetics encourages visits to the Blessed Sacrament (&quot;visitatio sanctissimi&quot;), a practice meant especially to nourish and strengthen the divine virtues of faith, hope and charity. It also inculcates the veneration of the saints, whose virtuous lives should spur us on to imitation. It is plain that imitation cannot mean an exact copying. What ascetics proposes as the most natural method of imitation is the removal or at least the lessening of the contrast existing between our own lives and the lives of the saints, the perfecting, as far as is possible, of human virtues, with due regard to personal disposition and the surrounding circumstances of time and place. On the other hand, the observation that some saints are more to be admired than imitated must not lead into the mistake of letting one&#x27;s works be weighted with the ballast of human comfort and ease, at last looking with suspicion on every heroic act, as though it were something that transcended one&#x27;s own energy and could not be reconciled with the present circumstances. Such a suspicion would be justified only if the heroic act could not at all be made to harmonize with the preceding development of interior life. The Blessed Mother of God is, after Christ, the most sublime ideal. No one has received grace in such fulness, no one has co-operated with grace so faithfully as she, so the Church praises her as the Mirror of Justice (speculum justitioe). The mere thought of her transcendent purity suffices to repel the alluring charms of sin and to inspire pleasure in the wonderful lustre of virtue.

Self-denial is the second means which ascetics teaches us (cf. Matthew 16:24-25). Without it the combat between spirit and flesh, which are contrary to each other (Romans 7:23; 1 Corinthians 9:27; Galatians 5:17), will not lead to the victory of the spirit (Imitatio Christi, I, xxv). How far self-denial should extend is clear from the actual condition of human nature after the fall of Adam. The inclination to sin dominates both the will and the lower appetites; not only the intellect, but also the outer and the inner senses are made subservient to this evil propensity. Hence, self-denial and self-control must extend to all these faculties. Ascetics reduces self-denial to exterior and interior mortification: exterior mortification is the mortification of sensuality and the senses; interior mortification consists in the purification of the faculties of the soul (memory, imagination, intellect, will) and the mastering of the passions. However, the term &quot;mortification&quot; must not be taken to mean the stunting of the &quot;strong, full, healthy&quot; (Schell) life; what it aims at is that the sensual passions do not gain the upper hand over the will. It is precisely through taming the passions by means of mortification and self-denial that life and energy are strengthened and freed from cumbersome shackles. But while the masters of asceticism recognize the necessity of mortification and self-denial, far from deeming it &quot;criminal to assume voluntary sufferings&quot; (Seeberg), they are just as far from advocating the so-called &quot;non-sensual&quot; tendency which, looking upon the body and its life as a necessary evil, proposes to avert its noxious effects by wilful weakening or even mutilation (cf. Schneider, &quot;Göttliche Weltordnung u. religionslose Sittlichkeit&quot;, Paderborn, 1900, p. 537). On the other hand, Catholics reject the gospel of &quot;healthy sensuality&quot;, which is only a pretty-sounding title, invented to cloak unrestricted concupiscence.

Special attention is devoted to the mastering of the passions, because with them above all else the moral combat must be waged most relentlessly. Scholastic philosophy enumerates as passions: love, hatred, desire, horror, joy, sadness, hope, despair, boldness, fear, anger. Starting from the Christian idea that the passions (passiones, as understood by St. Thomas) are inherent in human nature, ascetics affirms that they are neither sicknesses, as the Stoics, the Reformers and Kant maintain, nor yet harmless as was asserted by the Humanists and Rousseau who denied original sin. On the contrary, it insists that in themselves they are indifferent, may be employed for good and for evil and receive a moral character only by the use to which the will puts them. It is the purpose of ascetics to point out the ways and means by which these passions can be tamed and mastered, so that, instead of goading the will to sin, they are made welcome allies for the accomplishment of good. And since the passions are inordinate in as far as they turn to illicit things or exceed the necessary bounds in those things which are licit, ascetics teaches how to render them innocuous by averting or restraining them, or by turning them to loftier purposes.

Labour also is subservient to the striving after perfection. Untiring labour runs counter to human corrupt nature, which loves ease and comfort. Hence well-ordered, persistent and purposeful labour implies self-denial. This is why the Catholic Church has always looked upon labour, both manual and mental, as an ascetic means of no small value (cfr. Cassian, &quot;De instit. coenob.&quot;, X, 24; St. Benedicts Rule, xlviii, li; Basil, &quot;Reg. fusius tract.&quot; c. xxxvii, 1–3; &quot;Reg. brevius tract.&quot;, c. lxxii; Origen, &quot;Contra Celsum&quot;, I, 28). St. Basil even holds that piety and avoidance of labour are irreconcilable in the Christian ideal of life (cf. Mausbach, &quot;Die Ethik des hl. Augustinus&quot;, 1909, p. 264).

Suffering too is an integral constituent of the Christian ideal and pertains consequently to ascetics, but its real value appears only in the light of faith, which teaches us that suffering makes us like unto Christ, we being the members of the mystic body of which He is the head (1 Peter 2:21), that suffering is the channel of grace which heals (sanat), preserves (conservat) and tests (probat). Finally ascetics teaches us how to turn sufferings into channels of heavenly grace.

The Virtues are subjected to a thorough discussion. As is proved in dogmatic theology, our soul receives in justification supernatural habits, not only the three Divine, but also the moral virtues (Trid., Sess. VI, De justit., c. vi; Cat. Rom., p. 2, c. 2, n. 51). These supernatural powers (virtutes infusoe) are joined to the natural faculties or the acquired virtues (virtutes acguisitoe), constituting with them one principle of action. It is the task of ascetics to show how the virtues, taking into account the obstacles and means mentioned, can be reduced to practice in the actual life of the Christian, so that love be perfected and the image of Christ receive perfect shape in us. Conformable to the Brief of Leo XIII, &quot;Testem benevolentiæ&quot; of 22 January 1899, ascetics insists that the so-called &quot;passive&quot; virtues (meekness, humility, obedience, patience) must never be set aside in favour of the &quot;active&quot; virtues (devotion to duty, scientific activity, social and civilizing labour) which would be tantamount to denying that Christ is the perpetual model. Rather, both kinds must be harmoniously joined in the life of the Christian. True imitation of Christ is never a brake, nor does it blunt the initiative in any field of human endeavour, but the practice of the passive virtues is a support and aid to true activity. Besides, it not rarely happens that the passive virtues reveal a higher degree of moral energy than the active. The Brief itself refers to Matt., xxi, 29; Rom., viii, 29; Gal., v, 24; Phil., ii, 8; Heb., xiii, 8 (cf. also Zahn, l. c., 166 sqq.).

=== Application of the means in the three degrees of Christian perfection ===

Imitation of Christ is the duty of all who strive after perfection. It lies in the very nature of this formation after the image of Christ that the process is gradual and must follow the laws of moral energy; for moral perfection is the terminus of a laborious journey, the crown of a hard-fought battle. Ascetics divides those who strive after perfection into three groups: the beginners, the advanced, the perfect; and correspondingly sets down three stages or ways of Christian perfection: the purgative way, the illuminative way, the unitive way. The means stated above are applied with more or less diversity according to the stage which the Christian has reached.
In the purgative way, when the appetites and inordinate passions still possess considerable strength, mortification and self-denial are to be practised more extensively. For the seeds of the spiritual life will not sprout unless the tares and thistles have first been weeded out. In the illuminative way, when the mists of passion have been lifted to a great extent, meditation and the practice of virtues in imitation of Christ are to be insisted on. During the last stage, the unitive way, the soul must be confirmed and perfected in conformity with God&#x27;s will (&quot;And I live, now not I; but Christ liveth in me&quot;: Galatians 2:20).
One may not to mistake the three stages for wholly separate portions of the striving after virtue and perfection. Even in the second and the third stages there occur at times violent struggles, while the joy of being united with God may sometimes be granted in the initial stage as an inducement for further advance (cf. Mutz, &quot;Aszetik,&quot; 2nd ed., 94 sq.).

=== Relation of ascetics to moral theology and mysticism ===

All these disciplines are concerned with the Christian life and its last end in the next world; but they differ, though not totally, in their mode of treatment. Ascetical theology, separated from moral theology and mysticism, has for its subject-matter the striving after Christian perfection; it shows how Christian perfection may be attained by earnestly exercising and schooling the will, using the specified means both to avoid the dangers and allurements of sin and to practise virtue with greater intensity. Moral theology is the doctrine of the duties, and in discussing the virtues is satisfied with a scientific exposition.
Mysticism treats essentially of &quot;union with God&quot; and of the extraordinary, so-called mystic prayer. Though also those phenomena which are accidental to mysticism, such as ecstasy, vision, revelation, fall within its scope, yet they are by no means essential to the mystic life (cf. Zahn, &quot;Einführung in die christl. Mystik&quot;, Paderborn, 1908). While mysticism includes also matter of ascetics, such as the endeavour of purification, vocal prayer, etc. this is only done because these exercises are looked upon as preparatory to the mystical life and must not be discarded even in its highest stage. Nevertheless, the mystical life is not merely a higher degree of the ascetical life, but differs from it essentially, the mystical life being a special grace granted to the Christian without any immediate merit on his part.

=== Historical development ===

==== Bible ====
Abounds in practical instructions for the life of Christian perfection. Christ himself has drawn its outlines both as to its negative and positive requirements. His imitation is the supreme law (John 8:12; 12:26), charity the first commandment (Matthew 22:36-38; John 15:17); the right intention imparts value to the exterior works (Matthew 5-7), while self-denial and the carrying of the cross are the conditions for His discipleship (Matthew 10:38; 16:24; Mark 8:34; Luke 9:23; 14:27).

Both by His own example (Matthew 4:2) and His exhortations (Matthew 17:20; Mark 9:28) Christ recommended fasting. He inculcated sobriety, watchfulness and prayer (Matthew 24:42; 25:13; 26:41; Mark 13:37; 14:37). He pointed to poverty as a means of gaining the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 6:19; 13:22; Luke 6:20; 8:14; 12:33; etc.) and counselled the rich youth to relinquish everything and to follow Him (Matthew 19:21). That this was a counsel and not a strict command, given in view of the particular attachment of the youth to the things of this world, is shown by the very fact that the Master had twice said &quot;keep the commandments&quot;, and that he recommended the renunciation of all earthly goods only on the renewed inquiry after the means that lead to perfection (cf. Lutz, l. c., against the Protestants Th. Zahn, Bern, Weiss, Lemme, and others). Celibacy for God&#x27;s sake was praised by Christ as worthy of a special heavenly reward (Matthew 19:12). Yet marriage is not condemned, but the words, &quot;All men take not this word, but they to whom it is given&quot;, imply that it is the ordinary state, celibacy for God&#x27;s sake being merely a counsel. Indirectly, Christ also commended voluntary obedience as a means for attaining the most intimate union with God (Matthew 18:4; 20:22, 25).

What Christ outlined in his teachings the Apostles continued to develop. Especially St. Paul of Tarsus brings the two elements of Christian asceticism out in well-defined terms: mortification of inordinate desires as the negative element (Romans 6:8, 13; 2 Corinthians 4:16; Galatians 5:24; Colossians 3:5), union with God in all thoughts, words and deeds (1 Corinthians 10:31; Galatians 6:14; Colossians 3:3-17), and active love of God and once neighbour (Romans 8:35; 1 Corinthians 13:3) as the positive element.

==== Fathers and Doctors of the Church ====
With the Bible as a basis, the Fathers and Doctors of the Church explained particular features of the Christian life in a more coherent and detailed manner. The Apostolic Fathers called the love of God and man the sun of Christian life which, animating all virtues with its vital rays, inspires contempt of the world, beneficence, immaculate purity and self-sacrifice. The &quot;Didache&quot;, which was intended to serve as a manual for catechumens, thus describes the way of life: &quot;First, thou shalt love God, who created thee; secondly, thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; whatever thou wishest that it should not be done to thee, do not to others.&quot;

Following probably the &quot;Didache&quot;, the &quot;Epistle of Barnabas&quot;, written at the end of the 2nd century, represents the Christian life under the figure of the two ways, that of light and that of darkness. Two Epistles, purporting to come from the pen of St. Clement, but probably written in the 3rd century, exalt the life of virginity, if grounded on the love of God and accompanied by the corresponding works, as heavenly, divine and angelic. St. Polycarp says that St. Ignatius of Antioch&#x27;s letters contain &quot;faith and patience and all edification in the Lord&quot;; the &quot;Pastor&quot; of Hermas in the twelve commandments inculcates simplicity, truthfulness, chastity, meekness, patience, continence, confidence in God and perpetual struggle against concupiscence.

With the 3rd century the works on Christian asceticism began to show a more scientific character. The writings of Clement of Alexandria and Gregory the Great (&quot;Moral.&quot;, XXXIII, c. xxvii; cf. also Cassian, &quot;Coll&quot;, IX, XV) show traces of the threefold degree which was afterwards systematically developed by Dionysius the Areopagite. In his &quot;Stromata&quot; Clement sets forth the full beauty and grandeur of &quot;true philosophy&quot;. Remarkably this author delineates, even in its details, what is now known as ethical culture, and endeavours to harmonize it with the example given by Christ. The life of the Christian is to be ruled in all things by temperance. Following out this idea, he discusses in a casuistic form food and drink, dress and love of finery, bodily exercises and social conduct.

From the 4th century, a twofold line of thought is discernible in the works on Christian life: one speculative, laying stress on the union of the soul with God, the Absolute Truth and Goodness; the other practical, aiming principally at instruction in the practice of the Christian virtues. The speculative element prevailed in the mystical school, which owes its systematic development to Pseudo-Dionysius and which reached its highest perfection in the 14th century. The practical element was emphasized in the ascetical school with St. Augustine as its chief representative, in whose footsteps followed Gregory the Great and Bernard of Clairvaux.

It may suffice to detail the principal points on which the writers prior to the medieval-scholastic period dwelt in their instructions. On prayer we have the works of Macarius the Egyptian (d. 385) and of Tertullian (d. after 220), who supplemented his treatise on prayer in general by an explanation of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer. Cyprian of Carthage (d. 258) wrote &quot;De oratione dominica&quot;, and St. Chrysostom (d. 407). Penance and the spirit of penance were treated by Tertullian (De poenitentia), John Chrysostom (&quot;De compunctione cordis&quot;, &quot;De poenitentia&quot;) and Cyril of Jerusalem (d. 386) in his second catechetical instruction. That the life of the Christian is a warfare is amply illustrated in St. Augustine&#x27;s (d. 430) &quot;De agone christiano&quot; and &quot;Confessions&quot;.

Chastity and virginity were treated by Methodius of Olympus (d. 311) in his &quot;Convivium&quot;, in which ten virgins, discussing virginity, demonstrate the moral superiority of Christianity over the ethical tenets of pagan philosophy. The same subject is discussed by the following Fathers: Cyprian (d. 258); Gregory of Nyssa (d. 394) in his &quot;De virginitate&quot;; Ambrose (d. 397), the indefatigable eulogist and champion of the virginal life; Jerome in his &quot;Adversus Helvidium de virginitate&quot; and &quot;Ad Eustachium&quot;; Chrysostom (d. 407) in his &quot;De virginitate&quot;, who, though extolling virginity as a heavenly life, yet recommends it only as a counsel; Augustine in his works &quot;De continentia&quot;, &quot;De virginitate&quot;, &quot;De bono viduitatis&quot;.

On patience we have the works of Cyprian, Augustine and Tertullian&#x27;s &quot;De patientia&quot;, in which he speaks of this virtue as an invalid might speak of health to console himself. Chrysostom&#x27;s &quot;De jejunio et eleemosyna&quot; discusses fasting. Almsgiving and good works are encouraged in Cyprian&#x27;s &quot;De opere et eleemosynis&quot; and in Augustine&#x27;s &quot;De fide et operibus&quot;. The value of labour is explained in &quot;De opere monachorum&quot; by St. Augustine.

Nor are treatises on the different states of life wanting. Thus St. Augustine&#x27;s &quot;De bono conjugali&quot; treats of the married state; his &quot;De bono viduitatis&quot; of widowhood. A frequent subject was the priesthood. Gregory of Nazianzus, in his &quot;De fuga&quot;, treats of the dignity and responsibility of the priesthood; Chrysostom&#x27;s &quot;De sacerdotio&quot; exalts the sublimity of this state with surpassing excellence; St. Ambrose in his &quot;De officiis&quot;, while speaking of the four cardinal virtues, admonishes the clerics that their lives should be an illustrious example; St. Jerome&#x27;s &quot;Epistola ad Nepotianum&quot; discusses the dangers to which priests are exposed; the &quot;Regula pastoralis&quot; of Gregory the Great inculcates the prudence indispensable to the pastor in his dealings with different classes of men. Of prime importance for the monastic life was the work &quot;De institutis coenobiorum&quot; of Cassian.

But the standard work from the 8th to the 13th century was the Rule of St. Benedict, which found numerous commentators. Of the saint or rather his Rule St. Bernard says: &quot;lpse dux noster, ipse magister et legifer noster est&quot; (Serm. in Nat. S. Bened., n. 2). Illustrations of the practice of Christian virtues in general were the &quot;Expositio in beatum Job&quot; of pope Gregory the Great and the &quot;Collationes Patrum&quot; of Cassian, in which the various elements of Christian perfection were discussed in the form of dialogues.

==== Medieval-Scholastic period ====
The transition period up to the 12th century exhibits no specially noteworthy advance in ascetical literature. To the endeavour to gather and preserve the teachings of the Fathers we owe Alcuin&#x27;s &quot;De virtutibus et vitiis&quot;. But when in the 12th century speculative theology was celebrating its triumphs, mystical and ascetical theology too showed a healthy activity.

The results of the former could not but benefit the latter by placing Christian morality on a scientific basis and throwing ascetical theology itself into a scientific form. The pioneers in this field were St. Bernard (d. 1156), Hugh of St. Victor and Richard of St. Victor. St. Bernard, the greatest mystical theologian of the 12th century, also holds a prominent place among ascetical writers, so that Harnack calls the &quot;religious genius&quot; of the 12th century. The basic idea of his works, especially prominent in his treatise &quot;De gratia et libero arbitrio&quot;, is that the life of the Christian should be a copy of the life of Jesus. Like Clement of Alexandria, he lays down precepts for the regulation of the necessities of life as food and dress, and for the implanting of God&#x27;s love in man&#x27;s heart, which would sanctify all things (&quot;Apologia&quot;, &quot;De præcepto et dispensatione&quot;). Many are the steps by which love ascends till it reaches its perfection in the love for God&#x27;s sake. Among his ascetical writings are: &quot;Liber de diligendo Deo&quot;, &quot;Tractatus de gradibus humilitatis et superbiæ&quot;, &quot;De moribus et officio episcoporum&quot;, &quot;Sermo de conversione ad clericos&quot;, and &quot;De consideratione&quot;.

Frequent allusions to SS. Augustine and Gregory the Great are scattered through the pages of Hugh of St. Victor (d. 1141), so much so that he earned the distinction of being called a second Augustine by his contemporaries. He was undoubtedly the first to give to ascetical theology a more or less definite, scientific character. The ever-recurring theme of his works is love. But what he aimed at above all in his writings was to lay bare the psychological bearings of mystical and ascetical theology. Noteworthy are his works: &quot;De vanitate mundi&quot;, &quot;De laude caritatis&quot;, &quot;De mode orandi&quot;, &quot;De meditatione&quot;.

His pupil, Richard of St. Victor (d. 1173), though more ingenious and systematic, is yet less intent upon practical utility, except in his work &quot;De exterminatione mali et promotione boni&quot;.

The great theologians of the 13th century, who were no less famous for their scholastic &quot;Summæ&quot; than for their ascetical and mystical writings, brought ascetical teaching to its perfection and gave it the definite shape it has retained as a standard for all future times. No other epoch furnishes such convincing proof that true science and true piety are rather a help than a hindrance to each other.

Albertus Magnus, or Albert the Great, the illustrious teacher of Thomas Aquinas, who was the first to join Aristotelean philosophy with theology and to make philosophy the handmaid of theology, was at the same time the author of excellent works on ascetics and mysticism, e. g., &quot;De adhærendo Deo&quot;, the ripest fruit of his mystic genius, and &quot;Paradisus animæ&quot;, which was conceived along more practical lines. St. Thomas explains in the ascetic work &quot;De perfectione vitæ spiritualis&quot; the essence of Christian perfection so lucidly that his line of argumentation may even in our days serve as a model. His other works too contain ample material of value both for ascetics and for mysticism.

The Seraphic Doctor, St. Bonaventure, in the words of Pope Leo XIII, &quot;treats of mystic theology in a manner so perfect that the unanimous opinion of the most expert theologians regards him as the prince of mystic theologians&quot;. Of his authentic works the following deserve mention: &quot;De perfectione evangelica&quot;, &quot;Collationes de septem donis Spiritus sancti&quot;, &quot;Incendium amoris&quot;, &quot;Soliloquium&quot;, Lignum vitæ&quot;, &quot;De præparatione ad Missam&quot;, &quot;Apologia pauperum&quot;. 
From the pen of David of Augsburg, a contemporary of these great masters, is an ascetic instruction for novices in his book entitled &quot;De exterioris et interioris hominis compositione&quot;. He leads the reader along the three well-known ways, purgative, illuminative and unitive, purposing to make the reader a spiritual man. By severely disciplining the faculties of the soul and subordinating the flesh to the spirit, man must restore the original order, so that he may not only do what is good, but likewise do it with ease. There remains to be mentioned the &quot;Summa de vitiis et virtutibus&quot; of Peraldus (d. c. 1270).

The 14th century is characterized throughout by its mystical tendencies. Among the works which this period produced, Henry Suso&#x27;s &quot;Booklet of Eternal Wisdom deserves special mention on account of its highly practical value.

Pre-eminent in the fifteenth century were Gerson, Dionysius the Carthusian and the author of the &quot;Imitation of Christ&quot;. Relinquishing the ideals of the mystic writers of the fourteenth century, Gerson attached himself again to the great scholastic writers, thus avoiding the vagaries which had become alarmingly frequent among the mystics. His &quot;Considerationes de theologia mystica&quot; shows that he belongs to the practical school of asceticism. Dionysius the Carthusian is esteemed as a highly gifted teacher of the spiritual life. Both mysticism properly so called and practical asceticism owe valuable works to his pen. To the latter category belong: &quot;De remediis tentationum&quot;, &quot;De via purgativa&quot;, &quot;De oratione&quot;, &quot;De gaudio spirituali et pace interna&quot;, &quot;De quatuor novissimis&quot;.

The &quot;Imitatio Christi&quot;, which appeared in the middle of the 15th century, deserves special attention on account of its lasting influence. &quot;It is a classic in its ascetical unction and perfect in its artistic style&quot; (Hamm, &quot;Die Schönheit der kath. Moral&quot;, Munich-Gladbach, 1911, p. 74). In four books it treats of the interior spiritual life in imitation of Jesus Christ. It pictures the struggle which man must wage against his inordinate passions and perverse inclinations, the indulgence of which sullies his conscience and robs him of God&#x27;s grace: &quot;Vanity of vanities and all is vanity, except to love God and serve Him alone&quot; (Vanitas vanitatum et omnia vanitas præter amare Deum et illi soli servire: I, i). It advises mortification and self-denial as the most efficacious weapons in this struggle. It teaches man to establish God&#x27;s kingdom in his soul by the practice of virtues according to the example of Jesus Christ. It finally leads him to union with Christ by exciting love for him as well as by pointing out the frailty of all creatures: &quot;It is necessary to leave the beloved thing for the beloved, because Jesus wishes to be loved above all things&quot; (Oportet dilectum propter dilectum relinquere, quia Jesus vult solus super omnia amari: II, xvii). The thoughts of the &quot;Imitation&quot; are thrown into epigrams so simple that they are within the mental grasp of all. Though the book betrays that the author was well versed not only in Scholastic philosophy and theology, but also in the secrets of the mystical life, yet this fact never obtrudes itself on the reader, nor does it obscure the meaning of the contents. A number of quotations from the great doctors Augustine, Bernard, Bonaventure and Thomas, from Aristotle, Ovid and Seneca do not mar the impression that the whole work is the spontaneous outburst of an intensely glowing soul. It has often been said that the teachings of the &quot;Imitation&quot; are &quot;unworldly&quot; and show little appreciation for science, but one must take into consideration the peculiar circumstances of the time: Scholasticism had entered on a period of decline and had lost itself in intricate subtleties; mysticism had gone astray; all classes had been more or less infected with the spirit of licentiousness; conditions like these are the key to interpret phrases such as the following: &quot;I would rather feel compunction than know how to define it&quot; (Opto magis sentire compunctionem quam scire ejus definitionem) or &quot;This is the highest wisdom: through contempt of the world to strive for the kingdom of heaven&quot; (Ista est summa sapientia: per contemptum mundi tendere ad regna coelestia).

====Modern times====

During the 16th century St. Teresa and St. Ignatius of Loyola stand out most prominently owing to the wide-felt influence which they exerted upon the religion of their contemporaries, an influence that is still at work through their writings. The writings of St. Teresa arouse our admiration by the simplicity, clearness and precision of her judgment. Her letters show her to be an enemy of everything that smacks of eccentricity or singularity, sham piety or indiscreet zeal. One of her principal works, the &quot;Way to Perfection&quot;, though written primarily for nuns, also contains apposite instructions for those who live in the world. While teaching the way to contemplation, she yet insists that not all are called to it and that there is greater security in the practice of humility, mortification, and the other virtues. Her masterpiece is the &quot;Castle of the Soul&quot;, in which she expounds her theory of mysticism under the metaphor of a &quot;castle&quot; with many chambers. The soul resplendent with the beauty of the diamond or crystal is the castle; the various chambers are the various degrees through which the soul must pass before she can dwell in perfect union with God. Scattered throughout the work are many hints of inestimable value for asceticism as applied in everyday life. This fact is undoubtedly due to the well-founded conviction of the saint that even in extraordinary states the ordinary means must not be set aside altogether, so that illusions may be guarded against (cf. J. Zahn, &quot;Introduction to Mysticism&quot; p. 213).

In his &quot;Exercitia spiritualia&quot; St. Ignatius of Loyola has left to posterity a grand literary monument of the science of the soul, but also a method unparalleled in its practical efficacy of strengthening the willpower. The booklet has appeared in numberless editions and revisions and, &quot;despite its modest guise, is in reality a complete system of asceticism&quot; (Meschler). The four weeks of the Exercises acquaint the exercitant with the three degrees of the spiritual life. The first week is taken up with cleansing the soul from sin and from its inordinate attachment to creatures. The second and third weeks lead the exercitant along the illuminative way. The portrait of Christ, the most lovable of all men, is outlined before his eyes, so that he can contemplate in the humanity the reflex of Divine light and the supreme model of all virtues. The meditations of the fourth week, the subject of which are the resurrection etc., lead to union with God and teach the soul to rejoice in the glory of the Lord. It is true, there are many rules and regulations, the sequence is most logical, the arrangement of the meditations follows the laws of psychology; yet these exercises do no violence to the free will, but are meant to strengthen the faculties of the soul. They do not, as has often been asserted, make the exercitant a powerless instrument in the hands of the confessor, nor are they a mystic flight to heaven, accomplished by means of a compulsion which intends a rapid advance in perfection by a mechanical process (Zöckler, &quot;Die Tugendlehre des Christentums&quot;, Gütersloh, 1904, p. 335). Their marked intellectualism, so frequently objected to, in no way constitutes a hindrance to mysticism (Meschler, &quot;Jesuitenaszese u. deutsche Mystik&quot; in &quot;Stimmen aus Maria-Laach&quot;, 1912). On the contrary, they make man&#x27;s moral will truly free by removing the hindrances, while, by cleansing the heart and by accustoming the mind to meditative prayer, they are an excellent preparation for the mystical life.

Louis of Granada, O. P. (died 1588), also belongs to this period. His work &quot;La guia de pecadores&quot; may be styled a book full of consolation for the erring. His &quot;El memorial de la vida cristiana&quot; contains instructions which take the soul from the very beginning and lead her to the highest perfection. Louis of Blois (Blosius), O. S. B. (d. 1566), is of a mind kindred to St. Bernard. His &quot;Monile spirituale&quot; is the best known of his numerous works. Thomas of Jesus (died 1582) wrote the &quot;Passion of Christ&quot; and &quot;De oratione dominica&quot;.

A great number of ascetical writers sprang up during the 17th century. Among them St. Francis de Sales stands out most prominently. According to Linsemann, the publication of his &quot;Philothea&quot; was an event of historical importance. To make piety attractive and to adapt it to all classes whether living in Court circles, in the world or in a monastery, this was his aim and in this he succeeded. Of a mild and sweet temperament, he never lost sight of the habits and particular circumstances of the individual. Though unwavering in his ascetical principles, he yet possessed an admirable facility for adapting them without constraint or rigidity. In the practice of mortification he recommends moderation and adaptation to one&#x27;s state of life and to personal circumstances. Love of God and of man: this he puts down as the motive power of all actions. The spirit of St. Francis pervades the whole of modern asceticism, and even today his &quot;Philothea&quot; is one of the most widely read books on asceticism. &quot;Theotimus&quot;, another work of his, treats in the first six chapters of the love of God, the rest being devoted to mystical prayer. His letters, too, are very instructive. Attention may be called to the new edition of his works (Euvres, Annecy, 1891 sqq.). &quot;Il combattimento spirituale&quot; of Scupoli (d. 1610) was spread very widely and earnestly recommended by Francis de Sales.

*The &quot;Mystica theologia Divi Thomæ&quot; of Thomas a Vallgornera, O. P. (d. 1665), published at Barcelona, (1662 and 1672) and at Turin (1890), is almost exclusively made up of quotations from St. Thomas and is a rich storehouse of ascetical material.
*From the pen of Cardinal Bona, O. Cist. (d. 1674), we have: &quot;Principia et documents vitæ christianæ&quot; (Rome, 1673) and &quot;Manuductio ad coelum&quot; (Rome, 1672 and 1678), both of which works, remarkable for their simplicity and practical utility, were frequently re-edited; the still valuable &quot;De sacrificio Missæ&quot;; &quot;De discretione spirituum&quot;; &quot;Horologium asceticum&quot;. Complete editions of his works appeared at Antwerp, Turin, Venice.
*Morotius, O. Cist., in his &quot;Cursus vitæ spiritualis&quot; (Rome, 1674; new ed., Ratisbon, 1891), follows closely the lead of St. Thomas.
*The &quot;Summa theologiæ mysticæ&quot; (new ed., 3 vols., Freiburg, 1874) is the best and most widely read work of Philip of the Blessed Trinity (d. 1671), the philosopher among the mystic writers. He wrote in the spirit of St. Thomas, following definite scientific principles and showing their practical application in the spiritual life.
*Anthony of the Holy Ghost, O. C. D. (d. 1674), was a disciple of the author just named. His &quot;Directorium mysticum&quot; (new ed., Paris, 1904), dominated by the spirit of. his master, was written for the instruction of his pupils. He is also the author of the following works: &quot;Seminarium virtutum&quot; (3rd ed., Augsburg and Würzburg, 1750), &quot;Irriguum virtutum&quot; (Würzburg, 1723), &quot;Tractatus de clericorum ac præcipue sacerdotum et pastorum dignitate&quot;, etc. (Würzburg, 1676).

In the course of the 18th century a number of valuable works on asceticism and mysticism were published. To Neumeyer, S. J. (d. 1765), we owe the &quot;Idea theol. ascet.&quot;, a complete, scientifically arranged epitome. Rogacci, S. J. (d. 1719), wrote &quot;Del uno necessario&quot;, an instruction in the love of God, which ranks high in ascetical literature and was translated into several languages. Giovanni Battista Scaramelli&#x27;s &quot;Direttorio ascetico&quot; treats asceticism apart from mysticism. A treatise on the virtues is contained in Dirkink, S. J., &quot;Semita perfectionis&quot; (new ed., Paderborn, 1890). Designed along broad lines is the &quot;Trinum perfectum&quot; (3rd ed., Augsburg, 1728) by Michael of St. Catherine. Katzenberger, O. F. M., wrote &quot;Scientia salutis&quot; (new ed., Paderborn, 1901). Schram&#x27;s &quot;Institutiones theol. mysticæ&quot; (2 vols.) combines asceticism with mysticism, though the author is at his best in the ascetical parts. St. Alphonsus Liguori (d. 1787), rightly called the &quot;Apostolic Man&quot;, published a large number of ascetic works, full of heavenly unction and tender-hearted piety. The best-known and most important of them are: &quot;Pratica di amar Gesù Cristo&quot; (1768), &quot;Visita al SS. Sacramento&quot;, perhaps the most widely read of all his ascetical works: &quot;La vera sposa di Gesù Cristo&quot; (1760), a sure guide to perfection for countless souls.

Complete treatises on asceticism, published during the 19th and 20th centuries, are the following: Grundkötter, &quot;Anleitung zur christl. Vollkommenheit&quot; (Ratisbon, 1896). Leick, C. SS. R., &quot;Schule der christl. Vollkommenheit&quot; (Ratisbon, 1886), inspired by the writings of St. Alphonsus Liguori. Weiss, O. P., &quot;Philosophie der christl. Vollkommenheit&quot; (vol. V of his &quot;Apologie&quot;; Freiburg 1898). The author is extraordinarily well read, and his conception of the spiritual life is unusually deep. Ribet, &quot;L&#x27;ascétique chrétienne&quot; (Paris, 1888). Tissot, &quot;La vie intérieure&quot;. Saudreau, &quot;Les degrés de la vie spirituelle&quot; (Angers, 1896 and 1897), a work full of unction. His other works, &quot;Les faits extraordinaires de la vie spirituelle&quot; (1908) and &quot;La vie d&#x27;union à Dieu&quot; (1909), belong to mysticism properly so called. Poulain, S. J., &quot;La grâce d&#x27;oraison&quot;, though of a mystic character, yet treats of the ordinary method of prayer. Saudreau and Poulain are reliable throughout and their works are among the best productions in this branch. Rousset, O. P., &quot;Directorium asceticum&quot; (Freiburg, 1893). Meynard, O. P., &quot;Traité de la vie intérieure&quot; (Paris, 1899), based on St. Thomas. Meyer, S. J., &quot;First Lessons in the Science of the Saints&quot; (2nd ed., St. Louis, 1903), translated into several languages. Francis X. Mutz, &quot;Die christliche Aszetik&quot; (2nd ed., Paderborn, 1909). Joseph Zahn, &quot;Einführung in die christliche Mystik&quot; (Paderborn, 1908), important also for asceticism. Berthier, &quot;De la perfection chrétienne et de la perfection religieuse d&#x27;après S. Thomas et S. François de Sales&quot; (2 vols., Paris, 1901). A. Devine, &quot;Manual of Ascetical Theology&quot; (London). Ryan, &quot;Groundwork of Christian Perfection&quot; (London). Buchanan, &quot;Perfect Love of God&quot; (London).

An exhaustive list of Catholic ascetical writers is given in Migne

Non-Catholic authors: Otto Zöckler, &quot;Die Tugendlehre des Christentums, geschichtlich dargestellt&quot; (Gütersloh, 1904). W. Hermann, &quot;Der Verkehr des Christen mit Gott&quot; (6th ed., Stuttgart, 1908), and &quot;Die sittlichen Weisungen Jesu&quot; (Göttingen, 1907). Kähler, &quot;Verkehr mit Christo in seiner Bedeutung für das eigene Leben&quot; (Leipzig, 1904). Peabody, &quot;Jesus Christ and the Christian Character&quot;. A. Ritschl, &quot;Christiiche Vollkommenheit&quot; (Göttingen, 1902). Sheldon, &quot;In his Steps -- What Would Jesus do?&quot;, widely read in England.

== Eastern Orthodox ==
The Eastern Orthodox share the apostolic faith and sacramental life held in the Catholic faith, and have a virtually identical understanding of the nature and purpose of the Christian life, using different terminology. Those of the Eastern Orthodox tradition refer to the practice of faith as &quot;praxis&quot;, which encompasses prayer, worship, and fasting. A form of prayer corresponding perhaps to the illuminative and unitive ways is called Hesychasm. The overall progression toward union with God is called &quot;theosis&quot;. The understanding of the Christian life, consistent with Patristic and apostolic teachings and implying a start toward purgation, is termed &quot;phronema&quot;. Orthodox sources also refer to &quot;ascetical theology&quot;, with a meaning consistent with that given above.

== Protestant ==
Many Protestants do not share the sacramental understanding that characterizes Catholic and Orthodox faith, but use the term &quot;ascetical theology&quot; in some contexts. Without the sacrament of Confession, the purgative way is more personal, and without belief that God is literally present in the Eucharist, the unitive way is also more personal and ethereal. Protestant theology of union with God tends to be &quot;personalist&quot;. As with the Eucharist, a wide variety of Protestant viewpoints exist regarding the way to follow Christ. This is partly because there is no one center of Protestant thought.

A helpful writer on the theme of askesis from a Protestant viewpoint is Eugene Peterson, especially in his work &quot;Under the Unpredictable Plant&quot;. He refers to many other Protestant writers, including Martin Thornton. Thornton&#x27;s parochial theology of the remnant is an Anglican expression of the Roman Catholic rule of faith.

== Islam ==

There is not an extensive evidence trail of Islam embracing an ascetical theology, but Islamic teachings encourage adherents to imitate closely Muhammad in order to achieve spiritual perfection. Moreover, a certain kind of asceticism, known in Islamic terminology as &quot;zuhd&quot;, exists in manuals of Islamic ethics and mysticism.

<text>Luxullianite (also known as luxulyanite or luxulianite) is a rare type of porphyritic tournalinized granite, notable for the presence of clusters of radially-arranged acicular tourmaline crystals enclosed by phenocrysts of orthoclase and quartz in a matrix of quartz, tourmaline, alkali feldspar, brown mica, and cassiterite.

The name originates from the village of Luxulyan in Cornwall, United Kingdom, where this type of granite is found. An example may be seen in the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s tomb in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London. Some luxullianite is also used in the Porphyry Hall of the Place House in Fowey.

<doc id="711424" wikidata="Q6004168" url="?curid=711424" title="Imitation of God">
<text>Imitation of God () is the religious precept of a person finding salvation by striving to realize their concept of supreme being. It is found in ancient Greek philosophy and several world religions. In some branches of Christianity, however, it plays a key role.

==Hebrew Bible==
Some scholars, such as Cyril Rodd, argue that the concept is not important in the ethics of the Hebrew Bible.

==Judaism==
The concept of &quot;imitatio Dei&quot;—generally taken to be a &quot;mitzvah&quot;—in Judaism is derived, in part, from the concept of &quot;imago Dei&quot;, being made in the image of God. Not only do people in the Torah aspire to take on godly virtues, they are aided by the depiction of God as a human—anthropomorphism. The concept is arguably best expressed in the following quote, taken from &quot;Deuteronomy&quot;:

The LORD will establish you as His holy people, as He swore to you, if you keep the commandments of the LORD your God and walk in His ways.
This exhortation to emulate God&#x27;s ways was later to become part of the basis of rabbinic Judaism; see . Jews are exhorted to perform acts of kindness similar to the ones ascribed to God. Examples are burying the dead (as God buried Moses), visiting the sick (as God visited Abraham) and some very similar &quot;mitzvot&quot;. The Talmud states: &quot;As He is merciful, so should you be merciful&quot;.

==Ancient Greek philosophy==
&quot;Imitatio Dei&quot; appears in one form or another in Plato, Aristotle (where not only humans but everything else &#x27;strives&#x27; toward the unmoved mover), and the Stoic philosophers.

==Christianity==
The Christian disciple is told to imitate God on several occasions. Matthew 5:48 states, &quot;Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.&quot; Luke 6:36 states, &quot;Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.&quot; In Ephesians 5, they are told by Paul to &quot;Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children&quot;. The believer is also advised to follow the ways of Jesus, notably in 1 Corinthians 11:1: &quot;Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.&quot;

===Catholicism and Eastern Christianity===
The Imitation of God is one of the core principles in Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, as well as in Oriental Orthodoxy (Syriac Orthodoxy, Coptic Orthodoxy, Ethiopian Orthodoxy, and the Armenian Apostolic faith).
The Catholic Church fully endorses the concept of &quot;Imitatio Dei/Christi&quot;. In Catholicism and Orthodoxy, it is integrally related to the concept of &quot;Divinization/Theosis&quot;.

The general understanding is that a person can become more similar to God over time, a process called &quot;theosis&quot; in Greek. This doctrine derives from the biblical mandate to be holy as God is Holy (Lev 20.26). It can be achieved by purification (&quot;katharsis&quot;) and illumination (&quot;theoria&quot;), the highest point in illumination is the union with God. The best imitation of God is not only the man&#x27;s effort, but it is mainly achieved by the grace of God. Nevertheless, Eastern Orthodox theology does not usually understand this tri-partite ascent as an attempt to become like God, but as a way to unite with the one God. For most Orthodox theologians, imitatio Dei is not the way to salvation if it is understood as an individual, personal attempt to become god-like.

In Roman Catholicism, the same concepts have been treated under different names (&quot;Via purgativa&quot;, &quot;via iluminativa&quot; and &quot;via unitiva&quot;) by St. John of the Cross and St. Theresa of Avila. &quot;Via purgativa&quot; is the Roman Catholic equivalent to &quot;katharsis&quot;, and &quot;theoria&quot; is subdivided between illumination and full mystical union. This three-step scheme is also found in the Eastern categories of prayer; ordinary prayer, prayer with mind and heart, and unceasing prayer.

===Protestantism===
In Protestantism, the picture is different. In the Anglo-Saxon tradition &quot;Imitatio dei&quot; is widely accepted, whereas the Lutheran tradition prefers to talk of &quot;conformitas&quot; (in German &quot;Nachfolge&quot;) instead of &quot;Nachahmung&quot; (imitation), because Jesus was singular and cannot and need not be imitated, but followed.

==Deism==
Though lacking an official scripture, the practice of Deism is described by Thomas Paine in &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;: &quot;The true Deist has but one Deity, and his religion consists in contemplating the power, wisdom, and benignity of the Deity in his works, and in endeavoring to imitate him in everything moral, scientifically, and mechanical.&quot; He also explains that the works of the Deity are strictly found in &quot;the Creation we behold&quot; where &quot;God speaketh universally to man.&quot; Paine gives an example when he condemns the doctrine of loving the enemy, in which he states, &quot;We imitate the moral character of the Creator by forbearing with each other, for he forbears with all.&quot;

<text>The black-winged red bishop (Euplectes hordeaceus), formerly known in southern Africa as the fire-crowned bishop, is a resident breeding bird species in tropical Africa from Senegal to Sudan and south to Angola, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Mozambique.

==Taxonomy==
The black-winged red bishop was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Loxia hordeacea&quot;. Linnaeus mistakenly specified the type location as India but this has been corrected to Senegal. The specific epithet &quot;hordeaceus&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;of barley&quot; from &quot;hordeum&quot; meaning &quot;barley&quot;. The black-winged red bishop is now one of 18 species in the genus &quot;Euplectes&quot; that was introduced in 1829 by the English naturalist William Swainson.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;E. h. hordeaceus&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – Mauritania, Senegal and Gambia to west Sudan, DR Congo, Tanzania and south to Angola, Zimbabwe and Mozambique
* &quot;E. h. craspedopterus&quot; Bonaparte, 1850 – south Sudan, southwest Ethiopia, Uganda and west Kenya

==Description==
The black-winged red bishop is a stocky bird. The breeding male is scarlet apart from his black face, belly and wings and brown tail. The conical bill is thick and black. He displays prominently, singing high-pitched twitters from tall grass, puffing out his feathers or performing a slow hovering display flight.

The non-breeding male is yellow-brown, streaked above and shading to whitish below. It has a whitish supercilium. It resembles non-breeding male northern red bishop, but is darker and has black wings. Females are similar, but paler. Young birds have wider pale fringes on their flight feathers.

==Distribution and habitat==
This common weaver occurs in a range of open country, especially tall grassland and often near water. It builds a spherical woven nest in tall grass. 2-4 eggs are laid.

It is a gregarious species which feeds on seed, grain and some insects.

<text>Alexander E. Barkan (August 9, 1909 – October 18, 1990) was head of the AFL-CIO&#x27;s Committee on Political Education from 1963 until 1982. During the Watergate hearings, it became known that Barkan was one of the original members of Nixon&#x27;s Enemies List.

==Career==
Born in Bayonne, New Jersey, Barkin claimed to have started voting at the age of 15 or 16 -- voting 20 to 25 times an election because the judges were controlled by Frank Hague, the Democratic mayor of Jersey City, N.J. He attained degrees in political science and economics from the University of Chicago in 1933. He taught high school English at night in Bayonne and became actively involved in labor unions right after college. In 1937 he left teaching to work as a full-time volunteer with the Textile Workers Organizing Committee. During World War II he served on the USS Alabama as a radioman. He was fond of relating how he delivered all the votes on USS Alabama for F.D.R. After the war he returned to New Jersey as a staff member of the Textile Workers Union.

In 1955, with the merger of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organization Mr. Barkan became assistant director of the AFL-CIO&#x27;s political arm, COPE. He was appointed director by George Meany in 1966 giving him a major say in the distribution of a substantial amount of money and number of volunteers, which gave him major influence in the Democratic Party. He was also known as a gifted orator and tireless union advocate. Al, as he was generally known was well respected by his friends and enemies alike for his accomplishments, integrity, and directness. Lane Kirkland, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. said of him &quot;Al Barkan was one of labor&#x27;s most dedicated and most unforgettable stalwarts. Few achieve the rank of legend, but Al did. He left an indelible memory with all of us and his work inspired more than one generation of trade unionists to continue their work &#x27;on to victory.&#x27;&quot; Mr. Barkan often used &quot;on to victory&quot; to rally his troops in electing pro union candidates.

A lifelong supporter of the Democratic Party, in 1972 he denounced George McGovern and his followers for turning the party into the &quot;party of acid, amnesty, and abortion.&quot; His obituary in The New York Times would note, &quot;His outspoken, crusty manner and opposition to party changes intended to benefit minorities and women alienated many Democrats.&quot; His opposition to Democratic Party reforms intended to broaden representation prompted him in 1972 to declare, &quot;We aren&#x27;t going to let these Harvard-Berkeley Camelots take over our party.&quot; 

He retired in 1981 but stayed involved visiting and speaking to labor union groups almost until the end of his life. He died in 1990, survived at that time by his wife of 46 years, Helen Stickno, his daughters, Lois Wolkowitz and Carol Alt and four grandchildren, Matthew Alt, Allyson Alt, Rachel Wolkowitz Mack, and Jacob Wolkowitz.

While leader Brian Wilson produced and arranged the rock songs, he left it to Dick Reynolds (an arranger for the Four Freshmen, a group Wilson idolized) to arrange the 41-piece orchestral backings on the traditional songs to which the Beach Boys would apply their vocals. One single was released from the album, the original song &quot;The Man with All the Toys&quot; backed with the group&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Blue Christmas&quot;. &quot;Little Saint Nick&quot;, a single which had already been released the previous year, was included on the album.

In 1977, the Beach Boys attempted to follow the album with &quot;Merry Christmas from the Beach Boys&quot;, but it was rejected by their label. The entire &quot;Christmas Album&quot; plus selections from the &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; sessions were later assembled for the 1998 compilation &quot;Ultimate Christmas&quot;.

The none bonus track CD version have Little Saint Nick as a remix (which is the single version) instead of the original album version.

==Background==
The album was devised as a response to Phil Spector&#x27;s &quot;A Christmas Gift for You from Philles Records&quot; (1963), an album Brian had attended recording sessions for. He played piano on the song &quot;Santa Claus Is Coming to Town&quot; but was dismissed by Spector due to his &quot;substandard&quot; piano playing. Original album cover photo by George Jerman for Capitol Photo Studio. The a-side consists mostly of original Christmas-themed rock songs penned by Brian Wilson and Mike Love, while the b-side features both secular and religious Christmas standards with orchestral accompaniment directed by Dick Reynolds.

==Recording==
With the exception of &quot;Little Saint Nick&quot;, sessions for the album spanned June 18–30, 1964, one month after the &quot;All Summer Long&quot; album was completed. &quot;Christmas Day&quot; is the first Beach Boys song to feature a lead vocal from Al Jardine.

The album was released in mono and stereo; the stereo mix, prepared by engineer Chuck Britz, would be the last true stereo mix for a Beach Boys album until 1968&#x27;s &quot;Friends&quot;.

In addition to orchestral renditions of &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; and the original Wilson composition &quot;Christmas Eve&quot; which never received vocal overdubs, outtakes of the &quot;All Summer Long&quot; track &quot;Little Honda&quot; and &quot;The Beach Boys Today!&quot; song &quot;Don&#x27;t Hurt My Little Sister&quot; were recorded in between June sessions.

==Reception==
In a retrospective review, AllMusic&#x27;s Jason Ankeny stated: &quot;Brian Wilson&#x27;s pop genius is well suited to classic Yuletide fare, and the group delivers lush performances of standards ranging from &#x27;Frosty the Snowman&#x27; to &#x27;White Christmas&#x27; as well as more contemporary material like &#x27;The Man With All the Toys&#x27; and &#x27;Blue Christmas.&#x27;&quot;

While interviewing Wilson for a promotional radio special in 1964, Jack Wagner remarked that Wilson&#x27;s decision to sing solo on a version of &quot;Blue Christmas&quot; could be &quot;the start of a whole new career,&quot; to which Wilson responded &quot;I don’t know. It could and it couldn&#x27;t. I really don’t know.&quot; Referring to the standards which he believed &quot;proved that the Beach Boys&#x27; vocal power was bigger and more agile than the surf and hot rod records [and] staking a claim for wider musical terrain,&quot; author Luis Sanchez reflected: &quot;&quot;The Beach Boys&#x27; Christmas Album&quot; music shows a quality of aesthetic selectivity that none of the group&#x27;s records that came before it do, aspiring not just to assimilate one of pop&#x27;s stock ideas, but also enabling Brian to make one of his biggest artistic advances.&quot;

On April 6, 1982, the album was certified gold by the RIAA, selling more than 500,000 units.

== &quot;Ultimate Christmas&quot; ==
Released in 1998, &quot;Ultimate Christmas&quot; is a compilation containing all of the twelve tracks from the original Christmas LP in stereo. Many bonus tracks were added, including the 1974 single &quot;Child of Winter&quot; and several previously unreleased tracks from the aborted 1977 album &quot;Merry Christmas from the Beach Boys&quot;.

<text>Arzachel is a relatively young lunar impact crater located in the highlands in the south-central part of the visible Moon, close to the zero meridian (the visible center of the Moon). It lies to the south of the crater Alphonsus, and together with Ptolemaeus further north the three form a prominent line of craters to the east of Mare Nubium. The smaller Alpetragius lies to the northwest, and Thebit is to the southwest along the edge of the mare.

== Description ==

Arzachel is remarkably clear in its structure and a favorite telescope viewing subject for advanced amateur astronomers. The rim of Arzachel shows little sign of wear and has a detailed structure on the interior, especially on the slightly higher eastern rim. There is a rough outer that joins a ridge running from the north rim to southern rim of Alphonsus.

The rugged central peak of Arzachel is prominent, rising 1.5 kilometers above the floor, and is somewhat offset to the west with a bowed curve from south to north-northeast. The floor is relatively flat, except for some irregularities in the southwestern quadrant of the crater. There is a rille system named the Rimae Arzachel that runs from the northern wall to the southeast rim. A small crater lies prominently in the floor to the east of the central peak, with a pair of smaller craterlets located nearby.

Arzachel is a crater of Lower (Early) Imbrian age.

==Names==

Arzachel is a Latinization of the name of the Arab astronomer and mathematician Abū Ishāq Ibrāhīm al-Zarqālī. Like many of the craters on the Moon&#x27;s near side, Arzachel was named by Giovanni Riccioli, whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized. Earlier lunar cartographers had given the feature different names: Michael van Langren&#x27;s 1645 map calls it &quot;Annae, Reg. Fran.&quot;, after Anne, the Regent of France, and Johannes Hevelius called it &quot;Mons Cragus&quot; after one of the Mount Craguses of the ancient world.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Arzachel.

<doc id="711484" wikidata="Q3433787" url="?curid=711484" title="River Raisin">
<text>The River Raisin (Ottawa: Nummasepee, &quot;River of Sturgeon&quot;) is a river in southeast Michigan, United States, that flows in a generally easterly direction through glacial sediments before emptying into Lake Erie. The River Raisin drainage basin covers approximately in the Michigan counties of Monroe, Lenawee, Washtenaw, Jackson, and Hillsdale, along with Fulton County in northwest Ohio.

Today, the land within its bounds is primarily used for agriculture, and light industry. Historically, the river served as a canoe transportation route for various Native American tribes, and for French Canadian Voyageurs. The river&#x27;s English name comes from the French (translated as &quot;River of Grapes&quot;), in reference to the wild grapes growing along its banks.

==History and geography==
The River Raisin was used by local Potawatomi and Wyandot peoples, who had a portage between the upper river to gain access into the Grand and Kalamazoo rivers flowing west toward Lake Michigan. The river is still classified as canoeable throughout its length. But, low gradient, access issues, frequent logjams in the upper reaches, and 22 dams on the mainstream limit its recreational use. 

The first European settlers along the river were French Canadians, who in the 1780s developed their traditional ribbon farms in Frenchtown. These had narrow fronts on the river so that more farmers would have access, with deep rectangular lots reaching back from the river. Now part of Monroe, Michigan, this area is still the most populous area along the river. The resort area of Irish Hills lies in the uppermost region of the watershed, which includes 429 lakes and ponds. The largest of these is the Lake Columbia.
During the winter of 1813 as part of the War of 1812, the Battle of Frenchtown occurred near the river. Great Britain and their allied Native American troops under the command of British General Henry Procter and Native American chiefs Roundhead, Walks in Water, and Split Log, fought against a division of ill-trained Kentucky infantry and militia under command of General James Winchester. Cut off and surrounded, and facing total slaughter, Winchester surrendered with British assurances of safety for the prisoners. The British and Potawatomi allies marched those who could walk to Detroit, to be held as prisoners of war. 

The next day, however, many of the severely wounded prisoners left in Frenchtown were killed by the Native Americans allies of the British. The Massacre of the River Raisin became a rallying cry (&quot;Remember the Raisin&quot;) for Americans in the war, particularly for Kentuckians. United States troops returned in the spring to drive the British from Michigan forever. The original battlefield was preserved for years as a county park in Monroe, Michigan. It has several monuments erected to the Kentucky soldiers who died there. 

On October 12, 2010, the land was transferred from the state to the federal government. By Congressional authorization, it is the only National Battlefield Park designating a battlefield of the War of 1812 - the River Raisin National Battlefield Park.

Since industrialization and intensified agriculture, the river has been polluted by industrial wastes and agricultural runoff. While cleanup efforts have mitigated some of the pollution, difficult-to-remove PCBs continue to constitute a hazardous waste. An established Area of Concern covers only of the watershed at the mouth of the river, much of which is devoted to industrial and harbor use, including the Ford Motor Company plant, Detroit Edison Monroe powerplant, and the Port of Monroe. Environmental authorities advise people not to eat some species of fish from the river, if taken below the outlet of the Monroe Dam.

The river has many small dams to control water flow. These were erected to power the many paper mills constructed along it in the mid-1800s during the lumber boom. They are also products of Henry Ford&#x27;s rural industry program. While most of the dams are in Monroe, the most significant one is located in Dundee, Michigan. The Port of Monroe was constructed near the mouth of the river in the 1930s, as a needed infrastructure project sponsored by the President Franklin D. Roosevelt administration during the Great Depression.

Flooding along the river has three causes: heavy rains, ice dams developing during spring break-up, and on-shore winds pushing Lake Erie waters upstream. The worst flood was recorded on March 16, 1982, at , compared to an average mean flow of . Flooding affects mostly the lowest portions of the river. By contrast on July 13, 1988, during a severe drought, a measuring station found of water flow.

Most of the flow of the river is diverted through the Detroit Edison plant and discharged into Plum Creek. Previously it was discharged into the river, but it is now diverted to limit additional pollution of the river mouth area. The power plant&#x27;s peak use of of water exceeds the river&#x27;s average flow of , so on some occasions, water is drawn upstream from Lake Erie into the plant. The high level of industrial water use is thought to kill large numbers of fish in the intake screens and to make fish migration from the river into the Great Lakes almost impossible.

In 2013 U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg, along with the entire Michigan delegation, introduced a resolution (H. Res. 37, 113th Congress) to honor the 200th anniversary of the battles at the River Raisin.

===Tributaries===

In addition to the river forming from the Upper River Raisin and the South Branch River Raisin, the following streams flow into the River Raisin:
* Goose Creek
* Black Creek
* Evans Creek
* Iron Creek
* Little River Raisin
* Macon Creek
* Saline River

===Islands===
*Sisters Island (Michigan)
*Sterling Island
*Strong Island (Michigan)

The Eagle Island Marsh is part of the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge.

==Flora and fauna==
The River Raisin is home to &quot;warm-water&quot; fish including bluegill, white sucker, channel catfish, walleye, carp, white bass, black buffalo, freshwater drum and smallmouth bass. Very few fish migrate between the river and the Great Lakes because they are blocked by the seven dams in Monroe, as well as the power plant intakes. Bird species use the area as part of the migratory flyway along eastern Lake Erie; they include bald eagles, sandhill cranes, ducks and seagulls. Invasive fauna include zebra mussels and rusty crayfish. The threatened American lotus is present in Eagle Island Marsh, but it must compete with several invasive plant species in the watershed, including flowering rush, Eurasian milfoil, curlyleaf pondweed, &quot;Phragmites&quot; and purple loosestrife.

==Communities==

Cities and villages along the river include:

* Monroe, Michigan
* Dundee, Michigan
* Petersburg, Michigan
* Deerfield, Michigan
* Blissfield, Michigan
* Adrian, Michigan
* Tecumseh, Michigan
* Clinton, Michigan
* Manchester, Michigan
* Brooklyn, Michigan

==Crossings==

River Raisin crossings are located in communities within four counties of Michigan.

<doc id="711485" wikidata="Q7069668" url="?curid=711485" title="Numerical tower">
<text>In Scheme, the numerical tower is a set of data types that represent numbers and a logic for their hierarchical organisation.
Each type in the tower conceptually &quot;sits on&quot; a more fundamental type, so an integer is a rational number and a number, but the converse is not necessarily true, i.e. not every number is an integer. This asymmetry implies that a language can safely allow implicit coercions of numerical types—without creating semantic problems—in only one direction: coercing an integer to a rational loses no information and will never influence the value returned by a function, but to coerce most reals to an integer would alter any relevant computation (e.g., the real 1/3 does not equal any integer) and is thus impermissible.

== In Scheme ==
Principally, the numerical tower is designed to codify the set theoretic properties of numbers in an easy-to-implement language facility: every integer is a rational with an implicit denominator of 1, and all reals are complex with an implicit imaginary part of 0. Practically, the implementation may save time and space by ignoring these properties unless they become arithmetically relevant, and also may correspondingly improve the efficiency of its representation when reducing numerical values to their canonical representation by eliminating negligible components of a number.

The most generic type, codice_1, is somewhat confusingly named: it exists to capture all mathematical values whose type is more general than complex, but which are still usable with standard mathematical operations, as defined by Scheme. Thus it captures, for example, positive and negative infinity (codice_2 and codice_3, the significand here meaning approximation up to cardinality), since those are mathematical objects to which at least some numerical operations may validly apply (e.g. one can add to or multiply by infinity, yielding infinity; or compare cardinality against infinity, with infinity always being greater than any finite value). On a more technical level, codice_1 in Lisp simply provides a place in the type hierarchy for the kinds of non-strictly-numerical values defined by IEEE 754.

The Scheme programming language defines all its arithmetic within this model. Some implementations may extend or adapt the tower. Kawa, a Scheme implementation for the JVM, extends the tower to include both quaternions and quantities, with quantities being a way of subtyping numerical values with units; e.g. a number of grams cannot meaningfully be added to a number of metres because via quantities numbers inherit logic derived from dimensional analysis to govern their meaning in relation to and thus valid arithmetical interactions with each other.

Another common variation is to support both exact and inexact versions of the tower or parts of it; R7RS Scheme recommends but does not strictly require this of implementations. In this case, similar semantics are used to determine the permissibility of implicit coercion: inexactness is a contagious property of numbers, and any numerical operation involving both exact and inexact values must yield inexact return values of at least the same precision as the most precise inexact number appearing in the expression, unless the precision is practically infinite (e.g. containing a detectable repetend), or unless it can be proven that the precision of the result of the operation is independent of the inexactness of any of its operands (for example, a series of multiplications where at least one multiplicand is 0).

== In other languages ==
Most programming languages and language implementations do not support a Scheme-like numerical tower, though some languages provide limited or inconsistent support if implementation simplicity permits. Python, for example, provides a similar structure via PEP3141, citing Scheme&#x27;s example, though in practice rational numbers (codice_5) must be imported from their own module, and both rational and complex numbers use slightly variant syntax from normal number literals, since Python&#x27;s syntax is less explicit than Lisp&#x27;s.

Thus in the following Scheme examples we see:

1 -2 +3
⇒ 1
⇒ -2
⇒ 3
1/3
⇒ 1/3
72/6+8/3i
⇒ 12+8/3i ; coercion: canonical form
(+ 3+2i 2-2i)
⇒ 5 ; coercion: canonical form
(- 3-62/32i 1+inf.0i)
⇒ 2-inf.0i ; coercion: infinite cardinality
(&gt; 3+0/2i 3)
⇒ #f ; coercion: 3 ≯ 3

While in the following Python examples we see:

1; -2; +3
⇒ 1
⇒ -2
⇒ 3
1/3
⇒ 0.3333333333333333
inf = float(&#x27;inf&#x27;) # infinity not first-class
from fractions import Fraction
x = Fraction(1, 3)
y = Fraction(2, 3)
x + y
⇒ Fraction(1, 1) # no coercion
(3+2j)
⇒ (3+2j)
complex(x, inf)
⇒ (0.3333333333333333+infj) # coercion: equality violated
a = 1/3
b = Fraction(1, 3)
caz = complex(a, 0)
cbz = complex(b, 0)
a == b
⇒ False
caz == cbz
⇒ True # proof of equality violation
complex(x + y, -inf)
⇒ (1-infj) # coercion: equality preserved
(3+0j) &gt; 3
⇒ Traceback (most recent call last):
⇒ File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt; # no coercion: type error
⇒ TypeError: &#x27;&gt;&#x27; not supported between instances of &#x27;complex&#x27; and &#x27;int&#x27;
In the Python examples, we can see that numerical issues freely arise with an inconsistent application of the semantics of its type coercion. While codice_6 in Python is treated as a call to divide 1 by 3, yielding a float, the inclusion of rationals inside a complex number, though clearly permissible, implicitly coerces them from rationals into floats or ints, even in cases where this is incorrect.

Smalltalk is another programming language that follows this model, but it has ArithmeticValue and Magnitude as superclasses of Number.

The Numerical Tower of Scheme was inspired by the hierarchy of numeric types in Common Lisp.

<text>Theodor Leschetizky (sometimes spelled Leschetitzky; ; 22 June 1830 – 14 November 1915) was an Austrian–Polish pianist, professor, and composer. He was born in Landshut in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, then a crown land of Austria-Hungary.

==Life==
Theodor Leschetizky was born on 22 June 1830 at the estate of the family of Count Potocki in Landshut, Austrian Galicia. Joseph Leschetizky, his father, was a gifted pianist and music teacher of Viennese birth. His mother Thérèse von Ullmann was a gifted singer of German origin. His father gave him his first piano lessons and then took him to Vienna to study with Carl Czerny. At age eleven, he performed a Czerny piano concerto in Landshut, with Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart, the son of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, conducting. At the age of fifteen he started to tutor his first students. By the age of eighteen he was a well-known virtuoso in Vienna and beyond. His composition teacher was Simon Sechter, an eminent professor who was the teacher of many other successful musicians.

At the invitation of his friend Anton Rubinstein, he went to St. Petersburg to teach in the court of the Grand Duchess Yelena Pavlovna. Remaining there from 1852 to 1877, he was head of the piano department and one of the founders of the St. Petersburg Conservatory of Music in 1862. While in Russia he married one of his most famous students, Anna Essipova, the second of his four wives, with whom he had two children; one of them was his daughter, the well-known singer and teacher, Theresa, the other was his son Robert.

In 1878 he returned to Vienna and began teaching there, creating one of the most eminent private piano schools in the world. Promising pianists flocked to his villa in the Währing Cottage District on Karl-Ludwig-Straße, Vienna, coming from all over the world, with a great many from the United States, among them singer Clara Clemens, the daughter of Mark Twain.

From 1904 to 1908, he was assisted by one of his students, Ethel Newcomb, an experience which proved a fertile ground for background research for her 1921 book, &quot;Leschetizky as I Knew Him&quot;. Concert pianist and teacher Edwin Hughes was his assistant in 1909 and 1910.

He taught until the age of 85, thereafter leaving for Dresden, where he died on 14 November 1915. He was later buried at the Vienna Central Cemetery.

==Motto==
Leschetizky&#x27;s motto: &quot;No life without art, no art without life!&quot;

== Leschetizky&#x27;s descendants ==
He was survived by a son, Robert (Dresden), whose family returned to Bad Ischl after his death. His descendants still live in Bad Ischl and there is a Leschetizky Villa on Leschetizky-Straße, the summer resort where he often vacationed with his friend Johannes Brahms.

Leschetizky had a granddaughter, Ilse Leschetizky (1910–1997), who was a distinguished pianist and teacher. One of her daughters, Margret Tautschnig, continues the Leschetizky tradition with the &quot;Leschetizky-Verein Österreich&quot; in Bad Ischl. This organisation was co-founded by the Belgian pianist Peter Ritzen.

== Leschetizky the composer ==
Leschetizky composed over a hundred characteristic piano pieces, two operas: &quot;Die Brüder von San Marco&quot; and &quot;Die Erste Falte&quot;, thirteen songs and a one-movement piano concerto. Opus numbers were given to 49 works.

Although his piano pieces are primarily smaller works in the salon music vein, they are expressively lyrical on the one hand while exploiting the piano&#x27;s technical capabilities to great effect on the other. Most of his music has been out of print since the early twentieth century except for the &quot;Andante Finale&quot;, Op. 13 (a paraphrase for piano left hand on the famous sextet from the opera &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; by Donizetti); and &quot;Les deux alouettes&quot;, Op. 2, No. 1.

== Leschetizky the teacher ==
His most important legacy is as the main teacher of numerous great pianists such as Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Aline van Barentzen, Ernesto Bérumen, Alexander Brailowsky, Agnes Gardner Eyre, Ignaz Friedman, Ossip Gabrilowitsch, Florence Parr Gere, Katharine Goodson, Mark Hambourg, Helen Hopekirk, Mieczysław Horszowski, Edwin Hughes, Frank La Forge, Mabel Lander, Ethel Leginska, Marguerite Melville Liszniewska, Frank Merrick, Benno Moiseiwitsch, Elly Ney, Marie Novello, John Powell, Auguste de Radwan, Zudie Harris Reinecke, Gertrude Ross, Jadwiga Sarnecka, Artur Schnabel, Richard Singer, Józef Śliwiński, Bertha Tapper, Isabelle Vengerova, Maria Wilhelmj, Vita Witek, Paul Wittgenstein, Fannie Bloomfield Zeisler, Agnes Hope Pillsbury, and many others.

<text>Beatrice Gladys Lillie, Lady Peel (29 May 1894 – 20 January 1989), known as Bea Lillie, was a Canadian-born British actress, singer and comedic performer.

She began to perform as a child with her mother and sister. She made her West End debut in 1914 and soon gained notice in revues and light comedies, becoming known for her parodies of old-fashioned, flowery performing styles and absurd songs and sketches. She debuted in New York in 1924 and two years later starred in her first film, continuing to perform in both the US and UK. She was associated with revues staged by André Charlot and works of Noël Coward and Cole Porter, and frequently was paired with Gertrude Lawrence, Bert Lahr and Jack Haley.

During World War II, Lillie was an inveterate entertainer of the troops. She won a Tony Award in 1953 for her revue &quot;An Evening with Beatrice Lillie&quot;.

==Early life and career==

Lillie was born in Toronto to Irish-born John Lillie and his wife Lucie Ann (née Shaw). She had an elder sister, Muriel (1893–1973), at one time an aspiring concert pianist who later played the piano at silent movie houses, married firstly to the Egyptologist, stage designer and writer Arthur Weigall, and secondly to Sir Brian Dean Paul, 6th Baronet of Rodborough. Her father was a cigar seller at the time of Lillie&#x27;s birth, later working as a guard at the Toronto city jail. He had been a soldier in the British Army stationed in India, and on his honourable discharge went to Toronto rather than returning to Ireland. Lucie Ann Lillie (who had changed her name from &quot;Lucy Ann&quot;), who had &quot;a modest reputation as a concert singer&quot; was the daughter of a Manchester clothing retailer who had retired to a farm outside Toronto.

Lillie performed in Ontario towns as part of a family trio with her mother and older sister, Muriel, her father running the family home in Toronto as a boarding house in their absence. Eventually, her mother took the girls to London, England, where she made her West End début in the 1914 show &quot;Not Likely!&quot; Lillie followed this with about a dozen London shows and musical revues until 1922. In her revues, Lillie developed her sketches, songs and parodies. These won her lavish praise from &quot;The New York Times&quot; after her 1924 Broadway début in &quot;André Charlot&#x27;s Revue of 1924&quot;, starring Gertrude Lawrence.

In some of her best known bits, she solemnly parodied the flowery performing style of earlier decades, mining such songs as &quot;There Are Fairies at the Bottom of Our Garden&quot; and &quot;Mother Told Me So&quot; for every double entendre. Other numbers (&quot;Get Yourself a Geisha&quot; and &quot;Snoops the Lawyer&quot;) showcased her exquisite sense of the absurd. Her performing in such comedy routines as &quot;One Dozen Double Damask Dinner Napkins&quot;, (in which an increasingly flummoxed matron attempts to purchase said napkins) earned her the frequently used sobriquet of &quot;Funniest Woman in the World&quot;.

In 1926, she returned to New York City to perform. While in the United States, she starred in her first film, &quot;Exit Smiling&quot; (1926), opposite fellow Canadian Jack Pickford, the younger brother of Mary Pickford. This was followed by a small role in &quot;The Show of Shows&quot; (1929) and her only starring role in a sound feature film, &quot;Are You There?&quot; (1930). After a 1927 tour on the Orpheum Circuit, Lillie returned to Broadway in Vaudeville at the Palace Theatre in 1928 and performed there frequently after that.

==Later career==

From the late 1920s until the approach of World War II, Lillie repeatedly crossed the Atlantic to perform on both continents. She played at the London Palladium in 1928. On stage, she was long associated with the works of Noël Coward, beginning with &quot;This Year of Grace&quot; (1928) and giving the first public performance of &quot;Mad Dogs and Englishmen&quot; in Coward&#x27;s &quot;The Third Little Show&quot; (1931). Cole Porter and others wrote songs for her. With Bobby Clark, she appeared in London and New York in &quot;Walk a Little Faster&quot;, in 1935 she starred on Broadway in &quot;At Home Abroad&quot;, and in 1936 she starred in New York in &quot;The Show Is On&quot; with Bert Lahr.

She returned to Broadway in 1939 in &quot;Set to Music&quot; and in 1944 in &quot;Seven Lively Arts&quot;. The same year, Lillie appeared in the film &quot;On Approval&quot;. Other Broadway appearances included &quot;Inside USA&quot; (1948), &quot;An Evening with Beatrice Lillie&quot; (1952) (Broadway and London), &quot;Ziegfeld Follies of 1957&quot;, &quot;Auntie Mame&quot; (1958) (Broadway and London) and &quot;High Spirits&quot; (1964). Her few other film appearances included a cameo role as a revivalist in &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (1956) and as Mrs. Meers (a white slaver) in &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot; (1967), her last film.

After seeing &quot;An Evening with Beatrice Lillie&quot;, critic Ronald Barker wrote &quot;Other generations may have their Mistinguett and their Marie Lloyd. We have our Beatrice Lillie, and seldom have we seen such a display of perfect talent.&quot; Sheridan Morley noted in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; that &quot;Lillie&#x27;s great talents were the arched eyebrow, the curled lip, the fluttering eyelid, the tilted chin, the ability to suggest, even in apparently innocent material, the possible double entendre&quot;.

==Marriage and children==
Lillie was married on 20 January 1920 at the church of St. Paul, Drayton Bassett, Fazeley, Staffordshire, England, to Robert Peel, son of Sir Robert Peel, 4th Baronet, and at the time a used car salesman. The Peel family had &quot;fallen on hard times&quot;, and Peel &quot;had little else to offer besides the title of 5th baronet&quot;. He inherited the title on his father&#x27;s death in 1925. Peel was an enthusiastic gambler and, due to his limited means, he generally used his wife&#x27;s money; on their honeymoon in Monte Carlo, he lost all their money gambling.

Robert Peel had expensive tastes, and the couple were entirely dependent on her theatrical income throughout their marriage. Following the marriage, she was known in private life as Lady Peel. She eventually separated from her husband, but the couple never divorced. He died in 1934, aged 35. Their only child, Sir Robert Peel, 6th Baronet (1920–1942), was killed in action aboard in Colombo Harbour, Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka), in 1942.

During World War II, Lillie was an inveterate entertainer of the troops. Before she went on stage one day, she learned that her son had been killed in action. In 1948, while touring in the show &quot;Inside USA&quot;, she met singer/actor John Philip Huck. He was a former US Marine, almost three decades younger, who became her friend and companion for the rest of their lives, and she boosted his career. As Lillie&#x27;s mental abilities declined at the end of her career, she relied more and more on Huck, whose intentions and loyalty to her were viewed with suspicion by her friends. She suffered a stroke in the mid-1970s, and in 1977, a conservator was appointed over her property; her medical bills were exceeding her annual income by nearly double. She retired to England.

==Death==
Lillie died in 1989, aged 94, at Henley-on-Thames. Huck died of a heart attack the next day, and the two were buried in the churchyard of St Margaret&#x27;s in Harpsden, Oxfordshire, near Henley-on-Thames.

<doc id="711500" wikidata="Q791628" url="?curid=711500" title="Beach Boys Concert">
<text>Beach Boys Concert is the first live album by the American rock band the Beach Boys, released on October 19, 1964. It is their seventh album in all, and their third alone in the same year. It was their first of two chart-topping albums in the US (the other was their 1974 greatest hit compilation, &quot;Endless Summer&quot;), as well as the first live album to top pop music record charts, maintaining its position for four weeks during a sixty-two-week chart stay, and becoming another gold seller.

The album was recorded live at the Sacramento Memorial Auditorium in Sacramento, California, though it received heavy post-production treatment. Because Brian Wilson was about to vacate his position in the live group, and would only perform sporadically with them over the course of the next three decades, it is one of the few live documents of the original line-up of the Beach Boys that has been officially released.

In 2014, &quot;Live in Sacramento 1964&quot; was released, containing additional performances from these concert dates.

==Recording==
The album includes several songs that the Beach Boys regularly performed live but had not previously included on an album, such as &quot;The Little Old Lady from Pasadena&quot;, &quot;Long Tall Texan&quot;, &quot;Monster Mash&quot;, &quot;Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow&quot;, &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, &quot;Graduation Day&quot;, and &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot;. Alongside those were a sampling of their hits, such as &quot;Hawaii&quot;, &quot;Fun, Fun, Fun&quot;, and &quot;I Get Around&quot;. &quot;Little Deuce Coupe&quot;, &quot;In My Room&quot;, &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; and &quot;Long Tall Texan&quot; dated from the December 21, 1963 show.

==Variations==
A truncated version was released on Pickwick Records as &quot;Wow! Great Concert!&quot; &quot;Beach Boys Concert&quot; (Capitol (S)TAO 2198) When their albums were remastered for CD in 1990 (and again in 2001), &quot;Beach Boys Concert&quot; was paired on CD with &quot;Live in London&quot;, with bonus tracks from both periods.

<text>An arm ball is a type of delivery in cricket. It is a variation delivery bowled by an off spin bowler or slow left-arm orthodox bowler. It is the finger spin equivalent of a wrist spinner&#x27;s &quot;slider&quot; or &quot;zooter&quot;.

In contrast to the stock delivery, an arm ball is delivered by rolling the fingers down the back of the ball on release. This puts backspin onto the ball, which does not turn appreciably off the pitch. Instead, it travels straight on in the direction of the arm. By keeping the seam upright, the bowler can also hope to obtain some outswing away from the right-handed batsman, thereby confusing the batsman who expects the ball to turn.

The arm ball is often used as a surprise variation by an off spinner who is turning the ball considerably. A complacent or poorly skilled batsman playing for the expected spin can be taken by surprise and get out bowled or lbw, or edge the ball with the outside edge of the bat to offer a catch to the wicket-keeper or slip fielders. Offspinners Harbhajan Singh, Graeme Swann and Mohammad Hafeez have excelled in bowling arm balls.

The arm ball has also been employed with a great deal of success over the years by left-arm orthodox bowlers. In this case, the stock ball will turn away from the right-handed batsman and the arm-ball would swing in, allowing the bowler to beat the inside edge of the bat and attack the stumps. Hedley Verity in particular was well known for his fast inswinging arm-ball, often bowled at yorker length.

Daniel Vettori, Rangana Herath and Derek Underwood are other examples of left-arm orthodox bowlers renowned for use of an inswinging arm ball to good effect. Vettori famously bowled Darren Maddy with a perfect arm ball at the Oval Test Match of 1999. Having set up Maddy with two balls breaking away from him, Vettori then bowled a perfectly disguised arm ball. Thinking the ball was another stock delivery, Maddy left it, only to see it swing in and strike his off-stump. Some recent examples of left-arm orthodox spinners who have excelled in bowling arm balls are Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Akeal Hosein, Shakib Al Hasan and Sophie Ecclestone.

<text>Scrub typhus or bush typhus is a form of typhus caused by the intracellular parasite &quot;Orientia tsutsugamushi&quot;, a Gram-negative α-proteobacterium of family Rickettsiaceae first isolated and identified in 1930 in Japan.

Although the disease is similar in presentation to other forms of typhus, its pathogen is no longer included in genus &quot;Rickettsia&quot; with the typhus bacteria proper, but in &quot;Orientia&quot;. The disease is thus frequently classified separately from the other typhi.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Signs and symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pain, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms. More virulent strains of &quot;O. tsutsugamushi&quot; can cause hemorrhaging and intravascular coagulation. Morbilliform rash, eschar, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathies are typical signs. Leukopenia and abnormal liver function tests are commonly seen in the early phase of the illness. Pneumonitis, encephalitis, and myocarditis occur in the late phase of illness. It has particularly been shown to be the most common cause of acute encephalitis syndrome in Bihar, India.

== Causes ==
Scrub typhus is transmitted by some species of trombiculid mites (&quot;chiggers&quot;, particularly &quot;Leptotrombidium deliense&quot;), 
which are found in areas of heavy scrub vegetation. The mites feed on infected rodent hosts and subsequently transmit the parasite to other rodents and humans. The bite of this mite leaves a characteristic black eschar that is useful to the doctor for making the diagnosis.

Scrub typhus is endemic to a part of the world known as the tsutsugamushi triangle (after &quot;O. tsutsugamushi&quot;). This extends from northern Japan and far-eastern Russia in the north, to the territories around the Solomon Sea into northern Australia in the south, and to Pakistan and Afghanistan in the west. It may also be endemic in parts of South America.

The precise incidence of the disease is unknown, as diagnostic facilities are not available in much of its large native range, which spans vast regions of equatorial jungle to the subtropics. In rural Thailand and Laos, murine and scrub typhus account for around a quarter of all adults presenting to hospital with fever and negative blood cultures. The incidence in Japan has fallen over the past few decades, probably due to land development driving decreasing exposure, and many prefectures report fewer than 50 cases per year.

It affects females more than males in Korea, but not in Japan, which may be because sex-differentiated cultural roles have women tending garden plots more often, thus being exposed to vegetation inhabited by chiggers.
The incidence is increasing in the southern part of the Indian subcontinent and in northern areas around Darjeeling.

== Diagnosis ==
In endemic areas, diagnosis is generally made on clinical grounds alone. However, overshadowing of the diagnosis is quite often as the clinical symptoms overlap with other infectious diseases such as dengue fever, paratyphoid, and pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO). If the eschar can be identified, it is quite diagnostic of scrub typhus, but this can be unreliable on dark skin, and moreover, the site of eschar which is usually where the mite bites is often located in covered areas. Unless it is actively searched for, the eschar can easily be missed. History of mite bite is often absent since the bite does not inflict pain and the mites are almost too small to be seen by the naked eye. Usually, scrub typhus is often labelled as PUO in remote endemic areas, since blood culture is often negative, yet it can be treated effectively with chloramphenicol. Where doubt exists, the diagnosis may be confirmed by a laboratory test such as serology. Again, this is often unavailable in most endemic areas, since the serological test involved is not included in the routine screening tests for PUO, especially in Burma (Myanmar).

The choice of laboratory test is not straightforward, and all currently available tests have their limitations. The cheapest and most easily available serological test is the Weil-Felix test, but this is notoriously unreliable. The best test is indirect immunofluorescence, but the main limitation of this method is the availability of fluorescent microscopes, which are not often available in resource-poor settings where scrub typhus is endemic. Indirect immunoperoxidase, a modification of the standard IFA method, can be used with a light microscope, and the results of these tests are comparable to those from IFA. Rapid bedside kits have been described that produce a result within one hour, but the availability of these tests is severely limited by their cost. Serological methods are most reliable when a four-fold rise in antibody titre is found. If the patient is from a nonendemic area, then diagnosis can be made from a single acute serum sample. In patients from endemic areas, this is not possible because antibodies may be found in up to 18% of healthy individuals.

Other methods include culture and polymerase chain reaction, but these are not routinely available and the results do not always correlate with serological testing, and are affected by prior antibiotic treatment. The currently available diagnostic methods have been summarised.

== Treatment ==
Without treatment, the disease is often fatal. Since the use of antibiotics, case fatalities have decreased from 4–40% to less than 2%.

The drug most commonly used is doxycycline or tetracycline, but chloramphenicol is an alternative. Strains that are resistant to doxycycline and chloramphenicol have been reported in northern Thailand. Rifampicin and azithromycin are alternatives. Azithromycin is an alternative in children and pregnant women with scrub typhus, and when doxycycline resistance is suspected. Ciprofloxacin cannot be used safely in pregnancy and is associated with stillbirths and miscarriage.
Combination therapy with doxycycline and rifampicin is not recommended due to possible antagonism.

== Vaccine ==
No licensed vaccines are available.

An early attempt to create a scrub typhus vaccine occurred in the United Kingdom in 1937 (with the Wellcome Foundation infecting around 300,000 cotton rats in a classified project called &quot;Operation Tyburn&quot;), but the vaccine was not used. The first known batch of scrub typhus vaccine actually used to inoculate human subjects was dispatched to India for use by Allied Land Forces, South-East Asia Command in June 1945. By December 1945, 268,000 cc had been dispatched. The vaccine was produced at Wellcome&#x27;s laboratory at Ely Grange, Frant, Sussex. An attempt to verify the efficacy of the vaccine by using a placebo group for comparison was vetoed by the military commanders, who objected to the experiment.

Enormous antigenic variation in &quot;Orientia tsutsugamushi&quot; strains is now recognized, and immunity to one strain does not confer immunity to another. Any scrub typhus vaccine should give protection to all the strains present locally, to give an acceptable level of protection. A vaccine developed for one locality may not be protective in another, because of antigenic variation. This complexity continues to hamper efforts to produce a viable vaccine.

Dora Lush, an Australian bacteriologist, died after accidentally pricking her finger with a needle containing scrub typhus while inoculating a mouse in an attempt to develop a vaccine.

== History ==

Severe epidemics of the disease occurred among troops in Burma and Ceylon during World War II. Several members of the U.S. Army&#x27;s 5307th Composite Unit (Merrill&#x27;s Marauders) died of the disease, as well as many soldiers in the Burma theatre; and before 1944, no effective antibiotics or vaccines were available.

World War II provides some indicators that the disease is endemic to undeveloped areas in all of Oceania in the Pacific theater, although war records frequently lack definitive diagnoses, and many records of &quot;high fever&quot; evacuations were also likely to be other tropical illnesses. In the chapter entitled &quot;The Green War&quot;, General MacArthur&#x27;s biographer William Manchester identifies that the disease was one of a number of debilitating afflictions affecting both sides on New Guinea in the running bloody Kokoda battles over extremely harsh terrains under intense hardships— fought during a six-month span all along the Kokoda Track in 1942–43, and mentions that to be hospital-evacuated, Allied soldiers (who cycled forces) had to run a fever of , and that sickness casualties outnumbered weapons-inflicted casualties 5:1. Similarly, the illness was a casualty producer in all the jungle fighting of the land battles of the New Guinea campaign and the Guadalcanal campaign. Where the Allies had bases, they could remove and cut back vegetation, or use DDT as a prophylaxis area barrier treatment, so mite- and tick-induced sickness rates in forces off the front lines were diminished.

The disease was also a problem for US troops stationed in Japan after WWII, and was variously known as &quot;Shichitō fever&quot; (by troops stationed in the Izu Seven Islands) or &quot;Hatsuka fever&quot; (Chiba prefecture).

Scrub typhus was first reported in Chile in 2006. This is likely the result of underdiagnosis and underreporting and not of a recent spread to Chile. In January 2020 the disease was for the first time reported in Chile&#x27;s southernmost region.

<doc id="711525" wikidata="Q2273101" url="?curid=711525" title="Piece of Time">
<text>Piece of Time is the debut album by Florida death metal band Atheist, recorded in 1988 and released locally on August 30, 1989 through Metal Blade Records, and internationally in 1990 through Active Records. 

&quot;Piece of Time&quot; is the only Atheist album to feature bassist Roger Patterson, although he wrote a great deal of the basslines used on the band&#x27;s sophomore album &quot;Unquestionable Presence&quot;.

==Background==
The album&#x27;s release was delayed due to Atheist&#x27;s original record label Mean Machine Records going bankrupt, which forced the band to find a new label. They eventually signed with UK label Active Records, who released the album in Europe soon after. The album was not released in the US for another six months, until Metal Blade Records arranged a licensing deal with Active Records and released it to the American market in November 1990.

== Composition and music ==
&quot;Piece of Time&quot; has been described as sounding like &quot;a death/thrash record made by players who had heard a Return to Forever record in their time.&quot; The album&#x27;s tracks have been called &quot;brain-twisting,&quot; and its style is characterized by &quot;unpredictably shifting tempos, non-linear riffing progressions, and sheer technicality.&quot; Additionally, it has been described as &quot;a death [metal] album as conceived from a jazz-rock aesthetic.&quot; According to Langdon Hickman of Invisible Oranges, &quot;the guitars, bass and drums [did not seem to] bob along in straight time like the cliche of metal bands, nor did they indulge in bluesy syncopation like some groups; instead, they had a microrhythmic thrust, a slight swing that seemed to recall samba, bossa nova, or perhaps jazz. This was tight and rich in the string instruments but perhaps most wild and loose-limbed in Steve Flynn’s drumming. He punched, stretched and pulled the beat; but not much, not yet. That would come later.&quot; According to Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic, the album &quot;[meshes] frantic, severely discordant chords and sparse melodies with the agonized growls of frontman Kelly Shaefer.&quot; The album makes use of start-stop rhythms and turnarounds. 

== Reception and legacy ==
In 2005, &quot;Piece of Time&quot; was ranked number 402 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. It was described by James Hinchliffe in &quot;Terrorizer&quot; as the band&#x27;s &quot;least technically accomplished release and their most lyrically immature, [yet] it remains an exceptional work of late 80s deaththrash, crackling with an uncommon energy and creativity&quot;. Langdon Hickman of Invisible Oranges assessed, &quot;&quot;Piece of Time&quot; is a good record, but it is also clearly a compilation of the best songs of their demo period, tunes that worked well live, and a few to fill out the remaining space, which is to say that it does not have the greatest structural integrity in the world. Still, debut records for many are an extension of demo years, acting as a sampler of things to come. For Atheist, this was certainly true. It was their second album that would display them at full strength.&quot;

Retrospectively, Mike DaRonco of Allmusic wrote that &quot;Piece of Time&#x27;s&quot; sophisticated songwriting and dissonant riffs &quot;stumped most casual listeners but wowed critics with the sheer audacity of the band&#x27;s death-jazz.&quot;

The album has been cited as an influence by Dark Tranquility frontman Mikael Stanne. He said, &quot;The mind-bending songs of Atheist were just so out of this world and even if I didn’t understand the songs back then they still resonated with me.&quot;

== Track listing ==
=== 2002 Re-release ===
In 2002, EMG Entertainment re-released &quot;Piece of Time&quot;. Originally, EMG Entertainment was supposed to reissue all three Atheist albums, but Kelly Shaefer aborted those plans after only &quot;Piece of Time&quot; had been reissued. This release has been digitally remastered, and features six bonus tracks.

=== 2005 Re-release ===
In 2005, Relapse Records re-released &quot;Piece of Time&quot;, this time along with the rest of Atheist&#x27;s catalogue. This release was also digitally remastered, and features nine bonus tracks.

<text>Snes9x is a Super Nintendo Entertainment System emulator software with official ports for MS-DOS, Linux, Microsoft Windows, AmigaOS 4, macOS, MorphOS, Xbox, PSP, PS3, GameCube, Wii, iOS, and Android. Windows RT and Windows Phone 8 have an unofficial port named Snes8x.

==Background==

Development of &quot;Snes9x&quot; began in July 1997 when Gary Henderson&#x27;s Snes96 and Jerremy Koot&#x27;s Snes97 emulators merged to create Snes9x. &quot;Snes9x&quot; was among the first to emulate most SNES enhancement chips at some level. In version 1.53, it added support for Cg shaders. Version 1.55 added support for the MSU1 enhancement chip found on the SD2SNES 

The emulator &quot;PocketSNES&quot; for Pocket PCs is based on &quot;Snes9X&quot;.

There is also an unofficial Snes9x port compiled with Emscripten which runs inside a web browser.

== License ==

The source code of Snes9x is publicly available, but the license prohibits its commercial use.

==Reception==

In 2005, Retro Gamer called Snes9x &quot;the best SNES emulator available&quot;.

In 2021, Digital Trends noted that the emulator had broad compatibility and ran on systems with limited resources.

<doc id="711534" wikidata="Q952862" url="?curid=711534" title="Rickettsia prowazekii">
<text>Rickettsia prowazekii is a species of gram-negative, obligate intracellular parasitic, aerobic bacilliform bacteria of class Alphaproteobacteria that is the etiologic agent of epidemic typhus, transmitted in the feces of lice. In North America, the main reservoir for &quot;R. prowazekii&quot; is the flying squirrel. &quot;R. prowazekii&quot; is often surrounded by a protein microcapsular layer and slime layer; the natural life cycle of the bacterium generally involves a vertebrate and an invertebrate host, usually an arthropod, typically the human body louse. A form of &quot;R. prowazekii&quot; that exists in the feces of arthropods remains stably infective for months. &quot;R. prowazekii&quot; also appears to be the closest semi-free-living relative of mitochondria, based on genome sequencing.

==History==

===Discovery===
Henrique da Rocha Lima, a Brazilian doctor, discovered this bacterium in 1916. He named it after his colleague Stanislaus von Prowazek, who had died from typhus in 1915. Both Prowazek and Rocha Lima had been infected with typhus while studying its causative agent in a prisoner-of-war camp hospital in Cottbus, Germany.
This bacterium lacks flagella and is aerobic. It is classed &quot;gram-negative&quot; because its cell walls do not retain crystal violet Gram stain; gram-negative bacteria in general are more resistant to many antibiotics such as penicillin.

==Genome==
The genome of &quot;R. prowazekii&quot; is reduced, being about 1Mb in size and encoding 834 proteins. Some strains encode 866 proteins. They do not encode all the proteins required to live on their own. Missing activities have to be provided by its host, a eukaryotic cell. For this reason, &quot;R. prowazekii&quot; has sometimes been regarded as a model for the intracellular bacterial ancestor of mitochondria.

==Treatment==
Vaccines against &quot;R. prowazekii&quot; were developed in the 1940s, and were highly effective in reducing typhus deaths among U.S. soldiers during World War II. Immunity following recovery from infection with, or by immunization against, &quot;R. prowazekii&quot; is lifelong in most cases. However, &quot;R. prowazekii&quot; can establish a latent infection, which can reactivate after years or decades (referred to as Brill-Zinsser disease). Treatment with tetracycline antibiotics is usually successful.

<doc id="711539" wikidata="Q4038737" url="?curid=711539" title="Files-11">
<text>Files-11 is the file system used in the RSX-11 and OpenVMS operating systems from Digital Equipment Corporation. It supports record-oriented I/O, remote network access, and file versioning. The original ODS-1 layer is a flat file system; the ODS-2 version is a hierarchical file system, with support for access control lists.

Files-11 is similar to, but significantly more advanced than, the file systems used in previous Digital Equipment Corporation operating systems such as TOPS-20 and RSTS/E.

== History ==
The native OpenVMS file system is descended from older DEC operating systems and is similar in many ways, both having been designed by Dave Cutler. A major difference is the layout of directories. These file systems all provided some form of rudimentary non-hierarchical directory structure, typically based on assigning one directory per user account. Under RSTS/E, each user account was represented by two numbers, a codice_1 pair, and had one associated directory. Special system files, such as program executables and the OS itself, were stored in the directory of a reserved system account.

While this was suitable for PDP-11 systems, which possessed limited permanent storage capacity, VAX systems with much larger hard drives required a more flexible method of file storage: hierarchical directory layout in particular, the most notable improvement in ODS-2.

== Overview ==
&quot;Files-11&quot; is the general term for five separate file systems, known as on-disk structure (ODS) levels 1 through 5.

ODS-1 is the flat file system used by the RSX-11 OS, supported by older VMS systems for RSX compatibility, but never used to support VMS itself; it has been largely superseded by ODS-2 and ODS-5.

ODS-2 is the original VMS file system. Compared with ODS-1, it is a hierarchical file system.

Although seldom referred to by their ODS level designations, ODS-3 and ODS-4 are the Files-11 support for the CD-ROM ISO 9660 and High Sierra Format file systems, respectively.

ODS-5 is an extended version of ODS-2 available on Alpha, IA-64 and x86-64 platforms which adds support for case-preserving filenames with non-ASCII characters and improvements to the hierarchical directory support. It was originally intended for file serving to Microsoft Windows or other non-VMS systems as part of the &quot;NT Affinity&quot; project, but is also used on user disks and Internet servers.

== Directory layout ==
All files and directories in a Files-11 file system are contained inside one or more &quot;parent directories&quot;, and eventually under the root directory, the &quot;master file directory&quot; (see below). The file system is therefore organised in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure.

In this example (&quot;see right&quot;), File 2 has a directory entry under both Dir 2 and Dir 3; it is &quot;in&quot; both directories simultaneously. Even if removed from one, it would still exist in the other directory until removed from there also. This is similar to the concept of hard links in UNIX, although care must be taken that the file is not actually deleted on disks that are not set up for hard links (only available on ODS-5 disks, and then only if the disk has hard links enabled).
== Disk organization and naming ==
An operational VMS system has access to one or more online disks, each of which contains a complete, independent file system. These are either local storage or, in the case of a cluster, storage shared with remote systems.

In an OpenVMS cluster configuration, non-private disks are shared between all nodes in the cluster &quot;(see figure 1)&quot;. In this configuration, the two system disks are accessible to both nodes via the network, but the private disk is not shared: it is mounted for use only by a particular user or process on that machine. Access to files across a cluster is managed by the OpenVMS Distributed Lock Manager, an integral part of the file system.

Multiple disks can be combined to form a single large logical disk, or &quot;volume set&quot;. Disks can also be automatically replicated into &quot;shadow sets&quot; for data security or faster read performance.

A disk is identified by either its physical name or (more often) by a user-defined logical name. For example, the boot device (system disk) may have the physical name $3$DKA100, but it is generally referred to by the logical name SYS$SYSDEVICE.

File systems on each disk (with the exception of ODS-1) are hierarchical. A fully specified filename consists of a nodename, a username and password, a device name, directory, filename, file type, and a version number, in the format:

 NODE&quot;accountname password&quot;::device:[directory.subdirectory]filename.type;ver

For example, [DIR1.DIR2.DIR3]FILE.EXT refers to the latest version of FILE.EXT, on the current default disk, in directory [DIR1.DIR2.DIR3].

DIR1 is a subdirectory of the master file directory (MFD), or &quot;root directory&quot;, and DIR2 is a subdirectory of DIR1. A disk&#x27;s MFD is identified by [000000].

Most parts of the filename can be omitted, in which case they are taken from the current &quot;default file specification&quot;. The default file specification replaces the concept of &quot;current directory&quot; in other operating systems by providing a set of defaults for node, device name and directory. All processes have a default file specification which includes disk name and directory, and most VMS file system routines accept a default file specification which can also include the file type; the TYPE command, for example, defaults to &quot;.LIS&quot; as the file type, so the command TYPE F, with no extension, attempts to open the file F.LIS.

Every file has a version number, which defaults to 1 if no other versions of the same filename are present (otherwise one higher than the greatest version). Every time a file is saved, rather than overwriting the existing version, a new file with the same name but an incremented version number is created. Old versions can be deleted explicitly, with the DELETE or the PURGE command, or optionally, older versions of a file can be deleted automatically when the file&#x27;s &quot;version limit&quot; is reached (set by SET FILE/VERSION_LIMIT). Old versions are thus not overwritten, but are kept on disk and may be retrieved at any time. The architectural limit on version numbers is 32767. The versioning behavior is easily overridden if it is unwanted. In particular, files which are directly updated, such as databases, do not create new versions unless explicitly programmed.

ODS-2 is limited to eight levels of subdirectories, and only uppercase, alphanumeric names (plus the underscore, dash, and dollar sign) up to 39.39 characters (39 for the filename and another 39 for the extension). ODS-5 expands the character set to lowercase letters and most other printable ASCII characters, as well as ISO Latin-1 and Unicode characters, increases the maximum filename length and allows unlimited levels of subdirectories. When constructing a pathname for an ODS-5 file which uses characters not allowed under ODS-2, a special &quot;^&quot; syntax is used to preserve backwards compatibility; the file &quot;file.tar.gz;1&quot; on an ODS-5 disk, for example, would be referred to as &quot;file^.tar.gz&quot;—the file&#x27;s name is &quot;file.tar&quot;, and the extension is &quot;.gz&quot;.

== File security: protection and ACLs ==
VMS file security is defined by two mechanisms, UIC-based access control and ACL-based access control. UIC access control is based on the owner of the file and the UIC, or user, accessing the file. Access is determined by four groups of permissions:
*System
*Owner
*Group
*World

And four permission bits:
*Read
*Write
*Execute
*Delete

The &quot;system&quot; access applies to any user whose UIC group code is less than or equal to the SYSGEN parameter MAXSYSGROUP (typically 8, or 10 octal) (for example the SYSTEM user); &quot;owner&quot; and &quot;group&quot; apply to the owner of the file and that user&#x27;s user group, and &quot;world&quot; applies to any other user. There is also a fifth permission bit, &quot;Control&quot;, which is used to determine access to change file metadata such as protection. This group cannot be set explicitly; it is always set for System and Owner, and never for Group or World.

UIC-based access control is also affected by four system privileges, which allow users holding them to override access controls:
*BYPASS: user implicitly has RWED access to all files, regardless of file protection;
*READALL: user implicitly has R access to all files;
*SYSPRV: user may access files based on System protection;
*GRPPRV: user may access files based on System protection if their UIC group matches the file&#x27;s group.

ACLs allow additional privileges to be assigned on a user– or group–specific basis; for example, a web server&#x27;s UIC could be granted read access to all files in a particular directory. ACLs can be marked as &quot;inherited&quot;, where a directory file&#x27;s ACL applies to all files underneath it. ACLs are modified using the EDIT/ACL command, and take the form of identifier/access pairs. For example, the ACL entry

 (IDENTIFIER=HTTP$SERVER,ACCESS=READ+EXECUTE)

would allow the user HTTP$SERVER to read and execute the file.

== Logical names ==
A logical name is a system variable which may reference a disk, directory or file, or contain other program-specific information. For example, the logical SYS$SYSDEVICE contains the system&#x27;s boot device. A logical name normally refers to a single directory or disk, &quot;e.g.&quot; SYS$LOGIN: which is the user&#x27;s login (home) directory (or directories); these logicals cannot be used as true disk names—SYS$LOGIN:[DIR]FILE is not a valid file specification. However, &quot;concealed&quot; logical names, defined by DEFINE/TRANSLATION=CONCEALED, can be used in that way; these &quot;rooted&quot; directories are defined with a trailing &quot;.&quot; on the directory specification, hence

 $ DEFINE/TRANS=CONCEAL HOME DISK$USERS:[&quot;username&quot;.]

would allow HOME:[DIR]FILE to be used. More common are simple logicals which point to specific directories associated with some application software which may be located in on any disk or any directory. Hence logical ABC_EXE may point to a directory of executable programs for application ABC and ABC_TEMP may point to a directory of temporary files for that same application and this directory may be on the same disk and in the same directory tree as ABC_EXE or could be somewhere on another disk (and in a different directory tree).

In a manner similar to Unix, VMS defines several standard input and output channels which are accessed through the logical names SYS$INPUT, SYS$OUTPUT, SYS$ERROR and SYS$COMMAND.

Logical names do not have a close equivalent in POSIX operating systems. They resemble Unix environment variables, except they are expanded by the file system, instead of the command shell or application program. They must be defined before use, so it is common for many logical names to be defined in the system startup command file, as well as user login command files.
In VMS, logical names may reference other logical names (up to a predefined nesting limit of 10), and may contain lists of names to search for an existing filename. Some frequently referenced logical names are:

The closest non-DEC operating system to support the concept of logical names is AmigaOS, through the ASSIGN command. AmigaOS&#x27;s disk operating system, AmigaDOS, which is a port of TRIPOS, bears some resemblance to DEC operating systems. For example, physical device names follow a pattern like DF0: for the first floppy disk, CDROM2: for the 3rd CD-ROM drive, etc. However, since the system can boot from any attached drive, the operating system creates the SYS: assignment to automatically reference the boot device used. Other assignments, LIBS:, PREFS:, C:, S:, et al. are also made, themselves referenced off SYS:. Users are, of course, allowed to create and destroy their own assignments too.

== Record-oriented I/O: Record Management Services ==
Record Management Services is the structured I/O layer of the VMS operating system. RMS provides comprehensive program support for managing &quot;structured&quot; files, such as record-based and indexed database files. The VMS file system, in conjunction with RMS, extends files access past simple byte-streams and allows OS-level support for a variety of rich files types. Each file in the VMS file system may be thought of as a database, containing a series of records, each of which has one of more individual fields. A text file, for example, is a list of records (lines) separated by a newline character. RMS is an example of a record-oriented filesystem.

There are four record formats defined by RMS:
* Fixed length - all records in the file have the same length.
* Variable length - records vary in length, and every record is prefixed by a count byte giving its length.
* Variable record length with fixed-length control - records vary in length, but are preceded by a fixed-length control block.
* Stream - record vary in length, and every record is separated from the next one by a termination character. A text file is an example of a stream-format file using line feed or carriage return to separate records.

There are four record access methods, or methods to retrieve extant records from files:
* Sequential Access - starting with a particular records, subsequent records are retrieved in order until the end of the file.
* Relative Record Number Access - records are retrieved via a record &quot;number&quot; relative to the beginning of the file.
* Record File Address Access - records are retrieved directly by their location in the file (RFA, or Record File Address).
* Indexed Access - records are retrieved via a key, in a form of key-value mapping.

== Physical layout: the On-Disk Structure ==
At the disk level, ODS represents the file system as an array of &quot;blocks&quot;, a block being 512 contiguous bytes on one physical disk (&quot;volume&quot;). Disk blocks are assigned in &quot;clusters&quot; (originally 3 contiguous blocks but later increased with larger disk sizes). A file on the disk will ideally be entirely contiguous, i.e. the blocks which contain the file will be sequential, but disk fragmentation will sometimes require the file to be located in discontiguous clusters in which case the fragments are called extents. Disks may be combined with other disks to form a &quot;volume set&quot; and files stored anywhere across that set of disks, but larger disk sizes have reduced the use of volume sets because management of a single physical disk is simpler.

Every file on a Files-11 disk (or volume set) has a unique &quot;file identification&quot; (FID), composed of three numbers: the &quot;file number&quot; (NUM), the &quot;file sequence number&quot; (SEQ), and the &quot;relative volume number&quot; (RVN). The NUM indicates where in the INDEXF.SYS file (see below) the metadata for the file is located; the SEQ is a generation number which incremented when the file is deleted and another file is created reusing the same INDEXF.SYS entry (so any dangling references to the old file do not accidentally point to the new one); and the RVN indicates the volume number on which the file is stored when using a volume set.

== Directories ==
The structural support of an ODS volume is provided by a &quot;directory file&quot;—a special file containing a list of file names, file version numbers and their associated FIDs, similar to VSAM catalogs on MVS and directories on Unix file systems and NTFS. At the root of the directory structure is the &quot;master file directory&quot; (MFD), the root directory which contains (directly or indirectly) every file on the volume.


== The Master File Directory ==
At the top level of an ODS file system is the &quot;master file directory&quot; (MFD), which contains all top-level directory files (including itself), and several system files used to store file system information. On ODS-1 volumes, a two-level directory structure is used: each &quot;user identification code&quot; (UIC) has an associated &quot;user file directory&quot; (UFD), of the form [GROUP.USER]. On ODS-2 and later volumes, the layout of directories under the MFD is free-form, subject to a limit on the nesting of directories (8 levels on ODS-2 and unlimited on ODS-5). On multi-volume sets, the MFD is always stored on the first volume, and contains the subdirectories of all volumes.

The following system files are present in the ODS MFD:
*INDEXF.SYS;1—Index file
*BITMAP.SYS;1—Storage bitmap file
*BADBLK.SYS;1—Bad block file
*000000.DIR;1—The MFD directory file itself
*CORIMG.SYS;1—Core image file
*VOLSET.SYS;1—Volume set list file (ODS-2/5 only)
*CONTIN.SYS;1—Continuation file (ODS-2/5 only)
*BACKUP.SYS;1—Backup log file (ODS-2/5 only)
*BADLOG.SYS;1—Pending bad block (ODS-2/5 only)
*SECURITY.SYS;1—Volume security profile (ODS-2/5 only)
*QUOTA.SYS;1—Quota file (optional and available under ODS-2/5 only)
*GPT.SYS;1—GUID Partitioning Table (GPT) (OpenVMS I64 EFI boot structures, optional on OpenVMS Alpha)

Note that the file system implementation itself does not refer to these files by name, but by their file IDs, which always have the same values. Thus, INDEXF.SYS is always the file with NUM = 1 and SEQ = 1.

== Index file: INDEXF.SYS ==
The index file contains the most basic information about a Files-11 volume set.

There are two organizations of INDEXF.SYS, the traditional organization and the organization used on disks with GPT.SYS; with the GUID Partition Table (GPT) structures.

With the traditional organization, block 1 is the &quot;boot block&quot;, which contains the location of the &quot;primary bootstrap image&quot;, used to load the VMS operating system. This is always located at logical block 0 on the disk, so that the hardware firmware can read it. This block is always present, even on non-system (non-bootable) volumes.

After the boot block is the &quot;primary home block&quot;. This contains the &quot;volume name&quot;, the location of the extents comprising the remainder of the index file, the volume owner&#x27;s UIC, and the &quot;volume protection&quot; information. There are normally several additional copies of the home block, known as the &quot;secondary home blocks&quot;, to allow recovery of the volume if it is lost or damaged.

On disks with GPT.SYS, GPT.SYS contains the equivalent of the boot block (known as the Master Boot Record (MBR)), and there is no primary home block. All home blocks present on a GPT-based disk are alternate home blocks. These structures are not included in INDEXF.SYS, and the blocks of the INDEXF.SYS file are unused.

The rest of the index file is composed of &quot;file headers&quot;, which describe the extents allocated to the files residing on the volume, and file metadata such as the owner UIC, ACLs and protection information. Each file is described by one or more file headers—more than one can be required when a file has a large number of extents. The file header is a fixed-length block, but contains both fixed– and variable–length sections:
* The &quot;header&quot; contains the NUM and SEQ, the protection (security) information, and the location of the rest of the file header.
* The &quot;ident&quot; section contains the accounting metadata: the filename, creation and modification times, and the time of the last backup.
* The &quot;map&quot; describes which physical disk blocks (extents) map to each virtual block of the file.
* The &quot;access control list&quot; contains the ACL information for the file.
* The &quot;reserved area&quot; is space at the end of the file header which is not used by the operating system. This can be used by for customer- or vendor-specific information.
* The last two bytes of the header are a checksum of the previous 255 words, to verify the validity of the header.

If possible, the map and ACL sections of the header are contained completely in the &quot;primary header&quot;. However, if the ACL is too long, or the file contains too many extents, there will not be enough space in the primary header to store them. In this case, an &quot;extension header&quot; is allocated to store the overflow information.


The file header begins with 4 offsets (IDOFFSET, MPOFFSET, ACOFFSET and ROFFSET). Since the size of the areas after the fixed-length header may vary (such as the map and ACL areas), the offsets are required to locate these additional areas. Each offset is the number of 16-bit words from the beginning of the file header to the beginning of that area.

If the file requires multiple headers, the &quot;extension segment number&quot; (SEGNUM) contains the sequence number of this header, beginning at 0 in the first entry in INDEXF.SYS.

STRUCLEV contains the current structure level (in the high byte) and version (in the low byte) of the file system; ODS-2 being structure level 2. An increase in the version number indicates a backwards-compatible change that older software may ignore; changes in the structure level itself are incompatible.

W_FID (containing three values: FID_NUM, FID_SEQ and FID_RVN, corresponding to the file, sequence, and relative volume number) contains the ID of this file; EXT_FID (again composed of three values) holds the location of the next extension header, if any. In both of these values, the RVN is specified as 0 to represent the &quot;current&quot; volume (0 is not normally a valid RVN).

FILECHAR contains several flags which affect how the file is handled or organised:
*NOBACKUP causes this file to be ignored when a backup is run.
*WRITEBACK enables cached (delayed) writes to the file.
*READCHECK causes all reads of the file to be done twice, and compared to ensure data integrity.
*WRITCHECK results in all writes being verified by a subsequent read and compare.
*CONTIGB causes the OS to attempt to allocate storage for the file in as contiguous a manner as possible.
*LOCKED is set if the file is deaccess-locked. If set, this indicates that the file was not properly closed after its last use, and the contents may be inconsistent.
*CONTIG indicates that the file is stored contiguously on disk; that is, each virtual block formula_1 is mapped to the logical (physical) block formula_2, for some constant formula_3.
*BADACL is set if the file has an invalid access control list.
*SPOOL is set if the file is a spool file, such as an intermediate file used during printing.
*DIRECTORY is set if the file is a directory.
*BADBLOCK is set if the file contains bad blocks.
*MARKDEL is set if the file has been marked for deletion, but is still in use; it will be deleted once closed by the last user.
*NOCHARGE, if set, causes space used by the file to not be taken from the owner&#x27;s storage quota.
*ERASE causes the file&#x27;s contents to be overwritten when it is deleted.

ACCMODE describes the &quot;privilege level&quot; at which a process must be running in order to access the file. VMS defines four privilege levels: user, supervisor, exec, and kernel. Each type of access - read, write, execute and delete - is encoded as a 2-bit integer.

FILEPROT contains the discretionary access control information for the file. It is divided into 4 groups of 4 bits each: system, owner, group and world. Bit 0 corresponds to read access, 1 to write, 2 to execute and 3 to delete. Setting a bit denies a particular access to a group; clearing it allows it.

If the file header is an extension header, BACKLINK contains the file ID of the primary header; otherwise, it contains the file ID of the directory file containing the primary entry for the file.

== Other files ==
*Storage bitmap file: BITMAP.SYS
:The bitmap file is responsible for storing information regarding used and available space on a volume. It contains the &quot;storage control block&quot; (SCB), which includes summary information detailing ???, and the bitmap, an array of bits to indicate if a cluster of blocks on the disk is free or allocated. In early versions of VMS the cluster comprised 3 blocks but as disk sizes have increased, so has the cluster size.
*Bad block file: BADBLK.SYS
:The bad block file contains all of the known bad blocks on the physical volume. The purpose is to prevent the system from allocating them to files. This file was used more in the early days when disks were typically manufactured with more bad patches on the surface.
*Volume set list file: VOLSET.SYS
:The volume set list is located on volume 1 of a volume set, and contains a list of labels of all volumes in the set, and the set&#x27;s volume name.
*Continuation file: CONTIN.SYS
:When a file on a multi-volume set crosses the boundary of two constituent volumes, the continuation file is used as its extension header and describes the volume where the rest of the file can be found.
*Quota file: QUOTA.SYS
:The quota file contains information of each UIC&#x27;s disk space usage on a volume. It contains a record for each UIC with space allocated to it on a volume, along with information on how much space is being used by that UIC. &quot;NOTE: The DISK QUOTA feature is optional and the file will only exist if the feature was ever enabled.&quot;
*Volume security profile: SECURITY.SYS
:The volume security profile contains the volume&#x27;s owner UIC, the volume protection mask, and its access control list.
*GUID Partitioning Table: GPT.SYS
:This file overlays and protects the MBR (Master Boot Record) and GPT (GUID Partitioning Table) disk structures utilized for and by the Extensible Firmware Interface-compliant firmware. This file is created by default during OpenVMS I64 disk initialization, and is optionally created (with INITIALIZE/GPT) on OpenVMS Alpha.

<doc id="711548" wikidata="Q1131670" url="?curid=711548" title="Unquestionable Presence">
<text>Unquestionable Presence is the second studio album by American death metal band Atheist. It was released in 1991 and added a new sound by using jazz-like harmonies, subtle Latin rhythms and unusual time signatures.

== Background ==
Bassist Roger Patterson wrote the bass lines for &quot;Unquestionable Presence&quot;, but died in a touring van accident before the recording sessions took place. His work, however, can be heard on the pre-production demos included with the 2005 re-release. Tony Choy was brought in as a replacement to play bass on the album.

==Composition and music==
The album makes use of slap bass and odd time signatures. According to Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic, &quot;Unquestionable Presence&quot; is characterized by &quot;sparing but highly effective use of melody (mostly nuances and accents during solos and choruses).&quot; &quot;Unquestionable Presence&quot; is considered a landmark album in the genre of technical death metal. Ultimate Guitar senior editor David Slavković states the album &quot;dives deep into progressive metal waters&quot;, highlighting the album&#x27;s stylistic diversity, and complex song structures and transitions.

==Reception and legacy==

James Hinchcliffe described the album in &quot;Terrorizer&quot; as &quot;the very pinnacle of scorching yet brain-twisting technical metal&quot;. Phil Freeman in &quot;The Wire&quot; (issue 261, p. 53) described &quot;Unquestionable Presence&quot; as a &quot;more complex and progressive album, every song rocketing through multiple tricky time signatures and endless variations on already baffling riffs.&quot; In October 2005, &quot;Unquestionable Presence&quot; was inducted into the Decibel Magazine Hall of Fame being the ninth album overall to be featured in the Decibel Hall of Fame.

The album has been called &quot;one of the Floridian death metal scene&#x27;s ultimate statements in progressive metal.&quot;

==Track listing==
All lyrics by Kelly Shaefer. All music composed by Atheist.
===2005 re-release===
In 2005, Relapse Records re-released Unquestionable Presence. This edition has been digitally remastered, and features nine bonus tracks.

==Personnel==
* Kelly Shaefer – vocals, rhythm guitar
* Rand Burkey – lead guitar
* Tony Choy – bass
* Steve Flynn – drums
* Roger Patterson – bass (on tracks 9–15 on 2005 re-release)
* Scott Burns – production
* Atheist – production
* Justice Mitchell – cover artwork

<doc id="711550" wikidata="Q1133018" url="?curid=711550" title="Rational emotive behavior therapy">
<text>Rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT), previously called rational therapy and rational emotive therapy, is an active-directive, philosophically and empirically based psychotherapy, the aim of which is to resolve emotional and behavioral problems and disturbances and to help people to lead happier and more fulfilling lives.

REBT posits that people have erroneous beliefs about situations they are involved in, and that these beliefs cause disturbance, but can be disputed and changed.

==History==
Rational emotive behavior therapy was created and developed by the American psychotherapist and psychologist Albert Ellis, who was inspired by many of the teachings of Asian, Greek, Roman and modern philosophers. REBT is a form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and was first expounded by Ellis in the mid-1950s; development continued until his death in 2007. Ellis became synonymous with the highly influential therapy. &quot;Psychology Today&quot; noted, &quot;No individual—not even Freud himself—has had a greater impact on modern psychotherapy.&quot;

REBT is both a psychotherapeutic system of theory and practices and a school of thought established by Ellis. He first presented his ideas at a conference of the American Psychological Association in 1956 then published a seminal article in 1957 entitled &quot;Rational psychotherapy and individual psychology&quot;, in which he set the foundation for what he was calling rational therapy (RT) and carefully responded to questions from Rudolf Dreikurs and others about the similarities and differences with Alfred Adler&#x27;s individual psychology. This was around a decade before psychiatrist Aaron Beck first set forth his &quot;cognitive therapy&quot;, after Ellis had contacted him in the mid-1960s. Ellis&#x27; own approach was renamed &quot;Rational Emotive Therapy&quot; in 1959, then the current term in 1992.

Precursors of certain fundamental aspects of rational emotive behavior therapy have been identified in ancient philosophical traditions, particularly to Stoics Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, Zeno of Citium, Chrysippus, Panaetius of Rhodes, Cicero, and Seneca, and early Asian philosophers Confucius and Gautama Buddha. In his first major book on rational therapy, Ellis wrote that the central principle of his approach, that people are rarely emotionally affected by external events but rather by their thinking about such events, &quot;was originally discovered and stated by the ancient Stoic philosophers.&quot; Ellis illustrates this with a quote from the &quot;Enchiridion&quot; of Epictetus: &quot;Men are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of them.&quot; Ellis noted that Shakespeare expressed a similar thought in &quot;Hamlet&quot;: &quot;There&#x27;s nothing good or bad but thinking makes it so.&quot; Ellis also acknowledges early 20th century therapists, particularly Paul Charles Dubois, though he only read his work several years after developing his therapy.

== Theoretical assumptions ==
The REBT framework posits that humans have both innate rational (meaning self-helping, socially helping, and constructive) and irrational (meaning self-defeating, socially defeating, and unhelpful) tendencies and leanings. REBT claims that people to a large degree consciously and unconsciously construct emotional difficulties such as self-blame, self-pity, clinical anger, hurt, guilt, shame, depression and anxiety, and behavior tendencies like procrastination, compulsiveness, avoidance, addiction and withdrawal by the means of their irrational and self-defeating thinking, emoting and behaving.

REBT is then applied as an educational process in which the therapist often active-directively teaches the client how to identify irrational and self-defeating beliefs and philosophies which in nature are rigid, extreme, unrealistic, illogical and absolutist, and then to forcefully and actively question and dispute them and replace them with more rational and self-helping ones. By using different cognitive, emotive and behavioral methods and activities, the client, together with help from the therapist and in homework exercises, can gain a more rational, self-helping and constructive rational way of thinking, emoting and behaving.

One of the main objectives in REBT is to show the client that whenever unpleasant and unfortunate activating events occur in people&#x27;s lives, they have a choice between making themselves feel healthily or, self-helpingly, sorry, disappointed, frustrated, and annoyed or making themselves feel unhealthily and self-defeatingly horrified, terrified, panicked, depressed, self-hating and self-pitying. By attaining and ingraining a more rational and self-constructive philosophy of themselves, others and the world, people often are more likely to behave and emote in more life-serving and adaptive ways.

A fundamental premise of REBT is that humans do not get emotionally disturbed by unfortunate circumstances, but by how they construct their views of these circumstances through their language, evaluative beliefs, meanings and philosophies about the world, themselves and others. This concept has been attributed as far back as the Stoic philosopher Epictetus, who is often cited as utilizing similar ideas in antiquity.

==A-B-C-D-E-F Model==
In REBT, clients usually learn and begin to apply this premise by learning the &quot;A-B-C&quot;-&quot;D-E-F&quot; model of psychological disturbance and change. The following letters represent the following meanings in this model:

:A Adversity 
:B Beliefs about adversity
:C Emotional consequences
:D Disputations to challenge beliefs about adversity
:E Effective new rational beliefs
:F New feelings

The A-B-C model states that it is not an &quot;A&quot;, &quot;a&quot;dversity (or &quot;a&quot;ctivating event) that cause disturbed and dysfunctional emotional and behavioral &quot;C&quot;s, &quot;c&quot;onsequences, but also what people &quot;B&quot;, irrationally believe about the &quot;A&quot;, &quot;a&quot;dversity. &quot;A&quot;, &quot;a&quot;dversity can be an external situation, or a thought, a feeling or other kind of internal event, and it can refer to an event in the past, present, or future.

The &quot;B&quot;s, irrational beliefs that are most important in the &quot;A-B-C&quot; model are the explicit and implicit philosophical meanings and assumptions about events, personal desires, and preferences. The &quot;B&quot;s, &quot;b&quot;eliefs that are most significant are highly evaluative and consist of interrelated and integrated cognitive, emotional and behavioral aspects and dimensions. According to REBT, if a person&#x27;s evaluative &quot;B&quot;, &quot;b&quot;elief about the &quot;A&quot;, &quot;a&quot;ctivating event is rigid, absolutistic, fictional and dysfunctional, the &quot;C&quot;, the emotional and behavioral &quot;c&quot;onsequence, is likely to be self-defeating and destructive. Alternatively, if a person&#x27;s belief is preferential, flexible, and constructive, the &quot;C&quot;, the emotional and behavioral &quot;c&quot;onsequence is likely to be self-helping and constructive.

Through REBT, by understanding the role of their mediating, evaluative and philosophically based illogical, unrealistic and self-defeating meanings, interpretations and assumptions in disturbance, individuals can learn to identify them, then go to &quot;D&quot;, &quot;d&quot;isputing and questioning the evidence for them. At &quot;E, e&quot;ffective new philosophy, they can recognize and reinforce the notion no evidence exists for any psychopathological &quot;must&quot;, &quot;ought&quot; or &quot;should&quot; and distinguish them from healthy constructs, and subscribe to more constructive and self-helping philosophies. This new reasonable perspective leads to &quot;F&quot;, new &quot;f&quot;eelings and behaviors appropriate to the &quot;A&quot; they are addressing in the exercise.

== Psychological dysfunction ==
One of the main pillars of REBT is that irrational and dysfunctional ways and patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving are contributing to human disturbance and emotional and behavioral self-defeatism and social defeatism. REBT generally teaches that when people turn flexible preferences, desires and wishes into grandiose, absolutistic and fatalistic dictates, this tends to contribute to disturbance and upset. These dysfunctional patterns are examples of cognitive distortions.

===Irrational beliefs===
REBT proposes four core irrational ways of thinking that create suffering:

# Demands: The tendency to demand success, fair treatment, and respect (e.g., I must be treated fairly).
# Awfulizing: The tendency to consider adverse events as awful or terrible (e.g., It&#x27;s awful when I am disrespected).
# Low Frustration Tolerance (LFT): The belief that one could not stand or tolerate adversity (e.g., I cannot stand being treated unfairly).
# Depreciation: The belief that one event reflects the person as a whole (e.g., When I fail it shows that I am a complete failure).
===Core beliefs that disturb humans===
Ellis has suggested that humans take the above distorted ways of thinking and created three core beliefs or philosophies that humans tend to disturb themselves through:

===Rigid demands that humans make===
REBT commonly posits that at the core of irrational beliefs there often are explicit or implicit rigid demands and commands, and that extreme derivatives like awfulizing, low frustration tolerance, people deprecation and overgeneralizations are accompanied by these. According to REBT, the core dysfunctional philosophies in a person&#x27;s evaluative emotional and behavioral belief system are also very likely to contribute to unrealistic, arbitrary and crooked inferences and distortions in thinking. REBT therefore first teaches that when people in an insensible and devout way overuse absolutistic, dogmatic and rigid &quot;shoulds&quot;, &quot;musts&quot;, and &quot;oughts&quot;, they tend to disturb and upset themselves.

===Over-generalization===
Further, REBT generally posits that disturbed evaluations to a large degree occur through overgeneralization, wherein people exaggerate and globalize events or traits, usually unwanted events or traits or behavior, out of context, while almost always ignoring the positive events or traits or behaviors. For example, awfulizing is partly mental magnification of the importance of an unwanted situation to a catastrophe or horror, elevating the rating of something from bad to worse than it should be, to beyond totally bad, worse than bad to the intolerable and to a &quot;holocaust&quot;. The same exaggeration and overgeneralizing occurs with human rating, wherein humans come to be arbitrarily and axiomatically defined by their perceived flaws or misdeeds. Frustration intolerance then occurs when a person perceives something to be too difficult, painful or tedious, and by doing so exaggerates these qualities beyond one&#x27;s ability to cope with them.

===Secondary disturbances===
Essential to REBT theory is also the concept of secondary disturbances which people sometimes construct on top of their primary disturbance. As Ellis emphasizes:

Because of their self-consciousness and their ability to think about their thinking, they can very easily disturb themselves about their disturbances and can also disturb themselves about their ineffective attempts to overcome their emotional disturbances.

==Origins of dysfunction==
Regarding cognitive-affective-behavioral processes in mental functioning and dysfunctioning, originator Albert Ellis explains:

REBT assumes that human thinking, emotion, and action are not really separate or disparate processes, but that they all significantly overlap and are rarely experienced in a pure state. Much of what we call emotion is nothing more nor less than a certain kind—a biased, prejudiced, or strongly evaluative kind—of thought. But emotions and behaviors significantly influence and affect thinking, just as thinking influences emotions and behaviors. Evaluating is a fundamental characteristic of human organisms and seems to work in a kind of closed circuit with a feedback mechanism: First, perception biases response, and then response tends to bias subsequent perception. Also, prior perceptions appear to bias subsequent perceptions, and prior responses appear to bias subsequent responses. What we call feelings almost always have a pronounced evaluating or appraisal element.

REBT then generally proposes that many of these self-defeating cognitive, emotive and behavioral tendencies are both innately biological and indoctrinated early in and during life, and further grow stronger as a person continually revisits, clings and acts on them. Ellis alludes to similarities between REBT and the general semantics when explaining the role of irrational beliefs in self-defeating tendencies, citing Alfred Korzybski as a significant modern influence on this thinking.

REBT differs from other clinical approaches like psychoanalysis in that it places little emphasis on exploring the past, but instead focuses on changing the current evaluations and philosophical thinking-emoting and behaving in relation to themselves, others and the conditions under which people live.

==Disturbances==
REBT sees disturbances as caused by characteristics of a person, rather than a particular past event;

Almost all (neurotic clients) have innate tendencies to take their strong desires and preferences (which they learn and which they also have biological predispositions to construct) and to escalate them into unrealistic, illogical, absolutist demands and to thereby disturb themselves when these rigid imperatives are not fulfilled.

==Other insights==
Other insights of REBT (some referring to the ABCDEF model above) are:

Insight 1 – People seeing and accepting the reality that their emotional disturbances at point C are only partially caused by the activating events or adversities at point A that precede C. Although A contributes to C, and although disturbed Cs (such as feelings of panic and depression) are much more likely to follow strong negative As (such as being assaulted or raped), than they are to follow weak As (such as being disliked by a stranger), the main or more direct cores of extreme and dysfunctional emotional disturbances (Cs) are people&#x27;s irrational beliefs—the &quot;absolutistic&quot; (inflexible) &quot;musts&quot; and their accompanying inferences and attributions that people strongly believe about the activating event.

Insight 2 – No matter how, when, and why people acquire self-defeating or irrational beliefs (i.e. beliefs that are the main cause of their dysfunctional emotional-behavioral consequences), if they are disturbed in the present, they tend to keep holding these irrational beliefs and continue upsetting themselves with these thoughts. They do so not because they held them in the past, but because they still actively hold them in the present (often unconsciously), while continuing to reaffirm their beliefs and act as if they are still valid. In their minds and hearts, the troubled people still follow the core &quot;masturbatory&quot; philosophies they adopted or invented long ago or ones they recently accepted or constructed.

Insight 3 – No matter how well they have gained insights 1 and 2, insight alone rarely enables people to undo their emotional disturbances. They may feel better when they know, or think they know, how they became disturbed, because insights can feel useful and curative. But it is unlikely that people will actually get better and stay better unless they have and apply insight 3, which is that &quot;there is usually no way to get better and stay better except by continual work and practice in looking for and finding one&#x27;s core irrational beliefs&quot;; actively, energetically, and scientifically disputing them; replacing one&#x27;s absolute &quot;musts&quot; (rigid requirements about how things should be) with more flexible &quot;preferences&quot;; changing one&#x27;s unhealthy feelings to healthy, self-helping emotions; and firmly acting against one&#x27;s dysfunctional fears and compulsions. Only by a combined cognitive, emotive, and behavioral, as well as a quite persistent and forceful attack on one&#x27;s serious emotional problems, is one likely to significantly ameliorate or remove them, and keep them removed.

==Intervention==
As explained, REBT is a therapeutic system of both theory and practice; generally one of the goals of REBT is to help clients see the ways in which they have learned how they often needlessly upset themselves, teach them how to &quot;un-upset&quot; themselves and then how to empower themselves to lead happier and more fulfilling lives. The emphasis in therapy is generally to establish a successful collaborative therapeutic working alliance based on the REBT educational model. Although REBT teaches that the therapist or counsellor is better served by demonstrating unconditional other-acceptance or unconditional positive regard, the therapist is not necessarily always encouraged to build a warm and caring relationship with the client. The tasks of the therapist or counselor include understanding the client&#x27;s concerns from his point of reference and work as a facilitator, teacher and encourager.

In traditional REBT, the client together with the therapist, in a structured active-directive manner, often work through a set of target problems and establish a set of therapeutic goals. In these target problems, situational dysfunctional emotions, behaviors and beliefs are assessed in regards to the client&#x27;s values and goals. After working through these problems, the client learns to generalize insights to other relevant situations. In many cases after going through a client&#x27;s different target problems, the therapist is interested in examining possible core beliefs and more deep rooted philosophical evaluations and schemas that might account for a wider array of problematic emotions and behaviors. Although REBT much of the time is used as a brief therapy, in deeper and more complex problems, longer therapy is promoted.

In therapy, the first step often is that the client acknowledges the problems, accepts emotional responsibility for these and has willingness and determination to change. This normally requires a considerable amount of insight, but as originator Albert Ellis explains:

Humans, unlike just about all the other animals on earth, create fairly sophisticated languages which not only enable them to think about their feeling, their actions, and the results they get from doing and not doing certain things, but they also are able to think about their thinking and even think about thinking about their thinking.

Through the therapeutic process, REBT employs a wide array of forceful and active, meaning multimodal and disputing, methodologies. Central through these methods and techniques is the intent to help the client challenge, dispute and question their destructive and self-defeating cognitions, emotions and behaviors. The methods and techniques incorporate cognitive-philosophic, emotive-evocative-dramatic, and behavioral methods for disputation of the client&#x27;s irrational and self-defeating constructs and helps the client come up with more rational and self-constructive ones. REBT seeks to acknowledge that understanding and insight are not enough; in order for clients to significantly change, they need to pinpoint their irrational and self-defeating constructs and work forcefully and actively at changing them to more functional and self-helping ones.

REBT posits that the client must work hard to get better, and in therapy this normally includes a wide array of homework exercises in day-to-day life assigned by the therapist. The assignments may for example include desensitization tasks, i.e., by having the client confront the very thing he or she is afraid of. By doing so, the client is actively acting against the belief that often is contributing significantly to the disturbance.

Another factor contributing to the brevity of REBT is that the therapist seeks to empower the client to help himself through future adversities. REBT only promotes temporary solutions if more fundamental solutions are not found. An ideal successful collaboration between the REBT therapist and a client results in changes to the client&#x27;s philosophical way of evaluating himself or herself, others, and his or her life, which will likely yield effective results. The client then moves toward unconditional self-acceptance, other-acceptance and life-acceptance while striving to live a more self-fulfilling and happier life.

==Applications and interfaces==
Applications and interfaces of REBT are used with a broad range of clinical problems in traditional psychotherapeutic settings such as individual-, group- and family therapy. It is used as a general treatment for a vast number of different conditions and psychological problems normally associated with psychotherapy.

In addition, REBT is used with non-clinical problems and problems of living through counselling, consultation and coaching settings dealing with problems including relationships, social skills, career changes, stress management, assertiveness training, grief, problems with aging, money, weight control etc. More recently, the reported use of REBT in sport and exercise settings has grown, with the efficacy of REBT demonstrated across a range of sports.

REBT also has many interfaces and applications through self-help resources, phone and internet counseling, workshops &amp; seminars, workplace and educational programmes, etc. This includes Rational Emotive Education (REE) where REBT is applied in education settings, Rational Effectiveness Training in business and work-settings and SMART Recovery (Self Management And Recovery Training) in supporting those in addiction recovery, in addition to a wide variety of specialized treatment strategies and applications.

== Efficacy ==
REBT and CBT in general have a substantial and strong research base to verify and support both their psychotherapeutic efficiency and their theoretical underpinnings. Meta-analyses of outcome-based studies reveal REBT to be effective for treating various psychopathologies, conditions and problems. Recently, REBT randomized clinical trials have offered a positive view on the efficacy of REBT.

In general REBT is arguably one of the most investigated theories in the field of psychotherapy and a large amount of clinical experience and a substantial body of modern psychological research have validated and substantiated many of REBTs theoretical assumptions on personality and psychotherapy.

REBT may be effective in improving sports performance and mental health.

Ellis himself later in life accepted that REBT was not universally effective; &quot;I hope I am also not a devout REBTer, since I do not think it is an unmitigated cure for everyone and do accept its distinct limitations.&quot;

== Limitations and critique ==
The clinical research on REBT has been criticized both from within and by others. For instance, originator Albert Ellis has on occasions emphasized the difficulty and complexity of measuring psychotherapeutic effectiveness, because many studies only tend to measure whether clients merely feel better after therapy instead of them getting better and staying better. Ellis has also criticized studies for having limited focus primarily to cognitive restructuring aspects, as opposed to the combination of cognitive, emotive and behavioral aspects of REBT. As REBT has been subject to criticisms during its existence, especially in its early years, REBT theorists have a long history of publishing and addressing those concerns. It has also been argued by Ellis and by other clinicians that REBT theory on numerous occasions has been misunderstood and misconstrued both in research and in general.

Some have criticized REBT for being harsh, formulaic and failing to address deep underlying problems. REBT theorists have argued in reply that a careful study of REBT shows that it is both philosophically deep, humanistic and individualized collaboratively working on the basis of the client&#x27;s point of reference. They have further argued that REBT utilizes an integrated and interrelated methodology of cognitive, emotive-experiential and behavioral interventions. Others have questioned REBTs view of rationality, both radical constructivists who have claimed that reason and logic are subjective properties and those who believe that reason can be objectively determined. REBT theorists have argued in reply that REBT raises objections to clients&#x27; irrational choices and conclusions as a working hypothesis and through collaborative efforts demonstrate the irrationality on practical, functional and social consensual grounds. In 1998 when asked what the main criticism on REBT was, Albert Ellis replied that it was the claim that it was too rational and not dealing sufficiently enough with emotions. He repudiated the claim by saying that REBT on the contrary emphasizes that thinking, feeling, and behaving are interrelated and integrated, and that it includes a vast amount of both emotional and behavioural methods in addition to cognitive ones.

Ellis has himself in very direct terms criticized opposing approaches such as psychoanalysis, transpersonal psychology and abreactive psychotherapies in addition to on several occasions questioning some of the doctrines in certain religious systems, spiritualism and mysticism. Many, including REBT practitioners, have warned against dogmatizing and sanctifying REBT as a supposedly perfect psychological panacea. Prominent REBTers have promoted the importance of high quality and programmatic research, including originator Ellis, a self-proclaimed &quot;passionate skeptic&quot;. He has on many occasions been open to challenges and acknowledged errors and inefficiencies in his approach and concurrently revised his theories and practices. In general, with regard to cognitive-behavioral psychotherapies&#x27; interventions, others have pointed out that as about 30–40% of people are still unresponsive to interventions, that REBT could be a platform of reinvigorating empirical studies on the effectiveness of the cognitive-behavioral models of psychopathology and human functioning.

REBT has been developed, revised and augmented through the years as understanding and knowledge of psychology and psychotherapy have progressed. This includes its theoretical concepts, practices and methodology. The teaching of scientific thinking, reasonableness and un-dogmatism has been inherent in REBT as an approach, and these ways of thinking are an inextricable part of REBT&#x27;s empirical and skeptical nature.

== Mental wellness ==
As would be expected, REBT argues that mental wellness and mental health to a large degree results from an adequate amount of self-helping, flexible, logico-empirical ways of thinking, emoting and behaving. When a perceived undesired and stressful activating event occurs, and the individual is interpreting, evaluating and reacting to the situation rationally and self-helpingly, then the resulting consequence is, according to REBT, likely to be more healthy, constructive and functional. This does not by any means mean that a relatively un-disturbed person never experiences negative feelings, but REBT does hope to keep debilitating and un-healthy emotions and subsequent self-defeating behavior to a minimum. To do this, REBT generally promotes a flexible, un-dogmatic, self-helping and efficient belief system and constructive life philosophy about adversities and human desires and preferences.

REBT clearly acknowledges that people, in addition to disturbing themselves, also are innately constructivists. Because they largely upset themselves with their beliefs, emotions and behaviors, they can be helped to, in a multimodal manner, dispute and question these and develop a more workable, more self-helping set of constructs.

REBT generally teaches and promotes:

* That the concepts and philosophies of life of unconditional self-acceptance, other-acceptance, and life-acceptance are effective philosophies of life in achieving mental wellness and mental health.
* That human beings are inherently fallible and imperfect and that they are better served by accepting their and other human beings&#x27; totality and humanity, while at the same time they may not like some of their behaviors and characteristics. That they are better off not measuring their entire self or their &quot;being&quot; and give up the narrow, grandiose and ultimately destructive notion to give themselves any global rating or report card. This is partly because all humans are continually evolving and are far too complex to accurately rate; all humans do both self-defeating / socially defeating and self-helping/socially helping deeds, and have both beneficial and un-beneficial attributes and traits at certain times and in certain conditions. REBT holds that ideas and feelings about self-worth are largely definitional and are not empirically confirmable or falsifiable.
* That people had better accept life with its hassles and difficulties not always in accordance with their wants, while trying to change what they can change and live as elegantly as possible with what they cannot change.

<text>The Qinghai–Tibet railway or Qingzang railway (, ; ), is a high-elevation railway line in China between Xining, Qinghai Province, and Lhasa, Tibet. With over of track being more than above sea level, it is the highest railway line in the world.

Construction began on the section between Xining and Golmud in 1958 and was completed in 1984; the remaining from Golmud to Lhasa started construction in 2001 and opened in 2006, making it the first railway line in Tibet. Passenger trains run from Beijing, Chengdu, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Xining, and Lanzhou, and can carry between 800 and 1,000 passengers during peak season.

In addition to it being the world&#x27;s highest railway, the line is also the holder of numerous other records; the line includes the Tanggula Pass, the highest point on a railway in the world at above sea level, and Tanggula railway station at is the world&#x27;s highest railway station. The long Fenghuoshan tunnel is the highest rail tunnel in the world at above sea level.

In 2022, the Chinese government announced plans for the line to be electrified. Construction started in June 2022 and is expected to take three years, at a total cost of 14.84 billion yuan.

==Construction==

The capital of the Qinghai Province, Xining, became connected with the rest of the country by rail in 1959, when the Lanqing Railway from Lanzhou was completed.

The section of the future Qingzang Railway from Xining to Golmud, Qinghai opened to traffic in 1984. But the remaining section from Golmud to Lhasa could not be constructed until technical difficulties of building railroad tracks on permafrost were solved. This section was formally started on 29 June 2001, finished on 12 October 2005, and signaling work and track testing took another eight months. It was completed in five years at a cost of $3.68 billion.

Track-laying in Tibet was launched from both directions, towards Tanggula Mountain and Lhasa, from Amdo railway station on 22 June 2004. On 24 August 2005, track was laid at the railway&#x27;s highest point, the Tanggula Pass, above sea level.

There are 44 stations, among them Tanggula Mountain railway station, at the world&#x27;s highest. Peru&#x27;s Ticlio railway station at is the highest in the Americas (Cóndor station; at , on the Rio Mulatos-Potosí line, Bolivia, and La Galera station at , in Peru, being the next highest). The Qingzang Railway project involved more than 20,000 workers and over 6,000 pieces of industrial equipment, and is one of China&#x27;s major accomplishments of the 21st century.

Bombardier Transportation built 361 high-altitude passenger carriages with special enriched-oxygen and UV-protection systems, delivered between December 2005 and May 2006. Fifty-three are luxury sleeper carriages for tourist services.

The construction of the railway was part of the China Western Development strategy, an attempt to develop the western provinces of China, which are much less developed than eastern China. The railway will be extended to Zhangmu via Shigatse () to the west, and Dali via Nyingchi () to the east. A further extension is planned to link Shigatse with Yadong near the China-India border (Map). The railway is considered one of the greatest feats in modern Chinese history by the government, and as a result, is often mentioned on regular TV programs. Chinese-Tibetan folk singer Han Hong has a song called &quot;Tianlu&quot; (Road to Heaven; 天路) praising the Qingzang Railway.

=== Completed extensions ===
On 17 August 2008, a railway spokesman confirmed plans to add six more rail lines connecting to the Qinghai–Tibet railway, including from Lhasa to Nyingchi and from Lhasa to Shigatse, both in the Tibet Autonomous Region. Three lines will originate from Golmud in Qinghai province and run to Chengdu in Sichuan province, Dunhuang in Gansu province, and Korla of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The sixth will link Xining, the capital of Qinghai, with Zhangye in Gansu. The six lines are expected to be in operation before 2020. Construction work of the Lhasa–Shigatse extension began on 26 September 2010; it was opened in August 2014.

The construction of Dunhuang–Golmud railway began in December 2012 and finished on 18 December 2019. This new railway extends the existed Yinmaxia station on the Qinghai–Tibet Railway to Dunhuang, Gansu, establishing a direct connection between Xinjiang and Tibet.

=== Addition of capacity and electrification ===

Given that the Sichuan-Tibet railway is expected to be completed relatively later with less capacity, the Qinghai–Tibet railway is expected to add cargo capacity to fulfill the demand of material transportation. 13 stations along the Qinghai–Tibet railway have received extensions of sidings or passing loops, or these were built from scratch. This will allow the daily train received from Lhasa Railway station to expand from 6 to 12–14. An electrification feasibility study is also in progress.

===Connection to Nepal===
In a meeting between Chinese and Nepalese officials on 25 April 2008, the Chinese delegation announced the intention to extend the Qingzang railway originally to Zhangmu (Nepali: Khasa) on the Nepalese border. Nepal had requested that the railway be extended to enable trade and tourism between the two nations. The section Lhasa-Shigatse opened in August 2014. In June 2018, China and Nepal signed a series of agreements including the construction of Shigatse-Kathmandu railway during Nepali prime minister Oli&#x27;s visit to China.

China plans to extend this railway up to Lake Paiku/Gyirong, which is around 60 km from the Rasuwa border crossing. Construction of the railway from Shigatse to Gyirong is expected to start in 2025. The final part of the whole infrastructure will be the Gyirong-Katmandu railway.

== Route ==
Within the Golmud to Lhasa section of the line there are 45 stations, 38 of which are unstaffed and monitored by the control center in Xining. Thirteen more stations are planned.

The New Guanjiao Tunnel is the longest tunnel between Xining and Golmud, and the Yangbajing tunnel is the longest tunnel between Golmud and Lhasa. More than , over 80% of the Golmud–Lhasa section, is at an elevation of more than . There are 675 bridges, totalling ; about of track is laid on permafrost.
===Existing stations===
At above sea level Tanggula railway station is the highest railway station in the world . The second through fifth and tenth highest stations (Tanggula North, Tangguala South, Tuoju, Zhajiazangbu and Jiangkedong respectively) are also on this line. 

== Trains and tickets ==

The trains are specially built for high-elevation environments. The diesel locomotives for cargo were built by CSR Qishuyan (DF8B-9000 Series) and by CNR Erqi Locomotive (DF7G-8000 Series), and the locomotives for passenger transportation were built by GE in Pennsylvania (NJ2), and the passenger carriages are Chinese-made 25T carriages: on train Z21/Z22, between Beijing West and Lhasa, Bombardier Sifang Transportation (BSP) made carriages on the Golmud-Lhasa section in deep green/yellow or deep red/yellow. Signs in the carriages are in Tibetan, Chinese, and English. The operational speed is and over sections laid on permafrost.

The railway from Golmud to Lhasa was completed on 12 October 2005, and it opened to regular trial service on 1 July 2006.

The locomotives are turbocharged to combat the power-reducing effect of having to run on about half an atmosphere of air due to extreme altitude.

At the beginning, only three trains ran: Beijing–Lhasa (every day), Chengdu/Chongqing–Lhasa (every other day), and Lanzhou/Xining–Lhasa. Shanghai/Guangzhou–Lhasa services were added in October 2006. In July 2010, the Shanghai–Lhasa service became daily, and a daily service between Xining and Lhasa was added, but the service was then suspended for the winter season.

Since October 2006, five pairs of passenger trains run between Golmud and Lhasa, and one more pair between Xining and Golmud. The line has a capacity of eight pairs of passenger trains.
===Oxygen supply and medical issues===
The passenger carriages used on Lhasa trains are specially built and have an oxygen supply for each passenger. Every passenger train has a doctor.

A &quot;Passenger Health Registration Card&quot; is required to take the train between Golmud and Lhasa. The card can be obtained when purchasing the ticket. Passengers must read the health notice for high-elevation travel and sign the agreement on the card to take the train. On 28 August 2006, a 75-year-old Hong Kong man was reported to be the first passenger to die on the train, after he had suffered heart problems in Lhasa but insisted on travelling to Xining.

== Engineering challenges ==
There are many technical difficulties for such a railway. About half of the second section was built on barely permanent permafrost. In the summer, the uppermost layer thaws, and the ground becomes muddy. The heat from the trains passing above is able to melt the permafrost even with a small change in temperature. The main engineering challenge, aside from oxygen shortages, is the weakness of the permafrost. For areas of permafrost that are not very fragile, an embankment of large rocks is sufficient. Meanwhile, in the most fragile areas, the rail bed must be elevated like a bridge. The engineers dealt with this problem in the areas of weakest permafrost by building elevated tracks with pile-driven foundations sunk deep into the ground. Similar to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, portions of the track are also passively cooled with ammonia-based heat exchangers.

Due to climate change, temperatures in the Tibetan Plateau may be considered to increase by an estimated two to three degrees Celsius. This change is sufficient to melt the permafrost and thereby affect the integrity of the entire system. The effects of climate change on the railway have yet to be seen.

The air in Tibet is much thinner, with oxygen partial pressure being 35% to 40% below that at sea level. Special passenger carriages are used, and several oxygen factories were built along the railway. Each seat in the train is equipped with an oxygen supply outlet for any possible emergency. The Chinese government claimed that no construction workers died during the construction due to altitude sickness related diseases. The railway passes the Kunlun Mountains, an earthquake zone. The 7.8 Kunlun earthquake struck in 2001 (but caused no fatalities). Dozens of earthquake monitors have been installed along the railway.
== Impact ==
=== Economic ===
With limited industrial capacity in Tibet, the Tibetan economy heavily relies on industrial products from more developed parts of China. Transport of goods in and out of Tibet was mostly through the Qingzang Highway connecting Tibet to the adjacent Qinghai province, which was built in the early 1950s. The length and terrain have limited the capacity of the highway, with less than 1 million tons of goods transported each year. With the construction of the Qingzang railway, the cost of transportation of both passengers and goods should be greatly reduced, allowing for an increase in volume—the cost per tonne-kilometer will be reduced from 0.38 RMB to 0.12 RMB. It is projected that by 2010, 2.8 million tons will be carried to and from Tibet, with over 75% carried by the railway. Before the railway, the purchasing power of 100 RMB in Lhasa was only commensurate with 54 RMB in coastal regions of China, mainly due to high transport costs. The railway could elevate living standards along the route.

=== Social ===
Environmentalists and Tibetan independence activists protested against the construction of the railway. The Tibetan government-in-exile believes that the line and the further expansion of the rail network will contribute to further influx of Chinese people, the de-nationalization of Tibetans and the depletion of the region&#x27;s natural resources.

According to Chinese state news agency Xinhua News, the Qingzang railway has promoted the inheritance of Tibetan culture and religion, as the opening of the railway has increased the number of worshippers from all over the country coming to Lhasa. It also advantages Tibetans with accessibility to the rest part of China for tertiary education, employment, and market for local industries. Qiangba Puncog, former Chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region People&#x27;s Government, has appreciated the railway for introducing more tourism industries to the region with jobs for the local people.

=== Environmental ===

The environmental impact of the new railway is an ongoing concern. The increase in passenger traffic will result in greater tourism and economic activity on the Tibetan Plateau, and the construction of the railway may also negatively impact the local environment. For example, interference on earth, vegetation, and surface water heat exchange, which may cause freeze-thaw erosion and melting of ice if not handled properly. 
To reduce the interference, trash and excrement on the trains are collected into two sealed containers in each car, instead of disposing them on the tracks, and are taken out at large stations. There are also concerns from the China Meteorological Administration that melting, due to global warming, of the permafrost in Tibet on which part of the railway is placed may threaten the railway within the 21st century.

The effects of this railway on wild animals such as Tibetan antelope and plants are currently unknown. 33 wildlife crossing railway bridges were constructed specifically to allow continued animal migration.

=== Military ===

Commentators have noted the potential military impact of this railway as permitting the People&#x27;s Liberation Army more rapid troop mobilization to certain border areas in dispute with India.

<doc id="711572" wikidata="Q1006767" url="?curid=711572" title="Eynsham">
<text>Eynsham is a village and civil parish in the West Oxfordshire district, in Oxfordshire, England, about north-west of Oxford and east of Witney. The 2011 Census recorded a parish population of 4,648. It was estimated at 5,087 in 2020.

==Etymology==
Eynsham&#x27;s name is first attested in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, which took its present form in the later ninth century, as &quot;Egonesham&quot;. (The &quot;Chronicle&quot; portrays the settlement as one of four captured by a West Saxon named Cuthwulf in 571 CE following the Battle of Bedcanford. The historicity of the battle is, however, in doubt.) The name is thought to derive from the Old English personal name &quot;Ægen&quot;, in its genitive form &quot;Ægenes&quot;, combined with the word (&quot;river-meadow&quot;). Thus the name once meant &quot;Ægen&#x27;s river-meadow&quot;.

==History==

Eynsham grew up near the historically important ford of Swinford on the River Thames flood plain. Excavations have shown that the site was used in the Bronze Age (3000–300 BCE) for a rectilinear enclosure edging a gravel terrace. Evidence has been found of 6th–7th-century Saxon buildings at New Wintles Farm, about three-quarters of a mile (1 km) from the present parish church. There is evidence that Eynsham had an early minster, probably founded in the 7th or 8th centuries. In the reign of the early ninth-century Mercian king Cenwulf, Eynsham was the site of a royal manor of three-hundred hides.

In 1005 Aethelmar, kinsman of Aethelred II founded a Benedictine abbey on the site of the earlier minster. The first abbot was Ælfric of Eynsham, a prolific writer in Old English. The Domesday Book of 1086 includes a paragraph on the settlement, then known as Eglesham. By 1302 Eynsham had a wharf handling cargo that included hay, straw, malt, grain and timber, beside the later Talbot Inn on Wharf Stream, a tributary of the Thames. By the medieval period Eynsham Abbey was among the largest in the area. It succumbed to the Reformation in 1538 and few remains can be seen today. After the dissolution, its estates were granted to Sir George Darcy.

By 1790 a newly completed Oxford Canal was trading with Eynsham Wharf, mainly to sell coal from the Midlands. From 1792 the Oxford Canal employed a wharfinger at Eynsham and in 1800 bought the lease of the wharf. It consolidated its position by buying the Talbot Inn in 1845 and the freehold of Eynsham Wharf in 1849, perhaps in response to the railway mania that was taking traffic from canals and navigations. Eynsham Lock, on the Thames just above the confluence with Wharf Stream, was the last flash lock on the Thames, not rebuilt as a pound lock until 1928. The village suffered several fires in its history. Among the worst were a Whit Monday morning one in 1629, which destroyed 12 houses and another in 1681 that destroyed 20. By the early 19th century the parish had its own fire engine in a parish fire station on the ground floor of the early 18th-century Bartholomew Room, where it remained up to 1949.

The Bartholomew Room was built in 1703 from an endowment of John Liam Bartholomew in 1701 to found a parish charity school. Its lower storey was arcaded, presumably as market premises, but the arcades were walled up in the later 19th century. While some parts of the ground floor continued to serve as the fire station; others were turned into a village gaol. From 1928, a local Roman Catholic congregation used the upper room for its services. In 1983 the parish council bought and restored the building.

===Roads===

By the mid-18th century, Swinford had a ferry, but the main road was in poor condition. Heavier road traffic between Oxford and Witney preferred to pass further north via Bladon, where the better-maintained Oxford–Woodstock and Witney–Woodstock roads met. When the latter became a turnpike in 1751, the road via Eynsham and Swinford ferry was included as a branch. In 1769 the Earl of Abingdon opened Swinford Toll Bridge to replace the ferry. The Witney–Woodstock road ceased to be a turnpike in 1869, but the Witney–Oxford road remained one until 1877. Eynsham was a major coaching stop on the London–Fishguard road. Since 1922 this has been numbered as the A40. There is a planned expansion of the A40 between Eynsham and Witney into a dual carriage way, with work expected to commence in 2023 should planning permission be granted. In 1936 a bypass for the main road was built north of the village and the road over Swinford bridge renumbered as B4044.

===Rail===
The Witney Railway between Witney and Yarnton opened through Eynsham parish in 1861. The station was on the south side of the village. The Great Western Railway took over the line in 1890 and enlarged Eynsham station in 1944. British Railways closed the line to passenger trains in 1962 and in 1970 to goods traffic. The track was dismantled. The station has since been demolished and a business park built there. In February 2015 the Witney Oxford Transport Group proposed reopening the station as an alternative to improving the A40 road as proposed by Oxfordshire County Council. The case centred on the severe traffic congestion on the roads to and from Oxford.

===Industry===
Local industries include gravel extraction and a factory for superconducting magnets, Siemens Magnet Technology Ltd.

==Churches==
===Church of England===
The Church of England parish church, St Leonard&#x27;s, was built the 13th century. In the 15th, the nave was rebuilt, a clerestory and north aisle were added and a west tower was built. There are Mass dials on the south wall. The building was restored three times: by William Wilkinson in 1856, Harry Drinkwater in 1892 and over eight years in the 1980s. The west tower has a ring of six bells. James Keene of Woodstock cast the third in 1653. Richard Keene cast the fifth in 1673. John Taylor &amp; Co of Loughborough cast or recast the treble, second, fourth and tenor bells in 1895. The church also has a Sanctus bell that Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast in 1924. St Leonard&#x27;s is a Grade II* listed building.

===Baptist===
The Baptist church in Lombard Street was opened in either 1808 or 1818.

===Roman Catholic===
In 1895 Herbert May founded a Roman Catholic mission at his home, Newland Lodge. The lodge burnt down in 1897, after which Mass was said at the Railway Inn until May had a new house built for him. The mission closed when May moved to Oxford. In 1928 the Roman Catholic parish of Witney leased the upper storey of the Bartholomew Room, making it St Peter&#x27;s Chapel. Building of a new Roman Catholic church began in the 1930s but was delayed by the Second World War and completed only in 1967.

==Amenities==
Eynsham Primary School is a community primary school. Eynsham&#x27;s Bartholomew School is the county secondary school for the district. As a specialist technology college, it draws pupils mainly from primaries at Eynsham, Standlake, Stanton Harcourt, Freeland, Cassington and Hanborough.

Eynsham Football Club plays in the Oxfordshire Senior League Division One. Eynsham Sports and Social Club plays in Witney and District Football League Division Three and its reserve team in Division Four. Eynsham Cricket Club plays in Oxfordshire Cricket Association League Division Three.

Eynsham has a Women&#x27;s Institute and a Morris dancing troupe.

<doc id="711578" wikidata="Q2935203" url="?curid=711578" title="Camp 4 (Yosemite)">
<text>Camp 4 is a tent-only campground in Yosemite National Park in the United States. It became notable after World War II as &quot;a birthplace of rock climbing’s modern age.&quot; It is located at an elevation of 4000 ft (1200 m) on the north side of the Yosemite Valley, close to base of granite cliffs near Yosemite Falls.

Nearby boulders have long been used for bouldering, including the Columbia Boulder, which is known for the boulder problem called the &quot;Midnight Lightning,&quot; first done by Ron Kauk in 1978. It is easily recognizable by a painting of a white thunderbolt next to it.

== History ==
Physically unimpressive, Camp 4 nevertheless &quot;served as a seedbed for the exchange of ideas, training and the development of new equipment that vastly improved the speed and safety of climbing&quot; (LA Times) during the time from after World War II until around 1970. Dozens of the most famous climbers in the world congregated at Camp 4 for years, learning from each other and trying out new ideas on Yosemite walls such as Half Dome and El Capitan. Yvon Chouinard (today known as founder of the outdoor clothing retailer Patagonia, Inc.) prototyped new kinds of climbing equipment in Camp 4 using an old anvil, and sold them in the nearby parking lot.

From the 1970s on, a new group of climbers led by Jim Bridwell and others based at Camp 4 (known as the &quot;Stone Masters&quot; from 1973 to 80) introduced a more athletic approach to climbing and popularized free climbing.

In the 1990s, Camp 4 was the site of ongoing friction between climbers and the National Park Service. The conflict came to a head in 1997, when flooding in Yosemite Valley destroyed many employee housing units and the Park Service proposed to build a three-story dormitory complex near Camp 4. With the support of other activists, rock climber and climbing equipment manufacturer Tom Frost initiated a lawsuit against the Park Service, arguing that the buildings would disturb the camp&#x27;s natural setting. The suit was joined by the American Alpine Club. As part of their attempt to stop the construction project, Frost and his attorney Dick Duane also filed an application to have Camp 4 listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The park officials ultimately agreed to stop the development plans and to support the NRHP application, which was granted in 2003, based on the camp&#x27;s &quot;significant association with the growth and development of rock climbing in the Yosemite Valley during the &#x27;golden years&#x27; of pioneer mountaineering&quot;.

From 1971 to 1999, Camp 4 was officially known as &quot;Sunnyside Walk-in Campground&quot;, but has been since renamed Camp 4 in recognition of its historic status. During this era, however, the campsite was known colloquially to climbers as Camp 4. Throughout the period, the campground was the seasonal residence of many of Yosemite Valley&#x27;s most prominent climbers.

A 2012 rockfall hazard report concluded that several campsites on the northern side of Camp 4 needed to be relocated to achieve adequate safety for climbers.

The 2014 documentary Valley Uprising features veterans of Camp 4 including Warren Harding (dubbed &quot;the original bad boy of Camp 4&quot; for his risk-taking, rebellious attitude, and alcohol consumption), and Beverly Johnson (who in 1973 was part of the first all-female ascent of El Capitan).

== Reservations and availability ==

Camp 4 does not offer traditional reservations at any time during the year, and the process for attaining a camping site differs depending on the season. 

Mid-April through October
From April 13 through October 27, 2024, campsites will be available only by reservation via Recreation.gov one week in advance of your arrival date. Up to 6 people can be registered for a site per each reservation transaction. The camping fee is $10 per person per night.

November to mid-April
Camp 4 operates on a first-come, first-served basis, usually until sometime in April. The campground may fill early in the morning every day in spring and fall if weather is nice. The camping fee is $10 per night. In spring and fall, a line of those wishing to camp here typically forms at the campground kiosk early in the morning.

A total of 36 sites are available daily, each accommodating a maximum of six people (i.e., 216 spots total) at a cost of US$10 per person per night. Notably, the Park Service has imposed a 30-night camping limit within Yosemite National Park per calendar year; however, from 1 May to 15 September, the camping limit in Yosemite is 14 nights, with only seven of those nights allowed in Yosemite Valley or Wawona. Because of the popularity of the camp, the relatively small number of camp sites, and the lack of reservation availability, it can be difficult to be able to camp at this campground, except for the winter season, which is less busy.

<doc id="711579" wikidata="Q1993156" url="?curid=711579" title="Elements (Atheist album)">
<text>Elements is the third studio album released by Florida technical death metal band Atheist, released on August 30, 1993, by Music for Nations in Europe and by Metal Blade Records in the US. 

&quot;Elements&quot; was Atheist&#x27;s last studio album for 17 years, until the 2010 release of &quot;Jupiter&quot;. The album was reissued by Relapse Records in 2005 and was digitally remastered with the addition of six bonus tracks.

==Background==
&quot;Elements&quot; was written, recorded and mixed in forty days in Pro Media Studios. Atheist desired to disband, but they were required to complete their junior album in order to fulfill a contract to their record label. &quot;Elements&quot; features the addition of a third guitarist, Frank Emmi. Initially, Rand Burkey was not going to appear on the album, and as Kelly Shaefer had developed carpal tunnel syndrome, preventing him from playing anything but rhythm guitar, a new lead guitar player was needed. Before recording, Burkey rejoined the band, and thus the band ended up with three guitarists. Shaefer plays rhythm guitar, while Emmi and Burkey share responsibilities for leads and solos.

==Musical style==
Eduardo Rivadavia described the album for Allmusic as remaining &quot;admirably true to the band&#x27;s famously complicated arrangements, syncopated rhythms, and ultra-precise attack, but also boast[ing] a cleaner musicality never before attempted by the group&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Elements&quot; was described by James Hinchcliffe in &quot;Terrorizer&quot; as &quot;less frantic and jazz-leaning than &quot;Unquestionable Presence&quot;, and packed with unexpectedly Latin rhythms&quot; that caused the album to &quot;hurtle...to the edge of metal&quot;. Eduardo Rivadavia praised the band for &quot;delivering another highly accomplished set that illustrated both a natural evolution of their sound and served as a worthy final chapter to their all-too-brief and very troubled trajectory&quot;.

==Track listing==
===2005 Re-release===

<text>Enalapril, sold under the brand name Vasotec among others, is an ACE inhibitor medication used to treat high blood pressure, diabetic kidney disease, and heart failure. For heart failure, it is generally used with a diuretic, such as furosemide. It is given by mouth or by injection into a vein. Onset of effects are typically within an hour when taken by mouth and last for up to a day.
Common side effects include headache, tiredness, feeling lightheaded with standing, and cough. Serious side effects include angioedema and low blood pressure. Use during pregnancy is believed to result in harm to the baby. It is in the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor family of medications.
Enalapril was patented in 1978, and came into medical use in 1984. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 141st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 4million prescriptions. It is available as a generic medicine.

==Medical uses==

Enalapril is used to treat hypertension, symptomatic heart failure, and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. ACE-inhibitors (including enalapril) have demonstrated ability to reduce the progression and worsening of existing chronic kidney disease in the presence of proteinuria/microalbuminuria (protein in the urine, a biomarker for chronic kidney disease). This renal protective effect is not seen in the absence of proteinuria/microalbuminuria, including in diabetic populations. The benefit has been particularly demonstrated in patients with hypertension and/or diabetes, and is likely to be seen in other populations (although further studies and subgroup analyses of existing studies are needed) It is widely used in chronic kidney failure. Furthermore, enalapril is an emerging treatment for psychogenic polydipsia. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed that when used for this purpose, enalapril led to decreased water consumption (determined by urine output and osmolality) in 60% of patients.

==Side effects==
The most common side effects of enalapril include increased serum creatinine (20%), dizziness (2–8%), low blood pressure (1–7%), syncope (2%), and dry cough (1–2%). The most serious common adverse event is angioedema (swelling) (0.68%) which often affects the face and lips, endangering the patient&#x27;s airway. Angioedema can occur at any point during treatment with enalapril, but is most common after the first few doses. Angioedema and fatality therefrom are reportedly higher among black people. Agranulocytosis has been observed with Enalapril.

Some evidence suggests enalapril will cause injury and death to a developing fetus. In pregnancy, enalapril may result in damage to the fetus&#x27;s kidneys and resulting oligohydramnios (not enough amniotic fluid). Enalapril is secreted in breast milk and is not recommended for use while breastfeeding.

==Mechanism of action==

Normally, angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II by an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II constricts blood vessels, increasing blood pressure. Enalaprilat, the active metabolite of enalapril, inhibits ACE. Inhibition of ACE decreases levels of angiotensin II, leading to less vasoconstriction and decreased blood pressure.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Pharmacokinetic data of enalapril:
* Onset of action: about 1 hour
* Peak effect: 4–6 hours
* Duration: 12–24 hours
* Absorption: ~60%
* Metabolism: prodrug, undergoes biotransformation to enalaprilat

== Structure activity relationship ==
Enalapril has an L-proline moiety as a part of the molecule which is responsible for the oral bioavailability of the drug. It is a pro-drug, which means that it exerts its function after being metabolized. The &quot;-OCH2CH3&quot; part of the molecule will split during the metabolism and at the carbon will be a carboxylate, which then interacts with the Zn+2 site of the ACE enzyme. This structural feature and mechanism of metabolism that must occur before the drug can inhibit the enzyme explains why it has a greater duration of action than another similar drug used for the same indication, Captopril. Duration of effect is dose-related; at recommended doses, antihypertensive and haemodynamic effects have been shown to be maintained for at least 24 hours. Enalapril has a slower onset of action than Captopril but a greater duration of action. However, unlike Captopril, Enalapril does not have a thiol moiety.

==History==
Squibb developed the first ACE inhibitor, captopril, but it had adverse effects such as a metallic taste (which, as it turned out, was due to the sulfhydryl group). Merck developed enalapril as a competing product.

Enalaprilat was developed first, partly to overcome these limitations of captopril. The sulfhydryl moiety was replaced by a carboxylate moiety, but additional modifications were required in its structure-based design to achieve a potency similar to captopril. Enalaprilat, however, had a problem of its own in that it had poor oral availability. This was overcome by the Merck researchers through the esterification of enalaprilat with ethanol to produce enalapril.

Merck introduced enalapril to market in 1981; it became Merck&#x27;s first billion dollar-selling drug in 1988. The patent expired in 2000, opening the way for generics.

== Society and culture ==
=== Legal status ===
In September 2023, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a pediatric use marketing authorization for the medicinal product Aqumeldi, intended for the treatment of heart failure in children from birth to less than 18 years of age. The applicant for this medicinal product is Proveca Pharma Limited. Aqumeldi was approved for medical use in the European Union in November 2023.

<doc id="711597" wikidata="Q200781" url="?curid=711597" title="Pleural empyema">
<text>Pleural empyema is a collection of pus in the pleural cavity caused by microorganisms, usually bacteria. Often it happens in the context of a pneumonia, injury, or chest surgery. It is one of the various kinds of pleural effusion. There are three stages: exudative, when there is an increase in pleural fluid with or without the presence of pus; fibrinopurulent, when fibrous septa form localized pus pockets; and the final organizing stage, when there is scarring of the pleura membranes with possible inability of the lung to expand. Simple pleural effusions occur in up to 40% of bacterial pneumonias. They are usually small and resolve with appropriate antibiotic therapy. If however an empyema develops additional intervention is required.

== Signs and symptoms ==
The clinical presentation of both the adult and pediatric patient with pleural empyema depends upon several factors, including the causative micro-organism. Most cases present themselves in the setting of a pneumonia, although up to one third of patients do not have clinical signs of pneumonia and as many as 25% of cases are associated with trauma (including surgery). Symptoms include fever, dry cough, sweating, difficulty breathing, and unintentional weight loss. The elderly often do not have classic symptoms, but instead have anemia and exhaustion.

== Mechanism ==
When there is inflammation at the pleural space, fluid is produced at a greater level. As the disease progresses, bacteria can arrive at the fluid, which created an empyema.

== Diagnosis ==
The initial investigations for suspected empyema remains chest X-ray, although it cannot differentiate an empyema from uninfected parapneumonic effusion. Ultrasound must be used to confirm the presence of a pleural fluid collection and can be used to estimate the size of the effusion, differentiate between free and loculated pleural fluid and guide thoracocentesis if necessary. Chest CT and MRI do not provide additional information in most cases and should therefore not be performed routinely. On a CT scan, empyema fluid most often has a radiodensity of about 0-20 Hounsfield units (HU), but gets over 30 HU when becoming more thickened with time.

The most often used &quot;golden&quot; criteria for empyema are pleural effusion with macroscopic presence of pus, a positive Gram stain or culture of pleural fluid, or a pleural fluid pH under 7.2 with normal peripheral blood pH. Clinical guidelines for adult patients therefore advocate diagnostic pleural fluid aspiration in patients with pleural effusion in association with sepsis or pneumonic illness. Because pleural effusion in the pediatric population is almost always parapneumonic and the need for chest tube drainage can be made on clinical grounds, British guidelines for the management of pleural infection in children do not recommend diagnostic pleural fluid sampling.

Blood and sputum culture has often already been performed in the setting of community acquired pneumonia needing hospitalization. It should however be noted that the micro-organism responsible for development of empyema is not necessarily the same as the organism causing the pneumonia, especially in adults. As already mentioned before, sensitivity of pleural fluid culture is generally low, often partly due to prior administration of antibiotics. It has been shown that culture yield can be increased from 44% to 69% if pleural fluid is injected into blood culture bottles (aerobic and anaerobic) immediately after aspiration. Furthermore, diagnostic rates can be improved for specific pathogens using polymerase chain reaction or antigen detection, especially for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. In a study including 78 children with pleural empyema, the causative micro-organism could be identified using direct culture of fresh pleural fluid in 45% of patients, with an additional 28% using PCR on pleural fluid of negative cultures. Pneumococcal antigen detection in pleural fluid samples by latex agglutination can also be useful for rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal empyema. In the previously noted study, positive and negative predictive value of pneumococcal antigen detection was 95% and 90%, respectively.

== Treatment ==

=== Pleural fluid drainage ===
Proven empyema (as defined by the &quot;golden&quot; criteria mentioned earlier) is an indication for prompt chest tube drainage. This has been shown to improve resolution of the infection and shorten hospital admission. Data from a meta-analysis has shown that a pleural fluid pH of &lt;7.2 is the most powerful indicator to predict the need for chest tube drainage in patients with non-purulent, culture negative fluid.

Because of the viscous, lumpy nature of infected pleural fluid, in combination with possible septation and loculation, it has been proposed that intrapleural fibrinolytic or mucolytic therapy might improve drainage and therefore might have a positive effect on the clinical outcome. Intrapleural fibrinolysis with urokinase decreased the need for surgery but there is a trend to increased serious side effects.

Approximately 15 to 40 percent of people require surgical drainage of the infected pleural space because of inadequate drainage due to clogging of the chest tube or loculated empyema. Patients should thus be considered for surgery if they have ongoing signs of sepsis in association with a persistent pleural collection despite drainage and antibiotics.

===Antibiotics===

There is no readily available evidence on the route of administration and duration of antibiotics in patients with pleural empyema. Experts agree that all patients should be hospitalized and treated with antibiotics intravenously. The specific antimicrobial agent should be chosen based on Gram stain and culture, or on local epidemiologic data when these are not available. Anaerobic coverage must be included in all adults, and in children if aspiration is likely. Good pleural fluid and empyema penetration has been reported in adults for penicillins, ceftriaxone, metronidazole, clindamycin, vancomycin, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin. Aminoglycosides should typically be avoided as they have poor penetration into the pleural space. There is no clear consensus on duration of intravenous and oral therapy. Switching to oral antibiotics can be considered upon clinical and objective improvement (adequate drainage and removal of chest tube, declining CRP, temperature normalization). Oral antibiotic treatment should then be continued for another 1–4 weeks, again based on clinical, biochemical and radiological response.

== Prognosis ==
All patients with empyema require outpatient follow-up with a repeat chest X-ray and inflammatory biochemistry analysis within 4 weeks following discharge. Chest radiograph returns to normal in the majority of patients by 6 months. Patients should, of course, be advised to return sooner if symptoms redevelop. Long-term sequelae of pleural empyema are rare but include bronchopleural fistula formation, recurrent empyema and pleural thickening, which may lead to functional lung impairment needing surgical decortication.

Mortality in children is generally reported to be less than 3%. No reliable clinical, radiological or pleural fluid characteristics accurately determine patients&#x27; prognosis at initial presentation.

== Epidemiology ==
The incidence of pleural empyema and the prevalence of specific causative microorganisms varies depending on the source of infection (community acquired vs. hospital acquired pneumonia), the age of the patient and host immune status. Risk factors include alcoholism, drug use, HIV infection, neoplasm and pre-existent pulmonary disease. Pleural empyema was found in 0.7% of 3675 patients needing hospitalization for a community acquired pneumonia in a recent Canadian single-center prospective study. A multi-center study from the UK including 430 adult patients with community acquired pleural empyema found negative pleural-fluid cultures in 54% of patients, Streptococcus milleri group in 16%, Staphylococcus aureus in 12%, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 8%, other Streptococci in 7% and anaerobic bacteria in 8%.

The risk of empyema in children seems to be comparable to adults. Using the United States Kids&#x27; Inpatient Database the incidence is calculated to be around 1.5% in children hospitalized for community acquired pneumonia, although percentages up to 30% have been reported in individual hospitals, a difference which may be explained by an transient endemic of highly invasive serotype or overdiagnosis of small parapneumonic effusions. The distribution of causative organisms does differ greatly from that in adults: in an analysis of 78 children with community acquired pleural empyema, no micro-organism was found in 27% of patients, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 51%, Streptococcus pyogenes in 9% and Staphylococcus aureus in 8%.

Although pneumococcal vaccination dramatically decreased the incidence of pneumonia in children, it did not have this effect on the incidence of complicated pneumonia. It has been shown that the incidence of empyema in children was already on the rise at the end of the 20th century, and that the widespread use of pneumococcal vaccination did not slow down this trend. This might in part be explained by a change in prevalence of (more invasive) pneumococcal serotypes, some of which are not covered by the vaccine, as well a rise in incidence of pneumonia caused by other streptococci and staphylococci.

<text>The Latvia national football team () represents Latvia in men&#x27;s international football, and is controlled by the Latvian Football Federation, the governing body for football in Latvia. They have never qualified for the FIFA World Cup, but did qualify for the European Championship in 2004 under head coach Aleksandrs Starkovs.

Latvia, alongside their Baltic rivals, Lithuania and Estonia, have also participated in the local sub-regional Baltic Cup tournament, which takes place every two years. Latvia has won the Baltic Cup championship a record 13 times, more than any other country in the history of the tournament, most recently in 2018.

Latvia&#x27;s current home ground is the Daugava Stadium in Riga, although since the autumn of 2022 most games have been held at Skonto Stadium.

==History==
=== Early years ===
The Latvia national football team played their first official match on September 24, 1922, against Estonia, resulting in a 1–1 draw. The first goal in the team&#x27;s history was scored by forward Edvīns Bārda. In 1920, the Latvian Football Union (today - Latvijas Futbola federācija) was established, which led to the formation of the national team. Latvia participated in the Football at the 1924 Summer Olympics, but lost their only match 0–7 to France. The team&#x27;s first victory came on 18 October 1924, against Estonia, winning 2–0.

In 1928, Latvia triumphed in the inaugural Baltic Cup, defeating the national teams of Lithuania and Estonia. During the 1920s, some of the standout players included goalkeeper Arvīds Jurgens and the Bārda brothers—Edvīns, Arvīds, and Rūdolfs—as well as Voldemārs Grāvelis, Arnolds Tauriņš, and Alberts Šeibelis.

The 1930s marked a period of growth for the Latvian national team, particularly between 1936 and 1938 under Austrian coach Rudolf Stanzl. Latvia frequently played friendly matches against teams such as Lithuania, Estonia, Finland, Sweden, and Poland. In 1937, Latvia participated in the 1938 FIFA World Cup qualification. Placed in Group 8 alongside Austria and Lithuania, Latvia achieved notable victories, beating Lithuania 4–2 in Riga, with a Fricis Kaņeps hat-trick and a goal from Iļja Vestermans. In Kaunas, they secured a 5–1 win with two goals each from Kaņeps, Vaclavs Borduško, and Iļja Vestermans. However, they lost 1–2 in a decisive away match against Austria, despite an early goal from Vestermans.

In April 1938, Austria&#x27;s Anschluss rendered their team ineligible to participate in the FIFA World Cup. Despite Latvia being the group&#x27;s runner-up, FIFA did not invite them to replace Austria.

Latvia played 99 official matches during the pre-war period from 1922 to 1940 and won the Baltic Cup 12 times. The last match of the pre-war Latvian national team was on July 18, 1940, against Estonia, ending in a 1–2 loss. The outbreak of World War II initially limited and eventually halted the team&#x27;s activities entirely. During the German and Soviet occupations, the Latvian national team ceased to exist in its form during Latvia&#x27;s independence.

The best players of the 1930s included Jānis Lidmanis, Ēriks Raisters, Jānis Rozītis, Fricis Kaņeps, Iļja Vestermans, and Aleksandrs Vanags. Ēriks Pētersons is considered the greatest Latvian footballer of the pre-war era, having scored 21 goals in 63 matches for the national team.

=== Latvian SSR National Team During the Soviet Era (1940–1991) ===
Latvian football&#x27;s evident growth was abruptly halted and devastated when, in 1940, Latvia was occupied and annexed by the Soviet Union.
The largest internal sports event in the Soviet Union was the Spartakiad of the Peoples of the USSR. Football was included in some editions, featuring teams representing the Soviet republics, as well as Moscow and Leningrad. In the 1956 Spartakiad, Latvia was represented by FC Daugava Riga. The team played four matches, securing three victories and suffering one defeat, with a goal difference of 10–7.

Football returned to the Spartakiad program only in 1979, and once again, Latvia was represented by FC Daugava Riga. However, the results were poor, with one victory and five losses, and a goal difference of 10–16. In subsequent Spartakiads, youth teams (under 20 years old) participated instead.

During the Soviet occupation, the Latvian SSR national football team continued to compete in the Baltic Cup — a tournament first held in 1928 — until 1976.

=== The Early Years of the Restored Latvian National Team (1992–1997) ===
The country regained its independence in 1991, before, in 1990, the Latvian Football Federation (LFF) was reestablished, and Latvia rejoined FIFA shortly after regaining independence. However, the Latvian national football team had to be built from scratch. In December 1991, during an LFF executive committee meeting, Jānis Gilis was appointed as the first head coach of the restored national team. It was decided that the position of national team head coach was of such importance that it should not be combined with any club coaching roles. Gilis committed to focusing entirely on the national team, stepping down from his role with FK Pārdaugava&#x27;s youth team. His competitor for the position, Marks Zahodins, expressed willingness to support Gilis as an assistant coach if needed.

Following his appointment, Gilis emphasized the challenge of assembling a team from scratch, meeting with potential players, and ensuring that those selected prioritized national pride above all else. The experimental team fielded in the autumn of 1991 was put together hastily, even lacking proper kits initially. Offers from international suppliers soon resolved this issue, and Gilis selected Vadims Ulbergs and Vladimirs Beškarevs as his assistants.

Latvia&#x27;s first victory came on July 10, 1992, with a 2–1 win over Estonia, thanks to two goals by Ainārs Linards. Later that summer, Latvia began its campaign in the 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification tournament. The team achieved historic draws against Spain (0–0) and Denmark (0–0) but suffered heavy defeats to Spain (0–5) and Ireland (0–4). With five draws and five points, Latvia finished 6th out of 7 teams in their group. Key players during this period included former Riga &quot;Daugava&quot; stars such as Jurijs Popkovs, Jurijs Ševļakovs, Oļegs Aleksejenko, Ainārs Linards, and Oļegs Karavajevs, as well as promising newcomers like Mihails Zemļinskis and Vitālijs Astafjevs.

In the qualification campaign for the 1996 UEFA European Championship, Latvia demonstrated increasing competitiveness, securing wins against Austria and Northern Ireland. The most memorable match of the campaign was a 2–3 loss to Portugal in Porto, where Latvia rallied from a 0–3 halftime deficit with two goals from young striker Vīts Rimkus, who became the team&#x27;s top scorer of the campaign with five goals in five matches. This period also saw the emergence of new talents such as Imants Bleidelis, Andrejs Štolcers, and Igors Stepanovs.

In the qualification for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Latvia faced tough competition, narrowly losing to Austria, Scotland, and Sweden. However, the team secured victories against Belarus and Estonia. By this time, the squad&#x27;s core included Skonto FC players such as Vitālijs Astafjevs, Igors Stepanovs, Marians Pahars, and Andrejs Štolcers.

In late 1997, Jānis Gilis stepped down as head coach, marking the end of an era. Around the same time, team captain and defensive leader Jurijs Ševļakovs retired from international football. These years laid the groundwork for Latvia&#x27;s growing competitiveness on the international stage.

=== The 100th Game of the Restored Latvian National Team ===
On April 8, 1992, after a 52-year hiatus, the restored Latvian national football team played its first match in Bucharest, losing 0–2 to Romania. This marked Latvia&#x27;s 100th match in its football history, with 10,000 spectators in attendance. The players experienced unfamiliar conditions, as accommodations, catering, and training facilities were of the highest standard.

A notable figure in the Latvian Football Federation (LFF) delegation was Vadims Ulbergs, who had witnessed the previous match between Latvia and Romania in 1937, a 0–0 draw at the ASK Stadium in Riga. The match in Bucharest attracted significant media attention, with representatives from all teams in the upcoming qualification cycle present, including the Belgian coach Paul van Himst.

Romania fielded an almost full-strength team, with the only notable absence being Gheorghe Hagi, who was withheld by Real Madrid. The match also marked the debut of Romania&#x27;s coach, Cornel Dinu. The game was hosted at the Complexul Sportiv Steaua, referred to as the &quot;Temple of Romanian Football,&quot; built under the direction of one of Nicolae Ceaușescu&#x27;s sons and maintained by the army. Tickets for the match were priced at 150 lei, approximately $2.50.

Latvia’s head coach, Jānis Gilis, opted to trust younger players and implemented a tactical scheme with two free defenders, placing additional pressure on the midfielders and forwards. The first half was promising, but in the second half, a lack of discipline allowed Romania to dominate territorially.

The match began with a costly mistake when goalkeeper Raimonds Laizāns slipped while preparing to save a 30-meter shot from Pavel Badea, allowing the ball to soar into the net. Latvia had an opportunity to equalize when Aivars Drupass, assisted by Jurijs Popkovs, made a sharp strike from six meters, but Romania’s goalkeeper Bogdan Stelea reacted brilliantly. Another defensive error early in the second half led to Romania’s second goal. Despite this, Laizāns recovered his composure, earning applause for saving a free kick by Gabi Balint in the 84th minute.

Rolands Bulders also came close to scoring but couldn’t produce a strong enough shot in a favorable position. While the team showed resilience, Gilis expressed disappointment with some players, including Vitālijs Teplovs and Aivars Drupass, who played with a minor injury. Ilmārs Verpakovskis, meanwhile, struggled due to his age. Gilis emphasized the need for a stronger attack, acknowledging that solid defense alone wouldn’t secure victories.

Romanian observers were astonished to learn that none of the Latvian players had ever competed for the Soviet national team or played in the Soviet Top League. This game provided Latvia with an opportunity to showcase its potential on the international stage, serving as a catalyst for growth. However, progress was hampered by a lack of professionalism in some teams and a casual attitude toward training among certain players.

=== The Starkovs–Verpakovskis Era and UEFA Euro 2004 (2001–2004) ===
Following Gary Johnson&#x27;s departure, the experienced Skonto FC head coach Aleksandrs Starkovs was appointed as the head coach of the Latvian national team. Under Starkovs&#x27; leadership, Latvia finished the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification cycle with three narrow defeats against group favorites, showcasing the team&#x27;s growing competitiveness. 

The UEFA Euro 2004 qualification campaign began with a 0–0 draw against Sweden, followed by a vital 1–0 victory over Poland. Latvia then secured two wins against San Marino but suffered a setback with a loss to Hungary. Māris Verpakovskis emerged as the team&#x27;s new offensive leader, replacing injury-plagued Marians Pahars, while veteran striker Vīts Rimkus returned to the squad.

Despite a 0–2 loss to Poland, which complicated Latvia’s position in the standings, the team rebounded with a 3–1 win over Hungary and a crucial 1–0 victory against Sweden. Verpakovskis scored in both matches, helping Latvia secure second place in their group and earn a spot in the play-offs.

In November 2003, Latvia faced Turkey, a strong opponent who had recently reached the semi-finals of the 2002 FIFA World Cup. In the first leg in Riga, Verpakovskis scored the only goal, giving Latvia a 1–0 advantage. The second leg in Istanbul was dramatic, with Turkey taking a 2–0 lead. However, Latvia fought back with goals from Juris Laizāns and Verpakovskis, securing a 2–2 draw. With a 3–2 aggregate victory, Latvia qualified for the UEFA European Championship for the first time in its history. 

The key players during this period included Verpakovskis, captain Vitālijs Astafjevs, midfielders Juris Laizāns and Andrejs Rubins, defenders Mihails Zemļinskis and Igors Stepanovs, and goalkeeper Aleksandrs Koliņko.

== Performance at UEFA Euro 2004 ==
In the Euro 2004 finals held in Portugal, Latvia was drawn into a challenging group alongside the Czech Republic, Germany, and the Netherlands. In their opening match, Latvia delivered a strong performance but lost 1–2 to the Czech Republic, with Verpakovskis scoring Latvia’s first-ever goal in a major tournament. 

The second match against Germany was historic, as Latvia achieved a 0–0 draw, earning their first point at a European Championship. The final group stage match saw Latvia face the Netherlands, where they suffered a 0–3 defeat, ending their journey in the tournament.

Although Latvia did not advance past the group stage, their performances, especially the draw against Germany, were widely praised. The campaign marked a golden era for Latvian football, with Starkovs&#x27; strategic leadership and Verpakovskis&#x27; outstanding form bringing the team to unprecedented heights.

This period remains a cornerstone in Latvian football history, demonstrating the team’s ability to compete on the European stage and inspiring future generations.

== 2006 FIFA World Cup Qualification ==
After Latvia&#x27;s historic success at UEFA Euro 2004, Aleksandrs Starkovs remained at the helm of the national team, but subsequent results failed to meet the high expectations set during the golden era. Latvia struggled in the qualification campaigns for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2008. The team faced challenges in maintaining consistency, and the departure of key players like Māris Verpakovskis and Mihails Zemļinskis from their peak form further weakened the squad.

Under Aleksandrs Starkovs, Latvia began its 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign, but controversy struck in the opening match against Portugal when Starkovs was suspended for six games. His assistant, Jurijs Andrejevs, took charge from the sidelines, while Starkovs continued as head coach for the next four matches.

In November 2004, Starkovs resigned from his role, opting to manage Spartak Moscow in Russia. Andrejevs was promoted to head coach but failed to deliver notable success. Latvia ended the qualification cycle in 5th place in their group with 15 points from 12 matches. The team managed victories only against Luxembourg and Liechtenstein and drew with Russia, Estonia, and Slovakia. Notably, Latvia suffered their first defeat to Estonia since 1940, losing 1–2.

== 2008 UEFA European Championship Qualification ==
Latvia’s campaign for the 2008 UEFA European Championship began in a group featuring Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Northern Ireland, and Liechtenstein. The team started with a narrow 0–1 loss to Sweden at home, followed by a commanding 4–0 victory over Iceland and a 0–1 defeat to Northern Ireland.
After a shock loss to Liechtenstein in March 2007, Andrejevs resigned as head coach. In April, Aleksandrs Starkovs returned to lead the team. Under his guidance, Latvia achieved victories over Liechtenstein, Iceland, and Northern Ireland, but suffered defeats to Spain, Denmark, and Sweden. Latvia concluded the qualification cycle in 5th place in their group.

== 2010 FIFA World Cup Qualification ==
During his second tenure, Starkovs aimed to rebuild the team by integrating younger players while relying on experienced veterans like Vitālijs Astafjevs and Māris Verpakovskis to provide leadership. While Latvia did not achieve the same level of success as during the early 2000s, Starkovs&#x27; influence helped maintain competitiveness and ensured that the team remained a respected opponent in international football.
In the fall of 2008, Latvia began their qualification campaign for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Drawn into a group with Greece, Israel, Switzerland, Moldova, and Luxembourg, Latvia opened with a 2–1 victory over Moldova in Chișinău. However, the team then suffered defeats to group favorites Greece (0–2 at home) and Switzerland (1–2 away), despite a header goal from Deniss Ivanovs.

Latvia bounced back with a 1–1 draw against Israel in Riga and two wins against Luxembourg (4–0 away and 2–0 at home). In a pivotal autumn match, Latvia defeated Israel 1–0 in Tel Aviv, keeping their hopes alive for a top-two finish.

On September 9, 2009, Latvia drew 2–2 against Switzerland at Skonto Stadium, maintaining their contention for second place as Greece surprisingly drew 1–1 against Moldova in Chișinău. At this stage, Latvia remained in a competitive position to vie for a spot in the FIFA World Cup. 

In the penultimate and decisive match of the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification, Latvia faced Greece at the Athens Olympic Stadium. Despite taking a 2–1 lead in the first half through Māris Verpakovskis, a controversial penalty awarded to Greece early in the second half turned the tide. Theofanis Gekas scored from the spot and added two more goals, while Georgios Samaras also found the net, resulting in a 2–5 loss for Latvia.

In the final match of the campaign, Latvia defeated Moldova 3–2 at home. Despite finishing third in the group, Latvia narrowly missed out on qualification.

His second term further solidified Starkovs’ legacy as one of the most influential figures in the history of Latvian football, showcasing his dedication and impact on the national team’s development.

Group Standings Situation
As of the decisive matches, the group standings were tightly contested, with Latvia demonstrating resilience and ambition under Starkovs’ leadership. The team&#x27;s ability to challenge strong opponents marked a continued effort to build on the success of the early 2000s.
== 2012 UEFA European Championship Qualification ==
From September 2010 to October 2011, Latvia competed in the UEFA Euro 2012 qualification tournament, drawn into Group F with Greece, Croatia, Israel, Georgia, and Malta.

Latvia began the campaign with a 0–3 home defeat to Croatia, followed by a 2–0 away win against Malta. In October, Latvia lost 0–1 to Greece in Athens but secured a last-minute 1–1 draw against Georgia in Riga thanks to a Aleksandrs Cauņa&#x27;s equalizer.

The 2011 campaign saw Latvia lose twice to Israel (1–2 both home and away) before securing a 1–0 victory against Georgia in Tbilisi and a 1–1 draw with Greece in Riga. Latvia ended the cycle with a 2–0 win over Malta but concluded with a 0–2 loss to Croatia. Latvia finished fourth in the group, missing out on qualification.

== 2014 FIFA World Cup Qualification ==
Latvia participated in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification from September 2012 to October 2013. The team was placed in Group G alongside Greece, Slovakia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Lithuania, and Liechtenstein.

Latvia started with losses to Greece (1–2), Bosnia and Herzegovina (1–4), and Slovakia (1–2) but managed a 2–0 victory against Liechtenstein. However, their form faltered in 2013, starting with a disappointing 1–1 draw against Liechtenstein and a heavy 0–5 loss to Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Following the Bosnia defeat, there were calls within the Latvian Football Federation (LFF) to dismiss head coach Aleksandrs Starkovs, but the board voted against it. Despite the decision, Starkovs later submitted his resignation.

== Transition to Pahars’ Leadership ==
After Starkovs&#x27; resignation, former national team player Marians Pahars was appointed as head coach with a contract extending until the end of the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification cycle. This marked a new chapter for the Latvian national team, as Pahars sought to rejuvenate the squad and improve its competitiveness on the international stage.

=== Latvian National Team Under Marians Pahars (2013–2017) ===

==== First Matches and Early Success ====
Marians Pahars’ tenure as head coach of the Latvian national football team began with a friendly match against Estonia, which ended in a 1–1 draw. His first victory came on September 6, 2013, during the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign, with a 2–1 win against Lithuania in Riga. However, the team suffered two away losses (0–1 against both Greece and Lithuania) before finishing the campaign with a 2–2 draw against Slovakia. Latvia concluded the qualification cycle in 5th place in their group, ahead of Liechtenstein but trailing Lithuania by three points.

Baltic Cup Victory

In the 2014 Baltic Cup, Latvia defeated Estonia in the semifinals following a penalty shootout and secured the title by beating Lithuania 1–0 in the final, with Nauris Bulvītis scoring the winning goal. This victory marked Latvia&#x27;s 22nd Baltic Cup win.

2016 UEFA European Championship Qualification

The UEFA Euro 2016 qualification campaign was Pahars’ first full qualification cycle as head coach. Latvia was drawn into Group A alongside the Czech Republic, Iceland, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, and Turkey.

Latvia started with a 0–0 draw away against Kazakhstan. They then lost 0–3 at home to Iceland, followed by a 1–1 draw with Turkey. A heavy 0–6 defeat to the Netherlands concluded the year. In 2015, Latvia drew 1–1 against the Czech Republic, conceding an equalizer in the 90th minute, and lost 0–2 in a rematch against the Netherlands.

A 1–1 draw in Turkey and a 2–2 draw in Iceland highlighted occasional resilience.
However, the campaign ended on a sour note with a 0–1 home defeat to Kazakhstan, leaving Latvia in last place (6th) in the group standings. Latvia rebounded in June 2016 by winning the Baltic Cup for the 23rd time. They defeated Lithuania 2–1 and drew 0–0 with Estonia to secure the title.

== 2018 FIFA World Cup Qualification and Resignation ==
Latvia began their 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign with a promising 1–0 away win against Andorra. However, the team struggled in subsequent matches:

Losses to the Faroe Islands (0–2), Hungary (0–2), Portugal (1–4), and Switzerland (0–1) followed. On March 28, 2017, Latvia suffered a crushing 0–5 defeat to Georgia in a friendly match. This prompted Marians Pahars to submit his resignation, ending his tenure as head coach.

Despite occasional successes, including two Baltic Cup victories, Pahars’ time as coach was marked by inconsistency in competitive matches, culminating in a disappointing World Cup qualification campaign.

== Starkovs&#x27; Third Stint and Foreign Coaches (2017–2020) ==
Starkovs&#x27; Third Term

On April 19, 2017, Aleksandrs Starkovs was appointed head coach of the Latvian national team for the third time, replacing Marians Pahars. Starkovs&#x27; return saw a series of disappointing results, with the sole victory being a 1–0 win against Andorra on October 10 in the final match of the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign.

During his tenure, Latvia reached its lowest-ever FIFA World Ranking, falling to 148th place in September 2017. After a shocking 0–1 loss to Gibraltar on March 25, 2018, Starkovs was dismissed.

Miksu Paatelainen (2018–2019)

On May 24, 2018, Finnish coach Miksu Paatelainen was appointed head coach. Under his leadership, Latvia won the 2018 Baltic Cup, a bright moment amidst otherwise underwhelming results.

Latvia’s campaign in the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League was considered disappointing by many. In their League D group alongside Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Andorra, Latvia failed to win a match, collecting only four points and finishing third in the group. Following these results, Paatelainen left his position as head coach.

Slaviša Stojanović (2019–2020)

On March 1, 2019, Slovenian coach Slaviša Stojanović was named head coach. His tenure was marked by a record nine consecutive defeats during the UEFA Euro 2020 qualification campaign. Latvia managed only one win, a surprise 1–0 victory over Austria in their final group match.

Latvia finished last in their group, which included Poland, Austria, North Macedonia, Slovenia, and Israel. In January 2020, the Latvian Football Federation terminated its contract with Stojanović, ending a tumultuous chapter in the team’s history.

This period highlighted Latvia’s struggles on the international stage, with fleeting moments of success overshadowed by poor performances and instability at the managerial level.

=== Dainis Kazakevičs’ Era: The Positive Vector and Challenges (2020–2023) ===
In early 2020, the Latvian football community increasingly voiced the need for a local specialist to lead the national team—someone familiar with the nuances of Latvian football. Amid political uncertainty within the Latvian Football Federation (LFF), which was briefly without a president, the regular rotation of head coaches seemed unlikely to yield a long-term solution. Thus, following Slaviša Stojanović’s dismissal, Dainis Kazakevičs was appointed as head coach for a three-year term.

Early Struggles and Nations League Campaigns

In the 2020–2021 UEFA Nations League, Latvia competed in Group D alongside the Faroe Islands, Malta, and Andorra. Despite high hopes, the team failed to secure a win in its first five matches, drawing four and losing to Malta. Latvia finally claimed a decisive 5–0 victory against Andorra in the last game but finished third in the group.

Despite this disappointing start, the LFF remained committed to Kazakevičs’ long-term vision. This decision bore fruit with an eight-match unbeaten streak (including friendlies) and Latvia&#x27;s triumph in the 2022–2023 UEFA Nations League. Latvia won their group against Andorra, Moldova, and Liechtenstein, securing promotion to League C.

Late Setbacks and Narrow Success

The campaign nearly unraveled in the penultimate match, where Latvia suffered a surprising 1–2 defeat to Moldova in front of a packed home crowd in Riga. This result left the decisive final game against Andorra fraught with tension.

In Andorra, Latvia took the lead in the 50th minute through Vladislavs Gutkovskis. However, a critical error by goalkeeper Pāvels Šteinbors allowed Andorra to equalize two minutes before full time. The draw left the team stunned, but Latvia retained first place in the group due to a superior goal difference over Moldova, earning promotion to League C. Unfortunately, the shaky end to the season dashed Latvia’s hopes of securing a playoff spot for UEFA Euro 2024.

Mounting Criticism and Kazakevičs’ Departure

Kazakevičs faced criticism from the outset, with skeptics questioning his suitability for the role. Although the five-match winning streak in 2022 brought some relief, doubts persisted. By 2023, public pressure reached a peak, with the slogan “DainisOut” gaining traction.

The national team’s performance in 2023 exacerbated discontent. Out of ten matches, Latvia lost nine, scoring just two goals in their last six games. Even a win over Armenia was overshadowed by fan protests, as supporters demonstratively left the stands during the first half, demanding Kazakevičs’ resignation.

The sustained public and media pressure eventually led to the termination of Kazakevičs’ contract, bringing an end to his tenure as head coach.

Legacy

Kazakevičs’ era was a mix of modest successes and persistent challenges. While Latvia’s Nations League promotion to League C marked a positive milestone, inconsistent performances and public dissatisfaction highlighted the difficulty of building a cohesive and competitive national team.

===Kits===

Latvia&#x27;s kit is traditionally a carmine red jersey with white trim, carmine red shorts and socks, whilst their current away kit is all predominantly white. Latvia&#x27;s kits have been produced by various manufacturers.

===Crest===
Until July 2018, the team crest consisted of the Latvian Football Federation logo, when it was switched to a shield with a football in the colors of the Latvian flag and &#x27;LATVIJA&#x27; written above. A similar crest with a head of a howling wolf was also unveiled as a secondary logo for use in souvenirs etc. as part of the #11vilki (&quot;#11wolves&quot;) brand.

==Media coverage==
All Latvian matches are currently broadcast with full commentary on the Go3 web streaming service, owned by TV3 Group. Since the 1990s, LTV7 (initially LTV2) was the broadcaster of all of the team games, before the &quot;All Media Baltics&quot; conglomerate took over broadcasting rights in September 2018. Games were broadcast on the group&#x27;s TV6 channel and the &quot;TVPlay&quot; and &quot;Viaplay&quot; streaming platforms. &quot;All Media Baltics&quot; later became TV3 Group.

From the 2022 season until the 2028 season, Latvia&#x27;s home and away qualifiers, and friendlies both home and away were broadcast live exclusively by Swedish Viaplay Group on their web streaming service. On 20 July 2023, Viaplay announced that it will leave the market of the Baltic states. Upon exiting, all sports licenses owned by Viasat - including the Baltic broadcasting rights for the Baltic Cup, UEFA Champions League, Premier League, Formula 1 and the NHL - were acquired by TV3 Group. This means that the matches of the Latvian national football team are returning LTV7, in September 2024.

==Stadium==
In recent years, the home venue of the team has fluctuated between Skonto Stadium and the Daugava Stadium in Riga. Daugava was the main venue of the team from 1992 to 2000, when Skonto Stadium was unveiled as a temporary location due to the planned renovation of the Daugava. However, the renovation of the complex only began in 2017, with the first stage completed a year later.

The team then returned to the Daugava after an 18-year absence in the summer of 2018 with a game against Estonia on June 2. However, since mid-2022 home matches were once again temporarily moved to Skonto Stadium due to problems with the grass pitch and other issues. Works on replacing and upgrading the pitch began in October 2023. At the time, Latvian Football Federation president Vadims Ļašenko said that Skonto would become the main home of the men&#x27;s team, with Daugava serving as a backup and the venue for the women&#x27;s and youth national teams.

In the interwar era between 1921 and 1940, games were held in various locations such as the Army Sports Club Stadium in Riga and others.

<doc id="711599" wikidata="Q4781264" url="?curid=711599" title="Apple box">
<text>Apple boxes are wooden boxes or crates of varying sizes with holes on each end used chiefly in film production. These boxes are specialized pieces of equipment belonging to the grip department, and should not be confused with simple crates, other boxes, or boxes for apples.

==Uses==
As one of the most ubiquitous and useful pieces of equipment on a film set, apple boxes are used for anything that needs to be propped up or supported temporarily. They can be used to prop up furniture and light stands, for leveling camera dolly track, or to provide temporary seats, workbenches, or stepladders.

Often the need arises to make an actor appear taller, either because of their height, or to fit with the composition of a particular shot. In this use apple boxes are jokingly referred to as &quot;man makers&quot;.

Apple boxes were originally used for storage. They would have a forward opening in the box and it could be used as a double storage device for small necessary things.

==Sizes==
Full apple (also referred to as just an &quot;apple box&quot;) 20&quot;×12&quot;×8&quot;
Half apple 19 3/4&quot;×12&quot;×4&quot;
Quarter apple 19 3/4&quot;×12&quot;×2&quot;
Pancake (eighth apple) 19 3/4&quot;×12&quot;×1&quot;

Nesting apple boxes fit the three smaller sizes into the full apple (which does not have the standard midway internal support crossbeam). To accommodate the smaller internal dimensions, the half, quarter and pancake are only 18 1/2&quot; long × 10&quot; wide.

Half length &quot;mini&quot; apple boxes are now manufactured.

Mini apple box 10&quot;×12&quot;×8&quot;
Mini half 10&quot;×12&quot;×4&quot;
Mini quarter 10&quot;×12&quot;×2&quot;
Mini pancake/eighth 10&quot;×12&quot;×1&quot;

Apple box sizes vary somewhat depending on manufacturer, but all sizes are designed to be fractions of the &quot;full apple&quot; size. Thus two half apples exactly equal the size of a full apple, two quarters equals one half, and two pancakes equal one quarter. This modular design is often critically important as many applications require mixes of sizes.

==Position==
Often when a grip is placing an apple box others are lifting something heavy to put on top of it, thus arose the need for terms describing what position the apple box should be placed in (i.e., which side of the apple box should be placed face-down). It is rare that these terms are used for anything other than the &quot;full apple&quot; size.

*New York or &quot;A&quot;: Positioned so the apple box is tallest, like the tall buildings in New York, 20&quot; high.
*Texas/Chicago or &quot;B&quot;: Positioned so the apple box is resting on its longest narrow side, 12&quot; high.&lt;ref name=&quot;gettyimages/143429048&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*LA or &quot;C&quot;: Positioned so the apple box is flattest, 8&quot; high.

Regional variations exist for the colloquial names of these positions. These include 1/2/3, New York/Chicago/LA, and Manhattan/Brooklyn/Queens.

==Basso blocks==
Basso blocks are a stacking variant of conventional apple boxes. Their design gives the same elevation ability of Apples, but takes 66% less storage space. A full set of Basso Blocks is equivalent to twelve 1/2 Apples. A set of 1/2 Basso Blocks is equivalent to twenty-four 1/4 Apples.

Elephant blocks are a three legged stable update to Basso Blocks that allow 1&quot; elevation increments.

<doc id="711606" wikidata="Q919907" url="?curid=711606" title="Don Larsen">
<text>Don James Larsen (August 7, 1929 – January 1, 2020) was an American professional baseball pitcher. During a 15-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career, he pitched from 1953 to 1967 for seven different teams: the St. Louis Browns / Baltimore Orioles (1953–54; 1965), New York Yankees (1955–1959), Kansas City Athletics (1960–1961), Chicago White Sox (1961), San Francisco Giants (1962–1964), Houston Colt .45&#x27;s / Astros (1964–65), and Chicago Cubs (1967).

Larsen pitched the sixth perfect game in MLB history, doing so in Game 5 of the 1956 World Series. It is the only solo no-hitter and perfect game in World Series history and is one of only three no-hitters in MLB postseason history (the others being Roy Halladay&#x27;s in 2010 and the combined Houston Astros no-hitter in 2022). He won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award and Babe Ruth Award in recognition of his 1956 postseason.

==Early life==
Larsen was born in Michigan City, Indiana. Larsen&#x27;s family moved to San Diego, California, in 1944, where his mother became a housekeeper and his father worked as a department store salesman. Larsen attended Point Loma High School where he was a member of the basketball and baseball teams. He was selected for the All-Metro Conference team as a basketball player, and was offered several college scholarships to play basketball.

In baseball, Larsen&#x27;s ability for the local American Legion team caught the attention of St. Louis Browns scout Art Schwartz. Schwartz signed Larsen to a contract to play for one of the Browns&#x27; minor league teams in 1947, with Larsen receiving an $850 signing bonus (about $11,652 as of September 2023). Larsen, on why he signed with the Browns over attending college, later said that he was &quot;never much with the studies.&quot;

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues and military career===
Larsen started his career with the Aberdeen Pheasants of the Class-C Northern League in 1947, appearing in 16 games. He had a 4–3 win–loss record and a 3.42 earned run average (ERA). The next season with Aberdeen, he won 17 games and had a 3.75 ERA in 34 games. Larsen started the 1949 season pitching for the Globe-Miami Browns of the Class-C Arizona–Texas League, before he moved up the minor league hierarchy, playing for the Springfield Browns in the Class-B Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League, and the Wichita Falls Spudders of the Class-B Big State League for the first half of the 1950 season. Larsen was promoted to the Wichita Indians of the Class-A Western League in the second half of the 1950 season. With the Indians, Larsen had a 6–4 record with a 3.14 ERA in 21 games. In 1951, Larsen was drafted to the United States Army for the Korean War. He spent the next two years in the Army, working in a variety of non-combat jobs. He was discharged from the Army in 1953 and made the St. Louis Browns roster prior to the beginning of the season.

===St. Louis Browns / Baltimore Orioles (1953–1954)===
Larsen made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut with a start against the Detroit Tigers on April 17, 1953. He pitched five innings, giving up three earned runs, while striking out three in a no decision in an 8–7 Browns win. He had his first career win a little less than a month later, on May 12, against the Philadelphia Athletics, pitching innings and giving up one earned run in a 7–3 win. For his rookie season, Larsen finished with a 7–12 record, 4.16 ERA and 96 strikeouts in 38 games, 22 of them starts. He finished first on the team in innings pitched () and complete games (7) and second on the team in strikeouts. Larsen also allowed the most hits with 202, and earned runs (89) on the squad. He also broke a major league record for pitchers by having seven consecutive hits at one point. He batted .284 with 3 home runs in 81 at bats in his rookie year.

The Browns relocated to Baltimore for the 1954 season, becoming the Baltimore Orioles. In 1954, Larsen went 3–21 with a 4.37 earned run average and 80 strikeouts in 29 games. It was the fewest wins by a pitcher with at least 20 losses since 1916; and no 20-loss pitcher has had as few wins since then, a span of 108 years. He led the major leagues in losses and finished third in the league in earned runs allowed (98). The Orioles won only 54 games that season, while having 100 losses, and finished the season in seventh place. Two of Larsen&#x27;s three wins were against the New York Yankees, including a 10–0 shutout on July 30, his last win of the season. His other victory was against the Chicago White Sox on May 30.

===New York Yankees (1955–1959)===
In 1954, the New York Yankees, despite winning 103 games, finished second behind the Cleveland Indians in the American League. Yankees general manager George Weiss blamed the age of their pitching staff for their performance. The Yankees’ “Big Three” pitching staff of the late 1940s and early 1950s, Vic Raschi, Ed Lopat and Allie Reynolds, were in their late thirties, and wearing down. Raschi was traded to the Cardinals prior to the season, Reynolds retired because of a back injury and Lopat was ineffective and retired within a year. Two other pitchers in the staff, Johnny Sain and Tommy Byrne were also near the end of their careers. Desperate for young starting pitching behind staff ace Whitey Ford and promising starter Bob Grim, Weiss managed to find a trade partner with the Orioles. At the end of the season, Larsen was traded by the Baltimore Orioles as part of a 17-player trade, with Billy Hunter, Bob Turley and players to be named later to the Yankees for, most prominently, catcher Gus Triandos, and outfielder Gene Woodling. When the trade was announced Turley was considered the key player in the trade. During the 1954 season, Turley had a 14–15 record, and some observers considered Turley to have the &quot;liveliest fastball&quot; in the league. However, Weiss and Yankees manager Casey Stengel thought that Larsen had the most potential out of the two, having been impressed with Larsen&#x27;s performance against the Yankees and demanded that he be included in the trade.

As a member of the New York Yankees from 1955 through 1959, Larsen was used by manager Casey Stengel as a backup starter and occasional reliever. He went 45–24 during his five seasons in New York, making 90 starts in 128 appearances.

===1955 season===
Larsen reported to spring training with a sore shoulder and pitched ineffectively to start the year. He was quickly demoted to the Denver Bears, and Larsen, visibly upset, decided to &quot;take my sweet time&quot; reporting to the Bears. After staying in St. Louis for a week, Larsen had a change of heart and reported to the team. Larsen spent most of the first four months of the season with the Bears, only pitching in five games for the Yankees during that timespan. During the 1955 season, Larsen participated in nineteen games, starting 13 of them. He had a 9–2 record with a 3.07 ERA and 44 strikeouts in 97 innings pitched. Larsen pitched a shutout against Jim Bunning and the Detroit Tigers on August 5, 1955.

===1956 season===
In 1956 Larsen achieved an 11–5 record, with a career best 107 strikeouts and a 3.26 ERA. Larsen was used in between the bullpen and the starting rotation for most of the season, participating in 38 games, starting 20. Larsen had a rough start to the season, and by the end of May he had a 5.64 ERA. He gradually improved and by the beginning of August, Larsen lowered his ERA below 4.00. In a seven start stretch to finish the season, Larsen had five complete games, and pitched 10 innings in another. He pitched a four-hit shutout against his former team (Orioles) in the second game of a doubleheader on September 3. He finished the season with a 7–3 victory against the Boston Red Sox on September 28.

====1956 World Series====
Larsen&#x27;s most notable accomplishment was pitching the only perfect game in World Series history; it is one of only 24 perfect games in MLB history. He was pitching for the New York Yankees in Game 5 of the 1956 World Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers on October 8, 1956. His perfect game remained the only no-hitter of any type pitched in postseason play until Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Roy Halladay threw a no-hitter against the Cincinnati Reds on October 6, 2010, in Game 1 of the National League Division Series and the only World Series no-hitter until the combined no-hitter in Game 4 of the 2022 World Series thrown by the Houston Astros against the Philadelphia Phillies.

Stengel selected Larsen to start Game 2 of the Series. Despite being given a 6–0 lead by the Yankee batters, he lasted only innings in a 13–8 loss. He gave up only one hit, a single by Gil Hodges. He walked four batters and allowed four runs in the process but, because of an error by first baseman Joe Collins, none of the runs were earned.

Larsen started Game 5 for the Yankees. His opponent in the game was Brooklyn&#x27;s Sal Maglie. Larsen needed just 97 pitches to complete the perfect game, and only one Dodger batter (Pee Wee Reese in the first inning) was able to get a three-ball count. In 1998, Larsen recalled, &quot;I had great control. I never had that kind of control in my life.&quot; Brooklyn&#x27;s Maglie gave up only two runs on five hits. Mickey Mantle&#x27;s fourth-inning home run broke the scoreless tie. The Yankees added an insurance run in the sixth. After Roy Campanella grounded out to Billy Martin for the second out of the 9th inning, Larsen faced pinch hitter Dale Mitchell, a .312 career hitter. Throwing fastballs, Larsen got ahead in the count at 1–2. On his 97th pitch, a called third strike by home plate umpire Babe Pinelli, Larsen caught Mitchell looking for the 27th and last out. After the pitch, catcher Yogi Berra leaped into Larsen&#x27;s arms in celebration, setting up the &quot;everlasting image&quot;. Larsen&#x27;s unparalleled game earned him the World Series Most Valuable Player Award and Babe Ruth Award.

When the World Series ended, Larsen did a round of endorsements and promotional work around the United States, but he stopped soon after because it was &quot;disrupting his routine&quot;.

===1957–1960===
In 1957, Larsen had a 10–4 record with 3.74 ERA in 27 games, 20 of them starts. Larsen again had a bad start to the season, giving out four earned runs in innings pitched in his opening start against the Boston Red Sox. He gave up three consecutive hits to Gene Stephens, Gene Mauch and Sammy White to start the second inning, and after a sacrifice fly by pitcher Bob Porterfield, he gave up a double to Frank Malzone, and was taken out of the game. On May 26, Larsen gave up four earned runs in less than one inning in a start against the Washington Senators. He started another game two days later against the Red Sox and by the end of the month his ERA was over 6. He improved by the end of the season, hurling a 3-hit shutout against the Kansas City Athletics on September 15. In the 1957 World Series against the Milwaukee Braves, he pitched seven innings in relief in Game 3, getting the win in a 12–3 lopsided defeat. He started the seventh game of the Series, lasting innings in a 5–0 loss as the Braves won the Series.

Larsen won the third game in the 1958 World Series. Like the 1957 World Series, it went to a seventh game, and Larsen was New York&#x27;s starting pitcher. He lasted just  innings, taking a no-decision. Both the Yankees&#x27; and Don Larsen&#x27;s fortunes would dip in 1959. New York slipped to third place and Don Larsen dropped below .500 for the first time in his Yankee career, going 6–7.

===Kansas City Athletics (1960–1961)===
Larsen was traded to the Kansas City Athletics with Hank Bauer, Norm Siebern and Marv Throneberry for Roger Maris, Joe DeMaestri, and Kent Hadley. In July 1960, the Athletics sent Larsen back to the minors.

===Chicago White Sox (1961)===
In 1961, Larsen went 8–2 while playing for both the Athletics and the Chicago White Sox, to whom he was traded in June 1961 with Andy Carey, Ray Herbert and Al Pilarcik for Wes Covington, Stan Johnson, Bob Shaw and Gerry Staley.

===San Francisco Giants (1962–1964)===
After the 1961 season, Larsen was traded to the San Francisco Giants with Billy Pierce for Bob Farley, Eddie Fisher and Dom Zanni and a player to be named later (Verle Tiefenthaler). Larsen became a full-time relief pitcher, anchoring a strong bullpen that included Bobby Bolin and Stu Miller. He had five wins with 11 saves for the pennant-winning Giants. Larsen won the deciding game of the three-game playoff series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, relieving Juan Marichal in the eighth inning. In the 1962 World Series, Larsen won Game 4 pitching in relief, giving him a career World Series record of 4–2 with a 2.75 ERA. During his time with the Giants, Larsen earned the nickname of &quot;Froggy&quot; due to his hobby of hunting frogs and serving marinated frog legs to his Giants teammates.

===Houston Colt .45&#x27;s / Astros (1964–1965)===
In 1964, the Giants sold Larsen to the Houston Colt .45s, who pressed Larsen back into a starting role. He responded with a 4–8 record and a 2.27 ERA.

===Baltimore Orioles (1965)===
In 1965, Larsen was traded to the Orioles for Bob Saverine and cash. The Orioles released him prior to the 1966 season, and he pitched the year for the Phoenix Giants of the Class-AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL) in the San Francisco minor league organization.

===Chicago Cubs (1967)===
Larsen was on the Chicago Cubs roster for two weeks of the 1967 season, pitching only four innings in what would be his final stint in the major leagues. He spent the rest of the season with the Dallas-Fort Worth Spurs of the Class-AA Texas League. Larsen started the 1968 season in the Cubs&#x27; minor league system, pitching for the San Antonio Missions of the Texas League and Tacoma Cubs of the PCL, before retiring in the summer.

Larsen hit well for a pitcher, finishing his career with a .242 average, 14 home runs and 72 runs batted in. One of his four-baggers matched his famous achievement on the mound, and in the same season, as he stroked a grand slam against the Boston Red Sox on April 22, 1956, in a game in which he pitched 4 innings. He was regarded well enough by his managers that he was used as a pinch hitter 66 times.

==Pitching style==
In his prime, Larsen was an athletically built (6&#x27;4&quot;, 215 lb), right-handed overhand power pitcher, who admitted to having poorer control than most pitchers in his era, but he trusted the framing by Yogi Berra to set him to aim low and outside batters, and mostly across the body. He was also known to have no windup or leg kick, a technique usually used by modern pitchers when there are runners on base. Because his action was so compact and he did not throw many changeups or breaking balls, runners could not easily steal on him.

== Life after playing ==
After retiring from baseball, Larsen attempted to work in the front office of a major league organization, (it is not known which one), and as a liquor salesman; neither career worked out. He became an executive for a paper company, working with farmers who worked in California&#x27;s Salinas Valley.

In 1964, Larsen was inducted by the San Diego Hall of Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame honoring San Diego&#x27;s finest athletes both on and off the playing surface.

Larsen, with writer Mark Shaw, released an autobiography, &quot;The Perfect Yankee: The Incredible Story of the Greatest Miracle in Baseball History&quot; that was published in 1996.

Larsen was also at David Cone&#x27;s perfect game in 1999. Cone&#x27;s game took place on Yogi Berra Day; Larsen threw out the ceremonial first pitch to Berra before the game. Larsen said it was the first game he had seen in person from start to finish since his retirement.

==Personal life and death==

Larsen married his first wife, Vivian, in 1955, out of a sense of duty after she became pregnant with his child. The day of his perfect game, they were estranged, and she was in court, obtaining a show-cause order demanding that MLB Commissioner Ford Frick withhold her husband&#x27;s World Series share and apply it to $420 owed her in support payments. They were divorced in 1957. Larsen and his second wife, Corrine, were married for over 60 years. They lived in Hayden Lake, Idaho. It was reported in 2012 that he put up for auction the uniform he had worn to pitch his perfect game to pay for expenses of his grandchildren&#x27;s college education.

Larsen died on January 1, 2020, from esophageal cancer at the age of 90.

==Personality==
Larsen was known for his personality and his enjoyment of the nightlife, especially in New York City. During his time in minor league baseball, Larsen first developed a reputation as a &quot;fun-loving guy&quot; who liked to go out to bars and have a drink, according to teammate Bob Turley. When he broke into the Majors with the St. Louis Browns, Larsen started violating a time-limit curfew that was set by managers Marty Marion and then Jimmy Dykes. He was nicknamed &quot;Gooneybird&quot; for his antics.

<text>A full toss is a type of delivery in the sport of cricket. It describes any delivery that reaches the batsman without bouncing on the pitch first.

A full toss which reaches the batsman above the waist is called a beamer. This is not a valid delivery and will lead to a no-ball penalty, but, like the bouncer, is sometimes used as an intimidation tactic. 

Other types of full toss are rarely deliberate, as they can be very easy to hit. A low full toss is frequently the result of an error made while attempting to bowl a yorker, which bounces at the batsman&#x27;s feet. Occasionally a full toss can surprise a batsman so effectively that he is unable to play it properly, and this can lead to a wicket, but few bowlers rely on this. 

There have been occasions in which a bowler intentionally bowls a full toss to achieve maximum swing into the base of the stumps.

<text>Full Collapse is the second studio album by American post-hardcore band Thursday. It was released on April 10, 2001, through Victory Records, to whom the band signed after leaving Eyeball Records. With the addition of guitarist Steve Pedulla, recording sessions for the album were held in November 2000 at Big Blue Meenie Recording Studios in Jersey City. Sal Villanueva, who served as the producer, the production team and members of different bands contributed additional instrumentation to the recordings. &quot;Full Collapse&quot; is considered a post-hardcore album.

Preceded by a two-month United States tour, the album&#x27;s release was promoted with a short series of shows. The band toured the US in 2001, with BoySetsFire, Waterdown, Rival Schools, and Saves the Day. At the end of the year, the band released music videos for &quot;Understanding in a Car Crash&quot; and &quot;Cross Out the Eyes&quot;. In early 2002, keyboardist Andrew Everding joined the band. They went on tour with the Movielife and Sparta and appeared on the Warped Tour soon afterwards. Around this time, the band made it known that they had several issues with Victory Records and its founder, Tony Brummel. Thursday has performed the album in its entirety on tours in 2011 and 2018.

&quot;Full Collapse&quot; peaked at number 178 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It also appeared on two &quot;Billboard&quot; component charts: number ten on Heatseekers Albums, and number nine on the Independent Albums. The album received favorable reviews from music critics, many of whom praised the album&#x27;s musicianship. It is referred to as a classic emo album and praised as one of the best emo albums of all time, by publications such as &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, &quot;NME&quot;, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. It has influenced bands such as As Cities Burn, My Chemical Romance, and Senses Fail.

==Background and production==
Thursday released their debut album, &quot;Waiting&quot;, in November 1999 through Eyeball Records. With the band touring more often, all of the members dropped out of Rutgers University. As they lacked a permanent second guitarist, the band had multiple people filling in on guitar. Guitarist Steve Pedulla, whose brother was friends with members of Thursday, joined the band in 2000 after filling in for a show. Eyeball was aware that Thursday was outgrowing what support they could provide, and asked other labels to sign the band. &quot;Waiting&quot; received enough attention to be noticed by Victory Records, who flew out representatives to watch them play a show in their hometown. By the time the band signed with Victory, they were able to tour full-time. Drummer Tucker Rule said the reason they went with Victory was that the label had previously signed Earth Crisis and Refused. Bassist Tim Payne said Thursday was one of a few acts that strayed from the label&#x27;s typical hardcore punk style.

After signing, they were told by their friends that they would find themselves in &quot;a situation that we would regret&quot;. The members of Thursday were unsure what their friends were referring to – they assumed that the signing would work out fine. They wrote the new songs in a collaborative manner. In comparison, most of the songs on &quot;Waiting&quot; were written by a single person. The majority of the songs that ended up on &quot;Full Collapse&quot; were written in the basement of frontman Geoff Rickly&#x27;s parents&#x27; house. They began recording the new album after a US tour. Sessions were held at Big Blue Meenie Recording Studios in Jersey City, New Jersey, with producer Sal Villanueva of metal band Demonspeed. The sessions in November 2000 lasted for 20 days. Tim Giles and Erin Farley acted as engineers, with assistance from Codie Brown. Giles mixed the recordings, before the album was mastered by Timo G. Less at Surgical Sound.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Full Collapse&quot; has been mainly described as a post-hardcore release, while also being labelled as post-punk, emo pop, hardcore punk, and punk rock. Throughout the album, Rickly&#x27;s singing switches between crooning to screaming. &quot;Full Collapse&quot; lacks some of the typical traits of emo in favor of Johnny Marr-like picking in a minor key, against power chords. Members of other bands and members of the production team contributed various instrumentation to the tracks: Farley with additional guitar on &quot;Understanding in a Car Crash&quot;; Joe Darone of the Rosenbergs with additional vocals on &quot;Autobiography of a Nation&quot;; Tom Schlatter of the Assistant with additional vocals on &quot;Autobiography of a Nation&quot; and &quot;Cross Out the Eyes&quot;; Villanueva with additional guitar on &quot;Autobiography of a Nation&quot; and &quot;Wind-Up&quot;; Giles with strings and melotone on &quot;Paris in Flames&quot;; and Frank Giokas of Unsound with additional guitar on &quot;Standing on the Edge of Summer&quot;.

The opening track, &quot;A0001&quot;, sees Rickly pondering whether a robot is capable of dreaming, as guitar feedback gives way to two snare hits. He said people were &quot;spending so much of our time in front of computers that it&#x27;s feeling like we&#x27;re becoming robots&quot;. &quot;Understanding in a Car Crash&quot; details the death by car crash of Rickly&#x27;s girlfriend and best friend and his subsequent visit to the hospital. Rickly said the song was inspired by what they were listening to at the time, Joy Division, and put that &quot;within the realm of hardcore&quot;. &quot;Concealer&quot; is a short up-tempo song that is followed by the Cure-esque &quot;Autobiography of a Nation&quot;, which talks about genocide. &quot;A Hole in the World&quot; features a guitar riff in the vein of Jawbreaker and ends with a piano part. &quot;Cross Out the Eyes&quot; is the heaviest song on the album, featuring screaming from Schlatter. Rickly said he wrote it about wanting to &quot;obliterat[e] the whole authorial me-me-me-this-is-about-me [stance]&quot;; it was one of the first song he wrote on guitar.

&quot;Paris in Flames&quot; discusses transgender and LGBT activism, as well as mentioning prejudices that a gay friend of Rickly&#x27;s had faced. &quot;Standing on the Edge of Summer&quot; talks about impending death and reuses a guitar effect heard in &quot;Understanding in a Car Crash&quot;. &quot;Wind-Up&quot; begins with a slow verse section that gives way to a screaming chorus, complete with dueling vocals. &quot;How Long Is the Night?&quot; is about Rickly&#x27;s partner in French class, who would lay on the train tracks behind their school, wishing that the a train would run them over. The album ends with &quot;i1100&quot;, which consists of distorted sound effects.

==Release==
===Initial touring and promotion===
Thursday announced &quot;Full Collapse&quot; on February 5, 2001, for release two months later. The band created hype for the album by touring the United States for two months with bands Midtown, Grey AM, and Every Time I Die. On March 19, 2001, &quot;Cross Out the Eyes&quot; was posted as a free download through Victory Records&#x27; website. &quot;Full Collapse&quot; was released on April 10, 2001 through Victory. The design of the physical was debated: the band hoped to create a booklet of artwork for &quot;Full Collapse&quot; but were discouraged by Victory founder Tony Brummel who insisted on a less expensive one-page insert without printed lyrics. A compromise was reached, which resulted in the final chosen packaging. The album&#x27;s release was promoted with a series of shows with Midtown and River City High.

&quot;Understanding in a Car Crash&quot; was released as a single to college radio stations in April 2001. In June 2001, Thursday embarked on an East Coast US tour with Skycamefalling and Fairweather. In July, the band toured with BoySetsFire, Samiam, and the Movielife. Following this, they toured across the US with Waterdown and Drowningman until August. After three shows with Warped Tour, the band toured with Rival Schools. In October, the band toured the West Coast for a week with Murder City Devils and American Steel, before touring the East Coast with Piebald, the Lawrence Arms, and Recover in November. Thursday toured with Hey Mercedes and Saves the Day until the end of the year.

In December 2001, the music video for &quot;Understanding in a Car Crash&quot;, which consists of live footage, began airing on MTVX, MTV2, and MuchMusic. Following this, a music video directed by Darren Doane for &quot;Cross Out the Eyes&quot; was released. Doane interpreted the song to be about rebirth and marriage; the video is centered around a guy, who is jobless, single, and offers nothing to society. He is taken by people and has his skin removed, indicating that he is a new person, and sold to a rich woman. As a result of this, he is given marriage status, making him a valuable member of society.

By January 2002, Thursday was gaining feature stories in publications such as &quot;Metal Edge&quot; and &quot;Metal Maniacs&quot;. The following month, keyboardist Andrew Everding joined the band. He had been relaxing at Rickly&#x27;s apartment and was invited to a practice session with the band. The same month, the band toured across the United Kingdom with the Movielife. The music video for &quot;Understanding in a Car Crash&quot; was successful at MTV2, where it stayed in rotation for eight weeks. In March and April 2002, the band went on tour with Sparta. They were denied clearance at the Canada–US border, and as a result, had to cancel a show. Shortly afterwards, the band appeared at the Skate and Surf festival. They had planned to support Face to Face on their headlining US tour, but were replaced by the Movielife.

===Issues with Victory and subsequent touring===
In May 2002, as Thursday&#x27;s signing to Island Def Jam had become imminent, the band released a statement through their website detailing their internal problems with Victory and reasons for leaving. The band said they had higher aspirations for the album art for &quot;Full Collapse&quot;, which were undone by Brummel&#x27;s desire to keep costs down. During a visit to Victory&#x27;s offices, they also discovered that for promotional purposes, the label made Thursday-branded whoopee cushions, which were intended to be distributed to fans at the Warped Tour. They were produced without Thursday&#x27;s consent and so were discontinued. The band continually emphasized the need to communicate regarding art direction and promotion, but were allegedly ignored by Brummel and told that Victory was too big to run everything past its artists. Rickly recalled that upon signing, the label told them that they wanted Thursday to be their own pop iteration of Saves the Day.

In a meeting with Brummel, he claimed that Thursday was not living up to his expectations, with the band&#x27;s statement explaining: &quot;Instead of Tony&#x27;s relationship with us being based on a love for music, it was based entirely on numbers.&quot; However, by late 2001, Brummel began showing more concern for the band and called more frequently regarding sales. They soon learned that Brummel planned to sell part of Victory to MCA and, as Thursday&#x27;s contract only allowed them to leave Victory for a major label, began reciprocating new-found interest from prominent labels. By early 2002, the decision to join Island was made as MCA began promoting &quot;Full Collapse&quot; as their own, and Thursday found itself in a legal battle with the label. Rickly would later note: &quot;When we parted ways with Victory, we got our asses kicked. [...] Victory&#x27;s lawyers were so strong.&quot;

&quot;Cross Out the Eyes&quot; was released to modern rock radio stations on June 10, 2002. Between late June and mid-August, the band went on the 2002 Warped Tour. Following this, the band appeared at the Bizarre, Pukkelpop, Reading and Leeds Festivals. Though the band were not planning on doing another tour, they appeared at three shows on the Plea for Peace tour. Keeley said the band had heard about the tour from the previous year, and felt it was an appropriate way to end the touring cycle for &quot;Full Collapse&quot;. Live versions of &quot;Understanding in a Car Crash&quot;, &quot;Autobiography of a Nation&quot;, &quot;Paris in Flames&quot;, and &quot;Standing on the Edge of Summer&quot; would appear on the band&#x27;s second EP &quot;Five Stories Falling&quot; (2002). Thursday would later use Victory&#x27;s lawyers to leave Island in 2007 and reunite with Brummel to work on the live/video album &quot;Kill the House Lights&quot; (2007). It chronicles the band&#x27;s career with a documentary and concert footage emphasizing the &quot;Full Collapse&quot; era. It also features demos and alternate versions of songs from that album.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Full Collapse&quot; was met with generally favourable reviews from music critics. Chris Collum of &quot;AbsolutePunk&quot; wrote that &quot;Thursday are something special, something that is almost unique, and this album–of their five–does the best job of getting that across.&quot; He said that the album&#x27;s &quot;biggest draw musically&quot; was the way it moves between the &quot;harsh and abrasive to the ambient and soothing in a matter of mere seconds&quot;. Punknews.org founder Aubin Paul said the album &quot;delivers on the promise&quot; of their debut &quot;and then some&quot;. He added that there was &quot;some serious intensity here, great powerful riffs, and a singer who can actually sing, and scream.&quot; Sputnikmusic staff member DaveyBoy said that while it wasn&#x27;t the &quot;most immediate album of all time&quot;, listeners would be &quot;rewarded as Thursday get the best out of themselves here and hardly put a foot wrong&quot;. He praised the musicianship as being &quot;top notch throughout, while the vocals are pleasingly satisfactory&quot;.

&quot;Ox-Fanzine&quot; reviewer Joachim Hiller found that Thursday had &quot;two faces, which on the one hand comes across as super pop, [and] on the other hand relies on the &#x27;Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde&#x27; principle when it comes to singing: sometimes gentle, sometimes screamy, then brutal&quot;. Stuart Green of &quot;Exclaim!&quot; wrote that the album &quot;sounds sort of like a jam session showdown between Quicksand and Sense Field&quot;. He adds that the band &quot;take us on a wild 14-track ride that starts with the careening &quot;Understanding In a Car Crash&quot; and doesn&#x27;t stop until some 40 minutes later.&quot; The staff at &quot;Manila Standard&quot; said hardcore fanatics would be &quot;dissatisfied with the mingling of genres but Thursday handles the juggling act well&quot;. &quot;Wondering Sound&quot; contributor Jonah Bayer said Rickly&#x27;s &quot;strikingly literary musings were packed with so much imagery and iconography that teens all over the country instantly latched onto these post-hardcore anthems&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Gavin Edwards found the band to be &quot;peel[ing] the scab off endless varieties of pain&quot; with their lyrics, tackling &quot;heartbreak[, ...] watching a friend die[, ... and] even guilt over genocide&quot;. He noted that when the band&#x27;s guitarwork becomes &quot;slow and subdued, it&#x27;s because the band is preparing to unleash a withering assault&quot;. AllMusic reviewer Kurt Morris wrote that while Thursday was &quot;generating intelligent music&quot;, they do their &quot;best to skirt the line of emo-pop without being unexciting or blasé&quot;. He said Rickly&#x27;s vocals were &quot;smooth yet not immature, strong while not being overbearing&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; contributor Eric Carr said that &quot;after spending some quality time&quot; with the album, he referred to it &quot;as simply &#x27;shit&#x27;. [...] Thursday does a few things right, but all in all, this could have been a much better album.&quot; Todd Burns of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; wrote that sections of tracks &quot;exhibit obvious skill and technical proficiency, but are quickly ruined by Rickly&#x27;s vocals or other elements that intrude on the small moments of interest&quot;. He says it was overall &quot;a solid second effort for a band in this genre, but money would be best spent&quot; on other albums.

==Commercial performance and legacy==
&quot;Full Collapse&quot; reached number 178 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It charted at number ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers Albums chart and number nine on the Independent Albums chart. In the first week of release, &quot;Full Collapse&quot; sold 800 copies, from the 3,400 that were originally shipped to stores. As of October 2008, it sold 380,000 copies.

In February 2009, Thursday announced that they would perform &quot;Full Collapse&quot; in its entirety for a one-off show on the Taste of Chaos tour. However, on the day of the show, the band cancelled. They eventually performed the album in October 2009, while in the midst of promoting their fifth studio album, &quot;Common Existence&quot;. To celebrate the tenth anniversary of &quot;Full Collapse&quot;, Thursday performed the album in its entirety throughout a US tour in 2011. In 2018, the band performed a run of two-night shows where they played &quot;Full Collapse&quot; on the first night and their third studio album, &quot;War All the Time&quot; (2003), on the other, in entirety. In a 2010 interview, Rickly described the album&#x27;s significance to both the band and its fans:
:&quot;Full Collapse&quot; was a record that changed the course and shape of my life. We began touring for it in basements and VFW halls, [...] and ended up as a full-time touring band meeting hundreds of thousands of people with whom we formed deep and lasting connections. Time passes and we embrace new music and different goals but, ten years later, &quot;Full Collapse&quot; continues to move people and for that we are very grateful. This tour is a celebration of those times and the end of a chapter in the life of Thursday.

According to &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot;, &quot;Full Collapse&quot; was &quot;instantly hailed [as] an emo classic&quot; upon release. It has influenced acts such as As Cities Burn, My Chemical Romance, Senses Fail, and This Day Forward (specifically their 2003 release &quot;In Response&quot;). Rickly would describe &quot;Full Collapse&quot; as a &quot;turning point record&quot; and strongly favor it over most of the band&#x27;s other work for both its passion and cohesive feel throughout. It has appeared on various best-of emo album lists, having been named in lists by &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot;, &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot;, &quot;Houston Press&quot;, &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, &quot;NME&quot;, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, as well as by journalists Leslie Simon and Trevor Kelley in their book &quot;Everybody Hurts: An Essential Guide to Emo Culture&quot; (2007). Similarly, &quot;Understanding in a Car Crash&quot; appeared on a best-of emo songs lists by &quot;Stereogum&quot; and &quot;Vulture&quot;. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; ranked &quot;Understanding in a Car Crash&quot; at number 10 on their list of the best 100 singles from the 2000s. The track has been covered by Wolves at the Gate for their &quot;Back to School&quot; (2013) EP.

<text>Lord High Commissioner is the style of high commissioners, i.e. direct representatives of the monarch, in three cases in the Kingdom of Scotland and the United Kingdom, two of which are no longer extant. Consequently, the remaining office is often known in short simply as the Lord High Commissioner.

==Ecclesiastic: Church of Scotland==
The lord high commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland is the British sovereign&#x27;s personal representative to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland (the Kirk), reflecting the latter&#x27;s role as the national church of Scotland, and the Sovereign&#x27;s role as a member of that Church.

==Historical political offices==
===Scottish Parliament===
See Lord High Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland.

===Ionian Islands Protectorate===
There were ten incumbent Lord High Commissioners of the Ionian Islands from 1815–1863, representing the British protecting power to the United States of the Ionian Islands, a federal state of seven formerly Venetian (see Ionian Islands under Venetian rule) Ionian islands (Corfu, Cephalonia, Zante, Santa Maura, Ithaca, Cerigo and Paxos). The United States of the Ionian Islands was officially a joint protectorate of the Allied Christian Powers, de facto a UK amical protectorate, and was established under the 1815 Treaty of Paris.
The office ceased when the islands were integrated in independent Greece in 1864.

The incumbents were:
*1815–1823: Sir Thomas Maitland 
*1823–1832: Sir Frederick Adam
*1832–1835: The Lord Nugent
*1835–1840: Sir Howard Douglas
*1840–1843: James Alexander Stewart Mackenzie
*1843–1849: The Lord Seaton
*1849–1855: Sir Henry George Ward
*1855–1859: Sir John Young
*1859–1863: Sir Henry Knight Storks

In addition, between November 1858 and March 1859, William Ewart Gladstone served as high commissioner extraordinary to determine the political future of the Ionian Islands. He recommended that the Ionian Islands remain under British protection. However, when the Bavarian-born King of Greece, Otto I, was deposed and replaced by the Anglophile king George I, the Ionian Islands were ceded to Greece, ending the position of lord high commissioner.

<doc id="711621" wikidata="Q5295495" url="?curid=711621" title="Doncaster East, Victoria">
<text>Doncaster East is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 20 km east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Manningham local government area. Doncaster East recorded a population of 30,926 at the 2021 census.

It is located in the hills between the Koonung Creek and the Mullum Mullum Creek. 

The suburb, which is situated on 11.4km2 of land, Doncaster East occupies a larger area than Doncaster, that they split from. Doncaster East is shaped like a reverse L, with the north-south part connecting with the Yarra River.

==History==
The area was originally occupied by the Wurundjeri, Indigenous Australians of the Kulin nation, who spoke variations of the Woiwurrung language group. After European settlement, the area was used for agriculture, predominantly orchards. A small settlement known as Waldau Village was established in the 1860s by predominantly German migrants. Those settlers planted the large swathes of pine trees to serve as windbreaks to protect the farmlands and orchards, those pine trees still exist today. &quot;German Lane&quot; was the original name for George Street, and &quot;Bismarck Street&quot; the original name for Victoria Street. The names were replaced during the First World War and the present names adopted with the wartime anti-German sentiments being an influential factor in removing German-influenced names from the local areas in favour of more overtly British names. 

The Post Office opened on 8 August 1887. A Tunstall Square office was open from 1965 until 1990.

Like much of the City of Manningham, Doncaster East was predominantly covered in fruit orchards for some time before subdivision began and it became a contiguous part of Melbourne. Housing estates began to replace orchards in the 1960s, generally along Doncaster Road, in the southern half of the suburb. The north half of the suburb was developed through the 1970s and 1980s, with the last orchard being removed in the 1990s. As the young parents who moved into these estates now retire and move away, many houses from the 60s and 70s were converted into multi-tenant units.

==Geography==

The area of land that is occupied by Doncaster East mostly consists of rolling hills, creek valleys and short ridges. Andersons Creek Road runs along an unnamed ridge that, when atop, gives views of Mount Dandenong to the east and the further rolling hills of Templestowe to the west.

Three main watercourses flow through or border the suburb:
*Mullum Mullum Creek
*Koonung Creek
* Ruffey Creek

The native vegetation of Doncaster East has been almost totally cleared, notable exceptions being the north-east of the suburb around the Mullum Mullum Creek, where small areas of native riparian bushland remain. Many small areas of Pine Trees were planted by early German settlers and can be found all over the suburb, particularly around George and Victoria Streets and to the south-east, the presence of these pine trees can serve as a good indicator of historical property boundaries and further may be present in the nature reserves and parks that populate the region. Invasive species remain as one of the suburbs major environmental problems.

===Political geography===
The suburb boundaries roughly form the shape of an L flipped horizontally, bordered by Wetherby Road, Victoria Street and Blackburn Road to the west, adjoining Doncaster and Templestowe, the Mullum Mullum Creek, Springvale Road and Tunstall Road in the east, adjoining Warrandyte and Donvale and the Koonung Creek to the south, adjoining Blackburn North. The north-east section of the suburb sits on the western side of the Mullum Mullum Valley and is very occasionally referred to as being whole or part of West Warrandyte and rarer still, East Templestowe. There are many small anecdotal localities that have established individual community identities within the suburb, some of these include:

*Donburn – Around the Blackburn Road/Doncaster Road intersection.
*Deep Creek – The northernmost area of the suburb, near the Mullum Mullum Creek.
*Milgate – Milgate Park and surrounds.
*Tunstall – Around Tunstall Square and Tunstall Road.
*Waldau – Historically, the area surrounding George and Victoria Streets.
*The Pines – The area north of The Pines Shopping Centre.

== Traditional ownership ==
The formally recognised traditional owners for the area in which Doncaster is located are the Wurundjeri people. The Wurundjeri people are represented by the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung Cultural Heritage Aboriginal Corporation.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census, there were 30,926 people living within Doncaster East.

==Community==
Doncaster East has had a significant Chinese minority for many years. Therefore, there are a number of Chinese restaurants, notable in quality and quantity for being outside Chinatown in Little Bourke Street.

The suburb contains many diverse places of worship servicing the Anglican, Baptist, Catholic, Gospel, Islamic and Uniting faiths.

==Transport==
Public transport in the City of Manningham consists of regular bus services that cover most of the suburb. Plans for a railway line to Doncaster East were scrapped by the Cain Labor Government and as a result local residents rely heavily on the use of cars.

The suburb is serviced primarily by the Eastern Freeway to the south and Reynolds Road in the north. Through traffic consists primarily of cars and buses traveling to neighbouring Warrandyte and Donvale through the use of Heidelberg – Warrandyte Road, Reynolds Road and Tindals Road (Old Warrandyte Road)

Within the suburban boundaries, Doncaster East is serviced by George Street, King Street and Victoria Street. Running north-south is Blackburn Road, which holds most of the flow of traffic during weekday peak hour times, together with Springvale Road, as residents travel from their homes to the Eastern Freeway and into the city.

It enables residents of Doncaster East increased ease of travel when travelling through Melbourne&#x27;s eastern and south-eastern suburbs.

Certain areas of land are currently awaiting development, including the former Box Hill Institute of TAFE&#x27;s East Doncaster campus, now a newly subdivided small housing estate and a large area surrounding the Cherry Hill Tavern, which is proposed for a reception centre.

There are several vacant blocks of land in the suburb, many surrounding The Pines Shopping Centre.

Many people are active members of certain clubs or facilities in Doncaster East. Popular activities include Hockey, Cricket, Scouts, Athletics, Football (AFL), Soccer, Lawn Bowls, Walking, Bike Riding and Dog Walking. The waters of the Mullum Mullum Creek are too shallow for swimming in the summer months, however, this does not stop exploration or walks on the paths around the creek.

The Doncaster Hockey Club was established in October 1974. The council first allowed them to start the club at Timber Ridge Reserve. It was later moved to George Street before being allowed to establish a home at Mullum Mullum Reserve where it is today. In 1985 it was the first Australian Club to have a synthetic turf. The club has had 6 Olympians at Doncaster, Chris Ciriello, Russell Ford, Andrew Smith, Lachlan and James Elmer and Joshua Simmonds. http://doncasterhockeyclub.com.au/about-us/club-history/

<doc id="711628" wikidata="Q1141821" url="?curid=711628" title="Misbaha">
<text>A Misbaha (), subḥa () (Arabic and Urdu), tusbaḥ (Somali), tasbīḥ () (Iran, India, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Malaysia and Indonesia), or tespih (Turkish, Bosnian and Albanian) is prayer beads often used by Muslims for the tasbih, the recitation of prayers, the dhikr, as well as to glorify Allah. It is similar to the Japamala used in Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism, and Buddhism, and the Rosary in Catholicism.

==Use==
A misbaḥah is a tool that is used as an aid to perform dhikr, including the names of God in Islam, and after regular prayer. It is often made of wooden or plastic beads, but also of olive seeds, ivory, pearls, and semi-precious stones such as carnelian, onyx, and amber. 

A typical misbahah consists of three groups of beads, separated by two distinct beads (called &quot;imām&quot;s) along with one larger piece (called the &quot;yad&quot;) to serve as the handle. The exact number may vary, but they usually consist of 99 beads to assist in the glorification of God following prayers: 33 Tasbeeh (subhāna-llāh ), 33 Tahmeed (ʾal-ḥamdu li-llāh), and 34 Takbeer (ʾAllāhu ʾakbar). Some suggest the 99 beads also refer to the 99 names of Allah. Smaller misbahas consist of 33 beads, in which case one cycles through them three times to complete 99. However, misbahas may also consist of 100 or 200-count beads to assist in the dhikr duties of certain Sufi orders.

It is often carried by pilgrims, dervishes, and many ordinary Muslims of all groups, however some consider it heretical innovation (&quot;bid&#x27;ah&quot;) and only allow dhikrs to be counted on the fingers. Many Shi&#x27;is use beads made from clay from Karbala, sometimes colored red in memory of the martyred Imam Husayn&#x27;s blood or green in memory of his brother Hasan (who supposedly turned green from poisoning).

Misbahahs are also used culturally to reduce stress or as an indication of status in society.

==History==
In the early Muslim era, prayers were counted on fingers or with pebbles.

According to the 17th-century Shia cleric ʻAllāmah Muhammad Baqir Majlisi, after the 625CE Battle of Uḥud, Fāṭimah (the daughter of Muhammad) would visit the Martyrs&#x27; graveyard every two or three days, and then made a misbaḥah of Ḥamzah ibn ʻAbd al-Muṭṭalib&#x27;s grave-soil. After that, people started making and using &quot;misbaḥahs&quot;.

Some &quot;hadiths&quot; state the benefit of using the fingers of the right hand to count tasbīḥ following regular prayers.

The practice of using misbahahs most likely originated among Sufis and poor people. Opposition to the practice is known from as late as the 15th century, when al-Suyuti wrote an &quot;apologia&quot; for it.

<doc id="711632" wikidata="Q5317974" url="?curid=711632" title="Dwayne Andreas">
<text>Dwayne Orville Andreas (March 4, 1918 – November 16, 2016), was one of the leading farm industrialists of the 20th century. He was often called the Soybean King. 
He was former CEO and chairman of Archer Daniels Midland (ADM). Under his leadership he turned ADM into the largest processor of farm commodities in the United States. 

== Early life ==
Andreas was born in Worthington, Minnesota on March 4, 1918 to Ruben and Lydia (Stoltz) Andreas, who both descended from strict Mennonite families. He grew up mostly in Iowa (with siblings Albert, Lenore, Glen, Osborne and Lowell) and worked at his father farm and later the family&#x27;s feed and grain business. He attended Wheaton College in Illinois, but dropped out in his sophomore year after getting married. Andreas then went to work for a modest, family-owned food-processing firm in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. When Cargill bought the Cedar Rapids facility in 1945, Andreas joined the commodity firm, eventually becoming a vice president. Andreas resigned from Cargill in 1952, and continued in the vegetable oil business, eventually as an executive of the Grain Terminal Association.

== Business career ==
In 1965 Andreas purchased 100,000 shares of Archer Daniels for $3.3 million. Over the following years Andreas gradually increased his holding and his influence in the company, eventually becoming chief executive officer of ADM in 1971.

He is credited with transforming the firm into an industrial powerhouse. Under his leadership, ADM grew from 40 processing plants and about 3,000 employees in the Midwest to 274 processing plants with 23,000 workers around the world. Its soybean exports shot up from $1.5 billion to $7 billion. Andreas remained CEO until 1997, the year that Archer Daniels pleaded guilty to price-fixing and paid $100 million in fines. This scandal also sent his only son, Michael Andreas to prison. Michael was the anointed successor as Andreas started to devolve his power. It was his son who hatched the plan to create global cartels in citric acid and lysine. Andreas stepped down as chairman in 1999 and was succeeded by his nephew, G. Allen Andreas.

== Public service ==

Andreas served as an emissary for the Harry Truman administration and once secured a deal with President Juan Perón and wife Eva &quot;Evita&quot; Perón. In 1961, president John F. Kennedy appointed Andreas to the Food for Peace Committee. An account stated that Hubert Humphrey got him appointed to the committee as advisor to its director, George McGovern.

On March 26, 1965, president Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Andreas to The General Advisory Committee on Foreign Assistance Programs.

On May 2, 1983, President Ronald Reagan appointed Andreas chairman of the President&#x27;s International Private Enterprise Task Force. This agency was tasked to advise the president, the director of the United States International Development Cooperation Agency, and the administrator of the Agency for International Development with respect to the role private enterprise can play in the implementation of programs and activities under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended.

Andreas served as vice chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

In 1986 Andreas agreed, at the request of retired Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, to serve as head of the Foundation for the Commemoration of the United States Constitution which supported the work of the Commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution.

In the 1990s he contributed $2.5 million to Florida public broadcasting network WXEL. He also aided the Community Partnership for the Homeless.

In 1997 Andreas donated $2.2 million to the Miami Homeless Assistance Center, saying &quot;The one thing that is more gratifying than successfully making money is giving it away to a wonderful cause.&quot;

Andreas was one of several signatories to a May 20, 2004, open letter exhorting President George W. Bush to lift travel and humanitarian aid restrictions on Cuba. He is the namesake of Barry University&#x27;s Dwayne O. Andreas School of Law.

== Politics ==
Andreas was one of the most prominent political campaign donors in the United States, having contributed millions of dollars to Democratic and Republican candidates alike.

While not well known to the public, Andreas commanded much respect among Washington politicians for his largesse. As part of the investigations surrounding illegal campaign fundraising linked to the Watergate scandal, Andreas was charged with (but acquitted of) illegally contributing $100,000 to Hubert Humphrey&#x27;s 1968 presidential campaign. In 1972, Andreas unlawfully contributed $25,000 to President Nixon&#x27;s re-election campaign through the convicted Watergate burglar Bernard Barker. Other recipients of Andreas&#x27;s &quot;tithing&quot; — as he puts it — have included George H. W. Bush, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Bob Dole, Michael Dukakis, Jesse Jackson, and Jack Kemp.

According to &quot;Mother Jones&quot; magazine:
During the 1992 election, Andreas gave more than $1.4 million in soft money and $345,000 to individual candidates, using multiple donors in his company and family members (including wife Inez) to circumvent contribution limits.

Andreas was implicated in the financial scandal of the Orthodox Church in America for his donations to Russia in 1991.

One of his closest friends was former New York governor and two-time Republican presidential candidate, Thomas E. Dewey. It was Andreas who discovered his friend following Dewey&#x27;s fatal heart attack in his room at Seaview, a Florida, Hotel in which Andreas held partial ownership.

Andreas was portrayed by Tom Smothers in the 2009 film &quot;The Informant!&quot; about the lysine price-fixing conspiracy.

== Personal life ==
In 1935, at age 17, Andreas married Bertha Benedict in Florida. They had a daughter but subsequently divorced. In 1947, Andreas married Inez Snyder in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She was a single mother of a daughter. Andreas and Inez had a son Michael whose godfather was Hubert Humphrey. Humphrey was a friend and political mentor to Andreas. For many years they lived in the Decatur, Illinois, area and after retirement moved to Bal Harbour, Florida. Andreas died on November 16, 2016, in Decatur, Illinois, at the age of 98.

On January 26, 2022, Andreas&#x27; granddaughter Regan Andreas Deering, announced her candidacy for the newly formed Illinois&#x27;s 13th congressional district.

<doc id="711634" wikidata="Q3785182" url="?curid=711634" title="Here Come the Miracles">
<text>Here Come the Miracles is a double album by Steve Wynn. It was released in 2001 on Blue Rose Records. It is the first album in Wynn&#x27;s &quot;desert trilogy&quot;.

==Production==
The album was recorded in Tucson, Arizona, at Wavelab Studios. Wynn&#x27;s friends Linda Pitmon (drums), Chris Brokaw (guitar), and Chris Cacavas (keyboards) played on the album.

==Critical reception==
&quot;No Depression&quot; wrote that &quot;Wynn’s nineteen-song cycle of a Southern California suspended between the millennium and the apocalypse infuses his literary aspirations with rock ‘n’ roll smarts, as if he&#x27;s fronting Raymond Chandler&#x27;s supercharged garage band.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the album &quot;a freewheeling yet self-assured balance of Wynn’s own voice and the influences long associated with him--the darkness of the Velvet Underground, the spaciousness of Neil Young and the oblique introspection of Bob Dylan.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the album the best of Wynn&#x27;s career. The &quot;Cleveland Scene&quot; called it &quot;an amazing, visionary double CD, a voyage through the psychic topography of contemporary Los Angeles that taps into and expresses deep fears as well as hopes for redemption.&quot;

<doc id="711640" wikidata="Q4737759" url="?curid=711640" title="Suspended sentence">
<text>A suspended sentence is a sentence on conviction for a criminal offence, the serving of which the court orders to be deferred in order to allow the defendant to perform a period of probation. If the defendant does not break the law during that period and fulfills the particular conditions of the probation, the sentence is usually considered fulfilled. If the defendant commits another offence or breaks the terms of probation, the court can order the sentence to be served, in addition to any sentence for the new offence.

==Australia==

In Australia, suspended sentences are commonly imposed in order to alleviate the strain on overcrowded prisons. For example, an individual may be sentenced to a six-month jail term, wholly suspended for six months; if they commit any other offence during that year, the original jail term is immediately applied in addition to any other sentence.

As of 1 September, 2014, suspended sentences no longer exist in Victoria, and in its place are community correction orders, which can be for a fixed term to ensure good behaviour.

==Canada==
==People&#x27;s Republic of China==

In the People&#x27;s Republic of China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau), both suspended sentences and suspended &quot;sentencing&quot; (, also translated as a sentence &quot;with reprieve&quot;) are featured in the criminal law. In the first situation, a fixed-term sentence of three years or below can be suspended. In the second situation, sentencing does not immediately follow the guilty verdict, but instead is determined after a period of probation.

Death sentences can also be suspended (called a &quot;death sentence with reprieve&quot;), so that an offender who does not intentionally re-offend during the two-year suspension period of release would have the sentence commuted to a life sentence.

==Finland==
A suspended sentence is called in Finnish, which translates to &quot;conditional imprisonment&quot;. When a sentence of imprisonment, which can be at most two years, is imposed conditionally, the enforcement of the sentence is postponed for a probation period. The length of the probation period is at least one and at most three years. The probation period begins at the pronouncement or the issue of the judgment. When conditional imprisonment is imposed, the convicted person shall be notified, in connection with the pronouncement or the issue of the judgment, of the date when the probation period ends and of the grounds on which the sentence may be ordered to be enforced. A sentence of conditional imprisonment may be combined with fines or, if the sentence is longer than eight months, with community service of at least 14 and up to 120 hours. Additional surveillance of the convicted can also be ordered, if it is seen as necessary to reduce recurrent criminal behaviour. 

The court may order the enforcement of conditional imprisonment if the convicted person commits an offence during the probation period and the charge has been brought within one year of the end of the probation period. In this event, the conditional sentence to be enforced, the sentence for the offence committed during the probation period and the sentences of imprisonment for the other offences considered in the same trial shall be joined as one unconditional sentence of imprisonment. The court may also order that conditional imprisonment be enforced only in part, in which case the remainder of the sentence shall continue to be conditional, subject to the same probation period.

==France==

The &quot;Loi Béranger&quot; (Béranger bill) was introduced in March 26, 1891 in the French penal code. It was amended in 1958 and 1983. It allows for three types of suspended sentence:

* &quot;sursis simple&quot; (simple suspended sentence) – introduced in 1891. The only condition is to not commit any felony for a certain period of time after the final sentencing. Usually this period is five years. This can be proscribed to any legal entity, including companies and people.
* &quot;sursis probatoire&quot; (suspended sentence with probation) – introduced in 1958. this is reserved only to people. It contains checks and balances, and may be combined with other requirements. Before 2020, this was known as &quot;sursis probatoire avec mise à l&#x27;épreuve&quot;.
* &quot;sursis assorti avec obligation d&#x27;accomplir un travail d&#x27;intéret géneral&quot; (suspended sentence combined with mandatory community service) – introduced in 1983.

== Germany ==
The (German Criminal Code) makes provision for suspended sentences for up to five years. When a defendant is sentenced to a prison sentence under one year, the default is suspension &quot;if there are reasons to believe that the sentence itself will serve as sufficient warning to the convicted person&quot;. Courts can impose requirements on offenders (e.g. residency, non-contact, drug rehabilitation) as part of the suspended sentence, and combine it with a fine or order for restitution.

==Ireland==
In the law of the Republic of Ireland, the 2006 law by which a suspended sentence is activated was ruled unconstitutional in 2016. The 2006 law required that a court decision on whether to activate the suspended sentence be made as soon as a later conviction was handed down, even if there was an appeal pending for the later conviction. Subsequent legislation introduced in 2017 corrected the deficiencies identified, introducing an effective appeal mechanism. 

==Japan==
 are common practice in Japan and can be applied in cases where a sentence is for up to three years in prison and/or 500,000 yen in fines. Any criminal activity during the period of the suspended sentence will result in the cancellation of the sentence and imprisonment for the prescribed term.

== Russia ==
In Russia suspended sentence () is commonplace and its application is stipulated by an Article 73 of the Russian Criminal Code. The suspended sentences may not be applied to child offenders (minors aged 14 or less when the offence was committed), to those who have committed a serious or very serious crime (the definition of which is given by Article 15 of the same Code as of 2019), or in case of crime recurrence. The judge may also impose additional restrictions on how the probation must be served. Initial sentence is enforced in case of convicted failing to fulfill conditions of the probation.

==United Kingdom==
In England and Wales, a custodial sentence may, at the discretion of the sentencing judge or magistrates, be suspended for up to two years if the term of imprisonment is under two years and the offender agrees to comply with court requirements, which may include a curfew, performing unpaid work, and/or engaging in an appropriate rehabilitation programme. In 2017, 5% of convictions resulted in a suspended sentence, compared to 7% immediate custodial sentences.

The sentencing guidelines indicate that it is appropriate for a sentence to be suspended if there is strong personal mitigation and/or a realistic prospect of rehabilitation, but suspended sentences should not be used for offenders who pose a risk to the public or who have a history of poor compliance with court orders.

Suspended sentences were introduced to English law by the Criminal Justice Act 1967.

==United States==
In the United States, it is common practice for judges to hand down suspended sentences to first-time offenders who have committed a minor crime, and for prosecutors to recommend suspended sentences as part of a plea bargain. They are often given to mitigate the effect of penalties.

In some jurisdictions, the criminal record of the guilty party will still carry the offense, even after probation is adequately served. Suspending a sentence does not completely remove the conviction from a person&#x27;s record. While it may be hidden from the public, it is not hidden from law enforcement. In other cases, the process of deferred adjudication prevents the conviction from appearing on a person&#x27;s criminal record, once probation had been completed.

In military trials governed by the Uniform Code of Military Justice, officers meting out non-judicial punishment may suspend the punishment they order.

<doc id="711644" wikidata="Q17011523" url="?curid=711644" title="List of early microcomputers">
<text>This is a list of early microcomputers sold to hobbyists and developers. These microcomputers were often sold as &quot;DIY&quot; kits or pre-built machines in relatively small numbers in the mid-1970s. These systems were primarily used for teaching the use of microprocessors and supporting peripheral devices, and unlike home computers were rarely used with pre-written application software. Most early micros came without alphanumeric keyboards or displays, which had to be provided by the user. RAM was quite small in the unexpanded systems (a few hundred bytes to a few kilobytes). By 1976 the number of pre-assembled machines was growing, and the 1977 introduction of the &quot;Trinity&quot; of Commodore PET, TRS-80 and Apple II generally marks the end of the &quot;early&quot; microcomputer era, and the advent of the consumer home computer era that followed.

==Discrete logic==
Before the advent of microprocessors, it was possible to build small computers using small-scale integrated circuits (ICs), where each IC contained only a few logic gates or flip-flops.
* The Kenbak-1 (1971) used small-scale integration transistor–transistor logic (TTL) ICs and had 256 bytes of memory. It was priced at USD 750 and sold only 40 units.
* Datapoint 2200 (shipped 1971) was the first machine &quot;designed&quot; to use a microprocessor, but when Intel could not deliver the 8008 in time, they released the machine using discrete logic.
* The EDUC-8 (1975) was an &quot;Electronics Australia&quot; magazine project describing a computer built from TTL ICs.

==Test, single-board and development machines==
As microprocessors were developed, companies often released simple development systems to bootstrap the use of the processor. These systems were often converted by hobbyists into complete computer systems.

Intel&#x27;s Intellec computers were a series of early microcomputers Intel produced starting in the 1970s as a development platform for their processors.

==Kits==
Many early microcomputers were available in Electronic kit form. Machines were sold in small numbers, with final assembly by the user. Kits took advantage of this by offering the system at a low price point. Kits were popular, beginning in 1975, with the introduction of the famous Altair 8800, but as sales volumes increased, kits became less common. The introduction of useful fully assembled machines in 1977 led to the rapid disappearance of kit systems for most users. The ZX81 was one of the last systems commonly available in both kit and assembled form. 

Some magazines published plans and printed circuit board layouts from which a reader could in principle duplicate the project, although usually commercially made boards could be ordered to expedite assembly. Other kits varied from etched, drilled, printed circuit boards and a parts list to packages containing cases, power supplies, and all interconnections. All kits required significant assembly by the user.

==Complete microcomputers==
A number of complete microcomputers were offered even before kits became popular, dating to as far back as 1972. For some time there was a major market for assembled versions of the Altair 8800, a market that grew significantly through the late 1970s and into the early 1980s. The introduction of three computers aimed at personal users in 1977, the Radio Shack TRS-80, Apple II, and Commodore PET, significantly changed the American microcomputer market and led to the home computer revolution.

<text>Yang Ming Marine Transport Corporation () is a Taiwanese container shipping company based in Keelung, Taiwan.

==History==
The company was founded in 1972 as a shipping line, but has historical links through its merger with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (1872–1995), which dates back to the Qing Dynasty. 

Yang Ming currently operates 101 container ships up to and 17 bulk carriers.

In between July and September 2018, Yang Ming agreed to offer a service from the Port of Keelung, Taiwan, to the US for two batches of nearly 20 containers each, containing over 1700 unused nuclear fuel rods, after the Taiwan Power Company decided to close its fourth nuclear plant. Safety concerns for possible leakage of radioactive materials were raised, and the first shipment was attended by over 200 police officers and company officers.

On 10 March 2019, Yang Ming has welcomed two additional 14,000 TEU vessels in its fleet, &quot;YM Warranty&quot; and &quot;YM Wellspring&quot;.
The ships have been built in Japan at Imabari Shipbuilding, at a cost of nearly $99 million each. The additional tonnage is composed of sisters of the previously delivered &quot;YM Wellbeing&quot;, &quot;YM Wonderland&quot; and &quot;YM Wisdom&quot;.

In May 2019, under the scope of improving its network, an agreement with the Canadian Pacific Railway was reached to have containers moved by rail from the Port of Vancouver eastbound to all Canada.

== Subsidiaries ==
The Yang Ming Group includes a logistics unit (Yes Logistics Corp. and Jing Ming Transport Co.), container terminals in Taiwan, Belgium, Netherlands and the USA, as well as stevedoring services (Port of Kaohsiung, Taiwan). Yang Ming&#x27;s service scope covers over 70 nations with more than 170 service points

==THE Alliance - Premier Alliance ==
Along with Hapag-Lloyd, HMM Co Ltd, and Ocean Network Express, Yang Ming Marine Transport Corporation was a member of THE Alliance. THE Alliance was intended to provide 34 services, directly calling at 81 different ports on a monthly basis. From March 2025, THE Alliance was replaced by Premier Alliance, composed by the same members, excluding Hapag-Lloyd.

== Fleet ==
As of mid-2019, Yang Ming operated a fleet of over 4.2-million-D.W.T / operating capacity 643 thousand TEU, of which container ships are the main service force.
== Accidents and incidents ==

=== &quot;YM Efficiency&quot; ===
On 4 June 2018, the container ship &quot;YM Efficiency&quot; lost 83 containers at sea due to extreme rough weather conditions close to Australia, New South Wales coast,
that made the cargo break their lashing and fall into the waters.
A safety warning had to be issued, as despite the fact that no dangerous goods were discharged into the sea, some medical and surgical items were noted floating and then recovered ashore, polluting a number of beaches. On 9 August 2024, the Liberian flagged ship &quot;YM Mobility&quot; caught fire in the port of Ningbo, due to a reported explosion in a container. No one was injured.

<doc id="711649" wikidata="Q926913" url="?curid=711649" title="Brompton Cemetery">
<text>Brompton Cemetery (originally the West of London and Westminster Cemetery) is since 1852 the first (and only) London cemetery to be Crown property, managed by The Royal Parks, in West Brompton in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. It is one of the Magnificent Seven cemeteries. Established by Act of Parliament and laid out in 1839, it opened in 1840. Consecrated by Charles James Blomfield, Bishop of London, in June 1840, it is one of Britain&#x27;s oldest and most distinguished garden cemeteries. Some 35,000 monuments, from simple headstones to substantial mausolea, mark more than 205,000 resting places. The site includes large plots for family mausolea, and common graves where coffins are piled deep into the earth. It also has a small columbarium, and a secluded Garden of Remembrance at the northern end for cremated remains. The cemetery continues to be open for burials. It is also known as an urban haven for nature. In 2014, it was awarded a National Lottery grant to carry out essential restoration and develop a visitor centre, among other improvements. The restoration work was completed in 2018.

Although the cemetery was originally established by a private company, it is now the property of the Crown.

==Location==

Brompton Cemetery is adjacent to West Brompton station in west London, England. The main entrance is at North Lodge, Old Brompton Road in West Brompton, SW5, in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. There is another entrance at South Lodge, located on the Fulham Road, SW10 near the junction with Redcliffe Gardens.

==History==






By the early years of the 19th century, inner city burial grounds, mostly churchyards, had long been unable to cope with the number of burials and were seen as a hazard to health and an undignified way to treat the dead. In 1837 a decision was made to lay out a new burial ground in Brompton, London. The moving spirit behind the project was the architect and engineer, Stephen Geary, and it was necessary to form a company in order to get parliamentary permission to raise capital for the purpose. Geary was appointed as architect but was later forced to resign. Securing the land – some 40 acres – from local landowner, Lord Kensington and the Equitable Gas Light Company, as well as raising the money proved an extended challenge. The cemetery became one of seven large, new cemeteries founded by private companies in the mid-19th century (sometimes called the &#x27;Magnificent Seven&#x27;) forming a ring around the edge of London.

The site, previously market gardens, was bought with the intervention of John Gunter of Fulham, and was in area. Brompton Cemetery was eventually designed by architect, Benjamin Bauda. At its centre is a modest sandstone domed chapel dated 1839; at its southern end, are two symmetrical long colonnades, now all Grade II* listed, in the style of St. Peter&#x27;s Square in Rome, and flanked by catacombs. It was intended to give the feel of a large open air cathedral. It is rectangular in shape with the north end pointing to the northwest and the south end to the southeast. It has a central &quot;nave&quot; which runs from Old Brompton Road towards the central colonnade and chapel. During a 4-year restoration project that began in 2014, an original Victorian flooring with Bath and York stone radial pattern was uncovered underneath the chapel carpet.

Below the colonnades are catacombs which were originally conceived as a cheaper alternative burial to having a plot in the grounds of the cemetery. Unfortunately, the catacombs were not a success and only about 500 of the many thousands of places in them were sold. The Metropolitan Interments Act 1850 (13 &amp; 14 Vict. c. 52) gave the government powers to purchase commercial cemeteries. The shareholders of the cemetery company were relieved to be able to sell their shares as the cost of building the cemetery had overrun and they had seen little return on their investment and there were few burials at first.

During World War II the cemetery suffered bomb damage.

==Heritage status==
As a site, the cemetery is listed Grade I in the English Heritage Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England. The chapel and each arcade quadrant is separately listed as Grade II*. Frederick Richards Leyland&#x27;s is the only Grade II* listed funerary monument. Several other individual monuments are listed Grade II. They include:
* Tomb of Peter Borthwick and family
* Burnside Monument (to Iris Burnside drowned on SS Lusitania)
* Chelsea Pensioners Monument
* Tomb of Clement Family
* Tomb of Robert Coombes
* Tomb of Herbert Fitch
* Tomb of Percy E. Lambert
* Mausoleum of Harvey Lewis
* Mausoleum of James McDonald
* Tomb of Alfred Mellon
* Tomb of Barbe Marie Therese Sangiorgi (wife of Soho restaurateur August Kettner)
* Tomb of Samuel Leigh Sotheby

In all there are up to forty items associated with the cemetery which have a Historic England listing, including gates and telephone kiosks.

==Burials==
Brompton was closed to burials between 1952 and 1996, except for family and Polish interments, of which there are over 300. In the 21st century it is once again a working cemetery, with plots for interments and a &#x27;Garden of Remembrance&#x27; for the deposit of cremated remains. Many nationalities and faiths from across the world are represented in the cemetery.

===Military graves===
From 1854 to 1939, Brompton Cemetery became the London District&#x27;s Military Cemetery. The Royal Hospital Chelsea purchased a plot in the north west corner where they have a monument in the form of an obelisk; the Brigade of the Guards has its own section south of that. There are 289 Commonwealth service personnel of World War I and 79 of World War II, whose graves are registered and maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. A number of veterans are listed in the Notable Interments. Although the majority of war graves are in the dedicated railed section to the west – also containing 19th century services graves – a number of servicemen&#x27;s graves are scattered in other areas. Besides the British there are many notable Czechoslovak, Polish and Russian military burials.

It was originally planned that Sir Arthur Sullivan of Gilbert and Sullivan fame would also be buried there with his family, until Queen Victoria insisted on his interment in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

===Exhumations===
In the late 1880s when the nearby Earl&#x27;s Court Exhibition Grounds played host to the American Show with Buffalo Bill, a number of Native American performers in the show, died while on tour in Britain. The Sioux chief, Long Wolf, a veteran of the Oglala Sioux wars was buried here on 13 June 1892 having died age 59 of bronchial pneumonia. He shared the grave with a 17-month-old Sioux girl named White Star believed to have fallen from her mother&#x27;s arms while on horseback. A British woman, Elizabeth Knight, traced his family 105 years later and campaigned with them to have his remains returned to the land of his birth. In 1997, Chief Long Wolf was finally moved to a new plot at Wolf Creek Cemetery (ancestral burial ground of the Oglala Sioux tribe) in Pine Ridge, South Dakota.

His great-grandson John Black Feather said &quot;Back then, they had burials at sea, they did ask his wife if she wanted to take him home and she figured that as soon as they hit the water they would throw him overboard, so that&#x27;s why they left him here.&quot;

There was a Brulé Sioux tribesman buried in Brompton named Paul Eagle Star. His plot was in the same section as Oglala Sioux warrior Surrounded By the Enemy who died in 1887 from a lung infection at age 22. Like Long Wolf, he took part of Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show. Paul died a few days after breaking his ankle when he fell off a horse in August 1891. His casket was exhumed in spring of 1999 by his grandchildren, Moses and Lucy Eagle Star. The reburial took place in Rosebud&#x27;s Lakota cemetery. Philip James accompanied the repatriation.

Little Chief and Good Robe&#x27;s 18-month-old son, Red Penny, who travelled in Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show is also buried here. His specific resting place within the cemetery is not known.

Two notable Polish figures originally buried in Brompton Cemetery were reburied in Powazki Cemetery, Warsaw:
* General Michał Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski – founder of a Polish resistance unit in World War II and war hero, who died in Casablanca on 22 May 1964. The urn containing his ashes was reburied at Powazki in September 1992.
* Major General Felicjan Sławoj Składkowski – prime minister of Poland before outbreak of the Second World War, who died in London in August 1962, was reburied at Powazki on 8 June 1990.
Two other exhumations involved Polish bishops of the Polish Orthodox Church:
* Sawa, Jerzy Jewgieniewicz Sowietow, rus. Георгий Евгеньевич Советов – Gieorgij Jewgienjewicz Sowietow, (1898 in St Petersburg – 1951 in London) – bishop of the Polish Autocephalous Orthodox Church and bishop in the Polish Armed Forces during World War II.
* Bishop Mateusz, Konstanty Siemaszko (1894 in Babice – 1985 in London) – bishop of the Polish Orthodox Church.
Both were re-buried at the Orthodox Cemetery, Warsaw on 31 December 2012.

==Funerary art==
The richness of the art and symbolism contained in many graves traces art movements across two centuries. Aside from the stonemason&#x27;s and sculptor&#x27;s craft, there is a vast array of lettering, decorative ironwork (sadly in a very corroded state) and ceramics. Some graves and mausolea are the work of noted artists and architects.

==Flora and fauna==

Although never envisaged as a park, JC Loudon devised the original planting scheme that was not fully realised, however, pines were imported from Poland with the prospect that in maturity they would cast shade over the graves. There are over 60 species of trees, of which the limes are dated to 1838. The fact of the enclosure of the cemetery by a wall, has preserved almost intact, a distinct area of Victorian country flora. The adjacent West London line afforded a green corridor for many years, enriched by ballast from the South Downs when Counter&#x27;s Creek was filled in and two railway lines constructed in mid-19th century, although a small wetland area was preserved by West Brompton station. However recent redevelopment along the station has further reduced local biodiversity and further reductions are planned with the major redevelopment of nearby Earls Court Exhibition Centre.

In the cemetery each season brings its features, like snow-drops and bluebells or wild lupin and foxgloves, broad-leaf pea, ferns and horse tail. There are small scale wooded areas and meadows. Since the land was used for market gardens, there are wild cabbages, asparagus and garlic among the slabs. A grape vine has fallen victim to maintenance. In Autumn, there can be a display of fungi, a mycologist&#x27;s trove. The evergreens and ivy are a haven for birds and countless insects. Over 200 species of moth and butterfly have been identified in the cemetery. Despite the absence of a permanent water feature, there have been sightings of amphibians, notably a toad. Mammals are represented by bats, a range of rodents, including grey squirrels and one or two families of foxes. Among the birds, there is a long-standing population of carrion crows and several garden species with the addition of green woodpeckers and occasionally, nesting kestrels and ring-necked parakeets. The appearance of a female ring-necked pheasant in 2012 was short-lived.

&quot;Brompton Cemetery has been identified as a Site of Borough Importance for &quot;Nature Conservation (grade I)&quot; comprising moderately diverse grassland that contains at least three notable London species that support a diverse assemblage of invertebrates&quot;.

==Public access==
The cemetery is open daily to the public throughout the year, with opening times varying with the seasons. It is regularly visited by the Parks Police Service to monitor and curb occurrences of anti-social behaviour.
Dog walking and cycling, under strict control, is permitted on indicated paths. Through traffic is forbidden and there is no parking. Any visiting vehicles must observe a 5 mph limit. The byelaws are displayed on boards at both entrances.
The Friends of Brompton Cemetery organise Open Days, regular tours and other public attractions.

The cemetery has a reputation for being a popular cruising ground for gay men.

==Beatrix Potter connection==
Beatrix Potter, who lived in Old Brompton Road nearby and enjoyed walking around it, may have taken the names of some of her characters from tombstones in the cemetery. Names of people buried there included Mr Nutkins, Mr McGregor, Mr Brock, Mr Tod, Jeremiah Fisher and even a Peter Rabbett, although it is not known for certain if there were tombstones with all these names.

==In film==

Brompton Cemetery has featured in a number of films, including &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; (2009), as the exterior of a Russian church in &quot;Goldeneye&quot;, &quot;Stormbreaker&quot;, &quot;Johnny English,&quot; &quot;The Wings of the Dove,&quot; &quot;Eastern Promises&quot;, and &quot;The Gentlemen&quot;.

<doc id="711653" wikidata="Q5323287" url="?curid=711653" title="ELF II">
<text>The Netronics ELF II was an early microcomputer trainer kit featuring the RCA 1802 microprocessor, 256 bytes of RAM, DMA-based bitmap graphics, hexadecimal keypad, two-digit hexadecimal LED display, a single &quot;Q&quot; LED, and 5 expansion slots. The system was developed and sold by Netronics Research and Development Limited in New Milford, CT, USA.

== Hardware ==
Available hardware accessories included:
* The &quot;Giant Board&quot; (ROM monitor, serial and parallel I/O, Cassette interface)
* 4KB and 16KB (static) RAM boards
* Low-resolution color graphics board
* &quot;Full BASIC&quot; board with BASIC preloaded in ROM chips
* EPROM burner board
* External power supply
* Attractive, heavy-duty metal cases for the CPU and power supply

==Software==
Available software included:
* Tiny BASIC (integer BASIC interpreter)
* Text Editor
* Full BASIC (floating point BASIC interpreter using Reverse Polish Notation)

==Notable Features==
* Unlike similar &quot;bare circuit card&quot; trainer/experimenter computers of the day, the ELF II could be easily expanded thanks to its built-in bus.
* Memory mapped TV graphics was provided in the base kit by the CDP1861 &quot;Pixie-Graphics&quot; chip. Pixels were large. With unexpanded 256 byte memory, the interrupt routine needed to service the chip showed on the screen.
* The &quot;Full BASIC&quot; ROM card provided an RPN calculator chip as a simple and low-cost math coprocessor. As a result, floating point operations were an order of magnitude faster than what was possible in software. However, the BASIC syntax for math was non-standard as it used postfix RPN (see code example below). Historically, this was also the heyday of Hewlett-Packard calculators, so it was a fair bet that any technically-minded person willing to assemble a computer either already knew RPN or could easily learn it and adapt.
10 REM This program will print the number 30
20 A=10,B=20
30 C=A#B+
40 PRINT C
50 END
 In the code above, the &quot;#&quot; symbol is equivalent to the &quot;Enter&quot; key on a RPN calculator.

==Netronics Video Terminal==
Netronics also offered:
* An ASCII keyboard kit
* Heavy-duty metal keyboard case
* Video terminal card kit (monochrome text, 16 lines by 64 characters, upper &amp; lower case)
The keyboard could be used alone to generate ASCII parallel codes. The video terminal card fits underneath the keyboard in the optional case to form a stand-alone video terminal sending and receiving serial ASCII. Either configuration could be interfaced to the ELF II through the Giant Board. The terminal kits were also marketed independently of the ELF II.

== The Name ==
The ELF part of the name came from an earlier machine called the &quot;COSMAC ELF&quot;, published as a construction project in Popular Electronics magazine. Improvements on its predecessor included an etched PCB, a hexadecimal keypad instead of toggle switches for program entry, the RCA CDP1861 Pixie-graphics chip, and the 5 slot 86-line bus for expansion cards.

<doc id="711658" wikidata="Q181002" url="?curid=711658" title="Peugeot 505">
<text>The Peugeot 505 is a large family car produced by the French manufacturer Peugeot from 1978 to 1992 in Sochaux, France. It was also manufactured in various other countries including Argentina (by Sevel from 1981 to 1995), China, Thailand, Indonesia and Nigeria. The 505 was Peugeot&#x27;s last rear-wheel drive car.

According to the manufacturer, 1,351,254 505s were produced between 1978 and 1992 with 1,116,868 of these being saloons/sedans.

==History==

Officially unveiled on 16 May 1979, the 505 was the replacement for the 504 with which it shared many of its underpinnings. It was originally available as a sedan/saloon; a station wagon/estate, including an eight-passenger &quot;Familiale&quot; version, were introduced at the 1982 Geneva Motor Show. The styling, a collaboration between Pininfarina and Peugeot&#x27;s internal styling department, is very similar to that of the smaller 305. The original interior was designed by Paul Bracq, generally more well known for his work for Mercedes-Benz and BMW. It is known as the &quot;Work Horse&quot; of Africa today. The front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout differentiated the 505 from many of its marketplace competitors.

After initially being produced only in left-hand drive for its first few months, the 505 was available in right-hand drive for the UK market from October 1979. Its best selling competitor in the UK was the Ford Granada.

The 505 was praised by contemporary journalists for its ride and handling, especially on rough and unmade roads; perhaps one reason for its popularity in less developed countries. The 505 also had good ground clearance; if it wasn&#x27;t enough though, Dangel offered a taller four-wheel drive version of the 505 Break/Familiale equipped with either the intercooled turbodiesel engine or the 2.2 L petrol engine. The four-wheel drive 505s converted by Dangel also have shorter gear ratios. Initially higher-end petrol models used a fuel-injected alloy engine while lower-end models models used a carburettor, with a diesel also sold.

The estate model was launched in 1982, and was available with seven seats, just like the Peugeot 504 estate. Also new in 1982 was the fully equipped 505 STI, equipped with the all-new 2165 cc four-cylinder Douvrin engine developed together with Renault. In October 1982, the 505 Turbo Injection was introduced. This used a 2.2-liter version of the Simca Type 180 engine, developed by Chrysler Europe, as this block was stronger than the Douvrin engine used in the STI. The initial model developed ; thanks to the introduction of an intercooler this increased to in early 1984. In 1985 a dealer-installed &quot;Kit de 200ch&quot;, developed by famous Peugeot tuners Danielson, became available. A further upgrade at the time of the 1986 facelift increased power to thanks to a slight increase in boost, at which time ABS brakes were also added to the 505 Turbo.

===Facelift===
The range was given a facelift in 1986, including an all new interior, but European Peugeot 505 production began to wind down following the launch of the smaller Peugeot 405 in 1987. A V6 model, using the 2.8-liter PRV unit, was added during 1986 - priced identically to the 505 Turbo, it targeted a different clientele, trying to fill the gap left by the 604.

Saloon production came to a halt in 1989, when Peugeot launched its new flagship 605 saloon, while the estate remained in production until 1992 - although plans for an estate version of the 605 never materialised. The 605 was in production for a decade but never matched the popularity of the 505. In some countries such as France and Germany, the 505 estate was used as an ambulance, a funeral car, police car, military vehicle and as a road maintenance vehicle. There were prototypes of 505 coupés and 505 trucks, although they never entered production.

The 505 was one of the last Peugeot models to be sold in the United States, with sedan sales ending there in 1990 and wagon sales in 1991. The last sedans sold had PRV&#x27;s 2.8 V6 engine only. Unique to the US were turbocharged station wagons, both with petrol and diesel engines. 505s were also assembled and sold in Australia. First introduced in October 1980, they were initially assembled by Renault Australia. In March 1981 Leyland Australia took over and kept assembling the 505 until the end of 1983. During 1983, Leyland Australia became Jaguar Rover Australia (JRA) and the new company kept selling Peugeots. From 1984 on, 505s sold in Australia were imported fully built up from France. The 505 was also built in Argentina, Chile, China, and New Zealand. In New York City, Peugeot 505 diesels were briefly used as taxicabs.

In Thailand, the Peugeot 505 sold well. It was available as a CKD version assembled in Bangkok, due to the restrictions on importing completely built-up cars.

==Mechanical characteristics==
The 505 had rear-wheel drive and the engine at the front, mounted longitudinally. The suspension system included MacPherson struts and coil springs at front and semi-trailing arms with coil springs at rear, with a body-mounted rear differential and four constant-velocity joints. Station wagons (and most sedans built in Argentina) had instead a live-axle rear suspension, with Panhard rod and coil springs. Stabilizer bars were universal at front but model-dependent at rear. The car used disc brakes at the front, and either disc or drum brakes at the rear, depending on the model. The steering was a rack and pinion system, which was power assisted on most models.

== Break/Familiale ==
Introduced in the spring of 1982, the Break (Estate) and Familiale versions were quite different from saloons. The wheelbase was also longer, to help make it one of the most spacious in the market, at . This was, not coincidentally, the same exact wheelbase as had been used on both the 404 and 504 estate derivatives.

The Familiale (family estate), with its third row of bench seats (giving a total of eight forward-facing seats), was popular with larger families and as a taxi. The two rows of rear seats could be folded to give a completely flat load area, with 1.94 cubic metres of load capacity. The total load carrying capacity is . When released, it was hailed as a luxury touring wagon. The Familiale was marketed as the &quot;SW8&quot; in the United States, for &quot;station wagon, eight seats.&quot;

In France, Dangel produced a modified version of the Peugeot 505 Break with high suspension and 4WD, which made it look like an early crossover SUV.

== Engines ==

A range of diesel and petrol engines were offered. The first diesels (XD2) arrived in July 1979, two months after the petrol versions. The turbocharged petrol unit was first seen in October 1982. 

505s were mainly equipped with inline-four-cylinder engines, although there was a short run of petrol V6&#x27;s built after 604 production had come to an end.

== Trim levels ==

Peugeot 505 models varied very much in equipment. Base &quot;SRD&quot; cars with the 2,304 cc diesel engine didn&#x27;t even have power steering, but the GTD Turbo, the GTI, the V6, and the TI all had power steering, central locking doors, air conditioning, a five-speed manual transmission, sunroof (except the GTD Turbo), and front fog lights. In the V6, the power steering was speed-sensitive, the central locking doors came with an infrared remote, and the heating and ventilation systems included electronic climate control. A three-speed automatic transmission was available on early 505s, which was later replaced by a four-speed unit. The most durable 505 model proved to be the GTD with a five-speed manual transmission. In Australia, the 505 was sold as a GR, SR, STi, or GTi sedan, or an SR or GTi eight-seater station wagon, all with petrol engines. Very few GRD and SRD diesel-engined 505s were sold in Australia. The Series II update saw the SR replaced with an SLi.

===North America===
The United States and Canada had their own 505 body, which arrived for 1980 and was first introduced on the French Caribbean island of Martinique. Notable differences were: gas tank moved inwards (now behind rear bench), with filling neck on rightside, different style quad headlamps, taillights (pre-1986 sedans), distinctive whip antenna moved from roof to rear fender (and changed to telescopic), larger bumpers, tailpipe moved from right to left. Fewer engines were offered, all detuned to meet more restrictive emission standards. The models sold in North America were: Base, &quot;GL&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;GLS&quot;, &quot;STI&quot;, &quot;DL&quot;, &quot;Liberté&quot;, &quot;STX&quot;, &quot;Turbo&quot;, &quot;GLX&quot;, &quot;SW8&quot;, &quot;V6&quot;, &quot;Turbo S&quot;. Originally, only the 2.0-liter four was offered, alongside the 2.3-liter diesel with . Both were carryovers from the 504, although the gasoline unit had gained eight horsepower thanks to the introduction of fuel injection.

Diesel sales were strong in the aftermath of the energy crisis, with diesels reaching a peak level representing 85 percent (14,430 diesels) of the company&#x27;s US sales in 1981 (their best year in the US). Both the XD2S and larger XD3T were available in the US for model years 1985 and 1986, with the smaller engine being fitted to station wagons. By 1986, after the Oldsmobile diesel debacle and many years of stable fuel prices, only the turbodiesel remained and diesel sales were down to a share of just over 10 percent (1,545 out of 14,439). New for 1987 was the limited edition Liberté model (so named in honor of the centennial celebration of the Statue of Liberty). The well equipped Liberté was priced considerably higher than the 2.2-litre GL, close to the GLS model, but received the much less powerful 2-liter petrol &quot;four&quot; producing in the sedan and in the wagon. Diesel engines were no longer available in the US after 1987.

All North-American bound 505&#x27;s were built in Peugeot&#x27;s Sochaux Plant, in France. In December 1980, as a late introduction for the 1981 model year, a 2.3-liter turbodiesel model with arrived. Unlike the naturally aspirated model, the turbodiesel received a five-speed manual as standard fitment. The turbodiesel was very successful as it had no direct competitors in the United States market and represented nearly half of all Peugeot sales during the first model year. In the late spring of 1984, the 1985 505 Turbo arrived. The engine was similar to the one seen in Europe, albeit initially without an intercooler. Max power for 1985 was . This eventually climbed to for later model years. The Turbo estate version was unique to the North American markets.

<text>Shaikh Mohammad Khiābāni (, 1880–1920), sometimes spelled Khiyabani, also known as Shaikh Mohammad Khiābāni Tabrizi was an Iranian Shia cleric, political leader, and representative to the parliament.

He was born in Khameneh, near Tabriz to Haji Abdolhamid (his father) from Khameneh, a merchant. He became active during the Persian Constitutional Revolution and was a prominent dissident against foreign colonialism, which subsequently led to him being sent into exile by the Ottomans in 1918.

After the Russian Revolution of 1917, Khiabani re-established the Democrat Party of Tabriz after being banned for five years, and published the &quot;Tajaddod&quot; newspaper, the official organ of the party, edited by his supporter Taqi Rafat. Later, in a protest to the 1919 Treaty between Iran and the United Kingdom, which exclusively transferred the rights of deciding about all military, financial, and customs affairs of Persia to the British, he revolted and took Tabriz and surrounding areas, calling it Azadistan (&quot;land of liberty&quot;); he was not, however, a separatist. Khiabani and his followers chose the name &quot;Azadistan&quot; as a gesture of protest against the giving of the name &quot;Azerbaijan&quot; to the government centered on Baku in Transcaucasia which is called Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. After the fall of Vosough od-Dowleh, the then prime minister, the new prime minister sent Mehdi Qoli Hedayat to Tabriz, giving him full authority, and he crushed and killed Khiabani in the late summer of 1920 (Hedayat claimed that Khiabani had committed suicide).

<doc id="711663" wikidata="Q18205141" url="?curid=711663" title="Acid house party">
<text>An acid house party was a type of illegal party typically staged in abandoned warehouses between 1987 and 1989. Parties played acid house and acid techno music, electronic music genres with a distinct sound from the use of the Roland TB-303 synthesizer. The origin of the term acid house party is disputed coming either from the 1987 song &quot;Acid Tracks&quot; by Phuture, or the consumption of MDMA and LSD that were common at the parties.

==Setting==

Events and parties were often held in empty warehouses across the UK and were essentially illegal. Some of the most famous party promoters included Energy, Biology, Genesis&#x27;88, Sunrise, and Weekend World. Emerging from Danny Rampling&#x27;s London club Shoom in late 1987, parties grew in northern cities like Manchester (the Madchester scene) where warehouses had closed throughout the 1970s, and up to 10,000 people attended parties in smaller places such as Blackburn. Vague flyers around towns advertised events and information travelled by word of mouth (as well as the newly popular mobile pager) between clubbers who were obliged to party incognito. For most promoters, keeping entry cheap was a political issue - many of the early parties cost just £1 to enter and prices rarely crept above £3. If police turned up to shut down a party, some would open the doors and let everyone in for free.

Tommy Smith, the Hardcore Uproar promoter originally from Dumbarton encapsulated the scene&#x27;s defiant spirit on Granada TV show &#x27;Up Front&#x27;, hosted by Tony Wilson, during a debate with disgruntled Blackburn residents and Conservative MP Ken Hind. Smith declared that he was not on drugs or alcohol, simply “high on hope” and the phrase entered the clubbers&#x27; lexicon and was widely used to market club nights.

==Music==

The music was characterised by the &quot;squelching&quot; bass produced by the Roland TB-303 and loud repetitive beats. It originated in Chicago and took on new qualities when it came to Europe. Songs from the time period include &quot;French Kiss&quot; by Lil Louis &quot;On &amp; On&quot; by Jesse Saunders, &quot;Mystery of Love&quot; by Fingers Inc., &quot;Love Can&#x27;t Turn Around&quot; by Farley &quot;Jackmaster&quot; Funk &amp; Jesse Saunders (featuring Darryl Pandy), &quot;Back to Life (However Do You Want Me)&quot; by Soul II Soul, &quot;I&#x27;ve Lost Control&quot; by Sleezy D, and &quot;Your Only Friend&quot; by Phuture.

The catchphrase of partygoers was ‘Can you feel it?’, alluding to the Royal House cry from &quot;Can you Party?&quot;.

==Decline==

The prevalence of drug use at these parties was in contrast to Thatcherism at the time, sparking moral panic. Police raided parties, such as a 10,000-strong rave in Nelson in 1990. In response, the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the Entertainments (Increased Penalties) Act 1990 which brought the decline of acid house parties. As a result, the time period is often referred to as the Second Summer of Love. Eventually, acid house parties morphed into the rave scene.

<doc id="711665" wikidata="Q311388" url="?curid=711665" title="Constantinian shift">
<text>The Constantinian shift was, according to some theologians and historians of antiquity, a set of political and theological changes that took place during the 4th-century under the leadership of Emperor Constantine the Great. Rodney Clapp claims that the shift or change started in the year 200. The term was popularized by the Mennonite theologian John H. Yoder. He claims that the change was not just freedom from persecution but an alliance between the State and the Church that led to a kind of Caesaropapism. The claim that there ever was a Constantinian shift has been disputed; Peter Leithart argues that there was a &quot;brief, ambiguous &#x27;Constantinian moment&#x27; in the fourth century&quot;, but that there was &quot;no permanent, epochal &#x27;Constantinian shift.

==The Shift==

Constantine the Great (reigned 306–337) adopted Christianity as his system of belief after his victory at the Battle of Milvian Bridge in 312. The following year, 313, he issued the Edict of Milan with his eastern colleague, Licinius. The edict legalised Christianity alongside other religions in the Roman Empire. 
In 325 the First Council of Nicaea signalled consolidation of Christianity under an orthodoxy endorsed by Constantine. While this did not make other Christian groups outside the adopted definition illegal, dissenting Arian bishops were initially exiled. But Constantine reinstated Arius just before the heresiarch died in 336 and exiled the Orthodox Athanasius of Alexandria from 335 to 337. In 380 Emperor Theodosius I made Christianity the Roman Empire&#x27;s official religion (see State church of the Roman Empire). In 392 Theodosius passed legislation prohibiting all pagan cultic worship.

During the 4th century, however, there was no real unity between church and state: in the course of the Arian controversy, Arian or semi-Arian emperors exiled leading Trinitarian bishops, such as Athanasius (335, 339, 356, 362, 365), Hilary of Poitiers (356), and Gregory of Nyssa (374); just as leading Arian and Anomoean theologians such as Aëtius (fl. 350) also suffered exile.

Towards the end of the century, Bishop Ambrose of Milan made the powerful Emperor Theodosius I (reigned 379–395) do penance for several months after the massacre of Thessalonica (390) before admitting him again to the Eucharist. On the other hand, only a few years later, Chrysostom, who as bishop of Constantinople criticized the excesses of the royal court, was eventually banished (403) and died (407) while traveling to his place of exile.

==Theological implications==
Critics of state-aligned Christianity often point to the ascension of Constantine as the beginning of Caesaropapism: according to this critique, the official Christianity of the Roman state rapidly became a religious and metaphysical justification for the existence, exercise, and expansion of worldly political power, ultimately facilitating earthly Christian empire both for Rome and its successors across Christendom. Similar criticisms are levied by Christian anarchists, who claim that the Constantinian shift triggered the Great Apostasy by transforming the religion into a means for preserving the ruling elite&#x27;s power and justifying violence.

Augustine of Hippo, who originally had rejected violence in religious matters, later justified it theologically against those he considered heretics, such as the Donatists, who themselves violently harassed their opponents. Before him, Athanasius believed that violence was justified in weeding out heresies that could damn all future Christians. He felt that any means was justified in repressing Arian belief. In 385, Priscillian, a bishop in Spain, was the first Christian to be executed for heresy, though the most prominent church leaders rejected this verdict.

Theologians critical of the Constantinian shift also see it as the point at which membership in the Christian church became associated with a social concept of citizenship, rather than reflecting one&#x27;s internal decisions and feelings. American theologian Stanley Hauerwas notes the shift as forming part of the foundation for the contemporary American conception of Christianity, one that is closely associated with patriotism and civil religion.

<doc id="711668" wikidata="Q5282031" url="?curid=711668" title="Discrepancy function">
<text>In structural equation modeling, a discrepancy function is a mathematical function which describes how closely a structural model conforms to observed data; it is a measure of goodness of fit. Larger values of the discrepancy function indicate a poor fit of the model to data. In general, the parameter estimates for a given model are chosen so as to make the discrepancy function for that model as small as possible. Analogous concepts in statistics are known as goodness of fit or statistical distance, and include deviance and divergence.

==Examples==
There are several basic types of discrepancy functions, including maximum likelihood (ML), generalized least squares (GLS), and ordinary least squares (OLS), which are considered the &quot;classical&quot; discrepancy functions. Discrepancy functions all meet the following basic criteria:

*They are non-negative, i.e., always greater than or equal to zero. 
*They are zero only if the fit is perfect, i.e., if the model and parameter estimates perfectly reproduce the observed data. 
*The discrepancy function is a continuous function of the elements of S, the sample covariance matrix, and Σ(θ), the &quot;reproduced&quot; estimate of S obtained by using the parameter estimates and the structural model.

In order for &quot;maximum likelihood&quot; to meet the first criterion, it is used in a revised form as the deviance.

<text>Mahammad Amin Akhund Haji Molla Alakbar oghlu Rasulzade (31 January 1884 – 6 March 1955) was an Azerbaijani politician, journalist and the head of the Azerbaijani National Council. He is mainly considered the founder of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in 1918 and the father of its statehood. His expression &quot;&quot; (&quot;The flag once raised shall never fall!&quot;) became the motto of the independence movement in Azerbaijan in the early 20th century.

==Early life==

Born on 31 January 1884 to Akhund Haji Molla Alakbar Rasulzadeh in Novkhany, near Baku, Mahammad Amin Rasulzade received his education at the Russian-Muslim Secondary School and then at the Technical College in Baku. In his years of study he created &quot;&quot;Muslim Youth Organisation Musavat&quot;,&quot; first secret organisation in Azerbaijan&#x27;s contemporary history, and beginning from 1903 Rasulzade began writing articles in various opposition newspapers and magazines. At that time, his anti-monarchist platform and his demands for the national autonomy of Azerbaijan, aligned him with Social Democrats and future Communists. In 1904 he founded the first Muslim social-democrat organisation &quot;Hummet&quot; and became editor-in-chief of its newspapers, &quot;Takamul&quot; (1906–1907) and &quot;Yoldash&quot; (1907). Rasulzade also published many articles in non-partisan newspapers such as &quot;Hayat&quot;, &quot;Irshad&quot;, and the journal &quot;Fuyuzat&quot;. His dramatic play titled &quot;The Lights in the Darkness&quot; was staged in Baku in 1908.

Rasulzade and his co-workers were representatives of the Azerbaijani intelligentsia. Most of them, including Rasulzade himself, had been members of the Baku organization of the Russian Social-Democratic Workers&#x27; Party (Bolsheviks) in 1905. A photograph is extant in Soviet archives, showing Rasulzade with Prokopius Dzhaparidze and Meshadi Azizbekov, Bolsheviks who later became famous as two of the 26 Baku Commissars shot during the civil war. During the First Russian Revolution (1905–1907), Rasulzade actively participated in revolutionary developments. As the story goes, it was Rasulzade who saved young Joseph Stalin in 1905 in Baku, when police were searching for the latter as an active instigator of riots.

In 1909, under the persecution from Tsarist authorities, Rasulzade fled Baku to participate in the Iranian Constitutional Revolution of 1905–1911. While in Iran, Rasulzade edited &quot;Iran-e Azad&quot; newspaper, became one of the founders of Democrat Party of Persia and began publishing its newspaper Iran-e Now which means &quot;New Iran&quot; and which has been described as &quot;the greatest, most important and best known of the Persian newspapers, and the first to appear in the large size usual in Europe&quot;. In 1911, Rasulzade also published his book &quot;Saadet-e bashar&quot; (&quot;Happiness of Mankind&quot;) in defense of the revolution. Rasulzade was fluent in Persian.

After Russian troops entered Iran in 1911 and, in cooperation with British, assisted Qajar Court to put an end to Iranian Constitutional Revolution, Rasulzade fled to Istanbul, then capital of Ottoman Empire. Here, in the wake of Young Turk Revolution, Rasulzade founded a journal called &quot;Türk Yurdu&quot; (&quot;The Land of Turks&quot;), in which he published his famous article &quot;İran Türkleri&quot; about the Iranian Turks.

== The Musavat Party and Azerbaijan Democratic Republic ==

After the Amnesty Act of 1913, dedicated to the 300th anniversary of the Romanov dynasty, Rasulzade returned to Baku, left the Hummet party he was previously member of, and joined the then secret Musavat (Equality) party in 1913, established in 1911, which initially promoted pan-Islamist, pan-Turkist and Socialist ideas, or more precisely Pan-Islamism yet with affinity for greater cultural bonds with the Turkic world, and which eventually became Azerbaijani nationalist party, and quickly became its chief. In 1915 he started to publish the party&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Açıq Söz&quot; (Open word) which lasted until 1918. When the February Revolution happened, Musavat together with other secret political parties in the Russian Empire, were quickly legalized and became a leading party of Caucasian Muslims after it merged with Party of Turkic Federalists headed by Nasib Yusifbeyli. The October Revolution in 1917 lead to the secession of Transcaucasia from Russia and Rasulzade became head of Muslim faction in the Seym, the parliament of the Transcaucasian Federation. After the dissolution of the Transcaucasian Federation, the Muslim faction re-organized into the Azerbaijani National Council, whose head Rasulzade was unanimously elected in May 1918.

On 28 May 1918 the Azerbaijani National Council, headed by Rasulzade, declared an independent Azerbaijan Republic. Rasulzade also initiated the establishment of Baku State University together with Rashid Khan Gaplanov, minister of education with the funding of oil baron Haji Zeynalabdin Taghiyev in 1919. Rasulzade taught Ottoman literature at the university.

After the collapse of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in April 1920, Rasulzade left Baku and went into hiding in the mountainous village of Lahıc, Ismailli to direct the resistance to Sovietization. But in August 1920, after the Soviet Russian army crushed the rebellions of Ganja, Karabakh, Zagatala and Lankaran, led by ex-officers of the Azerbaijani National Army, Rasulzade was arrested and brought to Baku. It was only due to an earlier rescue of Joseph Stalin, as Rasulzade hid Stalin from the police, that Rasulzade was released and transferred from Azerbaijan to Russia. For the next two years, Rasulzade worked as the press representative at the Commissariat on Nations in Moscow. He was seconded to Saint Petersburg in 1922 from where he escaped to Finland.

==Exile==
For the rest of his life, Rasulzade lived in exile first in Turkey. Between 1923 and 1927, he was an editor-in-chief of the magazine called &quot;Yeni Kafkasya&quot; (Turkish: &quot;New Caucasus&quot;) which was suspended by the Kemalist government by the request of Moscow. Rasulzade continued to publish various articles, newspapers, and magazines from 1928 until 1931 in Turkey. However, the 1931 suppression of the emigre publications coincided with Rasulzade&#x27;s expulsion from Turkey, and some saw it as the result of caving in to Soviet pressure. In exile Rasulzade published a pamphlet titled &quot;O Pantiurkizme v sviazi s kavkazskoi problemoi&quot; (&quot;О Пантюркизме в связи с кавказской проблемой&quot;, Pan-Turkism with regard to the Caucasian problem), in which he firmly stated his view: Pan-Turkism was a cultural movement rather than a political program. Thus, he went to Poland in 1938, where he met his wife, Wanda, niece of Polish statesman Józef Piłsudski, then to Romania in 1940.

During his exile in 1942, Rasulzade was contacted by the leadership of Nazi Germany, who, when forming national legions from representatives of the peoples of the Soviet Union, relied on well-known and authoritative representatives, such as Rasulzade and other leaders of the 1918 Caucasian republics. Hitler tried to recruit Rasulzade as a leader of a German-occupied Caucasus. Rasulzade was convinced of the close connection between Musavatism and Nazism. He noted that the social program of the Musavat party was of a national socialist nature. During a meeting with the German leadership in May 1942, Rasulzade attempted to form a strategic alliance with Nazi Germany in order to restore Azerbaijan&#x27;s independence. Rasulzade demanded that Nazi Germany announce its absolute commitment to the restoration of the Transcaucasian states, however, due to the evasive nature of the Reich in the conversation, he left Berlin.

Finally, after World War II, he went back to Ankara, Turkey in 1947, where he participated in the politics of the marginal Pan Turkic movement. Due to sensitivity of his presence in either Turkey or Iran, and being often exiled, Rasulzade &quot;cherished bad memories of both Iran and Turkey&quot;. In his appeal to Azerbaijani people in 1953 through Voice of America, he stressed his hope that one day it will become independent again. He died in 1955, a broken man according to Thomas Goltz, and was buried in Cebeci Asri cemetery in Ankara.

==Legacy and honors==


Rasulzade was commemorated by many memorials throughout Azerbaijan, such as Baku State University, which was named after his honor. Rasulzade was depicted on the obverse of the Azerbaijani 1000 manat banknote of 1993–2006.

The Mehmet Emin Resulzade Anatolian High School was named after him and is a public high school at Ankara, Turkey.

<text>The Soviet Union was a charter member of the United Nations and one of five permanent members of the Security Council. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, its UN seat was transferred to the Russian Federation, the continuator state of the USSR (see Succession, continuity and legacy of the Soviet Union).

== Role in the founding of the United Nations ==
The Soviet Union took an active role in the United Nations and other major international and regional organizations. At the behest of the United States, the Soviet Union took a role in the establishment of the United Nations in 1945. Soviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin was initially hesitant to join the group, although Soviet delegates helped create the structure of the United Nations at the Tehran Conference and the Dumbarton Oaks Conference. US President Franklin D. Roosevelt actively worked to convince Stalin to join the UN. The Soviet Union insisted that there be veto rights in the Security Council and that alterations in the United Nations Charter be unanimously approved by the five permanent members.

There was initially a Western majority in the United Nations immediately after its creation. With the decolonization process, however, and as all newly independent states were accepted into the United Nations, many countries allied with the Soviet Union, as well as non-aligned countries, joined the organization.

The USSR initially protested the membership of the Philippines and British India, whose independence was then largely theoretical. A demand by the Soviet Union that all then fifteen Soviet republics be recognized as member states in the UN was counter-demanded by the United States that all then 48 US states be similarly recognized. Ultimately, at the Yalta Conference a compromise was made in which two Soviet republics (Ukrainian SSR and Byelorussian SSR) were admitted as full members of the United Nations. As such, between 1945 and 1991, the Soviet Union was represented by three seats in the United Nations. This was supported by British Foreign Minister Anthony Eden so that, in return, British India would have its own seat in the United Nations, as it had in the League of Nations before it. Roosevelt agreed at Eden&#x27;s insistence, despite the US State Department&#x27;s objection.

== Security Council and veto ==
The Soviet Union had cast its veto 109 times by 1973, out of a total 128 vetoes used by the council. Even with all the vetoes used not all stuck. It is shown that for 75 percent of the vetoes cast by the Soviet Union, further actions were taken by United Nations.

The Russians believed strongly in the veto power, and insisted it be part of the United Nations Security Council. They voiced this option for the veto power to both the Security Council and the General Assembly. The Soviet representative to the United Nation in 1950, Andrei Y. Vishinsky, declared that &quot;the veto power is the paramount principle, which constitutes the cornerstone of the United Nations.&quot; 

== Relationship with China ==
The debate over China&#x27;s representation with the United Nations began in 1949. The Chinese Communist Party took over the country&#x27;s mainland in the Chinese Civil War, while the Nationalists retreated to the island of Taiwan, which it had received from Japan following its surrender in 1945. The United Nations seat of China was held by the Nationalist government of the Republic of China and conflict quickly arose over which government should hold the China seat. The Soviet Union supported the Communist government of mainland China, leading to conflict with the West. The Security Council sided with the United States and deemed the Communist government of People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) to be illegitimate and denied their delegation from entering the United Nations until 1971 when China&#x27;s seat was transferred to the Communist government of PRC.

A major turning point in the Soviet Union relation occurred in January 1950, when Soviet representatives boycotted United Nations functions in protest over the occupation of the seat of China by the Republic of China. Yakov Malik was the sole Soviet representative that walked out of the United Nations, and announced that they would be boycotting further Security Council meetings. In the absence of the Soviet representatives, the United Nations Security Council was able to vote for the intervention of United Nations military forces in what would become the Korean War. This was a downside to the boycott that was unforeseeable to the Soviet Union at the time.

Nations questioned Soviet actions on relations with China, and how they acted on the issue of representation. The Soviet Union always voted for China&#x27;s Communist Party to have the seat.

== Relationship with the West ==
For many years, the West played a guiding role in United Nations deliberations, but by the 1960s many former colonies had been granted independence and had joined the United Nations. These states, which became the majority in the General Assembly and other bodies, were increasingly receptive to Soviet anti-imperialist appeals. By the 1970s, the United Nations deliberations had generally become increasingly hostile toward the West and toward the United States in particular, as evidenced by pro-Soviet and anti-American voting trends in the General Assembly.

Western media reported in 1987 that Eastern European and Asian communist countries that were allies or satellite states of the Soviet Union, had received more development assistance from the United Nations than what the Soviet Union had contributed. This contradicted communist states&#x27; rhetorical support for the United Nation&#x27;s establishment of a New International Economic Order, which would transfer wealth from the rich Northern Hemisphere to the poor Southern Hemisphere states. The Soviet Union announced in September 1987 that it would pay back a portion of its debt to the United Nations.

The Soviet Union did not, however, win support in the United Nations for its foreign policy positions. The Soviet Union and Third World states often argued that imperialism caused and continued to maintain the disparities in the world distribution of wealth. They disagreed, however, on the proper level of Soviet aid to the Third World. Also, the Soviet Union encountered fierce opposition to its invasion and occupation of Afghanistan and the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia and received little support (as evidenced by Third World abstentions) for its 1987 proposal on the creation of a &quot;Comprehensive System of International Peace and Security.&quot;

== Participation in special agencies ==
After walking out of the United Nations in January 1950 known as the Chinese Boycott, the Soviet Union returned to various United Nations bodies in August 1950. The return brought with it a beginning of a new policy of active participation on international and regional organizations. By the late 1980s the Soviet Union belonged to most of the special agencies of the United Nations. They did, however, resist joining various agricultural, food and humanitarian relief efforts.

During the Mikhail Gorbachev era, the Soviet Union made repeated suggestions for increasing United Nations involvement in the settlement of superpower and regional problems and conflicts. Though these proposals were not implemented, they constituted new initiatives in Soviet foreign policy and represented a break with the nature of past Soviet foreign policy. This lessened world tensions.

== Dissolution and succession by Russia ==
In the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union, 11 Soviet republics—all except the Baltic states and Georgia—signed the Alma-Ata Protocol on 21 December 1991, establishing the Commonwealth of Independent States and declaring that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist. The Protocol provided that the Russian Federation would assume Soviet Union&#x27;s United Nation membership, including its permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. The resignation of Soviet President Gorbachev on 25 December 1991 and the dissolution of the Soviet of the Republics the following day formalized the end of the Soviet Union.

On 24 December 1991, the Soviet Permanent Representative to the United Nations Yuli Vorontsov delivered to the Secretary-General of the United Nations a letter from the Russian President Boris Yeltsin. The letter stated that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist, and that Russia would continue the Soviet Union&#x27;s membership in the United Nations and maintain the full responsibility for all the rights and obligations of the Soviet Union under the United Nations Charter. The letter was circulated among the United Nations membership without any objection, and Russia formally took over the Soviet Union&#x27;s seat in the United Nations General Assembly, in the Security Council and in other organs of the United Nations. The letter also confirmed the credentials of Soviet representatives to represent Russia, and Soviet representatives to the various United Nations agencies continued serving as Russian representatives without presenting new credentials. Ambassador Vorontsov continued serving as the first Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations.

On 31 January 1992, Russian President Boris Yeltsin himself was in the Russian Federation&#x27;s seat in the Security Council during the &#x27;summit meeting&#x27; of the Council attended by heads of state and government.

<text>Back of the Y (also known as Back of the Y TV during series 1 and Back of the Y Masterpiece Television during series 2), is a cult New Zealand television series, created by Chris Stapp and Matt Heath. The show glorified stunts and the consumption of copious amounts of alcohol, and took its name from the Hollywood special episode, which featured Randy Campbell jumping off the back of the &quot;Y&quot; of the famous Hollywood Sign.

==Cast==
*Matt Heath as Danny Parker / Dick Johansonson
*Chris Stapp as Randy Cambell
*Phil Bruff as Spanners Watson
*Grubby as Prof. &quot;Crash&quot; Endicott
*Chris Winn as Wally Symons
*Matt Perkins as Skip Butler
*Piers Graham as Ray Smoodiver
*Melissa Goodfellow as Cindy Cockburn
*Emma Savonije as Communications Officer

==Concept and history==
&quot;Back of the Y&quot; is centred on a mock live TV show, featuring segments such as &quot;Randy Campbell&#x27;s Extreme Stunts&quot; and &quot;Cunstables&quot;. The show was low budget, and apparently filmed with amateur equipment and edited on home computers. A description of the show at the start of the first episode established the premise for the show, with reference to one of the characters: &quot;Phil Bruff had a dream. To make a New Zealand TV show that wasn&#x27;t complete shit. He failed... Miserably!!!&quot;

The second series consisted of seven episodes of &quot;Back of the Y Masterpiece Television&quot; and &quot;The Back of the Y Goes to Hollywood Special&quot; (2002).

In addition to New Zealand, the show was broadcast on MTV2 in the UK and on Channel V in Australia.

&quot;Back of the Y&quot; features the New Zealand band Deja Voodoo, originally a fictional house band. After &quot;Back of the Y&quot; Stapp and Heath developed Deja Voodoo into a real band.

In 2007, Stapp and Heath released &quot;The Devil Dared Me To (The Randy Campbell Story)&quot;, backed by Headstrong Productions, in association with the New Zealand Film Commission. The film tells the story of Randy Campbell, &quot;Back of the Y&quot;″s Stuntman character, and how he rose to become &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest stuntman&quot;. The film stars Chris Stapp as the titular Randy Campbell, and Matt Heath as Dick Johansonson as well as an all-New Zealand cast.

&quot;Back of the Y&quot; began shooting a third series from 24 September 2007 to 28 September 2007 at Henderson Valley Studios in Auckland.

The third series of the show was aired on C4 in New Zealand from 26 May 2008, it&#x27;s made up of six episodes and a making-of special.

==Regular features==
* &quot;Vaseline Warriors&quot;: a &quot;Mad Max&quot; parody set in a post-apocalyptic future where all women have been destroyed, and men fight over ripped up pornographic magazines and vaseline.

<doc id="711690" wikidata="Q1805491" url="?curid=711690" title="Lanhydrock House">
<text>Lanhydrock House, commonly known simply as Lanhydrock, is a country house and estate in the parish of Lanhydrock, Cornwall, UK.

The house stands in extensive grounds (360 hectares or 890 acres) above the River Fowey, and has been owned and managed by the National Trust since 1953. The house dates from the 1620s, however most of the interiors were reconstructed after a fire in 1881; a new service wing was built at the same time. It is a Grade I listed building and is set in gardens with formal areas. The hill behind the house is planted with a fine selection of shrubs and trees.

The parish church is dedicated to St Hydroc and stands in the grounds of Lanhydrock House. Parts date back to the late 15th century and the church has a chancel, nave, north and south aisles and three-stage battlemented tower with nine bells. Eight bells date from the late 19th century and are regularly rung. The ninth bell dates from circa 1599 and is only rung infrequently for tolling.



==Early history==
Lanhydrock estate belonged to the Augustinian priory of St Petroc at Bodmin but the Dissolution of the Monasteries during the 1530s saw it pass into private hands. In 1620 wealthy merchant Sir Richard Robartes, of Truro, acquired the estate and began building Lanhydrock House, designed to a four-sided layout around a central courtyard and constructed of grey granite. Robartes died in 1624 but work on the building was continued by his son John Robartes, 1st Earl of Radnor, a notable public figure who served as Lord Privy Seal and Lord President of the Council. The embattled walls were built of rude (rough), massive granite blocks with years 1636 and 1642 on the walls, indicating when they were built. A barbican gate was added and the house was garrisoned by Parliamentary forces in August 1644 when Sir Richard Grenville, 1st Baronet took possession.

==Agar-Robartes==
Most of the current building dates from late Victorian times, when the estate came under the ownership of the Agar-Robartes family.

Henry Robartes, 3rd Earl of Radnor (c. 1695–1741), was succeeded as Earl of Radnor by a cousin, but decided to separate the estate from the peerages by leaving it to a son of his sister Mary. By the late 18th century it had passed to Anna Maria Hunt (1771–1861) of Mayfair, London, the great-niece of the third Earl. In 1804 she married Charles Bagenal Agar, the youngest son of Irish peer James Agar, 1st Viscount Clifden. The couple had three children, but by 1818 not only had her husband died, but also her eldest and youngest sons. Resultantly, over the next fifty years of widowhood, although mainly an absentee landlord – she preferred the social life of London – she was known to be a conscientious, benevolent, and charitable landlord and employer, who greatly improved the estate. On the death of his mother in 1822, her surviving middle son Thomas Agar took up residence at Lanhydrock and adopted the Robartes name by royal warrant. Agar-Robartes was returned to Parliament for Cornwall East in 1847, a seat he held until 1868. In 1869 the barony of Robartes held by his mother&#x27;s ancestors was revived when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Robartes of Lanhydrock and of Truro in the County of Cornwall. By 1872 Lord Robartes of Lanhydrock was listed among the top ten landowners in Cornwall, with estates of or 2.93% of Cornwall.

Agar-Robartes had the east wing of the house demolished, leaving the U-shaped plan seen today. In 1880 he commissioned the architect George Gilbert Scott to renovate Lanhydrock House. On 4 April 1881 a major fire destroyed the south wing and caused extensive damage to the central section. The fire started in the kitchen, and a near gale-force wind fanned the flames along the south wing and the ″communicating block″. Of the main house only the north wing, with its Long Gallery, and the front porch building survived intact, along with the original gatehouse, which dates from the mid-17th century. The gallery was decorated with old plaster work which was considered to be the finest of its type in the west of England with figures representing the creation in ″bas-relief″. The property was insured for £10,000 in the Royal Standard Office and for £10,000 in the County Fire Office, and the damage is estimated to have cost £8,000 to £10,000 It was reported in August 1881 that the rebuilding of the house would cost £50,000 and was to be undertaken by Messers Lang and Son of Liskeard. New sections were built behind the south wing, including a kitchen block, in the style of the original building – which was unusual at the time. Agar-Robartes’s wife died five days after the fire of smoke inhalation, and he died twelve months later, reported to be of a broken heart.

Their only son, Thomas Charles Agar-Robartes, inherited the estate. Having been called to the Bar in 1870, in 1880 Agar-Robartes was returned to Parliament as one of two representatives for Cornwall East. He appointed a local architect, Richard Coad – who had worked as an assistant to George Gilbert Scott – to design and supervise the construction of a high-Victorian house from the previous adaptions of the Jacobean house his father had planned. After renovations on the house were completed, Agar-Robartes moved his family there about 1885. Agar-Robartes entered the House of Lords on the death of his father in 1882, and on 10 September 1899 succeeded his kinsman as Viscount Clifden. In 1891, as chairman of the Agar-Robartes Bank, he took over the ownership of Wimpole Hall, the largest house in Cambridgeshire. Moving his family home there, he later served as Lord-Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire from 1906 to 1915.

The Robartes family suffered great losses during the First World War, including the heir Thomas Agar-Robartes, who was killed during the Battle of Loos in France, while trying to rescue a colleague from no-man&#x27;s land. As Agar-Robartes was unmarried, his younger brother Francis later succeeded their father.

==Antiquities==

Arthur Langdon (1896) recorded two Cornish crosses and two cross bases (at Tredinnick Cross and Reperry) in the parish. One cross is in the churchyard and the other is half a cross head at Treffry. The cross in the churchyard is ornamented on all four sides of the shaft. In addition to these there is a cross called Bodwen Cross; this cross was recorded in 1850 but was not mentioned by J. T. Blight or Arthur Langdon. It was found again in 1937 near Helman Tor in the parish of Lanlivery. It was taken from there and erected in the new cemetery at Lanhydrock. A request for it to be returned to Lanlivery to a site on the Saints&#x27; Way was refused.

==Lanhydrock Estate Company==
In 1934, to manage income taxes and death duties, the entire Cornish landholdings of the Agar-Robartes family were incorporated into the Lanhydrock Estate Company. In 1953, faced with crippling death duties through a lack of his own children, the 7th Viscount Clifden gave the house and approximately of parkland to the National Trust. This allowed the preservation of the house and its extensive Victorian collections, and, by agreement with the Inland Revenue, payment in kind of death duties, allowing the residual Lanhydrock Estate Company to pass into the hands of the wider family.

On the death of the 7th Viscount, the titles and control of the company passed to his youngest brother Arthur Agar-Robartes, 8th Viscount Clifden. Lord Clifden died in December 1974, and in a similar death duty exchange with HM Revenue, added 298 acres during the 1970s to the National Trust&#x27;s estate holdings. He had married Patience Mary Basset in 1920 but died without male issue, and upon his death all his titles, with the exception of the barony of Mendip (which the 6th Earl of Normanton succeeded) became extinct. His daughter Rachel married Captain Cromwell Lloyd-Davies in 1941, and they had a daughter Ann Lloyd-Davies (1942–present). In 1964 she married Colin Williams; they and their three children now control the company.

As of 2020 the company owns and controls 2,500 acres of land, and is by descent controlled by the Williams family.

==House and gardens today==
Today, the public tour of Lanhydrock house is one of the longest of any National Trust house. It takes in the service rooms, nurseries and some servants&#x27; bedrooms, as well as the main reception rooms and family bedrooms. In 2004 it was one of the Trust&#x27;s ten most visited paid-entry properties, with over 200,000 visitors.

Parts of the estate have been designated as an Important Plant Area, by the organisation Plantlife, for its ancient woodland and lichens.

Lanhydrock was the main setting for a 1996 film version of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; directed by Trevor Nunn, and starring Helena Bonham Carter as Olivia. On 12 June 2008 Lanhydrock hosted an episode of BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;, which was first aired on 12 October 2008 (part 1) and 30 November 2008 (part 2).

<text>An outswinger is a type of delivery of the ball in the sport of cricket. In such a delivery the ball curves—or &quot;swings&quot;—out and away from the batter&#x27;s body and the wicket. By contrast, an inswinger swings in toward the batter and the wicket. Outswingers are bowled by swing bowlers.

The term has also been adopted into football commentary, in which context it describes a cross of the ball kicked so that it curves outward from and across the face of the goal, rather than on goal.

==Method==
An outswinger is bowled by holding the cricket ball with the seam at an angle and the first two fingers running along either side of the seam. The ball must be released at 12 o&#x27;clock height. The hands should move slightly towards the left at follow through and must push down for more back-spin. Once the ball has worn on one side the shiny side should face the leg side and the seam towards first or second slip for swing. The difference of pressure caused by movement of air over the rough and smooth surfaces tends to push the ball to the left. The result is that the ball curves, or &quot;swings&quot; to the left. In case of a new ball point the seam to the direction of swing. The difference of the separation of air by the seam the ball moves away from the batter.

==Advantages==
From a right-handed batter&#x27;s point of view, the swing is away from his body towards his right, i.e. towards the off side. This swing away from the body is the source of the name &quot;outswinger&quot;. To a left-handed batter, the swing is in towards the body and towards the leg side which from a technical point of view makes the outswinger, now an inswinger.

Outswingers may be considered to be one of the more difficult fast deliveries for a right-handed batter to play. This is because the ball moves away from his body. This means that any miscalculation can result in an outside edge off the bat and a catch going to the wicket-keeper or slips fielders.

==Tactical use==
To a right-handed batter, a fast bowler will generally concentrate on bowling repeated outswingers, aiming to tempt the batter to play away from his body and get him out in one of the ways described above. However, sometimes a fast bowler may attempt to deceive the batter by bowling an off cutter instead of a standard outswinger, and look to get a batter out either bowled or lbw. More commonly, variation is in the length of the ball, with yorkers and bouncers. An effective delivery length is one that places the ball approaching the top of the stumps; usually between two-thirds to three- quarters up the length of the pitch.

<text>Texas Instruments Graphics Architecture (TIGA) is a graphics interface standard created by Texas Instruments that defined the software interface to graphics processors. Using this standard, any software written for TIGA should work correctly on a TIGA-compliant graphics interface card.

The TIGA standard is independent of resolution and color depth which provides a certain degree of future proofing. This standard was designed for high-end graphics. However, TIGA was not widely adopted. Instead, VESA and Super VGA became the &quot;de facto&quot; standard for PC graphics devices after the VGA. Texas Instrument&#x27;s TMS34010 and TMS34020 Graphics System Processors (GSP) were the original TIGA-compliant graphics processors.

==Clone Hardware==
The primary manufacturers of mainstream TIGA cards for the PC clone market included Number Nine Visual Technology and Hercules. Number Nine Visual Technology graphics cards using Texas Instruments&#x27; TIGA co-processors were made from about 1986 to 1992, including the &quot;Pepper&quot; and &quot;GX&quot; series.&quot;&quot; Hercules manufactured cards such as the &quot;Graphics Station&quot; and &quot;Chrome&quot; lines which were marketed primarily toward users of Microsoft Windows.

Desktop Computing &quot;AGA 1024&quot; card was capable of emulating TIGA standards, besides IBM 8514.

In the early 1990s, Texas Instruments France (which had marketing control for TIGA architecture and GSP chipsets in Europe) experimented with manufacturing and selling its own range of consumer oriented video cards based on TIGA and aimed at speeding up the user experience of Windows. These products were named &quot;TIGA Diamond&quot; (34020 based) and &quot;TIGA Star&quot; (34010 based), and provided a platform for selling TI DRAM and video palette chips as well as the GSP chips themselves.

==Impact==
Despite the superiority of the technology in comparison to typical Super VGA cards of the era, the relatively high cost and emerging local bus graphics standards meant that IT distributors and PC manufacturers could not see a niche for these products at consumer level.

The (limited) success of the graphics cards paved the way for products based upon various derivatives and clones of IBM&#x27;s 8514 architecture. Part of the effort to make graphics accelerators useful required TI to convince Microsoft that the internal interfaces to its Windows Operating System had to be adaptable instead of hard-coded. Indeed, all versions of Windows prior to Windows 3.0 were &quot;hard-coded&quot; to specific graphics hardware.

<text>Stub Series Terminated Logic (SSTL) is a group of electrical standards for driving transmission lines commonly used with DRAM based DDR memory IC&#x27;s and memory modules. SSTL is primarily designed for driving the DDR (double-data-rate) SDRAM modules used in computer memory; however, it is also used in other applications, notably some PCI Express PHYs and other high-speed devices.

Four voltage levels for SSTL are defined:
*SSTL_3, 3.3 V, defined in EIA/JESD8-8 1996
*SSTL_2, 2.5 V, defined in EIA/JESD8-9B 2002 used in DDR among other things.
*SSTL_18, 1.8 V, defined in EIA/JESD8-15A, used in DDR2 among other things.
*SSTL_15, 1.5 V, used in DDR3 among other things.

SSTL_3 uses a reference of 0.45 * VDDQ (1.5 V). SSTL_2 and SSTL_18 reference a voltage that is exactly VDDQ / 2 (1.25 V and 0.9 V respectively).

SSTL_3 and SSTL_2 support two termination classes (50 ohm or 25 ohm load). SSTL_18 only supports one (25 ohm load).

<text>An inswinger is a type of delivery of the ball in the sport of cricket. In such a delivery the ball curves—or &quot;swings&quot;—in toward the batter&#x27;s body and the wicket. By contrast, an outswinger swings away from the line of the batter and the wicket. Inswingers are bowled by swing bowlers.

The term has also been adopted into football commentary, in which context it describes a cross of the ball kicked so that it curves in toward the goal.

==Grip==

An inswinger is bowled by holding the cricket ball with the seam vertical and the first two fingers slightly across the seam so that it is angled a little to the leg side. Once the ball has worn and been polished so that one side is rougher than the other, the rough side is placed on the leg side. The ball is placed on the pad of the thumb. This thumb position locks the wrist in a position inclined to the leg side.

==Back foot contact==

Inswing can be bowled from side-on, mid-way or chest on positions. But bowlers usually tend to pitch it in the good length spot or up to the batsman. It is the wrist position that is crucial, not the position of hips or shoulders. (See thumb position above).

==Point of release==

When the bowler delivers the ball, he angles the seam so that it points slightly to the leg side. To help achieve this position the bowling arm should be near vertical, brushing close to the ear. At release the wrist should remain cocked so as to help impart backspin along the orientation of the seam. The angle of the seam to the direction of motion produces an aerofoil effect as the ball moves through the air, pushing it to the leg side. This is enhanced by differential air pressure caused by movement of air over the rough and smooth surfaces, which also tends to push the ball to the leg side. The result is that the ball curves, or &quot;swings&quot; in to the batsman.

==Use of the inswinger==

Inswingers are not considered to be as difficult for a right-handed batsman to play as an outswinger. This is because the ball moves in towards his body, meaning that his body is often behind the line of the ball, and any miscalculated shot that is hit by the edge of the bat may be intercepted by his body rather than flying to a fielder for a catch.

Inswingers can, however, sneak between the bat and pad to hit the wicket and bowl the batsman out, or miss the bat and hit the pads for a leg before wicket. A particularly effective delivery is the inswinging yorker, which can cause a batsman to attempt to pull his feet out of the line of the ball, leaving him vulnerable to being bowled, or out lbw if he is too slow. Another deceptive type are those pitched around the off-stump that appear to be passing the batmen by but swing in wildly to knock the stumps off. In the final match of the 1983 World Cup, Balwinder Sandhu famously clean bowled Gordon Greenidge with an inswinger to which the batsman had shouldered arms.
Some famous bowlers to bowl inswingers include Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammad Asif, James Anderson, and Stuart Broad.

<text>Yuvan Shankar Raja (born 31 August 1979), is an Indian composer and playback singer. He mainly scores music for Tamil films along with few Telugu, Kannada, and Hindi films. Considered a versatile composer, he is particularly known for his use of Western music elements and often credited with having introduced hip hop to the Tamil film and music industry and started the &quot;era of remixes&quot; in Tamil Nadu which included mixed EDM and jazz. He is frequently referred to as the &quot;BGM King&quot; of Tamil Film Music. Yuvan has won two Filmfare Awards South, five Mirchi Music Awards South, three Vijay Awards and two Tamil Nadu State Film Awards.

Within a span of 25 years, Yuvan has worked on over 190 films. Being the youngest son of composer Ilaiyaraaja, he began his musical career in 1996, at the age of 16, when he composed the film score for &quot;Aravindhan&quot;. He got his breakthrough with the &quot;Thulluvadho Ilamai&quot; (2002) soundtrack, and established himself as one of Tamil cinema&#x27;s most sought-after composers by the mid-2000s. He won the Filmfare Award for Best Music Director – Tamil in 2004 for his score in the drama &quot;7G Rainbow Colony&quot;. In 2006, he became the only Indian composer to win the Cyprus International Film Festival Award for the soundtrack of &quot;Raam&quot;. He also won the Filmfare Special Award – South in 2009 for his Telugu musical &quot;Oy!&quot;.

In 2015, Yuvan created his own music label, U1 Records and in 2017, he started his own film production studio, YSR Films.

== Early life ==
Yuvan Shankar Raja was born on 31 August 1979. He is the third and youngest child of musician and film composer Ilaiyaraaja. He is the younger brother of music director Karthik Raja and playback singer-music director Bhavatharini. Yuvan once confessed that his brother Karthik Raja was more talented than him, but he did not get a successful break into the music business since he did not get a &quot;good team to work with&quot;. His father as well as his siblings have sung many songs under his direction. Film director and film composer Gangai Amaran and R. D. Bhaskar are his uncles and their sons Venkat Prabhu, Premgi Amaren and Parthi Bhaskar, who are working in the Tamil film industry as well, are his cousins.

Yuvan did his schooling at St. Bede&#x27;s Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School in Chennai, and discontinued his education after his tenth class. He started learning music from Jacob Master, attending piano classes at &quot;Musee Musical&quot; in Chennai, which is affiliated to Trinity College in London, UK.

Yuvan Shankar Raja stated that he always wanted to become a pilot and travel &quot;all around the world&quot;, but as he grew up &quot;with music around him&quot;, he eventually became a musician. He admires the work of his father and other composers such as S. D. Burman, R. D. Burman, M. S. Viswanathan and Naushad Ali and the voices of singers Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, P. B. Sreenivas, S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, and P. Susheela.

== Career ==

=== Film score and soundtracks ===

==== Early years (1997–2000) ====
In 1996, following his mother&#x27;s suggestion to take up music as a profession, Yuvan Shankar Raja started composing tunes for an album. T. Siva, the producer of the Tamil language film &quot;Aravindhan&quot;, after hearing some of the tunes, asked him to compose a trailer music score. As Siva was impressed by the music, he gave Yuvan Shankar the assignment to compose the entire film score, including a soundtrack for that film. After consulting and getting consent from his parents, he accepted the offer; his music career started. His entry into the Tamil film and music industry had happened at age 16, thus he became one of the youngest composers ever in the industry, which he says, was &quot;purely accidental&quot;.

However, both the soundtrack album as well as the film itself failed to attract audiences and do well, and Yuvan Shankar Raja&#x27;s following projects &quot;Velai&quot; (1998) and &quot;Kalyana Galatta&quot; (1998) were not successful either; his compositions for these films did not receive good reviews or responses, with one reviewer labelling the music and background score in the latter as &quot;cacophony&quot; and &quot;poor&quot;. The failures of his first projects meant that he was not offered any film projects and assignments subsequently. During this time of struggle, he was approached and assigned by director Vasanth to compose the music for his film &quot;Poovellam Kettuppar&quot; (1999). The soundtrack received a very positive response, being described as &quot;fresh&quot; and &quot;different&quot;, with a critic from &quot;The New Indian Express&quot; citing that his &quot;absolutely enchanting musical score [...] bears testimony to his &quot;Raja&quot; surname.&quot; The album became very popular, particularly songs such as &quot;Irava Pagala&quot; and &quot;Chudithar Aninthu&quot;, gaining him first time notice, especially among young people and children. The album would make possible his first breakthrough in the industry and proved to be a major turning point in his career. After working for two Sundar C films, &quot;Unakkaga Ellam Unakkaga&quot; (1999) and &quot;Rishi&quot; (2000), he got to work for A. R. Murugadoss&#x27;s directorial debut in 2000, the action flick &quot;Dheena&quot;, starring Ajith Kumar, which went on to become a blockbuster and Yuvan Shankar Raja&#x27;s first major successful film. Yuvan Shankar&#x27;s songs were equally successful, which are considered to have played a major role in the film&#x27;s great success, while his background score in the film was also well appreciated.

==== Rise to prominence (2001–2003) ====
In 2001, he had three album releases, the first being &quot;Thulluvadho Ilamai&quot;, collaborating with Selvaraghavan for the first time. The film was directed by Kasthuri Raja, but his son Selvaraghavan wrote the script and worked with Yuvan Shankar Raja for the film&#x27;s soundtrack album. The soundtrack album of &quot;Thulluvadho Ilamai&quot; particularly appealed to the younger generation. The film itself, marking the debut of Selvaraghavan&#x27;s brother Dhanush, released one year later and became a sleeper hit at the Chennai box office. This was followed by Bala&#x27;s &quot;Nandha&quot; (2001), for which he received rave reviews. He then gained notice by churning out &quot;youthful music&quot; in the college-life based &quot;April Maadhathil&quot; (2002), the romantic comedy films &quot;Kadhal Samrajyam&quot; (2002) (The film was never released theatrically, the soundtrack was released in 2002) and &quot;Mounam Pesiyadhe&quot; (2002), Ameer&#x27;s directorial debut film, and the triangular love story &quot;Punnagai Poove&quot; (2002), in which he also made his on-screen debut, appearing in some scenes and one song sequence. At the same time, he made his Telugu debut with &quot;Seshu&quot; and &quot;Malli Malli Chudali&quot; and also composed for the Tamil films &quot;Junior Senior&quot; and &quot;Pop Carn&quot;, starring Malayalam actors Mammootty and Mohanlal, respectively, though all of which performed poorly at the box office.

In 2003, Selvaraghavan&#x27;s first independent directorial, the drama-thriller film &quot;Kaadhal Kondein&quot; released, which is considered a milestone for Yuvan Shankar Raja. His work in the film, particularly his background score, was unanimously praised, leading to the release of a separate CD consisting of several film score pieces, à la &quot;Hollywood-style&quot;, which was reportedly the first film score CD release in India. Furthermore, the film went on to become a blockbuster, cementing the film&#x27;s lead artist Dhanush and Yuvan Shankar in the Tamil film and music industry. The same year, he worked in Vishnuvardhan&#x27;s debut film &quot;Kurumbu&quot;, which featured the first remix song in a Tamil film. By that time, in a career spanning less than a decade, Yuvan Shankar Raja had established himself as one of the leading and most-sought after music directors in the Tamil film industry, despite having worked predominantly with newcomers and in low-budget productions.

==== Peak Success (2004–2007) ====
Yuvan Shankar&#x27;s 2004 releases, &quot;7G Rainbow Colony&quot;, another Selvaraghavan film, and Silambarasan&#x27;s &quot;Manmadhan&quot;, were both critically and commercially successful films, featuring acclaimed as well as popular music by Yuvan Shankar Raja, which also contributed to the films&#x27; successes. His work in the former, in particular, got critically acclaimed and eventually led him to win the Best Music Direction Award at the 2004 Filmfare Awards South; receiving the award at the age of 25, he was the youngest winning music composer of the award at that time. For the next several years, he would have nine to ten releases every year on average, making him one of the most prolific film composers of India.

His first of nine album releases of 2005 was &quot;Raam&quot;. His score for the Ameer-directed thriller, labelled as &quot;soul-stirring&quot;, fetched him further accolades and eventually yielded a win at the 2006 Cyprus International Film Festival for Best Musical score in a Feature Film, the first such award for an Indian composer. His successful streak continued with his following releases of that year, the low-budget films &quot;Arinthum Ariyamalum&quot;, &quot;Kanda Naal Mudhal&quot; and &quot;Sandakozhi&quot; becoming successful ventures at the box office; Yuvan Shankar&#x27;s songs, &quot;Theepidikka&quot;, &quot;Panithuli&quot; and &quot;Dhavani Potta&quot; from the respective soundtracks enjoyed popularity and were said to have played an important role in the films&#x27;s successes. After the release of the soundtrack for the S. J. Suryah-starring romantic comedy &quot;Kalvanin Kadhali&quot;, that also enjoyed popularity after the film&#x27;s release, his final album of 2005, &quot;Pudhupettai&quot;, released, which saw him once again collaborating with director Selvaraghavan. The ten-track experimental album, receiving high critical acclaim, was considered Yuvan Shankar Raja&#x27;s finest work till then and a &quot;musical masterpiece&quot;. The soundtrack and score of the film featured a traditional orchestral score played by the &quot;Chapraya Symphony&quot; of Bangkok, for the first time in a Tamil film. Critics felt that this project, in particular, proved his abilities and talent to produce innovative and experimental scores as well. The film itself, releasing only in May 2006, did average business, despite opening to outstanding reviews.

He next worked on the romantic comedies &quot;Happy&quot; and &quot;Azhagai Irukkirai Bayamai Irukkirathu&quot; and the gangster film &quot;Pattiyal&quot;, which all released in early 2006. His &quot;Happy&quot; songs and score received positive reviews, with critics labelling the &quot;youthful music&quot; as &quot;excellent&quot;, and the film&#x27;s &quot;main strength&quot;, while his score for &quot;Pattiyal&quot; was highly praised by critics; a &quot;Sify&quot; reviewer wrote: &quot;Yuvan Shankar Raja&#x27;s music and background score is the life of the film&quot;. Furthermore, both films went on to become very successful ventures, both commercially and critically. His subsequent releases that year include Silambarasan&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Vallavan&quot; and the action entertainer &quot;Thimiru&quot;. Yuvan Shankar Raja was cited as the &quot;real hero&quot; of the former, which featured some of the year&#x27;s most listened-to tracks such as &quot;Loosu Penne&quot; and &quot;Yammadi Aathadi&quot;, while the latter film ranked amongst the year&#x27;s highest-grossing films. In November 2006, the &quot;Paruthiveeran&quot; soundtrack album got released, which saw the composer foraying into pure rural folk music, using traditional musical instruments. Though initially releasing to mixed reviews, with critics doubting whether the songs could attract a modern youth audience, his first attempt at rural music turned out to be a major success, following the film&#x27;s outstanding run at the box office. The film, Ameer&#x27;s third feature film as well as Karthi&#x27;s debut venture, received universal critical acclaim after its release in February 2007 and became a blockbuster, while particularly the song &quot;Oororam Puliyamaram&quot; was a chartbuster number in Tamil Nadu.

In 2007, he had a record ten album releases in one year. The first was the soundtrack of the romantic drama film &quot;Deepavali&quot;, following which the audios of the sports comedy film &quot;Chennai 600028&quot;, the Telugu family entertainer &quot;Aadavari Matalaku Ardhalu Verule&quot;, Vasanth&#x27;s thriller film &quot;Satham Podathey&quot; and the romantic films &quot;Thottal Poo Malarum&quot; and &quot;Kannamoochi Yenada&quot; released, with the former three being well-received besides garnering positive reviews. The films &quot;Chennai 600028&quot;, Venkat Prabhu&#x27;s directorial debut, and &quot;Aadavari Matalaku Ardhalu Verule&quot;, Selvaraghavan&#x27;s Telugu debut, in particular, were great commercial successes and became some of the year&#x27;s most successful films in Tamil and Telugu, respectively. In late 2007, the film &quot;Kattradhu Thamizh&quot; and its soundtrack got released. The soundtrack album, which was released as &quot;Tamil M. A.&quot;, as well as the film itself, had been met with positive reviews and critical acclaim. The music was called a &quot;musical sensation&quot; and was noted to be a &quot;proof&quot; of Yuvan Shankar Raja&#x27;s &quot;composing skills&quot;. However, despite positive reviews by critics, the film failed to evoke the interest of the audience and did not enjoy much popularity. His final release of 2007 was &quot;Billa&quot;, a remake of the 1980 Rajinikanth-starrer of the same title. This film, remade by Vishnuvardhan, starring Ajith Kumar in the title role, also featured two remixes from the original version. The film emerged one of the top-grossers of the year, while also fetching positive reviews for Yuvan Shankar&#x27;s stylish musical score.

==== More achievements (2008–2012) ====
In 2008, five films, featuring Yuvan&#x27;s music were released, two of them being the Tamil and Kannada remakes of &quot;Aadavari Matalaku Ardhalu Verule&quot;, titled &quot;Yaaradi Nee Mohini&quot; and &quot;Anthu Inthu Preethi Banthu&quot;, respectively, which partly featured the original score and songs. The Tamil version, in particular, was able to repeat the success of the original film, emerging as a high commercial success, while yielding Yuvan his second Filmfare nomination. The other releases that year include Seeman&#x27;s &quot;Vaazhthugal&quot;, Venkat Prabhu&#x27;s comedy-thriller &quot;Saroja&quot;, Ajith Kumar&#x27;s action thriller &quot;Aegan&quot; and Silambarasan&#x27;s masala flick &quot;Silambattam&quot;, out of which, &quot;Saroja&quot; and &quot;Silambattam&quot; proved to be successful at the box office, with Yuvan Shankar&#x27;s score in the former and his songs in the latter garnering accolades and several awards at the 2009 Isaiyaruvi Tamil Music Awards. In 2009, nine of his soundtrack albums released. Excluding the romantic comedy &quot;Siva Manasula Sakthi&quot;, featuring his most popular song of the year &quot;Oru Kal Oru Kannadi&quot;, all other films failed at the box office. Besides &quot;Oru Kal&quot;, the songs &quot;Siragual&quot; (&quot;Sarvam&quot;) and &quot;Aedho Saigiral&quot; (&quot;Vaamanan&quot;) also became popular. He had provided a rural score again in &quot;Kunguma Poovum Konjum Puravum&quot; and a sarangi-based score for the urban action drama of Ameer&#x27;s &quot;Yogi&quot;. His score for his Telugu romantic musical &quot;Oy!&quot; fetched him the Special Jury Award at the 2010 South Filmfare Awards.

In late 2009, the soundtrack album of &quot;Paiyaa&quot; released, which was regarded as a &quot;blockbuster album&quot; and a &quot;magnum opus&quot;, as it went on to become highly popular, much prior to the film&#x27;s release, and one of Yuvan Shankar Raja&#x27;s biggest successes of his career. The song &quot;Thuli Thuli&quot; had become the first Tamil song to be featured in the India Top 20 list for April 2010, indicating that it was the most frequently played Tamil song on all Indian FM radio stations in the history of Tamil film music. The film itself became one of the highest earners of the year, particularly supported by Yuvan&#x27;s score and songs. Along with &quot;Paiyaa&quot;, songs from three more films for which he composed music that year – &quot;Naan Mahaan Alla&quot;, &quot;Baana Kaathadi&quot; and &quot;Boss Engira Bhaskaran&quot; – featured among the Top 10 chartbusters of the year. In early 2010, he composed his first Bollywood song; &quot;Haq Se&quot;, as part of the ensemble soundtrack of the film &quot;Striker&quot;, starring his close friend Siddharth, which received thoroughly positive reviews. In 2011, he teamed up with Silambarasan again for the anthology film &quot;Vaanam&quot;, with the song &quot;Evan Di Unna Pethan&quot; from the album, that was released as a single, gaining popularity. His next film was Bala&#x27;s &quot;Avan Ivan&quot;; Yuvan&#x27;s songs generally fetched positive reviews. He next composed a score that drew influence from several world music styles for the critically acclaimed independent gangster film &quot;Aaranya Kaandam&quot;, winning high praise from critics. He went on to work in Venkat Prabhu&#x27;s action thriller &quot;Mankatha&quot;, his biggest project till date, and Vishnuvardhan&#x27;s first Telugu venture &quot;Panjaa&quot;. His last two releases of 2011 were the soundtrack albums to the action-masala films &quot;Rajapattai&quot; and &quot;Vettai&quot;, both of which received mixed responses and failed to reach success. His 2012 works include &quot;Billa II&quot;, starring Ajith Kumar, Ameer&#x27;s long-delayed &quot;Aadhi Bhagavan&quot; and Vasanth&#x27;s &quot;Moondru Per Moondru Kadhal&quot;.

Critics have noted that Yuvan Shankar Raja&#x27;s music has a &quot;youthful character to it&quot;, with his compositions in particular appealing to the younger generation.

Yuvan Shankar Raja started the &quot;era of remixes&quot;; &quot;Aasai Nooru Vagai&quot; from &quot;Kurumbu&quot; (2004) is considered as the first remix in a Tamil film, following which several composers began remixing Tamil film songs from the 1970s and 80s. He has experimented with the fusion of old songs with his own original compositions, mixing and incorporating parts of them into his songs, e.g., &quot;Theepidikka&quot; from &quot;Arinthum Ariyamalum&quot; (2005) and &quot;Enga Area&quot; from &quot;Pudhupettai&quot; (2005). In 2010, he and his friend and fellow actor Silambarasan released the song &quot;Evan Di Unna Pethan&quot; from the film &quot;Vaanam&quot; (2011) as a single, which generated the trend of releasing single tracks from film soundtracks in Tamil cinema several months prior to the actual release, although the first single in Tamil cinema had been released in 2001 already.

== Frequent collaborations ==
Yuvan Shankar Raja has always been a go-to composer for filmmakers like Selvaraghavan, Ameer, Vishnuvardhan, Venkat Prabhu, Ram, Lingusamy and Thiagarajan Kumararaja. 

Likewise, he has often worked with legendary Tamil poet Vaali and young Tamil lyricists including Na. Muthukumar, Pa. Vijay, Snehan, and Madhan Karky. Additionally, he has worked with Vairamuthu, Thamarai, and Kabilan.
Among these partnerships, Yuvan’s bond with Na. Muthukumar stands out as one of Tamil cinema’s most cherished composer-lyricist duos. Their works brought together Yuvan’s soul-stirring compositions and Muthukumar’s poignant lyrics, creating songs that resonate deeply with fans, even years after their release. 

He is also known for his frequent collaboration with film&#x27;s featuring Silambarasan, Suriya, Vishal, Karthi and Ajith Kumar in the lead roles.

== Personal life ==
Yuvan Shankar Raja married his girlfriend Sujaya Chandran on 21 March 2005, at the Mayor Sri Ramanathan Chettiyar Hall in Chennai, India. Yuvan had met her in 2002 as a fan at a music cultural program in London and both fell in love later. Sujaya was a London-based singer and the daughter of Dr. C. R. Velayutham and Dr. Sarojini Chandran. They had a secret registered marriage in September 2003 in London, before the formal public wedding was held in 2005 with the consent of their parents. In August 2007, they filed for divorce with mutual consent, which was granted in February 2008, after 6 months. The reason for the divorce was cited to be &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot;.

On 1 September 2011, he married Shilpa at the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple, Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh. The marriage was held in a simple ceremony with only family members and close friends being present. Shilpa was revealed to be a B.Pharm graduate from Australia. A wedding reception was arranged a day later in Chennai. Later they divorced.

In 2014, Yuvan announced that he had converted to Islam. He legally changed his name to Abdul Haliq, but continues to use his original name professionally. On 1 January 2015, he got married for the third time to Zafroon Nisa. Yuvan and his wife had a baby girl on 7 April 2016.

<doc id="711709" wikidata="Q3825514" url="?curid=711709" title="Fishing fleet">
<text>A fishing fleet is an aggregate of commercial fishing vessels. The term may be used of all vessels operating out of a particular port, all vessels engaged in a particular type of fishing (as in the &quot;tuna fishing fleet&quot;), or all fishing vessels of a country or region.

Although fishing vessels are not formally organized as if they were a naval fleet, very often the constraints of time and weather are such that they must all leave or return together, thus creating at least the appearance of an organized body (some countries, such as the former Soviet Union, did however organise their fishing fleets partially along naval lines and used the ships to also gather naval intelligence).

Fishermen operating a particular type of vessel or in a particular port often belong to a local association which disseminates information and may be used to coordinate activities, such as how best to prevent overfishing in particular areas.

==World fishing fleet==
In 2002 the world fishing fleet numbered about four million vessels. About one-third were decked. The remaining undecked boats were generally less than 10 metres long, and 65 percent were not fitted with mechanical propulsion systems. The FAO estimates that Asia accounts for over 80 percent of them.

The average size of decked vessels is about 20 gross tons (10–15 metres). Only one percent of the world fishing fleet is larger than 100 gross tons (longer than 24 metres). China has half (25,600) of these larger vessels.

There is no international instrument in force concerning the safety of fishing vessels. International conventions and agreements awaiting ratification which concern safety at sea are almost exclusively aimed at vessels 24 metres in length and over, and therefore do not apply to artisan vessels in developing countries. Safety regulations for all fishing vessels are left almost entirely to national discretion.

== Other uses==
The fishing fleet was an ironic reference to the shipping of unmarried young women from the UK to India during the middle and latter years of the Raj, for the purposes of becoming married to colonial administrators, officers and plantation supervisors.,

<text>High-speed transceiver logic or HSTL is a technology-independent standard for signaling between integrated circuits. The nominal signaling range is 0 V to 1.5 V, though variations are allowed, and signals may be single-ended or differential. It is designed for operation beyond 180 MHz.

The following classes are defined by standard EIA/JESD8-6 from EIA/JEDEC:
*Class I (unterminated, or symmetrically parallel terminated)
*Class II (series terminated)
*Class III (asymmetrically parallel terminated)
*Class IV (asymmetrically double parallel terminated)

Note that &quot;Symmetric parallel termination&quot; means that the termination resistor at the load is connected to half the output buffer&#x27;s supply voltage. &quot;Double parallel termination&quot; means that parallel termination resistors are fitted at both ends of the transmission line.
