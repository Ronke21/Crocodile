<text>Charles Manning Hope Clark, (3 March 1915 – 23 May 1991) was an Australian historian and the author of the best-known general history of Australia, his six-volume &quot;A History of Australia&quot;, published between 1962 and 1987. He has been described as &quot;Australia&#x27;s most famous historian&quot;, but his work has also been the target of criticism, particularly from conservatives and classical liberals.

==Early life==
Clark was born in Sydney on 3 March 1915, the son of the Reverend Charles Clark, an English-born Anglican priest from a working-class background (he was the son of a London carpenter), and Catherine Hope, who came from an old Australian establishment family. On his mother&#x27;s side he was a descendant of the Reverend Samuel Marsden, the &quot;flogging parson&quot; of early colonial New South Wales. Clark had a difficult relationship with his mother, who never forgot her superior social origins, and came to identify her with the Protestant middle class he so vigorously attacked in his later work. Charles held various curacies in Sydney including St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral, Sydney, and St John&#x27;s, Ashfield, where Catherine was a Sunday School teacher. The family moved to Melbourne when Clark was a child; and lived in what one biographer describes as &quot;genteel poverty&quot; on the modest income of an Anglican vicar.

Clark&#x27;s happiest memories of his youth were of the years 1922–1924, when his father was the vicar of Phillip Island, south-east of Melbourne, where he acquired the love of fishing and of cricket, which he retained for the rest of his life. He was educated at state schools at Cowes and Belgrave, and then at Melbourne Grammar School, where he was a boarder in School House. Here, as an introspective boy from a modest background, he suffered from ridicule and bullying, and acquired a lifelong dislike for the sons of the Melbourne upper class who had tormented him and others at this school. His later school years, however, were happier. He discovered a love of literature and the classics, and became an outstanding student of Greek, Latin and history (British and European). In 1933 he was equal dux of the school.

As a result, Clark won a scholarship to Trinity College at the University of Melbourne. Here he thrived, gaining firsts in ancient history and British history and captaining the college cricket team. In his second year he gained firsts in constitutional and legal history and in modern political institutions. One of his teachers, W. Macmahon Ball, one of Australia&#x27;s leading political scientists of this period, made a deep impression on him. By this time he had lost his Christian faith but was not attracted to any of the secular alternatives on offer. His writings as a student explicitly rejected both socialism and communism. At this point Clark&#x27;s political views continuously shifted from liberalism to a type of moderate socialism. His favourite writers at this time were Fyodor Dostoyevsky and T. S. Eliot, and his favourite historian was the conservative Thomas Carlyle. In terms of his evolving political views, a few years later, around 1944, Clark became a socialist of moderate views, a political position he maintained for the rest of his adult life, with political sympathies broadly placed on the Left and with the Australian Labor Party.

In 1937 Clark won a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, and left Australia in August 1938. Among his teachers at Oxford were Hugh Trevor-Roper (a conservative), Christopher Hill (at that time a communist) and A. J. P. Taylor (a moderate socialist). He won acceptance by excelling at cricket – playing for the Oxford XI and competing alongside Edward Heath and Roy Jenkins. He began a master of arts thesis on Alexis de Tocqueville (he finally submitted it in 1947, and it was published in 2000). Through basically sympathetic towards de Tocqueville&#x27;s liberalism, Clark wrote that his political vision for a just society was flawed by his ignorance of the misery of the masses and by his unwillingness to consider force to ensure justice.

At Oxford in the late 1930s he shared the Left&#x27;s horror of fascism – which he had seen first hand during a visit to Nazi Germany in 1938 – but was not attracted to the communism which was prevalent among undergraduates at the time. His exposure to Nazism and Fascism in 1938 made him more pessimistic and sceptical about the state of European civilisation. However, he was not attracted to the Left&#x27;s emancipatory process of socialist revolution and favoured, instead, a capitalist, social democratic and democratic socialist approach. At Oxford also he suffered the social snubs commonly experienced by &quot;colonials&quot; at that time, which was apparently the source of his lifelong dislike of the English. In 1939 in Oxford he married Dymphna Lodewyckx, the daughter of a Flemish intellectual and a formidable scholar in her own right, with whom he had six children.

==Academic career==
When World War II broke out in September 1939, Clark was exempted from military service on the grounds of his mild epilepsy. He supported himself while finishing his thesis by teaching history and coaching cricket teams at Blundell&#x27;s School, a public school at Tiverton in Devonshire, England. Here he discovered a gift for teaching. In June 1940 he suddenly decided to return to Australia, abandoning his unfinished thesis, but was unable to get a teaching position at an Australian university due to the wartime decline in enrolments. Instead he taught history at Geelong Grammar School, and also coached the school&#x27;s First XI – a highly prestigious appointment. Among those he taught were Rupert Murdoch and Stephen Murray-Smith.

At Geelong, he published two papers. The first, &quot;The Dilemma of the French Intelligentsia&quot;, concerned why French Catholic intellectuals such as Charles Maurras had supported the Vichy regime. Clark argued that Maurras and other French Catholic intellectuals had been reluctant collaborators, driven to support Vichy out of a dissatisfaction with bourgeois conservatism in France and a fear of the masses propelled by memories of the French Revolution. In his second paper entitled &quot;France and Germany&quot;, Clark offered up a comparative study of the intelligentsia of Germany and France, asking why the former nation gave birth to National Socialism while the latter nation had to be defeated to become Nazi. Clark offered up what would today be called the &quot;Sonderweg&quot; interpretation, arguing that in the 19th century the majority of French intellectuals had by and large accepted liberalism, rationalism and the values of &quot;liberté, égalité, fraternité&quot; whereas the majority of German intellectuals by contrast had embraced conservatism, emotionalism, and a vision of a hierarchical society ruled by an autocratic elite. Clark noted that at the beginning of the 20th century, the most famous French intellectual was the writer Émile Zola who had been a leading Dreyfusard in the Dreyfus affair as he maintained justice must apply to all French people. By contrast, Clark noted that the most famous German intellectual in some time period was the English-born Houston Stewart Chamberlain, the &quot;Evangelist of Race&quot;, whose theories divided the world into a racial hierarchy with the Germanic Aryan race as the &quot;herrenvolk&quot; (&quot;master race&quot;). While at Geelong he began systematically to read Australian history, literature and criticism for the first time. The result was his first publication on an Australian theme, an open letter to the 19th-century Australian writer &quot;Tom Collins&quot;, on the subject of mateship, which appeared in the literary magazine &quot;Meanjin&quot;.

In 1944 Clark returned to Melbourne University to finish his master&#x27;s thesis, an essential requirement if he was to gain a university post. He supported himself by tutoring politics, and later in the year he was finally appointed to a lectureship in politics. The acting head of the Politics Department at this time was Ian Milner, who soon left to become an Australian diplomat. Years later it was revealed that Milner had been a secret communist and Soviet agent. Clark&#x27;s brief friendship with Milner at this time has been seized on as evidence of Clark&#x27;s supposed communist sympathies, but it is unlikely that Clark knew anything about Milner&#x27;s covert activities. In late 1945 he transferred to the History Department, as a permanent lecturer in Australian History. With the encouragement of Max Crawford (head of the History Department from 1937 to 1970), he taught the university&#x27;s first full-year course in Australian history. Among his students were Frank Crean (later Deputy Prime Minister), Geoffrey Blainey, Bruce Grant, Geoffrey Serle, Ken Inglis and Ian Turner (the latter five all future historians of note), Helen Hughes, and Peter Ryan, later Clark&#x27;s publisher. During this time he began thoroughly researching the archives in Melbourne and Sydney for the documentary evidence on Australia&#x27;s early history. He also developed a reputation as a heavy drinker, and was a well-known figure in the pubs of nearby Carlton. (In the 1960s he gave up drink and was a total abstainer for the rest of his life.)

Clark later stated that it was reading the novelists, poets and playwrights during this period such as Joseph Furphy, James McAuley, Douglas Stewart, Henry Lawson, and D.H. Lawrence that led to his &quot;discovery of Australia&quot; as he became convinced that the story of Australia had not been properly told by historians, and the Australians had a past to be proud of. Clark was also disappointed by the treatment afforded by historians of &quot;dinkum&quot; Australians (i.e. ordinary Australians, so-called because they spoke the &quot;dinkum&quot; variety of English) with their values of mateship, egalitarianism and anti-elitism with the &quot;dinkum&quot; people being portrayed as almost a national disgrace. Clark argued it was time for Australian intellectuals to stop treating Great Britain as the model of excellence to which Australians should strive to meet, writing that Australia should be treated as an entity in its own right. However, Clark himself was critical of &quot;dinkum&quot; Australians, albeit from another direction as he maintained that values such as mateship were mere &quot;comforters&quot; that helped to make life in colonial Australia with its harsh environment more bearable, and failed to provide a means to fundamentally change society. Clark stated that he did not know what were the new values that Australian society needed, but that historians had the duty to start such a debate. A major problem for Australian historians in the 1940s was that most of the primary sources relating to the colonial period were held in archives in Britain, making research expensive and time-consuming. Starting in 1946, Clark together with L.J. Pryor collected documentary material relating to the founding of the colony of New South Wales in 1788, the transportation of convicts to the penal colony and the squatter living illegally in the bush with the aim of publishing them to make them more accessible to historians.

In 1948 Clark was promoted to Senior Lecturer, and was well set for a lifelong career at Melbourne University. But as the Cold War set in he began to find the intellectual climate of Melbourne uncomfortable. In 1947 F.L. Edmunds, a Liberal member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, launched an attack on &quot;Communist infiltration&quot; of the university, naming Crawford (a largely apolitical liberal) and Jim Cairns, an economics lecturer and a left-wing Labor Party member. Clark was not named, but when he went on the radio to defend his colleagues, he was attacked as well. Thirty of Clark&#x27;s students signed a letter affirming that he was a &quot;learned and sincere teacher&quot; of &quot;irreproachable loyalty&quot;. The Melbourne University branch of the Communist Party said that Clark was &quot;a reactionary&quot; and no friend of theirs.

In July 1949, Clark moved to Canberra to take up the post of professor of history at the Canberra University College (CUC), which was at that time a branch of Melbourne University, and which in 1960 became the School of General Studies of the Australian National University (ANU). He lived in Canberra, then still a &quot;bush capital&quot; in a rural setting, for the rest of his life. From 1949 to 1972 Clark was professor of history, first at CUC and then at ANU. In 1972 he was appointed to the new post of professor of Australian history, which he held until his retirement in 1974. He then held the title emeritus professor until his death.

During the 1950s Clark pursued a conventional academic career while teaching history in Canberra. In 1950 he published the first of two volumes of &quot;Select Documents in Australian History&quot; (Vol. 1, 1788–1850; Vol. 2, 1851–1900, appeared in 1955). These volumes made an important contribution to the teaching of Australian history in schools and universities by placing a wide selection of primary sources, many never before published, in the hands of students. The publication of the first volume of &quot;Select Documents&quot; in 1950 attracted much media attention at the time, being hailed as the beginning of a new period of Australian historiography. The documents were accompanied by extensive annotation and commentaries by Clark, and his critics now regard this as his best work, before the onset of what they see as his later decline. At this stage of his career Clark published as C. M. H. Clark, but he was always known as Manning Clark, and published his later works under that name.

During this period Clark was regarded as a conservative, both politically and in his approach to Australian history. In an influential 1954 lecture published under the title &quot;Rewriting Australian history&quot;, he rejected the nostalgic radical nationalism of &quot;Old Left&quot; historians such as Brian Fitzpatrick, Russel Ward, Vance Palmer and Robin Gollan, which, he said, tended to see Australian history as merely a &quot;manure heap&quot; from which the coming golden age of socialism would arise. He attacked many of the shibboleths of the nationalist school, such as the idealisation of the convicts, bushrangers and pioneers. The rewriting of Australian history, he said, &quot;will not come from the radicals of this generation because they are tethered to an erstwhile great but now excessively rigid creed&quot;. There were a number of similar comments in his annotation of the &quot;Select Documents&quot;. The diggers of Eureka, for example, were not revolutionaries, but aspiring capitalists; the dominant creed of the 1890s was not socialism, but fear of Asian immigration. Although these views were seen as conservative at the time, they were later taken up with greater force by the Marxist historian Humphrey McQueen in his 1970 book &quot;A New Britannia&quot;.

The orthodox left was sharply critical of Clark during this period. When Paul Mortier reviewed the second volume of &quot;Select Documents&quot; in the Communist Party newspaper &quot;Tribune&quot;, he criticised Clark for his lack of Marxist understanding: &quot;Professor Clark rejects class struggle as the key to historical development: he expressed grave doubts about whether there has been any real progress: and he has no good word for historians who pay tribute to the working people for their contributions to Australia&#x27;s traditions,&quot; he wrote.

In 1962 Clark contributed an essay to Peter Coleman&#x27;s book &quot;Australian Civilisation&quot;, in which he argued that much of Australian history could be seen as a three-sided struggle between Catholicism, Protestantism and secularism, a theme which he continued to develop in his later work. In his introduction Coleman wrote:

:&quot;The post-war Counter-Revolution [in Australian historiography] involves so many influences that it would be ridiculous to attribute it to the influence of any one man, but nevertheless the influence of Manning Clark has been of the greatest importance. By his questioning of the orthodox assumptions he did more than anyone else to release historians from the prison of the radical interpretation and to begin the systematic study of the neglected themes in our history, especially of religion&quot;.

At this time also Clark was close to James McAuley, founder of the conservative literary-political magazine &quot;Quadrant&quot;. McAuley persuaded him to become a member of &quot;Quadrant&quot;″s initial editorial advisory board. Clark was, however, never fully identified with political conservatism. In 1954 he was one of a group of intellectuals who publicly criticised the position of the Menzies government on the war in French Indo-China, and as a result was attacked as communist fellow-travellers in the House of Representatives by the outspoken right-wing parliamentarian Bill Wentworth. As a result, he was placed under surveillance by Australia&#x27;s domestic intelligence organisation, ASIO, who over the years compiled a large file of trivia and gossip about him, without ever discovering anything in his activities that posed a risk to &quot;national security&quot;.

==&quot;The History of Australia&quot;==

In the mid-1950s Clark conceived a new project: a large multi-volume history of Australia, based on the documentary sources but giving expression to Clark&#x27;s own ideas about the meaning of Australian history. In late 1955, he received a research grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to study the first visits by Europeans to Australia in the 17th century. He took leave from Canberra in 1956 and visited Jakarta, Burma and various cities in India, fossicking in museums and archives for documents and maps relating to the discovery of Australia by the Dutch in the 17th century, and also the possible discovery of Australia by the Chinese or the Portuguese. He then visited London, Oxford and the Netherlands, where he combed through the archives for more documents relating to the Dutch explorers and the founding of New South Wales in 1788 – Dymphna Clark did most of the research work in the Dutch archives. An immediate result of this research was &quot;Sources of Australian History&quot; (Oxford University Press 1957).

During his time in London, the nature of the project radically changed as he recalled: &quot;It was going to be very academic, very careful, very much a &#x27;Yes&#x27; and &#x27;No&#x27; performance, with genuflexions in the direction of Mr. &#x27;Dry-as-Dust&#x27;, and anxious looking over the shoulder at people I liked, hoping they were not as bored or lost as I was. It was all hopeless, lifeless, meaningless and false. I was in England, writing about Australia, writing about a country I did not really know, and about a country which I had a love-hate relationship&quot;. After some reflection, Clark decided that what he really wanted to do was write a vivid narrative of Australian history with a focus on the impact on the Australian environment on European colonists in the 18th and 19th centuries, marking the genesis of the book series that became &quot;The History of Australia&quot;.  

On his return to Australia, Clark began to write &quot;The History of Australia&quot;, which was originally envisioned as a two-volume work, with the first volume extending to the 1860s and the second volume ending in 1939. As Clark began to write, however, the work expanded dramatically, both in size and conception. The first volume of &quot;History&quot;, subtitled &quot;from the earliest times to the Age of Macquarie&quot; appeared in 1962, and five more volumes, taking the story down to 1935, appeared over the next 26 years. In his autobiographical memoir &quot;A Historian&#x27;s Apprenticeship&quot; published after his death, Clark recalled that his models were Carlyle, Edward Gibbon and T. B. Macaulay – two conservatives and a Whig – and that he was inspired by the belief that &quot;the story of Australia was a bible of wisdom both for those now living and, I hoped, for those to come after us&quot;. By this time he had rejected all the notions of progressive or Marxist historiography: &quot;I was beginning to see Australian history and indeed all history as a tragedy. Failure was the fate of the individual: success could be the fate of society. If that was a contradiction, I could only reply that it was but one of the many contradictions we must accept as soon as we can as part of the human condition&quot;.

The dominant theme of the early volumes of Clark&#x27;s history was the interplay between the harsh environment of the Australian continent and the European values of the people who discovered, explored and settled it in the 18th and 19th centuries. In common with most Australians of his generation, he had little knowledge of, or interest in, the culture of indigenous Australians, though this changed in his later life. He saw Catholicism, Protestantism and the Enlightenment as the three great contending influences in Australian history. He was chiefly interested in colourful, emblematic individuals and the struggles they underwent to maintain their beliefs in Australia; men like William Bligh, William Wentworth, John MacArthur and Daniel Deniehy. His view was that most of his heroes had a &quot;tragic flaw&quot; that made their struggles ultimately futile.

Clark largely ignored the 20th century historiographic preoccupation with economic and social history, and completely rejected the Marxist stress on class and class struggle as the driving force of social progress. He was also not much interested in detailed factual history, and as the &quot;History&quot; progressed it became less and less based in empirical research and more and more a work of literature: an epic rather than a history. Clark&#x27;s colorful writing style with its allusions to the Bible, apocalyptic imagery, and a focus on the psychological struggles within individuals was often criticised by historians, but made him popular with the public. Clark argued that the defining struggle between Protestantism, Catholicism and the Enlightenment world views ultimately ended not with the triumph of the &quot;lucky country&quot;, but rather a spiritual decline into a &quot;kingdom of nothingness&quot; and an &quot;age of ruins&quot;, as Australians became in Clark&#x27;s view a nation of materialistic petty, petit-bourgeois property owners. Despite his pessimistic conclusions, Clark wrote he still had hope for Australia&#x27;s future, writing:&quot;Australians have liberated themselves from the fate of being second-rate Europeans and have begun to contribute to the neverending conversation of humanity on the meaning of life and the means of wisdom and understanding. So far no one has described the phoenix that will arise from the ashes of an age of ruins. No one has risked prophesying whether an age of ruins will be the prelude to the coming of the barbarians or to taking a seat at the great banquet of life. The life-deniers and the straiteners have been swept into the dustbin of human history. Now is the time for the life-affirmers and the enlargers to show whether they have anything to say, whether they have any food for the great hungers of humanity&quot;.

His inattention to factual detail became notorious, and was noted even in the first volume, which drew a critical review from Malcolm Ellis titled &quot;History without facts&quot;. Ellis, who had a history of personal hostility with Clark, was the first of many critics who took Clark to task for too much speculation about what was in the hearts of men and too little description of what they actually did. The historian A. G. L. Shaw, who had been best man at Clark&#x27;s wedding, said that while most of Clark&#x27;s errors were trivial, together they created &quot;a sense of mistrust in the work as a whole&quot;. There was also criticism that Clark relied too heavily on his own interpretation of primary sources and ignored the secondary literature. In contrast, many historians, including Max Crawford, Bede Nairn, Kathleen Fitzpatrick and Allan W. Martin the official biographer of Robert Menzies, praised the book.

The &quot;History&quot; thus met a mixed critical response – &quot;praise, misgivings and puzzlement in varying proportions&quot; – but a generally positive public one. Most readers warmed to Clark&#x27;s great gift for narrative prose and the depiction of individual character, and were not troubled by the comments of academic critics on his factual inaccuracies or their doubts about his historiographic theories. The books sold extremely well and were a major earner for Melbourne University Press (MUP) and its director, Peter Ryan. Even critics who found fault with the &quot;History&quot; as history admired it as literature. In &quot;The Age&quot;, Stuart Sayers hailed it as &quot;a major work, not only of scholarship... but also of Australian literature&quot;. Some reviewers complained that Clark was &quot;too pre-occupied with tragic vision&quot; or condemned his &quot;Biblical and slightly mannered style&quot;, but &quot;recognised that Clark&#x27;s very excesses gave the &quot;History&quot; its profundity and distinctive insight&quot;. The respected historian John La Nauze, author of a highly regarded biography of Alfred Deakin, wrote that the importance of Clark&#x27;s work &quot;lies not in the apocalyptic vision of our history... which I do not understand, and which I am sure I would disagree with if I did,&quot; but in &quot;the particular flashes of interpretation&quot; which gave &quot;a new appearance to familiar features&quot;. Alastair Davidson stated in a review in the magazine &quot;Dissent&quot; in 1968: &quot;The astonishing savaging of volume one of &quot;A History of Australia&quot;, when it appeared in 1962, seems almost symbolic. What is important is that such pettiness did not harm such as Gibbon and Taine. Manning Clark will not go into the dustbin of history because of Ellis&#x27; quibbling about the precise time this or that event happened. Nor will McManners&#x27;s more gentle questioning about whether he had really understood the nature of the Enlightenment correctly really be important. Great history is not determined by the precision of the facts it contains. What will decide this is the meaningfulness of the vision of Man which it has&quot;.

==&quot;Meeting Soviet Man&quot;==
In 1958, Clark visited the Soviet Union for three weeks as a guest of the Soviet Union of Writers, accompanied by the Communist writer Judah Waten and the Queensland poet James Devaney, a Catholic of moderate views. The delegation visited Moscow and Leningrad, and Clark also visited Prague on his way home. While Waten wanted him to admire the achievements of the Soviet state, Clark was more interested in attending the Bolshoi Ballet, the Dostoyevsky Museum and the St Sergius Monastery at Zagorsk. Clark annoyed both Waten and his Soviet hosts by asking questions about Boris Pasternak, the dissident Soviet writer who was in trouble for having his novel &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; published in the West. Nevertheless, he was impressed by the material progress of the country after the devastation of World War II and by the limited political liberalisation which was taking place under Nikita Khrushchev.

On his return he wrote a series of articles for the liberal news-magazine &quot;Nation&quot;, which were later published in booklet form as &quot;Meeting Soviet Man&quot; (Angus and Robertson 1960). This work later became &quot;exhibit A&quot; for the charge that Clark was a communist, a communist sympathiser or, at best, hopelessly naive about communism. In it he gave ammunition to his enemies by denying that millions of people had died during Joseph Stalin&#x27;s collectivisation of agriculture. On the other hand, he was scathing about the cultural dreariness of the Soviet Union and about the greed and philistinism of the Soviet bureaucracy. Although he criticised Soviet society for the &quot;greyness&quot; of everyday life and the suppression of religion, he praised the Soviet state&#x27;s ability to provide for the material needs of the people. His comment that Vladimir Lenin stood on a par with Jesus as one of the great men of all time was later often quoted against him.

At the time, however, the book was not universally seen as pro-Soviet. Writing in &quot;Tribune&quot;, Waten denounced it as misleading and &quot;littered with half-truths and anti-Soviet clichés&quot;. Clark&#x27;s son recalls:

:&quot;The irony is that it was during the time of publication that my father&#x27;s relationship with Judah was most strained, and the point of conflict was over the content of the book. Judah attacked &quot;Meeting Soviet Man&quot; for being too sympathetic to the west, and too critical of the Soviet Union. I recall one particularly tense meeting at Judah&#x27;s house. To lighten up the atmosphere he spent the first hour regaling us with colorful stories about the professional boxing bouts he attended in Melbourne&#x27;s old Festival Hall. Then he and my father retired to another room to talk the issue out. I could tell from the grim expressions as they emerged that there had been no resolution of their differences&quot;.

Nevertheless, &quot;Meeting Soviet Man&quot; marked the beginning of Clark&#x27;s reputation as a left-winger, something of which his work to that point had given no indication. James McAuley, hitherto a close friend, called the book &quot;shoddy,&quot; and Donald Horne, then a conservative and editor of &quot;The Bulletin&quot;, called it &quot;superficial&quot; and showing &quot;too much sentimental goodwill&quot; towards the Soviet Union.

It remains unclear what Clark&#x27;s political views actually were, although it is clear that from the mid-1960s onwards he identified the Australian Labor Party as the party of progress and Australian independence, and particularly admired Gough Whitlam (who became Leader of the ALP Opposition in 1967 and Prime Minister five years later) as the leader Australia had been looking for ever since the death of John Curtin in 1945. Stephen Holt wrote in his study &quot;A Short History of Manning Clark&quot;: &quot;Though never belonging to a party, he was intensely political, embodying the conflicting loyalties of inter-war Australia... He disturbed conservative and conventional opinion without himself becoming an unswerving left-wing believer&quot;. Peter Craven disagreed: &quot;I&#x27;m not sure that he [Holt] is right that Clark was an intensely political figure. He seems in some respects to have been more of a political agnostic whose personal mythology became conflated with the dreary mechanisms of celebrity in this country so that both sides were ready to plague him&quot;.

Whatever his real views, Clark enjoyed praise and celebrity, and since he was now getting it mainly from the left he tended to play to the gallery in his public statements. &quot;He was more popular and newsworthy, &#x27;the best guru in the business,&#x27; as Geoff Serle put it in 1974&quot;. There is, however, no evidence that Clark had any real sympathy with Communism as an ideology or as a system of government. He visited the Soviet Union again in 1970 and in 1973, and he again expressed his admiration for Lenin as a historical figure. But in 1971 he took part in a demonstration outside the Soviet Embassy in Canberra against the Soviet persecution of the author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and in 1985 he again took part in an anti-Soviet demonstration, this time in support of the Polish trade union Solidarity. In 1978 he told an interviewer that he was not an advocate of revolution. He was torn, he said, between &quot;radicalism and pessimism,&quot; a pessimism based on doubts that socialism would really make things any better.

==&quot;The History of Australia&quot;: later volumes==
Volumes II and III of the &quot;History&quot; broadly followed the path prepared by Clark&#x27;s earlier work and ideas. Volume II (launched in 1968) took the story to the 1830s, and dwelt on the conflicts between the colonial governors and their landowning allies with the emerging first generation of native-born white Australians, many of them the children of convicts. It prompted Russel Ward to praise Clark as &quot;the greatest historian, living or dead, of Australia&quot;. Even Leonie Kramer, doyenne of conservative intellectuals and closely associated with the &quot;Quadrant&quot; group, named Volume II as her &quot;book of the year&quot;. The appearance of Volume III in 1973 aroused little controversy – commentators of all political views apparently felt there was nothing new to say about Clark&#x27;s work.

By the time Volume IV appeared in 1979, however, the tone of both his work and of the critical response to it had changed greatly. (This process was aided by Clark&#x27;s retirement from teaching in 1975 – he no longer faced the demands of a professional academic career and was free to write what he liked.) Although Clark had rejected the nostalgic nationalism of the &quot;Old Left&quot; historians, he shared much of their contempt for the old Anglo-Australian upper class, whose stronghold was the &quot;Melbourne establishment&quot; where Clark was raised and educated. His earlier preoccupation with the clash of European belief systems imported into Australia in the 18th century faded, and was replaced by a focus on what Clark saw as the conflict between &quot;those who stood for &#x27;King and Empire&#x27; and those who stood for &#x27;the Australian way of life and the Australian dream,&#x27; between &#x27;the Old Dead Tree and the Young Tree Green&#x27;&quot;. While this was a focus more relevant to the history of Australia in the late 19th and 20th centuries, it was also a much more politically contentious one, and Clark&#x27;s undisguised contempt for the &quot;Old Dead Tree&quot; of the Anglo-Australian middle class fuelled the view that he was now writing polemic rather than history.

Writing in the heated political atmosphere of Australia in the 1970s, Clark came to see Robert Menzies (Liberal Prime Minister 1949–1966) as the representative of the &quot;old&quot; Australia, and to see Whitlam as the hero of a new progressive Australia. Clark campaigned for Whitlam in the 1972 and 1974 elections, and was outraged by his dismissal by the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, in 1975, after which he wrote an article for &quot;Meanjin&quot; called &quot;Are we a nation of bastards?&quot;. These views increasingly coloured his writing, and were notable in the last three volumes of the &quot;History&quot;. Volume IV of the &quot;History&quot;, launched in 1978, was notably strident in its attacks on Anglo-Australian conservatism, materialism, philistinism and &quot;groveldom&quot;. It attracted the now familiar range of critical comment: criticism from conservatives, praise from the left (although Marxists like Connell and McQueen continued to complain that Clark was really a &quot;bourgeois historian&quot;).

In 1975, the Australian Broadcasting Commission invited Clark to give the 1976 Boyer Lectures, a series of lectures which were broadcast and later published as &quot;A Discovery of Australia&quot;. The Boyer lectures allowed Clark to describe many of the core ideas of his published work and indeed his own life in characteristic style. &quot;Everything a historian writes,&quot; he stated for example, &quot;should be a celebration of life, a hymn of praise to life. It should come up from inside a man who knows all about that horror of the darkness when a man returns to the dust from whence he came, a man who has looked into the heart of that great darkness, but has both a tenderness for everyone, and yet, paradoxically, a melancholy, a sadness, and a compassion because what matters most in life is never likely to happen&quot;. Clark&#x27;s next work, &quot;In Search of Henry Lawson&quot; (1979), was a reworking of an essay which was originally written in 1964 as a chapter for Geoffrey Dutton&#x27;s pioneering &quot;The Literature of Australia&quot;. It was worked up in some haste in response to the desire of the Macmillan publishing house for a new book with which they could cash in on Clark&#x27;s popularity. Predictably, and with more than usual justification, Clark saw Lawson as another of his tragic heroes, and he wrote with a good deal of empathy of Lawson&#x27;s losing battle with alcoholism: a fate Clark himself had narrowly avoided by giving up drink in the 1960s. But the book showed both its age and its haste of preparation, and was savaged by Colin Roderick, the leading authority on Lawson, as &quot;a tangled thicket of factual errors, speculation and ideological interpretation&quot;.

By the time Volume V of the &quot;History&quot;, which covered the years between 1881 and 1915, appeared in 1981, Clark had increasingly withdrawn from political controversy. The retirement of Whitlam after his defeats at the 1975 and 1977 elections removed the main focus of Clark&#x27;s political loyalty – he was not very impressed with Whitlam&#x27;s pragmatic successor, Bill Hayden, and even less impressed with Hayden&#x27;s chief rival, Bob Hawke, whom Clark had known since his student days at ANU and regarded as lacking in principle. In addition, Clark, although only in his mid 60s, was in poor health, already suffering from the heart problems that were to overshadow his final years. In any case, Clark made it clear in this volume that his enthusiasm for Whitlam had not changed his views of the Labor Party as a party: Labor&#x27;s founding leaders, Chris Watson and Andrew Fisher, he wrote, were dull and unimaginative men, who wanted no more than that working men should have a modest share of the prosperity of bourgeois Australia. The real hero of Volume V was Alfred Deakin, leader of enlightened middle-class liberalism, and (like Clark) a product of Melbourne Grammar and Melbourne University.

In his last years, Clark responded to criticism about his treatment of the Aborigines with many lambasting him for his 1962 statement that &quot;civilisation did not begin in Australia until the last quarter of the eighteenth century&quot;. In response, Clark stated that when he began the &quot;History&quot;, he was writing with a &quot;British clock&quot; in his mind, saying: &quot;Now I want to go on to persuade Australians to build their own clock. That, I think, must start forty or fifty thousand years ago with the migration of the Aborigines to Australia...I told only a part of what is possibly the greatest human tragedy in the history of Australia-the confrontation between the white man and the Aborigine&quot;.

In 1983, Clark was hospitalised for the first time and underwent bypass surgery, and further surgery was needed in 1984. Always a pessimist, Clark became convinced that his time was running out, and from this point he lost interest in the outside world and its concerns and concentrated solely on finishing the &quot;History&quot; before his death. His work on Volume VI, to cover the years between the two world wars, led him to compare Hawke, who became Prime Minister in March 1983, with James Scullin, the hapless Labor Prime Minister of the Depression years who failed to take any radical steps and saw his government destroyed. Clark&#x27;s health improved in 1985 and he was able to travel to China and to the Australian war cemeteries in France. A final burst of energy enabled him to finish Volume VI in 1986, although the story was taken only down to 1935, when both John Curtin and Robert Menzies emerged as national leaders, allowing Clark to draw a sharp contrast between these two, portraying Menzies as the representative of the old Anglo-Australian &quot;grovellers&quot; and Curtin as the leader of the new Australian nationalism. The book was launched in July 1987.

==Criticism of his work==
By the 1970s, Clark, while still writing history which was conservative in a historiographical sense (that is, not based on any economic or class theory of history), had come to be seen as a &quot;left-wing&quot; historian, and eventually he accepted this label, despite his fundamental scepticism and pessimism. This meant that left-wing intellectuals and commentators generally praised his work, while right-wingers increasingly condemned it, in both cases often without much regard to the merit of the work.

Clark&#x27;s purported defection to the left in the 1970s caused fury on the literary and intellectual right, particularly since he was accompanied by several other leading figures including Donald Horne and the novelist Patrick White, whose career has some parallels with Clark&#x27;s. He was denounced in &quot;Quadrant&quot; and in the columns of the Murdoch press as the godfather of the &quot;Black armband view of history&quot;. He was unfavourably compared with Geoffrey Blainey, Australia&#x27;s leading &quot;orthodox&quot; historian (who coined the &quot;black armband&quot; phrase). Clark reacted to these attacks in typically contrary style by becoming more outspoken, thus provoking further attacks. These exchanges were made more bitter by the fact that most of the participants had been friends for many years.

The attacks on Clark were not entirely politically motivated. Clark&#x27;s professional reputation as a historian declined during the later period of his life, and the final two volumes of the &quot;History&quot; were given scant attention by other serious historians, regardless of their political views. This was not because they were seen as too &quot;left-wing,&quot; but because they were seen as verbose, repetitive and with few new insights to offer. Clark&#x27;s publisher at MUP, Peter Ryan maintains that leading historians acknowledged to him in private that the later volumes of the &quot;History&quot; were inferior work, but would not say so publicly out of respect for Clark, or out of a reluctance to give ammunition to the political attacks on him. &quot;By the time Volume V was published in 1981, this approached the proportions of a professional scandal. &quot;Quadrant&quot;, for example, asked five of Australia&#x27;s leading historians to review it, and received five more of less identical replies: &#x27;It&#x27;s a terrible book, &quot;but you can&#x27;t expect me to say that in print&quot;&quot;.

Clark&#x27;s tendency to focus on individuals and their tragic flaws, while a serviceable approach when writing about the early days of colonial New South Wales, a small and isolated society dominated by such colourful characters as MacArthur and Wentworth, had much less validity when he was writing about the more complex Australia of the later 19th and 20th centuries. His lack of interest in economic and social history became less forgivable, particularly among the younger generation of historians, regardless of their politics. The Marxist Raewyn Connell wrote that Clark had no understanding of the historical process, assuming that things happened by chance or &quot;by an odd irony&quot;. Bill Cope, writing in &quot;Labour History&quot;, the house-journal of left-wing historians, wrote that Clark had been &quot;left behind, both by the new social movements of the postwar decades and the new histories which have transformed the way we see our past and ourselves&quot;. John Hirst, usually regarded as a moderately conservative historian, wrote: &quot;In the end Clark became the sort of historian he had set out to supersede – a barracker for the &#x27;progressive&#x27; side who accepted uncritically its view of the world&quot;.

==Posthumous reputation==
By the time Clark died in May 1991, he had become something of a national institution, as much for his public persona as for his historical work. His goatee beard, his bush hat, his stout walking stick and his enigmatic public utterances had become widely known even among people who had never opened any of his books. It was this which inspired the 1988 project of turning the &quot;History&quot; into a musical, &quot;Manning Clark&#x27;s History of Australia – The Musical&quot;, funded by the Australian Bicentenary and with a script by Don Watson, historian and later speechwriter to Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating. The show was a flop, but did not detract from Clark&#x27;s public standing. The musical solidified Clark&#x27;s reputation as a &quot;shameless lover&quot; of Australia as his stage version sang &quot;For me Australia and no other/Mistress, harlot, goddess, mother/Whose first great native son I am&quot;. His last works were two volumes of autobiography, &quot;The Puzzles of Childhood&quot; (Viking 1989) and &quot;The Quest for Grace&quot; (Viking 1990). A third, unfinished volume, &quot;A Historian&#x27;s Apprenticeship&quot; (Melbourne University Press 1992), was published after his death.

In September 1993, &quot;Quadrant&quot; published an article by Peter Ryan who had edited and published Volumes II to VI of Clark&#x27;s &quot;History&quot; at Melbourne University Press. In this article he wrote that during this process &quot;scholarly rigour and historical strictness were slowly seeping out of both man and &quot;History&quot;, and that a sententious showiness in both of them, as it grew, was making the whole undertaking unworthy of the imprint of a scholarly publishing house&quot;. Ryan&#x27;s article was attacked by a range of critics, notably historians such as Russel Ward, Don Watson, Humphrey MacQueen, Stuart Macintyre and Paul Bourke, and the critic Robert Hughes. The polemic raged along left-right lines.

On 24 August 1996, the attack on Clark&#x27;s reputation reached a new level with a front-page article by the Rupert Murdoch owned &quot;Herald Sun&quot;, alleging that Clark was a Soviet spy. It published excerpts of Clark&#x27;s ASIO file and stated that he was friendly with two men who were later confirmed to be Soviet agents. It also claimed that he had been awarded the Order of Lenin for his services. The story was revisited in August 1999 with the allegation in Brisbane&#x27;s &quot;Courier-Mail&quot;, that he had been a &quot;Soviet agent of influence&quot;. In fact Clark, along with many others, had been given a mass-produced bronze medallion when he had visited Moscow in 1970, to speak at a conference organised to mark the centenary of Lenin&#x27;s birth. An investigation by the Australian Press Council found the Order of Lenin allegations to be false. The Press Council ruling said: &quot;The newspaper had too little evidence to assert that Prof Clark was awarded the Order of Lenin – rather there is much evidence to the contrary. That being so, the Press Council finds that the &quot;Courier-Mail&quot; was not justified in publishing its key assertion and the conclusions which so strongly flowed from it. The newspaper should have taken further steps to check the accuracy of its reports. While the &quot;Courier-Mail&quot; devoted much space to people challenging its assertions, the Press Council believes it should have retracted the allegations about which Prof Clark&#x27;s supporters complained&quot;.

Further criticism of Clark&#x27;s reliability arose in March 2007 with the discovery that Clark&#x27;s account, given in his memoirs and elsewhere, of walking the streets of Bonn the day after Kristallnacht was untrue. By examining Clark&#x27;s letters and diary, the writer Mark McKenna established that it was Clark&#x27;s future wife Dymphna, and not Clark, who was present on that day, although Clark did arrive in Bonn a fortnight later. Brian Matthews notes, however, that when Clark was reunited with Dymphna &quot;as his diary records, on 25 November 1938&quot; evidence of Kristallnacht &quot;was still shockingly visible, and it was explicit and confronting enough to scar his sensibilities and live in his memory...With his capacity for imaginative reconstruction and his acute sensitivity to emotional ambience and atmosphere, what he saw of its immediate aftermath was for him quite as shattering as the original event had been for Dymphna and others who had experienced it on the night of 10 November 1938&quot;.

==Honours==
Clark was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) in 1975. He was a Foundation Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities (1969). He won the Fellowship of Australian Writers&#x27; (Victoria) Moomba History Book Award and the Henry Lawson Arts Award in 1969, the Australian Literature Society&#x27;s gold medal in 1970, &quot;The Age&quot; Book Prize in 1974 and the New South Wales Premier&#x27;s Literary Award in 1979. He was awarded honorary doctorates by the Universities of Melbourne, Newcastle and Sydney. In 1980 he was named Australian of the Year.

After Dymphna Clark&#x27;s death in 2000, the Clark&#x27;s home in Tasmania Circle, Forrest, designed by Robin Boyd, was turned into Manning Clark House], an educational centre devoted to Manning Clark&#x27;s life and work. Manning Clark House &quot;provides opportunities for the whole community to debate and discuss contemporary issues and ideas, through a program of conferences, seminars, forums, publishing, and arts and cultural events&quot;. In 1999 Manning Clark House inaugurated an annual Manning Clark Lecture, which is given each year by a distinguished Australian.

As well as McKenna&#x27;s book, Brian Matthews published &quot;Manning Clark: A Life&quot; in 2008. In the interim two less ambitious books have appeared: Stephen Holt&#x27;s study &quot;A Short History of Manning Clark&quot; and Carl Bridge&#x27;s collection of essays, &quot;Manning Clark: His Place in History&quot;. Manning Clark House is also planning to publish an edition of Clark&#x27;s letters.

The Manning Clark Centre, a former lecture theatre complex at the Australian National University, was named in his honour. In the south of Canberra, Manning Clark House was built in his legacy in 1984 and served as the ACT Department of Education headquarters. The building is now occupied by the Department of Human Services.

During 1988, the bicentennial year of European occupation, a stage musical &#x27;Manning Clark&#x27;s History of Australia; the Musical&#x27;, performed for several weeks in Melbourne. Based mainly on Volume 1, it failed to fill houses and ran only seven weeks. The poster featured Clark, holding a set of his History, in a chorus line of significant Australian characters, flanked by Ned Kelly and Nellie Melba.

<text>Linda Hopkins (born Melinda Helen Matthews; December 14, 1924 – April 10, 2017) was an American actress and blues and gospel singer. She recorded classic, traditional, and urban blues, and performed R&amp;B and soul, jazz, and show tunes.

==Biography==
Hopkins was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States, the second child of the Reverend Fred Matthews, Sr. and Hazel Smith, Hopkins grew up in the section of New Orleans known by the locals as &quot;Zion City&quot;. She went to school in &quot;Gert Town&quot; which bordered the Xavier University of Louisiana.

Known as &quot;Lil Helen Matthews&quot; as a child, she was discovered at the age of eleven by Mahalia Jackson when she persuaded Jackson to perform at a fundraiser at her home church, St. Mark&#x27;s Baptist Church. Lil Helen opened the children&#x27;s fundraising program with a rendition of Jackson&#x27;s gospel hit, &quot;God Shall Wipe Your Tears Away&quot;. Jackson was reportedly so impressed by Helen&#x27;s determination and talent that she arranged for the young girl to join the Southern Harp Spiritual Singers in 1936. Hopkins remained with the group for a decade.

She first saw Bessie Smith perform &quot;Empty Bed Blues&quot; at The New Orleans Palace Theatre in 1936. Hopkins greatly admired Smith and later won critical plaudits for her rendition of Smith in the 1959 theatrical presentation &quot;Jazz Train&quot;. Matthews left New Orleans in the 1950s, and, in 1951, began performing at Slim Jenkins&#x27; Night Club in the Oakland/Richmond area. There she met Johnny Otis and Little Esther Phillips who created her stage name, Linda Hopkins. In 1952, Hopkins toured Hawaii and Japan for two years which included a stint with Louis Armstrong at The Brown Derby in Honolulu. She recorded for the Savoy, Crystalette, Forecast, Federal and Atco labels and often appeared at the Apollo Theatre in Harlem.

In 1960, Hopkins first toured Europe in the &quot;Broadway Express&quot;, the restaged production of &quot;Jazz Train&quot;. She recorded &quot;Shake a Hand&quot; with Jackie Wilson on the Brunswick label, which is her sole hit single reaching #21 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. She also recorded &quot;I Found Love&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s Nothing Like Love&quot; with him on Brunswick in early 1962. She attended Stella Adler&#x27;s Acting School in New York City.

During the 1970s, Hopkins performed in the Broadway musical, &quot;Purlie&quot;, and with Sammy Davis Jr. for nine months. In addition, she performed at President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s 1977 inaugural ball. In 1972 she was awarded a Tony and Drama Desk Award for her performance in &quot;Inner City&quot;. She sang &quot;Do You Believe&quot; at the political event Star-Spangled Women for McGovern–Shriver, bringing 19,000 people to their feet.

Hopkins starred in &quot;Me and Bessie&quot;, a one-woman show paying homage to blues singer Bessie Smith, conceived and written by Hopkins and Will Holt. The world premiere was in Washington, D.C., in 1974. After a run in Los Angeles it transferred to the Ambassador Theatre on Broadway. The critically acclaimed show ran for thirteen months and 453 performances, and Hopkins was nominated for the Drama Desk Award for Unique Theatrical Experience.

In 1985, &quot;Black and Blue&quot;, written by Claudio Segovia and Hector Orezzoli, premiered in Paris at the Théâtre Musical Paris. The musical revue opened on Broadway in 1989 and ran for 829 performances. Hopkins received a Tony Award nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Musical. &quot;Wild Women Blues&quot;, conceived by Hopkins and produced by Mel Howard and created by Hopkins and William Lipscomb, premiered in Berlin in 1997. In 1998 Hopkins celebrated 50 years in show business.

In 2005, &quot;Motherin&#x27; The Blues: Linda Hopkins — The Continuing Legacy of The Blues Woman&quot;, researched and written by Erany Barrow-Pryor, Ph.D. through the Department of English at University of California, Los Angeles, was published.

In October 2005, Hopkins received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Hopkins died in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on April 10, 2017, at the age of 92.

<doc id="693848" wikidata="Q17028407" url="?curid=693848" title="Hypergeometric identity">
<text>In mathematics, hypergeometric identities are equalities involving sums over hypergeometric terms, i.e. the coefficients occurring in hypergeometric series. These identities occur frequently in solutions to combinatorial problems, and also in the analysis of algorithms. 

These identities were traditionally found &#x27;by hand&#x27;. There exist now several algorithms which can find and &quot;prove&quot; all hypergeometric identities.

== Examples ==
: formula_1

: formula_2

: formula_3

: formula_4

== Definition ==
There are two definitions of hypergeometric terms, both used in different cases as explained below. See also hypergeometric series.

A term &quot;tk&quot; is a hypergeometric term if
: formula_5

is a rational function in &quot;k&quot;.

A term &quot;F(n,k)&quot; is a hypergeometric term if
: formula_6

is a rational function in &quot;k&quot;.

There exist two types of sums over hypergeometric terms, the definite and indefinite sums. A definite sum is of the form
: formula_7

The indefinite sum is of the form
: formula_8

== Proofs ==
Although in the past proofs have been found for many specific identities, there exist several general algorithms to find and prove identities. These algorithms first find a &quot;simple expression&quot; for a sum over hypergeometric terms and then provide a certificate which anyone can use to check and prove the correctness of the identity.

For each of the hypergeometric sum types there exist one or more methods to find a &quot;simple expression&quot;. These methods also provide the certificate to check the identity&#x27;s proof:
* &quot;Definite sums&quot;: Sister Celine&#x27;s Method, Zeilberger&#x27;s algorithm
* &quot;Indefinite sums&quot;: Gosper&#x27;s algorithm

The book A = B by Marko Petkovšek, Herbert Wilf and Doron Zeilberger describes the three main approaches mentioned above.

<text>Húsavík () is a town in Norðurþing municipality on the northeast coast of Iceland on the shores of Skjálfandi bay with 2,485 inhabitants. The most famous landmark of the town is the wooden church Húsavíkurkirkja, built in 1907. Húsavík is served by Húsavík Airport.

==Overview==
Here income is derived from tourism and fishing, as well as from retail and small industries. Until recently, Húsavík was the export harbour for silica that was extracted from nearby lake Mývatn.

According to the &quot;Landnámabók&quot; (&quot;Book of Settlement&quot;), Húsavík was the first place in Iceland to be settled in by a Norseman. The Swedish Viking Garðar Svavarsson stayed there for one winter around 870 A.D. When he left the island in spring of 870, after a winter&#x27;s stay, he left behind a man named Náttfari and two slaves, a man and a woman, and they established a farm here. The name of the town means &quot;bay of houses&quot;, probably referring to Garðar&#x27;s homestead, which was probably the only houses then in Iceland.

==Tourism==
Húsavík has become a centre of whale watching in Iceland due to whales of different species that frequently enter the bay.
The Húsavík Whale Museum is located in the town centre by the harbour.
In the town there is also a civic museum of culture and biology.
Among other things, it shows a stuffed polar bear (arrived in Grímsey in 1969) and ancient boats.

Each year in mid July, Húsavík holds a festival called &quot;Mærudagar&quot; , which translates to “Candy Days”. Thousands of people from all over Iceland come to the tiny town to enjoy this occasion which consists of music, colourful decorations, and an array of food and drink.

Húsavík is also home to The Exploration Museum, a museum of the history of human exploration. A monument honouring the Apollo astronauts who got trained up around Húsavík during the 1960s is located outside the museum.

The Eurovision Museum, dedicated to the Eurovision Song Contest, had its soft opening in October 2021. An official grand opening was scheduled to happen sometime in 2022.

The region of Mývatn, with its interesting geology and diverse animal life, is nearby. Jökulsárgljúfur National Park with the horseshoe-shaped canyon Ásbyrgi and the waterfalls Dettifoss, Hafragilsfoss and Selfoss are also not far from the town.

Húsavík Airport is located close to the town. Until 2024, there were regular flights to Reykjavík Airport. The Vaðlaheiðargöng tunnel opened in 2019 which shortened the travel time to Akureyri to within an hour. Flights from Húsavík Airport have therefore ceased.

==Sports==
ÍF Völsungur is the local football club. They last played in Iceland&#x27;s top tier in the 1988 season. The town also offers many opportunities for recreational sports. A 9 hole golf course, hiking and walking paths, two gym facilities and an outdoor public swimming pool. 

==Popular culture==
Húsavík served as the setting of the 2020 Netflix film &quot;Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga&quot;, a comedic story of two Húsavík natives representing Iceland in the Eurovision Song Contest, with one of the film&#x27;s songs named after the town. The song itself was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 93rd Academy Awards.

The song&#x27;s taped Best Original Song performance was filmed on location in Húsavík. In a break with Oscar tradition, all five songs had their performances pre-taped due to the COVID-19 pandemic instead of being performed live. &quot;Húsavík&quot; was the only one of the five nominated songs to have its pre-taped performance taking place outside of the United States.

On 25 April 2021, the performance was aired along with pre-taped performances of the other four nominated songs in that year&#x27;s category. All five song performances were shown during the red carpet pre-show special that took place just before the main ceremony began.

Residents of the town reported a significant jump in tourism following the film&#x27;s release. In 2021, The Eurovision Museum opened in Húsavík telling the story of the song contest and the film.

<doc id="693873" wikidata="Q6803026" url="?curid=693873" title="Me and Bessie">
<text>Me and Bessie is a musical revue about the life and career of blues singer Bessie Smith. The basically one-woman show, conceived and written by Will Holt and Linda Hopkins and performed by Hopkins, features songs by Lil Green, Clarence Williams, Henry Creamer, Andy Razaf, and Jimmy Cox, among others.

It originally was presented at Ford&#x27;s Theatre in Washington, D.C. from November 1–17, 1974, then produced by the Center Theatre Group and staged by Robert Greenwald at the Mark Taper Forum from April 4 through May 3, 1975.

The Broadway production was directed by Greenwald, with special dance sequences choreographed by Lester Wilson for two characters, identified only as Man and Woman (Lester Wilson and Gerri Dean). Howlett Smith and Lenny Hambro were co-Musical Directors. Donald Harris was responsible for scenic design.

Following two previews, it opened at the Ambassador Theatre on October 22, 1975. It transferred to the Edison Theatre on December 3, 1975 and remained there until December 5, 1976, running for a total of 453 performances. Between September 24 and its closing, it ran in repertory with &quot;Oh! Calcutta!&quot;

&quot;In and Around Town&quot;, a weekly critical guide for entertainment in &quot;New York&quot;, included a capsule review for &quot;Me and Bessie&quot; that read, &quot;The raw fervor of Linda Hopkins&#x27;s blues singing is all that matters here, and it&#x27;s enough. Unfortunately, the show is also burdened with a silly script by Will Holt, which consists mostly of having Miss Hopkins disavow the fact that she&#x27;s Bessie Smith with all the fervor of a Kennedy disavowing politics.&quot; However, in 2011, Backstage magazine remembered Hopkin&#x27;s performance as Smith: &quot;It&#x27;s been 36 years since I saw her in it at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, but she&#x27;s stayed with me as the definitive Bessie Smith, and of course the cast album plays even more powerfully than Smith&#x27;s original.&quot;

Linda Hopkins was nominated for the Drama Desk Award for Unique Theatrical Experience but lost to &quot;The Norman Conquests&quot;. The production held the record for the longest-running one-woman show in Broadway history until &quot;Golda&#x27;s Balcony&quot;, starring Tovah Feldshuh, surpassed it by forty performances.

<text>St Matthew&#x27;s Catholic School is a Catholic school located in Lewis Street, Mudgee, New South Wales, Australia teaching from Kindergarten to Year 12.

==History==
A Catholic school was first established in Mudgee in the 19th century. Leading Australian author Henry Lawson studied there for a time but struggled to find friends due to deafness and left school early.

A new school in Mudgee south was finished in April 1912. The same week tenders were called for a new Catholic School.

July 1914 saw tenders called for a new high school building completed in 1916.

In 1992, part of the school was burnt down by vandals. A new school was rebuilt on the site. The school currently has approximately 600 students in attendance.

As of the end of the 2008 school year, a new secondary building has been confirmed and will go from years 7–12.

<text>Bongi Makeba (20 December 1950 – 17 March 1985) was a South African singer-songwriter. She was the only child of singer Miriam Makeba with her first husband, James Kubay.

==Biography==
Angela Sibongile Makeba was born in South Africa in 1950, when her mother was 18 years old. The name Bongi by which she became known is a shortened version of her middle name Sibongile, which means &quot;We are grateful&quot;. In 1959 her mother&#x27;s career took her to New York, where she remained in exile after being barred from returning to South Africa, and in 1960 was joined by Bongi, who stayed with friends while her mother toured the world.

Bongi&#x27;s mother introduced her as a performer during a 1967 concert at New York&#x27;s Philharmonic Hall. In 1967 she and Judy White, daughter of Josh White, signed to Buddha Records as &quot;Bongi and Judy&quot;, their first release being &quot;Runnin&#x27; Out&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Together&quot;. At the age of 17, Makeba met her American husband Harold Nelson Lee, with whom in the early to mid-1970s she made two 7&quot; records as &quot;Bongi and Nelson&quot;, featuring two soul tracks arranged by George Butcher: &quot;That&#x27;s the Kind of Love&quot; backed by &quot;I Was So Glad&quot; (France: Syliphone SYL 533), and &quot;Everything, For My Love&quot; with &quot;Do You Remember, Malcolm?&quot; (France: Syliphone SYL 532). She recorded only one solo album, &quot;Bongi Makeba, Blow On Wind&quot; (pläne-records), in 1980. Some of her songs could be heard years later in her mother&#x27;s repertoire. Two of them, &quot;Malcolm X&quot; (1965, 1972) and &quot;Lumumba&quot; (1970), extol assassinated black leaders. Her mother commissioned a song from Makeba for a celebration of Mozambique&#x27;s independence in 1975; she wrote &quot;Aluta Continua&quot; (The Struggle Continues) with collaborator Bill Salter.

Makeba had three children: Nelson Lumumba Lee, born in 1968 and named for African independence activists Nelson Mandela and Patrice Lumumba; Zenzi Monique Lee (born 1971), and a son, Themba, who died as a young child. Soon after the birth of Makeba&#x27;s first child, her mother married Stokely Carmichael, which put a considerable strain on her life in the United States. The couple moved to Guinea, where Makeba joined them with her children. They lived together for a period, although Themba&#x27;s death, which occurred when Makeba was traveling, strained her relationship with her mother. The family were supported by that of Guinean president Sekou Touré, who had befriended Miriam Makeba and Carmichael, until Touré&#x27;s death in 1984. The following year, a pregnant Makeba went into premature labor, and died on 17 March 1985, aged 34, of complications after losing the unborn child. She was buried in Conakry.

<doc id="693913" wikidata="Q2689367" url="?curid=693913" title="Jebediah">
<text>Jebediah are an Australian alternative rock band formed in 1994 in Perth, Western Australia. They were formed by Chris Daymond on lead guitar, Kevin Mitchell (aka Bob Evans) on lead vocals and rhythm guitar, and Vanessa Thornton on bass guitar. They were joined a year later by Kevin&#x27;s older brother, Brett Mitchell, on drums. After winning the National Campus Band Competition, the group were brought to national attention when their 1996 single &quot;Jerks of Attention&quot; received heavy airplay on Australian alternative radio station Triple J – which was followed by their breakthrough debut album, &quot;Slightly Odway&quot; (8 September 1997).

The band released four studio albums by 2004: three entered the top ten on the ARIA Albums Chart; their second album, &quot;Of Someday Shambles&quot; (3 October 2000), is the highest charting at number two. After touring to celebrate their tenth anniversary, the band went on hiatus in 2005. Kevin Mitchell continued solo work under his pseudonym, Bob Evans. Kevin also appeared on a self-titled album in July 2010 by the Basement Birds, a supergroup which he formed with fellow musicians, Kavyen Temperley, Josh Pyke and Steve Parkin. Jebediah reconvened in 2010 and released their fifth studio album, &quot;Kosciuszko&quot;, in the following year, which charted in the ARIA top ten.

==History==

===1994–1996: Formation, &quot;Twitch&quot; EP===
Jebediah was formed in Perth in 1994 by Chris Daymond (ex-Hybrid) on lead guitar, Almin Fulurija on drums, Kevin Mitchell on vocals and rhythm guitar, and Vanessa Thornton (ex-Hybrid, lead guitar) on bass guitar, whilst they were still students at Leeming Senior High School. They are named after Jebediah Springfield, the fictional founder of Springfield on the American TV cartoon series, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Daymond and Mitchell had met in a theatre class at Leeming High School in their final year, while Daymond and Thornton knew each other from childhood and had been members of Hybrid.

By early 1995, Kevin&#x27;s older brother, Brett Mitchell, replaced Fulurija because the latter would not turn up to practice sessions, Brett had been a drummer with various groups including The Jerk Offs. In May that year Jebediah performed their first gig, for a Leeming High School formal, at the Perth Sheraton Hotel, where they played cover versions of material by Green Day, Nirvana, Pearl Jam and The Smashing Pumpkins, and one original.

They won the Western Australian semi-finals of the 1995 Australian National Campus Band Competition and in October they won the national final in Lismore. This led to an opening slot on the Summersault Music Festival before high-profile bands, Beastie Boys, Foo Fighters and Sonic Youth. Brett explained in a 2011 interview: &quot;In the very early days, everything was just a bit of a shock ... to us; it was like, it was either a shock, if it, if it actually happened, or it was, it seemed kind of absurd if someone was, ah, you know, putting an idea forward about how things would go&quot;.

In August 1996 Jebediah issued their debut five-track extended play, &quot;Twitch&quot;, which was produced by Chris Dickie (The Pogues, Morrissey, Header). According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, &quot;Twitch&quot; contained &quot;quirky tracks like &#x27;Mister Masonic&#x27; and &#x27;Tracksuit&#x27; and was a strong taster for the band&#x27;s fuzzy pop&quot;.

In April that year they had signed to Murmur, a subsidiary label of Sony Music, on the basis of their live performances. They followed with a national tour alongside Snout, and Automatic. In 2004 Daymon recalled &quot;our very first EP came out through Murmur. Right from the very start we never really self-financed any of our early material ... Thinking about it now, over the years, a lot of being in a band – for us – is touring and playing the shows; that&#x27;s always done independently anyway&quot;. At the West Australian Music Industry Awards of 1996 they won their first WAMi for Best Stage Presence. &quot;Twitch&quot; debuted at number one on the local Perth singles chart. It appeared on the ARIA Singles Chart in the top 100.

===1997–2000: &quot;Slightly Odway&quot;, &quot;Of Someday Shambles&quot;, &quot;Jebediaries&quot;===
Jebediah&#x27;s first single, &quot;Jerks of Attention&quot;, was released in December 1996 and appeared on the ARIA Singles Chart top 100 in the following month. It received national airplay on the Triple J radio network. The group&#x27;s appearances at Homebake and the Big Day Out concerts as well as support slots for Soundgarden, Everclear, The Presidents of the United States of America, Silverchair and You Am I, further raised their public profile. Another single, &quot;Leaving Home&quot;, was issued in June and reached the top 50. The group won two WAMi awards in 1997: Most Popular Band and Most Popular Song for &quot;Jerks of Attention&quot;.

In September Jebediah issued their first studio album, &quot;Slightly Odway&quot;, with Neill King (The Smiths, Madness, Elvis Costello) producing. The album&#x27;s title is &quot;a comment on the slightly odd way they feel they approach life as well as music&quot;. It peaked at number seven on the ARIA Albums Chart and remained in the top 50 for 54 weeks. Popular tracks included &quot;Leaving Home&quot; and the third single, &quot;Military Strongmen&quot; (November 1997). &quot;Slightly Odway&quot; also reached number two on the ARIA alternative charts, and within four months it was certified gold.

Jonathan Lewis of Allmusic felt it showed them &quot;as a talented young band, despite the flimsy songwriting and the lack of light and shade on the album&quot;. While Greg Lawrence at WHAMMO.com.au noted that it provides &quot;a mature, complete range – from the early-penned punk mayhem of &#x27;Blame&#x27; to the delicacy of the &#x27;Twilight=Dusk&#x27;, from the dark tones of &#x27;Jerks of Attention&#x27; to the bright strains of radio hit &#x27;Leaving Home&#x27;. The album does a great job of capturing the amazing live dynamic of the band&quot;.

&quot;Leaving Home&quot; was rated number 10 in the Triple J Hottest 100 music poll for 1997. &quot;Slightly Odway&quot; eventually received a double-platinum certificate (140,000 units shipped), with two more top 50 singles, &quot;Teflon&quot; (March 1998) and &quot;Harpoon&quot; (on the EP of the same name, June), adding to the group&#x27;s chart success. Murmur label mates, Something for Kate, provided a cover version of &quot;Harpoon&quot; on the EP. Murmur also issued a split-EP with both versions of &quot;Harpoon&quot; backed with Something for Kate&#x27;s &quot;Clint&quot; and Jebediah&#x27;s cover version of that track.

Jebediah supported United States alternative rockers, The Smashing Pumpkins, on the Australian leg of their 1998 tour in May. Jebediah released their second album, &quot;Of Someday Shambles&quot;, in November 1999, with producer Mark Trombino (Knapsack, Blink 182). McFarlane noted that it &quot;was brimming with youthful exuberance and feisty, melodic, guitar-based fuzzy punk-pop perfectly suited to the post-grunge alternative generation&quot;. Lawrence felt it was &quot;sporting tonnes more light and shade than their first effort and stretching out in the studio ... honing its craft, growing up in public in the most enviable of ways&quot;.

The album peaked at number two on the ARIA Albums Chart – their highest peaking release – and remained in the top 50 for 25 weeks. While its lead single, &quot;Animal&quot; (August 1999), reached number 16 and is their highest charting single to date. The band toured Canada and New Zealand and won further WAMi awards with Best Video for &quot;Harpoon&quot;, and Thornton winning Best Bass Player. By December 2000, &quot;Of Someday Shambles&quot; received a platinum certificate from ARIA.

The group started 2000 by playing its second Big Day Out tour. They continued touring internationally playing the US, Canada and New Zealand. Daymon recalled &quot;There have been times, especially after &quot;Someday Shambles&quot;, when our popularity in Australia had really surprised us and we were playing to huge crowds at the Big Day Out and we&#x27;d had two really successful records. We were a little dismayed as to why we couldn&#x27;t push it further into the overseas area. Unfortunately it seemed to be the politics of working with a record on a major label that held us back. It&#x27;s not much of an incentive for a label overseas to make you a priority if a lot of the profit is going back to the company where the band is from&quot;. In August, the group issued a six-track split EP with Jimmy Eat World, &quot;Jebediah / Jimmy Eat World&quot; in the US through independent label, Big Wheel Recreation.

In October 2000 Sony issued a video compilation album, &quot;Jebediaries&quot;, in VHS format for PAL systems, which contained their music videos and concert footage. It was followed in December by the DVD version which added a bonus track, &quot;Animal&quot; (live). Andrew Siers at MichaelDVD described it as &quot;mainly a collection of the band&#x27;s greatest hits in video clip form, but in between songs it is also a documentary. These sections of the feature are quite interesting and kept my attention at all times&quot;.

===2001–2003: Self-titled album, split from Sony, &quot;Gleesides &amp; Sparities&quot;===
The band recorded their third studio album, &quot;Jebediah&quot;, from June to August 2001, with production by Magoo (Regurgitator, Spiderbait, Midnight Oil). The album was not released until March the following year. Lawrence opined that it &quot;sees a band in their element, brimming with confidence. Led by the tracks &#x27;Fall Down&#x27; and &#x27;Nothing Lasts Forever&#x27;&quot;. Ed Nimmervoll at Howlspace described their aim &quot;for the third album they resolved to try to have fun again, recorded relatively quickly&quot;. Whilst it debuted at number eight on the charts, it did not achieve gold status. Its lead single &quot;Fall Down&quot; had reached number 24 in late October 2001.

Music videos were filmed for the three singles released from the album, &quot;Fall Down&quot;, &quot;Nothing Lasts Forever&quot; and &quot;NDC&quot;. On 25 May 2002 the group were guest programmers on ABC-TV&#x27;s video program, &quot;rage&quot;, and played 12 of their music videos including &quot;Fall Down&quot; and &quot;Nothing Lasts Forever&quot;.
&quot;Glee Sides and Sparities&quot;, a compilation of B-sides and rare tracks, the band&#x27;s final album with Murmur, was released in January 2003 and the band subsequently left Sony in the following month to continue as an independent act. Lawrence summarised &quot;[it] combines the best b-sides and covers and adds the extra incentive of two fresh, unreleased tracks. For hungry Jebediah fans it will complete their collections and with 18 tracks there&#x27;s plenty of fuzzy rock on offer&quot;.

===2004–2010: &quot;Braxton Hicks&quot;, 10th anniversary, Hiatus===
In June 2004 Daymond told WHAMMO.com.au &quot;I think [Sony Records] knew that we were looking to do something a little different. As a company they&#x27;d just gone through some major infrastructure changes in the last few years and I think by talking to us and realising that we were maybe not as happy as we were on the label when we signed – that the label had changed a lot and the roster was completely different&quot;. In an interview for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in May 2011, Thornton told music journalist, Andrew McMillen, that the band&#x27;s manager at the time &quot;couldn&#x27;t be fucked fighting the label for anything that we wanted, and he&#x27;d made the decision that we were just going to go with whatever the label reckoned. Near the end, it was fucking soul-destroying for me&quot;.

In July 2004 Jebediah issued their fourth studio album, &quot;Braxton Hicks&quot;, which was produced by the band itself and appeared on their own record label, Redline Records, distributed by Shock Records. Redline Records had been set up in July 2000 with their then-manager, Heath Bradby, of Naked Ape Management. The album is named for the intermittent weak contractions which some pregnant women experience. Daymond reflected on the recording process &quot;Because it was self-produced as well, there was no one in the producer&#x27;s chair to tie the whole thing together. We&#x27;ve had to do that ourselves. We&#x27;re a very close band but it was even more of a bonding experience in the recording studio, where we had to motivate each other to do our best and I think it&#x27;s paid off&quot;.

Lawrence praised the group&#x27;s decision to leave their previous label, &quot;[they] seem reborn and the subsequent autonomy and enthusiasm have combined to deliver the bestest Jebs album in memory ... [they] have reached that point where every element is under their control – from production to business – and if &quot;Braxton Hicks&quot; is the end product of that control, every signed band should rip up their major label contracts immediately&quot;. It debuted at number 26 while its lead single, &quot;First Time&quot;, made the top 50. During August and September that year they toured Australia to promote the album. In June 2005 Jebediah launched their 10-year anniversary tour and released the five-track &quot;Anniversary E.P.&quot; to coincide. Their shows consisted mainly of B-sides and rarities which fans had requested on the band&#x27;s official internet forums.
In late 2005, after completing their 10th-anniversary tour, Jebediah decided to take an indefinite break. While a member of Jebediah, Kevin Mitchell had started a parallel solo career using the pseudonym, Bob Evans, from 1999. His first solo album &quot;Suburban Kid&quot; was issued in September 2003. During 2006 to 2007, Kevin released and then promoted his second solo album, &quot;Suburban Songbook&quot; and had relocated to Melbourne in 2008. Brett began drumming for Perth band, The Fuzz. Thornton joined Felicity Groom&#x27;s backing band, The Black Black Smoke. That group includes Alex Archer (The Kill Devil Hills), Andrew Ryan (Adam Said Galore) and Mat Marsh. In 2009 they won a WAMi Award for Best Indie Pop Act.

Aside from Jebediah commitments, Daymond works in a record store in Perth. Following Mitchell&#x27;s 2007 solo tour, he said that Jebediah would return to start recording their next album. They returned for a festival appearance at the Rollercoaster 07 Music Carnival, held at the Western Foreshore in Mandurah on 29 December, where they appeared alongside Hilltop Hoods, The Black Keys, Shihad, Kisschasy, Birds of Tokyo and Ash Grunwald. In September 2008 the group also played gigs in Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane. The shows were sold out despite little advertising and largely relying on word of mouth.

Kevin released his third studio album, &quot;Goodnight, Bull Creek!&quot;, in April 2009. The following year, he formed Basement Birds with Kavyen Temperley of Eskimo Joe, Josh Pyke, and Steve Parkin (studio musician for &quot;Goodnight, Bull Creek&quot;). They released their debut self-titled album in July 2010 and played a headlining tour in addition to festival dates.

===2011–present: Reunion, &quot;Kosciuszko&quot; and &quot;Oiks&quot;===
Jebediah returned to the studio in 2010 to rehearse old material and write more music for their fifth studio album, &quot;Kosciuszko&quot;, which appeared on 15 April 2011 on the Dew Process label. Due to Kevin&#x27;s other musical commitments, recording for the album had occurred sporadically since early 2008. &quot;Kosciuszko&quot; was produced by the group members, who created it without any time constraints. Brett explained in a 2011 interview:
The best thing for us was the freedom we had to make it. We had all the time we wanted on it. With Kevin being in Melbourne we&#x27;d take a week here and there and we could work and shape the songs more with that freedom and time ... there were periods where, for example, Kevin was the only one in the studio with the rest of us all working or doing whatever.

According to Brett Mitchell, all four band members were satisfied with the outcome of the recording sessions and it was &quot;a more unanimous feeling than it has been in the past.&quot; Kevin also reflected on making the album:
It&#x27;s a very different record for us and I&#x27;m really excited about it. It&#x27;s the first real &quot;studio&quot; album we have ever made. Every other album has been recorded quite traditionally. We write a bunch of songs, play them live a bunch of times and then go in to studio and bash them out in a few weeks. This time round we had barely played the songs live, we wrote a few of them in the studio and we really used the studio as an instrument.

The album debuted at number six and stayed in the top 50 for five weeks. Richard Kingsmill premiered the lead single, &quot;Lost My Nerve&quot;, on his Triple J music show on 17 October 2010. The second single, &quot;She&#x27;s Like a Comet&quot;, was released in January 2011, with an accompanying music video, and became the most added single to radio airplay. &quot;She&#x27;s Like a Comet&quot; peaked at number four on the ARIA Australian Artists Singles Chart, number 47 on the ARIA Singles Chart, and reached number 29 on the Australian Music Report Top 100 Airplay Chart.

The group toured nationally to promote the album throughout the remainder of 2011, playing at the Splendour in the Grass festival and then visiting regional locations from Broome to Mount Hotham. They also performed at the National Youth Week 2011 launch event in Melbourne and appeared on morning TV program, &quot;Sunrise&quot;, to perform &quot;She&#x27;s Like a Comet&quot;. Matt Hogan of &quot;X-Press&quot; magazine attributed the success of the fifth album to Kevin&#x27;s solo work as Bob Evans, and as a member of the Basement Birds.

On 13 April 2011, the band uploaded a 13-minute documentary film onto YouTube, &quot;Welcome to Kosciuszko&quot;, which was released in conjunction with Dew Process and filmed by an Australian-based production company, The Grindhouse (directed by Brent Quincy Buchanan and filmed by Harry Joaquin Charnock). It relates the band&#x27;s history, featuring interviews with all four members.

Released following the band&#x27;s hiatus, the documentary serves as both a re-introduction of the band to the public arena, but also a reflection upon the past. Thornton described her perspective:
We were so caught up in our own wild ride that we were being swept along doing what we were doing, and, I mean, at the time, we were meeting all these bands that we idolised and, and, were big fans of ... and, um, got to play gigs with them all ... The first tour we went on, then led into the next tour and, before we knew it, we were on the road to pretty much ten years solid.

Kevin explained:
We didn&#x27;t really have aspirations to make records at that point, when we first started out; it was all about playing live, really. You know, enjoying each other&#x27;s company, and writing songs, and gettin&#x27; stoned, partying and having fun ... Once we started, which was 1996, we didn&#x27;t really stop until 2005. And, yeah, like I said, we were proud of how much we toured. We were-it was a badge of honour to play as much as possible.

Daymond reflected:
Without, sort of, having to organise it too much, we were all committed to the band to see how far it would go; and I think everyone was really happy with where it ended up taking us ... We were 17 when we started touring, um ... it was really awesome to be involved with a label like Murmur as well—Murmur had a lot of really cool bands on the roster; I mean, just getting invited to see a Silverchair gig, or something like that, was really exciting.

The band&#x27;s perspective on the Murmur label is further elucidated; Thornton states: &quot;There&#x27;s no way we would&#x27;ve done what we did if Murmur wasn&#x27;t our label&quot;, while Brett explained: &quot;Because even though they were part of a much bigger company [Sony], um, we were shielded from a lot of that&quot;.

On 28 September 2012 Jebediah performed at the Rock Lily venue, part of the Star Casino complex in Sydney with The Sculptures and Conrad Greenleaf as their support acts. On 24 November they played at the Super Saturday horse racing event at the Ascot Raceway, Perth.

In January 2013 on web-based publication, &quot;Tone Deaf&quot;, Kevin described the songwriting process with his &quot;best mates&quot; as &quot;a real democratic process, it&#x27;s like trying to pass legislation&quot;. Kevin elaborated on the future of the group in March while promoting his fourth solo (Bob Evans) album: &quot;I don&#x27;t know, I like to think there will be [more to come]. I&#x27;d love to make another Jebediah record but at this stage we haven&#x27;t even got together or started writing or anything yet so it&#x27;s too far away to really be able to tell&quot;.

During January 2014 the band played locations in New South Wales, from Dee Why to Ulladulla. On 23 August 2014, Jebediah was the headline act at the Eaton Hills &quot;FMX Extreme Weekend&quot; in Queensland, Australia.

In March 2015 Jebediah announced that they would be undertaking a 20th Anniversary tour in June that year, performing fan favourites and surprises in the first set, then their 1997 debut album &quot;Slightly Odway&quot; in its entirety. To coincide with the tour they announced that they would be releasing a new compilation album, &quot;Twenty&quot;, on 29 May.

In September 2023, Jebediah released &quot;Gum Up the Bearings&quot;, their first new single in over a decade. That same month, it was announced that the band would be inducted into the WAM Hall of Fame that November. Following a national tour in support of &quot;Gum Up the Bearings&quot;, the band announced their sixth studio album &quot;OIKS&quot;. It is set for release on 12 April 2024 via Cooking Vinyl Australia. To coincide with the announcement, the band also shared a new single entitled &quot;Rubberman&quot;.

==Cover versions==

In June 1998 Something for Kate recorded a cover version of &quot;Harpoon&quot; which was released on the &quot;Harpoon&quot; EP alongside Jebediah&#x27;s version. Jebediah provided a cover version of Something for Kate&#x27;s track &quot;Clint&quot; on a split EP which also had each bands&#x27; versions of &quot;Harpoon&quot;. In September 1998 Australian band Ratcat covered &quot;Blame&quot; from &quot;Slightly Odway&quot; and released it as a B-side.

Jebediah performed a cover version of the Bacharach and David-written track, &quot;Raindrops Keep Fallin&#x27; on My Head&quot;, for Triple J&#x27;s &quot;Like a Version&quot; radio segment – it was compiled on the various artists&#x27; album &quot;Like a Version&quot;, which was issued in 2005. In the following year Gyroscope covered &quot;Monument&quot; (B-side of &quot;Leaving Home&quot;, 1997) which was compiled on &quot;Like a Version: Volume Two&quot;. Jebediah&#x27;s version of &quot;Apartment&quot; (1995 single) by Custard appeared on &quot;Like a Version: Volume Eight&quot; (2012). In 2011 The Grates performed a cover version of &quot;Please Leave&quot; for a &quot;Like a Version&quot; segment.

==Redline Records==

In July 2000 Jebediah, in partnership with Naked Ape Management (run by their talent manager, Heath Bradby), launched an independent licensing label, Redline Records, which was distributed through the Australian company, Shock Records. Kevin explained:
I think we were all pretty naive about what we, what we were achieving—we were having too much fun to get kind of caught up. We&#x27;d just released our second album overseas on an independent label; and, spent time in America as an independent act. And that was around about the time where we started our own label, just to, um, release, maybe, release a few, some bands of friends of ours, in bands.

Before the official dissolution of the label in December 2011, Redline Records had released recordings from Adam Said Galore, Jimmy Eat World, Blueline Medic, Big Heavy Stuff, Gyroscope, and Sekiden. It also released Jebediah&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Braxton Hicks&quot; (July 2004), and their &quot;Anniversary E.P.&quot; (June 2005).

== Other projects ==
Jebediah members have been involved in various other projects. Kevin has achieved commercial success with his solo project, Bob Evans. His fourth studio album, &quot;Familiar Stranger&quot;, appeared in March 2013. It was preceded by an EP, &quot;The Double Life&quot;, in November 2012 and a national tour of Australia. Kevin stated during an &quot;Unplugged and Wired&quot; performance for Google+ on 28 November 2012 that the EP&#x27;s title applied to both his concurrent work with Jebediah, in addition to his new role as father and husband.

Brett and Thornton have joined an English singer–songwriter, Addison Axe, to form a group, Axe Girl; which is based in Perth. They have performed at local venues, including Hyde Park Hotel. They released their debut EP, &quot;Ghost Romance&quot;, as a free download in October 2012, which was launched at The Norfolk Basement Hotel, Fremantle.

&quot;Ghost Romance&quot; was accompanied by a video scrapbook showing excerpts from the recording process, which was uploaded to the band&#x27;s YouTube page. By 24 October 2012, the band had signed with Perth music management company, Tyranocorp (Cal Peck &amp; The Tramps, Fear of Comedy). In September 2013, they published photos from a video shoot for their track, &quot;Give Me Your Tee Shirt&quot;, which was filmed in Perth. The band&#x27;s self-titled debut album—funded by a crowdfunding campaign—is scheduled for an 8 November 2014 release, followed by a national Australian tour.

Thornton has also played with other Perth-based groups: End of Fashion, and Felicity Groom and the Black, Black Smoke. In a September 2009 interview, Thornton revealed that &quot;Chris mostly keeps to himself and does his crazy paintings&quot;. As of 2012, Daymond is a member of a Nirvana cover band, Nirvanarama (not to be confused with an Ipswich, United Kingdom band of that name), alongside members of other groups, Gyroscope and Karnivool. Nirvanarama&#x27;s debut live performance was in December 2011 at The Hen House, Perth. The group maintains a Facebook fan page and a Twitter account.

==Personal lives==
Kevin married long-term girlfriend, Kristen, in November 2006 and in December 2008 they relocated from Perth to Seddon, an inner-west suburb of Melbourne. As of March 2013, Kevin and Kristen are the parents of a baby, and reside in Deer Park. Speaking on his personal life prior to the release of &quot;Familiar Stranger&quot;, Kevin revealed &quot;I have zero social life. I have no hobbies, I have nothing else except making music and being a father&quot;. Kevin relocated with his family to coastal Victoria in early 2014.

Daymond married his partner, Belinda, in a Western Australian outdoor location, The Quarry, in December 2012, with Kevin and Thornton in attendance. An Irish dance performance was part of the wedding ceremony.

<text>Skógar (pronounced ), literally &quot;forests&quot;, is a small Icelandic village with a population of roughly 25 located at the south of the Eyjafjallajökull glacier, in the municipality of Rangárþing eystra.

The area is known for its waterfall, Skógafoss, on the Skógá river, which springs from 60 metres at the top of an eroded cliff. At Skógar is a folk museum, Skógasafn , as well as a museum on transport in Iceland.

Not far from Skógar is the Kvernufoss fall. Further upstream on the Skógá river there are a number of other falls. While climbing in the small forest behind the old school, some ruins of old farms can be seen.

This settlement was severely affected by the eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in 2010.

<text>The Blue Bird () is a 1908 play by Belgian playwright and poet Maurice Maeterlinck. It premiered on 30 September 1908 at Konstantin Stanislavski&#x27;s Moscow Art Theatre, and was presented on Broadway in 1910. It was translated into English by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos. In 1919 Maeterlinck was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. 

The French composer Albert Wolff wrote an opera (first performed at the New York Metropolitan Opera in 1919) based on Maeterlinck&#x27;s original play, and Maeterlinck&#x27;s inamorata Georgette Leblanc produced a novelization.

The story is about a girl called &quot;Mytyl&quot; and her brother &quot;Tyltyl&quot; seeking happiness, represented by &quot;The Blue Bird of Happiness&quot;, aided by the good fairy &quot;Bérylune&quot;.

Maeterlinck also wrote a relatively little known sequel to &quot;The Blue Bird&quot; titled &quot;The Betrothal; or, The Blue Bird Chooses&quot;.

The play has been adapted for several films and a TV series.

==Story==

In the opening scene, the two children gleefully describe the beautiful decorations and rich desserts that they see in the house of a wealthy family nearby. When Bérylune says that it is wrong for the rich not to share their cakes with Tyltyl and Mytyl, the boy corrects her. It is enough that he gets to watch others’ happiness; their joy does not create envy in him. The theme is emphasized again when the children meet the Luxuries, particularly the biggest one of all, the Luxury of Being Rich. When Tyltyl turns the diamond, the hall is bathed with a dazzling brightness, and the Luxuries run wildly in search of a dark corner where they may hide their ugliness from the ethereal light.

At the end of the play, Tyltyl shows what he has learned about happiness. He looks out the window at the forest and remarks how beautiful it is. The inside of the house looks much lovelier to him than it did before. Also, he creates great happiness for another by giving his pet bird, which seems much bluer than before, to the sick child.

The Scouting Nederland section for children with special needs (Extension Scouting) is named: &quot;Blauwe Vogels&quot; (Blue Birds).

Celebrating the 100th anniversary of &quot;Maurice Maeterlinck&#x27;s greatest contemporary success &quot;The Blue Bird&quot;&quot;, as it was termed, his play was selected as the main motif of a high-value collectors&#x27; coin: the Belgian 50 euro Maurice Maeterlinck commemorative coin, minted in 2008.

<doc id="693925" wikidata="Q2306368" url="?curid=693925" title="Teatro Comunale di Bologna">
<text>The Teatro Comunale di Bologna is an opera house in Bologna, Italy. Typically, it presents eight operas with six performances during its November to April season.

While there had been various theatres presenting opera in Bologna since the early 17th century, they had either fallen into disuse or burnt down. However, from the early 18th century, the &quot;Teatro Marsigli-Rossi&quot; had been presenting operatic works by popular composers of the day including Vivaldi, Gluck, and Niccolò Piccinni. The &quot;Teatro Malvezzi&quot;, built in 1651, burned down in February 1745 and this event prompted the construction of a new public theatre, the &quot;Nuovo Teatro Pubblico&quot;, as the Teatro Comunale was first called when it opened on 14 May 1763.

==Design and inauguration==
Despite opposition from other competitors, the architect Antonio Galli Bibiena won the theatre design contract. The theatre&#x27;s inaugural performance was Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Il trionfo di Clelia&quot;, an opera which Gluck had composed for the occasion. A bell-shaped auditorium consisting of four tiers of boxes plus a royal box and small gallery with a ceiling decorated as if open to the sky, was built primarily of masonry as a protection against fire. However, much work remained unfinished, the facade in particular which was not completed until 1936. Also, many of the backstage facilities which would allow for the presentations of operas were unfinished and only completed due to competition from another theatre in 1805.

It was to be the first major opera house to be constructed with public funds and owned by the municipality. Although 35 of its 99 boxes were sold for private use, the terms of ownership were also unique in that they have been described as being limited to &quot;the right to rent in perpetuity&quot; rather than outright ownership and control.

Various renovations were undertaken between 1818 and 1820 and also in 1853/54. After fire destroyed much of the stage area in 1931, the theatre was closed, and it did not re-open until 14 November 1935. By that date, the original bell-shaped auditorium had given way to a horseshoe-shaped one seating 1,034 people.

==Associated music history==

The 19th century saw the presentation of twenty operas by Gioachino Rossini, while seven of Vincenzo Bellini&#x27;s ten operas were presented in the 1830s. Works by Giuseppe Verdi and, later in 1871, the Italian premiere of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, dominated the theatre&#x27;s repertoire as the century progressed. In fact, Bologna became the location for several other Wagner opera premieres in Italy, notably with the composer present for his &quot;Rienzi&quot; and the &quot;Parsifal&quot; premiere on 1 January 1914.

Another major figure associated with the &quot;Teatro Comunale&quot; from 1894 onwards was Arturo Toscanini, who conducted Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot; in that year and conducted with the company until the Second World War.

Premieres at the house have included Alessandro Solbiati&#x27;s &quot;Il suono giallo&quot;, based on Wassily Kandinsky&#x27;s experimental play &quot;The Yellow Sound&quot; on 13 June 2015.

The orchestra of the company was established on a stable foundation in 1956. Sergiu Celibidache was the first principal conductor under this new regime, from 1956 to 1973. The most recent principal conductor of the company was Michele Mariotti, from 2008 to 2018, and he also held the title of music director from 2014 to 2018.

In March 2021, Oksana Lyniv made her first guest-conducting appearance with the company, in a streamed quarantine concert without an audience. She returned for an additional guest-conducting appearance in a May 2021 concert with an audience present. In October 2021, the Teatro Comunale di Bologna announced the appointment of Lyniv as its new music director, effective January 2022, with an initial contract of 3 years. Lyniv is the first female conductor to be named music director of the company, and the first female conductor ever to be named music director of an Italian opera company.

<text>Búðardalur () is a village situated on the Hvammsfjörður in the north-west of Iceland.

The village also lies at the north-eastern end of the Snæfellsnes peninsula and is part of the municipality of Dalabyggð. Búðardalur had about 270 inhabitants in 2014 and is a service center for the area, including the regional tourist information centre. In the traditional system of counties of Iceland that existed until the late 1980s, it was part of Dalasýsla, a name that is still used for the region.

==Overview==
Búðardalur contains a supermarket and a petrol station, hair salons, a pub/restaurant, a coffee shop, a health-care centre, an off-licence, a garage and a craft shop; the information centre is in the same building as a cafe and a museum on the Vínland expeditions.

The village has a long history, dating from the time of the first settlements in Iceland. The name means &quot;Camp Valley&quot;, or more etymologically straightforward &quot;Boothdale&quot;; it is where settlers had temporary camps when coming to the area. In 1899, Búðardalur was officially granted the right of commerce. An old house from this time still exists.

At a short distance from the village is Eiríksstaðir, the homestead of Erik the Red, who was the first European to discover Greenland and whose son Leif Erikson, born at Eiríksstaðir, was the first European to discover America ahead of Columbus.

==Climate==
Depending on the isotherm used ( or ), Búðardalur has either the rare dry-summer subarctic climate (Köppen: &quot;Dsc&quot;) or the extremely rare cold-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csc) with cold but not severe winters and cool summers.

<text>In mathematics, a trinomial expansion is the expansion of a power of a sum of three terms into monomials. The expansion is given by

:formula_1

where is a nonnegative integer and the sum is taken over all combinations of nonnegative indices and such that . The trinomial coefficients are given by

:formula_2

This formula is a special case of the multinomial formula for . The coefficients can be defined with a generalization of Pascal&#x27;s triangle to three dimensions, called Pascal&#x27;s pyramid or Pascal&#x27;s tetrahedron.

==Derivation==
The trinomial expansion can be calculated by applying the binomial expansion twice, setting formula_3, which leads to

:formula_4

Above, the resulting formula_5 in the second line is evaluated by the second application of the binomial expansion, introducing another summation over the index formula_6.

The product of the two binomial coefficients is simplified by shortening formula_7,
:formula_8

and comparing the index combinations here with the ones in the exponents, they can be relabelled to formula_9, which provides the expression given in the first paragraph.

== Properties ==
The number of terms of an expanded trinomial is the triangular number

:formula_10

where is the exponent to which the trinomial is raised.

== Example ==
An example of a trinomial expansion with formula_11 is :

<text>D. Jayakanthan (24 April 1934 – 8 April 2015), popularly known as JK, was an Indian writer, journalist, orator, filmmaker, critic and activist. Born in Cuddalore, he dropped out of school at the age of 9 and went to Madras, where he joined the Communist Party of India. In a career spanning six decades, he authored around 40 novels, 200 short stories, apart from two autobiographies. Outside literature, he made two films. In addition, four of his other novels were adapted into films by others.

Jayakanthan&#x27;s literary honours include Jnanpith and Sahitya Akademi awards. He was also a recipient of Padma Bhushan (2009), India&#x27;s third-highest civilian honour, the Soviet Land Nehru Award (1978), and the Russian government&#x27;s Order of Friendship (2011).

==Biography==
Jayakanthan was born in 1934 into a family of agriculturists in Manjakuppam, a suburb of Cuddalore, a part of the South Arcot District of the erstwhile Madras Presidency. Brought up by his mother and maternal uncles, he got interested in politics at a young age as his uncles were actively involved in it. As a child, he was highly inspired by the works of Subramania Bharati. Jayakanthan dropped himself out of school after completing fifth grade, as he thought studies would hinder his political activism. 

In 1946, he left for Madras (now Chennai) in search of livelihood, where he performed odd jobs, before ending up as a compositor in the printing press of Communist Party of India (CPI). His association with the CPI, instilled the ideas of the movement, where he got to accompany leaders such as P. Jeevanandham, Baladandayutham and S. Ramakrishnan. The leaders of the party encouraged him to write. After graduating to an active member of the party, he got to learn about topics pertaining to world literature, culture, politics, economics and journalism. It was during this time, Jayakanthan started writing for pro-communist magazines. Over the next few years, he established himself as one of the top-most writers in the party. His early works were first published in the party newspaper &quot;Janasakthi&quot;, and soon other magazines like &quot;Sarasvathi&quot;, &quot;Thamarai&quot;, &quot;Santhi&quot;, &quot;Manithan&quot;, &quot;Sakthi&quot; and &quot;Samaran&quot; published his works. His early works focussed on the plight of slum-dwellers who were settled in and around the party office.

Jayakanthan wrote his first short story for a Tamil magazine titled &quot;Sowbakiyavathi&quot;, which got it published in 1953. Following early success, Jayakanthan started writing for mainstream magazines such as &quot;Ananda Vikatan&quot;, &quot;Kumudam&quot; and &quot;Dinamani Kadir&quot;, who published a number of short-stories particularly in the 1960s. In 1964, Jayakanthan entered films by co-producing and directing a venture titled &quot;Unnaipol Oruvan&quot;, based on his novel. The film focussed on the plight of slum-dwellers. Although a commercial failure, it won the President&#x27;s Certificate of Merit for the Third Best Feature Film in 1965. The following year he made another film based on his namesake novel &quot;Yaarukkaga Azhudhaan&quot; which had Nagesh playing the lead role. His novel &quot;Sila Nerangalil Sila Manithargal&quot; (1970) won him the Sahitya Akademi Award (for Tamil) in 1972. Later this was adapted into a film of the same name by A. Bhimsingh, which won a National Film Award. Promoted by the film&#x27;s success, Bhimsingh made one more film tilted &quot;Oru Nadigai Naadagam Paarkiral&quot;, based on his namesake novel.

In 2008, Ravisubramaniyan made a documentary film on Jayakanthan, the second of its kind, and was produced by Ilaiyaraaja. In 2011, &quot;Sila Nerangalil Sila Manithargal&quot; was adapted into a Malayalam television series &quot;Chila Nerangalil Chila Manushyar&quot;. In February 2014, Jayakanthan was admitted into a private hospital in Chennai following illness. Following a brief illness, he was discharged after a year, and died on 8 April 2015.

In 2017 his award-winning novel &quot;Oru Manithan Oru Veedu Oru Ulagam&quot; is being made as a feature film by award-winning filmmaker Kumar G. Venkatesh.

A musical tribute to Jayakanthan was released by Bava Chelladurai, Bharathi Baskar and Jeyamohan on 24th April 2023 as part of Jayakanthan&#x27;s birthday celebration. Composer Rajan Somasundaram selected three of Jayakanthan&#x27;s poems and created the musical tribute sung by Sathyaprakash. 

==Personal life, influences and political views==
Jayakanthan was married to his cousin Gnanambikai, who worked as a primary school teacher. The couple had two daughters and a son - J Kadambari, J Jayasimhan, and J Deepalakshmi. Born in a family that had a lot of political activists, Jayakanthan became interested in politics at a young age. He became a strong supporter of the CPI ever since joining the party in the 1950s. He was coaxed to join politics by K. Baladhandayutham of the CPI. While he stood up against the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and its leaders for a majority of his lifetime, he supported the CPI leaders for &quot;Nehruvian socialism&quot; and had a great admiration Indira Gandhi. He quit the CPI, and later joined the Tamil Desiyak Katchi, founded by E. V. K. Sampath, before joining the Indian National Congress. He remarked the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam as a &quot;fascist&quot; organisation.

==Literary style and themes==
A majority of Jayakanthan&#x27;s works revolve around the lives of underclass people like rickshaw-pullers, prostitutes and rag-pickers. In an interview, he said that during his initial days in Chennai he spent his life amidst such people. This prompted him to develop a liking towards them.

==Criticism==
Prolific Tamil writer Jeyamohan has written numerous articles about the fictional world in Jayakanthan&#x27;s works, and also had extensively discussed it in his book &quot;Mannum Marabum&quot; along with several other authors. Major Tamil critic M. Vedhasagayakumar has made a comparative study on the works of Jayakanthan and Pudhumaipithan. Jayanthasri Balakrishnan did her doctoral research study in Tamil on complete novellas of Jayakanthan.

A full-length documentary made by filmmaker Ravi Subramaniam and other essays by several Tamil writers written after the death of the writer are also considered notableworks on him.

<text>Michael Moran (born 4 March 1948) is an English musician, songwriter, composer and record producer.

==Biography==
Moran studied at the Royal College of Music in London prior to becoming a session musician and a composer and arranger. His work in the latter field includes scoring music for such HandMade Films productions as &quot;Time Bandits&quot; (1981), &quot;The Missionary&quot; (1982) and &quot;Water&quot; (1985). His other film scores included &quot;Bloodbath at the House of Death&quot; (1984), &quot;The Turnaround&quot; (1995), &quot;A Fox&#x27;s Tale&quot; (2008), &quot;Blessed&quot; (2008) and &quot;A Thousand Kisses Deep&quot; (2011), as well as arranging the score to &quot;Death Wish 3&quot; (1985), and his TV work includes providing music for &quot;Strangers&quot; (1978), &quot;Harry&#x27;s Game&quot; (1982), &quot;Taggart&quot; (1985), &quot;The Bombmaker&quot; (2001), and &quot;&quot; (2002). He also played with the Ian Gillan Band.

&quot;Rock Bottom&quot;, which he wrote in partnership with Lynsey de Paul, was the UK entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1977, and put him in the spotlight for the first time. Although leading early on in the voting, the song eventually came second in the contest. Nevertheless, it went on to become a Top 20 hit in many European countries including France, Germany, Austria and Switzerland, where it reached the top of their singles chart. It was more successful in Continental Europe than in the United Kingdom and was also covered by many local artists in a number of different languages.

De Paul and Moran continued there successful songwriting partnership, notably writing &quot;Let Your Body Go Downtown&quot;, a UK Top 40 hit for the Martyn Ford Orchestra, and the follow-up single &quot;Going to a Disco&quot;, as well as the songs &quot;Without You&quot; and &quot;Now and Then&quot;, which appeared on the de Paul albums &quot;Tigers and Fireflies&quot; (1979) and &quot;Just a Little Time&quot; (1994) respectively.

For many years. Moran was the musical director for the UK ITV children&#x27;s music series &quot;Get It Together&quot;, performing each week, accompanying the various studio guests and playing the theme music. He had another attempt at writing a UK Eurovision entry in 1990, when he wrote &quot;That Old Feeling Again&quot; for Stephen Lee Garden, which placed fifth out of the eight songs in the UK song selection competition.

Other songs co-written by Moran are &quot;Snot Rap&quot; (recorded by Kenny Everett), as well as &quot;No Mean City&quot; (the theme to the crime drama &quot;Taggart&quot;, sung by Maggie Bell), &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot; (the theme to the crime drama &quot;New Tricks&quot;, sung by Dennis Waterman) and the music for the UK game series &quot;Chain Letters&quot;, &quot;Lucky Ladders&quot;, &quot;The Krypton Factor&quot;. 
Moran has worked with Ozzy Osbourne, Nicko McBrain, George Harrison, and various members of Queen. He was co-producer, arranger, keyboard player, and co-author of all the tracks on the album &quot;Barcelona&quot;, the classical crossover collaboration of Queen frontman Freddie Mercury and opera singer Montserrat Caballé, released in 1988. He produced &quot;The Queen Album&quot; (1988), &quot;Piaf&quot; (1994) and &quot;Essential Musicals&quot; (2006) for Elaine Paige.

More recently, Moran appeared in &quot;Dragons&#x27; Den&quot; (series 7, episode 3) as the musical director of a Dusty Springfield musical, and also produced the Tommy Fleming album &quot;The West&#x27;s Awake&quot; (2014).

<text>The Leipzig Opera () is an opera house and opera company located at the Augustusplatz and the Inner City Ring Road at its east side in Leipzig&#x27;s district Mitte, Germany.

==History==
Performances of opera in Leipzig trace back to Singspiel performances beginning in the year 1693. The composer of many early operas at the first opera house, the Oper am Brühl, was Telemann. He was director of the house from 1703 to 1705.

The Leipzig Opera does not have its own opera orchestra – the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra performs as its orchestra. This relationship began in 1766 with performances of the Singspiel &quot; by Johann Adam Hiller.

==Opera House, 1868==
The previous theater (the &quot;) was inaugurated on 28 January 1868 with &quot;Jubilee Overture&quot; by Carl Maria von Weber and the overture for &quot;Iphigénie en Aulide&quot; by Gluck and Goethe&#x27;s play &quot;Iphigenia in Tauris&quot;. From 1886 to 1888, Gustav Mahler was the second conductor; Arthur Nikisch was his superior. During an air raid in the night of 3 December 1943, part of the bombing of Leipzig in World War II, the theater was destroyed, as were all of Leipzig&#x27;s theatres.

==Opera House, 1960==
Construction of the modern opera house began in 1956. The theater was inaugurated on 8 October 1960 with a performance of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;.

Ulf Schirmer became &quot;Generalmusikdirektor&quot; (General Music Director, or GMD) of the company in 2009. He was elected artistic director (&quot;Intendant&quot;) in 2011 for a five-year term. Schirmer stood down from both posts in 2022.

Tobias Wolff became &quot;Intendant&quot; of the company in 2022. Christoph Gedschold became music director of the company as of the 2022–2023 season. In May 2023, the company announced that Gedschold is to stand down as its music director as of the close of the 2023–2024 season.

<text>William Orville &quot;Lefty&quot; Frizzell (March 31, 1928 – July 19, 1975) was an American country and honky-tonk singer-songwriter.

Frizell is known as one of the most influential country music vocal stylists of all time. He has been cited as influencing prominent country singers like George Jones, Merle Haggard, Roy Orbison, and Willie Nelson. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1982 as well as the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In his prime, Frizzell was the first artist to achieve four songs in the top ten on the Country Music Billboard charts at one time. Frizzell went on to have more success, releasing many songs that charted in the Top 10 of the Hot Country Songs charts as an artist and songwriter. After dealing with alcoholism, he died of a stroke at age 47.

==Early life==
William Orville Frizzell was born the son of an oilman, the first of eight children, in Corsicana in Navarro County in North Texas, United States. During his childhood, his family moved to El Dorado in Union County in south Arkansas.

As a child he was called &quot;Sonny,&quot; but he later took the name &quot;Lefty.&quot; It was believed that he got the name &quot;Lefty&quot; because he had won a neighborhood fight; however, this tale was probably fabricated as part of a publicity stunt set up by his record label.

Frizzell&#x27;s largest influences included &quot;The Blue Yodeler&quot; Jimmie Rodgers. He began listening to Rodgers&#x27; records as a boy. He began singing professionally before his teens, even earning a spot on the local radio-station KELD in El Dorado, Arkansas. Frizzell&#x27;s teens were spent singing in nightclubs and radio and talent shows throughout the south. During his tour of Arkansas, Texas, New Mexico, and Las Vegas, he began to develop a style of his own, shaped by artists like Rodgers, Ernest Tubb, and Ted Daffan.

== Musical beginnings and jail ==

While living in Greenville, Texas, during World War II, Frizzell performed on radio station KPLT in nearby Paris, Texas. There he met Alice Harper; they married in March 1945. In 1946, they moved to Roswell, New Mexico, and Frizzell performed on radio station KGFL and with the house band at the Cactus Gardens dance hall.

In July 1947, the 19-year-old Frizzell was arrested and jailed for having sex with an underage fan. He was charged with statutory rape, convicted the following month, and served six months in the county jail. Filled with guilt, he wrote poems to his wife from his cell; one of them would become his first big record.

After his release in late 1949, he was led away from music, and back to the oil fields to work with his father. However, soon he was performing in nightclubs again. By 1950, he had landed a regular job at the Big Spring, Texas, nightclub &quot;Ace of Clubs&quot; where he developed a dedicated fan following.

==Recording career ==

During a show at the &quot;Ace of Clubs&quot;, Jim Beck, the owner of a Dallas recording studio, took notice of Frizzell. Beck had deals with several major record producing labels and maintained connections with many publishers. Impressed with Frizzell&#x27;s performance, he invited him to make a free demo at the studio. In April 1950, he cut several demos of Frizzell singing his own songs, including &quot;If You&#x27;ve Got the Money (I&#x27;ve Got the Time),&quot; which Beck took to Nashville where he pitched it to Little Jimmy Dickens, who disliked the song. However, Columbia Records producer Don Law heard the cut and liked it. After hearing Lefty in concert, he signed the singer and recorded him for the first time.

&quot;If You&#x27;ve Got the Money (I&#x27;ve Got the Time)&quot; became a two-sided smash hit in 1950 upon its release; the b-side was the song Frizzell wrote to his grief-stricken wife Alice from jail, &quot;I Love You A Thousand Ways.&quot; These songs launched him into stardom and within two years, he had gone to register 13 Top 10 Country hits.

By 1951, he had perfected his vocal style and refined his guitar skills. He began working with a core group of Dallas-based studio musicians, including pianist Madge Suttee. In January 1951 he signed a contract that designated Jack Starnes Jr. as his manager. That contract conflicted with another contract Frizzell had signed, leading Starnes to file a major lawsuit against Frizzell, which was settled out of court a year later. Also in early 1951, Frizzell formed the Western Cherokees, led by Blackie Crawford, and soon they became his primary band for both live and recording sessions. During this stage of his career, he was in the studio extensively, recording singles. His third single, &quot;I Want to Be With You Always&quot;, was No. 1 for 11 weeks in 1951.

By mid-1951, Frizzell had become one of the only country singers who could be considered to match the popularity of Hank Williams, and he even toured with Williams. &quot;There is enough stories in that tour to fill a book...&quot; Frizzell once said, although he never told those stories. He had three more Top 10 hits in 1951; &quot;Mom and Dad&#x27;s Waltz,&quot; &quot;Travelin&#x27; Blues,&quot; and the #1 hit &quot;Give Me More, More, More (Of Your Kisses).&quot; In August 1951, he was arrested backstage at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee and charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor; the charge stemmed from a liaison in Arkansas during his tour with Williams. The charges were dropped and Frizzell was never prosecuted.

By 1952, he was a popular stage performer and in heavy demand, being included on The Grand Ole Opry and The Louisiana Hayride multiple times throughout the 1950s. The hits continued throughout 1952, with &quot;How Long Will It Take (To Stop Loving You),&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t Stay Away (&#x27;Till Love Grows Cold)&quot;, &quot;Forever (And Always)&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m An Old, Old Man (Try&#x27;n&#x27;a Live While I Can)&quot;.

Despite his massive success, things began to go downhill for Frizzell. He fired his manager and band, and joined the Grand Ole Opry; however, he quit very soon thereafter. Even though he was earning a lot of money, he was spending almost all of it. He began to work with the Arkansas-born singer-songwriter Wayne Raney, but the sessions were considered a failure.

Frizell had an automobile accident in 1952, moved to Los Angeles in early 1953, and earned a spot as a regular cast member on the Town Hall Party television show on KTTV. His songs still charted, but only one entered the Top 10 that year.

In January 1954, Frizzell had another automobile accident, near E.S. Richardson Elementary School in Minden in Webster Parish, Louisiana, through which he passed after leaving the Louisiana Hayride in Shreveport en route to a concert in Mississippi. His Cadillac struck the Nash station wagon parked at the home of its owner, R. Harmon Drew, Sr., the former city judge and later a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives. Frizzell apologized, said that he hoped to visit Minden again under more favorable circumstances, posted bond, and took a taxicab back to Shreveport, from which he flew to his destination. In early 1954, he reached the Top 10 for the last time for five years.

Having had few hits in the middle-late 1950s, he felt burnt out and had little energy for his career. He became frustrated that Columbia Records did not release what he thought to be his best material, so he stopped writing and recording songs. He toured extensively, however. 

In 1959, deciding on change, Frizell began to work at Nashville&#x27;s Cedarwood Publishing Company with Jim Denny. His first Top 10 hit in five years came with &quot;Long Black Veil&quot; that year. He moved to Nashville in 1960 after the Town Hall Party closed, and began touring and recording more and more, scoring some minor hits.

Lefty&#x27;s last big hit came in 1964 with the No. 1 song &quot;Saginaw, Michigan&quot;, which earned him a Grammy nomination. The next year, &quot;She&#x27;s Gone, Gone, Gone&quot; was his last Top 20 hit. However, &quot;I Never Go Around Mirrors&quot; from his last studio album &quot;The Legendary&quot; is considered one of the greatest country songs of all time. It has been recorded over 22 times since with Keith Whitley&#x27;s version standing out as one of the best versions.

== Personal troubles, later years, and death ==

Frizzell began a downward spiral after developing a debilitating alcohol problem. Despite his history of infidelity, arrests for sex with underage fans, contractual legal troubles, and automobile accidents, Alice Harper remained his wife, and their marriage produced three children.

During the late 1960s, he recorded many songs, but Columbia released very few. Because of his declining record sales, he began to perform less. In 1968, he recorded with June Stearns as Agnes and Orville.

In early 1972, Frizzell left Columbia Records and signed with ABC Records. That same year, he was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and his song &quot;If You&#x27;ve Got the Money (I&#x27;ve Got the Time)&quot; earned him the Grammy Hall of Fame Award.

By this time, drinking was taking a toll on him. He had developed chronic hypertension, his appearance had changed drastically, and his voice had deteriorated. On July 19, 1975, at age 47, Frizzell died of a massive stroke, and was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Gardens in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. Frizzell was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in October 1982.

== Guitar ==

Frizzell&#x27;s signature guitar was a 1949 Gibson J-200 (Model SJ-200). Originally built by the Gibson Guitar Corporation, it was retrofitted in early 1951 with a custom neck and pickguard by guitar maker and innovator Paul Bigsby. In a 2003 interview Merle Haggard recalled, &quot;When I was a teenager, Lefty got me onstage [at the Rainbow Garden in Bakersfield, California] and handed me that guitar. That is the first guitar I played on a professional stage.&quot; For many years, the guitar had been on loan to and displayed at the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville, Tennessee. In January 2005, it was returned to the Frizzell family and was later sold via auction by Retrofret, with an asking price of $350,000; Haggard purchased the guitar and it remains a part of his estate.

==Legacy and influence==

Frizzell&#x27;s style of singing influenced a great many singers, particularly Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson, George Jones, Keith Whitley, and Roy Orbison. In addition, he was widely recognized for his songwriting talents. In the foreword to a biography of Frizzell by his younger brother David Frizzell, Merle Haggard said, &quot;The impact Lefty had on country music is not even measurable. ... No one could handle a song like Lefty. He would hold on to each word until he finally decided to drop it and pick up the next one. Most of us learned to sing listening to him.&quot;

Stoney Edwards recorded &quot;Hank and Lefty Raised My Country Soul,&quot; a tribute to Hank Williams and Frizzell, written by Dallas Frazier. It hit the Top 40 in 1973.

George Strait recorded a Sanger D. Shafer song called &quot;Lefty&#x27;s Gone&quot; on the album &quot;Something Special&quot;. In addition, Willie Nelson&#x27;s 1977 album, &quot;To Lefty From Willie&quot; was a tribute to Frizzell and consisted entirely of cover versions of Frizzell songs. Frizzell was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1982 and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He is also in the Rockabilly Hall of Fame along with his son Crockett Frizzell. Frizzell ranked number 31 on CMT&#x27;s 2003 &quot;40 Greatest Men of Country Music&quot;.

Fellow Texan Roy Orbison was a devout fan of Frizzell&#x27;s sound, and in 1988, as a part of the Traveling Wilburys, he chose the name &quot;Lefty Wilbury&quot; to honor his musical hero.

Maine singer-songwriter David Mallett included Frizzell&#x27;s &quot;Saginaw, Michigan&quot; on his 2014 album &quot;The Horse I Rode in On&quot;.

His younger brother, David Frizzell, is also a country singer. His biggest hits were 1982&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Hire a Wino (To Decorate Our Home)&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re the Reason God Made Oklahoma&quot;, a 1981 duet with Shelly West. The youngest brother, Allen Frizzell followed in his older brothers&#x27; footsteps in the country field. He was an opening performer for Dottie West. He was also married to Shelly West, daughter of Dottie West. Allen also played with Keith Whitley. He now plays country gospel music.

In 2006, J.D. Crowe and The New South released the album &quot;Lefty&#x27;s Old Guitar&quot;. The song &quot;Lefty&#x27;s Old Guitar&quot; was written about his custom Gibson J-200.

Daryle Singletary referenced Frizzell in his song &quot;Ain&#x27;t It The Truth&quot; on an album by the same name, released by Giant Records in 1998.

In 2019, Frizzell&#x27;s single &quot;Long Black Veil&quot; was selected by the U.S. Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

In 2024, Cody Jinks released the album &quot;Cody Jinks Sings Lefty Frizzell&quot;, featuring nine songs by Frizzell.

<text>Toranosuke &quot;Tora&quot; Takagi (高木 虎之介; born 12 February 1974) is a Japanese former racing driver.

== Early career ==
Takagi was heavily influenced by his father, a touring car driver. In the early 1980s he began racing karts, competing in his first championship kart race in 1987. After winning several All Japan National Kart A2 series races, Takagi ended his kart racing career in 1991 and began racing Formula Toyota in 1992. In 1993, he began competing in All Japan Formula Three, finishing 10th in his rookie season.

==Formula One==

During his performance in a 1994 race he drew the attention of Japanese Formula One driver Satoru Nakajima, joining the Nakajima Racing team and competing in Formula 3000. He was heavily involved in the team from 1995 until he was chosen as Tyrrell&#x27;s Formula One test driver in 1997. He graduated to a race seat for . Takagi later competed with the Arrows Formula One team, and his European popularity was on the rise. However, there were organizational and communication problems between Takagi and both teams, and he left Formula One at the end of the season.

==Post–Formula One career==

In 2000, Takagi joined Nakajima Racing&#x27;s Formula Nippon team, earning eight victories in ten races, the most dominant performance ever by a driver in the series. He later competed in CART for the Walker Racing team in 2001 and 2002 finishing in a career-best 4th place in Houston, Texas. He transferred to Indy Racing League and joined Mo Nunn Racing, finishing 10th in 2003. In the same year, he competed in the Indianapolis 500, starting in 7th place and finishing in 5th, earning him the Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year award.

After another, largely disappointing season in the IndyCar Series, Takagi returned to Japan in 2005 to compete in Formula Nippon once again, taking part ownership of the Cerumo team and running one of their cars in his own name (Takagi Planning with CERUMO). Takagi also was one of the co-drivers of the #38 Toyota Supra Super GT car, claiming the series title along with Yuji Tachikawa. Takagi&#x27;s title made him the first Super GT rookie to become champion in the GT500 class since John Nielsen and David Brabham in 1996, as well as the last until Jenson Button in 2018.

<doc id="693977" wikidata="Q2625789" url="?curid=693977" title="Igor Talkov">
<text>Igor Vladimirovich Talkov (; 4 November 1956 – 6 October 1991), was a Russian rock singer-songwriter and film actor. His breakthrough came in 1987 with the David Tukhmanov-composed song &quot;Clean Ponds&quot; which was an instant hit. Talkov&#x27;s lyrics are mostly about love, but also contain social critique of the Soviet regime. He was shot dead in 1991.

==Early life and career==
Igor Talkov was born in Gretsovka, Tula Oblast, Soviet Union on 4 November 1956. He grew up in Shchyokino. After leaving the army, Talkov started singing in the restaurants of Moscow and Sochi.

Igor Talkov joined Electroclub band in 1986. Talkov&#x27;s breakthrough came in 1987 with the David Tukhmanov-composed song &quot;Clean Ponds&quot; which was an instant hit. While he is mostly remembered for songs about love and fate, most of his work held a clearly political message against the Soviet regime, calling for change. This is one of the reasons why Talkov was never popular with the Soviet government; even as a performer renowned and loved throughout the whole Soviet Union, he lived in a small two-room apartment with his wife and son, composing his lyrics and music &quot;on top of the washing machine in the bathroom&quot;, according to the rumours. He was not satisfied with Perestroika, claiming it to be nothing but the same regime under a different guise. In his post-Perestroika songs, he openly mocked the changes, calling them a ruse. Talkov was an avid reader of pre-revolutionary Russian history, which served as the inspiration for many of his songs. He even guaranteed at his last concert that he was willing to &quot;back up&quot; his lyrics with historical facts.

Talkov also made a brief presence in the cinema, acting in the films &quot;Behind the Last Line&quot; and &quot;Tsar Ivan the Terrible&quot; . The latter film he disliked, apologizing to a preview audience for participating in the film. Since Talkov refused to complete post-production sound on the film, his character was voiced by another actor.

Talkov&#x27;s songs also have much in common – particularly from a lyrical perspective – with Russian bard music.

==Death==
According to Talkov&#x27;s wife Tatyana and son Igor Jr., the last months of the singer&#x27;s life he received threats.

Many performers performed at the concert, which took place on 6 October 1991 in St. Petersburg at the Yubileiny Sports Palace. A friend of the singer 
Aziza, at her request, asked Igor Talkov to perform first, since Aziza did not have time to prepare for the exit. Talkov called the singer&#x27;s guard Igor Malakhov to his dressing room, and a verbal conflict occurred between them. After that, two guards and Igor Talkov took Igor Malakhov out of the dressing room. Talkov began to prepare for his performance, but a few minutes later the administrator of his Lifebuoy group, Valery Shlyafman, ran up to him, shouting that Malakhov had taken out a revolver. Talkov pulled out a gas pistol from his bag, which he had acquired for self-defense, ran into the corridor and, seeing that his guards were at gunpoint of Igor Malakhov, fired three shots at him. Malakhov bent down, and the guards, taking advantage of this delay, began to neutralize him. Then he fired two shots, but one bullet hit the floor, and the second – into the box with the equipment. The guards began to beat the shooter, and, covering his head, he dropped his revolver. A few moments later, another shot rang out, which hit Igor Talkov in the chest. An hour later, when the ambulance team arrived, the doctors immediately stated biological death.

The prosecutor&#x27;s office opened a criminal case. Igor Malakhov, who was put on the all-Union wanted list, voluntarily came to confess 10 days later. In December 1991, the charge of premeditated murder was dropped. After conducting examinations in April 1992, the investigation established that the last shot was made by Valery Schlyafman, Talkov&#x27;s one time manager. However, in February 1992, the defendant left for Israel, with which Russia did not have an extradition agreement at the time, and the murder case was suspended. In November 2018, the Investigative Committee resumed its investigation into the singer&#x27;s murder.

==Aftermath==
While Valery Schlyafman was suspected of the murder by a Russian court in 1992, he fled through Ukraine to Israel before he could be arrested. He remains in Israel to this day, insisting he is not guilty of the crime while Israel refuses to extradite him. Schlyafman and his supporters have claimed that the KGB orchestrated the murder.

In 1999, Talkov was honoured with his image portrayed on a Russian postage stamp. There is an Igor Talkov Museum in Moscow.

<doc id="693981" wikidata="Q1602650" url="?curid=693981" title="Hella, Iceland">
<text>Hella () is a small town in southern Iceland on the shores of the river Ytri-Rangá and has, as of 2021, 942 inhabitants.

Hella is situated to the east of Reykjavík on the Hringvegur (Route 1) between Selfoss and Hvolsvöllur.

==Overview==
The name of the town comes from caves near the river. It is said that Irish monks lived there in the times of first settlement. There are small industries as well as shops. As in other regions of the country, tourism is a growing sector. The volcano Hekla is nearby so it is possible to go hiking there as well as to make excursions to other locations popular with tourists such as Landmannalaugar or Þórsmörk. The founding of Hella started in 1927 when Þorsteinn Björnsson built a store over by the bridge Ytri-Rangá in the land of Gaddstaðaflatir. That founder of Hella was built a memorial at the celebration of Hella&#x27;s 50 years since the founding of it at 1977.

==Climate==
Hella has a subarctic climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfc&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Eolo&quot;), with temperatures rising above only in July and August.

<text>Solwezi is a town in Zambia. It is the provincial capital of the mineral-rich North-Western Province. Solwezi is also the administrative capital of Solwezi District, one of the eleven districts in the North-Western Province.

==Geography==
===Location===
Solwezi is located on the Chingola–Solwezi–Mwinilunga Road (T5 Road of Zambia), approximately north-west of Chingola and approximately south-east of Mwinilunga, in the extreme northwest of the country. The geographical coordinates of the city are:12°08&#x27;36.0&quot;S, 26°23&#x27;09.0&quot;E (Latitude:-12.143333; Longitude:26.385833). Solwezi sits at an average elevation of above mean sea level.

Approximately south of the central business district, is the &quot;Kifubwa Rock Stream Shelter&quot;, also &quot;Kifubwa Rock National Monument&quot;. It is located next to the Kifubwa River, with inscriptions dating from the Paleolithic period, carbon dated to about 6300 BC. The conservation area measures approximately with the Kifubwa Stream Cave at its centre.

===Climate===
Solwezi features a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwa&quot;) with distinct wet and dry seasons. October and November are the hottest months. Winters are milder, with July being the coolest month. The wet season, from November to March, experiences abundant rainfall. The dry season, from May to September, is marked by minimal precipitation.

==Population==
In 1990, the population of Solwezi was 23,435 people. In 2000, there were 38,121 people. The 2010 population census and household survey enumerated the population of the town at 90,856 inhabitants.

==Economy==
Solwezi is a mining town. As of 2015, the town was still developing, with infrastructure development running behind the swelling population. At that time, only the main street, &quot;Independence Road&quot; was named. Many of the other streets were un-named and unpaved. Copper is the main mineral extracted although cobalt, gold and uranium is also mined in the area.

The adjacent Kalumbila District hosts Lumwana Mine, located about west of Solwezi; and Kalumbila Mine, located about west of Solwezi, and run by Barrick Gold. Kalumbila is operated by First Quantum Minerals. The deposits at Lumwana were discovered in 1961, but no serious work was carried out there until Equinox Minerals Limited became involved in 1999. Uranium is also mined in Kalumbila District at the Lumwana mine. The main industry of Solwezi District is copper mining at Kansanshi Mine (located about north) run by First Quantum Minerals. Kansanshi Mine exploits copper-gold ore. The mining site has intermittently been running since the early 20th century for copper and gold.

== Tribes ==
Kaonde is the largest tribe represented in Solwezi, in addition to large numbers of Lunda and Luvale speaking people. The Kaonde is a tribe that, like the Lunda people, are descendants of the Luba-Lunda Empire of Congo. They were among the first Zambians to do mining of copper in Zambia as suggested by archaeological evidence at the Kansanshi Mine in Solwezi that dates back to the Iron Age. The Kaonde tribe falls under one of the main tribes of Zambia, among the Lozi, the Bemba, the Ngoni, the Tonga and the Luvale. The Kaonde tribe has about 300,000 people in Zambia and about 30,000 people in Southern DRC.

== Transportation ==
Solwezi is situated on the T5 Motorway, which connects the Copperbelt Province with Angola. Most people walk or drive around the town to get to and from different places. The Solwezi Airport is an airport near the T5 motorway.

<text>Sea Dart, or GWS.30 was a Royal Navy surface-to-air missile system designed in the 1960s and entering service in 1973. It was fitted to the Type 42 destroyers (United Kingdom and Argentina), Type 82 destroyer and s of the Royal Navy. Originally developed by Hawker Siddeley, the missile was built by British Aerospace after 1977. It was withdrawn from service in 2012.

Britain&#x27;s first naval surface-to-air missile was GWS1 Seaslug, which entered service in 1963. This used beam riding guidance which offered limited accuracy and was useful only against slower targets. The need for a higher performance system was seen even as it entered service.

Bristol Aerospace, which had recently introduced the ramjet-powered Bloodhound missile for the RAF, won the ensuing competition with another ramjet design. Compared to Seaslug, Sea Dart was faster, had much greater range, and its semi-active radar homing guidance was much more accurate and allowed attacks against supersonic targets.

The system had nine confirmed successful engagements in combat, including six aircraft, a helicopter and two anti-ship missiles. An additional helicopter was shot down in a &#x27;friendly fire&#x27; incident during the Falklands War.

==History==
From the immediate post-WWII era, the Royal Navy had been looking for a general-purpose weapon to arm small ships. After the experience with German glide bombs during the war, the primary concern was the development of a medium-range surface-to-air missile able to shoot down the carrier bombers before they could approach the ships within the range of their glide bombs. As this weapon would take up room normally assigned to a dual-purpose gun, the weapon also needed a secondary anti-ship capability. The secondary anti-ship role was later reduced in importance.

Early experiments during the 1950s led to the development of the Seaslug system. Seaslug was useful against first-generation strike aircraft but had limited performance against faster aircraft or anti-ship missiles. Seaslug was also too large to be carried by a frigate-sized ship, leaving smaller ships with little air defence. Some consideration was given to a high-performance gun system for these ships, the DACR (direct-action, close-range), but calculations showed it would be useless against future anti-ship missiles that would manoeuvre on the approach.

In October 1960, the Navy launched the Small Ship Integrated Guided Weapon project to fill this need, SIGS for short. This called for a weapon small enough to be carried on a 3,000 ton frigate and able to attack bombers, anti-shipping missiles, and other ships up to frigate size. Seaslug had taken much longer to develop than expected and was a very costly, ongoing program. There was some concern that development of a new system should not commence before Seaslug was in service. A review by the Defence Research Policy Committee agreed with the Navy that the new design represented an entirely new class of weapon and that development should be undertaken immediately.

Two systems were considered for the role, Bristol&#x27;s CF.299 design using a ramjet with a small rocket booster launching it up to speed, and an adaptation of the Army&#x27;s Sightline project, which would later emerge as Rapier. CF.299 was ultimately chosen. A 1966 report estimated that CF.299 would have a two-shot kill probability (Pk) against an AS-2 Kipper missile of 0.8–0.9, whereas Seaslug II would manage only 0.35–0.55. Against a supersonic &quot;Blinder&quot; bomber, Pk was 0.5–0.8, compared to 0.3–0.5 for Seaslug. Additionally, because it flew faster than Seaslug, the total engagement time was shorter, and this meant the battery could salvo more rapidly. Finally, its ability to lead the target, compared to Seaslug&#x27;s beam riding pursuit course, allowed it to attack targets with much higher crossing speeds. A 1968 study suggested Sea Dart would have the same capability as eight F-4 Phantoms on patrol.

By this time, many European navies had chosen the US RIM-24 Tartar surface-to-air missiles, but the Dutch Navy remained interested in the British design. They envisioned it being used with a new dedicated air-defence ship, controlled by a significantly more powerful radar which the British referred to as the Type 988 &quot;Broomstick&quot;. This was a 3D radar with multiple antennas that provided both fast continual scanning as well as multiple independent targeting radars. Both the radar and missiles would be controlled by a new combat direction system being developed by both navies.

Ultimately, the Dutch also chose Tartar for their missile component, leaving the Royal Navy as the Sea Dart&#x27;s only initial user. The Navy dropped their interest in Broomstick and continued development using simpler radars like the Type 965 radar that was already in service. This had the significant disadvantage of not being able to pick out targets against a background landform or high waves, significantly limiting its capabilities against low-flying strike aircraft.

Sea Dart entered service in 1973 on the sole Type 82 destroyer before widespread deployment on the Type 42 destroyer commencing with in 1976. The missile system was also fitted to &quot;Invincible&quot;-class aircraft carriers but was removed during refits between 1998 and 2000 to increase the area of the flight deck and below-decks stowage associated with the operation of Royal Air Force Harrier GR9 aircraft.

In 1982, British Aerospace won a £100m contract to sell the Sea Dart system to China, but this fell through in 1983, with Chinese minister Chen Muhua explaining that China was &quot;not satisfied with the price, technology or production&quot;.

==Design==

Sea Dart is a two-stage, long missile weighing . It is launched using a drop-off &quot;Chow&quot; solid-fuel booster that accelerates it to the supersonic speed necessary for the operation of the cruise motor, a Rolls-Royce /Bristol Siddeley kerosene-fuelled &quot;Odin&quot; ramjet. This gives a cruise speed of over Mach 2.5, and unlike many rocket-powered designs, the cruise engine burns for the entire flight, giving excellent terminal manoeuvrability at extreme range.

It is capable of engaging targets out to at least over a wide range of altitudes. It has a secondary capability against small surface vessels, tested against a , although in surface mode the warhead safety arming unit does not arm, and thus damage inflicted is restricted to the physical impact of the half-ton missile body and the unspent proportion of the of kerosene fuel.

Guidance is by proportional navigation and a semi-active radar homing system using the nose intake cone and four aerials around the intake as an interferometer aerial, with targets being identified by a Type 1022 surveillance radar (originally radar Type 965) and illuminated by one of a pair of radar Type 909. This allows two targets to be engaged simultaneously in initial versions, with later variants able to engage more. Firing is from a twin-arm trainable launcher that is loaded automatically from below decks. The original launcher seen on HMS &quot;Bristol&quot; was significantly larger than that which appeared on Type 42 and &quot;Invincible&quot; classes. Initial difficulties with launcher reliability were resolved.

==Combat service==
===Falklands War===

Sea Dart was used during the Falklands War (1982) and is credited with seven confirmed kills (plus one British Westland Gazelle helicopter downed by friendly fire). Kills were made against a high-flying aircraft beyond the missile&#x27;s stated technical envelope and low-flying attack aircraft.

The net effect of Sea Dart was to deny the higher altitudes to enemy aircraft. This was important because Argentine aircraft such as the Dassault Mirage III had better straight line performance than the British Aerospace Sea Harriers, which were unlikely to successfully intercept them.

The first Sea Dart engagement was against an Aérospatiale Puma, on 9 May 1982 near Stanley by , with the loss of the three men aboard.

On 25 May 1982 an Douglas A-4C Skyhawk of Grupo 5 was shot down north of Pebble Island, again by &quot;Coventry&quot;. The pilot, Capitán Hugo Angel del Valle Palaver, was killed. Later, &quot;Coventry&quot; shot down another Skyhawk of Grupo 4 while it was returning from a mission to San Carlos Water. Capitán Jorge Osvaldo García successfully ejected but was not recovered. The next Argentine action that day sank &quot;Coventry&quot;. An unguided Sea Dart was launched in an effort to disrupt the attack but missed, and the destroyer was struck by two iron bombs and sank.

The same day a Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard strike fighter sought to attack the British carrier group with Exocet missiles, but instead struck the cargo ship . fired six Sea Darts in less than two minutes, but all missed.

On 30 May 1982, during the last Exocet air attacks against the British fleet, shot down two Skyhawks (out of four), despite their flying only above the sea (theoretically below Sea Dart&#x27;s minimum engagement altitude of ). On 6 June &quot;Exeter&quot; shot down a Learjet 35A being used for reconnaissance at .

On 6 June 1982, &quot;Cardiff&quot; fired a Sea Dart missile at an aircraft believed to be an Argentine C-130 Hercules. The missile destroyed the aircraft, which was in fact a British Army helicopter. All four occupants were killed in this &quot;friendly-fire&quot; incident.

Finally, on 13 June 1982, an English Electric Canberra flying at en route to bomb British troops near Port Harriet House was destroyed by a Sea Dart fired from &quot;Cardiff&quot;.

In total at least eighteen missiles were launched by Type 42 destroyers, six by &quot;Invincible,&quot; and two by &quot;Bristol&quot;. Out of five missiles fired against helicopters or high flying aircraft, four were successful, but only two of nineteen fired at low level aircraft hit: just eleven per cent; however a number of missiles were fired without guidance to deter low level attacks. &quot;Exeter&quot;″s success can be partially attributed to being equipped with the Type 1022 radar, which was designed for the system and provided greater capability than the old Type 965 fitted to the earlier Type 42s. The Type 965 was unable to cope with low level targets as it suffered multiple path crossings and targets became lost in radar clutter from the surface of the South Atlantic. This resulted in Sea Dart being unable to lock onto targets at distance obscured by land, or fast-moving low-level targets obscured in ground clutter or sea-returns.

The Argentine Navy was well aware of the Sea Dart&#x27;s capabilities and limitations, having two Type 42s of its own. Consequently, Argentine planes, opting to fly below the Type 965 radar (&quot;sea skimming&quot;), frequently dropped bombs which failed to explode. The arming vane on the bomb had insufficient time to complete the number of revolutions required to arm the fuze.

===Persian Gulf War (1991)===
In February 1991 during the Persian Gulf War the battleship was operating in the Persian Gulf. Her battlegroup included a number of escorts, including the Type 42 destroyer . On 24 February, &quot;Missouri&quot; was fired on by a pair of Silkworm anti-ship missiles. Although one missed completely, the other was engaged and destroyed by a Sea Dart fired by HMS Gloucester after it had flown over the target, while another of the battleship&#x27;s escorts, the frigate , attempted to engage with its Phalanx CIWS, but succeeded only in firing at the chaff launched by &quot;Missouri&quot;.

==Variants==
The Sea Dart was upgraded over the years - notably its electronics - as technology advanced. The following modification standards have been fielded:
; Mod 0: Basic 1960s version, used in the Falklands. valve technology. Range circa .
; Mod 1: Improved Sea Dart. Upgraded version 1983–1986. Updated guidance systems possibly allowing some capability against sea-skimming targets and much greater reliability.
; Mod 2: 1989–1991. Upgrade included ADIMP (Air Defence IMProvement) which saw the replacement of six old circuit cards in the guidance system with one, allowing the spare volume to be used for an autopilot. Used alongside a command datalink (sited on the Type 909 pedestal) it allows several missiles to be &#x27;in the air&#x27; at once, re-targeted during flight etc. and allows an initial ballistic trajectory, doubling range to with the upgraded 909(I) radar for terminal illumination only.
; Mod 3: Latest version with new infrared fuze. Delayed eight years from 1994 to 2002.

The Sea Dart Mark 2, GWS 31, (also known as Sea Dart II - not to be confused with Mod 2, above) development was cancelled in 1981. This was intended to allow &#x27;off the rail&#x27; manoeuvres with additional controls added to the booster. The Mark 2 was reduced to Advanced Sea Dart, then Enhanced Sea Dart and finally Improved Sea Dart.

Lightweight Sea Dart was a version with minimal changes to the missile itself, but based in a new sealed box-launcher. A four-box trainable launcher was developed that allowed it to be mounted to ships as small as 300 tons displacement. The same box and launcher could also support the Sea Eagle SL, the proposed ship-launched version of Sea Eagle. Guardian was a proposed land-based system of radars, control stations and the Lightweight Sea Dart proposed in the 1980s for use as a land-based air defence system for the Falkland Islands. Neither system was put into production.

==Withdrawal==
The Sea Dart-equipped Type 42s were replaced by the larger Type 45 which are armed with the Sea Viper missile system which is much more capable in the anti-air role. The first-of-class, &quot;Daring,&quot; entered service in 2009.

On 13 April 2012 fired the last operational Sea Dart missiles. The last two remaining Type 42s, and &quot;Edinburgh&quot; completed their careers without the system being operational.

A launcher with drill missiles has been preserved and is on display at Explosion! Museum of Naval Firepower, Gosport, Hampshire.

<text>Booker Tyrone Edgerson (born July 5, 1939) is an American former professional football player who was a cornerback in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Western Illinois Leathernecks. He became a cornerstone of the AFL&#x27;s Buffalo Bills&#x27; defense in the mid-1960s, at left cornerback.

A four-year letterman (football, baseball, wrestling, track and field); in 1959 and 1960, he led the Western Illinois University (WIU) football team to the only consecutive undefeated seasons in school history, and is in the WIU Hall of Fame.

Booker was born in Baxter County, Arkansas. He signed as a free agent with the Bills in 1962 and stepped into a starting role at left cornerback. He made a career-high six interceptions (including two in his first game, against Hall of Famer George Blanda), and was named to the AFL All-Rookie team.

Edgerson&#x27;s college background as a sprinter and long jumper served him well in the demanding role of man-to-man pass coverage. The AFL featured many dangerous receivers at that time including San Diego&#x27;s Lance Alworth. But Edgerson became one of the key components of the league&#x27;s best defense, and he was the only man ever to catch Alworth from behind in a game.

Edgerson appeared in playoffs four consecutive years, and in three straight AFL Championship games. The Bills beat the San Diego Chargers in 1964 and again in 1965, when Edgerson was selected as an American Football League All-Star.

Edgerson had 23 interceptions in his eight-year career in Buffalo, and scored on two, including one against Joe Namath. He also forced and returned a fumble for the deciding score in a 1969 game against the Cincinnati Bengals, played in blizzard conditions.

Edgerson retired to Buffalo, where he has been involved in numerous charitable endeavors through the Bills Alumni, and was the 1993 recipient of the Ralph C. Wilson Award. He is a member of the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame.

Edgerson was selected to be the 2010 Buffalo Bills Wall of Fame inductee where his name was revealed during a halftime ceremony on October 3 during the Bills game against AFC rival New York Jets.

Edgerson wrote the foreword to &quot;The Cookie That Did Not Crumble&quot;, the autobiography of his former teammate, Cookie Gilchrist.

<doc id="694020" wikidata="Q932652" url="?curid=694020" title="The Agency (2001 TV series)">
<text>The Agency is an American action-spy television series that followed the inner-workings of the CIA. The series was aired on CBS from September 27, 2001 until May 17, 2003, lasting two seasons.

The series, which premiered soon after the 9/11 attacks, was created by Michael Frost Beckner and was executive produced by Beckner, Shaun Cassidy Productions, and Radiant Productions in association with Universal Network Television and CBS Productions. The program was allowed unprecedented access to the actual CIA headquarters, thanks to a partnership that began in 1996 when the CIA hired one of its veteran clandestine officers, Chase Brandon, to work directly with Hollywood studios and production companies influence its public image.

==Premise==
The series was controversial in its exploration of contemporary international affairs and its treatment of the ethical conflicts inherent in intelligence work. Beckner&#x27;s pilot script, written in March 2001, posited a re-invented CIA tasked with a &quot;War on Terror&quot; after Osama bin Laden&#x27;s Al Qaeda terrorist organization plots a lethal attack on the West. The pilot was to premiere at CIA headquarters on September 18, 2001, and set to air on CBS September 21, 2001. The actual 9/11 attacks convinced the network to hold the pilot and instead air a later episode. That first episode was broadcast later as the fifth episode of the first season.

In advance of the September 11 attacks, executive producer Wolfgang Peterson said that after World War II, the ideas of good and evil were no longer as clear: &quot;Everywhere in the world, the C.I.A. is still involved in missions. It is sometimes difficult to tell who is on the right side and who is on the wrong side.&quot;

It was one of three new series, including &quot;Alias&quot;, and &quot;24&quot;, to highlight the CIA. All three premiered following the September 11 attacks. &quot;Alias&quot; and &quot;24&quot; were considered hits, but CBS cancelled &quot;The Agency&quot; after two seasons.

In its review of the series, &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; noted: &quot;It’s hard to remember a time in U.S. history when public attention was more sharply focused on issues of domestic security, civil liberties and the role of U.S. intelligence agencies. A prime-time dramatic series on the CIA could contribute mightily to public understanding--if rigorously independent and unencumbered. Unfortunately, that’s not the approach CBS is taking with &quot;The Agency...&quot;&quot;

<doc id="694021" wikidata="Q1617610" url="?curid=694021" title="Norton, Doncaster">
<text>Norton is a village and civil parish in the City of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England, on the borders with North and West Yorkshire.

The civil parish also includes the villages of Campsall and Sutton, and has a population of 4,381, increasing to 4,625 at the 2011 Census. The northern boundary of the parish is marked by the River Went, while the Great North Road forms the western boundary.

== History ==
Little is known about Norton until it was recorded in the Domesday Survey of 1086 when it probably had a population of 100 who were solely concerned with agriculture. During the medieval period that followed, Robin Hood was associated with Barnsdale Forest to the west whilst the nearby village of Campsall grew in importance, gaining a chartered market and Norman church. However, Norton gets few mentions in any surviving records from this time.

At a later date, Norton Priory was developed on the banks of the River Went but this never grew to be particularly significant and was subsequently demolished following the dissolution of the monasteries in 1588. In 1745, Mary Ramsden of Norton died and left 50 shillings to the poor of Norton and ‘several estates’ to the master and fellows of Catherine Hall, Cambridge. Thus a Cambridge College became the Lord of the Manor of Norton and a handsome manor house was built in the village. In the 1800s the Forrester&#x27;s Arms and the School Boy Inn were both established to serve the local population which would still be devoted to agriculture.
Following the Industrial Revolution and the expansion of the railways, a station was opened in Norton in 1855 on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway’s Knottingley Branch. At the start of the 20th century there were rumours of the development of collieries at nearby Kirk Smeaton and Askern. As Norton was located between the two, a number of rows of red brick terraces were erected speculatively to house the anticipated influx of miners. Subsequently, Askern Colliery was opened in 1910 and a new red brick pub, the Royal Hotel, was built in Norton to serve the colliers of the village.

Throughout the 20th century small areas of housing have been built throughout the village and many of the original stone cottages with their long gardens have been demolished, and infilled with housing. The Manor House was pulled down in the 1970s and other older buildings have suffered the same fate since then, e.g. Hope Farm was demolished in 2002 to be replaced a small development of private housing.

== Village today ==
In the 21st century Norton serves as a commuter village for people working in the nearby towns such as Doncaster and Pontefract. It retains two pubs, a Working Mens Club and one village shop, but the only structure left of historic importance is the Grade II listed village water pump.

<doc id="694022" wikidata="Q19654771" url="?curid=694022" title="Campsall">
<text>Campsall is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Norton, in the Doncaster district, in the county of South Yorkshire, England. It lies to the north-west of Doncaster, at an elevation of around 50 feet above sea level. The village contains Campsall Country Park. The village falls within the Norton &amp; Askern ward of Doncaster Council and the House of Commons constituency of Doncaster North. The Parish is situated on the “Magnesian Limestone Belt”, a landscape feature formed by a narrow north–south trending escarpment. The Magnesian Limestone Belt is typified by well drained and fertile soils, which were ideal for agriculture and the establishment of settlements like Campsall. Before the Industrial Revolution, the area to the east was occupied by the inaccessible and waterlogged marshes of the Humberhead Levels, whilst to the west was the Barnsdale Forest, an area associated with the legend of Robin Hood and various outlaws and bandits who preyed upon travellers on the Great North Road. In 1931 the parish had a population of 260.

== History ==
Following the departure of the Romans, who had a small fort two miles to the west which guarded the crossing of the River Skell by the Great North Road, an early wooden Saxon church was established at Campsall, although nothing of this remains today. Following the Conquest a large Norman church was built out of local stone to serve the local population who were engaged with agricultural and rural employment during the mediaeval period. During this time Campsall was rapidly growing in importance and was granted a Royal Charter in 1294 entitling it to a weekly Thursday market and an annual four-day fair. These had ceased by 1627. A public house, the Ring of Bells (now called the Old Bells) was opened near the church and this pub is believed to be one of the oldest in Yorkshire.

During the 18th century, the village was dominated by the landed gentry. At opposite ends of the village, the Bacon-Franks constructed Campsall Hall and the Cooke-Yarboroughs built Campsmount. The villagers were still mostly employed with farming and working on the two estates, and even the establishment of nearby Askern Colliery in 1910 had little impact on the work force of Campsall.

Campsall was historically a large parish in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The ancient parish included the townships of Norton, Sutton, Askern, Fenwick, and Moss, all of which became separate civil parishes in 1866. The civil parish of Campsall was abolished on 1 April 1938, and merged into the parish of Norton.

It was not until the 1950s, that major changes began to affect the village. During this time, the Bacon-Franks abandoned Campsall Hall; it was rumoured that Mrs Bacon-Frank was growing tired of the view of Askern Colliery from the Hall. From 1956 the local authority and the National Coal Board developed a large area of housing in Campsall Park and Campsall Hall was converted into flats until 1986 when it was demolished. The Cooke-Yarboroughs had left Campsmount in the late 1930s, and the building was used as a military hospital until demolition in the 1950s. A private housing estate was built during the 1970s in the grounds of Campsmount Park.

== The village today ==
Today, Campsall has become established as a village of two parts. There is the old village near the church which still retains some of its rural charm, its cottages occupied by commuters who work in Leeds, Sheffield, Pontefract and Doncaster. There is also the newer part of Campsall formed in the 1950s from the Council and NCB housing projects. Askern Colliery ceased production in 1993 and after several years of relatively high unemployment the local people are beginning to find new employment opportunities, although many of the social problems associated with former mining areas remain.

Campsall hosts the secondary school Campsmount Academy, which has undergone large scale change over the years. Whilst known as &#x27;Campmount Technology College&#x27; there were financial advantages, leading to structural development including a new sports hall named the &#x27;David Ashton Sports Hall&#x27; after the legendary PE teacher who worked there for over 30 years. However, the school caught fire at around 1:30 a.m. on 13 December 2009, and suffered unrepairable damage, with only the &#x27;David Ashton Sports Hall&#x27; and The Expressive Arts block/ Library surviving the devastating blaze. The new school building was completed in April 2012 and the school converted to academy status shortly afterwards.

==The Church of St Mary Magdalene, Campsall and the Robin Hood legend==

The historian John Paul Davis wrote of the connection between Robin Hood and the Church of Saint Mary Magdalene at Campsall. The fifteenth century ballad entitled, &quot;A Gest of Robyn Hode&quot; states that Robin Hood built a chapel in Barnsdale that he dedicated to Mary Magdalene. 
‘I made a chapel in Bernysdale,&lt;br&gt;
That seemly is to se,&lt;br&gt;
It is of Mary Magdaleyne&lt;br&gt;
And thereto wolde I be’.

Davis indicates that there is only one church dedicated to Mary Magdalene within what one might reasonably consider to have been the mediaeval forest of Barnsdale, and that is the church at Campsall. The church was built in the late eleventh century by Robert de Lacy, 2nd Baron of Pontefract. Local legend suggests that Robin Hood and Maid Marion were married at the church of Saint Mary Magdalene, Campsall.

== The Society for the Acquisition of Knowledge ==
The Campsall Society for the Acquisition of Knowledge was founded in the late 1830s when the family of Mr. Charles Wood rented Campsall Hall and employed several promising young scholars – English and European – to tutor their sons Neville, Willoughby and Charles Junior. The father, Charles Thorold Wood, had been a captain in the Royal Horse Guards, and was an ornithologist. His wife, Jane, was an early adherent of homeopathy. Neville (1818–) at this time was editor of a journal called &quot;The Naturalist&quot;, a contributor to &quot;The Analyst&quot; and had, in 1836, published &quot;The Ornithologist&#x27;s Text-Book&quot; (John W. Parker, London). He later went to London and led the Homeopathic movement there. Their tutors included Giacomo (James) Chiosso, later professor of gymnastics at University College London and inventor of the Polymachinon (forerunner of the modern exercise machine), Edwin Lankester, Leonhard Schmitz and Ferdinand Moller. The Society had probably ceased to exist by the early 1840s, as the tutors had mostly moved on by this time.

<doc id="694023" wikidata="Q2852815" url="?curid=694023" title="Tony Booth (actor)">
<text>Anthony George Booth (9 October 1931 – 25 September 2017) was an English actor, best known for his role as Mike Rawlins in the BBC series &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;. He was the father-in-law of former prime minister Tony Blair and the widower of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; star Pat Phoenix, having married her a few days before her death in 1986.

==Early life==
Booth was born into a working-class family in Jubilee Road, Liverpool, in 1931 and raised Catholic. His mother was a Roman Catholic of Irish descent; his father, who worked as a merchant seaman during the Second World War, was a Catholic convert. Tony Booth attended St Edmund&#x27;s Infants School and spent a year in hospital as a child with diphtheria. He then passed the Eleven-plus examination and attended St Mary&#x27;s College, Crosby, where he was awarded a bursary to cover the cost of his books.

His hopes of going to university were dashed when he had to leave school and get a job after his father was badly injured in an industrial accident. He then worked as a clerk in a docklands warehouse and at the United States Consulate in Liverpool, before being called up for national service with the Royal Corps of Signals.

==Acting==
Booth developed a taste for acting when posted in the Army to SHAPE in Paris. He spent five years in repertory theatre, before appearing in films and television during the 1960s. He played roles in over twenty films, including &quot;The L-Shaped Room&quot; (1962), &quot;Corruption&quot; (1968), &quot;The Girl with a Pistol&quot; (1968), &quot;Brannigan&quot; (1975), &quot;Priest&quot; (1994) and &quot;Owd Bob&quot; (1997). He appeared early in the run of the television series &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in 1960 and in an episode of &quot;The Avengers&quot;, but it was his role as the left-wing son-in-law in &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot; (1965) that brought him recognition.

Booth made guest appearances in many other television series. He starred alongside Robin Askwith in the &quot;Confessions of ...&quot; British sex comedy film series as Sidney Noggett between 1974 and 1977. These were &quot;Confessions of a Window Cleaner&quot;, &quot;Confessions of a Pop Performer&quot;, &quot;Confessions of a Driving Instructor&quot; and &quot;Confessions from a Holiday Camp&quot;.

From 1985 to 1986, Booth appeared as pub landlord Ted Pilkington in the short-lived ITV soap &quot;Albion Market&quot;. He starred in the 1998 short film &quot;The Duke&quot;, playing an elderly man who tells his adoring grandson that he is John Wayne. In 2001, Booth appeared in several episodes of &quot;Family Affairs&quot; playing Barry Hurst, Sadie Hargreaves&#x27; brother-in-law.

Booth played a tramp named Nobby Stuart in a special two-hander episode of &quot;EastEnders&quot; in 2003. In 2007, he also played a tramp called Errol Michaels in &quot;Emmerdale&quot;. Each of these characters played the purpose of a spiritual guide to a down-and-out character: in &quot;EastEnders&quot; Alfie Moon (played by Shane Richie), and in &quot;Emmerdale&quot; Bob Hope (Tony Audenshaw).

==Personal life==
Booth was married four times and had eight daughters by five women. By his first wife Gale Howard, he had two daughters, Cherie and Lyndsey. Cherie, a King&#x27;s Counsel, is married to the former Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair. While Booth was a long-standing supporter of the Labour Party, his politics differed from those of his daughter and her husband.

With his third wife, Nancy Jaeger, he had a daughter, Joanna.

Booth had five other daughters with partners he did not marry. He left Gale, his first wife, in 1961 for Julia Allan, with whom he had two daughters Jenia and Bronwen. He had a daughter, Lucy Thomas, in 1967 with Ann Gannon, who worked in radio sales, after a brief relationship; this did not become known publicly until 2002. His relationship with Pamela Smith, which began in the 1960s, lasted 13 years; the couple had Booth&#x27;s other two daughters, Emma and Lauren Booth, a broadcaster and journalist. Booth&#x27;s grandchildren include Euan Blair and Nicky Blair.

Booth nearly burned to death in November 1979 when, during a drunken attempt to get into his locked flat, he fell into a drum of paraffin. He spent six months in hospital and needed 26 skin graft operations. Shortly after his discharge from hospital, he went to visit an &#x27;old flame&#x27;, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; actress Pat Phoenix. She took him in and nursed him back to full health, and they lived together for six years. Phoenix&#x27;s own health subsequently declined, and the pair married a few days before her death from lung cancer in 1986.

In a rebuke to the British government&#x27;s treatment of pensioners, Booth retired to Blacklion, County Cavan, in Ireland in 2003, but returned and lived in Broadbottom, east of Manchester. In 2006 he said he was the victim of anti-English bias while living in Ireland.

Booth was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 2004. He suffered a stroke in 2010. He also had chronic heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Booth died on 25 September 2017 at home, aged 85.

In March 2019, Booth&#x27;s widow Steph published the book &quot;Married to Alzheimer&#x27;s: A Life Less Ordinary with Tony Booth&quot;, a memoir about her time caring for her husband.

<doc id="694026" wikidata="Q863731" url="?curid=694026" title="Bing (company)">
<text>Bing or Gebrüder Bing (&quot;Bing brothers&quot;) was a German toy company founded in 1863 in Nuremberg, Germany by two brothers, Ignaz Bing and Adolf Bing, initially producing metal kitchen utensils, but best remembered for its extensive lines of model trains and live steam engines.

==History==
The company produced fine pewter and copper tableware before embarking on toy production in 1880; their first teddy bears were released in 1907. By the early 20th century, Bing was the largest toy company in the world, and Bing&#x27;s factory in Nuremberg was the largest toy factory in the world. Although Bing produced numerous toys, it is best remembered today for toy trains and live steam powered toys. In addition to toys, it made scientific and educational novelties and a vast range of kitchenware, tableware, office equipment, record players, electrical goods, etc.

The &quot;Nuremberg Style&quot; of manufacturing toys on steel sheets with lithographed designs that were stamped out of the metal, formed, and assembled using tabs and slots, was perfected by Bing. This manufacturing method was widespread in the 1950s, long after the Bing company had been dissolved.

===Toy Trains===

Bing&#x27;s first trains hit the market in the 1880s. When Märklin formalized several standards for track gauges in 1891, Bing adopted them and added O gauge by 1895 and gauge III (2.5 inches), causing confusion as Marklin Gauge III became Bing gauge IV (3 inches). 
In the 1922, under the auspices of Bassett-Lowke, Bing introduced a still-smaller gauge, half that of O gauge at 16.0 mm (0.625 in), called &quot;Bing Table Railway&quot;. The Bing Table Railway was the basis of the later OO gauge at 4 mm scale (1:72 scale) in the United Kingdom and HO gauge at 3.5 mm scale (1:87 scale) in North America and on the Continental Europe but with a gauge of .

Bing produced numerous items for export, which were then sold either under its name or to other companies. Bing made trains styled for the British market for Bassett-Lowke and A. W. Gamage, and it produced trains for the North American market, which it exported and marketed on its own. Early in the 20th century, Bing jockeyed for market share with the Ives Manufacturing Company, who did not surpass Bing in sales for good until 1910. Throughout their histories, the two companies frequently copied one another&#x27;s designs. Sometimes, the two companies use the same catalog number on their competing products. Due to cheap German labor and low shipping and duty costs, Bing often undercut the prices of its U.S. competitors. By 1914, Bing had 5,000 employees. By comparison, Märklin employed 600.

===Live Steam engines===

The range of live steam engines included stationary engines, railway locomotives, road vehicles, and boats. Steam engines were made throughout most of the company&#x27;s history. From the start, they made stationary engines and mobile models. The stationary models were generic in outline and not representative of particular prototypes. Mobile engines were more recognisable, and the more expensive versions could almost be classed as scale models, albeit inaccurate. The Railway locomotive versions were often very similar in outline to their clockwork and electric models.


==World War I and its aftermath==
World War I forced Bing out of the export market while the company was at its peak. In 1916, Ives and the A. C. Gilbert Company formed the Toy Manufacturers Association and lobbied to protect the growing U.S. toy manufacturing industry, which had grown without foreign competition. As a result, tariffs on German toys rose from 35 percent to 70 percent. Additionally, the death of the company&#x27;s founder, Ignaz Bing, in 1918 created a void in leadership.

German wages rose after the war, as did shipping costs and inflation. This created an unfavorable climate for German exports. Meanwhile, the Lionel Corporation produced advertising that criticized the manufacturing methods of its competitors&#x27; trains. Although targeted mainly at Ives, this ad campaign also hurt Bing&#x27;s image because Bing&#x27;s methods were similar. Bing struggled to sell through its old inventory and misjudged demand. When the market evaporated for its 1 gauge trains, it re-gauged some models to O gauge, where they looked oversized, and re-gauged other models to Lionel&#x27;s Standard gauge, where they looked undersized.

Despite these setbacks, by 1921, Bing had re-established itself in the U.S. market, mainly via sales through the catalog retailer Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. However, by 1925, Lionel was also selling through Sears, and Bing quickly found itself squeezed out of the market. Bing attempted to compensate by increasing its presence in Canada, where it competed with mixed success with American Flyer.

==Interwar decline==
By 1927, Bing was in severe financial trouble, and the company&#x27;s president, Stephan Bing, and his son left the company, initially going to work with another Nuremberg-based toy firm.

In 1932, Bing was in liquidation, and the Bings, who were Jewish, fled to England because of the rise of Adolf Hitler. The company went out of business for good in 1933. Much of its tooling was acquired by Bub, a rival toy company.

Stephan Bing helped to start the British company Trix. Other Bing executives started the similarly named company Trix Express.

==Identifying Bing Products==

Bing toys, kitchenware, and other products can be identified and dated by variations in the company trademark.

<text>Hampole is a small village and civil parish in the City of Doncaster in South Yorkshire, England, close to the border with West Yorkshire. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, the eastern boundary of the parish is marked by the Great North Road (now the A1), and the parish lies in what was once the Barnsdale Forest. It had a population of 187 in 2001, increasing to 203 at the 2011 Census, which includes the neighbouring village of Skelbrooke. Hampole lies on the A638 between Doncaster and Wakefield.

==History==
Hampole is mentioned in the Domesday Book as having two ploughlands, woodlands and three villagers. The name of the village derives from the Old English name of &quot;Hana&quot; and &quot;pōl&quot;, meaning &quot;Hana&#x27;s pool&quot;, the first part being someone&#x27;s name. The priory at Hampole was founded by Avici de Tania. When the priory was closed during the Dissolution, it had a complement of 14 nuns.

Hampole railway station opened in February 1886 and closed on 7 January 1952.

The parish includes the villages of Hampole, Skelbrooke and Barnsdale. The parish of Hampole is part of the Sprotbrough Ward of Doncaster Council.

By the A1 road, near Skelbrooke, is Robin Hood&#x27;s Well, with its stone cover designed by John Vanbrugh. Little John&#x27;s Well lies to the west of Hampole village.

Hampole lies about two miles north west of the model village of Woodlands; and of Highfields Wood, where there is a brook known as Robin Hood&#x27;s Brook.

Notable buildings include the Grade II listed Church of St Michael and All Angels in Skelbrooke, Hampole Manor with Hampole Manor Cottage, and an 18th-century barn on Steep Hill Lane. To the south of the village is the Hampole Wind Farm, run by the company Good Energy. The site, which started generating in spring 2014, consists of four turbines generating enough electricity to power 5,400 homes per year.

<doc id="694064" wikidata="Q4944427" url="?curid=694064" title="Ervia">
<text>Ervia, previously known as Bord Gáis or Bord Gáis Éireann (; meaning &quot;Gas Board of Ireland&quot;), is a multi-utility company distributing pipeline natural gas and dark fibre services in Ireland. The state-owned company has built an extensive network across Ireland.

In 2014 the Bord Gáis Energy division was sold to a consortium led by Centrica, and the Bord Gáis name was transferred as part of the sale. Bord Gáis Éireann was therefore renamed Ervia in June 2014 and as a result no longer sold gas directly to customers. Ervia was the ultimate parent company of dark fibre operator Aurora Telecom. In June 2024, all functions, assets and liabilities of Ervia were transferred to Gas Networks Ireland and Ervia was dissolved.

==History==
Bord Gáis Éireann was established as a semi-state company by the Irish government in 1975 to replace a series of private-sector small city-based gas companies, some of whom had got into financial trouble. The company was originally established as a private limited company by shares, Bord Gáis Éireann Teoranta, before being converted to a statutory corporation under the Gas Act 1976, the primary legislation under which BGE operates.

The oldest of the small private companies was the Alliance and Dublin Consumers&#x27; Gas Company, which had been founded in the early nineteenth century by Daniel O&#x27;Connell, a prominent Irish politician and Lord Mayor of Dublin. After initially supplying the company (known simply as Dublin Gas by the 1980s) with wholesale natural gas, Bord Gáis acquired the assets of the company when it went into receivership in 1987, including its head office in D&#x27;Olier Street, Dublin. Other town gas companies were acquired by Bord Gáis in Cork, Limerick, Clonmel, and Kilkenny.

In 2002, Bord Gáis Éireann sold the landmark art deco Dublin Gas head office building in D&#x27;Olier Street, Dublin to Trinity College Dublin. This building was designed by Robinson and Keefe Architects in about 1928. The exterior is clad in grey and black stone. The interior which was originally lit by Gasoliers still remains as a protected structure. Bord Gáis moved to purpose built premises in Foley Street, Dublin, which is now the main offices of Bord Gáis Energy. Bord Gáis now have offices at Lower Mount Street, Dublin.

For nearly two decades the main supply of gas available for Bord Gáis came from a Marathon Petroleum owned gasfield near Kinsale, off the Cork coast. This gas field had been found in 1971, the same year as the foundation of the Nuclear Energy Board. This gas field comes ashore at Inch, County Cork.

===Deregulation of the Irish gas market===
Beginning in the early 2000s Ireland&#x27;s state owned public utilities underwent major reform thanks to the adoption by EU members of the European Union&#x27;s Third Energy Package. This required vertically integrated utilities such as Bord Gáis Éireann to legally demarcate and split into two roles: the Transmission System Operator (TSO) and the Distribution System Operator (DSO) although a combined DSO/TSO was permissible as long as the two were ring-fenced from one another This resulted in two new &quot;arms length&quot; entities being created inside the Bord Gáis group; Bord Gáis Networks and Bord Gáis Energy Supply. A similar situation took place with the Electricity Supply Board with it being split into two main units, legally distinct and separate; ESB Networks and ESB Customer Supply, now called Electric Ireland, although both being owned by the ESB Group.

On 18 February 2009 Bord Gáis Energy Supply rebranded as Bord Gáis Energy and competed in a new, fully deregulated gas market, legally separate and distinct from the rest of Bord Gáis Éireann. As part of the overall opening up of the energy market in Ireland as a whole Bord Gáis Energy entered the deregulated electricity market offering dual fuel bundles to consumers. Other companies including Airtricity and Electric Ireland also began competing with Bord Gáis Energy in the gas sector, with Bord Gáis Networks being impartial towards all companies who wished to utilise the gas network. It was expected BGE would be no different than any other gas provider.

===Sale of Bord Gáis Energy===
A condition of the EU/IMF bailout programme for Ireland required the Irish government to sell off some state owned assets to help pay down loans and reduce Ireland&#x27;s debt burden. In February 2012 the Irish government announced it would sell Bord Gáis Energy as required under the bailout terms.

In March 2014 Bord Gáis Éireann confirmed it would sell its customer supply arm Bord Gáis Energy to a consortium made up of Centrica, Brookfield Renewable Energy and iCON Infrastructure to the value of €1.1 billion. The sale involved the splitting of the group&#x27;s retail unit among the three buyers. The main retail division would be bought by Centrica, while its wind assets under SWS would be acquired by Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners and iCON infrastructure acquiring Northern Ireland based Firmus Energy. As part of the deal the Bord Gáis name would go to Centrica requiring the rump entity to be renamed.

In June 2014 Bord Gáis Éireann was renamed Ervia becoming a holding company of three distinct but complementary utility firms: Gas Networks Ireland (formerly Bord Gáis Networks), Irish Water and Aurora Telecom.

===Dissolution===
In October 2020, the government of Ireland decided that Ervia would be dissolved and its functions integrated into Gas Networks Ireland.

The Gas (Amendment) and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2024, an act of the Oireachtas, provided for the dissolution of Ervia. This took effect on 1 June 2024. This left Gas Networks Ireland as a standalone entity owned by the State.

==Subsidiaries==

===Gas Networks Ireland===
Gas Networks Ireland () owns, and is responsible for the operation, maintenance and development of Ireland&#x27;s natural gas transmission and distribution networks, consisting of over 14,600 km of pipeline. The network provides gas to customers in all major Irish cities, along with several towns across the country. Numerous suppliers provide gas services to customers and businesses via this network of pipelines.

Two interconnectors link the pipeline network to Scotland (with a spur from one of the interconnectors linking to the Isle of Man supplying the Manx Utilities Authority).

Most of its modern gas supply is imported, though a new gas field known as the Corrib field off the County Mayo coast came on stream in 2015. However, Ervia only purchases a small amount of the offtake; the majority is traded on the Intercontinental Exchange.

===Aurora Telecom===
Aurora Telecom specialises in providing dark fibre services to the private sector. Due to being a subsidiary company of Gas Networks Ireland, Aurora Telecom is able to utilise the former&#x27;s extensive gas pipeline network to lay fibre optic lines, principally in Dublin, though with an owned and operated network now stretching from the capital to Cork, Limerick and Galway via several towns including Athlone, Mullingar and Ennis.

==Former operations==

===Bord Gáis Energy===
Bord Gáis Energy was previously the retail (industrial, commercial and residential) division of Bord Gáis Éireann. In February 2012 the Irish government announced its intention to sell Bord Gáis Energy as part of the reforms required following the banking crisis bailout and finalised the deal in June 2014. Today Bord Gáis Energy is a completely independent entity from Ervia.

===Bord Gáis retail network===
Bord Gáis Éireann maintained twelve stores (branded Energy Supply Stores) around the country, however they are run on a franchise basis and not by Bord Gáis itself. In 2002 Bord Gáis Natural Gas Showroom in D&#x27;Olier Street, operated by the company itself, was closed, in 2006 its Cork company-owned showroom was also closed.

===Irish Water===

The Water Services Act 2013 created Irish Water as a subsidiary of Bord Gáis Éireann, to provide &quot;safe, clean and affordable water and waste water services&quot; to water users in Ireland. Public concerns on operational, documentation, and financial issues were highlighted throughout the initial months of the subsidiary&#x27;s operations.

Irish Water is accountable to two regulatory bodies: the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), the economic regulator for the water industry; and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the environmental regulator.

On 31 December 2022, Irish Water was renamed Uisce Éireann. On 1 January 2023, Uisce Éireann was separated from Ervia and established as a standalone national water authority.

===SWS===
In late 2009 Bord Gáis Éireann bought the wind energy company SWS.

However, as part of the large scale EU/IMF mandated divestiture of many state assets mid 2014 the company was sold to Canadian energy firm Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners for US$680 million as part of the sale of Bord Gáis Energy to British energy giant Centrica.

===Firmus Energy===
Bord Gáis had a plan to develop the gas market in Northern Ireland. A pipeline from Carrickfergus to Derry was completed in October 2004 and now serves Coolkeeragh Power Station. A second pipeline, known as the south–north pipeline, was commissioned in October 2006. It runs from Gormanston in the Republic of Ireland to join the Carrick/Derry pipeline near Antrim creating an all-Ireland network and providing redundancy in case of problems with either Scotland - Northern Ireland pipeline or the Scotland - Ireland interconnectors.

The Utility Regulator for Northern Ireland awarded Bord Gáis a licence to supply homes and businesses in the towns and cities near the two pipelines - Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Banbridge, Craigavon, Derry, Limavady and Newry - where the local subsidiaries of BG used the trading name of &quot;Firmus Energy&quot;. On 1 December 2005, Firmus launched their first supply in Northern Ireland, to the large Michelin tyre factory in Ballymena. On 25 April 2006 Firmus connected its first residential customers in Derry.

As part of the Irish government&#x27;s disposal of state owned assets Firmus Energy was sold in March 2014 to iCON Infrastructure.

===Gaslink===
On 4 July 2008, an &quot;arms-length&quot; subsidiary of Bord Gáis, Gaslink was established to perform the role of transmission and distribution system operator. However, as part of cost-cutting measures on 1 August 2015 Gaslink was abolished and its responsibilities rolled back into Gas Networks Ireland.

<doc id="694080" wikidata="Q783404" url="?curid=694080" title="Hooton Pagnell">
<text>Hooton Pagnell is a village and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster in South Yorkshire, England, on the border with West Yorkshire. It lies on the B6422 road, between Brodsworth and South Elmsall and is at an elevation of around above sea level. It had a population of 211 at the 2001 Census, reducing slightly to 201 at the 2011 Census. The name of the village derives from Ralph de Paganel (sometimes spelled Paynell), a Norman who was a tenant-in-chief in Yorkshire named in the Domesday Book and an extensive landowner.

==History==

The first recorded mention of Hooton Pagnell is found in Domesday Book, where it is called &quot;Hotone&quot; (&quot;The Town on the Hill&quot; or &quot;The High Dwelling Place&quot;). &quot;In Hotone and Bileham Earl Edwin had one manor of ten carucetes for geld, and ten ploughs may be there.. . . . . . . . . In the time of King Edward it was worth eight pounds, now one hundred shillings.&quot; The , that was in 1086 the extent of the cultivated land in Hooton, were given to Robert, Count of Mortain. He in turn sublet the land to Richard de Surdeval, a Norman knight.

The village was variously called &quot;Hoton&quot;, &quot;Howton&quot;, &quot;Hutton&quot;, the second part of the name being added during the time of the Paganals, a distinguished Norman family into whose hands the manor passed towards the end of the 11th Century. The second part of the name is variously spelt - &quot;Paynel&quot;, “Painell&quot;, &quot;Pannell&quot;, &quot;Pagnell&quot;. Hence, &quot;Hooton Pagnell&quot; - &quot;The High Dwelling Place of the Paynels&#x27;.

The village received a Royal Charter in 1254 entitling it to hold a market on Thursdays and an annual three-day fair. A butter cross was built, the base of which survives, but the market and fair soon ceased. However the fair has since been revived and is held very first Sunday in July. The ownership of Hooton remained in the hands of the Paganels and their heirs till the reign of Edward IV through the names of Paganel, and through marriage, Luterel and Hilton.

===Hooton Pagnell Hall and the Estate===

Much of the property in the village belongs to the estate of Hooton Pagnell Hall, which has been in the family of former Lord Mayor of London Sir Patience Warde since the 17th century. Before that it was owned by Sir Richard Hutton of Goldsborough Hall who bought the estate in 1605. Hutton&#x27;s descendant Col Robert Byerley, of Byerley Turk fame, sold the hall and estate to Sir Patience Warde in 1703. With increased wealth, the Hall was extensively restored in Victorian times: following the sale of many large properties to meet death duties, the estate is now owned by a family trust. Mary Betty Norbury received the Hooton Pagnell estate as a gift from her father, Col William St Andrew Warde-Aldam, in 1952, and she and her husband assumed the surname of Warde-Norbury by Royal Licence in 1958.

===Hooton Pagnell Church===
Close to the hall is the parish church of &quot;All Saints&quot;: a Norman square-towered church. Originally built in Norman times, the church was white-washed during the Reformation. With the revival of ritual as a result of the Oxford Movement, the church was restored to a more High Church style in the 1870s by the owner of the estate, Julia Warde-Aldam, who also restored the church in the neighbouring village of Frickley. The Warde-Aldams&#x27; wealth was based on land-ownership but was boosted significantly by the exploitation of coal reserves in the estates land with the sinking of Frickley colliery, located in South Elmsall, West Yorkshire.

===St Chad&#x27;s Hostel===

In 1902 the vicar of Hooton Pagnell, Revd Frederick Samuel Willoughby, opened St Chad&#x27;s Hostel in the village to prepare men of limited means to enter theological college. He was supported in this by Lady of the Manor Julia Warde-Aldam. Initially students were housed in the vicarage, then, as numbers grew, in surrounding farms; before a dedicated purpose-built hostel, funded by Warde-Aldam, was opened in 1904.

In 1904, further financial support from Liverpool businessman Douglas Horsfall made it possible to establish St Chad&#x27;s Hall in Durham as a sister institution to the hostel.

The hostel continued to operate as a preliminary place of study until 1916, when it was requisitioned as a war hospital and all teaching was moved to Durham. The hostel briefly re-opened after the war, but closed permanently in 1921.

The hostel building was bequeathed to the village by the Warde-Aldam family as a village club, and now operates as a pub, &quot;The Hostel&quot;.

==Politics==

Being an estate village, politics were traditionally dominated by the local landowners and by the church since Hooton Pagnell has its own vicar up to 1979. As the economics of the village have changed, it has become a commuter village in one of the very few Conservative wards in the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster. The Village lies in the constituency of Doncaster North and the local MP is Ed Miliband.

<text>On 29 May 2004, a Saturday, four men armed with guns and bombs attacked two oil industry installations and a residential compound, in Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia—the hub of the Saudi oil industry. Over approximately 25 hours, the gunmen, describing themselves as members of &quot;The Jerusalem Squadron&quot; or &quot;Jerusalem Brigade&quot;, killed 22 and injured 25, mainly third country national personnel working in Khobar.

Their targets were the Arab Petroleum Investments Corporation building and the Al-Khobar Petroleum Centre, and a foreign workers&#x27; housing complex, the Oasis Compound, in the Gulf city of Khobar. Their victims included 19 foreigners from nine countries—eight people from India, three from the Philippines, two from Sri Lanka, one each from Sweden, Italy, the United Kingdom, the United States, South Africa and Egypt. According to witnesses the attackers asked the hostages if they were Christian or Muslim, letting the Muslims go with a lecture, and shooting the non-Muslims. One victim was tied to the back of a vehicle and dragged through the street.

==Casualties==

==Perpetrators==
Most news describe the attackers being four in number. Claiming responsibility was a previously unheard-of militant group calling itself &quot;The Jerusalem Squadron&quot; or &#x27;Jerusalem Brigade&#x27; of the &#x27;Mujahedin of the Arabian Peninsula&#x27;—a local Saudi Arabia-based faction of al-Qaeda. The group said it was attacking &quot;Zionists and Crusaders&quot; who are in Saudi Arabia to &quot;steal our oil and resources.&quot; According to the then Saudi Ambassador in Washington, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the goal of the terrorists was to harm Saudi Arabia&#x27;s stability and harm its economy. An audio tape was released in which Abdulaziz al-Muqrin, thought to be one of al-Qaeda&#x27;s leaders in Saudi Arabia, took responsibility. Jamestown Foundation&#x27;s &quot;Terrorism Monitor&quot; identified its leader as Turki bin Fahd al-Moteiri (known as Fawwaz al-Nashami).

Kidnappers asked the hostages if they were Christian or Muslim, letting the Muslims go, and slitting the throats of non-Muslims.

In a 3000 word account of the killings posted on a website by the operation&#x27;s commander, Fawaz Bin Mohammed Al-Nashmi, Nashmi describes the killing of an Italian expatriate after the captive has pleaded for his life. 
Brother Husayn spotted the Italian infidel lout. He pointed his weapon at him and ordered him to approach. The infidel lout approached. We examined his identification papers and decided to contact Al-Jazeera so that he could address his countrymen and send them a message warning against fighting a war against Islam and its people. We would then cut his throat to send a message to the Italians who are fighting our brothers in Iraq and to the idiot leader of Italy, who wants to confront the lions of Islam. We contacted Al-Jazeera. I told the announcer to talk to him [the Italian]. He began to talk to him. The announcer asked me, &quot;Does he speak English?&quot; I told the announcer, &quot;Do you have Italian translators?&quot; He said, &quot;Yes.&quot; I said, &quot;So let him speak his language.&quot; He spoke for several minutes. I asked the announcer, &quot;Did you record that?&quot; He said, &quot;Yes.&quot; Then the hero Nimr cut his throat.

Saudi security forces have been criticized for allowing the perpetrators to move freely from one target to another as late as five hours into the attack, to eat and sleep at the hotel and to give an interview to al-Jazeera television over the phone during their operation. Government forces also failed to prevent the attackers from fighting their way out of the compound and escaping. 
According to author Michael Griffin, the seeming &quot;impotence&quot; of the security forces and the &quot;stolen SUVs, pilfered uniforms and a freedom in their savagery&quot; of the attackers, may indicate that the attacks were &quot;condoned, if not encouraged, by the security forces set up&quot; to protect the foreign workers.

==Timeline of the attack==

===Sources for attack details===
Various accounts exist of the precise details of this attack.

===Al-Khobar Petroleum Centre===
At 06:45 a group of four terrorists, separate from the group that attacked the Oasis compound, arrive in a vehicle and shot at guards and employees around the front gate of the Al-Khobar Petroleum Centre, which is next to the DHL building on the main Doha to Khobar road. An American and two Filipinos protecting the American were killed.

===Arab Petroleum Investments Corporation Building===
At 7:15 terrorists in a vehicle attacked the Apicorp Compound. The compound is a quarter of a mile away down the Khobar Dammam highway next to Raka compound. They used an RPG on the gatehouse and killed two security guards. A school bus was coming out at the time and was shot at, killing a 10-year-old Egyptian boy who was the son of an Apicorp employee.

Michael Hamilton, British, a leading member of the Apicorp Corporation, who had just dropped his wife off, arrived at the gate. His car was shot at and the gunmen dragged him out of the car still alive and tied him to the back of their four-wheel-drive vehicle, driving up the Raka road to the Dammam highway. Hamilton&#x27;s facial features were unrecognizable when his body and car were later found dumped under a causeway. The terrorist vehicle with Hamilton tied behind made it as far as the intersection lights before a Saudi civilian rammed their car off the road. The terrorist shot the Saudi dead before he could get out of his car. The police shot the terrorists before they could make their escape. In honour of Michael Hamilton&#x27;s death, British International School of Al Khobar (BISAK) named one of their halls after him.

===Oasis 3 Compound===
At 7:30 six terrorists scaled the walls of Oasis 3 compound. Another five drove up to the main Vehicle Check Point. A civilian car was in front of the attackers and a school bus behind in the queue. The checkpoint had two closed gates. A car drove through one gate, was inspected after the first gate closed, and then the second gate opened to let the car through. On the morning of the attack, the second was continuously open, so when the first gate opened, the terrorists drove straight through the second gate. While doing so, a terrorist opened the sunroof of their vehicle and killed the two armed guards with a machine gun. Turning back, he fired on the school bus, killing two children and wounding four children. 5-year-old and 7-year-old children were critically wounded.

The terrorists then drove into the main compound area. A security guard then got the children off the school bus and conducted them to a safe area in the compound.

They then exited their vehicle and moved on foot into the residential complex. They kicked in the doors and slit the throats of any non-Muslims they could find. Among those murdered were an Italian cook, Antonio Amato (35), and a Swedish maître d&#x27;hôtel, Magnus Johansson (50). Both were beheaded. The terrorists killed one American—Frank Floyd, an assistant marketing director for Resources Sciences Arabia Ltd. Most of the killings took place inside the compound&#x27;s Italian restaurant, Casa Mia, where Amato and Johansson worked. According to an account by terrorist Fawaz al-Nashimi, captives were also executed with bullets to the head.

In the morning, the terrorists ate breakfast in the restaurant. They then returned to the first floor with the intention of killing Hindus. Eight Indians were killed. Al-Nashmi lists 3 cohorts, Nimr al-Baqmi, Husayn, and Nadir.

Booby-traps were placed at the exits of the Soha Towers Hotel. Al-Nashmi and two cohorts then escaped over the wall and stole a car to make a getaway. This was despite the compound being surrounded by soldiers and reporters with live television. &quot;We were now on a road with trees shadowing the way, and all the security forces thought we were still in the hotel,&quot; Nashmi wrote. Nimr al-Baqmi was wounded while firing out of his vehicle, and was captured.

===Rescue operation===
By 21:30 Saudi Special Emergency Forces had surrounded the complex and extracted the school bus children who were hiding in an underground parking garage. A few British nursery workers were rescued from the Oasis compound, and were returned to the Las Dunas compound, where their families and friends had been waiting.

At 2:00 the next morning Saudi Special Emergency Forces attempted to enter the booby-trapped hotel. Several were injured in two explosions, and the group pulled back after receiving threats from the remaining terrorists to kill the hostages. At 02:30 two American military officers were injured and subsequently admitted to SAAD Specialist hospital and later flown out to Kuwait.

Saudi forces in four National Guard Kawasaki KC113 helicopters arrived at 06:30 and were lowered onto the roof of the Soha Hotel to storm the building, while ground attackers fired into the building as a diversion. Following the operation, Saudi authorities announced that all the hostages were free and that they had killed two terrorists and captured another. Apparently, most of the attackers had fled before the Saudi raid. However, according to the Jamestown Terrorism Monitor, the terrorist cell was miles away by the next morning when the counter-terrorism forces landing on the hotel rooftop, and none of the terrorists were killed.

The Saudi Interior Ministry issued a statement claiming 41 hostages had been rescued by the commandos. According to a Western diplomat the hostages had been hiding in parts of the complex to avoid being killed by the gunmen.

===Downtown Khobar===
During the same day, shooting broke out in downtown Khobar, about twenty minutes away from the Oasis 3 compound. A vehicle was reported to be driving around the Khobar area with four armed men on board. They proceeded to kill and injure another 11 security and military personnel located at approximately five other compounds with one being confirmed as the Golden Belt. Another man, an Indian national was shot dead while his car was driving.

===Emergency response in schools away from attack sites===
The British and American schools around Khobar and Dhahran were put on lock-down during the terror attacks. In Dhahran, British Grammar School and the Dhahran primary and middle schools as well as the high school (all on the same campus next to the American consulate), children were not released from school until over an hour after the usual time.

International Indian School, Dammam (IISD) is a school about 30 minutes away in Dammam. Several of their students lived in the Dhahran/Khobar area. The school was on lockdown until it was time for school to dismiss, with many of the pupils not knowing what was happening. Many area schools ended the term a few weeks early due to the events.

==Aftermath of the attacks==
Following the attacks, some foreign workers either fled the country or were evacuated by the companies they worked for, as they felt it was too dangerous to stay. The attack provided &quot;a significant morale boost for al-Qaeda&quot; according to the Jamestown Terrorism Monitor. However, an expert from the Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies interviewed by the New York Times stated the lack of strategic importance of the sites indicates the weakness of the extremists.

World crude oil prices rose by 6.1% to $42 a barrel after the attack.

Several of the nearby compounds like al Mohawis, Rolaco, TIG, al Bustan, and others had around 3 to 6 Saudi army soldiers stationed at the gates checking each car thoroughly before allowing them in (including residents). Security at Oasis was hyped to the point where there was a lane out of each of the surrounding streets that was taken and dedicated to security lines. Each lane was blocked from the road by barricades, and eyewitnesses describe it as pretty much impenetrable. There were several stages of army protection including thorough checkups. Each army personnel was armed with machine guns. Several schools shut down a few weeks early including ISG schools like Dhahran Academy and ISG Dammam.

In early 2016, Saudi Arabia executed some of the surviving terrorists who were arrested in 2004. They were executed alongside Shiekh Nimr.

==In popular cuture==
The event was featured in the 2007 American action thriller film &quot;The Kingdom&quot;.

<text>Seax-Wica, or sometimes Seax Witchcraft, is a tradition of neopagan practice blending aspects of Wicca with the iconography of Anglo-Saxon paganism, while not seeking to reconstruct the early mediaeval religion itself.

The tradition was founded in 1973 by Raymond Buckland, an English-born high priest of Gardnerian Wicca who had recently moved to the United States. His 1974 book &quot;The Tree&quot; was written as a definitive guide to Seax-Wica, and subsequently republished in 2005 as &quot;Buckland&#x27;s Book of Saxon Witchcraft&quot;.

The tradition primarily honours two principal deities: Woden and Freya, representations of the Wiccan deities the Horned God and the Mother Goddess. The tradition uses ceremonial tools such as the spear and runes.

== Openness ==
Seax-Wica does not employ any secrecy oath. &quot;Buckland&#x27;s Book of Saxon Witchcraft&quot; was written in mind that the reader would already be well versed in the various techniques of Witchcraft and Wiccan ritual. However, Buckland has pointed out that his &quot;Complete Book of Witchcraft&quot; gives instructions on how to proceed when no tools are available. These instructions are enough to allow one to begin, self-initiate, and consecrate one&#x27;s first tools.

== Organisation ==
Seax-Wica allows self-dedication as entry into its tradition, as well as solitary practice. In the Seax tradition, covens work by a form of democracy, electing, un-electing, and re-electing coven officers, the high priest and priestess. Within ritual settings, there are the thegn, a type of sergeant-at-arms/guard/watchman, who can also be responsible for the covenstead (the meeting place of the coven), or guarding a ceremony being performed; there is also a scribe/secretary, who keeps most, if not all, of the coven&#x27;s records. The word &quot;&quot;Thegn&quot;, or &quot;Thane&quot;&quot; is an Anglo-Saxon title (&quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot;: þeg(e)n meaning &quot;a servant, one who does service for another.&quot;)

Buckland was not the head of the tradition, but is respected as its founder, and continued to practice and contribute to it, until his death on September 27, 2017.

<doc id="694134" wikidata="Q4045426" url="?curid=694134" title="Noindex">
<text>The noindex value of an HTML robots meta tag requests that automated Internet bots avoid indexing a web page. Reasons why one might want to use this meta tag include advising robots not to index a very large database, web pages that are very transitory, web pages that are under development, web pages that one wishes to keep slightly more private, or the printer and mobile-friendly versions of pages. Since the burden of honoring a website&#x27;s noindex tag lies with the author of the search robot, sometimes these tags are ignored. Also the interpretation of the noindex tag is sometimes slightly different from one search engine company to the next.

== Noindexing entire pages ==

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
 &lt;meta name=&quot;robots&quot; content=&quot;noindex&quot;&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;Don&#x27;t index this page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
Possible values for the meta tag content are: &quot;none&quot;, &quot;all&quot;, &quot;index&quot;, &quot;noindex&quot;, &quot;nofollow&quot;, and &quot;follow&quot;. A combination of the values is also possible, for example:

&lt;meta name=&quot;robots&quot; content=&quot;noindex, follow&quot;&gt;
=== Bot-specific directives ===
The noindex directive can be restricted only to certain bots by specifying a different &quot;name&quot; value in the meta tag.
For example, to specifically block Google&#x27;s bot, specify: 

&lt;meta name=&quot;googlebot&quot; content=&quot;noindex&quot;&gt;
Or, to block Bing&#x27;s bot, specify: 

&lt;meta name=&quot;bingbot&quot; content=&quot;noindex&quot;&gt;
Or, to block Baidu&#x27;s bot, specify: 

&lt;meta name=&quot;baiduspider&quot; content=&quot;noindex&quot;&gt;
=== robots.txt file ===
A robots.txt file can be used to block crawling.

== Noindexing part of a page ==

It is also possible to exclude part of a Web page, for example navigation text, from being indexed rather than the whole page. There are various techniques for doing this; it is possible to use several in combination. Google&#x27;s main indexing spider, Googlebot, is not known to recognize any of these techniques.

=== &lt;noindex&gt; tag ===
The Russian search engine Yandex introduced a new &lt;noindex&gt; tag which prevents indexing of the content between the tags. To allow the source code to validate, alternatively can be used:

&lt;p&gt;
Do index this text.
&lt;noindex&gt;Don&#x27;t index this text.&lt;/noindex&gt;
&lt;!--noindex--&gt;Don&#x27;t index this text.&lt;!--/noindex--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
Other indexing spiders also recognize the &lt;noindex&gt; tag, including Atomz.

=== microformat ===
There is a 2005 draft microformats specification with the same functionality. The Robot Exclusion Profile looks for the attribute and value &quot;class=&quot;robots-noindex&quot;&quot; in HTML tags:

&lt;p&gt;Do index this text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;robots-noindex&quot;&gt;Don&#x27;t index this text.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;robots-noindex&quot;&gt;Don&#x27;t index this text.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;robots-noindex&quot;&gt;Don&#x27;t index this text.&lt;/p&gt;
A combination of values is also possible, for example:

&lt;div class=&quot;robots-noindex robots-follow&quot;&gt;Text.&lt;/div&gt;
=== Yahoo! ===
In 2007, Yahoo! introduced similar functionality to the microformat into its spider. However, Yahoo!&#x27;s spider is incompatible in that it looks for the value &quot;class=&quot;robots-nocontent&quot;&quot; and only this value:

&lt;p&gt;Do index this text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;robots-nocontent&quot;&gt;Don&#x27;t index this text.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;robots-nocontent&quot;&gt;Don&#x27;t index this text.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;robots-nocontent&quot;&gt;Don&#x27;t index this text.&lt;/p&gt;
=== SharePoint ===

SharePoint 2010’s iFilter excludes content inside of a tag with the attribute and value &quot;class=&quot;noindex&quot;&quot;. Inner s were initially not excluded, but this may have changed. It is also unknown whether the attribute can be applied to tags other than .
&lt;p&gt;Do index this text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;noindex&quot;&gt;Don&#x27;t index this text.&lt;/div&gt;
=== Structured comments ===
==== Google Search Appliance ====
The Google Search Appliance uses structured comments:

&lt;p&gt;
Do index this text.
&lt;!--googleoff: all--&gt;
Don&#x27;t index this text.
&lt;!--googleon: all--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
Other indexing spiders also use their own structured comments.

<text>Character assassination (CA) is a deliberate and sustained effort to damage the reputation or credibility of an individual. The phrase &quot;character assassination&quot; became popular around 1930. This concept, as a subject of scholarly study, was originally introduced by Davis (1950) in a collection of essays revealing the dangers of political smear campaigns. Six decades later Icks and Shiraev (2014) rejuvenated the term and revived academic interest by addressing and comparing a variety of historical character assassination events.

==Studying CA==
Icks and Shiraev (2014) address several political science models to explain character assassination from the attacker&#x27;s point of view. They believe that the attacker&#x27;s motivation is often based on the intent to destroy the target psychologically, or to reduce their public support or chances to succeed in a political competition. For example, during elections, attacks are often used to sway undecided voters, create uncertainty with tentative voters, or prevent defections of supporters. These attacks therefore become an effective means of manipulating voters toward a desirable action. They also facilitate the repositioning of originally favorable supporters to the ranks of the &quot;undecided&quot; or &quot;uncommitted&quot; voters.

== Narcissism ==

According to Thomas, character assassination is an intentional attempt, usually by a narcissist or their codependents, to influence the portrayal or reputation of someone in such a way as to cause others to develop an extremely negative or unappealing perception of them. It typically involves deliberate exaggeration or manipulation of facts, the spreading of rumours and deliberate misinformation to present an untrue picture of the targeted person, and unwarranted and excessive criticism.

== Psychopathy in the workplace ==

The authors of the book &quot;Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work&quot; describe a five phase model of how a typical workplace psychopath climbs to and maintains power. In phase four (confrontation), the psychopath will use techniques of character assassination to maintain their agenda.

==In politics==

In Australian politics, a Dorothy Dixer is a rehearsed or planted question asked of a government Minister by a backbencher of their own political party during Parliamentary Question Time. While intended to enable a Minister to discuss or address concerns about the subject asked of him, a Dixer will often conclude with &quot;Is the Minister aware of any alternative policies?&quot; This addition allows the Minister to launch into often aggressive attacks on the opposition, which depending on the leeway offered by the Speaker (who is a member of the ruling party and thus will usually side with the Minister), can include not just attacks on Opposition policy, but attempts to character assassinate opposition members directly.

Charging an opponent with character assassination may have political benefits. In the hearings for Clarence Thomas&#x27; nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States, supporters claimed that both Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill were victims of character assassination.

==In a totalitarian regime==
The effect of a character assassination driven by an individual is not equal to that of a state-driven campaign.
The state-sponsored destruction of reputations, fostered by political propaganda and cultural mechanisms, can have more far-reaching consequences. One of the earliest signs of a society&#x27;s compliance to loosening the reins on the perpetration of crimes (and even massacres) with total impunity is when a government favors or directly encourages a campaign aimed at destroying the dignity and reputation of its adversaries, and the public accepts its allegations without question. The mobilisation toward ruining the reputation of adversaries is the prelude to the mobilisation of violence in order to annihilate them. Generally, official dehumanisation has preceded the physical assault of the victims.

Specific examples include Zersetzung, by the Stasi secret service agency of East Germany, and &quot;kompromat&quot; in Russia. It was also prevalent during the Red Scare in the United States, being carried out by both the government and the media.

==The International Society for the Study of Character Assassination==
The International Society for the Study of Character Assassination (ISSCA) specializes in the academic study and research of how character attacks and character assassinations have been executed in both history and during contemporary times. In July 2011, scholars from nine countries gathered at the University of Heidelberg, Germany, to debate &quot;the art of smear and defamation in history and today&quot;. They formed a group to study character assassination throughout the ages. The group included historians, political scientists, and political psychologists.

==Research Lab for Character Assassination and Reputation Politics==
Founded in 2016 in cooperation with the ISSCA, the Research Lab for Character Assassination and Reputation Politics (CARP) includes scholars with disciplinary homes in psychology, history, communication and public relations. With investigators from George Mason University, the University of Baltimore, and the University of Amsterdam, the CARP team focuses efforts along three main dimensions: research on historical and contemporary examples of character assassination; education for academic and public audiences about character assassination causes, impacts and prevention; and risk assessment to determine vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies for public figures concerned about their reputations. The Mason CARP website features materials about the lab and its activities. The CARP Lab additionally publishes a blog and is affiliated with the Global Informality Project, a leading online resource for the world&#x27;s open secrets, unwritten rules and hidden practices, broadly defined as &quot;ways of getting things done.&quot;

In 2017 and 2019, CARP hosted two international conferences that welcomed numerous U.S. and international researchers and academics studying different aspects of CA. The proceedings and report of the CARP 2017 conference &quot;Character Assassination in Theory and Practice&quot; can be found on the Mason website.

The CARP 2019 conference &quot;Character Assassination and Populism: Challenges and Responses&quot; featured critical input from practitioners in crisis management, journalism, and public relations. The event attracted scholars from twenty countries around the world.

In 2019, the CARP Lab published its first handbook titled &quot;Routledge Handbook of Character Assassination and Reputation Management&quot;.

<doc id="694162" wikidata="Q235832" url="?curid=694162" title="Princess Mafalda of Savoy">
<text>Princess Mafalda of Savoy (19 November 1902 – 28 August 1944) was the second daughter of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and his wife Elena of Montenegro. In 1925, at the age of 22, she married the Landgrave of Hesse, Philipp. In 1943, during World War II, she was imprisoned in the Buchenwald concentration camp, where she died. The future King Umberto II of Italy was her younger brother.

Mafalda was born a princess of Savoy. She was the second child and daughter of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and Elena of Montenegro. She was very close to her mother, and went with her mother to visit Italian military hospitals during World War I. In 1925, Mafalda married Philipp, Landgrave of Hesse. They had four children together.

In 1943, during World War II, Mafalda was tricked into going to the German Embassy, under the impression that her husband needed to speak to her. However, her husband was already imprisoned in a concentration camp, while her children had been given sanctuary in the Vatican. On her arrival at the German embassy, Mafalda was arrested and transported to Munich for questioning, then to Berlin, and finally to Buchenwald concentration camp.

On 24 August 1944, the Allies bombed Buchenwald’s ammunition factory. Mafalda suffered from burns on her left arm and face, and was found covered up to her neck in debris. Her arm soon became infected, and she had an operation done. The operation resulted in her death from blood loss during the night of 28 August.

==Early life: 1902–1925==

Mafalda Maria Elisabetta Anna Romana was born on 19 November 1902 in Rome, and was nicknamed &quot;Muti&quot;. She was the second child born to King Victor Emmanuel III and Queen Elena of Italy. She was baptized at the Quirinal Palace on 15 December 1902. She had four siblings: Yolanda, Umberto, Giovanna, and Maria Francesca.

During her childhood, she was closest to her mother, from whom she inherited a love for music and the arts. During World War I, she accompanied her mother on her visits to Italian military hospitals. In 1919, she accompanied her mother, her sister Yolanda, and the Duchess of Aosta to Paris, France, where the Prince of Wales was also there.

== Marriage: 1925–1943 ==
On 23 September 1925, at Racconigi Castle, in the presence of the whole royal family, Mafalda married Prince Philipp of Hesse, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel and grandson of German Emperor Frederick III, whom she met at a garden party earlier in 1925. Prince Philipp and his brother Christoph were members of the Nazi Party and Mafalda adopted German citizenship.

Prince Philipp&#x27;s marriage to Princess Mafalda put him in position to act as intermediary between the National Socialist government in Germany (ruling since 1933) and the Fascist government in Italy, ruling since 1922. On the evening of 26 March 1935 she was present at an informal diplomatic dinner given by Adolf Hitler in the Reich President&#x27;s House in Berlin. She sat next to Anthony Eden. The couple were also frequent guests at Hermann Göring&#x27;s country residence and had links to many important people in Italian society, including royals, politicians and the papacy.

However, during World War II, Adolf Hitler believed Princess Mafalda was working against the war effort; he called her the &quot;blackest carrion in the Italian royal house&quot;. So did Hitler&#x27;s Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels, who called her &quot;the biggest bitch &quot;(grösste Rabenaas)&quot; in the entire Italian royal house&quot;.

== Imprisonment and death: 1943–1944 ==
The relationship between Prince Philipp and Hitler was beginning to sour by the spring of 1943. Although he initially worked for Hitler, Prince Philipp tried to resign, but he was prevented. He, reportedly, provided passports for Jews to allow them to flee to the Netherlands.

Early in September 1943, Princess Mafalda travelled to Bulgaria to attend the funeral of her brother-in-law, King Boris III. While there, she was informed of Italy&#x27;s surrender to the Allied Powers, that her husband was being held under house arrest in Bavaria, and that her children had been given sanctuary in the Vatican. The Gestapo ordered her arrest, and on 23 September she received a telephone call from &quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; Karl Hass at the German High Command, who told her that he had an important message from her husband. On her arrival at the German embassy, Mafalda was arrested, ostensibly for subversive activities. Princess Mafalda was transported to Munich for questioning, then to Berlin, and finally to Buchenwald concentration camp. The Italian prisoners at the Buchenwald concentration camp recognized her, and stated that she shared her food with other prisoners.

On 24 August 1944, the Allies bombed an ammunition factory inside Buchenwald. Some four hundred prisoners were killed and Princess Mafalda was seriously wounded: she had been housed in a unit adjacent to the bombed factory, and when the attack occurred she was buried up to her neck in debris and suffered severe burns to her left arm. She said, &quot;I’m dying. Remember me not as a princess but as your Italian sister.&quot;

The conditions of the labour camp caused her arm to become infected as a result, and the medical staff at the facility amputated it; she bled profusely during the operation and never regained consciousness. She died during the night of 26–27 August 1944; her body was reburied after the war at Kronberg Castle in Hesse.

Eugen Kogon, author of &quot;The Theory and Practice of Hell – The German Concentration Camps and the System Behind Them&quot; (1950), adds more details of Mafalda&#x27;s death – some of it in conflict with the previous account. After the air raid of 24 August 1944, the princess was wounded in the arm and Dr. Schiedlausky, camp medical office, performed the arm amputation, but his patient did not survive due to loss of blood. Her naked body was dumped into the crematorium, where Father Joseph Thyl dug it out of the body heap, covered her up, and arranged for speedy cremation. Thyl cut off a lock of the princess&#x27;s hair, which was smuggled out of camp to be kept in Jena, until it could be sent on to her German relatives. Her death was not confirmed until after Germany&#x27;s surrender to the Allies in 1945.

== Legacy ==
In 1995, the Italian government honored Princess Mafalda with her image on a postal stamp.

&quot;Mafaldine&quot; (&quot;little Mafalda&quot;), a variety of flat durum wheat pasta, are named after her.

==Children==

Princess Mafalda married Philipp, Landgrave of Hesse, on 23 September 1925 (civilly and religiously) at Racconigi Castle near Turin. They had 4 children:
#Moritz Friedrich Karl Emanuel Humbert (6 August 1926 – 23 May 2013); married on 1 June 1964 (civilly) and on 3 June 1964 (religiously) in Kronberg to Princess Tatiana of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg (born 31 July 1940), with issue (div. 16 October 1974).

# Otto Adolf (3 June 1937 – 3 January 1998); married first on 5 April 1965 (civilly) in Munich and on 6 April 1965 (religiously) in Trostberg to Angela Mathilde Agathe von Doering (12 August 1940 Goslar – 11 April 1991 Hanover), daughter of general Bernd von Doering, without issue (div. 3 February 1969). Married secondly on 28 December 1988 to Elisabeth Marga Dorothea Bönker (31 Jan 1944 Rumburg, Czechoslovakia – 12 April 2013), without issue (div. 1994).
# Elisabeth Margarethe Elena Johanna Maria Jolanda Polyxene (born 8 October 1940); married on 26 February 1962 (civilly) and on 28 February 1962 (religiously) in Frankfurt am Main to Count Friedrich Karl von Oppersdorf (30 January 1925 Głogówek – 11 January 1985 Gravenbruch), with issue.

<text>Middle French () is a historical division of the French language that covers the period from the mid-14th to the early 17th centuries. It is a period of transition during which:
* the French language became clearly distinguished from the other competing Oïl languages, which are sometimes subsumed within the concept of Old French ()
* the French language was imposed as the official language of the Kingdom of France in place of Latin and other Oïl and Occitan languages
* the literary development of French prepared the vocabulary and grammar for the Classical French () spoken in the 17th and 18th centuries.
It is the first version of French that is largely intelligible to Modern French, contrary to Old French.

==History==
The most important change found in Middle French is the complete disappearance of the noun declension system, which had been underway for centuries. There was no longer a distinction between nominative and oblique forms of nouns, and plurals became indicated by simply an &quot;s&quot;. The transformations necessitated an increased reliance on word order in the sentence, which becomes more or less the syntax of Modern but with a continued reliance on the verb in the second position of a sentence, or &quot;verb-second structure&quot;, until the 16th century.

Among the elites, Latin was still the language of education, administration, and bureaucracy. That changed in 1539, with the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts, in which Francis I made French the sole language for legal acts. Regional differences were still extreme throughout the Kingdom of France: in the south of France, Occitan languages dominated; in east-central France, Franco-Provençal languages were predominant; and in the north of France, Oïl languages other than Francien continued to be spoken.

The fascination with classical texts led to numerous borrowings from Latin and Greek. Numerous neologisms based on Latin roots were introduced, and some scholars modified the spelling of French words to bring them into conformity with their Latin roots, sometimes erroneously. That often produced a radical difference between a word&#x27;s spelling and pronunciation. Nevertheless, Middle French spelling was overall fairly close to the pronunciation; unlike Modern French, word-final consonants were still pronounced though they were optionally lost when they preceded another consonant that started the next word.

Between the 1490s and the 1550s, the French wars in Italy and the presence of Italians in the French court brought the French into contact with Italian humanism. Many words dealing with the military (, , , , , , ) and artistic (especially architectural: , , , ; also literary: ) practices were borrowed from Italian. Those tendencies would continue through Classical French.

There were also some borrowings from Spanish () and German () and from the Americas (, , ).

The influence of the Anglo-Norman language on English had left words of French and Norman origin in England. Some words of Romance origin now found their way back into French as doublets through war and trade.

Also, the meaning and usage of many words from Old French transformed.

Spelling and punctuation were extremely variable. The introduction of printing in 1470 highlighted the need for reform in spelling. One proposed reform came from Jacques Peletier du Mans, who developed a phonetic spelling system and introduced new typographic signs (1550), but his attempt at spelling reform was not followed.

The period saw the publication of the first French grammars and of the French-Latin dictionary of Robert Estienne (1539).

At the beginning of the 17th century, French would see the continued unification of French, the suppression of certain forms, and the prescription of rules, leading to Classical French.

==Phonological history==
==Literature==
Middle French is the language found in the writings of Charles, Duke of Orléans, François Villon, Clément Marot, François Rabelais, Michel de Montaigne, Pierre de Ronsard, and the poets of .

The affirmation and glorification of French finds its greatest manifestation in (&quot;The Defense and Illustration of the French Language&quot;) (1549) by the poet Joachim du Bellay, which maintained that French, like the Tuscan of Petrarch and Dante Alighieri, was a worthy language for literary expression and promulgated a program of linguistic production and purification, including the imitation of Latin genres.

<doc id="694168" wikidata="Q621277" url="?curid=694168" title="Apple Lossless Audio Codec">
<text>The Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC, ), also known as Apple Lossless, or Apple Lossless Encoder (ALE), is an audio coding format, and its reference audio codec implementation, developed by Apple for lossless data compression of digital music. After initially keeping it proprietary from its inception in 2004, in late 2011 Apple made the codec available open source and royalty-free. Traditionally, Apple has referred to the codec as &quot;Apple Lossless&quot;, though more recently it has begun to use the abbreviated term &quot;ALAC&quot; when referring to the codec.

==Codec==
ALAC supports up to 8 channels of audio at 16, 20, 24 and 32 bit depth with a maximum sample rate of 384 kHz.

ALAC data is frequently stored within an MP4 container with the filename extension &quot;.m4a&quot;. This extension is also used by Apple for lossy AAC audio data in an MP4 container (same container, different audio encoding). The codec can also be used by the .CAF file type container, though this is much less common.

ALAC is not a variant of AAC (which is a lossy format), but rather an unrelated lossless format that uses linear prediction (similar to other lossless codecs).

ALAC also does not use any DRM scheme; but by the nature of the MP4 container, it is feasible that DRM could be applied to ALAC much in the same way it is applied to files in other QuickTime containers.

According to Apple, audio files compressed with its lossless codec will use up &quot;about half the storage space&quot; that the uncompressed data would require. Testers using a selection of music have found that compressed files are about 40% to 60% the size of the originals depending on the kind of music, which is similar to other lossless formats.

ALAC has been measured to require around four times as much CPU power to decode than FLAC does, with implications for battery life on limited-power devices. Still, the format has been recommended for older iPod devices based on claims of lower power usage.

Partly because of the use of an MP4 container, ALAC does not contain integrated error checking.

==History==
The data compression software for encoding into ALAC files, Apple Lossless Encoder, was introduced into the Mac OS X Core Audio framework on April 28, 2004, together with the QuickTime 6.5.1 update, thus making it available in iTunes since version 4.5 and above, and its replacement, the Music application. The codec is also used in the AirPort and AirPlay implementation.

David Hammerton and Serafina Brocious analyzed and reverse engineered the codec without any documents on the format. On March 5, 2005, Hammerton published a simple open source decoder written in the C programming language on the basis of the work.

The Apple Lossless Encoder (and decoder) were released as open source software under the Apache License version 2.0 on October 27, 2011.

On May 17, 2021, Apple announced that they would begin offering lossless audio in Apple Music in June 2021, with all lossless music being encoded using ALAC.

==Software==
All current iOS devices can play ALAC encoded files.

The open source library libavcodec incorporates both a decoder and an encoder for the ALAC format, which means that media players based on that library (including VLC media player and MPlayer, as well as many media center applications for home theater computers, such as Plex, Kodi, and Boxee) are able to play ALAC files.

As of 2015, Windows 10 includes support for ALAC encoding and decoding, thereby enabling other media players to use it, e.g. Windows Media Player when ripping CDs or the Spotify desktop client for playback of local .m4a files.

The library was subsequently optimized for ARM processors and included in Rockbox.

Foobar2000 will play ALAC files as will JRiver Media Center and BitPerfect.

Lossless music via ALAC was added to Apple Music in June 2021, at no additional cost for all subscribers. The maximum fidelity for lossless music on Apple Music is 24-bit at 192 kHz.

<doc id="694171" wikidata="Q2197252" url="?curid=694171" title="Common Cause">
<text>Common Cause is a watchdog group based in Washington, D.C., with chapters in 35 states. It was founded in 1970 by John W. Gardner, a Republican, who was the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare in the administration of President Lyndon Johnson as well as chair of the National Urban Coalition, an advocacy group for minorities and the working poor in urban areas. In its early days, Common Cause focused its efforts on ending the Vietnam War and lowering the voting age from 21 to 18.

Sometimes identified as liberal-leaning, Common Cause has also been identified as nonpartisan and advocates government reform. It is identified with the reformist &quot;good government&quot; movement and is often described as a watchdog group. The organization&#x27;s tagline is &quot;holding power accountable&quot; and its stated mission is &quot;upholding the core values of American democracy. We work to create open, honest, and accountable government that serves the public interest; promote equal rights, opportunity, and representation for all; and empower all people to make their voices heard in the political process.&quot;

==Issue areas==
The organization&#x27;s stated issue areas are &quot;money in politics&quot;, &quot;voting and elections&quot;, &quot;ethics&quot;, &quot;a fair economy&quot;, and &quot;media and democracy&quot;.

===Constitutional conventions===
Common Cause opposes and actively lobbies against modern-day efforts to call an Article V convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution by both progressive and conservative groups, such as that by the progressive political action committee Wolf PAC to limit large monetary donations to political candidates parties and groups, and by the conservative advocacy group Citizens for Self-Governance&#x27;s &quot;Convention of the States&quot; initiative, which is backed by some Republican politicians. 

In a May 2016 report entitled &quot;The Dangerous Path: Big Money&#x27;s Plan to Shred the Constitution&quot;, Common Cause wrote that &quot;There is nothing to prevent the convention, once convened, from proposing additional changes that could limit or eliminate fundamental rights or upend our entire system of government.&quot; While a constitutional convention could conceivably overturn the controversial Supreme Court decision in &quot;Citizens United v. FEC&quot; and limit the role of money in politics (as advocated by groups such as Wolf PAC), Common Cause suggests that the risk of a runaway convention is too great because &quot;state legislatures, the majority of which are controlled by Republicans, would likely control the agenda at a constitutional convention&quot; and as a result it is extremely unlikely &quot;that a convention controlled by those legislatures would really do anything productive on money in politics, on voting rights, on democracy in general&quot;. Any amendments would need to be ratified by three-quarters of the states.

===Ethics===
Common Cause lobbied Congress to pass the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, requiring government officials to disclose their finances and restricting the &quot;revolving door&quot; between government and business. In 1989, they lobbied for passage of a new Ethics in Government Act, which ended special-interest honoraria for members of Congress and closed a loophole that allowed members to convert campaign funds to personal use.

The organization&#x27;s efforts led to ethics probes and the resignations of House Speakers Jim Wright in 1988 and Newt Gingrich in 1995.

During the 2016 presidential elections, Common Cause suggested that the Clinton Foundation would create ethics and conflict of interest challenges for Hillary Clinton should she become president. They criticized Hillary Clinton&#x27;s plan to give Chelsea Clinton control of the foundation and called for an independent audit and full disclosure of the foundation&#x27;s donors.

The public interest group also criticized Donald Trump for his refusal to release his tax returns during the 2016 presidential election. The organization has been outspoken about the potential conflicts of interest from Trump&#x27;s businesses and called for Trump to put his assets into a blind trust instead of handing over control of his businesses to his children.

===Money in politics===
In 1972, Common Cause sued President Richard Nixon&#x27;s re-election campaign, the Committee for the Re-Election of the President, under the Federal Corrupt Practices Act in an attempt to force Nixon&#x27;s campaign to report early campaign contributions. The lawsuit forced the disclosure of the names of several Nixon donors. In 1974, Common Cause supported passage of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), encompassing public financing of presidential campaigns and oversight of campaign ethics through the Federal Election Commission.

==== Publicly-financed elections ====
Common Cause has advocated public financing of elections in order to decrease the influence of special-interest contributions. The group&#x27;s most successful campaign finance reform efforts have been in New York City in 1999; Connecticut in 2005; Montgomery County, Maryland in 2014; Portland, Oregon in 2016; Howard County, Maryland in 2017; Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland in 2018; and California.

===Voting and elections===

==== Redistricting ====
The organization has sought to end the practice of gerrymandering in several states. In 2016, it filed a lawsuit in North Carolina challenging the constitutionality of district maps. The organization&#x27;s North Carolina chapter has led a campaign to create a nonpartisan redistricting process, which has bipartisan support in the state. Common Cause is also challenging redistricting in Democratic-controlled states, such as Maryland.

==== Voting machines ====
Common Cause advocates a voter-verified paper audit trail for election machines in all states. The organization has documented complaints about electronic voting machines.

==== National popular vote ====
Common Cause is in favor of establishing a national popular vote for presidential elections to replace the current electoral college system. Following the November 2016 U.S. presidential election, Common Cause called for the National Popular Vote Compact to counteract what it called the &quot;anti-democratic&quot; outcome in that election.

<doc id="694180" wikidata="Q7147745" url="?curid=694180" title="Patrick Tonyn">
<text>Major-General Patrick Tonyn (1725 – 30 December 1804) was a British Army officer and colonial administrator who served as the governor of East Florida from 1774 to 1784. His governorship lasted the span of the American Revolutionary War, with East Florida being a Loyalist stronghold during the conflict.

== Early life ==
Patrick Tonyn was born in Berwick-upon-Tweed in Northumberland in 1725, into a military family. His father, Charles Tonyn, was a Colonel in the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons. Patrick Tonyn became a captain in the 6th 6th Dragoons in 1751, and served with that regiment in Germany during the Seven Years&#x27; War. In 1759 the regiment fought at Minden and Wetter with great distinction. Tonyn was made lieutenant-colonel of the 104th Regiment of Foot in 1761.

== Life in Florida and Revolution ==
Tonyn is generally described as a capable commander. During his tenure as governor of East Florida the colony enjoyed peace with the neighboring Indians, primarily due to his positive relationship with Ahaya the Cowkeeper, chief of the Alachua band of the Seminole tribe.

Like most favored British officers, Tonyn received a large grant in the new colony—a tract in 1767. This area of land was just south of Black Creek. Nautralist William Bartram, during his 1774 travels, noted that Tonyn&#x27;s land grew indigo well. Bartram counted twenty enslaved workers when passing by the plantation. After a 1776 raid from Georgia, Tonyn was forced to give up this land for a plot east of the St. Johns River.

Fort Tonyn, which was located in present-day Nassau County, Florida, near the hamlet of Mills&#x27;s Ferry was named after Tonyn.

On 1 March 1774, Tonyn arrived in St. Augustine, Florida as royal governor of East Florida. Throughout Tonyn&#x27;s governorship, Loyalists from southern colonies sought refuge in St. Augustine. Another group was added to the population of the city when Andrew Turnbull&#x27;s colony of New Smyrna to the south collapsed. Tonyn released the group (composed largely of Minorcans) from their indentures, and they too settled in St. Augustine in 1777.

During the American Revolution, Tonyn raised four black militia units in East Florida. Those who served were promised freedom. However, due to the efforts of slave owners and the passing of stricter slave codes, few of those who fought were granted their freedom.

From 1778 – 1785, Governor Tonyn lived in the coquina dwelling at 143 St. George Street in St. Augustine, in what is known today as the Peña-Peck House, run by the Woman&#x27;s Exchange of St. Augustine.

Tonyn was instrumental in bringing his brother-in-law planter Francis Levett, an Englishman, to East Florida, having Levett given a seat on the Royal Council. Formerly a merchant in Leghorn, Italy, working for the Levant Company in Constantinople and scion of a well-connected English merchant family, Levett took up a large grant in Florida, which he later abandoned in favor of Georgia, where he was one of the first growers of Sea Island cotton. Levett&#x27;s son-in-law Dr. David Yeats served as Secretary of the province of Florida under Governor Tonyn.

== London and death ==
Tonyn was the victim in a fraud and deception trial at the Old Bailey in May 1796. Henry Weston was indicted for forging Tonyn&#x27;s signature to transfer of £5,000. The Old Bailey records show that Weston, a young man with gambling debts, was sentenced to death.

Patrick Tonyn died in London on 30 December 1804.

<doc id="694190" wikidata="Q2734841" url="?curid=694190" title="Maltby, South Yorkshire">
<text>Maltby is a former mining town and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England. It was historically in the West Riding of Yorkshire. It is located east of Rotherham and north-east of Sheffield. It forms a continuous urban area with Hellaby, separated from the rest of Rotherham by the M18 motorway. It had a population of 16,688 at the 2011 Census.

==History==
The place-name &#x27;Maltby&#x27; is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as &quot;Maltebi&quot;. The name means &#x27;Malti&#x27;s homestead or village&#x27;. &quot;Malti&quot; was a common Old Danish name.

Maltby was for centuries a small village near a stream based around farming. Roche Abbey, on the outskirts of Maltby, was founded in 1147 by Cistercian Monks from Newminster Abbey (near Morpeth, Northumberland), and was suppressed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the reign of Henry VIII.

Coal was discovered in the area in the late 19th century; the last colliery in Rotherham was Maltby Main Colliery, established 1910 and faced with closure in March 2013. To house the colliery&#x27;s workers, the colliery company built a large estate known as the &#x27;Model Village&#x27; to the east of the town centre.

From 1900 until 1929, the town was served by Maltby railway station on the South Yorkshire Joint Railway, with services running between Doncaster and Worksop. The station&#x27;s platforms still remain and the line is an important freight route. John Brown&#x27;s Private Railway also ran by the west of Maltby, but the track has been lifted and is now a public footpath; a short stretch of track and a platform remains.

During the Second World War, a munitions factory, ROF Maltby, was established on the outskirts of Maltby close to the colliery; an estate nicknamed &#x27;Little London&#x27; was built to house its workers, who had moved from Enfield in London.

Maltby also had a knitwear factory, Byfords, which supplied companies including Pringle – but this closed in 1999, and a police station was built on the site.

Maltby&#x27;s main council housing stock went into serious disrepair during the 1980s with areas like &quot;White City&quot; and the &quot;Tarran estate&quot; (now demolished) worst affected. Maltby local government funding in 1997, council estates such as White City and Birk&#x27;s Holt Drive have been redevelopment. Derelict land and a former club building was demolished and the land redeveloped during the 1990s by John &amp; Jeanne Jebson and Richard &amp; Jen Schofield who developed two private dwellings on Meadow Lane and developed individual building plots and named Foxcroft Meadows – an area of seven new builds. New council housing was opened in 2011 on the site of the former Tarran estate.
==Governance==
Until 1974, Maltby had an urban district council, and was part of the West Riding of Yorkshire. Following the Local Government Act 1972, Maltby is now governed by Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council, part of the metropolitan county of South Yorkshire, and also has a parish council, Maltby Town Council. Maltby Town Council has a majority of independents but has Labour representatives for the Rotherham Borough Council. The political makeup of Maltby Town Council is below:

The town lies in the South Yorkshire constituency of Rother Valley, currently held by Labour MP Jake Richards.

Maltby has many distinct areas.

*Maltby town centre
*Model Village (south west of the town centre)
*Cliff Hills (to the west of the town centre)
*White City (to the southeast of the town centre)
*Little London (to the north of the town centre)
*Birks Holt estate
*New estate
*Highfield Park

==Amenities==

Before coal was discovered in the area, Maltby was a small agricultural village, centred on the Parish Church of St Bartholomew&#x27;s (ref Domesday Book / Saxon Tower), with a population of around 500 at the start of the 1900s. With the opening of the mine in 1907 miners came from all parts of the UK – Wales, Staffordshire, Durham, Scotland and Ireland (the latter descendants of the canal (navvies) and railway building). The miner&#x27;s Model Village was built with its centre piece as the Church of the Ascension, an annexe to the Parish Church, and in addition a significant presence of Methodist, Congregational, Salvation Army and Roman Catholic places of worship developed. The new community spawned several working men&#x27;s clubs, including the &#x27;Stute&#x27; (short for the Miner&#x27;s Welfare Institute), the &#x27;Slip&#x27;, the ROF Club (Royal Ordnance Factory) and Catholic Club. The most significant sports clubs were the Miner&#x27;s Institute (&#x27;Maltby Main&#x27; – football and cricket) and Roche Abbey Cricket Club, where Freddy Trueman commenced his illustrious career.

At its peak, Maltby had a population of 18,158 in 1991, but following deindustrialisation in the 1980s/90s, this figure has dropped by roughly 10%, standing at 16,688 in 2011.

The town is served by a variety of shops and businesses. There are multiple public houses in the town, the oldest of which is the White Swan which dates from the 16th century. In 2015, the White Swan closed, and the building is now an Indian restaurant.

Despite the rebuilding/refurbishment of some housing stock at the beginning of the 21st century, the ward of Maltby, particularly the eastern area, (in 2010) included areas of high deprivation, according to data generated by the Department for Communities and Local Government.

==Education==
Maltby Academy on &quot;Braithwell Road&quot; (B6376) is a secondary school which serves the town and some surrounding villages. It was previously known as Maltby Comprehensive School until receiving academy status in 2010. Permission was granted in 2012 to rebuild the school, to the opposition of some residents.

Initially however, the &#x27;campus&#x27; comprised Maltby Grammar School and Maltby Hall Secondary Modern School built on the site of Rolleston Hall. The Grammar School was built in 1931 through the enterprise of County Alderman Dunn, a miner and Labour Councillor, and survived through to the 1970s, guided throughout by the Headmaster, Gerald Rush, pupils being drawn from the adjacent mining towns of Dinnington, Thurcroft, Edlington and Rossington, plus Wickersley, Bramley, Laughton, Tickhill, Bawtry and smaller villages of Braithwell, Micklebring, Anston, Austerfield and other smaller settlements. The Grammar School period architecture survives today with its imposing front and iconic clock set high above Rotherham Road.

==Media==

Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Emley Moor TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Sheffield, Heart Yorkshire, Capital Yorkshire, Hits Radio South Yorkshire, Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire, and Rotherham Radio, a community based station.

The &quot;Rotherham Advertiser&quot; is the town’s local newspaper.

==Sport==
The ancient game of &quot;beck ball&quot; was revived in the mid-1980s to some success; this is a sort of rugby game, where opposing teams generally fight a turf war in the local stream, Maltby Dike – or Beck as locally known. This stream runs through the valley past St Bartholomew&#x27;s, thence past Maltby Crags, through the Norwoods, through the centre of Roche Abbey, emptying into the River Ryton at Blyth a few miles downstream. Below Maltby, the stream has also been referred to as the &#x27;Comwell&#x27;. Near to Roche Abbey is Sandbeck Hall, the home of the Earl of Scarborough.

Maltby&#x27;s local football team is Maltby Main F.C., which was established in 1916 and plays at Muglet Lane. In 2024, the band Bring Me the Horizon, whose drummer Matt Nicholls is from Maltby, designed and sponsored a new kit for the team.

==Transport==

The town is served by high frequency (every 10 mins during the day) buses: the X1 SteelLink service to Sheffield runs via Rotherham town centre and the Meadowhall Shopping Centre. In addition, there is also service X2, which runs through Maltby every 30 minutes in the daytime from Rotherham to Maltby via Flanderwell, Sunnyside, Bramley and also to Doncaster via Braithwell and Balby every hour; these are all run by First South Yorkshire.

Maltby is situated close to junction 1 of the M18 motorway, allowing quick access by car for commuters to Sheffield and Doncaster, and the A631 road runs through the town, linking it with the centre of Rotherham.

==Maltby Colliery==
Sinking of the original shafts of Maltby Colliery began in 1907, as part of the development a large estate known as the &quot;Model Village&quot; was constructed as housing for the colliery workers.

An explosion in the colliery occurred in 1923, resulting in 27 deaths.
Maltby Main pit was the site of mass picketing during the &#x27;80&#x27;s miners&#x27; strike, which lasted almost exactly a year from March 1984 to March 1985, and the pit was the last to return to work when the strike ended.
Post nationalisation the pit was sold to RJB Mining (later known as UK Coal) in 1994, and later to Hargreaves Services in 2007.

After encountering geological problems when trying to access a new coal seam, colliery owner Hargreaves announced that on health and safety grounds the mine would have to close. Maltby Colliery closed in March 2013, with a march held by former miners and residents of the town to mark the occasion.

The Miners&#x27; Welfare Institute (locally known as the &quot;Stute&quot;), a working men&#x27;s club for miners, closed in 2018. There was a long-running campaign to reopen the Stute, until it was damaged by a large fire in April 2021, forcing the pub to close permanently.

<doc id="694203" wikidata="Q335615" url="?curid=694203" title="Michael Bowes-Lyon, 18th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne">
<text>Michael Fergus Bowes-Lyon, 18th and 5th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, (7 June 1957 – 27 February 2016), styled Lord Glamis between 1972 and 1987, also known as Mikey Strathmore, was a British Conservative politician, Scots Guards officer and stockbroker. He was a first cousin once removed of Queen Elizabeth II.

==Early life and education==
Strathmore was born on 7 June 1957 in Windsor, the only son of Fergus Bowes-Lyon, later 17th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, and his wife, Mary Pamela McCorquodale (born 1932). His paternal grandfather, Lieutenant-Colonel The Honourable Michael Claude Hamilton Bowes-Lyon (1893–1957), was an elder brother of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, thus making Michael a first cousin once removed of Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Margaret. He served as the Queen Mother&#x27;s page of honour from 1971 to 1973 and often stayed with her at the Castle of Mey and the Royal Lodge, Windsor. He was raised in Humbie, East Lothian, with his two sisters, Elizabeth and Diana.

He was educated at Sunningdale School and Eton College before reading Land Economy at the University of Aberdeen. He attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.

==Career==
After Sandhurst, Strathmore was commissioned in the Scots Guards in 1980. He held the rank of lieutenant and was later promoted to captain in 1984. He served in Northern Ireland and Hong Kong.

He left the army in 1984, going to work in the City of London for the stock brokerage firm Strauss Turnbull. In 1987, Strathmore succeeded his father as 18th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne and inherited Holwick Hall in Teesdale, County Durham, and Glamis Castle, the Queen Mother&#x27;s girlhood home, in Angus.

He took his seat in the House of Lords. He served as a lord-in-waiting from 1989 to 1992 and served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard and Deputy Chief Whip of the House of Lords in the First Major ministry. His achievements included the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty by the Lords. He retired in 1994 and subsequently lost his seat in November 1999 with the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999. After resigning his ministerial post, Strathmore sat on the board of Polypipe from 1994 until it was acquired by IMI plc in 1999. He was a member of White&#x27;s and Pratt&#x27;s.

He was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Angus on 19 April 1993. He also served as president of Boys&#x27; Brigade from 1994 to 1999 and as patron of the Friends of the Bowes Museum in County Durham, a position he inherited from the Queen Mother.

==Personal life==
Strathmore was married thrice. On 14 November 1984, Lord Glamis, as he was then, married Isobel Charlotte Weatherall (born ), great-granddaughter of Henry Keswick and sister of Percy Weatherall, at St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly, with the Queen Mother in attendance. Strathmore and Weatherall were separated in 2003 and divorced in 2005. They had three sons:
* Simon Patrick Bowes-Lyon, 19th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne (born 1986)
* &quot;The Honourable&quot; John Fergus Bowes-Lyon (born 1988)
* &quot;The Honourable&quot; George Norman Bowes-Lyon (born 1991)

On 24 November 2005, Strathmore married Damaris Stuart-William, a clinical psychologist. They were separated in 2007 and divorced in 2008. They had one son:
* &quot;The Honourable&quot; Toby Peter Fergus Bowes-Lyon (born 2005)

On 4 August 2012, Strathmore married Karen Baxter (&quot;née&quot; Orrock), who survived him.

As a hobby, he restored old automobiles and lorries, often featuring in the Strathmore Vintage Vehicle Rally. In 2002, as the head of the Bowes-Lyon family, he walked behind the Queen Mother&#x27;s coffin during her funeral procession and attended the private service of committal in the King George VI Memorial Chapel.

Strathmore died of colorectal cancer on 27 February 2016 in London, aged 58. A memorial service was held at the Church of St Mary the Virgin in Middleton-in-Teesdale, near his County Durham properties, on 12 May and another, attended by Prince Charles, was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields in London on 8 June.

<doc id="694210" wikidata="Q270375" url="?curid=694210" title="Ko Samui">
<text>Ko Samui (or Koh Samui), often locally shortened to Samui (, ), is an island off the east coast of Thailand. Geographically in the Chumphon Archipelago, it is part of Surat Thani Province, though as of 2012, Ko Samui was granted municipal status and thus is now locally self-governing. Ko Samui, with an area of , is Thailand&#x27;s second largest island after Phuket. In 2018, it was visited by 2.7 million tourists.

==History==
The island was probably first inhabited about 15 centuries ago, settled by fishermen from the Malay Peninsula and southern China. It appears on Chinese maps dating back to 1687, under the name &quot;Pulo Cornam&quot;.

The origin of the name &quot;samui&quot; is unknown. It may come from the Sanskrit-Tamil word สมวย, meaning &#x27;sea weather&#x27;. Or it may derive from the name of a tree known locally in southern Thailand as ต้นหมุย (full name ต้นสมุย). A third possibility is that it originated from early Hainanese traders to Samui. In Hainanese Chinese, เซ่าบ่วย means &#x27;first island&#x27;, &#x27;barrier&#x27;, or &#x27;gate&#x27;, or literally &#x27;beautiful beach&#x27;. As it was their first port of call in Thailand, it became its name and evolved to สมุย. Some people believe that the word &quot;samui&quot; derives from the Malay word &quot;saboey&quot;, or &#x27;safe haven&#x27;. There is no firm corroboration of any of these theories. &quot;Ko&quot; เกาะ is the Thai word for &quot;island&quot;.

Until the late 20th century, Ko Samui was an isolated self-sufficient community, having little connection with the mainland of Thailand. The island was without roads until the early 1970s and the journey from one side of the island to the other could involve a whole-day trek through the mountainous central jungles.

Ko Samui&#x27;s economy now is based primarily on a successful tourist industry, as well as exports of coconut and rubber.

Economic growth has brought not only prosperity but also major changes to the island&#x27;s environment and culture.

===Governance===
The first local government on Samui island was established in 1956 with the sanitary district Ko Samui, which however only covered the area around the settlement. In 1963 it was enlarged to cover the entirety of Samui and Pha-Nga islands, which at that time were still in the same district. In 1973, the area of the Ko Pha-Ngan District became a separate sanitary district. Since 1981, the sanitary district covers the area of the whole district.

Like all sanitary districts, Ko Samui became a subdistrict municipality (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;) in 1999.
In 2008, the subdistrict municipality was upgraded to a town municipality (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;),
and in 2012, the town was upgraded to a city municipality.

The conversion of the municipality into a special administrative area with greater powers of self-governance similar to Pattaya has been discussed since 2008, but as of 2018, no action has been taken.

==Geography==

Ko Samui is in the Gulf of Thailand, about northeast of Surat Thani town (9°N, 100°E). It is the largest island in the Chumphon Archipelago, measuring about at its widest point. To the north are the populated resort islands of Ko Pha-ngan, Ko Tao, and Ko Nang Yuan. Close to Bangrak in northeast Samui is the small uninhabited island of Ko Som, and to the northeast of Chaweng is the tiny Ko Matlang. To the south are Ko Taen and Ko Matsum, each of which have small tourist facilities. To the far west are 44 other islands which together compose Mu Ko Ang Thong National Park which is accessible by a day-trip boat tour from Ko Samui.

The central part of Ko Samui is mostly tropical jungle with tree coverage and wildlife and its largest mountain, Khao Pom, peaking at . The lowland and coastal areas are connected by a -long road, encircling the island. Other concrete roads branch off to service other areas.

The town of Nathon on the west coast is the closest town to the mainland and is the original capital which still houses many government offices. Two of the island&#x27;s five main piers make Nathon the main port for all transportation from the mainland and the commercial centre for Samui residents. The transition from dependence on the local coconut industry and the continued growth and development of the tourist industry, as well as the northeastern location of the airport, has led to the increase of commercial activity in Chaweng and Bophut.

==Climate==
Ko Samui has a tropical monsoon climate according to the Köppen climate classification, based on an analysis of 1971–2010 Thai Meteorological Department data. The climate is warm and humid for most of the year. In comparison to Phuket and most of the rest of southern Thailand, Samui&#x27;s weather is relatively drier (Samui receives about rain per year, and Phuket gets ). Phuket&#x27;s wet season is spread over six to eight months. Ko Samui has only two months with more than of rain. The heaviest precipitation typically falls in the time frame from mid October to early December. For the rest of the year, given the tropical climate, rain showers are brief; 20–60 minutes duration is typical.

==Administration==
Ko Samui is an amphoe (district) of Surat Thani Province, divided into seven sub-districts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 39 administrative villages (&quot;mubans&quot;). The entire island is one city municipality (&quot;thesaban nakhon&quot;). The district covers the island, as well as the Ang Thong archipelago and some other small islands nearby.

Originally, the district included all of the islands of Surat Thani Province. The islands Ko Pha-ngan and Ko Tao were split off as the minor district (&quot;king amphoe&quot;) Ko Pha-ngan effective 1 October 1970. In 1980, administrative village number seven of Ang Thong Sub-district covering the islands Ko Chueak, Ko Nok Phao, and Ko Rikan was reassigned to Don Sak District, where it now forms village number 11.

==Transport==
Samui Airport is a private airport built and owned by Bangkok Airways, which is the only airline with services to Ko Samui from mainland Thailand since the airport&#x27;s construction in 1989. Due to its use of locally produced palm leaves and a natural, open-air cooling system, the terminal complex received an Environment Impact Assessment Award under the guidance of Prasert Prasarttong-Osoth. Ko Samui airport is built in an open style, drawing connections between it and traditional Thai architecture. In 2009, the airport handled 1.3 million passengers and 17,707 aircraft operations. 
Flights from Samui to Phuket and other Thai destinations are available, and in 2012, the Thai government announced the possibility of a second Ko Samui airport due to complaints of high airport fees.

Several ferries connect the island with the mainland, including two car/passenger ferries, and connect Don Sak to piers in the west of the island, in Lipa Noi and in Nathon. Public buses to all parts of the mainland operate from a new bus station north of Nathon. Privately operated songthaews circle the ring road like a bus service with fixed fees mostly only in the daytime, and private taxis which charged a fixed, flat fee depending on the destination.

==Tourism==

Sociologist Erik Cohen noted that modern tourism to Ko Samui began to pick up pace in the late 1970s. The expansion of tourism on the island has resulted in growth of building resorts, bungalows, and luxury private villas on the island. The island&#x27;s total of 17,479 hotel rooms in 2013 was increased by an additional 459 new rooms in 2015. A gradual shift in demand is seeing more Asian visitors and families, but the top three source markets have been Germany, the UK, and Thailand, which contribute a combined 27 percent share. Bangkok Airways continues to modernize its fleet with new Airbuses, phasing out older ATR 72 propeller planes, which will provide 189,000 additional airline seats for Samui travelers. The airport has already increased the number of daily flights from 36 to 50.

The island received more than 2.5 million foreign visitors in 2017, up from 2.34 million in 2016. According to a luxury hotelier, tourists traveling to Ko Samui spend an average of 7,700 to 8,200 baht per head per day.

, legislators in the Thai parliament have put forward a proposal to build an bridge linking mainland Nakhon Si Thammarat Province with Ko Samui. The MPs claim that the project would spur economic growth in south Thailand. They propose that—if built—it be named &quot;Chan-o-cha&quot; in honour of Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha.

Ko Samui&#x27;s tourist appeal made it a plotline of the 2000 comedy movie &quot;Meet the Parents,&quot; starring Ben Stiller and Robert DeNiro.

=== Attraction sites ===
Samui has several tourist attraction sites ranging from beaches, waterfalls and is full of history. Some of the top attraction sites in this island include:

* Beaches– Koh Samui is home for some of the most beautiful beaches in Thailand. Among the famous beaches include Chaweng Beach, Lamai Beach, Maenam Beach and Choeng Mon Beach.
* Wat Phra Yai– Also called Big Buddha Temple, it is one of the most iconic landmarks in Koh Samui. It has the giant golden Buddha statue, seated in a lotus position which is 12 meters high and is a symbol of peace and prosperity.
* Hin Ta and Hin Yai Rocks– These are natural rock formations also known as Grandfather and Grandmother Rocks. They resemble male and female genitalia and are believed to bring fertility and good luck.
* Na Muang Waterfalls
* Fisherman&#x27;s Village
* Secret Buddha Garden
* Elephant Sanctuaries In the last years, Koh Samui developed several elephant sanctuaries in a big wild area. A place to increase learning, compatibility, and understanding between humans and elephants as sentient beings. All assist in elephant care by supporting sincere and beneficial ethical tourism.

==Environmental improvements==
Ko Samui hosts some 2,700,000 visitors per year. To manage this, every resort, hotel, villa, restaurant, and facility is required to maintain their own septic tank systems so there is no need for widespread wastewater treatment. Rainwater collection from roadway run-off along Samui&#x27;s main ring road has been vastly improved during the main Ring Road revitalization and improvement project begun in 2017 and nearly completed as of 2020. The project has widened the main ring roads all the way around the entire island, upgrading with new steel-reinforced concrete along with asphalt blacktop, new sidewalks, additional street-lights, and run-off water collection. Ko Samui has three main run-off water treatment plants, in Chaweng, Lamai, and Maenam, to handle the rainwater collection from the roads; since all sewage is handled by each property&#x27;s own required septic systems.

Other islands such as Koh Tao and Koh Phangan (famous for its full moon parties) have much more serious problems due to lack of good infrastructure and enforcement. Plans to build more water treatment plants on those other island has been stymied by lack of funding, making Koh Samui&#x27;s better infrastructure much more appealing.

==Medical care==
Samui has five private hospitals: Samui International Hospital; Wattanapat Hospital Samui; Thai International; Bandon Hospital; and Bangkok Hospital Samui. The government hospital is in Nathon.

<doc id="694222" wikidata="Q2627217" url="?curid=694222" title="Mach-O">
<text>Mach-O, short for Mach object file format, is a file format for executables, object code, shared libraries, dynamically loaded code, and core dumps. It was developed to replace the a.out format.

Mach-O is used by some systems based on the Mach kernel. NeXTSTEP, macOS, and iOS are examples of systems that use this format for native executables, libraries and object code.

== Mach-O file layout ==
Each Mach-O file is made up of one Mach-O header, followed by a series of load commands, followed by one or more segments, each of which contains between 0 and 255 sections. Mach-O uses the REL relocation format to handle references to symbols. When looking up symbols Mach-O uses a two-level namespace that encodes each symbol into an &#x27;object/symbol name&#x27; pair that is then linearly searched for, first by the object and then the symbol name.

The basic structure—a list of variable-length &quot;load commands&quot; that reference pages of data elsewhere in the file—was also used in the executable file format for Accent. The Accent file format was in turn, based on an idea from Spice Lisp.

All multi-byte values in all data structures are written in the byte order of the host for which the code was produced.

== Mach-O header ==

The magic number for 32-bit code is while the magic number for 64-bit architectures is .

The reserved value is only present in 64-bit Mach-O files. It is reserved for future use or extension of the 64-bit header.

The CPU type indicates the instruction set architecture for the code. If the file is for the 64-bit version of the instruction set architecture, the CPU type value has the bit set.

The CPU type values are as follows:

Each CPU type has a set of CPU subtype values, indicating a particular model of that CPU type for which the code is intended. Newer models of a CPU type may support instructions, or other features, not supported by older CPU models, so that code compiled or written for a newer model might contain instructions that are illegal instructions on an older model, causing that code to trap or otherwise fail to operate correctly when run on an older model. Code intended for an older model will run on newer models without problems.

If the CPU type is ARM then the subtypes are as follows:

If the CPU type is x86 then the subtypes are as follows:

After the subtype value is the file type value.

After the file type value is the number of load commands and the total number of bytes the load commands are after the Mach-O header, then a 32-bit flag with the following possible settings.

Multiple binary digits can be set to one in the flags to identify any information or settings that apply to the binary.

Now the load commands are read as we have reached the end of the Mach-O header.

== Multi-architecture binaries ==
Multiple Mach-O files can be combined in a multi-architecture binary. This allows a single binary file to contain code to support multiple instruction set architectures, for example for different generations and types of Apple devices, including different processor architectures such as ARM64 and x86-64.

All fields in the universal header are big-endian.

The universal header is in the following form:

The magic number in a multi-architecture binary is in big-endian byte order, so the first 4 bytes of the header will always be , in that order.

The number of binaries is the number of entries that follow the header.

The header is followed by a sequence of entries in the following form:

The sequence of entries is followed by a sequence of Mach-O images. Each entry refers to a Mach-O image.

The CPU type and subtype for an entry must be the same as the CPU type and subtype for the Mach-O image to which the entry refers.

The file offset and size are the offset in the file of the beginning of the Mach-O image, and the size of the Mach-O image, to which the entry refers.

The section alignment is the logarithm, base 2, of the byte alignment in the file required for the Mach-O image to which the entry refers; for example, a value of 14 means that the image must be aligned on a 214-byte boundary, i.e. a 16384-byte boundary. This is required by tools that modify the multi-architecture binary, in order for them to keep the image properly aligned.

== Load commands ==

The load commands are read immediately after the Mach-O header.

The Mach-O header tells us how many load commands exist after the Mach-O header and the size in bytes to where the load commands end. The size of load commands is used as a redundancy check.

When the last load command is read and the number of bytes for the load commands do not match, or if we go outside the number of bytes for load commands before reaching the last load command, then the file may be corrupted.

Each load command is a sequence of entries in the following form:

The load command type identifies what the parameters are in the load command. If a load command starts with bit set that means the load command is necessary in order to be able to load or run the binary. This allows older Mach-O loaders to skip commands not understood by the loader that are not mandatory for loading the application.

=== Segment load command ===
Mach-O binaries that use load command type use the 32-bit version of the segment load command, while is used to specify the 64-bit version of the segment load command.,

The segment load command varies if the Mach-O header is 32-bit, or 64-bit. This is because 64-bit processor architecture uses 64-bit addresses while 32-bit architectures use 32-bit addresses.

All virtual RAM addresses are added to a base address to keep applications spaced apart. Each section in a segment load command has a relocation list offset that specifies the offsets in the section that must be adjusted based on the application&#x27;s base address. The relocations are unnecessary if the application can be placed at its defined RAM address locations such as a base address of zero.
A segment name cannot be larger than 16 text characters in bytes. The unused characters are in value.

The segment command contains the address to write the section in virtual address space plus the application&#x27;s base address. The number of bytes to write to the address location (Address size).

After the address information is the file offset the segment data is located in the Mach-O binary, and the number of bytes to read from the file.

When the address size is larger than the number of bytes to read from the file, the rest of the bytes in RAM space are set .

There is a segment that is called __PAGEZERO, which has a file offset of zero and a size of zero in the file. It has a defined RAM address and size. Since it reads zero bytes from the file it fills the address location with zeros to where the binary is going to be placed in RAM. This segment is necessary to rid the section of any data from a prior application.

When a segment is initially placed in the virtual address space, it is given the CPU access permissions specified by the initial virtual memory protections value. The permissions on a region of the virtual address space may be changed by application or library code with calls to routines such as ; the maximum virtual memory protections limit what permissions may be granted for access to the segment.

Then after the CPU address protection settings is the number of sections that are within this segment that are read after the segments flag settings.

The segment flag settings are as follows:

The number of sections in the segment is a set of entries that are read as follows:

The section&#x27;s segment name must match the segments load command name. The sections entries locate to data in the segment. Each section locates to the relocation entries for adjusting addresses in the section if the application base address is added to anything other than zero.

The section size applies to both the size of the section at its address location and size in the file at its offset location.

The section Flag/Type value is read as follows:
Any of the settings that apply to the section have a binary digit set one. The last eight binary digits is the section type value.

The Mach-O loader records the symbol pointer sections and symbol stub sections. They are sequentially used by the indirect symbol table to load in method calls.

The size of each symbol stub is stored in reserved2 value. Each pointer is 32-bit address locations in 32-bit Mach-O and 64-bit address locations in 64-bit Mach-O. Once the section end is reached, we move to the next section while reading the indirect symbol table.

==== Segment number and section numbers ====

The segments and sections are located by segment number and section number in the compressed and uncompressed link edit information sections.

A segment value of 3 would mean the offset to the data of the fourth segment load command in the Mach-O file starting from zero up (0,1,2,3 = 4th segment).

Sections are also numbered from sections 1 and up. Section value zero is used in the symbol table for symbols that are not defined in any section (undefined). Such as an method, or data that exist within another binaries symbol table section.

A segment that has 7 sections would mean the last section is 8. Then if the following segment load command has 3 sections they are labelled as sections 9, 10, and 11. A section number of 10 would mean the second segment, section 2.

We would not be able to properly read the symbol table and linking information if we do not store the order the sections are read in and their address/file offset position.

You can easily use file offset without using the RAM addresses and relocations to build a symbol reader and to read the link edit sections and even map method calls or design a disassembler.

If building a Mach-O loader, then you want to dump the sections to the defined RAM addresses plus a base address to keep applications spaced apart so they do not write over one another.

The segment names and section names can be renamed to anything you like and there link will be no problems locating the appropriate sections by section number, or segment number as long as you do not alter the order the segment commands go in.

=== Link libraries ===

Link libraries are the same as any other Mach-O binary, just that there is no command that specifies the main entry point at which the program begins.

There are three load commands for loading a link library file.

Load command type are for the full file path to the dynamically linked shared library.

Load command type are for dynamically linked shared locations from the application&#x27;s current path.

Load command type is for a dynamically linked shared library that is allowed to be missing. The symbol names exist in other link libraries and are used if the library is missing meaning all symbols are weak imported.

The link library command is read as follows:
The file path name begins at the string offset, which is always 24. The number of bytes per text character is the remaining bytes in command size. The end of the library file path is identified by a character that is . The remaining values are used as padding, if any.

==== Link library ordinal numbers ====

The library is located by ordinal number in the compressed and uncompressed link edit information sections.

Link libraries are numbered from ordinal 1 and up. The ordinal value zero is used in the symbol table to specify the symbol does not exist as an external symbol in another Mach-O binary.

The link edit information will have no problem locating the appropriate library to read by ordinal number as long as you do not alter the order in which the link library commands go in.

Link library command should be avoided for performance reasons, as in the case the library is missing, then a search must be performed through all loaded link libraries.

=== __LINKEDIT Symbol table ===

Mach-O application files and link libraries both have a symbol table command.

The command is read as follows:

The symbol file offset is the offset relative to the start of the Mach-O header to where the symbol entries begins in the file. The number of symbol entries marks the end of the symbol table.

A symbol has a name offset that should never exceed the string table size. Each symbol name offset is added to the string table file offset which in turn is relative to the start of the Mach-O header. Each symbol name ends with a byte value.

The symbol address uses a 32-bit address for 32-bit Mach-O files and a 64-bit address for 64-bit Mach-O files.

Each symbol entry is read as follows:

The symbol name offset is added to the string table offset. The last text character byte is read as .

The symbol type value has multiple adjustable sections in binary. The symbol type is read as follows:

The digits marked are used for the specified purpose; the digits marked are used for other purposes.

The three first binary digits are symbols that locate to function names relative to compiled machine code instructions and line numbers by address location. This information allows us to generate line numbers to the location your code crashed. Local debugging symbols are only useful when designing the application, but are not needed to run the application.

The following flag settings:

External symbols are symbols that have a defined address in the link library and can be copied to an undefined symbol in a Mach-O application. The address location is added to the link library base address.

A private symbol is skipped even if it matches the name of an undefined symbol. A private and external symbol can only be set to an undefined symbol if it is in the same file.

After the symbol type is the section number the symbol exists in. The section number is a byte value (0 to 255). You can add more sections than 255 using segment load commands, but the section numbers are then outside the byte value range used in the symbol entries.

A section number of zero means the symbol is not in any section of the application, the address location of the symbol is zero, and is set as Undefined. A matching External symbol name has to be found in a link library that has the symbol address.

The data info field contains the link library ordinal number that the external symbol can be found in with the matching symbol name. The data info bit field breaks down as follows:

The library ordinal number is set zero if the symbol is an external symbol, or exists in the current file. Only undefined symbols use the data info section to specify a library ordinal number and linker options.

The dynamic loader flag options are as follows:

Any of the 4 options that apply can be set.

The address type option values are as follows:

Only one address type value can be set by value. A Pointer is a value that is read by the program machine code to call a method from another binary file. Private means other programs are not intended to be able to read or call the function/methods other than the binary itself. Lazy means the pointer locates to the dyld_stub_binder which looks for the symbol then calls the method, then replaces the dyld_stub_binder location with the location to the symbol. Any more calls done from machine code in the binary will now locate to the address of the symbol and will not call the dyld_stub_binder.

==== Symbol table organization ====

The symbol table entries are all stored in order by type. The first symbols that are read are local debug symbols if any, then private symbols, then external symbols, and finally the undefined symbols that link to another binary symbol table containing the external symbol address in another Mach-O binary.

The symbol table information load command always exists if there is a symbol table section in the Mach-O binary. The command tells the linker how many local symbols there are, how many private, how many external, and how many undefined. It also identifies the symbol number they start at. The symbol table information is used before reading the symbol entries by the dynamic linker as it tells the dynamic linker where to start reading the symbols to load in undefined symbols and where to start reading to look for matching external symbols without having to read all the symbol entries.

The order the symbols go in the symbol section should never be altered as each symbol is numbered from zero up. The symbol table information command uses the symbol numbers for the order to load the undefined symbols into the stubs and pointer sections. Altering the order would cause the wrong method to be called during machine code execution.

=== __LINKEDIT Symbol table information ===

The symbol table information command is used by the dynamic linker to know where to read the symbol table entries under symbol table command , for fast lookup of undefined symbols and external symbols while linking.

The command is read as follows:

The symbol index is multiplied by 12 for Mach-O 32-bit, or 16 for Mach-O 64-bit plus the symbol table entries offset to find the offset to read the symbol entries by symbol number index.

The local symbol index is zero as it is at the start of the symbol entries. The local symbols are used for debugging information.

Number of local symbols is how many exist after the symbol index.

The same two properties are repeated for external symbols and undefined symbols for fast reading of the symbol table entries.

There is a small index/size gap between local symbols and external symbols if there are private symbols.

Any file offsets that are zero are unused.

==== Indirect table ====

The Mach-O loader records the symbol pointer sections and symbol stub sections during the segment load commands. They are sequentially used by the indirect symbol table to load in method calls. Once the section end is reached, we move to the next.

The Indirect symbol table offset locates to a set of 32-bit (4-byte) values that are used as a symbol number index.

The order the symbol index numbers go is the order we write each symbol address one after another in the pointer and stub sections.

The symbol stub section contains machine code instructions with JUMP instructions to the indirect symbol address to call a method/function from another Mach-O binary. The size of each JUMP instruction is based on processor type and is stored in the reserved2 value under the section32/64 of a segment load command.

The pointer sections are 32-bit (4-byte) address values for 32-bit Mach-O binaries and 64-bit (8-byte) address values for 64-bit Mach-O binaries. Pointers are read by machine code and the read value is used as the location to call the method/function rather than containing machine code instructions.

A symbol index number bit set are absolute methods meaning the pointer locates to the exact address of a method.

A symbol index number bit set are local methods meaning the pointer itself located to the method and that there is no method name (Local method).

If you are designing a disassembler you can easily map just the symbol name to the offset address of each stub and pointer to show the method or function call taking place without looking for the undefined symbol address location in other Mach-O files.

=== __LINKEDIT Compressed table ===

If the compressed link edit table command exists, then the undefined/external symbols in the symbol table are no longer needed. The indirect symbol table and location of the stubs and pointer sections are no longer required.

The indirect symbol table still exists in the case of building backwards compatible Mach-O files that load on newer and older OS versions.

Any file offsets that are zero are sections that are unused.

==== Binding information ====

The bind, weak bind, and lazy bind sections are read using the same operation code format.

Originally the symbol table would define the address type in the data info field in the symbol table as lazy, weak, or non-lazy.

Weak binding means that if the set library to look in by library ordinal number, and the set symbol name does not exist but exists under a different previously loaded Mach-O file then the symbol location is used from the other Mach-O file.

Lazy means the address that is written located to the dyld_stub_binder, which looks for the symbol then calls the method, then replaces the dyld_stub_binder location with the location to the symbol. Any more calls done from machine code in the binary will now locate to the address of the symbol and will not call the dyld_stub_binder.

The plain old bind section does not do any fancy loading or address tricks. The symbol must exist in the set library ordinal.

A byte value that is sets the link library ordinal number. The hex digit that is X is a 0 to 15 library ordinal number.

A byte value that is to sets the link library ordinal number to the value that is read after the operation code.

The byte sequence set ordinal number 132.

The number value after the operation code is encoded as a LEB128 number. The last 7 binary digits are added together to form a larger number as long as the last binary digit is set one in value. This allows us to encode variable length number values.

A byte value that is sets the symbol name. The hex digit marked X sets the flag setting.

Flag setting 8 means the method is weak imported. Flag setting 1 means the method is non weak imported.

The byte sequence sets the symbol name Example. The last text character byte is . It is also weak imported, meaning it can be replaced if another exportable symbol is found with the same name.

A byte value sets the current location. The hex digit marked X is the selected segment 0 to 15. After the operation code is the added offset as a LEB128 number to the segment offset.

The byte sequence sets the location to the third segment load command address and adds 140 to the address.

Operation code to binds the current set location to the set symbol name and library ordinal. Increments the current set location by the size 4 bytes for a 32-bit Mach-O binary or increments the set address by 8 for a 64-bit Mach-O binary.

The byte sequence 

Sets link library ordinal 1. Set location to segment number 2, and adds 140 to the current location. Looks for a symbol named Example in the selected library ordinal number. Operation code writes the symbol address and increments the current set address. The operation code after that sets the next symbol name to look for a symbol named Example2. Operation code writes the symbol address and increments the current set address.

The new format removes the repeated fields in the symbol table and makes the indirect symbol table obsolete.

=== Application main entry point ===

A load command starting with type is used to specify the address location the application begins at.

If the segments/sections of the program do not have to be relocated to run, then the main entry point is the exact address location. This is only if the application segment addresses are added to an application base address of zero and the sections did not need any relocations.

The main entry point in a Mach-O loader is the program&#x27;s base address plus the Address location. This is the address at which the CPU is set to begin running machine code instructions.

This replaced the old load command which varied by CPU type as it stored the state that all the registers should be at before the program starts.

=== Application UUID number ===

A load command starting with type is used to specify the universally unique identifier (UUID) of the application.

The UUID contains a 128-bit unique random number when the application is compiled that can be used to identify the application file on the internet or in app stores.

=== Minimum OS version ===

A load command starting with type is used to specify the minimum OS version information.

The Platform type the binary is intended to run on are as follows:

The 32-bit version value is read as a 16-bit value and two 8-bit values. A 32-bit version value of breaks down as which is 13 in value, then the next 8-bits is which is 2 in value, then the last 8-bits is which is zero in value giving a version number of 13.2.0v. The SDK version value is read the same way.

The number of tools to create the binary is a set of entries that are read as follows:

The tool type values are as follows:

The version number is read the same as OS version and SDK version.

With the introduction of Mac OS X 10.6 platform the Mach-O file underwent a significant modification that causes binaries compiled on a computer running 10.6 or later to be (by default) executable only on computers running Mac OS X 10.6 or later. The difference stems from load commands that the dynamic linker, in previous Mac OS X versions, does not understand. Another significant change to the Mach-O format is the change in how the Link Edit tables (found in the __LINKEDIT section) function. In 10.6 these new Link Edit tables are compressed by removing unused and unneeded bits of information, however Mac OS X 10.5 and earlier cannot read this new Link Edit table format. To make backwards-compatible executables, the linker flag &quot;-mmacosx-version-min=&quot; can be used.

==Other implementations==
A Mach-O application can be run on different operating systems or OS as long as a Mach-O binary image exists that matches the core type in your computer. Most desktops are x86, meaning that a Mach-O with an x86 binary will run without problems if you load the sections into memory. If the Mach-O is designed for iPhone, which has an ARM core, then you would need a PC with an ARM core (does not have to be apple silicon ARM) to run it; otherwise, you would have to change ARM encoded instructions to equivalent x86 encoded instructions. The problem of loading and directly executing a Mach-O is undefined symbols that call functions/methods from other Mach-O binaries that do not exist on another operating system. Some symbols can call other equivalent functions in the different operating systems or even call adaptor functions to make other binary function calls behave like the macOS equivalents. The Mach-O files stored on the device can vary between iPhone (iOS), macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Causing differences in function calls from undefined symbols.

Some versions of NetBSD have had Mach-O support added as part of an implementation of binary compatibility, which allowed some Mac OS 10.3 binaries to be executed.

For Linux, a Mach-O loader was written by Shinichiro Hamaji that can load 10.6 binaries. As a more extensive solution based on this loader, the Darling Project aims at providing a complete environment allowing macOS applications to run on Linux.

For the Ruby programming language, the ruby-macho library provides an implementation of a Mach-O binary parser and editor.

<text>The Office of Public Works (OPW) () (legally the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland) is a major Irish Government agency, which manages most of the Irish State&#x27;s property portfolio, including hundreds of owned and rented Government offices and police properties, oversees National Monuments and directly manages some heritage properties, and is the lead State engineering agency, with a special focus on flood risk management. It lies within the remit of the Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, with functions largely delegated to a Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform with special responsibility for the Office. The OPW has a central role in driving the Government&#x27;s property asset management reform process, both in respect of its own portfolio and that of the wider public service. The agency was initially known as Board of Works, a title inherited from a preceding body, and this term is still sometimes encountered.

The second oldest State agency in Ireland, the OPW subsumed the functions of the Commissioners and Overseers of Barracks (the Barrack Board) and the Board of Works / Civil Buildings Commissioners (which two agencies had in turn taken on the functions of the Office of the Surveyor General in 1762), the Directors-General of Inland Navigation (which had taken on the functions of the Fisheries Commissioners), and some functions of the Postmaster-General, and those of the Public Works Loans Commissioners.

In the 21st century, the OPW includes the Government Publications Office, and publishes the State gazette, Iris Oifigiúil, and also manages some aspects of the household of the president of Ireland. It for many years oversaw aspects of public procurement, including the first centralised national procurement office. Its fisheries functions later moved to more specialised departments, the inland navigation functions were largely transferred to Waterways Ireland in 1999, and many purchasing functions moved to the Office of Government Procurement in 2014.

==Name==
The body is formally &quot;the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland&quot;, though the full title is rarely used, other than in legislation, with &quot;Office of Public Works&quot; the main working title, even in parliamentary documents and accounts, and &quot;Board of Works&quot; also used. Legally the Office&#x27;s powers are vested in its three commissioners, though operationally it has a broader management team.

== History ==
===Preceding bodies===
Until the late 17th century, public buildings in Ireland were financed, constructed and maintained by royal officials, most notably the Surveyor General of Ireland, without any involvement of parliamentary authorities, but in 1700, the Irish Parliament created two bodies, a set of land trustees (the &quot;Trustees of Barracks&quot;), and the &quot;Commissioners and Overseers of Barracks&quot; (informally known as the &quot;Barrack Board&quot;) to handle military accommodation, using funds allocated by parliamentary vote. In 1759, the role of the Barrack Board was extended to include fortresses and other public buildings, and its name became &quot;the Barrack Board and Board of Works&quot;. The body of seven salaried commissioners were made responsible for forts, palaces and other public buildings, including Dublin Castle, specifically covering their furnishing and maintenance. The Surveyor General of the time, who was also, as had been the convention for at least decades, the &quot;Engineer General&quot; of the &quot;Board of Ordnance&quot;, raised some concerns about the potential interference of the new commissioners with his role, and in 1761, responsibility for fortifications was moved from the Barrack Board and Board of Works to the Board of Ordnance. However, in 1762, it was decided to abolish the office of Surveyor General, and this was completed by 1763, with most of its work transferred to the Barrack Board and Board of Works, and the remainder was continued by the staff of the Board of Ordnance, within which a reduced version of the role was created.

===Establishment===
The office of was created on 15 October 1831 by the Public Works (Ireland) Act 1831, which provided for a body of three commissioners, with powers to employ staff, pay for works, and make loans to other bodies, accountable quarterly to the Treasury in London. The Westminster Parliament took this step partly to better manage a sum of £500,000 which had been made available to deal with poverty caused by the 1831 famine in Ireland, and partly to reduce the cost and complexity arising from the proliferation of public bodies in the area of public works in Ireland. It was formed to assume the functions of the Commissioners for Public Buildings / Board of Works, the Commissioners and Overseers of Barracks (commonly known as the Barrack(s) Board), and the Directors-General of Inland Navigation (which had taken on the work of the former Fisheries Commissioners). The office also took on functions from other bodies, most specifically concerned with Ireland, including the Postmaster General and the Public Works Loan Commissioners, which continued to operate for several decades alongside the OPW, but also including the Commissioners of Woods and Forests (a United Kingdom-wide authority). The commissioners were given the power to pay salaries but not to promise or pay pensions. The body was, and sometimes still is, informally known as the Board of Works, from the name of one of the predecessor authorities.

===Development in the 19th century===
====Loans====
The Commissioners of Public Works were given responsibility for administration and recovery of funds provided for public relief works under an act of parliament of 1817, and given powers to extend further loans for construction or improvement of works, so long as there was some income from which to repay these loans, and to a cap of half a million pounds outstanding at any one time. Power to make outright grants, of up to 50,000 pounds, was also given. By 1845, the OPW had already disbursed more than a million pounds in loans and grants.

====Harbours, fisheries and roads====
Already from 1831, the OPW was made responsible for the completion of the part-built Kingstown Harbour (the town having been recently renamed), and Dunmore Harbour. Howth Harbour, as completed in the early 1820s, and the road from the village to Dublin city, were transferred from the Commissioners for Woods and Forests in 1836, and other royal harbours, at Ardglass and Donaghadee, were transferred to OPW control in 1838. The Commissioners of Public Works were initially assigned responsibility to collect repayment on loans advanced by the former Irish Fisheries Commissioners, as well as completing any fisheries pier construction projects already underway. A temporary commission sitting from 1834 made recommendations which resulted in a new act of parliament in 1842, which expanded the OPW&#x27;s remit around fisheries considerably, and was followed by further related acts over the following five years, which also added a role in the promotion of deep-sea fishing.

The Office of the Postmaster General had responsibility for several hundred miles of road built from the 1820s on by county Grand Juries, mostly in more remote parts of Ireland, while the Directors of Inland Navigation had also grant-funded the development of hundreds of miles of roads, and all of these were transferred to the Commissioners of Public Works.

====Inland navigation====
Inland navigation responsibilities transferred from the Directors General of Inland Navigation were initially focused on the upper River Shannon, including two of its major lakes and estuarine tributary the Maigue, and the River Boyne and the Tyrone Navigation. In 1839, the Shannon Commission, a body of three officials, was created to take responsibility for the whole Shannon Navigation system, but this body was dissolved already in 1846, and its functions transferred to the Office of Public Works, which was assigned two additional commissioners to take account of the increased workload. The navigation work employed considerable numbers of people during the Great Famine, and over half a million pounds was spent on channel deepening, and the building of piers, embankments and bridges by 1850. Later works included the construction of the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell Canal, and further major developments on the Shannon system from 1880 to 1884, as well as a separate project on the River Suck system.

====Drainage and flood risk management====
The Office&#x27;s involvement with drainage began in its early years, and extended with the Drainage (Ireland) Act 1842, after which large-scale drainage schemes followed, and extended further after the passage of the Drainage (Ireland) Act 1846, which enabled the OPW to fully fund works.

The Arterial Drainage Act 1945, codified the work of the OPW in this area, and required the elaboration of a national drainage plan. From 1948 to 1992 works were carried out on more than 30 rivers, protecting 647,050 acres of land.

====The Famine years====
The commissioners were asked to provide work to help mitigate the effects of the Great Famine, with four acts passed at Westminster in 1846 for what were called &quot;relief works&quot;, respectively for general public works, county works, building of piers, harbours and fisheries facilities, and drainage projects. These were followed by additional acts to support the issuing of loans to finance further employment, but there were issues with quality control, coordination across districts, and management of the large workforces involved.

====Civic buildings====
From the Commissioners of Civic Buildings, management of Dublin Castle, the Phoenix Park, and official residences and court buildings was moved to the OPW from its inception, followed by district-level mental asylums in 1834. In 1836 the Treasury Building at Dublin Castle was converted as a base for the newly formed Royal Irish Constabulary and placed in OPW care, and in 1842 the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, and the new Smithfield Prison, were also taken in hand, followed in 1845 by the Queen&#x27;s Colleges at Cork, Galway and Belfast - which later became University College Cork, University College Galway and Queen&#x27;s University Belfast - and Maynooth College. Management of coast guard and customs facilities was also assumed in 1845, and by 1857 properties concerned with the Revenue Commissioners, the Post Office and the &quot;National Education Board&quot; were also under OPW management.

The OPW had responsibility for the building of primary school teacher housing and national school buildings from 1856, and for local dispensaries, and provision of financial help towards housing for the working classes, both urban and farm labouring. Major works were performed concerning other public buildings, including the erection of the National Museum and National Library, with a budget of 100,000 pounds.

====Railways and trams====
The Office was responsible from 1842 for interactions between railways and inland waterways, with the aim to ensure there was no interference with inland navigation passage, or drainage. The OPW was additionally given powers under legislation concerning tram and light rail systems, from 1860, 1861 and 1889, and could advance loans towards construction and maintenance costs. Later in the 19th century, the OPW was further given the power to fund railway construction in &quot;congested districts&quot; in the western side of Ireland, and it was involved with at least one such project, in County Donegal.

====National monuments====
The OPW assumed powers over some heritage properties from 1869, with transfers of historic buildings formerly vested in the Church of Ireland taking place over following years. These included the remains of major monastic settlements, such as Glendalough, the Rock of Cashel, Clonmacnoise and Monasterboice, as well as later monasteries, abbeys and friaries, some cathedrals, round towers, high crosses and monks&#x27; cells; also transferred were some ogham stones. Eighteen additional properties were assigned to the care of the OPW in 1882, under the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882, including stone forts such as the complex of megalithic monuments including Newgrange, Knowth and Dowth, now known as Brú na Bóinne, the Grianan of Aileach and Staigue Fort, the stone circles at Moytura, Cong, County Mayo, the Hill of Tara, Navan Fort, Slieve na Calliagh, and, in County Sligo, Queen Meave&#x27;s Tomb and the Knocknarea passage tomb.

In 1892 the OPW was given general powers concerning any &quot;ancient or medieval structure of historic or architectural interest&quot;, with further powers granted in 1903 and 1923. Some powers required the consent of land owners, and this was sometimes refused, as by the then Lord Dunsany in 1893, concerning Trim Castle. By 1983 over 400 monuments were registered with the Commission of Public Works and another 417 were subject to preservation orders. 

===The 20th century===
Up until the early 1920s, the OPW was, as all parts of the Irish Executive, the branch of the British Government in Ireland, an all-Ireland body. After independence, the OPW&#x27;s reporting line moved from the Treasury to the Department of Finance, where it remained for decades (before moving to the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform in 2011).

From the 1980s, the OPW led work on Dublin Castle, the former College of Science on Merrion Street turned Government Buildings, and the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham. The original &quot;Ballinamore and Ballyconnell Canal&quot; having failed, and been transferred to the relevant local authorities, the canal and associated waters were transferred back to the modern OPW and reworked as the Shannon–Erne Waterway between 1990 and 1994, when it reopened on time and within budget.

Between 1998 and 2000, the OPW managed the development of a new office complex for Leinster House, with offices for more than 100 members and staff of the Oireachtas and new committee and party leader rooms. 2000 also saw the delivery of a new visitor and educational building for the National Botanic Gardens, the completion of work on Rathfarnham Castle, two projects at the Irish Museum of Modern Art, and the beginning of work to make Farmleigh usable as the State&#x27;s premium accommodation for visiting dignitaries. The OPW also delivered projects outside Ireland, at the &quot;United Nations Plaza&quot; in New York, and for Expo 2000. From 2000, the OPW assumed responsibility for acquisition of sites for both primary and post-primary schools.

===Heritage sites===
The OPW had general responsibility for the majority of heritage sites within the Republic of Ireland prior to 1996. In 1996 the management of most of these sites was transferred to a new agency, Dúchas, branded as &quot;Dúchas: The Heritage Service&quot;, within another department of government. Dúchas, which also included the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), adopted a stylised version of the traditional OPW logo, with the OPW changing its logo to match its new focus on its buildings and maintenance functions. In 2003 Dúchas was wound up and some of its functions are now operated by a standalone &quot;National Parks and Wildlife Service&quot;, and some by the &quot;National Monuments Service&quot; (NMS) at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, while functions not transferred to the NPWS or the NMS reverted to being OPW responsibilities, which mainly relate to built heritage sites; these functions are operated under the brand &quot;Heritage Ireland&quot;.

===The 21st century===
The OPW continued an annual programme of property acquisition by purchase and lease, and disposal, including civil service, police, prison and educational facilities, as well as managing a range of strategic projects. In 2001, the Office funded a major study of the River Tolka for three local authorities, and managed projects on the Irish Colleges in Paris and Rome, and the Island of Ireland Peace Park in Mesen, Belgium, and in 2002, projects included civic offices, laboratories, the completion of a new wing at the National Gallery of Ireland, the erection of new exhibitions at the National Museum of Ireland, Collins Barracks, and the launch of an online version of the State gazette. In 2003, the OPW was assigned the task of locating and contracting, fitting-out or adapting offices for 10,000 civil servants scheduled to move out from Dublin to various other urban areas in a mass decentralisation programme, in addition to which it completed a new Garda Siochana command centre at Harcourt Square, and a passport production facility in Balbriggan. In 2004–2005, projects included the construction of new staff offices, a restaurant and entrance facilities at Dublin Zoo, and the completion of a multi-year restoration of the Victorian &quot;Palm House&quot; at the Botanic Gardens and of the glass houses on Garinish Island, as well as supporting both the development of the Aviva Stadium and of the new National Sports Campus at Abbotstown, County Dublin.

In 2006, it was announced that the OPW&#x27;s own headquarters would be decentralised to Trim, County Meath, and an internal competition was held for the design of a new headquarters building. The Trim Headquarters officially opened in late 2008 with staff moving in in the following months. A small number of staff remained in 52 St Stephen&#x27;s Green which was part of the former Dublin Headquarters (51 St Stephen&#x27;s Green). The Backwestern Laboratory project, which cost over 200 million euro was completed, and the sale by the OPW of state property in Ballsbridge yielded over 170 million euro. In 2010, the head office of the OPW move to Trim, while the National Convention Centre in Dublin opened, under a public-private partnership, and a major wave of flood risk mamagement studies got underway, including reviews of Cork&#x27;s River Lee, and Dublin&#x27;s River Dodder. In 2011, the OPW noted that visitor numbers to its managed properties exceeded 3.5 million, and it managed aspects of the State visits of both Queen Elizabeth II and President Barack Obama. In 2012, the Office set up a central IT system for its libraries, and a construction management system for National Monuments sites. Major works were also completed at Clonmacnoise and the Hill of Tara, and 230 bridges were repaired or replaced. The National Procurement Service continued to operate within the OPW, and the Government appointed its first Chief Procurement Officer.

In 2014, visitor numbers to major OPW-managed heritage sites passed 4 million, while the Irish presidency of the EU was hosted at a much lower cost than a decade earlier due to use of OPW-managed office premises and Dublin Castle. The National Procurement Service was moved from the OPW to an independent establishment under the same government department.

In 2021 the 300 remaining Dublin staff vacated 52 St Stephen&#x27;s Green and moved to 1GQ on George&#x27;s Quay, Dublin 2, bringing to an end to their decades long presence on the iconic Dublin Georgian square.

== Functions ==
The OPW operates as a service provider and facilitator of expertise to government departments, offices and other agencies in the areas of:
* Property management and maintenance – services include architecture, valuation, quantity surveying and project management, engineering, as well as ongoing facilities management, and estate portfolio management
* Heritage property oversight, and management for selected major heritage properties - including the conservation, preservation and presentation of heritage and cultural properties, and the running of the annual lottery for attendance at Newgrange for the winter solstice
* Flood risk management – the OPW is the lead agency for flood risk management in Ireland, responsible for developing and implementing comprehensive policies and strategies for flood risk management. It leads and co-ordinates a whole of government approach to flood risk management across three strategic and policy areas of prevention, protection and preparedness.

The OPW also:
* manages the State Art Collection, comprising more than 16,000 works, with around 90% on public display in State offices and heritage properties,
* operates the Government Publications Office, including managaing a sales facility to the public for government publications - this part of the Office also produces , the Irish government&#x27;s gazette).

Central functions of the Office include multiple libraries.

===Property management and maintenance===
The OPW is the main provider of services to departments and agencies of the Irish government related to property procurement, construction and fit-out, and management. Specific services related to construction and fit-out include design and architecture, valuation and quantity surveying, project management, and engineering. For ongoing holdings, the OPW can deliver facilities management, and it also manages the overall State estate portfolio. As part of this work, it manages aspects of the Presidential household.

===Flood risk management===
The OPW&#x27;s early work in flood risk management was centred on arterial drainage, working from minor and major rivers, and accounting for 11,500 km of channels. This work continues in the 21st century, with channels maintained in 1- to 20-year cycles, most commonly at 4- to 6-year intervals.

As of 2019, the OPW oversaw 434 watercourse monitoring stations, with more than half a million visits to the Office&#x27;s water level data website. 580 projects had been completed under a scheme for minor flood works, and coastal protection, and 45 flood relief schemes for a total investment of around .

===Former functions===
The OPW oversaw aspects of public procurement, including the first centralised national procurement office, with most of these moved to the Office of Government Procurement in 2014. It had a number of fisheries-related functions, later moved to more specialised departments, while its inland navigation functions, concerning major canals and the Shannon and Erne Navigations, were largely transferred to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht in 1996, and to Waterways Ireland in 1999.

== Organisation ==
The Commissioners comprise a Chairman (as of 2021, Maurice Buckley) and two other commissioners. The OPW&#x27;s management board, which includes the chairman and commissioners, and heads of divisions - including the State Architect - is the group which directs the activities of the Office, and advises the relevant Minister and Minister of State on policy.

The Commissioners of Public Works operate under the mandate of, and are responsible for the exercise of the powers, duties and functions conferred on them by, the Public Works (Ireland) Act 1831 and subsequent legislation, to, the Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform. This authority has largely been delegated to the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, to whom the Office&#x27;s annual report is submitted. The Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform remains responsible to Dáil Éireann for the exercise and performance of any powers and duties delegated to the Minister of State, and the use of certain powers by the Commissioners requires ministerial consent.

The staff of the organisation comprise part of the Civil Service of the State. The OPW is a &quot;scheduled Office&quot; under the &quot;Public Service Management Act 1997&quot;, which sets out arrangements for the management of Departments and Offices and the specification of individual responsibilities and accountability at a senior level. The Chairman of the Commissioners is the administrative Head of the OPW and is also the &quot;Accounting Officer&quot; for the OPW. The OPW is the subject of a specific Vote of the Oireachtas for annual funding, currently &quot;Vote 13&quot;, and receives also funding from client departments, offices and agencies - the resulting accounts are submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor-General annually.

==Publications==
===Official publications===
The Commissioners of Public Works published an annual report from 1832 and 1939, halting during The Emergency, as World War II was known in Ireland. The report was resumed by the OPW in 1990, and continues to issue annually, with an electronic archive online holding reports since 2000.

The OPW also publishes a range of internal documents, including a semi-annual internal magazine, &quot;Obair&quot;.

===Books and booklets===
The OPW has historically published a wide range of books and booklets on Ireland&#x27;s heritage properties, as well as the State&#x27;s official gazette, Iris Oifigiúil, copies of bills, Acts of the Oireachtas and various other materials.

<doc id="694233" wikidata="Q4192382" url="?curid=694233" title="V (group)">
<text>V are a British five-piece boy band made up of Antony Brant, Aaron Buckingham, Mark Harle, Kevin McDaid and Leon Pisani. Founded in 2003, they disbanded after two years, in 2005. They reunited in 2023 without Mark Harle.

==Career==
V were formed in 2003 after a series of auditions by Prestige, the same management team behind Busted. Group member Antony Brant came up with the band name &quot;V&quot; because V is the Roman numeral for five and there were five members in the band. V made their debut at the same time as McFly by supporting Busted&#x27;s arena tour in the spring of 2004.

Their first single, &quot;Blood, Sweat and Tears&quot;, was released in May 2004 and went into the UK Singles Chart at number 6. The music video was shot in Miami, Florida in February 2004 and the single contained a collaboration with McFly, called &quot;Chills in the Evening&quot; written by Tom Fletcher from McFly and James Bourne from Busted. The band&#x27;s second single, released in August 2004, was a double A-side and consisted of a new song &quot;Hip to Hip&quot; and a cover of the Jacksons&#x27; song &quot;Can You Feel It&quot;. The music video showed the group dressed up in day-to-day jobs like an ice cream man and milkman. It charted at number 5 in the UK Singles Chart.

The third single, &quot;You Stood Up&quot;, reached number 12 after an appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, but their debut album of the same name only made number 86 on the UK Albums Chart. In March 2005, V announced on their website their decision to split up, stating &quot;it just hasn&#x27;t happened for us as big as we would have liked&quot;. They reunited in 2023 without Mark Harle to record new music and perform shows in the UK.

==After break-up==
*Mark Harle was a drummer for indie band Little Comets between 2008 and 2011.
*Kevin McDaid became a professional photographer, including photographing the covers for the Westlife albums &quot;Where We Are&quot; and &quot;Gravity&quot;
* Aaron Buckingham moved into A&amp;R work, including managing the band Lawson
* Antony Brant remained friends with the members of McFly, and toured with the band alongside James Bourne and the Vamps in the spring of 2013 as a compere to their Memory Lane tour

<text>Great Houghton is a village and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley in South Yorkshire, England), on the border with West Yorkshire. It lies to the west of Thurnscoe, on the B6411 road, and is located at approximately 53° 33&#x27; 20&quot; north, 1° 21&#x27; west, at an elevation of around 60 m above sea level. At the 2001 census it had a population of 2,261, increasing to 2,475 at the 2011 census.

Great Houghton is a former mining village and its mines were served by the railway, which has since gone, but remains are still visible.

The village has a primary school called Sandhill. The old school building that stood on the main street was demolished in 2007 and was replaced with a new Private Finance Initiative primary school.

Some parts of Great Houghton were affected by the 2007 summer flooding, which caused extensive damage in neighbouring villages.

<text>The Rover 200 Series, and later the Rover 25, are a series of small family cars that were produced by British manufacturer Rover from 1984 until 2005.

There have been three distinct generations of the Rover 200. The first generation was a four-door saloon car based on the Honda Ballade. The second generation was available in three or five-door hatchback forms, as well a coupé and cabriolet (in relatively small numbers). Its sister model, the Honda Concerto was built on the same production line in Rover&#x27;s Longbridge factory. The final generation was developed independently by Rover on the platform of its predecessor, and was available as a three or five-door hatchback. Just before BMW&#x27;s sale of Rover in 2000, and following a facelift, the model was renamed and sold as the Rover 25, and the MG ZR was based on the Rover 25 with mechanical changes to the suspension. Production ceased in 2005 when MG Rover went into administration. Production rights and tooling for the model, but not the Rover name, now belong to Chinese car manufacturer Nanjing.

==Rover 200 (SD3; 1984–1989)==

The original Rover 200 (sometimes referred to by the codename &quot;SD3&quot;) was the replacement for the earlier Triumph Acclaim, and was the second product of the alliance between British Leyland (BL) and Honda. Only available as a four-door saloon, the 200 series was intended to be more upmarket than the company&#x27;s Maestro and Montego models, which the 200 Series came in between in terms of size. It was launched on 19 June 1984, at which time there was still a high demand for small family saloons, with many manufacturers selling this type of car under a different nameplate to similar-sized hatchbacks. For example, Ford was selling the saloon version of the Escort as the Orion, the saloon version of the Volkswagen Golf was called the Jetta, and Vauxhall would soon launch an Astra-based saloon called the Belmont. The Rover 200 Series, however, was not based on a hatchback.

Earlier in 1984, Austin Rover had confirmed that the successor to the Acclaim would be badged as a Rover rather than a Triumph – a decision which signalled the end for the Triumph brand. The move was seen as controversial as the Rover brand had long been associated with large executive saloons as well as the Land Rover and Range Rover, and there were fears that its application to a small Japanese-derived compact would devalue the Rover name.

Essentially, the 200 series was a British-built Honda Ballade, the original design of which had been collaborated upon by both companies. Engines employed were either the Honda Civic derived E series &#x27;EV2&#x27; 1.3-litre 12-valve engine, or British Leyland&#x27;s own S-series engine in 1.6-litre format (both in carburettor and Lucas EFi form). The resulting cars were badged as either &quot;Rover 213&quot; or &quot;Rover 216&quot;.

The 213 used either a Honda five-speed manual gearbox or a Honda three-speed automatic transmission. The British-engined 216 also employed a Honda five-speed manual gearbox, unlike the S-Series engine when fitted in the Maestro and Montego. There was also the option of a German ZF four-speed automatic on some 216 models as well.

The Honda-badged version was the first Honda car to be built in the United Kingdom (the Honda equivalent of the 200 Series&#x27; predecessor, the Triumph Acclaim, was never sold in the UK). Ballade bodyshells, and later complete cars, were made in the Longbridge plant alongside the Rover equivalent, with the Ballade models then going to Honda&#x27;s new Swindon plant for quality-control checks.

Although production ceased in late 1989, stocks of the car continued to be available until early 1990, when it was replaced by the Rover 400.

This model of car (SD3 saloon version; 216S in the first series, then replaced by a 216SE EFi model) is well known as Richard and Hyacinth Bucket&#x27;s car in the BBC Television sitcom &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot; (1990–1995).

==Rover 200 (R8; 1989–1995)==

The &quot;R8&quot; Rover 200, sometimes referred to as the Mk 2 Rover 200, was launched on 11 October 1989. Unlike the Mk 1, Ballade-based, 200, this model was a five-door hatchback designed to replace the Maestro while the saloon variant, called the 400 Series, was effectively the replacement for the previous Rover 200 Series when it was launched in April 1990. The 400 had a different name in an effort to position it slightly upmarket from the hatchback version, analogous to the Ford Orion, the saloon version of the Ford Escort. Once again, the model was designed in collaboration with Honda (who produced the new designed-for-Europe Concerto model) and both models would share production lines at Rover&#x27;s Longbridge facility. The 200 and Concerto itself were based on the 4th generation Civic (EC), of which the 3-door hatchback, coupé CRX and saloon versions were sold in the United Kingdom.

The R8 200 was the first car to be introduced by the newly privatised Rover Group.

The Maestro continued alongside the Rover 200 hatchback as a budget option until production finished in December 1994.

The 200 also spawned three-door hatchback, coupé and convertible versions, while the 400 eventually spawned an estate version, referred to as the Tourer. These latter variants were solely Rover designed and produced products, with no Honda Concerto versions available. Initial plans to sell the coupe version under the MG marque were abandoned, although the 5-door hatchback was the most popular and common version. 

The 200 also saw the introduction of Rover&#x27;s brand-new K-series family of engines (appearing in 1.4 L (1396 cc) twin-cam 16-valve form). The 1.6 L (1590 cc) version used either a Honda D16A6 SOHC or D16A8 DOHC powerplant, while the 2.0 L M-series unit from the 800-series followed soon afterwards (1991) in the sportier versions. Later versions used the Rover T-series engine, with limited-run turbocharged Rover 220s in GTi and GSi-Turbo trims, boasting a power output of as standard. The Rover-engined models drove the front wheels via jointly developed Peugeot/Rover R65 gearboxes (1.4-litre) and Rover PG-1 gearboxes for the 1.6- and 2.0-litre versions. From December 1990, the carburettor-engine 214S (with a 1.4 engine from the Metro) was added to the range, but discontinued within two years due to EEC emissions requirements. Its gap was filled by the 214i, which featured the 1.4 K-series unit from the 214Si and 214SLi.

Also available were two PSA (non-electronically controlled Lucas CAV injection pumps) Indirect injection diesel engines, with the choice of naturally aspirated 1.9-litre XUD9 or turbocharged 1.8 XUD7T engines. They were class leaders for refinement in Peugeot and Citroën installations, but less refined in the Rovers. These engines were installed instead of the non-electronically controlled Bosch HPVE Direct Injection Rover MDi / Perkins Prima used in the Austin Maestro and Montego, because that engine with its noisy combustion but lower fuel consumption, was deemed too unrefined for the new models.

In France, Italy, and Portugal, where demand for diesel cars was high, Honda offered a rebadged 200 Turbodiesel called the Concerto TD. Despite the Concerto name, this model retained the 200&#x27;s exterior lighting, suspension, and trim.

On its launch, the R8 200 was one of the few new designs in the small family car class. For instance, Ford&#x27;s Escort had been around since 1980, (with a facelift in early 1986) and Vauxhall&#x27;s Astra was unchanged from its 1984 launch. Indeed, the only major European competitors that had been around for less than five years were the Peugeot 309, Renault 19 and Fiat Tipo. However, the Escort, Astra and Golf had all been replaced by the start of 1992.

On average, up to 110,000 Rover 200 and 400 (R8) models were sold each year, more than half being sold in Britain. The 214 won &quot;What Car?&quot;&#x27;s 1990 &quot;Car of the Year&quot;, but was not considered for the 1990 European Car of the Year award as it was not yet available on the required number of European markets for it to be shortlisted.

The 4-seat Cabriolet (codenamed Tracer) and the Coupé (codenamed Tomcat) were developed concurrently and were based on the 3-door understructure. Rover worked closely with Pininfarina to develop the hood mechanism of the Cabriolet, with the car being announced in spring 1992.

In the autumn of 1992, the 200 received a mild facelift, featuring redesigned front indicator lights, but unlike its 400 sibling, which was also facelifted at the same time, the car did not feature a new grille (which Rover reintroduced on the 1992 &quot;R17&quot; facelift of the Rover 800) or new body coloured bumpers. This led to some owners retro-fitting the 400&#x27;s new grille on to the 200. In 1993 Rover finally added the new grille and body coloured bumpers to the 200 range.

The Coupé was also launched in autumn 1992 and featured an entry-level 1.6 SOHC, and a normally aspirated or turbocharged 2.0-litre T-series. In several markets, where engine taxation was based on displacement, the 1.6 SOHC and the normally aspirated 2.0 were replaced with a single, 1.6 DOHC–engined version. The 1.6 was also available with a 4-speed automatic gearbox.

The 220 Turbo was the fastest Rover to be produced at the time, with a top speed of more than 150mph. Rover had originally considered marketing the coupe version of the car as an MG, but eventually decided to include it as part of the Rover 200 range. The addition of more powerful versions of the Rover 200 Series, including the GTi models, saw the demise of the high performance MG Maestro 2.0 EFi and Turbo models in 1991.

As publicity for the Coupé&#x27;s launch, a group of volunteer Rover employees prepared two special Land Speed Record cars and after an aborted run in August, broke 37 UK Land Speed Records on 26/27 September 1992 at the Millbrook Proving Ground, Bedfordshire. These included a flying 5 km average speed of and a 24-hour average speed of . 36 of these records remain unbroken. The record breaking was referred to as &quot;The Tomcat Affair&quot;, in reference to the project&#x27;s development codename.

==Rover 200 (R3; 1995–1999)==

The Rover 200, codenamed &quot;R3&quot;, was smaller than the Honda-based R8 cars. This was due to Rover&#x27;s need to replace the ageing Metro, which by now was 15 years old. Although some elements of the previous 200 / 400 were carried over (most notably the front structure, heater, steering and front suspension). Honda were contracted by Rover to provide tooling and feasibility experts working alongside their Rover colleagues both in Japan and in the Design Studio at Canley. This was also at a time when Honda were moving production of the Honda Concerto replacement from Longbridge to Swindon, freeing up capacity for 60,000 units at Rover. At this point, the car had a cut-down version of the previous car&#x27;s rear floor and suspension and was codenamed SK3 but was not sufficiently profitable.

After a delay, to consider several options to maintain production volumes at Longbridge, the SK3 project was revised by the Rover Engineering Team. The major change being a Maestro/Montego derived H-frame rear suspension package that allowed fitment of a fuel tank, a full-size spare wheel and an exhaust silencer whilst retaining a good-sized boot, as opposed to only 3-out-of-4 that the carry-over R8 rear suspension allowed in the SK3 package. This also saved over £100 per car allowing the project to be approved for production. The new programme was renamed R3, to align with other programmes. 

By the time the car was launched, Honda and Rover had already been &quot;divorced&quot; after the BMW takeover the previous year. The new 200 used K-series petrol engines, most notably the 1.8 L VVC version from the MGF, and L-series diesel engine. During the mid-1990s the L-series was a very competitive engine, regarded as second only to the Volkswagen TDI in overall performance, and an improvement over the R8&#x27;s XUD - particularly in fuel economy, while almost matching it for refinement.

Launched with 1.4i 16v () and 1.6i 16v () petrol engines and 2.0 turbodiesel ( and intercooled versions) engines, the range grew later to include a 1.1i () and 1.4i 8v () engines and also 1.8 16v units in standard () and variable valve formats (). R65 Peugeot/Rover Manual gearboxes carried over from the R8 Rover 200 were available across the range and a CVT option was available on the 1.6i 16v unit.

The R3 featured a completely redesigned interior and dashboard to accommodate the fitment of a passenger airbag in line with new safety standards. Changes to the front structure, with the addition of a transverse strut at the back of the engine bay, improved the crash performance of the car,

The 1.8-litre models earned a certain amount of praise for their performance, whilst the intercooled turbo diesel was claimed as one of the fastest-accelerating diesel hatchbacks on the market in the late 1990s.

Unlike its predecessor, the R3 was not available in Coupe, Cabriolet or Tourer bodystyles, although Rover updated these versions of the older model with mild styling revisions and the fitting of the new dashboard from the R3, which was possible due to the shared front bulkhead. In the UK, these models were no longer branded as 200/400 models, simply being referred to as the Rover Coupe, Cabriolet and Tourer.

The Rover 200 might have been marketed as a supermini, it compares closely in size and engine range with contemporary models such as the Ford Fiesta and Vauxhall Corsa. Instead Rover priced the car to compete with vehicles like the Ford Escort and Vauxhall Astra. Rover&#x27;s only offering in the supermini segment at the time was the ageing Metro and this gap in the company&#x27;s line-up needed to be filled.

The third generation 200 was initially popular, being Britain&#x27;s seventh-best-selling new car in 1996 through to 1998. Within three years it had fallen out of the top 10 completely and was being outsold by traditionally poorer selling cars like the Fiat Bravo/Brava and Renault Mégane.

===Rover 200 BRM===

The Rover 200 BRM was first shown at the 1997 Frankfurt Motor Show, the reaction from the press and public was good enough that after a year of development the Rover 200 BRM LE was officially launched at the British Motor Show in October 1998. It was based on the range-topping Vi model but with 1960&#x27;s BRM styling cues. The engine was the 1.8-litre VVC K-Series.

Inside, there were red quilted leather seats and door panels, red carpet, seat belts and steering wheel. Alloy heater controls and turned aluminium trim complimented this. On the outside, there was Brooklands Green paintwork, with silver trim details, 16-inch alloy wheels, and an exclusive woven mesh grille sat above a large orange snout in the front bumper, which was the BRM trademark nose on all of its 1960s Formula One racing cars.
Technical adjustments consisted of lower ride height over the Vi and improved damping and handling, a close-ratio gearbox with a TorSen differential further developed from the Rover 220 Turbo, reduced torque steer and improved straight-line stability.

The price was £18,000, excluding extras such as air conditioning, passenger airbag and a CD player. There were only 795 built for the UK, with an additional 350 for overseas markets. The steep price was originally slashed to £16,000 and when the Rover 25 was launched, this was cut to £14,000 to get rid of vehicles still lingering in showrooms.

===Safety===
The NCWR organisation (New Car Whiplash Ratings) tested the Rover 200 and awarded it the following scores:

G = Good
A = Acceptable
M = Marginal
P = Poor

===Reviews===
The Rover 200 received moderate to good reviews from the motoring press.
* Parker&#x27;s Car Guides &#x27;Pros: Cheap to buy; good to drive.&#x27; | &#x27;Cons: Reliability hasn&#x27;t been good.&#x27;
* RAC &#x27;It may not be &#x27;Above All&#x27; but it&#x27;s certainly a Rover. These days that means class, which, in this case, needn&#x27;t cost a lot.&#x27;

==Rover 25 (1999–2005)==

A facelifted version of the Rover 200, renamed the &quot;Rover 25&quot; (internal codename &quot;Jewel&quot;) was launched in late 1999. It was repositioned and priced to compete with the Ford Fiesta and Vauxhall Corsa, rather than larger cars like the Ford Focus and Vauxhall Astra. This version used similar frontal styling to the larger 75 model. The chassis had been uprated to give sportier handling (suspension and steering setup from 200&quot;vi&quot;) and the front end had been restyled to give it the corporate Rover look first seen in the range-topping 75, a number of safety improvements and interior changes were made, but the 25 was instantly recognisable as a reworked 200 Series. The 1.4 L, 1.6 L, and 1.8 L petrol engines as well as the 2.0 L diesel were all carried over from the previous range. CVT automatic gearboxes were carried over from the R3 200, with &#x27;Steptronic&#x27; (later &#x27;Stepspeed&#x27; post-BMW demerger) semi-automatic system available from late 2000. R65 manual gearboxes were again carried over but were later superseded by Ford &#x27;IB5&#x27; units in mid-2003. The 1.8-litre engined cars and all diesels used Rover&#x27;s PG1 5-speed manual gearbox throughout the car&#x27;s life.

The Rover 25 also saw the introduction, from autumn 2000, of the 16V twin-cam version of the 1.1 L K-Series engine, replacing the 1.1 single-cam 8-valve K-Series engine previously found in the Rover 211i. This development saw power boosted from .

Less than a year after the Rover 25 was launched, BMW sold the Rover Group to the Phoenix consortium for a token £10. By the summer of 2001, the newly named &quot;MG Rover Group&quot; had introduced a sporty version of the Rover 25: the MG ZR. It had modified interior and exterior styling, as well as sports suspension, to give the car the look of a &quot;hot&quot; hatchback. The largest engine in the range was the 1.8 VVC  unit, which had a top speed of . It was frequently the UK&#x27;s best-selling &quot;hot hatch&quot;. At this time the Rover 25 GTi was discontinued.

Initially available in i, iE, iS, iL and GTi trim levels, a range topping iXL model was introduced in 2002 adding full leather upholstery, passenger airbag and 15-inch &#x27;Coronet&#x27; alloy wheels to the iL specification. Initially available with the 1.6-litre K series engine, a 1.4-litre version of the iXL followed. 

In 2003, Rover made a version of the car with increased ride height and chunkier bumpers, called Streetwise. The car was marketed by Rover as an &quot;urban on-roader&quot;. They also introduced a van version of the 25 called the Rover Commerce.

In 2004, MG Rover gave the cars an exterior restyle to make them look more modern. The majority of changes however were focused on the interior, which featured a completely new layout and fascia design. Trim levels were revised to i, Si, SEi and SXi, with high-spec leather-trimmed GLi, GSi and GXi models introduced for the 2005 model year.

Production of both cars was suspended in April 2005 when the company went into administration. In March 2005, the 25 won the &quot;Bargain of the Year Award&quot; at the Auto Express Used Car Honours: &quot;The compact hatchback was recognised by the judges for the availability and affordability that help make five-year old examples an attractive purchase proposition.&quot;

In late 2005 a hybrid prototype drivertrain version was seen in the longbridge flight shed while Richard Porter for topgear Magazine was doing Urban exploration of longbridge. &quot;There was a rover 25 wich had a load of paperwork around it and it seemed like it had a hybrid drivetrain&quot; .They also had a 1st generation Toyota Prius parked at the side of the flight shed while MG was open and operational for benchmarking purposes prior to 2005.

Specifications for the Rover 25 design were purchased by Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation in early 2005, though new MG Rover Group owner, Nanjing Automobile Group now owns the tooling for the car. In 2008, the Streetwise, rebadged as the MG 3SW, was relaunched in China.

The Rover 25 was Britain&#x27;s best selling new car in April 2000, due to a brief surge in sales among buyers wanting to support the company at the time of their sell–off by BMW. However, sales quickly settled back down to normal levels, and although the asking price was now in line with other superminis, the 25 was never able to seriously compete with the Ford Fiesta and Vauxhall Corsa in terms of popularity. It was outsold by the Peugeot 206, Fiat Punto, Volkswagen Polo, Seat Ibiza, Skoda Fabia and Renault Clio.

===Safety===
The 25 underwent the Euro NCAP car safety tests in 2001 and achieved the following ratings:

The NCWR organisation (New Car Whiplash Ratings) tested the facelifted Rover 25 and awarded it the following scores:

G = Good
A = Acceptable
M = Marginal
P = Poor

===Security===
The Rover 25 was tested by Thatcham&#x27;s New Vehicle Security Ratings (NVSR) organisation and achieved the following ratings:


===Reviews===
The Rover 25 received mixed to good reviews from the motoring press.
* The AA &#x27;The original 200 ... was never going to sell against the Golfs and Astras of the time, even though that was the sales pitch and price. The 25 remedied this. We&#x27;re left with a hatchback that&#x27;s now the right size and price to compete; if only it were better equipped and these lower-range versions offered a bit more comfort when they&#x27;re on the move.&#x27;
* Parker&#x27;s Car Guides &#x27;Pros: Sporty driving experience, good quality.&#x27;&#x27;Cons: Cramped interior.&#x27;
* RAC &#x27;The Rover 25 series has developed into a very fine range of cars [and] additional chassis work had taken place ... to bring the standard models up to the old 200vi&#x27;s handling standards. Rover&#x27;s repositioning of the car had propelled a middle-order family hatch to somewhere near the top of the supermini class.&#x27;
* What Car? Reader Reviews &#x27;For – The 25 is cheap, quiet and has a roomy boot. Fuel consumption is good on petrols, too.&#x27;&#x27;Against – The interior is plain, build quality is iffy, the turbodiesel is unrefined, and safety standards are poor.&#x27;

==Powertrains==
These were the engines available for the Rover 200 (1995–1999) and Rover 25 (1999–2005). Each engine was modified at regular intervals throughout its life with economy and emissions improving with the changes.

Lynch was born in St. James Parish, Berkeley County, South Carolina, in 1727. He served in the Colonial Legislature of South Carolina and represented the colony in the Stamp Act Congress, heading the committee which drafted the petition to the House of Commons.

Elected to both the First and Second Continental Congresses, Lynch joined Benjamin Franklin and Benjamin Harrison on a committee sent to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to confer with General George Washington upon &quot;the most effectual method of continuing, supporting, and regulating the Continental Army.&quot; In the ensuing discussions, Washington told the committee of his plan to arm ships to prey upon British supply lines. The gentlemen from Congress approved of the scheme and recommended it to Congress, thus giving essential political support to the establishment of &quot;George Washington&#x27;s Navy,&quot; the first organized naval force of the new nation.

==Family==
Thomas Lynch&#x27;s wife, Hannah Motte, was a sister of Isaac Motte, who became a South Carolina Congressman. Following her death during childbirth, Lynch married Annabella Josephiné Dé&#x27;Illiard; after Lynch&#x27;s death, his widow Annabella married South Carolina Governor William Moultrie. His daughter Elizabeth married James Hamilton; their son James Hamilton Jr. was elected as governor of South Carolina in 1830. Following Lynch&#x27;s death from a stroke, their son Thomas Lynch Jr. was appointed to his seat in Congress and continued in a political career.

<text>The Preferred Executable Format is a file format that specifies the format of executable files and other object code. PEF executables are also called Code Fragment Manager files (CFM).

PEF was developed by Apple Computer for use in its classic Mac OS operating system. It was optimised for RISC processors. In macOS, the Mach-O file format is the native executable format. However, PEF was still supported on PowerPC-based Macintoshes running Mac OS X and was used by some Carbon applications ported from earlier versions for classic Mac OS, so that the same binary could be run on classic Mac OS and Mac OS X.

BeOS on PowerPC systems also uses PEF, although x86 systems do not.

<text>Brierley () is a village in the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley in South Yorkshire, England. The settlement is tightly clustered and green buffered on a modest escarpment close to the border with West Yorkshire, it is almost wholly in population south of the A628 road, and is less than to the south west of Hemsworth. 

Its late nineteenth century founded civil parish contained the pit village of Grimethorpe, and at the 2001 census had a population of 5,973, increasing to 7,267 in the 2011 Census. Brierley is at its core approximately above sea level on gently undulating slopes.

==History==
Brierley was an early Saxon settlement. The fort at Brierley Gap, mistakenly called Saxon, is from a much earlier period, probably the Iron Age. The village grew first around the hilltop on the Barnsley to Pontefract road where a small hollow and the sites of several wells provided a good building area.

Along Ket Hill Lane, coal seams come to the surface and form part of the soil so coal must have been known to these early farmers. Sandstone and coal in alternate layers are the underlying rocks of the area. In the Domesday Book, Brierley is referred to as &#x27;Brerelia&#x27; in the wapentake of Staincross. The actual Domesday Book spelling is &#x27;Breselia&#x27; but all ensuing documents use &#x27;Brerelia&#x27; as the correct form.

Later, this name became &#x27;Brereley&#x27;, then Brearley from which we get one of our modern pronunciations. It was first spelt as &#x27;Brierley&#x27; in some documents relating to the leasing of Brierley Manor by descendants of the Harryngton family, from Queen Elizabeth I in 1572.

This spelling of the name was not commonly used until it appeared in a Manor Court Roll for 1665. The early field boundaries can be recognised on the Ordnance Survey Map by the irregular way in which they ring the village and by the winding outline of their hedges due to the ploughing methods of the time.

On a well-hidden site between Brierley and Grimethorpe, stood the fortified Manor of Hall Steads (the name means &#x27;hall site&#x27;), which belonged to the early Brereley estate. Its manor house was surrounded by a high, stone wall and a moat in a dwindled demesne in latter years of .

The building was mainly of local sandstone and many of the stones remain in the soil among which fragments of 14th and 15th century pottery have been found. St Paul&#x27;s Church in Brierley was built in 1869 as a daughter church to the Parish of St Peter, Felkirk, it was deemed insufficient for the expanding population of the south of the area which formed Grimethorpe which equally became an ecclesiastical parish albeit later, in 1901, and the first vicar, set about raising funds to build its respective church.

Major donations were received from Mr F.J. Savile-Foljambe who donated the lands for the church and the vicarage and the Carlton Main Colliery, and the church was completed in 1904. St. Paul&#x27;s Church in Brierley was built in 1869 for George Savile Foljambe, Lord of the Manor of Brierley, to the designs of John Wade in the Gothic Revival style.

Foljambe provided half the cost of the church, and the rest was donated by other local principal people, the land for the church and former Brierley church school was given by Rev John Hoyland, vicar of Felkirk. The first curate was Rev Godfrey Pigott Cordeux.

== Civil parish ==
Brierley was formerly a township in the parish of Felkirk, from 1866 Brierley was a civil parish in its own right, on 1 April 2016 the parish was abolished.

==Notable people==
* Winifred Foley (1914–2009), writer who wrote about her childhood in the Forest of Dean, was born in Brierley.

<text>Shafton is a civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley in South Yorkshire, England, on the border with West Yorkshire. At the 2001 census it had a population of 2,840, increasing to 3,447 at the 2011 Census. The parish contains the villages of Shafton and Shafton Two Gates.

Shafton lies to the north of Shafton Two Gates, on the road to Ryhill. It is located at approximately 53° 35&#x27; 10&quot; North, 1° 24&#x27; West, at an elevation of around above sea level.
Sceptun in the Domesday Book of 1086 then later in c. 1160 Scaftona meaning a farmstead marked by a pole, or made with poles.

Shafton Two Gates lies to the south of Shafton and north of Cudworth, on the intersection of the A628 and A6195 roads. It is located at approximately , at an elevation of around above sea level.

Shafton Two Gates takes its name from the two roads that enter Shafton at this point. The etymology derives from the Old Norse word &quot;gata&quot;, the equivalent of the modern English word road. The two roads in question are both ancient and locally important. The more southerly of the two is the road between Pontefract and Barnsley, this section of which was made into Turnpike in 1833, with a turnpike gate which was sited slightly to the east of the modern roundabout serving the Cudworth Parkway and Engine Lane. The second more northerly road, is the old Salter&#x27;s road that runs from Shafton Two Gates via the North Field of Cudworth (Weetshaw Lane) through to Carlton where it continued towards Smithies and eventually up through Penistone to the Salter&#x27;s Brook Bridge which marked the ancient boundary between Yorkshire and Cheshire at Longdendale (these days the boundary is between the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley and Derbyshire). This was an ancient packhorse route.

Today, Outwood Academy Shafton is located in Shafton.

<doc id="694254" wikidata="Q1617071" url="?curid=694254" title="Royston, South Yorkshire">
<text>Royston is a suburban village within the Metropolitan borough of Barnsley, in South Yorkshire, England. Historically, the village formed part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, but was incorporated into the Metropolitan borough of Barnsley in 1974 and is now on the border with West Yorkshire.
It is part of the Barnsley Central borough constituency, and has a population of 10,728. It is situated north-east of Barnsley, and south-east of Wakefield.

== History ==
The village is recorded in the Domesday Book as &quot;Rorestone&quot; with the name deriving from &quot;Hror&#x27;s&quot; or &quot;Roarr&#x27;s&quot; farm /settlement (&quot;Hror/Roarr-s-tun&quot;). The village was in the wapentake of Staincross.

Originally a farming village, Royston joined the Industrial Revolution with the construction in the 1790s of the Barnsley Canal, and later a branch of the Midland Railway. Both are now disused.

Royston had a colliery called Monckton Colliery (1878–1966).This was replaced by Royston Drift Mine. There was also, a clay works and brick works but these are all now closed, although a coke works operated until recently on the mine site processing coal brought in by road. Royston Drift Mine opened in 1975 and closed (after a relatively short period in coal mining terms) 14 years later in 1989. The site is now the site of Rabbit Ings Country Park, which is now home to all five species of owls to be found in Britain.

A large shirt factory with the brandname &quot;Valusta&quot; provided local employment from the 1940s through to the 1980s.
Burberrys also had a factory on Midland Road

== Geography ==
Royston lies on the Barnsley Canal, and on the intersection of the B6132 and B6428 roads, due north of Monk Bretton at an elevation of around above sea level. The Trans Pennine Trail runs through Royston along the canal bank. The parish is part of the diocese of Leeds.

== Landmarks ==
The churches in Royston include the Anglican parish church of St John the Baptist, Bethel Church, the Royston Methodist Church, and Our Lady and St Joseph, a Roman Catholic church.

The parish church of St John the Baptist was built about the year 1234 and has a clock, a sundial, a ring of eight bells and is now grade I listed. The church is a notable location in Royston as it is one of a few churches in England with an oriel window, and was used a navigational landmark for guiding travellers.

== Notable people ==
Harry “Shake” Earnshaw was a miner turned racing cyclist who in 1938 was acclaimed the British Best All-Rounder. The comedian Charlie Williams was born in Royston in 1927. He played football for Doncaster Rovers and later found fame as one of the comedians on the TV programme &quot;The Comedians&quot;.

The mountaineer Andy Cave originates from Royston, and was a coal miner until the 1984–85 miners&#x27; strike, at which point he dedicated himself to mountaineering. He is also notable for his research into the dialect of Yorkshire pit villages. His 2001 doctorate stated that Royston had a slightly different accent to the surrounding villages, as many of the miners who came to work at Monckton Colliery on its opening travelled from the Black Country, where several mines had closed. This hypothesis was later tested by Kate Burland, who analysed certain vowel sounds in Royston, Wakefield and Barnsley. She found that Wakefield and Barnsley residents had very similar pronunciations for the sounds under consideration, whereas Royston residents had different pronunciations that were more similar to those associated with the Midlands.
Yorkshire cricketer Norman Yardley lived in Royston at the Grove, which is now owned by Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council.

Football player and manager Ernie Morgan was born in Royston.

<text>The Volvo XC60 is a compact luxury crossover SUV manufactured and marketed by Swedish automaker Volvo Cars since 2008.

The XC60 is part of Volvo&#x27;s 60 Series of automobiles, along with the S60, S60 Cross Country, V60, and V60 Cross Country. The first generation model introduced a new style for the 60 Series models. Along with the rest of the line-up, the first-generation XC60 was refreshed in 2013. Similarly, the second-generation model, released in 2017, is the first in the series. The car was named Car of the Year Japan for 2017–2018.

==XC60 concept (2007)==
The XC60 concept was unveiled at the 2007 Detroit Auto Show. It included a glass roof and a newly styled grille. The model introduced Volvo&#x27;s new styling cues, which were gradually implemented throughout the model range. The XC60 concept also included a new shifting mechanism, electronic bootlid, and 20-inch wheels.


== First generation (2008–2016)==
The production vehicle was unveiled at the 2008 Geneva Motor Show. Sales began in Europe in the third quarter of 2008 and in North America in early 2009 as a 2010 model. The XC60 has been Volvo&#x27;s best selling car since 2009.

Manufactured by subsidiary Volvo Car Gent in Ghent, Belgium, the first generation XC60 is based on Volvo&#x27;s P3 platform and the XC60 shares technology with the Land Rover Freelander of 2007. At the time of development, both Land Rover and Volvo were owned by Ford and development was split between the two subsidiaries. Much of the engineering and tuning of the crossover was done by Volvo in Sweden, although offroad capabilities were developed at Land Rover in England.

In April 2010, an R-Design variant of the XC60 became available, featuring a colour-matching body kit, stiffer chassis and damping, and other unique exterior/interior trim.

In February 2013, Volvo debuted a refreshed version of the XC60, to be released for the 2014 model year. Exterior updates are primarily cosmetic, with changes to the grille and front driving lights, loss of black cladding along the lower doorsills, and minor changes to the exhaust tips and taillights. Interior updates include new materials and dashboard trims, available paddle shifter on the T6 model, and introduction of a 7&quot; display.

===XC60 Plug-in Hybrid Concept===

The Volvo XC60 plug-in hybrid concept was unveiled at the 2012 North American International Auto Show. The powertrain mated a turbocharged 4-cylinder driving the front wheels with a electric motor driving the rear wheels, giving the powertrain a peak combined output of . According to Volvo, the XC60 Plug-in Hybrid has an all-electric range of up to for a fuel economy equivalent of and a total range of . Fuel economy when running on the gasoline engine is estimated at . Recharging time is 3.5 hours from a 220 V outlet and 7.5 hours from a 110 V outlet. The model was never released for production.

===Safety===
The XC60 includes traditional Volvo safety features including a whiplash protection system, side impact protection system, roll stability control, dynamic stability and traction control, inflatable curtain airbags, hill descent control (AWD only), collision warning with brake support, active bi-xenon lights (optional on some models), and patented front, side, and rear structures. The XC60 also introduced a new technology feature that Volvo has named City safety. The system is described as a driver support system with the goal of preventing or mitigating vehicle-on-vehicle collisions below ; it does so through the use of a closing velocity sensor that helps determine whether a collision is likely. Depending on the speed, if a collision is likely, the Volvo&#x27;s computer system will either prepare the car to brake or automatically brake the vehicle to avoid or mitigate a rear-end collision.

In 2011, the Highway Loss Data Institute credited City Safety for 27% fewer property damage liability claims, 51% fewer bodily injury liability claims, and 22% fewer collision claims for the XC60 compared to other midsize luxury SUVs. The XC60 had fewer insurance claims compared to other Volvo models lacking the City Safety feature.

Euro NCAP evaluated the XC60 in 2008, awarding it 5 of 5 stars for adult occupant protection. The XC60 scored 16 of 16 points in the front test and 16 of 16 in the side test. The car received 2 of 2 points available in the pole test and an additional 3 points available for seat belt reminders. The XC60 received a total of 37 of 37 points and therefore five stars (33–37) in Euro NCAP&#x27;s evaluation. The XC60 was one of only three cars to receive 37 of 37 available points under Euro NCAP&#x27;s point based evaluation at the time.

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety awarded the Volvo XC60 their Top Safety Pick+ award. The XC60 was granted the IIHS&#x27;s highest rating of &quot;good&quot; in front, side, rear and roof strength tests and has Electronic Stability Control as standard equipment to receive the award.

===Marketing===
Volvo used the 2009 film &quot;The Twilight Saga: New Moon&quot; to promote the XC60, including an online contest to give away models identical to the one driven by lead character Edward Cullen.

== Second generation (2017–present)==
The second generation XC60 was unveiled at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show. The first −60 series model in its generation and the first since Volvo&#x27;s purchase by Geely, it is based on the same Scalable Product Architecture (SPA) platform as the S90, V90, and XC90. As part of Volvo&#x27;s move toward smaller engines, the new model uses only four-cylinder engines, in various configurations and states of tune, again shared with the −90 series models.

The car was facelifted on 2 March 2021, with the new version debuting alongside the Volvo C40. The engines remain the same 2.0 litre with petrol, diesel, or PHEV power. Like the XC40 Recharge Electric and the C40, the XC60 facelift also gains a new Android-powered infotainment system that&#x27;s been developed in collaboration with Google.

The 2024 Volvo XC60, which fell short of the Top Safety Pick+ award, received an “acceptable” rating in the updated side-impact test. The possible injuries recorded on the dummies that simulated the vehicle&#x27;s occupants, especially the driver and rear passenger, were the determining factor in this rating.

=== Mild hybrid ===
The XC60 was released with two mild hybrid variants in 2020, with both a petrol and diesel 2.0L variant available. They utilize an Integrated Starter Generator (ISG) and a KERS system In 2023, Volvo removed conventional engines as an option, meaning mild hybrids are the base engine option in the US.

=== Plug-in hybrid ===
The XC60 was released with a T8 plug-in hybrid variant that used the T6 engine combined with a 10.4 kWh battery (9.2 kWh usable) and an rear electric motor to produce . The EPA all-electric range is . For the 2020 model year, the battery size was increased to 11.6 kWh, which increased the EPA range to . For the 2021 model year, T8 models were renamed to &quot;Recharge&quot; models. 

For the 2022 model year, Volvo released an XC60 Recharge Extended Range. Battery size was increased to 18.7 kWh (14.8 kWh usable), increasing the all-electric range to . The rear electric motor was upgraded to a unit, increasing total power output to .

=== Markets ===

===Asia Markets===
Volvos sold in Indonesia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam are all imported from Malaysia&#x27;s Volvo factory in Shah Alam.

===Trim levels===
The XC60 is available in Core, Plus, and Ultimate as of 2023 name changes.

===Engines===


===Safety===
The XC60 earned the IIHS&#x27;s Top Safety Pick for 2018, 2019, 2020, 2023 and 2024, and earned Top Safety Pick+ for 2021 and 2022. 


==Sales==
The Volvo XC60 has been Volvo&#x27;s best selling car, with sales increasing every year since its release in 2008. The second generation XC60 (released in 2017) has continued to set new sales records.

<text>Hvolsvöllur () is a town in the south of Iceland about 106 km to the east of Reykjavík.

==Overview==
The name of the town literally translates to &quot;Hillfield&quot;. ( in the genitive case) is an archaic form of the modern Icelandic word , meaning &quot;hill&quot;, and means &quot;field&quot;. The name is derived from the name of the historic farm (, &quot;Stórólfur&#x27;s hill&quot;).

The town of Hvolsvöllur has a population of 1,108 inhabitants. Around 900 people live the wider municipality (surrounding rural area).

The Ring Road (Route 1) passes through the town. 30 km east of Hvolsvöllur is the recently constructed port of Landeyjahöfn, where the ferry to Vestmannaeyjar (Westman Islands) operates from. Hvolsvöllur is notable in that it is one of the only Icelandic towns which is not situated on the coast or by a river.

The town&#x27;s economy is largely based on the service and tourism industry. It is an important service point for travellers and the local rural population serving large part of southern Iceland, the next town being Vík, 80 km to the east. The largest single employer in the area is Sláturfélag Suðurlands (SS), which has a large meat processing plant in the town - it notably manufactures the Icelandic SS hot dog.

The town has one of the best kindergarten and primary schools in the country, as well as a sports centre housing an outdoor swimming pool. The town has a geothermal district heating system, operated since 1981 using a 95 °C geothermal borehole from Laugaland. The transmission pipe from the borehole to the town is 23 km long. The same system also serves Hella as well as the surrounding rural area and is currently owned by Orkuveita Reykjavíkur.

In 2010, the volcanic eruptions at Eyjafjallajökull caused evacuations in the surrounding area, with people being relocated to Hvolsvöllur, where Red Cross mass care centres had been set up.

=== Points of Interest ===
The area is the scene of a well-known saga of Iceland, Njál&#x27;s saga. Hvolsvöllur houses the LAVA Museum which focusus on Iceland&#x27;s volcanic and geological history.

 is a Protestant church in Hvolsvöllur. It was built in 1930 and can seat 120 people. The interior was painted in 1955. Above the altar there is a painting by Þórarin B. Þorláksson, an Icelandic painter, dating from 1914 which shows Jesus blessing the children.

At the centre of the town is a 45m tall telecommunications tower, erected in 1976 and operated by Míla. In 2022 the tower was fitted with Christmas lights, which were lit up during the winter, claiming to be the &#x27;tallest Christmas lights in Iceland&#x27;.





==Climate==
Similar to the rest of the southern coast of Iceland, Hvolsvöllur has a subpolar oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfc&quot;) with cool summers and cold winters, although relatively mild for its high latitude. Precipitation is abundant year round, with October usually seeing the most precipitation.

<doc id="694262" wikidata="Q4119220" url="?curid=694262" title="District of Aberconwy">
<text>The Borough of Aberconwy was a local government district with borough status from 1974 to 1996, being one of five districts in the county of Gwynedd, north-west Wales.

==History==
The borough was created on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972. It covered parts of nine former districts from the administrative counties of Caernarfonshire and Denbighshire, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Betws-y-Coed Urban District
*Conwy Municipal Borough
*Eglwysbach parish from Hiraethog Rural District‡
*Llanddoget parish from Hiraethog Rural District‡
*Llandudno Urban District
*Llanrwst Urban District‡
*Llanrwst Rural parish from Hiraethog Rural District‡
*Llanfairfechan Urban District
*Llansantffraid Glan Conway parish from Aled Rural District‡
*Nant Conwy Rural District
*Penmaenmawr Urban District
*Tir Ifan parish from Hiraethog Rural District‡
‡From Denbighshire (rest from Caernarfonshire)

The new district was named Aberconwy, meaning mouth of the River Conwy, with the same name being used in both Welsh and English.

Under the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, the previous two tier system of counties and districts was replaced with new principal areas (each designated either a &quot;county&quot; or a &quot;county borough&quot;), whose councils perform the functions previously divided between the county and district councils. The Aberconwy area merged with the neighbouring Colwyn district from the county of Clwyd to become a county borough which the government originally named &quot;Aberconwy and Colwyn&quot;. During the transition to the new system, the shadow authority requested a change of name from &quot;Aberconwy and Colwyn&quot; to &quot;Conwy&quot;. The government confirmed the change with effect from 2 April 1996, one day after the new council came into being.

The pre-1996 counties of Wales continued to be used for some ceremonial purposes such as lieutenancy, being called preserved counties. The new Conwy County Borough therefore initially straddled the preserved counties of Gwynedd and Clwyd. In 2003 the area of the former Aberconwy district was moved from the preserved county of Gwynedd to Clwyd, uniting Conwy County Borough within the preserved county Clwyd.

==Political control==
The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council from 1974 until its abolition in 1996 was as follows:
==Premises==
The council was based at Bodlondeb, a large house built in 1877 on Bangor Road in Conwy, which had served as the main offices of the old Conwy Borough Council since 1937. The council also maintained additional offices at Llandudno Town Hall, which had been built in 1902 for the former Llandudno Urban District Council. After Aberconwy&#x27;s abolition in 1996, Bodlondeb became the headquarters of the replacement Conwy County Borough Council.

<doc id="694264" wikidata="Q288235" url="?curid=694264" title="Tom Horn">
<text>Thomas Horn Jr., (November 21, 1860 – November 20, 1903) was an American scout, cowboy, soldier, range detective, and Pinkerton agent in the 19th-century and early 20th-century American Old West. Believed to have committed 17 killings as a hired gunman throughout the West, Horn was convicted in 1902 of the murder of 14-year-old Willie Nickell near Iron Mountain, Wyoming. Willie was the son of sheep rancher Kels Nickell, who had been involved in a range feud with neighbor and cattle rancher Jim Miller. On the day before his 43rd birthday, Horn was executed by hanging in Cheyenne, Wyoming.

While in jail, he wrote his autobiography, &quot;Life of Tom Horn: Government Scout and Interpreter&quot;, which was published posthumously in 1904. Numerous editions have been published in the late 20th century. Horn has since become a larger-than-life figure of western folklore, and debate continues as to whether he was actually guilty of Nickell&#x27;s murder.

==Early life==
Thomas Horn Jr., known as &quot;Tom&quot;, was born in 1860 to Thomas S. Horn Sr. and Mary Ann Maricha (née Miller) on their family farm in rural northeastern Scotland County, Missouri. The family owned 600 acres bisected by the South Wyaconda River between the towns of Granger and Etna. Tom was the fifth of 12 children. During his childhood, he suffered physical abuse from his father, and his only companion as a child was a dog named Shedrick. The young Tom later got into a fight with two boys, who beat him and killed the dog with a shotgun.

==Scout==

At 16, Horn headed to the American Southwest, where he was hired by the U.S. Cavalry as a civilian scout, packer, and interpreter under Al Sieber during the Apache Wars. Horn was respected for his work with the army and soon rose through the ranks. In one instance, as the army was crossing Cibecue Creek in Arizona, they were ambushed by Apache warriors positioned on high ground. The officer in charge of their squad, Captain Edmund Hentig, was instantly killed, and the men became pinned down under overwhelming fire. Desperate, Sieber ordered Horn and another scout, Mickey Free, to break away and return fire from a hill. Together with the soldiers, the men managed to repel the attack. Horn and Sieber also participated in the Battle of Big Dry Wash and gained recognition when he and Lt. George H. Morgan slipped through the banks opposite the Apache line and provided covering fire for the cavalry killing a number of Apache warriors.

Horn was a respected scout by then, known for going out alone in reconnaissance missions and helping track down Geronimo&#x27;s major stronghold. By November 1885, Tom Horn earned the position of chief of scouts under Captain Emmet Crawford in Fort Bowie. During one operation, Horn&#x27;s camp was mistakenly attacked by a Mexican militia, and he was wounded in the arm during the shootout, which also resulted in Crawford&#x27;s death. Finally, on September 4, 1886, Horn was present at Geronimo&#x27;s final surrender and acted as an interpreter under Charles B. Gatewood.

Horn allegedly killed his first man, a second lieutenant in the Mexican Army, in a duel, the result of a dispute over a prostitute.

After the war, Horn used what he earned to build his own ranch in his return to Aravaipa Canyon in Arizona. His ranch consisted of 100 cattle and 26 horses, and he also laid claim in the Deer Creek Mining District near the canyon. However, it was short-lived, as cattle thieves stormed his ranch one night and stole all his stock, resulting in a tremendous loss and bankruptcy for Horn. This incident marked the start of Horn&#x27;s hatred and disdain for thieves, which led to his entering the profession of range detective.

== Detective, lawman, and gun for hire ==
Horn wandered and took jobs as a prospector, ranch hand, and rodeo contestant, but he is most notorious for being hired by numerous cattle companies as a cowboy and hired gun to watch over their cattle and kill any suspected rustlers. Horn developed his own means to fight thieves: &quot;I would simply take the calf and such things as that stopped the stealing. I had more faith in getting the calf than in courts&quot;. If he thought a man was guilty of stealing cattle and had been fairly warned, Horn said that he would shoot the thief and would not feel &quot;one shred of remorse&quot;.

Horn often gave a warning first to those he suspected of rustling and was said to have been a &quot;tremendous presence&quot; whenever he was in the vicinity. Fergie Mitchell, a rancher on the North Laramie River, described Horn&#x27;s reputation: &quot;I saw him ride by. He didn&#x27;t stop, but went straight on up the creek in plain sight of everyone. All he wanted was to be seen, as his reputation was so great that his presence in a community had the desired effect. Within a week, three settlers in the neighborhood sold their holdings and moved out. That was the end of cattle rustling on the North Laramie&quot;.

Later, Horn took part in the Pleasant Valley War between cattlemen and sheepmen in Arizona. Historians have not established for which side he worked, and both sides suffered several killings for which no known suspects were ever identified. Horn worked on a ranch owned by Robert Bowen, where he became one of the prime suspects in the disappearance of Mart Blevins in 1887. He claimed that throughout the war he was the &quot;mediator&quot; of the conflict, serving as a deputy sheriff under three famous Arizona lawmen: Buckey O&#x27;Neill, Perry Owens, and Glenn Reynolds. Horn also participated with Reynolds in the lynching of three suspected rustlers in August 1888. As a deputy sheriff, Horn drew the attention of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency owing to his tracking abilities. Hired by the agency in late 1889 or early 1890, he handled investigations in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, Wyoming, and other western states, working out of the Denver office. He became known for his calm-under-pressure demeanor and his ability to track down anyone assigned to him.

In one case, Horn and another agent, C.W. Shores, captured two men who had robbed the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad on August 31, 1890, between Cotopaxi and Texas Creek in Fremont County, Colorado. Horn and Shores tracked and arrested Thomas Eskridge—also known as &quot;Peg-Leg&quot; Watson—and Burt &quot;Red&quot; Curtis without firing a shot. They tracked them all the way to the home of a man named Wolfe, said to be in either Washita or Pauls Valley, Oklahoma, along the Washita River. In his report on that arrest, Horn stated in part, &quot;Watson was considered by everyone in Colorado as a very desperate character. I had no trouble with him&quot;.

During the Johnson County War, Horn worked for the Wyoming Stock Growers Association and for the Pinkertons, who had assigned him to work undercover in the county using the alias Tom Hale. He is alleged to have been involved in the killing of Nate Champion and Nick Ray on April 9, 1892, and was a prime suspect in the killings of ranchers John A. Tisdale and Orley &quot;Ranger&quot; Jones. The Pinkerton Agency forced Horn to resign in 1894. In his memoir, &quot;Two Evil Isms: Pinkertonism and Anarchism&quot;, Pinkerton detective Charlie Siringo wrote, &quot;William A. Pinkerton told me that Tom Horn was guilty of the crime, but that his people could not allow him to go to prison while in their employ&quot;. Siringo later indicated that he respected Horn&#x27;s abilities at tracking, and that he was a very talented agent but had a wicked element.

In 1895, Horn reportedly killed a known cattle thief named William Lewis near Iron Mountain, Wyoming. Horn was exonerated for that crime and for the 1895 murder of Fred Powell six weeks later. In 1896, a ranchman named Campbell, known to have a large stash of cash, was last seen with Horn. In 1896, Horn offered his service in a letter to the marshal of Tucson, Arizona, in getting rid of William Christian&#x27;s rustler gang. William was killed by an unknown assailant in 1897, and his associate Robert Christian disappeared the same year.

=== Colorado Range War ===

Although his official title was &quot;range detective&quot;, Horn essentially served as a killer for hire. By the mid-1890s, the cattle business in Wyoming and Colorado was changing due to the arrival of homesteaders and new ranchers. The homesteaders, referred to as &quot;nesters&quot; or &quot;grangers&quot; by the big operators, had moved into the territory in large numbers. By doing so, they decreased the availability of water and graze for the larger herds of the cattle barons. Soon, efforts were made to get rid of these homesteaders, including the hiring of gunmen like Horn. Violent gunfights such as the bloody shootout that resulted in the death of nine trappers in Big Dry Creek (Littleton, Colorado), as well as the lynching and burning of homesteaders Luther M. Mitchell and Ami W. Ketchum, precipitated the Colorado Range War.

By 1900, Horn began working for the Swan Land and Cattle Company in northwest Colorado. His first job was to investigate the Browns Park Cattle Association&#x27;s leader, a cowboy named Matt Rash, who was suspected of cattle rustling. Horn went undercover as &quot;Tom Hicks&quot; and worked for Rash as a ranch hand while also collecting evidence Rash was branding cattle that did not belong to him. When Horn finally pieced together enough evidence to determine that Rash was indeed a rustler, he put a threatening letter on Rash&#x27;s door saying that he must leave in 60 days. Rash, however, defiantly stayed and continued working on his ranch. As Rash continued to be uncooperative, Horn&#x27;s employers were said to have given him the &quot;go-ahead signal&quot; to execute Rash. On the day of the murder, an armed Horn allegedly arrived at Rash&#x27;s cabin just as he finished eating and shot him at point-blank range. The dying Rash unsuccessfully tried to write the name of his killer, but no trace was left of the murder. Only the accounts and rumors from various people point to Horn as the one responsible. Rash was supposed to be married to a nearby rancher, Ann Bassett, and the woman accused &quot;Hicks&quot; of being the murderer.Around the same time, Horn also suspected another cowboy named Isom Dart of rustling. Dart was one of Rash&#x27;s fellow cowboys but was believed to have previously worked as a rustler named Ned Huddleston and to have been a former member of the late &quot;Tip Gault&quot; gang. The gang, which had rustled cattle up in the Saratoga, Wyoming, area, had been wiped out in a gun battle. Dart also had three indictments returned against him in Sweetwater County. When Dart was accused of murdering Rash, he took refuge inside his friend&#x27;s cabin and waited for the rumors to cool down. Horn, however, managed to track Dart to his cabin and saw him hiding together with two other armed associates.

The assassin was said to have set up a sniping position overlooking the cabin from a hill, under cover of a pine tree. As Dart and his friends came out of the cabin, Horn shot him in the chest from a distance. Prior to the assassination, Horn had instructed a rancher named Robert Hudler to ready a horse miles from the murder scene for his getaway. The next day, two spent .30-30 Winchester shell casings were found at the base of a tree where the murderer is believed to have lain in wait. &quot;Hicks&quot; was said to have been the only one in the area to use a .30–30. The news of Rash and Dart&#x27;s deaths spread throughout the territory, causing the other rustlers to scatter in fear. Horn tracked them all down and killed three other members of Rash&#x27;s association. The story goes that he pinned one of the dead cowboys&#x27; ears for the homesteaders to see as a warning.

=== Government employment ===
During the Wilcox train robbery investigation, Horn obtained information from Bill Speck that revealed which of the outlaws, George Curry or Harvey Logan, had killed Sheriff Josiah Hazen during their escape. Both were members of Butch Cassidy&#x27;s Wild Bunch, then known as the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang, so named after their hideaway in the mountains. Horn passed this information on to Charlie Siringo, who was working the case for the Pinkertons.

Horn briefly entered the United States Army to serve during the Spanish–American War as the chief packer of the Fifth Corps. He left Tampa for Cuba, where he led some of the pack trains to the front. Horn personally witnessed the bravery of the famous Rough Riders and colored regiments, the Ninth and Tenth Cavalries, during their assault on San Juan Hill, as well as the humiliating rout of American soldiers under Brigadier General Hamilton S. Hawkins. Although the packers were noncombatants, they were still prone to attack by Cuban rebels. Horn considered himself lucky to have lost no packer during the war, although Horn recalled that his men and he were under constant fire as they delivered rations and ammunition to the soldiers.

Horn continued working as a packer during the war, though he and many of his men contracted yellow fever. At one point, he was bedridden and was deemed unfit for combat. Upon recovering, he returned to Wyoming. Shortly after his return, Horn began working in 1901 for wealthy cattle baron John C. Coble, who belonged to the Wyoming Stock Men&#x27;s Association.

=== Murder of Willie Nickell ===
While working again near Iron Mountain, Wyoming, on July 15, 1901, Horn visited the Jim and Dora Miller family, who were cattle ranchers. Jim Miller was no relation to Texas outlaw Jim Miller. Jim Miller and his neighbor Kels Nickell had already had several disputes following Nickell&#x27;s introduction of sheep into the Iron Mountain area. Miller frequently accused Nickell of letting his sheep graze on Miller&#x27;s land. At the Millers, Horn met Glendolene M. Kimmell, the young teacher at the Iron Mountain School. Ms. Kimmell was supported by both the large Miller and Kels Nickell families, and she boarded with the Millers. Horn entertained her with accounts of his adventures. That day some males of the Miller family and he went fishing; Victor Miller, a son about his age, and he also practiced shooting, both of them with .30-30s.

The Miller and Nickell families were the only ones to have children at the school. Before she arrived, Kimmell had been advised of the families&#x27; ongoing feud and found that it was often played out by conflict among the children. A few days later, on July 18, Willie Nickell, the 14-year-old son of sheep ranchers Kels and Mary Nickell, was found murdered near their homestead gate. A coroner&#x27;s inquest began to investigate the murder. More violent incidents occurred during the period of the coroner&#x27;s inquest, which was expanded to investigate these incidents and lasted from July through September 1901.

On August 4, Kels Nickell was shot and wounded. Some 60–80 of his sheep were found &quot;shot or clubbed to death&quot;. Two of the younger Nickell children later reported seeing two men leaving on horses, one a bay and one gray, as were horses owned by Jim Miller. On August 6, Deputy Sheriff Peter Warlaumont and Deputy U.S. Marshal Joe LeFors came to Iron Mountain and arrested Jim Miller and his sons Victor and Gus on suspicion of shooting Kels Nickell. They were jailed on August 7 and released the following day on bond. The investigation of the shooting of Kels Nickell was added to the investigation of Willie Nickell&#x27;s murder in the coroner&#x27;s inquest.

Deputy Marshal Joe Lefors later questioned Horn in January 1902 about the murder while supposedly talking to him about employment. Horn was still inebriated from the night before, but Lefors gained what he called a confession to the murder of Willie Nickell. Horn allegedly confessed to killing young Willie with his rifle from , which he boasted of as the &quot;best shot that [he] ever made and the dirtiest trick that [he] had ever done&quot;. Horn was arrested the next day by the county sheriff. Walter Stoll was the Laramie County prosecutor in the case. Judge Richard H. Scott, who presided over the case, was running for re-election.

Horn was supported by his longtime friend and employer, cattle rancher John C. Coble. He gathered a team for the defense headed by former Judge John W. Lacey, and which included attorneys T. F. Burke, Roderick N. Matson, Edward T. Clark, and T. Blake Kennedy. Reportedly, Coble paid for most of the costs of this large team. According to Johan P. Bakker, who wrote &quot;Tracking Tom Horn&quot;, the large cattle interests by this time found Horn &quot;expendable&quot;, and the case provided a way to silence him in regard to their activities. He wrote that 100 members of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association paid $1000 each toward the defense, but wanted a minimal effort.

Horn&#x27;s trial started October 10, 1902, in Cheyenne, which filled with crowds attracted by the notoriety of Horn. The &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot; noted the carnival atmosphere and great interest from the public for a conviction. The prosecution introduced Horn&#x27;s confession to Lefors. Only certain parts of Horn&#x27;s statement were introduced, distorting his statement. The prosecution introduced testimony by at least two witnesses, including Lefors, as well as circumstantial evidence; these elements only placed Horn in the general vicinity of the crime scene. During the trial, Victor Miller testified that Horn and he both had .30-30 guns and bought their ammunition at the same store. Another, Otto Plaga, testified that Horn was from the scene of the murder an hour after it was committed; however, prosecuting attorney Walter Stoll was able to lead Horn into boasting on the stand that he could have ridden that distance in an hour, undermining his alibi.

Glendolene Kimmell had testified during the coroner&#x27;s inquest, saying she thought both the Miller and Nickell families responsible for maintaining the feud, but she was never called as a defense witness. She had resigned from the school in October 1901, and left the area, but was in communication with people in the case. Horn&#x27;s trial went to the jury on October 23, and they returned a guilty verdict the next day. A hearing several days later sentenced Horn to death by hanging. Horn&#x27;s attorneys filed a petition with the Wyoming Supreme Court for a new trial. While in jail, Horn wrote his autobiography, &quot;Life of Tom Horn, Government Scout and Interpreter, Written by Himself&quot;, mostly giving an account of his early life. It contained little about the case.

The Wyoming Supreme Court upheld the decision of the District Court and denied a new trial. Convinced of Horn&#x27;s innocence, Glendolene Kimmell sent an affidavit to Governor Fenimore Chatterton with testimony reportedly saying that Victor Miller was guilty of Nickell&#x27;s murder. Accounts of its contents appeared in the press, but the original document has since disappeared. The governor chose not to intervene in the case. Horn was initially given an execution date of November 20, 1903.

==Execution==
Tom Horn was one of the few people in the &quot;Wild West&quot; to have been hanged by a water-powered gallows, known as the &quot;Julian&quot; gallows. James P. Julian, a Cheyenne, Wyoming, architect, designed the contraption in 1892. The trap door was connected to a lever that pulled the plug out of a barrel of water. This would cause a lever with a counterweight to rise, withdrawing a support and opening the trap.

Horn was hanged in Cheyenne. At that time, Horn never gave up the names of those who had hired him during the feud. He was buried in the Columbia Cemetery in Boulder, Colorado, on December 3, 1903. Rancher Jim Coble paid for his coffin and a stone to mark his grave. After his death, many considered Horn to have been wrongly executed for a murder solely based on a purported confession given when drunk, thus of dubious admissibility in court. Even the old Apache warrior, Geronimo, expressed his doubts about Horn&#x27;s charges during an interview with Charles Ackenhausen, saying that he &quot;did not believe [Horn] guilty&quot;.

==Debate==
The debate over Horn&#x27;s guilt remains as divided to this day. The consensus is that regardless of whether Horn committed that particular murder, he had certainly committed many others—a concession to probability, but not an affirmation of guilt.

Author Chip Carlson of Cheyenne, Wyoming, who extensively researched the &quot;Wyoming v. Tom Horn&quot; trial, concluded that although Horn &quot;could have&quot; committed the murder of Willie Nickell, he probably did not. According to his book, &quot;Tom Horn: Blood on the Moon&quot; (2001), no physical evidence showed that Horn had committed the murder. In addition, he was last seen in the area the day before it occurred, and the conditions of his alleged confession rendered it valueless as evidence. Carlson believed the prosecution made no efforts to investigate other possible suspects, including Victor Miller. In essence, Horn&#x27;s reputation and history made him an easy target for the prosecution.

The case was retried in a mock trial in 1993 in Cheyenne, and Horn was acquitted.

Writer Dean Fenton Krakel believed that Horn was guilty, but that he had not realized he was shooting a boy.

In 2014, former professor of history at Arkansas State University Larry Ball published &quot;Tom Horn in Life and Legend&quot;, asserting the opinion that Horn was responsible for the murder. Ball maintains that he found no evidence of a legal conspiracy against Horn, arguing that Horn&#x27;s penchant for brutality contributed to his being convicted of the crime.

<doc id="694265" wikidata="Q7597009" url="?curid=694265" title="Staincross">
<text>Staincross is a village in South Yorkshire, England, on the border with West Yorkshire. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it formed part of the defunct Barnsley West and Penistone borough constituency, following the Boundary Commission for England&#x27;s report on South Yorkshire&#x27;s Parliamentary constituencies in 2004 and the subsequent inquiry in 2005, it is now part of the Barnsley Central borough constituency. The population now falls within the Darton East ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley. The village also gave its name to the Staincross wapentake in the West Riding of Yorkshire. It is situated about from Barnsley, and from Wakefield.

==Geography==
Staincross lies off the A61 road, about three miles north-west of Barnsley. It is located at approximately , and at an elevation of around 410 feet (125 m) above sea level. The section of the A61 between Staincross and Newmillerdam is rated in the top three most dangerous roads in Britain according to a survey conducted by The AA Motoring Trust.

==History==
The name is believed to be derived from a Saxon stone cross (&#x27;stane cross&#x27;) that until the 18th century occupied a position on the junction of Staincross Common - which in itself is an ancient trackway - and Greenside. The stone, now lost, may have been the remains of a rural shrine.
Alternatively, those remains may have been from a typical wapentake meeting cross, now partially reconstructed in Cawthorne parish church grounds a short distance from Ailric&#x27;s local power base.

==Postal recognition==
After a prolonged campaign (backed by former Test cricket umpire, Dickie Bird, a resident of Staincross), a ballot was held in January 2003 to determine whether the residents of Staincross wanted their mail to include the name of the village. Before the ballot, Staincross mail bore the name of a neighbouring village, either Mapplewell or Darton. Indeed, it is unclear where the boundaries between the three villages lie. Villagers voted overwhelmingly in favour of the proposal by 966 to 199 and Royal Mail implemented changes to officially recognise the village.

The council was based at Llanion Park at Pembroke Dock. The building had been built in 1904 as part of the Llanion Barracks, and had been acquired by the former Pembroke Borough Council in the early 1970s to serve as its headquarters, just a couple of years before that council&#x27;s abolition.

==Abolition==
It was abolished on 1 April 1996, merging with its neighbouring district of Preseli Pembrokeshire to form a reconstituted Pembrokeshire unitary authority. The council&#x27;s old offices at Llanion Park were used by the new council until the new County Hall at Haverfordwest opened in 1999. The building at Llanion Park is now the headquarters of the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority.

==Political control==
The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Throughout the council&#x27;s existence a majority of the seats were held by independent councillors.

==Elections==
* 1973 South Pembrokeshire District Council election
* 1976 South Pembrokeshire District Council election
* 1979 South Pembrokeshire District Council election
* 1983 South Pembrokeshire District Council election
* 1987 South Pembrokeshire District Council election
* 1991 South Pembrokeshire District Council election

<doc id="694273" wikidata="Q244095" url="?curid=694273" title="Bellagio, Lombardy">
<text>Bellagio (; ) is a &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) in the Province of Como in the Italian region of Lombardy. It is located on Lake Como, also known by its Latin-derived name &quot;Lario&quot;, whose arms form an inverted Y. The triangular land mass at the base of the inverted Y is the Larian Triangle: at its northern point sits Bellagio, looking across to the northern arm of the lake and, behind it, the Alps. It has always been famous for its location. It belongs to a mountain community named &quot;Comunità montana del Triangolo lariano&quot; (Larian Triangle mountain community), based in Canzo.

Bellagio is part of the Central Lake Como area, which, together with Lierna, Varenna, Fiumelatte, Cadenabbia, Menaggio, and Tremezzina, is the most exclusive area of Lake Como, with lake-view villa prices exceeding 100 million euros in value. However, purchasing one is almost impossible, as no one sells them, making them a global status symbol.

== History ==
=== Before the Romans ===
Even though there are signs of a human presence around Bellagio in the Paleolithic Period (about 30,000 years ago), it is only in the 7th to 5th centuries BC that there appears to be a &quot;castellum&quot; on the promontory, perhaps a place of worship and of exchange which served the numerous small villages on the lake.

The first identifiable inhabitants of the territory of Bellagio, from 400BC, were the Insubres, a Celtic tribe in part of Lombardy and on Lake Como up to the centre of the lake, occupying the western shore (the Orobii had the northern arm of the lake and its east bank). The Insubres lived free and independently until the arrival of the Gauls, led by Belloveso, who, around the year 600 BC, undid the Insubres and settled in Milan and Como, occupying the shores of the lake and creating a garrison at the extreme point of their conquest, Bellagio (fancifully Bellasium, named after their commander Belloveso). The Gauls thus became Gallo-Insubres, merged with the primitive inhabitants and introduced their customs and traditions, leaving traces in local names: Crux Galli (now Grosgalla), on the side of Lezzeno, and Gallo, a small chapel on the old road of Limonta which marks today the border between the two municipalities.

===The Romans===
In 225 BC, the territory of the Gallo-Insubres was occupied by the Romans, in their gradual expansion to the north. The Romans, led by consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus, defeated the Gallo-Insubres in a fierce battle near Camerlata, occupying Como and the shores of the lake. Insubre hopes of independence were raised by an alliance with Hannibal during the Second Punic War, but dashed by defeat in 104 BC and absorption into a Roman province in 80 BC.

Bellagio became both a Roman garrison and a point of passage and wintering for the Roman armies on their way through to the province of Raetia and the Splügen pass. Troops wintered at the foot of the present Villa Serbelloni, sheltered from north winds and the Mediterranean climate. Such variant Latin names as Belacius and Bislacus suggest Bellagio was originally Bi-lacus (&quot;between the lakes&quot;).

Between 81 and 77 BC Cornelius Scipio brought 3,000 Latin colonists to Lake Como. From 59 BC Julius Caesar, as pro-consul, brought up another 5000 colonists, most importantly 500 Greeks from Sicily. Their names are still borne by their descendants. Bellagio became a mixture of races which became more and more complex in the following centuries. Also it increased its strategic importance because, as well as a place for wintering, it sheltered warships especially at Loppia, where the natural creek made it easy to repair them. Around Loppia there formed one of the first suburbs of Bellagio.

The Romans introduced many Mediterranean crops, including the olive and bay laurel; from the name of the latter (Laurus) derives the Latin name of Lake Como (Larius). Among the other plant species introduced were the chestnut, already widespread in southern Italy, the cypress, so well naturalised today as to be considered native, and many kinds of herbaceous plants.

In the early decades of the Empire, two great figures brought fame to the lake and Bellagio: Virgil and Pliny the Younger. Virgil, the Latin poet, visited Bellagio and remembered the lake in the second book of the &quot;Georgics&quot;, verse 155 (&quot;or great Lario&quot;). Pliny the Younger, resident in Como for most of the year, had, among others, a summer villa near the top of the hill of Bellagio; it was known as &quot;Tragedy&quot;. Pliny describes in a letter the long periods he spent in his Bellagio villas, not only studying and writing but also hunting and fishing.

Through Bellagio passed, in 9 AD, the Roman legions (partly composed of soldiers from the Bellagio garrison) led by Publius Quinctilius Varus, which had to cross the Splügen pass into Germany against Arminius. They were annihilated in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest.

=== The Middle Ages ===
At the time of the barbarian invasions, Narses, a general of Justinian, in his long wanderings through Italy waging war, created along Lake Como a fortified line against the Goths. The line included the fortress of Bellagio, the Isola Comacina and the Castel Baradello.

Nevertheless, around 568 the Lombards, led by Alboin, poured into the Po Valley and settled in various parts of Lombardy, in the valleys of the Alps and along the lakes. Even the fortress of Bellagio was occupied. In 744 King Liutprand settled there.

With their arrival in Italy, the Franks of Charlemagne descended on Piedmont and Lombardy and, through the high Alps, defeated the Lombards in the battle of Pavia of 773. The Lombard territory was divided into counties — thus the beginning of feudalism. Bellagio found itself in the county of Milan under the suzerainty of the Frankish kings.

The grandson of Charlemagne, Lothair, having deposed his father in 834, invested as feudal lords of the territory of Limonta and Civenna the monks of Saint Ambrose of Milan (together with the territory of Campione d&#x27;Italia). The inhabitants of these two places, which later belonged ecclesiastically to the parish of Bellagio (St. John), were obliged to hand over some of their produce (olive oil, chestnuts ...) to the monks, an obligation preserved for several centuries.

There followed the rule of the Ottonian dynasty of Germany. During the reign of Henry V began a long war over the succession to the bishop of Como between Milan, supporting a bishop imposed by the German Emperor, and Como, which had already designated as bishop Guido Grimoldi, consecrated by the Pope. The war lasted ten years (1117–1127), with a series of small victories and defeats on land and water. Bellagio participated with its fleet as an ally of Milan, Isola Comacina and Gravedona. The war ended with the destruction of Como and its subjection to Milan, from which it took decades to recover. It is thought that by 1100 Bellagio was already a free commune and seat of a tribunal and that its dependence on Como was merely formal. However the strategic position of Bellagio was very important for the city of Como, and Bellagio had therefore to suffer more than one incursion from Como and fought numerous naval battles against its neighbour. In 1154, under Frederick Barbarossa, Bellagio was forced to swear loyalty and pay tribute to Como.

In 1169, after the destruction of Milan by Frederick Barbarossa (1162), Como attacked Isola Comacina, devastating it and forcing the inhabitants to flee to Varenna and Bellagio, at that time considered impregnable fortresses. The Lombard League was formed, in which Bellagio also participated as an ally of Milan, intervening in the Battle of Legnano (1176) against Barbarossa and Como.

===The Renaissance and the Baroque===
Towards the end of the 13th century, Bellagio, which had participated in numerous wars on the side of the Ghibellines (the pro-empire party), became part of the property of the House of Visconti and was integrated into the Duchy of Milan.

In 1440, during the lordship of the Visconti, some Cernobbiesi attacked the prison of Bellagio in which the inmates were political prisoners. Liberated, they took flight into mountains of Bellagio, settling in a town that took the name of Cernobbio in memory of the country of origin of their liberators.

With the death of Filippo Maria, the House of Visconti lost power. For a short time the area was transformed into the Ambrosian Republic (1447–50), until Milan capitulated to Francesco Sforza, who became Duke of Milan and Lombardy. Bellagio, whose territory (and especially the fortress) was occupied by the troops of Sforza in 1449 during the war of succession, was one of the first towns on the lake to take sides and adhere to Sforza rule.

In 1508, under Ludovico il Moro (1479–1508), the estate of Bellagio was taken from the bishop of Como and assigned to the Marquis of Stanga, treasurer, ambassador and friend of il Moro. Stanga built a new villa on Bellagio hill, later ruined in a raid by Cavargnoni.

In 1535, when Francesco II Sforza (the last Duke of Milan) died, there started for Lombardy and the land around the Lake of Lario two centuries of Spanish rule (the period in which Alessandro Manzoni&#x27;s novel &quot;The Betrothed&quot; is set). The so-called Derta steps that lead from the neighbourhood of Guggiate to that of Suira were built under the Spanish.

In 1533, Francesco Sfondrati, married to a Visconti, had acquired the fiefdom of Bellagio and for more than 200 years the Sfondrati family, from the highest rank of Milanese society, ruled Bellagio. The ruins of the sumptuous Stanga building were restructured by Francesco and, successively, by Ercole Sfondrati, who spent the last years of his life in pious religious passion in the villa. On the same peninsula he built the church and convent of the Capuchins (1614), investing enormous capital in the setting, where appeared cypress trees and sweet olives.

Favoured by Bellagio&#x27;s ideal position for transport and trade, various small industries flourished, most notably candle-making and silk weaving with its concomitant silk worms and mulberry trees. With the death in 1788 of Carlo, last of the Sfondrati, Bellagio passed to Count Alessandro Serbelloni, henceforth Serbelloni Sfondrati.

===The 18th and 19th centuries ===

During the brief Napoleonic period, the port of Bellagio assumed military and strategic importance. A decision, apparently of secondary importance, was to guide the destiny of Bellagio for the two succeeding two centuries: the decision of Count Francesco Melzi d&#x27;Eril, Duke of Lodi and Vice President of the Cisalpine Republic to establish here his summer home. Count Melzi proceeded to build a villa on the west bank near Loppia. That brought to the area the flower of the Milanese nobility and the promontory was transformed into an elegant and refined court. Roads suitable for carriages were built, first of all to link the villas and the palaces and then towards the town centre; finally the provincial road Erba–Bellagio was completed. The fame of the lakeside town became well known outside the borders of the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia: even the Emperor Francis I of Austria visited in 1816 and returned in 1825 to stay in the Villas Serbelloni, Trotti and Melzi.

The Romantic discovery of landscape was changing how the Italian lakes were seen. Stendhal had first visited in 1810:

At Bellagio he was the guest of the Melzi d’Eril, from whose villa he wrote:

Franz Liszt and his mistress Comtesse Marie d&#x27;Agoult stayed for four months of 1837 on their way from Switzerland to Como and Milan. In Bellagio he wrote many of the piano pieces which became &quot;Album d&#x27;un voyageur (1835–38)&quot;, landscapes seen through the eyes of Byron and Senancour. These works contributed much to the image of Bellagio and the lake as a site of Romantic feeling. D&#x27;Agoult&#x27;s letters show they were sadly aware of drawing an age of motorised tourism in their train.

In 1838, Bellagio received with all honours the Emperor Ferdinand I, the Archduke Rainer and the Minister Metternich, who came from Varenna on the &quot;Lario&quot;, the first steamboat on the lake, launched in 1826. Bellagio was one of the localities most frequented by the Lombardy nobility and saw the construction of villas and gardens. Luxury shops opened in the village and tourists crowded onto the lakeshore drive. Space was not sufficient and it was decided to cover the old port which came up as far as the arcade in order to construct a large square.

Gustav Flaubert visited Bellagio in 1845. He told his travel diary:

===The Risorgimento===
In 1859, as part of the Second Italian War of Independence, Garibaldi&#x27;s Hunters of the Alps defeated Austrian troops at San Fermo, entering Como and bringing the province under Piedmontese rule. Bellagio thus became part of the Kingdom of Italy under the House of Savoy until Germany created in 1943 the puppet Italian Social Republic under Benito Mussolini.

Tourism in the Kingdom of Italy had now become the principal economic resource of the people of Bellagio and from this period on the history of Bellagio coincides with that of its hotels. The first was the present Hotel Metropole, founded in 1825 from the transformation of the old hostelry of Abbondio Genazzini into the first real hotel on the Lario, the Hotel Genazzini. Following this example in the space of a few years came several splendid hotels many of which are still operating, frequently in the hands of the same families who founded them: the Hotel Firenze, built on the old house of the captain of the &quot;Lario&quot; opened in 1852; the Grand Hotel Bellagio (now the Grand Hotel Villa Serbelloni) opened in 1872. In 1888 the three largest hotels (Genazzini, Grande Bretagne and Grand Hotel Bellagio) first replaced gaslight with electric, and only after this were they followed by many patrician houses. Bellagio was one of the first Italian tourist resorts to become international, but it has never degenerated into a place of mass tourism.

===The 20th century===
Bellagio was part of the Italian Social Republic (RSI) from 1943 to 1945. The Futurist writer and poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, a Mussolini loyalist who had helped shape Fascist philosophy, remained in the RSI as a propagandist until his death from a heart attack at Bellagio in December 1944.

Luchino Visconti put Bellagio in a scene of his film &quot;Rocco and His Brothers&quot; (1960). The scene is on the Europa Promenade, between the pier and the half-derelict Hotel Grande Bretagne. Rocco implies that the old hotels are fading along with the empires they served. The fact that working-class Rocco and his girlfriend are there to make the observation implies in turn the new world of mass tourism replacing them. Ironies lie beyond the scope of the film: the new American empire would find uses of its own for Bellagio. 

In 2014, Bellagio merged with the town of Civenna: the new municipality retains the name of Bellagio.

== Geography ==
Bellagio is situated upon the cape of the land mass that divides Lake Como in two. The city centre occupies the tip of the promontory, while other districts are scattered along the lake shores and up the slopes of the hills. The great Pleistocene glaciations with their imposing flows coming from the Valtellina and Valchiavenna modelled the actual landscape of Lake Como: at least four times the glaciers went as far as Brianza to the south. From the ancient glacial blanket only the highest tops emerged, one of them Mount St. Primo, which obliged the glaciers to divide into two arms.

Nowadays, a luxuriance of trees and flowers is favoured by a mild and sweet climate. The average daytime temperature during winter is rarely below , while during summer it is around , mitigated during the afternoon by the characteristic &quot;breva&quot;, the gentle breeze of Lake Como.

===The Borgo===
The historic centre of Bellagio is located 350 m southwest of the promontory of the Larian Triangle, between the Villa Serbelloni on the hill and the Como arm of the lake. At the far tip of the promontory are a park and a marina. Parallel to the shore are three streets, Mazzini, Centrale and Garibaldi in ascending order. Cutting across them to form a sloped grid are seven medieval stone stairs (&quot;salite&quot;) running uphill. The Basilica of San Giacomo and a stone tower, sole relic of medieval defences (&quot;Torre delle Arti Bellagio&quot;), sit in a piazza at the top.

==Buildings==
===Churches===
* , in the Piazza della Chiesa; Lombard-Romanesque 1075–1125. The base of the bell tower incorporates ancient town defences; the top is 18th century. Inside, a 12th-century cross, a 1432 triptych by Foppa, a 16th-century altarpiece. The Bar Sport across the square occupies a former monastery. 
* Church of San Giorgio, next to the town hall. The church was built 1080–1120. Inside, a statue and fresco of Our Lady of the Belt. The Genazzini Stairs run under the bell tower to the public library.
* Church of San Martino, in Visgnola;
* Church of Sant&#x27;Antonio Abate, in Casate;
* Church of San Carlo Borromeo, to Aureggio;
* Church of San Biagio, in Pescallo;
* Church of Sant&#x27;Andrea, in Guggiate.

===Villas===
Along the banks of the promontory of Bellagio are many old patrician houses, each surrounded by parks and gardens of trees. Some like Villa Serbelloni and Villa Melzi d&#x27;Eril are open to the public.

====Villa Serbelloni====
Just behind the hill of the promontory into the lake, protected from the winds, is the building complex of Villa Serbelloni. The villa dominates the town&#x27;s historic centre. It can be reached from Via Garibaldi. It was built in the 15th century in place of an old castle razed in 1375. Villa Serbelloni was later rebuilt several times. In 1788 it came into the possession of Alessandro Serbelloni (1745–1826) who enriched it with precious decorations and works of art of the 17th and 18th centuries. Today you can visit only the gardens. The trails, as well as the villa, lead to the remains of the 16th-century Capuchin monastery and the Sfondrata, a residence built by the Sfondrati family indeed, overlooking the Lecco branch of the lake.

Quite different is the Grand Hotel Villa Serbelloni on the water&#x27;s edge. A luxurious neo-classical villa built in the 1850s for an aristocratic Milanese family became the nucleus of the (then-called) Grand Hotel Bellagio, opened in 1873. The hotel retains its original Belle Époque fittings.

==== Villa Melzi d&#x27;Eril ====

This significant building overlooking the lake was built between 1808 and 1815 by the architect Giocondo Albertolli for Francesco Melzi d&#x27;Eril, created Duke of Lodi (the city of Lodi, Lombardy) by Napoleon for whom he filled the role of vice-president of the Italian Republic from 1802. From 1805, with the advent of the short-lived Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, he was its Chancellor.

Even after his political career had ended, since this was a Melzi residence, the construction, which he wanted as elegant as the Royal Villa of Monza and the other villas around Lake of Como, was decorated and furnished by famous artists of the period: painters Appiani and Bossi, sculptors Canova and Comolli, and the medalist Luigi Manfredini. The duke had a collector&#x27;s passion which, in the region on Lake Como, had no rival except that of Giovan Battista Sommariva, owner of the villa bearing the same name (nowadays Villa Carlotta) who, politically defeated by Melzi himself (preferred by Napoleon as vice-president), tried to regain lost prestige by assembling an extraordinary art collection.

Villa Melzi is set in English style gardens which develop harmoniously along the banks of the lake, the last reaches of the view from Bellagio towards the hills to the south. Making such a garden required notable changes to the structure of the land and outstanding supporting walls. In such surroundings, enriched by monuments, artefacts (amongst which are a Venetian gondola transported to Bellagio expressly for Napoleon, and two precious Egyptian statues), rare exotic plants, ancient trees, hedges of camellias, groves of azaleas and gigantic rhododendrons, the villa, the chapel and the glass house constitute an ensemble in which the neoclassical style reaches one of its highest peaks.

==Sport==
===Rowing===
Rowing is based at the Bellagina Sporting Union, a club specializing in football and especially rowing: world rowing champions Enrico Gandola, Alberto Belgeri, Igor Pescialli, Franco Sancassani and Daniele Gilardoni were born in Bellagio and began their racing careers with Bellagina.

===Cycling===
From Bellagio starts the climb to the Sanctuary of the Madonna del Ghisallo, the patron saint of cyclists, and therefore an important destination for fans of the sport. The ascent covers a total distance of about 4 km and has a vertical rise of about 500 meters; professional cyclists can do it in 20 minutes. You can also make the climb from Onno to Valbrona on the eastern shore of the lake, and the Wall of Sormano on the road to the western shore. These two climbs, with the ascent to the Sanctuary, are part of the Tris del Lario competition.

===Trekking===
Treks of all degrees of difficulty are possible around and above Bellagio on the Larian Triangle. &quot;Bellagio Lifestyle&quot; gives the major treks with maps and route descriptions.

==Cuisine==
The traditional Bellagino feast day dish is the . Eaten with a wooden spoon, it is composed of polenta mixed with butter and cheese and accompanied with dried fish from the lake, cold, stuffed chicken or home-made salami. Red wine is shared from a communal jug. For dessert, &quot;miasca&quot;—cake made with cornflour and dried fruit; &quot;Pan meino&quot;—made with white and yellow flour, eggs, butter, milk and elder flowers; or &quot;&quot;—a wafer of white flour, milk and sugar.

== Transport ==
=== Air ===
The airports nearest to Bellagio are:

* Malpensa International Airport (MXP), Milan
* Linate Airport (LIN), Milan
* Orio al Serio International Airport (BGY), Bergamo
* Lugano airport (LUG)

From these airports, trains are available to lake hubs such as Como and Lecco. From there, bus services travel to Bellagio and other lakeside locations frequently. From Lugano, bus service is available to Menaggio, from which a ferry can be taken to Bellagio. Chartered seaplanes also land on the lake itself.

=== Rail ===
The railway lines nearest to Bellagio are:

* Milan–Como (two lines, operated by Trenord)
* Milan–Lecco-Tirano (operated by Trenord)
* Milan–Asso (operated by Trenord)

For more information on trains, see Trenitalia or Trenord

=== Water ===
A hydrofoil runs from Como to Bellagio, making stops at the other towns on Lake Como along the way. Car ferries also runs from Varenna and Cadenabbia to Bellagio. These are much shorter trips of less than 15 minutes. For more information, visit Gestione Governativa Navigazione Laghi.

Easy access to Bellagio can be found via ferry. There is no direct train to Bellagio, but the closest stop is Varenna.

=== Road ===
Bellagio is accessible on either side of the Larian Triangle by slow, narrow and winding roads from Como or Lecco. It is much safer to drive from Como up to Cadenabbia and use the reasonably priced car ferry for the quick trip across to Bellagio. An alternative is to take the four-lane road on the eastern shore of the right arm of the lake to Varenna, then take the ferry to Bellagio. Narrow stone stairs make most of the Borgo inaccessible to cars.

Public buses run daily from Como to Bellagio.

== Twin towns ==
Bellagio is a founding member of the Douzelage, a unique town twinning association of 24 towns across the European Union. This active town twinning began in 1991 and there are regular events, such as a produce market from each of the other countries and festivals. Discussions regarding membership are also in hand with three further towns (Agros in Cyprus, Škofja Loka in Slovenia, and Tryavna in Bulgaria).

Thomas Lynch (November 21, 1844May 4, 1898) was an American lawyer and Democratic politician from the U.S. state of Wisconsin. He served two terms in the United States House of Representatives, representing Wisconsin&#x27;s 9th congressional district. He was also the first mayor of Antigo, Wisconsin, and served two terms in the Wisconsin State Assembly.

==Biography==

Thomas Lynch was born on November 21, 1844, in the town of Granville, Milwaukee County, in the Wisconsin Territory. He was educated in the common schools in Milwaukee County, then moved to the town of Chilton, Wisconsin, in Calumet County, in 1864, and purchased a farm.

In the Spring of 1867 he was elected to the town board of supervisor—winning his election by just 1 vote. The next year he was elected chairman of the town board; he was then re-elected in that office in 1869 and 1870. In 1871, he began teaching school while studying law.

In 1872, he was elected to his first term in the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing all of Calumet County. He was elected running as an Independent candidate, but caucused as a Democrat after joining the 26th Wisconsin Legislature.

After the legislative session, in the spring of 1873, he was elected chairman of both his town board and the Calumet County board of supervisors. In 1874, he attended the University of Wisconsin Law School in Madison, Wisconsin, to complete his legal education. He graduated the following year and was admitted to the bar. He immediately returned to Calumet County and formed a law partnership with Calumet&#x27;s incumbent district attorney John E. McMullen, known as McMullen &amp; Lynch. In 1878 he was elected as successor to McMillan as district attorney, and served two terms.

In 1882, rather than running for another term as district attorney, he ran for election to the Assembly, and was elected to serve in the 36th Wisconsin Legislature.

After the end of the 1883 legislative session, he moved north to Antigo, Wisconsin, in Langlade County. When Antigo was incorporated as a city, Lynch was elected the first mayor. He was subsequently elected to another term as mayor in 1888.

In 1890, he was chosen as the Democratic Party nominee for United States House of Representatives in Wisconsin&#x27;s 9th congressional district, which then comprised nearly all of northern Wisconsin—Ashland, Chippewa, Door, Florence, Forest, Langlade, Lincoln, Marathon, Marinette, Oconto, Oneida, Portage, Price, Sawyer, Shawano, Taylor, Waupaca, and Wood counties. At the general election, he defeated incumbent Republican congressman Myron H. McCord. He went on to win re-election in 1892 and served in the Fifty-second and Fifty-third Congresses (March 4, 1891March 3, 1895). He was defeated in 1894, running for a third term.

Lynch resumed his legal practice, but suffered from Bright&#x27;s disease. In May 1898, he died of the disease at his summer home in Pelican Lake, Wisconsin.

==Personal life and family==
Thomas Lynch married Winnifred Finucane on November 2, 1867. They had at least 10 children, though at least seven of those died in childhood. They were members of the Catholic Church. It&#x27;s not clear if any of his children survived him.

<text>Kate Atkinson (born 20 December 1951) is an English writer of novels, plays and short stories. She has written historical novels, detective novels and family novels, incorporating postmodern and magical realist elements into the plots. Her debut, &quot;Behind the Scenes at the Museum&quot;, won the Whitbread Book Award, the precursor to the Costa Book Award, in 1995. The novels &quot;Life After Life&quot; and &quot;A God in Ruins&quot; won the Costa Book Award for novel in 2013 and 2015. She is also known for the Jackson Brodie series of detective novels, which has been adapted into the BBC One series, &quot;Case Histories&quot;.

==Biography==
The daughter of a shopkeeper, Atkinson was born in York, the setting for several of her books. She was an only child and often had to find ways to amuse herself. She describes herself as an anxious child, something she believes had to do with being illegitimate. Her parents lived together but were not married, because her mother could not divorce her first husband. At the time, that was considered scandalous.

She studied English literature at the University of Dundee, gaining her master&#x27;s degree in 1974. Atkinson subsequently studied for a doctorate in American literature, with a thesis titled &quot;The post-modern American short story in its historical context&quot;. Postmodern stylistic elements can be found in her own literary work. She failed at the viva (oral examination) stage. After leaving the university, she took on a variety of jobs, from home help to legal secretary and teacher, until her breakthrough as a writer in 1995.

Atkinson was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to literature. In 2015, she became the first author to win a Costa Book Award three times when her book &quot;A God in Ruins&quot; won the Novel of the Year award. On 30 November 2018, she was the guest on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. She currently lives in the Grange district of Edinburgh.

==Writing career==
Atkinson was in her thirties when she began writing short stories. One of her stories won a prize in a &quot;Woman&quot;&#x27;s Own writing contest in 1986, which encouraged her to continue writing, and she published stories in several magazines and newspapers. She has said that writing short stories was a good learning experience because she was forced to tell her story as efficiently as possible. In 1993, she won the Ian St. James Award for the story &quot;Karmic Mothers-Fact or Fiction&quot;? This is a story about two women who are both recovering from a suicide attempt in a hospital room next to the maternity ward. In 1997, the story was adapted for television.

In 1995 she published her first novel, the tragicomic &quot;Behind the Scenes at the Museum&quot;. Based on the childhood memories of young woman Ruby Lennox, the novel tells the story of a family during World War I and World War II. The book went on to be a &quot;Sunday Times&quot; bestseller and at once established her name as a writer. Some critics, however, dismissed it as a feminist manifesto. &quot;Behind the Scenes at the Museum&quot; was awarded the Whitbread Prize in the categories of “best debut,” and “Book of the Year.” The latter led to some commotion in the media; the debut novel by the unknown Atkinson had been selected over the winner in the “best novel” category, &quot;The Moor&#x27;s Last Sigh&quot; by Salman Rushdie. &quot;Behind the Scenes at the Museum&quot; has been adapted for radio and stage. Atkinson herself wrote the screenplay for a television adaptation.

In her next two novels, &quot;Human Croquet&quot; (1997) and &quot;Emotionally Weird&quot; (2000), Atkinson experimented with different stylistic elements and narrative techniques. In &quot;Emotionally Weird&quot;, for example, she uses different fonts to distinguish characters and locations. In 2000, her play &#x27;&quot;Abandonment&quot; premiered in Edinburgh. In 2002 she published a collection of short stories entitled &quot;Not the End of the World&quot;.

In 2004, &quot;Case Histories&quot;, a novel centered around the private investigator Jackson Brodie, was published; he was Atkinson&#x27;s first male protagonist. Three more Brodie novels followed: &quot;One Good Turn&quot; (2006), &quot;When Will There Be Good News?&quot; (2008) and &quot;Started Early Took My Dog&quot; (2010). The series was adapted for television with Jason Isaacs as Jackson Brodie.

In 2009, she donated the short story &quot;Lucky We Live Now&quot; to Oxfam&#x27;s Ox-Tales project, which consisted of four collections of UK stories written by 38 authors. Atkinson&#x27;s story was published in the &quot;Earth&quot; collection.

She followed up the Brodie-series with three novels set during World War II. The highly successful novel &quot;Life After Life&quot; (2013) is a combination of science fiction, historical novel and psychological fiction. Over the course of the story, the main character Ursula Todd dies several times, only to be born again and again in the year 1910 and start her life anew. In each new life, Ursula must make choices that turn out to influence the course of history. &quot;Life After Life&quot; received the Costa Book Award for Novel in 2013, and was adapted for television in 2022 .

Atkinson&#x27;s next novel &quot;A God in Ruins&quot; (2015) follows the life of Ursula&#x27;s brother Teddy Todd who is a pilot in the Royal Air Force during the war, but is more realistic than &quot;Life After Life&quot;. This book also won the Costa Book Award for Novel. Readers and critics generally have most praise for &quot;Life After Life&quot; because of its unusual structure and originality, but Atkinson herself considers &quot;A God in Ruins&quot; her best work. The main character of &quot;Transcription&quot; (2018) is a woman who worked for MI5 during the Second World War.

&quot;Big Sky,&quot; Atkinsons fifth novel centered about detective Jackson Brodie was published in 2019. After a number of books about World War II, Atkinson wanted to write about a different theme. The storyline of &quot;Big Sky&quot; was originally intended for a TV series about a female detective, to be played by Victoria Wood. After Wood&#x27;s unexpected death in 2016, Atkinson decided to use the plot for the next novel in her Brodie cycle.

&quot;Shrines of Gaiety&quot; (2022) is set in the London nightclub milieu shortly after World War I. &quot;Normal Rules Don&#x27;t Apply&quot; (2023) was her first collection of short stories since 2002. In 2024 &quot;Death at the Sign of the Rook&quot; was published, the sixth Jackson Brodie novel, conceived during the corona pandemic. The story is set in an English country house; it pays homage to Agatha Christie and other writers from &quot;the golden age of the detective novel&quot; between World War I and World War II.

== Style and themes ==
In Kate Atkinson&#x27;s novels and stories, much is not what it seems at first glance. She combines the conventional forms of the historical novel, detective novel and family novel with postmodern or magical realist elements. Atkinson is fascinated by the role of chance in life, and this is a recurring theme in her stories. Her books present a succession of (unexpected) events and extraordinary characters. Main characters sometimes face periods of mental confusion or amnesia. Atkinson also plays with the chronology of events, both within one book and between different books. Some characters return as older or younger versions of themselves. Problems experienced in the present are often caused by painful past events, that sometimes have been concealed for generations.

Atkinson herself has said that it is not possible to write a novel about happy people, who are just busy being happy. In her work, especially in the Brodie cycle, she also refers to current events. The theme of justice plays an important role in her stories.

Her books contain humor and the narrative tone of voice is often mildly ironic.

<doc id="694301" wikidata="Q930835" url="?curid=694301" title="GNU Screen">
<text>GNU Screen is a terminal multiplexer: a software application that can be used to multiplex several virtual consoles, allowing a user to access multiple separate login sessions inside a single terminal window, or detach and reattach sessions from a terminal. It is useful for dealing with multiple programs from a command line interface, and for separating programs from the session of the Unix shell that started the program, particularly so a remote process continues running even when the user is disconnected.

Released under the terms of version 3 or later of the GNU General Public License, GNU Screen is free software.

==Features==
GNU Screen can be thought of as a text version of graphical window managers, or as a way of putting virtual terminals into any login session. It is a wrapper that allows multiple text programs to run at the same time, and provides features that allow the user to use the programs within a single interface productively. This enables the following features: persistence, multiple windows, and session sharing.

Screen is often used when a network connection to the terminal is unreliable, as a dropped network connection typically terminates all programs the user was running (child processes of the login session), due to the session ending and sending a &quot;hangup&quot; signal (SIGHUP) to all the child processes. Running the applications under screen means that the session does not terminate – only the now-defunct terminal gets detached – so applications don&#x27;t even know the terminal has detached, and allows the user to reattach the session later and continue working from where they left off.
==History==
Screen was originally designed by Oliver Laumann and Carsten Bormann at Technische Universität Berlin and published in 1987.

Design criteria included VT100 emulation (including ANSI X3.64 (ISO 6429) and ISO 2022) and reasonable performance for heavy daily use when character-based terminals were still common. Later, the at-the-time novel feature of disconnection/reattachment was added.

Around 1990, Laumann handed over maintenance of the code to Jürgen Weigert and Michael Schroeder at the University of Erlangen–Nuremberg, who later moved the project to the GNU Project and added features such as scrollback, split-screen, copy-and-paste, and screen sharing.

By 2014, development had slowed to a crawl. Wanting to change this, Amadeusz Sławiński volunteered to help. In response, Laumann granted him maintainership. Sławiński proceeded to put out the first new Screen release in half a decade. Because there were some unofficial &quot;Screen 4.1&quot; releases floating around the Internet, he called this new release &quot;Screen 4.2.0&quot;.

In May 2015, on openSUSE Conference, Jürgen Weigert invited Alexander Naumov to help to develop and maintain GNU screen. Two months later with Alex&#x27;s help &quot;GNU screen 4.3.0&quot; was released.

<doc id="694302" wikidata="Q630156" url="?curid=694302" title="Vormsi">
<text>Vormsi () is the fourth-largest island of Estonia, measuring and a registered population of around 400. It is located in the Baltic Sea, northwest of the mainland and east of Hiiumaa island, and is part of the West Estonian archipelago (Moonsund archipelago). 

Administratively the island forms the main part of the Vormsi &quot;vald&quot; (rural municipality). 

==History==
The documented history of Vormsi dates back as far as the 13th century. During most of this time, the island was inhabited by Estonian Swedes (&quot;rannarootslased&quot; in Estonian or &quot;coastal Swedes&quot; in English). &quot;Ormsö&quot; in Swedish means &quot;Orm&#x27;s island&quot;, and can be translated also as &quot;Snake island&quot;. The Estonian name &quot;Vormsi&quot; and German &quot;Worms&quot; have both been derived from &quot;Ormsö&quot;.

The island&#x27;s population reached 3,000 before World War II. During the war, nearly all of Vormsi&#x27;s population, along with other Swedes living in Estonia, forming the larger region of Aiboland, were evacuated, or fled, to Sweden. 

==Villages==
The villages on the island include: Hullo (the administrative centre), Sviby (the main port), Söderby, Norrby, Diby, Rälby, Förby, Borrby, Kärrslätt, Saxby, Suuremõisa (Magnushof, formerly Busby), Rumpo (the main beach area) and Hosby.

Vormsi is the per capita wealthiest island and region in Estonia outside of the Tallinn metro area, with incomes on the same level as inner Tallinn. This is attributed to the fact that many comparatively wealthy people own summer homes on the island and are registered as residents, so their yearly income tax is forwarded to the island&#x27;s budget.

Vormsi has only small businesses with no significant industrial activity. The island earns the majority of its revenues from the taxation on the salaries earned by its residents on the Estonian mainland.

The island of Vormsi has homeowners from several countries and regions in Estonia, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland and elsewhere.

<text>A character sheet is a record of a player character in a role-playing game, including whatever details, notes, game statistics, and background information a player would need during a play session. Character sheets can be found in use in both traditional and live-action role-playing games. Almost all role-playing games make use of character sheets in some fashion; even &quot;rules-light&quot; systems and freeform role-playing games record character details in some manner.

The role-playing video game equivalent is known as a status screen. Some non-role-playing games, such as some board games and party games, also use records that could be compared to character sheets.

== History ==
The first role-playing game published, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (1974), did not include a character sheet. The first one ever published was in the &quot;Haven Herald&quot; fanzine of Stephen Tihor published on May 3, 1975. One month after, another character sheet was released in the APA magazine &quot;Alarums and Excursions&quot;.

Since then, most tabletop role-playing games use a character sheet for information about the player characters. Most of them fit onto one page, but some games like &quot;Castle Falkenstein&quot; or &quot;Sailor Moon RPG&quot; use a full booklet. Other games such as &quot;Ars Magica&quot; (covenant sheet) or &quot;Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay III&quot; (party sheet) and &quot;Reign&quot; use a sheet for a group of player characters.

==Overview==
What is considered relevant can vary by game and personal preference—one player may consider his character&#x27;s eye colour or personal background relevant while another might not, but both may be required by the game rules to note down on their sheet if their character suffers an injury.

The layout of a character sheet, when creating a sheet or choosing which one to use, is important. First, the sheet must allow the player to record what the system finds relevant to their character. Second, it must allow the player to easily find and read off information at a glance when they need it. In addition, if the character sheet is more than one page long, careful consideration must be given to put the most often used data areas at the front page. In all cases, care must be given to ensuring that the layout is generally well organized, grouping similar areas together logically while being easily readable and not overcrowded.

=== Contents of a Character Sheet ===
A character sheet is likely to include stable attributes, such as the character&#x27;s name and physical characteristics. It may also include values that change often such as experience, abilities, health/vitality (e.g. hit points) and an inventory of items possessed. It is common for a character sheet to essentially be a record of a character&#x27;s history as changes are made and important things noted. It is referenced during gameplay. Despite the name, a single character &quot;sheet&quot; may actually be two or more pages in length.

The content and design of such a sheet varies greatly among games, and is a reflection of what the system considers important. For instance, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, being a high fantasy dungeon crawler, requires a description of a character (same as every game), combat capabilities, and magic abilities if applicable. As such, the character sheet focuses on the character and the basic combat abilities, with an optional secondary page on magic. Another example is how in comparison, Call of Cthulhu has a larger section on skills and what is possible, without the unspoken abilities of a Dungeons and Dragons character.

Going to extremes, character sheets can even hold nothing on the characters being played. An example of that is Alice is Missing, where the character sheet is a record of what has happened to the character in the game at that point, and not on the abilities of each character.

A player may have an additional character sheet if he also controls a second character, a cohort or a hireling, but this is less common. The dungeon master, who runs the game, may optionally keep proper character sheets for non-player characters (NPCs) if he wishes to keep full information on the character. Some rulebooks offer special “NPC sheets” for this purpose that are considerably smaller than the usual (main) character sheets.

== Formats ==

=== Paper ===
Character sheets for a game are usually found within the game&#x27;s main rulebook, and permission is almost always given for players to photocopy this sheet. Some publishers sell preprinted sheets separately. Many offer PDF files with character sheets for the players to print out themselves. These sheets are generally forms split into sections that hold the information related to play the game.

It is not uncommon for players to create custom character sheets, to their own design, rather than use the publisher&#x27;s “official” offerings. Some design their own sheets or record their character information on an empty sheet of paper, although inexperienced players are recommended to use formatted sheets to avoid leaving out important information.

===Electronic===
With the advent of personal computing, players began designing character sheets with computers. The earliest computer-generated character sheets were designed in a word processing program, so that players could fill in their information and have a typewritten sheet to use. Next, players began to experiment with spreadsheet solutions, so that some of the calculations required were automated. Some important advantages of spreadsheet character sheets are ease of access, automatic calculations, complex formulas can be more easily coded and they remove reliance on pen and paper. Wizards of the Coast included a character generator CD with their Player&#x27;s Handbook, 3rd Edition, and offered the Character Builder for download to D&amp;D Insider subscribers, alongside a Monster Builder as part of Dungeons and Dragons Adventure Tools.

=== Dynamic===
A Dynamic Character Sheet is an electronic sheet that is used in conjunction with a computer/mobile device during gaming sessions. Such a character sheet is used not only to track the character, but to also add/apply effects to the character on the fly. For example, if the character receives the effects of a spell which increases its strength score, then a dynamic character sheet will be able to automatically update all the effects of a higher strength character. Another example is if a character activates one of his abilities, the dynamic character sheet will be able to apply the effects of that ability in real time. Furthermore, such character sheets enable the player to track the duration of the applied effect, thus turning off effects that have expired.

<doc id="694311" wikidata="Q472822" url="?curid=694311" title="Grindavík">
<text>Grindavík () is a fishing town in the Southern Peninsula district of Iceland, not far from Þorbjörn, a tuya (a type of flat-topped, steep-sided volcano).

It is one of the few towns with a harbour on this coast. Most of the inhabitants work in the fishing industry. The Blue Lagoon, Grindavík&#x27;s première attraction, is located from the town.

In November 2023, in the midst of escalating and severe seismic activity, a state of emergency was declared and the town evacuated. On 18 December 2023, at around 22:00 local time (GMT), the Sundhnúkur volcano erupted. The eruption was close to Hagafell, about northeast of Grindavík. A risk was also posed to Svartsengi Power Station. Fountains of lava, up to high, could be seen from Iceland&#x27;s capital, Reykjavík. Authorities said they were highly prepared.
The volcano erupted again on 8 February, for the third time since December, this time at the edge of the town, and the lava flow destroyed a few buildings and infrastructure. The residents of Grindavík had remained evacuated. On 20 February, the residents were allowed to return to their homes, but on 2 March, Grindavík was again evacuated because of new seismic activity. On 16 March, a fourth eruption began near the site of the first eruption, which ended on 8 May. A fifth eruption began as a fissure on 29 May, but the eruptive activity quickly localized to a primary edifice in Sundhnúkur crater row, close to the northern edge of Grindavík town. This eruption ended on 22 June.

==History==

 or &quot;The Book of Settlements&quot; mentions that around 934, two Viking settlers, Molda-Gnúpur Hrólfsson and Þórir Haustmyrkur Vígbjóðsson , arrived in the Reykjanes area. Þórir settled in Selvogur and Krísuvík and Molda-Gnúpur in Grindavík.

The sons of Moldar-Gnúpur established three settlements; Þórkötlustaðahverfi , Járngerðarstaðarhverfi and Staðarhverfi . The modern version of Grindavík is situated mainly in what was Járngerðarstaðarhverfi.

The town has been an important fishing station since medieval times. In the 13th century its fishing rights were owned by the Bishop of Skálholt, who took payment in stacks of salted cod. It was the scene of fierce disputes between English fishermen and German merchants in the 16th century, leading to 280 Germans storming the ship of John Breye (also known as John the Broad) in 1532 and killing 15 people, including John. The English were subsequently expelled from Iceland.

In June 1627, Grindavík was raided by Barbary Pirates in an event known as the Turkish Abductions. Twelve Icelanders and three Danes, along with two vessels were taken, and with captives taken from other Icelandic settlements, transported into slavery in Salé.

The origins of the municipality can be traced to Einar Einarsson&#x27;s decision to move there to build and run a shop in 1897. During that time the population was only around 360. Fishing had for centuries been a crucial element in the survival of Grindavík&#x27;s population, but fishing trips were often dangerous. Men were frequently lost at sea and the catch not always stable. However, when a safer access point to land was created at Hópið in 1939, fishing conditions changed dramatically. From 1950 serious development in the fishing industry had begun to take place. Grindavík was declared a municipality in 1974.

===Etymology===

The name &#x27;Grindavík&#x27; combines two Icelandic elements. &quot;Vík&quot; means a shallow inlet, while &quot;grind&quot; has the meaning of a gate or gateway – possibly referring to an opening in a fence used to control the movement of livestock.
The &quot;Book of Settlements&quot; mentions Grindavík twice but gives no explanation for the name. &quot;Grind&quot; can furthermore signify a dock – that is, where the boats are stored (in the sea or up on the land), as well as long-finned pilot whale, and in the old language any small whale, suggesting that the settlers may have found whales in the area.

==Geography and geology==
Grindavík is situated on the far south-western part of the Reykjanes Peninsula. The town stands on a lava field that erupted up to about 2,350 years ago from the Sundhnúkur crater chain just north of Grindavík, as well as from the Svartsengisfell volcanoes and fissures on Stora Skogsfell, both nearby. The town is one of six communities on the peninsula that is situated on or near an eruptive fissure.

Grindavík&#x27;s harbour, called Hópið, was created by an eruption from Sundhnúkur approximately 2,800 years ago that created a peninsula south-east of where the town stands, long by wide, known as Hópsnes on the west side and Þórkötlustaðanes on the east side. A lighthouse, built in 1928, stands on the southern tip. The town&#x27;s fishing industry originally operated from huts on Þórkötlustaðanes before moving to Grindavík harbour in 1939 after local residents dug a channel through a reef to connect Hópið to the sea.

===2023–24 volcanic eruptions===

On 25 October 2023, an earthquake swarm started north of Grindavík and escalated over the next few days. A state of emergency was issued on 10 November 2023 as continued earthquakes – by then numbering over 22,000 since 25 October – signalled a potentially impending volcanic eruption. Inhabitants were ordered to evacuate on the evening of 10 November 2023, after a magmatic intrusion was suspected to have formed beneath the town. This occurred following weeks of recorded uplift and seismic unrest north of the town, near the Blue Lagoon. Between midnight and 2 p.m. on 10 November 2023, almost 800 earthquakes were recorded, with the shallowest occurring at depths ranging from , as reported by the Icelandic Meteorological Office.

The Icelandic Civil Protection Agency released statements expressing concerns that a magma dike under formation could extend towards Grindavík. Press photographs from Grindavík on 11 November showed the extent of damage to roads, and the golf course, due to fault movements caused by the activity. On 18 December, a volcanic eruption north of Grindavík by Hagafell prompted the evacuation of the town.

On the morning of 14 January 2024 at 8:00 local time, a volcanic fissure erupted from the town, followed by a second fissure opening around noon. Lava from the eruptions flowed into the town, breaching defensive barriers and destroying three houses. Civilians were not endangered by the volcanic activity as they had already been evacuated overnight due to a series of earthquakes.

On 9 February 2024, the Icelandic government published a bill to offer to buy residential property owned by individuals in Grindavík, and to take over housing loans on residential property in the town.

==Activities==

A short distance to the north, there is the Blue Lagoon (), a geothermal spa using hot and mineralized waters from the nearby Svartsengi power station.

Ungmennafélag Grindavíkur (Umfg) is the town&#x27;s sport club, and the town contains the Grindavíkurvöllur stadium.

The Leif the Lucky Bridge spans the Álfagjá rift valley that marks the boundary of the Eurasian and North American continental tectonic plates. It was built in 2002 and named in honour of Icelandic explorer Leif Erikson, who travelled from Europe to explore North America 500 years before Columbus.

The Icelandic Saltfish Museum in Grindavík opened in 2002. It displays the story of salt fish production and its importance for the Icelandic economy throughout the centuries in a specially designed building of .

===Sports===
Grindavík has a football team and a basketball team.

==Notable residents==
The Icelandic writer Guðbergur Bergsson was born here, and Kalli Bjarni, the first winner of the Icelandic version of &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, lives in the town. The Spanish publisher and writer , engaged to Guðbergur Bergsson, lived, died and is buried here. Icelandic footballer Alfreð Finnbogason was also born in Grindavík.

Former Manchester United footballer, Lee Sharpe, had a spell with Grindavík football club, at the end of his career in 2003.

==United States Naval communication facility==
Near Grindavík, the United States Navy has operated the 1049 acre Naval Radio Transmitter Facility Grindavik since the mid-1970s. It uses several antennas, including two guyed masts. The mast situated at 63°51′1″N 22°28′0″W was built in 1993 and is tall. The other mast at 63°51′3″N 22°27′6″W was built in 1983 and is tall. The taller mast replaced a mast, and the second replaced a mast of the same height.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

<text>Robert Menendez (; born January 1, 1954) is an American lawyer and former politician who served as a United States senator from New Jersey from 2006 until his resignation in 2024 following his conviction on 16 counts in a political corruption case. He was sentenced to 11 years in prison in January 2025. A member of the Democratic Party and the Cuban–American lobby, he was first appointed to the Senate by Governor Jon Corzine, and chaired the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations from 2013 to 2015 and from 2021 to 2023.

In 1974, at age 20, Menendez was elected to the Union City School District&#x27;s Board of Education. He received degrees from Saint Peter&#x27;s University and Rutgers Law School at Rutgers University–Newark. In 1986, he was elected mayor of Union City. In 1988, while continuing to serve as mayor, he was elected to represent the state&#x27;s 33rd district in the New Jersey General Assembly, and in 1991 he moved to the New Jersey Senate upon winning the special election for the 33rd Senate district. The next year, Menendez won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. He represented New Jersey&#x27;s 13th congressional district from 1993 to 2006. In January 2006, Menendez was appointed to fill the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Jon Corzine (who had been elected governor of New Jersey). He was elected to a full six-year term in November and reelected in 2012 and 2018.

In 2015, Menendez was indicted on federal corruption charges; the jury was unable to reach a verdict, and the charges were dropped in 2018. In 2018, the United States Senate Select Committee on Ethics &quot;severely admonished&quot; Menendez for accepting gifts from donor Salomon Melgen without obtaining committee approval, failing to disclose certain gifts, and using his position as a senator to advance Melgen&#x27;s interests.

In September 2023, Menendez was again indicted on federal corruption charges that he aided and provided sensitive information to the government of Egypt. He stepped down as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but refused to resign from the Senate. In October 2023, Menendez was charged with conspiracy to act as a foreign agent of the Egyptian government for accepting bribes in exchange for promoting Egypt&#x27;s opposition to the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) on the Blue Nile and for trying to convince the U.S. State Department to adopt Egypt&#x27;s stance on this issue. A superseding indictment in January 2024 accused Menendez of also working for the government of Qatar. In March, Menendez was indicted for obstruction of justice. In July, a jury found him guilty of all charges. He is the first sitting member of Congress to be convicted of conspiracy to act as a foreign agent. Menendez resigned from the Senate in August and was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment in January 2025.

The case against Menendez gained significant attention when investigators discovered gold bars and hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash at his home. Judge Sidney Stein, who presided over the case, remarked during the sentencing, &quot;Somewhere along the way ... you lost your way. Working for the public good became working for your good&quot;. Prior to the sentencing, Menendez pleaded for leniency. Despite the conviction and sentencing, Menendez has maintained his innocence and vowed to appeal the verdict.

==Early life==
Menendez was born on January 1, 1954, in New York City to Cuban immigrants who had left Cuba a few months earlier, in 1953. His father, Mario Menéndez, was a carpenter, and his mother, Evangelina, was a seamstress. The family subsequently moved to New Jersey, where he grew up in an apartment in Union City. He attended Union Hill High School, where his speech teacher, Gail Harper, helped him develop as a public speaker. Menendez has said, &quot;My mother and Miss Harper made me understand the power of education, what it means to put a premium on learning and working hard.&quot; While at Union Hill, Menendez became the student body president. His father, Mario Menéndez, was reportedly a &quot;compulsive gambler&quot; who died by suicide on June 1, 1978, after deciding not to pay gambling debts.

Menendez became the first in his family to go to college, attending Saint Peter&#x27;s College in Jersey City, where he was a member of the Lambda Theta Phi fraternity. He graduated with a B.A. in political science and earned his Juris Doctor degree from Rutgers Law School in 1979. Menendez was admitted to the New Jersey bar in 1980 and became a lawyer in private practice.

==Early political career==

=== Union City politics (19741992) ===
At the start of his career, Menendez was an aide to Union City mayor and state senator William V. Musto. In 1974, he was elected to the Union City Board of Education, the youngest candidate ever to win election to the board. In 1982, he unsuccessfully challenged Musto for mayor.

In the 1984 presidential election and 1985 state elections for governor and General Assembly, the Republican Party carried Hudson County, with crucial support from Jersey City mayor Gerald McCann. To build on their gains in the urban, normally Democratic county, Republicans made a significant investment in the 1986 municipal elections. In Union City, Republicans funded an &quot;Alliance Civic Association&quot; (ACA) ticket for city council, led by Republican Assemblyman Ronald Dario. His running mates were two Republicans, Manny Alcobar and Charles Velli, and two Democrats, Menendez and future mayor Bruce Walter.

The ACA swept the council elections with 57% of the vote, beating the reform slate &quot;Transformation &#x27;86&quot; and the incumbent &quot;Union City Together&quot; ticket. The Together party, which included Musto&#x27;s wife, Commissioner Rhyta Musto, represented the remnants of Musto&#x27;s political machine. Although Republicans had formed and funded the ACA ticket on the premise that the new council would elect Dario mayor, Menendez and Walter convinced Alcobar to switch his vote to Menendez.

=== New Jersey legislature (19871992) ===
In November 1987, Menendez was elected to represent New Jersey&#x27;s 33rd district in the General Assembly. He also continued to serve as mayor until 1992. He held both offices until March 1991, when he moved from the Assembly to the New Jersey Senate upon winning the special election following the death of Christopher Jackman.

==U.S. House of Representatives (1993–2006)==

===Elections===
In 1992, incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman Frank Guarini, of New Jersey&#x27;s 14th congressional district, retired after redistricting. The district had been renumbered as the 13th district and reconfigured as a Latino-majority district. Menendez decided to run in the primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic district—and defeated Robert Haney Jr., 68%–32%. He defeated New Jersey Superior Court Judge Fred J. Theemling Jr. in the general election with 64% of the vote. After that, he was reelected every two years with at least 71% of the vote until he was appointed to the U.S. Senate in January 2006.

===Tenure===
Menendez, who is described as very close to Republicans on foreign policy, voted for the failed Kosovo Resolution, authorizing the use of military force against Yugoslavia in the Kosovo War. He was an early advocate of preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear capabilities, sponsoring the Iran Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1998, which passed the House but failed to pass the Senate.
Menendez voted for Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists, authorizing the President to use military force in Afghanistan in response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In 2002, Menendez voted against the Iraq Resolution to authorize the invasion of Iraq.

Menendez voted against the United Nations Reform Act of 2005, cutting U.S. funding to the U.N. by 50% over three years, and sponsored the Tsunami Orphans and Unaccompanied Children Act of 2005 to assist victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.

Menendez voted for the PATRIOT Act in 2001, and in 2006 for its reauthorization.

In the 105th Congress, Menendez voted for the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, repealing provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 that limited investment banks from acquiring insurance companies or other commercial banks, and voted for the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. After the 2001 Enron scandal, Menendez voted with 333 other House members for the Sarbanes–Oxley Act.

Although he had sometimes been portrayed as the political boss of Hudson County, he strongly dislikes this appellation, particularly because, according to an anonymous close source quoted in the December 11, 2005 &quot;Union City Reporter&quot;, &quot;there is no boss of Hudson County&quot;. According to a 2005 &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed, &quot;Since entering politics as a corruption-fighting mayor of Union City, N.J., Mr. Menendez has become a proponent of business as usual. He has long been an entrenched de facto leader of the Hudson County Democratic machine.&quot;

In September 2006, just a few weeks before the 2006 Senate elections, the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office in New Jersey, headed by Chris Christie, began investigating a rental deal with North Hudson Community Action Corporation, subpoenaing records from them. Some Democrats criticized the investigation, particularly the timing of the investigation and news leaks, as politically motivated.

==U.S. Senate (2006–2024)==
In January 2006, Governor Jon Corzine appointed Menendez to fill the remaining year in Corzine&#x27;s Senate term, from which Corzine resigned after being elected governor of New Jersey two months before. While several others had been mentioned, Menendez was the early favorite among pundits for Governor-elect Corzine&#x27;s choice. Corzine&#x27;s decision to appoint Menendez got the support of several Latino groups, including the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. Menendez was the sixth Latino to serve in the United States Senate.

In 2015, Menendez was ranked #1 on &quot;The Hudson Reporter&quot;″s annual Power List of the &quot;Fifty Most Powerful Political Figures in Hudson County&quot;.

===Elections===
==== 1996 ====

When incumbent U.S. Senator Bill Bradley decided to retire in August 1995, Menendez made known his intention to run in the 1996 election for the seat, but eventually dropped out of the race and endorsed Robert Torricelli, the Democrat representing New Jersey&#x27;s 9th congressional district. Similarly, in 1999, when the state&#x27;s other U.S. Senator, Frank Lautenberg, announced his planned retirement, Menendez again decided not to run, with the Democratic nomination for the 2000 race going to Goldman Sachs CEO Jon Corzine, who won the general election.

==== 2006 ====
In the midterm elections held on November 7, near the end of his one-year appointment, Menendez ran to retain his Senate seat. He defeated Republican Thomas Kean Jr., incumbent minority whip in the New Jersey Senate, and son of former state governor Thomas Kean, with 53% of the vote to Kean&#x27;s 45%.

Menendez was endorsed by several newspapers including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot;, and &quot;The Record&quot;.
==== 2012 ====
Menendez ran for reelection to a second full term and defeated Republican Joe Kyrillos on November 6, with 58% of the vote to Kyrillos&#x27;s 39%.

==== 2018 ====
Menendez ran for reelection to a third full term and defeated Republican Bob Hugin on November 6, with 54% of the vote to Hugin&#x27;s 42%.

==== 2024 ====

In January 2024, Menendez was charged with corruption for promoting the interests of Qatar while receiving various illicit gifts such as cash, gold bars, and a Mercedes-Benz automobile. On March 21, he announced that he would not run in the Democratic primary due to his indictment on federal corruption charges. He did not rule out running as an independent. On June 3, Menendez officially filed to run as an independent. He told the Associated Press that despite running as an independent he would not leave the Democratic Party. But on July 23, upon his criminal conviction, Menendez announced his resignation from the Senate altogether.

===Committee assignments===

===Tenure===
On January 6, 2021, Menendez was participating in the certification of the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count when Trump supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol. After rioters breached the Capitol, he was evacuated to an undisclosed location with other senators. He called the attack &quot;anarchy&quot; and &quot;a sad day for our democracy&quot;. After the Capitol was secure and Congress reconvened, Menendez voted to certify the election. Menendez blamed Trump and Republicans who supported Trump&#x27;s baseless claims of voter fraud for inciting the attack. He also called for an investigation into white supremacy in the military.

====Immigration====

Menendez is an &quot;aggressive advocate&quot; of immigration reform, calling it the &quot;civil rights issue of our time&quot;. He has introduced multiple pieces of legislation in attempts to overhaul what he calls our &quot;failed immigration system&quot;. Menendez introduced the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2011, but it died in the Senate Judiciary Committee. In 2009, he introduced the Orphans, Widows, and Widowers Protection Act, granting a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented widowers and orphans of deceased U.S. citizens.

Menendez is a strong supporter of the DREAM Act, saying, &quot;Children should not be punished for the actions of their parents. These kids have grown up as Americans, worked hard in school and now they want to serve our country in the military or pursue a college education. This is the only home many of them have known and they should be encouraged to pursue the American dream.&quot; He voted for the DREAM Act in 2007 and was a cosponsor along with 31 other senators in the Act&#x27;s failed passage in 2010.

Menendez voted against denying legal status to illegal immigrants convicted of domestic violence, crimes against children and crimes relating to the illegal purchase or sale of firearms, but voted to establish a six-month to 20-year ban for undocumented immigrants seeking citizenship who had been convicted for the same crimes along with obstruction of justice, human trafficking and the participation of criminal gang activity.

Menendez supported the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 and Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, voting for both bills. He voted against Senate Amendment 1151, declaring English the national language of the Federal government of the United States. He voted to continue federal funding for declared &quot;sanctuary cities&quot;.

He voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, building 700 miles (1,100 km) of physical barriers and expanding surveillance at the Mexico–U.S. border, and supported Senate Amendment 4775, which would have appropriated $1.8 billion for the construction of of triple-layered fencing, and of vehicle barriers along parts of the Southwest.

On January 28, 2013, Menendez was a member of a bipartisan group of eight senators that announced principles for comprehensive immigration reform (CIR). In 2014 the National Council of La Raza (America&#x27;s largest Latino advocacy organization) recognized Menendez for his work in supporting immigration reform as a member of the &quot;Gang of Eight&quot;.

==== Agriculture ====
In June 2019, Menendez and 18 other Democratic senators sent USDA Inspector General Phyllis K. Fong a letter requesting that she investigate USDA instances of retaliation and political decision-making and asserted that not conducting an investigation would mean these &quot;actions could be perceived as a part of this administration&#x27;s broader pattern of not only discounting the value of federal employees, but suppressing, undermining, discounting, and wholesale ignoring scientific data produced by their own qualified scientists&quot;.

==== Disaster relief ====
In April 2018, Menendez was one of five Democratic senators to sign a letter to FEMA administrator Brock Long calling on FEMA to enter an agreement with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development that would &quot;stand up the Disaster Housing Assistance Program and address the medium- and longer-term housing needs&quot; of evacuees of Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. The senators asserted that &quot;FEMA&#x27;s refusal to use the tools at its disposal, including DHAP, to help these survivors is puzzling – and profoundly troubling&quot; and that hundreds of hurricane survivors were susceptible to being left homeless in the event that FEMA and HUD continued not to work together.

====Environment====
Menendez introduced legislation that would incentivize the conversion of vehicles to run on natural gas; the bill did not make it out of committee in its first incarnation and failed to receive 60 votes required to pass in 2012.

In February 2019, in response to reports of the EPA intending to decide against setting drinking water limits for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) as part of an upcoming national strategy to manage the aforementioned class of chemicals, Menendez was one of 20 senators to sign a letter to Acting EPA Administrator Andrew R. Wheeler calling on the agency &quot;to develop enforceable federal drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS, as well as institute immediate actions to protect the public from contamination from additional per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)&quot;.

In June 2019, Menendez was one of 44 senators to introduce the International Climate Accountability Act, legislation that would prevent President Trump from using funds in an attempt to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and directing the Trump administration to develop instead a strategic plan for the United States that would allow it to meet its commitment under the Paris Agreement.

====Education====
Menendez sponsored the Student Non-Discrimination Act, expanding Title IX of the Education Amendments Act to LGBT students, and the Safe Schools Improvement Act of 2011, which would also amend the Higher Education Act of 1965. He voted for the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act in 2009, saying, &quot;When someone is harassed, assaulted or killed simply because of the type of person they are, it&#x27;s a crime against an entire community and our nation&#x27;s values.&quot; In 2012, Menendez received a 94% rating from the Human Rights Campaign.

During a press conference about the Teachers and First Responders Back to Work Act, Menendez claimed that New Jersey was facing a $10.5 billion shortfall in its 2012 fiscal budget that would lead to cuts in state spending on education. PolitiFact rated this statement &quot;false&quot; because the 2012 budget was balanced and increased education funding.

====LGBT policy====
Menendez voted for the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) as a congressman in 1996; on December 18, 2011, he came out in support of, and co-sponsored, the Respect for Marriage Act, which would repeal DOMA. Menendez also voted for the U.S. military&#x27;s Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell as a congressman, and co-sponsored the DADT repeal act in 2010.

In 1999, Menendez voted against a proposed amendment that would have banned adoption in Washington D.C. by same-sex couples and other persons not related by blood or marriage. The amendment failed with 213 votes in favor and 215 votes against.

Of gay rights, Menendez has said, &quot;Two people who want to be committed to each other should be able to enter into marriage, and they should receive the benefits that flow from that commitment.&quot;

====Gun policy====

Menendez has an &quot;F&quot; rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund and a &quot;F−&quot; rating from the Gun Owners of America due to his support of gun law reform. Specifically, he supports universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons.

In January 2019, Menendez was one of 40 senators to introduce the Background Check Expansion Act, a bill that would require background checks for either the sale or transfer of all firearms, including all unlicensed sellers. Exceptions to the bill&#x27;s background check requirement included transfers between members of law enforcement, loaning firearms for either hunting or sporting events on a temporary basis, providing firearms as gifts to members of one&#x27;s immediate family, firearms transferred as part of an inheritance, or giving a firearm to another person temporarily for immediate self-defense.

In June 2019, Menendez was one of four senators to cosponsor the Help Empower Americans to Respond (HEAR) Act, legislation that would ban suppressors being imported, sold, made, sent elsewhere, or possessed and grant a silencer buyback program as well as include certain exceptions for current and former law enforcement personnel and others. The bill was intended to respond to the Virginia Beach shooting, where the perpetrator used a .45-caliber handgun with multiple extended magazines and a suppressor.

==== Health care ====
In December 2018, Menendez was one of 42 senators to sign a letter to Trump administration officials Alex Azar, Seema Verma, and Steve Mnuchin arguing that the administration was improperly using Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act to authorize states to &quot;increase health care costs for millions of consumers while weakening protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions&quot;. The senators requested the administration withdraw the policy and &quot;re-engage with stakeholders, states, and Congress&quot;.

In January 2019, during the 2018–2019 United States federal government shutdown, Menendez was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to Commissioner of Food and Drugs Scott Gottlieb recognizing the efforts of the FDA to address the effect of the government shutdown on the public health and employees while remaining alarmed &quot;that the continued shutdown will result in increasingly harmful effects on the agency&#x27;s employees and the safety and security of the nation&#x27;s food and medical products&quot;.

====Foreign affairs====

Menendez holds that the success of America&#x27;s foreign policy is &quot;inextricably linked to the health of her domestic democracy&quot;, stating in the January 19, 2021, confirmation hearings of Secretary-designate Antony Blinken that public servants and senators have a &quot;duty to stand up for democracy, for the constitution, and for the rule of law&quot;. He identified chief concerns as &quot;rebuilding alliances, restoring American leadership in international institutions, and addressing complex global challenges like climate change, migration, pandemics like COVID-19&quot;. He identifies the &quot;core American values&quot; as &quot;democracy, human rights, and the rule of law&quot;, upon which foreign policy should be recentered.

In February 2006, Menendez cosponsored legislation with Senator Hillary Clinton to make it illegal for foreign governments to buy U.S. port operations. The legislation was a direct response to Dubai Ports World&#x27;s efforts to purchase Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&amp;O) of the United Kingdom, which operates six major U.S. ports. Menendez said, &quot;Our ports are the front lines of the war on terrorism. They are both vulnerable targets for attack and venues for smuggling and human trafficking. We wouldn&#x27;t turn the Border Patrol or the Customs Service over to a foreign government, and we can&#x27;t afford to turn our ports over to one either.&quot;

Former undercover FBI agent Robert Eringer wrote in his 2008 book &quot;Ruse: Undercover with FBI Counterintelligence&quot; that Cuban diplomats approached him to infiltrate Cuban exile organizations. He said that the Cuban government believed Menendez and Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Díaz-Balart were receiving illicit payments from such organizations, and that it wanted to identify the source of the payments in order to &quot;expose and humiliate&quot; the three Congress members.

In October 2009, Menendez sent a strongly worded letter of protest to Cyprus President Dimitris Christofias, criticizing him for his praise of the Cuban government. Christofias, the leader of AKEL, Cyprus&#x27;s communist party, from 1988 to 2009 and president from 2008 to 2013, had paid a state visit to Cuba in September 2009 for the opening of Cyprus&#x27;s new embassy and, in his speech, made several anti-American embargo references, and spoke of the &quot;common struggle of Cyprus and Cuba&quot;. In his letter to Christofias, Menendez wrote, &quot;you cannot claim human rights violations by Turkey in your country and then ignore such violations in Cuba. Second, you cannot call for property rights for Greek Cypriots and then deny them on Cuba. Finally, you cannot take issue with the militarization of northern Cyprus and then ignore the state security apparatus that oppresses the Cuban people.&quot;

In December 2010, Menendez voted for the ratification of New Start, a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the U.S. and the Russian Federation obliging both countries to have no more than 1,550 strategic warheads or 700 launchers deployed during the next seven years along with providing a continuation of on-site inspections that halted when START I expired the previous year. It was the first arms treaty with Russia in eight years.

On August 18, 2015, Menendez announced his opposition to the nuclear deal with Iran, saying, &quot;President Obama continues to erroneously say that this agreement permanently stops Iran from having a nuclear bomb, Let&#x27;s be clear: What the agreement does is to recommit Iran not to pursue a nuclear bomb, a promise they have already violated in the past.&quot;

In March 2017, Menendez co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (S.270), which made it a federal crime, punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment, for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories if protesting actions by the Israeli government.

In 2018, Menendez urged Vice President Mike Pence to enter talks with Ecuador about withdrawing its asylum for Julian Assange. His letter, signed by nine other senators, alleged that it was Assange&#x27;s goal to &quot;undermine democratic processes globally&quot;. In March 2018, Menendez voted against Bernie Sanders&#x27;s and Chris Murphy&#x27;s resolution that would end U.S. support for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. But Menendez criticized Saudi Arabia&#x27;s war in Yemen, saying, &quot;The Saudi Coalition bears significant responsibility for the magnitude of human suffering and scale of destruction in Yemen. Seventy-five percent of the population is in need of humanitarian assistance and more than 8 million are on the brink of famine.&quot; Noting concerns with the language after voting for Bob Corker&#x27;s resolution naming the Saudi crown prince &quot;responsible&quot; for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, he said, &quot;regardless of all of my other concerns about language is the central essence of what the chairman is going to do. I think it&#x27;s incredibly important for the Senate to speak on that issue and hopefully speak with one voice.&quot;

Menendez condemned the genocide of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar and called for a stronger response to the crisis.

Menendez raised the issue of Xinjiang internment camps and called China&#x27;s persecution of Uyghurs &quot;beyond abhorrent&quot;, adding, &quot;The President needs to have a clear and consistent approach to China, and not turn a blind eye as a million Muslims are unjustly imprisoned and forced into labor camps by an autocratic regime.&quot;

In January 2019, Menendez opposed Trump&#x27;s planned withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan as a threat to U.S. national security.

In April 2019, Menendez was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to Trump encouraging him &quot;to listen to members of your own Administration and reverse a decision that will damage our national security and aggravate conditions inside Central America&quot;, asserting that Trump had &quot;consistently expressed a flawed understanding of U.S. foreign assistance&quot; since becoming president and that he was &quot;personally undermining efforts to promote U.S. national security and economic prosperity&quot; by preventing the use of Fiscal Year 2018 national security funding. The senators argued that foreign assistance to Central American countries created less migration to the U.S. by helping to improve conditions in those countries.

In June 2019, Menendez called for the immediate release of Ukrainian journalist Stanislav Aseyev, who was being held in custody by militants from the so-called Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic.

In October 2019, Menendez stated his opposition to the Turkish invasion of the Kurdish areas in Syria.

Menendez called for the Trump administration to immediately suspend U.S. military aid to Azerbaijan, sent through Pentagon&#x27;s &quot;building partner assistance program&quot;. According to critics, the aid could be used in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia. In September 2020, Menendez tweeted: &quot;I strongly condemn Azerbaijan&#x27;s attack on Nagorno Karabakh, yet another act of aggression supported by Turkey.&quot; He co-signed a letter stating: &quot;We have been very critical of U.S. security assistance to Azerbaijan given the country&#x27;s human rights record and aggression in the region. Earlier this year, at Senator Menendez&#x27;s request, the Government Accountability Office agreed to conduct a review of security assistance to the country to ensure that it aligns with U.S. interests; this violence indicates that it does not.&quot;

In September 2022, during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Menendez criticized the Biden administration for hesitating to impose sanctions on the governments of Sudan and Ethiopia, where many atrocities and war crimes were committed in the Tigray War.

====Senate Foreign Relations Committee====
Menendez became chair of the Foreign Relations Committee after John Kerry&#x27;s confirmation as Secretary of State in January 2013. His &quot;Syria force resolution&quot; was praised by President Obama and others. Menendez has supported taking a &quot;hard line&quot; on Iran.

====Foreign affairs legislation sponsored====
*Organization of American States Revitalization and Reform Act of 2013 (S. 793; 113th Congress) – Menendez introduced this bill on April 24, 2013. The bill would require the Secretary of State to develop a multiyear strategy to bolster the Organization of American States (OAS) and improve the OAS&#x27;s processes for managing its budget and personnel. The act would require the Secretary to provide quarterly briefings to Congress on the progress of implementing that strategy.
*Support for United States-Republic of Korea Civil Nuclear Cooperation Act – Menendez introduced this bill, which would authorize the President to extend the term of the &quot;Agreement for Cooperation between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Korea Concerning Civil Uses of Atomic Energy&quot; to a date no later than March 19, 2016. The bill passed the Senate on January 27, 2014, and the House on January 28, 2014.

*Ukraine Freedom Support Act of 2014 (), was introduced by Menendez to the 113th Congress on September 16, 2014, to address pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine. It was co-sponsored by 14 other senators. President Obama signed the bill into law on December 18, 2014.
*Defending Ukraine Sovereignty Act of 2022. In light of the prelude to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, this legislation gave Ukraine $500 million &quot;to assist the country in meeting its defense needs&quot;. The bill also reimposed sanctions on Russia.

====Other issues====
On September 28, 2006, Menendez voted for the Military Commissions Act.

On June 12, 2007, Menendez endorsed Hillary Clinton for president and was given the position of National Campaign Co-Chair. He made numerous media appearances in support of her campaign.

In 2009, Menendez succeeded Senator Chuck Schumer of New York as chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Menendez&#x27;s tenure, which followed two straight election cycles of dramatic Democratic gains, was marked by a more troubled Democratic outlook. Critics of Menendez pointed out the surprising Democratic loss in the 2010 Massachusetts Senate special election that followed the death of Ted Kennedy; Menendez&#x27;s lower-key, more cautious management style; and problems caused by retirements in Indiana and elsewhere. Others, such as Schumer, defended Menendez&#x27;s performance, citing the negative political climate.

A group of New Jersey citizens launched an effort to recall Menendez in early 2010. Although Article 1, Paragraph 2(b) of the New Jersey Constitution expressly authorizes such a recall, state officials fought the effort in court. On March 16, 2010, a State Appeals court ruled that the recall petition could proceed. Menendez said he was surprised that a group claiming to be true to the Constitution was trying, in his words, &quot;to undermine it&quot;. He appealed the ruling. Legal experts have debated the constitutionality of a state recall of a federal officeholder. On November 18, 2010, the New Jersey Supreme Court found that the New Jersey provision violated the U.S. Constitution.

In 2010, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Menendez had written to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, asking him to approve an acquisition that would rescue from the prospect of receivership a New Jersey bank, First Bank Americano, operated by Menendez donors. It was discovered that &quot;eight of 15 directors, including the bank&#x27;s chairman and vice-chairman, have been contributors to Menendez or his political action committee&quot;. Former federal bank regulator William K. Black called the letter &quot;grotesquely inappropriate&quot; and said that &quot;the letter crossed an unofficial line by asking regulators to approve an application instead of simply asking that it be given consideration&quot;. An aide to Menendez said that political contributions did not influence his decision to write the letter. A highly critical Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation report found that the institution had engaged in unsafe or unsound banking practices, including operating without adequate supervision by its board of directors, excessive delinquent or bad loans, inadequate earnings, and insufficient coverage of its assets.

On January 5, 2012, Menendez blocked Judge Patty Shwartz, an Obama administration nominee, to a federal judgeship, drawing speculation that the block was placed because of Shwartz&#x27;s relationship with the head of the public corruption unit for New Jersey&#x27;s federal prosecutor, who had investigated Menendez during his 2006 campaign. Menendez denied personal motivation for the block. He has long contended that the corruption investigation was politically motivated. The investigation was closed in late 2011 with no charges filed.

On December 12, 2012, it was reported that Menendez&#x27;s office had an unpaid intern volunteering who had let his visitor visa expire and was a registered sex offender. The Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement had been aware of the man as early as October 2012 but according to the Associated Press, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) instructed their agents not to arrest the man until after Election Day. Menendez denied knowing about the allegation of the directive to delay the arrest and only recently learned of the arrest. According to two federal officials who spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to discuss the case, the intern was arrested in front of his New Jersey home on December 6, 2012.

In May 2014, Menendez received an award for Political Courage at a gala organized by the American Friends of Likud, where he reaffirmed the strong alliance between the U.S. and Israel and said, &quot;several thousands of years of history lead to an undeniable conclusion: the reestablishment of the State of Israel in modern times is a political reality with roots going back to the time of Abraham and Sarah and historical texts and artifacts&quot;. He rejected movements to boycott Israel.

Menendez became an outspoken advocate of the People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran (MEK) after it was delisted.

Menendez spearheaded a nonbinding resolution in July 2018 &quot;warning President Trump not to let the Russian government question diplomats and other officials&quot;. The resolution states the United States &quot;should refuse to make available any current or former diplomat, civil servant, political appointee, law enforcement official or member of the Armed Forces of the United States for questioning by the government of Vladimir Putin&quot;. It passed 98–0.

In April 2019, Menendez was one of 41 senators to sign a bipartisan letter to the housing subcommittee praising the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development&#x27;s Section 4 Capacity Building program as authorizing &quot;HUD to partner with national nonprofit community development organizations to provide education, training, and financial support to local community development corporations (CDCs) across the country&quot; and expressing disappointment that Trump&#x27;s budget &quot;has slated this program for elimination after decades of successful economic and community development.&quot; The senators hoped the subcommittee would support continued funding for Section 4 in Fiscal Year 2020.

Menendez has pushed for a complete tax deduction for state and local taxes (SALT). Most of the benefits of such a policy would benefit the wealthiest taxpayers.

===Implication in child prostitution scandal===
In November 2012, the conservative political news and opinion website &quot;Daily Caller&quot; published allegations that Menendez had contact with underage prostitutes in the Dominican Republic. The allegations were promoted by Republican Party operatives, who arranged for ABC News and the &quot;Daily Caller&quot; to interview two women who accused Menendez of patronizing prostitutes. ABC News and other news organizations such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;New York Post&quot; declined to publish the allegations, viewing them as unsubstantiated and lacking credibility. One accuser stated that she had been paid to falsely implicate Menendez and had never met him. The &quot;Daily Caller&quot; said this woman was not interviewed for its story. Menendez&#x27;s office called the allegations &quot;manufactured&quot; by a &quot;right-wing blog&quot; as a politically motivated smear. On March 18, 2013, Dominican police announced that three women had said they had been paid $300–$425 each to lie about having had sex with Menendez.

==Corruption charges and conviction==
On August 27, 2006, two Republican state lawmakers filed an ethics complaint against Menendez, alleging he broke conflict-of-interest rules when renting property to a nonprofit agency that receives federal funds. Menendez helped the agency win designation as a Federally Qualified Health Center in 1998. That designation allowed it to receive additional federal grants. Menendez allies said that the organization in question, the North Hudson Community Action Corp., which provides social services and health care to the poor and was founded in 1960, had received federal funding for years before Menendez was in Congress, and receives its funding based on mathematical formulas. Menendez said that he rented the property out below market value because &quot;he was supportive of its work&quot;. The total rent collected over nine years was over $300,000.
The sentencing of Bob Menendez marked a significant fall from grace for the once-powerful politician. Judge Sidney Stein, in delivering the sentence, remarked, &quot;You stood at the apex of our political system. Somewhere along the way, you lost your way.&quot; The conviction made Menendez the first sitting member of Congress to be found guilty of acting as a foreign agent.
The corruption scheme involved Menendez accepting over $100,000 in gold bars, a Mercedes-Benz convertible, and more than $480,000 in cash hidden in various locations. Prosecutors argued that Menendez used his position to push for U.S. military aid to Egypt and share nonpublic information with Egyptian officials. 
Two of Menendez&#x27;s co-conspirators, Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, were also sentenced to 8 and 7 years in prison respectively. The case against Menendez included substantial evidence, such as Daibes&#x27; fingerprints on envelopes of cash found at Menendez&#x27;s home and serial numbers on gold bars traced to both Daibes and Hana. Menendez&#x27;s legal team had sought leniency, arguing for a non-custodial sentence due to his age and his wife&#x27;s ongoing cancer treatment. However, the prosecution pushed for a substantial prison sentence to address what they called an &quot;extraordinary abuse of power and betrayal of the public trust&quot;. 

=== 2015 indictment ===

In January 2013, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents raided the office of Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen, a close friend and major donor to Menendez. Later that month, a federal grand jury in Miami began investigating Menendez for his role in advocating for Melgen&#x27;s business interests. It was revealed over the following months that Menendez had paid Melgen nearly $59,000 for two private flights to the Dominican Republic in 2010. This raised questions about whether the flights violated Senate Ethics Committee rules. It was also found that Melgen&#x27;s company had contributed more than $950,000 to Menendez&#x27;s 2012 reelection campaign. Melgen&#x27;s home was raided again on October 22 but he still refused to cooperate with investigators.

On April 1, 2015, the United States Department of Justice indicted Menendez and Melgen in &quot;United States v. Menendez&quot; (3d Cir. 2016). The charges against Menendez included bribery, fraud, and making false statements. According to the indictment, Menendez asked top State Department officials to pressure the Dominican Republic&#x27;s government to enforce a port-security contract that would benefit Melgen&#x27;s company while at the same time Melgen was promising to give $60,000 to Menendez&#x27;s campaign. Prosecutors also charged that Menendez acted as Melgen&#x27;s &quot;personal senator&quot;, helping obtain visas for several of Melgen&#x27;s girlfriends. In return, Menendez was accused of accepting a range of gifts from Melgen, including trips on Melgen&#x27;s private jet, three nights at a five-star Paris hotel, a round of golf at a private club in West Palm Beach, and access to an exclusive Dominican resort—some of which Menendez allegedly failed to report on financial disclosure forms. Melgen also donated a substantial amount of money to Menendez&#x27;s political campaigns, and prosecutors said that $750,000 of those contributions were tied to personal benefits Menendez accepted.

After his indictment, Menendez voluntarily stepped down as ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee. His trial began on September 6, 2017, before Judge William H. Walls of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. On November 16, 2017, Walls declared a mistrial due to the jury&#x27;s inability to reach a verdict on any charges. On January 31, 2018, the Justice Department announced it was dropping all charges against Menendez. The case was strongly shaped by &quot;McDonnell v. United States&quot;, the 2016 Supreme Court decision to vacate the corruption conviction of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell, which narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery. Melgen was convicted of 66 counts of health-care fraud and in February 2018 was sentenced to 17 years in prison; President Trump commuted his sentence in January 2021.

In April 2018, the United States Senate Select Committee on Ethics &quot;severely admonished&quot; Menendez in a letter, writing:

=== 2023 indictment ===
Beginning in late 2022, questions were raised about whether Menendez or his wife accepted allowable gifts from an Edgewater, New Jersey, halal meat provider and whether an Egyptian firm received unwarranted favorable treatment. Subpoenas unrelated to the latter firm were issued in May 2023 to Nicholas Sacco, the mayor of North Bergen, New Jersey, and others. Investigators found $480,000 in cash and more than $100,000 worth of gold bars at Menendez&#x27;s home. On September 22, 2023, federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged five people, including Menendez and his wife Nadine, with corruption in a new indictment.

One of the allegations was that Menendez &quot;provided sensitive U.S. Government information and took other steps that secretly aided the Government of Egypt&quot;. Another was that he used his position to pressure prosecutors in New Jersey who were involved in the cases of his friends Fred Daibes and Jose Uribe in exchange for financial gifts from the two men. According to the Senate Historical Office, Menendez is the first sitting senator to be indicted on two unrelated criminal matters. After the indictment, he gave up his position as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Over the following days, Democratic Party politicians such as New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, New Jersey General Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin, and numerous U.S. senators called for Menendez&#x27;s resignation. Menendez said: &quot;It is not lost on me how quickly some are rushing to judge a Latino and push him out of his seat. I am not going anywhere.&quot; Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said that Menendez &quot;has a right to due process and a fair trial&quot;. Representative Andy Kim responded that given Menendez&#x27;s refusal to resign, he would run in the Democratic primary for Menendez&#x27;s seat in the 2024 United States Senate election in New Jersey. On November15, 2023, Murphy&#x27;s wife, Tammy Murphy, announced that she was running for Menendez&#x27;s Senate seat. On March24, 2024, she suspended her campaign.

On October13, 2023, prosecutors filed new charges that Menendez &quot;provided sensitive U.S. Government information and took other steps that secretly aided the Government of Egypt&quot; and failed to register as an agent of a foreign power for over four years. Senator John Fetterman called on the Senate to expel Menendez.

In a superseding indictment filed on January2, 2024, prosecutors alleged that Menendez made positive comments about Qatar in order to help a New Jersey real estate developer secure millions in funding from a member of the Qatari royal family. In exchange, Menendez allegedly received gifts including cash, gold, designer watches, and Formula One tickets.

On March5, 2024, Menendez and his wife were charged with obstruction of justice after prosecutors alleged that his attorneys had lied about payments two businessmen made on his wife&#x27;s house and car. Menendez claims the payments were loans he later repaid, but prosecutors claim they were bribes. The indictment came the week after one of the businessmen, Jose Uribe, pleaded guilty to charges of fraud and bribery.

===Trial, conviction, and sentencing===

Jury selection for Menendez&#x27;s trial began on May13, 2024. On June4, an FBI agent testified about surveillance she had conducted against Menendez in May 2019 at Morton&#x27;s The Steakhouse in Washington, D.C., where Menendez and his wife, Nadine, were dining with three others, including an Egyptian official. Agents also testified about a search they performed of a safe deposit box in New Jersey Nadine Menendez used, in which they found $80,000 in cash. The defense noted that Menendez himself had never accessed the safety deposit box.

On June6, the prosecution called former New Jersey attorney general Gurbir Grewal to the stand. Grewal told the court that in September 2019 Menendez invited him to a meeting at Menendez&#x27;s office in Newark, at which Menendez complained about Grewal&#x27;s office&#x27;s treatment of Hispanic defendants in a trucking insurance fraud investigation; when Menendez made clear he was referring to an ongoing case, Grewal ended the meeting and left.

Closing arguments took place on July 9 and 10. Jury deliberations began on July 12. On July 16, the jury convicted Menendez of all charges, including bribery, extortion, honest services fraud, obstruction of justice, and conspiracy. Sentencing was originally scheduled for October 29, but was delayed to January 29, 2025.

On January 29, 2025, Menendez was sentenced to 11 years in prison, however his sentence will not start until June 6, 2025, so he can attend his wife&#x27;s trial in March (who is also facing charges of bribery and corruption). Outside the court, Menendez stated the &quot;process is political and it&#x27;s corrupted to the core. ... I hope President Trump cleans up the cesspool and restores the integrity to the system.&quot;

==Awards and honors==
West New York, New Jersey, which borders Menendez&#x27;s childhood hometown of Union City to the north, renamed Public School No. 3 in his honor; it is now known as Robert Menendez Elementary School. The renaming ceremony was held on December 4, 2013. Following Menendez&#x27;s conviction in July 2024, West New York officials agreed to revert the school to its previous name by the time the upcoming school year began. In 2021, President of Greece Katerina Sakellaropoulou awarded Menendez the Grand Cross of the Order of Honour for &quot;his contribution to the deepening of Greek-US relations and the promotion of peace and cooperation in the wider region&quot;. Menendez also received the Grand Cross of the Order of Makarios III from President of Cyprus Nicos Anastasiades for &quot;his contribution to promoting human rights, the rule of law, and democracy&quot;. In 2014, Prime Minister of Spain Mariano Rajoy awarded Menendez the Grand Cross of The Order of Isabella the Catholic for &quot;his dedication to Spain and the Hispanic community and his excellent work in developing the links between Spain and the United States&quot;.

==Personal life==

In 1976, Menendez married Jane Jacobsen, a teacher for the Union City Board of Education and Union City Public Schools. They had two children: Alicia Menendez, an MSNBC television commentator/host, and Rob Menendez, who worked as the Commissioner of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and was elected to Congress in New Jersey&#x27;s 8th congressional district in 2022 as a Democrat. Menendez and Jacobsen divorced in 2005. He has four grandchildren.

Later, Menendez dated Gwendolyn Beck, an author who later ran for Congress. In 2010, he brought her to the White House for a state dinner.

In December 2013, Menendez proposed to his girlfriend, Alicia Mucci, in the Capitol rotunda. Some sources say they married that month, but many others indicate that they never married.

He began a relationship with Nadine Arslanian in 2018. Reports conflict as to whether they had an &quot;on-again, off-again relationship&quot; for most of the year or met in December 2018 at the IHOP in Union City. In October 2019 they traveled to India and he proposed to her at the Taj Mahal. They married in October 2020. She has two children from a prior marriage, and was divorced in 2005. In September 2023, Arslanian was indicted on federal bribery charges alongside Menendez. It was subsequently reported that she had been involved in a December 2018 car accident that left a pedestrian dead. The case, which drew no charges or media coverage at the time, resurfaced in the federal indictment, where prosecutors allege Menendez interfered with the prosecution of a New Jersey businessman in exchange for a Mercedes to replace his wife&#x27;s car.

As of 2009, Menendez lived in Hoboken. In 2011, he lived in North Bergen, and in 2014 he moved to Paramus. In 2018, he moved to Harrison, and in 2020 he moved into his new wife&#x27;s home, in Englewood Cliffs.

Since February 2025, Menendez&#x27;s daughter Alicia has co-hosted MSNBC&#x27;s 7pm ET weekday newscast.

<text>Hollywood Entertainment Corp., more commonly known as Hollywood Video, was an American video rental store chain. Founded in 1988, the chain was the largest direct competitor to Blockbuster Video until it was acquired by Movie Gallery in 2005. It ceased operations in 2010, when Movie Gallery declared Chapter 7 bankruptcy.

In October 2011, the chain&#x27;s website had been relaunched as a blog. The website remains active, though the last entry was made in October 2014.

==History==
===20th century===
In 1984, Mark Wattles left college and was struggling financially. Wattles&#x27; parents had given him and his wife a VCR, which they used as a form of low-cost entertainment. Wattles later said: &quot;I thought, &#x27;There must be other people in America in the same shoes. I think this would be a great business.&quot; In 1985, Wattles borrowed money so he could open a 500 square-foot video rental store with 300 films, located in downtown Portland, Oregon. In 1988, Wattles formed Hollywood Entertainment and served as the company&#x27;s president and chief executive. Hollywood Video stores later opened in Washington, California, Nevada, and Texas.

In 1993, Hollywood, which operated 16 stores, became a public company. As of 1994, the average Hollywood Video store was 7,500 square feet with 16,000 video tapes. In some instances, the company ordered up to 70 copies of a popular film for each store, while some stores stocked up to 200 copies of a single film. At that time, each store generated approximately $1 million (~$ in ), while 78 additional stores were planned to open in 1995.

In January 1995, Blockbuster filed a $10 million lawsuit against Hollywood Entertainment for hiring five former Blockbuster employees. Blockbuster alleged that the employees knew some of the company&#x27;s trade secrets, which could be used to aid Hollywood Entertainment. At the time, Hollywood Video had 117 stores, compared to Blockbuster&#x27;s 2,800 stores. Hollywood Video was ranked fourth in national sales. In May 1995, a judge ruled in favor of Hollywood Entertainment, stating that Blockbuster had failed to demonstrate irreparable harm as a result of the hiring.

In June 1995, Hollywood Entertainment had 153 stores in 11 states. The company&#x27;s locations included stores operating under the Video Park and Video Central names. That month, Hollywood Entertainment announced plans to triple the number of stores by late 1997. In August 1995, Hollywood Entertainment purchased the 42-store Video Watch chain in the mid-western United States for $59 million (~$ in ). Video Watch was the last of four video rental chains that had been targeted by Hollywood Entertainment for purchase. In November 1995, Hollywood Entertainment announced plans to open 90 stores in Michigan over the next three years. The company also planned to open more than 200 stores in 1996.

In 1996, Hollywood decided to establish three regional offices, with one each in the Chicago, Houston, and San Francisco Bay Areas. Julie Wainwright became president and CEO of Reel.com, replacing founder, Stuart Skorman. After 27 months, in July 1998, CEO Mark Wattles announced Hollywood had purchased Reel.com &quot;in a deal valued at $100 million&quot;, which included $30 million (~$ in ) in cash to Reel&#x27;s stockholders; Reel.com was to continue operating independently, and led by its CEO Julie Wainwright, then Wainwright then left the organization to be replaced by Jeff Jordan.

===21st century===

Hollywood Video was the target of a hostile takeover attempt, initially announced at the end of December 2004 by competitor Blockbuster Video. Blockbuster announced an exchange offer of $14.50 per share ($11.50 cash and $3.00 in Blockbuster shares). In response, Hollywood Video agreed to a buyout on January 10, 2005, by Movie Gallery, a smaller competitor. Movie Gallery paid $860 million, $13.25 per share, and the assumption of $380 million in debt. Stocks closed at $13.85 on January 10 after this news. Blockbuster then dropped its purchase plans, citing antitrust concerns. Movie Gallery completed its purchase of Hollywood Video on April 27, 2005.

Hollywood became a subsidiary of Movie Gallery and maintained its Oregon headquarters.

Hollywood&#x27;s last US store closed on July 31, 2010, whereas the last in Canada closed on August 8 of that year.

In December 2011, the website hollywoodvideo.com was relaunched as a movie news curator blog. The site used an automated &quot;social scoring algorithm&quot; to link to articles on the web pertaining to movies and other entertainment media content. The site also contained a blog written by a single editor (that was later expanded to multiple editors) about current movie-related news. As of April 2013, the &quot;social scoring algorithm&quot; part of the site was removed and replaced with the blog. The website also contained an interface for searching and buying movies from Amazon.com from within the Hollywood Video site.

==Headquarters==

At one time, Hollywood Video was headquartered in Beaverton, Oregon, in an office building. In 1996, Hollywood moved its employees out of the building two years into its five-year lease. In 1996, Poorman-Douglas Corp agreed to occupy all of the space in the Beaverton building, relieving Hollywood of extra rent payments.

After Hollywood decided to leave Beaverton, it signed a long-term lease for a building in Wilsonville, Oregon. Robert Goldfield of the &quot;Portland Business Journal&quot; said that Hollywood Video &quot;barely&quot; took occupancy of the structure; then Mark Wattles, the chief executive, decided to move the offices and the Hollywood Video headquarters to the former Smith&#x27;s Home Furnishings headquarters in Wilsonville. In 1996 170 full-time employees worked from the headquarters. The headquarters facility was no longer occupied by October 1998; as of that month the space was for lease.

In 1997, when Hollywood was considering a new headquarters location, the City of Wilsonville had signage codes that did not allow companies to use neon. The codes made Hollywood consider using other locations. Members of the City of Wilsonville&#x27;s development review boards said that neon was out of character for the Wilsonville Business Park, Hollywood Video&#x27;s prospective location.

In January 1999, Trammell Crow Co. bought the Thrifty Payless Inc. headquarters for $25.5 million and then broke the compound into sections, selling pieces of it for a total of $22 million; Trammell Crow retained control of the $8 million, headquarters building. Hollywood leased the headquarters building, and Hollywood remained headquartered in Wilsonville.

<text>Husavik is a village in Austevoll municipality in Vestland county, Norway. The village is located on Vestre Vinnesvåg area on the southeastern shore of the island of Huftarøy, about northeast of the village of Vinnes and about south of the farming village of Otterå. The village is a regular stop for a ferry service connecting the islands of Austevoll to the large island of Stord to the south, across the Selbjørnsfjorden.
