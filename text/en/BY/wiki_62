<text>Nicolette Larson (July 17, 1952 – December 16, 1997) was an American singer. She is perhaps best known for her work in the late 1970s with Neil Young and her 1978 hit single of Young&#x27;s &quot;Lotta Love&quot;, which hit No. 1 on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart and No. 8 on the pop singles chart. It was followed by four more adult contemporary hits, two of which were also minor pop hits.

By 1985, she shifted her focus to country music, charting six times on the US country singles chart. Her only top-40 country hit was &quot;That&#x27;s How You Know When Love&#x27;s Right&quot;, a duet with Steve Wariner. She died in 1997 of cerebral edema and liver failure.

== Early life and career ==
Nicolette Larson was born in Helena, Montana. Her father&#x27;s employment with the U.S. Treasury Department necessitated frequent relocation for the family. She graduated from high school in Kansas City, Missouri, where she attended the University of Missouri for three semesters and worked at waitressing and office jobs before beginning to pursue the musical career she had dreamed of since singing along to the radio as a child.

In the early 1970s, Larson eventually settled in San Francisco, California, where she worked in a record store (Discount Records, on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley, which also sold tickets for shows at the Fillmore West and Winterland) and for the Golden Gate Country Bluegrass Festival. Turning to singing, her performance career began with a booking as the opening act for Eric Andersen at The Egress, a club in Vancouver, British Columbia. In 1975, Larson auditioned for Hoyt Axton, who was producing Commander Cody. This led to Larson singing with Hoyt Axton and The Banana Band, who were opening for Joan Baez on the &quot;Diamonds and Rust&quot; tour in 1975. She earned her first recording credit on Commander Cody&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Tales From the Ozone&quot;, toured with his band and also provided background vocals on subsequent Commander Cody albums in 1977 and 1978. Other early career singing credits were for Axton and Guy Clark, both in 1976; the following year her resume included further credits with Mary Kay Place, Rodney Crowell, Billy Joe Shaver, Jesse Colin Young, Jesse Winchester, and Gary Stewart.

Larson and Guthrie Thomas both had their first professional recording session on Axton&#x27;s &quot;Southbound&quot; album for A&amp;M Records. As newcomers to the recording industry, they were listed on the back cover of the album as &quot;Street Singers&quot;, entirely separate from the highly paid, more established artists also appearing on the album.

Larson&#x27;s work with Emmylou Harris – whose 1977 album &quot;Luxury Liner&quot; prominently showcased Larson on the song &quot;Hello Stranger&quot; – led to her meeting and then befriending Harris&#x27;s associate and friend Linda Ronstadt. In 1977, Larson was at Ronstadt&#x27;s Malibu home when neighbor Neil Young phoned to ask Ronstadt if she could recommend a female vocal accompanist. Ronstadt suggested Larson; she was the third person that day to mention Larson to Young. He came over to meet Larson, who recalled, &quot;Neil ran down all the songs he had just written, about twenty of them. We sang harmonies with him and he was jazzed.&quot;

The following week Ronstadt and Larson cut their vocals for Young&#x27;s &quot;American Stars &#x27;n Bars&quot; album at Young&#x27;s La Honda ranch – the two women were billed on the album as the Bullets – and, in November 1977, Young invited Larson to Nashville to sing on his &quot;Comes a Time&quot; album. This led to Larson&#x27;s being signed to Warner Bros. Records.

Larson continued her background singing career into 1978, accruing credit on recordings by Marcia Ball, Rodney Crowell, Emmylou Harris (&quot;Quarter Moon in a Ten Cent Town&quot;), and Norton Buffalo. She also sang on the Doobie Brothers&#x27; &quot;Minute by Minute&quot;. That album&#x27;s producer, Ted Templeman, then produced Larson&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Nicolette&quot;.

== 1978–1983 ==
Larson&#x27;s work with Commander Cody had led to her being signed to the C&amp;W division of Warner Bros. Records. However her debut album &quot;Nicolette&quot;, released September 29, 1978, was an eclectic mix of rock, C&amp;W and R&amp;B.

Despite the release of her album so late in the year, Larson was acclaimed Female Vocalist of 1978 by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, which wrote no one else could sound as if she were having so much fun on an album. &quot;Nicolette&quot; reached No. 15 on Billboard&#x27;s album chart aided by the hit single &quot;Lotta Love&quot;, a Neil Young composition. Larson&#x27;s &quot;Lotta Love&quot; hit #1 on the Easy Listening/Adult Contemporary chart and went Top 10 Pop in February 1979. Linda Ronstadt, Valerie Carter, Bill Payne, James Burton, and Patrick Simmons performed on the &quot;Nicolette&quot; album. 

In 1979 the Warner Brothers Music Show label issued 500 promotional copies of the 12&quot; vinyl record album WBMS 103 titled &quot;Nicolette Live at the Roxy&quot; comprising a December 20, 1978, concert that given by Larson at the Sunset Boulevard nightclub. Larson was also featured on the &quot;No Nukes&quot; album recorded in September 1979 at Madison Square Garden, backed by the Doobie Brothers in her performance of &quot;Lotta Love&quot;.

Larson would be unable to consolidate the commercial success augured by her debut: the second single off &quot;Nicolette&quot;, &quot;Rhumba Girl&quot; just missed becoming a major hit for Larson at No. 48. Her second album, &quot;In the Nick of Time,&quot; released November 1979, failed to showcase Larson&#x27;s voice attractively. Don Shewey in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote:

Larson&#x27;s rough-edged, down-home tone is definitely appealing – especially when she backs up the likes of Neil Young and Steve Goodman [whose &quot;High and Outside&quot; album featured a duet with Larson: &quot;The One That Got Away&quot;] – but as a soloist, her limited vocal resources are &quot;severely taxed&quot; – &quot;It&#x27;s symptomatic of Nicolette Larson&#x27;s problems as a performer that the finest singing on &quot;In the Nick of Time&quot; is by Michael McDonald. &#x27;Let Me Go, Love&#x27; ... McDonald&#x27;s entrancing vocal presence ... so overshadows Larson&#x27;s that she seems to be playing second fiddle rather than sharing the lead. Elsewhere, Larson is dwarfed by Ted Templeman&#x27;s typically luxurious production&quot;.

Released as the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Let Me Go Love&quot; reached only No. 35 in February 1980. That year Larson was heard on the airwaves via guest appearances on &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be Mine&quot; by Christopher Cross and the Dirt Band&#x27;s &quot;Make a Little Magic&quot;. Larson had enough residual popularity from her debut for &quot;In the Nick of Time&quot; to become a moderate success. Because she had no major hit, Larson&#x27;s 1981 and 1982 album releases, &quot;Radioland&quot; (her last album produced by Templeman) and &quot;All Dressed Up and No Place to Go&quot;, were unsuccessful, even though both releases showed Larson back in strong vocal form. In 1982 Larson received some adult-contemporary radio airplay with her remake of &quot;I Only Want to Be With You&quot; (No. 53).

Larson had continued her background singing career accruing credits on releases by Tom Johnston, Linda Ronstadt (&quot;Mad Love&quot;), Graham Nash, John Stewart, Albert Hammond, and Rita Coolidge. Larson again backed the Doobie Brothers on their &quot;One Step Closer&quot; album; she can be heard on the hit &quot;Real Love.&quot; A song Larson co-wrote with John McFee and Patrick Simmons titled &quot;Can&#x27;t Let It Get Away&quot; was a 1981 single release for the Doobie Brothers in Japan. 

Larson&#x27;s recording of the Burt Bacharach/Carole Bayer Sager song &quot;Fool Me Again&quot; was featured on the bestselling soundtrack album for the 1981 film &quot;Arthur,&quot; despite not being heard in the film. Larson was also featured on the soundtrack album for &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot; (1983) with the track &quot;Summer Hearts&quot;.

Larson&#x27;s appearance in a touring production of the C&amp;W musical &quot;Pump Boys and Dinettes&quot; garnered enough positive reaction for MCA Nashville to sign her in 1983.

== 1984–1997 ==
The Nashville music community was so enthused about Larson&#x27;s C&amp;W cross-over that in 1984 the Academy of Country Music named her the Best New Female Vocalist before she had any MCA Nashville releases. Larson&#x27;s MCA debut &quot;...Say When&quot; was not released until 1985 (by which point country pop was no longer in style and neotraditionalists had taken over the country scene). The C&amp;W career it ushered in for Larson proved anticlimactic with only one of her six MCA single releases becoming a significant hit: her duet with Steve Wariner titled &quot;That&#x27;s How You Know When Love&#x27;s Right,&quot; taken from the April 1986 album release &quot;Rose of My Heart.&quot; The record reached No. 9 C&amp;W. Larson&#x27;s MCA albums, produced by Emory Gordy Jr. and Tony Brown, attracted little critical attention. Her final mainstream album release was &quot;Shadows of Love&quot;, a 1988 recording made for the Italian CGD label and produced by Carlo Stretti and Ernesto Taberelli. It was her only album for a non-US label. 

In 1992 Larson reunited professionally with Neil Young to sing on his &quot;Harvest Moon&quot; album. In 1993 she was featured on Young&#x27;s &quot;Unplugged&quot;. Larson&#x27;s final album was the self-produced &quot;Sleep, Baby, Sleep&quot;, consisting of music for children, released by Sony Wonder in 1994.

Larson also contributed to the seasonal albums &quot;Tennessee Christmas &quot; (1987) with &quot;One Bright Star&quot;, &quot;Acoustic Christmas&quot; (1988) with &quot;Christmas Is a Time for Giving,&quot; and &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot; (1989) with &quot;Nothing But a Child&quot; and &quot;One Bright Star&quot;. In 1988, Larson contributed to the soundtracks of the film &quot;They Call Me Renegade&quot; with the tracks &quot;Let Me Be the One&quot; from her 1988 album &quot;Shadows of Love&quot;.

While it was recorded in 1978, &quot;Live at the Roxy&quot; was given its first full release in 2006, nine years after Larson&#x27;s death. It was released by Rhino. Also in 2006, Rhino Entertainment released the album &quot;A Tribute to Nicolette Larson: Lotta Love Concert&quot;. Two &quot;Lotta Love&quot; concerts were held on February 20 and 21, 1998, in Santa Monica, CA, to benefit the UCLA Children&#x27;s Hospital. 

== Personal life ==
Through her early work in the 1970s with Emmylou Harris, Larson met guitarist and songwriter Hank DeVito. Larson and DeVito later married and divorced. She also dated Neil Young during the &quot;Comes a Time&quot; sessions. In the early 1980s, Larson was engaged to Andrew Gold, but their relationship ended shortly after the completion of Larson&#x27;s 1982 album &quot;All Dressed Up and No Place to Go,&quot; which Gold had produced. In the late 1980s, she briefly dated &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic. Yankovic would later compose &quot;You Don&#x27;t Love Me Anymore&quot;, a style parody of Larson&#x27;s work, for his 1992 album &quot;Off the Deep End&quot;. In 1990, Larson married drummer Russ Kunkel, and the two remained married until her death in 1997. The couple&#x27;s daughter, Elsie May Larson-Kunkel, was born in 1990.

== Death ==
Larson died on December 16, 1997, in Los Angeles, California, as a result of complications arising from cerebral edema triggered by liver failure. She was 45 years old. According to her friend Astrid Young, Neil Young&#x27;s half-sister, Larson had been showing symptoms of depression, and her fatal seizure &quot;was in no small way related to her chronic use of Valium and Tylenol PM.&quot; Two benefit concerts were held in Larson&#x27;s honor in February 1998. A tribute album was released in 2006 and Carole King and other famous musicians joined the album.

<text>Joseph Bert Tinker (July 27, 1880 – July 27, 1948) was an American professional baseball player and manager. He played from 1902 through 1916 for the Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds of Major League Baseball (MLB) and the Chicago Whales of the Federal League.

Born in Muscotah, Kansas, Tinker began playing semi-professional baseball in Kansas in the late 19th century, first in Kansas City, then in Parsons. He began his professional career in 1900 in minor league baseball, initially in Denver then with Portland in the Northwestern League. He made his MLB debut with the Cubs in 1902. Tinker was a member of the Chicago Cubs dynasty that won four pennants and two World Series championships between 1906 and 1910. After playing one season with Cincinnati in 1913, he became one of the first stars to jump to the upstart Federal League in 1914. After leading the Whales to the pennant in 1915, he returned to the Cubs as their player-manager in 1916, his final season in MLB.

Tinker returned to minor league baseball as a part-owner and manager for the Columbus Senators before moving to Orlando, Florida, to manage the Orlando Tigers. While in Orlando, Tinker developed a real estate firm, which thrived during the Florida land boom of the 1920s. However, the 1926 Miami hurricane and Great Depression cost Tinker most of his fortune, and he returned to professional baseball in the late 1930s.

With the Cubs, Tinker was a part of a great double-play combination with teammates Johnny Evers and Frank Chance that was immortalized as &quot;Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance&quot; in the poem &quot;Baseball&#x27;s Sad Lexicon&quot;. However, Evers and Tinker feuded off the field. Tinker was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946, the same year as Evers and Chance. He has also been honored by the Florida State League and the city of Orlando.

==Early life==
Tinker was born in Muscotah, Kansas. His twin sister died at a young age. When Tinker was two, his family moved to Kansas City, Kansas. There, he began to play baseball for his school&#x27;s team when he was 14 years old. He played in semi-professional baseball for Hagen&#x27;s Tailors in 1898, winning the city championship. In 1899, he played for a team based in Parsons, Kansas, until it disbanded. He then joined a team representing Coffeyville, Kansas, as a third baseman, for the remainder of the year.

Tinker started his professional baseball career in 1900, at the age of 19, when Billy Hulen, a teammate of Tinker&#x27;s with the Coffeyville squad, recommended him to George Tebeau, the manager of the Denver Grizzlies of the Western League. Playing as a second baseman for Denver, Tinker batted .219 in his first 32 games. Tebeau sold Tinker to the Great Falls Indians of the Montana State League in June. Great Falls sold Tinker to the Helena Senators, also in the Montana State League, for $200 later in the season due to the team&#x27;s financial insolvency.

In 1901, Tinker batted .290 for the Portland Webfoots of the Pacific Northwest League as their third baseman. He led the league with 37 stolen bases. Receiving interest from the Chicago Cubs and the Cincinnati Reds of the National League (NL), Tinker decided on the Cubs when teammate Jack McCarthy told him that he felt mistreated from his time with the Reds.

When he purchased Tinker&#x27;s contract, Cubs manager Frank Selee was seeking a replacement at shortstop for Barry McCormick, who had joined the St. Louis Browns of the rival American League. Tinker won the job during spring training. As a rookie in 1902, Tinker batted .261, but also led NL shortstops with 72 errors. Johnny Evers, also a rookie, played second base for the Cubs. With Frank Chance, the team&#x27;s first baseman, the trio first played together on September 13, 1902, and collaborated on their first double play on September 15.

In the 1903 season, Tinker&#x27;s batting average improved to .291, and he also contributed 70 RBIs. Tinker led all NL shortstops in the 1906 season with a .944 fielding percentage. On September 14, 1905, Tinker and Evers engaged in a fistfight on the field because Evers had taken a cab to the stadium and left his teammates behind in the hotel lobby. They did not speak for years following this event.
Tinker led all shortstops in the NL in double plays turned in the 1905 season. Led by Tinker, Evers and Chance, the Cubs had a 116–36 win–loss record in the 1906 season, a record for victories that only was matched by the Seattle Mariners in the 2001 season, in which the Mariners played ten more games than the 1906 Cubs. Tinker batted .167 in the 1906 World Series as the Chicago White Sox defeated the Cubs in six games. Prior to the 1907 season, Tinker underwent surgery for appendicitis. Tinker batted only .154 in the 1907 World Series, but the Cubs defeated the Detroit Tigers in five games.

In the 1908 season, Tinker played all 157 games on the Cubs&#x27; schedule. In addition to batting .266, he led the team with 146 hits, six home runs, 14 triples, and a .391 slugging percentage. He also led the league with 570 assists. In the game characterized by Merkle&#x27;s Boner, Tinker hit an inside-the-park home run against Christy Mathewson of the New York Giants, prior to Fred Merkle&#x27;s baserunning gaffe. In the 1908 NL playoff game, which was a replay of the Merkle game, Tinker hit a leadoff triple off of Mathewson in the third inning, which ignited a four-run rally that helped Chicago to clinch the pennant. Tinker then batted .263 as the Cubs defeated the Tigers in the 1908 World Series in five games. Tinker also hit a home run off of Bill Donovan, the first home run hit in a World Series following the 1905 rules agreement.

In 1909, Tinker, who earned $1,500, demanded a $2,500 salary. He accepted a $200 raise. The Cubs reached the 1910 World Series, and though Tinker batted .333 in the series, the Cubs lost to the Philadelphia Athletics in five games. Following the 1910 season, Tinker threatened to quit the Cubs and play baseball in Australia over a salary dispute.

Tinker led the NL with 486 assists in the 1911 season and led all shortstops in putouts with 333. In August 1911, Chance suspended Tinker for the remainder of the season for using profanity, though he was reinstated two days later.

Garry Herrmann, the owner of the Reds, identified Tinker as an ideal candidate to become his player-manager for the 1912 season. According to Tinker, shareholders of the Reds approached Tinker about his interest in the job, and he then met with Charles W. Murphy, the Cubs&#x27; owner, and Chance, then serving as the Cubs&#x27; manager. They forbade him from taking the role with Cincinnati, which left Tinker unhappy. Herrmann began to listen to entreaties from his players, who wanted to retain Clark Griffith as manager, but decided to hire Hank O&#x27;Day. In the 1912 season, Tinker had a .282 batting average, and scored 80 runs and recorded 75 RBIs, both career records. He again led the league in putouts by a shortstop, with 354. Tinker finished in fourth place in the Chalmers Award voting following the season, behind Larry Doyle, Honus Wagner, and Chief Meyers.

===Cincinnati Reds===

Murphy named Evers the new manager of the Cubs for the 1913 season. Tinker did not want to play for Evers and met with Murphy and Evers to discuss his transfer to the Reds. Murphy was unhappy with Tinker&#x27;s high salary demands, which led him to agree to trade Tinker to the Cincinnati Reds in December 1912. The Reds received Tinker, Harry Chapman and Grover Lowdermilk in exchange for Red Corriden, Bert Humphries, Pete Knisely, Mike Mitchell, and Art Phelan. He signed a contract for an undisclosed salary.

Tinker missed several weeks during the 1913 season when he gave blood for his wife&#x27;s blood transfusion. Tinker finished the season with a .317 batting average, .445 slugging percentage, and a .968 fielding percentage, all career highs, in 110 games. However, the Reds as a team struggled, finishing the season with a 64–89 win–loss record. Due to the Reds&#x27; struggles, Herrmann challenged Tinker&#x27;s managerial style and sought his resignation. Tinker refused to resign.

===Chicago Whales and Cubs===
In October 1913, Tinker and Herrmann conferred, leading to Tinker signing a contract to remain the Reds manager for the 1914 season. However, Herrmann fired Tinker in November, leaving him to seek a contract from another team. Tinker complained that Herrmann did not seek his input on player transactions, while Herrmann charged that Tinker did not accept his authority.

Charles Ebbets, owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers, viewed Tinker as a good replacement for the released Bob Fisher, their shortstop in 1913. The Cubs, Giants, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Philadelphia Phillies were also interested in acquiring Tinker. Ebbets secured Tinker&#x27;s release from the Reds for $15,000, with another $10,000 to be paid to Tinker. The teams also agreed to swap players, with Earl Yingling and Herbie Moran going to Cincinnati and Dick Egan joining Brooklyn. Ebbets entered contract negotiations with Tinker.

However, Tinker never received the $10,000 promised to him by Ebbets. He insisted on a $10,000 salary for the 1914 season, higher than the $5,000 Brooklyn was willing to pay. Tinker was willing to accept a three-year contract if it paid $7,500 per season. Tinker decided to jump to the Federal League rather than sign with Brooklyn, signing a three-year contract worth $36,000. He was considered the first &quot;star&quot; player to jump to the Federal League, though he signed with the Federal League the same day as Mordecai Brown.

Joining the Chicago Federals (later known as the Whales) in the Federal League, Tinker served as player-manager. In his role, he signed other major league players to the Federal League, though he could not lure American League pitchers Walter Johnson from the Washington Senators or Smoky Joe Wood from the Boston Red Sox. The Whales drew more fans than the Cubs in those two seasons. The Whales finished in second place in 1914, with Tinker batting .259 despite suffering a broken rib during the season. Tinker tore a muscle in May 1915, ending his season prematurely. With Tinker managing, the Whales won the pennant in 1915. However, the league folded after the 1915 season.

Charles Weeghman, the owner of the Whales, purchased the Cubs and consolidated his two Chicago rosters, retaining Tinker as his manager. Due to the high combined salaries of the Cubs and Whales, which included Brown and Roger Bresnahan, Tinker was tasked with releasing extraneous players from their contracts. He served as the player-manager of the Cubs for the 1916 season.

===Career summary===

Tinker was the starting shortstop for the Chicago Cubs from 1902 to 1912. He was a speedy runner, stealing an average of 28 bases a season and even stealing home twice in one game on July 28, 1910. He also excelled at fielding, often leading the National League in a number of statistical categories (including four times in fielding percentage). During his decade with the Cubs, they went to the World Series four times, winning in 1907 and 1908.

Despite being just an average hitter, batting .268 for his career in an era of high batting averages, Tinker had a good amount of success against fellow Hall of Famer Christy Mathewson, batting .350 against the Hall of Fame pitcher over his career. In Mathewson&#x27;s 1912 book, &quot;Pitching in a Pinch&quot;, he referred to Tinker as &quot;the worst man I have to face in the National League.&quot;

Tinker is perhaps best known for the &quot;Tinker to Evers to Chance&quot; double play combination in the poem &quot;Baseball&#x27;s Sad Lexicon&quot;, written by the &quot;New York Evening Mail&quot; newspaper columnist Franklin Pierce Adams in July 1910. The poem was written as a lamentation from the perspective of a New York Giants fan on how the team is consistently defeated by the Chicago Cubs.

Tinker was also noted as a fighter. In addition to fighting Evers, Tinker defeated Egan in a fight after a game and fought Rabbit Maranville during a game. In 1908, he was arrested for assault when he got into a fight with a fan at a saloon he owned. He was acquitted of the charge.

==Later life==
In December 1916, Tinker became part-owner of the Columbus Senators of the American Association, with Thomas E. Wilson serving as the principal owner. The duo paid $65,000 for 75% ownership of the team. Tinker also served as the team&#x27;s manager. He allowed Grover Hartley to succeed him as manager in 1919 and chose Bill Clymer to manage the team for the 1920 season, leading Hartley to request a trade.

Tinker&#x27;s wife continued to suffer through poor health, so Tinker sold his interest in the Columbus team after the 1920 season and moved to Orlando, Florida. Tinker became owner and manager of the Orlando Tigers of the Florida State League. The team became known as the &quot;Tinker Tigers&quot; and won the league&#x27;s championship. Tinker also scouted for the Reds. Tinker&#x27;s wife committed suicide on Christmas Day, 1923, with a revolver during an apparent nervous breakdown. He remarried in 1926, to Mary Ross Eddington of Orlando. Jack Hendricks of the Reds served as Tinker&#x27;s best man. He married his third wife, Susanna Margaret Chabot, in 1942.

Tinker ended his involvement in professional baseball, focusing instead on his real estate ventures during the Florida land boom of the 1920s. He developed a successful real estate firm, buying and selling land in Orange County and Seminole County. He purchased the Longwood Hotel, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places, in 1926. Tinker convinced Reds owner Garry Herrmann to use his stadium in Orlando for their spring training site in 1923.

Tinker made up to $250,000 in his real estate business. However, his fortunes began to change in 1926, when the stock market receded and the 1926 Miami hurricane damaged significant areas of South Florida. During the Great Depression, he was forced to liquidate most of his real estate holdings. Tinker owned a billiard parlor during the Depression. He opened one of Orlando&#x27;s first bars after the end of Prohibition. He also returned to baseball. Tinker scouted the Philadelphia Athletics&#x27; hitters for the Cubs prior to the 1929 World Series.

During the 1930 season, Tinker returned to baseball as a coach for the Buffalo Bisons of the International League, who were managed by Clymer. Tinker became the manager of the Jersey City Skeeters of the International League after the dismissal of Nick Allen in August. The owner of the Springfield Ponies of the Eastern League attempted to convince Tinker to manage his team in 1931. Tinker assumed managerial duties for the Orlando Gulls in mid-May 1937, succeeding Nelson Leach. However, he resigned the position in July of that year, as the team was unable to pay his salary. During World War II, Tinker worked at Orlando Air Force Base as a boiler inspector.

According to some tellings, Tinker and Evers did not speak to one another again following their fight for 33 years, until they were asked to participate in the radio broadcast of the 1938 World Series, played between the Cubs and the New York Yankees. Neither Tinker nor Evers knew the other had been invited. However, in 1929, Tinker joined with Evers in signing a 10-week contract to perform a theatrical skit on baseball in different cities across the United States.
Tinker had serious health problems in his later life. Complications of diabetes mellitus and Bright&#x27;s disease left Tinker near death in 1936, when his physician believed he had 24 hours to live, and 1944, when he was placed in an oxygen tent. However, he returned to health and scouted minor league players for the Boston Braves in 1946. Tinker developed an infection relating to diabetes that in 1947 required the amputation of a toe and persisted until his left leg above the knee was amputated as well. Tinker died at Orange Memorial Hospital in Orlando on July 27, 1948, his 68th birthday, of complications from diabetes. He was buried in Greenwood Cemetery and survived by his four children.

==Honors==
Tinker was elected into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946. Evers and Chance were inducted that same year. Local leaders in Orlando held a testimonial dinner in his honor in 1947.

Tinker Field, a former stadium once in the shadow of Camping World Stadium (previously known as the Citrus Bowl), and the Tinker Building, Tinker&#x27;s office in Orlando, are on the National Register of Historic Places. Tinker was posthumously inducted into the Florida State League Hall of Fame in 2009, in its inaugural class.

<text>Elizabeth Corday, M.B.B.S., F.R.C.S. (married name Greene) is a fictional character in the medical drama series &quot;ER,&quot; portrayed by British actress Alex Kingston. She first appeared at the beginning of the fourth season and became a lead character before departing towards the start of the eleventh season.

Kingston returned to make two further guest appearances in the final season of the show.

==Background==
First appearing at the opening of season four in the episode &quot;Ambush&quot;, Elizabeth Corday is a British surgeon who has moved to Chicago to gain more experience in trauma surgery. We learn in her first episode that she comes from a whole family of surgeons; Corday&#x27;s grandfather was a surgeon, as is her father and, since there are no boys in her family, she took on that role. In a later episode we learn that her father is a Consultant surgeon at St. Thomas&#x27; Hospital, London. Corday&#x27;s mother (played by Judy Parfitt) is an astrophysicist with whom she has a rather rocky relationship; Corday feels that her mother didn&#x27;t spend enough time with her as a girl and that she was &quot;raised by nannies and boarding schools&quot;, although she finds a more nuanced perspective on things once she becomes a mother herself. Though the two do seem to come to some kind of mutual agreement, the relationship is still strained. However, Elizabeth has a good relationship with her father, Charles (although he is hostile towards her mother, having been divorced over ten years prior).

Corday faces many problems in adjusting to the United States. During her first trauma surgery, she completely baffles the rest of the staff by using many British terms not used in America - for example, she asks them to &quot;bleep Benton&quot; (page Dr. Peter Benton), order an &quot;FBC&quot; (American term &quot;CBC&quot;), and perform a &quot;tube thoracostomy&quot; (American term &quot;chest tube&quot;). She also introduces herself as &quot;Miss Corday&quot;, as is customary for members of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, and not &quot;Dr Corday&quot;. She nevertheless becomes popular among the other staff, both for her surgical skill and for her personality. She quickly gains a reputation for being unimpressed by status, an example being when she greets one eminent surgeon, Dr. Sam Breedlove, with &quot;I knew you were old, but I didn&#x27;t know you were so short!&quot; Luckily Breedlove responded in the positive (citing that he&#x27;s always been short).

She befriends many of the female ER staff, including Carol Hathaway and Dr. Anna del Amico; and later on Abby Lockhart and Susan Lewis. Despite her arrogant and opinionated exterior, she has a deeply caring side to her - she is there to provide support at critical moments for both staff and patients alike. Despite their long and adversarial history, she supports Robert Romano through the ordeal with the loss of his arm; and similarly she overcomes her deep dislike of Kerry Weaver to be supportive of her following the death of her partner Sandy Lopez, although they never really mend fences and this plays a large part in her exit from County. Corday is also very good friends with John Carter. However, Corday can also be extremely harsh in criticizing her fellow physicians, such as when she berated David Malucci for abandoning his med student with a patient.

Because of the strong ties she has made with Chicago, Corday decides to stay on after her fellowship is terminated, even though this means that she has to repeat her internship in order to get a license to practice in the United States during Season 5. This is a particularly trying time for her - she has to adjust to being at the bottom of the heap after enjoying so long at the top, and on top of that she is supervised initially by Dale Edson - described even by Romano as a weasel. During this time, she makes repeated attempts to become romantically involved with Benton, eventually succeeding. He even agrees to take over as her supervisor after a while. She faces further trouble when, at the end of a 36-hour shift, she makes a non-lethal mistake in calculating how much drug to inject into a patient. Fortunately, this doesn&#x27;t put her off her stride, and she uses it to campaign for better conditions for junior medical staff. She also amicably ends her romantic relationship with Peter after that (while Eriq La Salle requested the relationship be written out saying: &quot;As an African-American man, it becomes a bit offensive if the negative things are all you&#x27;re showing. Because in real life we romance and get on each other&#x27;s nerves and laugh and do all the things that any other race of people do. So if the only time you show a balanced relationship is in an interracial relationship, whether it&#x27;s conscious or sub-conscious, it sends a message I&#x27;m not comfortable with.&quot; Alex did not find issues with it, citing as follows: &quot;[Y]ou see interracial relationships all over the place [outside America]. I kind of naively thought it would be even more liberal in America. And it couldn&#x27;t have been further from the truth. In fact, I&#x27;m trying to think if there&#x27;s a television show right now [in 2013] where there&#x27;s an African American and Caucasian relationship. They&#x27;re few and far between.&quot;). However, the affair ends up haunting her later on when Dr. Maggie Doyle correctly accuses Dr. Romano of sexual harassment after he finds out she was gay and gives her a bad performance review; Elizabeth wants to go on the record to support Maggie&#x27;s claims, but is forced to back down when Romano reveals he&#x27;d known she was dating Peter secretly while he was her supervisor.

After completing her internship at the end of Season 5, at the start of Season 6 Corday is offered the position of Associate Chief of Surgery by newly appointed Chief of Staff Romano, who announces the appointment without even asking her. She takes the job, however, and soon finds herself getting caught up in hospital politics. Despite her attempts to get along, a rift soon develops between her and Cleo Finch, Benton&#x27;s new love interest.

In season 6, Corday saves the life of serial rapist and killer who starts to engage her in a series of mind games. When a victim&#x27;s family wants to learn of their daughter&#x27;s body&#x27;s location, the killer manipulates Corday into euthanizing him in exchange for the location. At the last minute, Corday realizes that the killer was afraid of her for the power that she held over him and she spares his life, breaking his will and &#x27;winning the game&#x27;.

==Corday and Greene&#x27;s marriage==
Corday becomes romantically involved with Dr. Mark Greene during season 5, and in season 7 finds out that she is pregnant with his child. They marry and name their daughter Ella.

However, Corday&#x27;s marriage to Greene is difficult for both parties. Corday faces struggles at work after she is sued for allegedly rushing an operation (leading to paralysis of the patient), and her pregnancy is nearly compromised when she goes into labor whilst on scene at a train wreck. Greene is diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor, but is given hope of a reprieve though, when Greene finds a surgeon in New York who can remove the tumor. Corday accompanies Greene to New York City and is present in the operating room for the procedure, by his side all the time. The couple later get married (after a series of glitches with the transport for both parties) and appear to be very happy. Corday is heavily pregnant at the time of the wedding, and gives birth to baby, Ella, a short time later.

This happiness is not maintained for very long, however - Greene&#x27;s daughter Rachel (from his marriage to Jen) has by now grown from a nice child into a troublesome teenager. After falling out with Jen, Rachel moves in with Greene, Corday and baby Ella. Things are not much better for her there, though - she and Corday are constantly arguing, culminating eventually in Ella swallowing ecstasy that belonged to Rachel. Corday is so furious that she tells Rachel to leave the house, and after Mark refuses to send Rachel back to Jen, or press charges, Corday moves out instead, taking Ella with her.

When Susan Lewis returns to County General after five years, Corday seems to be at odds with her. She is cautious because of the relationship that Susan and Mark once had. After Mark&#x27;s death, the two strike up a friendship.

At about the same time, Greene learns that the tumor has returned, and that this time it was inoperable. She indirectly finds out about Mark&#x27;s plight from Susan (who doesn&#x27;t outright say Mark&#x27;s cancer is back, but makes it so obvious that Elizabeth gets it), and her half-hearted initial claim to him that she&#x27;ll come back home is rejected by Mark, with him saying he doesn&#x27;t want her to return on account of his terminal illness. Elizabeth later has a medical case hit close to home (a selfish woman&#x27;s sister refuses to agree to a life-saving liver transplant procedure) and after getting a dose-of-reality from speaking to Romano, Corday does move back in with him and Rachel. Greene eventually leaves Chicago to spend his final days with his daughter in Hawaii. On the walk home after a day of surfing, Mark suffers a seizure and in a panic, Rachel calls Elizabeth, who arrives in Hawaii soon after with Ella. The four spend Mark&#x27;s last few days bonding and overcoming obstacles. Corday tells Rachel after the funeral that it would be all right for her to visit her sister, and later on she does so and Elizabeth bemusedly helps Rachel acquire birth control pills when her stepdaughter shows up with her teenage boyfriend. Elizabeth&#x27;s tension with her stepdaughter seems to be over at this point; she helps Rachel without question, and Rachel does not judge the fact that Elizabeth is dating again, saying that Mark would have wanted her to find someone and that they both miss him.

==Aftermath==
After Greene&#x27;s death, Corday returns to England for several weeks, but she finds that she can no longer fit in after having been in the United States for so long, suffering bullying and sexist treatment at the hands of her British colleagues for her &#x27;American&#x27; ways.

Elizabeth returns to her job at County General soon after the start of season 9, where she becomes harsh with patients, curt with colleagues, and particularly clashes with med student Paul Nathan (Don Cheadle) who is trying to become a physician despite advancing Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Elizabeth later confronts her agony over Mark&#x27;s death and also makes peace with Nathan during a horrifying case where the wife and son of a decent man have been killed by a drunk driver, and they are able to save his other son by doing a transplant from the dying son. Corday is saddened to see Romano losing his career due to his arm amputation/reattachment. An even bigger blow hits Corday later during Season 10 when Robert Romano is killed in a helicopter accident. Later in the season, Dr. Corday is appointed to Chief of Surgery by Kerry Weaver.

In her love life, she has some trouble moving on and making the right choices. She begins a relationship with a charismatic surgeon, Dr. Dorset (Bruno Campos), which quickly ends when she discovers that he is married. Later, she begins seeing two men at the same time, another doctor at County (Paul Blackthorne) and a teacher (Steven Culp).

In Season 11, Elizabeth is angry that Kerry Weaver hired Dr. Lucien Dubenko to be a surgeon without consulting her (the Chief of Surgery), with Elizabeth noting that this was the only candidate she had expressly recommended against. Kerry is confused/irritated about Elizabeth&#x27;s problems and doesn&#x27;t understand why Elizabeth is &quot;taking this so personally.&quot; A sequence where Elizabeth calls Dubenko &quot;cowardly and cocky&quot; for not doing an illegal transplant, and rails about Kerry&#x27;s &quot;treachery and ambition&quot;, was in the original broadcast of the episode &quot;Try Carter&quot; but has been edited out of syndicated repeat showings. Elizabeth is convinced by Dr. John Carter to perform the illegal donation procedure between two HIV positive patients, because she believes the operation is the right thing to do and also because it&#x27;ll piss Kerry off (she also notes that a bill legalizing organ transplants between HIV+ individuals was approved by the Illinois state legislature and is stuck in bureaucratic limbo so the Governor hasn&#x27;t been able to sign it into law). Elizabeth does successfully perform the operation. This results in her facing the possibility of her losing her license and being dismissed from the staff. Weaver bluntly offers her the position of a clinical instructor with no possibility of tenure or future promotion, stating this was a compromise so that the hospital&#x27;s Board of Directors would close the case without referring her to the State&#x27;s Medical Review Board. With her career all but over at County, Corday quits her job and moves back to England. Corday&#x27;s final appearance as a series regular was in Season 11, episode 4 &quot;Fear&quot;.



== After County General ==
During the 15th and final season of &quot;ER&quot;, at the end of the episode &quot;The Book of Abby&quot;, long-serving nurse Haleh Adams shows the departing Abby Lockhart a closet wall where all the past doctors and employees have put their locker name tags. Amongst them, the tag &quot;Corday&quot; can be seen.

Elizabeth Corday returned to &quot;ER&quot; in the fifteenth season on January 15, 2009, in the episode &quot;Dream Runner&quot;, in a one-episode return billed as a special appearance. Dr. Corday comes to County General to interview potential employees, including the surprised Neela Rasgotra, for positions at Duke University. She tells Neela that she lived in England for a few years after leaving Chicago but came back to the United States where she took a position as Chief of Trauma Surgery at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, where she lives with nine-year-old Ella. Rachel too lives in Durham and attends Duke where she receives lowered tuition because Elizabeth is on faculty. During the interview, Elizabeth mentions having considered returning to County General briefly, but decided against it. She briefly meets Dr. Simon Brenner after finishing her interview with Neela.

In the series finale, Elizabeth and Rachel meet up with John Carter, Kerry Weaver, Susan Lewis, and Peter Benton after the opening of Carter&#x27;s project the Joshua Carter Center. After the reunion, Peter walks her to her car in a scene where the spark of their previous relationship and later friendship can be seen once more.

<text>Lucas is a 1986 American coming-of-age romantic-sports film written and directed by David Seltzer in his directorial debut, and starring Corey Haim, Kerri Green, Charlie Sheen, and Courtney Thorne-Smith. Thorne-Smith and Winona Ryder made their film debuts in &quot;Lucas&quot;.

==Plot==
Lucas Blye is a 14-year-old high school student in suburban Chicago. He becomes acquainted with Maggie, an attractive older girl who has just moved to town, on one of his entomological quests. Becoming friends, Maggie spends time with him during the summer until school begins.

Lucas, a frequent victim of bullying, has a protector of sorts in Cappie Roew, an older student and a football player. Cappie was one of Lucas&#x27; tormentors until he contracted hepatitis and Lucas brought him his homework every day, ensuring that Cappie did not have to repeat a year of school.

Maggie becomes a cheerleader for the football team to get closer to Cappie, on whom she has a crush. Angered by her inattention towards him, Lucas chastises her, dismissing her cheerleading as &quot;superficial&quot; and incorrectly believing she will be his date to an upcoming school dance.

On the night of the dance, Cappie is dumped by his girlfriend Alise due to his attraction to Maggie. Cappie finds comfort with Maggie at her house to the chagrin of Lucas, who arrives to pick her up for the dance. Even though Cappie and Maggie invite him out for pizza, he rebukes them and rides off on his bike.

Rina, one of Lucas&#x27; friends, encounters him sitting alone, watching the dance from across the lake. Although she has feelings for Lucas, she puts them aside to console him about he and Maggie being &quot;from two different worlds&quot;. On the way home, Lucas rides by the pizza parlor and is crushed to see Maggie and Cappie kissing.

In an attempt to impress Maggie and gain respect, Lucas joins the football team. In the shower after practice, he endures a prank from his tormentors Bruno and Spike. At the end of the day, Lucas flees in embarrassment, and Maggie chases him to talk. When she tells him that she wants him to be her friend, Lucas tries to kiss her. Maggie recoils, and a heartbroken Lucas screams at her to leave.

The next day at the football game, Lucas sneaks onto the field despite being removed from the team for lack of parental consent. He is seriously injured after being tackled without his helmet and is rushed to the hospital. Maggie, Cappie, and Rina attempt to contact Lucas&#x27; parents. Correcting Maggie&#x27;s misguided impression that Lucas lives in the luxurious house where she has seen him several times, Rina shows them that Lucas&#x27; home is a dilapidated trailer in a junkyard where Lucas lives with his alcoholic father, who is a gardener at the large house.

Meanwhile, Lucas&#x27; schoolmates hold vigil in the hospital as he recuperates. Maggie visits him and sternly tells him never to play football again. Lucas promises, and they reconcile, picking up their friendship. They speculate as to where they will be when the locusts return in 17 years; both hope that they will still be in touch.

Lucas returns to school after his recovery and opens his locker to find a varsity letter jacket with his name and number on the back. Bruno starts to clap slowly, and everyone else in the hallway applauds in sync as Lucas raises his arms triumphantly and smiles.

<doc id="711106" wikidata="Q7582007" url="?curid=711106" title="Square Dance (film)">
<text>Square Dance (television broadcast title: Home Is Where the Heart Is) is a 1987 American coming-of-age drama film directed by Daniel Petrie from a screenplay by Alan Hines, based on his novel of the same name. The film stars Jason Robards, Jane Alexander, Winona Ryder, and Rob Lowe, and was released on February 20, 1987, by Island Pictures. It earned Lowe his only Golden Globe Award nomination for a film role.

==Plot==

Gemma Dillard is a 13-year-old country girl who lives with her Grandpa Dillard on a farm in the Texas Panhandle. Gemma is visited by her mother, who lives in Fort Worth, with an offer to come stay with her in the city. Her mother (who had Gemma when she was still only a teenager) is now married with a job as a hair stylist and can provide for her.

Gemma at first experiences slight culture shock in regards to big city life, but soon comes to accept her new surroundings. She becomes acquainted with a man with an intellectual disability, 21-year-old Rory Torrance. They play together, hang out together, and imagine that they are married.

The story focuses on a series of bittersweet experiences that eventually return Gemma to the country.

==Cast==

==Production==
After coming across the Alan Hines novel &quot;Square Dance&quot;, Charles Haid who was looking to move into film production decided the book would make a good film. Haid brought the project to Jane Alexander who agreed to star and executive produce the film, with the two in turn bringing in Daniel Petrie to direct who collaborated with Hines in adapting the novel to film. After an initial financing deal with FilmDallas fell through, Michael Nesmith of The Monkees put up $2.5 million through his production company Pacific Arts Pictures while Haid was able to secure the remaining $1.5 million from NBC as Haid was friends with then NBC President Brandon Tartikoff and was starring in the network&#x27;s popular &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;.

===Casting===
Emilio Estevez was initially slated to play the role of Rory, however when the opportunity came for Estevez to direct, write, and star in &quot;Wisdom&quot;, Estevez left the project and passed the script along to his friend Rob Lowe. Lowe had his manager accept the part and accepted one-twentieth his usual salary. In order to convincingly portray the intellectually disabled Rory, Lowe attended adult special needs classes and spent four days working with a speech therapist to perfect the slurred manner of speaking he would use for the audition.

Gregory Peck had initially been cast as Grandpa Dillard, but dropped out and was replaced by Jason Robards.

==Reception==
&quot;Square Dance&quot; received mixed reviews from critics and was a box office bomb. However, Lowe was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; cited Lowe&#x27;s performance as &quot;arresting&quot;, while Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; felt that Lowe&#x27;s character of Rory was &quot;played with extraordinary sweetness&quot;. Roger Ebert called it &quot;a weary morality play that sinks under the weight of its good intentions.&quot;

On April 17, 1988, the film aired on NBC under the title &quot;Home Is Where the Heart Is&quot;. One of the members of the Bayou Band as seen in the film was Trace Adkins who, in 1996, would have the first of more than 20 country hits.

<doc id="711109" wikidata="Q3713536" url="?curid=711109" title="St Eunan's College">
<text>St Eunan&#x27;s College ( ; ), known locally as The College to distinguish it from the cathedral and GAA club, is a voluntary Roman Catholic all-male, English-medium secondary day school (and former boarding school) in County Donegal, Ireland. It is located upon Sentry Hill in Letterkenny. Named after Adomnán or Eunan (the Abbot of Iona who was native to Tír Chonaill, mainly modern County Donegal, and is patron saint of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Raphoe), the school&#x27;s foundation stone was laid on the patron saint&#x27;s feast day of 23 September.

Its buildings and grounds include the College Chapel, a medial courtyard and playing fields. Architectural features include four turreted round towers and flying buttresses which are modelled on the nearby Cathedral. Sporadic extensions have occurred, including during the early 1930s and the late 1970s – science laboratories and a demonstration room were added in between these two periods of major building work. A monkey puzzle tree grows on the front lawn close to the front door and the College Chapel. Those men who have attended the college are termed Old Adomnánians ().

Sportsmen educated there include Olympic athletes, Mark English (a middle-distance runner) and Philip Deignan (a cyclist who later turned professional), as well as several current county footballers, among whom are Michael Murphy, Shaun Patton and Niall O&#x27;Donnell. Several members of Cabinet were educated here, including Pa O&#x27;Donnell, Neil Blaney and Jim McDaid. Others educated there include quiz player Pat Gibson (&quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;, &quot;Mastermind&quot;, &quot;Brain of Britain&quot;, &quot;Mastermind Champion of Champions&quot;, &quot;Eggheads&quot;), actor Ray McAnally and lexicographer Niall Ó Dónaill.

The college has a tradition since its foundation of hosting musicals, operas, operettas and other performances. Its current principal is Damien McCroary. The All-Ireland-winning Gaelic footballer, Colm McFadden, serves as his deputy. Other staff members (past and present) include Ollie Horgan, Gary McDaid, Charlie McGeever and John Wilson, who later served as Tánaiste. It accommodates close to 1,000 students and increases its numbers year-on-year.

==History==
===Antecedent institutions: 1700s–1800s===
Anthony Coyle, the first Bishop of Raphoe to take up residence in Letterkenny, established a classical academy during the eighteenth century. Then, in the following century, Bishop Patrick McGettigan appointed a priest as a teacher of Greek, Latin and mathematics at a building on Castle Street in 1825. The school was abandoned by the mid-1830s due to a priest shortage and a professor having died. A further school followed during the 1830s, close to the current college, though it too was short-lived, as was another school in the town during the 1840s.

In 1849, Bishop McGettigan approved the setting up of a school in the Literary Institute; this would become known as the &quot;Old Seminary&quot; and the &quot;Latin School&quot;. This was the final school before the college was established and the longest lasting of its antecedents. Run independently for three decades, in 1879 the Bishop formally placed it under the management of the Catholic Church after the last of various doctors and other men, who had until then run the school, died prematurely. The recently ordained Edward Maguire, then aged 24, was appointed president. Maguire had, by the 1880s, been sent to Maynooth. Patrick McCaffery succeeded him as president; he, in his turn, was succeeded by P. J. Brennan in 1889. J. J. O&#x27;Doherty succeeded Brennan as president; O&#x27;Doherty then gave way to the last president of the Old Seminary, Hugh Gallagher.

As scholar numbers began to outgrow the facilities available at the Literary Institute, Bishop of Raphoe Patrick O&#x27;Donnell sought to establish a boarding school to provide a classical education. The college was established as a minor seminary to prepare young men for the priesthood of the Catholic Church. Diocesan colleges experienced an increasingly favoured stature at the time and were set up to give an unrivalled Catholic education to boys of every class. The college&#x27;s motto, &quot;In hoc signo vinces&quot;, meaning &quot;by this sign – (the Cross) – you shall conquer&quot; is derived from the episcopal motto of O&#x27;Donnell.

===Foundation, fire and the national grid: 1904–1944===
In 1904, the college&#x27;s foundation stone was laid on the feast of St Eunan (23 September). Priests from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Raphoe gathered money from around the world for its erection. The college opened in September 1906, with Edward Maguire as its first president. Latin, Greek and history were taught. Maguire remained as president of the college until 1910 when he was sent to another parish.

Michael Ward succeeded Maguire as president; he had been at the college since its opening four years previously and served as president until his sudden death aged 41 in 1919. During The Rev Ward&#x27;s Presidency, a student died in 1912 and there was a fire in the college.

Patrick D. McCaul became the third president of the college; he too had taught there since its opening but had been appointed to the cathedral parish in 1918, only to be brought back after Ward&#x27;s death. McCaul&#x27;s tenure, which lasted until he was sent to another parish in 1929, coincided with increased student registrations and made an extension to the college much needed. This was built in the early 1930s during the tenure of John Kerr, the only president of the college to succeed to the presidency without having been a member of the teaching staff — until, that is, the arrival of Christopher Darby from Ballyshannon&#x27;s Coláiste Cholmcille in 2009. Kerr&#x27;s tenure lasted until 1944, at which time he was sent to another part of the county. Kerr&#x27;s presidency included the college&#x27;s Silver Jubilee in 1931 and, like Ward before him and others later (Carney, McCroary), coincided with the death of a student; in this case he was brought to the district hospital in pain in October 1933, but died on 7 October. The same year (1933), the college was connected to the ESB national grid for the first time. Until that time, it had obtained electricity from a system McCaul had near the college&#x27;s handball alleys.

===Chapel, opera, telescope and playing field: 1944–1971===
Arthur McLoone was the college&#x27;s fifth president and the first to have studied at the college (beginning in 1911). A classical scholar, he taught Latin and Greek, served as dean and as bursar and involved himself in the college&#x27;s annual opera; he had a special fondness for the operettas of Gilbert and Sullivan. His ten-year presidency of the college is noted for the development of the first playing field opposite the college and the new College Chapel which was finished in 1952. He was noted for his administrative ability. Sent away to Killybegs in mid-1954. McLoone&#x27;s death came all of a sudden during celebrations for the college&#x27;s Golden Jubilee in 1956.

Christopher Finnegan, sixth president of the college, was with its founder Cardinal O&#x27;Donnell on his death in 1927. He taught English, had been vice president of the college since 1944 and worked with McLoone in the staging of his beloved Gilbert and Sullivan operettas. A gifted preacher and eloquent orator, he oversaw the building of the Recreation Hall in 1958, before dying in office aged 61 in December 1960.

Daniel J. Cunnea (known as &quot;The Doc&quot;), seventh president of the college, was also educated there. After completing a doctorate and spending some time working at Knockbeg College, he joined the St Eunan&#x27;s staff in 1942 as a teacher of science and mathematics. With Finnegan having just suddenly died, e Cunnea was propelled into the presidency in January 1961. Noted for his use of a telescope to study the night sky, he oversaw improvements in the college&#x27;s science facilities, including two science laboratories and a demonstration room in 1964, before being sent to a remote village in another part of the county in 1969.

Peter McMahon, eighth president of the college, had, like his predecessor, been educated there and joined the staff in 1953, holding the posts of Dean and Bursar (just as McLoone had before him). McMahon was president for two years, bridging the gap between the 1960s and 1970s. Though sent to administer a nearby rural parish, he remained as a member of staff and taught mathematics at the college until 1981.

===&quot;Free education&quot; and demise of boarding: 1971–present===
Austin Laverty, ninth president of the college, had also studied there and, like McLoone and McMahon, held the posts of Dean and Bursar. Appointed to the presidency in 1971, he steered the college through the difficult years that followed the introduction of &quot;free education&quot; by Donogh O&#x27;Malley, who made the decision without consulting his colleagues in cabinet. With a growing population of children to be accommodated, the curriculum overhauled, and classical subjects demoted to suit the needs of the less able, the less academic child introduced to the realities of an advanced secondary education, an extension to the college was required by the mid-1970s. Work got underway in 1977, ended in 1979, and the &quot;New Building&quot; was inaugurated in 1981, the 75th anniversary of the college&#x27;s foundation. Laverty began improvements to the college&#x27;s boarding facilities but departed in January 1982 to become cathedral parish administrator.

Daniel Carr, tenth president of the college, studied there too and joined the staff. During nearly seven years as president, Carr continued improvements begun under his predecessor and encouraged the college&#x27;s first computer network of BBCs (a first for the county). The first computer in the school was an Apple II. Edward Harvey was the teacher who began a computer club at the college in 1980. With the number of boarders declining under Carr&#x27;s presidency, some dormitories could be turned into classrooms. In 1988, Carr was sent to the same remote village in another part of the county as Cunnea (who had retired), though Carr recovered to receive the title of monsignor.

Cathal O&#x27;Fearrai, eleventh president of the college, had been recalled from Dublin in 1982 by Bishop of Raphoe Séamus Hegarty and posted to the college&#x27;s teaching staff. Six years later he became president, overseeing the creation of a computer laboratory, an all-weather pitch, and a front playing field. With the development of secondary schools in the county, the number of boarders at the college continued to decline and in 1992 the college&#x27;s boarding wing was shut. This allowed the president to create a library and more classrooms from the last available boarding facilities, an achievement completed before he was sent away in 1996.

Michael Carney, twelfth president of the college, like many of his predecessors studied there. He was the college&#x27;s organist and assistant director of the college&#x27;s choir (1980–83) before being appointed to the college&#x27;s teaching staff in 1989–90, teaching history, music, and religion, until assuming the presidency in 1996. As president, Carney accompanied students and teachers of the German language to Vienna, Austria in 1999. Links with other continental schools were also developed, including a school in Perros-Guirec, Brittany in northwestern France. The annual ski trip began in 1997. Other events during Carney&#x27;s presidency included the separate deaths of, first, a student and, later, a member of the teaching staff — Antoin Ó Colla of Cloughaneely, who had taught Irish, history, and geography at the college since 1974 (the same year he graduated from University College Galway). In addition, the college celebrated its centenary year in 2006. Carney served as president of the college until 2009, taking up residency as priest at Ramelton where he was &quot;in situ&quot; when local scientist William Cecil Campbell won the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

In 2009, Christopher Darby, until that time vice-principal of Coláiste Cholmcille in Ballyshannon, became the first lay president of the college, taking over from Carney. He retired in 2019.

Damien McCroary, a teacher of religion and history from Doneyloop in Castlefin who joined the staff under Carney in 2002 and who had been Darby&#x27;s deputy since 2017, succeeded him. The All-Ireland-winning Gaelic footballer, Colm McFadden, was promptly appointed his deputy. As with several of his predecessors, McCroary had to deal with the death of a student. He also had to deal with a burglary and a viral pandemic, the latter of which shut the school for six months and caused all examinations to be cancelled. Then, when the school had reopened, the Government shut it and all others in the country for several months again at the start of the following year as the viral pandemic worsened.

===Silver Jubilee===
The college&#x27;s silver jubilee occurred in 1931 during Kerr&#x27;s presidency. The foundation stone for the college&#x27;s &quot;New Wing&quot; was laid on 23 September that year as part of the events held to mark the occasion. High Mass was held in the nearby cathedral, over which Kerr presided. In his sermon he noted that past students of the college had gone on to become priests or to work in civil or military professions.

A banquet was held that evening, at which a toast was proposed to the Bishop of Raphoe, William MacNeely and the hope expressed that he would be alive to witness the Golden Jubilee (he was).

The occasion also prompted the establishment of the past students&#x27; union. Its meeting and dinner would occur annually for many decades. It vanished during the 1960s.

===Golden Jubilee===
The college&#x27;s golden jubilee occurred in 1956 during Finnegan&#x27;s presidency. In April that year, Patrick Kerr, College President throughout the 1930s and the first half of the 1940s, and who had since risen to the rank of Archdeacon of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Raphoe, died. Events held on Wednesday, 26 September, marked the jubilee. According to the &quot;Derry People&quot;, &quot;close on three hundred past students...came from all parts of the country, and some from overseas, to do honour to their Alma Mater&quot;. One member of the original staff, Denis J. Murray, was still alive and present on the day. As with the earlier jubilee, High Mass was held in the nearby cathedral, this time presided over by a former member of staff, John McMackin (who had by then become a professor of English at the pontifical university of St Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth).

A banquet was held that evening in the study hall. According to &quot;The Irish Press&quot;, a telegram to Bishop MacNeely from the Pope, and which recognised the occasion, was read aloud to those in attendance. Among the other guests were Bishop of Derry Neil Farren and two former students – the then Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin and Minister for Local Government Pa O&#x27;Donnell. Also present was Finnegan&#x27;s predecessor as president, McLoone (based in Killybegs for the previous two years), who returned to Letterkenny on Tuesday 25 September 1956. After toasts to figures such as the Pope and bishop (the latter by Breslin) were offered, McLoone proposed a toast to Éire. He spoke in the Irish language for several minutes, then he died. He was promptly returned to Killybegs that same evening and interred that Friday following a requiem mass which was overseen by Bishop MacNeely and each priest of that diocese. A photograph of the golden jubilee group taken at the college&#x27;s front door features McLoone on the day of his death.

===Centenary===
The college&#x27;s centenary occurred in 2006 during Carney&#x27;s presidency. A weekend of events marked the occasion, beginning on Friday, 6 October, with an exhibition and the launch of the centenary booklet. Bishop of Derry Séamus Hegarty – a former student and, later, patron – opened the exhibition. On display were books, uniforms and other memorabilia. The exhibition included photographs of past and present staff and students, as well as the college&#x27;s sports teams. No presidential deaths are recorded during the event.

On the Saturday a sporting exhibition took place on the playing fields, including a veterans&#x27; football match, as well as a veterans&#x27; game of association football.

The traditional Mass in the nearby cathedral on these occasions was overseen by Bishop of Raphoe Philip Boyce on the Sunday. The Mount Errigal Hotel hosted a dinner dance that evening.

Head Boy for the centenary year was James McNicholl. Others present amongst the student body during the centenary year included (with class saint for year reference): Seniors: Mark McGowan (Francis), Ross Wherity (Fergal), John Logue (USI president; Fabian), Adrian Harmon (AA Roadwatch presenter; Finnian), Michael Murphy (Ernan), Antoin McFadden (Eithne), Seán McVeigh (Elizabeth) and Eamonn Doherty (Declan); Juniors: Cillian Morrison (Catherine), Mark English (two years before the Transition Year that would see him take up running; Benedict), Caolan Ward (Bartholemew), and Conor Parke (Albert).

Other events took place throughout the academic year. These culminated in the College Centenary Golf Classic at Letterkenny Golf Club on Sunday 8 April 2007. The professional golfer Paul McGinley – recently seen further south at the Ryder Cup, and whose father Mick studied at the college and was part of the 1956 MacRory Cup-winning team – launched the College Centenary Golf Classic. McGinley provided two prizes for the event: a set of TaylorMade golf clubs and one of his 2006 Ryder Cup sweaters.

==Governance==
The college was founded on a Roman Catholic basis, under the trusteeship of the Bishop of Raphoe. It serves approximately 900 students – from Letterkenny and its surrounding area – and is one of the few remaining all-male schools in northwestern Ireland.

From its foundation until 2004, a single manager oversaw the college. Government regulation of education obliged the college to comply with the terms of the 1998 Education Act and the Education and Welfare Act, 2000. In 2004 the college&#x27;s management structure was altered and a board of management established in place of the single manager.

The college continues to be under the trusteeship of the Bishop of Raphoe.

Women have been among the staff since 1929. Between 1929 and 1991, first requested by McCaul during his presidency, two Sisters of Mercy were appointed to the staff of the college. One of the women served as matron and tended to the health of the college&#x27;s students. The other woman was director of domestic affairs in the college kitchens. The college employed a female secretary in 1981.

===List of presidents===
There have been 14 presidents of the college since its foundation. All but two were members of the teaching staff before being appointed to the college presidency; the exceptions being Patrick Kerr and Christopher Darby . Two presidents have died in office; these are denoted with a . Six presidents had themselves been educated at the college; these are highlighted .

==Buildings and grounds==

The college was designed by Irish architect Thomas Francis McNamara, attached to the firm of W. H. Burne and Co. The Belfast firm, Messrs Laverty and Co., were contracted to carry out the job. The cost of the building was approximately £22,000.

A three-storey edifice resembling a medieval keep, it has been called &quot;the castle on the hill&quot;. Architectural features include four turreted round towers and flying buttresses which are modelled on the nearby cathedral. There is a medial courtyard and a stone chapel. A habitat on the grounds comprises flora, fauna, and fungi, including a monkey puzzle tree on the front lawn.

The foundation stone for the &quot;New Wing&quot; was laid on 23 September 1931 as part of the silver jubilee. It opened in September 1933, when it was used initially as accommodation for those priests who had, until that time, lived at addresses on the adjacent College Row, close by the school gates.

The college chapel was finished in 1952 during the presidency of McLoone. The chapel was designed by J. J. Robinson, architect of Galway Cathedral, and completed in 1961 at a cost of £42,000. The outline of a subterranean toilet block parallel to the College Chapel, which was used until the mid-1930s, can still be seen today. On Saturday 21 October 2017, the class of 1962–67 (featuring future Member of Cabinet Jim McDaid) held a reunion at the college, which began with a service in the College Chapel to remember the eight who were absent due to death.

Two science laboratories and a demonstration room were added in 1964 during the presidency of Daniel J. Cunnea, who was schooled in, and took an interest in, science and mathematics. Work got underway on a further extension to the college in 1977 during the presidency of Laverty. Work concluded in 1979, and the &quot;New Building&quot; was inaugurated in 1981 — the 75th anniversary of the college&#x27;s foundation. O&#x27;Fearrai created the College Library by converting the remnants of the boarding facilities after this wing closed in 1992. Early 21st-century efforts to attempt a further extension proved fruitless. Two plans were drawn up, but an approach was never finished. As per planning regulations, the school installed a set of ramps and two chair-lifts. To serve first-year students, three prefabs were installed in summer 2008; these were followed by four ancillary prefabs in summer 2010.

The first playing field opposite the college was completed during the presidency of McLoone. On 3 May 2019, the Minister with Responsibility for Defence Paul Kehoe and Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces Vice Admiral Mark Mellett reviewed 114th Infantry Battalion on the playing fields at the college in advance of its UNIFIL deployment to Southern Lebanon, Ireland&#x27;s largest overseas mission to date. The college was selected in recognition of County Donegal providing the largest contingent of troops to the mission (many of the rest came from Dublin and other Leinster counties). The ceremony included a parading of the unit colours (flag), a speech by Kehoe and a ceremonial &quot;march past&quot;. Minister for Education Joe McHugh, in whose constituency the event took place, was among other dignitaries in attendance.

==College structure==
The college comprises two houses. The first consists of the Junior Certificate (students of the first three years) and the second of Leaving Certificate (students of the final two years). Students of first year receive an orientation day on arrival dedicated entirely to them; students from more senior years are later introduced. Students of first year must take religion, Irish, English, mathematics, history, geography, science and physical education. They are granted options that range from modern European languages to music or art.

Each year is divided into form classes, named (usually) in honour of an Irish saint. These typically correspond with the year of the form class; for instance, an incoming first-year student would find himself in a class beginning with the letter A. The following illustrates each form class in use during the centenary year of 2006–07 (they may lessen or increase accordingly, depending on student numbers), and is included here as a reference point to notable students mentioned in the &quot;Centenary&quot; section above. The Saint Eunan is not used, though he would fit the scheme for year one of the leaving certificate.

==Academic==
Junior and Leaving Certificate students usually undertake pre-test examinations (MOCKs) each February or March or April, whilst the final examinations follow in June. The college is one of only 18 schools in the county that offers the LCA programme.

Transition Year is available if desired and has been since 1979. It includes two work experience allotments and a choice between computer or sport GCSEs. Spanish is offered during Transition Year along with French and German. Transition Year modules offered – past and present – include first aid, tennis, cookery (introductory demonstrations for the boys provided by the dinner ladies in the college kitchens) the study of drama and performance (held at An Grianán Theatre), electronics (using the facilities of a local third-level institution) and driver awareness (an introduction to the rules of the road for prospective drivers) and a referee course (for those interested in football). 2007 brought the introduction of yoga and juggling.

The college has fielded participants at the Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition, with some success experienced during the 21st century. The college sends teams to contest the All-Ireland Higher Maths national finals, a competition for higher-level students of mathematics. The college won a gold medal in 1999 and a silver medal in 2007. The college represented also at the 2007 International Mathematical Olympiad in Hanoi. They are regular competitors in the All-Ireland Final.

==Sport==
===Football===

&quot;Football&quot; for much of the college&#x27;s history has meant Gaelic football, and Gaelic football only. This is due to the Gaelic Athletic Association&#x27;s Rule 27, a former rule in the GAA&#x27;s Official Guide which forbade members from playing or attending foreign sports.

The college has several national titles. It has a history of contesting the MacRory Cup, going back to finals in the 1950s and 1960s. Tony McKenna, captain of the college&#x27;s 1956 MacRory Cup Final opponents St. Macartan&#x27;s, has stated the 1956 team &quot;Must have been the greatest team ever not to win the MacRory&quot;. John Wilson trained the team that reached the final of the 1961 MacRory Cup, though he departed for a teaching post at Gonzaga College midway through the year and a young Michael Cullen replaced him as team trainer. Wilson had previously been credited with overseeing a college victory over St Patrick&#x27;s (an occasion that marked the first time any team from County Donegal defeated a team from County Cavan). Before Wilson departed, he lived at 2 College Row. With the house vacant, staff members Hugh Duffy and Michael Kerr moved in. In 1969, Kerr took over 1 College Row and became the college&#x27;s vice-president the same year. Kerr was the country&#x27;s first lay vice-present. Hugh Duffy served as president of ASTI.

In 1979, a college team managed by Paddy Tunney and featuring repeat Leaving Certificate student Charlie Mulgrew won a MacLarnon Cup against De La Salle by a scoreline of 0–11 to 0–7. They then won an All-Ireland Colleges B Final against St. Fintan&#x27;s of Sutton, Dublin – a game played in Tullamore and ending in a scoreline of 2–6 to 2–5. This was noteworthy as Donegal&#x27;s first title at All-Ireland level. The county team would not win its first All-Ireland under-21 title until 1982.

At the turn of the millennium, Paddy Tunney stood aside as manager of the college team after 22 years in charge. He took on the post of &quot;director of football&quot; and his assistant Neil Gordon replaced him. Gordon&#x27;s first year in charge brought immediate success; the college team winning a MacLarnon Cup. Gordon continues to manage the college&#x27;s Gaelic football team as of 2018, when he led them to a narrow one-point loss after extra-time in an Ulster final replay.

The college won the Ulster Herald Cup in 2004, its first Herald Cup title in 25 years. The college football team reached the 2007 All-Ireland B Colleges Football Final. That campaign went as follows: On 25 March 2007, the college defeated Rathmore by a scoreline of 1–9 to 2–3 at Casement Park in Belfast (they had travelled there six days earlier only for the match to be postponed). This brought the team to the semi-final in which they defeated Rice College of Westport. St Mary&#x27;s of Edenderry were the college&#x27;s opponents in the All-Ireland Final at Breffni Park in Cavan on 21 April 2007. A penalty save by St Eunan&#x27;s goalkeeper John Carr ensured the match went to extra-time but the team lost by a scoreline of 2–12 to 0–14. This encouraged the college to again contest the MacRory Cup (i.e. the &quot;A&quot; competition); The team reached the semi-final of the 2008 MacRory Cup, in which St Michael&#x27;s College of Enniskillen overcame them by a scoreline of 1–17 to 0–7 on 22 February 2008.

Teachers at the college involved in the Gaelic Athletic Association include All-Ireland winning footballer Colm McFadden, Glenswilly and Donegal under-20 county football team manager Gary McDaid, and Mickey Houston. Mickey is a former club manager and was also a selector for the Donegal county football team but quit after a row with the manager. He was enjoying the game when his authority was undermined and substitutions were made without his consultation.

During the twentieth century, three students played senior inter-county football while attending the college; these were Seamus Hoare, Martin Carney and Paul McGettigan. In total, seven students have achieved Ulster All Stars while playing for the college. These are, with their years of attendance included, as follows: Sean McEwen (1987–1992 – left corner back 1992), Hugh Brendan Kerr (1992 – 1998 left corner back 1998), Mark McGowan (2001–2007), Michael Murphy, Ciaran Cannon, Shaun Patton and Cormac Callaghan.

Colm McFadden, Neil Gallagher, Rory Kavanagh and Michael Boyle – all of whom played for the college football team – played for the Donegal county football team during its most successful period, each winning a National Football League title in 2007, an All-Ireland Senior Football Championship in 2012 and several Ulster Senior Football Championships along the way. Michael Murphy – the future All-Ireland winning Donegal team captain – also captained his school team.

The college were MacRory Cup semi-finalists in 2008 with a team featuring Murphy, and were quarter-finalists in 2015 with a team featuring Conor Morrison and Niall O&#x27;Donnell.

The relative lack of success of the college – and hence Donegal, as it is the county&#x27;s foremost competitor – in the MacRory Cup has been explained by Declan Bonner as follows: &quot;The main reason... is because some of the big schools in the north take in a huge amount of students, and can boast players from up to ten to twelve clubs sometimes. In contrast, St Eunan&#x27;s only take their players from about seven schools and even at that, they wouldn&#x27;t be getting all the best players from those areas&quot;.

===Association football===
With Gaelic football the college&#x27;s dominant sport, the development of association football was deterred by the Gaelic Athletic Association&#x27;s Rule 27. It could not, therefore, become an &quot;official&quot; extracurricular activity at the college until the early 1970s. An illicit soccer league did, however, operate at the college and students even successfully convinced one of the priests who was a professor at the college to act as referee – provided that they lift the ball and play the Gaelic way in the event that less lenient members of the teaching clergy should wander by.

Since these early experiments with the game, the college has achieved several titles at national level. The first success at national level was the defeat of Saint Joseph&#x27;s, Fairview, by 1–0 in the final of the 1978 FAIS Junior Cup held at Tolka Park. 1979 brought the college&#x27;s first senior title at national level, with the team defeating Dublin&#x27;s Beneavin College by 2–0 in the final of the FAIS Senior Cup held at Terryland Park.

The college won national senior titles in consecutive years in the mid-1980s. The 1985 team – led by Michael Houston – defeated Beneavin by 3–0, while a penalty shoot-out at Belfield Park decided 1986 in the college&#x27;s favour.

Consecutive national senior titles also came in the mid-2000s. The 2004 team defeated De La Salle College Waterford, by 3–0 in the final at Belfield, while the 2005 team (featuring Michael Boyle, Ciaran Greene and, as a 79th-minute substitute, Mark McGowan) comprehensively defeated a Tallaght outfit by 4–1, also at Belfield Park. The 2004 senior victory was accompanied by under-16 and under-14 titles, the former defeating Summerhill College of Sligo by 1–0 after extra time, while Ollie Horgan managed the latter side to victory in Mullingar. Horgan went on to become manager of the Republic of Ireland schoolboys team and also of Finn Harps, leading the latter team to the League of Ireland Premier Division (the top flight of Ireland&#x27;s football league system).

Former Finn Harps player and manager Charlie McGeever was also a member of the teaching staff.

===Golf===

The college has a competitive history in golf. Michael Cullen oversaw the college&#x27;s participation in the Aer Lingus Golf Championship during the 1970s. Peter Hickey became the professional at Cork Golf Club.

During the 1980s, the college played in the Ulster Matchplay Championships and the Derryveagh Crystal Golf Championship.

The college won the Donegal Schools&#x27; Championship at senior and junior levels in 1993. The senior team won again in 1994.

Four more senior Championship and League titles followed during the 1990s, as well as two in 2000 and 2001. Conrad Logan, who would go on to become a professional footballer in the English Football League, featured in those last two at the turn of the millennium; indeed, Logan&#x27;s chip and putt sealed the 2001 win. Stephen Sweeney, who went on to become a club professional from Royal County Down Golf Club, played alongside Logan in 2001.

Led by team captain Michael Cullen, the college entered and won the 1995 Donegal Teachers&#x27; Championship, with a team also consisting of Jimmy Ward, Edward Harvey, Pat Hickey, Paraic O&#x27;Dowd and Tommy Nangle, the winner of the individual award.

===Other===
Mark English – described by Jerry Kiernan as Ireland&#x27;s &quot;greatest talent&quot; in middle-distance running – was a student at the college. English only made the switch to athletics during his Transition Year, a testament to the success of that experiment which was first made available to students in 1979.

The college is competitive in swimming.

Hurling, a sport at which Donegal teams are not traditionally dominant, has had teams from the college progress to the semi-finals.

The college has a rugby union team, re-established in the 2007–08 academic year after many years of absence. It started playing competitive rugby against other schools in the county and developed under-14, under-16 and ultimately under-18 squads. All age categories compete in their respective Donegal Schools Cup competitions against other schools: Abbey VS (Donegal), Carndonagh CS, Coláiste Ailigh, Coláiste Cholmcille (Ballyshannon), Loreto (Milford), Mulroy College (Milford), Rosses CS (Dungloe), St Columb&#x27;s College (Derry) and Saint Columba&#x27;s College (Stranorlar). The college won the first rugby silverware in its history in January 2014, by defeating Saint Columba&#x27;s College Stranorlar to win the Senior (U18s) Donegal Schools Cup.

The college won a national basketball title in 2020.

==Musicals, operas, operettas and other performances==
The college has a rich operatic tradition dating back to its foundation. The first performance held there was of &quot;Finnola or The Borrowed Bride&quot;, a piece penned by a Loreto sister especially for the Aonach of 1906 (a final fundraising event at the newly opened College). Operas and operettas were staged in the Recreational Hall after its completion. They previously took place on an enlarged stage in the Study Hall, with the public admitted — thus allowing for expenses on costumes and performing rights to be covered. Sometimes &quot;girls&quot; were borrowed from the nearby Loreto Convent to participate. Gradually, the British and American &quot;pop music&quot; reached Ireland and interest in the more traditional performances lessened among the students. Efforts were made during the 1980s and 1990s to revive these performances, albeit with the newer musical theatre in place of the opera/operettas of old – the college even sanctioned a production dating from as recently as the early 1970s. It was to no avail. These efforts at revival did nothing for the more sceptical among the student populace. Nowadays, the remnants of the old tradition are best seen in a &quot;rock concert&quot; – held each May since 2000 in the local An Grianán Theatre.

A partial record of college performances of the operettas and Gilbert and Sullivan operas is extant.

==Computer club==
Participants in the &quot;Computer Club&quot; of the 1980s included Neil Gordon (who would later teach at the college, organise annual ski trips abroad and manage the football team) and Kevin Gillespie (later Monsignor and Cathedral Parish Administrator). Gordon&#x27;s inaugural presentation was called &quot;Fuel Consumption&quot;, an early indication of where his future interests would lie. The &quot;Computer Club&quot; soon vanished though, as its main activities were absorbed into the curriculum.

 Damien Blake, who later became the youngest-ever mayor of Letterkenny, set up the school&#x27;s first website.

==Other clubs==
Others include clubs dedicated to books, cinema and games.

==Overseas expeditions==

Each year since the late twentieth century, teachers and students alike head for a ski resort during the holidays. The first trip, to Andorra, was organised in 1997. The 2008 trip, when Neil Gordon led a troupe of skiers to the United States, proved eventful – the Airbus craft bringing them home experienced motor difficulties in mid-flight and had to return to Logan International Airport after several hours in the air. The aborted flight received coverage in national media, such as &quot;The Irish Times&quot;.

The college has taken part in several foreign exchange programmes involving schools in Brittany and Vienna. Many European students have also availed of the education offered by the college – coming from as far as Spain, France and Austria.

<doc id="711119" wikidata="Q2018871" url="?curid=711119" title="Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme">
<text>The Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme is a mid-size car produced by Oldsmobile between 1966 and 1997. It was positioned as a premium offering at the top of the Cutlass range. It began as a trim package, developed its own roofline, and rose during the mid-1970s to become not only the most popular Oldsmobile but the highest selling model in its class.

It was produced as a rear-wheel drive two-door hardtop, sedan, and station wagon into the 1980s, and a convertible through 1972. In 1988 Oldsmobile sought to capitalize on the brand equity of the Cutlass Supreme marque by replacing it with a downsized front-wheel drive model based on the General Motors W platform.

When production ended there was no direct replacement for the Cutlass Supreme, although the Intrigue introduced for 1998 was designed in size and price to replace all the Cutlass models.

==First generation (1966–1967)==
The Cutlass Supreme name first appeared for the 1966 model year, the first year of GM&#x27;s new intermediate four-door hardtop sedan—also known as the Holiday Sedan. In addition to the new body style (also available on the midline F-85 Deluxe series), the Supreme featured a plusher interior that included a bench seat with armrest, full wheel covers and deluxe door panels among other items including &quot;CS&quot; emblems on the rear C-pillars and trunk lid. Although smaller than the traditional domestic cars, &quot;its deluxe interior makes it comparable with LTD, VIP, DPL, and Caprice.&quot;

For the 1967 model year, the Cutlass Supreme line was expanded into a full series that also included a two-door hardtop coupe (Holiday Coupe), two-door pillared coupe (Sport Coupe), four-door pillared sedan (Town Sedan) and a convertible. Generally, interior appointments in Supreme models were more luxurious than lesser F-85 and Cutlass series cars and included a cloth or &quot;Morocceen&quot; vinyl bench seat with armrest in sedan models and all-vinyl Strato bucket seats in coupes and convertibles.

The standard Supreme engine for both years was Oldsmobile&#x27;s &quot;Ultra High Compression&quot; Jetfire Rocket V8 rated at with a four-barrel carburetor. Transmission offerings included a standard three-speed manual with column shift, floor-mounted four-speed manual with Hurst shifter or a two-speed Jetaway automatic.

In 1967, the high-performance 442 package with the V8 was available on three Cutlass Supreme models including the sport coupe, Holiday coupe and convertible. Also available on each of those three Supreme two-door models was &quot;Turnpike Cruiser&quot; option that included a 400 cubic-inch V8 with two-barrel carburetor and rating along with a numerically lower rear axle and Turbo-Hydramatic transmission.

==Second generation (1968–1972)==

The Cutlass and other GM intermediates were completely restyled for 1968 with wheelbases shortened to for 2-door coupe models and lengthened one inch to for four-door sedans and station wagons (with the exception of the glass-roof Vista Cruiser station wagon, which rode on an even longer wheelbase). The Cutlass Supreme, now the top-line Olds intermediate series, was pared down to two- and four-door hardtop models with the pillared sedans and coupes dropped and the convertible moved to the lower-priced Cutlass &quot;S&quot; line, upon which the 4-4-2 muscle car was now based. Also the standard Rocket V8 was enlarged from 330 to 350 cubic inches with .
The 1969 models received only a minor facelift such as a new split grille and vertical taillights with the same model and engine offerings. A new three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic 350 was added to the option list to replace the two-speed Jetaway automatic. Headrests were made standard equipment due to federal safety mandate and the ignition switch moved from the instrument panel to the steering column, which also was designed to lock the steering wheel. This ignition/steering wheel interlock, found on all 1969-model General Motors passenger cars, except for the Corvair, debuted one year before the federal government mandated it on all 1970 models.

For 1970, the Cutlass Supreme nameplate was switched to Oldsmobile&#x27;s equivalent of the downsized Pontiac Grand Prix on the A-body, to give the division an entry in the burgeoning market for smaller personal luxury cars. As such, the two-door hardtop had a new notchback roofline, while lower trim-line Cutlass coupes had a fastback style roof. The model remained in this role for virtually all of its production life. Unlike the Grand Prix and the also-related Chevrolet Monte Carlo, which had wholly separate bodies, longer wheelbases and different names from their less expensive siblings, the Supreme shared front and rear body parts with the standard Cutlass line and was always marketed as part of it. In addition to the two-door hardtop (Holiday Coupe), the Cutlass Supreme series for 1970 also included a four-door hardtop (Holiday Sedan) and regained the convertible bodystyle.
Supreme interiors were more luxurious that those of other Cutlass models, with a choice of a Custom Sport notchback bench seat with armrest in Osborne cloth or Morocceen vinyl or, at no extra cost (on coupes and convertibles only), Strato bucket seats in Morocceen vinyl. Available at extra cost with the bucket seats was a center console with floor-mounted shifter for which the Turbo-Hydramatic transmission could also be had with the Hurst Dual-Gate shifter commonly found in the division&#x27;s musclecar, the Oldsmobile 442.

For 1970 and 1971, both the Cutlass Supreme coupe and convertible were available with the Code Y-79 high performance &quot;SX&quot; option package. The SX option included several versions of the larger 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8 borrowed from the Olds 442 along with the cutout rear bumper and exhaust trumpets, 442&#x27;s rallye suspension (optional), distinctive SX badges and other features.

A W31 option added distinctive stripes and badging, and a camshaft with increased lift and duration for the 350 engine. The W31 option was offered on Supreme coupes only in 1968, but continued on lower-line F-85 and Cutlass S coupes through 1970.

1972 was the only year in which the Cutlass Supreme notchback hardtop could be equipped with the L75 455 and M20 four speed transmission, and only 77 of these cars were produced. All 1972 L75 455/M20 cars used the larger 2.07 valves and the W30 automatic camshaft. This gave the L75 455/M20 cars 270 net horsepower, as opposed to the TH400 automatic-equipped L75 cars, which produced 250 net horsepower.

The 1972 Hurst/Olds was based on the Supreme two-door hardtop and convertible, powered by both versions of the 455 Rocket offered on the 4-4-2, along with a Turbo 400 transmission with Hurst Dual/Gate shifter. The H/O convertible also served as the Indianapolis 500 Pace Car in 1972.

1972 was also the final year for Olds to offer the Cutlass Supreme convertible, until 1990. In its final year, it was the best-selling convertible in the U.S., with 11,571 sold, or 16% of the market, beating the Eldorado and Corvette. From 1973 to 1975, the only Oldsmobile convertible offered was the full-sized Delta 88 Royale.

==Third generation (1973–1977)==
In 1973, the Cutlass Supreme, like other GM mid-size cars, was redesigned. Hardtop models were replaced by new &quot;Colonnade&quot; styling with fixed center pillars. Concerns over proposed rollover standards caused many automakers to phase out their pillarless hardtops and convertibles throughout the 1970s, and the Cutlass was no exception. Despite some initial controversy over the disappearance of hardtop models, the new 1973 GM mid-sized line proved highly successful. Cutlass Supreme coupes had a unique roofline with vertical opera windows not shared with other Cutlass coupes, as well as unique front end styling.

The Cutlass line soon became Oldsmobile&#x27;s biggest seller, accounting for 43% of the division&#x27;s total volume in 1974, with the Cutlass Supreme coupe being the single most popular model. With rectangular headlights newly legalized in 1975, the Cutlass received a facelift for the 1976 model year featuring quad headlights and a waterfall grille. This attractive redesign boosted sales even further. The Cutlass line as a whole was America&#x27;s best-selling car in 1976, helping Oldsmobile to become the only marque outside of Ford and Chevrolet to break one-million units sold. By 1977, however, GM had downsized its full-size models, and the Cutlass Supreme was now nearly identical in size to the redesigned Delta 88. That situation would last only that one year, as GM planned to downsize the Olds Cutlass and other intermediates for 1978.

In addition to the Colonnade hardtop coupe, the Cutlass Supreme was also offered in a four-door Colonnade sedan (with six-window styling and frameless door windows) as well as six-and-nine passenger station wagons - the wagons with the woodgrain exterior trim were marketed under the Vista Cruiser nameplate previously used on Oldsmobile&#x27;s stretched-wheelbase station wagons with raised roof and skylights from 1964 to 1972 while the Cutlass Supreme Cruiser was offered with the same equipment and dimensions without the woodgrained appearance.

The Supreme Colonnade sedan was available in 1973 as the Cutlass Salon, which was an option package that included radial tires, upgraded suspension and reclining bucket seats upholstered in corduroy or vinyl trim along with color-keyed wheelcovers - designed as sort of a European-style luxury/touring sedan similar to the Pontiac Grand Am of the same period. For 1974, the Salon package was also made available on the Supreme Colonnade coupe and in 1975, the Salon was upgraded to a separate series available in both sedan and coupe. The 1975s received a new, more squared off grille, slightly larger and incorporating parking lights. The bumpers also continued to grow ever larger.

For 1973–74, the 350 Rocket V8 with four-barrel carburetor and was the standard Cutlass Supreme engine with a 250-horsepower 455 Rocket offered as an option. Both three- and four-speed manual transmissions were offered in 1973, but the greatest majority of Cutlasses (including Supremes) were built with the three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic automatic transmission which became standard equipment in 1974, along with variable-ratio power steering.

The 1973-74 energy crisis resulting from the Arab Oil Embargo led Oldsmobile to introduce two new smaller engines to the Cutlass line in 1975. The Chevrolet built 250 cubic-inch inline six and three-speed manual transmission were reinstated as standard equipment on the Supreme coupe and sedan with a new Olds-built 260 cubic-inch Rocket V8 (standard on Cutlass Salon and optional on all other Cutlasses except wagons) offered as an option. However, the majority of Cutlass Supremes in 1975, 1976, and 1977 were sold with the now-optional 350 Rocket V8 and Turbo-Hydramatic automatic (still standard on wagons). The 455 Rocket V8 was optional through 1976, and replaced by a smaller 403 Rocket V8 in 1977, the same year in which a Buick-built 231 cubic-inch V6 replaced the Chevy inline six as base power in most Cutlass models.

For 1976, the Cutlass Supreme Brougham coupe was added to the line, featuring a more luxurious interior trim than the regular Supreme model with pillowed crushed velour upholstery and 60/40 bench seats similar to the larger Ninety-Eight Regency. It also received quad square headlights. For 1977, the Brougham was also available as a four-door Colonnade sedan. The grille was also changed, with each half divided into five rather than two segments of bars divided by chrome strips.

A five-speed manual transmission was available as an option with the 260 V8 in all models except Supreme Brougham and station wagons for 1976–77.
==Fourth generation (1978–1988)==
The Cutlass Supreme was downsized for 1978, along with the rest of the Cutlass line. An upscale Cutlass Calais model was added, differing from the Cutlass Supreme only in minor trim details. The new notchback Cutlass Supreme proved to be far more popular than the controversial fastback Cutlass Salon coupe and sedan introduced at the same time.

The Cutlass Calais, essentially replaced the previous Cutlass Salon series, as far as model position and content were concerned. The Calais featured reclining Strato bucket seats, center console, sport steering wheel, full instrumentation, tuned suspension with front and rear sway bars, color-keyed wheelcovers, front grilles mimicking an ice cube tray (as opposed to the waterfall style used with the Cutlass Supreme) and more.

Both the Cutlass Supreme and Calais were available with T-tops or a factory sunroof, even on the base Cutlass Supreme coupe with the factory radio delete option.

From 1978 through 1980, a high-performance 442 model was available, and for 1979 (Cutlass Calais), a special-edition performance model, the Hurst/Olds was offered. These used the Supreme&#x27;s notchback body, rather than the standard fastback coupe&#x27;s. Around 2,499 Hurst/Olds were produced - all were powered with an Oldsmobile 5.7L (350 cubic-inch) Rocket V8 (not the diesel engine) sourced from the full-sized Delta 88 and Ninety Eight Regency. Also included in the Hurst/Olds package was the Hurst Dual/Gate shifter for the three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic transmission.

In 1978, the Cutlass line featured taillights which had a lighted Oldsmobile rocket logo in the center.

In 1979, the taillights on the Cutlass line dropped the rocket logo.

In 1980, the two-door models went back to four headlights. A 4-door notchback sedan (known as Cutlass, Cutlass LS, and Cutlass Brougham) replaced the unpopular 4-door &quot;aeroback&quot; Salon, which continued in two-door form for one more year. The Supreme Brougham package was available on and off throughout 1978-1988 production. This was also the first year GM introduced the OBD-I computer controlled engine management and emission control system.

The 442 option moved from the aeroback Cutlass Salon coupe body to the notchback Cutlass Calais for 1980, with content upgraded from a mere &quot;appearance and handling&quot; package back to a legitimate performance option with content similar to the 1979 Hurst/Olds including its 350 Rocket V8. This would be the last 442 until that model was revived in 1985 again on the Cutlass notchback body as a successor to the 1983–84 Hurst/Olds.

In 1981, the Cutlass Supreme coupe received an aerodynamic restyle (with a &quot;shovel-nose&quot; front header panel), which, along with a higher rear deck, decreased air resistance by 15%. It would continue with this basic design until the final rear-drive Cutlass was produced in 1988. A 4-door sedan was added to the Supreme lineup, with a new front end and a slight taillight lens restyle (resembling a touch-tone dial or Rubik&#x27;s Cube - this lens style was used until 1984). It was this restyled body that (along with the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Buick Regal, and Pontiac Grand Prix) ushered in the downsized cars into NASCAR cup competition. While the Cutlass looked almost identical to the Buick Regal (which scored 35+ victories in the 1981 thru 1985 seasons), the Cutlass (like the Dodge Mirada) didn&#x27;t take one checkered flag, and many teams moved away from it in 1983 to the Regal, Grand Prix, and restyled Monte Carlo SS. This was a rude awakening to Oldsmobile, which was getting used to wins on the NASCAR circuit.

In 1982 GM introduced the front-wheel drive A-body as the volume replacement for the 1978-vintage RWD A-bodies. Oldsmobile launched the FWD Cutlass Ciera, but lower gas prices and strong sales allowed them to continue sales of the older RWD Cutlass Supreme as a premium model until 1988. (The older body was renamed to be the G-Body.)

The Hurst/Olds reappeared on the Cutlass Calais coupe for two years, first in 1983 as the black over silver 15th anniversary, and then as the silver over black 1984 model. Both featured chrome wheels, red striping and a high output Oldsmobile 307 V8 with 4 barrel carburetor, dual muffler exhausts and Hurst&#x27;s then new three stick Lightning Rods shifter (the latter eventually becoming a magnet for thieves.) All Hurst/Olds were automatics.

The Cutlass Cruiser stationwagon nameplate was moved to the Cutlass Ciera in 1984.

The 1985 Cutlass Supreme was produced by Oldsmobile and designed after the Oldsmobile Calais, which became a separate model on the GM N platform in the same year. The rear-wheel drive Cutlass Calais was renamed the Cutlass Salon (taking its name from the upscale Supreme coupe and sedan that preceded the Calais).

“ 5.0-liter V8 engine, available. The added performance that adds to the pleasure of driving.” The Olds Cutlass Supreme coupe and sedan were stock with a 3.8-liter V6, 2 barrel engine, while a 5-liter V8 engine was available at extra cost.

Brougham Coupe and Sedan - Although very similar to the original Cutlass Supreme, the Brougham is slightly better equipped. It has the same exact 3.8-liter stock engine and 3-speed transmission, but has a divided front bench seat with individual controls and the choice of velour trim in five colors. Also includes a convenience group with lamps, visor vanity mirror and chime tones. To finish off the specialization of the premium model, Oldsmobile created specific Brougham hood ornaments.

1987 was the final year for the rear-wheel drive sedan, and the coupe models received a restyled header panel with composite headlights (sedans retained the quad sealed beam design). A Buick 231 was the base motor alongside the Oldsmobile 307. For its final year, the 442 package was moved to the Supreme model.

1988 was the final year for the rear-wheel drive Cutlass Supreme. It was badged Cutlass Supreme Classic, and 27,678 were built. The 2-door coupe (produced alongside the Chevrolet Monte Carlo at GM&#x27;s Pontiac, Michigan plant) continued, until the new front-wheel drive version was released in December 1987. The Olds 307 was the only available engine.

===High-performance engines===
Two high-performance variants were created, both using a high-output version of Oldsmobile&#x27;s 5.0 L (307 CID) V8 engine:
* 1983–1984 Oldsmobile Hurst/Olds
* 1985–1987 Oldsmobile 442

==Fifth generation (1988–1997)==

A front-wheel-drive Cutlass Supreme based on the GM10 platform (W-body) was introduced as a 2-door notchback coupe mid-year during the 1988 production run, while the final year of Cutlass Supreme RWD coupes were still being produced. This new FWD model shared its wheelbase with the Pontiac Grand Prix, Buick Regal, and later Chevrolet Lumina. The 1988 and 1989 models were 2-door coupes. This body style proved to be a winner for NASCAR competition and it visited the victory circle 13 times between 1989 and 1992, when Oldsmobile ended its racing program. A 4-door notchback sedan was added to the lineup in 1990 and was originally meant to replace the Cutlass Ciera, however, as the Ciera was still selling strongly, it remained in production alongside the Supreme as a lower priced model until 1996. In addition to the sedan, a 2-door convertible was also introduced for 1990. Models included base (later called S), SL, and the sporty International Series. Throughout its run, the convertible was especially popular and considered a separate trim level.

International Series models could be equipped with unique features such as quad bucket seats with dual center consoles, a driver information system and a heads-up display. A very rare Muncie 5-speed manual transmission option was paired first with the 60° V6 in 1988 and 1989. In 1990, a revised Getrag 5-speed manual transmission option was available for the high-output LG0 Quad 4 I4 and the DOHC 60° V6 in 1991 and 1992. The entire line was restyled for 1992, with coupes and convertibles gaining distinctive &quot;mini-quad&quot; headlamps shared with the Pontiac Grand Prix coupe. A driver&#x27;s side airbag became standard in 1994, and a new ergonomically curved dashboard with dual airbags debuted in 1995.

The trim levels and the lineup were gradually pared down over time. The Quad 4 engine was last produced during the 1991 model year; the manual transmission option during 1992; the International Series during 1993; the S model during 1994; the convertible during 1995; and the 3.4 L V6 engine option during 1996. The Cutlass Supreme ceased production at the end of the 1997 model year. That same year, an N-body Cutlass (actually a badge-engineered Malibu) was introduced to replace the Ciera, but this model lasted just three years. The Cutlass Supreme&#x27;s place in the Oldsmobile line was taken by the 1998 Intrigue, built on the next version of the W platform. The Cutlass Supreme ended production on April 24, 1997.

The W-body Cutlass Supreme was built in Doraville, Georgia from 1988 to 1995, and at the Fairfax Plant in Kansas City, Kansas from 1996 to 1997. The first 1988 Cutlass Supreme rolled off the assembly line on January 13, 1988. The last Cutlass Supreme convertible was completed on February 15, 1995. The reason for this is that the last 34,743 cars built in Doraville were sedans, the coupe production was sent to Fairfax, Kansas around March 1, 1995, and Cars and Concepts did not have a facility near Fairfax.

===Indianapolis 500 Pace Car===
In 1988 the Indianapolis Motor Speedway chose Oldsmobile to pace “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing”, with retired United States Air Force General Chuck Yeager behind the wheel. Traditionally a manufacturer builds many pace car replicas, often thousands. But in 1988 Oldsmobile chose to build only 50 Cutlass Convertible Indy Pace Car editions. All 50 (used on track on race day and in 500 Festival activities) were essentially hand-built. General Motors/Oldsmobile contracted Cars and Concepts of Brighton, Michigan to build each of these 50 unique cars. Following the race 50 very select Oldsmobile dealers were given the opportunity to purchase one of these cars. The price was set at full invoice price for a standard International Series coupe (~$14,000) plus the cost of the convertible conversion (an additional $13,997). Each was highly optioned, including the first-ever application of Heads Up Display in an American production vehicle developed by Hughes Electronics. After the 50 were in the dealers&#x27; hands across the country, General Motors discovered some issue with the certification of these one-off models. Each dealer was asked to return them to GM (where they were to be destroyed) and receive full credit of their purchase price. Most of the 50 were returned for credit, but a few dealers objected and kept their cars, leaving (by all accounts) less than 10 in the general population. Mr. Thomas Knobloch, a second-generation Oldsmobile dealer in Erie, Pennsylvania was one of those dealers who refused to relinquish his car. He instead held on to it as a collectible. Realizing its incredible rarity and place in both GM/Oldsmobile and Indy 500 history, he drove less than over his many years of ownership. The Knobloch family sold the car after his death.

<text>Lister Sheddon Sinclair, OC (January 9, 1921 – October 16, 2006) was a Canadian broadcaster, playwright and polymath.

==Early life==
Sinclair was born in Bombay, India, to Scottish parents. His father, William Sheddon Sinclair, was a chemical engineer. He was sent to live with an aunt in London when he was 18 months old and saw his parents again when he was seven.

He taught himself to read at the age of five and began his formal education at Colet Court. Though at the bottom of his class, he was gifted at mathematics and won a scholarship to St Paul&#x27;s School in London. In 1939, assured by a travel agency that there would be no war, he visited North America with his mother to attend the World&#x27;s Fair in New York City. He was visiting Niagara Falls, Ontario, when World War II broke out. Due to a back injury as a teenager, Sinclair walked with a limp and used a cane until well into his twenties and was unfit for military service. He and his mother found themselves stranded on the continent and settled in Vancouver where his mother had friends. He enrolled at the University of British Columbia where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in math and physics and began a lifelong friendship with classmate Pierre Berton. He also joined the Player&#x27;s Club on campus. In 1942 he moved to Toronto to study toward a Master of Arts from the University of Toronto, supporting himself by lecturing mathematics to undergraduates.

==Career==

Needing to further supplement his income, Sinclair found employment as an actor with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) playing a German in the 1942 pro-Allied broadcast, &quot;Nazi Eyes on Canada&quot;, which starred Helen Hayes.

He was subsequently cast in the series &quot;Fighting Navy&quot; playing the captain of a German U-boat and performed in various other radio plays. He began writing radio plays for the network in 1944 and would go on to write more than 400 plays, many of them for the radio series &quot;Stage&quot;.

In 1945, Sinclair wrote a radio speech that Ontario Co-operative Commonwealth Federation leader Ted Jolliffe delivered during the 1945 provincial election campaign. The speech accused Premier of Ontario George Drew of running a political gestapo unit out of the Ontario Provincial Police. The accusations were denied by Drew, and may have hurt the CCF&#x27;s credibility with voters. However, the charge was proven true in the 1970s by archival documents uncovered by a researcher.

Sinclair&#x27;s radio play, &quot;Hilda Morgan&quot;, broadcast on February 12, 1950, resulted in an uproar in the House of Commons of Canada over its then-taboo subject matter of a pregnant, unmarried woman considering abortion after her fiancé is killed in an accident (although the word abortion was never used). He was referred to as &quot;easily the foremost in Canada&#x27;s array of postwar playwrights&quot; by critic Nathan Cohen.
He began to appear on the new CBC Television service in 1955 appearing on programs such as &quot;Front Page Challenge&quot; and &quot;Assignment&quot; as well as the &quot;Wayne &amp; Shuster&quot; comedy show, as well as presenting all but one episode of A Is for Aardvark.

In 1964, Sinclair recorded and released an album on Folkways Records, entitled &quot;Documentary History of Broadcasting: 1920-1950: Radio Before Television.&quot;

After his appearances in wartime propaganda films, Sinclair would go on to spend over six decades with the CBC in various capacities. In addition to playwright he was a radio and television personality, writer, actor, panelist, producer, lecturer, commentator, and, for a brief period in the 1970s, network executive. Sinclair was a panelist on the show &quot;Court of Opinion&quot; for twenty-four years, hosted &quot;Man at the Centre&quot; and was a guest host during the second season of &quot;The Nature of Things&quot; as well as a frequent contributor to &quot;Morningside&quot; when Don Harron was host, but he was best known for presenting the CBC Radio program &quot;Ideas&quot; beginning in 1983. Sinclair retired from hosting &quot;Ideas&quot; in 1999 after presenting over 2,000 installments, including several hundred produced or written by himself. He continued to contribute to the program until shortly before his death.

In 1972, CBC president Laurent Picard made Sinclair the CBC&#x27;s executive vice-president of English-language services as part of an effort to bring creative people into administration. The experiment was unsuccessful and proved frustrating to both Sinclair and CBC administration in Ottawa. He was demoted to a more junior position as vice president of program policy and development in 1974 and in 1976 returned to Toronto to his former role as a producer and writer. Dr. Robert Gardner, later the chair of the School of Radio and Television Arts at Ryerson University, recalled working with Sinclair during that difficult time. &quot;He was astoundingly well informed. We worked together on a script for a CBC television program dealing with Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. Lister had hired me as the writer researcher and--there is no doubt about it--he was a demanding boss. His conversations were constantly sprinkled with classical allusions, phrases in German, French, or Italian, and he was impatient of lesser souls. Working with him was one of the most stimulating experiences of my life ... and one of the most frightening.&quot;

Sinclair served as president of the Canadian Conference of the Arts from 1980 through 1983. He also helped form the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists (ACTRA). He was named an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1985. The following year he collaborated with his longtime friend and colleague Pierre Berton to create Heritage Theatre, a 26 episode drama series, featuring stories from Berton&#x27;s popular Canadian history books, and broadcast on CBC TV.

In 2002, Lister Sinclair became a MasterWorks honouree for &quot;Hilda Morgan&quot; and his body of work by the Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada. One of his last works was something of a hit after his official retirement entitled &quot;Lister Sinclair Presents the Masterpieces of Disco Music&quot; for the radio program Go.

Sinclair died in a Toronto hospital on the morning of October 16, 2006, aged 85.

Former Governor General and CBC broadcaster Adrienne Clarkson, who shared an office with Sinclair when she joined the broadcaster in the 1960s, remembered him upon his death: &quot;You were the beneficiary of Lister knowing a lot. He was not only a polymath; he was a prodigy.&quot;

<text>A military satellite is an artificial satellite used for a military purpose. The most common missions are intelligence gathering, navigation and military communications.

The first military satellites were photographic reconnaissance missions. Some attempts were made to develop satellite based weapons but this work was halted in 1967 following the ratification of international treaties banning the deployment of weapons of mass destruction in orbit.

As of 2013, there are 950 satellites of all types in Earth orbit. It is not possible to identify the exact number of these that are military satellites partly due to secrecy and partly due to dual purpose missions such as GPS satellites that serve both civilian and military purposes. As of December 2018 there are 320 known military or dual-use satellites in the sky, half of which are owned by the US, followed by Russia, China and India.

==Military reconnaissance satellites==

The first military use of satellites was for reconnaissance.

In the United States the first formal military satellite programs, Weapon System 117L, was developed in the mid-1950s. Within this program a number of sub-programs were developed including Corona. Satellites within the Corona program carried different code names. The first launches were code named Discoverer. This mission was a series of reconnaissance satellites, designed to enter orbit, take high-resolution photographs and then return the payload to Earth via parachute. Discoverer 1, the first mission, was launched on 28 February 1959 although it didn&#x27;t carry a payload being intended as a test flight to prove the technology. Corona was followed by other programs including Canyon (seven launches between 1968 and 1977), Aquacade and Orion (stated by US Government sources to be extremely large). There have also been a number of subsequent programs including Magnum and Trumpet, but these remain classified and therefore many details remain speculative.

The Soviet Union began the Almaz () program in the early 1960s. This program involved placing space stations in Earth orbit as an alternative to satellites. Three stations were launched between 1973 and 1976: Salyut 2, Salyut 3 and Salyut 5. Following Salyut 5, the Soviet Ministry of Defence judged in 1978 that the time consumed by station maintenance outweighed the benefits relative to automatic reconnaissance satellites.

In 2015, United States military space units and commercial satellite operator Intelsat became concerned about apparent reconnaissance test maneuvers by the Russian satellite Olymp-K, launched in September 2014, when it maneuvered between Intelsat 7 and Intelsat 901, which are located only half a degree from one another in geosynchronous orbit.

==Navigation satellites==

The first satellite navigation system, Transit, used by the United States Navy, was tested in 1960. It used a constellation of five satellites and could provide a navigational fix approximately once per hour.

During the Cold War arms race, the nuclear threat was used to justify the cost of providing a more capable system. These developments led eventually to the deployment of the Global Positioning System (GPS). The US Navy required precise navigation to enable submarines to get an accurate fix of their positions before they launched their SLBMs. The USAF had requirements for a more accurate and reliable navigation system, as did the United States Army for geodetic surveying for which purpose they had developed the SECOR system. SECOR used ground-based transmitters from known locations that sent signals to satellite transponder in orbit. A fourth ground-based station, at an undetermined position, could then use those signals to fix its location precisely. The last SECOR satellite was launched in 1969.

In 1978, the first experimental Block-I GPS satellite was launched and by December 1993, GPS achieved initial operational capability (IOC), indicating a full constellation (24 satellites) was available and providing the Standard Positioning Service (SPS). Full Operational Capability (FOC) was declared by Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) in April 1995, signifying full availability of the military&#x27;s secure Precise Positioning Service (PPS).

==Early warning systems==
A number of nations have developed satellite based early warning systems designed to detect ICBMs during different flight phases. In the United States these satellites are operated by the Defense Support Program (DSP). The first launch of a DSP satellite was on 6 November 1970 with the 23rd and last launched 10 November 2007. This program has been superseded by the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS).

==Satellite weapons==
In the United States, research into satellite based weapons was initiated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1950s. In 1958, the United States initiated Project Defender to develop an anti-ICBM solution launched from satellites. The satellites would have deployed a huge wire mesh to disable ICBMs during their early launch phase. The project floundered due to the lack of any mechanism to protect the satellites from attack resulting in the cancellation of Defender in 1968.

Since October 1967 satellite based weapons systems have been limited by international treaty to conventional weapons only. of the Outer Space Treaty specifically prohibits signatories from installing weapons of mass destruction in Earth orbit. The treaty became effective on 10 October 1967 and, as of May 2013, 102 countries are parties to the treaty with a further 27 pending full ratification.

==Military communication satellites==
Communications satellites are used for military communications applications. Typically military satellites operate in the UHF, SHF (also known as X-band) or EHF (also known as Ka band) frequency bands.

The US Armed Forces maintains international networks of satellites with ground stations located in various continents. 
Signal latency is a major concern in satellite communications, so geographic and meteorological factors play an important role in choosing teleports. Since some of the major military activities of the U.S. army are in foreign territories, the U.S. government needs to subcontract satellite services to foreign carriers headquartered in areas with favorable climate.

Military Strategic and Tactical Relay, or Milstar, is a constellation of military satellites managed by the United States Space Force. Six spacecraft were launched between 1994 and 2003, of which five are operational, with the sixth lost in a launch failure. They are deployed in geostationary orbit and provide wideband, narrowband and protected military communication systems. Wideband systems support high-bandwidth transfers. Protected systems offer more sophisticated security protection like antijam features and nuclear survivability, while narrowband systems are intended for basic communications services that do not require high bandwidth.

The United Kingdom also operates military communication satellites through its Skynet system. This is currently operated with support from Astrium Services and provides near worldwide coverage with both X band and Ultra high frequency services.

Skynet 5 is the United Kingdom&#x27;s most recent military communications satellite system. There are four Skynet satellites in orbit, with the latest launch completed in December 2012. The system is provided by a private contractor, Astrium, with the UK government paying service charges based on bandwidth consumption.

<text>Prometheus or X-303 and later BC-303 is a fictional starship that appears. The ship was first introduced, and would go on to become a recurring setting over the remainder of the series as well as being depicted in various spin-off media.

The ship was first written into the show by Joseph Mallozzi and Paul Mullie, and was designed by production designer Bridget McGuire. As well as McGuire, Mullie and Mallozzi, executive producer Brad Wright and art directors James Robbins and Peter Bodnarus also played a significant role in conceptualising and designing the ship.

Modern day naval vessels were the main influence for the ship&#x27;s design, with McGuire basing much of the interior on submarines, whilst destroyers and aircraft carriers helped inform much of the ship&#x27;s exterior.

==Development and Production==
===Concept and initial design===

&quot;Prometheus&quot; was first introduced in the episode of the same name, which was written by Joseph Mallozzi and Paul Mullie. Work on designing the spaceship began in 2002, with the &quot;Prometheus&quot; being imagined by the shows writers as Earth&#x27;s answer to the Goa&#x27;uld mothership. Mullie described wanting to create a ship that was &quot;exactly the opposite of the Goa&#x27;uld ships, which are basically big empty rooms&quot;, explaining that executive producer Brad Wright wanted a set with objects that could be interacted with by the actors, such as screens, buttons, chairs and flashing lights; none of which could be found on the shows Goa&#x27;uld sets. The shows production designer Bridget McGuire and her team began their work around five weeks before filming commenced. According to McGuire, the writers wanted a ship &quot;that looked less like a hi-tech alien vessel, and more like one that had been built for the USAF&quot;.

McGuire focused in on the idea of having contemporary sea-going military craft inform both the interior and exterior of the ship&#x27;s design and had Assistant Art Director Noeleen Tobin research a collection of reference images and schematics to help the process. Tobin came back with reference material the designers could use for inspiration. Images of ship bridges, engine rooms and other areas of various United States Aircraft carriers and submarines. McGuire wanted to &quot;incorporate many features we see in military vessels today, and adapt them for space travel&quot;, imagining &quot;Prometheus&quot; as &quot;more or less a destroyer in Space&quot;. McGuire specifically wanted to include &quot;confined spaces, low ceilings and plenty of exposed conduits and piping&quot; from submarines and aircraft control towers into the ship&#x27;s design. In her concept, McGuire knew the ship would focus around a bridge space, engine room and that the ship would also contain a hangar bay to house the smaller X-302 fighter craft, although they would not initially be building that part of the set.

After putting together some sketches, McGuire shared her concept with art directors Peter Bodnarus and James Robbins, both of whom then built upon McGuire&#x27;s ideas, coming up with their own drawings before reconvening to decide upon a more definite, final look for the ship. Robbins was then responsible for developing the exterior schematics and the interior workings of the ship. In his plans for the ship, Robbins purposely chose &quot;function over form&quot;, making the ship &quot;utilitarian&quot; in its design, describing it as &quot;not a pretty ship&quot;. Furthermore, Robbins reflected the writers desire that the ship &quot;had alien technology in it, but we didn&#x27;t see that&quot;. Robbins created deck plans for the ship, including positioning all of the different components and systems vital to the ship&#x27;s function. Robbins also imagined the ship&#x27;s propulsion, armament and crew compliment in his specifications. Although ultimately not used, Robbin&#x27;s conceptualised that &quot;Prometheus&quot; would have its own unique hyperdrive whereby the ship travelled through hyperspace on rails that projected from the nacelles, as opposed to forming a window like other ships from the series. Meanwhile, Bodnarus was responsible for developing drawings of the set interiors, such as the bridge, corridors, engine room and air lock. Bodnarus began by building a three-dimensional or virtual set on the computer and set about experimenting &quot;with various views and develop a sense of depth&quot; in the interior spaces of the ship. Once completed, Bodnarus was responsible for creating the final blueprints from which the set would be constructed.

===Construction and sets===

The set was originally constructed on Stage 6 at The Bridge Studios in Burnaby, Canada. The set was designed and built so that it could be easily taken apart, either entirely or as individual sections; with walls, windows and doors built on wheels or hinges allowing them to be moved for better access during filming. Two main spaces were initially constructed, the bridge and a multi-purpose room, which were interconnected by a hallway. The multi-purpose room was designed to be redressable, initially serving as the ship&#x27;s engine room, dining room and storage room. The hallways were constructed in a figure of 8 configuration allowing for walk and talk scenes to loop round and round the ship as per the needs to the scene, whilst doors and bulkheads could be moved into place to change the layout of the hallways. 
 Construction of the set was done to a &quot;very tight schedule&quot;, with set decorator Mark Davidson describing it as &quot;an incredible collaboration of different departments to get it as fast as we did&quot;. Three different build crews were put together, one for constructing the beams, another the bulkheads and the third crew built the windows and walls. As the set was not going to be entirely complete by the time filming was scheduled to commence, the story for the first episode to feature the ship was changed slightly to reflect the fact that the ship was still under construction. Once filming commenced on the episode &quot;Prometheus&quot;, set decorator Mark Davidson and the construction team were still actively building the bridge set, meaning director Peter Woeste was limited to only filming in the multi-purpose room for the first day of shooting.

Dressing the set, the naval theme was continued, whilst also looking to make the decor slightly more &quot;futuristic&quot; and a &quot;cross between military and alien&quot;. Initially 15 flatscreen monitors were used to decorate the ship, whilst the older CRT monitors were built into set pieces, with cutouts over-the-top &quot;to make them look a little more high end&quot;. Ladders were installed around the ship to give the impression of the scope of Prometheus and that the ship had multiple levels. Numerous pieces of electronic test equipment were also purchased and then taken apart, reconfigured, combined with various pieces made by the model shop and then built into various consoles and set pieces to provide the actors with switches, buttons and lights to interact with. Other features, such as the star-map console on the bridge were made from plexiglass whilst Davidson constructed the ship&#x27;s crystal trays from mainframe computer drawers. Davidson combined the more futuristic elements with what he thought of as more &quot;retro&quot; pieces, such as corded telephones and fire extinguishers and a sink/toilet unit from an aircraft.

As a cost saving measure the &quot;Prometheus&quot; set was redressed to also serve as the Earth ship &quot;Daedalus&quot; which was introduced in the second season of &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;. The set would then be reused again as the setting for more Earth spaceships and stations, including the &quot;Apollo&quot; and &quot;Midway Station&quot; in &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, &quot;Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Korolev&quot; in &quot;SG-1&quot; and finally the &quot;Hammond&quot; in &quot;Stargate Universe&quot;. The set was expanded upon for its use as subsequent ships and stations, with new consoles, fixtures, corridors and rooms. In 2010 at the end of the first season of &quot;Stargate Universe&quot; the set was taken down and placed into storage, before eventually being entirely dismantled for auction.

===Filming and lighting===

The set was fitted with hundreds of fluorescent lights built directly into the walls, ceilings and floors. Director of photography Jim Menard noted that this meant filming could often rely on the practical lighting, &quot;we can shoot with just the ship lighting and then do if you do a close-up you can fix up their shadows on their eyes and things&quot;. When it first came to filming in the set, director Peter Woeste along with chief lighting technician Rick Dean and directors of photography Jim Menard and Andrew Wilson had to work very quickly on their initial lighting design for &quot;Prometheus&quot;, only having access to the set from the day before filming commenced. Wilson and Woeste decided that whilst the &quot;Prometheus&quot; was still in the hangar it, as it would be in earlier scenes of the story, it would be under white industrial interior lighting, allowing for some leeway in fully realising the ship&#x27;s fully-operational look. After its introductory episodes of &quot;Prometheus&quot; and &quot;Unnatural Selection&quot;, Menard felt the ship&#x27;s lighting was a &quot;little bit red, white and blue&quot; and hoped to &quot;get away from that&quot;, whilst director Peter DeLuise felt it was &quot;too bright&quot; onboard and along with Woeste wanted to take the look of the ship &quot;darker&quot; and &quot;moodier&quot; for future episodes. The pair implemented their changes in the episode &quot;Memento&quot;, looking to more closely mirror the bridge of an aircraft carrier, relying predominantly on dark-blue lighting with DeLuise believing this could be justified as this was the first time the ship was being depicted as fully-operational.

===CGI models and exterior===

The &quot;Prometheus&quot; ship model was created entirely as a computer generated image by the visual effects studio Image Engine, with the studio basing their work on Robbin&#x27;s drawings. Rainmaker Digital Effects also worked on various shots of the ship over the course of the show. Many of the visual effects shots were designed to be reused throughout the show as a money-saving effort. This included the shots such as Frank Simmons (John DeLancie) being blown out of an airlock in the episode &quot;Prometheus&quot;, which would later be altered for the episode &quot;Memento&quot;, replacing Simmons with the hyperdrive core module. Shots of the &quot;Prometheus&quot; flying by or landing on different planets were also altered and reused in episodes such as &quot;Memento&quot; and &quot;Beachhead&quot;.

Outside of the bridge set a greenscreen was hung allowing for visual effect shots to be added, however as a cost-saving alternative to a star field visual effect production could swap the greenscreen for a black curtain that had small pieces of mirror attached, which when lit gave the effect of a star field. The multi-purpose room window also featured a window and greenscreen which would be used for shots of the ship&#x27;s engine core.

In season six through eight the ship had two pods, or nacelles on either side. Onscreen and in Robbin&#x27;s original drawings these were intended to be a form of propulsion. In season nine, these were reconceived as hanger bays from which the F-302 could launch.

===Writing===

In order to justify the expense of building such a large set &quot;Prometheus&quot; was intended to be featured throughout multiple episodes of season six. At this time executive producer Brad Wright expected that this would be the final season of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; and felt that it was &quot;time to start seeing some of the benefits, some of the repercussions of what we&#x27;ve learned and the technology we&#x27;ve brought back from all the places we&#x27;ve been&quot;, imagining both the &quot;Prometheus&quot; and &quot;X-302&quot; as being technical developments that had come about from the &quot;Stargate program&quot;. Wright also expected that the season would build towards a showdown with Anubis, and planned on using the &quot;Prometheus&quot; in a &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; feature film that would have concluded the show and setup the spinoff series &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;. In conceptualizing and writing material set on board the &quot;Prometheus&quot;, the writers spent time theorising what &quot;the United States Air Force do with a big ship in outer space&quot;, combining elements of not just the Air Force, but also the Navy and imagining how it would work.

The writers were conscious of comparisons to science fiction series &quot;Star Trek&quot;, with Paul Mullie acknowledging that by setting episodes onboard &quot;Prometheus&quot; &quot;You might say we&#x27;re sort of straying into Star Trek territory now&quot;, whilst Peter DeLuise called the episode &quot;Memento&quot; &quot;a lot of fun being able to do our own Star Trek-type thing&quot;. Despite this, Joseph Mallozzi stated that the show wouldn&#x27;t turn into &quot;Star Trek&quot;, whilst Cooper justified earth building ships like the &quot;Prometheus&quot; as &quot;a natural progression&quot;, proclaiming &quot;I love the ships. I think they&#x27;re cool, and I think ship shows are cool. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re ever in danger of becoming &quot;Star Trek&quot;&quot;. In writing episodes set on board the &quot;Prometheus&quot;, writers such as Damian Kindler felt that it was important that he not lose sight of what &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; was about and in writing &quot;Memento&quot; explained &quot;you can&#x27;t get too in love with the fact you&#x27;ve got a new big toy to play with&quot;, believing that stories involving the ship should all come back to the &quot;Stargate&quot;.

In season seven, the &quot;Prometheus&quot; registry was changed from &quot;X-303&quot; to &quot;BC-303&quot;. Writer Joseph Mallozzi confirmed that the ship was no longer deemed &quot;experimental&quot; and that BC was short for Battle Cruiser. As the show continued into its seventh and eighth season, Joseph Mallozzi felt that &quot;Prometheus&quot; had become a character that the show needed &quot;to check in on now and again&quot; and executive producer Robert C. Cooper would encourage the writers to set stories on board the ship in order to justify keeping the set up, resulting in episodes such as &quot;Memento&quot;, &quot;Grace&quot; and &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot;.

&quot;Daedalus&quot;, the sister-ship of &quot;Prometheus&quot; was originally imagined as an &quot;improved version of the Prometheus&quot; by art director James Robbins when blueprints of the ship were first shown in the episode &quot;Moebius&quot;, however these plans were abandoned with art director Peter Bodnarus entirely reimagining the Daedalus as its own new class of ship.

===Destruction===

In writing the ninth season of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, executive producer Robert C. Cooper made the decision that the &quot;Prometheus&quot; would be destroyed. This was in response to the &quot;Prometheus&quot; set at the time also being used as the Earth ship &quot;Daedalus&quot; in spinoff series &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;. Whilst based around the same set, the two ship interiors had a number of differences, such as the main window, a number of the consoles and other fixtures on the bridge, which had to be changed over depending on which ship was being used in the scene. To save production the time and money of flipping the set, Cooper decided that destroying the &quot;Prometheus&quot; would instead allow &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; to introduce its own &quot;Daedalus&quot;-class ship - the &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

The destruction of the ship would take place in the episode &quot;Ethon&quot;, at the hands of an Ori satellite weapon. Cooper wanted the destruction sequence to be &quot;Titanic in space&quot;, feeling that it was important to show &quot;SG-1&quot; and &quot;Prometheus&quot; &quot;mess everything up&quot; and result in a &quot;massive, massive tragedy&quot; occurring. Playing off the imagery of the Titanic sinking, Cooper wanted the &quot;Prometheus&quot; being destroyed &quot;to take a long, painful time&quot; and encouraged visual effects supervisor Michelle Comens to make the visual effects shot as long as possible. Writers Joseph Mallozzi and Paul Mullie had originally written scenes for the episode &quot;Ripple Effect&quot; that would foreshadow the destruction of the ship, however they were ultimately cut for time.

==Depiction==

The &quot;X-303&quot; is first mentioned in the second part of the season six opening episode, &quot;Redemption&quot;. The &quot;Prometheus&quot;, also known as &quot;X-303&quot; first appears in the episode of the same name, where it is still under construction in a secret underground facility in Nevada. The ship has been constructed by the United States Air Force using a combination of human and alien technology that has been acquired by &quot;Stargate Command&quot; over the years. The incomplete ship is stolen by rogue NID operatives, including Frank Simmons and the Goa&#x27;uld, Adrian Conrad. After &quot;Prometheus&quot; is recaptured by &quot;SG-1&quot;, in &quot;Unnatural Selection&quot;, the Asgard Thor enlists &quot;SG-1&quot; and the ship to help deal with a Replicator threat on the Asgard homeworld. In the episode &quot;Memento&quot;, &quot;Prometheus&quot; undergoes its shakedown flight and is now under the command of Colonel William Ronson. During testing, the hyperdrive engine overloads and the crew are forced to eject the core, stranding them on a world called Tagrea, where they have to locate the Stargate which has been buried. Without a working hyperdrive engine, the &quot;Prometheus&quot; remains stranded on Tagrea and in the episode &quot;Enemy Mine&quot; &quot;Stargate Command&quot; are mining the alien mineral Naquadah to construct more BC-303 ships.

In the episode &quot;Grace&quot; the ship begins it voyage back to Earth using a hyperdrive acquired from a Goa&#x27;uld Alkesh in the episode &quot;Avenger 2.0&quot;. Once back on earth, General George Hammond assumes command of the ship to defend the planet against the forces of Anubis in &quot;Lost City&quot;. After the battle, in the episode &quot;New Order&quot; Colonel Lionel Pendergast is made the commanding officer of &quot;Prometheus&quot; and in &quot;Endgame&quot; the ship undergoes a refit, with the Asgard installing beam technology and a hyperdrive engine. General George Hammond once again assumes command of &quot;Prometheus&quot; in the episode &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot; when he leads a rescue mission to find the &quot;Atlantis&quot; expedition, but on route is hijacked by Vala Mal Doran and are ultimately forced to return to earth. The &quot;Prometheus&quot; was due to be fitted with new railguns, however these were instead sent to &quot;Atlantis&quot; to help defend them against the Wraith in the &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; episode &quot;The Siege&quot;.

By the episode &quot;Avalon&quot; the ship has been fitted with Asgard sensors, which it uses to assist &quot;SG-1&quot; in locating an Ancient structure beneath the Glastonbury Tor. After the Ori attack a Free Jaffa world in &quot;Beachhead&quot;, SG-1 travel on board the ship to attempt to stop the Ori invasion and ultimately halt construction of the first Ori Supergate. The ship&#x27;s Asgard transporter is used to help thwart Ba&#x27;al from destroying part of Downtown Seattle in &quot;Ex Deus Machina&quot;. In the episode &quot;Ripple Effect&quot; &quot;SG-1&quot; along with another version of the team from an alternate reality use the ship to close a breach in space. &quot;Stargate Command&quot; is asked by Jared Kane to help destroy an Ori satellite that has been built by his people, The Rand Protectorate, who intend on annihilating the rival nation on their world, Caledonia. &quot;SG-1&quot; and &quot;Prometheus&quot; travel to Kane&#x27;s homeworld of Tegalus, but soon realise the satellite is more than the ship can handle. As the ship is disabled, Pendergast helps transport the crew to safety before going down with the ship. Around a year later whilst stuck in an alternate reality, Samantha Carter is taken on board the &quot;Prometheus&quot;, which is now being used as Air Force One by President Hank Landry.

The &quot;Prometheus&quot; was included as a non-playable vehicle in the cancelled video game &quot;Stargate SG-1: The Alliance&quot;, that was in development around 2004. In 2021 the &quot;Prometheus&quot; was added as a controllable vehicle in the mobile game &quot;AstroKings&quot;, along with other elements from the &quot;Stargate&quot; television franchise.

==Impact==

Sean Ferrick for WhatCulture called &quot;Prometheus&quot; &quot;something of a symbol for the earlier to middle age of the show, bulky but still fully functional&quot;, noting the storytelling possibilities that the ship created for &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; in expanding beyond just using the Stargate &quot;while still keeping the show grounded where it needed to be&quot;. Also writing for WhatCulture, Alastair Greenwell called the ship&#x27;s introduction &quot;worth the wait&quot;, believing that the teething issues in episodes such as &quot;Memento&quot; &quot;only endears the ship more to the fans&quot;. Keith DeCandido for Tor.com felt the ship was representative of Earth &quot;becoming an actual power in the galaxy as opposed to an irritant&quot;. Darren Sumner, founder of fansite Gateworld disliked the design of the &quot;Prometheus&quot;, and despite finding it exciting that Earth had developed an interstellar battlecruiser, he thought it was &quot;ridiculously ugly&quot;. Fansite Dial the Gate host David Read shared Sumner&#x27;s sentiments, and also highlighted his dissatisfaction at the existence of the &quot;Prometheus&quot; not being set up or foreshadowed prior to its reveal in episode of the same name.

In discussing the role of spaceships, including the &quot;Prometheus&quot;, and how it impacted &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, Gateworld&#x27;s David Read felt that the &quot;Stargate&quot; and the ship were often in conflict with each other as storytelling devices, and was of the opinion that ships should &quot;carry stories as minimally as possible&quot;, fearing that the show could turn into &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Sumner felt that in season six and season seven the spaceships &quot;were not infringing&quot; on the Stargate, but believed in season nine and season ten they were &quot;really encroaching on the &quot;Stargate&quot; as the centre-piece of the show&quot;, believing that episodes such as &quot;Memento&quot; and &quot;The Pegasus Project&quot; were &quot;good examples of using our ships tell to interesting stories that I think build on the world of Stargate, instead of replacing the Stargate&quot;.

===Set auctions, models and toys===

Many of the set pieces were reworked into the later &quot;Daedalus-class&quot; ships&#x27; sets. After being deconstructed in 2010 some set pieces and props from the ship were sold at auction, this included the pilot and tactical consoles which sold for US$600 and US$1,250 respectively, whilst the captain&#x27;s chair sold for US$1,750. Bridge chairs, control crystal trays, girders from the corridor set and control panels were also auctioned off. The 23-page set blueprints were also sold at auction for US$1,600.

In November 2023, toy company BlueBrixx announced their &quot;Stargate&quot; line, which included a buildable &quot;Prometheus&quot;. Also in November 2023, Master Replicas released a model of the ship.

<doc id="711135" wikidata="Q2942300" url="?curid=711135" title="Cathedral of St Eunan and St Columba">
<text>St Eunan&#x27;s Cathedral ( ), or the Cathedral of St Eunan and St Columba as it is also known, is a cathedral in the parish of Conwal and Leck, part of the Diocese of Raphoe. Built between the years of 1890 and 1900, the cathedral is found in Letterkenny, County Donegal in Ireland. There are two cathedrals in the county; an older cathedral of the same name is found in the town of Raphoe, and since the Reformation, has been used by the Church of Ireland.

The cathedral was commissioned by Cardinal O&#x27;Donnell - then Bishop of Raphoe - and who, in 1888 aged 32, became the youngest bishop in the world at that time. The cathedral, located on Castle Street opposite Conwal Parish Church in the town, has a spire height of 73m/240ft and celebrated its centenary in 2001.

==Description==

The cathedral is named for the Saints Adamnán and Columba; it opened on 16 June 1901 and is built in Victorian neo-Gothic style on a site overlooking the town. It was designed by William Hague, the well known Dublin architect and protégé of Pugin, and following Hague&#x27;s death by his partner T. F. McNamara and was built at the cost of £300,000(around £50 million in today&#x27;s money), making it the most expensive church in Ireland. St Eunan&#x27;s Cathedral has a spire with a height of 240 feet. White sandstone from Mountcharles was used in the construction. It was shipped along the coast and up the Swilly. Townspeople carried bucketloads of the sandstone to the construction site piece by piece. The cathedral is furnished in oak, with a marble pulpit by Pearse Brothers of Dublin. The pulpit depicts statues of the Four Masters and the Four Evangelists.

The stained glass windows that illuminate the sanctuary and the Lady Chapel are by the Mayer firm of Munich. They depict thirteen scenes from the life of Jesus.

The ceilings are the work of Amici of Rome. The Great Arch illustrates the lives of St Eunan (better known as Adomnán or, locally, Adhamhnáin) and St Columba. The sanctuary lamp is made of solid silver and weighs over 1500 ounces. Willie Pearse, who took part in the Easter Rising, created some of the sculptures found within.

There are 12 bells in the Cathedral bell chamber. They carry the names of the saints of Tír Conail - Dallan, Conal and Fiacre, Adomnán, Baithen and Barron, Nelis and Mura, Fionán and Davog, Cartha and Caitríona, Taobhóg, Cróna and Ríanach, Ernan and Asica and Columba. The 12th bell weighs over 2 tons 5 cwts. After the cathedral was opened the organist played &quot;O&#x27;Donnell Abu&quot;, &quot;St Patrick&#x27;s Day&quot;, &quot;The Last Rose of Summer&quot;, &quot;The Wearing of the Green&quot; and &quot;The Bells of Shandon&quot;.

In 1985, the cathedral was renovated and remodelled to better conform to the liturgical requirements of the Second Vatican Council. Care was taken to preserve the style and materials of the original altar in the new altar table and chair. The original altar-piece, an Irish carving of Leonardo&#x27;s &quot;The Last Supper&quot;, is still present in the cathedral and has been incorporated into the new altar.

The sandstone exterior of the cathedral was cleaned in July 2001. The stone was then repaired and pointed with a special mortar of lime and sand. Krystol Hydrostop was finally applied to the exterior.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Monsignor Gillespie, with Bishop of Raphoe Alan McGuckian, agreed to celebrate weekday morning Mass for the nation on RTÉ Television.

==Clergy==
As of August 2023, St Eunan&#x27;s Cathedral is served by three full-time priests - The Very Reverend Monsignor Kevin Gillespie (Administrator), The Reverend Kizito Kalameera (curate) and The Reverend Damien Nejad (curate). Bishop of Raphoe Most Reverend Alan McGuckian SJ, along with other clergy and retired clergy living in Letterkenny, also help the cathedral parish when required. The Reverend Damien Nejad, of Hiberno-Iranian origin, has a particularly interesting background as he was the first diocesan priest ordained in Ireland to have a Persian family; The Reverend Nejad was born to an Iranian Muslim father and a Catholic mother, originally from Annagry, in, and later grew up in, Glasgow and was baptised at his own request when he was six.

==Adoration Chapel==
The Blessed Sacrament Chapel of Adoration or the Adoration Chapel (as it is more commonly known) is found on the grounds of the adjacent Loreto Convent. Bishop of Raphoe Séamus Hegarty officially opened it on 4 December 1988. This single-room chapel is a reconstructed building based on the site of an old school set up by the Loreto Sisters. It is not definitively known when the original building was constructed; however, during reconstruction work in 1988, a slate bearing a mason&#x27;s mark from the year 1850 was discovered. Barry Feely from County Roscommon designed the chapel&#x27;s granite altar; this is situated in front of a stained glass window which displays the &quot;Virgin of the Sign&quot; icon.

The Adoration Chapel is open from 1 pm on a Sunday afternoon until 8.30 pm Friday evening. The chapel is located in the grounds of the Loreto Convent and College, which is located adjacent to the cathedral.

Devotions are held in the cathedral on the Sundays of May and October at 7.00pm.

==Eponyms==
The adjacent Cathedral Square () and Cathedral Road () are named after the building.

Letterkenny itself is often referred to as &quot;The Cathedral Town&quot;.

<doc id="711136" wikidata="Q300343" url="?curid=711136" title="A Camp">
<text>A Camp is the solo side project of Nina Persson, vocalist for the Swedish indie pop band The Cardigans, her husband, composer Nathan Larson, and former Atomic Swing guitarist Niclas Frisk. Persson formed A Camp when The Cardigans took a break after several years of touring and the recording of their 1998 album &quot;Gran Turismo&quot;. A Camp recorded and released two albums, in 2001 and 2009, after which the project has been inactive. 

==Albums==

===A Camp===

A Camp&#x27;s debut album, also called &quot;A Camp&quot;, was originally recorded with Niclas Frisk of Atomic Swing, before Persson teamed up with Mark Linkous of Sparklehorse to re-record it. In doing so, he also contributed some new songs to the album. Persson had been a long-time fan of Sparklehorse and has referred to them as &quot;the best I&#x27;ve ever heard&quot;. After a gig in Lund, Sweden, Persson gave Linkous a cassette of all the demo A Camp songs. When they met again during the recording of his new album, Persson invited him to produce her project. Linkous listened, liked the songs, and agreed.

The album met with critical acclaim, and reasonable commercial success, topping the charts in Persson&#x27;s native Sweden. 

In 2004, &quot;Charlie Charlie&quot; (the &quot;I Can Buy You&quot; single B-side) was covered (with new lyrics in Polish) by the Polish singer Ania and released as a single from her debut album &quot;Samotność po zmierzchu&quot;. A French version of &quot;Charlie Charlie&quot; was recorded by Vanessa and the O&#x27;s for inclusion on their debut album &quot;La Ballade d&#x27;O&quot; in 2004 which retained the same title. Vanessa &amp; The O&#x27;s featured Niclas Frisk, Andreas Mattsson, James Iha and French singer songwriter Vanessa Quinones.

The debut album released the singles &quot;I Can Buy You&quot; and &quot;Song for the Leftovers&quot;. The country-inspired influence was also apparent in The Cardigans&#x27; following album, &quot;Long Gone Before Daylight&quot;, which was released in the UK in 2003 and the US in 2004.

===Colonia===

The recording of a second A Camp album was confirmed by Persson in an interview with Swedish newspaper &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot; in May 2007. &quot;Girl-pop from the 60s, 80&#x27;s punk, and David Bowie&quot; were said to be the main influences. The album, produced by Persson with husband and film composer Nathan Larson and Atomic Swing&#x27;s Niclas Frisk, features appearances from ex-Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha, Joan As Policewoman and Guided By Voices drummer Kevin March.

The first single from Colonia, &quot;Stronger Than Jesus&quot;, was released on the Swedish iTunes on 17 November 2008. The full album was released in Europe in February 2009, via Universal, and in the US via Nettwerk.

===Covers EP===
A three-track EP named &quot;Covers&quot;, featuring interpretations of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Us And Them&quot;, David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot; and Grace Jones&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;ve Done it Again&quot;, was released digitally in the United States on 9 June 2009 and in Europe on 16 June 2009.

==Post 2009==

Persson has continued to record and perform as a solo artist, and reunite with The Cardigans for occasional tours. There are not known to be any plans for further A Camp recordings.

<doc id="711137" wikidata="Q2726078" url="?curid=711137" title="Short-term mission">
<text>A short-term mission (STM) is the mobilization of a Christian missionary for a short period of time ranging from days to a year; many short-term missions are called mission trips. The short-term missionary is a fairly recent innovation in the global missions movement, but many short-term missions agencies are seeing an increased number of trips that consist of a week up to a year.

==Overview==
Short-term missions started in the 1960s. A few organizations, like YWAM (Youth with a Mission) and OM (Operation Mobilisation) created trips lasting from a month to a year. Short term missions was known as a way for young people to grow their faith and self, while also aiding those in need. Many individual churches joined in on the movement.

Then within the 1970s, high school students began to take part. It grew during the 1980s and was extremely popular in the 1990s. Short-term missions have had different meanings based on the people taking part. Some make it about looking for possible long-term missionaries and helping those who are already involved, where others focus on the spiritual path and growth while helping others. The idea that they are about serving others and growing in faith became the more popular reason to go on a mission trip. More than 2 million Americans participate in these trips yearly. These trips act as a way for numerous people to help the less fortunate. While they are a way to grow spiritually, these trips also act as community service projects.

Generally, missionaries have been people sent to spread their religious faith, usually among the people of another country or region in which that faith is not widely practiced. In the past 50 years, churches have moved toward mobilizing young people for short-term trips.

There are independent STMs organizations as well as denominations and individual churches that facilitate these trips all over the world. Many individuals going on short-term mission trips raise partial or full support from family and friends to help pay for their trip. Costs include not only travel, food and lodging but often associated project expenses as well. In recent years, a number of services like have been established to help individuals raise support for their short-term mission trips using online email and social media tools.

==Statistics==
*$45 billion has been given to Mission Trips
*400,000 foreign missionaries
*5.5 million full time Christian workers
*Only 10% of international students are reached by ministries when in the US
*2.2 billion Christians world-wide

==Criticisms==
There has been attention paid to the shift in the form of modern short-term missionary work, which takes shape in the conflation of spiritualism with contemporary military metaphors and practices. Missionary work as spiritual warfare is the latest iteration in a long-standing relationship between Christian missions and militarization. Spiritual warriors are aggressive prayer intercessors who can pray openly in public spaces with a goal of imposing change onto another party or group. The fact that the intensification of militarization in recent years has extended to the missionary practices of some charismatic Christians does not mean that all missions, short-term or otherwise, need be implicated. But contemporary military metaphors and practices as a generative force animating the sphere of Christian spiritualism is becoming more and more notable as social militarization of everyday life increases, and should be questioned in the context of efforts to spread a particular religious faith.

<text>Paul McCrane (born January 19, 1961) is an American film, television and theatre actor, as well as a television director and singer. He is known for his portrayal of Montgomery MacNeil in the 1980 film &quot;Fame&quot;, Frank Berry in the 1984 film &quot;The Hotel New Hampshire&quot;, Emil Antonowsky in &quot;RoboCop&quot;, and Robert Romano on the NBC medical drama television series &quot;ER&quot;.

==Early life==
McCrane was born on January 19, 1961, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Eileen C. (née Manyak) and James J. McCrane, Jr. His family moved to Richboro, Pennsylvania, where he lived until he moved to New York City after graduating from Holy Ghost Preparatory School in 1978. He studied theatre at HB Studio in New York City.

==Career==
An early role, when he was just 18 years of age, is in a short scene in &quot;Rocky II&quot;, playing a multi-fracture patient who asks for Rocky&#x27;s autograph on his head cast (&quot;Hey Rocky...sign my head!&quot;).

With an abundance of red hair, McCrane portrayed the earnest Montgomery MacNeil in &quot;Fame&quot;. He was the lead vocalist on three songs in the feature film: &quot;Dogs in the Yard&quot;, &quot;Miles from Here&quot; and &quot;Is it Okay if I Call You Mine?&quot; He also had a solo in &quot;I Sing the Body Electric&quot;.

Later, he played confused Frank Berry in &quot;The Hotel New Hampshire&quot;, murderous Emil Antonowsky in &quot;RoboCop&quot;, followed by astronaut Pete Conrad in &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, Guard Trout in &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, cancer-absorbing mutant Leonard Betts in &quot;The X-Files&quot;. After a recurring role as the snarky Dr. Robert &quot;Rocket&quot; Romano on &quot;ER&quot;, he became a regular cast member (1997–2003) and returned for one episode during its 15th and final season (2008). McCrane guest-starred in &quot;24&quot; Seasons 5 and 6 as Graem Bauer. He has also appeared on &quot;Ugly Betty&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

In 2011, McCrane took on the recurring role of Assistant District Attorney Josh Peyton in the NBC television program &quot;Harry&#x27;s Law,&quot; a project of producer David E. Kelley. McCrane won the 2011 Emmy Award for Guest Actor in a Drama Series for his performance in the role. In 2019, he was cast in a recurring role on the CBS TV series &quot;All Rise&quot;.

<doc id="711139" wikidata="Q518638" url="?curid=711139" title="Nonsense mutation">
<text>In genetics, a nonsense mutation is a point mutation in a sequence of DNA that results in a &quot;nonsense codon&quot;, or a premature stop codon in the transcribed mRNA, and leads to a truncated, incomplete, and possibly nonfunctional protein product. Nonsense mutations are not always harmful; the functional effect of a nonsense mutation depends on many aspects, such as the location of the stop codon within the coding DNA. For example, the effect of a nonsense mutation depends on the proximity of the nonsense mutation to the original stop codon, and the degree to which functional subdomains of the protein are affected. As nonsense mutations leads to premature termination of polypeptide chains; they are also called chain termination mutations.

Missense mutations differ from nonsense mutations since they are point mutations that exhibit a single nucleotide change to cause substitution of a different amino acid. A nonsense mutation also differs from a nonstop mutation, which is a point mutation that removes a stop codon. About 10% of patients facing genetic diseases have involvement with nonsense mutations. Some of the diseases that these mutations can cause are Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), cystic fibrosis (CF), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), cancers, metabolic diseases, and neurologic disorders. The rate of nonsense mutations is variable from gene-to-gene and tissue-to-tissue, but gene silencing occurs in every patient with a nonsense mutation.

== Simple example ==

 DNA: 5′—ATG ACT CAC CGA GCG CGA AGC TGA—3′
 3′—TAC TGA GTG GCT CGC GCT TCG ACT—5′&lt;br&gt;
 mRNA: 5′—AUG ACU CAC CGA GCG CGA AGC UGA—3′&lt;br&gt;
 Protein: N—Met Thr His Arg Ala Arg Ser Stop—C

The example above begins with a 5&#x27; DNA sequence with 24 nucleotides (8 triplet codons) seen and its complementary strand shown below. The next row highlights the 5&#x27; mRNA strand, which is generated through transcription. Lastly, the final row showcases which the amino acids that are translated from each respective codon, with the eighth and final codon representing the stop codon. The codons corresponding to the fourth amino acid, Arginine (Arg), are highlighted because they will undergo a nonsense mutation in the following figure of this example.

 DNA: 5′—ATG ACT CAC TGA GCG CGA AGC TGA—3′
 3′—TAC TGA GTG ACT CGC GCT TCG ACT—5′&lt;br&gt;
 mRNA: 5′—AUG ACU CAC UGA GCG CGU AGC UGA—3′&lt;br&gt;
 Protein: N—Met Thr His Stop—C

Now, suppose that a nonsense mutation was introduced at the fourth codon in the 5′ DNA sequence (CGA) causing the cytosine to be replaced with thymine, yielding TGA in the 5′ DNA sequence and ACT in the complementary strand. Because ACT is transcribed as UGA, it is translated as a stop codon. This leads the remaining codons of the mRNA to not be translated into protein because the stop codon is prematurely reached during translation. This can yield a truncated (&quot;i.e.&quot;, abbreviated) protein product, which quite often lacks the functionality of the normal, non-mutant protein.

== Possible outcomes ==
=== Deleterious ===
Deleterious outcomes represent the majority of nonsense mutations and are the most common outcome that is observed naturally. Deleterious nonsense mutations decreases the overall fitness and reproductive success of the organism. For example, a nonsense mutation occurring in a gene encoding a protein can cause structural or functional defects in the protein that disrupt cellular biology. Depending on the significance of the functions of this protein, this disruption now could be detrimental to the fitness and survival of that organism.

=== Neutral ===
When a nonsense mutation is neutral, it does not provide benefits or harm. These occur when the effects of the mutation are unnoticed. In other words, this means that the mutation does not positively or negatively affect the organism. As this effect is unnoticed, there is a lack of papers describing such mutations. An example of this type of nonsense mutation is one that occurs directly before the original stop codon for that given protein. Because this mutation occurred in such close proximity to the end of the protein chain, the impact of this change might not be as significant. This would suggest that this amino acid that was mutated did not have a large impact on the overall structure or function of the protein or the organism as a whole. This scenario is rare, but possible.

=== Beneficial ===
Beneficial nonsense mutations are considered as the rarest of possible nonsense mutation outcomes. Beneficial nonsense mutations increase the overall fitness and reproductive success of an organism, opposite of the effects of a deleterious mutation. Because a nonsense mutation introduces a premature stop codon within a sequence of DNA, it is extremely unlikely that this scenario can actually benefit the organism. An example of this would occur with a nonsense mutation that impacts a dysfunctional protein that releases toxins. The stop codon that this mutation brings would stop this dysfunctional protein from properly carrying out its function. Stopping this protein from performing at full strength causes less toxin to be released and the fitness of the organism to be improved. These types of situations with nonsense mutations occur a lot less frequently than the deleterious outcomes.

== Suppressing nonsense mutations ==

Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay

Despite an expected tendency for premature termination codons to yield shortened polypeptide products, in fact the formation of truncated proteins does not occur often &quot;in vivo&quot;. Many organisms—including humans and lower species, such as yeast—employ a nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway, which degrades mRNAs containing nonsense mutations before they are able to be translated into nonfunctional polypeptides.

tRNA Suppression

Because nonsense mutations result in altered mRNA with a premature stop codon, one way of suppressing the damage done to the final protein&#x27;s function is to alter the tRNA that reads the mRNA. These tRNA’s are termed suppressor tRNA&#x27;s. If the stop codon is UAG, any other amino acid tRNA could be altered from its original anticodon to AUC so it will recognize the UAG codon instead. This will result in the protein not being truncated, but it may still have an altered amino acid. These suppressor tRNA mutations are only possible if the cell has more than one tRNA that reads a particular codon, otherwise the mutation would kill the cell. The only stop codons are UAG, UAA, and UGA. UAG and UAA suppressors read their respective stop codons instead of their original codon, but UAA suppressors also read UAG due to wobble base pairing. UGA suppressors are very rare. Another hurdle to pass in this technique is the fact that stop codons are also recognized by release factors, so the tRNA still needs to compete with the release factors to keep the translation going. Because of this, suppression is usually only 10-40% successful. These suppressor tRNA mutations also target stop codons that are not mutations, causing some proteins to be much longer than they should be. Only bacteria and lower eukaryotes can survive with these mutations, mammal and insect cells die as a result of a suppressor mutation.

For historical reasons the three stop codons were given names (see Stop codons): UAG is called the amber codon, UAA is called the ochre codon, and UGA is called the opal codon.

== Common disease-associated nonsense mutations ==
Nonsense mutations comprise around 20% of single nucleotide substitutions within protein coding sequences that result in human disease. Nonsense mutation-mediated pathology is often attributed to reduced amounts of full-length protein, because only 5-25% of transcripts possessing nonsense mutations do not undergo nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Translation of the remaining nonsense-bearing mRNA may generate abbreviated protein variants with toxic effects.

Twenty-three different single-point nucleotide substitutions are capable of converting a non-stop codon into a stop-codon, with the mutations CGAformula_1TGA and CAGformula_1TAG being the most common disease-related substitutions characterized in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD). As a result of different substitution frequencies for each nucleotide, the proportions of the three stop codons generated by disease-inducing nonsense mutations differs from stop codon distributions in non-diseased gene variants. Notably, the codon TAG is overrepresented, while the TGA and TAA codons are underrepresented in disease-related nonsense mutations.

Translation termination efficiency is influenced by the specific stop codon sequence on the mRNA, with the UAA sequence yielding the highest termination. Sequences surrounding the stop codon also impact termination efficiency. Consequently, the underlying pathology of diseases caused by nonsense mutations is ultimately dependent on the identity of the mutated gene, and specific location of the mutation.

Examples of diseases induced by nonsense mutations include:

* Cystic fibrosis (caused by the G542X mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)
* Beta thalassaemia (β-globin)
* Hurler syndrome
* Dravet syndrome
* Usher syndrome

Nonsense mutations in other genes may also drive dysfunction of several tissue or organ systems:

SMAD8

SMAD8 is the eighth homolog of the ENDOGLIN gene family and is involved in the signaling between TGF-b/BMP. It has been identified that novel nonsense mutations in SMAD8 are associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension. The pulmonary system relies on SMAD1, SMAD5, and SMAD 8 to regulate pulmonary vascular function. Downregulation and loss of signals that are normally operated by SMAD8 contributed to pathogenesis in pulmonary arterial hypertension. The ALK1 gene, a part of the TGF-B signaling family, was found to have been mutated while also down-regulating the SMAD8 gene in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. SMAD8 mutants were not phosphorylated by ALK1, disrupting interactions with SMAD4 that would normally allow for signaling in wild-type organisms.

=== LGR4 ===
LGR4 binds R-spondins to activate the Wnt signaling pathway. Wnt signaling regulates bone mass and osteoblast differentiation and is important for the development of bone, heart, and muscle. An LGR4 nonsense mutation in a healthy population has been linked to low bone mass density and symptoms of osteoporosis. LGR4 mutant mice showed the observed low bone mass is not due to age-related bone loss. Mutations in LGR4 have been associated with family lineages with medical histories of rare bone disorders. Wild-type mice lacking LGR4 also displayed delayed osteoblast differentiation during development, showcasing the important role of LGR4 in bone mass regulation and development.

== Therapeutics targeting nonsense mutation diseases ==
Therapeutics for diseases caused by nonsense mutations attempt to recapitulate wild-type function by decreasing the efficacy of NMD, facilitating readthrough of the premature stop codon during translation, or editing the genomic nonsense mutation.

Antisense oligonucleotides to suppress the expression of NMD and translation termination proteins are being explored in animal models of nonsense mutation-induced disease. Other RNA therapeutics under investigation include synthetic suppressor tRNAs that enable ribosomes to insert an amino acid, instead of initiating chain termination, upon encountering premature stop codons.

CRISPR-Cas9 based single nucleotide substitutions have been used to generate amino acid codons from stop codons, achieving an editing success rate of 10% in cell cultures.

Read-through has been achieved using small molecule drugs such as aminoglycosides and negamycin. An oxadiazole, ataluren (previously PTC124), facilitates the selective read-through of aberrant stop codons, rendering it a potential therapeutic against nonsense mutation-induced disease. Ataluren, sold under the tradename Translarna, is currently an approved treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy in the European Economic area and Brazil. However, phase III trials of Ataluren as a cystic fibrosis therapeutic have failed to meet their primary endpoints.

<text>The Powder River is a tributary of the Snake River, approximately long, in northeast Oregon in the United States. It drains an area of the Columbia Plateau on the eastern side of the Blue Mountains. It flows almost entirely within Baker County but downstream of the city of North Powder forms part of the border between Baker County and Union County.

==Name==
The name &quot;Powder River&quot; is first recorded in the journals of Peter Skene Ogden without notation of the origin of the name. Explorer Donald Mackenzie likely named the river. William C. McKay, grandson of John Jacob Astor&#x27;s partner Alexander MacKay, says that the origin of the name is from the powdery and sandy soil along the shores of the river, from the Chinook Jargon &quot;polalle illahe&quot;. It appears on Lewis and Clark&#x27;s maps as &quot;Port-pel-lah&quot;.

==Course==
The Powder River&#x27;s tributaries arise in the southern Blue Mountains in the Umatilla National Forest. The river&#x27;s main stem begins in Sumpter, where McCully Fork, Cracker Creek and several smaller tributaries join, and flows east-southeast through the tailings of past dredge mining and into Phillips Reservoir. After exiting Phillips Reservoir, the river continues east for about before turning sharply north through the Bowen Valley and Baker City, Oregon. From here the river meanders the floor of the Baker Valley and passes by the cities of Haines and North Powder, where it is joined by the North Powder River. Here the river turns again sharply east-southeast, flowing through Thief Valley Reservoir, in a valley along the southern edge of the Wallowa Mountains. The river then transits the Lower Powder Valley and enters the Snake River on the Idaho–Oregon state line from the west, upstream from the Brownlee Dam at the Powder Arm of Brownlee Reservoir downstream from Richland.

===Tributaries===
Major streams flowing into the Powder are Eagle Creek, Wolf Creek, Rock Creek and the North Powder River.

==Watershed==

The Powder River watershed drains of northeastern Oregon. There are three man-made reservoirs on the Powder River: Phillips Reservoir (behind Mason Dam), Thief Valley Reservoir, and also the Powder arm of Brownlee Reservoir at the Oregon–Idaho border at the confluence of the Powder and Snake Rivers.

In 1988, of the Powder River was designated Wild and Scenic. Between the Thief Valley Dam and the Oregon Route 203 bridge, this stretch flows through a rugged canyon with spectacular geologic formations.

==Flora and fauna==
Beaver (&quot;Castor canadensis&quot;) populations are increasing along the river, with an excellent viewing area just off Oregon Route 7 below Mason Dam, about from Baker City. There, a colony of beavers constructed a large dam easily viewed below the footbridge adjacent to the paved parking area. Recovered from near extirpation by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, who tried to create a &quot;fur desert&quot; to discourage Americans from coming to the far western states, benefits of beaver in arid eastern Oregon include creating ponds which along young salmonids to grow, raising the water table as their ponds recharge groundwater supplies and creating wetlands which trap sediment and pollutants.

The Powder River was once an important spawning stream for Chinook salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha&quot;) and steelhead trout (&quot;Oncorhyncus mykiss&quot;) coming from the Pacific Ocean. Chinook salmon once migrated by the thousands to spawn in the Powder River and many of its tributaries from its headwaters to the lower end of the North Powder Valley, but that stopped when the Thief Valley Dam was built near North Powder in 1931. The building of two later dams in Hells Canyon on the Snake River – Hells Canyon Dam (1967) and Brownlee Dam also permanently block salmon passage. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife often release Chinook salmon on the Powder River for sportfishing at Mason Dam below Phillips Reservoir.

<doc id="711146" wikidata="Q1507456" url="?curid=711146" title="George H. Bender">
<text>George Harrison Bender (September 29, 1896June 18, 1961) was an American Republican politician from Ohio. He served in the United States House of Representatives from 1939 to 1949 and 1951 to 1954. He also served in the U.S. Senate from 1954 to 1957.

==Early life==
George was born in Cleveland to Czech immigrants Joseph Bender, an employee at General Electric, and Anna Šírová (1866–1933). Anna was born in Fryšava pod Žákovou horou to Jan Šír and Anna Slámová, baptized under the Calvinist Helvetian Reform church in Nové Město na Moravě. Bender attended West Commerce High School, graduating in 1914. Bender was of Czech descent. With an early interest in politics, at 15, he collected 10,000 signatures on a petition encouraging former president Theodore Roosevelt to run for the presidency in 1912. Bender presented the petition to Roosevelt personally and was rewarded when Roosevelt wrote him with news of his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination, shortly before it was publicly announced. In 1916, Bender served as a delegate to the abortive Progressive Party convention, which voted to dissolve rather than nominate its own presidential candidate. During the November election, Bender campaigned for Republican Party candidates. His shifting party orientation reflected the internal divisions between &quot;progressive&quot; and &quot;Old Guard&quot; Republicans from 1912 to 1916.

===Family life===
In 1920, he married Edna Eckhardt; they had two daughters. During his life and political career, Bender held a series of jobs and began a number of business ventures to support his family. His business career included stints as a department store advertising manager, manager of the Cleveland Stadium, and proprietor of a start-up business, the Bender Insurance Company. However, politics remained his only genuine interest.

==State politics==
In 1920, as a Republican, he became the youngest person to win a seat in the Ohio Senate to that time. Serving until 1930, he had limited influence. He pushed unsuccessfully for the introduction of teacher tenure. Initially a strong supporter of Prohibition, he changed his attitude after the police had received an anonymous tip and raided his house in search of liquor. They found nothing, but Bender thereafter vehemently opposed the alcohol ban. In 1934, he founded the &quot;National Republican&quot; and the &quot;Ohio Republican&quot; magazines, which he also edited and published.

==US Representative==
After losing four bids for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1930, 1932, 1934, and 1936, he at last won in 1938. He was re-elected until 1948, a Democratic electoral year. He won the seat back in 1950 and retained it for four more years.

Strongly opposed to President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s foreign and domestic policies, Bender articulated his criticism in the polemical &quot;The Challenge of 1940&quot; (1940). The only aspects of Roosevelt&#x27;s agenda that escaped Bender&#x27;s censure were some humanitarian New Deal programs, notably the Works Progress Administration, which he accepted only as a temporary measure. With the onset of the Cold War after 1945, Bender opposed the Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine.

He did not question the necessity of helping European countries devastated by the war, but he disagreed with the idea that the US government should take a direct role in channeling the relief aid. He argued that assistance for European recovery should come through the United Nations or private relief organizations. He also fervently opposed aid to Greece and Turkey, where British influence had been strong, on the premise that US involvement in the region only accommodated the &quot;needs of a collapsing British empire&quot; but did not benefit the United States.

His reputation for strong party loyalty brought Bender the job of organizer for Ohio Senator Robert A. Taft&#x27;s candidacy for the presidential nomination at the 1948 and 1952 Republican National Conventions. His public role included arranging musical entertainment, conducting singing, leading demonstrations, and ringing cowbells. His often-comic antics led to many unfairly dismissive jokes, as his opponents quickly dubbed him the &quot;Clown Prince.&quot; That mockery did not diminish the fact that he remained a serious and influential political figure.

Bender was in a famous 1952 newsreel addressing a gathering of over 15,000 people in the Cleveland Public Auditorium immediately after Richard Nixon had given his wildly successful Checkers speech on television. Bender asked the crowd to show if it was for Nixon and was greeted with a thunderous ovation of support.

==US Senator==
After Taft&#x27;s death in 1953, Bender narrowly won the election for the vacant Senate seat and served the remaining two years of its term. An avowed supporter of President Dwight Eisenhower, Bender consistently endorsed both Republican Party and presidential initiatives. His earlier isolationist views softened considerably, and he now approved of more direct US involvement abroad, including aid to countries of the former British Empire. Bender, however, joined with two fellow Republicans and three Democrats in voting in favor of a motion to adjourn for five minutes in late July 1956 that amounted to a vote for getting a civil rights bill to the floor and also, at some level, a rebellion against the prerogatives of party leaders.

In 1956, he lost his Senate seat to Governor Frank J. Lausche, a popular Democrat. Bender then worked as special assistant to the Secretary of the Interior from June 1957 to May 1958 and campaigned for the incorporation of Alaska as the 49th state.

==Teamsters investigation==

In 1958, Jimmy Hoffa hired Bender to chair a commission investigating racketeering in the Teamsters. After being appointed as the three-man commission&#x27;s chairman. Bender proceeded independently to send a form letter to every Teamster local in the country. The letter asked the local officials to supply information on &quot;any racketeering or gangster alliances&quot; of which they might be aware within their respective Teamster subunits.

In December 1958, with his research into the locals completed, Bender reported preliminarily to Hoffa that he had found the International Brotherhood of Teamsters &quot;free of corruption.&quot; The ex-senator&#x27;s two colleagues on the commission almost immediately disclaimed any responsibility for that finding. Bender continued his &quot;investigation&quot; with the same degree of intensity until early May 1959 and charged the Teamsters a formidable $58,636.07 in salary and expenses for his efforts.

His political career eventually became clouded by allegations of corruption in his ties to the Teamsters. He was accused of curtailing a 1956 investigation into the organization after receiving a $40,000 campaign contribution. The United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management looked into the accusations in autumn 1958 but recommended no actions.

In his testimony during the hearings with Senator Barry Goldwater, Bender defended his behavior: &quot;When you run for office, you have to have the votes of the washed and the unwashed as well. If cats and dogs could vote I&#x27;d shake hands with them.&quot; He subsequently lost both a 1960 bid to be a delegate to the Republican National Convention and a 1961 campaign for the post of Republican Precinct Committeeman.

== Retirement and death ==
He retreated to a self-imposed retirement and died in Chagrin Falls, a suburb of Cleveland. He was buried at Knollwood Cemetery in Mayfield Heights, Ohio.

It is often known by the abbreviated name takahē, which it shares with the recently extinct North Island takahē. The two takahē species are also known as notornis.

Takahē were hunted extensively by both early European settlers and Māori, and takahē&#x27;s bones have been found in middens in the South Island. Fossil remains have also been found across the South Island. They were not named and described by Europeans until 1847, and then only from fossil bones. In 1850 a living bird was captured, and three more collected in the 19th century. After another bird was captured in 1898, and no more were to be found, the species was presumed extinct. Fifty years later, however, after a carefully planned search, South Island takahē were dramatically rediscovered in November 1948 by Geoffrey Orbell in an isolated valley in the South Island&#x27;s Murchison Mountains. The species is now managed by the New Zealand Department of Conservation, whose Takahē Recovery Programme maintains populations on several offshore islands as well as Takahē Valley. Takahē has been reintroduced to numerous locations across the country. Although South Island takahē are still a threatened species, their NZTCS status was downgraded in 2016 from Nationally Critical to Nationally Vulnerable. As of 2023, the population is around 500 and is growing by 8 percent per year.

==Scientific description and naming==
Anatomist Richard Owen was sent fossil bird bones found in 1847 in South Taranaki on the North Island by collector Walter Mantell, and in 1848 he coined the genus &quot;Notornis&quot; (&quot;southern bird&quot;) for them, naming the new species &quot;Notornis mantelli&quot;. The bird was presumed by Western science to be another extinct species like the moa.

Two years later, a group of sealers in Tamatea / Dusky Sound, Fiordland, encountered a large bird which they chased with their dogs. &quot;It ran with great speed, and upon being captured uttered loud screams, and fought and struggled violently; it was kept alive three or four days on board the schooner and then killed, and the body roasted and ate by the crew, each partaking of the dainty, which was declared to be delicious.&quot; Walter Mantell happened to meet the sealers, and secured the bird&#x27;s skin from them. He sent it to his father, palaeontologist Gideon Mantell, who realised this was &quot;Notornis&quot;, a living bird known only from fossil bones, and presented it in 1850 to a meeting of the Zoological Society of London. A second specimen was sent to Gideon Mantell in 1851, caught by Māori on Secretary Island, Fiordland. (Takahē were well known to Māori, who travelled long distances to hunt them. The bird&#x27;s name comes from the Māori verb &quot;takahi&quot;, to stamp or trample.)

Only two more South Island takahē were collected by Europeans in the 19th century. One was caught by a rabbiter&#x27;s dog on the eastern side of Lake Te Anau in 1879. It was bought by what is now the State Museum of Zoology, Dresden, for £105, and destroyed during the bombing of Dresden in World War II. Another takahē was caught by another dog, also on the shore of Lake Te Anau, on 7 August 1898; the dog, named &#x27;Rough&#x27;, was owned by musterer Jack Ross. Ross tried to revive the female takahē, but it died, and he delivered it to curator William Benham at Otago Museum. In excellent condition, it was purchased by the New Zealand government for £250 and was put on display; for many years it was the only mounted specimen in New Zealand, and the only takahē on display anywhere in the world.

After 1898, hunters and settlers continued to report sightings of large blue-and-green birds, described as &quot;giant pukakis&quot; (pūkeko or Australasian swamphens); one group chased but could not catch a bird &quot;the size of a goose, with blue-green feathers and the speed of a racehorse&quot;. None of the sightings were authenticated, and the only specimens collected were fossil bones. The takahē was considered extinct.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==

The third takahē collected went to the Königlich Zoologisches und Anthropologisch-Ethnographisches Museum in Dresden, and the Director Adolf Bernhard Meyer examined the skeleton while preparing his classification of the museum&#x27;s birds, &quot;Abbildungen von Vogelskeletten&quot; (1879–1895). He decided the skeletal differences between the Fiordland bird and Owen&#x27;s North Island specimen were sufficient to make it a separate species, which he called &quot;Notornis hochstetteri&quot;, after the Austrian geologist Ferdinand von Hochstetter.

Over the second half of the 20th century, the two &quot;Notornis&quot; species were gradually relegated to subspecies: &quot;Notornis mantelli mantelli&quot; in the North Island, and &quot;Notornis mantelli hochstetteri&quot; in the South. They were then incorporated into the same genus as the closely related Australasian swamphen or pūkeko (&quot;Porphyrio porphyrio&quot;), becoming a subspecies of &quot;Porphyrio mantelli&quot;. Pūkeko are members of a widespread species of swamphen, but based on fossil evidence have only been in New Zealand for a few hundred years, arriving from Australia after the islands were first settled by Polynesians.

A morphological and genetic study of living and extinct &quot;Porphyrio&quot; revealed that North and South Island takahē were, as originally proposed by Meyer, separate species. The North Island species (&quot;P. mantelli&quot;, as described by Owen) was known to Māori as &quot;moho&quot;; it is extinct and only known from skeletal remains and one possible specimen. Moho were taller and more slender than takahē, and share a common ancestor with living pūkeko. Although it was historically proposed that the two takahē species were unrelated, a genetic analysis published in 2024 suggested that both takahē species are each others closest relatives and likely descended from a single ancestor that colonised New Zealand, with the split between the two species dated at around 4 to 1.5 million years ago.

== Rediscovery ==
Living South Island takahē were rediscovered in an expedition led by Invercargill-based physician Geoffrey Orbell near Lake Te Anau in the Murchison Mountains, on 20 November 1948. The expedition started when footprints of an unknown bird were found near Lake Te Anau. Two takahē were caught but returned to the wild after photos were taken of the rediscovered bird.

==Description==
The South Island takahē is the largest living member of the family Rallidae. Its overall length averages and its average weight is about in males and in females, ranging from . The lifespan of a takahē can range from 18 years in the wild or 22 in animal sanctuaries. Its standing height is around . It is a stocky, powerful bird, with short strong legs and a massive bill which can deliver a painful bite to the unwary. Although a flightless bird, the takahē sometimes uses its reduced wings to help it clamber up slopes.

South Island takahē plumage, beaks, and legs show typical gallinule colours. Adult takahē plumage is silky, iridescent, and mostly dark-blue or navy-blue on the head, neck, and underside, peacock blue on the wings. The back and inner wings are teal and green, becoming olive-green at the tail, which is white underneath. Takahe have a bright scarlet frontal shield and &quot;carmine beaks marbled with shades of red&quot;. Their scarlet legs were described as &quot;crayfish-red&quot; by one of the early rediscoverers.

Sexes are similar; the females are slightly smaller, and may display frayed tail feathers when nesting. Chicks are covered with jet-black fluffy down when hatched, and have very large brown legs, with a dark white-tipped bill. Immature takahē have a duller version of adult colouring, with a dark bill that turns red as they mature.

South Island takahē are noisy. They have a non-directional warning &#x27; call, which was described by the rediscoverers of takahē as someone &quot;whistling to them over a .303 cartridge case&quot;, and a loud &#x27; call. The contact call is easily confused with that of the weka (&quot;Gallirallus australis&quot;), but is generally more resonant and deeper.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The South Island takahē is a sedentary and flightless bird currently found in alpine grasslands habitats. It is territorial and remains in the grassland until the arrival of snow, when it descends to the forest or scrub. It eats grass, shoots, and insects, but predominantly leaves of &quot;Chionochloa&quot; tussocks and other alpine grass species. The South Island takahē can often be seen plucking a snow grass (&quot;Danthonia flavescens&quot;) stalk, taking it into one claw, and eating only the soft lower parts, which appears to be its favourite food, while the rest is discarded.

A South Island takahē has been recorded feeding on a paradise duckling at Zealandia. Although this behaviour was previously unknown, the related Australasian swamphen or pūkeko occasionally feeds on eggs and nestlings of other birds as well.

===Breeding===
The South Island takahē is monogamous, with pairs remaining together from 12 years to, probably, their entire lives. It builds a bulky nest under bushes and scrub, and lays one to three buff eggs. The chick survival rate is between 25% and 80%, depending on location.

==Distribution and habitat==
The takahē&#x27;s preferred habitat is alpine grasslands. The species is still present in the location where it was rediscovered in the Murchison Mountains. Small numbers have also been successfully translocated to five predator-free offshore islands, Tiritiri Matangi, Kapiti, Maud, Mana and Motutapu, where they can be viewed by the public. Additionally, captive takahē can be viewed at Te Anau and Pūkaha / Mount Bruce National wildlife centres. In June 2006 a pair of takahē were relocated to the Maungatautari Restoration Project. In September 2010 a pair of takahē (Hamilton and Guy) were released at Willowbank Wildlife Reserve – the first non-Department of Conservation institution to hold this species. In January 2011 two takahē were released in Zealandia, Wellington, and in mid-2015, two more takahē were released on Rotoroa Island in the Hauraki Gulf. There have also been relocations onto the Tawharanui Peninsula. In 2014 two pairs of Takahē were released into Wairakei golf and sanctuary, a private fenced sanctuary at Wairakei north of Taupō, the first chick was born there in November 2015.
At October 2017 there were 347 takahē accounted for, an increase of 41 over 2016. The Orokonui Ecosanctuary is home to a single takahē breeding pair, Quammen and Paku. The pair successfully bred two chicks in 2018, both of which died from exposure after heavy rains in November 2018. The deaths caused some controversy with regards to the Ecosanctuary&#x27;s policy of &quot;non-interference&quot;.

In 2018, eighteen South Island takahē were reintroduced to the Kahurangi National Park, 100 years after their local extinction.

Following the 2018 release, a second re-introduction has taken place on Te Waipounamu in August 2023, eighteen takahē were released in the Upper Whakatipu Waimāori Valley in Ngāi Tahu owned Greenstone Station. Later that year in October, six more takahē were released onto the property.

==Status and conservation==
The near extinction of the formerly widespread South Island takahē is due to a number of factors: over-hunting, loss of habitat and introduced predators have all played a part. The introduction of red deer (&quot;Cervus elaphus&quot;) represent a severe competition for food, while stoats (&quot;Mustela erminea&quot;) take a role as predators. The spread of the forests in post-glacial Pleistocene-Holocene has contributed to the reduction of habitat. Since the species is K-selected, i.e. is long-lived, reproduces slowly, takes several years to reach maturity, and had a large range that has drastically contracted in comparatively few generations, inbreeding depression is a significant problem. The recovery efforts are hampered especially by low fertility of the remaining birds. Genetic analyses have been employed to select captive breeding stock in an effort to preserve the maximum genetic diversity.

===Decline of takahē===
The causes of the pre-European decline of takahē were postulated by Williams (1962) and later supported in a detailed report by Mills &quot;et al.&quot; (1984). They held that climate changes were the main cause of the low numbers of takahē before European settlement. The environmental conditions prior to the period of European settlement were not suitable for takahē, and eliminated most of the population. The rising temperatures were not tolerated by this group of birds. Takahē are adapted to alpine grasslands, and the post-glacial era modified those zones, causing a sharp decline in the takahē population.

Secondly, they suggested that Polynesian settlers arriving about 800–1,000 years ago, bringing dogs and Polynesian rats (&quot;Rattus exulans&quot;) and hunting takahē for food, started another decline. European settlement in the nineteenth century almost wiped them out through hunting and introducing mammals such as deer which competed for food and predators (e.g. stoats) which preyed on them directly. 

===Takahē population, conservation and protection===

After long threats of extinction, South Island takahē now find protection in Fiordland National Park (New Zealand&#x27;s largest national park). However, the species has not made a stable recovery in this habitat since they were rediscovered in November 1948. In fact, the takahē population was at 400 before it was reduced to 118 in 1982 due to competition with Fiordland domestic deer. Conservationists noticed the threat that deer posed to takahē survival, and the national park has now implemented deer control with hunting by helicopter.

The rediscovery of the South Island takahē caused great public interest. The New Zealand government took immediate action by closing off a remote part of Fiordland National Park to prevent the birds from being bothered. However, at the moment of rediscovery, there were different perspectives on how the bird should be conserved. At first, the Forest and Bird Society advocated for takahē to be left to work out their own &quot;destiny&quot;, but many worried that the takahē would be incapable of making a comeback and thus become extinct like New Zealand&#x27;s native huia. Interventionists then sought to relocate the takahē to &quot;island sanctuaries&quot; and breed them in captivity. Ultimately, no action was taken for nearly a decade due to a lack of resources and a desire to avoid conflict.

The Burwood Takahē Breeding Centre was opened in 1985 at a site near Te Anau. The initial approach was to incubate eggs collected from nests and raise them by hand. Staff used hand-held puppets that replayed sounds of adult contact calls while feeding and interacting with the chicks, to help prevent the birds becoming &quot;imprinted&quot; on humans. Fibreglass replicas of adult birds were also placed in areas where the chicks slept. These methods were not used after 2011.

Biologists from the Department of Conservation drew on their experience with designing remote island sanctuaries to establish a safe habitat for takahē and translocate birds onto Maud Island (Marlborough Sounds), Mana Island (near Wellington), Kapiti Island (Kapiti Coast), and Tiritiri Matangi Island (Hauraki Gulf). The success of these translocations has meant that the takahē&#x27;s island metapopulation appears to have reached its carrying capacity, as revealed by the increasing ratio of non-breeding to breeding adults and declines in produced offspring. This may lead to reduced population growth rates and increased rates of inbreeding over time, thereby posing problems regarding the maintenance of genetic diversity and thus takahē survival in the long term.

Recently, human intervention has been required to maintain the breeding success of the takahē, which is relatively low in the wild compared to other, less threatened species, so methods such as the removal of infertile eggs from nests and the captive rearing of chicks have been introduced to manage the takahē population. The Fiordland takahē population has a successful degree of reproductive output due to these management methods: the number of chicks per pairing with infertile egg removal and captive rearing is 0.66, compared to 0.43 for regions without any breeding management.

It was reported that several takahē have accidentally been killed by hunters under contract to the Department of Conservation in the course of control measures aimed at reducing populations of the similar-looking pūkeko. One bird was killed in 2009 and four more—equivalent to 5% of the total population—in 2015.

===Future efforts for protection===

The original recovery strategies and goals set in the early 1980s, both long-term and short-term, are now well under way.

The programme to move South Island takahē to predator-free island refuges, where the birds also receive supplementary feeding, began in 1984. Takahē can now be found on five small islands; Maud Island (Marlborough Sounds), Mana Island (off Wellington&#x27;s west coast), Kapiti Island (off Wellington&#x27;s west coast), Tiritiri Matangi Island (Hauraki Gulf) and Motutapu Island (Hauraki Gulf). The Department of Conservation also runs a captive breeding and rearing programme at the Burwood Breeding Centre near Te Anau which has up to 25 breeding pairs. Chicks are reared with minimal human contact. The offspring of the captive birds are used for new island releases and to add to the wild population in the Murchison Mountains. The Department of Conservation also manages wild takahē nests to boost the birds&#x27; recovery.

An important management development has been the stringent control of deer in the Murchison Mountains and other takahē areas of Fiordland National Park. Following the introduction of deer hunting by helicopter, deer numbers have decreased dramatically and alpine vegetation is now recovering from years of heavy browsing. This improvement in its habitat has helped to increase takahē breeding success and survival. As of 2009, ongoing research aims to measure the impact of attacks by stoats and thus decide whether stoats are a significant problem requiring management.

== Population ==
One of the original long-term goals was to establish a self-sustaining population of well over 500 South Island takahē. The population stood at 263 at the beginning of 2013. In 2016 the population rose to 306 takahē. In 2017 the population rose to 347—a 13 percent increase from the last year. In 2019, it increased to 418. As of 2023, the population is around 500.

<text>Thomas Aloysius Burke (October 30, 1898December 5, 1971) was an American politician from Ohio. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 48th mayor of Cleveland, Ohio, from 1946 to 1953 and in the United States Senate from November 10, 1953 until December 2, 1954. Cleveland Burke Lakefront Airport is named after him.

==Early life and education==
Burke was born in Cleveland, Ohio on October 30, 1898. During World War I, Burke served in the United States Army. In 1920, he graduated from the College of the Holy Cross and in 1923 he graduated from Western Reserve University School of Law.

==Early political career==
In 1930, Burke became as assistant county prosecutor. In 1937, the Ohio Attorney General, Herbert S. Duffy commissioned an investigation of an election fraud case in Lawrence County, Ohio. Burke was appointed as the special counsel to prosecute the case of six people accused of breaking into the election board and tampering with votes for the county commissioner&#x27;s race.
In 1941, Burke became vice mayor of Cleveland. He was also simultaneously the Director of Law for Cleveland, the city&#x27;s chief legal advisor.

==Mayoralty==
With the election of Mayor Frank Lausche as governor of Ohio in 1944, Burke was first in the line of succession to replace him, and therefore became mayor on January 4, 1945. Burke has to stand for re-election in his own right later in 1945, defeating Ray C. Miller with nearly 68% of the vote.

In 1947, Burke faced off against Eliot Ness, the former Treasury agent who pursued Al Capone and later became the Cleveland Director of Public Safety. Despite Ness’ fame, Burke won re-election in a second landslide with more than 66% of the vote and a majority of more than 80,000 votes. Burke went on to win two more times, in 1949 and 1951.

In 1947, the United States Army Corps of Engineers completed a retaining wall and landfill, the city completed work on a 3,600-foot dirt runway and opened its new downtown airport to air traffic. Burke was credited with improvements at the site over the years and, in 1960, Municipal Airport was renamed Burke Lakefront for the former mayor.

In 1953, Burke served as the president of the United States Conference of Mayors.

==United States Senate==
On October 12, 1953, Governor Frank Lausche appointed Burke to succeed Robert A. Taft, who died of cancer on July 31, 1953, in the United States Senate. Burke took Taft&#x27;s seat on November 10, after his term as mayor ended. Burke ran against George H. Bender in the 1954 special election to serve out the remainder of Taft&#x27;s term. Burke was defeated by only 7,070 votes and demanded a recount, which narrowed Bender&#x27;s margin, but did not overturn the results. After his defeat, Burke resumed the practice of law forming the influential Cleveland law firm of Burke, Haber and Berick (now McDonald Hopkins Burke and Haber).

==Personal life==
Burke was married to Josephine (Lyon) Burke and had two daughters. He died of undisclosed causes on December 5, 1971, at St. Vincent Charity Medical Center in Cleveland, where he&#x27;d been admitted the day before. He was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Cleveland.

<doc id="711157" wikidata="Q1643366" url="?curid=711157" title="Extensive farming">
<text>Extensive farming or extensive agriculture (as opposed to intensive farming) is an agricultural production system that uses small inputs of labour, fertilizers, and capital, relative to the land area being farmed.

==Systems==
Extensive farming most commonly means raising sheep and cattle in areas with low agricultural productivity, but includes large-scale growing of wheat, barley, cooking oils and other grain crops in areas like the Murray-Darling Basin in Australia. Here, owing to the extreme age and poverty of the soils, yields per hectare are very low, but the flat terrain and very large farm sizes mean yields per unit of labour are high. Nomadic herding is an extreme example of extensive farming, where herders move their animals to use feed from occasional rainfalls.

==Geography==
Extensive farming is found in the mid-latitude sections of most continents, as well as in desert regions where water for cropping is not available. The nature of extensive farming means it requires less rainfall than intensive farming. The farm is usually large in comparison with the numbers working and money spent on it. In 1957, most parts of Western Australia had pastures so poor that only one sheep to the square mile could be supported.

Just as the demand has led to the basic division of cropping and pastoral activities, these areas can also be subdivided depending on the region&#x27;s rainfall, vegetation type and agricultural activity within the area and the many other parentheses related to this data.

==Advantages==

Extensive farming has a number of advantages over intensive farming:

# Less labour per unit areas is required to farm large areas, especially since expensive alterations to land (like terracing) are completely absent.
# Mechanisation can be used more effectively over large, flat areas.
# Greater efficiency of labour means generally lower product prices.
# Animal welfare is generally improved because animals are not kept in stifling conditions.
# Lower requirements of inputs such as fertilizers.
# If animals are grazed on grassland native to the locality, there is less likely to be problems with exotic species.
# The meat of the livestock will taste better and appeal to customers.
# Local environment and soil are not damaged by overuse of chemicals.
# The ecological impact is lower.
# Animals bred in larger areas develop more efficiently.

==Disadvantages==
Extensive farming can have the following problems:

# Yields tend to be much lower than with intensive farming in the short term.
# Large land requirements limit the habitat of wild species (in some cases, even very low stocking rates can be dangerous), as is the case with intensive farming.
# Less profitable then intensive farming per unit of area.

Extensive farming was once thought to produce more methane and nitrous oxide per kg of milk than intensive farming. 
One study estimated that the carbon &quot;footprint&quot; per billion kg (2.2 billion lb.) of milk produced in 2007 was 37 percent that of equivalent milk production in 1944. However, a more recent study by Centre de coopération internationale en recherche agronomique pour le développement found that extensive livestock systems impact the environment less than intensive systems.

<text>Naomi ( , ; ) is Ruth&#x27;s mother-in-law in the Hebrew Bible in the Book of Ruth. The etymology of her name is not certain, but it is possible that it means &quot;good, pleasant, lovely, winsome.&quot;

==Biblical narrative==
Naomi is married to a man named Elimelech. A famine causes them to move with their two sons, from their home in Judea to Moab. While there Elimelech dies, as well as his sons who had gotten married in the meantime. Near destitute, Naomi returns to Bethlehem with one daughter-in-law, Ruth, whom she could not dissuade from accompanying her. Her other daughter-in-law, Orpah, remains in Moab.

When Naomi returns, she tells the Bethlehemites, &quot;Do not call me Naomi, call me &quot;Mara&quot; (מרא), for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me&quot;. Barry Webb points out that there is not only an objective element in her life being bitter through bereavement, dislocation, and poverty, but also a subjective element—the bitterness she feels. He further argues that in Chapter1 of the Book of Ruth, Naomi&#x27;s &quot;perception of her condition&quot; is &quot;distorted by self-absorption,&quot; but that Ruth plays &quot;a key role in her rehabilitation.&quot; Abraham Kuyper, on the other hand, asserts that &quot;Naomi has such innate nobility of character that she immediately elicits from us our most sincere sympathy.&quot; The Book of Ruth depicts the struggles of Naomi and Ruth for survival in a patriarchal environment.

The arrival of Naomi and Ruth in Bethlehem coincides with the barley harvest. Naomi gives Ruth permission to glean those fields where she is allowed. Ruth is working in the field of Boaz, when a servant identifies her to him as Naomi&#x27;s daughter-in-law. It happens that Boaz is a kinsman of Naomi&#x27;s late husband. He tells her to work with female servants, warns the young men not to bother her, and at mealtime invites her to share his food.

When Naomi learns that Ruth has the attention and kindness of Boaz, she counsels Ruth to approach him directly: &quot;...[P]ut on your best attire and go down to the threshing floor. Do not make yourself known to the man before he has finished eating and drinking. But when he lies down, take note of the place where he does so. Then go, uncover a place at his feet, and lie down. He will tell you what to do.&quot; ()

Webb points out Naomi&#x27;s &quot;feminine scheming&quot; in forcing Boaz&#x27;s hand. Yitzhak Berger suggests that Naomi&#x27;s plan was that Ruth seduce Boaz, just as Tamar and the daughters of Lot all seduced &quot;an older family member in order to become the mother of his offspring.&quot; At the crucial moment, however, &quot;Ruth abandons the attempt at seduction and instead requests a permanent, &quot;legal&quot; union with Boaz.&quot;

Ruth marries Boaz, and they have a son, for whom Naomi cares, and so the women of the town say: &quot;Naomi has a son&quot; (Ruth 4:17). In this way, the book can be seen to be Naomi&#x27;s story: Gregory Goswell argues that Naomi is the &quot;central&quot; character of the book, whereas Ruth is the &quot;main&quot; character. The son in question was Obed, who was the father of Jesse and thus later the grandfather of David.

<text>The dusky moorhen (Gallinula tenebrosa) is a bird species in the rail family and is one of the eight extant species in the moorhen genus. It occurs in India, Australia, New Guinea, Borneo and Indonesia. It is often confused with the purple swamphen and the Eurasian coot due to similar appearance and overlapping distributions. They often live alongside birds in the same genus, such as the Tasmanian nativehen and the common moorhen.

==Taxonomy==
John Gould described the dusky moorhen in 1846 from a skin collected along the Murray River in South Australia. Its species name is derived from the Latin &quot;tenebrosa&quot; &quot;dark&quot;. Charles Lucien Bonaparte described &quot;Gallinula haematopus&quot; in 1856, but this is now a &quot;nomen nudum&quot;. Gregory Mathews described two subspecies that have been synonymized—&quot;magnirostris&quot; from Western Australia and &quot;subfrontata&quot; from New South Wales.

Three subspecies are recognised: subspecies &quot;frontata&quot; from southeastern Borneo, the Sunda Islands, Timor and western New Guinea, subspecies &quot;neumannii&quot; from northern New Guinea, and the nominate subspecies from Australia.

Common names include dusky moorhen, black gallinule, black moorhen and waterhen.

==Description==
The dusky moorhen is a medium-sized bird, slightly smaller than the purple swamphen. The New Guinea birds are smaller, at in length, than the Australian race . Adult males generally weigh on average around 570 grams and adult females 493 grams. The adult dusky moorhen is mainly dark grey-black, with a browner tinge to the upper parts. It has a red frontal shield and yellow-tipped red bill like its Eurasian relative, but lacks the white flank line shown by common moorhen, and has orange-yellow rather than yellow legs. The Australian subspecies is larger and pager than both other subspecies.

During autumn and winter, the colour of the frontal shield grows duller in females and young males. During the warmer months, in the breeding season, the shield grows brighter again in both sexes.

=== Diet ===
The dusky moorhen feeds both on land and in water. Its diet consists of seeds, the tips of shrubs and grasses, algae, fruits, molluscs, and other invertebrates. It will also consume carrion, bread and droppings from birds including gulls and ducks. The chicks are fed mostly on annelid worms and molluscs, with plant matter gradually being given in increasing proportions by the parents as the young mature.

===Voice===
The territorial call is a loud &quot;kurk&quot; or &quot;krik&quot;, which may be repeated or run together, sounding like &quot;kurruk-uk&quot;. This call is taken up by birds in surrounding territories and can be heard from over two kilometres away. The birds also make a series of short, sharp squawks and squeaks as alarm calls. Swimming and preening birds may make a series of short, stacatto, widely spaced noises.

Both sexes make a soft mewing noise, or a soft &quot;kook&quot; noise before and during courtship. Adults may make a quiet hissing noise when their eggs are disturbed. Chicks under the age of three months make a repeated shrill piping noise when begging, when an adult approaches with food, and when they are separated from adults. Adults also make short clicking noises when separated from chicks, and the young give a series of descending whistles in response.

==Distribution and habitat==
It occurs in India, Australia, New Guinea, Borneo and Indonesia. Some vagrant, non-breeding birds may be found in New Zealand as well. In Australia, they are found all across the eastern states of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland as far north as Cooktown, as well as the eastern part South Australia and the south-western tip of Western Australia. It is also found in parts of Tasmania and South Australia, but are uncommon. Included in their natural distribution range are wildlife parks such as Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary and the Brisbane Botanic Gardens.

The dusky moorhen is found in wetland habitats, with a preference for freshwater marshes and swamps, and are rarely found far from these areas except when foraging in nearby vegetation. They are also found in urban parks such as Gold Coast Regional Botanic Gardens and often in dams and river banks. They require open water, usually with some cover such as grass, reeds, and other vegetation. In south-east Queensland, they are more likely to be found in areas with taller vegetation, more attached aquatic vegetation, and a larger number of purple swamphens, indicating that the availability of food and other resources affects their numbers and distribution in wetlands. They usually live in low-lying areas, although a pair have been found as high up as 1,580 metres in New Guinea, likely having been separated from their flock.

The birds do not often migrate long distances, and may remain in the same location for eight years or more. They may move to different locations within their range when resources become scarce. Young birds leave their place of birth in autumn and spring, and may be found in locations not normally frequented by adult birds.

==Behaviour==
Breeding season is from August to January in the south of Australia, with generally one brood, and January to June in the north, often brooding twice. This species builds a bulky nest of reeds or grasses at the water&#x27;s edge or a few centimetres above the water, often at the base of a &quot;Melaleuca&quot; and lays a clutch of 5–11 matte whitish eggs that are covered with red-brown dots and splotches. Tapered oval in shape, they measure 53 mm long by 36 mm wide each and have more prominent markings at the larger end. It is territorial when breeding, but otherwise gregarious. The dusky moorhen may nest alongside the purple swamphen.

Dusky moorhens are diurnal, and roost at nighttime alone, in breeding groups, or in non-breeding flocks. They roost on platforms constructed in reeds set above the water, on branches over the water, and more rarely on the ground in the reeds. During the day they rest at these places, and may also sit on floating vegetation, rocks, logs, and on the banks. In hot weather they may sit high up in trees.

The moorhens frequently flick their conspicuous white and black tail. This may be a signal of alertness or of social status, depending on the context.

<doc id="711186" wikidata="Q4921439" url="?curid=711186" title="Black Path Game">
<text>The Black Path Game (also known by various other names, such as Brick) is a two-player board game described and analysed in &quot;Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays&quot;. It was invented by Larry Black in 1960.

It has also been reported that a game known as &quot;Black&quot; or &quot;Black&#x27;s Game&quot; was invented in 1960 by William L. Black. This &quot;William L. Black&quot; (possibly known as &quot;Larry&quot;) was at that time an undergraduate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, investigating &quot;Hex&quot; and &quot;Bridg-It&quot;, two games based on the challenge to create a connected &quot;chain&quot; of counters that link opposite sides of a game board. The creative outcome of Black&#x27;s research was a new topological game that his friends (perhaps unimaginatively) called &quot;Black&quot;. The game was introduced to the public by Martin Gardner in his October 1963 &quot;Mathematical Games column&quot; in &quot;Scientific American&quot;.

==Rules==
The Black Path Game is played on a board ruled into squares. One edge on the boundary of the board is designated to be the start of the path. After the first move, the players extend the path away from the starting edge by alternately filling the adjacent square at the end of the current path with one of three configurations shown below.

Any square that is not empty is filled with one of the following configurations that contains two paths linking two sides:

These tiles are the three ways to join the sides of the square in pairs. The first two are
the tiles of the Truchet tiling.

The path may return to a previously filled square and follow the yet-unused segment on that square. The player who first causes the path to run back into the edge of the board loses the game.

==Strategy==
As outlined in the example games provided, the player who routes the path into a corner of the board will win the game, as the other player will have no choice but to run the path into the edge of the board.

For a rectangular board with an even number of squares, the first player has a winning strategy. This occurs when at least one side-length is even. Imagine the board covered with rectangular (2×1 unit-size) dominoes. If the first player always plays so the end of the path falls on the middle of one of the dominoes, that player will win. This strategy was discovered by Black&#x27;s friend Elwyn R. Berlekamp, who subsequently described it in his book.



For a rectangular board with an odd total number of squares, i.e., when both sides of the board are odd, the second player can instead win by using a similar domino tiling strategy occupying every square except the one containing the first player&#x27;s first move.

===Logic===
The domino tiling strategy works by making the losing player end the path on the edge of a new domino; by continuing the path on the new domino, the winning player will eventually force the losing player to the edge or a corner.

The second player can win on a board with an even number of square cells; first consider the board completely covered with 2×1 dominoes except for the upper left and lower right corners. If Player 2 forces Player 1 to move in [B2], the second cell of the main diagonal, regardless of Player 1&#x27;s move in [B2], the unused path in [B2] will connect two squares which can be regarded as the two squares of a &quot;split domino&quot; that Player 2 can use, and the remaining tiles (save the lower-right corner) can be covered in dominoes.

Refer to the three examples below, illustrating the &quot;split domino&quot; that results from the third move:
# [A1]-T3
# [A2]-T2




===Examples===

Consider the example game shown at right on a 4×4 grid, where the moves have been:

# [A1]-T2
# [B1]-T2
# [B2]-T3
# [B3]-T2
# [C3]-T1
# [C2]-T2
# [A2]-T1
# [A3]-T2
According to the rules, the next move by Player 1 (odd-numbered turns) must be in space [B4] to continue the path. If Player 1 makes the move [B4]-T3 that will result in an instant loss, since this tile will link the path to the bottom edge. Playing [B4]-T1 will result in a win, as Player 2&#x27;s following move is placed in the corner [A4] and Player 3 will lose regardless of the piece played. Playing [B4]-T2 results in an eventual loss for Player 1; comparison to the 4×4 domino-tiled blank board shows that Player 1 making the move [B4]-T1 puts the path into the middle of the domino, while [B4]-T2 puts the path onto the edge of the domino, and Player 2 can maneuver Player 1 into making the last move.
Gardner describes a second example game, where the moves have been:

# [A1]-T3
# [A2]-T2
# [B2]-T3
# [C2]-T1
# [C1]-T2
# [B1]-T1
# [B3]-T2
# [C3]-T1
# [D2]-T1
In this second example, Player 1 has maneuvered the path into the corner space [D1], which results in a win regardless of the move made by Player 2. After the third move (by Player 2) in [B2]-T3, the split domino exists in cells [B1] and [B3]. However, the fifth move by Player 2 [C1]-T2 brought the path to the edge of the split domino, which Player 1 took advantage of with the sixth move [B1]-T1, playing to the middle of the split domino.

<doc id="711201" wikidata="Q17084553" url="?curid=711201" title="Snake oil (cryptography)">
<text>In cryptography, snake oil is any cryptographic method or product considered to be bogus or fraudulent. The name derives from snake oil, one type of patent medicine widely available in 19th century United States.

Distinguishing secure cryptography from insecure cryptography can be difficult from the viewpoint of a user. Many cryptographers, such as Bruce Schneier and Phil Zimmermann, undertake to educate the public in how secure cryptography is done, as well as highlighting the misleading marketing of some cryptographic products.

The &quot;Snake Oil FAQ&quot; describes itself as &quot;a compilation of common habits of snake oil vendors. It cannot be the sole method of rating a security product, since there can be exceptions to most of these rules. [...] But if you&#x27;re looking at something that exhibits several warning signs, you&#x27;re probably dealing with snake oil.&quot;

== Some examples of snake oil cryptography techniques ==
This is not an exhaustive list of snake oil signs. A more thorough list is given in the references.

;Secret system: Some encryption systems will claim to rely on a secret algorithm, technique, or device; this is categorized as security through obscurity. Criticisms of this are twofold. First, a 19th-century rule known as Kerckhoffs&#x27;s principle, later formulated as Shannon&#x27;s maxim, teaches that &quot;the enemy knows the system&quot; and the secrecy of a cryptosystem algorithm does not provide any advantage. Second, secret methods are not open to public peer review and cryptanalysis, so potential mistakes and insecurities can go unnoticed.
;Technobabble: Snake oil salespeople may use &quot;technobabble&quot; to sell their product since cryptography is a complicated subject.
;&quot;Unbreakable&quot;:Claims of a system or cryptographic method being &quot;unbreakable&quot; are always false (or true under some limited set of conditions), and are generally considered a sure sign of snake oil.
;&quot;Military grade&quot;: There is no accepted standard or criterion for &quot;military grade&quot; ciphers.
;One-time pads: One-time pads are a popular cryptographic method to invoke in advertising, because it is well known that one-time pads, when implemented correctly, are genuinely unbreakable. The problem comes in implementing one-time pads, which is rarely done correctly. Cryptographic systems that claim to be based on one-time pads are considered suspect, particularly if they do not describe how the one-time pad is implemented, or they describe a flawed implementation.
;Unsubstantiated &quot;bit&quot; claims: Cryptographic products are often accompanied with claims of using a high number of bits for encryption, apparently referring to the key length used. However key lengths are not directly comparable between symmetric and asymmetric systems. Furthermore, the details of implementation can render the system vulnerable. For example, in 2008 it was revealed that a number of hard drives sold with built-in &quot;128-bit AES encryption&quot; were actually using a simple and easily defeated &quot;XOR&quot; scheme. AES was only used to store the key, which was easy to recover without breaking AES.

<doc id="711214" wikidata="Q1018180" url="?curid=711214" title="Gharm">
<text>Gharm is a city and jamoat in the Rasht Valley area of central Tajikistan. The population of the town is 9,800 (January 2020 estimate).

From the 1920s until 1955, there was a Gharm Oblast in Tajikistan, which included the territory of the current Gharm Valley. Gharm is also the former name of the Rasht District in central Tajikistan.

==History==
During the 1920s Gharm was a hotbed for the Basmachi, the anti-Soviet resistance in Central Asia. In 1929 Basmachi commander Faizal Maksum crossed from Afghanistan into Tajikistan and briefly captured Gharm, only to later be expelled by Soviet forces.

During the Civil War in Tajikistan from 1992 to 1997, Gharm was a hotbed for the opposition force, and the town was controlled by the opposition during the later part of the civil war in Tajikistan. In October 2010, the Tajik Interior Ministry asserted it had killed three militants on the outskirts of Gharm amid an alleged rise in Islamic militancy in the region.

<doc id="711216" wikidata="Q8761" url="?curid=711216" title="2000 Venezuelan general election">
<text>General elections were held in Venezuela on 30 July 2000, the first under the country&#x27;s newly adopted 1999 constitution. Incumbent President Hugo Chávez ran for election for a full six-year term under the new constitution. He was challenged by another leftist and former ally, Zulia Governor Francisco Arias Cárdenas. Chávez won the election with almost 60% of the popular vote, increasing his vote share over the previous elections and managing to carry a larger number of states. Arias Cárdenas only managed to narrowly carry his home state of Zulia.

==Background==
The elections were for all popularly elected positions at different levels of government, which numbered more than six thousand. Venezuela was going through economic problems: although the price of oil had tripled since Chávez had become president, the economy had shrunk by 7%, unemployment had increased and foreign investors had moved away from the country. However, in spite of these problems and with the traditional political parties weakened, Chavez&#x27;s reelection was imminent.

The elections were originally scheduled for 28 May, but the directors of the National Electoral Council (CNE), appointed by the Chavista majority in the Constituent Assembly, proved to be inefficient and only two days before the elections were to be held, the Supreme Court of Justice suspended the vote as the Electoral Council was not ready yet. Arias Cárdenas called his supporters to gather in front of the CNE to protest, but they were repelled by a group of Chavistas.

==Presidential candidates==
Only two politicians, Antonio Ledezma and Claudio Fermín, both former members of Democratic Action and former mayors of the Libertador Municipality of Caracas, made public their intentions to run against Chávez, both independently. Unexpectedly, in mid-February 2000, Chávez allies Francisco Arias Cárdenas, Jesús Urdaneta and Joel Acosta Chirinos; made a public statement giving Chávez an ultimatum to imprison some members of his government, claiming they had irrefutable evidence proving their corruption, including the president of the legislative power, Luis Miquilena, and foreign affairs minister José Vicente Rangel. Chávez responded by criticizing his former colleagues, whom he reproached for &quot;not having washed the rags at home&quot;.

On 15 March Arias Cárdenas, supported by Urdaneta and Acosta Chirinos, registered his candidacy for the presidential election. Upon learning of this, Ledezma withdrew his but Fermin did not. Miquilena&#x27;s response was to qualify as &quot;trash&quot; those who abandoned Chávez to support Arias Cárdenas. The new opposition leader received support from La Causa R and a handful of small leftist parties, although not from Democratic Action and Copei. Even though some analysts considered Arias Cardenas more pragmatic than Chávez, others such as Eleazar Díaz Rangel declared that they were basically the same.

==Electoral system==
Representatives in the National Assembly were elected under a mixed member proportional representation, with 60% elected from single seat districts and the remainder by closed party lists.

<doc id="711223" wikidata="Q1018025" url="?curid=711223" title="Vahdat">
<text>Vahdat () is a city in western Tajikistan, on the bank of the Kofarnihon River, 21 km east of Dushanbe. It was previously called Yangi-Bozor (1927–1936), Orjonikidzeobod (1936–1993, after Grigoriy Ordzhonikidze) and Kofarnihon (1993–2006). Its population is estimated at 43,200 for the city proper and 342,700 for the city with the outlying communities (2020). Vahdat was the focus on international attention in 2019 when a riot occurred in the city&#x27;s prison, believed to be instigated by members of Islamic State, which led to the deaths of three guards and 29 inmates.

== Geography ==
The city is located in the upper basin of the river Kofarnihon, and is near the Gissar Range (southern slopes) and the Karategin Range (northern slopes), to the west, the city is on the edge of the Gissar Valley.

==Subdivisions==
Before ca. 2018, Vahdat was the seat of Vahdat District, which covered the rural part of the present city of Vahdat. The city of Hisor covers Hisor proper, the town Nu&#x27;mon Roziq and ten jamoats. These are as follows:

== Demographics ==
The population is composed primarily of Tajiks and Uzbeks, with small numbers of Russians and Tatars. Numbers of Afghan refugees have also made Vahdat home.

== Economy ==
The city&#x27;s economy is mainly shaped by the surrounding district&#x27;s agricultural activities: cotton, cattle, grains and vegetable production, and viticulture, with cotton-ginning being the city&#x27;s dominant industrial activity.

== Transportation ==
There are road and rail connections between Vahdat and Dushanbe. Vahdat&#x27;s railway station was built in 1930. Highway connections are possible to Jirgatol, Khorog, Kulob, Nurak and Yovon.

== Education ==
The Vahdat Statistical College specializes in courses on finance, accounting and economics.

== Infrastructure ==
Vahdat is the location of a prison which included those convicted of terrorist crimes, mainly associated with membership in Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) and the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan (IRPT). In 2019, a prison riot saw three guards and 29 inmates killed, 24 of whom were said to be Islamic militants. One of those killed was Behruz Gulmurod, a son of Gulmurod Halimov, previously a commander of Tajik Interior Ministry special forces who joined ISIS/ISIL in 2015.

<doc id="711225" wikidata="Q2229305" url="?curid=711225" title="Wax play">
<text>Wax play is a form of temperature play practiced in a BDSM context, in which wax from a candle is dripped onto a person&#x27;s naked skin, in order to introduce a slight burning sensation to the skin.
This is considered a moderately advanced form of play. If done wrong, wax play can cause burns severe enough to require medical attention.

== Common candle types ==
* Soy candles which commonly melt at around 46-57 °C.
* Paraffin candles which typically melt at around 47-65 °C.
* Beeswax candles which commonly melt at around 62-65 °C (unsafe for wax play).
* Microcrystalline wax which commonly melts at around 63-93 °C (unsafe for wax play).
* Stearin which commonly melts at around 80 °C (unsafe for wax play).

Candle additives such as dye, oils, and scents may increase the melting point.

The melting point of wax can be lowered by adding mineral oil.

== Safety ==
Different types of candles produce different temperatures of wax. They can range from warm and soothing to dangerously hot wax. There is significant difference between individuals&#x27; tolerance for heat, which can vary depending on exactly where the wax is applied.

Wax can splatter into the eyes, which may be harmful. Wax that is too hot can cause serious burns. Wax may be difficult to remove, particularly from areas with hair. A flea comb or a sharp knife may be necessary for wax removal; use of a knife for this purpose requires special skills, though a credit card can work as well. Applying mineral oil or lotion before play can make wax removal easier.

Wax may pool and concentrate heat. Temperatures listed above only apply when wax is in equilibrium. Wax heated in any sort of pot must be stirred vigorously or there can be dangerous temperature variations. Some people may be allergic to perfumes and dyes. Whatever is above a burning candle can get very hot, even at distances that may be surprising. Candles may break and set fire to objects underneath or nearby. Wax is difficult to wash out of clothes and bed linens. People with certain diseases, skin conditions, or taking certain medications may require additional precautions. The page on waxing for hair removal has additional safety considerations.

== In Popular Culture ==

* Body of Evidence (1993) - Madonna&#x27;s character binds her lover&#x27;s arms together with his belt, then while he is helpless she teases and denies him sexual satisfaction, demonstrating his subjugation to her by pouring candle wax onto his penis before she has sex with him. 
* I Like to Play Games (1995) - Another film in which a sexually domineering female character is aroused by tying up her partner and pouring hot wax onto his body.

<text>Regional geography is one of the major traditions of geography. It focuses on the interaction of different cultural and natural geofactors in a specific land or landscape, while its counterpart, systematic geography, concentrates on a specific geofactor at the global level.

== Basics ==
Attention is paid to unique characteristics of a particular region such as natural elements, human elements, and regionalization which covers the techniques of delineating space into regions. Rooted in the tradition of the German-speaking countries, the two pillars of regional geography are the idiographic study of &quot;Länder&quot; or spatial individuals (specific places, countries, continents) and the typological study of &quot;Landschaften&quot; or spatial types (landscapes such as coastal regions, mountain regions, border regions, etc.).

== Approach ==

Regional geography is also a certain approach to geographical study, comparable to quantitative geography or critical geography. This approach prevailed during the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, a period when then regional geography paradigm was central within the geographical sciences. It was later criticised for its descriptiveness and the lack of theory. Strong criticism was leveled against it in particular during the 1950s and the quantitative revolution. Main critics were G. H. T. Kimble and Fred K. Schaefer. 

The regional geography paradigm has influenced many other geographical sciences, including economic geography and geomorphology. Regional geography is still taught in some universities as a study of the major regions of the world. In the Western Hemisphere, these may be cultural regions such as Northern and Latin America, or their corresponding geographic regions or continents, namely North and South America, whose &quot;boundaries&quot; differ significantly from the cultural regions. In the Eastern Hemisphere, Europe and Asia may be considered cultural regions or as continents depending on the criteria used to differentiate between them and determine their shared boundaries. These discrepancies arise from the aforementioned lack of a unifying theory behind the definitions and delineations of these continents and regions. 

In addition, the notion of a city-region approach to the study of geography, underlining urban-rural interactions, gained credence since the mid-1980s. Some geographers have also attempted to reintroduce a certain amount of regionalism since the 1980s. This involves a complex definition of regions and their interactions with other scales.

Regional geography was once used as a basis for the geomorphological works such as those of David Linton and Henri Baulig. Yet, according to Karna Lidmar-Bergström regional geography is since the 1990s not longer accepted by mainstream scholarship as a basis for geomorphological studies.

== Notable figures ==
Notable figures in regional geography were Alfred Hettner in Germany, with his concept of chorology; Paul Vidal de la Blache in France, with the possibilism approach (possibilism being a softer notion than environmental determinism); and, in the United States, Richard Hartshorne with his concept of areal differentiation. The school of Carl O. Sauer, strongly influenced by Alfred Hettner and Paul Vidal de la Blache, is also seen as regional geography in its broadest sense.

<doc id="711231" wikidata="Q979965" url="?curid=711231" title="Marc-André Bergeron">
<text>Joseph Marc-André Bergeron (born October 13, 1980) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman who played ten seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) before spending the later years of his career with the ZSC Lions of the National League (NL). Known as a power play specialist, more than half of Bergeron&#x27;s career goals and points came on the man advantage.

==Playing career==
Bergeron was signed as a free agent by the Edmonton Oilers in 2001. A swift defenceman with a penchant for end-to-end rushes, he reminded some of former Oiler great Paul Coffey. Bergeron&#x27;s popularity with Edmonton fans was cemented during the 2003 playoffs when he sent Dallas Stars&#x27; Brenden Morrow head-over-heels with an open-ice hip check. Bergeron is well known more for his impressive slapshot than his defensive abilities. At the Edmonton Oilers skills competition, held November 26, 2006, he recorded his second straight victory in the hardest shot competition with a puck speed of 103.5 mph (approximately 165 km/h).

While still with the Oilers, near the end of game one of the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals, Bergeron tried to steer Carolina Hurricanes forward Andrew Ladd wide of the net. However, the two of them piled into Oilers goaltender Dwayne Roloson, causing Roloson to be injured for the remainder of the Finals. The Oilers managed to re-group without Roloson but ultimately fell to the Hurricanes in game seven of the series.
After parting ways with the Oilers, Bergeron went on to play with the New York Islanders, Anaheim Ducks, and Minnesota Wild. On October 6, 2009, after star defenceman Andrei Markov was injured, Bergeron signed a 1-year contract with the Montreal Canadiens. Bergeron proved to be a valuable component to the Canadiens, playing forward on the fourth line as well as defence on power plays. He did, however, suffer a long scoring slump between December 31, 2009, until March 31, 2010. When Bergeron became a free agent on July 1, the Canadiens did not re-sign him.

He was signed by the Tampa Bay Lightning as a free agent on January 4, 2011 and assigned to the Norfolk Admirals of the AHL where he recorded two goals and eight points in 13 games. Bergeron was recalled to the Lightning on February 5 and spent the remainder of the season in Tampa Bay, and appeared in 23 games with the Lightning, recording two goals and eight points, including one game-winning goal. He recorded two assists in his Lightning debut on February 6 against the St. Louis Blues and became the third player in franchise history to score his first Lightning goal in overtime on February 12 versus Carolina. Bergeron became a fan-favourite and helped the team reach the Eastern Conference Finals, against the Boston Bruins. On June 28, Bergeron was re-signed to a two-year contract worth $2,000,000.

During the lockout shortened 2012–13 season, Bergeron was traded by the Lightning to the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for Adam Hall and a seventh-round draft pick on April 2, 2013.

On July 19, Bergeron left the NHL as a free agent and signed to a three-year contract with the ZSC Lions of the National League (NL). He won the Swiss championship in 2014 and the Swiss Cup in 2016.

After the completion of his three-year deal with the Lions in Switzerland, Bergeron returned to North America as a free agent. Opting to pursue another NHL opportunity, Bergeron agreed to a professional try-out contract to attend the Columbus Blue Jackets training camp on September 6, 2016. He later signed a PTO contract with the Jackets&#x27; AHL affiliate, Cleveland Monsters. Producing 9 points in his first 13 games with the Monsters, Bergeron secured a two-way NHL contract with the Blue Jackets for the remainder of the season on February 28, 2017.

At the conclusion of his season with the Cleveland Monsters, Bergeron ended his professional playing career in the off-season, accepting a role as a director of player development with former junior club, the Shawinigan Cataractes of the QMJHL.

In 2020, Bergeron became the vice-president and general manager of the Trois-Rivières Lions in the ECHL. On June 22, 2023, Bergeron was fired from his positions.

==NASCAR team ownership==
In 2009, Bergeron formed a partnership with NASCAR driver Louis-Philippe Dumoulin to field a car in the NASCAR Pinty&#x27;s Series for Dumoulin. Dumoulin, who won the 2014, 2018, and 2021 championships, drives the No. 47 as it was Bergeron&#x27;s number during his playing career.

<text>The Leader of His Majesty&#x27;s Most Loyal Opposition, more commonly referred to as the Leader of the Opposition, is the person who leads the Official Opposition in the United Kingdom. The position is seen as the shadow head of government of the United Kingdom and thus the shadow prime minister of the United Kingdom.

Originally by convention, the Leader of the Opposition is the leader of the largest political party in the House of Commons that is not in government. When a single party wins outright, this is the party leader of the second-largest political party in the House of Commons. The role has since been codified by statute.

The Leader of the Opposition is often viewed as an alternative or shadow prime minister, and is appointed to the Privy Council. They lead an Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet, which scrutinises the actions of the Cabinet and offers alternative policies.

In the nineteenth century, party affiliations were generally less fixed and the leaders in the two Houses were often of equal status. A single and clear Leader of the Opposition was only definitively settled if the opposition leader in the House of Commons or House of Lords was the outgoing prime minister. However, since the Parliament Act 1911, there has been no dispute that the leader in the House of Commons is pre-eminent and has always held the primary title. The Leader of the Opposition is entitled to a salary in addition to their salary as a Member of Parliament. In 2019, this additional entitlement was available up to £65,181.

The role is considered by those who have held it as the worst and most difficult job in politics, with Prime Minister Tony Blair and then-Leader of the Opposition William Hague agreeing that the opposition role was the harder job of the two positions.

The incumbent Leader of the Opposition is Kemi Badenoch, the Leader of the Conservative Party, following the 2024 Conservative Party leadership election.

==Leaders of the opposition from 1807==

The first modern Leader of the Opposition was Charles James Fox, who led the Whigs as such for a generation, except during the Fox–North Coalition in 1783. He finally rejoined the government in the Ministry of All the Talents formed in 1806 and died later that year.
===Early developments 1807–1830===
For there to be a recognised Leader of the Opposition, it is necessary for there to be a sufficiently cohesive opposition to need a formal leader. The emergence of the office thus coincided with the period when wholly united parties (Whig and Tory, governments and oppositions) became the norm. This situation was normalized in the Parliament of 1807–1812 when the members of the Grenvillite and Foxite Whig factions resolved to maintain a joint, dual-house leadership for the whole party.

The Ministry of all the Talents, in which both Whig factions participated fell at the 1807 general election, during which the Whigs had re-adopted traditional factions, forming &quot;an&quot; opposition. The prime minister of the Talents ministry, Lord Grenville had led his eponymous faction from the House of Lords. Meanwhile, the government leader of the House of Commons, Viscount Howick (later known as Earl Grey and the political heir of Charles James Fox who had died in 1806), led his faction, the Foxite whigs, from the House of Commons.

Howick&#x27;s father, the 1st Earl Grey died on 14 November 1807. As such the new Earl Grey vacated his seat in the House of Commons and moved to the House of Lords. This left no obvious Whig leader in the House of Commons.

Grenville&#x27;s article in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; confirms that he was considered the Whig leader in the House of Lords between 1807 and 1817, despite Grey leading the larger faction.

Grenville and Grey, political historian Archibald Foord describe as being &quot;duumvirs of the party from 1807 to 1817&quot; and consulted about what was to be done. Grenville was at first reluctant to name a leader of the opposition in the House of Commons, commenting &quot;... all the elections in the world would not have made Windham or Sheridan leaders of the old Opposition while Fox was alive ...&quot;.

Eventually, they jointly recommended George Ponsonby to the Whig MPs, whom they accepted as the first leader of the opposition in the House of Commons. Ponsonby, an Irish lawyer who was the uncle of Grey&#x27;s wife, had been Lord Chancellor of Ireland during the Ministry of all the Talents and had only just been re-elected to the House of Commons in 1808 when he became leader. Ponsonby proved a weak leader but as he could not be persuaded to resign and the duumvirs did not want to depose him, he remained in place until he died in 1817.

Lord Grenville retired from active politics in 1817, leaving Grey as the leader of the opposition in the House of Lords. Grey was not a former prime minister in 1817, unlike Grenville, so under the convention that developed later in the century he would have been in the theory of equal status to whoever was a leader in the other House. However, there was little doubt that if a Whig ministry was possible, Grey rather than the less distinguished Commons leaders would have been invited to form that government. In this respect Grey&#x27;s position was like that of the Earl of Derby in the Protectionist Conservative opposition of the late 1840s and early 1850s.

Earl Grey witnessed a delay of about a year, until 1818, before a new leader of the opposition in the House of Commons was chosen. This was George Tierney who was reluctant to accept the leadership and had weak support from his party. On 18 May 1819, Tierney moved a motion in the Commons for a committee on the state of the nation. This motion was defeated by 357 to 178, a division involving the largest number of MPs until the debates over the Reform bill in the early 1830s. Foord comments that &quot;this defeat put an effective end to Tierney&#x27;s leadership ... Tierney did not disclaim the leadership till 23 Jan. 1821 ..., but he had ceased to exercise its functions since the great defeat&quot;.

Between 1821 and 1830 the Whig Commons leadership was left vacant. The leadership in the House of Lords was not much more effective: in 1824 Grey retired from active leadership, asking the party to follow the Marquess of Lansdowne &quot;as the person whom his friends were to look upon as their leader&quot;. Lansdowne disclaimed the title of leader, although in practice he performed the function.

Following the retirement of Lord Liverpool from the prime ministership in 1827, the party&#x27;s political situation changed. Neither the Duke of Wellington or Robert Peel agreed to serve under George Canning and they were followed by five other members of the former Cabinet as well as forty junior members of the previous government. The Tory Party was heavily split between the &quot;High Tories&quot; (or &quot;Ultras&quot;, nicknamed after the contemporary party in Restoration France) and the moderates supporting Canning, often called &#x27;Canningites&#x27;. As a result, Canning found it difficult to maintain a government and chose to invite a number of Whigs to join his Cabinet, including Lord Lansdowne. After Canning&#x27;s death, Lord Goderich continued the coalition for a few more months. The principal opposition between April 1827 and January 1828 worked with these brief administrations, although Earl Grey and a section of the Whigs were also in opposition to the coalition government. It was during this period that the term &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Opposition&quot; for the Opposition was coined, by John Cam Hobhouse.

The Duke of Wellington formed a ministry in January 1828 and as a direct effect of adopting in earnest the policy of Catholic Emancipation the opposition became composed of most Whigs with many Canningites and some ultra-Tories. Lord Lansdowne, in the absence of any alternative, remained the leading figure in the Whig opposition.

In 1830 Grey returned to the front rank of politics. On 30 June 1830, he denounced the government in the House of Lords. He rapidly attracted the support of opponents of the ministry. The renewal of organized opposition was also bolstered earlier in the year by the election of a new leader of the opposition in the House of Commons, the heir of Earl Spencer, Viscount Althorp.

In November 1830 Grey was invited to form a government and resumed the formal leadership of the party and as such Wellington and Peel became the leaders of the opposition in the two Houses, from November 1830.

===Leaders of the opposition 1830–1937===

In the period of 1830–1937, the normal expectation was that there would be two leading parties (often with smaller allied groups), of which one would form the government and the other the opposition. These parties were expected to have recognized leaders in the two Houses, so there was normally no problem in identifying who led the opposition in each House.

The constitutional convention developed in the nineteenth century was that if one of the leaders was the last prime minister of the party, then he would be considered the overall leader of his party. If that was not the case then the leaders of both Houses were of equal status. As the monarch retained some discretion as to which leader should be invited to form a ministry, it was not always obvious in advance which one would be called upon to do so.

However, as the leadership of the opposition only existed by custom, the normal expectations and conventions were modified by political realities from time to time.

From 1830 until 1846 the Tory/Conservative Party and the Whig Party (increasingly often described with its Radical and other allies as the Liberal Party) alternated in power and provided clear leaders of the opposition.

In 1846 the Conservative Party split into (Protectionist) Conservative and Peelite (or Liberal Conservative) factions. The Protectionists being the larger group, the recognized leaders of the opposition were drawn from their ranks. In the House of Lords, Lord Stanley (soon becoming Earl of Derby) was the Protectionist leader. He was the only established front-rank political figure in the faction and thus a very strong candidate to form the next Conservative ministry.

The leadership in the House of Commons was more problematic. Lord George Bentinck, the leader of the Protectionist revolt against Sir Robert Peel, initially led the party in the Commons. He resigned in December 1847. The party was then faced with the problem of how to produce a credible leader, who was not Benjamin Disraeli. The first attempt to square the circle was made in February 1848, when the young Marquess of Granby was installed as the leader. He gave up the post in March 1848. The leadership then fell vacant until February 1849.

The next experiment was to entrust the leadership to a triumvirate of Granby, Disraeli, and the elderly John Charles Herries. In practice, Disraeli ignored his co-triumvirs. In 1851 Granby resigned and the party accepted Disraeli as the sole leader. The Protectionists by then were clearly the core of the Conservative Party and Derby was able to form his first government in 1852.

The Liberal Party was formally founded in 1859, replacing the Whig Party as one of the two leading parties. With increasing party discipline it became easier to define the principal opposition party and the leaders of the opposition.

The last overall leader of the opposition to have led it from the House of Lords was the Earl of Rosebery. He resigned as such in November 1896. Lord Rosebery had been Liberal prime minister from 1894 to 1895.
The Parliament Act 1911 removed the legislative veto from the House of Lords to permit the welfare-state forming Liberal legislation to be enacted by the Commons, the People&#x27;s Budget and any future Money Bills without any input from the Lords. This, therefore, entrenched the de facto position that there could only be one true leader of the opposition and in effect clarified in which house that leader would need to sit. From this point, all leaders of the opposition in the House of Commons would thus be overall leaders of the opposition.

In 1915 the Liberal, Conservative and Labour parties formed a coalition. The Irish Parliamentary Party did not join the government but were by and large not in opposition to it. As almost nobody in the Parliament could be said to be in opposition to the coalition, the leadership of the opposition in both Houses fell vacant.

Sir Edward Carson, the leading figure among the Irish Unionist part of the Conservative and Unionist Party, resigned from the coalition ministry on 19 October 1915. He then became the leader of those Unionists who were not members of the government, effectively the leader of the opposition in the Commons.

The party situation changed in December 1916: a leading Liberal, David Lloyd George, formed a coalition with the support of a section of &quot;Coalition Liberal&quot;, Conservative and Labour parties. The Leader of the Liberal Party, H. H. Asquith, and most of his leading colleagues left the government and took up seats on the opposition side of the House of Commons. Asquith was recognized as the leader of the opposition. He retained that post until he was defeated in the 1918 United Kingdom general election. Although Asquith continued to be the leader of the Liberal Party, as he was not a member of the House of Commons he was not eligible to be the leader of the opposition until returned in the 1920 Paisley by-election.

The Parliament elected in December 1918 which sat from 1919 until 1922, represents the most significant deviation from the principle that the leader of the opposition is the leader of the party not in government with the greatest numerical support in the House of Commons. The largest opposition party (disregarding Sinn Féin, whose abstentionist MPs did not take their seats at Westminster), was the Labour Party which had wholly left the Lloyd George coalition and won 57 seats at the general election. Thirty-six Liberals had been elected without coalition support; however, they were mixed in their opposition to Lloyd George. The Labour Party did not have a Leader until 1922. The Parliamentary Labour Party annually elected a chairman, but the party, due to its congressional origins, refused to assert a claim that the chairman was the leader of the opposition. Although the issue of who was entitled to be the leader of the opposition was never formally resolved, in practice the Opposition Liberal leader performed most of the parliamentary functions associated with the office.

The small group of opposition Liberals met in 1919, distanced by his coalition&#x27;s protectionism and nationalization. They resolved that they were the Liberal Parliamentary Party. They elected Sir Donald Maclean as Chairman of the Parliamentary Party. Liberal Party practice at the time, when the overall leader of the party had lost an election to the House of Commons, was for the chairman to function as acting leader in the House. Maclean, therefore, took on the role of leader of the opposition, followed by Asquith, who returned to the House by winning a by-election (1920–22).

From 1922 the Labour Party had a recognized leader so took over all remaining commons opposition roles from the Opposition Liberal Party. Since 1922 the principal Government and Opposition parties have been the Labour Party and the Conservative Party. There were three instances of peers being seriously considered for the prime ministership, during the twentieth century (Lord Curzon of Kedleston in 1923, Lord Halifax in 1940 and Lord Home in 1963), but these were all cases where the Conservative Party was in government and do not affect the list of leaders of the opposition.

In 1931–32 the Leader of the Labour Party was Arthur Henderson. He was the leader of the opposition for a short period in 1931 but was ineligible to continue when he lost his seat in the 1931 general election. George Lansbury was the leader of the opposition before he also became the leader of the Labour Party in 1932.

===Statutory leaders of the opposition from 1937===
Leaders of the opposition in the two Houses of Parliament had been generally recognized and given a special status in Parliament for more than a century before they were mentioned in legislation.

&quot;Erskine May: Parliamentary Practice&quot; confirms that the office of the leader of the opposition was first given statutory recognition in the Ministers of the Crown Act 1937.

* Section 5 states that &quot;There shall be paid to the Leader of the Opposition an annual salary of two thousand pounds&quot;.
* Section 10(1) includes a definition (which codifies the usual situation under the previous custom) &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; means that member of the House of Commons who is for the time being the leader in that House of the party in opposition to His Majesty&#x27;s Government having the greatest numerical strength in that House&quot;.
* The 1937 Act also contains an important provision to decide who is the Leader of the Opposition, if this is in doubt. Under section 10(3) &quot;If any doubt arises as to which is or was at any material time the party in opposition to His Majesty&#x27;s Government having the greatest numerical strength in the House of Commons, or as to who is or was at any material time the leader in that House of such a party the question shall be decided for the purposes of this Act by the Speaker of the House of Commons, and his decision, certified in writing under his hand, shall be final and conclusive&quot;.

Subsequent legislation also gave statutory recognition to the leader of the opposition in the House of Lords.

* Section 2(1) of the Ministerial and other Salaries Act 1975, provides that &quot;In this Act &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; means, in relation to either House of Parliament, that member of that House who is for the time being the Leader in that House of the party in opposition to His Majesty&#x27;s Government having the greatest numerical strength in the House of Commons&quot;.
* Section 2(2) is in exactly the same terms as section 10(3) of the 1937 Act.
* Section 2(3) is a corresponding provision for the Lord Chancellor (since 2005, the Lord Speaker) to decide about the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords.

The legislative provisions confirm that the leader of the opposition is, strictly, a Parliamentary office; so that to be a leader a person must be a member of the House in which he or she leads.

Since 1937 the leader of the opposition has received a state salary in addition to their salary as a Member of Parliament (MP), now equivalent to a Cabinet Minister. The holder also receives a chauffeur-driven car for official business of equivalent cost and specification to the vehicles used by most cabinet ministers.

In 1940 the three largest parties in the House of Commons formed a coalition government to continue to prosecute the Second World War. This coalition continued in office until shortly after the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. As the former leader of the opposition had joined the government the issue arose of who was to hold the office or perform its functions. &quot;Keesing&#x27;s Contemporary Archives 1937–1940&quot; (at paragraph 4069D) reported the situation, based on &quot;Hansard&quot;:
The Prime Minister replying to Mr. Denman in the House of Commons on 21 May, said that in view of the formation of an Administration embracing the three main political parties, H.M. Government was of the opinion that the provision of the Ministers of the Crown Act, 1937, relating to the payment of a salary to the leader of the opposition was in abeyance for the time being, as there was no alternative party capable of forming a Government. He added that he did not consider amending legislation necessary.
The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; reported that the Parliamentary Labour Party met on 22 May 1940 and unanimously elected Dr H.B. Lees-Smith as Chairman of the PLP (an office normally held by the party leader at that time) and as spokesman of the Party from the opposition front bench.

After the death of Lees-Smith, on 18 December 1941, the PLP with Patrick McFadden acting as chairman, held a meeting on 21 January 1942. Frederick Pethick-Lawrence was unanimously elected Chairman of the PLP and the official spokesman of the party in the House of Commons while the party leader was serving in the government. After the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party (Arthur Greenwood) left the government on 22 February 1942 he took over these roles from Pethick-Lawrence until the end of the coalition and the resumption of normal party politics.

==List of leaders of the opposition (1807–1911)==
The table lists the people who were, or who acted as, leaders of the opposition in the two Houses of Parliament since 1807, prior to which the post was held by Charles James Fox for decades.

The leaders of the two Houses were of equal status, before 1911, unless one was the most recent Prime Minister for the party. Such a former prime minister was considered to be the overall leader of the opposition. From 1911 the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons was considered to be the overall Leader of the Opposition. Overall leaders names are bolded. Acting leaders names are in italics unless the acting leader subsequently became a full leader during a continuous period as leader.

Due to the fragmentation of both principal parties in 1827–30, the leaders and principal opposition parties suggested for those years are provisional.

==List of leaders of the opposition (1911–present)==


===Timeline===
== List of leaders of the opposition by total length of tenure ==
This list notes each Leader of the Opposition, from the Parliament Act 1911 granting legislative preeminence to the House of Commons, and the Ministers of the Crown Act 1937 the leader of the second largest faction within it a statutory title and salary, rather than the customary role as HM Official Opposition, in order of term length. This is based on the difference between dates; if counted by number of calendar days all the figures would be one greater.

Of the 37 leaders of the opposition listed, seven served more than 5 years, seven have lost more than one general election, and eight have served less than a year.

<text>Panjakent () or Penjikent () is a city in the Sughd province of Tajikistan on the river Zeravshan, with a population of 52,500 (2020 estimate). It was once an ancient town in Sogdiana. The ruins of the old town are on the outskirts of the modern city. The Sarazm Important Bird Area lies downstream of the city on the tugay-vegetated floodplain of the river.

==History==
Ancient Panjakent was a small but flourishing town of the Sogdians in pre-Islamic Central Asia. It was known as Panchekanth. It means five towns (villages) in Persian. The ethnic and territorial name &quot;Soghd/Soghdian&quot; or Sughd/Sughdian was mentioned in history as early as the Iranian Achaemenid dynasty (6th century BC). The Achaemenids founded several city-states, as well as cities along the ancient Silk Road and in the Zarafshan valley.
The town grew in the 5th century AD and many professionals such as established businessmen and landowners made their livelihoods in Panjakent. In AD 722, Arab Muslims forces besieged and took the town. The last ruler of the town Divashtich fled into upper Zarafshan but he was captured and sentenced to death. For around 50 years, ancient Panjakent was ruled by new administrators but towards the end of the 8th century the town on the upper terraces was depopulated and relocated. Many ancient ruins of the old city, particularly the city architecture and works of art remain today.

Numerous records of a Penjikent rulership, written in Sogdian, were located not far of Penjikent on Mount Mug. Through their reading of these texts, the public of Central Asia in the 8th century will judge on social, economic and political life.

According to Arab geographers, Panjakent in the 10th century had a formal Friday mosque that distinguished the place as a town from a village. It was the easternmost city of Soghd, and became well known for its walnuts.

Russian archaeologist Boris Marshak spent more than fifty years excavating the ruins at Panjakent. He remained there even after Tajik independence as director of the excavation of the Panjakent ruins, during the years of Civil War in Tajikistan from 1992 to 1997. Through close cooperation with the government of Tajikistan, Marshak ensured the protection and continued excavation of the Panjakent ruins.

===Ancient murals and artifacts===

Numerous murals were recovered from the site of Panjikent, and many of them are now on display in the Hermitage Museum and in the National Museum of Antiquities of Tajikistan in Dushanbe. A great variety influences are visible in the paintings, which show details of dress and daily life: Greek decorative styles encounter the Iranian narratives of the Shahnameh and the epic cycle of Rostam, scenes of festivities alternate with depictions of combats, local cults mix with Iranian and Hindu deities. Shaivism was popular in Sogdiana and Eastern Turkestan as found from the wall painting from Penjikent on the river Zervashan. In this depiction, Shiva is portrayed with a sacred halo and a sacred thread (&quot;Yajnopavita&quot;). He is clad in a tigerskin while his attendants are wearing Sogdian dress. There is a depiction of him four-legged seated cross-legged on a cushioned seat supported by two bulls.

The production of paintings started in the 5th century AD and stopped in 722 AD with the invasion of the Abbasid Caliphate, and many works of art were damaged or destroyed at that time.

<doc id="711263" wikidata="Q1949244" url="?curid=711263" title="Mosgiel">
<text>Mosgiel () is an urban satellite of Dunedin in Otago, New Zealand, fifteen kilometres west of the city&#x27;s centre. Since the re-organisation of New Zealand local government in 1989 it has been inside the Dunedin City Council area. Mosgiel has a population of approximately as of . A nickname for Mosgiel is &quot;The pearl of the plain&quot;. Its low-lying nature does pose problems, making it prone to flooding after heavy rains. Mosgiel takes its name from Mossgiel Farm, Ayrshire, the farm of the poet Robert Burns, the uncle of the co-founder in 1848 of the Otago settlement, the Reverend Thomas Burns.

Mosgiel stands at the north-eastern extremity of the Taieri Plain. The Silver Stream, a tributary of the Taieri River, runs through its north end. Between Mosgiel and the centre of Dunedin stand the rugged Three Mile Hill and Scroggs Hill, which form part of the crater-wall of a long-extinct volcano, the crater being the Otago Harbour. To the south of the town lies one of the many peaks that formed part of the volcano: Saddle Hill, a prominent landmark, visible from a considerable distance and notable for its distinctive shape, lies south of State Highway One where Kinmont Park, a new housing subdivision is located at the foot of the hill.

The Dunedin Southern Motorway, upgraded in 2003, links Mosgiel with the centre of Dunedin. State Highway 87 to Kyeburn starts at a junction with State Highway 1 at the southeastern edge of Mosgiel, the first part of the highway being the main street of Mosgiel, Gordon Road.

== Legend and early history==
The site of Mosgiel figures in Māori legend, but surrounding features of the Taieri Plain and adjacent hills have older mythical associations. Of the canoes of South Island migratory legend the fourth and fifth, Tākitimu and Āraiteuru, are mentioned in connection with the area. Maungatua, the large hill to the west of the plain, represents a huge wave which struck the Takitimu, throwing overboard Aonui, who became a pillar on the Tokomairaro Beach. Another account makes Aonui a female survivor of the wreck of the Ārai Te Uru, built by Kahui Tipua, who had arrived earlier but sent this vessel to the Polynesian homeland Hawaiki to get kūmara. On its return the canoe suffered shipwreck at Shag Point in North Otago, but its survivors quested about the land in search of supplies. If they failed to get back before dawn they turned into natural landscape-features, and this fate befell Aonui. These ancient traditions suggest that some of the earliest Polynesian settlers in the south knew the Taieri Plain.

W.R. Kirk repeated the later story of a &quot;taniwha&quot; (water-monster), the &quot;familiar spirit or guardian of Te Rakitaounere (also given as Te Rakitauneke) a famous chief and warrior&quot; who lost his master about the Dunedin hills, slithered down the Silverstream, &#x27;Whaka-ehu&#x27;, and &#x27;lay down and left a hollow Te Konika o te Matamata&#x27; on the site of Mosgiel. The &quot;taniwha&quot; (named &quot;Matamata&quot;) wriggled down the Taieri, making its tortuous course, and when he died became the seaboard hills, including Saddle Hill. This story has associations with Kāti Māmoe, (&#x27;Ngāti Mamoe&#x27; in modern standard Māori) of the late 17th or early 18th century. According to tradition this period also saw the occupation of the &quot;kaik&quot; (unfortified settlement) near modern Henley – called &quot;Tai-ari&quot; like the river – and on the hill above it a pā, or fortified settlement, called &quot;Omoua&quot;. Tukiauau built a pā called Whakaraupuka on the west side of Lake Waihola and his rival, Tuwiriroa, came down from Lake Wakatipu and built one at Taieri Mouth on the coast. Māori soon abandoned Whakaraupuka, but the Taiari settlement at Henley endured into modern times. (Anderson, 1998.)

In February 1770 Captain James Cook described the saddle-shaped hill which became known as Saddle Hill, the landmark east of Mosgiel. The Weller brothers of the Otago whaling station on Otago Harbour (modern Otakou) sent a Mr. Dalziel to inspect the Taieri Plain for a proposed Scottish settlement in 1839, but he gave an unfavourable report. In 1844 Edward Shortland noticed Māori running pigs on the landward slopes of Saddle Hill or &quot;Makamaka&quot; (as he recorded the hill&#x27;s Māori name). Charles Kettle surveyed the plain and coastal hills for the Otago Association in 1846 and 1847. He also climbed the westward hills and saw the raised land beyond, the nearest approach of the Central Otago plateau to the sea, which he correctly identified as potentially fine pastoral country.

Following the arrival of the Association&#x27;s settlers at Dunedin in 1848, a Scots shepherd, Jaffray, brought his wife and dogs along the Māori track from Kaikorai Valley and settled on Saddle Hill in a &quot;whare&quot; (a Māori-style house) in 1849, establishing the first European farmstead in the district. In the same year the Reverend Thomas Burns, spiritual leader of the Association&#x27;s settlement, selected the land which would become Mosgiel.

In the mid-1850s Arthur John Burns, a son of Thomas Burns, settled on some of the land. A large stand of native bush stood nearby. The richness of the land and the proximity of the main south road, more or less following the route of an old Māori track, led to early close rural settlement.

The 1861 Otago gold rush saw the development of a road – leading west to the interior – which intersected the site. Arthur John Burns&#x27;s establishment of the Mosgiel Woollen Company and mill in 1871 brought the settlement of workers in cottages. 1875 saw the north-south road paralleled by a railway, with a branch to the west constructed in 1877. The authorities declared the Mosgiel Town District in 1882 and constituted a Borough Council in 1885. The town grew and became the most substantial in the district. The surrounding plain became a sort of Home County to Dunedin, a place of prosperous farms and of the large houses of successful businessmen with rural tastes. Horse-breeding and racing flourished.

== Mosgiel in the twentieth century ==

From 1900 to 1997, Mosgiel was the site of Holy Cross College, the national Roman Catholic seminary for the training of priests. The seminary was located on extensive grounds which included a farm. The seminary was moved to Auckland in 1997 but many of its buildings remain and are used for Catholic as well as other purposes.

The significance of the area for transport grew in the 20th century when the proximity of the plain&#x27;s flat land to Dunedin saw the establishment of the Taieri Aerodrome, just north of Mosgiel, in the late 1920s and the development of Momona Airport, now Dunedin International Airport, further south on the plain in 1962.

After the Second World War, some expected Mosgiel might industrialise extensively, like the Hutt Valley, but expansion remained limited. The bankruptcy of the woollen mill in 1980 and its eventual closure have not been offset by other industrial developments.

The late 20th century&#x27;s increasingly ageing New Zealand population saw the expansion of housing for the elderly, with several retirement villages and communities located in the vicinity. In recent decades the hills above the plain have seen some division into lifestyle blocks. The 2003 completion of the Fairfield bypass shortened commuting-time via the southern motorway (part of State Highway 1) to the city centre.

Mosgiel&#x27;s economy until years, focused on the manufacture of wool-products and many elderly New Zealanders associate the word &quot;Mosgiel&quot; with the former Mosgiel Woollen Mills. , Mosgiel&#x27;s income comes from many sources, including local shops, cafés and bars. It remains an important service-centre for the surrounding farming community. It also hosts one of New Zealand&#x27;s largest agricultural research institutes, Invermay. Until recently the largest employer was Fisher &amp; Paykel which manufactured DishDrawer dishwasher and ranges at their Mosgiel factory. The closure of this plant was announced in early 2008.

==Demographics==
Mosgiel is described by Statistics New Zealand as a medium urban area, and covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Before the 2023 census, Mosgiel had a smaller boundary, covering . Using that boundary, Mosgiel had a population of 13,635 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 1,377 people (11.2%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 1,986 people (17.0%) since the 2006 census. There were 5,805 households, comprising 6,348 males and 7,290 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.87 males per female, with 2,229 people (16.3%) aged under 15 years, 1,836 (13.5%) aged 15 to 29, 5,568 (40.8%) aged 30 to 64, and 3,999 (29.3%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 93.9% European/Pākehā, 6.8% Māori, 1.4% Pasifika, 2.6% Asian, and 2.0% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 11.7, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 50.1% had no religion, 40.7% were Christian, 0.1% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.4% were Hindu, 0.6% were Muslim, 0.2% were Buddhist and 1.1% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 1,566 (13.7%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 3,123 (27.4%) people had no formal qualifications. 1,545 people (13.5%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 4,764 (41.8%) people were employed full-time, 1,617 (14.2%) were part-time, and 252 (2.2%) were unemployed.

==Points of interest==
R.A. Lawson&#x27;s East Taieri Presbyterian Church (1870) stands near the Mosgiel turnoff to State Highway 1.

The Mosgiel Woollen Mill built in 1871 in Factory Road, was the second woollen mill to open in New Zealand. The mill was integral to the town and a significant employer from when it opened until the end of the 20th century when it closed.

In 1936, while still a schoolboy, the artist Colin McCahon took part in a family outing, driving from the seaboard over the coastal hills. Looking across the Taieri Plain towards Central Otago he had what he described as a &quot;vision&quot;, seeing a pre-Biblical &quot;landscape of splendour order and peace&quot; – which, he said, it became his life&#x27;s work to communicate. The same view, though seen from a greater distance, had inspired Charles Kettle in the 1840s.

In 1953 the young Ralph Hotere, later to become one of New Zealand&#x27;s best-regarded artists, qualified as a pilot on Tiger Moths at the Taieri Aerodrome Training School, Mosgiel.
Mosgiel&#x27;s sign forms an unusual feature. Modelled on the famous Hollywood Sign, the seven letters of the Mosgiel sign perch on a hillside close to State Highway 1. Because of this sign locals sometimes (though not very often) jokingly refer to Mosgiel as &quot;Mollywood&quot;.

The distinctive outline of Saddle Hill forms the eastern border of the greater Mosgiel area.

In years Mosgiel has experienced increased urbanisation and a growth in population. The revival has come about in part due to people moving from Dunedin&#x27;s inner suburbs. Mosgiel has seen the opening or refurbishment of cafés and bars aimed at a younger market, and workers have built stages one and two of a planned larger playground.

In 2010 Mosgiel became home to the first Warehouse Local store, and a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant was planned to go next to New World, however due to strict restrictions that would be imposed on the restaurant the idea has been scrapped.

==Education==
Taieri College is the only state secondary school in Mosgiel. It caters for years 7 to 13 and has a roll of . The school was formed in 2004 as a merge between The Taieri High School and Mosgiel Intermediate. The Taieri High School was called Mosgiel District High School until 1956, and has origins from 1864.

East Taieri School, Elmgrove School and Silverstream School are state contributing primary schools catering for years 1 to 6. They have rolls of , and students, respectively. East Taieri School was founded as a preaching station in 1853 and moved to its current location in 1863.

St Mary&#x27;s School is a state-integrated Catholic full primary school for years 1 to 8 and has a roll of . The school started in 1882 and was run by the Sisters of Mercy from 1889.

Amana Christian School is a private composite school for years 1 to 13 and has a roll of . It opened in 2001.

All these schools are coeducational. Rolls are as of

<doc id="711264" wikidata="Q980115" url="?curid=711264" title="Marc Bergevin">
<text>Marc Bergevin (born August 11, 1965) is a Canadian professional ice hockey executive and former player. He is currently senior advisor to the general manager of the Los Angeles Kings. Bergevin played as a defenceman in the NHL.

==Playing career==
As a youth, Bergevin played in the 1978 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Ville-Émard, which included Mario Lemieux and J. J. Daigneault.

Bergevin was drafted by the NHL&#x27;s Chicago Blackhawks in the 1983 NHL Entry Draft, third round, 59th overall. After a junior career with the Chicoutimi Saguenéens of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL), he made the Black Hawks in 1984 and played with Chicago for the next five seasons before being traded to the New York Islanders. His career with the Islanders was brief, and he spent much of that time with their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate Springfield Indians, whom he helped lead to consecutive Calder Cup championships in 1990 and 1991. In the 1991 season he was traded to the Hartford Whalers and became a fan favorite for his skilled checking. The 1991–92 season was his best, statistically, scoring 7 goals and 17 assists for 24 points.

Bergevin went on to sign with the expansion Tampa Bay Lightning the next season, becoming a leader for the fledgling franchise and continuing to play skillfully enough to be named to the gold medal-winning Canadian national team for the 1994 World Championships. After three years with the Lightning, he played for the Detroit Red Wings, St. Louis Blues, Pittsburgh Penguins and the Vancouver Canucks, and was known for his practical jokes in the locker room.

Bergevin served as an alternate captain during part of his time with the Penguins, Lightning and Blues.

==Retirement==
Bergevin retired after the 2003–04 NHL season, and despite two stints in the minors and serious injuries in his final years, was in the top 100 in NHL history at the time of his retirement in games played in the NHL with 1,191. He finished his career with 36 goals, 145 assists for 181 points and 1,090 penalty minutes.

==Management career==
After his retirement, Bergevin was a professional scout with the Blackhawks&#x27; organization. In 2008, he served as an assistant coach for the Blackhawks after three seasons with their scouting staff. In July 2009, he was appointed the team&#x27;s director of player personnel. While in this position, the Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup in 2010.

On June 15, 2011, Bergevin was promoted to assistant general manager of the Chicago Blackhawks. He replaced Kevin Cheveldayoff, who had left the Blackhawks organization to accept the general manager position with the new Winnipeg Jets team.

On May 2, 2012, Bergevin was named general manager and executive vice president of the Montreal Canadiens. His first additions to the Canadiens included Rick Dudley as assistant general manager, Scott Mellanby as director of player personnel, Martin Lapointe as director of player development and Michel Therrien as head coach. Other additions included the hiring of Kirk Muller as an associate coach in 2016, as well as Gerard Gallant, J. J. Daigneault and Clément Jodoin as assistant coaches. Bergevin also appointed former Canadiens defenseman Patrice Brisebois as player development coach on June 13, 2012. He finished second in voting for the General Manager of the Year award for the 2013–14 season, and again in the 2020–21 season.

On November 28, 2021, Bergevin was fired from the Montreal Canadiens.

On January 9, 2022, Bergevin was hired as a senior advisor to the general manager for the Los Angeles Kings.

<doc id="711267" wikidata="Q1432360" url="?curid=711267" title="Ronald Reagan Presidential Library">
<text>The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library is the presidential library and burial site of Ronald Reagan, the 40th president of the United States (1981–1989), and his wife Nancy Reagan. Located in Simi Valley, California, the library is administered by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). 

The library opened in 1991 and houses the repository of presidential records from the Reagan administration. The library contains millions of documents, photographs, films and tapes. It also contains memorabilia and a permanent exhibit of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s life. 

==Planning==
The first person to propose a site for the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library was W. Glenn Campbell, director of the Hoover Institution, a conservative think tank much used by Reagan for policy positions. Campbell contacted Ronald Reagan in February 1981 to say that the Hoover Institution was willing to host the Reagan Library at their headquarters on the campus of Stanford University in Northern California. The advantage held by Hoover was that Reagan was an honorary fellow, and Hoover already housed Reagan&#x27;s papers from his campaign for and transition to governor of California. Ronald and Nancy Reagan participated in occasional informal discussions about the library plans with Campbell and Stanford President Donald Kennedy through 1982. During this time, a proposal to place the Richard Nixon Presidential Library on campus at Duke University in North Carolina was under attack by Duke faculty and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) who were all worried that the Richard Nixon Foundation would not allow scholarly access to archives, which they judged was the primary purpose of a presidential library. The Duke faculty were also firmly against having a museum serve as a memorial to Nixon who had left office in disgrace. This public controversy shaped the discussions about a Reagan Library at Stanford. Reagan hosted the Hoover Institution at the White House in January 1982, telling them, &quot;You built the knowledge base that made the changes now taking place in Washington possible.&quot;

Reagan formally accepted the Hoover Institution invitation in January 1983. The plans included three components: an archival library for researchers, a museum for the general public, and a &quot;Center for Public Affairs&quot; which would serve as a think tank to promote the ideas of the Reagan Foundation. Negotiations were undertaken between Stanford&#x27;s Kennedy and Reagan&#x27;s adviser Edwin Meese. In June 1983, Kennedy called for Stanford faculty to express their opinions through the Rosse Committee, to report by October. Professor John Manley accused the Hoover Institution of right-wing bias, and said that Stanford&#x27;s reputation for objectivity would suffer from partisanship. The Rosse Committee reported both the negative and the positive aspects of the proposed library, and Stanford&#x27;s Board of Trustees approved the location in December 1983. The agreement was announced in February 1984. Local opposition heightened after that, and a student group was formed to publicize the negative aspects, shocking their readers with fearful images of scholarly Stanford turning into a political &quot;Reagan University&quot;. This polarized response was compared in the press to the Nixon Foundation&#x27;s difficulties at Duke. A recurring point of contention was the Center for Public Affairs; some critics announced they would only approve the project if the think tank was removed or relocated offsite. Nancy Reagan insisted that the three components were indivisible, that she would not consider any suggestion of splitting up the proposal.

Because of continued concerns about partisan politics, the library plans were canceled by Stanford in 1987. The site in Simi Valley was chosen the same year.

==Design==
The Reagan Library is located at 40 Presidential Drive in Simi Valley, California about northwest of downtown Los Angeles and west of Chatsworth.

The library&#x27;s design was unveiled on January 28, 1987, in Spanish Mission style. According to its architect, Hugh Stubbins, Reagan approved the design, likening it to his residence of Rancho del Cielo.

New York design agency Donovan/Green was contracted to design the facility&#x27;s interior and exhibition spaces with partner Nancye Green overseeing the project. Construction of the library began in 1988, and the center was dedicated on November 4, 1991. The dedication ceremonies were the first time in United States history that five American presidents gathered together in the same place: Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan himself, and George H. W. Bush. Six First Ladies also attended: Lady Bird Johnson, Pat Nixon, Betty Ford, Rosalynn Carter, Nancy Reagan, and Barbara Bush.

==Facilities and management==
As a presidential library administered by the NARA, the Reagan Library, under the authority of the Presidential Records Act, is the repository of presidential records for the Reagan administration. Holdings include 50 million pages of presidential documents, over 1.6 million photographs, a half-million feet of motion picture film and thousands of audio and video tapes. The library also houses personal papers collections including documents from Reagan&#x27;s eight years as California&#x27;s governor.

The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute is an independent non-profit corporation founded by Ronald Reagan that works with the National Archives and that &quot;sustains the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in Simi Valley, CA, the Reagan Center for Public Affairs, the Presidential Learning Center, The Air Force One Pavilion, the award-winning Reagan Leadership Academy and the Reagan Institute&quot; according to its website.

When the Reagan Library opened, it was the largest of the presidential libraries, at approximately . It held that title until the dedication of the Clinton Presidential Center on November 18, 2004. With the opening of the Air Force One Pavilion in October 2005, the Reagan Library reclaimed the title in terms of physical size; however, the Clinton Library remains the largest presidential library in terms of materials. Like all presidential libraries since that of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Reagan Library was built entirely with private donations, at a cost of $60 million (equivalent to $ in ). Major donors included Walter Annenberg, Lew Wasserman, Lodwrick Cook, Joe Albritton, Rupert Murdoch, Richard Sills, and John P. McGovern. 

For fiscal year 2007, the Reagan Library had 305,331 visitors, making it the second-most-visited presidential library, following the Lyndon B. Johnson Library; that was down from its fiscal year 2006 number of 440,301 visitors, when it was the most visited library. In 2021, it was said that the library was averaging some 375,000 annual visitors prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Artifacts inventory ===
On November 8, 2007, Reagan Library National Archives officials reported that due to poor record-keeping, they are unable to say whether approximately 80,000 artifacts have been stolen or are lost inside the museum complex. A &quot;near-universal&quot; security breakdown was also blamed, leaving the artifacts vulnerable to theft. Many of the nation&#x27;s presidential libraries claim to be understaffed and underfunded. The NARA labeled the Reagan Library as having the most serious problems with its inventory. In an audit, U.S. Archivist Allen Weinstein blamed the library&#x27;s poor inventory software for the mishap. Frederick J. Ryan Jr., president of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation&#x27;s board of directors, said the allegations of poor management practices at the library reflect badly on the National Archives. The library has undertaken an inventory project that will take years to complete.

===Wildfire incident===
In the 2019 Easy Fire, the library had to be evacuated and was almost completely surrounded by the fire. Earlier the same year, the brush around the buildings had been cleared by goats to create a defensible space, which helped save the facilities from burning down, according to a firefighter. Olive trees used in the landscaping were damaged along with presidential banners lining the access road. A major item in the estimated half a million dollars of damage was an internet and cable box that took down the library&#x27;s network.

==Exhibits and scenery==

The museum features continually changing temporary exhibits and a permanent exhibit covering Reagan&#x27;s life. This exhibit begins during Reagan&#x27;s childhood in Dixon, Illinois, and follows his life through his film career and military service, marriage to Nancy Davis Reagan, and political career. The &quot;Citizen Governor&quot; gallery shows footage of Reagan&#x27;s 1964 &quot;A Time for Choosing&quot; speech and contains displays on his eight years as governor. The gallery includes a 1965 Ford Mustang used by Reagan during his first gubernatorial campaign, as well as the desk he used as governor. His 1980 and 1984 presidential campaigns are also highlighted, as well as his inauguration suit and a table from the White House Situation Room is on display. News footage of the 1981 assassination attempt on his life is shown, and information about the proposed Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI, dubbed &quot;Star Wars&quot;) is included.

A full-scale replica of the Oval Office, a feature of most presidential libraries, is a prominent feature of this museum as well. Among the items Reagan kept on the &quot;Resolute&quot; desk, which is replicated in the exhibit, was a copy of a bronze statue of &quot;Old Bill Williams&quot;, by B. R. Pettit; Williams was a renowned mountain man of Arizona. Other parts of the exhibit focus on Reagan&#x27;s Rancho del Cielo, the presidential retreat Camp David, life in the White House, and Nancy Reagan. An example of a temporary exhibit that ran from November 10, 2007, to November 10, 2008, was titled &quot;Nancy Reagan: A First Lady&#x27;s Style&quot; and had featured over 80 designer dresses belonging to Nancy Reagan.

The hilltop grounds provide expansive views of the area, a re-creation of a portion of the White House Lawn, and a piece of the Berlin Wall. An F-14 Tomcat (BuNo 162592) is also located on the grounds.

In February 2016, a large equestrian statue of Reagan was installed in front of the Air Force One Pavilion. Entitled &quot;Along the Trail&quot;, it depicts Reagan riding his favorite horse, El Alamein. An earlier bronze entitled &quot;Begins the Trail&quot;, both by sculptor Donald L. Reed, stands in Dixon.

==Air Force One Pavilion==
A exhibit hangar serves as the setting for the permanent display of Air Force One during Reagan&#x27;s administration. The aircraft, SAM 27000, was also used by six other presidents in its active service life from 1973 until 2001, including Richard Nixon during his second term, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush. In 1990, it became a backup aircraft after the Boeing 747s entered into service and was retired in 2001. The aircraft was flown to San Bernardino International Airport in September 2001, where it was presented to the Reagan Foundation. In what was known as Operation Homeward Bound, Boeing, the plane&#x27;s manufacturer, disassembled the plane and transported it to the library in pieces. After the construction of the foundation of the pavilion itself, the plane was reassembled and restored to museum quality, as well as raised onto pedestals above ground. The pavilion was dedicated on October 24, 2005, by Nancy Reagan, President George W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush.

SAM 27000 is part of a comprehensive display about presidential travel that also includes a Sikorsky VH-3 Sea King during Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s presidency, call sign Marine One, and a presidential motorcade—Reagan&#x27;s 1984 presidential parade limousine, a 1982 Los Angeles Police Department police car (as well as two 1980s police motorcycles), and a 1986 Secret Service vehicle used in one of President Reagan&#x27;s motorcades in Los Angeles. The pavilion is also home to the original O&#x27;Farrell&#x27;s pub from Ballyporeen in Ireland that Ronald and Nancy Reagan visited in June 1984, now called the &quot;Ronald Reagan Pub&quot;. Also featured are exhibits on the Cold War and Reagan&#x27;s extensive travels aboard Air Force One.

On June 9, 2008, U.S. secretary of education Margaret Spellings joined Nancy Reagan to dedicate the Reagan Library Discovery Center, located in the Air Force One Pavilion. The center is an interactive youth exhibit in which fifth through eighth grade students participate in role-playing exercises based on events of the Reagan administration.

==Center for Public Affairs==
On May 23, 2007, U.S. secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer held a brief private talk and a press conference. On July 17, 2007, Polish president Lech Kaczyński presented Poland&#x27;s highest distinction, the Order of the White Eagle, to Nancy Reagan on behalf of her husband.

==Funeral of Ronald Reagan==


Following his death, Reagan&#x27;s casket was driven by hearse to the Reagan Library on June 7, 2004, from Point Mugu through a procession down Las Posas Road to U.S. Highway 101. Many people lined the streets and freeway overpasses to pay final respects. A memorial service was held in the library lobby with Nancy Reagan, Reagan&#x27;s children, close relatives, and friends. The Reverend Dr. Michael Wenning officiated at the service.

From June 7 to 9, Reagan&#x27;s casket lay in repose in the library lobby, where approximately 105,000 people viewed the casket to pay their respects. After the national funeral service was held in Washington, D.C., Reagan&#x27;s casket was brought back to the library for a last memorial service and interment.

Construction plans for the library included a tomb for the eventual use of Reagan and his wife. Following a sunset service on the library grounds the previous evening, early on the morning of June 12, Reagan was laid to rest in the underground vault.

Nancy Reagan died on March 6, 2016. After her funeral, she was buried next to her husband at the library on March 11.

==Republican primary debates==
On May 3, 2007, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Nancy Reagan hosted the first 2008 Republican primary debate in the library&#x27;s Air Force One Pavilion. During the debate, candidates made at least 20 references to Ronald Reagan and his presidency. On January 30, 2008, the library was the scene of the final debate, once again hosted by the Reagan Foundation and Mrs. Reagan.

The library announced that it would once again host the first Republican primary debate among 2012 Republican candidates, initially scheduled for May 2, 2011, but later postponed it until after other debates. The debate was co-hosted by NBC News and Politico. The debate took place on September 7, 2011.

In September 2015, the library hosted the second 2016 Republican presidential debate, which was run by CNN. The second debate of the 2024 Republican presidential primaries was held on September 27, 2023 at the library.

==Centennial and library renovation==
The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and General Electric (GE) announced a partnership beginning March 17, 2010, to support the two-year-long celebration of Reagan&#x27;s 100th birthday on February 6, 2011. GE, for whom Reagan hosted &quot;General Electric Theater&quot; and served as a goodwill ambassador from 1954 to 1962, prior to being elected governor of California, served as the Presenting Sponsor of the historic Reagan Centennial Celebration.

The Reagan Centennial was also being led by the National Youth Leadership Committee. Notable members of the Committee include chairpersons Nick Jonas, Jordin Sparks and Austin Dillon, as well as famous non-chairpersons, including actress Anna Maria Perez de Tagle, Olympic bronze medalist Bryon Wilson, Olympian and X-Games medalist Hannah Teter, and recording artist Jordan Pruitt. Several other Olympians and athletes are also members of the committee.

==2023 Tsai–McCarthy meeting==

On April 5, 2023, Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen and U.S. House speaker Kevin McCarthy met at the library. The meeting was significant as it marked the first time a Taiwanese president had met with a U.S. House Speaker on American soil. It was also significant as it was the second time in less than a year that a Taiwanese president had met with a U.S. House speaker since Tsai met with then-speaker Nancy Pelosi in Taipei in August 2022. In response to the meeting, the Foreign Ministry of China imposed sanctions on the Reagan Library.

<text>The white-billed buffalo weaver (Bubalornis albirostris) is a resident breeding bird species in most of Africa south of the Sahara Desert.

This common weaver occurs in open country, especially cultivation and scrub. It is a communal breeder, building massive untidy stick nests in tree colonies, each of which may have several spherical woven nests within. Two to four eggs are laid.

The white-billed buffalo weaver is large and stocky, commonly measuring 23 to 24 centimeters. The adult is mainly black with white flecking on the back and wings. The conical bill is very thick, and appears more so because it is surmounted by a white frontal shield. The bill is white in breeding males.

The adult female and non-breeding male are similar, but the bill is black. Young birds are dark brown in plumage.

The white-billed buffalo weaver is a gregarious species which feeds on grain and insects. This is a noisy bird, especially in colonies, with a range of cackles and squeaks.

<text>The 1874 Canadian federal election was held on January 22, 1874, to elect members of the House of Commons of Canada of the 3rd Parliament of Canada. Sir John A. Macdonald, who had recently been forced out of office as prime minister, and his Conservatives were defeated by the Liberal Party under their new leader Prime Minister Alexander Mackenzie. Macdonald&#x27;s government had been forced to resign on November 5, 1873, because of allegations of corruption relating to the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway (see the Pacific Scandal). The Tories were unable to recover from the scandal and lost the next election.

The Liberals under Mackenzie had formed a government on November 7 and than called an election for January. 

The election was the first general election after Prince Edward Island&#x27;s entry into Confederation. 

Mackenzie was a reformer, and the 1874 election was the first Canadian election to use secret ballots. He promised to reform election laws in other ways too, including the introduction of simultaneous voting (all seats filled at once instead of successively in long-drawn-out election period), judicial consideration of contested electíons, and extension of the franchise. He also made most important pledges concerning railway projects.

<doc id="711288" wikidata="Q910483" url="?curid=711288" title="Viscoelasticity">
<text>In materials science and continuum mechanics, viscoelasticity is the property of materials that exhibit both viscous and elastic characteristics when undergoing deformation. Viscous materials, like water, resist both shear flow and strain linearly with time when a stress is applied. Elastic materials strain when stretched and immediately return to their original state once the stress is removed.

Viscoelastic materials have elements of both of these properties and, as such, exhibit time-dependent strain. Whereas elasticity is usually the result of bond stretching along crystallographic planes in an ordered solid, viscosity is the result of the diffusion of atoms or molecules inside an amorphous material.

==Background==
In the nineteenth century, physicists such as James Clerk Maxwell, Ludwig Boltzmann, and Lord Kelvin researched and experimented with creep and recovery of glasses, metals, and rubbers. Viscoelasticity was further examined in the late twentieth century when synthetic polymers were engineered and used in a variety of applications. Viscoelasticity calculations depend heavily on the viscosity variable, &quot;η&quot;. The inverse of &quot;η&quot; is also known as fluidity, &quot;φ&quot;. The value of either can be derived as a function of temperature or as a given value (i.e. for a dashpot).

Depending on the change of strain rate versus stress inside a material, the viscosity can be categorized as having a linear, non-linear, or plastic response. When a material exhibits a linear response it is categorized as a Newtonian material. In this case the stress is linearly proportional to the strain rate. If the material exhibits a non-linear response to the strain rate, it is categorized as non-Newtonian fluid. There is also an interesting case where the viscosity decreases as the shear/strain rate remains constant. A material which exhibits this type of behavior is known as thixotropic. In addition, when the stress is independent of this strain rate, the material exhibits plastic deformation. Many viscoelastic materials exhibit rubber like behavior explained by the thermodynamic theory of polymer elasticity.

Some examples of viscoelastic materials are amorphous polymers, semicrystalline polymers, biopolymers, metals at very high temperatures, and bitumen materials. Cracking occurs when the strain is applied quickly and outside of the elastic limit. Ligaments and tendons are viscoelastic, so the extent of the potential damage to them depends on both the rate of the change of their length and the force applied.

A viscoelastic material has the following properties:
* hysteresis is seen in the stress–strain curve
* stress relaxation occurs: step constant strain causes decreasing stress
* creep occurs: step constant stress causes increasing strain
*its stiffness depends on the strain rate formula_1or the stress rate formula_2

== Elastic versus viscoelastic behavior ==
Unlike purely elastic substances, a viscoelastic substance has an elastic component and a viscous component. The viscosity of a viscoelastic substance gives the substance a strain rate dependence on time. Purely elastic materials do not dissipate energy (heat) when a load is applied, then removed. However, a viscoelastic substance dissipates energy when a load is applied, then removed. Hysteresis is observed in the stress–strain curve, with the area of the loop being equal to the energy lost during the loading cycle. Since viscosity is the resistance to thermally activated plastic deformation, a viscous material will lose energy through a loading cycle. Plastic deformation results in lost energy, which is uncharacteristic of a purely elastic material&#x27;s reaction to a loading cycle.

Specifically, viscoelasticity is a molecular rearrangement. When a stress is applied to a viscoelastic material such as a polymer, parts of the long polymer chain change positions. This movement or rearrangement is called creep. Polymers remain a solid material even when these parts of their chains are rearranging in order to accommodate the stress, and as this occurs, it creates a back stress in the material. When the back stress is the same magnitude as the applied stress, the material no longer creeps. When the original stress is taken away, the accumulated back stresses will cause the polymer to return to its original form. The material creeps, which gives the prefix visco-, and the material fully recovers, which gives the suffix -elasticity.

== Linear viscoelasticity and nonlinear viscoelasticity==
Linear viscoelasticity is when the function is separable in both creep response and load. All linear viscoelastic models can be represented by a Volterra equation connecting stress and strain:
formula_3
or
formula_4
where 
* is time
* formula_5 is stress
* formula_6 is strain
* formula_7 and formula_8 are instantaneous elastic moduli for creep and relaxation
* is the creep function
* is the relaxation function

Linear viscoelasticity is usually applicable only for small deformations.

Nonlinear viscoelasticity is when the function is not separable. It usually happens when the deformations are large or if the material changes its properties under deformations. Nonlinear viscoelasticity also elucidates observed phenomena such as normal stresses, shear thinning, and extensional thickening in viscoelastic fluids.

An anelastic material is a special case of a viscoelastic material: an anelastic material will fully recover to its original state on the removal of load.

When distinguishing between elastic, viscous, and forms of viscoelastic behavior, it is helpful to reference the time scale of the measurement relative to the relaxation times of the material being observed, known as the Deborah number (De) where:
formula_9
where
* formula_10 is the relaxation time of the material
* formula_11 is time

== Dynamic modulus ==
Viscoelasticity is studied using dynamic mechanical analysis, applying a small oscillatory stress and measuring the resulting strain.
* Purely elastic materials have stress and strain in phase, so that the response of one caused by the other is immediate.
* In purely viscous materials, strain lags stress by a 90 degree phase.
* Viscoelastic materials exhibit behavior somewhere in the middle of these two types of material, exhibiting some lag in strain.

A complex dynamic modulus G can be used to represent the relations between the oscillating stress and strain:
formula_12
where formula_13; formula_14 is the &quot;storage modulus&quot; and formula_15 is the &quot;loss modulus&quot;:
formula_16
formula_17
where formula_18 and formula_19 are the amplitudes of stress and strain respectively, and formula_20 is the phase shift between them.

== Constitutive models of linear viscoelasticity ==

Viscoelastic materials, such as amorphous polymers, semicrystalline polymers, biopolymers and even the living tissue and cells, can be modeled in order to determine their stress and strain or force and displacement interactions as well as their temporal dependencies. These models, which include the Maxwell model, the Kelvin–Voigt model, the standard linear solid model, and the Burgers model, are used to predict a material&#x27;s response under different loading conditions.

Viscoelastic behavior has elastic and viscous components modeled as linear combinations of springs and dashpots, respectively. Each model differs in the arrangement of these elements, and all of these viscoelastic models can be equivalently modeled as electrical circuits.

In an equivalent electrical circuit, stress is represented by current, and strain rate by voltage. The elastic modulus of a spring is analogous to the inverse of a circuit&#x27;s &quot;inductance&quot; (it stores energy) and the viscosity of a dashpot to a circuit&#x27;s &quot;resistance&quot; (it dissipates energy).

The elastic components, as previously mentioned, can be modeled as springs of elastic constant E, given the formula:
formula_21
where σ is the stress, E is the elastic modulus of the material, and ε is the strain that occurs under the given stress, similar to Hooke&#x27;s law.

The viscous components can be modeled as dashpots such that the stress–strain rate relationship can be given as,
formula_22
where σ is the stress, η is the viscosity of the material, and dε/dt is the time derivative of strain.

The relationship between stress and strain can be simplified for specific stress or strain rates. For high stress or strain rates/short time periods, the time derivative components of the stress–strain relationship dominate. In these conditions it can be approximated as a rigid rod capable of sustaining high loads without deforming. Hence, the dashpot can be considered to be a &quot;short-circuit&quot;.

Conversely, for low stress states/longer time periods, the time derivative components are negligible and the dashpot can be effectively removed from the system – an &quot;open&quot; circuit. As a result, only the spring connected in parallel to the dashpot will contribute to the total strain in the system.

===Maxwell model===

The Maxwell model can be represented by a purely viscous damper and a purely elastic spring connected in series, as shown in the diagram. The model can be represented by the following equation:
formula_23

Under this model, if the material is put under a constant strain, the stresses gradually relax. When a material is put under a constant stress, the strain has two components. First, an elastic component occurs instantaneously, corresponding to the spring, and relaxes immediately upon release of the stress. The second is a viscous component that grows with time as long as the stress is applied. The Maxwell model predicts that stress decays exponentially with time, which is accurate for most polymers. One limitation of this model is that it does not predict creep accurately. The Maxwell model for creep or constant-stress conditions postulates that strain will increase linearly with time. However, polymers for the most part show the strain rate to be decreasing with time.

This model can be applied to soft solids: thermoplastic polymers in the vicinity of their melting temperature, fresh concrete (neglecting its aging), and numerous metals at a temperature close to their melting point.

The equation introduced here, however, lacks a consistent derivation from more microscopic model and is not observer independent. The Upper-convected Maxwell model is its sound formulation in tems of the Cauchy stress tensor and constitutes the simplest tensorial constitutive model for viscoelasticity (see e.g. or 

===Kelvin–Voigt model===

The Kelvin–Voigt model, also known as the Voigt model, consists of a Newtonian damper and Hookean elastic spring connected in parallel, as shown in the picture. It is used to explain the creep behaviour of polymers.

The constitutive relation is expressed as a linear first-order differential equation:
formula_24

This model represents a solid undergoing reversible, viscoelastic strain. Upon application of a constant stress, the material deforms at a decreasing rate, asymptotically approaching the steady-state strain. When the stress is released, the material gradually relaxes to its undeformed state. At constant stress (creep), the model is quite realistic as it predicts strain to tend to σ/E as time continues to infinity. Similar to the Maxwell model, the Kelvin–Voigt model also has limitations. The model is extremely good with modelling creep in materials, but with regards to relaxation the model is much less accurate.

This model can be applied to organic polymers, rubber, and wood when the load is not too high.

=== Standard linear solid model ===
The standard linear solid model, also known as the Zener model, consists of two springs and a dashpot. It is the simplest model that describes both the creep and stress relaxation behaviors of a viscoelastic material properly. For this model, the governing constitutive relations are:

Under a constant stress, the modeled material will instantaneously deform to some strain, which is the instantaneous elastic portion of the strain. After that it will continue to deform and asymptotically approach a steady-state strain, which is the retarded elastic portion of the strain. Although the standard linear solid model is more accurate than the Maxwell and Kelvin–Voigt models in predicting material responses, mathematically it returns inaccurate results for strain under specific loading conditions.

=== Jeffreys model ===
The Jeffreys model like the Zener model is a three element model. It consist of two dashpots and a spring.

It was proposed in 1929 by Harold Jeffreys to study Earth&#x27;s mantle.

=== Burgers model ===

The Burgers model consists of either two Maxwell components in parallel or a Kelvin–Voigt component, a spring and a dashpot in series. For this model, the governing constitutive relations are:

This model incorporates viscous flow into the standard linear solid model, giving a linearly increasing asymptote for strain under fixed loading conditions.
=== Generalized Maxwell model ===
The generalized Maxwell model, also known as the Wiechert model, is the most general form of the linear model for viscoelasticity. It takes into account that the relaxation does not occur at a single time, but at a distribution of times. Due to molecular segments of different lengths with shorter ones contributing less than longer ones, there is a varying time distribution. The Wiechert model shows this by having as many spring–dashpot Maxwell elements as necessary to accurately represent the distribution. The figure on the right shows the generalised Wiechert model.
Applications: metals and alloys at temperatures lower than one quarter of their absolute melting temperature (expressed in K).
== Constitutive models for nonlinear viscoelasticity ==
Non-linear viscoelastic constitutive equations are needed to quantitatively account for phenomena in fluids like differences in normal stresses, shear thinning, and extensional thickening. Necessarily, the history experienced by the material is needed to account for time-dependent behavior, and is typically included in models as a history kernel K.

=== Second-order fluid ===

The second-order fluid is typically considered the simplest nonlinear viscoelastic model, and typically occurs in a narrow region of materials behavior occurring at high strain amplitudes and Deborah number between Newtonian fluids and other more complicated nonlinear viscoelastic fluids. The second-order fluid constitutive equation is given by:

formula_25

where:
* formula_26 is the identity tensor
* formula_27 is the deformation tensor
* formula_28 denote viscosity, and first and second normal stress coefficients, respectively
* formula_29 denotes the upper-convected derivative of the deformation tensor where formula_30 and formula_31 is the material time derivative of the deformation tensor.

=== Upper-convected Maxwell model ===

The upper-convected Maxwell model incorporates nonlinear time behavior into the viscoelastic Maxwell model, given by:

formula_32
where formula_33 denotes the stress tensor.

=== Oldroyd-B model ===

The Oldroyd-B model is an extension of the Upper Convected Maxwell model and is interpreted as a solvent filled with elastic bead and spring dumbbells.
The model is named after its creator James G. Oldroyd.

The model can be written as:
formula_34
where:
* formula_35 is the stress tensor;
* formula_36 is the relaxation time;
* formula_37 is the retardation time = formula_38;
* formula_39 is the upper convected time derivative of stress tensor:formula_40
*formula_41 is the fluid velocity;
*formula_42 is the total viscosity composed of solvent and polymer components, formula_43;
*formula_44 is the deformation rate tensor or rate of strain tensor, formula_45.

Whilst the model gives good approximations of viscoelastic fluids in shear flow, it has an unphysical singularity in extensional flow, where the dumbbells are infinitely stretched. This is, however, specific to idealised flow; in the case of a cross-slot geometry the extensional flow is not ideal, so the stress, although singular, remains integrable, although the stress is infinite in a correspondingly infinitely small region.

If the solvent viscosity is zero, the Oldroyd-B becomes the upper convected Maxwell model.

=== Wagner model ===

Wagner model is might be considered as a simplified practical form of the Bernstein–Kearsley–Zapas model. The model was developed by German rheologist Manfred Wagner.

For the isothermal conditions the model can be written as:
formula_46

where:
*formula_47 is the Cauchy stress tensor as function of time &quot;t&quot;,
*&quot;p&quot; is the pressure
*formula_48 is the unity tensor
*&quot;M&quot; is the memory function showing, usually expressed as a sum of exponential terms for each mode of relaxation: formula_49 where for each mode of the relaxation, formula_50 is the relaxation modulus and formula_51 is the relaxation time;
*formula_52 is the &quot;strain damping&quot; function that depends upon the first and second invariants of Finger tensor formula_53.

The &quot;strain damping function&quot; is usually written as:
formula_54
If the value of the strain hardening function is equal to one, then the deformation is small; if it approaches zero, then the deformations are large.

==Prony series==
In a one-dimensional relaxation test, the material is subjected to a sudden strain that is kept constant over the duration of the test, and the stress is measured over time. The initial stress is due to the elastic response of the material. Then, the stress relaxes over time due to the viscous effects in the material. Typically, either a tensile, compressive, bulk compression, or shear strain is applied. The resulting stress vs. time data can be fitted with a number of equations, called models. Only the notation changes depending on the type of strain applied: tensile-compressive relaxation is denoted formula_55, shear is denoted formula_56, bulk is denoted formula_57. The Prony series for the shear relaxation is

formula_58

where formula_59 is the long term modulus once the material is totally relaxed, formula_60 are the relaxation times (not to be confused with formula_60 in the diagram); the higher their values, the longer it takes for the stress to relax. The data is fitted with the equation by using a minimization algorithm that adjust the parameters (formula_62) to minimize the error between the predicted and data values.

An alternative form is obtained noting that the elastic modulus is related to the long term modulus by

formula_63

Therefore,

formula_64

This form is convenient when the elastic shear modulus formula_65 is obtained from data independent from the relaxation data, and/or for computer implementation, when it is desired to specify the elastic properties separately from the viscous properties, as in Simulia (2010).

A creep experiment is usually easier to perform than a relaxation one, so most data is available as (creep) compliance vs. time. Unfortunately, there is no known closed form for the (creep) compliance in terms of the coefficient of the Prony
series. So, if one has creep data, it is not easy to get the coefficients of the (relaxation) Prony series, which are needed for example in. An expedient way to obtain these coefficients is the following. First, fit the creep data with a model that has closed form solutions in both compliance and relaxation; for example the Maxwell-Kelvin model
(eq. 7.18-7.19) in Barbero (2007) or the Standard Solid Model (eq. 7.20-7.21) in Barbero (2007) (section 7.1.3). Once the parameters of the creep model are known, produce relaxation pseudo-data with the conjugate relaxation model for the same
times of the original data. Finally, fit the pseudo data with the Prony series.

==Effect of temperature==
The secondary bonds of a polymer constantly break and reform due to thermal motion. Application of a stress favors some conformations over others, so the molecules of the polymer will gradually &quot;flow&quot; into the favored conformations over time. Because thermal motion is one factor contributing to the deformation of polymers, viscoelastic properties change with increasing or decreasing temperature. In most cases, the creep modulus, defined as the ratio of applied stress to the time-dependent strain, decreases with increasing temperature. Generally speaking, an increase in temperature correlates to a logarithmic decrease in the time required to impart equal strain under a constant stress. In other words, it takes less work to stretch a viscoelastic material an equal distance at a higher temperature than it does at a lower temperature.

More detailed effect of temperature on the viscoelastic behavior of polymer can be plotted as shown.

There are mainly five regions (some denoted four, which combines IV and V together) included in the typical polymers.

*Region I: Glassy state of the polymer is presented in this region. The temperature in this region for a given polymer is too low to endow molecular motion. Hence the motion of the molecules is frozen in this area. The mechanical property is hard and brittle in this region.
*Region II: Polymer passes glass transition temperature in this region. Beyond Tg, the thermal energy provided by the environment is enough to unfreeze the motion of molecules. The molecules are allowed to have local motion in this region hence leading to a sharp drop in stiffness compared to Region I.
*Region III: Rubbery plateau region. Materials lie in this region would exist long-range elasticity driven by entropy. For instance, a rubber band is disordered in the initial state of this region. When stretching the rubber band, you also align the structure to be more ordered. Therefore, when releasing the rubber band, it will spontaneously seek higher entropy state hence goes back to its initial state. This is what we called entropy-driven elasticity shape recovery.
*Region IV: The behavior in the rubbery flow region is highly time-dependent. Polymers in this region would need to use a time-temperature superposition to get more detailed information to cautiously decide how to use the materials. For instance, if the material is used to cope with short interaction time purpose, it could present as &#x27;hard&#x27; material. While using for long interaction time purposes, it would act as &#x27;soft&#x27; material.
*Region V: Viscous polymer flows easily in this region. Another significant drop in stiffness.
Extreme cold temperatures can cause viscoelastic materials to change to the glass phase and become brittle. For example, exposure of pressure sensitive adhesives to extreme cold (dry ice, freeze spray, etc.) causes them to lose their tack, resulting in debonding.

==Viscoelastic creep==


When subjected to a step constant stress, viscoelastic materials experience a time-dependent increase in strain. This phenomenon is known as viscoelastic creep.

At time formula_66, a viscoelastic material is loaded with a constant stress that is maintained for a sufficiently long time period. The material responds to the stress with a strain that increases until the material ultimately fails, if it is a viscoelastic liquid. If, on the other hand, it is a viscoelastic solid, it may or may not fail depending on the applied stress versus the material&#x27;s ultimate resistance. When the stress is maintained for a shorter time period, the material undergoes an initial strain until a time formula_67, after which the strain immediately decreases (discontinuity) then gradually decreases at times formula_68 to a residual strain.

Viscoelastic creep data can be presented by plotting the creep modulus (constant applied stress divided by total strain at a particular time) as a function of time. Below its critical stress, the viscoelastic creep modulus is independent of stress applied. A family of curves describing strain versus time response to various applied stress may be represented by a single viscoelastic creep modulus versus time curve if the applied stresses are below the material&#x27;s critical stress value.

Viscoelastic creep is important when considering long-term structural design. Given loading and temperature conditions, designers can choose materials that best suit component lifetimes.

== Measurement ==

=== Shear rheometry ===
Shear rheometers are based on the idea of putting the material to be measured between two plates, one or both of which move in a shear direction to induce stresses and strains in the material. The testing can be done at constant strain rate, stress, or in an oscillatory fashion (a form of dynamic mechanical analysis). Shear rheometers are typically limited by edge effects where the material may leak out from between the two plates and slipping at the material/plate interface.

=== Extensional rheometry ===
Extensional rheometers, also known as extensiometers, measure viscoelastic properties by pulling a viscoelastic fluid, typically uniaxially. Because this typically makes use of capillary forces and confines the fluid to a narrow geometry, the technique is often limited to fluids with relatively low viscosity like dilute polymer solutions or some molten polymers. Extensional rheometers are also limited by edge effects at the ends of the extensiometer and pressure differences between inside and outside the capillary.

Despite the apparent limitations mentioned above, extensional rheometry can also be performed on high viscosity fluids. Although this requires the use of different instruments, these techniques and apparatuses allow for the study of the extensional viscoelastic properties of materials such as polymer melts. Three of the most common extensional rheometry instruments developed within the last 50 years are the Meissner-type rheometer, the filament stretching rheometer (FiSER), and the Sentmanat Extensional Rheometer (SER).

The Meissner-type rheometer, developed by Meissner and Hostettler in 1996, uses two sets of counter-rotating rollers to strain a sample uniaxially. This method uses a constant sample length throughout the experiment, and supports the sample in between the rollers via an air cushion to eliminate sample sagging effects. It does suffer from a few issues – for one, the fluid may slip at the belts which leads to lower strain rates than one would expect. Additionally, this equipment is challenging to operate and costly to purchase and maintain.

The FiSER rheometer simply contains fluid in between two plates. During an experiment, the top plate is held steady and a force is applied to the bottom plate, moving it away from the top one. The strain rate is measured by the rate of change of the sample radius at its middle. It is calculated using the following equation:
formula_69
where formula_70 is the mid-radius value and formula_71 is the strain rate. The viscosity of the sample is then calculated using the following equation:
formula_72
where formula_73 is the sample viscosity, and formula_74 is the force applied to the sample to pull it apart.

Much like the Meissner-type rheometer, the SER rheometer uses a set of two rollers to strain a sample at a given rate. It then calculates the sample viscosity using the well known equation:
formula_75
where formula_76 is the stress, formula_73 is the viscosity and formula_71 is the strain rate. The stress in this case is determined via torque transducers present in the instrument. The small size of this instrument makes it easy to use and eliminates sample sagging between the rollers. A schematic detailing the operation of the SER extensional rheometer can be found on the right.
=== Other methods ===
Though there are many instruments that test the mechanical and viscoelastic response of materials, broadband viscoelastic spectroscopy (BVS) and resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) are more commonly used to test viscoelastic behavior because they can be used above and below ambient temperatures and are more specific to testing viscoelasticity. These two instruments employ a damping mechanism at various frequencies and time ranges with no appeal to time–temperature superposition. Using BVS and RUS to study the mechanical properties of materials is important to understanding how a material exhibiting viscoelasticity will perform.

<text>Trapper John, M.D. is an American medical drama television series and spin-off of the film &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (1970). Pernell Roberts portrayed the title character, a lovable surgeon who became a mentor and father figure in San Francisco, California. The show ran on CBS for seven seasons, from September 23, 1979, to September 4, 1986. Roberts played the character more than twice as long as had Wayne Rogers (1972–75) on the TV series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. The role of Trapper John was played by Elliott Gould in the film.

==Overview==
&quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot; focuses on Dr. &quot;Trapper&quot; John McIntyre (Pernell Roberts) 28 years after his discharge from the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) in the Korean War. During that time after the war, the character had mellowed considerably. He did not merely learn how to stop fighting the system but became a part of it, in a sense, as the Chief of Surgery at San Francisco Memorial Hospital. Trapper shows tremendous compassion toward his patients, often violating &quot;established hospital procedures&quot;.

===Seasons 1–6===
Working with Trapper is an aspiring young professional named Dr. George Alonzo Gates (Gregory Harrison), usually referred to as Gonzo, who has a lot in common with Trapper, having also served in a MASH unit (albeit during the later Vietnam War). His sense of humor and love of life also reflect elements of Trapper&#x27;s younger days. Gonzo resides in his motor home (dubbed &quot;The Titanic&quot;) in the hospital parking lot.
The show also involves several other characters that serve as hospital staff.

*Stanley Riverside II (Charles Siebert) is a pompous, status-seeking, but nonetheless capable doctor whose father is the head of the hospital board of directors. He later marries a dentist named E.J. (Marcia Rodd)
*Justin &quot;Jackpot&quot; Jackson (Brian Stokes Mitchell) is a young doctor always interested in wagers.
*Gloria &quot;Ripples&quot; Brancusi (Christopher Norris) is a young nurse who later adopts a sickly, homeless girl, Andrea. Her nickname Ripples was dropped after the first few episodes.
*Clara &quot;Starch&quot; Willoughby (Mary McCarty) is an experienced nurse who had served in the Korean War with Trapper. McCarty died after the first season. In the show&#x27;s continuity, at the beginning of season 2, her character is said to have married, retired, and moved away.
*Ernestine Shoop (Madge Sinclair) replaces Starch as the experienced older nurse from season 2 onwards. Sinclair picked up three Emmy nominations for her work as the dedicated and dignified Nurse Shoop.
*Arnold Slocum (Simon Scott) is the hospital administrator who often clashes with Trapper and Gonzo, though there is strong mutual respect between all parties. Slocum—though charged with operating within regulations and keeping to a budget—clearly has sympathy and compassion for the patients. Scott suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s and made his final appearance in season six before retiring from acting.
*In season six, Trapper&#x27;s son, J.T. McIntyre (Timothy Busfield), graduates from medical school and arrives at the hospital to work on his internship. He stays for the remainder of the run of the show.

===Season 7===
The show underwent a number of changes during &quot;Trapper John&quot;&#x27;s seventh and final season.

*Christopher Norris left the series at the end of season six. Her character Gloria is replaced by new nurse Libby Kegler (Lorna Luft) at the start of season seven.
*Simon Scott, suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, had made his final appearance partway through season six. At the beginning of season seven, his character of hospital administrator Arnold Slocum is said to have retired. Slocum is replaced by administrator Catherine Hackett (Janis Paige).
*Added as a recurring player beginning with the season&#x27;s third episode is ER service helicopter pilot and surgeon, Andy Pagano (Beau Gravitte).
*Mid-way through the season, Gregory Harrison elected to leave the show. The character of Gonzo is written out, as he retires from medicine after having suffered a stroke. Gonzo is replaced by Jacob Christmas (Kip Gilman), a doctor who loses his wife in an accident, and is forced to become a single parent to his young son while adjusting to his new work environment.

Only nine further irregularly-scheduled episodes of &quot;Trapper John&quot; were produced after Harrison&#x27;s departure.

After Harrison&#x27;s last episode, the show was off the air for three weeks, then brought back on a different night (Tuesday) before being pre-empted three times in the next four weeks. A top 30 hit for most of its run when it aired on Sunday, &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot; fell out of the top 30 during season seven, and was canceled by season&#x27;s end.

The final four episodes were aired on Thursday nights late in the summer of 1986, well after the show&#x27;s cancellation had already been announced.

==Episodes==

==Development==
In a suit filed in New York state court, Ingo Preminger, producer of the 1970 motion picture &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, claimed that under his deal with 20th Century Fox, his production company had both the right of first refusal to produce any spin-off of the movie, and the right to fees from the use of the book and film&#x27;s material. New York State Supreme Court Justice Martin Stecher found that Preminger&#x27;s agreement with Fox did not give him the right to produce &quot;Trapper John M.D.&quot;, but did entitle him to a 25% share in profits from the show. This decision was later cited by the same court in its 2008 decision in &quot;Kellman v. Mosley&quot;, involving a claim for royalties involving the Easy Rawlins detective series.

It has sometimes been reported that the producers of the television series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; filed suit claiming they were entitled to royalties from the new show, arguing that it was based on the character as portrayed in their series by Wayne Rogers, but the producers of &quot;Trapper John, M.D&quot; successfully argued that it was based only on the earlier film and Richard Hooker&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. Both TV series were produced under deals with 20th Century Fox Television, and the film was produced by parent company 20th Century Fox.

The pilot includes photos and video clips (part of a dream) taken from the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; film and TV series, including a publicity photo of Trapper (as portrayed by Wayne Rogers) and Hawkeye (Alan Alda), and the character mentions Radar and Hawkeye by name, while waking up from a dream about his time at M*A*S*H. However, none of the other M*A*S*H characters appeared as characters, and references to Trapper&#x27;s time in Korea were rare.

<text>Christian Jonas Berglund (born March 12, 1980) is a former professional Swedish ice hockey Left wing who last played for BIK Karlskoga in Hockeyallsvenskan (Swedish 2nd highest division). He previously played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the New Jersey Devils and the Florida Panthers.

==Playing career==
He began his career in Swedish Elite League with Färjestads BK and Swedish World Junior Championship teams. In the 1998 Entry Draft, Berglund became the New Jersey Devils&#x27;s third choice, being chosen in the second round as the 37th overall pick. He continued to play for Färjestad until 2001, when he signed with the Devils. He played in the minor league Albany River Rats, the Devils&#x27; affiliated team, but began playing for the Devils themselves later that season. On 1 March 2004, he and teammate Victor Uchevatov were traded to the Florida Panthers in exchange for Viktor Kozlov.

During the 2004–05 lockout season he went to back Sweden and Färjestad and played with them for one season. In the summer of 2005, he moved to the Swiss club SC Rapperswil-Jona Lakers, a club of the highest Swiss Hockey-League. He enjoyed a 5-year stint in the NLA, before returning again to his original club in Färjestad on a 4-year contract on April 21, 2010. On March 9, 2016, Berglund officially announced his retirement.

<doc id="711315" wikidata="Q6508547" url="?curid=711315" title="Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)">
<text>In New Zealand, the leader of the Official Opposition, commonly described as the leader of the Opposition, is the politician who heads the Official Opposition. Conventionally, they are the leader of the largest political party in the House of Representatives that is not in Government (nor provides confidence and supply). This is usually the parliamentary leader of the second-largest caucus in the House of Representatives.

When in the debating chamber the leader of the Opposition sits on the left-hand side of the centre table, in front of the Opposition and directly opposite the prime minister.

The role of the leader of the Opposition dates to the late 19th century, with the first organised political parties, and the office was formally recognised by law in 1933. Although currently mentioned in a number of statutes, the office is not formally established by any act of Parliament, just like the prime minister&#x27;s role; it is simply a product of the conventions of the Westminster-style parliamentary system. The leader of the Opposition is paid a special salary by virtue of the office, equivalent to that of a Cabinet minister.

Since 1936, the leader of the Opposition, as well as the prime minister, has invariably come from one of the two major parties, Labour or National. Therefore the leader of the Opposition has historically acquired that role by either losing a general election having previously been prime minister or by acquiring the leadership of the party that is already the Official Opposition. The rules on electing party leadership vary between parties. 

Since the outcome of the 2023 general election, the current holder of the office is the leader of the New Zealand Labour Party and former prime minister Chris Hipkins.

==Role==

The term &quot;opposition&quot; has a specific meaning in the parliamentary sense; it is an important component of the Westminster system, with the Official Opposition having the task of directing criticism towards the Government. The leader of the Opposition chairs a Shadow Cabinet, which scrutinises the policies and actions of the Cabinet led by the prime minister, and promotes alternative policies. Directed by the leader, the Opposition may move no-confidence motions to test the Government&#x27;s majority or the confidence of the House. The leader of the Opposition may be asked by the governor-general to form a new government if the incumbent government is unable to continue in office (e.g. upon a successful no-confidence motion).

Apart from parliamentary duties, there are several ways in which the leader of the Opposition participates directly in affairs of state. Often, these relate to national security matters, which are supposed to transcend party politics – the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service, for example, is required to brief the leader of the Opposition as well as the prime minister on certain matters of national security.

==Salary==
The leader of the Opposition receives a higher salary than other members of the Opposition, being paid the same amount as a Cabinet minister. the Leader of the Opposition&#x27;s salary is NZ$288,900. In addition, like all other members of parliament, the leader of the Opposition receives annual allowances for travel and lodging.

==History==
For much of the country&#x27;s early history, the role was not a formal one. For most of the 19th century, there was rarely any one person who could be identified as &quot;the&quot; leader of the Opposition. Prominent members were sometimes informally dubbed as &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; – often facetiously by rival politicians. It was only when the Liberal Party was formed that any unified leadership appeared in Parliament, and the role of Opposition leader is generally traced from this point. John Ballance, leader of the Liberals (and later premier) is usually considered the first leader of the Opposition in the modern sense.

When Ballance led the Liberals into government in 1891, they faced no formal opposition in a party sense, though certain MPs were styled leader of the Opposition. Their opponents gradually coalesced around a leader, William Massey, who became leader of the Opposition in 1903, and in 1909 became the first parliamentary leader of the new Reform Party. For the first time, an Opposition party came forward as an alternative government. After this, the leader of the Opposition was typically the parliamentary leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives that had not undertaken to support the government of the day.

One exception to this was during World War I, when the opposition Liberal Party accepted the governing Reform Party&#x27;s offer to form a wartime coalition. Prime Minister Massey also extended the offer to the new Labour Party who rejected it. This made Labour the largest party not in government, however their leader Alfred Hindmarsh was not officially recognised as the leader of the Opposition. Joseph Ward, who became deputy prime minister in the wartime cabinet, still retained the title, albeit in name only.

During the 1910s and 1920s, the role of Official Opposition alternated between the Liberal and Reform parties. However, the rise of the Labour Party in the 1920s, together with a gradual weakening in support for the Liberals, led to a three-party situation by the mid-1920s, with the Labour and Liberal parties having a similar number of seats. After the 1925 election there was no official leader of the Opposition until Rex Mason of Labour won the seat of Eden in the by-election held on 15 April 1926. Labour superseded the Liberals as the Official Opposition, and their leader Harry Holland became the leader of the Opposition.

The 1928 general election put the United Party (a remnant of the Liberals) in government for the last time. Reform then became the Opposition, however in 1931 Reform entered into coalition with the Liberals, and Labour then became the Official Opposition, despite being the third party. The unity of the coalition, culminating in the formation of the National Party in 1936, created a stable two-party system, with National and Labour alternating between Government and Opposition for much of the remainder of the century.

===Modern office===
The office was first officially recognised by an Act of Parliament in 1933, when a special allowance was conferred on the holder.

With the introduction of the mixed-member proportional (MMP) voting system, first used in the 1996 general election, the nature of parliamentary opposition has changed. Now, though the leader of the largest non-Government party still becomes the leader of the Opposition, there will usually be several parties who are &quot;in opposition&quot;. An example of this arose after the 2002 general election, when the National Party gained only 27 seats – less than half the 58 seats held by opposition parties. This prompted calls from a number of parties, notably New Zealand First and the Greens, for the abolition or reform of the post. It was argued by these parties that the position had become an &quot;anachronism&quot; in the modern multi-party environment, and that the days of a united opposition bloc were gone. However, with the revival of the National Party in the 2005 general election, a more traditional relationship between Government and Opposition has been restored. According to Parliamentary Services, the leader of the Opposition formally represents and speaks for all parties that are outside Government.

<doc id="711319" wikidata="Q938692" url="?curid=711319" title="Welcome swallow">
<text>The welcome swallow (Hirundo neoxena) is a small passerine bird in the swallow family Hirundinidae that is native to Australia and nearby islands. It has self-introduced into New Zealand in the middle of the twentieth century. It is very similar to the Pacific swallow with which it is often considered conspecific.

This species breeds in southern and eastern Australia in a variety of habitats, mostly in open areas, man-made clearings or urban environments, but not desert or dense forest. Eastern populations are largely migratory, wintering in northern Australia. Western birds and those in New Zealand are mainly sedentary.

==Taxonomy==
The welcome swallow was first described in 1842 by John Gould in his &quot;The Birds of Australia&quot; as a member of the genus &quot;Hirundo&quot;, but the first publication is often incorrectly given as in the &quot;Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London&quot;. Both its species name and common name refer to people welcoming its return as a herald of spring in southern parts of Australia.

==Description==
The welcome swallow is a small fast-flying bird. Its flying style is circular in pattern with swift darting motions. It has graceful shape and flight, moreover it often flies singly, in couples or in clusters. The welcome swallow is metallic blue-black above, light grey below on the breast and belly, and rusty on the forehead, throat and upper breast. It has a long forked tail, with a row of white spots on the individual feathers. These birds are about long, including the outer tail feathers which are slightly shorter in the female. The welcome swallow&#x27;s weight is about 9-20g. From the Gould collection in Tasmania a “natural size” male had a wing size of , tail size of , and a culmen of . While the female has wings, a tail, and a culmen of . The call is a mixture of twittering and soft warbling notes, and a sharp whistle in alarm. However, their call is normally quiet and does not travel very far.

Young welcome swallows are buffy white, instead of rufous, on the forehead and throat, and have shorter tail streamers.

==Distribution and habitat==
The winter range in northern Australia overlaps with that of wintering barn swallow (&quot;Hirundo rustica&quot;), but the latter is readily separable by its blue breast band. Welcome swallows readily breed close to human habitation. Welcome swallows are commonly found on wires, posts and other perches.

=== Natural global range ===
Welcome swallows have a very large distributional range because they are a cross-regional species. Welcome swallows live mostly in eastern, western, southern and central Australia. The welcome swallows that live in eastern Australia move to northern Australia in winter. The welcome swallows that live in Western Australia and others that live in New Zealand are mostly not migratory. This swallow species has been observed nesting in the majority of New Zealand and its surrounding islands, Australia and some parts of Tasmania. Currently, this species has been recorded in New Guinea, New Caledonia and other surrounding islands. The distribution of the welcome swallow also depends on seasonal change. During the winter, the welcome swallow in Australia will move towards the north which places it closer to the equator and warm weather. For the following spring, they will return to southern Australia to breed.

=== New Zealand range ===
The welcome swallow is a self-introduced species from Australia that is believed to have flown over to New Zealand in the early 1900s. The welcome swallow is found throughout most parts of New Zealand, but it is very rare in Fiordland. The shape of New Zealand is narrow and long, which helped the birds to easily get to areas near water. They are also on Chatham and Kermadec Islands and in some instances have been seen on Campbell Island, Auckland Island and the Snares.

=== Habitat preferences ===
Although welcome swallows are more often near coastal and wetland areas, they can live in almost all types of habitat, except alpine areas and very dense forest. They have been documented in open areas such as farmlands, grasslands, partly cleared areas that are wooded, lands associated with bodies of water such as lakes or reservoirs, and along coastlines. This species is well-adapted for urban and suburban life as well; it is even able to live in high altitude areas due to the provision of nesting materials provided by humans. During winter, welcome swallows move to a warmer habitat which can provide them enough food and safe shelter.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===

Once the welcome swallow reaches maturity it has a long breeding period. They have a monogamous social structure and a breeding period that lasts from August until March. The nest is an open cup of mud and grass, made by both sexes, and is attached to a structure, such as a vertical rock wall or building. It is lined with feathers and fur, and three to five eggs are laid. Two broods are often raised in a season. The nest size ranges from 5 centimetres to 13.5 centimetres. One particular study showed that the nests that were the highest tended to have a higher fledgling success rate possibly due to the inability of mammals to access the nests. Nesting sites can be a variety of areas and have been documented to be from urban and suburban areas to rural areas. Buildings, moveable boats and ferries, hollowed-out trees, caves and cliffs, mine tunnels and shafts, as well as underground water tanks have all been observed areas of nesting swallows. They build the cup-shape nests connecting to vertical rock walls or buildings to avoid sunlight. Nests on average take 8–23 days to build, and are often re-used for consecutive years of breeding. Welcome swallows often go back to their old nests for the next year to breed. They always work as a flock. When breeding, they usually work in pairs but often small loose groups to protect their nest and territory, especially against predatory birds. The number of successful broods can vary year to year; however, the maximum number of broods recorded is three. Each brood or clutch can range from two to seven eggs with an average of four. However, during the beginning of a breeding season, clutch sizes have been known to be bigger, whereas towards the end of the breeding season clutch sizes may be smaller. Eggs are generally laid in twenty-four- to forty-eight-hour intervals; however, one nest can have multiple clutches because the parent pair may abandon a nest if the clutch size is too small and then another pair will lay their eggs within that same nest. Eggs are generally 18 mm in length and 13mm in width with a pink colour and brown speckles. Male welcome swallows do not participate in the incubation of the eggs. Rather they forage while the female incubates, and when the female forages they either watch the nest for a short period or accompany the female in foraging.The female alone incubates the eggs, which hatch after two to three weeks. The young are fed by both parents, and leave the nest after a further two to three weeks. Males have been known to remove fecal sacs after coaxing the cloaca of the young to dispose of them as well. The fledglings stay in the nest from 18 to 23 days and become completely independent around 35 days. However, they don&#x27;t start breeding until 8 months to 14 months of age. Although welcome swallows are monogamous, more than just the breeding pair may take care of the young. Also, many swallows may live within the nest like during non-breeding periods where colonies will roost together in large numbers. Welcome swallows are good indicators of temperature, as the temperature drops lower, the less likely a swallow will be observed in the South. When swallows are around, the temperature usually does not drop below -2/-3 degree Celsius. Migration may occur during non-breeding seasons for larger more reliable food sources. These distances may be quite large as well during winter when food is not readily available. Individuals in this species have been known to live up to 6 years creating up to three broods a year during the breeding season.

===Food and feeding===
These birds are extremely agile fliers, which feed on insects while in flight. They often fly fast and low to the ground on open fields in large circles or figure eight patterns. They will often swoop around animals or people in the open. Males and females tend to forage together during breeding season even with fledglings within the nest. Welcome swallows do show a habit of drinking water while flying, they do this by scooping water within their bills from lake and pond surfaces. This is because welcome swallows need to drink water frequently, which allows them to catch insects in the water as well. Welcome swallows can also cooperate with other birds or companions to drive the insects together. They can remember the insects’ activity routines to make foraging more efficient.

It has been found welcome swallows have slow growing wings that are not affected by food intake unless they are starving. This suggests that the welcome swallow prioritizes wing growth even when fasting for up to six hours at a time. It is also believed that the swallow accumulates fat in order to survive time periods when food is scarce or conditions are bad. This method allows rapid growth when conditions are good and stable growth when conditions are bad.

==Predators, parasites and diseases==
The hawk, snake and feral cat are the main predators that hunt welcome swallows. Especially in Australia, snakes are the most dangerous predator for the birds. Snakes can climb trees to reach the nests and eat the eggs or young birds. According to one New Zealand study, the only time a nest failed was from disturbing the nest during the incubation period; these instances were from humans, mammals such as mustelids, and blackbirds preying upon the eggs. In swallows&#x27; excreta, there are various kinds of bacteria and parasites, which breed in the nest and cause very severe diseases; for example, histoplasmosis, encephalitis, salmonella, meningitis and toxoplasmosis. Hatchlings depend on maternal antibodies and immunity provided by the yolk sac within the egg. Although no specific parasites were found, welcome swallows are known as colonial breeders and are at a high risk for parasites, which may be a cause of lower breeding success but an increase in immune responsiveness. Another disease that not only affects the poultry business, but also the welcome swallow is fowlpox. This virus has two forms, cutaneous (mild harm) and diphtheritic (deadly); poultry is usually vaccinated for the virus, but wildlife is not.

<text>Boost is a set of libraries for the C++ programming language that provides support for tasks and structures such as linear algebra, pseudorandom number generation, multithreading, image processing, regular expressions, and unit testing. It contains 164 individual libraries (as of version 1.76).

All of the Boost libraries are licensed under the Boost Software License, designed to allow Boost to be used with both free and proprietary software projects. Many of Boost&#x27;s founders are on the C++ standards committee, and several Boost libraries have been accepted for incorporation into the C++ Technical Report 1, the C++11 standard (e.g. smart pointers, thread, regex, random, ratio, tuple) and the C++17 standard (e.g. filesystem, any, optional, variant, string_view).

The Boost community emerged around 1998, when the first version of the standard was released. It has grown continuously since then and now plays a big role in the standardization of C++. Even though there is no formal relationship between the Boost community and the standardization committee, some of the developers are active in both groups. 

== Design ==
The libraries are aimed at a wide range of C++ users and application domains. They range from general-purpose libraries like the smart pointer library, to operating system abstractions like &quot;Boost FileSystem&quot;, to libraries primarily aimed at other library developers and advanced C++ users, like the template metaprogramming (MPL) and domain-specific language (DSL) creation (Proto).

In order to ensure efficiency and flexibility, Boost makes extensive use of templates. Boost has been a source of extensive work and research into generic programming and metaprogramming in C++.

Most Boost libraries are header based, consisting of inline functions and templates, and as such do not need to be built in advance of their use. Some Boost libraries coexist as independent libraries.

== Associated people ==
The original founders of Boost that are still active in the community includes David Abrahams. An author of several books on C++, Nicolai Josuttis, contributed to the Boost array library in 2001. There are mailing lists devoted to Boost library use and library development, active .

== License ==
Boost is licensed under its own free, open-source license, known as the Boost Software License. It is a permissive license in the style of the BSD license and the MIT license, but without requiring attribution for redistribution in binary form. The license has been OSI-approved since February 2008 and is considered a free software license, compatible with the GNU General Public License, by the Free Software Foundation.

<text>Temperature play is a form of BDSM sensual play where objects and substances are used to stimulate the body&#x27;s neuroreceptors for heat and cold for sensual effect. Substances used can include water, molten wax, ice, hot oil, chocolate syrup, whipped cream, melted butter, chilled fresh fruit and steamed vegetables. Objects can include sex toys, cutlery, ball chains and necklaces, often pre-heated in hot water or chilled in ice water. Space heaters, radiators, and other sources of heat can also be used for stimulating sensory arousal with heat. Blindfolds may be used to intensify the sensations.

Safety precautions include first aid certification, having a fire safety kit on hand including flame-retardant fire blankets, burn creams, wet towels and fire extinguishers. Regular candles are discouraged over massage candles for safety.

According to a 2022 systematic review, tolerance to heat pain appears higher in BDSM participants, particularly submissives.

==Variants of temperature play==
===Fire play===
Fire play is a form of temperature play that involves using flame on or very close to the skin. The flame is typically on or applied with a small cotton torch soaked in a isopropyl alcohol as fuel, also known as a &quot;fire wand&quot;. Other common fire play toys include flaming gloves and flaming floggers; other common varieties of fuel include 70% isopropyl alcohol, mousse, hand sanitizer, super-proof rum, grain alcohol, and flash cotton. As with many forms of BDSM play, the proper tools, fuels, and safety guidelines are often in hot contention between players.

Fire play is usually considered a form of edge play - frequently exciting, but with significant dangers. The sensations inflicted in most fire play scenes aren&#x27;t painful (much like hot wax play or sensation play). Fire play also rarely leaves marks on the skin - though some people deliberately burn the skin slightly to leave it red and irritated.

====Bouncing/Streaking====
The two most common fire play techniques are bouncing and streaking. In bouncing, lit fire wands (sometimes called batons; essentially a small torch) are bounced along the skin. This may or may not involve transfer of burning fuel.

In streaking, fuel is applied directly to the skin (commonly in straight lines, though sometimes in more elaborate patterns), lit, and then extinguished before the skin begins to burn. Frequently the fuel is applied to the skin with unlit fire wands, then ignited with a lit fire wand (sometimes double-headed wands or two wands are used to streamline the procedure).

====Fire cupping====
Fire cupping is where the air inside a cup (almost always glass) is heated then placed on the skin - the cooling air creates a low-pressure pocket that pulls the skin partially into the cup. Experienced cuppers can create varying strengths of suction by controlling the heat of the cup.

Fire cupping was appropriated from traditional and holistic medicine communities. Cupping was used in Western medicine to encourage blood movement as recently as the American Civil War. It is still used (often with the same name) by masseurs and in Chinese medicine (where it is said to have predated traditional needle acupuncture) as well as in traditional Arab medicine. For this reason, cupping sets can be found in some Asian stores. Some merchants will only sell sets to licensed massage therapists.

Methods include:
* Wiping alcohol directly on the skin, igniting it, and then quickly placing the cup over the area (frequently criticized as having a higher risk of burning the skin and greater difficulty creating/controlling suction);
* Holding the cup over an open flame until it is warm and then applying it to cool skin (some people feel this is the safest - though some feel that heating the glass (rather than the air) causes room for additional danger. This is also the hardest method for beginners wishing to create a strong suction);
* Placing small disks with cotton balls soaked in alcohol on them onto the skin. The cotton is then ignited and a cup is placed over the disk. (In theory, the leather shield protects the skin, but the method is sometimes criticized as too complicated and more likely to burn the skin when performed inexpertly.)
* Applying fuel directly inside the cup - the cup is then usually put on the skin with the fuel still burning (the flame will quickly extinguish from want of oxygen).

Fire cupping typically leaves small, round marks on the body that may last for hours or for days. If a single area is cupped again and again, a deep bruise may form and not disappear for some time.

Fire cupping is often combined with blood play, and is then usually termed blood- or wet-cupping. (This variant also comes from traditional medicine). The skin is pierced (commonly with needles or scalpels) before the cups are applied; the suction then draws blood out of the wound.

===Ice play===
Ice play is a form of temperature play that usually involves running pieces of ice across a person&#x27;s naked skin. In popular culture this form of cold temperature play is frequently shown as foreplay to suggest sex with a flair of kink/interest but which may not be classed as BDSM - see movies such as &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;, and &quot;9½ Weeks&quot;. In BDSM, it&#x27;s not uncommon for ice play to be used more elaborately. Ice is sometimes used as an insertable (for the vagina, anus, and occasionally for the male urethra), but this is risky because ice, as it melts, can form edges sharp enough to cut skin or tender tissues. Part or all of the body may be immersed in ice or ice water for short periods of time (longer periods of time run the risk of hypothermia and frostbite). Ice may be used to provide contrast in a scene that also involves warm or hot stimuli.

===Cold and heat exposure===
Exposure to heat and cold conditions is often employed. These are usually extremes of either of these, not usually experienced on an everyday basis.

One of the simplest ways to engage in cold and heat exposure is with metal and glass sex toys that are built to withstand temperature play. These toys can either be placed in the fridge for cold exposure or inside a sex toy warming pouch for heat exposure.

A common and easily employed type of cold torture is to make subjects stand or lay naked in snow. This can be either freely or tied up. Where a subject is tied, it may be in a stretched or splayed out position to expose as much of the body to the extreme condition. A variant of cold exposure is to water down a subject with cold water in cold or windy conditions or employing fans. The risks of cold exposure are hypothermia and frostbite.

Common methods of heat torture are to wrap a subject in plastic wrap, blankets, or leather or PVC bodysuits, usually with their legs together and their arms next to their body. Other methods include physical activity in severe heat or sun exposure. Lesser used methods employ heaters, fire or coals (known as roasting) for direct exposure to extreme heat. Other physical tortures such as electric shock are sometimes applied at the same time to make the subject exert themselves in order to generate more body heat. The main risk of heat exposure is dehydration but under extreme conditions heatstroke can also occur.

With both heat and cold exposure, other torture methods are sometimes applied at the same time. General heat and cold exposure may be used as foreplay, during which intercourse occurs or orgasm is induced.

<text>Lola Rodríguez de Tió (September 14, 1843 – November 10, 1924) was the first Puerto Rican-born woman poet to establish herself a reputation as a great poet throughout all of Latin America. A believer in women&#x27;s rights, she was also committed to the abolition of slavery and the independence of Puerto Rico.

== Early years ==
Rodríguez de Tió was born Dolores Rodríguez de Astudillo y Ponce de León in San Germán, Puerto Rico. Her father, Sebastián Rodríguez de Astudillo, was one of the founding members of the Ilustre Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico (literally, &quot;Illustrious College of Attorneys,&quot; the governing body for Spanish attorneys in Puerto Rico, similar to a bar association). Lola&#x27;s mother, Carmen Ponce de León, was a descendant of Juan Ponce de León, who was an explorer, and the first Spanish Governor of Puerto Rico. She too was a native of the town of San Germán and lived at what is now known as Casa de los Ponce de León. Rodríguez de Tió received her education at home where she was home-tutored. She developed a lifelong love for literature, especially for the works of Fray Luis de León which were to serve her as a source of inspiration. She was very assertive in her early years, at the age of seventeen she demanded to be allowed to wear her hair short, which went against the conventional norm of the time, a personal trademark that she kept through her life.

== Political activist ==
Rodríguez de Tió moved to Mayagüez, with her family. There she met Bonocio Tió Segarra, whom she married in 1863. Rodríguez de Tió became a writer and book importer who often wrote articles in the local press and was as much of an activist against the Spanish regime as was allowed by the government. After marrying Tió, she published her first book of poetry, &quot;Mis Cantos&quot;, which sold the then amazing amount of 2,500 copies.
In 1867 and then again in 1889, Rodríguez de Tió and her husband were banished from Puerto Rico by the Spanish appointed Governors. On their first exile they went to Venezuela and on their second banishment they first moved to New York where she helped José Martí and other Cuban revolutionaries, and later to Cuba, where the couple resided until their respective deaths. Their home became a gathering point for politicians and intellectuals as well as exiled Puerto Ricans. In 1868, inspired by Ramón Emeterio Betances&#x27;s quest for Puerto Rico&#x27;s independence and by the attempted revolution called the Grito de Lares, she wrote the patriotic lyrics to the existing tune of La Borinqueña. In 1901, Rodríguez de Tió founded and was elected member to the Cuban Academy of Arts and Letters. She was also an inspector of the local school system. She was well known in Cuba for her patriotic poetry about Puerto Rico and Cuba. Some of Rodríguez de Tió&#x27;s best known works are &quot;&quot;Cuba y Puerto Rico son...&quot; (Cuba and Puerto Rico are..) and &quot;Mi Libro de Cuba&quot;&quot; (My Book about Cuba).

In 1919, Rodríguez de Tió returned to Puerto Rico where she was honored with a great banquet at the Ateneo Puertorriqueño after she recited her &quot;Cantos a Puerto Rico&quot;. Lola Rodríguez de Tió died on November 10, 1924, and is buried at the Colón Cemetery in Havana, Cuba.

== Legacy ==
It is believed by some that the design and colors of the Puerto Rican Flag, which were adopted in 1954, came from Rodríguez de Tió&#x27;s idea of having the same flag as Cuba with the colors reversed. Puerto Rico has honored Lola&#x27;s memory by naming schools and avenues after her.

On May 29, 2014, The Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico honored 12 illustrious women with plaques in the &quot;La Plaza en Honor a la Mujer Puertorriqueña&quot; (Plaza in Honor of Puerto Rican Women) in San Juan. According to the plaques the 12 women, who by virtue of their merits and legacies, stand out in the history of Puerto Rico. Rodríguez de Tió was among those who were honored.

<doc id="711336" wikidata="Q14709338" url="?curid=711336" title="White River (Oregon)">
<text>The White River is a tributary of the Deschutes River, approximately long, in north-central Oregon in the United States. It drains a scenic mountainous area of the Columbia Plateau on the east side of the Cascade Range southeast of Mount Hood. In the 1840s, a section of the Oregon Trail called the Barlow Road passed through the river corridor. This section of the road is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
The White River originates in the high Cascades in eastern Hood River County, in the Mount Hood National Forest on the southeast flank of Mount Hood. The headwaters are just below White River Glacier in White River Canyon, the steep canyon between Timberline Lodge and Mount Hood Meadows ski areas. It flows southeast, under Oregon Route 35, another southeast then east for before turning east-northeast past Tygh Valley. It enters the Deschutes River from the west approximately southeast of The Dalles.

In its lower course near Tygh Valley in Wasco County, the river plunges over a basalt shelf in White River Falls State Park. The falls were used for hydroelectricity in the surrounding counties from 1910 until the completion of The Dalles Dam on the Columbia River in 1960.

==Wild and Scenic==

In 1988, of the river were designated Wild and Scenic by the United States Congress. Of this, of the river are designated &quot;scenic&quot; and are designated &quot;recreational.&quot; In its resource assessment, the White River plan identified geology, hydrology, botany, habitat, historic resources, recreation, and scenery as being outstandingly remarkable values (ORVs). To qualify as an ORV, each value must be a unique, rare, or exemplary feature that is significant at a regional or national level. The unique geological features include examples of recent volcanic activity, ghost forests, an active fumarole field, and glacial activity.

The river has unique hydrological features, such as its color in late summer and early fall and its isolation from other rivers. During the late summer and early fall, glacial outflow from Mount Hood turns the river milky white due to suspended sediment concentrations. It is hydrologically isolated from other river systems, which provides an environment where unique species can evolve.

Because of the diverse environments that the White River flows through, as well as its isolation from other rivers, there are a wide variety of life zones within its corridor. Many sensitive and unique plant species are found only in this area, including a genetically unique population of Columbia River redband trout.

==Recreation==

The White River offers opportunities for a wide variety of recreational activities, including whitewater kayaking, Nordic skiing, photography, camping, fishing, hiking, and wildlife watching. The lower river is rated class III (intermediate), the upper river is III - IV (intermediate to advanced), and Celestial Gorge at flood is rated VI (extreme/exploratory).

Many fly fishermen who fish the lower Deschutes River watch the White River. On hot early summer days the glacial meltoff can cause the Deschutes to become unfishable.

<doc id="711342" wikidata="Q6508539" url="?curid=711342" title="Leader of the Opposition (India)">
<text>The Leaders of the Opposition of India (IAST: ) are the politicians who lead the official opposition in either House of the Parliament of India. The Leader of the Opposition is the parliamentary chairperson of the largest political party in their respective legislative chamber that is not in government.

While the position also existed in former Central Legislative Assembly of British India, and holders of it there included Motilal Nehru, it received statutory recognition through the &quot;Salary and Allowances of Leaders of Opposition in Parliament Act, 1977&quot; which defines the term &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; as that member of the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha who, for the time being, is the Leader of that House of the Party in Opposition to the Government having the greatest numerical strength and recognised, as such, by the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha or the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.

== Recognition of the Post ==
As per the Salary and Allowances of Leaders of Opposition in Parliament Act, 1977 by which the post has got official and statutory status, the majority required is decided by the heads of the houses, that is speaker and chairman as the case may be. Clause 4 of The Central Vigilance Commission Act, 2003, provides for the leader of the largest opposition party to be inducted as a member of the selection committee in a scenario where the lower house of parliament does not have a recognized leader of the opposition.

The post is often misunderstood to be given only to the party in the opposition with at least of the numerical strength of the house, however there is no such rule as recognizing a member of the house as leader of opposition is a statutory decision. In the 1950s the Speaker of the House started the practice of recognizing parliamentary parties as ‘parties’ and ‘groups’ for the allotment of seats in the house, time for participating in the debates, rooms in Parliament House etc. 

For this purpose direction 121(c) was issued which laid down the recognition of a party or group in Lok Sabha as having “at least a strength equal to the quorum fixed to constitute a sitting of the House, that is one-tenth of the total number of members of the House”. The direction only mentions criteria for the recognition of a party or group and not of the leader of the opposition.

== Deputy Leader of the Opposition == 
The second chairperson for official opposition party in the house is called Deputy Leader of Opposition The Deputy Leader of the Opposition also holds the role of a shadow minister. This is not an official or constitutional post, however still exists to bring political stability and strength to the Opposition party in Government.

<doc id="711344" wikidata="Q8883" url="?curid=711344" title="1998 Venezuelan presidential election">
<text>Presidential elections were held in Venezuela on 6 December 1998. The main candidates were Hugo Chávez, a career military officer who led a coup d&#x27;état against then-president Carlos Andrés Pérez in 1992; and former Carabobo Governor Henrique Salas Römer. Both candidates represented newly formed parties, a first in a country where the main candidates always represented the parties of the bipartisanship. Chávez represented the Fifth Republic Movement (MVR), while Salas Römer represented Project Venezuela. Initially weak in the polls, Chávez ran on an anti-corruption and anti-poverty platform, condemning the two major parties that had dominated Venezuelan politics since 1958; and began to gain ground in the polls after the previous front runners faded. Despite the fact that the major parties (Copei and Democratic Action) endorsed Salas Römer, Chávez was elected into his first term as President of Venezuela.

A political realignment, the result meant the end of the bipartisanship that had dominated the political atmosphere of the country in the last 40 years, and the beginning of the dominance of the new MVR party (later merged into the United Socialist Party of Venezuela) under the Bolivarian Revolution system that still holds political power in Venezuela as of 03 2025.

== Background ==
In the early 1990s the Venezuelan government&#x27;s economic strength and political legitimacy was declining, with two coup attempts in 1992 and the impeachment for corruption of President Carlos Andrés Pérez. The result was a turn against the traditional Puntofijo Pact parties (Democratic Action and Copei) in the 1993 elections: Rafael Caldera&#x27;s victory in 1993 was the first time in Venezuela&#x27;s democratic history that a President had been elected without the support of either of the two major parties. It was symptomatic that Caldera&#x27;s election platform included pardoning those who had participated in the coup attempts, and he did so in 1994. Hugo Chávez, imprisoned for his role in the February 1992 coup attempt, was among those released.

By 1998, the economic crisis had grown even worse. Per capita GDP was at the same level as 1963, down a third from its 1978 peak; the purchasing power of the average salary was a third of its 1978 level.

For a number of years after his 1994 release from prison, Chávez maintained a position against participation in elections, believing them a fixed game which merely legitimated the established order. This led to a split with his colleague Francisco Arias Cárdenas, who left the MBR-200. In the early years after his release, Chávez considered the possibility of another coup attempt, but with the prospects appearing slim, some advisers, notably Luis Miquilena, urged him to reconsider his scepticism of the elections, arguing that Chávez could potentially win so convincingly that the establishment would not be able to deny him victory. To find out whether this was the case, Chávez set up teams of psychologists, sociologists, university professors and students to carry out a survey. With their support, grassroots members of the Bolivarian movement polled tens of thousands of people across the country. The results showed that 70% of respondents supported Chávez running for the presidency – and 57% said they would vote for him. Support for the electoral route was strengthened when Arias Cárdenas, as a candidate for Radical Cause, won the Governorship of Zulia State in the December 1995 regional elections. Despite this, the MBR-200 remained divided over electoral participation, and spent a year debating the issue in local, regional and national assemblies. A national congress on 19 April 1997 took from 9 am until 2 am the next day to reach a conclusion, ultimately deciding to launch Chávez&#x27; candidacy. Some members of the movement resigned in protest, holding too much at stake. In July 1997 Chávez registered the new Fifth Republic Movement with the National Electoral Council (the name had to be changed as Venezuelan law did not permit parties to use Simón Bolívar&#x27;s name). The international media took little interest, citing opinion polls showing 8% support for Chávez.

==Electoral process==
The 1998 elections were the first to be carried out with a non-partisan National Electoral Council. Traditionally poll workers had been provided by the parties, but in this election &quot;a lottery was set up to draft 300,000 registered voters as poll workers&quot;. The elections also saw &quot;the world&#x27;s first automated voting system, which featured a single integrated electronic network that was supposed to transmit the results from the polling stations to central headquarters within minutes.&quot; Whilst Venezuela had traditionally provided election observers to other Latin American countries, the uncertainty of the new system and the possibility of handover to a non-traditional party raised the stakes in terms of demonstrating that the elections would be fair, and Venezuela invited international election observers for the first time. The Organization of American States, European Union, Carter Center and International Republican Institute all sent delegations.

The automated vote system enabled the Electoral Council to announce the results within 2.5 hours of the polls closing. After corroborating the results with the Carter Center, the losing candidate conceded several hours later.

==Campaign==
The campaign was dominated by independent candidates, as the electorate completed the turn against the establishment parties begun in 1993. In the final poll of the year in December 1997 Irene Sáez, a former beauty queen (Miss Universe 1981) and mayor of the Caracas district of Chacao, reached almost 70% as an independent candidate. However, despite spending millions of dollars on publicity, she fell below 15% within six months, as the public became increasingly sceptical of her readiness for the presidency, and as she lost credibility as an anti-establishment candidate after accepting the endorsement of COPEI. The other early leading candidate, the former Democratic Action leader Claudio Fermín, reached 35% in December 1997, but fell to 6% by April 1998.

During 1998, it then became increasingly clear that the campaign was a race between Salas Römer and Chávez. Salas Römer, the governor of Carabobo and leader of the new Project Venezuela party, appeared a credible candidate as Sáez lost ground, and reached 21% in the polls in August 1998. However at the same time, Chávez&#x27;s own campaign gained ground as he established himself with the electorate. From around 5% in September 1997 to over 10% in late February 1998, Chávez registered 30% in polls taken in May 1998; by August he was registering 39%.

The Chávez platform comprised three basic pledges. First to begin his presidency by abolishing Venezuela&#x27;s old &quot;puntofijismo&quot; political system of two-party patronage, and opening up political power to independent and third parties. Second, to end corruption. Third, to eradicate poverty in Venezuela. In working to gain the trust of voters, Chávez drafted an agenda that drew heavily on his interpretation of Bolivarianism. Chávez also utilized his charisma and flamboyant public speaking style—noted for its abundance of colloquialisms and ribald manner—on the campaign trail to help win the trust and favor of a primarily poor and working class following. On one occasion, he threatened to &quot;fry&quot; the heads of his opponents.

The two traditional main parties hoped that 8 November parliamentary and regional elections would give them a boost, a month ahead of 8 December presidential elections, but the poll remained a two-horse race. At this point polls generally showed Chávez with a 6–12-point lead over Salas Römer&#x27;s approximately 38% poll numbers, though in some polls he exceeded that margin. Both COPEI and Democratic Action now sought to endorse Salas Römer (he was reluctant to accept). COPEI persuaded its candidate (Sáez) to resign, but Democratic Action&#x27;s candidate, Alfaro Ucero, refused to do so, triggering an electoral crisis as the National Electoral Council had to rule on whether the Democratic Action ballot slot belonged to the party or the candidate. Salas Römer agreed to accept the endorsement of COPEI and Democratic Action regional and local parties, and sought to maintain a distance to the parties&#x27; national leadership. In the end, it was not enough, and Chávez won a substantial majority, and won 17 of 23 states.

==Reactions==
===Domestic===
Following his victory, Chávez promised that he would not devalue the bolivar and that currency controls would not be created. Salas Römer reacted to the results stating &quot;I not only accept the victory of my adversary but wish him luck, lots of luck, because his luck will be that of Venezuela&quot;. Some Chávez supporters reacted to his election by saying that they would accept an authoritarian government under Chávez if he decided to utilize such form of government.

===International===
The United States reacted cautiously, with American Ambassador John Maisto stating that &quot;With respect to what we know about Mr. Chavez&#x27;s platform, we will have to see what his policies are, in fact, and see whom he will appoint to key positions&quot;.

<doc id="711352" wikidata="Q881159" url="?curid=711352" title="Blair Betts">
<text>Blair Betts (born February 16, 1980) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre who played nine seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Calgary Flames, New York Rangers, and Philadelphia Flyers. Betts was born in Edmonton, Alberta, but grew up in Sherwood Park, Alberta.

==Playing career==
Betts was drafted by the Calgary Flames in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft in the second round, 33rd overall.

During the 2006–07 season, Betts found success on the Rangers checking fourth line. He was mostly paired with Colton Orr and Ryan Hollweg. Betts was also a key factor on the penalty kill. He was one of the Rangers most consistent faceoff men with 52.3 percent of faceoffs won. He was first on the team with 1,186 faceoffs taken. He was also sixth on the team, first among forwards, with 98 blocked shots and led the team with 276 minutes and 42 seconds of short-handed time on the ice. In the 2008–09 season, Betts served as one of the Rangers&#x27; alternate captains while Scott Gomez was injured.

TSN hockey analyst Pierre McGuire declared Betts &quot;the most underrated player in the league&quot;.

After becoming a free agent, Betts was invited to the 2009 Philadelphia Flyers training camp. The Flyers signed him to a one-year contract on October 1, 2009. The Flyers later signed Betts to a two-year contract extension on February 12, 2010. On October 5, 2011, The Montreal Canadiens picked Betts up off waivers from the Flyers. However, on October 9, 2011, the Montreal Canadiens cancelled the waiver claim on Betts and returned him to the Philadelphia Flyers, as he had failed his physical. Betts missed the entire season and subsequently retired after the season.

<doc id="711359" wikidata="Q645528" url="?curid=711359" title="Northern red bishop">
<text>The northern red bishop or orange bishop (Euplectes franciscanus) is a small passerine bird in the family Ploceidae. It is part of the largest genus in the family with over 60 different species. Its sister species is the Southern red bishop (&quot;Euplectes orix&quot;). This species is most recognizable by the bright reddish orange with contrasting black plumage displayed by the breeding male. It is most common throughout the northern African continent but has also been introduced to areas in the western hemisphere.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The northern red bishop was first described by Paul Erdmann Isert in 1789 in Accra, Ghana. &quot;Euplectes&quot; directly translates to “good weaver,” while &quot;franciscanus&quot; relates to the Franciscans, a religious order from the 12th century that symbolized the crimson color.

The northern red bishop was previously a subspecies of its neighboring species, the southern red bishop (&quot;Euplectes orix&quot;). Today, these two are classified as separate, distinct species; separated by the equator, the northern red bishop inhabits the northern continent of Africa, while the southern red bishop resides in the south. Molecular phylogenetic data in 2007 supported these two species as having a sister relationship. The northern red bishop is easily distinguished by the male&#x27;s continuous red chin.

Its closest relative, aside from the southern red bishop, is the black bishop (&quot;Euplectes gierowii&quot;), native to sub-Saharan Africa. There are to-date no known described subspecies of the northern red bishop. There have been speculations of the bird being part of a superspecies with the southern red bishop (&quot;Euplectes orix&quot;) and Zanzibar red bishop (&quot;Euplectes nigroventris&quot;), but molecular data does not support this claim.

==Description==
This short-tailed bishop is small in size, about 11 cm and weighing about 12-22 grams. The striking red-orange feathers are produced by pigments derived from compounds in their diet. Specifically, the yellow, orange, and red pigments originate from compounds called carotenoids, which are very diet-dependent. Lutein and two red fractions (R1 and R2) derived from lutein are the two dominating carotenoids that contribute to the bird&#x27;s pigment in the wild. Northern red bishops held in captivity lack the R2 red fraction carotenoid from their diet. This plumage is present on the backside of the male and wraps around the chin to back of the head, throat, and breast, with a dark black crown, forehead, flank, and belly. The tail and upper wings are brown, with pale legs and a black bill.

This plumage, the identifier of the northern red bishops, is only present in the breeding males. Females and non-breeding males have a dilute brown and white feather pattern, similar to that of a song sparrow. Males entering breeding season transition into this bright and brilliant plumage, and eventually they molt these display feathers at the end of the breeding season to acquire the plumage close to that of the females.

==Distribution and habitat==

The northern red bishop has a wide distribution across northern Africa. This species inhabits northern Liberia, southern Mauritania, Senegambia, Guinea, north Sierra Leone, east Eritrea, Ethiopia, northwest and southern Somalia, northeast Democratic Republic of the Congo, North Uganda, Burkina Faso, northern Ivory Coast, South Chad, North Cameroon, Sudan, Tanzania, and Kenya. Northern red bishops generally reside in tall grasslands or cultivated areas near water and marshes. This species has been observed in lowlands to elevations as high as 1000 meters.

This species was introduced to Puerto Rico in the 1960s, and has since been reported throughout the West Indies. The northern red bishop has been reported in Martinique, Guadeloupe, Barbados, Jamaica, and St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, along with recorded occurrences in Cuba. In recent decades, the northern red bishop were introduced to areas of the United States, including southern California, Texas, and Hawaii. In 1997, the estimated population size of northern red bishops in Los Angeles and Orange counties reached 400, although this number has likely declined in recent years due to a loss of marshland habitat. A small population also resides in Harris County, TX. 

==Behaviour and ecology==

=== Breeding ===
This species is sexually dimorphic and polygynous, with the males being particularly larger than the females. The genus &quot;Euplectes&quot; is notorious for sexually selected characteristics, including elaborate displays and elongated tail feathers. The bright orange-to-yellow plumage with a contrasting dark black pigment is for attracting mates. The song pattern of the male during the breeding season is quite monotonous with minimal change from season-to-season, and males may not even sing at all in the nonbreeding season. Experiments into the neural relationship between song and plumage color revealed the hyperstriatum ventralis (HVc) and the robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA) are neural structures involved in song control. Possibly due to higher androgen levels at the time, both the HVc and RA significantly increase in volume during the breeding season. Additionally, the sizes of these structures are significantly different between the sexes, with a male having a RA more than twenty times larger than the female. The ratio of sexual dimorphism in these structures are higher than that in other songbirds.

This species is polygynous, and males will often mate with up to six females, Males use their plumage for display-flight to attract females, while puffing their body plumage out. Once a female lands, courtship follows, resulting in males building globular nests for their mate. The females in turn line the nest for her future chicks. The most striking males that build the best nests and have a higher quality territory (higher food resources) tend to have higher reproductive success, meaning there is strong sexual selection on the males to have the most vibrant plumage and to build nests in high-quality territory. Females therefore provide all of the parental care for their offspring, including incubating and feeding. Males neither care nor forage for their offspring.

Nests are generally made from multiple grasses and reeds placed within the marshy vegetation. The average clutch size in Africa is unknown, but in South Africa, the related southern red bishop averages between 2 and 3 eggs per clutch. The nestling period can last about 14-16 days. Breeding seasons can range from starting as early as May to ending as late as November and last between 2 and 6 months, depending on the beginning and end of the rainy season (typically November-March).

Additionally, clutch sizes of northern red bishops in California average between 2–3. Breeding season in this area ranges from around the peak high temperatures in August to November once temperatures begin to cool.

=== Food and feeding ===
This species tends to feed mostly on grass seeds, but they are also known to eat insects. Notable grasses the northern red bishop feeds on include &quot;Echinochloa&quot;, &quot;Cortaderia&quot;, and &quot;Paspalum dilatatum&quot;. Millet seeds are said to be favored. They have also been known to feed on aquatic vegetation (&quot;Polygonum&quot;) and cocklebur (&quot;Xanthium&quot;). In the late winter and springtime, these birds have been seen visiting seed feeders. They usually forage on the ground or within grass and weed stems, and they can hunt insects both in flight and on the ground.

Northern red bishops tend to form large flocks in the nonbreeding season and may be seen with other canaries or waxbills.

== Threats to survival ==
Little is known about this species&#x27; predators. Its closest relative, the southern red bishop, builds nests within reed beds near water, providing coverage from possible nearby predators.

== Relationship to humans ==
Over the past couple of centuries, many people have collected and introduced the species to other areas of the world, including the United States (California and Texas) and the Caribbean (Cuba). Each area has established populations of the species and continue to inhabit these areas There is lacking information about the prevalence of northern red bishops in culture, though they may occasionally be raised in captivity and are known to visit seed feeders in nearby areas they inhabit. In some regions of Africa, they can be regarded as pests to crops, damaging rice, sugar cane, millet, and maize.

== Status ==
According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the northern red bishop is vastly widespread across the globe, stable, and of least concern of endangerment. There is no current quantified population size of this species.

<text>Highmark Stadium (also known colloquially as The Ralph) is a stadium in Orchard Park, New York, United States, in the Southtowns of the Buffalo metropolitan area. It is the home venue of the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL). The stadium opened in 1973 as Rich Stadium. It was known as Ralph Wilson Stadium from 1998 to 2015, New Era Field from 2016 to 2019, and Bills Stadium in 2020.

==History==
===Stadium development===
An original franchise of the American Football League (AFL) in 1960, the Buffalo Bills played their first 13 seasons at War Memorial Stadium, a multi-use WPA project stadium that opened in 1938, located on Buffalo&#x27;s East Side. While suitable for AFL play in the 1960s, the &quot;Rockpile&quot; (as the stadium came to be nicknamed), was in disrepair and with a capacity of under 47,000, undersized for a National Football League (NFL) team. The league mandate instituted after the AFL–NFL merger of 1970 dictated a minimum of 50,000 seats.

In early 1971, owner Ralph Wilson was exploring options to relocate the team, possibly to Seattle, with other cities such as Memphis and Tampa soon expressing interest as well. The potential loss of the team hastened the stadium project and Rich Stadium opened in 1973. The location and construction of the stadium in Erie County were the source of years of litigation, which ended with a financial settlement for a developer who had planned to erect a domed stadium in Lancaster. However, plans changed because it was not wanted to be close to Lancaster High School. The stadium was ultimately built by Frank Schoenle and his construction company. Bonds were approved by the county legislature in September 1971.

===Naming rights===

In 1972, Rich Products, a Buffalo-based food products company, signed a 25-year, $1.5 million deal ($60,000 per year), by which the venue would be called &quot;Rich Stadium&quot;; one of the earliest examples of the sale of naming rights in North American sports. (The name was somewhat of a compromise, after Bills owner and founder Ralph Wilson rejected the name Rich wanted to use, &quot;Coffee Rich Park.&quot;) By a vote of 16–4, the county legislature approved the name in November 1972, despite a matching offer from Wilson to name it &quot;Buffalo Bills Stadium.&quot;

When the Bills organization regularly referred to the stadium without the &quot;Rich&quot; name, Rich Products brought a $7.5 million lawsuit against the team in 1976. After the original deal expired after a quarter century in 1998, the stadium was renamed in honor of Wilson. Rich Products balked at paying a greatly increased rights fee, which would have brought the price up to par with other NFL stadiums.

On August 13, 2016, Buffalo-based New Era Cap Company and the Bills reached a seven-year, $35 million agreement for stadium naming rights. The Bills and New Era officially announced the stadium&#x27;s new name of New Era Field five days later, on August 18, 2016.

On July 15, 2020, the Bills announced that New Era Cap asked to be released from their naming rights and sponsorship deal, and the two sides agreed on terms to terminate the contract. The statement referred to the venue only as &quot;the stadium&quot;, and the Bills&#x27; website scrubbed all references to New Era. Under the terms of the 2012 lease agreement, in addition to Erie County having to approve any new stadium name as the stadium&#x27;s legal owners, the government of the state of New York would also have a veto; the clause was inserted to quash ambush marketing attempts. Under this clause, Erie County executive Mark Poloncarz rejected a naming rights bid by minitoilet maker Tushy Bidets, saying that any name that &quot;embarrasses the community&quot; would not even be considered regardless of the size of the bid. Signs bearing the &quot;New Era Field&quot; name were removed beginning July 24. On August 20, the team announced they would temporarily use the name Bills Stadium until they found a new naming-rights partner.

On March 29, 2021, the team announced that the stadium’s new name would be Highmark Stadium after reaching a 10-year agreement with Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of Western New York.

===Stadium records and facts===
The first NFL playoff game at the stadium came in the 1988 season, a 17–10 Bills victory over the Houston Oilers on January 1, 1989. The Bills won every ensuing playoff game at the stadium until they were defeated on December 28, 1996 by the Jacksonville Jaguars. They would not lose another playoff game at the stadium until January 22, 2023, when they lost 27–10 in the AFC Divisional Round against the Cincinnati Bengals.

The Bills have defeated each of the 31 other teams there at least once and are unbeaten there against three teams: the Arizona Cardinals (5–0), Green Bay Packers (7–0), and Tampa Bay Buccaneers (3–0).

===Design and renovation===

The stadium is open-air, with a capacity of 71,870. It has never had a natural grass surface; AstroTurf was installed in the stadium upon its opening in 1973. The first renovation occurred in 1984 when the stadium&#x27;s capacity was increased to 80,290 with the addition of 16 executive suites.

Eight years later in 1992, 24 more executive suites were added. In 1994, major renovations were made to the stadium including the addition of the Red Zone and Goal Line clubs that are enclosed in glass and have 500 seats. These renovations also added 14 executive suites. A massive $9.1 million (inflation adjusted) Sony JumboTron video scoreboard was a major update in 1994 and was the largest in the U.S. at the time. In 1998, $57 million were spent to refit the stadium with larger seats and more luxury and club seating as a part of the Bills lease renewal with Erie County. This caused the seating capacity to be reduced to just under 74,000.

In the 2003 offseason, the original style turf was replaced with a newer AstroTurf product, AstroTurf GameDay Grass (also known as AstroPlay). The lease agreement also stipulated Erie County would continue to upgrade the stadium; in the summer of 2007, a new HD Mitsubishi LED board measuring was installed and replaced the 13-year-old Sony Jumbotron. Over of Mitsubishi Diamond Vision LED Ribbon Boards were also installed in the interior during that renovation. The total cost for the 2007 project was $5.2 million, In 2011, the Bills changed their turf to a new product, A-Turf Titan, produced by a Western New York company. As of the 2023 season, Buffalo is the only NFL stadium using the A-Turf Titan product.

On December 21, 2012, the lease negotiations between the Bills, Erie County, and the state of New York ended with the Bills signing a ten-year lease to stay in Buffalo until 2023. The agreement included $130 million in improvements to New Era Field. Renovations included new larger entrance gates, larger HD sponsor boards added to each side of the video scoreboard, two new HD video boards, larger LED sponsor board added on the tunnel end of the stadium, expanded concessions, new team store, and redesign of areas and lots just outside the entrance gates. In addition, a life-sized statue of team founder Ralph Wilson was posthumously added to a new area outside the team store called &quot;Founder&#x27;s Plaza&quot; in 2015.

Buffalo, by virtue of its position downwind of Lake Erie, is one of the nation&#x27;s windiest cities, and as a result, Highmark Stadium is difficult for kickers, with swirling winds that change direction rapidly. This is exacerbated by the stadium&#x27;s design. The field is below ground level, while the top of the upper deck stands only above ground. The open end lies parallel to the direction of the prevailing winds, so when the winds come in, they immediately drop down into the bowl, causing the stadium&#x27;s signature wind patterns.
===Seating capacity===
==Other uses==

===Other sporting events===

The size of the field at Highmark Stadium is specifically designed for National Football League dimensions and sight lines, along with football and team markings being formed permanently into the turf, making it extremely difficult for other outdoor sporting events such as soccer, baseball, track and field, or rugby to be held there. None of any significance have ever been held at the stadium.

The stadium annually hosts the region&#x27;s Section VI and Monsignor Martin Athletic Association high school football playoffs.

On July 14, 1984, the stadium hosted a one-time-only supercross motorcycle racing event.

The opening ceremony of the 1993 Summer Universiade was held at the stadium.

====College football====
Syracuse University played two home games at the stadium in 1979. Syracuse was left without an on-campus home for one season between the demolition of Archbold Stadium and the construction of the Carrier Dome on its footprint.

The stadium hosted a Black Friday contest between the UB Bulls and the Bowling Green Falcons in 2013.

Adjacent to the stadium is 1,800-seat West Herr Stadium, the home field for Erie Community College&#x27;s football team.
====Ice hockey====
On January 1, 2008, the Buffalo Sabres hosted the Pittsburgh Penguins in the first NHL Winter Classic. The Penguins won 2–1 in a shootout in front of 71,217. On December 29, 2017, the stadium hosted a match between the U.S. and Canada at the 2018 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships being hosted by Buffalo.
===Concerts===
Nearly 30 concerts have been held at the stadium, starting in 1974 with Eric Clapton and The Band.

Several bands have played the stadium multiple times, including The Rolling Stones, who played there in 1975, 1978, 1981, 1997, and 2015.

The Grateful Dead played the stadium a 5 times including 7/4/86, 7/4/89, 7/16/90, 6/6/92, and 6/13/93 with their July 4, 1989 &quot;Truckin&#x27; Up to Buffalo&quot; performance being documented on Vinyl, CD, and DVD.

The Who, Dave Matthews Band, and The Jackson Five have all played at the stadium multiple times as well.

Double and multi-billed concerts have also been scheduled at the stadium.

There were notable large concerts that were scheduled to take place at the stadium but were later canceled. Led Zeppelin was set to perform at the stadium on their 1977 North American Tour. The concert was one of the seven remaining concerts on the tour that were canceled due to the death of lead singer Robert Plant&#x27;s son. A Bruce Springsteen concert, that was originally scheduled at the stadium in 2003, was moved to the smaller Darien Lake Performing Arts Center due to low ticket sales.

Concert appearances began to wane in the 1990s at the stadium, which ended with Dave Matthews Band and NSYNC each playing a concert in June 2001, with no more concerts at the stadium for 14 years. This was due to the combination of a declining number of stadium rock acts, population decline, and the availability of other, more intimate, venues in Western New York such as Artpark in Lewiston, Darien Lake Performing Arts Center in Corfu, the Thursday at the Square series among others, Seneca Niagara Casino, and the KeyBank Center, which opened in 1996, replacing Buffalo Memorial Auditorium in downtown Buffalo.

===Non-sporting or music events===
The stadium has also hosted the Drum Corps International championships three times.

Autocross racing events are held in one of the stadium&#x27;s parking lots during the spring, summer, and fall months. The local WNY SCCA Chapter hosts the autocrosses.

==Future==
The Buffalo Bills will begin play in a new stadium adjacent to the current one by 2026.

Although new stadium ideas had been proposed before the death of Ralph Wilson, with the new ownership of Terry and Kim Pegula, the prospect of a new stadium has been raised again. During his press conference to acquire the team, Terry Pegula stated, &quot;we will gradually proceed to plan and design a stadium for the Buffalo Bills.&quot;

On June 18, 2021, the Pegulas chose Legends Global Planning to represent ownership, consult on a new stadium and sell sponsorships and premium seats for the venue. In addition, an unnamed source claimed that the Bills are planning to build a new stadium in Orchard Park to replace Highmark Stadium, with two of the television stations in Rochester, New York reporting the unnamed source&#x27;s claims as fact. Under the claimed plan, the project is expected to take three to five years to complete, with a possibility to be ready by 2025. The Bills may be forced to use an alternate site while the team waits for the project to be completed, with relocating to Beaver Stadium in State College, Pennsylvania and/or reviving the Bills Toronto Series being options during the construction. Neither the Bills nor any official entity in Erie County has verified or denied the claims.

On March 28, 2022, New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced that a deal had been reached between New York State, Erie County, and the Bills for a 62,000-seat, $1.4 billion dollar stadium in Orchard Park. It will be built across the street from Highmark Stadium adjacent to Erie Community College’s south campus, and is expected to open in 2026. On June 5, 2023, during a groundbreaking ceremony, the Bills announced that Highmark&#x27;s naming rights would transfer to the new venue, which will also be named Highmark Stadium.

==Alleged curse==

Since the Bills moved from War Memorial Stadium into their current home, it has been noted that the team has not won a championship since, and has had frequent periods of heartbreak, including four Super Bowl losses in a row. Several writers have owed this to the fact that the stadium is built just yards away from a family cemetery as part of territory once owned by the Sheldon Family. A plaque just outside the stadium at gates 6-7 graces the cemetery and also notes that the stadium was built on the site of an ancient Wenro village.

<text>Zachary Bierk (born September 17, 1976) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. He played in 47 NHL games with the Tampa Bay Lightning, Minnesota Wild, and Phoenix Coyotes between 1997 and 2004. He most recently was the goaltending coach with the Ottawa Senators, and is now a scout with the team.

==Junior career==
Bierk was born in Peterborough, Ontario. He spent four years with the Peterborough Petes of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) from 1993–94 to 1996–97. In the 1995–96 season, Bierk led the Petes to the Memorial Cup final, where they were defeated by the Granby Prédateurs 4–0 in the final. The following season, Bierk won the OHL goaltender of the year award, the Leo Lalonde trophy as the best over-age player in the league and was named to the OHL All-Star First Team and Canadian Hockey League All-Star Second Team.

==Professional career==
Bierk was drafted by the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League (NHL) in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft as their ninth-round pick, 212th overall, from the Peterborough Petes, although he originally expected to be drafted in the fourth or fifth round, and left the draft after he had not been selected by the end of the sixth round. His first victory came on March 30, 1998 in only his second career start, a 3–1 win in New York against the Rangers.

On January 8, 2003, while playing for the Phoenix Coyotes Bierk and Chicago Blackhawks goaltender Michael Leighton both earned their first NHL shutouts in a 0–0 tie. It was the first time in league history that two goalies had both earned their first career shutouts in the same game.

His final NHL appearance came on November 9, 2003, in a 2–1 overtime loss to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. Bierk finished his career with 47 game appearances, a 9–20–5 record, a 3.18 GAA and a 0.901 save percentage with 1 shutout. Bierk also had one assist and six penalty minutes.

==Post-playing career==
After retiring, Bierk served as one of the instructors at the goaltending school, Team Shutout. Bierk joined the Oshawa Generals of the OHL in June 2013 as their goalie consultant, replacing Michael Lawrence. Bierk won a Memorial Cup with the Generals in 2015.

Bierk returned to the Coyotes organization in 2018 as the team&#x27;s goaltending development coach, also serving as the goalie coach of their AHL farm club, the Tucson Roadrunners. On April 6, 2021, Bierk was hired as the goaltending coach for the Ottawa Senators. Bierk had many connections to the Senators prior to joining the organization. He and Senators&#x27; head coach D. J. Smith were both coaches with the Generals during their 2015 Memorial Cup win. Furthermore, with the Coyotes Bierk worked under Brian Daccord, the father of then-Senators&#x27; goaltender Joey Daccord. In January 2024, Bierk was replaced as goaltending coach by Justin Peters and assigned scouting duties.

Bierk also co-owns and runs a high-level goaltending school in the Greater Toronto Area, known as Armour Goaltending.

==Personal life==
Bierk is the brother of former Skid Row lead singer Sebastian Bach and the son of David Bierk, an artist whose paintings are still displayed at the Nancy Hoffman Gallery in New York City.

<text>Last-call return, automatic recall, or (on PBX and centrex service) camp-on, is a telecommunication feature offered by telephony service providers to subscribers to provide the subscriber with the telephone number, and sometimes the time, of the last caller. The service may also offer the facility to place a call to the calling party.

The general public tends to refer to the service by the telephone feature code, the telephone number it has in their country; for example, in North America, this is &quot;*69&quot;, while in the UK, it is called &quot;1471&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Call Return in 1992 as a new service. It can be paid for per-call or subscribed to monthly.

==Feature code==
The number for this facility varies with country and provider:
* United States and Canada: Vertical service code *69; 1169 on rotary phone/pulse dial telephones. The prompt voice behind most U.S. AT&amp;T implementations of this feature is Pat Fleet. Where available, it is offered on a per-call charge (typically 50¢) or an unlimited-use monthly subscription for a few dollars. 
* Australia: *10# for Telstra services or *69 on Optus HFC Telephony network. This only allows one to return the last unanswered call, and can cost 35 cents per use.
* France: 3131
* Israel: *42
* Japan: 1361 to get number, 1363 to call back.
* United Kingdom: 1471 (also used in Gibraltar, Ireland, Isle of Man, Channel Islands, and the Falkland Islands)

In the UK, after dialing 1471, the caller can press &quot;3&quot; to automatically return the call. Previously free, since August 2004 the return call service incurs a charge.

The service provider may also offer a facility by which the calling party can prevent their number being revealed to the called party, either permanently or on a per-call basis. This is achieved by prefixing the dialed number with:
* Australia: 1831 on landlines and mobile phones, or #31# from a mobile
* United Kingdom, Ireland, Isle of Man, and Channel Islands: 141 on landlines and #31# on mobiles 
* United States: *67
* Sweden: #31#

Conversely, to send the caller number on a line where the number is normally withheld, the following prefixes can be dialed:
* Australia: 1832 on landlines, or *31# from a mobile
* Ireland: 142
* United Kingdom: 1470 (also used in Gibraltar and the Channel Islands)
* United States: *82
* Philippines *999
In Gibraltar and formerly in Ireland, ex-directory or unlisted numbers are withheld by default.

In Germany, most contemporary telephones have a specific button functioning as call return, which is an internal function of the telephone itself (the number of the last caller is stored inside the phone at the time of that last call) and thus doesn&#x27;t have a numeric code.

In Canada, the feature is commonly marketed by telephone companies as a combination of two features:
* Call again, a form of automatic ring back, allows a caller, on reaching a busy signal, to hang up, dial a special code, and be called back automatically when the called number is no longer busy, usually with a limit of 30 minutes.
* Call return allows a customer to dial a code that identifies the last incoming call. On some types of central office equipment, it announces the number and offers the call-back option; on others, it simply attempts a connection without an announcement.

<text>Robert M. Love (born c. 1981) is an American author, speaker, Google engineer, and open source software developer.

Love is best known for his contributions to the Linux kernel, with notable work including the preemptive kernel, process scheduler, kernel event layer, virtual memory subsystem, and inotify. At Google, he was a member of the Android team and helped launch the first version of the platform. Love is also active in the GNOME community, working on NetworkManager, GNOME Volume Manager, Project Utopia and Beagle.

== Biography ==
Love was born in 1981 in south Florida. He attended and graduated from Charles W. Flanagan High School. For his undergraduate studies, he attended the University of Florida, where he graduated with both a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

While still in college, Love was employed as a kernel hacker at MontaVista Software. At MontaVista, he worked on procps and several kernel-related projects, including one of his most notable, the preemptive kernel.

Love began work at Ximian on December 15, 2003, where he first served as Senior Engineer in the Linux Desktop Group. At Ximian, he spearheaded an effort, named Project Utopia, to better integrate hardware management into the Linux desktop. After Ximian&#x27;s acquisition by Novell, Love rose to the position of Chief Architect of SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop. At Novell, he worked on various kernel and GNOME projects, including inotify and Beagle.

Love resigned from Novell on May 4, 2007, to work at Google on their mobile device platform, Android. Joining the project before it was announced, he engineered several kernel and system-level solutions for Android, including its novel shared memory subsystem, ashmem. Love worked at Google as Director of Engineering for Search Infrastructure through May 2021. Love now works as VP of Engineering at Toast where he builds cloud platforms for restaurants.

Love lives in Boston, Massachusetts.

== Writing and speaking ==
Love is the author of &quot;Linux Kernel Development&quot;, now in its third edition, a book on understanding and developing code for the Linux kernel. The book is widely regarded as approachable and well written and has been translated into several languages. All three editions are published by imprints of Pearson Education.

He also wrote &quot;Linux System Programming&quot;, now in its second edition, subtitled &quot;Talking Directly to the Kernel and C Library&quot;, and published by O&#x27;Reilly Media. This work documents Linux&#x27;s system call and C library API.

Love is also a coauthor of &quot;Linux in a Nutshell&quot;, a comprehensive Linux command reference also published by O&#x27;Reilly Media. &quot;Linux in a Nutshell&quot; was awarded &quot;Favorite Linux Book of All Time&quot; by Linux Journal.

Love is Contributing Editor for Linux Journal and author of articles for the magazine.

Love has been invited to speak around the world, including linux.conf.au in Australia, FOSDEM in Belgium, and GUADEC in England, where he was a keynote speaker.

<doc id="711402" wikidata="Q1052112" url="?curid=711402" title="Shut Down Volume 2">
<text>Shut Down Volume 2 is the fifth album by the American rock band the Beach Boys, released March 2, 1964 on Capitol Records. Produced by Brian Wilson, it is the follow-up to the band&#x27;s &quot;Little Deuce Coupe&quot;, released the previous October, and to &quot;Shut Down&quot;, a Capitol compilation album. &quot;Shut Down Volume 2&quot; was the first of three studio albums that the band released in 1964, and the first recorded without guitarist David Marks, who departed from the band following disagreements with manager Murry Wilson. The album reached number 13 in the US during a chart stay of 38 weeks.

==Rediscovered master tapes==
The multi-tracks for &quot;Shut Down Volume 2&quot; went missing shortly after the album&#x27;s release. In 2009, three reels of session outtakes were unexpectedly retrieved with the help of biographer Jon Stebbins, thanks to a fan who had found and kept the tapes untouched for years. New stereophonic mixes were created by producers Mark Linett and Alan Boyd for the compilation &quot;Summer Love Songs&quot;, which includes an alternate version of &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; featuring a never-before-heard unused intro section as well as a new stereo mix of &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry Baby&quot;.

With these reels, new stereo mixes of &quot;Fun, Fun, Fun&quot;, &quot;The Warmth of the Sun&quot; and &quot;Pom Pom Play Girl&quot; were also created in 2013; the first two of these three appearing along with the aforementioned remixed songs on the &quot;Made in California&quot; box set, and all five remixes surfacing on the 2014 compilation &quot;Keep an Eye on Summer – The Beach Boys Sessions 1964&quot;, which featured select session highlights from these reels.
