<text>Joseph Vance (March 21, 1786 – August 24, 1852) was a Whig politician from the U.S. state of Ohio. He served as the 13th governor of Ohio and was the first Whig to hold this position.

Elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1820, Vance served seven terms before losing a bid for an eighth term in 1834. Vance ran for governor in 1836 and served a single two-year term, losing a bid for re-election in 1838.

He intended to retire but was elected to the Ohio State Senate, and served in the Senate from 1840 to 1841. Vance ran again for the House of Representatives in 1842 and served two more terms in the House. He did not run for re-election in 1846. Vance was a delegate to the 1848 Whig National Convention and was a member of the Ohio State Constitutional Convention in 1851.

<text>Kalmah is a Finnish melodic death metal band from Pudasjärvi that formed in 1998. In less than a year after its formation, Kalmah was signed by Spinefarm Records. The word &quot;kalmah&quot; is Karelian and could be translated as &quot;to the grave&quot; or &quot;to the death&quot;.

==History==

In 1991, Pekka Kokko and Petri Sankala founded the metal band Ancestor. After Ancestor had recorded two demos, Antti Kokko joined the band as lead guitarist. In 1998, after five demos, Ancestor disbanded and Kalmah formed. The new band consisted of Pekka Kokko performing vocals and guitar, Antti Kokko on lead guitar, Pasi Hiltula on keyboards, Altti Veteläinen on bass, and Petri Sankala on drums.

Kalmah began to write songs for a promotional CD entitled &quot;Svieri Obraza&quot;. With this demo, they acquired a recording contract with Spinefarm Records and headed to Tico-Tico Studios to record their debut album, &quot;Swamplord&quot; which was released in 2000.

By November 2001, they returned to Tico-Tico Studios to record their second studio album, &quot;They Will Return&quot;. By this time, Veteläinen and Sankala were replaced by Timo Lehtinen on bass and Janne Kusmin on drums, respectively. In 2002, Kalmah played shows in Finland and at Wacken Open Air. In February 2003, they recorded their third studio album, &quot;Swampsong&quot;. In 2004, keyboardist Pasi Hiltula left and was replaced by Marco Sneck. The band released &quot;The Black Waltz&quot; in 2006 and &quot;For the Revolution&quot; in 2008. Kalmah toured in Canada and Finland to promote the latter album.

===&quot;12 Gauge&quot;===

Kalmah&#x27;s sixth studio album was released in Japan on 24 February 2010, Canada on 2 March, Europe on 3 March and North America on 6 April.

Recording and mixing took place from May to August at Tico-Tico Studios in Finland, and mastering for the disc took place at the Cutting Room in Sweden.

The track &quot;Bullets Are Blind&quot; was released in December 2009 on a two-CD collection included with the 35th anniversary issue of &quot;Soundi&quot; magazine.

In March 2010, &quot;12 Gauge&quot; became the first Kalmah album to be released on vinyl. The album was mastered for vinyl by Joona Lukala, Noise for Fiction, and released by Svart Records in a limited run of 500 copies.

===&quot;Seventh Swamphony&quot;===

In 2012, Kalmah finished filming a new music video for their upcoming album, due to be released in 2013. The band have kept fans up to date with their process via social networking website Facebook by uploading different photos, as well as a short behind the scenes video from the day of filming their video. They also announced that they currently have six songs finished, and they plan to enter the studio in January 2013.

The artwork for their seventh studio album will be created by artist Juha Vuorma, the man also behind the art of Kalmah&#x27;s first 3 albums.

In April 2013, it was announced that the band will release their seventh studio album, &quot;Seventh Swamphony&quot;, on 17 June.

===&quot;Palo&quot;===
Kalmah&#x27;s eighth album, &quot;Palo&quot;, was released on 6 April 2018. A single from the album, &quot;Evil Kin&quot; was released on 9 February 2018.

===&quot;Kalmah&quot;===
In March 2023, the band announced their self-titled ninth album would be released on 26 May.

== Musical style ==
The band&#x27;s musical style is primarily classified as melodic death metal with their sound including strong influences of power metal, thrash metal and black metal. Musically, the band has been compared to fellow Finnish metal acts Children of Bodom, Norther and Wintersun.

<text>Li Lisan (; 18 November 1899 – 22 June 1967) was a Chinese politician, member of the Politburo, and later a member of the Central Committee.

== Early years ==
Li was born in Liling, Hunan province in China in 1899, under the name of Li Rongzhi. His father, a teacher, taught Li Chinese traditional poems and classics. In 1915, he arrived at Changsha for high school and saw an advertisement in a newspaper written by a student from First Normal School of Changsha with the pen name 28 Strokes. Li met and then became friends with the young man, whose real name was Mao Zedong. Later, Li joined the army of a local warlord in Hunan. One of the Division Commanders, Cheng Qian, who was both Li&#x27;s father&#x27;s townsman and alumni, sponsored Li to study in Beijing.

==Beginning career==

===France===
When Li reached Beijing, he applied to study in France and arrived there in 1920. He worked part-time as an assistant to a boilermaker to earn his tuition. His boss was a member of Communist Party and Li was influenced in accepting communism, taking part actively in the struggles for Chinese labour rights in France. For his active and fearless revolutionary work, Li was labelled as a trouble-maker. In 1921, Li was expelled along with more than 100 other Chinese by the French authorities.

=== Back in China ===
When Li returned to Shanghai, he was introduced by Chen Duxiu to join the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The party assigned him to organising labour activities in Anyuan Coal Mine (安源煤矿) in Pingxiang, Jiangxi. Being the most important labour work leader there, Li greatly increased the number of CCP members and perfected methods of organisation. By the end of 1924, there were only 900 CCP members throughout China, 300 of whom came from Anyuan Coal Mine. It was at this time that Li showed his great talent in labour work and organisation in conjunction with Liu Shaoqi, who later became his deputy.

The Nationalists had a high opinion of Li&#x27;s organisational skills; a secret report prepared during their rural pacification campaign in 1928 explained why they were having particular difficulties in Anyuan:The reason the Communist Party has such a deeply rooted and firm foundation at Anyuan is because in the past the Communists carried out comprehensive &#x27;red education&#x27; at Anyuan. Six or seven years ago, the Anyuan workers were all country bumpkins…Not one of them could stand up at a meeting and say a word, let alone deliver a speech. Still less had any of them ever heard of organising anything. It was only after the Communist bandit Li Lisan went to Anyuan…that the knowledge of how to organise became widespread. Now workers were speaking up at public meetings and even giving lectures! The Communists at Anyuan greatly valued education but they did not mechanically evangelise Communism like a missionary cramming a religious belief into a worker&#x27;s head. At first they focused on literacy and basic knowledge. Every week they convened lectures as well as workers&#x27; debate societies and study groups.

In 1926, Li came to Wuhan, the labour work center of China to lead the labour work. Although Xiang Zhongfa, who later became general secretary of the CCP, was the top leader at that time, Li was the man who actually made the decisions. In 1927, after the split of the alliance between the Kuomintang (KMT) with the CCP, Li was the first one to propose the Nanchang Uprising against the KMT and took the job as director of the security guards. Although the uprising proved to be imprudent and poorly planned, and its failure unavoidable, Li was thrust into the central stage of the CCP for his prominence in labour work and his courage under fire.

==Reign of Xiang==

At the 6th National Congress of CCP held in Moscow, Li&#x27;s old friend Xiang Zhongfa was elected as General Secretary with the support from the Comintern and the Soviet Union. During the reign of Xiang, Li Lisan played a gradually more important role. Xiang sacked Cai Hesen, the incumbent standing member of Politburo of the CCP and Minister of Propaganda Department of the CCP for Cai&#x27;s extremist way in directing the Sunzi Division of CCP, which resulted in extreme democracy and discontent at the CCP center. Xiang chose Li to replace Cai. Li became one of only four standing members of the politburo and minister of Propaganda Department of the CCP in October 1928.

When the Far East Bureau of the Comintern issued an order for anti-rightism and blamed the CCP for not being active enough in 1929, Xiang protested the decision. He knew Li was an appropriate candidate for doing the communication work because of his eloquence and energy. Thus, Li took the job of handling conflicts with the Comintern. When Xiang sent Zhou Enlai to Moscow for further instruction, Li took on Zhou&#x27;s work in organisation too, which gave Li a large enough stage to prove his talent.

==Decline==
When Xiang learned of the Comintern&#x27;s decision on anti-rightism, he claimed that the Chinese revolution was in its peak period. Li turned this blindness into extremism, which was later known as Li Lisan line (立三路线), calling for armed uprising in the cities leading by workers and the extension of the revolution to the whole country. 

From June 1930, Li Lisan line became mature under the support from Xiang. The CCP gave the daily operation from its headquarters to divisions in all provinces, setting up action committees in all provinces and preparing for the full-scale uprising in October. But the Comintern expressed its discontent, stating that it was working out systemic policies for the Chinese revolution and that the CCP should concentrate on the uprising in one or several provinces instead. Xiang supported Li and stood by his idea that it was the zero hour of the Chinese revolution. In several rounds of discussion, the tension between Xiang, Li and the Comintern rose greatly. Suspicion and criticism of the CCP towards the Comintern was the same as betrayal in the eyes of the Comintern.

In July 1930, the communist army under the leadership of Li Lisan captured Changsha in Hunan province, but KMT troops defeated his forces just a few days later. Uprisings in other cities were quickly put down by KMT forces. Furthermore, Li had turned many CCP members into enemies with his authoritarian style. Some of these were old CCP members, such as labour activists He Mengxiong and Luo Zhanglong, who were blamed for their rightism only because they were against Li&#x27;s extremism. Wang Ming and his group of 28 Bolsheviks came back from Moscow, designated to take the leadership of the CCP by their mentors in Moscow, but they only received a cold shoulder from Li.

===Doom===
With so many opponents both inside and outside the CCP, Li&#x27;s doom was sealed. The Comintern sent Qu Qiubai and Zhou Enlai back to China to enforce its policy. And the 28 Bolsheviks took advantage of this opportunity to denounce Li. Xiang, and Li still did not realize the clear danger he was in and criticised these young immature students severely. Then Comintern sent a telegram to call Li to Moscow for repentance. Pavel Mif, president of Moscow Sun Yat-sen University and mentor of the 28 Bolsheviks, went to Shanghai as an envoy of the Comintern also. Under Mif&#x27;s direction, the 4th Plenary Meeting of 6th National Congress of the CCP was held. Li was replaced by Mif&#x27;s protégé, Wang Ming, and his associates in the 28 Bolsheviks took other important jobs.

===Punishment===
Li went to Moscow for his confession and repentance. But he did not know it would be such a long time of redemption. In the next 15 years, Li suffered from rounds of reprimand, criticism, and purge. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union even refused to accept Li as a CCP member for several years. Moreover, when Wang Ming and Kang Sheng came back to Moscow as representatives of the CCP to the Comintern, they persecuted Li by every means available. The only comfort was that in the Soviet Union Li met, and later married, a Russian noblewoman and typesetter named Lisa Kishkin (Elizaveta Pavlovna Kishkina; ; , d. 2015), who would later migrate to China with Li.

==Aftermath==
But Li&#x27;s old friend Mao did not forget about him. Li was elected as member of the Central Committee of CCP in the 7th National Congress of the CCP held in Yan&#x27;an. In 1946, Li was sent back to China. Li first came to northeast China to work for the local division of the CCP as Minister of the City Work Department. At the resumption of the Chinese Civil War, Li was appointed as chief representative of the CCP to the military arbitration panel consisting of members from the KMT and the United States.

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===

After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, Li went back to the field of his main expertise, being appointed as Minister of Labour to lead the labour union. Li was dedicated to his old cause and brought forth guidance on democratic management measures in industry, which was later called the Constitution of Anshan Steel Mill by Mao. At the same time, Li Lisan was one of the founders of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference mechanism. During the Korean War, he was appointed as the secretary general of Anti Air Defence Council ranking as vice-premier, due to his WWII anti-air attack experience during his stay in Moscow.

Li remained an advocate for independence of the trade unions, which brought him into conflict with Mao. He was the Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions until 1958 and the first president of China Institute of Industrial Relations.

===Consequences of China-Soviet split===
After the Sino-Soviet split in the 1960s, Li&#x27;s life turned tougher and tougher again. Although his wife, Lisa Kishkin, handed in her Russian passport and took Chinese nationality to show her loyalty to her husband and his country, there still was no way to ease the situation. Especially when the Cultural Revolution came, Kang Sheng spared no effort in denouncing his old rival. Li was labeled an agent of the Soviet Union and was tortured both mentally and physically by the Red Guards. His wife and daughters were also imprisoned.

Supposedly unable to face this humiliation any more, Li was said by his tormentors to have committed suicide by taking sleeping pills after finishing a final letter to Mao. Li&#x27;s biographer, Patrick Lescot, has cast doubt on the nature of Li&#x27;s death.
Li Sishen (), Li Lisan&#x27;s personal secretary, later wrote he did not believe it possible Li Lisan could have had access to sufficient pills to kill himself. Li Sishen had been responsible for overseeing the issuing of the sleeping pills. He recalled arguing with Li Lisan, who wanted an extra pill each night as the struggle sessions were affecting his sleep. Li Lisan dismissed the notion he might kill himself as ridiculous:This is a joke! I&#x27;ve made it through all these decades of strife and turmoil and you think I can&#x27;t get through this? Are you worried I&#x27;ll kill myself? Suicide would mean betraying the Party, I know that well enough; am I going to turn renegade against the Party? It&#x27;s simply laughable.In 1980 the central Organisation Department finally allowed Li Lisan&#x27;s family to read his autopsy report. It listed his height incorrectly by 15 cm and contained other errors which added to the family&#x27;s doubts over the accepted version of Li&#x27;s death. The Central Committee also held a memorial meeting for Li.

In 1983, the Hubei Provincial Committee carried out an investigation on Li&#x27;s suicide. But it was fruitless and his death remains unsolved.

<doc id="702033" wikidata="Q16895704" url="?curid=702033" title="National Personnel Records Center fire">
<text>The National Personnel Records Center fire of 1973, also known as the 1973 National Archives fire, was a fire that occurred at the Military Personnel Records Center (MPRC) in the St. Louis suburb of Overland, Missouri, from July 12–16, 1973.

The fire destroyed some 16 million to 18 million official U.S. military personnel records. The MPRC, the custodian of U.S. military service records, is part of the National Personnel Records Center, an agency of the National Archives and Records Administration of the General Services Administration.

==Background==
The NPRC was created in 1956 through the mergers of predecessor agencies after World War II, including the Demobilized Personnel Records Center (DPRC) and the Military Personnel Records Center (MILPERCEN) of the Department of Defense, along with the St. Louis Federal Records Center of the General Services Administration. In final form, the NPRC handled the service records of people in federal civil service or American military service, overseen by the National Archives and Records Administration of the General Services Administration.

In 1951, the Department of Defense hired the Detroit firm of Hellmuth, Yamasaki, and Leinweber, architects, to design a facility for its Demobilized Personnel Records Center. The firm visited several similar operations, including a U.S. Navy records center at Garden City, New York, and a Department of Defense facility in Alexandria, Virginia, to study their functions and storage systems. Their February 1952 report detailed different approaches, including fire prevention, detection, and suppression systems. The Naval records center, for example, was outfitted with a full fire sprinkler system, while the Department of Defense facility was not. This reflected a debate among archivists and librarians: are documents at greater risk in a facility with sprinklers, which could cause water damage, or in one without sprinklers to guard against fire damage?

Department of Defense officials approved a design plan that omitted sprinklers and heat and smoke detectors. Moreover, each floor had large spaces for records storage stretching hundreds of feet and containing no firewalls or other measures to limit the spread of fire.

Set on a site of , the building had six floors, each measuring and encompassing for a total of . The building was constructed of prestressed concrete floors and roof supported by concrete interior columns and surrounded by a curtain wall of aluminum and glass. Along the north side of each floor were offices, separated from the records storage area by a concrete block wall.

Construction was completed in 1956 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers at a cost of $12.5 million ($ today), an economical $10.15 per square foot ($109.25 per square meter).

When the facility opened in 1956, it housed some 38 million military personnel records.

By the time of the 1973 fire, it held more than 52 million personnel records plus some of military unit records. The center&#x27;s staff had grown past 2,200 personnel, including GSA management and staff as well as military and civilian personnel from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, the Army Reserve, the FBI, and others.

==Fire==
At 12:16:15 a.m. on July 12, 1973, the Olivette Fire Department reported to its dispatcher that the NPRC building was on fire. At 12:16:35, 20 seconds later, a building security guard picked up the fire phone and relayed the report of a passing motorcyclist who also observed the fire. By 12:17:25, the first fire trucks were dispatched: three pumpers and two other emergency vehicles from the Community Fire Protection, arriving at 12:20:35. Forty-two fire districts ultimately helped put out the fire.

Heat and smoke within compelled firefighters to withdraw from the building&#x27;s interior at 3:15 a.m.

The fire burned out of control for 22 hours while firefighters fought from the exterior of the building. Insufficient water pressure plagued efforts and a pumper broke down mechanically in its 40th continuous hour of operation. Crews entered the building again on July 14; the fire smoldered for another two days. The fire was declared out on the morning of July 16, but crews continued using spray to suppress rekindling until the end of the month.

===Cause===
The exact cause of the fire was not fully determined. A custodian admitted in October 1973 that he had been smoking in the file room and stubbed out his cigarette on a shelf, and he assumed the fire started because of his actions. The case was presented to a grand jury, but the custodian was not arrested. Deliberate arson was ruled out as a cause almost immediately by investigators, as interviews of some personnel who had been in the building just 20 minutes before the first fire alarm reported nothing out of the ordinary. In 1974, investigators of the General Services Administration stated that an electrical short was most likely the cause of the fire but that, owing to the near-total destruction of the sixth floor, where the fire had occurred, a specific investigation into the electrical systems was impossible.

==Affected records==

The losses to federal military records collection included:
*80% loss to records of U.S. Army personnel discharged November 1, 1912, to January 1, 1960;
*75% loss to records of U.S. Air Force personnel discharged September 25, 1947, to January 1, 1964, with names alphabetically after Hubbard, James E.;
*Some U.S. Army Reserve personnel who performed their initial active duty for training in the late 1950s but who received final discharge as late as 1964.

None of the records that were destroyed in the fire had duplicate copies made, nor had they been copied to microfilm. No index of these records was made prior to the fire, and millions of records were on loan to the Veterans Administration at the time of the fire. This made it difficult to precisely determine which records were lost.

===Navy and Marine Corps records===
On the morning of the National Archives Fire, a very small number of U.S. Navy, Coast Guard, and Marine Corps records were out of their normal file area, being worked on as active requests by employees of the National Archives and Records Administration who maintained their offices on the 6th floor of the building. When the NPRC fire began, these Navy and Marine Corps records were caught in the section of the building which experienced the most damage in the fire.

The exact number of Navy and Marine Corps records destroyed in the fire is unknown, since such records were being removed only for a few days while information was retrieved from them and were not normally stored in the area of the building that experienced the fire. Estimates indicate that the number of affected records was no more than two to three dozen. Such records are considered &quot;special cases,&quot; and no accounting could be made of which records were affected, so the present policy of NPRC is to state that there were no Navy and Marine Corps records destroyed in the fire and to treat these records as records that had been lost in ordinary circumstances.

The destroyed sixth floor of the NPRC also housed a security vault that contained high-profile and notable records of U.S. Navy and Marine Corps personnel. Known as the &quot;Sixth Floor Vault,&quot; confirmed destroyed records included the Navy file of Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou as well as the record of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s nephew William Patrick Hitler. The sixth-floor security vault also held all the records of current NPRC employees who had their own Navy and Marine Corps records retired at the agency.

==Damage and reconstruction==
The 1973 fire destroyed the entire sixth floor of the National Personnel Records Center and greatly affected the fifth floor with water damage. As part of the reconstruction, the entire sixth floor was removed owing to the extensive damage, resulting in the current structure&#x27;s now consisting of five floors. The rehabilitated building has firewalls to divide the large, open records storage areas. Smoke detection and sprinkler systems have also been added to prevent a repetition of the 1973 fire. Signs of the fire can still be seen today.

A massive effort to restore destroyed service records began in 1974. In most cases where a military record has been presumed destroyed, NPRC is able to reconstruct basic service information, such as military date of entry, date of discharge, character of service, and final rank. Information is still being recovered from burnt files into the 2020s, especially with the aid of infrared cameras that can read blackened paper.

<text>Cadishead is a village in the City of Salford in Greater Manchester, England, with a population of 10,739 in 2014. Within the historic county of Lancashire.

==History==
The earliest record of Cadishead date to 1212, and show that the whole of Cadishead – then called Cadewalesate – was rented from King John by Gilbert Notton for four shillings (20p) a year, a sum equivalent to about £650 today. The name derives from the Old English words &quot;wælla&quot; and &quot;set&quot;, and Cada, a personal name; it means the &quot;dwelling or fold by the stream of a man called Cada&quot;.

Until the early 19th century most of the area was part of the peat bog known as Chat Moss, but by 1805 work had started to reclaim the land. The opening of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894 had a major effect on the subsequent development of Cadishead.

== Governance ==
Cadishead is represented in Westminster by Barbara Keeley MP for Worsley and Eccles South.

=== Councillors ===

Until 2021 the area was represented on Salford City Council by three councillors serving the ward of Cadishead.
 indicates seat up for re-election.

Boundary changes coming in to effect at the 2021 Salford City Council election abolished the Cadishead ward and the Cadishead and Lower Irlam ward was created in its place.

==Location==
Cadishead is between Irlam and Rixton, on Liverpool Road (B5320) next to the Manchester Ship Canal and the M62 motorway, close to the border between Greater Manchester and Warrington.

==Industry==
The Northbank Industrial Park dominates the east of Cadishead and the border with Irlam and supplies many jobs to the local area.

==Notable people==
Ray Lowry was a painter and cartoonist originally from Cadishead. He created the &quot;London Calling&quot; album cover for the Clash.

==Transport==
Cadishead was once served by its own railway station. The station closed in November 1964 as part of the Beeching cuts which affected many railway stations in the UK at the time.

<text>The Byodo-In Temple (, &quot;Byōdōin Tenpuru&quot;) is a non-denominational Buddhist temple located on the island of Oahu in Hawaii in Valley of the Temples Memorial Park. It was dedicated in August 1968 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the first Japanese immigrants to Hawaii. 

The temple is a replica of a 900-year-old Buddhist temple at Uji in Kyoto Prefecture of Japan. Contrary to popular belief, it is not a functioning Buddhist temple in the proper sense as it does not host a resident monastic community nor an active congregation. Inside the Byodo-In Temple is a statue of the Lotus Buddha, a wooden image depicting Amitābha. It is covered in gold and lacquer. Outside is a three-ton, brass peace bell. Surrounding the temple are large koi ponds that cover a total of . Around those ponds are lush Japanese gardens set against a backdrop of towering cliffs of the Koʻolau Range. The gardens are home to sparrows and peafowl. The temple covers .

The Byodo-In Temple is visited and used by thousands of worshipers from around the world. It welcomes people of all faiths to participate in its traditions. Apart from worship, the temple grounds are also used for weddings and office meetings.

==Ancient Japan==
Byodo-In Temple is a smaller-scale replica of the Byōdō-in, a World Heritage Site near the ancient city of Kyoto, originally a monastery founded by Fujiwara no Yorimichi in 1052 of the Heian period. It was famous for its Vairocana statue. The statue was lost and replaced in 1053 with a large wooden statue of Amitābha, a national treasure carved by the Japanese artisan Jōchō.

The Amitābha statue stands in the midst of the , an artistic reproduction of Sukhavati, the pure land of Amitābha. It is called the &quot;Phoenix Hall&quot; in English in reference to the two fenghuang birds stretching their wings upon the temple roof. Fifty-two wooden images of bodhisattvas surround Amitābha, dancing and playing musical instruments on floating clouds.

From 2001 to 2007, the temple underwent restoration in the spirit of preservation of Japan&#x27;s ancient heritage.

==Modern Hawaii==

Byodo-In Temple was commissioned and built largely by concrete (the original is wooden without the use of nails) in 1968 at its present location in the Valley of the Temples to celebrate the centennial anniversary of the arrival of Japanese culture to Hawaii. It was dedicated by Governor John A. Burns, a favorite of the Japanese community for his long service for the cause of Japanese rights during the state&#x27;s territorial years. Japanese immigrants entered the Kingdom of Hawaii and later Territory of Hawaii to labor in the sugarcane and pineapple plantations. They joined the Chinese, Filipino, Korean, native Hawaiians and Portuguese.

==Valley of the Temples Memorial Park==
The Valley of the Temples Memorial Park, where the Byodo-in Temple is located, also contains large Catholic statues depicting the Passion of Christ, the Virgin Mary, various Catholic saints, crypts and mausoleums of some of the most influential people in Hawaiʻi. Most notable of those interred at the mausoleums of the Valley of the Temples is Walter F. Dillingham, Hawaii entrepreneur and statesman. For a time, former Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos was interred at a private mausoleum overlooking the Byodo-In temple. Thousands of Buddhist, Shinto, Protestant and Catholic residents of Hawaii are buried in this memorial park. It was founded by Paul Trousdale in 1963.

==In popular culture==
The TV series &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; and &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; featured several episodes where the temple is incorporated into the plot. The temple and its vicinity also served as a stand-in for South Korea in one episode of the ABC series &quot;Lost&quot; and as the Presidential Villa in an episode of &quot;seaQuest DSV&quot;.

The temple was also used in the 2001 movie &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; as a replica of the Byodo-In Temple in Japan as well as several other movies.

<doc id="702041" wikidata="Q730194" url="?curid=702041" title="John Gorrie">
<text>John B. Gorrie (October 3, 1803 – June 29, 1855) was a Nevisian-born American physician and scientist, credited as the inventor of mechanical refrigeration.

Born on the Island of Nevis in the Leeward Islands of the West Indies to Scottish parents on October 3, 1803, he spent his childhood in South Carolina. He received his medical education at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of the Western District of New York in Fairfield, New York.

In 1833, he moved to Apalachicola, Florida, a port city on the Gulf coast. As well as being resident physician at two hospitals, Gorrie was active in the community. At various times he served as a council member, postmaster, president of the Bank of Pensacola&#x27;s Apalachicola Branch, Secretary of his Masonic Lodge, and one of the founding vestrymen of Trinity Episcopal Church.
Gorrie&#x27;s medical research involved the study of tropical diseases, particularly yellow fever. At the time the theory that bad air — mal-aria — caused diseases was a prevalent hypothesis, and based on this theory, he urged draining the swamps and the cooling of sickrooms. For this he cooled rooms with ice in a basin suspended from the ceiling. Cool air, being heavier, flowed down across the patient and through an opening near the floor.

==Experiments with artificial cooling==
Since it was necessary to transport ice by boat from the northern lakes, Gorrie experimented with making artificial ice.

He first mechanically produced ice in 1844. After 1845, Gorrie gave up his medical practice to pursue refrigeration products. By 1850 he was able to routinely produce ice the size of bricks. On May 6, 1851, Gorrie was granted Patent No. 8080 for a machine to make ice. The original model of this machine and the scientific articles he wrote are at the Smithsonian Institution. In 1835, patents for &quot;Apparatus and means for producing ice and in cooling fluids&quot; had been granted in England and Scotland to American-born inventor Jacob Perkins, who became known as &quot;the father of the refrigerator&quot;. Impoverished, Gorrie sought to raise money to manufacture his machine, but the venture failed when his partner died. Humiliated by criticism, financially ruined, and his health broken, Gorrie died in seclusion on June 29, 1855. He is buried in Magnolia Cemetery.

Another version of Gorrie&#x27;s &quot;cooling system&quot; was used when President James A. Garfield was dying in 1881. Naval engineers built a box filled with cloths that had been soaked in melted ice water. Then by allowing hot air to blow on the cloths it decreased the room temperature by 20 degrees Fahrenheit. The problem with this method was essentially the same problem Gorrie had. It required an enormous amount of ice to keep the room cooled continuously. Yet it was an important event in the history of air conditioning. It proved that Gorrie had the right idea, but was unable to capitalize on it. The first practical refrigeration system in 1854, patented in 1855, was built by James Harrison in Geelong, Australia.

==Monuments and memorials==

*In Apalachicola, Gorrie Square is named in his honor. The square contains his grave site, a monument, and the John Gorrie State Museum.
*The John Gorrie Bridge, across Apalachicola Bay, connects Apalachicola with Eastpoint.
*In 1914, the state of Florida gave a statue of Gorrie by sculptor C. Adrian Pillars to the National Statuary Hall Collection.
*John Gorrie Junior High School, now an apartment building named The John Gorrie, in Jacksonville and John Gorrie Elementary School in Tampa is named in his honor.
*John Gorrie Dog Park at Riverside Park in Jacksonville, Florida opened in the summer of 2016. 
*The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.
*The John Gorrie Award is awarded each year to a graduate of the University of Florida College of Medicine believed to be the &quot;best all-around student showing promise of becoming a practitioner of the highest type.&quot;

<text>Norther was a Finnish melodic death metal band from Espoo which was formed in 1996 and broke up in 2012.

== History ==
Norther formed under the name Requiem (Lindroos, Korpas, Hallio) in 1996 after various early stage band formations. The band&#x27;s debut effort was the album, &quot;Dreams of Endless War&quot;, released through Spinefarm Records in 2002. The album entered the Finnish charts at position 17. At the time, Norther was playing shows only in and around the Helsinki area. That changed when the album &quot;Mirror of Madness&quot; came out in early 2003 (entering the Finnish charts at position 11). The group toured with Dimmu Borgir and Hypocrisy in late 2003. In early 2004, Norther released its third full-length album, &quot;Death Unlimited,&quot; which reached 17 on the Finnish charts.

Norther played several shows in 2005 and then recorded an EP, &quot;Solution7&quot; (recorded at Astia Studio). It landed in the official Finnish charts at position five. Norther added Kristian Ranta&#x27;s vocals afterward. In the summer of 2005, Norther used Studio Fredman in Gothenburg, Sweden, to record their fourth full-length-album named &quot;Till Death Unites Us&quot;, with producers Fredrik Nordström and Patrick J. Sten. Soon after recording the album, Toni Hallio left the band to pursue other interests; Heikki Saari replaced him at drums. After its release in January 2006, &quot;Till Death Unites Us&quot; was number six on the Finnish album charts. Later the same year, the band composed the theme song (&quot;Frozen Angel&quot;) for a major Finnish feature film, &quot;V2: Dead Angel&quot; produced by Solarfilms, Inc. The band is also featured in the film. In February 2007 Norther released a new EP, &quot;No Way Back&quot;, released only in Finland and Japan. The record hit number one in the Finnish charts. Later that year the released &quot;Amoral &amp; Drone&quot;, and supported it with a European tour.

Petri Lindroos quit as lead vocalist on 1 February 2009 and was replaced by Aleksi Sihvonen (ex-Imperanon) on 14 April 2009. To mark his debut, the band released an alternate version of the song &quot;Frozen Angel&quot; from their previous album, with Sihvonen on vocals. Their sixth studio album, &quot;Circle Regenerated&quot;, and was released 19 April 2011.

The band made their final appearance at the Brutal Assault festival in the Czech Republic on 10 August 2012.

<doc id="702047" wikidata="Q888413" url="?curid=702047" title="Duncan McArthur">
<text>Duncan McArthur (1772April 29, 1839) was a military officer and a Federalist and National Republican politician from Ohio. He served as the 11th governor of Ohio.

When first elected to state office as a representative, he was serving in the state militia during the War of 1812. He was later appointed as brigadier general in the U.S. Army. Shortly thereafter he was placed in charge of the Army of the Northwest, serving through 1817 and negotiating the Treaty of Fort Meigs of 1817 to ratify peace and land cessions with Native American tribes.

==Biography==
Sources vary as to McArthur&#x27;s exact birthdate. It has been given as January 14, 1772, or June 14, 1772. He was born to Scottish immigrants in Dutchess County in the Province of New York, McArthur grew up in western Pennsylvania and later moved to Kentucky, where he was employed as an Indian ranger.

McArthur and his friend Alexander McGuffey volunteered in 1790 at Fort Pitt for expeditions against Native Americans during the Northwest Indian War, serving as a scout under Generals Josiah Harmar and Anthony Wayne. McArthur obtained a position with Nathaniel Massie in 1793, and worked with Massie on a surveying expedition in the Northwest Territory. In 1796, he worked with Massie to lay out the new town of Chillicothe, Ohio, which was to become the state capital in 1803. McArthur moved across the Ohio River in 1797 to Chillicothe, where he gained wealth by his land speculations in the Northwest Territory.

==Career in the War of 1812==
McArthur was elected to the United States House of Representatives from Ohio&#x27;s 3rd congressional district while serving in the state militia during the War of 1812. He never qualified for office as he preferred to continue serving in the military.

===Using deception in the First American Invasion of Canada===
He was appointed colonel of Ohio volunteers and was second-in-command to General William Hull at Fort Detroit. In July 1812, General William Hull was at Fort Detroit as the British fortified a defensive position across the Detroit River in Windsor, Ontario. Hull decided to move the British to Fort Malden, further away from Detroit, so that he could seize the defenses in Windsor. To implement his plan, Hull resorted to deception, which began when his troops collected all the boats and canoes they could find. On 11 July 1812, Hull sent some boats down the river to Springwells, south of Detroit, in full view of the British. At the same time, the American regiment commanded by Duncan McArthur marched from Detroit to Springwells, also observed by the British.

With the British now anticipating an American crossing south of Detroit, a second American force moved north in the dark until they reached Bloody Run, a crossing point a mile and a half north of Fort Detroit and opposite the Ontario town of Sandwich. Finding no activity at Springwells, the British believed the Americans had already crossed the river and marched on Fort Malden. Assuming Fort Malden was vulnerable, the British troops in Sandwich marched south, and in the morning the Americans at Bloody Run crossed to Sandwich unopposed. After landing in Sandwich, the Americans then marched from Sandwich to Windsor and seized the British defensive works.

===Duncan McArthur’s deep penetration raid into Thames===
It was July 13, 1812. The American militia and regulars were conducting paramilitary operations in their invasion of Canada. American intelligence claimed they found a group of enemy Indian fighters. American militia commander Duncan McArthur with one hundred American militiamen went in pursuit. The American militia chased the enemy fighters and fell upon their rear. The enemy Indian fighters dispersed into the woods and escaped. Duncan McArthur was about to return, when Captain Smith of the Detroit dragoons overtook him with orders to push forward into enemy territory to the settlements on the Thames in search of provisions. McArthur obeyed and penetrated as far as the Moravian towns, sixty miles from its mouth. There was a house McArthur encountered in his raid in Thames. The owner had fled, but the house was guarded by a file of British soldiers. The group of British soldiers were captured, disarmed, and paroled. McArthur and his militia raiding force seized the boats along the stream and loaded them with enemy supplies they commandeered. On July 17, 1812, McArthur and his militia raiding force returned to an American base camp with about 200 barrels of flour, 400 blankets, and a quite large quantity of military stores. These were chiefly public property, collected for the British troops at Malden and yet American commander Hull gave a receipt for the whole, public and private.

===Engagement at bridge near Fort Malden===
On July 19, 1812. American Colonel Duncan McArthur with a recon force combined with 150 Ohio infantry troops under Colonel Lewis Cass are near the bridge leading to Fort Malden. Two British artillery guns fire on the Americans and take out an American cannon. Cass and his fellow Americans capture two British troops after they cross the bridge. All the Americans withdraw with their prisoners safely.

===Surrender of Detroit===
He and Colonel Lewis Cass were not present at Detroit when Hull surrendered and were greatly angered to hear that Hull had included both of them in the capitulation. When a British officer notified him of the surrender, McArthur is said to have torn off his epaulettes and broke his sword in a fit of rage, although historians note similar stories were told about other officers as well. The British paroled him and McArthur returned to Ohio.

===Enlisting in the U.S. Army===
He was appointed a brigadier general in the U.S. Army. Shortly thereafter he was placed in charge of the Army of the Northwest following Harrison&#x27;s resignation.

===Duncan McArthur’s raid===

Duncan McArthur conducted a cavalry raid deep into Thames Valley. Duncan&#x27;s objective was to devastate the settlement&#x27;s food supplies which was mainly flour. Duncan and 700 riflemen mounted on horses conducted their raid in October. Duncan and his mounted riflemen inflicted massive damage on infrastructure, burned many flour mills, surprised Canadian militia in separate engagements, and took provisions. McArthur&#x27;s mounted riflemen raided multiple population centers. McArthur&#x27;s raiders killed 18 Canadian militiamen, wounded 9 militiamen, and captured 126 Canadian militia soldiers. McArthur avoided contact with the main British army. After completing his raid, McArthur and his mounted riflemen withdrew back to American lines safely. The American raiders suffered only 1 killed and 6 wounded.

==End of War of 1812==
McArthur did not face much action any further, but he was engaged in negotiating treaties with the Indians. In 1817, he was one of two commissioners (along with Lewis Cass) who negotiated the Treaty of Fort Meigs, which was signed September 29 of that year with several Native American tribes.

==Serving in the House of Representatives==
McArthur served intermittently thereafter in the Ohio House of Representatives and Ohio State Senate. He was elected and served a single term from 1823 to 1825 in the United States House of Representatives before winning election to the governorship in 1830. McArthur served a single term and did not seek re-election.

==Death==
McArthur was buried in Grandview Cemetery, Chillicothe, Ross County, Ohio, US. The trust established in his will later became the subject of litigation that went before the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;McArthur v. Scott&quot;.

==Legacy==
The small village of McArthur, Ohio, the seat of Vinton County, is named for him.

McArthur founded the city of Greenfield, Ohio in 1799. Greenfield is located at N39 21.11958 W83 22.96284 (GPS coordinates), about 21 miles due west of Chillicothe. State Route 28, which runs between Greenfield and Chillicothe, in 1973 was named as General Duncan McArthur Highway per act of the 113th Ohio General Assembly.

<text>The Political Graveyard is a website and database that catalogues information on more than 277,000 American political figures and political families, along with other information. The name comes from the website&#x27;s inclusion of burial locations of the deceased (when known).

==History==
The site was created in 1996 by Lawrence Kestenbaum, then an academic specialist at Michigan State University, and later on staff at the University of Michigan.

Kestenbaum was formerly a county commissioner, and in 2004 was elected to be County Clerk/Register of Deeds of Washtenaw County, Michigan. The site and its underlying database were developed from a personal interest triggered by the &quot;Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress&quot;, which was its original data source. Since then his personal research, and the information contributions of hundreds of volunteers, have greatly expanded the information available. It is licensed under the &quot;Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 1.0&quot; Creative Commons License.

Over the years, the definition of &quot;eligible political figure&quot; has been expanded. It now includes most high federal officials, ambassadors, all elected and some appointed statewide officeholders, and many mayors. It lists unsuccessful candidates, presidential electors, and delegates to U.S. presidential nominating conventions of the major political parties.

The database attempts to capture very basic biographical and office-holding data for its political figures. Besides where they are buried, cause of death is broken down into dozens of categories.

Politicians are listed alphabetically, by office held or sought, and by dates and locations of birth, residence, and death. The names are sorted and indexed by surname, birthplace, positions held, demography, geography, religion, occupation, cause of death, and final resting place.

Some are listed in categories, including occupations, ethnicity, religious and organizational affiliation, honors, and awards. &quot;For example, 18 politicians were born into slavery; six have been in space; 69 survived assassination attempts; and 908 were in trouble or disgraced.&quot; An exhaustive cataloging of transgressions are listed by the nature of the accusation, as well as by decade and by state.

It reports their relation (at least by blood and marriage) with other politicians listed, their political party, and limited military history. The site also lists political families. Individuals listed on the site are linked together if their relationship meets the Rule of 1/1000 common ancestry. Each cluster of three or more linked politicians is treated as a family, with family name and location assigned by an algorithm; the largest individual family cluster is the Kennedys, with 34 members. The site&#x27;s largest cluster, with 2,134 members, is called &quot;Four Thousand Related Politicians&quot;, most of the larger families are subsets of this group, with each subset defined and named by an algorithm. The largest subset family is the Huntington-Chapin-Waterman family of Connecticut, with 229 members.

<text>Roberto Rivellino (; born 1 January 1946), known as just Rivellino, is a Brazilian football pundit and former player who was one of the key members of Brazil&#x27;s 1970 FIFA World Cup-winning team.

The son of Italian immigrants from Macchiagodena, Isernia, he played as an attacking midfielder and was famous for his iconic moustache, bending free kicks, long range shooting, accurate long passing, vision, close ball control and dribbling skills. He also perfected a football move called the &quot;flip flap&quot;, famously copied by Romário, Mágico González, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Cristiano Ronaldo in later years. A former attacking midfielder, he is widely regarded as one of the most graceful football players ever, and one of the greatest players of all time. With the close control, feints and ability with his left foot, Diego Maradona named Rivellino among his greatest inspirations growing up. In 2004, he was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world&#x27;s greatest living players.

Rivellino currently works as a pundit for TV Cultura.

==Club career==
Rivellino was born in São Paulo, and started as a futsal player at Clube Atlético Barcelona. After that, he tried his luck with Barcelona&#x27;s biggest rival, Corinthians, where he moved on to professional football and quickly became a favourite of the fans—and was therefore nicknamed &quot;O Rei do Parque&quot; (King of the Park) (after the club&#x27;s home ground, Parque São Jorge). However, the late 60s and early 70s were one of the most troubled periods in the history of the club, which did not win a single São Paulo state league title between 1954 and 1977.
In 1974, after Corinthians was defeated by arch-rivals Palmeiras in the São Paulo league finals, as the star player Rivellino was singled out by most fans as one of the most responsible for not winning. He moved on to Rio de Janeiro, where he defended Fluminense until the end of the 1970s. Rivellino was undoubtedly the greatest star in the excellent Fluminense of the mid 70s, dubbed &quot;the tricolor machine&quot;, among Doval, Pintinho, Gil and Carlos Alberto Torres. He won the Rio de Janeiro league championship in 1975 and 1976. By the end of the decade, he moved on to play for Al Hilal in Saudi Arabia; he retired from professional football in 1981.

==International career==

Rivellino was a key member of Brazil&#x27;s 1970 FIFA World Cup winning team, which is often cited as the greatest-ever World Cup team. Wearing the number 11 jersey, Rivellino was deployed on the left side of midfield and scored three goals, including the powerful bending free-kick against Czechoslovakia, which earned him the nickname &quot;Patada Atómica&quot; (Atomic Kick) by Mexican fans. Rivellino also played in the 1974 and 1978 FIFA World Cups, finishing in fourth and third place respectively.

==After retirement==

After his professional retirement, Rivellino started a career as a football commentator and coach (he has managed Shimizu S-Pulse in Japan&#x27;s J. League). Rivellino further represented Brazil in the 1989 edition of the World Cup of Masters, scoring in the final against Uruguay. Rivellino is sometimes credited with scoring the fastest goal in football history when he supposedly scored a goal direct from the kick-off after noticing the opposition goalkeeper on his knees finishing off pre-match prayers.

Regarding the 2014 FIFA World Cup held in his country, Rivellino criticized the inclusion of the Amazonian city of Manaus with its stadium Arena da Amazônia in the hosting venues, saying &quot;it’s absurd to play in Manaus. You start sweating the moment you leave the locker room&quot;.

<doc id="702076" wikidata="Q2353611" url="?curid=702076" title="Louis Horst">
<text>Louis Horst (born January 12, 1884, Kansas City, Missouri – died January 23, 1964, New York City) was a composer, and pianist. He helped to define the principles of modern dance choreographic technique, most notably the matching of choreography to pre-existing musical structure and the use of contemporary music for dance scores.

==Biography and work==
Horst was the musical director for the Denishawn company (1916-25) before working as musical director and dance composition teacher for Martha Graham&#x27;s school and dance company (1926-48).

One memorable piece of advice that Horst gave dancers in his lessons in the 1930s, at times delivered in a sarcastic tone: &quot;when in doubt, turn.&quot; This is a variant of Ted Shawn&#x27;s famous line &quot;When in doubt, twirl.&quot; The Grateful Dead Almanac adopted it as their motto.

Apart from being a personal friend and mentor to Graham, Horst worked and wrote scores for many other choreographers, including:
* Ruth St. Denis
* Ted Shawn
* Helen Tamiris
* Martha Hill
* Doris Humphrey and Charles Weidman
* Agnes de Mille
* Ruth Page
* Michio Ito
* Adolph Bolm
* Harald Kreutzberg
* Pearl Lang
* Jean Erdman
* Anna Sokolow, Horst&#x27;s assistant and demonstrator

==Career== 
Horst composed scores for the Denishawn company, including &quot;Japanese Spear Dance&quot; (1919). He composed several of Graham&#x27;s early group works: &quot;Primitive Mysteries&quot; (1931), &quot;Celebration&quot; (1934), &quot;Frontier&quot; (1935), and &quot;El Penitente&quot; (1940). For Anna Sokolow, Horst composed &quot;Noah&quot; (1935). He also composed several movie scores.

Horst taught art of choreography at Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theater (1928-1964), Bennington College (1934-45), Mills College, Connecticut College (1948–63), Barnard College, Sarah Lawrence College, Columbia University, and The Juilliard School (1951-64).

Horst lectured often on &quot;Dance Composition&quot;, &quot;Music Composition for Dance&quot;, and &quot;Modern Dance and Its Relation to the Other Modern Arts&quot;. He wrote and published two books: &quot;Pre-classic Dance Forms&quot; (1937) and &quot;Modern Dance Forms&quot; (1960). He founded and edited &quot;Dance Observer Journal&quot; (1933-64).

In 1964 he became the second recipient of the Heritage Award of the National Dance Association.

<text>Allen Trimble (November 24, 1783 – February 3, 1870) was a Federalist and National Republican politician from Ohio. He served as the eighth and tenth governor of Ohio, first concurrently as Senate Speaker, later elected twice in his own right.

==Biography==
Governor Trimble was born Hugh Allen Trimble in Augusta County, Virginia to James Trimble, Revolutionary War veteran, and Jane Allen Trimble. He was of Ulster Scots ancestry. In October 1784, his father moved his family to a veterans land grant in then Fayette County, Kentucky. In October 1804, James Trimble died leaving Allen head of the family. Allen Trimble moved them to a homestead he and his father had established outside of Hillsboro, Ohio.

==Career==
Trimble was a clerk of the Common Pleas Court in 1808. He also served as recorder of deeds in 1808.

After briefly serving during the War of 1812, Trimble served in the Ohio House of Representatives from 1816 to 1817 and then in the Ohio State Senate from 1818 to 1826. Trimble became Speaker of the Senate, and it was in this capacity that he became governor from January to December 1822 when Governor Ethan Allen Brown resigned to take a seat in the United States Senate.

Trimble ran an election for a full term in 1822, but narrowly lost. He challenged Jeremiah Morrow again in 1824, narrowing the distance between the two, but still losing. He won a landslide election in 1826, however, as a National Republican and then won a second full term in 1828. Trimble did not seek re-election in 1830. 

He then retired to farming, taking little part in politics for the next quarter-century, but did consent to accepting the nomination of the Know-Nothings for governor in 1855. Trimble came in third, losing to Republican US Senator Salmon Chase and incumbent Democrat William Medill. In 1860 he was a delegate to the Constitutional Union Party convention in Baltimore.

==Death==
Trimble died at his family farm in Ohio, and was buried in Hillsboro Cemetery in Hillsboro, Ohio.

==Legacy==
Trimble, Ohio, a village in Athens County, Ohio, is named in Trimble&#x27;s honor. Court Street, a street in Hillsboro, Ohio, on the north side of the Highland County Courthouse, was renamed &quot;Governor Trimble Place&quot; in 1974.

Trimble&#x27;s daughter, Eliza, helped to initiate the temperance movement in the United States.

Trimble is an ancestor of astronomer Virginia Louise Trimble

<text>Rajendra Prasad (3 December 1884 – 28 February 1963) was an Indian politician, lawyer, journalist and scholar who served as the first president of India from 1952 to 1962. He joined the Indian National Congress during the Indian independence movement and became a major leader from the region of Bihar. A supporter of Mahatma Gandhi, Prasad was imprisoned by British authorities during the Salt Satyagraha of 1930 and the Quit India movement of 1942. After the constituent assembly 1946 elections, Prasad served as 1st Minister of Food and Agriculture in the central government from 1947 to 1948. Upon independence in 1947, Prasad was elected as President of the Constituent Assembly of India, which prepared the Constitution of India and which served as its provisional Parliament.

When India became a republic in 1950, Prasad was elected as its first president by the Constituent Assembly. As president, Prasad established a tradition for non-partisanship and independence for the office-bearer and retired from Congress party politics. Although a ceremonial head of state, Prasad encouraged the development of education in India and advised government on several occasions. In 1957, Prasad was re-elected to the presidency, becoming the only president to serve two full terms. Prasad stayed in office for the longest term of around 12 years. Post the completion of his tenure, he quit the Congress and set up new guidelines for parliamentarians which are still followed.

==Early life==
Prasad was born on 3 December 1884 in a Kayastha family in Ziradei, Bengal Presidency, British India (now in Siwan district, Bihar. His father, Mahadev Sahai, was a scholar of both Sanskrit and Persian languages. His mother, Kamleshwari Devi, was a devout woman who would tell stories from the Ramayana and Mahabharata to her son. He was the youngest child and had one elder brother and three elder sisters. His mother died when he was a child, and his elder sister then took care of him.

==Student life==
After the completion of traditional elementary education, he was sent to the Chhapra District School. Meanwhile, in June 1896, at the early age of 12, he was married to Rajavanshi Devi. He, along with his elder brother, Mahendra Prasad Srivastava, then went to study at T.K. Ghosh&#x27;s Academy in Patna for a period of two years. He secured first in the entrance examination to the University of Calcutta and was awarded Rs. 30 per month as a scholarship.

Prasad joined the Presidency College, Calcutta in 1902, initially as a science student. He passed the F. A. under the University of Calcutta in March 1904 and then graduated with a first division from there in March 1905. Impressed by his intellect, an examiner once commented on his answer sheet that the &quot;examinee is better than examiner&quot;. Later he decided to focus on the study of arts and did his M.A. in Economics with a first division from the University of Calcutta in December 1907. There he lived with his brother in the Eden Hindu Hostel. A devoted student as well as a public activist, he was an active member of The Dawn Society. It was due to his sense of duty towards his family and education that he refused to join Servants of India Society, as it was during that time when his mother had died as well as his sister became a widow at the age of nineteen and had to return to her parents&#x27; home. Prasad was instrumental in the formation of the Bihari Students Conference in 1906 in the hall of Patna College. It was the first organisation of its kind in India and produced important leaders from Bihar like Anugrah Narayan Sinha and Shri Krishna Singh who played a prominent role in the Champaran Movement and Non-cooperation Movement.

==Career==

=== A teacher===

Prasad served in various educational institutions as a teacher. After completing his M.A in economics, he became a professor of English at the Langat Singh College of Muzaffarpur in Bihar and went on to become the principal. However, later on he left the college to undertake legal studies and entered the Ripon College, Calcutta (now the Surendranath Law College). In 1909, while pursuing his law studies in Kolkata he also worked as Professor of Economics at Calcutta City College.

===A lawyer===
In 1915, Prasad appeared in the examination of masters in law from the Department of Law, University of Calcutta, passed the examination and won a gold medal. He completed his Doctorate in Law from Allahabad University. In 1916, he joined the High Court of Bihar and Odisha. In 1917, he was appointed as one of the first members of the Senate and of the Patna University. He also practised law at Bhagalpur, the famous silk town in Bihar.

===Role in the freedom Movement===
Prasad had a major role in the Independence Movement. Prasad&#x27;s first association with Indian National Congress was during 1906 annual session organised in Calcutta, where he participated as a volunteer, while studying in Calcutta. Formally, he joined the Indian National Congress in the year 1911, when the annual session was again held in Calcutta. During the Lucknow Session of Indian National Congress held in 1916, he met Mahatma Gandhi. During one of the fact-finding missions at Champaran, Mahatma Gandhi asked him to come with his volunteers. He was so greatly moved by the dedication, courage and conviction of Mahatma Gandhi that as soon as the motion of Non-Cooperation was passed by Indian National Congress in 1920, he retired from his lucrative career of lawyer as well as his duties in the university to aid the movement.

He also responded to the call by Gandhi to boycott Western educational establishments by asking his son, Mrityunjaya Prasad, to drop out of his studies and enrol himself in Bihar Vidyapeeth, an institution he along with his colleagues founded on the traditional Indian model.
During the course of the independence movement, he interacted with Rahul Sankrityayan, a writer, and polymath. Rahul Sankrityayan was greatly influenced by Prasad&#x27;s intellectual powers, finding him to be a guide and guru. In many of his articles he mentioned about his meeting with Sankrityayan and narrated about his meetings with Sankrityayan. He wrote articles for the revolutionary publications Searchlight and the Desh and collected funds for these papers. He toured widely, explaining, lecturing, and exhorting the principles of the independence movement.

He took an active role in helping people affected by the 1914 floods that struck Bihar and Bengal. When an earthquake affected Bihar on 15 January 1934, Prasad was in jail. During that period, he passed on the relief work to his close colleague Anugrah Narayan Sinha. He was released two days later and set up Bihar Central Relief Committee on 17 January 1934 and took on the task of raising funds to help the affected people. After the 31 May 1935 Quetta earthquake, when he was forbidden to leave the country due to government&#x27;s order, he set up the Quetta Central Relief Committee in Sindh and Punjab under his own presidency.

He was elected as the President of the Indian National Congress during the Bombay session in October 1934. He again became the president when Subhash Chandra Bose resigned in 1939. On 8 August 1942, Congress passed the Quit India Resolution in Bombay which led to the arrest of many Indian leaders. Prasad was arrested in Sadaqat Ashram, Patna and sent to Bankipur Central Jail. After remaining incarcerated for nearly three years, he was released on 15 June 1945.

After the formation of Interim Government of 12 nominated ministers under the leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru on 2 September 1946, he was allocated the Food and Agriculture department. He was elected as the President of Constituent Assembly on 11 December 1946. On 17 November 1947 he became Congress President for a third time after J. B. Kripalani submitted his resignation.

== Presidency ==

Two and a half years after independence, on 26 January 1950, the Constitution of independent India was ratified, and he was elected as the first President of India. On the night of 25 January 1950 (a day before the Republic Day of India), his sister Bhagwati Devi died. He arranged her cremation but only after his return from the parade ground.
As the President of India, Prasad duly acted as required by the Constitution and was independent of any political party. He travelled the world extensively as an ambassador of India, building diplomatic rapport with foreign nations. He was re-elected for two consecutive terms in 1952 and 1957 and is the only President of India to achieve this feat. The Mughal Gardens at the Rashtrapati Bhavan were open to public for about a month for the first time during his tenure, and since then it has been a big attraction for people in Delhi and many other parts of the country.

Prasad acted independently of political parties, following the expected role of the president as required by the constitution. Following the tussle over the enactment of the Hindu Code Bill, he took a more active role in state affairs. In 1962, after serving 12 years as president, he announced his decision to retire. After relinquishing the office of the President of India in May 1962, he returned to Patna on 14 May 1962 and stayed on the campus of Bihar Vidyapeeth. His wife died on 9 September 1962, a month before Indo-China War. He was subsequently honoured with Bharat Ratna, the nation&#x27;s highest civilian award.

He died on 28 February 1963, aged 78. Rajendra Smriti Sangrahalaya in Patna is dedicated to him.

<text>Lorrie Moore (born Marie Lorena Moore; January 13, 1957) is an American writer, critic, and essayist. She is best known for her short stories, some of which have won major awards. Since 1984, she has also taught creative writing.

==Biography==

Marie Lorena Moore was born in Glens Falls, New York, and nicknamed &quot;Lorrie&quot; by her parents. She attended St. Lawrence University. At 19, she won &quot;Seventeen&quot; magazine&#x27;s fiction contest. The story, &quot;Raspberries,&quot; was published in January 1977. After graduating from St. Lawrence, she moved to Manhattan and worked as a paralegal for two years.

In 1980, Moore enrolled in Cornell University&#x27;s M.F.A. program, where she was taught by Alison Lurie. Upon graduation from Cornell, Moore was encouraged by a teacher to contact literary agent Melanie Jackson, who agreed to take her as a client. In 1983, Jackson sold Moore&#x27;s collection &quot;Self-Help&quot;, almost entirely stories from her master&#x27;s thesis, to Knopf.

==Works==

===Short stories===
Moore&#x27;s short story collections are &quot;Self-Help&quot; (1985), &quot;Like Life&quot;, the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller &quot;Birds of America&quot;, and &quot;Bark&quot;. She has contributed to &quot;The Paris Review&quot;. Her first story to appear in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Ugly, Too,&quot; was later included in &quot;The Best American Short Stories of the Century&quot;, edited by John Updike. Another story, &quot;People Like That Are the Only People Here,&quot; also published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, was reprinted in the 1998 edition of the annual collection &quot;The Best American Short Stories&quot;; the tale of a young child falling sick, the piece was loosely patterned on events in Moore&#x27;s own life. The story was also included in the 2005 anthology &quot;Children Playing Before a Statue of Hercules&quot;, edited by David Sedaris.

Moore&#x27;s anthology &quot;Collected Stories&quot; was published by Faber in the United Kingdom in May 2008. It includes all the stories in each of her previously published collections and three previously uncollected stories first published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

Moore&#x27;s latest collection, &quot;Bark&quot;, was published in 2014. It became a finalist of The Story Prize and was short-listed by Frank O&#x27;Connor International Short Story Award.

===Novels===
Moore&#x27;s novels are &quot;Anagrams&quot; (1986), &quot;Who Will Run the Frog Hospital?&quot; (1994), and &quot;A Gate at the Stairs&quot; (2009). &quot;Anagrams,&quot; with its experimental form, received a rather cold critical response. &quot;Who Will Run the Frog Hospital&quot; is the story of a woman vacationing with her husband who recalls an intense friendship from her adolescence. &quot;A Gate at the Stairs&quot; takes place just after the September 11 attack and is about a 20-year-old Midwestern woman&#x27;s coming of age.

Of Moore&#x27;s 2023 novel &quot;I Am Homeless if This Is Not My Home&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;&#x27;s Parul Sehgal wrote: &quot;One might say of Lorrie Moore what she said of Updike—that she is our greatest writer without a great novel—but how tinny ‘greatness’ can feel when caught in the inhabiting, staining, possessing power of a work of such determined strangeness and pain. An almost violent kind of achievement: a writer knifing forward, slicing open a new terrain—slicing open conventional notions and obligations of narrative itself.&quot;

===Children&#x27;s books===
Moore has written a children&#x27;s book entitled &quot;The Forgotten Helper&quot;, about an elf whom Santa Claus mistakenly leaves behind at the home of the worst child on his &quot;good&quot; list. The elf must help the child be good for the coming year so Santa will return next Christmas.

===Essays===
Moore writes occasionally about books, films, and television for &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. A collection of her essays, criticism and comment was published by Knopf as &quot;See What Can Be Done&quot; in April 2018.

==Academic career==
Moore was the Delmore Schwartz Professor in the Humanities at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where she taught creative writing for 30 years. She joined the faculty in 1984 and left to join the faculty at Vanderbilt University in the fall of 2013, where she is now the Gertrude Conaway Vanderbilt Professor of English.

Moore has also taught at Cornell University, as the Sidney Harman Writer-in-Residence at Baruch College, and at the MFA in Creative Writing program at the University of Michigan, as well as at Princeton and New York University.

<text>The National 12 is a two-person, two-sail, twelve-foot (3.6 metre) long sailing dinghy. They are sailed extensively in the UK. The class was started in 1936 by the Royal Yachting Association as an alternative to the more expensive International 14s. 

The rules limit the length of the boat to 12 ft, beam to 6 ft 6 in, an all up weight to 78 kg and a sail area of 10.4 m2. National 12s are sailed on all types of water from narrow rivers to the open sea. The class holds a national championships on an annual basis – known as Burton Week after the premier prize of the week: The Sir William Burton Cup – at various venues around the UK coast.

The National 12 is a development class where within a set of rules (and with occasional considered changes to those rules) the boats have been able to evolve over time, moving from wood and clinker construction to high-performance glass and carbon fibre-foam composite boats. There have been over two hundred different designs since the class inception. One of the most noticeable changes in the boats is the steady increase in beam over the history of the class – early examples were less than 5 ft while modern ones are usually at the maximum 6 ft 6 in to provide maximum righting moment for the crew. The Twelve has developed into a racing boat which performs well in all conditions being highly manouvreable and challenging to sail in windy weather.

==The History==

N1 &quot;Gipsy&quot; was designed by Uffa Fox and launched at Cowes in April 1936. The Twelve proved extremely popular and by the first championships in September of that year over 150 boats had been built. Gipsy accepted honourable retirement at the former Exeter Maritime Museum as a landmark in dinghy sailing history. Although his design, the &quot;Uffa King&quot;, was very successful Fox himself built only two boats, &quot;Anemone&quot; N452, and &quot;Westwind&quot; N456, the latter for Bruce Banks, later to become famous as a sailmaker, in whose hands the boat was successfully campaigned for more than a decade, winning the Burton Cup both in 1939 and again in 1950. &quot;Westwind&quot; is now in the collection of the National Maritime Museum Cornwall

From 1936 to the present day the class has continued to develop. Rule changes have been made where necessary, for example, a minimum width rule was introduced in 1937, and a maximum width in 1980 . Clinker construction went out in 1970 with the development of GRP hulls and &#x27;four plank&#x27; wooden construction.

Ian Proctor started experimenting with metal masts to replace wooden spars in 1952 and Terylene sails arrived in 1954. The minimum weight was reduced to 80 kg in the 1980s. 

A further reduction in late 1990s and a recent reduction in 2000 reduced the minimum weight down to the currently 78 kg (this includes mast &amp; centreboard), reflecting the ability of even amateur builders to build lightweight hulls. Today most new boats are built using carbon fibre-foam sandwich construction with a self draining floor. This makes the boats very light and stiff, adding to the responsive character of the boats.

Winged rudders have been mainstream in the class since around 2010. They provide a number of benefits including: allowing the 12 to carry a little more helm/crew weight as they provide lift at the transom, increasing straight line speed in certain conditions and acting as a stabiliser on high speed reaches and runs.

==Handicap and Other Racing==

In a mixed fleet, the National 12 competes with other boats off a Portsmouth Yardstick handicap of 1064. In mixed fleet racing in North America, it is more likely to use a D-PN of 98.0.

<text>Jeremiah Morrow (October 6, 1771March 22, 1852) was a Democratic-Republican Party politician from Ohio. He served as the ninth governor of Ohio, and was the last Democratic-Republican to hold that office. He also served as a United States Senator and a member of the United States House of Representatives from Ohio. He also served in the Ohio Senate.

==Biography==
Morrow was born near Gettysburg in the Province of Pennsylvania. He was of Scots-Irish descent, his Irish grandfather, also Jeremiah Morrow, had come to America from County Londonderry, and was descended from 17th century Scottish settlers. He moved to the Northwest Territory in 1795. He lived at the mouth of the Little Miami River for a short time before moving to what is now Warren County. As a member of the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church, he sought the services of a minister of his denomination soon after settling in the region, and he was one of the original elders of the Mill Creek congregation when it was organized shortly before 1800.

After serving in the Territorial House of Representatives and Territorial Senate, and as a Hamilton county delegate to the 1802 Constitutional Convention, he was elected to the first State Senate a year later and served six months before becoming Ohio&#x27;s first member of the United States House of Representatives. Morrow won four additional full terms. He ran for the U.S. Senate in 1812 and served a single term from 1813 to 1819, and did not seek re-election. As such, he was the first U.S. Senator for Ohio to serve a full six-year term. Morrow was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1814. In 1820, he served as one of Ohio&#x27;s Presidential electors for James Monroe. He won election to the governorship in 1822 and served for two two-year terms. He declined to serve a third term, instead returning to the Ohio House of Representatives and State Senate. Morrow was sent back to Washington again in 1841, and served two more years in the House, but refused to be renominated in 1842, believing himself too old.

==Death and legacy==
After retiring from politics, Morrow returned to his farm and gristmill in Warren County. He died in 1852.

Morrow is the namesake of the Jeremiah Morrow Bridge, the highest bridge in Ohio. Morrow County and Morrow, Ohio are named after him. His grandson, George E. Morrow, was a professor at the University of Illinois and Iowa State University, and was president of Oklahoma State University.

<text>Jacques Joseph (born Jakob Lewin Joseph; 6 September 1865 – 12 February 1934) was a German medical doctor. &quot;Nose Joseph&quot; (&quot;Nasenjoseph&quot;) as he was known, is considered a pioneer of rhinoplasty.

Joseph was the third child of Rabbi Israel Joseph and his wife Sara. He was an innovator in modern plastic surgery and reconstructive surgery who developed methods for aesthetic plastic surgery, including cosmetic rhinoplasty. He noted that cosmetic surgery, while not a physical necessity, was worth the risks to a person&#x27;s health because of its positive impact on their spirit, personality, and role in the world. He was a pioneer of rhinoplasty, which he developed and performed on many of Berlin&#x27;s Jewish community (to which he also belonged).

From 1885 to 1889, he was a student of medicine at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin. In 1892 he joined the staff of the Berlin University Clinic for Orthopaedic Surgery. In the same year he married his wife, Leonore. In 1904, Jacques Joseph published his first report on the simultaneous, intranasal correction of a hump nose with the correction of the front nasal septum. In 1916, he was appointed head of the newly founded Department of Facial Plastic Surgery at the Ear, Nose and Throat Clinic at the Charité by the Prussian Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs.

In 1919, he was appointed professor despite not having habilitated and was awarded the Iron Cross. In 1922, Joseph set up his own practice where he dedicated himself to work in several fields of plastic surgery. A report on Jacques Joseph was published by &quot;raving reporter&quot; Egon Erwin Kisch. In 1928 and 1929 the first two sections of Jacques Joseph&#x27;s book on &#x27;Nasal plastic surgery&#x27; were published at Curt Kabitzsch Publishers, Würzburg and Leipzig. In 1931 the expanded final version of his book on &#x27;Nasal Plastic Surgery and Other Facial Reconstructive Procedures, With an Appendix on Reconstructive Breast Surgery and Some Other Procedures in the Area of External Plastic Surgery. An Atlas and Text Book.&#x27; was published. This book is called a milestone in plastic surgery.

On 12 February 1934, Jacques Joseph died of a heart attack in the hallway of his house in Berlin on his way to his practice. Joseph&#x27;s grave, long thought to be lost, was discovered in the early 2000s in the Jewish Weißensee cemetery. After reconstruction of the gravestone, it was rededicated by leading members of the Jewish community of Berlin on October 17, 2004.

<text>Spider-Man 3 is a 2007 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man. Produced by Columbia Pictures, Marvel Entertainment, and Laura Ziskin Productions, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing, it was directed by Sam Raimi from a screenplay he co-wrote with his brother Ivan and Alvin Sargent. It is the final installment in Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; trilogy, and the sequel to &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2002) and &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; (2004). The film stars Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, alongside Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Thomas Haden Church, Topher Grace, Bryce Dallas Howard, James Cromwell, Rosemary Harris, and J. K. Simmons. It also marks the final acting appearance of Cliff Robertson before his retirement in the same year and his subsequent death in 2011. Set a year after the events of &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;, the film follows Peter Parker as he prepares for his future with Mary Jane Watson, while facing Uncle Ben&#x27;s true killer, Flint Marko, who becomes the Sandman after a freak accident, and Harry Osborn, his former best friend, who is now aware of Peter&#x27;s identity and seeks to avenge his father; his job at the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; is threatened by the presence of a rival photographer named Eddie Brock. Peter also faces his greatest challenge when he bonds with an extraterrestrial symbiote that increases his abilities but amplifies his anger and other negative traits.

Development of &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; began immediately after the successful release of &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; for a 2007 release. During preproduction, Raimi wanted two villains, Harry Osborn and Sandman. At the request of producer Avi Arad, he added Venom to the list, and the producers also requested the addition of Gwen Stacy. Principal photography for the film began in January 2006 and took place in Los Angeles and Cleveland before moving to New York City from May until July 2006. Additional pick-up shots were made after August and the film wrapped in October 2006. During post-production, Sony Pictures Imageworks created over 900 visual effects shots. Composer Danny Elfman, who had scored the previous installments, decided not to return due to creative differences and conflicts with Raimi during production of the previous film, so Christopher Young composed the score in Elfman&#x27;s absence. With an estimated production budget of $258–350 million, the film was the most expensive film ever made at the time of its release.

&quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; premiered on April 16, 2007, in Tokyo, and was released in the United States in both conventional and IMAX theaters on May 4. The film grossed $891 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of the trilogy, the third-highest-grossing film of 2007 and the tenth-highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release. It was also the highest-grossing &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film until it was surpassed by &quot;Spider-Man: Far From Home&quot; in 2019, and Raimi&#x27;s Highest-grossing film until it was surpassed by &quot;Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&quot; (2022). Unlike the previous installments, &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; received mixed reviews from critics.

A fourth installment, titled &quot;Spider-Man 4&quot;, was set to be released on May 6, 2011, followed by a &quot;Venom&quot; spin-off film, along with a fifth and sixth installment, titled &quot;Spider-Man 5&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man 6&quot; respectively, but all were canceled. The &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film series was rebooted twice; first with &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; (2012) by Marc Webb and starring Andrew Garfield; and later a new film series set within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) directed by Jon Watts and starring Tom Holland, beginning with &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot; (2017). &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021) explored the concept of the multiverse to connect the previous films and characters to the MCU with Maguire and Church reprising their roles in the film. A &quot;Venom&quot; film, and featuring another version of the Eddie Brock character were eventually produced and released in 2018, 2021 and 2024, respectively.

==Plot==
Two years after Otto Octavius&#x27;s sacrifice, Peter Parker plans to propose to Mary Jane Watson, who has made her Broadway musical debut. In Central Park, a meteorite lands near the two, from which an extraterrestrial symbiote oozes out and follows Peter to his apartment by attaching to his motorbike. Harry Osborn, knowing Peter is Spider-Man, seeks to avenge his father&#x27;s death. Using Norman&#x27;s performance-enhancing gas and Green Goblin technology, he battles Peter to an eventual stalemate, developing partial amnesia following a fall from his glider. Meanwhile, police pursue escaped convict Flint Marko, who visits his wife and sick daughter before fleeing. Falling into an experimental particle accelerator that fuses his body with the surrounding sand, he gains the ability to control and reform his body with sand, becoming Sandman.

During a festival honoring Spider-Man for saving Gwen Stacy&#x27;s life, Peter kisses her to please the crowd, angering Mary Jane. Marko then robs an armored truck and escapes after a duel with Spider-Man. NYPD Captain George Stacy, Gwen&#x27;s father, informs Peter and his aunt May that Marko is uncle Ben&#x27;s true killer; the initial suspect was merely Marko&#x27;s accomplice. At his apartment, the symbiote assimilates Peter&#x27;s suit as he sleeps in it while waiting for Marko to come out of hiding. Peter awakens on top of a building, discovering that the symbiote has colored his suit black and enhanced his powers, as well as the aggressive nature of his personality.

Peter locates and battles Marko in a subway tunnel. Discovering that water is his weakness, he opens a pipe, releasing water that reduces Marko to mud and washes him away in a sewer. Peter&#x27;s changed demeanor alienates Mary Jane, who also receives negative reviews from critics. She shares a kiss with Harry and leaves in regret. Urged by a hallucination of his father, Harry recovers from his amnesia and forces Mary Jane to break up with Peter. Harry later meets up with Peter and tells him that Mary Jane is dating him. Under the symbiote&#x27;s influence, Peter fights with Harry and spitefully says his father never loved him. As Peter leaves, Harry throws a pumpkin bomb at him, but Peter deflects it back, disfiguring Harry&#x27;s face.

At the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;, Peter exposes rival photographer Eddie Brock, whose fake photos incriminate Spider-Man. Publisher J. Jonah Jameson, outraged at Eddie&#x27;s false photo and having to print a retraction, fires Brock and promotes Peter to staff photographer. Later, Peter brings Gwen to a jazz club where Mary Jane now works, in an attempt to make her jealous. Upon realizing Peter&#x27;s true intentions, Gwen apologizes to Mary Jane and leaves. After assaulting the bouncers and accidentally hitting Mary Jane, Peter realizes that the symbiote is corrupting him. Retreating to a church&#x27;s bell tower and discovering that the sounds of clanging metal weaken the creature, Peter removes the symbiote. Brock, witnessing the event from the pews below, becomes the symbiote&#x27;s new host and turns into Venom.

Brock locates a still-living Marko and convinces him to join forces to kill Spider-Man. Brock abducts Mary Jane and holds her captive from a web at a construction site, intending to kill her in revenge for Peter ruining him, while Marko keeps the police at bay. After a now scarred Harry declines to help Peter, Harry&#x27;s butler reveals that Norman&#x27;s death was not Spider-Man&#x27;s fault. While Brock and Marko pin Peter down, Harry arrives to help Peter and save Mary Jane. Brock attempts to impale Peter with Harry&#x27;s glider, but Harry jumps in and is impaled instead. While remembering the symbiote&#x27;s weakness, Peter assembles a perimeter of metal pipes to create a sonic attack, weakening it and allowing Peter to separate Brock from the symbiote.

Peter activates a pumpkin bomb and throws it at the hostless symbiote. Having become addicted to its influence, Brock attempts to save the symbiote, but both are vaporized. Marko explains that Ben&#x27;s death was an accident that has haunted him and that everything he has done was to help his daughter, Peter forgives Marko, allowing him to escape. Peter and Harry reconcile before the latter dies from his injuries. Sometime after Harry&#x27;s funeral, Peter visits Mary Jane at the jazz club, where they embrace and share a dance.

==Cast==
* Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:A superhero, a brilliant physics student at Columbia University, and photographer for the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;. As he grows arrogant with the city starting to embrace him for the first time in his career, an alien symbiote attaches itself to Peter&#x27;s costume and influences his behavior for the worse. Maguire said he relished the opportunity to play a less timid Peter in this film.
* Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson:Peter Parker&#x27;s girlfriend and a Broadway actress, whom he has loved since childhood. Mary Jane has a string of bad luck in the film, reminiscent of Peter&#x27;s misfortune in &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;, struggling in her career because of negative reviews and losing her boyfriend when the symbiote takes him over. Mary Jane was not originally planned to be kidnapped during the climax by the villains as Raimi initially felt this would become repetitive throughout the entire trilogy; this decision was changed late in production.
* James Franco as Harry Osborn / New Goblin:The son of Norman Osborn, and Peter Parker&#x27;s best friend, who believes Spider-Man killed his father. After learning Peter is Spider-Man and that Norman was the Green Goblin, Harry picks up where his father left and becomes the New Goblin to battle his former friend.
* Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko / Sandman: A small-time thug with an ex-wife and sick daughter, for whom he steals money to help get the treatment to cure her. He transforms into the Sandman following a freak accident and incurs Peter&#x27;s wrath when Peter learns he was his Uncle Ben&#x27;s killer. Church was approached for Sandman because of his award-winning performance in the film &quot;Sideways&quot;, and accepted the role despite the lack of a script at the time. The film&#x27;s Sandman possesses sympathy similarly exhibited by Lon Chaney Jr. in his portrayals of misunderstood creatures, as well as Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, the Golem, and Andy Serkis&#x27; portrayals of Gollum and King Kong. Church worked out for 16 months to improve his physique for the role, gaining 28 pounds of muscle and losing 10 pounds of fat. On his performance, Church expressed that &quot;[villains] with a conscience have this sad realization of who they are, and the monster they&#x27;ve become — there&#x27;s a sense of regret. So, at the end of these movies there&#x27;s a dramatic resonance that really stays with the audience.&quot;
* Topher Grace as Edward &quot;Eddie&quot; Brock Jr. / Venom: Peter&#x27;s rival at the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;. He is exposed by Peter for creating a fake incriminating image of Spider-Man, and leaps at the opportunity to exact his revenge when he bonds with an extraterrestrial symbiote. Grace had impressed the producers with his performance in the film &quot;In Good Company&quot;. A big comic book fan who read the first Venom stories as a boy, Grace spent six months working out to prepare for the role, gaining 25 pounds of muscle. He approached the character as someone under the influence, similar to an alcoholic or drug addict, and interpreted him as having a bad childhood, which is the key difference between him and Peter. Grace found his costume unpleasant, as it had to be constantly smeared to give a liquid-like look and feel. The costume took an hour to put on, and prosthetics took four hours to apply. Grace also wore fangs, which bruised his gums.
* Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy: A model and Peter&#x27;s lab partner, to whom Brock is attracted. Peter asks her out to embarrass Mary Jane while possessed by the symbiote. Howard said the challenge of playing the role was in reminding many fans of the good-natured character who was Peter&#x27;s first love in the comics yet was &quot;the other woman&quot; in the film. Howard strove to create a sense that Gwen could potentially be a future girlfriend for him and that she &quot;was not acting like some kind of man-stealing tart.&quot; 
* James Cromwell as Captain George Stacy: Gwen&#x27;s father and a New York City Police Department captain.
* Rosemary Harris as May Parker: The aunt of Peter Parker and the widow of Ben Parker, Peter&#x27;s uncle. She gives Peter her engagement ring so he can propose to Mary Jane and gives him lessons in forgiveness.
* J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson: The editor-in-chief of the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;. He has a particular dislike towards Spider-Man, whom he considers a criminal and tries in every way to discredit.

Several actors reprise their roles from the previous films. Dylan Baker portrays Dr. Curt Connors, a college physics professor under whom Peter Parker studies, while Willem Dafoe portrays Norman Osborn / Green Goblin, Harry&#x27;s late father, who returns as a hallucination to encourage his son to destroy Spider-Man, and Cliff Robertson appears as Ben Parker, Peter&#x27;s deceased uncle in his final acting appearance before his retirement and death in 2011. Bill Nunn, Ted Raimi, Michael Papajohn, John Paxton, and Elizabeth Banks return as Joseph &quot;Robbie&quot; Robertson, a longtime employee at the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;; Ted Hoffman, also a longtime employee of the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;; Dennis &quot;Spike&quot; Carradine, the carjacker who was believed to have murdered Uncle Ben; Bernard Houseman, butler to the Osborn family; and Betty Brant, the receptionist at the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; for J. Jonah Jameson, respectively. Elya Baskin additionally reprises his role as Mr. Ditkovitch, Peter&#x27;s landlord while Mageina Tovah reprises her role as his daughter Ursula. Joe Manganiello reprises his role as Flash Thompson from the first film in a cameo appearance. Becky Ann Baker appears as Mrs. Stacy. Theresa Russell and Perla Haney-Jardine appear as Emma and Penny Marko, Sandman&#x27;s wife and daughter respectively.

Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee has a cameo in &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;, as he did in the previous Spider-Man films, which he referred to as his &quot;best cameo&quot;. Actor Bruce Campbell, who had cameo roles as a wrestling ring announcer in &quot;Spider-Man&quot; and as a snooty usher in &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;, returns in &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; with a new cameo as a French maître d&#x27;. Originally his character, who helps Peter try to propose, was much more antagonistic. Composer Christopher Young appears in the film as a pianist at Mary Jane&#x27;s theater when she is fired, while producer Grant Curtis cameoed as the driver of an armored car that Sandman attacks. Comedian Dean Edwards played one of the newspaper readers who badmouth Spider-Man. 75-year-old newscaster Hal Fishman appears as himself anchoring the saga of Mary Jane&#x27;s kidnapping by Venom; he died just fourteen weeks after the movie opened. Actress Lucy Gordon appeared as newscaster Jennifer Dugan.

==Production==

===Development===

In March 2004, with &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; being released the coming June, Sony announced that &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; was already in development for a release in summer 2007. By the release of &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;, a release date for &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; had been set for May 2, 2007 before production on the sequel had begun. The date was later changed to May 4, 2007. In January 2005, Sony Pictures completed a seven-figure deal with screenwriter Alvin Sargent, who had penned &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;, to script &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; with an option to script a fourth film.

Immediately after &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;″s release, Ivan Raimi wrote a treatment over two months, with Sam Raimi deciding to use the film to explore Peter learning that he is not a sinless vigilante, and that there also can be humanity in those he considers criminals. Harry Osborn was brought back because Raimi wanted to conclude his story line. Raimi felt that Harry would not follow his father&#x27;s legacy, but be instead &quot;somewhere between.&quot; Sandman was introduced as an antagonist, as Raimi found him a visually fascinating character. While Sandman is a petty criminal in the comics, the screenwriters created a background of the character being Uncle Ben&#x27;s killer to increase Peter&#x27;s guilt over his death and challenge his simplistic perception of the event. Overall, Raimi described the film as being about Peter, Mary Jane, Harry, and the Sandman, with Peter&#x27;s journey being one of forgiveness.

Raimi wanted another villain, and Ben Kingsley was involved in negotiations to play the Vulture before the character was cut. Vulture was considered to be an accomplice of Flint Marko in the script. Producer Avi Arad convinced Raimi to include Venom, a character whose perceived &quot;lack of humanity&quot; had initially been criticized by Sam Raimi. Venom&#x27;s alter-ego, Eddie Brock, already had a minor role in the script. Arad felt the series had relied too much on Raimi&#x27;s personal favorite Spider-Man villains, not characters that modern fans were actually interested in, so Raimi included Venom to please them, and even began to appreciate the character himself. The film&#x27;s version of the character is an amalgamation of Venom stories. Edward Brock Jr., the human part of Venom, serves as a mirror to Peter Parker, with both characters having similar jobs and romantic interests. Brock&#x27;s actions as a journalist in &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; also represent contemporary themes of paparazzi and tabloid journalism. The producers also suggested adding rival love interest Gwen Stacy, filling in an &quot;other girl&quot; type that Raimi had already created. With so many additions, Sargent soon found his script so complex that he considered splitting it into two films, but abandoned the idea when he could not create a successful intermediate climax.

===Filming===
Camera crews spent 2 weeks from November 5–18, 2005 to film sequences that would involve intense visual effects so Sony Pictures Imageworks could begin work on the shots early in the project. The same steps had been taken for &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; to begin producing visual effects early for sequences involving the villain Doctor Octopus.

Principal photography for &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; began on January 16, 2006, and wrapped in July 2006 after over 100 days of filming. The team filmed in Los Angeles until May 19, 2006. In spring 2006, film location manager Peter Martorano brought camera crews to Cleveland, Ohio, due to the Greater Cleveland Film Commission offering production space at the city&#x27;s convention center at no cost. In Cleveland, they shot the battle between Spider-Man and Sandman in the armored car. Afterwards, the team moved to Manhattan, where filming took place at various locations, including One Chase Manhattan Plaza, from May 26, 2006, until July 1, 2006. Shooting placed a strain on Raimi, who often had to move between several units to complete the picture. Shooting was also difficult for cinematographer Bill Pope, as the symbiote Spider-Man, Venom, and the New Goblin were costumed in black during fight scenes taking place at night. For the breakdancing scene, Maguire at first did not want to dance, but relented after Pomerhn Derrick showed him some Fred Astaire dance moves.

After August, pick-ups were conducted as Raimi sought to film more action scenes. The film then wrapped in October, although additional special effects shots were taken to finalize the production a month later. In early 2007, there were further pick-up shots regarding the resolution of Sandman&#x27;s story, amounting to four different versions.

===Visual effects===

John Dykstra, who won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects for his work on &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;, declined to work on the third film as visual effects supervisor. Dykstra&#x27;s colleague, Scott Stokdyk, took his place as supervisor, leading two hundred programmers at Sony Pictures Imageworks. This group designed specific computer programs that did not exist when &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; began production, creating nine hundred visual effects shots.

In addition to the innovative visual effects for the film, Stokdyk created a miniature of a skyscraper section at 1:16 scale with New Deal Studios&#x27; Ian Hunter and David Sanger. Stokdyk chose to design the miniature instead of using computer-generated imagery so damage done to the building could be portrayed realistically and timely without guesswork involving computer models. In addition to Sony Pictures Imageworks, Cafe FX provided visual effects for the crane disaster scene when Spider-Man rescues Gwen Stacy, as well as shots in the climactic battle.
To understand the effects of sand for the Sandman, experiments were done with twelve types of sand, such as splashing, launching it at stuntmen, and pouring it over ledges. The results were mimicked on the computer to create the visual effects for Sandman. For scenes involving visual effects, Thomas Haden Church was super-imposed onto the screen, where computer-generated imagery was then applied. With sand as a possible hazard in scenes that buried actors, ground-up corn-cobs were used as a substitute instead. Because of its resemblance to the substance, sand from Arizona was used as the model for the CGI sand. In a fight where Spider-Man punches through Sandman&#x27;s chest, amputee martial arts expert Baxter Humby took Tobey Maguire&#x27;s place in filming the scene. Humby, whose right hand was amputated at birth, helped deliver the intended effect of punching through Sandman&#x27;s chest. Producer Laura Ziskin said the visual effects budget alone was approximately 30% more than the previous film.

Whereas the symbiote suit worn in the comics by Spider-Man was a plain black affair with a large white spider on the front and back, the design was changed for the film to become a black version of Spider-Man&#x27;s traditional costume, complete with webbing motif. As a consequence of this, the suit Topher Grace wore as Venom also bore the webbing motif; as producer Grant Curtis noted, &quot;it&#x27;s the Spider-Man suit, but twisted and mangled in its own right.&quot; Additionally, the motif gave a sense of life to the symbiote, giving it the appearance of gripping onto the character&#x27;s body. When animating the symbiote, Raimi did not want it to resemble a spider or an octopus, and to give it a sense of character. The CGI model is made of many separate strands. When animating Venom himself, animators observed footage of big cats such as lions and cheetahs for the character&#x27;s agile movements.

===Deleted scenes===
When interviewed at the film&#x27;s Tokyo premiere on April 16, 2007, Topher Grace said to Access Hollywood that despite liking how the film turned out, he expressed interest in having the rest of his scenes as both Eddie Brock and Venom being restored someday; later adding, &quot;You know what? Spider-Man 3.5, or however they release it. You know, with the extra scenes&quot;. Following the release of the film, fan research compiled deleted scenes and archival footage, showing Adrian Lester in the role of Dr. Wallace, a molecular biologist working on a cure for Marko&#x27;s daughter, and an alternate death scene for Venom attempting to reattach itself to Parker, who in turn would have destroyed the symbiote by yanking down a sling of steel rods and creating a sonic attack (although this was depicted in the film&#x27;s novelization).

==Music==

Danny Elfman, the composer for the previous installments, chose not to return for the third installment of &quot;Spider-Man&quot; because of difficulties with director Sam Raimi. Elfman said that he had a &quot;miserable experience&quot; working with Raimi on &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; and could not comfortably adapt his music. Christopher Young was then announced to score &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; in Elfman&#x27;s absence. Instead, Elfman chose to work with the 2006 live-action remake of &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot;. A few years later, he reunited with Raimi to compose the score for &quot;Oz the Great and Powerful&quot; (2013).

According to Young, Sandman&#x27;s theme uses &quot;two contrabass saxophones, two contrabass clarinets, two contrabass bassoons and eight very low French horns&quot; in order to sound &quot;low, aggressive and heavy&quot;. Young described Venom&#x27;s theme as &quot;Vicious, my instructions on that one were that he&#x27;s the devil personified. His theme is much more demonic sounding.&quot; Venom&#x27;s theme uses eight French horns. Raimi approved the new themes during their first performance, but rejected the initial music to the birth of Sandman, finding it too monstrous and not tragic enough. Young had to recompose much of his score at a later stage, as the producers felt there were not enough themes from the previous films. Ultimately, new themes for the love story, Aunt May, and Mary Jane were dropped.

==Marketing==

On June 28, 2006, the first &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; teaser trailer premiered in theaters with &quot;Superman Returns&quot;. The first trailer was released in theaters on November 17, 2006, with the debut of &quot;Casino Royale&quot; and &quot;Happy Feet&quot;. This was followed by a second trailer, which was unveiled on March 9, 2007, being attached to the screenings of &quot;300&quot;. The home video releases of &quot;Click&quot; and &quot;Monster House&quot; also contained trailers for &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;. In New York City, the hometown of Spider-Man&#x27;s fictional universe, tourist attractions arranged events and exhibits on April 30, 2007, to lead up to the release of &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;. The unique campaign included a spider exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History, workshops on baby spider plants at the New York Botanical Garden, a Green Goblin mask-making workshop at the Children&#x27;s Museum of Manhattan, and a scavenger hunt and bug show at Central Park Zoo.

Promotional tie-in partners include Burger King, 7-Eleven, General Mills, Kraft Foods, and Comcast. Hasbro, which holds the license for Marvel characters, released several toys to tie-in with the film. They include a deluxe spinning web blaster, along with several lines of action figures aimed at both children and collectors. Toys of the Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus from the first two films have been rereleased to match the smaller scale of the new figures, as have been toys of the Lizard, the Scorpion, Kraven the Hunter, and Rhino in a style reminiscent of the films. Techno Source created interactive toys, including a &quot;hand-held Battle Tronics device that straps to the inside of a player&#x27;s wrist and mimics Spidey&#x27;s web-slinging motions&quot;. Japanese Medicom Toy Corporation produced collectables, which Sideshow Collectibles distributed in the U.S. A prequel comic was released in June, 2007 and another comic called &quot;Spider-Man 3: The Black&quot;, which expands the birth of Venom, was released in November, 2007.

==Release==
===Theatrical===

&quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; had its world premiere at Toho Cinemas Roppongi Hills in Tokyo on April 16, 2007. The film held its UK premiere on April 23, 2007, at the Odeon Leicester Square, and the U.S. premiere took place at the Tribeca Film Festival in Queens on April 30, 2007.

&quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; was commercially released in sixteen territories on May 1, 2007. The film was released in Japan on May 1, 2007, three days prior to the American commercial release, to coincide with Japan&#x27;s Golden Week. &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; was also released in China on May 3, 2007, to circumvent market growth of unlicensed copies of the film. The studio&#x27;s release of a film in China before its domestic release was a first for Sony Pictures Releasing International. By May 6, 2007, &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; had opened in 107 countries around the world.

The film was commercially released in the United States on May 4, 2007, in a North American record total of 4,253 theaters, including fifty-three IMAX theaters. The record number of theaters was later beaten by &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot;, which was released in 4,362 theaters in the United States—109 more than &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;. It was the ninth film to play in more than 4,000 theaters upon opening, just after &quot;Shrek 2&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;, &quot;Shark Tale&quot;, &quot;Madagascar&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Over the Hedge&quot;, &quot;Superman Returns&quot; and &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot;. Tracking data a month before the U.S. release reflected over 90% awareness and over 20% first choice among moviegoers, statistics that estimated an opening weekend of over $100 million for &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;. Online tickets for &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; were reported on April 23, 2007, to have been purchased at a faster rate—three times at Movietickets.com and four times at Fandango—than online ticket sales for &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;. On May 2, 2007, Fandango reported the sales rate as six times greater than the rate for &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;. The strong ticket sales caused theaters to add 3:00 AM showings following the May 4, 2007 midnight showing to accommodate the demand.

The FX channel signed a five-year deal for the television rights to &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;, which they began airing in 2009. The price was based on the film&#x27;s box office performance, with an option for three opportunities for Sony to sell the rights to one or more other broadcast networks.

In March 2024, Sony announced that all of their live-action Spider-Man films would be re-released in theaters as part of Columbia Pictures&#x27; 100th anniversary celebration. &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; was re-released on April 29, 2024.

==Home media==
&quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; was released on Region 4 DVD (anamorphic widescreen) in Australia on September 18, 2007. For Region 2 in the United Kingdom, the film was released on October 15, 2007. &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; was released on DVD in Region 1 territories on October 30, 2007. The film is available in one-disc and two-disc editions, on both standard and Blu-ray formats, as well as packages with the previous films and a PSP release. Sam Raimi, Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Thomas Haden Church, Topher Grace, Bryce Dallas Howard, Laura Ziskin, Avi Arad, and Grant Curtis are among those who contributed to the audio commentaries.

Sony announced plans to create &quot;one of the largest&quot; marketing campaigns in Hollywood for the October 30, 2007 release of the DVD. Beginning with a partnership with Papa John&#x27;s, Sony printed close to 8.5 billion impressions for pizza boxes, television, radio, and online ads. Sony also worked with Pringles Potato Crisp, Blu Tack, Jolly Time Pop Corn, and Nutella. Sony&#x27;s Vice President of Marketing, Jennifer Anderson, stated the studio spent approximately 15% to 25% of its marketing budget on digital ad campaigns; from this, Papa John&#x27;s sent text messages to mobile phones with ads. Anderson stated that there would be three sweepstakes held for consumers, where they would be able to win prizes from Sony and its promotional partners.

In the United States, the film grossed more than on DVD sales. It also grossed more than $43.76 million on DVD/Home Video Rentals in 11 weeks. However, the DVD sales results of this film did not meet industry expectations. It was ranked in third place on the sales chart, behind &quot;I Now Pronounce You Chuck &amp; Larry&quot; and &quot;Ratatouille&quot;. The film&#x27;s DVD sales were limited due to Sony&#x27;s decision to bundle the Blu-ray version of the film with its new PlayStation 3 game console and Blu-ray player. Nevertheless, it sold 130,000 Blu-ray units within its first week of release, surpassing &quot;Casino Royale&quot; for not only being Sony&#x27;s best-selling Blu-ray title, but also having the highest first week sales on that format. &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; was included in &quot;The Spider-Man Legacy Collection&quot; which includes five major &quot;Spider-Man&quot; films in a 4K UHD Blu-Ray collection which was released on October 17, 2017.

In April 2021, Disney and Sony Pictures reached a multi-year deal to let Sony&#x27;s titles, including past &quot;Spider-Man&quot; franchises and SSU content to stream on Hulu and Disney+. A significant number of Sony titles began streaming on Hulu starting in June 2021. It includes films from 2022 onwards. While the deal only concerns the United States, titles from Sony Pictures begun to also be added to Disney+ in regions outside of the U.S., as early as June 2022, starting with the majority of the Spider-Man films. Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; trilogy was released on Disney+ on April 21, 2023.

=== &quot;Spider-Man 3: Editor&#x27;s Cut&quot; (2017) ===
In 2017, Sony released an &quot;editor&#x27;s cut&quot; of &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; that coincided with the film&#x27;s 10th anniversary, which was included in the &quot;Spider-Man Limited Edition&quot; Blu-ray collection released on June 13, 2017. The film features unused music from Christopher Young and is two minutes shorter than the theatrical cut. Some scenes are shifted around or have been completely removed, and the film includes 3 new scenes, 3 alternate climax sequences, and 1 extended scene. &quot;Spider-Man 3: Editor&#x27;s Cut&quot; was later re-released with the &quot;Spider-Man Legacy Collection&quot; 4K Blu-ray Box Set.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; earned $336.5 million in North America and $554.3 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $891 million. Worldwide, it is the third-highest-grossing film of 2007, the highest-grossing film of Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; trilogy, and was the highest-grossing film distributed by Sony/Columbia until 2012&#x27;s &quot;Skyfall&quot;. The film set a worldwide single-day record ($104 million) on its first Friday and broke its own record again on Saturday ($117.6 million). It also set a worldwide opening-weekend record with $381.7 million, beating &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot;. &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; would hold that record until &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; took it in 2009. The film&#x27;s IMAX screenings reached $20 million in 30 days, faster than any other 2D film remastered in the format.

In North America, &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; is the 58th-highest-grossing film, the third-highest-grossing film of the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; series, the third-highest-grossing film distributed by Sony/Columbia, and the highest-grossing 2007 film. The film sold an estimated 48,914,300 tickets. It was released in 4,252 theaters (about 10,300 screens) on Friday, May 4, 2007. This broke the previous record held by &quot;Shrek 2&quot; for having the largest number of screenings. It set an opening- and single-day record with $59.8 million (both were first surpassed by &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;). This included $10 million from midnight showings. &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; then set an opening-weekend record with $151.1 million (first surpassed by &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;), a record for the weekend per-theater average with $35,540 per theater (first surpassed by &quot;Hannah Montana &amp; Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert&quot;), and an IMAX opening-weekend record with $4.8 million (first surpassed by &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;). It would hold the record for having the highest opening weekend for any film featuring Spider-Man until it was surpassed by &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; less than a decade later in 2016. Then in 2022, &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&quot; dethroned &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; for having the largest opening weekend for a Sam Raimi film. The film set record Friday and Sunday grosses and achieved the largest cumulative gross through its second, third, and fourth day of release (all were first surpassed by &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;). It also set a record Saturday gross (surpassed by &quot;Marvel&#x27;s The Avengers&quot;). When the film was released, it was ranked in first place at the box office, just ahead of &quot;Disturbia&quot; and &quot;Lucky You&quot;. It would also dominate films that were released during the 2007 spring season, such as &quot;Meet the Robinsons&quot;, &quot;Fracture&quot; and &quot;Blades of Glory&quot;. When &quot;Shrek the Third&quot; opened on its third weekend, &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; dropped into second place.

Outside North America, it is the 23rd-highest-grossing film, the highest-grossing film of Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; trilogy, and the third-highest-grossing film distributed by Sony/Columbia. On its opening day (Tuesday, May 1, 2007), &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; grossed $29.2 million from 16 territories, an 86% increase from the intake of &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; on its first day of release. In 10 of the 16 territories, &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; set new opening-day records. These territories are Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, the Philippines, France, and Italy. In Germany, the film surpassed the opening day gross of &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;. It also crushed &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;″s record for scoring the biggest opening day in France, earning $6.8 million. &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; had the third-highest opening of any film in Austria, after &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;. Its Japanese opening generated a total of $3.7 million, making it the country&#x27;s highest Tuesday gross of any film, breaking the former record held by &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot;. Meanwhile, in the UK, the film had the third-highest opening of any film in the country, trailing only behind &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; and &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot;. During its six-day opening weekend (through its first Sunday), the film earned $230.5 million from 107 markets, finishing #1 in all of them. &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; set opening-weekend records in 29 markets including Italy, China, South Korea (the latter was first surpassed by &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot;), India, Singapore, Philippines, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, Taiwan, Indonesia, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Peru. However, many of these records were achieved thanks to its six-day opening, while previous record-holders in some countries opened over the traditional three-day weekend (traditional two-, four-, or five-day weekend in other countries). In India, it grossed $16.4 million and was the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2007 there. Russia and Ukraine both earned $7.4 million from 671 screens, dethroning &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;. Moreover, five Asian countries had overturned a ten-year record that was held by &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;. As for South Korea, &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; crossed over &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; for a local currency mark for a Hollywood release, as well as surpassing &quot;The Host&quot;. In Japan, it earned a total of $26.5 million, kicking the previous record held by &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;. It was ranked in first place at the box office outside North America for three consecutive weekends.

=== Initial critical response ===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; holds approval rating based on reviews, with an average rating of . The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Though there are more characters and plotlines, and the action sequences still dazzle, &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; nonetheless isn&#x27;t quite as refined as the first two.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 59 out of 100 based on 40 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; deplored the film&#x27;s pacing as &quot;mostly just plods&quot; and said it lacked humor. Richard Roeper of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film a two out of four stars, feeling, &quot;for every slam-bang action sequence, there are far too many sluggish scenes&quot;. David Edelstein of &quot;New York&quot; magazine misses the &quot;centrifugal threat&quot; of Alfred Molina&#x27;s character, adding that &quot;the three villains here don&#x27;t add up to one Doc Ock&quot; (referring to Molina&#x27;s portrayal of the character in &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;). James Berardinelli felt director Sam Raimi &quot;overreached his grasp&quot; by allowing so many villains, specifically saying, &quot;Venom is one bad guy too many&quot;. Roger Ebert, who gave &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; a glowing review, gave the sequel two out of four stars and thought Church never expressed how Sandman felt about his new powers, something Molina, as Doc Ock in &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;, did &quot;with a vengeance&quot;; he said the film was &quot;a mess,&quot; with too many villains, subplots, romantic misunderstandings, conversations and &quot;street crowds looking high into the air and shouting &#x27;oooh!&#x27; this way, then swiveling and shouting &#x27;aaah!&#x27; that way&quot;. &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s Anthony Lane, who gave &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; a favorable review, gave the film a negative review, characterizing the film as a &quot;shambles&quot; which &quot;makes the rules up as it goes along&quot;.

Roger Friedman of Fox News called the film a &quot;4-star opera&quot;, noting that while long, there was plenty of humor and action. Andy Khouri of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; praised the film as &quot;easily the most complex and deftly orchestrated superhero epic ever filmed... despite the enormous amount of characters, action and sci-fi superhero plot going on in this film, &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; never feels weighted down, tedious or boring&quot;. Robert Wilonsky of &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; described the film as &quot;overstuffed (three villains), overlong (at more than two hours and 20 minutes) and undercooked (plot points include amnesia and alien goo).&quot; Jonathan Ross, a big fan of the comic books, felt the film was the best of the trilogy. Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; commended the filmmakers for their ability to &quot;dramatize feelings of angst and personal betrayal worthy of an Ingmar Bergman film, and then to dress them up in gaudy comic-book colors&quot;. Wesley Morris of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, who gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, wrote that it was a well-made, fresh film, but would leave the viewer &quot;overfulfilled&quot;. Jonathan Dean of &quot;Total Film&quot; felt the film&#x27;s complex plot helped the film&#x27;s pacing, in that, &quot;it rarely feels disjointed or loose... Spider-Man cements its shelf-life&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; critic Todd Gilchrist felt that the film served as a satisfying conclusion to the series, and ultimately rated it with eight stars out of ten. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named the Sandman as the eighth best computer-generated film character.

John Hartl of MSNBC gave &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; a positive review, but stated that it has some flaws such as having &quot;too many storylines&quot;. His opinion is echoed by &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;″s Amy Biancolli who complained that &quot;the script is busy with so many supporting characters and plot detours that the series&#x27; charming idiosyncrasy is sometimes lost in the noise&quot;. Jack Matthews of &quot;Daily News&quot; thought the film was too devoted to the &quot;quiet conversations&quot; of Peter and Mary Jane, but that fans would not be disappointed by the action. Finally, Sean Burns of &quot;Philadelphia Weekly&quot; felt that the director &quot;substituted scope and scale for the warmth and wit that made those two previous pictures so memorable&quot;.

=== Retrospective assessments ===
Raimi himself would later call the film &quot;awful&quot; during a 2014 interview. In 2018, Avi Arad accepted responsibility for pushing Raimi to include Venom in the film, and how the result had disappointed many fans of the character, saying &quot;I think we learned that Venom is not a sideshow. In all fairness, I&#x27;ll take the guilt because of what Sam Raimi used to say in all of these interviews feeling guilty that I forced him into it&quot;. In 2021, Raimi acknowledged that the negative internet reaction to &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; at the time felt &quot;awful&quot; and had been difficult for him to take, but when his agent told him that he was being considered by Marvel Studios to direct &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&quot; (2022), although initially hesitant about doing another superhero film, he ultimately decided to take the role.

Following its initial mixed reception, &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; has gained widespread meme popularity on social media, becoming the subject of some fan reappraisal as well. Peter Parker&#x27;s corrupted personality under the Venom symbiote has been nicknamed &quot;Bully Maguire&quot; or &quot;Emo Peter Parker&quot; and has helped increase the popularity of the film. During a Reddit AMA when promoting &quot;Babylon&quot;, Maguire acknowledged the memes, finding it a &quot;funny discovery.&quot;

Several media outlets have re-evaluated &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; over the years since its 2007 release. Em Casalena of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; reassessed it as the fifth most underrated superhero film ever made. &quot;MovieWeb&quot; called it the best film that Sam Raimi directed, while &quot;Paste&quot; ranked it the 63rd best superhero movie of all time. The character of Sandman has been particularly praised.

==Accolades==

Both the 35th Annie Awards and 61st British Academy Film Awards gave this movie one nomination, the former for Best Animated Effects and the latter for Best Special Visual Effects. &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; did not win any of the four Visual Effects Society Awards nominations it received. Dunst&#x27;s and Maguire&#x27;s performances earned them each one nomination from the National Movie Awards. She also received another nomination for Favorite Movie Actress from the 2008 Kids&#x27; Choice Awards ceremony. The movie fared better at the Teen Choice Awards, amounting a total of seven nominations, varying from Choice Movie Villain (for Grace) to Choice Movie Dance (for Maguire) and Choice Movie Liplock (shared between Maguire and Dunst).
==Future==
===Cancelled sequels===

In 2007, &quot;Spider-Man 4&quot; entered development, with Raimi attached to direct and Maguire, Dunst and other cast members set to reprise their roles. Both a fourth and a fifth film were planned, and at one time, the idea of shooting the two sequels concurrently was under consideration. Raimi said in March 2009 that only the fourth film was in development at that time and that if there were fifth and sixth films, they would be a continuation of each other. Raimi said that he was unhappy with &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; and wanted &quot;Spider-Man 4&quot; to be &quot;the best of all of them and end on a very high note&quot;. James Vanderbilt was hired in October 2007 to pen the screenplay after initial reports in January 2007 that Sony Pictures was in contact with David Koepp, who wrote the first &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film. The script was subsequently rewritten by Pulitzer-winning playwright David Lindsay-Abaire in November 2008 and rewritten again by Gary Ross in October 2009. Sony also engaged Vanderbilt to write scripts for &quot;Spider-Man 5&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man 6&quot;. A spin-off featuring &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;″s version of the Venom character was also planned; this never materialized, though a &quot;Venom&quot; film featuring a different version of the character was eventually produced and released in 2018.

In 2007, Raimi expressed interest in portraying the transformation of Dr. Curt Connors into his villainous alter ego, the Lizard, a villain who had been teased since &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;; the character&#x27;s actor Dylan Baker and producer Grant Curtis were also enthusiastic about the idea. By December 2009, John Malkovich was in negotiations to play Vulture and Anne Hathaway would play Felicia Hardy, though she would not have transformed into the Black Cat as in the comics but a new superpowered figure, the Vulturess. Raimi later clarified in a 2013 interview that Hathaway would have portrayed Black Cat if &quot;Spider-Man 4&quot; had been made.

Sony Pictures announced in January 2010 that plans for &quot;Spider-Man 4&quot; had been canceled due to Raimi&#x27;s withdrawal from the project. Raimi reportedly ended his participation due to his doubt that he could meet the planned May 6, 2011 release date, while upholding the film creatively. Raimi purportedly went through four iterations of the script with different screenwriters and still &quot;hated it&quot;. Raimi would later say that he couldn&#x27;t get the script in time and that due to his fallings, he told Sony to go ahead with its reboot.

Following the appearance of Tobey Maguire&#x27;s Peter Parker in &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot;, a fan campaign has been trending on Twitter under the name #MakeRaimiSpiderMan4, calling for Sony to make a fourth film in the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; series directed by Sam Raimi with Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst. Raimi later expressed interest in doing so in April 2022, noting that another sequel to his &quot;Spider-Man&quot; trilogy was possible after the introduction of the Multiverse in &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; and his MCU film &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&quot; (2022). He stated the next month that he had no plans to direct &quot;Spider-Man 4&quot; but would do so if offered the opportunity to direct a story he approved of.

===Reboot and unproduced films===

A reboot of the series titled &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; was released on July 3, 2012, with Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker. A sequel, &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&quot;, was released on May 2, 2014.

Following the 2014 Sony Pictures hack, leaked information from the hack indicated that prior to the cancellation of future &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; films, Sony was in talks with Sam Raimi about having him direct &quot;Spider-Man vs. The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, a multiversal crossover film featuring Garfield&#x27;s Spider-Man encounter Tobey Maguire&#x27;s Spider-Man (with Maguire reprising his role), as well as a new film trilogy starring Maguire (following Garfield&#x27;s firing) as a middle-aged Spider-Man years after the events of &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;; these plans were ultimately scrapped in favor of a Marvel Studios-produced reboot set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), beginning with &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; (2016), with Tom Holland cast as Spider-Man.

Sam Raimi directed the Marvel Studios film &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&quot; (2022) which sparked renewed interest from fans in making his unproduced &quot;Spider-Man 4&quot;, a reality.

===Marvel Cinematic Universe===

Following the underwhelming critical and commercial reception of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&quot;, Sony and Marvel Studios announced in February 2015 that a new iteration of Spider-Man would appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with the character appearing in &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot;. As part of the agreement, Sony Pictures continued to finance, distribute, own and have final creative control of the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; films. Marvel Studios and Sony will explore opportunities to integrate other characters of the MCU into future &quot;Spider-Man&quot; films. Sony released a standalone film titled &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot;, produced by Kevin Feige and Amy Pascal, on July 7, 2017, with Tom Holland starring as the new Spider-Man.

&quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021) continues the story arc of the MCU&#x27;s iteration of Spider-Man in addition to using the multiverse to link the Marvel Studios films with Sony Pictures&#x27; preceding &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film franchises from Sam Raimi and Marc Webb. Maguire, Dafoe and Church all reprised their respective roles as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, Norman Osborn / Green Goblin and Flint Marko / Sandman from &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;, appearing in supporting roles alongside other actors from previous films based on the characters outside the MCU&#x27;s cast, including the Sam Raimi trilogy&#x27;s version of Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus from &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;, reprised by Alfred Molina. They are joined by Andrew Garfield, Jamie Foxx and Rhys Ifans, who reprise their respective roles as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, Maxwell Dillon / Electro and Curt Connors / Lizard from Webb&#x27;s &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; films.

<text>Inthawichayanon (; , , , ; , c. 1817 – 23 November 1897) was the 7th Ruler of Chiang Mai and King of Lan Na from 1870 until his death in 1897. His daughter, Princess Dara Rasmi of Chiang Mai became King Rama V&#x27;s Princess Consort. During his reign, the ties of the previously independent tributary state with the central government in Bangkok were intensified, culminating in the creation of the Monthon Phayap in 1892, by which Lan Na was formally annexed.

== Early life ==
Born in 1817 as Prince Inthanon (เจ้าอินทนนท์) to Prince Maha Phrom Khamkhong (เจ้ามหาพรหมคำคง) and Princess Khamla (เจ้าคำหล้า). Inthanon was a grandson of Prince Khamfan, the 3rd ruler of Chiang Mai. 

== King ==
Inthanon married Princess Thip Keson, the eldest daughter of King Kawilorot Suriyawong, granting him the right of succession to the throne. In 1870, he ascended to the throne as King Inthawichayanon. However, the true power resided with his wife, who possessed wisdom and governance skills.

He was concerned about the preservation of the mountain forests in the Thai highlands. Before he died, he ordered that his remains be kept at Doi Luang, the highest mountain of the Thanon Thong Chai Range, which was renamed Doi Inthanon after his death.

In 1883, a rumour that Queen Victoria of Great Britain intended to adopt his daughter, Dara Rasmi, spread from Burma to Chiang Mai and Bangkok. This alarmed the Siamese government of the British desire in Lan Na. The Siamese King sent his brother, Prince Bijitprijakara, to Chiang Mai to forward the King&#x27;s proposal to Dara Rasmi to become the King&#x27;s Princess Consort.

He was only Vassal King in history who awarded Knight of the Order of the Royal House of Chakri.

<text>Buster Brown is a comic-strip character created in 1902 by Richard F. Outcault. Adopted as the mascot of the Brown Shoe Company in 1904, Buster Brown, along with Mary Jane, and with his dog Tige, became well known to the American public in the early 20th century; the character&#x27;s name was applied to a popular style of suit for young boys, the Buster Brown suit, that reflected his outfit.

== Origins ==
The character of Buster Brown was loosely based on Granville Hamilton Fisher, a son of Charles and Anna Fisher of Flushing, New York. Fisher&#x27;s physical appearance, including the characteristic pageboy haircut, was copied by Outcault and given to Buster Brown. The name &quot;Buster&quot; came directly or indirectly from the popularity of Buster Keaton, then a child actor in vaudeville. Another boy, Roger Cushman Clark (1899–1995) of Deadwood, South Dakota, was also described as the &quot;original model&quot; for the Buster Brown character.

The character of Mary Jane was also drawn from real life, as she was also Outcault&#x27;s daughter of the same name. In Outcault&#x27;s own words—and his daughter&#x27;s—she was the only character drawn from life in the Buster Brown strip, although &quot;Mrs. Brown&quot; did resemble Outcault&#x27;s wife.

== Publication history ==

The comic strip began in the &quot;New York Herald&quot; on May 4, 1902. Outcault left for William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s employ in January 1906, and after a court battle, Outcault continued his strip, now nameless, in Hearst papers, while the &quot;Herald&quot; continued their own version of &quot;Buster Brown&quot; with other artists. The latter lasted until January 1911, and Outcault&#x27;s version until May 13, 1923.

The character of Buster Brown inspired many imitators, including Perry Winkle from the &quot;Winnie Winkle&quot; newspaper strip, and the &quot;Bobby Bumps&quot; animated film series.

The series was translated into Portuguese and published in the Brazilian children&#x27;s magazine &quot;O Tico-Tico&quot; (where Buster Brown was known as &quot;Chiquinho&quot;); its stories were loosely adapted by Brazilian writers.

==Characters and story==
===Buster Brown===
Buster Brown is a young city-dwelling boy with wealthy parents. He is disturbingly pretty (contrast him to Outcault&#x27;s own The Yellow Kid, or Frederick Opper&#x27;s creations), but his actions belie his looks. He is a practical joker who might dress in a girl&#x27;s outfit and have her wear his clothes, break a window with his slingshot, or play a prank on a neighbor. The trick or transgression is discovered and he is punished, usually by being spanked by his mother, but it is unclear if he ever repents. Many strips end with Buster delivering a self-justifying moral which has little or nothing to do with his crime. For example, a strip from May 31, 1903, shows him giving Tige a soda from a drugstore soda fountain. The drink splashes, not only the front of his own clothes, but the skirts of a woman&#x27;s splendid dress. Horrified by his clumsy misadventure, Buster&#x27;s mother takes him home and flogs him with a brush. In the last panel the boy has written a message beginning, &quot;Resolved! That druggists are legalized robbers; they sell you soda and candy to make you ill, then they sell you medicine to make you worse.&quot;

===Mary Jane===
Mary Jane is Buster&#x27;s girlfriend.
She is based on R. F. Outcault&#x27;s daughter of the same name.
Her parents are never mentioned, though at many of the comic headers there are letters addressed to her from her mother.
She has curly black hair and brown eyes.
She usually wears a blue, frilly dress, a large bow, and Mary Jane shoes with black stockings.
===Tige===
Tige is thought to be the first talking pet to appear in the comics. Unlike the characters presented under this trope, Tige&#x27;s speech is acknowledged by adults, and many are shocked by this. This popular character was the subject of a book in 1905 with the title, 

== Brown Shoe Company mascot ==
Outcault traveled to the 1904 St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair, selling licenses to up to 200 companies to use the Buster Brown characters to advertise their products. Buster Brown&#x27;s association with shoes began with John Bush, a sales executive with the Brown Shoe Company; he persuaded his company to purchase rights to the Buster Brown name, and the brand was introduced to the public at the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair.

Little people were hired by the Brown Shoe Co. to play Buster in tours around the United States. These actors, each accompanied by a dog, performed in department stores, theaters and shoe stores from 1904 until 1930. Richard Barker played Buster Brown in many of these Brown Shoe Company advertising campaigns; his story is told in a biography called &quot;Buster Brown and the Cowboy&quot;.

In the 1940s and &#x27;50s, the Brown Shoe Company made a foray into the comic book publishing industry with &quot;Buster Brown Comics&quot;, on which a retailer could rubber-stamp their address. The comics featured the characters on the cover, but contained different adventure features, such as Robin Hood.

The characters were revived with an updated, more contemporary look for a brief advertising campaign in the 1980s and 1990s.

== In other media ==
=== Comic books ===
Buster Brown comics were given away as premiums in shoe stores from 1945 to 1959. Some contain art by Reed Crandall and other notable cartoonists. In the 1950s other comics based on the radio show were produced by Custom Comics and Dell Comics, and a coloring book was also produced.

=== Film ===
A series of live-action two-reelers were produced from 1925 to 1929 by the Stern Bros. for Universal Pictures. Buster was played by the actor Arthur Trimble. Pal the Wonder Dog (who played Tige) and director Gus Meins were both later associated with the popular &quot;Our Gang&quot; (Little Rascals) comedies, where Pal at some point came to be known as Pete the Pup, a name inherited by one of his pups, who carried on the role after Pal died of poisoning in 1930.

===Theater===
In 1905, a play was performed on Broadway at the Majestic titled &quot;Buster Brown&quot;. It starred a 21-year-old adult dwarf actor named Master Gabriel (1882–1929), born Gabriel Weigel. Photos of Master Gabriel in the role show him very convincing as a child. Gabriel appeared in another children&#x27;s-oriented play in 1908 &quot;Little Nemo&quot; and a return engagement as Buster Brown in 1913. It also featured famous animal actor George Ali as Tige.

===Radio===
A Buster Brown radio series began in 1943 with Smilin&#x27; Ed McConnell on the West Coast NBC Radio Network. It included such characters as Froggy the Gremlin (&quot;Plunk your magic twanger, Froggy!&quot;) and Midnight the Cat (&quot;What do you say to the kids, Midnight?&quot; &quot;Nice.&quot;)

===Television===
McConnell moved the show to television in 1950, where it ran under the titles &quot;Smilin&#x27; Ed&#x27;s Gang&quot; and &quot;The Buster Brown Show&quot; for four years. Andy Devine took over in 1955 after McConnell&#x27;s death, but Devine&#x27;s show was titled &quot;Andy&#x27;s Gang&quot;.

===Playground games===
Buster Brown makes an appearance in several children&#x27;s playground games. There is a skipping rope rhyme that starts &quot;Buster Brown | Went to town | With his pants | On upside down.&quot; There is also a game played on a seesaw where one rider will stop the seesaw with the other rider in the air and chant, &quot;Buster, Buster, Buster Brown, what will you give me if I let you down?&quot; The rider stuck in the air then offers an imaginary payment of grandiose proportions (e.g., &quot;every Barbie doll ever&quot;, &quot;the Moon and all the stars&quot;).

<text>In geometry, the theorem that the angles opposite the equal sides of an isosceles triangle are themselves equal is known as the pons asinorum ( ), Latin for &quot;bridge of asses&quot;, or more descriptively as the isosceles triangle theorem. The theorem appears as Proposition 5 of Book 1 in Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;. Its converse is also true: if two angles of a triangle are equal, then the sides opposite them are also equal.

&quot;Pons asinorum&quot; is also used metaphorically for a problem or challenge which acts as a test of critical thinking, referring to the &quot;asses&#x27; bridge&#x27;s&quot; ability to separate capable and incapable reasoners. Its first known usage in this context was in 1645.

== Etymology ==

There are two common explanations for the name &quot;pons asinorum&quot;, the simplest being that the diagram used resembles a physical bridge. But the more popular explanation is that it is the first real test in the &quot;Elements&quot; of the intelligence of the reader and functions as a &quot;bridge&quot; to the harder propositions that follow. 

Another medieval term for the isosceles triangle theorem was Elefuga which, according to Roger Bacon, comes from Greek &quot;elegia&quot; &quot;misery&quot;, and Latin &quot;fuga&quot; &quot;flight&quot;, that is &quot;flight of the wretches&quot;. Though this etymology is dubious, it is echoed in Chaucer&#x27;s use of the term &quot;flemyng of wreches&quot; for the theorem.

The name &quot;Dulcarnon&quot; was given to the 47th proposition of Book I of Euclid, better known as the Pythagorean theorem, after the Arabic &quot;Dhū &#x27;l qarnain&quot; ذُو ٱلْقَرْنَيْن, meaning &quot;the owner of the two horns&quot;, because diagrams of the theorem showed two smaller squares like horns at the top of the figure. That term has similarly been used as a metaphor for a dilemma. The name &quot;pons asinorum&quot; has itself occasionally been applied to the Pythagorean theorem.

Carl Friedrich Gauss supposedly once suggested that understanding Euler&#x27;s identity might play a similar role, as a benchmark indicating whether someone could become a first-class mathematician.

== Proofs ==

=== Euclid and Proclus ===

Euclid&#x27;s statement of the &quot;pons asinorum&quot; includes a second conclusion that if the equal sides of the triangle are extended below the base, then the angles between the extensions and the base are also equal. Euclid&#x27;s proof involves drawing auxiliary lines to these extensions. But, as Euclid&#x27;s commentator Proclus points out, Euclid never uses the second conclusion and his proof can be simplified somewhat by drawing the auxiliary lines to the sides of the triangle instead, the rest of the proof proceeding in more or less the same way. 

There has been much speculation and debate as to why Euclid added the second conclusion to the theorem, given that it makes the proof more complicated. One plausible explanation, given by Proclus, is that the second conclusion can be used in possible objections to the proofs of later propositions where Euclid does not cover every case. The proof relies heavily on what is today called side-angle-side (SAS), the previous proposition in the &quot;Elements&quot;, which says that given two triangles for which two pairs of corresponding sides and their included angles are respectively congruent, then the triangles are congruent.

Proclus&#x27; variation of Euclid&#x27;s proof proceeds as follows: Let be an isosceles triangle with congruent sides . Pick an arbitrary point on side and then construct point on to make congruent segments . Draw auxiliary line segments , , and . By side-angle-side, the triangles . Therefore , , and . By subtracting congruent line segments, . This sets up another pair of congruent triangles, , again by side-angle-side. Therefore and . By subtracting congruent angles, . Finally by a third application of side-angle-side. Therefore , which was to be proved.

=== Pappus ===

Proclus gives a much shorter proof attributed to Pappus of Alexandria. This is not only simpler but it requires no additional construction at all. The method of proof is to apply side-angle-side to the triangle and its mirror image. More modern authors, in imitation of the method of proof given for the previous proposition have described this as picking up the triangle, turning it over and laying it down upon itself.
This method is lampooned by Charles Dodgson in &quot;Euclid and his Modern Rivals&quot;, calling it an &quot;Irish bull&quot; because it apparently requires the triangle to be in two places at once.

The proof is as follows: Let &quot;ABC&quot; be an isosceles triangle with &quot;AB&quot; and &quot;AC&quot; being the equal sides. Consider the triangles &quot;ABC&quot; and &quot;ACB&quot;, where &quot;ACB&quot; is considered a second triangle with vertices &quot;A&quot;, &quot;C&quot; and &quot;B&quot; corresponding respectively to &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; in the original triangle. formula_1 is equal to itself, &quot;AB&quot; = &quot;AC&quot; and &quot;AC&quot; = &quot;AB&quot;, so by side-angle-side, triangles &quot;ABC&quot; and &quot;ACB&quot; are congruent. In particular, formula_2.

=== Others ===
A standard textbook method is to construct the bisector of the angle at &quot;A&quot;. This is simpler than Euclid&#x27;s proof, but Euclid does not present the construction of an angle bisector until proposition 9. So the order of presentation of Euclid&#x27;s propositions would have to be changed to avoid the possibility of circular reasoning.

The proof proceeds as follows: As before, let the triangle be &quot;ABC&quot; with &quot;AB&quot; = &quot;AC&quot;. Construct the angle bisector of formula_3 and extend it to meet &quot;BC&quot; at &quot;X&quot;. &quot;AB&quot; = &quot;AC&quot; and &quot;AX&quot; is equal to itself. Furthermore, formula_4, so, applying side-angle-side, triangle &quot;BAX&quot; and triangle &quot;CAX&quot; are congruent. It follows that the angles at &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; are equal.

Legendre uses a similar construction in &quot;Éléments de géométrie&quot;, but taking &quot;X&quot; to be the midpoint of &quot;BC&quot;. The proof is similar but side-side-side must be used instead of side-angle-side, and side-side-side is not given by Euclid until later in the &quot;Elements&quot;.

In 1876, while a member of the United States Congress, future President James A. Garfield developed a proof using the trapezoid, which was published in the &quot;New England Journal of Education&quot;. Mathematics historian William Dunham wrote that Garfield&#x27;s trapezoid work was &quot;really a very clever proof.&quot; According to the &quot;Journal&quot;, Garfield arrived at the proof &quot;in mathematical amusements and discussions with other members of congress.&quot;

== In inner product spaces ==

The isosceles triangle theorem holds in inner product spaces over the real or complex numbers. In such spaces, given vectors &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot;, the theorem says that if formula_5 and formula_6 then formula_7

Since formula_8 and formula_9 where &quot;θ&quot; is the angle between the two vectors, the conclusion of this inner product space form of the theorem is equivalent to the statement about equality of angles.

== Metaphorical usage ==

Uses of the &quot;pons asinorum&quot; as a metaphor for a test of critical thinking include:

* Richard Aungerville&#x27;s 14th century The Philobiblon contains the passage &quot;Quot Euclidis discipulos retrojecit Elefuga quasi scopulos eminens et abruptus, qui nullo scalarum suffragio scandi posset! Durus, inquiunt, est his sermo; quis potest eum audire?&quot;, which compares the theorem to a steep cliff that no ladder may help scale and asks how many would-be geometers have been turned away.
* The term &quot;pons asinorum&quot;, in both its meanings as a bridge and as a test, is used as a metaphor for finding the middle term of a syllogism.
* The 18th-century poet Thomas Campbell wrote a humorous poem called &quot;Pons asinorum&quot; where a geometry class assails the theorem as a company of soldiers might charge a fortress; the battle was not without casualties.
* Economist John Stuart Mill called Ricardo&#x27;s Law of Rent the &quot;pons asinorum&quot; of economics.
* The Finnish &quot;aasinsilta&quot; and Swedish &quot;åsnebrygga&quot; is a literary technique where a tenuous, even contrived connection between two arguments or topics, which is almost but not quite a non sequitur, is used as an awkward transition between them. In serious text, it is considered a stylistic error, since it belongs properly to the stream of consciousness- or causerie-style writing. Typical examples are ending a section by telling what the next section is about, without bothering to explain why the topics are related, expanding a casual mention into a detailed treatment, or finding a contrived connection between the topics (e.g. &quot;We bought some red wine; speaking of red liquids, tomorrow is the World Blood Donor Day&quot;).
* In Dutch, &quot;ezelsbruggetje&quot; (&#x27;little bridge of asses&#x27;) is the word for a mnemonic. The same is true for the German &quot;Eselsbrücke&quot;.
* In Czech, &quot;oslí můstek&quot; has two meanings – it can describe either a contrived connection between two topics or a mnemonic.

== Artificial intelligence proof myth ==

A persistent piece of mathematical folklore claims that an artificial intelligence program discovered an original and more elegant proof of this theorem. In fact, Marvin Minsky recounts that he had rediscovered the Pappus proof (which he was not aware of) by simulating what a mechanical theorem prover might do.

* on the southwest by Fowler Road and Mill Cove;
* on the west by Grand Lake;
* on the northwest by a line running through the Northeast Arm of Grand Bay, then up Coal Creek past the mouth of the South Branch Coal Creek to the southeastern corner of a grant to Malcolm Carmichael at a stretch called the Round Turns, then northeasterly parallelling the southeastern line of the parish to the county line;
* including Goat Island in Grand Lake.

** Northeast Arm
==Islands==
Islands at least partly within the parish.
* Goat Island

==Other notable places==
Parks, historic sites, and other noteworthy places at least partly within the parish.
* Partridge Valley West Protected Natural Area
* West Branch Coy Brook Protected Natural Area

==Demographics==
Parish population total does not include portion within Cambridge-Narrows

<text>Thomas Worthington (July 16, 1773June 20, 1827) was an American politician who served as the sixth governor of Ohio.

==Early life==
Worthington was born in Berkeley County near Charles Town in the Colony of Virginia. In 1796, he married a Virginia woman, Eleanor Swearingen, who joined him in emigrating to Ross County, Ohio, where they emancipated their slaves. Worthington was of English descent, and his ancestors were loyalists during the reign of King Charles. The home they eventually built just outside Chillicothe was called Adena and is the namesake of the Adena culture. The first of their ten children, daughter Mary, married David Macomb, a future leader of the Texas Revolution. A son, also Thomas, graduated from West Point in 1827, held the rank of Brigadier General in the Ohio Militia, and later fought in the Mexican-American War and Civil War.

==Career==
He served in the Territorial House of Representatives from 1799 to 1803 and served as a Ross county delegate to the State Constitutional Convention in 1802. He was a leader of the Chillicothe Junto, a group of Chillicothe Democratic-Republican politicians who brought about the admission of Ohio as a state in 1803 and largely controlled its politics for some years thereafter. Among his colleagues in the faction were Nathaniel Massie and Edward Tiffin.

Worthington was elected one of Ohio&#x27;s first Senators in 1803, serving until 1807. He was returned to the Senate in December 1810 upon the resignation of Return J. Meigs, Jr. and served until December 1814, when he resigned after winning election to the governorship. On June 17, 1812, he voted &quot;No&quot; on the resolution to declare war on Britain, but the vote in favor of war was 19 to 13. He won re-election as governor two years later, moving the state capital from Chillicothe to Columbus. Worthington did not seek re-election in 1818.

He platted what would become the city of Logan, Ohio in 1816.

In January 1819, when the election was held to replace the retiring Jeremiah Morrow in the Senate, he held the lead through the first three ballots, only losing when factions aligned behind William A. Trimble on the fourth and final ballot. He narrowly lost a bid for a partial term in the Senate in 1821, losing to the incumbent governor, Ethan Allen Brown, and so he instead returned to the Ohio House of Representatives.

After being the runner-up in the 1808 and 1810 gubernatorial elections, he won the 1814 and 1816 elections by landslide margins. Both times he nearly reached three-quarters of the vote. After two terms he stepped down as governor.

==Death==
Worthington was initially buried at his estate in Adena, and was later interred at Grandview Cemetery, Chillicothe, Ross County, Ohio.

==Legacy==
Worthington is a member of the Ohio Hall Of Fame. The city of Worthington, Ohio, was named in Worthington&#x27;s honor, as was Thomas Worthington High School.

Worthington is known as the &quot;Father of the Ohio statehood&quot;.

<doc id="702169" wikidata="Q4780959" url="?curid=702169" title="Appeal (cricket)">
<text>In cricket, an appeal (locally known as a &quot;Howzat&quot;) is the act of a player (or players) on the fielding team asking an umpire for a decision regarding whether a batter is out or not. According to Law 31 of the Laws of Cricket, an umpire will not rule a batter out unless the fielding side appeals for a decision. An appeal covers all forms of dismissal, regardless of what the fielding team believes they are appealing for. On occasions when a batter has otherwise technically been out, the fielding team has not realised, so did not appeal, and so the umpire has not declared them out. An appeal may be made at any point before the bowler starts their run-up for the next ball.

==Cricket rules==
According to the Laws of Cricket, an appeal is a verbal query, usually in the form of, &quot;How&#x27;s that?&quot; to an umpire. Since the taking of a wicket is an important event in the game, members of the fielding team often shout this phrase with great enthusiasm, and it has transmuted into the slightly abbreviated form, &quot;Howzat?&quot;, often with a greatly extended final syllable. Sometimes one or other syllable is omitted entirely, the player emitting an elongated cry of simply &quot;How?&quot; or &quot;Zat?&quot;. Sometimes, players may turn to the umpire and simply just shout or cheer. Players often also raise their arms or point towards the umpire as part of the appeal.

Although technically an appeal is required for the umpire to make a decision, in practice it is often obvious to all that a batter is out, and the batter may &quot;walk&quot; off the field without waiting for the decision of the umpire. This is often the case when a batter is bowled or obviously caught. However, the batter is always entitled to stand their ground and wait for a decision from the umpire. In cases where they consider they might not be out, such as a catch taken low near the grass or where it is not clear whether the ball hit the bat, batsmen will not take the walking option. It is then up to the fielding team to appeal for a decision. Sometimes a batter will walk even when it is not clear to others that they are out, if they know that they are. According to a common convention, this is considered to be the epitome of sportsmanship but, by another, it is potentially even disrespectful to the umpire to pre-empt their decision by walking. 

==Decisions==
Some decisions, such as leg before wicket, almost always require an appeal from the fielding side and the umpire&#x27;s decision, as a batter will rarely preempt the umpire on what, in practice, requires fine judgment of several factors. Run-outs and stumpings are usually appealed and are decided by an umpire, unless the batter is very clearly out of their ground and obviously out. 

Appealing is a verbal demand to the umpires that is mandatory to obtain a decision within the Laws of the game, and differs from sledging, which is voluntary, usually unwelcome, directed to the opposition team, and often intended to be offensive, intimidating or directly taunting to them.

==Unsportsmanlike appealing==
Under the ICC Cricket Code of Conduct for the international professional game, it is considered unsportsmanlike to appeal excessively, i.e. 
* repeatedly for the same decision
* repeatedly over time to pressurise the umpires, especially when the player knows that the batter is not out
* moving in an intimidating manner towards an umpire
* celebrating without appealing, when an appeal is needed

Any such behaviour is considered a breach of the Spirit of Cricket and an offence that may result in warnings, penalty runs, even ultimately suspension or removal from the field of play -all as adjudicated and imposed by the umpires, and/or fines or match bans, as adjudicated and imposed by the match referee.

The Code does not disbar excitable action such as loud or enthusiastic appealing.

Under the standard Laws of Cricket that apply at all levels of the game unless modified, an equivalent on-field regime exists, but without such a precise codification of &#x27;excessive appealing,&#x27; It is covered by Law 42.2.1 para 5 and 6. 

In all codes of the game, continued appealing after the umpire has made the decision of &#x27;not out&#x27; may be adjudged dissent, and dealt with even more seriously under Law 42.

==Examples of Fielding Side Failing to Appeal==
Due to the manner of how other dismissals are achieved, it is the Run out and Stumping that are the common examples of a team failing to appeal. Sachin Tendulkar was once stumped whilst out of his ground in a match against England, but England failed to appeal, and he scored another 57 runs to finish on 91. In 2024 Australia playing the West Indies failed to appeal, or failed to appeal loudly enough for one of the umpires to hear, for a clear run-out by Spencer Johnson against Alzarri Joseph that would have ended the game, but had ultimately no impact due to the lopsided score line at the time. Shane Warne scored 5 runs against the Zimbabwean cricket team in Perth for the 1994–95 Australian Tri-Series. Four of them came when Warne blocked the ball back down the pitch to Heath Streak who threw down Warne&#x27;s stumps, sending the ball flying to the boundary. In the disappointment of giving away the boundary 4, none of the Zimbabwean players appealed. Warne was caught out shortly after, and eventually Mark Waugh, batting down the order due to injury and Damien Fleming closed out the game for a win.

<text>Charles Evans Whittaker (February 22, 1901 – November 26, 1973) was an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court from 1957 to 1962. After working in private practice in Kansas City, Missouri, he was nominated for the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri. In 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower nominated Whittaker to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. In 1957, he won confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States, thus becoming the first individual to serve as a judge on a federal district court, a federal court of appeals, and the United States Supreme Court. During his brief tenure on the Warren Court, Whittaker emerged as a swing vote. In 1962, he had a nervous breakdown and resigned from the Court. After leaving the Supreme Court, he served as chief counsel to General Motors and frequently criticized the Civil Rights Movement and the Warren Court.

==Early years and career==

Whittaker was born on a farm near Troy, Kansas to Charles Edward Whittaker, a farmer, and Ida Eve Miller, a schoolteacher from Hagerstown, Maryland. He attended the nearby one-room Brush Creek School, and then the Troy High School until he dropped out in the ninth grade after his mother died on his sixteenth birthday. He spent the next three years working on a family farm, and also hunting and trapping. Whittaker developed an interest in law by reading newspaper articles about criminal trials. In the summer of 1920, he applied to the part-time evening program at the Kansas City School of Law (currently the University of Missouri–Kansas City School of Law) and gained admission with the condition that he would finish his high school education after personally pleading with Oliver Dean, the president of the law school. He immediately enrolled at Manual High School in Kansas City, Missouri and spent the next four years working during the day to support himself, while taking high school and law school courses in the evenings. Whittaker&#x27;s law school classmates included future President Harry S. Truman. Whittaker graduated in the class of 1924 with a Bachelor of Laws having been admitted to the Missouri bar during his senior year. Whittaker joined the law firm of Watson, Ess, Marshall &amp; Enggas in Kansas City, Missouri, where he previously worked full-time as an office boy, and built up a practice in corporate law with the Union Pacific Railroad, Montgomery Ward, and the City National Bank and Trust Company among his clients. He was a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity and developed close ties to the Republican Party.

==Federal judicial service (District Court and Court of Appeals)==

Whittaker was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on May 11, 1954, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri vacated by Judge Albert L. Reeves. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on July 7, 1954, and received his commission the next day. His service terminated on June 21, 1956, due to his elevation to the Eighth Circuit.

Whittaker was nominated by President Eisenhower on March 16, 1956, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit vacated by Judge John Caskie Collet. He was confirmed by the Senate on June 4, 1956, and received his commission the next day. His service terminated on March 24, 1957, due to his elevation to the Supreme Court of the United States.

==Supreme Court==

Whittaker was nominated by President Eisenhower on March 2, 1957, as an associate justice of the Supreme Court, to succeed Stanley Forman Reed. He was confirmed by the Senate on March 19, 1957, by a unanimous vote. Whittaker took the judicial oath of office on March 25, 1957. He thus became the first person to serve as a judge of a United States District Court, a United States Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court of the United States. Samuel Blatchford also served at all three levels of the federal judiciary, but the court system was configured slightly differently at that time. Ketanji Brown Jackson is the most recent justice to have served in all three levels of the federal judiciary. Whittaker served as Circuit Justice of the Eighth Circuit and the Tenth Circuit for his duration of service on the Supreme Court.

On the closely divided Supreme Court, Whittaker was a swing vote. According to Professor Howard Ball, Whittaker was an &quot;extremely weak, vacillating justice&quot; who was &quot;courted by the two cliques on the Court because his vote was generally up in the air and typically went to the group that made the last, but not necessarily the best, argument.&quot; Whittaker failed to develop a consistent judicial philosophy and reportedly felt himself not as qualified as some of the other members of the Court. After agonizing deeply for months over his vote in &quot;Baker v. Carr&quot;, a landmark reapportionment case, Whittaker suffered a nervous breakdown in the spring of 1962. At the behest of Chief Justice Earl Warren, Whittaker recused himself from the case and retired from the Court effective March 31, 1962 due to a certified disability, citing exhaustion from the heavy workload and stress.

As of 2025, Whittaker remains the only Supreme Court Justice appointed from Missouri. He is also the most recently appointed Justice to have received his legal education from a public law school.

==Final years==

Effective September 30, 1965, Whittaker resigned his position as a retired Justice in order to become chief counsel to General Motors. He also became a resolute critic of the Warren Court as well as the Civil Rights Movement, characterizing the civil disobedience of the type practiced by Martin Luther King Jr. and his followers as lawless. He wrote a piece for the &quot;FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin&quot; that advised protesters to use courts instead of taking to the streets.

<doc id="702174" wikidata="Q889390" url="?curid=702174" title="Nathan Brownson">
<text>Nathan Brownson (May 14, 1742 – November 6, 1796) was an American physician and statesman. He served Georgia as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1777 and as the Governor of Georgia in 1781. Nathan Brownson was a member of the Society of the Cincinnati of the State of Georgia.

==Early life==

Brownson was born in Woodbury, Connecticut, the sixth of ten children born to Timothy (1701–1766) and Abgail Jenner (1707–1784). He graduated from Yale in 1761 and practiced medicine in his hometown. In 1769 he married Elizabeth Lewis. The couple moved to St. John Parish, Georgia, in 1774 and began working a 500-acre plantation near Savannah. He settled in Liberty County, Georgia in 1764 and began his medical practice. Brownson’s wife died in 1775, and the following year he married Elizabeth McLean, with whom he had two children.

==Revolutionary War==

In 1774, St. John Parish was a hotbed of revolutionary activity; many of its people were New England Congregationalists by way of Dorchester, South Carolina, a settlement on the Ashley River above Charlestown that had been founded by Puritans from Massachusetts. Brownson and another transplanted Connecticut physician, Lyman Hall, were among the eleven delegates chosen to represent the parish at the provincial congress, which met in Savannah in July 1775. Both men were elected to represent Georgia in the Second Continental Congress; Brownson served from January to May 1777 and again from late August to early October of the same year.

The British invasion of Georgia in the final days of 1778 was part of the southern theater of the revolution, but with the expulsion of the king’s troops from Augusta in June 1781, factional disputes threatened to spoil the victory. At this critical moment Brownson, then acting as deputy purveyor of hospitals in the South, was dispatched to Georgia with a brigadier’s commission from Congress. He initially served as Speaker of the House of Representatives, before a compromise was worked out whereby Brownson became governor and John Twiggs was promoted to brigadier general. Brownson congratulated General Nathanael Greene for his efforts to restore civil government in Georgia.

Brownson&#x27;s term as governor during the last few months of 1781 was filled with dealing with hostile Creek Indians and bands of Tories that roamed the countryside. Commandant of Spanish Pensacola, Florida, Arturo O&#x27;Neill wrote to Gov. Brownson on Nov. 18, 1781, indicating his suspicions regarding attempts of British traders in the area to gain favor with the Indians by securing presents for them. Brownson talked to the upper and lower Creek Nation and accused them of making an unsuccessful attack against American soldiers and of holding American traders, commissaries, and property. He told them that the Americans desire friendship, and threatened them with reprisal if they did not submit.

During the decade following the war, Brownson served the public almost continuously as justice of the peace, as a commissioner for erecting a new capital in Louisville, as a member of the convention that ratified the federal constitution, as a delegate to the convention that drafted the state constitution in 1788, and as the first president of the Georgia Senate. He was appointed by Congress as deputy purveyor of hospitals and later to the charge of the southern hospitals. He was one of the trustees for the establishment of Franklin College, later called the University of Georgia.

==Death and legacy==

Brownson died at his plantation in 1796 in Riceboro, Georgia and was buried in Midway Cemetery in Midway, Georgia. Although his career was not as distinguished as some others of Georgia’s founding fathers, Brownson’s service at crucial periods helped the state transcend factional bickering and focus on the improvement of society.

<doc id="702179" wikidata="Q3202275" url="?curid=702179" title="Redemption Ark">
<text>Redemption Ark is a 2002 science fiction novel by Welsh author Alastair Reynolds set in the Revelation Space universe. It continues the story of Nevil Clavain begun in the short stories &quot;Great Wall of Mars&quot; and &quot;Glacial&quot;.

==Plot==
The novel takes place around the planets Yellowstone and Resurgam, in two story lines which converge near the climax of the novel.

===Yellowstone===
The novel begins in the year 2605, where Skade has been tasked with investigating a Conjoiner ship that has returned to the Conjoiner headquarters, the Mother Nest. Skade is a Conjoiner woman who appears to be in touch with secret circles of control within the theoretically egalitarian Conjoiners society. In the ship, she discovers Galiana, the original founder of the Conjoiners, who left Conjoiner space decades previously on an exploration mission. In space, Galiana had encountered the Inhibitors, who unleashed an agent into her ships, seized control, and killed her crew. It now controls her mind as well. Galiana requests that Skade kill her, but Skade only places her in suspended animation in the hope that she can be helped in the future.

Ten years later, Nevil Clavain is facing problems in the Conjoiner mother nest; he is struggling to find answers about what happened to Galiana, whether she is still alive, and about Felka, who he believes may be his and Galiana&#x27;s daughter. He ponders these concerns during a mission when he ends up rescuing Antoinette Bax as she flies her freighter through the top of the atmosphere of the gas giant Tangerine Dream, to fulfill her promise to her late father to bury him there. Clavain warns her that if he ever sees her again, he&#x27;ll kill her. Her ship severely damaged, Bax limps back to the Rust Belt, a ring of orbital habitats around Yellowstone, to rejoin her lover, the ship&#x27;s mechanic.

When Clavain and Skade return to the Mother Nest, Skade, Remontoire, and Felka convince Clavain to join the Conjoiner&#x27;s leadership, which Clavain had been resisting. Skade informs him about the threat of the Inhibitors and convinces him to undertake a mission to reclaim a cache of lost Conjoiner doomsday weapons. She shows him the fleet of advanced starships that the Conjoiners have been building in secret. 

Although Skade claims that she will use the weapons and ships to defend humanity against the Inhibitors, Clavain is convinced that they will simply evacuate and abandon the rest of humanity. Clavain defects to the Demarchists at Yellowstone and spreads the news of the Inhibitors, and also enlists Antoinette Bax&#x27;s help to escape the Conjoiners under Skade who are pursuing him.

Clavain is followed by Scorpio and Remontoire, but they along with Antoinette and Clavain are captured by the mysterious underground figure known as &quot;H&quot;. H reveals what happened to Skade during a Conjoiner raid into Chasm City. This was when Skade discovered the secrets that would lead her to develop inertia suppression technology, and when H believes she was subverted by an alien intellect. Clavain reveals Skade&#x27;s plans for the Conjoiner fleet and the cache weapons, and H agrees to help him beat Skade to them. H supplies ships and his own version of the inertial suppression technology, while Scorpio supplies an army of hyper-pigs for the pursuit.

Skade and Clavain race to the Resurgam system by employing various strategies, including inertia suppression that pushes their ships to faster relativistic speeds. Eventually, Skade&#x27;s vessel is damaged in an attempt to use an advanced technology to exceed the speed of light, and she witnesses the death of a crew member trapped in a collapsing bubble.

===Resurgam===

Several years later (roughly 50 from the start of the events in the book), Triumvir Ilia Volyova and Ana Khouri are on the planet Resurgam and have discovered a new threat to life: the Inhibitors. Alerted to the presence of humanity during events described in &quot;Revelation Space&quot;, these swarms of intelligent machines have begun dismantling several rocky moons across the system and are moving their components towards the gas giant, Roc. Volyova and Khouri resolve to evacuate the population of Resurgam, 200,000 people, by posing as government agents to enlist the rebel Thorn in their cause, since he has been attempting to evacuate Resurgam all along. They must also open communications with Captain John Brannigan who is in direct control of their ship, the &quot;Nostalgia for Infinity&quot;, since his mind and body have fused with the ship&#x27;s systems, due to the nanotechnological Melding Plague. Volyova tries speaking to the Captain to grant her control of the cache weapons as the last resort against the Inhibitors. (These are the same weapons that Clavain is sent to recover for the Conjoiners. During the events in the novel &quot;Revelation Space&quot;, Volyova activates the weapons, which allows the Conjoiners in Yellowstone to determine their location.) Volyova persuades Captain Brannigan to let the people evacuate onto the ship, as an ark, that could redeem his past transgressions.

In space, Clavain and Scorpio board Skade&#x27;s ship to save Felka. Clavain and Scorpio plant explosives as a contingency. After finding Felka but failing to liberate Galiana, they depart and watch Skade&#x27;s ship explode from a far distance, as Clavain mourns his loss of Galiana.

On Resurgam, Volyova, Khouri, and Thorn begin the lengthy evacuation and preparation of their ship, while the Inhibitors continue their mysterious construction project, suspected to target the system&#x27;s star. Only a few thousand people are evacuated when the Inhibitors approach Resurgam&#x27;s star so closely that Volyova scrambles to deploy the cache weapons, in the hope to buy more time. A beta-level simulation of Clavain arrives as data in a laser transmission, and negotiates with Volyova to turn over the cache weapons to him when he arrives on the ship &quot;Zodiacal Light&quot;. Volyova rejects his persuasive arguments and explains that her need for the weapons is greater than his, so she returns to work on deploying them.

When &quot;Zodiacal Light&quot; arrives in the system, and because of the failure of his beta-level to negotiate a handover from Volyova, Clavain attacks &quot;Nostalgia for Infinity&quot; and uses Scorpio and his loyal hyper-pigs as a boarding party. Clavain&#x27;s superior force captures &quot;Nostalgia for Infinity&quot;, although Volyova is able to damage &quot;Zodiacal Light&quot; with one of the cache weapons. The two sides negotiate terms, with Clavain and his crew taking command of Volyova&#x27;s ship. 

They evacuate the colonists more quickly with the help of Antoinette Bax&#x27; freighter, &quot;Storm Bird&quot;. Clavain finds Volyova dying from injuries she sustained when Captain Brannigan attempted to commit suicide by turning a cache weapon against the ship. Volyova makes a final deal with Clavain to take half of the remaining cache weapons and &quot;Storm Bird&quot; to mount a last-ditch attack on the Inhibitors. Bax bids a teary farewell to the mysterious beta-level simulation that has operated &quot;Storm Bird&quot; and watched over her, as he says he may find redemption in his last mission with Volyova.

The Inhibitors use their alien technology, built from the matter harvested from the gas giant, Roc, to pierce the layers of Resurgam&#x27;s star and expose its nuclear fusion core. The radiation energy blasts Resurgam, destroys all its life, and reduces it to a cinder.

Later, Clavain learns Volyova&#x27;s final attack had no effect. He discovers that Skade narrowly survived their space battle. Clavain reaffirms his goal to return the cache weapons to humanity, since they are their creators and true owners. Skade vows to pursue him and seek vengeance for his defection.

Remontoire and Khouri remain in the system aboard the &quot;Zodiacal Light&quot; to contact Dan Sylveste in the Hades Matrix (seen in the final events of &quot;Revelation Space&quot;) in the hopes that he may provide knowledge they can use to fight the Inhibitors.

The novel ends as &quot;Nostalgia for Infinity&quot; lands vertically in the seawater of on an unnamed Pattern Juggler planet, where the crew and rescued people of Resurgam, all except 40,000, establish a new colony (in the following novel of the series &quot;Absolution Gap&quot;, the planet is called Ararat). However, the crew is unsure why the Captain/ship chose that planet as a destination. Clavain estimates they&#x27;ll need about 20 years to wait for the &quot;Zodiacal Light&quot; to catch up with them so they can resume the fight against the Inhibitors. 

Felka reveals her true relationship to Clavain and how his lover Galiana visited this planet hundreds of years ago, where she may have uploaded her mind into the Pattern Jugglers in the ocean. Felka believes Galiana somehow planted the location of the planet without revealing it to the Inhibitors. Clavain and Felka walk toward the shore with renewed hope.

===Inhibitor Asides===

In addition to the two plot lines there are occasional asides explaining the history and motivation of the Inhibitors. These asides explain the galaxy was once filled with star-faring civilizations. Those civilizations were largely destroyed in the &quot;Dawn War&quot;, a galaxy-wide conflict over the galaxy&#x27;s scarce resources. One of these civilizations determines that a collision between our galaxy and another will occur in 3 billion years and create/become the Inhibitors in order to shepherd intelligent life through this cataclysm. They had determined that collision could be most easily dealt with if intelligent life was kept isolated to individual star systems, leaving the Inhibitors to perform any necessary manipulations of stars and planets to reduce the damage caused by the collision.

The asides also reveal that the Inhibitors were not as brutal in their past, but their performance has degraded over the millennia. They have been detecting civilizations at later stages, and required to commit wholesale extinction more often.

Clavain and Felka learn of this history during communication with the Inhibitors in Galiana&#x27;s head. Clavain, however, is not convinced that the Inhibitors are right about the coming catastrophe and believes that their degrading performance may give humanity a chance for survival that other species have not had. As such, he rejects the Inhibitor requests to stand down.

The future collision of our galaxy with the Andromeda Galaxy is a scientifically predicted event. However, astronomers believe that it would not cause major damage to the capability of the galaxy to support life because galaxies are so diffuse that very few, if any, planets and stars would collide.

<doc id="702182" wikidata="Q2093821" url="?curid=702182" title="Washakie">
<text>Washakie (1804/1810 – February 20, 1900) was a prominent leader of the Shoshone people during the mid-19th century. He was first mentioned in 1840 in the written record of the American fur trapper, Osborne Russell. In 1851, at the urging of trapper Jim Bridger, Washakie led a band of Shoshones to the council meetings of the Treaty of Fort Laramie. Essentially from that time until his death, he was considered the head of the Eastern Shoshones by the representatives of the United States government. In 1979, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum.

==Early life==
Much about Washakie&#x27;s early life remains unknown, but some information is revealed. Washakie was born between 1798 and 1810. His mother Lost Woman, was a Tussawehee (White Knife) Shoshone by birth. His father, Crooked Leg (Paseego), was an Umatilla rescued as a boy from slave traders at Wakemap and Celilo in 1786 by Weasel Lungs, a Tussawehee dog soldier (White Knife) Shoshone medicine man. Crooked Leg was adopted into Weasel Lungs&#x27; clan. He became a Tussawehee dog soldier (White Knife) and married Weasel Lungs&#x27; eldest daughter Lost Girl, later Lost Woman. His maternal grandmother, Chosro (Bluebird), was also Tussawehee by birth. Lost Woman&#x27;s younger sister, Washakie&#x27;s aunt, was Nanawu (Little Striped Squirrel). She was the mother of Chochoco (Has No Horse), a first cousin to Washakie. On September 9, 1860, settlers under Elijah Utter were killed on the Oregon Trail by Shoshone and Bannack. Zachias Van Ornum, a relative of those killed, believed a white boy among the Shoshone was his nephew Reuben Van Ornum and took him away; the Shoshone protested that the boy was the son of a sister of Washakie and a French trapper. 

Washakie&#x27;s birth name was Pinaquanah (&quot;Smells of Sugar&quot;). He had other names before being called Washakie. When he was a teenager, he changed his name to Shoots the Buffalo Running. He was a high-stakes gambler, playing a game involving shaking small stones inside of a gourd rattle, rather like dice, so his friends renamed him Gourd Rattler.

Smells of Sugar met his first &quot;white men&quot; in 1811. Wilson Hunt&#x27;s main party of Astorians, with the Pacific Fur brigade, were traveling down the Boise River from the mouth of the Bruneau River. Seven months late for their scheduled arrival at Fort Astoria, they happened into Crooked Leg&#x27;s camp on the Boise. They needed horses, which Crooked Leg refused to sell to them; instead reluctantly selling them a few camas roots, dried fish, and four dogs.

Crooked Leg was killed in 1824 by members of the Piegan Blackfeet when they raided a Shoshone hunting camp inside the Blackfoot hunting Boundary. Every able-bodied Shoshone was following and hunting the migrating herds of game, as bison were now scarce in the Ochoco and the rest of the southern Blue Mountains, and food was in short supply. There had been a weak truce in the summer of 1820, between Fires Black Gun (Tooite Coon), (also known to white men as Cameahwait and Comeah Wait, brother to Sacajawea), and Piegan Blackfoot leader, Ugly Head. The Shoshone had been hunting high in the Montana Rockies, well north of the southern boundary of the Blackfoot hunting grounds, for any game they could find. A Piegan war party, led by Large Kidney and Four Horns, burst into one of their encampments on the Boulder River, to find Shoshone head chief Owitze (Twisted Hand), his war leader Red Wolf, and the popular young leader of the Tussawehee White Knife dog soldiers, Po&#x27;have (The Horse). Fighting ensued. Washakie, by now in his late teens and riding with the dog soldiers, led by Weahwewa (Wolf Dog), was moving north out of Wyoming country with a weapons shipment of Mexican guns from Comanche leader Shaved Head, and overheard the disturbance. Crooked Leg was camped a few miles away and Washakie immediately got word to him of the attack. When Crooked Leg arrived on the battle scene, he was killed.

The hunting ceased and the dog soldiers went on the war trail, backed by Comanche war chief Red Sleeves and his reinforcements. They combed the Boulder, the Yellowstone, and the Musselshell for Blackfoot and killed many. This victory by the Shoshone led to a council with the Blackfeet tribes, with the Shoshone once again a proud warrior society. At the council, it was agreed that the Blackfeet tribes would join forces with the Shoshone to restrict the expanding encroachment of trappers into each tribes&#x27; hunting grounds.

By the late 19th century, Washakie became head chief of the Eastern Shoshone. He was the only Shoshone warrior to be honored by the federal government of the United States, for leading General George Crook&#x27;s army to defeat the Sioux, after Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer&#x27;s defeat at the Little Big Horn.

The year of Washakie&#x27;s birth date is debated. A missionary in 1883 recorded the year of his birth as 1798, but his tombstone was later inscribed with a birth date of 1804. Late in his life he told an agent at the Shoshone Agency that when he was 16, he had met Jim Bridger. Interpolating from the age of Bridger when he first went into the wilderness, researchers have determined that Washakie was likely born between 1808 and 1810. During his early childhood, the Blackfeet Indians attacked a combined camp of Flathead and Lemhi people while the latter were on a buffalo hunt near Three Forks, Gallatin County, Montana (where the Gallatin, Madison, and Jefferson Rivers form the headwaters of the Missouri River). After Crooked Leg was killed, his mother and at least one sister were able to make their way back to the Lemhis on the Salmon River in Idaho. During the attack, Washakie was lost and possibly wounded. According to some family traditions, he was found by either Bannock Indians who had also come to hunt in the region, or by a combined Shoshone and Bannock band. He may have become the adopted son of the band leader. For the next twenty five years (c. 1815–1840) he learned the traditions and ways of a warrior that were typical of any Shoshone youth of that period.

Although the name by which he would be widely known has been translated in various ways, it apparently dealt with his tactics in battle. One story describes how Washakie devised a large rattle by placing stones in an inflated and dried balloon of buffalo hide, which he tied on a stick. He carried the device into battle to frighten enemy horses, earning the name &quot;The Rattle&quot; or &quot;Gourd Rattler&quot;. Another translation of &quot;Washakie&quot; is &quot;Shoots-on-the-Run.&quot;

==War deeds==

Fur trapper records of the 1830s describe Washakie as being feared by the Blackfeet. He had a life-long scar on his cheek from an arrow that was inflicted by an enemy during a raid. When as an older man his authority was questioned by fellow Eastern Shoshone, Washakie sought to reconfirm his prowess as a warrior to maintain his status. He disappeared for many days, then returned having singlehandedly secured several scalps of his enemies, a daring feat for a man of any age.

In 1866, Washakie fought one-on-one with Crow Chief Big Robber to end a stalemate over rights to occupy the Wind River Basin, which the Crow claimed through the 1851 Horse Creek Treaty of Fort Laramie, though the area had long been used by the Shoshone. Washakie emerged victorious and displayed his enemy&#x27;s heart on a lance. This event is memorialized in the place name of Crowheart Butte on the Wind River Indian Reservation, though the actual battle took place along a nearby draw. In 2005 a sculpture of the event was unveiled at the University of Wyoming&#x27;s Washakie Dining Center in Laramie.

==Fur trade==

Washakie&#x27;s band evidently participated in the fur trade rendezvous (1825–1840), since those rendezvous took place within the Green River, Wind River, and Snake River regions claimed by the horse-owning and buffalo-hunting Shoshone and Bannock bands of eastern Idaho. Late in life, Washakie reported that he and Jim Bridger became fast friends, and indeed, Bridger became Washakie&#x27;s son-in-law in 1850 when he took Washakie&#x27;s daughter as his third wife. Bridger, born March 17, 1804, entered Shoshone country in 1824 (Washakie said Bridger was the older of the two). Washakie learned French and some English from trappers and traders. Washakie&#x27;s close association with the trappers developed into a similar relationship with U.S. officials.

==Fort Bridger Treaties==
In 1863, and again in 1868, he signed treaties with the U.S. at Fort Bridger, Wyoming. The established a generic Shoshone country, whose borders extended eastward to the crest of the Wind River Mountains, south to the Uintah Mountains of Utah, and on the northern side, to the crest of the Bitterroots. The western border was left undefined, but was understood to include most of the Snake River as far as the Oregon border. This treaty included a number of Shoshone and Bannock Indian bands besides that of Washakie. The was established at the Fort Bridger Treaty Council of 1868 and it proved more significant, for it established the Shoshone and Bannock Indian Agency located in west-central Wyoming. Moreover, this was land selected by Washakie and his headmen of the Eastern Shoshones. The initial reservation included about in Wyoming&#x27;s Wind River country for his people. Although an 1872 land cession reduced the size by , this valley remains the home of the Eastern Shoshones today. He was also determined that Native Americans should be educated, and he gave land to Welsh clergyman John Roberts to establish a boarding school where Shoshone girls learned traditional crafts and language.

==Washakie and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints==

Washakie was a friend of Brigham Young and expressed sadness at the fighting his people had often done with the Utahns. It was not until after 1880, after Young&#x27;s death, that Washakie became a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He was baptized on September 25, 1880, by Amos R. Wright. About 300 other Shoshone joined the church at this point.

==Washakie and Episcopalianism==

In 1883, the Episcopal Church assigned John Roberts to minister to the Shoshone and Arapahos on the Wind River Reservation. Roberts established several churches on the reservation, as well as within his designated 150 mile radius. Although Washakie&#x27;s son was killed by a white man in 1885 during a dispute over alcohol, which purportedly led Washakie to vow revenge against whites, Roberts purportedly earned the Chief&#x27;s respect by offering his own life in exchange. Furthermore, Roberts learned Shoshone customs, beliefs and language, and translated the Bible into Shoshone (and Arapahoe). , Washakie helped Roberts establish a boarding school where Shoshone girls from distant villages could learn traditional crafts and language, by donating 160 acres near Trout Creek, which many considered sacred ground.

Washakie chose Episcopalianism as his faith, was baptized again in 1897, and ultimately buried in a service officiated by his friend Roberts, on February 22, 1900. Congress reaffirmed the church&#x27;s ownership of the school in 1909, when it deactivated the fort named after Chief Washakie. Although the school closed , many of the historic girls&#x27; school buildings survive today.

==Recognition==

His prowess in battle, his efforts for peace, and his commitment to his people&#x27;s welfare made him one of the most respected leaders in Native American history. In 1878, a U.S. Army outpost located on the reservation was renamed Fort Washakie, which was the only U.S. military outpost to be named after a Native American. Upon his death in 1900, he became the only known Native American to be given a full military funeral.

Washakie County, Wyoming was named for him and there&#x27;s a statue of his head in front of the Washakie County Courthouse. In 2000, the state of Wyoming donated a bronze statue of Washakie to the National Statuary Hall Collection. There is also a statue of Washakie in downtown Casper, Wyoming. The dining hall at the University of Wyoming is also named after him. The current ghost town of Washakie, Utah was also named after him.

During World War II, a liberty ship built in Portland, Oregon, in 1942, SS &quot;Chief Washakie&quot;, was named in his honor. USS &quot;Washakie&quot;, a U.S. Navy harbor tug in service from 1944 to 1946 and from 1953 to 1975, also was named for him.

Washakie was a hide painter. An 1880 painted elk hide at the Glenbow Museum is attributed to him. The hide painting portrays the Sun Dance. One of his sons, Cotsiogo (also known as Codsiogo and Katsikodi), was a prominent hide painter.

==Chief Washakie Foundation==
The Chief Washakie Foundation was founded in 2004. It supports educational programs and research into the history and cultural traditions of the Shoshone and Arapaho of Central Wyoming and advocates for Native American education. Washakie&#x27;s great-great-grandson James Trosper serves as chair and executive director.

<text>Othniel Looker (October 4, 1757July 23, 1845) was a Democratic-Republican Party politician from Ohio. He served briefly as the fifth governor of Ohio.

==Biography==
Sources vary on Looker&#x27;s birth location. He was born either in Morris County, New Jersey, or on Long Island, New York. His gravestone was engraved with the Morris County location.

Locker moved with his mother to Hanover Township, New Jersey, when he was two-years-old, after the death of his father. He enlisted with the New Jersey militia in 1776, and served out the remainder of the American Revolutionary War as a private.

In 1779, Looker married Pamela Clark, and circa 1788 Looker moved to Vermont and then to New York, working as a school teacher.

==Career==
He served in the New York State Assembly from 1803 to 1804. After receiving a land grant for his war services, Looker moved to Hamilton County, Ohio in 1804, and served in the Ohio House of Representatives from 1807 to 1810. He served in the Ohio Senate from 1810 to 1817.

While serving as Speaker of the Ohio Senate from 1813 to 1814, Looker was concurrently elevated to the governorship, after then-Governor Return J. Meigs Jr. resigned to become Postmaster General.
Looker sought re-election, but was badly defeated by the far more well-known Thomas Worthington. He continued to live in Ohio until his wife&#x27;s death, and later moved to Palestine, Illinois, to be with his daughter Rachel Kitchell, and he is buried there in Kitchell Cemetery. Looker was the Ohio presidential elector in 1816 for James Monroe.

==Legacy==
The Village Historical Society, in Harrison, Ohio, has restored the home of former Ohio Governor Othniel Looker. The Othniel Looker House is open to the public, free of charge, on a few dates during each year, and special tours can be arranged for school groups. The Othniel Looker House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="702187" wikidata="Q1106244" url="?curid=702187" title="Codex Regius">
<text>Codex Regius (, &quot;Royal Book&quot; or &quot;King&#x27;s Book&quot;; ) or GKS 2365 4º is an Icelandic codex in which many Old Norse poems from the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; are preserved. Thought to have been written during the 1270s, it is made up of 45 vellum leaves. The work originally contained a further eight leaves, which are now missing. It is the sole source for most of the poems it contains. In scholarly texts, this manuscript is commonly abbreviated as [R] for Codex Regius, or as [K] for Konungsbók.

The codex was discovered in 1643, when it came into the possession of Brynjólfur Sveinsson, then Bishop of Skálholt in Iceland, who in 1662 sent it as a gift to King Frederick III of Denmark; hence the name. It was then kept in the Royal Library in Copenhagen until April 21, 1971, when it was brought back to Reykjavík, and is now kept in the Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies. Because air travel at the time was not entirely trustworthy with such precious cargo, it was transported by ship, accompanied by a military escort.

One of the principal manuscripts of &quot;Snorri&#x27;s Edda&quot; (GKS 2367 4to) is also named Codex Regius. Composed of 55 vellum pages, dating from the early 14th century, it was part of the same gift from Bishop Brynjólfur to Frederick III. It was returned to Iceland in 1985, where it is now also in the Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies.

<text>Anna Sokolow (February 9, 1910 – March 29, 2000) was an American dancer and choreographer. Sokolow&#x27;s work is known for its social justice focus and theatricality. Throughout her career, Sokolow supported of the development of modern dance around the world, including in Mexico and Israel.

At the beginning of her career, Sokolow was a principal dancer in the Martha Graham Company. Sokolow soon became an independent choreographer, who went on to form multiple dance companies throughout her life.

Sokolow choreographed for and set her work on companies around the world, including major companies such as Batsheva Dance Company, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, The Jose Limón Dance Company, Joffery Ballet and the Daniel Lewis Dance Company. Her work continues to be performed by the Sokolow Theatre/Dance Ensemble in New York City.

Her work is preserved and set by the Sokolow Theatre/Dance Ensemble and the Sokolow Dance Foundation in Massachusetts.

== Early life ==
Anna Sokolow was born on February 9, 1910, in Hartford, Connecticut, and grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Both of her parents were Jewish immigrants from Russia.

Her father, Samuel Sokolow, immigrated to the U.S. around 1905 followed in 1907 by her mother Sarah. Intending to reside in Hartford, Connecticut, Samuel and Sarah eventually moved to New York City for better job prospects. Sarah started working in the garment industry when Samuel became disabled by Parkinson&#x27;s disease. A socialist, Sarah was heavily involved in the Garment Workers Union. Anna Sokolow was the third child of four born to Samuel and Sarah, preceded by Isadore and Rose, and succeeded by Gertie.

==Training==
Sokolow began her dance training by taking classes at the Emanuel Sisterhood alongside her sister Rose. Her first teacher, Elsa Pohl, was influenced by the work of Isadora Duncan. Despite the objection of her family, Sokolow moved away from home and dropped out of school in favor of a dance career at age 15. While training, Sokolow supported herself by working in a factory. She began training under Irene Lewisohn, Louis Horst, and Martha Graham, among others, at the Neighborhood Playhouse at the Henry Street Settlement in 1925 as a “Junior Player.” Blanche Talmud, Sokolow&#x27;s main teacher, had a background in Delsarte and Dalcroze eurhythmics.

As a student at the Playhouse, Sokolow studied voice, dance and pantomime. She eventually received a full scholarship at the Playhouse, and participated in her first major performance in 1928 as a part of Ernest Bloch&#x27;s “Israel Symphony.”

==Career==
Sokolow first performed with the Martha Graham Company in 1930. She danced with the company as a soloist for about 8 years. While performing with the Graham company, she assisted Louis Horst in his choreography classes. One of her notable performances with the company was in Massine&#x27;s “Rite of Spring” in 1930.

Alongside her work with the Martha Graham Company, Sokolow began choreographing and offering solo performances in 1932. She developed the Theatre Union Dance Group in 1933, which was renamed “Dance Unit” in 1935.

In programs for “Dance Unit”, Anna Sokolow&#x27;s name wasn&#x27;t emphasized in order to bring more attention to the group as opposed to certain individuals. In 1936, a full evening of her own work was presented at the Young Men&#x27;s Hebrew Association (YMHA) in New York City. Some of the works included in the program were &quot;Speaker&quot; (1935), &quot;Strange American Funeral&quot; (1935), &quot;Inquisition ‘36&quot; (1936), and &quot;Four Little Salon Pieces&quot; (1936). In 1937, four men joined the Dance Unit for the first time, premiering in &quot;Excerpts from a War Poem&quot; (1937). With the addition of men, Sokolow avoided dividing movement based on gender and instead presented all bodies as equals. 

Beginning in the 1930s, she affiliated herself with the politicized &quot;radical dance&quot; movement, out of which developed her work &quot;Anti-War Trilogy&quot; (1933). During this time period, she performed and choreographed both solo and ensemble works, which tackled subject matter that included the exploitation of workers and growing troubles of Jews in Germany. Sokolow drew inspiration from the Union movement, and stated in a 1975 interview that she considered the unions her first audience. She often explored themes of Communism, socialism, and the working class through her dances, particularly in &quot;Strange American Funeral&quot; (1935) and &quot;Case No. --&quot; (1937). Several works from this period, including &quot;Anti-War Trilogy&quot;, were set to music by the composer Alex North.

In the 1940s, Sokolow continued premiering works in various venues throughout New York City, such as &quot;The Bride&quot; (1946), a piece influenced by traditional elements from Orthodox Jewish wedding ceremonies. From 1955 to 1985, Sokolow regularly choreographed for the Juilliard Dance Ensemble at the Juilliard School. She created many notable pieces for the group including &quot;Primavera&quot; (1955) and &quot;Ballade&quot; (1965).

In 1953, Sokolow created &quot;Lyric Suite&quot;, one of her most well-received works. A collection of solos, duets, and ensemble work set to the music of Alban Berg, &quot;Lyric Suite&quot; was noteworthy for its lack of a narrative and its &quot;suite form&quot; design. The New Dance Group sponsored the first showing of &quot;Lyric Suite&quot; in March 1954. Sokolow considered this piece as the beginning of a new era in her choreography.

Another of Sokolow&#x27;s signature works is &quot;Rooms&quot; (1955), a piece that explores loneliness. The music is a Jazz score, composed for the dance by Kenyon Hopkins. &quot;Rooms&quot; is divided into six sections: Dream, Escape, Desire, Panic, Daydream, and The End? The piece features eight dancers and eight chairs, with the intention that each dancer and chair portrays a character in a secluded room.

From 1958 to 1965, Sokolow created her &quot;Opus&quot; series. This series includes &quot;Opus &#x27;58&quot; (1958), &quot;Opus Jazz 1958&quot; (1958), &quot;Opus &#x27;60&quot; (1960), &quot;Opus &#x27;62&quot; (1962), &quot;Opus &#x27;63&quot; (1963), and &quot;Opus &#x27;65&quot; (1965). The set of six pieces, along with &quot;Session for Six&quot; (1958) and &quot;Session for Eight&quot; (1959) used similar movement vocabularies and content with slight variations in each. Labanotation scores show the similarities, including the use of strong accents and the dropping of the body and its parts to the floor, which created a jaded, teenage mood. To accompany this mood, costumes for the &quot;Opus&quot; pieces were simple, consisting of leotards, t-shirts, and tights. In some performances of the &quot;Opus&quot; series, the performance was given on a bare stage, with no curtains, against the bare brick walls of the theater.

In the later 1960s, Sokolow used jazz style to protest the war occurring in Vietnam and to give voice to the countercultures of America. &quot;Time+&quot; (1966) was a war protest dance with multiple parts. In the piece, Sokolow used clear imagery of soldiers and their experiences of war. The piece ended with soldiers that appear to be wounded and struggling with one another to stand, showing the great hardships that come from war.

In the 1970s and 80s, Sokolow&#x27;s artistic focus turned to the great painters, writers and composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Her dances of this period include &quot;Magritte, Magritte&quot; in 1970, &quot;Scenes from the Music of Charles Ives&quot; in 1971, &quot;Homenaje a Federico García Lorca&quot; in 1973, &quot;Homage to Alexander Scriabin&quot; in 1977, &quot;Poe&quot; in 1977 (revised and renamed &quot;Homage to Edgar Allan Poe&quot; in 1985), and &quot;Kurt Weill&quot; in 1988. Sokolow also returned to the theme in one of her last pieces, &quot;Frida&quot;, in 1997. 

After Sokolow&#x27;s death in 2000, The Player&#x27;s Project continued until 2004. After that point, the company&#x27;s former co-artistic directors, Jim May and Lorry May, formed separate institutions to maintain Sokolow&#x27;s repertory and legacy.

The Sokolow Theatre/Dance Ensemble, founded by Jim May, performs Sokolow&#x27;s repertory plus contemporary choreographies under the direction of Artistic Director Samantha Géracht and co-artistic directors Lauren Naslund and Eleanor Bunker. The Sokolow Theatre/Dance Ensemble continues to perform, set and reconstruct Sokolow&#x27;s work today.

The Sokolow Dance Foundation, directed by Lorry May, offers unique educational programs and actively licenses and reconstructs Sokolow&#x27;s works. 

=== Theater work ===
Sokolow began her association with Broadway in 1947, choreographing for the musical &quot;Street Scene&quot;. She choreographed for multiple Broadway productions, including &quot;Happy as Larry&quot; (1950) and &quot;Camino Real&quot; (1953).

She worked as the choreographer during the rehearsal process for the first production of the musical &quot;Hair&quot; (1967), but left the production before its first performance and her contributions were not credited. Sokolow also frequently staged works for the New York City Opera, including multiple productions in their 1956 season.

Sokolow choreographed dances for &quot;The California Story&quot; at San Diego&#x27;s Fiesta del Pacifico in 1957.

=== International work ===
Though based in New York City, Sokolow was known for her work abroad as well. In 1939, she traveled to Mexico with her company to perform at the Bellas Artes (School of Fine Arts) in Mexico City, where they received positive reviews. This success led to the formation of the group, La Paloma Azul. Sokolow created four works for this company &quot;El Renacuajo Paseador&quot; (1940). After her dancers left to return to New York City, Sokolow chose to stay behind to continue working at the request of the Ministry of Public Education. La Paloma Azul dissolved in 1940 due to the emergence of a competitor dance group. She eventually returned to New York City in the early 1940s but continued to visit Mexico City occasionally throughout her career.

Jerome Robbins encouraged Sokolow to go to Israel to work with the Inbal Dance Theatre in 1953. Sokolow&#x27;s visits to Israel began in the 1950s and concluded in the 1980s. Her first program to premiere in Israel featured &quot;The Treasure&quot; (1962), &quot;The Soldier’s Tale&quot; (1954), and &quot;Dreams&quot; (1961). In 1962, she helped established Israel&#x27;s Lyric Theatre. The company was short-lived as they disbanded in 1964. Sokolow returned to Israel as a guest choreographer for Batsheva Dance Company in 1972.

== Teaching ==
One of Anna Sokolow&#x27;s earliest teaching experiences occurred during a trip to Russia in the early 1930s. While there with her then-lover and musical collaborator, Alex North, she taught classes in the Graham technique. In 1955, Sokolow taught her first classes at Juilliard. She officially joined the faculty in 1958 and taught classes in &quot;method dancing&quot; from 1958 to 1993. Sokolow also worked alongside Robert Lewis as a teacher at the Repertory Theater at Lincoln Center and the HB Studio. Additionally, she taught choreography classes at the Hebrew Arts School later in her career.

=== The Actors Studio ===
In 1947, Sokolow&#x27;s close friend Elia Kazan convinced her to become a founding member of The Actors Studio. Sokolow taught movement for actors. The classes were rooted in the Graham technique and also incorporated floor work and ballet barre elements. Her piece &quot;Rooms&quot; (1955) emerged as a response to her experiences working with groups of aspiring actors. Sokolow eventually set a small-scale production—&quot;Elmer and Lilly&quot;—on her students. Sokolow left The Actors Studio in the mid-1950s.

==Repertory==
Although much of Sokolow&#x27;s work was not filmed, some pieces may be seen at the New York Public Library in its Dance Division. Here follows a list of many of her pieces of choreography along with premiere date and premiering company (when known).

== Legacy ==
Nicknamed modern dance&#x27;s &quot;rebellious spirit&quot;, Sokolow won a variety of awards including the Samuel Scripps Award (1991), Aztec Eagle Honor (1988), an Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts from Boston Conservatory (1988), and an Honorary Doctor of Humanities from the Ohio State University (1978). In 1967, she received a prestigious grant from the National Council on the Arts, worth $10,000; Sokolow used this funding to create &quot;Deserts&quot; (1967). 

Sokolow was inducted into the Mr. &amp; Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame in 1998, and the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1993. Sokolow dedicated her works to her inspirations including Isadora Duncan, Louis Horst, Anne Frank, José Limón, Vaslav Nijinsky, Martin Luther King Jr., and her parents. Her choreography continues to be performed by the Sokolow/Theatre Dance Ensemble and by dance companies and schools around the world.

One block of Christopher Street in New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village bears the honorary name of &quot;Anna Sokolow Way,&quot; in recognition of her longtime residence at 1 Christopher St.

== Personal life ==
Sokolow was romantically involved with Alex North, her musical collaborator, for seven years. Despite the dissolution of their relationship, they continued to work together throughout their careers. She had no children.

Sokolow was known for her heavy involvement in the Communist movement. In New York&#x27;s 1936 election, she registered as a Communist. In the 1940s, she was also a featured performer in many Communist rallies. However, by the 1950s, she no longer aligned herself with the Communist party. When questioned by the FBI, she cited her participation at rallies was motivated by earning money for her performance.

Sokolow suffered from depression in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Sokolow died at the age of 90, on March 29, 2000, in New York City.

<text>Benjamin Robert Moody II (born January 22, 1981) is an American guitarist, songwriter and record producer. He is known as co-founder of rock band Evanescence, which he departed in 2003 after the release of their debut album &quot;Fallen&quot; (2003). After leaving Evanescence, Moody co-wrote and co-produced songs for Kelly Clarkson, Avril Lavigne, Anastacia, Lindsay Lohan, Bo Bice, Daughtry, and Celine Dion.

==Early life==
Moody was born on January 22, 1981 in Little Rock, Arkansas. He described his youth in Little Rock as being lax, stating that &quot;everybody has their fun. In Little Rock, I&#x27;m an infamous thief - it was all there was to do.&quot; He began playing drums, but switched to guitar after experiencing carpal tunnel issues. He did not take guitar lessons, and took influence from 1980s artists like Metallica, Ozzy Osbourne and Mötley Crüe. Commenting on his favorite era of music, Moody said: &quot;Honestly, I think I was born about 10 years too late. I listen to &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; by Europe once a week just for the hell of it&quot;. He called Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett his &quot;hero&quot; and the reason he played guitar.

==Career==
===Evanescence===

In 1994, Moody met Amy Lee in Little Rock, Arkansas while at a youth camp. The two became musical collaborators and co-founded Evanescence. They soon began playing music at local shops. Within a few years, the duo began selling EPs at local shows, culminating in their discovery by Wind-up Records and the release of their debut studio album, &quot;Fallen&quot;, in 2003. Moody abruptly left Evanescence in October 2003 during their European tour, citing creative differences.

In 2006, Moody signed with former Evanescence management Rider Management, which sued him in 2013 for $500,000 in unpaid commissions.

In August 2010, Moody released a statement on his history with Lee and Evanescence, where he said that he was a different person at the time, his friendship with Lee had deteriorated, and they had conflicting opinions, personalities, and desires with the band. Moody apologized to Lee for comments he made to her in anger. He said he realized the band would end if he stayed and believes he made the right choice. He added, &quot;Evanescence has progressed a great distance from the original sound, and made it clear that they intended to expand much further. Amy is very artistic and never has had a problem thinking outside of the box and defying expectations.&quot;

===Solo projects===
Beginning in 2004, Moody began collaborating with several artists, co-writing the track &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Home&quot; for Avril Lavigne&#x27;s second album, &quot;Under My Skin&quot;, and co-writing the track &quot;The End Has Come&quot; with Jason C. Miller and Jason &quot;Gong&quot; Jones for &quot;The Punisher&quot; soundtrack. He then wrote with David Hodges, Kelly Clarkson, and others for Clarkson&#x27;s second album, &quot;Breakaway&quot;, working on the songs &quot;Because of You&quot; and &quot;Addicted&quot;.

In early 2005, Moody played lead guitar for the song &quot;Forever in Our Hearts&quot;, the &#x27;song for tsunami relief&#x27; made exclusively for iTunes. He collaborated with singer Anastacia on the song &quot;Everything Burns&quot;, which is featured on her album &quot;Pieces of a Dream&quot; and the &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; soundtrack. Moody then assisted Lindsay Lohan on her album &quot;A Little More Personal (Raw)&quot; and worked with Bo Bice on the song &quot;My World&quot; (a cover from SR-71) for his debut album &quot;The Real Thing&quot;. Moody&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Regret What You Don&#x27;t Remember&quot;, was scheduled to be released in late 2005, and would feature bassist Marty O&#x27;Brien on bass, drummer Lance Garvin, guitarist Michael &quot;Fish&quot; Herring, and co-vocals from Jason Miller.

In April 2006, Moody began working on the debut album of singer-songwriter Hana Pestle, co-producing and co-writing with Michael &quot;Fish&quot; Herring, as well as performing on the album. He later produced the Godhead album &quot;The Shadow Line&quot; with Julian Beeston, and played a clown in their music video for the song &quot;Push&quot;. He collaborated with Hodges again on American Idol Chris Daughtry&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Daughtry&quot; (2006), for the song &quot;What About Now&quot;.

In 2007, Moody worked with Celine Dion on her album &quot;Taking Chances&quot;. It was reported that his solo album was still in the works.

In December 2008, he released the &quot;Mutiny Bootleg E.P.&quot; and announced that his solo album would be released on March 3, 2009. This release would be delayed, however, as was hinted at in February 2009, when Moody&#x27;s official website displayed the release as &quot;available 2009&quot; instead of the March 3 release date. On June 9, 2009, Moody&#x27;s debut solo album, entitled &quot;All for This&quot;, was released digitally via Amazon.com, iTunes, and Amie Street through Moody&#x27;s label, FNR Records. His second album, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Regret What You Don&#x27;t Remember&quot;, was released on November 11, 2011.

===Other bands===
In June 2009, it was announced that Moody had formed the rock band called We Are the Fallen, recruiting American Idol 7 finalist Carly Smithson as the lead singer, and his friends former Evanescence drummer Rocky Gray, guitarist John LeCompt, and Marty O&#x27;Brien on bass. We Are the Fallen made their first public appearance together for a press conference at SIR Studios in Los Angeles, CA, on June 22, 2009. Their debut album, &quot;Tear the World Down&quot; was released in May 2010. The band toured for most of the year in support of the album, and filmed their first live DVD, Cirque Des Damnés, at the Avalon Theatre. The DVD was scheduled for release in late 2011.

In 2012, Moody teamed up with former Papa Roach drummer Dave Buckner, and former Rock Star Supernova frontman Lukas Rossi, to form a new band called The Halo Method. Before their debut show on the Shiprocked cruise in November 2012, former In This Moment bassist and studio engineer Josh Newell became their bassist.

===Acting roles===
Moody started a television and film production company, Makeshift Films. He made a cameo as a zombie in the 2004 horror film &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot;. He also appeared in the 2007 release of the low-budget film &quot;Dead and Gone.&quot;

==Personal life==
Moody identified as Christian and promoted his religious beliefs in interviews in the early 2000s. In 2005, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He struggled with substance abuse during his time in Evanescence, and entered rehab after leaving the band.

Moody dated singer Hana Pestle. 

As of June 2022, he is now divorced with 2 sons.

<doc id="702198" wikidata="Q4355835" url="?curid=702198" title="Daphne Moon">
<text>Daphne Crane (née Moon; born September 1964) is a fictional character on the American television sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot;, played by Jane Leeves. An English immigrant from Manchester, Daphne is employed by Frasier as a live-in housekeeper and physical therapist for his father, Martin. Her relationship with Frasier&#x27;s brother Niles is a major plotline of the series, progressing from Niles&#x27; secret infatuation to their eventual marriage later on the show.

== Biography ==
Daphne was born in September 1964 in Manchester, the only daughter in a family of nine children. She spent much of her childhood playing nurse and housemaid to her brothers. She has a complex love-hate relationship with her overbearing mother, Gertrude Moon; her relationship with her father, Harry Moon, is much warmer and closer.

As a young girl, Daphne&#x27;s early career was as an actress in the hit British sitcom &quot;Mind Your Knickers&quot; (a show about 12-year-olds in a private girls&#x27; boarding school). Her career ended at 16 when she became too tall and busty to play her shorter pre-teen character. During her youth, she gained considerable skill at billiards and darts, claiming to have won many tournaments. She also raised show rats, was a Manchester Light Opera Works member, and was a skilled shoplifter.

As an adult, Daphne takes up a career as a physical therapist, working one-on-one with various invalids and shut-ins. At an undisclosed time, she migrates to America to live in Seattle, seeking a new life free of her domineering family. Her first job in America was at a convenience store, and it is implied she once shoplifted there. In the third season finale, &quot;You Can Go Home Again&quot;, it is revealed that before being interviewed and hired by the Cranes, she had a chance encounter with them at Cafe Nervosa. In the series premiere, &quot;The Good Son&quot;, Daphne is hired by Frasier to assist his father, Martin, with his daily activities and exercises; Martin suffers pain and discomfort from a gunshot wound to his hip that forced him to retire from the Seattle Police Department. Although Frasier is initially less than impressed with her, Martin takes a liking to her sense of humor and convinces Frasier to hire her and make her position a live-in one.

== Personality ==
Daphne is mostly portrayed as kind and down-to-earth, often perplexed and exasperated by Frasier&#x27;s snobbery and pretension. In the earlier seasons, Daphne portrays herself as a no-nonsense physical therapist with Martin. Although they fight and bicker over Martin&#x27;s therapy sessions, she gets along with Martin well and acts as his caregiver and constant companion.

Like most characters on &quot;Frasier&quot;, Daphne has many eccentricities. She often tells rambling stories about her family, cheerfully remembering rather grim or traumatic events, to the considerable discomfort of the Crane family. She is also a firm believer in the supernatural, and believes herself to be &quot;a bit psychic&quot;. Daphne&#x27;s apparent psychic abilities are often treated with ambiguity on the show, and her various &quot;visions&quot; are sometimes shown to have come true, sometimes in a roundabout way and sometimes very accurately. As the series progresses, Daphne&#x27;s psychic abilities are considerably downplayed. In the season 8 episode &quot;The Wizard and Roz&quot;, Niles hires a paranormal expert to assess whether or not Daphne truly has any psychic abilities. During the course of her discussion with the expert, Daphne implies that her grandmother told her she had psychic abilities.

== Role on the series ==
Like Martin, Daphne acts as a working class foil to Frasier and Niles&#x27;s upper-class snobbery, while also vexing Frasier&#x27;s scientific views with her eccentric behavior. As the show progressed and this aspect of her character was toned down, more focus was put on her relationships with the other characters. One of the running gags of the show is her terrible culinary skill as she is known to cook awful and outright strange dishes. Frasier, Niles and Martin dread her cooking and often try to avoid eating her food or stop her from cooking.

Daphne&#x27;s most significant developing relationship over the course of the series is with Frasier Crane&#x27;s younger brother, Niles. Unbeknownst to Daphne, Niles falls in love with her in the third episode, when they first meet. Despite how Niles shows more and more signs of being infatuated with her, she remains completely oblivious to this, though they become increasingly close friends. Niles says nothing to Daphne, at first because he is married, later because she is involved with numerous (frequently unsuccessful) relationships with other men. Even when she is not, Frasier has one excuse or another to prevent Niles from telling her anything.

Niles&#x27; feelings are ultimately, and accidentally, revealed by Frasier in season 7. Shocked to discover Niles&#x27;s true feelings towards her, Daphne finds herself falling in love with Niles in return, placing her in the position Niles had been in for many years: in love with someone unaware of her true feelings. Daphne realizes her feelings after a court-ordered therapy session stemming from an incident where Daphne caused a dangerous traffic jam by throwing a neighbor&#x27;s laundry off Frasier&#x27;s balcony; the therapist points out that the entire chain of events leading to the incident was set off by Daphne&#x27;s decision to wear her &quot;best dress&quot; while giving Niles a cooking lesson.

Heartbroken to discover that he had, on impulse, married his girlfriend Mel, Daphne intends to go ahead with her own marriage to Niles&#x27;s divorce lawyer Donny Douglas (Saul Rubinek), until Frasier intervenes. In a four-part episode closing Season 7 and opening Season 8, Niles finally confesses his feelings to her, and although she initially tells him both of them are better off staying with their current partners (each having made a serious commitment), Daphne changes her mind by the next morning, abandoning Donny at the altar, to Niles&#x27; delight. Niles and Daphne have a precarious courtship during season 8 after Mel forbids Niles from being seen in public with Daphne, and Donny retaliates with a lawsuit for being left at the altar after Frasier confesses to Donny that he was the instigator of the breakup. Tensions arise, with Daphne blaming Niles for all their new relationship problems.

Shortly thereafter, she gains 60 pounds, but Niles is so blinded by love that he does not notice until Daphne falls to the floor and is too heavy to get up without the help of Frasier, Niles, and Martin (who remarks that &quot;it took three Cranes to lift her&quot;). The weight problem was written into the show to allow Leeves to continue working while pregnant. Daphne then leaves for several weeks to attend a &quot;spa for fat people&quot; and returns with her figure restored. Her therapist at the spa tells her that she began over-eating to create distance between herself and Niles because she was afraid that she wouldn&#x27;t be able to live up to Niles&#x27;s lofty expectations after he spent the last seven years believing she was perfect (&quot;Daphne Returns&quot;). During the episode &quot;It Takes Two to Tangle&quot; in which she did not appear while at the resort, Niles tells Roz that Daphne had lost 9 pounds, 12 ounces (the weight of Leeves&#x27;s baby in real life).

At some point in Season 10, she becomes a U.S. citizen (her lack of citizenship having set up some humorous situations in earlier seasons). In the first episode of Season 10, Daphne and Niles marry in a small, private ceremony in Reno, Nevada. The rest of Season 10 and early Season 11 show Daphne and Niles adjusting to their new life as a wedded couple. Daphne and Niles have their first child, David, in the final episode of the series, &quot;Goodnight, Seattle&quot;. (He is named after the show&#x27;s co-creator David Angell who died in the September 11 attacks.) A flash-forward scene in an earlier episode reveals that the couple will also have two daughters.

== Family ==
Daphne grew up in a very large dysfunctional family. They are often the subject of her long-winded tales that sometimes leave the Cranes somewhat perplexed. Although they are frequently mentioned, the first time one of her family members appears on the show is in the season 7 episode &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, in which Donny surprises Daphne with a visit from her brother, Simon (Anthony LaPaglia), not knowing that she dislikes him. (Her favorite brother, Stephen, never appears until the final episode, where he is played by Richard E. Grant). In &quot;Something Borrowed, Someone Blue&quot;, Daphne&#x27;s mother makes her first appearance, while her father only makes his debut in season 9.

In the episode &quot;An Affair to Forget&quot;, she mentions she had an ancestor who served on HMS &quot;Bounty&quot; who took Fletcher Christian&#x27;s side in the mutiny. According to her, he made it to Pitcairn Island with a Tahitian wife and had several children.

Five out of Daphne&#x27;s eight brothers appear on the show; few of them maintain consistency with Daphne&#x27;s Northern accent. LaPaglia, an Australian actor, adopted a Cockney accent playing Simon, while Robbie Coltrane, who is Scottish, played Daphne&#x27;s brother Michael with a muddled Brummie (Birmingham) accent—which had a distinct Scottish lilt to it—explained away by Niles as being a result of his being dropped as a baby. The effect is completed by his speech being virtually unintelligible. Richard E Grant played Stephen Moon with an indeterminate accent somewhere between Received Pronunciation and Cockney. Her brother Billy is implied to be gay, such as in the episode &quot;Daphne&#x27;s Room&quot;, in which Daphne says her brothers would &quot;sneak into the bathroom and peek at me in the shower … except for me brother Billy, the ballroom dancer. He never peeked at me, though he did peek at me brother Nigel.&quot; When Daphne talks with her mom Gertrude about resuming her sex life with Niles after his heart surgery, Gertrude tells her to &quot;use your feminine wiles – that&#x27;s how your brother Billy landed Kevin.&quot; According to Daphne, Billy rejected the family&#x27;s traditional fishing background by announcing that he &quot;hated the smell of fish, and was going to teach ballroom dancing.&quot; Daphne also has an uncle, Jackie, who lives in San Francisco.

== Accent ==

Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Lucy Mangan criticized Daphne&#x27;s adopted Manchester accent as the show&#x27;s only &quot;weak link&quot;.

In an interview on BBC Breakfast in May 2011, Leeves said &quot;they [the producers] wanted something a bit working class but they wanted something an American audience could understand. So it&#x27;s just a slight working class accent&quot;, and that &quot;it&#x27;s not really right.&quot;

<text>Oskar Ryszard Lange (; 27 July 1904 – 2 October 1965) was a Polish economist and diplomat. He is best known for advocating the use of market pricing tools in socialist systems and providing a model of market socialism. He responded to the economic calculation problem proposed by Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek by claiming that managers in a centrally-planned economy would be able to monitor supply and demand through increases and declines in inventories of goods, and advocated the nationalization of major industries. During his stay in the United States, Lange was an academic teacher and researcher in mathematical economics. Later in socialist Poland, he was a member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party.

==Career==

Lange was born in Tomaszów Mazowiecki as son of the Protestant manufacturer Arthur Julius Lange and his wife Sophie Albertine Rosner. His ancestors had emigrated at the beginning of the 19th century from Germany to Poland. He studied law and economics at the University of Kraków, where he defended a doctoral dissertation in 1928 under Adam Krzyżanowski. From 1926 to 1927 Lange worked at the Ministry of Labor in Warsaw, and then was a research assistant at the University of Kraków (1927–31). He married Irene Oderfeld in 1932. In 1934, a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship brought him to England, from where he emigrated to the United States in 1937. Lange became a professor at the University of Chicago in 1938 and was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 1943.

Joseph Stalin, who identified Lange as a person of leftist and pro-Soviet sympathies, prevailed on President Franklin D. Roosevelt to obtain a passport for Lange to visit the Soviet Union in an official capacity, so that Stalin could speak with him personally; he also proposed offering him a position in the future Polish cabinet. The State Department was opposed to Lange traveling as an emissary because they felt that his political views represented neither Americans of Polish descent nor American public opinion in general. Lange&#x27;s trip to the Soviet Union in 1944 caused further controversy, as the newly established Polish American Congress condemned him and defended the interests of the London-based Polish government-in-exile. Lange returned to the United States at the end of May and met, at Roosevelt&#x27;s request, with Prime Minister Stanisław Mikołajczyk of the government-in-exile, who was on a visit in Washington. Lange stressed how reasonable Stalin was prepared to be (Stalin told him of the Soviet desire to preserve an independent Poland under a coalition government), and asked the State Department to put pressure on the exiled Polish leadership to reach an understanding with the Soviet leader.

Towards the end of World War II, Lange broke with the Polish government-in-exile and transferred his support to the Lublin Committee (PKWN) sponsored by the Soviet Union. Lange served as a go-between for Roosevelt and Stalin during the Yalta Conference discussions on post-war Poland.

After the war ended in 1945, Lange returned to Poland. He then renounced his American citizenship and went back to the US in the same year as the Polish People&#x27;s Republic&#x27;s first ambassador to the United States. In 1946, Lange also served as Poland&#x27;s delegate to the United Nations Security Council. From 1947 he lived in Poland.

Oskar Lange worked for the Polish government while continuing his academic pursuits at the University of Warsaw and the Main School of Planning and Statistics. He was deputy chairman of the Polish Council of State in 1961–65, and as such one of four acting chairmen of the Council of State (a head of state function).

==Academic contributions==

The bulk of Lange&#x27;s contributions to economics came during his American interlude of 1933–45. Despite being an ardent socialist, Lange deplored the Marxian labor theory of value because he was very much a believer in the neoclassical theory of price. In the history of economics, he is probably best known for his work &quot;On the Economic Theory of Socialism&quot; published in 1936, where he famously put Marxian economics and neoclassical economics together.

In the book, Lange advocated the use of market tools (especially the neoclassical pricing theory) in economic planning of socialism and Marxism. He proposed that central planning boards set prices through &quot;trial and error&quot;, making adjustments as shortages and surpluses occur rather than relying on a free price mechanism. Under this system, central planners would arbitrarily pick a price for products manufactured in government factories and raise it or reduce, depending on whether it resulted in shortages or gluts. After this economic experiment had been run a few times, mathematical methods would be employed to plan the economy: if there were shortages, prices would be raised; if there were surpluses, prices would be lowered. Raising the prices would encourage businesses to increase production, driven by their desire to increase profits, and in doing so eliminate the shortage. Lowering the prices would encourage businesses to curtail production in order to prevent losses, which would eliminate the surplus. In Lange&#x27;s opinion, such simulation of market mechanism would be capable of effectively managing supply and demand. Proponents of this idea argued that it combines the advantages of a market economy with those of socialist economy.

With the utilization of this idea, Lange claimed, a state-run economy would be at least as efficient as a capitalist or private market economy. He argued that this was possible, provided the government planners used the price system as if in a market economy and instructed state industry managers to respond parametrically to state-determined prices (minimize cost, etc.). Lange&#x27;s argument was one of the pivots of the socialist calculation debate with the Austrian School economists. At that time, the view among English socialists of the Fabian Society was that Lange had won the debate. His works provided the earliest model of market socialism. Hayek&#x27;s essay entitled The Use of Knowledge in Society is a rebuttal to Lange&#x27;s work and is considered one of the most important articles ever written in the field of economics.

Lange also made contributions in various other areas. He was one of the leading lights of the &quot;Paretian Revival&quot; in general equilibrium theory during the 1930s. In 1942, he provided one of the first proofs of the First and Second Welfare Theorems. He initiated the analysis of stability of general equilibrium (1942, 1944). His critique of the quantity theory of money (1942) prompted his student Don Patinkin to develop his remarkable &quot;integration&quot; of money into general equilibrium theory. Lange made several seminal contributions to the development of neoclassical synthesis (1938, 1943, 1944). He worked on integrating classical economics and neoclassical economics into a single theoretical structure (e.g. 1959). In his final years, Lange also worked on cybernetics and the use of computers for economic planning.

The International Institute of Social Studies (ISS) awarded Oskar Lange an honorary fellowship in 1962.

<doc id="702204" wikidata="Q1113583" url="?curid=702204" title="Coombe Abbey">
<text>Coombe Abbey (also Combe Abbey) is a former Cistercian abbey at Combe Fields in the Borough of Rugby, in the countryside of Warwickshire, England. The abbey was converted to a country house in the 16th century and now operates as a hotel. It is a grade I listed building.
The house&#x27;s original grounds are now a country park known as Coombe Country Park and run by Coventry City Council.

==Early history as an abbey==
During the 12th century, the building was known as the Abbey of Cumbe, and was the largest and most influential monastery in Warwickshire. The land was given to the Cistercian monks by Richard de Camville, of Didleton Castle. They accepted the gift, and sent out an advance party of monks, who, living in temporary wooden buildings, began the building of a monastery dedicated to the Blessed Virgin. Among these monks was one called Martin who was to be the first Abbot of the new House which opened in 1150. It was the fifth daughter house of Waverley Abbey.

Numerous gifts of land were made to the monks during the four hundred years of their occupation and they owned land in many counties. In 1470 King Edward IV visited the Abbey. He was on his way from Leicester to Coventry, pursuing his enemy the Earl of Warwick in the Wars of the Roses and he rested awhile at Coombe.

The monastery was well known for its generosity in distributing gifts to the poor. Every Maundy Thursday, money, ten quarters of rye bread, three quarters of malt beer and 300 herrings were given to the poor at the abbey gate.

In 1539, the abbey was suppressed as part of the dissolution of monasteries under Henry VIII. Since then numerous alterations and additions have been made over the centuries. However, parts of the abbey have been preserved and can still be seen in the present building. The cloister lay to the north of the (now demolished) church and its garth forms the present courtyard. Parts of the 15th century cloister arcades survive on the north and west sides. The lower part of the east range of buildings also remains, including the fine doorway and flanking windows of the chapter house, dated to the 1180s.

==Conversion to a private residence==

After the Abbey had been dissolved it passed through numerous owners for the next forty years, during which time the church was pulled down to prevent its reuse as an abbey. In 1581 it came into the possession of Sir John Harington of Exton and he converted the abbey into one of the most substantial houses in the county.

Harington was of Scottish descent, being a descendant of Robert Bruce. When James VI of Scotland became King of England, Harington used his ancestry to win favour. In 1603 James sent his daughter Princess Elizabeth to live at Coombe Abbey. The King issued a Privy Seal Order which declared &quot;we have thought fit to commit the keeping and education of the Lady Elizabeth our daughter to Lord Harington and the Lady his wife&quot;. Elizabeth lived at the Abbey for the next five years. Her tutor and chaplain were Master John Tovey, the headmaster of the Free School at Coventry. Elizabeth&#x27;s favourite childhood companion was Ann Dudley, a niece of Lord Harington, and with her, she formed a lasting friendship.

In May 1604, the plague came to Coventry and Rugby, but Harington wrote to King James that Elizabeth was safe. Later in the year, the famous Gunpowder Plot was conceived. It was planned that King James and his two sons were to be killed, leaving Princess Elizabeth as Queen. Elizabeth was to be kidnapped and a Catholic Regent appointed to rule the country in her minority, during which time she was to be married to a Catholic and educated in Catholicism. To ensure that she was unguarded at Coombe Abbey a hunting match to which Harington was invited, was arranged by the Catholic gentry to take place on 6 November 1605 at Dunchurch, only a few miles from Coombe.

As the plotters marched to Coombe, Lord Harington received word of the rising that morning and had sent Elizabeth to Sir Thomas Holcroft into the walled city of Coventry. The Mayor and nine other citizens mounted guard, drawing bows, pikes and other weapons from the city armoury for this purpose. When the plotters arrived at Coombe they found Elizabeth gone and fled. Most of them were killed while trying to escape, but a few were captured and taken to London where they were executed. On 14 February, Elizabeth married Frederick who later became King of Bohemia and she became the Queen.

John Harrington died in 1613 and after several changes of ownership, the Abbey was bought in 1622 by Lady Elizabeth Craven, widow of Sir William Craven, mayor of London who settled the property on her son. It remained in the Craven family for the next three hundred years.

==The Craven family==

During the Craven ownership, the abbey was extensively developed, with various buildings added, such as the west wing in 1677. The first owner was the son of Lady Elizabeth Craven Lieutenant General William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven.

Lieutenant General William Craven (1608-1687) was a Royalist and at the age of 24 he enlisted to serve in the cause of restoring the King and Queen of Bohemia Frederick and Elizabeth (formerly Princess Elizabeth) to their throne in Germany. He spent most of his life in this cause and gained favour with her brother King Charles 1 and the subsequent Kings of England.

In 1662, Elizabeth died and left William Craven her collection of Stuart Family paintings which included pictures by such masters as Rubens, Van Dyck and Honthorst. These pictures remained at Combe Abbey until the beginning of the 20th century.

In 1680-91 the house was rebuilt, incorporating much of the previous structure. This work was done to designs by William Winde, whose correspondence with Sir William Craven (later 2nd Baron) survives. The Earl of Craven died unmarried in 1697 and was succeeded by his cousin&#x27;s son as second Baron Craven. The Abbey was passed through successive generations until 1769 when it became the home of William Craven, 6th Baron Craven. In 1771 he commissioned the famous landscaper Capability Brown to modernise the landscaping around the property.

Brown was an expert at making serpentine lakes that looked like natural rivers. He dammed Smite Brook to create the main lake, Coombe Pool, and the smaller Top Pool. This sheet of water is 1.5 miles long, covers 90 acres and forms an L shape or ‘dog-leg’ that makes it appear endless. He designed also seven other buildings on the estate with his son in law Henry Holland one of which was the boathouse which survives today. The menagerie in Coombe Park was also designed by Capability Brown. The hexagonal tower with a domed roof was inspired by King Louis XIV&#x27;s Royal Menagerie at the Palace of Versailles.

In 1825 William Craven, 2nd Earl of Craven succeeded to become the owner of Coombe Abbey. In 1860 he engaged William Eden Nesfield to carry out major alterations to the house at Combe. New servants&#x27; quarters were built, the east wing and part of the north wing were demolished and rebuilt in a completely different style, and ornamental gardens were laid out including a moat. The excavation of the moat involved the destruction of the foundations of the abbey church, largely without archaeological record.

The last Earl of Craven to live in Coombe Abbey was William Craven, 4th Earl of Craven. When he died in 1921 his wife Cornelia Countess of Craven decided to sell the property. It was bought in 1923 by a builder named John Grey.

In November 1964 Coventry City Council bought Coombe Abbey with of land. The park was opened to the public in 1966.

==TV and film==
Coombe Abbey was used as the outside of the Mayor&#x27;s house in the 2009 film &quot;Nativity!&quot;, starring Martin Freeman. It was also used for filming the pilot of &quot;The Wrong Funeral&quot; the feature comedy &quot;4th Floor Of Singapore&quot; in 2013 and &quot;The Shimian&quot; in 2021.

<text>Return Jonathan Meigs Jr. (; November 17, 1764 – March 29, 1825) was a Democratic-Republican politician from Ohio. He served as the fourth governor of Ohio, eighth United States Postmaster General, and as a United States senator.

==Early life==
Meigs was born in Middletown in the Colony of Connecticut on November 17, 1764. He was the son of Return J. Meigs Sr. and the descendant of early Puritan settlers in Massachusetts. He graduated from Yale College in 1785 and studied law there. In 1788, after being admitted to the bar in Connecticut, he moved to Marietta, Ohio, where his father had been one of the first settlers, arriving earlier that year.

==Career==
In Marietta, Meigs was a lawyer, storekeeper and farmer, as well as serving in public offices. He was appointed the first court clerk for the court established at Marietta in 1788. When a post office was established in Marietta in 1794, he became its first postmaster. In 1798 he was named to a judgeship on the Northwest Territory&#x27;s territorial court, and in 1799 he won election to the territorial legislature.

In 1803 he was appointed the first chief justice of the Ohio State Supreme Court. In October 1804, he resigned this position to become commandant of U. S. troops in the St. Charles district of the Louisiana Territory. He attained the rank of Brevet Colonel and retained the command until 1806. In 1805 he was chosen as judge of the Supreme Court of Louisiana and then in 1807, judge of the United States District Court for the Michigan Territory.

He returned to Ohio in 1807 to run for governor. He won the election but was declared ineligible for failing to meet the residency requirements. He then was appointed to the U.S. Senate to finish the term of John Smith and was re-elected to his own term a year later. He resigned in late 1810 after winning the governorship.

He served two two-year terms, resigning in April 1814 when appointed Postmaster general by President James Madison. His service as Postmaster General was not without controversy. Congress investigated him twice, and he was cleared both times. The size of the Post Office doubled during his tenure, which implicated financial difficulties. He served until 1823, when he retired due to ill health and returned to Marietta.

Meigs died March 29, 1825, and is buried in Marietta&#x27;s Mound Cemetery. His grave is marked by a large monument bearing a long inscription reciting his public services and family devotion.

==Family==
Meigs was married in 1788 to Sophia Wright, and they had one child, a daughter named Mary who married congressman and federal Judge John George Jackson of Clarksburg, Virginia, in 1810.

Return J. Meigs Jr. did not have a direct male heir, but two of his younger brothers, John and Timothy, each named a son Return Jonathan Meigs. The first of these—called —passed the bar in Frankfort, Kentucky, commenced law practice in Athens, Tennessee, and became prominent in Tennessee state affairs before the Civil War. He moved to Staten Island, New York, however, at the time of Tennessee&#x27;s secession from the Union in 1861. Among those men who read law under his tutelage in Tennessee was William Parish Chilton who would become Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court.

Timothy&#x27;s son, Return J. Meigs IV, married Jennie Ross, daughter of principal Cherokee chief John Ross, and emigrated to Oklahoma on the Trail of Tears.

==Legacy==
Meigs County, Ohio, is named in his honor. (Meigs County, Tennessee, is named for his father.) Fort Meigs in Perrysburg, Ohio, was named in his honor during the War of 1812 by William Henry Harrison.

<text>The 51st State (also known as Formula 51) is a 2001 action comedy film directed by Ronny Yu, written by Stel Pavlou, and starring Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Carlyle, Emily Mortimer, Ricky Tomlinson, Sean Pertwee, Rhys Ifans, Stephen Walters and Meat Loaf. The film follows the story of an American master chemist (Jackson) who heads to Britain to sell his formula for a powerful new drug. All does not go as planned and the chemist soon becomes entangled in a web of deceit.

The film premiered in the United Kingdom on 7 December 2001. It was released internationally under the title &quot;Formula 51&quot; in October 2002, where it grossed $14.4 million, just over half of the budget.

==Plot==
In 1971, a policeman pulls over Elmo McElroy, a recent college graduate with a degree, for driving under the influence of marijuana. Due to his arrest and conviction, McElroy cannot find work as a pharmacologist. In the present day, drug lord &quot;the Lizard&quot; calls a meeting of his colleagues, hoping to sell a new substance invented by Elmo. During the meeting, in a bid to escape from the Lizard&#x27;s manipulation, Elmo blows up the building, killing everyone but the Lizard. Enraged, the Lizard contacts contract killer Dakota, who previously killed the only witness in a case against the Lizard. Dakota reluctantly accepts when the Lizard offers to clear her gambling debts and give her a $250,000 bonus.

Felix DeSouza, a local &quot;fixer&quot; in Liverpool, has been sent by Leopold Durant, head of a local criminal organization, to collect Elmo from Manchester airport, in exchange for two tickets to a sold-out football match between Liverpool and Manchester United. En route to the airport, Felix enters a pub full of Manchester United supporters and antagonizes them before letting off a rocket flare inside; the United fans give chase but his friends rescue him in their car.

Elmo lands in Manchester, is greeted by Felix and is taken to the meeting with Durant. At the meeting, Elmo pitches POS 51, a synthetic drug that can be produced with minimal facilities and is 51 times as potent as other drugs. A second opinion from Pudsey, Durant&#x27;s chemist, confirms Elmo&#x27;s claims, and Durant gives him over a million dollars in bonds. Since it is $18 million short of the agreed payment, Elmo refuses to sell.

On a roof across the street, Dakota is about to shoot Elmo in the head when the Lizard calls cancelling the hit; not wanting to kill Elmo until he has the formula. Instead of killing Elmo, she is to kill anyone who meets with him. She ends up killing everyone but Durant, Elmo, and Felix, who is shot in the buttocks. As Elmo and Felix leave the hotel, skinheads who want the drug attack them. Elmo protects them with a golf club. Detective Virgil Kane and his partner Arthur arrive on the scene and give chase. They are soon lured into a game of chicken by Elmo, who escapes. Kane and Arthur return to the crime scene and Kane demands 50% of Durant&#x27;s deal with McElroy. A miscommunication leads to Durant&#x27;s death.

Felix contacts a gun dealing club owner and drug distributor named Iki, promising him the formula for £20 million. As Elmo and Felix acquire the ingredients necessary for the drug&#x27;s manufacture, all of which are over-the-counter products, the now-armed skinheads take them hostage. The skinheads claim they have a lab, though it turns out to be a broken-in animal testing facility. Elmo makes two batches of the drug; one blue and one red. Elmo claims that the red pill is the stronger version, and after he takes one, the skinheads try it. While they are partying, waiting for the effect of the drug, Elmo secretly spits out his red pill. He tells Felix it is a powerful laxative; Elmo and Felix leave after throwing rolls of toilet paper at the incapacitated skinheads.

At Iki&#x27;s rave club, Elmo initiates his deal and delivers the drug to the waiting crowd. Kane and the police interrupt the deal and arrest Felix. After appearing, Dakota reveals that her real name is Dawn and that she and Felix were domestic partners. She abducts Elmo, leaving with him via the roof. Elmo overpowers her, suspending her over the edge of the roof. Having no choice, she strikes a deal with him and they escape Kane. Meanwhile, Kane blackmails Felix during an interrogation and forces himself into the deal with Iki, which Felix sets up for him.

Felix, Elmo and Dawn meet Iki in a private viewing box at the football match at Anfield. This time, the deal is interrupted by the Lizard, who kills Iki and demands the formula to POS 51. The Lizard celebrates with a drink, as Elmo reveals that the drug is a placebo and POS stands for Power of Suggestion. Kane interrupts them as Elmo&#x27;s cocktail, an explosive ingested by the Lizard, takes effect, killing the Lizard. Kane is knocked unconscious and arrested by Arthur, while the main three exit unscathed. Dawn and Felix settle down together, and Elmo purchases the Scottish Highland castle of the Chief of Clan McElroy, while explains that he has spent the movie wearing a kilt with &quot;the tartan of my slave master&quot;, but that Elmo now claims both the Castle and the Tartan as his own.

==Cast==
==Production==

===Development===
Screenwriter Stel Pavlou came up with the idea for &quot;The 51st State&quot; in 1994 while studying at university in Liverpool and working in the kitchens of The Brook Cafe at the Quiggins centre, loosely basing some of the characters on his friends. Pavlou described the idea of the film being based on Liverpool&#x27;s history in the slave trade and transferring it to modern day in the form of the drug trade. Pavlou and his business partner Mark Aldridge showcased their idea at the Cannes Film Festival in France which led to film development company Focus Films offering funding for development. Soon the film caught the eye of Samuel L. Jackson, who eventually came on board as both a producer and star of the film. The DVD commentary reveals that the script was originally written with Laurence Fishburne in mind, sometime before Jackson became a star.

Originally, Pavlou budgeted at around £1 million and intended to direct it himself. Due to difficulty getting funding Pavlou stepped aside and took a co-producer credit while the matter was being resolved. After five years &quot;The 51st State&quot; was finally budgeted at $28 million, with financing coming from Canada and the UK via Alliance Atlantis and the Film Consortium.

===Pre-production===
Actor and film producer Samuel L. Jackson recommended Hong Kong director Ronny Yu to direct the film, with the belief that the film&#x27;s overall style was suited to that of Yu&#x27;s previous credits, such as his 1998 film &quot;Bride of Chucky&quot;. With the roles of Elmo McElroy (Samuel L. Jackson) and Felix DeSouza (Robert Carlyle) both secured, producer Andras Hamori suggested Meat Loaf to play the antagonist. This was approved by director Yu, who called the idea a &quot;truly inspired piece of casting&quot;.

===Filming===

====Locations====
Almost all of the film was shot on location in Liverpool apart from the opening scene which was shot in Los Angeles, a driving scene which was filmed in Manchester and another scene which was filmed at Cholmondeley Castle in Cheshire. Major locations used in Liverpool included the River Mersey and docks, Pier Head, the India Building, Water Street as well as Liverpool&#x27;s&#x27;s stadium Anfield. Other famous Liverpool landmarks can be seen throughout the film in the background such as St George&#x27;s Hall and the Liver Building.

Production designer Alan Macdonald used the film&#x27;s production base in Boundary Street to build various sets for interior scenes, as well as a vast disused warehouse space in Blackstock Street.

==Release==

===Home media===
The film was released on both VHS and DVD. The DVD version was released on 7 October 2002. Special features include an audio commentary, making-of and production featurettes, a photo gallery, trailer, and cast and crew interviews. The film was released on a dual Blu-ray and DVD format on October 2, 2017.

==Reception==
For its US release, the film was renamed &quot;Formula 51&quot;. 

===Critical reception===

On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a 25% based on reviews from 102 critics, with an average rating of 4.3/10, and the consensus reading: &quot;Filled with profanities, &quot;Formula 51&quot; is a stylized and incoherent mess that doesn&#x27;t add up to much.&quot; On Metacritic, the film gained a 23 out of 100 based on reviews from 29 critics.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; newspaper called the film &quot;a farce&quot;, giving the film one out of four stars, and particularly negative comments on the film&#x27;s content and script. 
Generally positive reviews were given by both the BBC and &quot;Empire&quot; reviewers, with Alan Morrison of the latter calling it &quot;full-on fun&quot; and that the film &quot;goes beyond the boundaries&quot; of British films. 
&quot;IGN&quot; also gave the film a generally positive review, concluding that &quot;you get exactly what you pay for&quot; and that the film was overall very &quot;enjoyable&quot;.

===Box office===
The film had its world premiere on 7 December 2001, in London&#x27;s West End Curzon Cinema.

In total, the film earned over $14.4 million at the worldwide box office, $5.2 million of that in the US and $9.2 million elsewhere.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack was written by Darius Kedros, Caspar Kedros and Barney Quinton under the band name Headrillaz, and also featured artists such as PJ Harvey, Run–D.M.C., Nelly and Stephen Day.

<text>David Seymour (born Dawid Szymin; November 20, 1911 – November 10, 1956), or Chim (pronounced &quot;shim&quot;, an abbreviation of the surname &quot;Szymin&quot;), was a Polish photographer and photojournalist.

Chim was known for his images from the Spanish Civil War, for co-founding Magnum Photos with Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa and George Rodger, and for his project &quot;Children of War&quot; with UNICEF that captured the plight of children in the aftermath of World War II.

He became president of Magnum after Capa&#x27;s death in 1954 and held this post until his own death in 1956 by Egyptian machinegun fire in the aftermath of the Suez crisis.

==Early life==
Chim was born to Polish Jewish parents in Warsaw in 1911. David had a sister, Eileen, who was three years older. Their parents were Regina and Benjamin Szymin, a respected publisher of Yiddish and Hebrew books. In 1914 Chim and his parents emigrated to Odessa just as World War I had begun. In 1919 they returned to Warsaw. Chim studied graphic arts in Leipzig and then traveled to Paris to study at the Sorbonne.

==Career==

It was while Chim was studying at the Sorbonne in Paris that he became interested in photography. He began working as a freelance journalist in 1933. His first &quot;credited&quot; published photograph appeared in 1934 in the magazine &quot;Regards.&quot;

Between 1936 and 1938 Chim covered the Spanish Civil War (alongside colleague Robert Capa) and other international political events. In February 1935 Chim was sent to Spain by &quot;Regards&quot; to report on crucial issues there. Twenty five of his stories on Spain ended up being published in &quot;Regards.&quot;

In 1939 he covered the Loyalist Spanish war refugees on the S.S. Sinaia to Mexico and then later in the year he arrived in the United States. Chim was in New York City when World War II broke out in Europe when Nazi Germany invaded Poland, Chim&#x27;s birthplace. In 1940 he enlisted in the United States Army, serving in Europe as a photo interpreter during the war. He received his training at Camp Ritchie, the Army’s Military Intelligence Training Center and is considered to be one of the Ritchie Boys. In 1942 he became a naturalized citizen of the United States, the same year that his parents were killed by the Nazis. Chim photographed for &quot;Life&quot;, along with &quot;Look,&quot; &quot;Paris-Match&quot; and &quot;Regards.&quot;

In 1948 he received a commission through UNICEF and traveled to Austria, Hungary, Italy, Poland and Germany to document the plight of World War II refugee children. Inge Bondi, Chim scholar, said:
Chim&#x27;s heart had always gone out to children, and they reacted to him with complete acceptance. They seemed oblivious of him, but he noticed every little movement, every little pain, every little pleasure. There is no artifice, no bravura of lighting expertise in Chim&#x27;s photographs of the children. They speak simply from his pictures, as if alive. This intellectual, so adept at analyzing the most complex political situations, so comfortable photographing heads of state, produced his greatest photographs to help children in need.

Between 1949 and 1955 Chim travelled extensively throughout Europe and Israel, fulfilling assignments for major publications in Europe and the United States. Edward Steichen included his imagery, including his simple but eloquent picture of the worn hands of an older worker clutching a dip-pen to practice the letter &#x27;a&#x27;, in MoMA&#x27;s 1955 world-touring The Family of Man, seen by 9 million visitors.

==Magnum Photos==
In 1947, Chim co-founded the Magnum Photos photography cooperative, together with Robert Capa and Henri Cartier-Bresson, whom he had befriended in Paris in the 1930s. Inge Bondi, Chim scholar, stated:

Photojournalism was about to enter a golden decade. Television was not yet available to broadcast world events, and editors and the public were eager for news, from which they had been cut off during the fascist years and war years.

After Capa&#x27;s death in 1954, Chim became president of Magnum Photos. He held that post until his death on November 10, 1956.

==Death==
On November 10, 1956, Chim was killed while driving to photograph an exchange of wounded soldiers at El Quantara (along with French photographer Jean Roy) by Egyptian machinegun fire four days after the armistice of the 1956 Suez Crisis, ten days before his 45th birthday.

Chim&#x27;s work remains available by way of Magnum Photos and his estate is managed by nephew Ben Shneiderman and niece Helen Sarid.

==Photographic portraits ==
Chim&#x27;s reputation for his photos of war orphans was magnified by his later work in photographing famous people of his time. These included:

* Pablo Picasso, in front of detail of Guernica, France (1937)
* Henri Barbusse, along with leading left-wing intellectuals in his office at the literary journal &quot;Monde&quot;, Paris France (1935)
* Kirk Douglas, (1952)
* Arturo Toscanini, at his home, Milan (1954)
* Gina Lollobrigida, Venice (1954)

* &quot;Bal&quot; (town) and &quot;wac&quot; (anteater), meaning &quot;Anteater Town&quot;, according to Luis Ferrero.
* &quot;Bar&quot; or &quot;bur&quot; (bees) with &quot;ba&quot; or &quot;bac&quot; (tribe), meaning &quot;Bees Tribe&quot;, as explained by bishop Bernardo Augusto Thiel y Hoffmann in late 19th century, from sources from 1575 and 1599.

<text>Owen Josephus Roberts (May 2, 1875 – May 17, 1955) was an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court from 1930 to 1945. He also led two Roberts Commissions, the first of which investigated the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the second of which focused on works of cultural value during World War II.

Born in Philadelphia, Roberts graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Law School and pursued a legal career. After working as a district attorney in Philadelphia, he was appointed by President Calvin Coolidge to investigate the Teapot Dome scandal. After the death of Associate Justice Edward Terry Sanford in March 1930, President Herbert Hoover nominated John J. Parker to fill the vacancy on the court. The Senate rejected Parker and Hoover quickly nominated Roberts as his second choice for the vacancy. Roberts was easily confirmed and took his position on the court in May 1930.

On the Hughes Court, Roberts was a swing vote positioned between the conservative Four Horsemen and the liberal Three Musketeers. Along with Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, Roberts&#x27;s vote often decided whether President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal legislation would be upheld. His decision to uphold the constitutionality of a state minimum wage law in &quot;West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish&quot; has been called &quot;the switch in time that saved nine&quot;. That term references the decision&#x27;s possible role in the defeat of the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, which would have expanded the Supreme Court and thus allowed Roosevelt to appoint Justices more sympathetic to his policies. Roberts&#x27;s motivation for upholding the constitutionality of the New Deal and his role in the defeat of the bill remains a matter of debate.

Though the bill was defeated, Roosevelt&#x27;s long presidency allowed him to appoint most of the court. By the end of Roberts&#x27;s tenure, he was the lone Supreme Court Justice who was not appointed by Roosevelt. He was one of three Justices, along with Robert H. Jackson and Frank Murphy, to vote against Roosevelt&#x27;s orders for Japanese American internment camps in &quot;Korematsu v. United States&quot; as well as the lone judge to dissent in the case of &quot;Smith v. Allwright&quot;, which ruled white primaries unconstitutional. His relations with his colleagues on the Stone Court became strained and he retired in 1945. Roberts served as the Dean of his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania Law School, from 1948 to 1951. He died in Chester County, Pennsylvania in 1955.

==Early life and career==
Roberts was born in Philadelphia in 1875 and attended Germantown Academy and enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania at the age of 16 where he studied Greek, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and was the editor of &quot;The Daily Pennsylvanian&quot;. He completed his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1895 and went on to graduate &quot;summa cum laude&quot; and first in his class from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1898. Upon his graduation, he continued his association with the University of Pennsylvania Law School for the next two decades, teaching contracts and property law, and he also engaged in private legal practice. On March 1, 1912, Roberts and fellow Philadelphia lawyers William W. Montgomery Jr. and Charles L. McKeehan, founded the law firm Roberts, Montgomery &amp; McKeehan, the predecessor of the law firm Montgomery, McCracken, Walker &amp; Rhoads, LLP.

Roberts first gained notice as an assistant district attorney in Philadelphia County, a position he would hold for three years. He was appointed by President Calvin Coolidge to investigate oil reserve scandals, known as the Teapot Dome scandal. This led to the prosecution and conviction of Albert B. Fall, the former Secretary of the Interior, for bribe-taking.

==Supreme Court==
Roberts was nominated by President Herbert Hoover on May 9, 1930, as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States of the Supreme Court, to succeed Edward Terry Sanford. Hoover selected Roberts after his previous nominee, John J. Parker, had been rejected by the Senate. In contrast to Parker, Roberts was confirmed by voice vote on May 20, 1930. He took the judicial oath of office on June 2, 1930.

On the Court, Roberts was a swing vote between those, led by Justices Louis Brandeis, Benjamin Cardozo, and Harlan Fiske Stone, as well as Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, who would allow a broader interpretation of the Commerce Clause to allow Congress to pass New Deal legislation that would provide for a more active federal role in the national economy, and the Four Horsemen (Justices James Clark McReynolds, Pierce Butler, George Sutherland, and Willis Van Devanter) who favored a narrower interpretation of the Commerce Clause and believed that the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause protected a strong &quot;liberty of contract&quot;.

In 1936&#x27;s &quot;United States v. Butler&quot;, Roberts sided with the Four Horsemen and wrote an opinion striking down the Agricultural Adjustment Act as beyond Congress&#x27;s taxing and spending powers.

During his tenure on the Supreme Court, Roberts was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

===&quot;Switch in Time that Saved Nine&quot;===

Roberts switched his position on the constitutionality of the New Deal in late 1936, and the Supreme Court handed down &quot;West Coast Hotel v. Parrish&quot; in 1937, upholding the constitutionality of minimum wage laws. Subsequently, the Court would vote to uphold all New Deal programs. Since President Roosevelt&#x27;s plan to appoint several new justices as part of his &quot;Court-packing&quot; plan of 1937 coincided with the Court&#x27;s favorable decision in Parrish, many people called Roberts&#x27;s vote in that case &quot;The switch in time that saved nine,&quot; although Roberts&#x27;s vote in &quot;Parrish&quot; occurred several months before announcement of the Court-packing plan. While Roberts is often accused of inconsistency in his jurisprudential stance towards the New Deal, legal scholars note that he had previously argued for a broad interpretation of government power in the 1934 case of &quot;Nebbia v. New York&quot;, and so his later vote in &quot;Parrish&quot; was not a complete reversal. Roberts, however, had sided with the four conservative justices in finding a similar state minimum wage in New York unconstitutional in June 1936. Because the announcement of the Parrish decision took place in March 1937, one month after Roosevelt announced his plan to pack the court, it created speculation that Roberts had voted in favor of Washington&#x27;s state minimum wage law because he had succumbed to political pressure.

However, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes contended in his autobiographical notes that Roosevelt&#x27;s attempt to pack the court &quot;had not the slightest effect&quot; on the Court&#x27;s ruling in the Parrish case and records showed that Roberts indicated his desire to uphold Washington state&#x27;s minimum wage law two months prior to Roosevelt&#x27;s court-packing announcement in December 1936. On December 19, 1936, two days after oral arguments ended for the Parrish case, Roberts voted in favor of Washington&#x27;s state minimum wage law, but the Supreme Court was divided 4–4 because pro-New Deal Associate Justice Harlan Fiske Stone was absent due to an illness; Hughes contended that this long delay in the Parrish case&#x27;s announcement led to false speculation that Roosevelt&#x27;s court packing plan intimidated the Court into ruling in favor of the New Deal. Roberts and Hughes both acknowledged that because of the overwhelming support that had been shown for the New Deal through Roosevelt&#x27;s re-election in November 1936, Hughes was able to persuade Roberts to no longer base his votes on his own political beliefs and side with him during future votes on New Deal related policies. In one of his notes from 1936, Hughes wrote that Roosevelt&#x27;s re-election forced the court to depart from &quot;its fortress in public opinion&quot; and severely weakened its capability to base its rulings on personal or political beliefs.

===Other rulings and Roberts Commissions===

Roberts wrote the majority opinion in the landmark case of &quot;New Negro Alliance v. Sanitary Grocery Co.&quot;, , which safeguarded the right to boycott in the context of the struggle by African Americans against discriminatory hiring practices. He also wrote the majority opinion sustaining provisions of the second Agricultural Adjustment Act applied to the marketing of tobacco in &quot;Mulford v. Smith&quot;, .

Roberts was appointed by Roosevelt to head the commission investigating the attack on Pearl Harbor; his report was published in 1942 and was highly critical of the US military. An antiwar journalist, John T. Flynn, wrote at the time that Roosevelt&#x27;s appointment of Roberts
was a master stroke. What the public overlooked was that Roberts had been one of the most clamorous among those screaming for an open declaration of war. He had doffed his robes, taken to the platform in his frantic apprehensions and demanded that we immediately unite with Great Britain in a single nation. The Pearl Harbor incident had given him what he had been yelling for – America&#x27;s entrance into the war. On the war issue he was one of the President&#x27;s most impressive allies. Now he had his wish. He could be depended on not to cast any stain upon it in its infancy.
Perhaps influenced by his work on the Pearl Harbor commission, Roberts dissented from the Court&#x27;s decision upholding internment of Japanese-Americans along the West Coast in 1944&#x27;s &quot;Korematsu v. United States&quot;.

The second Roberts Commission was established in 1943 to consolidate earlier efforts on a national basis with the US Army to help protect monuments, fine arts, and archives in war zones. The commission ran until 1946, when its activities were consolidated into the State Department

Roberts also played a key role in the creation of the OSS Art Looting Investigation Unit (ALIU) which investigated and documented Nazi plunder networks in Europe.

In his later years on the bench, Roberts was the only Justice on the Supreme Court who was not appointed (or, in the case of Stone, who had become Chief Justice, promoted) by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roberts became frustrated with the willingness of the new justices to overturn precedent and with what he saw as their result-oriented liberalism as judges. Roberts dissented bitterly in the 1944 case of &quot;Smith v. Allwright&quot;, which found the white primary unconstitutional and overruled an opinion that had been written by Roberts himself a mere nine years earlier. He coined in that dissent the oft-quoted phrase that the frequent overruling of decisions &quot;tends to bring adjudications of this tribunal into the same class as a restricted railroad ticket, good for this day and train only&quot;.

===Retirement===

Roberts retired from the Court the following year, in 1945; Roberts&#x27;s relations with his colleagues had become so strained that fellow Justice Hugo Black refused to sign the customary letter acknowledging Roberts&#x27;s service on his retirement. Other justices refused to sign a modified letter that would have been acceptable to Black, and in the end, no letter was ever sent.

Shortly after leaving the Court, Roberts reportedly burned all of his legal and judicial papers. As a result, there is no significant collection of Roberts&#x27;s manuscript papers, as there is for most other modern Justices. Roberts did prepare a short memorandum discussing his alleged change of stance around the time of the court-packing effort, which he left in the hands of Justice Felix Frankfurter.

==Later life==

In 1946, Roberts was the first layperson elected to serve as President of the House of Deputies for the General Convention of the Episcopal Church (United States). He served for one convention.

While in retirement Roberts, along with Robert P. Bass, convened the Dublin Declaration, a plan to change the U.N. General Assembly into a world legislature with &quot;limited but definite and adequate power for the prevention of war&quot;.

Roberts served as the Dean of the University of Pennsylvania Law School from 1948 to 1951.

He died at his Chester County, Pennsylvania, farm known as the Strickland-Roberts Homestead after a four-month illness. He was survived by his wife, Elizabeth Caldwell Rogers, and daughter, Elizabeth Hamilton.

Germantown Academy named its debate society after Owen J. Roberts in his honor. In addition, a school district near Pottstown, Pennsylvania, the Owen J. Roberts School District, was named after him.

<text>Dwight Graydon &quot;Gray&quot; Morrow (March 7, 1934 – November 6, 2001) was an American illustrator of comics, magazine covers and paperback books. He is co-creator of the Marvel Comics muck-monster the Man-Thing and of DC Comics Old West vigilante El Diablo.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Morrow was born March 7, 1934, in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and he attended North Side High School. He recalled in 1973 that, &quot;Comic art was certainly the first artform I remember being impressed with ... [T]hose gorgeous gory newsstand spreads ...&quot; After serving as editor of his high-school yearbook, for which he did cartoons and illustration, and working a number of odd jobs including &quot;soda jerk, street repairman, tie designer, exercise boy on the race track circuit, etc.,&quot; he enrolled in the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts in Chicago, Illinois, in late summer 1954, studying two nights a week for three months under Jerry Warshaw for &quot;the total of my entire formal art training.&quot; His first formal commission &quot;was something like a bank ad or a tie design when I was still in my teens.&quot; He joined the city&#x27;s Feldkamp-Malloy art studio, later being fired. Feeling encouraged by a meeting with comic-strip artist Allen Saunders, Morrow submitted strip samples to various syndicates with no luck.

Undaunted, he moved to New York City in winter 1955 and by the following spring had met fellow young comics artists Al Williamson, Angelo Torres, and Wally Wood. He sold his first comic-book story, a romance tale, to Toby Press, which went out of business before it could be published. Morrow next did two stories for another company — a Western with original characters and an adaptation of pulp-fiction writer Robert E. Howard&#x27;s &quot;The Tower of the Elephant&quot;, but this company, too, went defunct. He then worked for Williamson and Wood doing backgrounds and layouts, and through Williamson began contributing to Atlas Comics, the 1950s iteration of Marvel Comics, drawing several supernatural-fantasy stories plus at least four Westerns and one war story on titles cover-dated July 1956 to June 1957.

Morrow illustrated several stories for EC Comics in the 1950s, including horror, suspense and science fiction. He later did covers and stories for the company&#x27;s New Trend comics and Picto-Fiction magazines.

In late 1956, Morrow was drafted into the U.S. Army. Stationed at Incheon and Wolmido Island, South Korea, with Fox Company, he did &quot;illustrations and paintings for the officers&#x27; club, day rooms, insignias on helmets for their parades ... you know, anything and everything. That was my official duty.&quot; After being discharged in 1958, &quot;My friend Angelo Torres took me around to a couple of his clients, one being &#x27;Classics&#x27; [i.e., the Gilberton Company, publisher of the &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot; comic-book series of literary adaptations], and I was given a script. One thing led to another and I was soon working on a regular basis.

Prior to his Gilberton stint, Morrow contributed to one of the first black-and-white horror-comics magazines, the Joe Simon-edited &quot;Eerie Tales&quot; #1 (Nov. 1959) from Hastings Associates, penciling and inking two four-page stories by an unknown writer, &quot;The Stalker&quot; and &quot;Burn!&quot;

===1960s to 1970s===
In the early 1960s, Morrow anonymously illustrated three literary adaptations for &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot;: &quot;The Octopus&quot; by Frank Norris (#159, Nov. 1960); &quot;Master of the World&quot; by Jules Verne (#163, July 1961); and &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Necklace&quot; by Alexandre Dumas (#165, Jan. 1962), which he said he penciled and inked at the rate of &quot;eight pages a day ... as fast as I&#x27;ve ever been able to go&quot; since &quot;I&#x27;d moved to California and needed those checks badly.&quot; Morrow also supplied drawings for chapters in &quot;Classics Illustrated Special Issue&quot; #159A, &quot;Rockets, Jets and Missiles&quot; (Dec. 1960), and in 13 &quot;World Around Us&quot; issues ranging from &quot;Prehistoric Animals&quot; (Nov. 1959) to &quot;Famous Teens&quot; (May 1961). One of those, #W28, &quot;Whaling&quot; (Dec. 1960), resulted in unexpected controversy when he accurately depicted African-American whalers:

In the end, the problematic chapter, &quot;The Long Voyage&quot;, retained what one comics historian called &quot;a respectable number of African-American whalemen.&quot; Morrow, however, recalled, &quot;[T]hey had me make them all white. I had to change their features.&quot;

Concurrently, Morrow also illustrated entries in the Bobbs-Merrill juvenile book series &quot;Childhood of Famous Americans&quot;, continuing with that publisher after Gilberton ceased production of new titles. Morrow&#x27;s art appears in &quot;Henry Clay: Young Kentucky Orator&quot; (1963), &quot;Douglas MacArthur: Young Protector&quot; and other entries. Some, including &quot;Crispus Attucks, Black Leader of Colonial Patriots&quot;, &quot;Teddy Roosevelt, Young Rough Rider&quot;, and &quot;Abner Doubleday: Young Baseball Pioneer&quot;, were reprinted by successor publishers in the 1980s and 1990s.

Morrow next began a three-year association with Warren Publishing&#x27;s line of black-and-white horror-comics magazines in 1964, starting with the six-page story &quot;Bewitched!,&quot; written by Larry Ivie, in &quot;Creepy&quot; #1, and contributed over a dozen stories to that magazine and its sister publication &quot;Eerie&quot;, as well as to the war-comics magazine &quot;Blazing Combat&quot;, through 1967. He also painted four horror covers for Warren. For competitor Skywald Publications, he drew the eight-page &quot;The Skin And Bones Syndrome&quot; for &quot;Psycho&quot; #1 (Jan. 1971), and co-created the muck-monster Man-Thing, with writers Roy Thomas and Gerry Conway, in Marvel Comics&#x27; first entry into the adult-oriented comics-magazine market, the black-and-white &quot;Savage Tales&quot; #1 (May 1971). 
By 1970, Morrow was married to Betty Morrow, who wrote a story he drew, &quot;The Journey&quot;, in the early independent comic &quot;witzend&quot; #7 (1970). That same year he returned to color comics, drawing several supernatural-fantasy stories for DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Witching Hour&quot;, &quot;House of Secrets&quot; and &quot;House of Mystery&quot;, as well as a smattering of romance and superhero tales. He also drew Western stories, and with writer Robert Kanigher co-created the Old West vigilante El Diablo in &quot;All-Star Western&quot; #2 (Oct. 1970). He did a small amount of work for Marvel during this time, with the cover and a romance story for &quot;My Love&quot; #14 (Nov. 1971), a Man-Thing cover and story in &quot;Adventure into Fear&quot; #10 (Oct. 1972), two &quot;Gullivar Jones, Warrior of Mars&quot; stories in &quot;Creatures on the Loose&quot; #20-21 (Nov. 1972 - Jan. 1973), and virtually his only Marvel superhero story, a 10-page Falcon feature in &quot;Captain America&quot; #144 (Dec. 1971).

By 1973, Morrow had served as an uncredited ghost artist or art assistant on the syndicated comic strips &quot;Rip Kirby&quot; by John Prentice, &quot;Secret Agent X-9&quot; by Al Williamson and &quot;Big Ben Bolt&quot; by John Cullen Murphy. He took over the &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; strip in 1979 and the &quot;Tarzan&quot; Sunday strip from 1983 to 2001. He recalled trying out for &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;, saying he provided a sample &quot;when [strip creator] Hal Foster decided to go into semi-retirement. It was done in August and published in October or November of &#x27;71. It was done as a sample when Foster interviewed [me] and a couple of others (Wally Wood and John Cullen Murphy) to take over.&quot;

Through 1974 and early 1975, he edited and frequently drew stories for Archie Comics&#x27; imprint of non-teen-humor titles, Red Circle Comics, including &quot;Chilling Adventures in Sorcery&quot;, its successor &quot;Red Circle Sorcery&quot;, and the single-issue &quot;The Super Cops&quot;, based on two real-life New York City Police Department detectives. Following this, he specialized in covers and stories for such black-and-white Marvel magazines as &quot;Masters of Terror&quot;, &quot;Unknown Worlds of Science Fiction&quot; and &quot;Marvel Preview&quot;. Afterward, through 1976, he was art director of Charlton Comics&#x27; black-and-white magazine &quot;Space: 1999&quot;, based on the . Active in the early independent comics of the 1970s, Morrow contributed mostly spot illustrations, covers and pinups rather than stories to titles including publisher David Jablin&#x27;s &quot;Imagination&quot; #1 (1971); Mark Feldman&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Damned&quot; #4 (1971); John Carbonaro&#x27;s &quot;Phase&quot; #1 (Sept. 1971); Doug Murray &amp; Richard Garrison &quot;Heritage&quot; #1A and 1B (1972); and Gary Berman &amp; Adam Malin&#x27;s &quot;Infinity&quot; #2, 3B, 4-5 (1970?-1973).
In 1978, he began publishing, in &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; magazine, a series of stories that would be collected in 2012 as chapters of the sword and sorcery graphic novel &quot;Orion&quot;. Likewise, his &quot;Playboy&quot; feature &quot;Amora&quot;, which he both wrote and drew, was collected as &quot;Heritage presents ... Amora&quot;, from the Forest Park, Georgia publisher Heritage in 1971. He illustrated and colored each of the several Roger Zelazny stories that the author self-adapted for the 96-page graphic short-story collection &quot;The Illustrated Roger Zelazny&quot;, produced by Byron Preiss Enterprizes and published by Baronet Publishing in February 1979.
In addition to comics, Morrow in the 1960s and 1970s was an illustrator for many science-fiction magazines, with examples of his work gracing most of the covers of the American version of the Perry Rhodan paperback-book series. He did regular interior artwork for &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; from 1964 to 1968 including the illustrations for the original Galaxy Science Fiction publication of the Hugo-winning novella &quot;Soldier, Ask Not&quot; by Gordon R. Dickson. Additionally, he drew for satirical-humor magazine &quot;National Lampoon&quot;

===Later career===
In the 1980s, he wrote and drew Pacific Comics&#x27; three-issue &quot;Edge of Chaos&quot; (July 1983 - Jan. 1984), a science-fiction retelling of the story of the Greek gods. Through the decade he did sporadic but diverse work for Marvel and DC, ranging from stories of Lois Lane to those of Mark Hazzard: Merc, as well as horror and science-fiction stories for Eclipse Comics; satirical humor for &quot;Cracked&quot;; &quot;The Sex Vampires from Outer Space&quot; and other stories for the same publisher&#x27;s black-and-white comics magazine &quot;Monsters Attack&quot;; and &quot;Marvel Graphic Novel: Dreamwalker&quot; (1989), a 63-page superhero/espionage thriller written by actors Miguel Ferrer and Bill Mumy. He drew the comics adaptations of the &quot;Sheena&quot; and &quot;Supergirl&quot; movies in 1984. Morrow briefly drew DC&#x27;s &quot;Spectre&quot; series in 1988.

The following decade, continuing his trend of wide-ranging work, he drew the superhero feature &quot;Powerline&quot;, by writers D. G. Chichester and Margaret Clark, in several issues of the Marvel/Epic Comics anthology &quot;A Shadowline Saga: Critical Mass&quot;; inked Michael Davis Lawrence on writer Mike Grell&#x27;s DC Comics miniseries &quot;Shado: Song of the Dragon&quot; #1-4; contributed to DC&#x27;s &quot;The Big Book of ...&quot; trade paperback line of non-fiction vignettes on a variety of topics; drew the Historical Souvenir Co.&#x27;s 40-page, non-fiction &quot;Epic Battles of the Civil War #2 - Shiloh&quot; (1998); drew children&#x27;s Mighty Morphin Power Rangers adventurers for Hamilton Comics and adult-oriented stories for &quot;Penthouse Comix&quot;; and did work for such independent comics publishers as Aardwolf Publishing, Dark Horse Comics and NBM, and the underground comix publisher Rip Off Press. His last new work was his posthumously published contribution, with four other artists, to the 10-page story &quot;Letters From a Broken Apple&quot;, written by Neil Kleid, in Alternative Comics&#x27; benefit one-shot &quot;9-11 Emergency Relief&quot; (Jan. 2002).

===Other work===
Morrow worked in television animation, including on a &quot;Spider-Man&quot; TV series, and was a member of The Animation Guild, I.A.T.S.E. Local 839.

He painted or drew the theatrical one-sheet for the Al Adamson horror film &quot;Five Bloody Graves&quot; (1970), and drew the King Kong cover of the premiere issue of &quot;The Monster Times&quot;.

===Personal life===
By 1973, when he was living in Brooklyn, Morrow was married with a family that included adopted children.

He was living in Kunkletown, Pennsylvania, and suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s disease when he died November 6, 2001, from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He was survived by his later wife, Pocho Morrow.

==Awards==
Morrow was nominated for the Hugo Award for best professional artist in 1966, 1967, and 1968. In 2005, he was posthumously inducted into the Oklahoma Cartoonists Associates Hall of Fame in Pauls Valley, Oklahoma, located in the Toy and Action Figure Museum.

<text>Marcus Whitman (September 4, 1802 – November 29, 1847) was an American physician and missionary. He is most well known for leading American settlers across the Oregon Trail, unsuccessfully attempting to Christianize the Cayuse Indians, and was subsequently killed by the Cayuse Indians in an event known as the 1847 Whitman massacre, over a misunderstanding, resulting in the beginning of the Cayuse war (1847–1855).

In 1836, Marcus Whitman led an overland party by wagon to the West. He and his wife, Narcissa, along with Reverend Henry Spalding and his wife, Eliza, and William Gray, founded a mission near present-day Walla Walla, Washington in an effort to convert local Indians to Christianity. In the winter of 1842, Whitman went back east, returning the following summer with the first large wagon train of settlers across the Oregon Trail. These new settlers encroached on the Cayuse Indians living near the Whitman Mission and were unsuccessful in their efforts to Christianize the tribe. Following the deaths of many nearby Cayuse from an outbreak of measles, some remaining Cayuse accused Whitman of murder, suggesting that he had administered poison and was a failed shaman. In retaliation, a group of Cayuse killed the Whitmans and eleven other settlers on November 29, 1847, an event that came to be known as the Whitman massacre. This led to continuing warfare between settlers and the Cayuse which reduced their numbers further.

==Early life==
On September 4, 1802, Whitman was born in Federal Hollow, New York to Beza and Alice Whitman. After Beza&#x27;s death when Whitman was seven, he was sent to Massachusetts to live with his uncle.

Whitman dreamed of becoming a minister but did not have the money for such schooling. He returned to New York as a young man. He studied medicine for two years with an experienced physician under the form of apprenticeship approved then, and received his degree from Fairfield Medical College in New York. He practiced medicine for a few years in Canada but was interested in going to the west.

==Missionary==
In 1835, Whitman traveled with the missionary Samuel Parker to present-day northwestern Montana and northern Idaho, to minister to bands of the Flathead and Nez Perce nations. During this journey, he treated several fur trappers during an outbreak of cholera. At the end of their stay, he promised the Nez Perce that he would return with other missionaries and teachers to live with them.

Parker and Whitman were present for the 1835 Rocky Mountain Rendezvous.

==Marriage and family==
In 1836, Whitman married Narcissa Prentiss, a teacher of physics and chemistry. She had also been eager to travel west as a missionary, but she had been unable to do so as a single woman. Their only daughter, Alice Clarissa, born on March 14, 1837, was the first Anglo-American child born in Oregon Country. She was named after her grandmothers but drowned in the Walla Walla River at age two.

As settlers came in increasing numbers, the Whitmans took in eleven orphaned children, including the adoption of the Sager orphans. They also established a kind of boarding school for settlers&#x27; children at their mission.

==The way west==
On May 25, 1836, the Whitmans, and a group of other missionaries including Henry H. Spalding and Eliza Hart Spalding, joined a caravan of fur traders and traveled west. The fur company caravan was led by the mountain men Milton Sublette and Thomas Fitzpatrick. The fur traders had seven covered wagons, each pulled by six mules. An additional cart drawn by two mules carried Milton Sublette, who had lost a leg a year earlier and walked on a &quot;cork&quot; one made by a friend.

The combined group arrived in time for the fur-traders&#x27; annual Rocky Mountain Rendezvous.

The group established several missions as well as Whitman&#x27;s settlement at a Cayuse settlement called Waíilatpu (Why-ee-laht-poo) in the Cayuse language, meaning &quot;People of the Place of the Rye Grass&quot;. It was located just west of the northern end of the Blue Mountains. The present-day city of Walla Walla, Washington developed six miles to the east. The settlement was in the territory of both the Cayuse and the Nez Perce tribes. Whitman farmed and provided medical care, while Narcissa set up a school for the Native American children.

In 1842, Whitman traveled east, and on his return, he accompanied the first large group of wagon trains west. Known as the &quot;Great Emigration&quot;, the 1843 expedition established the viability of the Oregon Trail for later homesteaders. Not having much success with converting the Cayuse, the Whitmans gave more attention to the settlers. They took in children to their own home and established a boarding school for settlers&#x27; children.

==Massacre==

The Cayuse resented the encroachment of white settlers. More significantly, the influx of settlers in the territory brought new infectious diseases to the Indian Tribes, including a severe epidemic of measles in 1847. The Native Americans&#x27; lack of immunity to Eurasian diseases resulted in high death rates, with children dying in large numbers. The Whitmans cared for both Cayuse and white settlers, but half of the Cayuse died and nearly all the Cayuse children perished. Seeing that more whites had survived, the Cayuse blamed the Whitmans for the devastating deaths among their people.

The Cayuse tradition held medicine men personally responsible for the patient&#x27;s recovery. Their despair at the deaths, especially of their children, led the Cayuse under Chief Tiloukaikt to kill the Whitmans in their home on November 29, 1847. Warriors destroyed most of the buildings at &quot;Waiilatpu&quot; and killed twelve other white settlers in the community, kidnapping many children and forcibly marrying them in certain cases. The events became known among white settlers as the Whitman massacre. The Cayuse held another 53 women and children captive for a month before releasing them through negotiations. These events, and continued white encroachment, triggered a continuing conflict between the settlers and the Cayuse that became known as the Cayuse War. Five Cayuse were hanged for murder.

Historians have noted contemporary accounts of competition between the Protestant missionaries and Catholic priests, who had become established with Jesuit missions from Canada and St. Louis, Missouri, as contributing to the tensions. The Roman Catholic priest John Baptiste Brouillet aided the survivors and helped bury the victims. Two days later Brouillet encountered Rev. Henry H. Spalding on his way to the Whitmans&#x27;, told him what had happened, and warned him that he might be in danger. Spalding later wrote a pamphlet stating forcefully that the Catholic priests, including Father Brouillet, had incited the Cayuse to massacre.

Spalding&#x27;s version of the disaster was printed and reprinted, sometimes at taxpayer expense, for the next half-century.

==Legacy and honors ==
Whitman is commemorated by Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, the Wallowa–Whitman National Forest, Mount Rainier&#x27;s Whitman Glacier, and numerous schools, including Marcus Whitman Middle School in Port Orchard, Washington; Marcus Whitman Junior High School in Seattle, Washington; and Marcus Whitman Central School in Rushville, New York, his hometown. His mission is preserved as Whitman Mission National Historic Site. While the name is not used much now, the road from Penn Yan, New York to Rushville, New York was formerly called the Marcus Whitman Highway. Fort Whitman (active 1900–1947) located near LaConner, Washington was named for him.

The Washington State Legislature has declared the fourth day of September as Marcus Whitman Day. A bronze tablet in Wheeler, New York commemorates his 1828–1835 practice as a medical doctor in that town. In 1977, he was inducted into Steuben County, New York&#x27;s Hall of Fame. Walla Walla has a Marcus Whitman Hotel and Conference Center.

In 1953, the state of Washington donated a statue of him by the sculptor Avard Fairbanks to the National Statuary Hall Collection in the United States Capitol, An identical one stands at the edge of the campus of Whitman College.

===Historical importance===
Marcus Whitman&#x27;s alleged political influence over the United States&#x27; claim to the Oregon country, as well as his purported leadership role in the emigration, were greatly exaggerated in the decades following his death, leading to great controversy in popular and academic literature.

After Whitman&#x27;s death, Spalding energetically promoted the idea that Marcus Whitman had traveled east to Washington in order to &quot;save&quot; the Oregon Territory from British control by convincing the United States to send settlers to contest claims of British governance. In 1901, Yale University historian Edward Gaylord Bourne convincingly disproved this revision of history, using the historical record to demonstrate that Whitman&#x27;s trip back east was motivated by his desire to maintain the mission to convert the Native American tribes of the Northwest to Christianity and that he returned with settlers who were Protestant in order to promote (Protestant) Christianity.

<text>Fresnillo () is a city in north central Mexico, founded in 1554 by Francisco de Ibarra. It is the second largest city in Zacatecas state and the seat of Fresnillo municipality. As a rail and highway junction, Fresnillo is the center of a rich mining area known especially for silver, and the location of one of the world&#x27;s richest silver mines, the Mina Proaño or Fresnillo Mine, which belongs to the Peñoles mining company. Other important economic activities include agriculture (cereals, beans), cattle raising, and a mining school. Fresnillo is also the municipal seat of the municipality of the same name which surrounds it. The municipality had a population of 196,538 and an areal extent of .

It is the location of religious pilgrimages to see the famous &quot;Santo Niño de Atocha&quot; (&quot;Holy Child of Atocha&quot;), a Roman Catholic devotional statue brought to Mexico from Spain.

== History ==

Between 1551 and 1552, Diego Fernández de Proaño embarked on several explorations in the Zacatecas region, searching for a legendary hill purported to contain great mineral wealth. He discovered a hill, which despite not matching the descriptions given, bore evidence of rich mineral deposits, which he named &quot;Cerro de Proaño&quot; (&quot;Proaño&#x27;s Hill&quot;). He returned to the city of Zacatecas to report his findings to the Viceroy, but apparently there was not much interest in his discovery and Proaño&#x27;s Hill was forgotten over the years.

A second expedition, headed by 15-year-old Francisco de Ibarra, arrived on September 2, 1554 at a place where there was a freshwater spring, in whose border was a &quot;Pequeño Fresno&quot; (small ash). They decided to spend the night, and Francisco de Ibarra wrote his name for the place in his daily journal: &quot;Ojo de Agua del Fresnillo&quot; (&quot;spring of the small ash&quot;).

In the early years after its foundation, the town suffered incursions by Guachichil Indians who were nomadic and bellicose. Due to the heavy losses suffered by the settlers in those early years, the Viceroy, Martín Enríquez de Almanza, ordered the construction of a presidio in the town. Captain Rodrigo Río de Loza was assigned to lead the garrison of eight soldiers. The military outpost was built where the current municipal palace stands today. Among the first mayors of Fresnillo were Captain Diego Núñez de Miranda, Cristóbal Caldera and Juan de Avellaneda.

Between 1682 and 1757, the mines were worked constantly. There were several mines, mostly on the foothills of Proaño&#x27;s Hill. In 1757, the mine shafts had reached fifty meters in depth and flooding began to be a major problem. The mines were abandoned as it was economically unviable to mitigate the flooding and the area went into an economic crisis. The mine owners lost their mines as a result of seizure by the Spanish Crown for failure to repay loans. The Crown named a new administrator for the mines, but they continued to lie idle.

In 2013, Fresnillo became the first municipality in Mexican history to elect an openly gay mayor, with the election of Benjamín Medrano. The municipal palace was burned during a protest against the kidnapping, torture, and murder of a 12-year-old girl known as Sofía Alejandra N. on November 22, 2020. The girl was kidnapped and held for eleven days but the family could not come up with the money needed to pay the ransom.

In the summer of 2021, it was reported that 96% of the residents of Fresnillo felt unsafe, primarily due to the violence from drug cartels.

==The Coat of Arms of Fresnillo==
In the superior part of the shield is the Latin phrase: &quot;Orat Atque Laborat Ab Urbe Condita&quot;, which means: &quot;Since its Founding a City that Works and Prays&quot;. The lower part reads, &quot;Real de Minas del Fresnillo (Royal Mine of Fresnillo)&quot;. In the center the horizontal bar reads: &quot;2 de Septiembre de 1554&quot;.

The coat of arms is divided into three boxes: first in the left superior part, there appears the Virgin of Candlemas, Pattern of Fresnillo, which is identified by the candle in her right hand. In the box on the right superior part, there is a rodela or shield and the arms used by the natives and the Spaniards during the Conquest. In the inferior part (the third box) there appears a spring, in whose margin there is an Ash tree, and a depiction of the bottom of the Proaño Hill with some clouds, symbolizing the rainy month of September. &quot;2 of September of 1554&quot;.

==Plateros==
Fresnillo, Zacatecas is often connected with Plateros, a nearby mining town that attracts many religious believers to the area. The church was built in the late 1690s in commemoration of Spanish miners finding a miraculous silver crucifix. The crucifix is said to have appeared in a wooden crate without knowledge of its creation. Spiritual devotion and respect resulted in the cross-Atlantic travel of a statue of the Our Lady of Atocha. The statue has the Virgin Mary carrying an infant Jesus in her arms. This infant statue became known as the Holy Child of Atocha.

Many claim that miracles result from the devout prayer to this Holy Child. Those who truly believe that the Holy Child worked in their favor will often bring back a gift in gratitude. In 1883, a separate building was constructed to house the various gifts followers brought back to him.

Today, many families who have religious connections to this saint will travel far in pilgrimage and attend mass as they visit the shrine. The saint itself is said to be a Zacatecas iconic piece, as well as a guardian of miners.

==Agriculture==
Agriculture is of great importance. The city is a great producer of various crops, including corn, pepper, tomato, among others. The neighboring towns and villages will focus on exporting its goods to the main city, as well as others. Economic sustainability is often connected to its agricultural success, along with silver mining.

<doc id="702254" wikidata="Q298278" url="?curid=702254" title="Esophageal varices">
<text>Esophageal varices are extremely dilated sub-mucosal veins in the lower third of the esophagus. They are most often a consequence of portal hypertension, commonly due to cirrhosis. People with esophageal varices have a strong tendency to develop severe bleeding which left untreated can be fatal. Esophageal varices are typically diagnosed through an esophagogastroduodenoscopy.

==Pathogenesis==

The upper two thirds of the esophagus are drained via the esophageal veins, which carry deoxygenated blood from the esophagus to the azygos vein, which in turn drains directly into the superior vena cava. These veins have no part in the development of esophageal varices. The lower one third of the esophagus is drained into the superficial veins lining the esophageal mucosa, which drain into the left gastric vein, which in turn drains directly into the portal vein. These superficial veins (normally only approximately 1 mm in diameter) become distended up to 1–2 cm in diameter in association with portal hypertension.

Normal portal pressure is approximately 9 mmHg compared to an inferior vena cava pressure of 2–6 mmHg. This creates a normal pressure gradient of 3–7 mmHg. If the portal pressure rises above 12 mmHg, this gradient rises to 7–10 mmHg. A gradient greater than 5 mmHg is considered portal hypertension. At gradients greater than 10 mmHg, blood flowing through the hepatic portal system is redirected from the liver into areas with lower venous pressures. This means that collateral circulation develops in the lower esophagus, abdominal wall, stomach, and rectum. The small blood vessels in these areas become distended, becoming more thin-walled, and appear as varicosities.

In situations where portal pressures increase, such as with cirrhosis, there is dilation of veins in the anastomosis, leading to esophageal varices. Splenic vein thrombosis is a rare condition that causes esophageal varices without a raised portal pressure. Splenectomy can cure the variceal bleeding due to splenic vein thrombosis.

Varices can also form in other areas of the body, including the stomach (gastric varices), duodenum (duodenal varices), and rectum (rectal varices). Treatment of these types of varices may differ. In some cases, schistosomiasis also leads to esophageal varices.

==Histology==

Dilated submucosal veins are the most prominent histologic feature of esophageal varices. The expansion of the submucosa leads to elevation of the mucosa above the surrounding tissue, which is apparent during endoscopy and is a key diagnostic feature. Evidence of recent variceal hemorrhage includes necrosis and ulceration of the mucosa. Evidence of past variceal hemorrhage includes inflammation and venous thrombosis.

==Prevention==

In some circumstances, people with known varices should receive treatment to reduce their risk of bleeding. The non-selective β-blockers (e.g., propranolol, timolol or nadolol) and nitrates (e.g., isosorbide mononitrate (IMN) have been evaluated for secondary prophylaxis. Non-selective β-blockers (but not cardioselective β-blockers like atenolol) are preferred because they decrease both cardiac output by β1 blockade and splanchnic blood flow by blocking vasodilating β2 receptors at splanchnic vasculature. The effectiveness of this treatment has been shown by a number of different studies.

However, non-selective β-blockers do not prevent the &quot;formation&quot; of esophageal varices.

When medical contraindications to beta-blockers exist, such as significant reactive airway disease, then treatment with prophylactic endoscopic variceal ligation is often performed.

==Treatment==
Esophageal varices may lead to severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In emergency situations, care is directed at stopping blood loss, maintaining plasma volume, correcting disorders in coagulation induced by cirrhosis, and appropriate use of antibiotics such as quinolones or ceftriaxone. Blood volume resuscitation should be done promptly and with caution. The goal should be hemodynamic stability and hemoglobin of over 8 g/dl. Resuscitation of all lost blood leads to increase in portal pressure leading to more bleeding. Volume resuscitation can also worsen ascites and increase portal pressure. (AASLD guidelines)

Therapeutic endoscopy is considered the mainstay of urgent treatment. The two main therapeutic approaches are variceal ligation (banding) and sclerotherapy.

In cases of refractory bleeding, balloon tamponade with a Sengstaken–Blakemore tube may be necessary, or the use of a fully-covered esophageal self-expandable metallic stent, usually as a bridge to further endoscopy or treatment of the underlying cause of bleeding (i.e.: portal hypertension). Esophageal devascularization operations such as the Sugiura procedure can also be used to stop complicated bleeding. Methods of treating the portal hypertension include: transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), distal splenorenal shunt procedure, or liver transplantation.

Nutritional supplementation is necessary if the person has been unable to eat for more than four days.

Terlipressin and octreotide for one to five days have also been used.

<doc id="702263" wikidata="Q633065" url="?curid=702263" title="Archibald Bulloch">
<text>Archibald Stobo Bulloch (January 1, 1730 – February 22, 1777) was an American lawyer, military officer and politician who served as the seventh governor of Georgia from 1776 to 1777. Born in the Province of South Carolina, Bulloch fought in the Georgia Militia during the American Revolution, and was also a great-grandfather of Martha Bulloch Roosevelt, and great-great-grandfather of Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th President of the United States.

==Early life==
Bulloch was born in 1730 in Charleston, South Carolina. He was the son of James Bulloch (1701–1780) and his wife Jean (daughter of Rev Archibald Stobo), both Scots, and was named after his maternal grandfather. After receiving his education in Charleston, he began to practice law and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the South Carolina militia.

The Bulloch family moved to the Province of Georgia in 1758, where in 1764 Bulloch moved to Savannah. He was elected to the colonial legislature in 1768.

==Revolution==
Bulloch was an early supporter of the revolution in Georgia as a member of the Friends of Liberty. He served as President of the 1st and 2nd Provincial Congresses of Georgia, and was a delegate in 1775 to the Continental Congress. There, he won John Adams&#x27;s praise for his &quot;Abilities and Fortitude&quot;. In the Continental Congress, he was a member of the Secret Committee, which was responsible for gathering war supplies. Speaking to the Provincial Congress, Bulloch said, &quot;This is no time to talk of moderation; in the present instance it ceases to be a virtue.&quot;

Bulloch is also recorded as having been a Freemason in Georgia. His name is listed on the 1779 Masonic rolls of Solomon&#x27;s Lodge No. 1 at Savannah along with George Walton, John Adam Treutlen, James Jackson, Nathaniel Pendelton, and General Samuel Elbert.

Bulloch would have been a signer of the Declaration of Independence, but decided to return to Georgia to aid the revolution there. He wrote to John Adams, &quot;Such a series of Victory having attended the American Arms, emboldens us further to trust in Providence, that has so remarkably interposed in our behalf, and we cannot but entertain the most sanguine Hopes, of still preserving our most invaluable Liberties.&quot; Adams was disappointed that Bulloch would not be able to sign the Declaration, saying, &quot;I was greatly disappointed, Sir, in the information you gave me, that you should be prevented from revisiting Philadelphia.&quot;

In 1776, Bulloch fought under the command of Colonel Lachlan McIntosh in the Battle of the Rice Boats and the Battle of Tybee Island. On June 20, 1776, he was chosen to be the first President and Commander-in-Chief of Georgia under the state&#x27;s temporary republican government. When he signed the state constitution on February 20, 1777, his position transferred from president to governor of Georgia. He was thus Georgia&#x27;s first chief executive under a proper constitutional government, but the third chief executive in all, following the brief tenures of presidents William Ewen and George Walton.

== Death ==
Bulloch died in Savannah while preparing to defend against the British invasion of Georgia in 1777. There is some speculation that he was poisoned, although this has never been proven. His death was a severe blow, as his was the only leadership that united the Whig factions in the troubled young state. He is buried in Savannah&#x27;s Colonial Park Cemetery.

==Personal life==
On October 10, 1764, Bulloch was married to Mary De Veaux (1748–1818), the daughter of Ann (née Fairchild) De Veaux and Col. James De Veaux, a prominent Savannah landowner. Together, they were the parents of:

* Archibald Stobo Bulloch Jr. (1775–1859), who had built the Archibald Bulloch House.

* William Bellinger Bulloch (1777–1852), who later represented Georgia in the United States Senate. 

== Legacy ==
Archibald&#x27;s great-great-grandson was President Theodore Roosevelt. His great-great-great granddaughter was First Lady of the United States Eleanor Roosevelt. Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s son Archibald was named after his ancestor.

Bulloch County, Georgia, is named after him.

<text>Maryland railway station is on the Great Eastern Main Line serving the Maryland area of the London Borough of Newham, east London. It is down the line from London Liverpool Street and is situated between Stratford and . Its three-letter station code is MYL and it is in fare zone 3.

The station was opened in 1873 as Maryland Point by the Great Eastern Railway. It was renamed Maryland in 1940. It is managed and served by the Elizabeth line between and Heathrow Airport.

==History==
===Great Eastern Railway (1873–1922)===
The railway through the site of Maryland station was first built in 1839 by the Eastern Counties Railway as the first part of what was later to become the Great Eastern Main Line. Trains initially ran between and .

By the 1860s, the railways in East Anglia were in financial trouble and most were leased to the Eastern Counties Railway (ECR). Although they wished to amalgamate formally, they could not obtain government agreement for this until 1862, when the Great Eastern Railway (GER) was formed.

Maryland Point station was opened by the Great Eastern Railway on 6 January 1873.

Between Stratford and Maryland Point were some cattle pens (a staple of early ECR goods traffic) and sidings as well as two additional running lines. The new station was located just after the two track section began and is located between the bridges carrying Grove Road and Water Lane over the railway.

The area west of the station was remodelled c1877 and, in 1877 and again in 1882 the station platforms were lengthened.

As London grew, developers starting acquiring land to build new properties and the demand at stations such as Maryland Point increased. The GER realised that the two track main line was not enough to cope with the new suburban and longer distance traffic, and still provide a reliable service for the minor stations. The answer was a programme of quadrupling (providing two additional tracks) along the route and this work took place in phases. In the case of Maryland the changes were extensive.

The alignment was extended north and south of the existing station, with the original alignment in the middle of today&#x27;s platforms 2 and 3. When the station was built platforms were only built on the northernmost lines which were named the Local Lines. The other lines used for longer distance trains were named the Through Lines. Improved entrances were provided at both ends of the station with stairs down to the platforms.

In the 1870s prior to the station opening, the first signal box was located where the down platform was built. When the station was built a new signal box (1872) was provided west of Grove Road bridge. This only lasted until 1891 when the tracks were re-aligned due to the quadrupling through the station area and the new box was situated slightly to the south between the two sets of running lines. At the same time a short lived signal box existed at Maryland Point East Junction where the four tracks went down to two tracks, but once the four tracks were extended to , the junction was abolished and there was no need for the signal box.

In 1907 the station was equipped with electric lighting.

Table 298 of the Bradshaw&#x27;s timetable guide of July 1922 shows Maryland Point to have a regular services of trains from Liverpool Street or Fenchurch Street. These trains terminated at Ilford, Chadwell Heath, Romford or Gidea Park or worked through to the Fairlop Loop. 

In 1923, the GER amalgamated with other railways to form the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER).

===London and North Eastern Railway (1923–1947)===
During this period local stopping trains were generally hauled by LNER Class N7 locomotives on trains of corridor type carriage stock.
Plans were drawn up in the 1930s to electrify the suburban lines from Liverpool Street to Shenfield at 1,500VDC and work was started on implementing this. However, the outbreak of World War II, brought most of the project to a temporary halt and it was not until 1949 that the scheme was completed.

On 28 October 1940 the station was named Maryland.

The signal box was closed as part of the electrification scheme on 29 August 1946.

As part of the electrification scheme a flyover was built just north of Manor Park. The flyover was designed to remove conflicting moves between Local Line and Through Line trains and meant that Maryland, Forest Gate and Manor Park stations required new platforms to be provided on the Through Lines as these three locations only had Local Line platforms after the 1893/4 quadrupling.

However, work on Maryland station was progressed during the war years despite manpower and steel shortages. Key changes included:
* Extension of the cutting south (towards Manbey Road) for the new platform;
* Existing up platform converted to an island platform;
* Demolition of the Water Lane entrance building (dating from 1890);
* New main entrance in LNER Art deco style;
* New platform canopies;
* and, Overhead line masts.
The new station buildings, were designed by Thomas Bennett.

===British Railways (1948–1994)===
On 1 January 1948, following nationalisation of the railways, Maryland became part of the British Railways Eastern Region. The electrification scheme and its associated works were finished and from February 1949 the Class 306 EMUs operated the service to steam timings with an accelerated all electric schedule being introduced in September 1949.

The 1500 DC electrification system was converted to 25/6.35 KV AC operation between 4 and 6 November 1960.

In 1980 the first Class 315 EMUs were introduced to replace the Class 306s and were used on passenger trains serving Maryland.

The railway was sectorised in 1982 and Maryland and the trains calling at it became part of the London and South-East sector. On 10 June 1986 this was rebranded to become Network South East which was responsible for working services up to privatisation.

===The privatisation era (1994 - present day)===
In April 1994 Railtrack became responsible for the maintenance of the infrastructure. Railtrack was succeeded by Network Rail in 2002.

Between privatisation on 1 April 1994 and 4 January 1997 the station was operated by a non-privatised business unit.
Since then passenger services calling at the station have been operated by the following franchises:
* First Great Eastern 5 January 1997 – 31 March 2004
* National Express East Anglia 1 April 2004 – 4 February 2012
* Abellio Greater Anglia between 5 February 2012– 30 May 2015
* MTR TFL Rail between 31 May 2015 and 23 May 2022 after which the line was rebranded as the Elizabeth Line who are the current operator.

Maryland was added to the planned Crossrail route in 2006 after campaigning by Newham Council, the London Transport Users Committee and others. An agreement was also reached about improving access to the station.

Maryland was closed between 27 July and 12 August 2012, during the 2012 Olympic Games, as it would have been unable to cope with the large numbers of spectators who might have used it to access the venues nearby at the Olympic Park.

In June 2017, new trains began entering service in preparation for the opening of the Crossrail initially working between Liverpool Street and Shenfield.

In early 2019 step free access was introduced to Maryland station.

The Class 315 trains were finally taken out of service in 2022. Through services to central London, Heathrow Airport and Reading started running on the Crossrail line (rebranded the Elizabeth line) on 22 November 2022.

==Design==
At , the platforms are too short for Elizabeth Line trains which are over in length, and extending the platforms is impossible due to geographical constraints. Transport for London therefore makes use of selective door operation such that doors on some end carriages do not open at Maryland. Of the four platforms, only the two serving the stopping &quot;metro&quot; lines are in regular operation, the others being used only when necessary during engineering works or temporary train path diversions.

==Location==
The station is one of the primary rail access points for the residential areas in the north of Stratford and the south of Leytonstone in east London. The area surrounding the station has seen much redevelopment in the 21st century, with ongoing improvements underway related to the nearby Olympic Park. The &quot;twisted clock&quot; timepiece/sculpture formerly installed outside Stratford station was relocated to Maryland in 2010.

The Cart and Horses pub is next to the station on Maryland Point. It was an important early gig venue for the rock band Iron Maiden.

London Buses routes 69, 257, 308, school route 678 and night route N8 serve the station.

==Services==
All services at Maryland are operated by the Elizabeth line using EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 8 tph to of which 2 continue to 
* 8 tph to 

During the peak hours, the station is served by a number of additional services between London Liverpool Street and . These services do not call at .

On Sundays, the service to and from Shenfield is reduced to 4 tph, with alternating services running only as far as Gidea Park.

<text>In the Catholic Church, the Apostolic Pardon is an indulgence given for the remission of temporal punishment due to sin. The Apostolic Pardon is given by a priest, usually along with Viaticum (i.e. reception of Communion by a dying person, see Pastoral Care of the Sick, USA numbers 184, 187, 195, 201). It is not usually given as part of the sacrament of Anointing of the Sick. However, if the Anointing of the Sick is given with Viaticum, in exceptional circumstances or an emergency, it may be given then. (See Pastoral Care of the Sick, United States numbers 243, 265).

According to the Church, a person who is properly disposed by being in the state of grace - i.e., the person has committed no known and unconfessed mortal sins - who receives the Apostolic Pardon gains the complete pardon of all temporal punishment due to sin that has already been forgiven by the reception of absolution and the doing of penance, i.e., a plenary indulgence. The Apostolic Pardon does not forgive sins by the act of absolution; it deals only with the punishment (purgation) due for those sins that have already been sacramentally forgiven. However, the Sacrament of Penance, or Reconciliation, which does forgive sins, is usually administered along with the Apostolic Pardon as a part of the Last Rites.

The Church&#x27;s ritual book on the Pastoral Care of the Sick uses the term &quot;Apostolic Pardon&quot; for what elsewhere, for instance in the Enchiridion Indulgentiarum, is called the &quot;Apostolic Blessing with attached plenary indulgence&quot;. Priests are urged to impart it to the dying, but if a priest cannot be had, the Church grants a plenary indulgence, to be acquired at the moment of death, to any rightly disposed Christian who in life was accustomed to say some prayers, with the Church herself supplying the three conditions normally required for gaining a plenary indulgence (Confession, Communion and prayers for the Pope&#x27;s intentions).

==Form==
The current form of the Apostolic Pardon usually takes one of two forms;

* Latin: &quot;Ego facultáte mihi ab Apostólica Sede tribúta, indulgéntiam plenáriam et remissiónem ómnium peccatórum tibi concédo, in nómine Patris, et Fílii, + et Spíritus Sancti. Amen&quot;
* English: &quot;By the authority which the Apostolic See has given me, I grant you a full pardon and the remission of all your sins in the name of the Father, and of the Son, + and of the Holy Spirit.&quot;
* Latin: &quot;Per sancrosáncta humánæ reparatiónis mystéria, remíttat tibi omnípotens Deus omnes præséntis et futúræ vitæ pœnas, paradísi portas apériat et ad gáudia te sempitérna perdúcat. Amen.&quot;
* English: &quot;Through the holy mysteries of our redemption, may almighty God release you from all punishments in this life and in the life to come. May He open to you the gates of paradise and welcome you to everlasting joy.&quot;

The older form of the Apostolic Blessing is as follows:

* Latin: &quot;Ego facultate mihi ab Apostolica Sede tributa, indulgentiam plenariam et remissionem omnium peccatorum tibi concedo et benedico te. In nomine Patris, et Filii, + et Spirtus Sancti, Amen.&quot;
* English: &quot;By the Faculty which the Apostolic See has given me, I grant you a plenary indulgence and the remission of all your sins, and I bless you. In the Name of the Father and the Son + and the Holy Spirit. Amen.&quot;

<doc id="702302" wikidata="Q2519364" url="?curid=702302" title="First Evil">
<text>The First Evil (usually called The First) is a fictional character created by Joss Whedon for the TV series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. The First Evil first appeared in the third season episode &quot;Amends&quot;, and became the main antagonist of the seventh and final season.

A being manifested from all evil in existence, the First is an incorporeal entity that can assume the appearance of any person who has died (however briefly) – including vampires and humans who have been resurrected. Over the course of the series, and depending upon its audience, it takes various guises as a method of deception and manipulation – for example, the First usually appears as Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) to the Slayer and her allies, but it also assumes the forms of Warren Mears, Spike, Drusilla and Jonathan Levinson on multiple occasions, among a variety of other forms taken less frequently.

Its only real weakness is that it is non-corporeal, and therefore cannot cause any real physical damage. It is expert at psychological manipulation, and can act through its servants, such as the Bringers, Turok-Han, Caleb or whatever person it can manage to influence.

==Biography==
===Character history===
The First Evil claims to be the source and embodiment of all that is evil. For technical purposes, the First Evil is neither male, female, demon, nor god; it is a &quot;power&quot;. The First is older than demons, even the Old Ones, who themselves existed long before the first humans; it is older than the written word, the Big Bang and transcends all realities and dimensions; it is older than any other evil being and may even be the very first entity ever to have existed. It is said that the First lurked in the darkness long before the universe was even created and shall remain long after the universe ends. Few have heard of it and even fewer believe in its existence. The entity cannot affect the world on a physical level. Its power lies in its ability to deceive, torment and manipulate others. It can take the form of anyone who has died (or as an enormous, phantasmic demon with large horns and long, talon-shaped fingers), and it can choose to be seen and heard by just one person or by multiple people. The First has a deep understanding of human nature and it uses this knowledge to drive others to madness, murder and/or suicide.

The First makes its initial appearance in the series as a monster of the week that Angel must face in the episode &quot;Amends&quot;. It tries to drive the vampire to kill Buffy by reminding him of his &quot;true&quot; nature (Angelus) and it sets about accomplishing this by appearing to him as some of his victims: Daniel, Margaret, Travis and Jenny Calendar. It claims that it is responsible for Angel&#x27;s return from Hell, and suggests that Angel can end his sufferings by turning evil again and killing Buffy, but instead he chooses to kill himself using the sunrise. His suicide is only averted by a freak snowstorm unheard of in Southern California. Episodes of the spin-off series &quot;Angel&quot; later suggest that Angel was returned from hell and his life saved by divine intervention from the heavenly Powers That Be.

Later, the First makes its presence known again in the seventh season by tormenting the vampire Spike, who like Angel has come into possession of a soul; tricking the former villain Andrew Wells into awakening the Hellmouth beneath Sunnydale High; and dispatching its agents, the Bringers, to kill young women around the world with the potential to succeed Faith as the current Slayer. When Buffy&#x27;s allies Giles and Anya query the First&#x27;s sudden rise in activity with a mystical third party, they learn that the First is able to act in this way because of an anomaly in the Slayer line caused by Buffy&#x27;s recent resurrection, providing an outlet for the First to wipe out all the Slayers. Though incorporeal, the First is effective in prompting suicides, deceiving various members of the Buffy&#x27;s gang, and releasing evil monsters from the Hellmouth. Later in season 7, the audience is introduced to the First&#x27;s right-hand-man, the supernaturally strong misogynistic ex-priest Caleb, as well as its army of primordial Turok-Han vampires living beneath the Hellmouth. In the series finale, Buffy and her allies take the fight to the First by opening the Hellmouth and using magic to activate every potential Slayer in Buffy&#x27;s army. With additional help from a magical amulet, the gang destroy the First&#x27;s army, the Sunnydale Hellmouth, and the surrounding town.

===Powers and abilities===
Neither male or female, living or dead, the First is pure power. It is the darkness inside the hearts and souls of all living creatures. While the First has no physical body and is impossible to kill, it also cannot truly interact with the physical world. Certain people are able to interact and even become one with the First, such as Caleb.

The First appears in the physical world as dead people, including vampires, humans who have died, and dead people who have been resurrected. This allows the First to impersonate people for the purpose of manipulating others. For instance, the First appears as Warren to get Andrew to kill Jonathan during &quot;Lessons,&quot; as Eve to more easily attack the Potentials during &quot;Showtime,&quot; and as Buffy to amplify Spike&#x27;s torture throughout season 7. The First seems also to know mannerisms, information and details of the life of whoever it imitates. This is best shown in &quot;Conversations with Dead People&quot; as the First appears to Dawn as her mother Joyce, appears to Andrew as Warren and appears to Willow as Cassie Newton, in an attempt to manipulate them all into serving its purpose.

As essentially the source of all evil, the First has knowledge of every monster and dark ritual in existence. This was exemplified by the runes the Bringers carved into Spike&#x27;s chest to summon the Turok-Han.

As the First is said to be eternal, existing before time and believed to be the only thing remaining after the end of time, it is infinitely patient. A defeat it suffers is nothing more than a minor setback.

In &quot;Chaos Bleeds&quot;, the First displayed the ability to possess people, open portals, teleport beings across dimensions and, according to Sid, conjure a duplicate dummy body for him and trap his soul inside.

==Appearances==
The First Evil has appeared in 16 canonical Buffyverse episodes:

Buffy the Vampire Slayer

*Season 3 (1998)
**&quot;Amends&quot; (as Daniel, Margaret, Jenny Calendar, and Travis–name revealed in the shooting scripts).
*Season 7 (2002–2003)

**&quot;Selfless&quot; (as Buffy Summers)
**&quot;Conversations with Dead People&quot; (as Warren Mears, Cassie Newton, and Joyce Summers)
**&quot;Sleeper&quot; (as Buffy Summers and Spike)
**&quot;Never Leave Me&quot; (as Buffy Summers, Spike, Warren Mears, and Jonathan Levinson)
**&quot;Bring on the Night&quot; (as Spike and Drusilla)
**&quot;Showtime&quot; (as Buffy Summers and Eve)
**&quot;First Date&quot; (as Jonathan Levinson and Nikki Wood)
**&quot;Get It Done&quot; (as Chloe)
**&quot;Storyteller&quot; (as Warren Mears)

**&quot;Touched&quot; (as Richard Wilkins and Buffy Summers)
**&quot;End of Days&quot; (as Buffy Summers)
**&quot;Chosen&quot; (as Buffy Summers and Caleb).

The First appears in the non-canonical video game &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Chaos Bleeds&quot; as the main antagonist, having helped occultist magician Ethan Rayne escape military confinement to enact a plan for world domination. Buffy and her friends pursue the First over multiple realities and across the centuries, eventually &quot;dispersing it across dimensions&quot; to stop its plans to consume the universe with evil.

==Bringers of the First Evil==
The Bringers of the First Evil, or Harbingers of Death, are the acolytes of the First Evil. They are humans who have been corrupted by the First and undergone rituals that include self-mutilation: their eyes and tongues are removed, and their eyelids covered by rune-like scars; yet they are perfectly aware of their surroundings.

It is implied that the First&#x27;s high priest, Caleb, has played an important role in indoctrinating the Bringers. He possesses extensive knowledge of their habits (such as knowing that they pant instead of sweating) and refers to them as &quot;my boys&quot;. Indeed, The Harbingers of Death themselves refer to him as their &quot;teacher&quot;.

The Bringers also have a poisonous aura which is capable of rendering earth and living beings sterile:

: &quot;For they are the harbingers of death, nothing shall grow above or below them, no seed shall flower, neither in Man nor...&quot;

Despite their apparent disabilities, Bringers are swift assassins capable of highly organized attacks thanks to their collective consciousness, which is under the control of the First. Besides their deadly fighting skills, Bringers are also capable of summoning manifestations of the First to haunt people, and create psychic links between dreamers through their dark rituals.

In season 7, The First declared war on the Slayer line. The Bringers became assassins of Potential Slayers around the world. When the First set up camp in Sunnydale, Bringers begin to swarm the town to hunt down arriving Potentials and to unearth the Scythe, a mystic weapon created by Guardians: ancient, powerful women who cared for the Slayer.

==Analysis==
Picart and Browning describe the First Evil as &quot;evil by definition&quot;. According to Gregory Stevenson Whedon&#x27;s creation of the First Evil shows that evil is persistent. It can never stop nor be fully defeated. There is always a balance between good and evil and the characters get from one fight, that is won to the next. As the evil is an entity that can not be fully defeated, Buffy and their friends have to keep it up with an army of this entity within the last season, which can be defeated by them, while the entity continues to exist.

According to J&#x27;annine Jobling the First Evil seems to be &quot;a radical reversal of the Christian mythos&quot;. &quot;An original graced state gave way to a fallen one&quot; because of &quot;humans&#x27; disobedience and misuse of free will&quot;. According to Augustine of Hippo, a god who is perfect is not able to be the &quot;source of evil&quot;, just as the &quot;First Evil&quot; does not seem to be able to be the source of any good.

According to James B. South, Buffy Summers is not interested in the theological implications of this entity. She merely states: &quot;Alright, I get it, you&#x27;re evil.&quot; He adds that the First Evil seems to precede good. It is omnipresent and very powerful. With it, Joss Whedon was aiming to create an enemy that was neither human nor demon. It could either appear in a human form or in a demonic form.

<doc id="702306" wikidata="Q3469062" url="?curid=702306" title="The Evil of the Daleks">
<text>The Evil of the Daleks is the mostly-missing ninth and final serial of the fourth season in the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which originally aired in seven weekly parts from 20 May to 1 July 1967.

In this serial, the Doctor (Patrick Troughton) and his travelling companion Jamie (Frazer Hines), shortly after losing the TARDIS, are transported to 1866, where the Daleks force the Doctor to help them in their latest plot to implement the human factor into Dalek brains in order to &#x27;humanise&#x27; themselves into even deadlier living weapons. This serial marked the debut of Deborah Watling as the Doctor&#x27;s new companion, Victoria Waterfield. It is also notable for introducing the Dalek Emperor. Only episode two, the episode in which Victoria first appears, is held in the BBC archives; the other six remain missing.

This story was initially intended to be the last Dalek story on &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Writer Terry Nation, the creator of the Daleks, was trying to sell the Daleks to American television at the time and it was intended to give them a big send-off from the series. However, this was not to be the Doctor&#x27;s last encounter with them. Aside from a few cameos, the Daleks did not properly return to the series until &quot;Day of the Daleks&quot; in 1972. In 1993, readers of &quot;DreamWatch Bulletin&quot; voted &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot; as the best ever &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story in a special poll for the series&#x27; thirtieth anniversary.

The story was released on DVD and Blu-ray in animated form on 27 September 2021, with the surviving episode two included.

==Plot==

In 1966, the Second Doctor and Jamie watch helplessly as the TARDIS is loaded onto a lorry and driven away from Gatwick Airport. The trail leads them to an antique shop run by Edward Waterfield, who sells Victorian-style antiques that curiously seem as though they were still new. Waterfield is being coerced by the Daleks, who appear in a secret room of his shop through a time machine, and exterminate his mutinous employee Kennedy. Investigating the store, the Doctor and Jamie succumb to a booby trap that gasses them, and are dragged into the time machine by Waterfield.

They wake to find that they have been transported to 1866, and are in the house of Theodore Maxtible, Waterfield&#x27;s partner, in Kent. The two had been trying to invent a time machine using mirrors and static electricity, when the Daleks emerged from their time cabinet. The Daleks then took Waterfield&#x27;s daughter, Victoria Waterfield, hostage and forced Waterfield to travel a century forward in time to lure the Doctor into a trap by stealing the TARDIS. Waterfield is obviously fearful for his daughter&#x27;s safety and his own, but Maxtible seems to be cooperating with the Daleks.

The Daleks threaten to destroy the TARDIS unless the Doctor helps them by conducting an experiment to isolate the &quot;Human Factor&quot;, the unique qualities of human beings that have allowed them to consistently resist and defeat the Daleks. Once the Doctor has isolated the Human Factor, he will implant it into three Daleks, who will then become the precursors of a race of &quot;super&quot; Daleks, with the best qualities of humans and Daleks. To that end the Daleks want the Doctor to test Jamie by sending him to rescue Victoria, who is being kept in the house. The Doctor is strangely cooperative with the Daleks, manipulating Jamie into the rescue mission but not telling him of the nature of the test.

Jamie rescues Victoria, but she is taken prisoner again and transported through the time cabinet. The Doctor, observing how Jamie accomplished the rescue, distils the Human Factor, but suspects that there is more to the experiment than just this. Once the Human Factor is implanted in the three Daleks, they become completely human in personality and seem almost childlike, although the Doctor says their mentalities will mature quickly. This was the Doctor&#x27;s intent all along: that the human factor would lead to &quot;human&quot; Daleks that would be friendly to humanity. He christens the three Alpha, Beta, and Omega, but they soon return through the time cabinet to Skaro, the Daleks&#x27; home planet.

Waterfield discovers that Maxtible has betrayed them all to the Daleks, hoping that he will be able to learn the alchemical secret of transmuting base metals into gold. Maxtible travels to Skaro through the mirror cabinet and discovers just how ruthless the Daleks are and how empty their promises can be; he is tortured for his failure to bring the Doctor to them. Jamie, Waterfield and the Doctor are locked out of the time cabinet, but manage to use the Daleks&#x27; own short-range time machine to reach Skaro before a Dalek bomb destroys Maxtible&#x27;s house.

The trio find their way into the Dalek city and are brought before the imposing Dalek Emperor, who reveals the true reason behind the experiments and the capture of the TARDIS: by isolating the human factor, the Doctor has succeeded in isolating the &quot;Dalek Factor&quot; as well. The Daleks will use the &quot;Dalek Factor&quot;—the qualities that make them relentless killing machines—to reconvert the &quot;human&quot; Daleks. The Emperor also wants the Doctor to use the TARDIS to spread the &quot;Dalek Factor&quot; throughout human history, turning all humanity into Daleks. The Doctor knows that the Emperor realises that he would die before complying with this order, and so is concerned about why the Emperor seems so confident.

Maxtible is tricked into walking through an archway that infuses him with the &quot;Dalek Factor,&quot; mentally turning him into a Dalek. He hypnotises the Doctor and lures him through the arch as well, apparently converting him. However, the Doctor is feigning his conversion and secretly plants a device on the arch while the Daleks hunt for the three &quot;human&quot; Daleks. As one still remains to be found, the Doctor suggests that all the Daleks be put through the conversion arch so that the &quot;human&quot; Dalek will once again be infused with the &quot;Dalek Factor.&quot;

As the first batch of Daleks go through the arch, the Doctor frees the others. The arch did not work on the Doctor because it was calibrated for humans, and he is not one. The Doctor has also substituted the Human Factor for the Dalek Factor on the arch, so the Daleks that go through will become &quot;human&quot; and rebel against the Emperor. The Emperor calls out his Black Daleks as the rebellion spreads and the city falls into chaos. Waterfield throws himself in front of a Black Dalek blast meant for the Doctor; the Doctor promises that Victoria will be taken care of, and Waterfield dies content. The Emperor is attacked by the &quot;human&quot; Daleks.

While the Doctor and his companions escape, Maxtible rushes back into the exploding city, screaming of the everlasting glory of the Dalek race. 
The Doctor tells Jamie that they will be taking the now-orphaned Victoria along on their travels. Jamie, Victoria and the Doctor watch the Dalek City in flames from the top of a hill as the civil war continues. The Doctor pronounces this the end of the Daleks – the final end. However, a pulsating light is seen coming from the Emperor, indicating that the Dalek is still alive.

==Production==

===Cast notes===
Patrick Troughton only appears in pre-filmed insert scenes for the fourth episode, as he was on holiday. Likewise Deborah Watling only appears in a pre-filmed scene in episode four. John Bailey, who played Edward Waterfield, had previously appeared in &quot;The Sensorites&quot;, and would later appear in &quot;The Horns of Nimon&quot;.

According to the short BBC Video documentary &quot;The Dalek Factor&quot; about the making of the story, released in September 2021 as part of the animated restoration of the serial, Denise Buckley was cast in the role of Victoria Waterfield by director Derek Martinus. The production team had been hoping that Pauline Collins would continue in the role of Samantha Briggs, that she had played in the previous story &quot;The Faceless Ones&quot;, but had created Victoria as a back-up should Collins decline. When Collins confirmed she did not want to join the regular cast, it was decided to introduce Victoria as the new companion and Denise Buckley was released, but paid in full, with Deborah Watling replacing her as a more suitable actress for the ongoing role.

===Missing episodes===
This story was wiped from the BBC&#x27;s archives by the mid-1970s. Only episode 2 remains, in a telerecording found at a car boot sale then returned to the archive in mid-1987, alongside Episode 3 of &quot;The Faceless Ones&quot;.

In 2004, analysis of the repeated clip used in &quot;The Wheel in Space&quot; episode six revealed it to be from episode one rather than episode two, as had been long believed. This, however, only constitutes a few frames of recovered footage. The discovery of a behind-the-scenes film, &quot;The Last Dalek&quot;, made by the special effects team as they worked on the story&#x27;s conclusion, facilitated a recreation of the climactic battle scenes. This recreation, along with the entire film, have been made available in different forms on various Troughton releases, and has often been used to fill in for the missing climax of Episode 7 in fan-made reconstructions, to give fans an idea of what it looked like when it first aired. In addition, tele-snaps and off-air audio recordings made by fans upon the original broadcasts exist for the entire story.

==Broadcast and reception==

 Episode is missing

&quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot; aired on BBC1 from 20 May to 1 July 1967. Most episodes were shown at 5:45 p.m., except Episode One was shown at 6 p.m. due to the FA Cup coverage, and Episode Seven was broadcast at 6:25 p.m. because of Wimbledon. Episode One, with 4.3 million homes, was the highest rated children&#x27;s programme for May; Episode Six was the second most-watched in June (3.35 million homes); and Episode Seven was third for July with 2.9 million homes. The most-watched episode was Episode One, coming in 37th place with 8.1 million viewers.

The story was repeated in 1968 at the end of Season 5 (8 June 1968 to 22 June 1968 and 13 July 1968 to 3 August 1968 allowing for a two-week break for coverage of the 1968 Wimbledon tennis championships) at 5.15pm. At the end of &quot;The Wheel in Space&quot;, the Doctor used a telepathic display machine to show new companion Zoe Heriot the sort of monsters she would face if she joined the TARDIS crew, and shows a clip from the end of episode 1 of &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot;. Over the following weeks (bridging the gap between Seasons 5 and 6) the entire story was shown, narration over the opening scene of episode 1 reminding viewers of the reason for the repeat. This was the only time any &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episodes (other than the first episode) were reshown in the 1960s. The repeat viewing figures were 6.3, 5.0, 6.3, 5.0, 5.1, 4.5, 5.2 million viewers respectively.

Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping gave the serial a positive review in &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; (1995), describing it as &quot;a grandiose production which papers over its scientifically implausible aspects with a confident swagger.&quot; In &quot;The Television Companion&quot; (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker noted how &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot; paid tribute to the series&#x27; past, and praised Whitaker&#x27;s writing and the production values. In 2009, Patrick Mulkern of &quot;Radio Times&quot; awarded it five stars out of five and wrote that the story &quot;boasts an intriguing mystery, well-drawn characters, atmospheric settings and thrilling set-pieces&quot;, though it did have an &quot;overly elaborate&quot; plot. He particularly praised Jamie, as well as the incidental music.

In the &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; poll for the show&#x27;s 60th anniversary in 2023, &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot; was voted the sixth best story of the Second Doctor&#x27;s tenure, out of a total of 21. Charlie Jane Anders ranked the serial as the 50th best &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story (out of 254) in 2015, writing, &quot;Some amazing stuff here, including remorseful Victorian mad scientists and Daleks playing trains, plus the first meeting with the Emperor Dalek.&quot;

===Broadcast of recreation===
The animated reconstruction mentioned under Home Media was shown on BBC America on Saturday, October 30, 2021, from 8 AM to 11:30 AM, the day before the release of &quot;The Halloween Apocalypse&quot; (Extended Cut), the first episode of the thirteenth series of the revived series.

==On stage==
In 2006 the BBC and the Terry Nation estate licensed a charity stage version of the serial. It was adapted and directed by Nick Scovell, who also starred as the Doctor. Production was by Rob Thrush, who provided the Dalek voices, and the orchestral score was by Martin Johnson. The production ran at the New Theatre Royal, Portsmouth between 25 and 28 October 2006, playing to sell-out houses during its five-night run. £15,000 was raised towards the restoration of the theatre, with an additional £550 going to Children in Need.
==Commercial releases==

===In print===

Doctor Who Books, an imprint of Virgin Books, published a novelisation of this serial by John Peel in August 1993. It was the last serial of the original series to be novelised as part of Target&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who Library&quot;, due to copyright clearance difficulties from the Daleks&#x27; creator Terry Nation.

Another adaptation written by Frazer Hines was released in hardcover 26 October 2023. This adaptation follows the Doctor showing Zoe the story at the end of &quot;The Wheel in Space&quot;. An abridged version of this adaptation was released as a Target paperback exclusively with &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; #609 on 10 October 2024.

===Home media===

As with all missing episodes, off-air recordings of the soundtrack exist due to contemporary fan efforts. In 1992 a set was released on audiocassette, accompanied by linking narration from the Fourth Doctor, Tom Baker. However, due to problems with background music clearance the scenes set in the Tricolour in episode one had to be deleted. Subsequently, better quality copies of the soundtrack emerged and in 2003, the remastered soundtrack was re-released with the excised scenes restored (albeit with the song &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; changed to &quot;Hold Tight!&quot;) and with new narration by Frazer Hines. This CD release contains bonus tracks featuring the end of &quot;Episode 7&quot; without narration, raw dialogue and sound effect recordings and the narrated opening to &quot;Episode 1&quot; from the 1968 repeat.

The serial was originally released on CD in the &quot;Doctor Who: Daleks&quot; collector&#x27;s tin, alongside the soundtrack to &quot;The Power of the Daleks&quot; and a bonus disc featuring &quot;My Life as a Dalek&quot;, a historical documentary presented by Mark Gatiss; it was re-issued individually in 2004. Hines&#x27; narrated version was released on vinyl by Demon Music Group on 19 July 2019. To promote the vinyl release, an exclusive EP of the CD&#x27;s bonus tracks was bundled with the &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; of &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; issue 539.

In 1992, the sole surviving episode was featured in the &quot;Daleks: The Early Years&quot; VHS. In November 2004, the same episode was released on DVD as part of the &quot;Lost in Time&quot; box set.

The story was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 27 September 2021, with all seven episodes animated in both colour and black-and-white, with the surviving Episode 2 also included.

<doc id="702308" wikidata="Q1586088" url="?curid=702308" title="Hypoparathyroidism">
<text>Hypoparathyroidism is decreased function of the parathyroid glands with underproduction of parathyroid hormone (PTH). This can lead to low levels of calcium in the blood, often causing cramping and twitching of muscles or tetany (involuntary muscle contraction), and several other symptoms. It is a very rare disease. The condition can be inherited, but it is also encountered after thyroid or parathyroid gland surgery, and it can be caused by immune system-related damage as well as a number of rarer causes. The diagnosis is made with blood tests, and other investigations such as genetic testing depending on the results. The primary treatment of hypoparathyroidism is calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Calcium replacement or vitamin D can ameliorate the symptoms but can increase the risk of kidney stones and chronic kidney disease. Additionally, medications such as recombinant human parathyroid hormone or teriparatide may be given by injection to replace the missing hormone.

==Signs and symptoms==
The main symptoms of hypoparathyroidism are the result of the low blood calcium level, which interferes with normal muscle contraction and nerve conduction. As a result, people with hypoparathyroidism can experience paresthesia, an unpleasant tingling sensation around the mouth and in the hands and feet, as well as muscle cramps and severe spasms known as &quot;tetany&quot; that affect the hands and feet. Many also report a number of subjective symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, bone pain and insomnia. Crampy abdominal pain may occur. Physical examination of someone with hypocalcemia may show tetany, but it is also possible to provoke tetany of the facial muscles by tapping on the facial nerve (a phenomenon known as Chvostek&#x27;s sign) or by using the cuff of a sphygmomanometer to temporarily obstruct the blood flow to the arm (a phenomenon known as Trousseau&#x27;s sign of latent tetany).

A number of medical emergencies can arise in people with low calcium levels. These are seizures, severe irregularities in the normal heart beat (specifically prolongation of the QT interval), as well as spasm of the upper part of the airways or the smaller airways known as the bronchi (both potentially causing respiratory failure).

=== Related conditions ===
==Causes==
Hypoparathyroidism can have the following causes:
* Removal of, or trauma to, the parathyroid glands due to anterior neck surgery (including thyroid surgery) (thyroidectomy), parathyroid surgery (parathyroidectomy). This is the most common cause of hypoparathyroidism, with 78% of cases of hypoparathyroidism arising due to a complication of anterior neck surgery. Although surgeons generally make attempts to spare normal parathyroid glands at surgery, inadvertent injury to the glands or their blood supply is still common. When this happens, the parathyroids may cease functioning. This is usually temporary but occasionally long term (permanent). Hypoparathyroidism may occur as a complication in up to 8% of anterior neck surgeries with 75% of those resolving by 6 months, and 25% of those having permanent hypoparathyroidism.
* Kenny–Caffey syndrome
* Autoimmune invasion and destruction is the most common non-surgical cause. It can occur as part of autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes.
* Hemochromatosis can lead to iron accumulation and consequent dysfunction of a number of endocrine organs, including the parathyroids.
* Absence or dysfunction of the parathyroid glands is one of the components of chromosome 22q11 microdeletion syndrome (other names: DiGeorge syndrome, Schprintzen syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome).
* Magnesium deficiency
* A defect in the calcium receptor leads to a rare congenital form of the disease
* Idiopathic (of unknown cause)
* Occasionally due to other hereditary causes (e.g. Barakat syndrome (HDR syndrome) a genetic development disorder resulting in hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness, and kidney disease)

==Mechanism==
The parathyroid glands are so named because they are usually located behind the thyroid gland in the neck. They arise during fetal development from structures known as the third and fourth pharyngeal pouch. The glands, usually four in number, contain the parathyroid chief cells that sense the level of calcium in the blood through the calcium-sensing receptor and secrete parathyroid hormone. Magnesium is required for PTH secretion. Under normal circumstances, the parathyroid glands secrete PTH to maintain a calcium level within normal limits, as calcium is required for adequate muscle and nerve function (including the autonomic nervous system).

PTH acts on several organs to regulate calcium levels and phosphorus levels. PTH acts on the kidneys to increase calcium reabsorption into the blood, and to inhibit phosphorus reabsorption (which causes phosphorus to be lost in the urine). It increases calcium and phosphorus absorption in the bowel indirectly by stimulating the kidneys to produce vitamin D which then acts on the gut. PTH also causes increase bone resorption which leads to the releases calcium and phosphorus into the blood.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is by measurement of calcium, serum albumin (for correction) and PTH in blood. If necessary, measuring cAMP (cyclic AMP) in the urine after an intravenous dose of PTH can help in the distinction between hypoparathyroidism and other causes.

Differential diagnoses are:
* Pseudohypoparathyroidism (normal PTH levels but tissue insensitivity to the hormone, associated with intellectual disability and skeletal deformities) and pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism.
* Vitamin D deficiency or hereditary insensitivity to this vitamin (X-linked dominant).
* Malabsorption
* Kidney disease
* Medication: steroids, diuretics, some antiepileptics.

Other tests include ECG for abnormal heart rhythms, and measurement of blood magnesium levels.

==Treatment==
Severe hypocalcaemia, a potentially life-threatening condition, is treated as soon as possible with intravenous calcium (e.g. as calcium gluconate). Calcium gluconate can be given via a peripheral IV, however other calcium formulations require infusion via a central venous catheter as the calcium can irritate peripheral veins and cause phlebitis. Precautions are taken to prevent seizures or larynx spasms. The heart is monitored for abnormal rhythms during IV treatment as calcium may affect cardiac conduction. When the life-threatening attack has been controlled, the person is then transitioned to long term therapy with oral or subcutaneous injection medications.

Long-term treatment of hypoparathyroidism is with vitamin D analogs (such as calcitriol or alfacalcidol), vitamin D supplementation and calcium supplementation. Potential risks of treatment for hypoparathyroidism include hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria (elevated calcium in the urine) which may lead to kidney calcification (nephrocalcinosis) and chronic kidney disease. Calcium levels in the blood and urine (along with other electrolytes) must be monitored during long-term treatment of hypoparathyroidism and blood calcium levels are intentionally kept at the lower limits of normal, or mildly low, specifically to avoid hypercalciuria, kidney calcification and kidney damage.

Recombinant human parathyroid hormone and teriparatide (which consists of the first N-terminal 34 amino acids of parathyroid hormone, the bioactive portion of the hormone)(PTH 1-34) may be used as a second line therapy in those that have not responded to conventional therapy. Both medication may be given via subcutaneous injections, but the use of pump delivery of synthetic PTH 1-34 provides the closest approach to physiologic PTH replacement therapy. Recombinant human parathyroid hormone and teriparatide are also associated with a risk of hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria with associated kidney calcification and kidney damage. If these medications are discontinued, they should be tapered and calcium levels should be closely monitored as the transient PTH depletion after stopping the medications can lead to bone leaching of calcium as a compensatory mechanism to increase calcium levels.

A 2019 systematic review has highlighted that there is a lack of high-quality evidence for the use of vitamin D, calcium, or recombinant parathyroid hormone in the management of both temporary and long-term hypoparathyroidism following thyroidectomy.

Kidney ultrasound may be considered periodically to assess for any nephrocalcinosis for those on long term therapy for hypoparathyroidism.

<doc id="702351" wikidata="Q730222" url="?curid=702351" title="Ham sandwich theorem">
<text>In mathematical measure theory, for every positive integer the ham sandwich theorem states that given measurable &quot;objects&quot; in -dimensional Euclidean space, it is possible to divide each one of them in half (with respect to their measure, e.g. volume) with a single -dimensional hyperplane. This is possible even if the objects overlap.

It was proposed by Hugo Steinhaus and proved by Stefan Banach (explicitly in dimension 3, without stating the theorem in the -dimensional case), and also years later called the Stone–Tukey theorem after Arthur H. Stone and John Tukey.

==Naming==
The ham sandwich theorem takes its name from the case when and the three objects to be bisected are the ingredients of a ham sandwich. Sources differ on whether these three ingredients are two slices of bread and a piece of ham , bread and cheese and ham , or bread and butter and ham . In two dimensions, the theorem is known as the pancake theorem to refer to the flat nature of the two objects to be bisected by a line .

==History==
According to , the earliest known paper about the ham sandwich theorem, specifically the case of bisecting three solids with a plane, is a 1938 note in a Polish mathematics journal . Beyer and Zardecki&#x27;s paper includes a translation of this note, which attributes the posing of the problem to Hugo Steinhaus, and credits Stefan Banach as the first to solve the problem, by a reduction to the Borsuk–Ulam theorem. The note poses the problem in two ways: first, formally, as &quot;Is it always possible to bisect three solids, arbitrarily located, with the aid of an appropriate plane?&quot; and second, informally, as &quot;Can we place a piece of ham under a meat cutter so that meat, bone, and fat are cut in halves?&quot; The note then offers a proof of the theorem.

A more modern reference is , which is the basis of the name &quot;Stone–Tukey theorem&quot;. This paper proves the -dimensional version of the theorem in a more general setting involving measures. The paper attributes the case to Stanislaw Ulam, based on information from a referee; but claim that this is incorrect, given the note mentioned above, although &quot;Ulam did make a fundamental contribution in proposing&quot; the Borsuk–Ulam theorem.

==Two-dimensional variant: proof using a rotating-knife==

The two-dimensional variant of the theorem (also known as the pancake theorem) can be proved by an argument which appears in the fair cake-cutting literature (see e.g. Robertson–Webb rotating-knife procedure).

For each angle formula_1, a straight line (&quot;knife&quot;) of angle formula_2 can bisect pancake #1. To see this, translate along its normal a straight line of angle formula_2 from formula_4 to formula_5; the fraction of pancake #1 covered by the line changes continuously from 0 to 1, so by the intermediate value theorem it must be equal to 1/2 somewhere along the way. It is possible that an entire range of translations of our line yield a fraction of 1/2; in this case, it is a canonical choice to pick the middle one of all such translations.

When the knife is at angle 0, it also cuts pancake #2, but the pieces are probably unequal (if we are lucky and the pieces are equal, we are done). Define the &#x27;positive&#x27; side of the knife as the side in which the fraction of pancake #2 is larger. We now turn the knife, and translate it as described above. When the angle is formula_2, define formula_7 as the fraction of pancake #2 at the positive side of the knife. Initially formula_8. The function formula_9 is continuous, since small changes in the angle lead to small changes in the position of the knife.

When the knife is at angle 180, the knife is upside-down, so formula_10. By the intermediate value theorem, there must be an angle in which formula_11. Cutting at that angle bisects both pancakes simultaneously.

==&quot;n&quot;-dimensional variant: proof using the Borsuk–Ulam theorem==

The ham sandwich theorem can be proved as follows using the Borsuk–Ulam theorem. This proof follows the one described by Steinhaus and others (1938), attributed there to Stefan Banach, for the case. In the field of Equivariant topology, this proof would fall under the configuration-space/tests-map paradigm.

Let denote the compact (or more genreral: bounded and Lebesgue-measurable) subsets of formula_12 that we wish to simultaneously bisect. Let formula_13 be the unit -sphere in formula_12. For each point on , we can define a continuum formula_15 of affine hyperplanes with normal vector : formula_16 for formula_17. For each formula_17, we call the space formula_19 the &quot;positive side&quot; of formula_20, which is the side pointed to by the vector . By the intermediate value theorem, every family of such hyperplanes contains at least one hyperplane that bisects the bounded set : at one extreme translation, no volume of is on the positive side, and at the other extreme translation, all of &#x27;s volume is on the positive side, so in between there must be a closed interval of possible values of formula_17, for which formula_20 bisects the volume of . If has volume zero, we pick formula_23 for all formula_24. Otherwise, the interval is compact and we can canonically pick formula_25 as its midpoint for each formula_24. Thus we obtain a continuous function formula_27 such that for each point on the sphere the hyperplane formula_28 bisects . Note further that we have formula_29 and thus formula_30 for all formula_24.

Now we define a function formula_32 as follows:
:formula_33.
This function is continuous (which can be proven with the dominated convergence theorem). By the Borsuk–Ulam theorem, there are antipodal points formula_34 and formula_35 on the sphere such that formula_36. Antipodal points correspond to hyperplanes formula_28 and formula_38 that are equal except that they have opposite positive sides. Thus, formula_36 means that the volume of is the same on the positive and negative side of formula_28, for formula_41. Thus, formula_28 is the desired ham sandwich cut that simultaneously bisects the volumes of .

==Measure theoretic versions==

In measure theory, proved two more general forms of the ham sandwich theorem. Both versions concern the bisection of subsets of a common set , where has a Carathéodory outer measure and each has finite outer measure.

Their first general formulation is as follows: for any continuous real function formula_43, there is a point of the -sphere and a real number &quot;s&quot;0 such that the surface divides into and of equal measure and simultaneously bisects the outer measure of . The proof is again a reduction to the Borsuk-Ulam theorem. This theorem generalizes the standard ham sandwich theorem by letting .

Their second formulation is as follows: for any measurable functions over that are linearly independent over any subset of of positive measure, there is a linear combination such that the surface , dividing into and , simultaneously bisects the outer measure of . This theorem generalizes the standard ham sandwich theorem by letting and letting , for , be the -th coordinate of .

==Discrete and computational geometry versions==

In discrete geometry and computational geometry, the ham sandwich theorem usually refers to the special case in which each of the sets being divided is a finite set of points. Here the relevant measure is the counting measure, which simply counts the number of points on either side of the hyperplane. In two dimensions, the theorem can be stated as follows:

:For a finite set of points in the plane, each colored &quot;red&quot; or &quot;blue&quot;, there is a line that simultaneously bisects the red points and bisects the blue points, that is, the number of red points on either side of the line is equal and the number of blue points on either side of the line is equal.

There is an exceptional case when points lie on the line. In this situation, we count each of these points as either being on one side, on the other, or on neither side of the line (possibly depending on the point), i.e. &quot;bisecting&quot; in fact means that each side contains less than half of the total number of points. This exceptional case is actually required for the theorem to hold, of course when the number of red points or the number of blue is odd, but also in specific configurations with even numbers of points, for instance when all the points lie on the same line and the two colors are separated from each other (i.e. colors don&#x27;t alternate along the line). A situation where the numbers of points on each side cannot match each other is provided by adding an extra point out of the line in the previous configuration.

In computational geometry, this ham sandwich theorem leads to a computational problem, the ham sandwich problem. In two dimensions, the problem is this: given a finite set of points in the plane, each colored &quot;red&quot; or &quot;blue&quot;, find a ham sandwich cut for them. First, described an algorithm for the special, separated case. Here all red points are on one side of some line and all blue points are on the other side, a situation where there is a unique ham sandwich cut, which Megiddo could find in linear time. Later, gave an algorithm for the general two-dimensional case; the running time of their algorithm is , where the symbol indicates the use of Big O notation. Finally, found an optimal -time algorithm. This algorithm was extended to higher dimensions by where the running time is formula_44. Given sets of points in general position in -dimensional space, the algorithm computes a -dimensional hyperplane that has an equal number of points of each of the sets in both of its half-spaces, i.e., a ham-sandwich cut for the given points. If is a part of the input, then no polynomial time algorithm is expected to exist, as if the points are on a moment curve, the problem becomes equivalent to necklace splitting, which is PPA-complete.

is described by

==Generalizations==
The original theorem works for at most collections, where is the number of dimensions. To bisect a larger number of collections without going to higher dimensions, one can use, instead of a hyperplane, an algebraic surface of degree , i.e., an ()–dimensional surface defined by a polynomial function of degree :

Given formula_45 measures in an –dimensional space, there exists an algebraic surface of degree which bisects them all. ().

This generalization is proved by mapping the –dimensional plane into a formula_45 dimensional plane, and then applying the original theorem. For example, for and , the 2–dimensional plane is mapped to a 5–dimensional plane via:

<text>Thomas Kirker (c. 1760February 19, 1837) was a Democratic-Republican politician from Ohio. He served as the second governor of Ohio.

==Biography==
Kirker was born in County Tyrone in the Kingdom of Ireland. He moved with his family to Lancaster, Pennsylvania in 
1779. Kirker married Sarah Smith in 1790, and moved with his wife to Kentucky. Three years later, they moved to Liberty Township, Adams County, Ohio. Kirker was a consistent Presbyterian, serving as an elder in the West Union congregation from 1808 until his death.

==Career==
He was a delegate to the Ohio Constitutional Convention in 1802. He served in the first Ohio House of Representatives in 1803 and then in the Ohio State Senate from 1803 to 1815.

While serving as Speaker of the Senate, Kirker became Governor upon the resignation of Edward Tiffin to take a seat in the U.S. Senate. Kirker&#x27;s term was extended through the 1807–1808 meeting of the Assembly due to the disqualification of Return J. Meigs Jr. who had won the 1807 election to the governorship but had been disqualified by the Assembly as he had not met the residency requirements.

Kirker ran for re-election in 1808, but lost badly to Samuel Huntington. Kirker later returned to the Assembly, serving in the House of Representatives from 1816 to 1817 and in the State Senate from 1821 to 1825.

He was the Ohio Presidential elector in 1824 for Henry Clay.

Kirker retired from politics, and returned to his home at his Liberty Township farm. He died on February 19, 1837. Upon his death he was buried in a family burial plot on the farm.

<text>The National Personnel Records Center(s) (NPRC) is an agency of the National Archives and Records Administration, created in 1966. It is part of the United States National Archives federal records center system and is divided into two large Federal Records Centers located in St. Louis, Missouri, and Valmeyer, Illinois. The term &quot;National Personnel Records Center&quot; is often used to describe both the physical Military Personnel Records Center facility and as a broader term for all records centers in the St. Louis area. To differentiate, the broader collection is occasionally called the &quot;National Personnel Records Centers&quot;.

==Military Personnel Records Center==
The Military Personnel Records Center houses U.S. Armed Forces military service records dating from the late 1800s to the early 2000s. 

In 1956, records were moved into the MPRC&#x27;s new building at 9700 Page Avenue in Overland, Missouri. The building served as the &quot;de facto&quot; headquarters for the entire National Personnel Records Center, and was often referred to simply as &quot;NPRC&quot; (the building&#x27;s official code was NPRC-MPR). A fire at the facility burned from July 12–16, 1973, destroying about one-third of its 52 million official military personnel files.

In 2011, the MPRC moved to Spanish Lake, Missouri. The designation &quot;Military Personnel Records Center&quot; was dropped from most official correspondence; the building in Spanish Lake was referred to as the &quot;National Personnel Records Center&quot;. The term &quot;National Personnel Records Center&quot; may now refer to both the physical building in Spanish Lake or all of the National Archives federal records complexes located in St. Louis.

==Civilian Personnel Records Center==

The Civilian Personnel Records Center houses the Official Personnel Folders (OPF) and Employee Medical Folders (EMF) of separated United States Federal civilian employees. CPR also houses personnel documents that date back to the mid-nineteenth century, although the bulk of the collection covers the period from 1900 to present. The medical records of military family members treated at Army, Air Force and Coast Guard medical facilities are also stored here.

The Civilian Personnel Records Center was first known as the &quot;St. Louis Federal Records Center&quot; before becoming part of the National Personnel Records Center in 1966. The Civilian Personnel Records Center was located on Winnebago Street in downtown St. Louis, Missouri, and was known as &quot;NPRC-CPR&quot;. The facility later shifted locations to Boulder Boulevard in Valmeyer, Illinois and became known as the &quot;NPRC Annex&quot;.

==National Archives at St. Louis==

Housed in the same building as the Military Personnel Records Center (MPRC) is the National Archives at St. Louis which is a regional archives considered part of National Archives research services and separate from the majority of correspondence work handled by the main part of MPRC.

The National Archives at St. Louis is the legal custodian of archived military and civilian personnel records and related personnel data series records. These files are considered open to the public and separate from the military personnel files which are considered protected under the Privacy Act of 1974. Archival records at St. Louis include:

* U.S. Army patient rosters of certain military hospitals
* Selective Service System records from 1940 - 1976
* Army pay cards
* Philippine Army record material
* Navy casualty files, also known as &quot;Individual Deceased Personnel Files&quot; or IDPFs
* Copies of officer order copies
* Military burial files and headstone applications
* German Civilian Personnel files from World War II

===Preservation St. Louis Office===

The National Archives at St. Louis maintains an on-site preservation office for the upkeep of locally maintained records, specifically those records which were damaged by the 1973 National Archives fire. The St. Louis facilities maintain several conservation and preservation labs which deal with fire damaged records as well as records affected by age and mold.

==Tenant agencies==

The National Personnel Records Center presently hosts fourteen tenant agencies of the United States federal government. These include the Department of Veterans Affairs and the FBI, as well as liaison offices with all of the U.S. armed forces with the exception of the United States Coast Guard.

==Directors==

The director of the National Personnel Records Center is usually a senior federal civil service employee, rated as a GS-14/15 or as a member of the Senior Executive Service. Office of Personnel Management archives list the directorship of NPRC as established in 1966; prior to this time, the two separate records centers for civilian and military personnel records were considered as separate director positions under the General Services Administration. The term &quot;National Personnel Records Center Director&quot; only came into being when the two buildings were administratively (but not physically) merged in 1966.

National Personnel Records Center Directors

* Joseph Wertzberger: 1966–1973
* Warren Griffin: 1973–1979
* J. D. Kilgore: 1979–1982
* David Petree: 1982–2000
* Ronald Hindman: 2000–2011
* Scott Levins: 2012–Present

<doc id="702384" wikidata="Q1612589" url="?curid=702384" title="Communications Technology Satellite">
<text>The Communications Technology Satellite (CTS), known as Hermes, was an experimental high-power direct broadcast communications satellite. It was a joint effort of Canadian Department of Communications, who designed and built the satellite, NASA who tested, launched and operated the satellite, and European Space Agency (ESA) who provided the 1200 watts solar panels and other devices. The three agencies shared the satellite and the data from the experiments.

Although the launch of the ATS-6 spacecraft in 1974 marked the end of NASA&#x27;s program of experimental communications satellites. NASA participated in a Canadian satellite venture known initially as &quot;Cooperative Applications Satellite-C&quot; and renamed Hermes. This joint effort involved NASA and the Canadian Department of Communications. NASA&#x27;s Lewis Research Center provided the satellite&#x27;s high-power communications payload. Canada designed and built the spacecraft; NASA tested, launched, and operated it. Also, the European Space Agency provided one of the low-power traveling-wave tubes and other equipment. Hermes was launched 17 January 1976 and operated until October 1979.

== Launch ==
It was launched on 17 January 1976, from Cape Canaveral in Florida by a Delta 2914 rocket. Designed for a two-year mission it was the basis of experiments past its intended lifetime until October 1979 when a system failure broke all contacts with it. Unlike most communications satellites of the period, which had spin-stabilized bodies covered with solar cells, the Hermes CTS was three-axis stabilized and had its solar panels spread out on two huge &quot;wings&quot;.

== Satellite ==
The satellite was meant to test the practical aspects of a high powered satellite using large antennas beaming television signals directly to homes equipped with small antennas, and two-way communications with mobile stations. When it was launched it was the most powerful communications satellite in existence.

This three-axis stabilized satellite was designed as a test vehicle to carry communications-related equipment. The purpose of its launch into an equatorial, Earth-synchronous orbit was:
* to demonstrate new technology,
* to conduct communications technological experiments,
* to develop new communications methodology in conjunction with ground-based components.

The spacecraft was a short (1.17-m) right cylinder (1.8-m diameter) with two parallel (1.72-m apart) plane surfaces symmetrically truncating the curved surface. These plane surfaces were also parallel to the cylinder axis. Relatively long, narrow (1.3- by 6.5-m) solar arrays were extendable from mechanisms mounted on the parallel plane sides.

== Communications Experiments ==
* Super high frequency (12 and 14 GHz) - Transmitter Experiment Package (TEP): this communications experiment consisted of a 20-W low-power super high frequency (SHF) communications transponder, a 200-W high-power SHF transmitter package, an SHF beacon, and antenna subsystems. The purpose of this experiment was: 1) to evaluate technical performance of the components and 2) to evaluate overall technical operation of the system. Both types of tests were done over a 2-year period. Reference was sometimes made to the two different types of evaluation as two different experiments. Evaluation of the overall operation was then referred to as a &quot;communication system&quot; experiment.
* Solar Array Technology Experiment (SATE): this experiment was to study the mechanical, dynamic, and electrical properties of a new type of extendable solar array over an extended time period. The two 1.3- x 6.5-m arrays were unfolded from their packs by unfurling a supporting tube that was attached to the extremity of the array.
* Attitude Control System Experiment: this was a technology experiment to evaluate the dynamics of spacecraft mechanical flexibility on ACS (attitude control system) operation and to demonstrate that attitude control flight performance was in accordance with stability and control theory.
* Canadian Communications Experiments: this experiment involved investigation of practical techniques for use of the satellite communications systems being tested. It included communication techniques for use in medicine, education, community development and interaction, and data transmission. It also included development of compatible ground facilities. About 30 different experiments by over 20 different organizations have been approved by a joint working group, which approved and coordinated Canadian and American experiments for this satellite equipment.
* United States User Experiments: this experiment involved explanation of future possible uses of high-powered communications satellites. Experimentation by 13 different experimenters involved medicine, education, community services, special services, and communications technology.

The CTS satellite also made history as being the first communications satellite used for video art, by artist Keith Sonnier in 1977 for his 2-part piece titled &quot;Send/Receive Satellite Network&quot;, in which video and character generator text and graphics were fed over the satellite between the East and West Coasts of the United States. This marked the first time that satellite communication technology was used for video art. NASA cooperated with Sonnier&#x27;s project and provided a satellite uplink truck for access to the CTS satellite. The piece was produced in two parts, &quot;Phase I&quot;, which was a critique of satellite technology and whether it would become accessible to the public rather than the commercial and military purposes for the technology at that time, using feeds sent over the satellite by the artist and other participants, and &quot;Phase II&quot;, which featured excerpts of the feeds sent.

Several communities in the Canadian wilderness participated in a series of realistic tests of its capacities. Experiments in telemedicine for Emergency medical services, teleconferencing and community TV were conducted. The satellite was also used in May 1978 to televise Stanley Cup hockey playoffs to Canadian diplomats in Peru to demonstrate its international capacity. This was the first direct-to-home satellite television broadcast in the world. It covered about 40% of the Earth&#x27;s surface, from its geostationary orbit. In Canada alone, 37 tests were done using a family of 27 ground terminals. The experiments led to the creation of the hybrid Anik B satellite which was both a standard Anik model and a platform for pilot projects of direct broadcast TV.

In 1987, Canada&#x27;s Department of Communications and NASA received an Emmy Award for developing direct broadcast TV satellite technology with the Hermes CTS program.

<doc id="702389" wikidata="Q7467957" url="?curid=702389" title="Panathinaikos A.O.">
<text>Panathinaikos Athlitikos Omilos (, literally in English: &quot;Panathenaic Athletic Club&quot; or Panathinaikos A.C.), also known simply as Panathinaikós , is a major Greek multi-sport club based in the City of Athens. Panathinaikos is one of the most successful multi-sport clubs and one of the oldest clubs in Greece. The name &quot;Panathinaikos&quot; (which can literally be translated as &quot;Panathenaic&quot;, which means &quot;of all Athens&quot;) was inspired by the ancient work of Isocrates &quot;Panathenaicus&quot;, where the orator praise the Athenians for their democratic education and their military superiority, which use it for benefit of all Greeks.

It was founded by Giorgos Kalafatis in 1908 as a football club, when he and 40 other athletes decided to break away from Panellinios Gymnastikos Syllogos following the club&#x27;s decision to discontinue its football team. It is amongst the most popular clubs in the country and one of the biggest worldwide, based on the number of its sports departments. It is the club that introduced in Greece a number of sports, as it was the first, or amongst the first teams, in football, basketball, volleyball, field hockey, table tennis and handball, while they were also pioneer in the creation of women&#x27;s teams in basketball and football.

Panathinaikos&#x27; teams and individual athletes have won numerous titles and have made notable participations in domestic and international competitions. The basketball team of the club is the most successful in Greece and one of the most successful in Europe, with seven European championships, one Intercontinental Cup and two Triple Crowns. The football team of Panathinaikos is the only Greek team that has reached the UEFA Champions League final (in 1971) and also the semi-finals twice (in 1985 and 1996). It is also the only Greek football team that has played for the Intercontinental Cup. The teams of Panathinaikos have played overall in 18 European and international finals (in football, basketball, men&#x27;s volleyball, women&#x27;s volleyball, men&#x27;s table tennis and women&#x27;s table tennis).

In the individual sports, Panathinaikos has a remarkable tradition in the athletics, cycling, shooting, fencing and boxing departments. It has produced numerous athletes; World champions and European champions, winners at the Olympic, Mediterranean and Balkan Games.

== History ==

=== 1908–1945 ===

====&quot;Football Club of Athens&quot;====
Football made its appearance in Greece at the end of the 19th century. In 1908, a young athlete of Panellinios, Giorgos Kalafatis, dismayed by his club&#x27;s decision to discontinue its football team, left with 40 other athletes and founded &quot;Podosferikos Omilos Athinon&quot; (&quot;Football Club of Athens&quot;). Konstantinos Tsiklitiras, the great Greek athlete of the early 20th century, played as goalkeeper for the new team.

====&quot;Panathenaic Athletic Club&quot;====
The team of Kalafatis was renamed to Panellinios Podosferikos Omilos (PPO) – i.e. &quot;Panhellenic Football Club&quot; – in 1911. In 1918, it was decided that the official crest of the club would be the trifolium, symbol of unity, harmony, nature, and good luck, an idea of player Michalis Papazoglou. The officials of the club were looking for a universal, non-nationalistic or localistic symbol, aiming to represent the whole Athens at the country and further at the world.

Papazoglou was also the main instigator of the &quot;Panathenaic Idea&quot;, the idea for the creation of a new club -for the Greek standards- which will participate in as more sports as possible (something that would by adopted later by all the major Greek clubs). With the help of the others of the leading four of the club (Kalafatis, Panourgias and Nikolaidis), this came true. In 1919, Kalafatis was a member of the Greece national football team that participated in the Inter-Allied Games in Paris. There, he collected informations also about basketball and volleyball (sports unknown then in Greece) and after his return to Athens, started his efforts on creating new teams for the club.

In 1924, the club took its final and current name &quot;Panathinaikos Athlitikos Omilos (PAO)&quot; (&quot;Panathenaic Athletic Club&quot;), from now on a multi-sports club. During the next decades, with main contributor Apostolos Nikolaidis (considered &quot;Patriarch&quot; of the club), Panathinaikos not only will create teams almost in every sport, but they will be consecutive champions for many years in most of them.


The athletics department was founded in 1919. In the same year, Panathinaikos was one of the first clubs in Greece to form a volleyball team. The first dynamic presence of the team is dated back in the years 1927–1929 with many popular players of the time such as the historical member of the board Apostolos Nikolaidis as well as Athanasios Aravositas, Goumas, Arg. Nikolaidis, Papageorgiou and Papastefanou.

In 1922, the basketball department was founded, also one of the first in Greece, and it has since developed into the most successful basketball team in the country and one of the most successful in Europe. In 1924, the table tennis department was founded, in 1926 the tennis department and in 1928 the cycling, shooting and field hockey departments. The swimming, water polo and handball departments were created in 1930.

In the 1928 Summer Olympics, for the first time, the parade of nations started with Greece. The athlete of Panathinaikos Antonis Kariofillis became the first Greek who started the parade.

Panathinaikos won the football championship in 1930 under the guidance of József Künsztler with Angelos Messaris as the team&#x27;s star player. Other notable players of the era were Antonis Migiakis, Diomidis Symeonidis and Mimis Pierrakos. They beat rivals Olympiacos 8–2, a result that still remains the biggest win either team has achieved against its rival. In 1937 the women&#x27;s basketball team was created, being the first in the country.

During World War II and the dark years of the Axis occupation of Greece, the athletes of Panathinaikos played a significant role. The football player Mimis Pierrakos was killed during the Greco-Italian war, while Michalis Papazoglou with Dimitris Giannatos (founding member of the basketball team) later participated in the resistance group of Jerzy Iwanow-Szajnowicz, an athlete of Polish origin of Iraklis Thessaloniki and secret agent of the British, and succeeded in destroying three German airplanes and sinking three small warships. They were arrested, tortured and finally Giannatos and Ivanof were executed.

=== 1946–1990 ===

After the war, the boxing department was re-founded in 1946, the diving department was created in 1947, the weightlifting department in 1959, the chess department in 1960, the fencing department was re-founded in 1960, the gymnastics department in 1962, the waterskiing department in 1963 and a wrestling department in 1965.

Panathinaikos&#x27; hardcore fans are called Gate 13 and are the oldest union of supporters in Greece. Gate 13 was founded in 1966. Furthermore, in the 1966 European Athletics Championships, the pole vaulter of the club and 13 times Greek champion, Christos Papanikolaou, won the silver medal.

The volleyball club has demonstrated many titles and honours due to the fact that the team roster has always included some of the top volleyball players in Greece. The first generation was that of the 1960s with Andreas and Nikos Bergeles as well as Iliopoulos, Leloudas, Chasapis, Emmanouel, Perros and Fotiou who opened the road for the next generations.

In 1970, Christos Papanikolaou jumped to capture the world record. It was the first pole vault over .

Panathinaikos soon dominated Greek football along with rivals Olympiacos and AEK and, although they are second in domestic titles, they have done better than any other Greek club in the European competitions. In 1971, Panathinaikos became the first and only Greek team – so far – to have reached the final of a European competition, when they faced Ajax in Wembley Stadium for the European Cup, losing 2–0. In the late 1970s, when football became professional in Greece, the club&#x27;s football department passed to the hands of the Vardinogiannis family. In the following 30 years the team won the Greek championship 7 times, while in Europe the team reached also the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League two more times, in 1985 and 1996.

In 1974, the table tennis team reached the semi-finals of the ETTU Cup. In 1978, the modern pentathlon department was founded and in 1980, the judo department. An important achievement for the volleyball team was the participation in the final of the CEV Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1980. During the following years, Panathinaikos continued to perform well in Greek volleyball with players such as Kazazis, Tentzeris, Gontikas (later president of Panathinaikos F.C.), Galakos, Dimitriadis and Margaronis.

The archery department was founded in 1981 and a futsal department in 1990.

=== 1991–2000 ===

Another successful period for the volleyball team was the seasons 1994–95 and 1995–96 when Panathinaikos won two Greek Championships in a row with Stelios Prosalikas as head coach and Andreopoulos, Triantafyllidis, Filippov, Spanos, Chatziantoniou, Ouzounov, A. Kovatsev, S. Kovatsev, Karamaroudis and Tonev as players.

The men&#x27;s basketball department became professional in 1992 and since then is owned by two pharmaceutical magnates, the brothers Pavlos and Thanassis Giannakopoulos. In 1996 in Paris final-four (F4), Panathinaikos was the first Greek team to win a European Champions&#x27; Cup (now called Euroleague), beating Barcelona in a unique final, by 67–66. In September of the same year the team also won the Intercontinental Cup, prevailing by 2–1 wins over Olimpia of Argentina (83–89, 83–78, 101–76). In the same year, the football team reached the UEFA Champions League semi-finals.

In 2000, in the F4 of Thessaloniki, Panathinaikos were the Champions of Europe for the second time, beating Maccabi 73–67 in the final. In 2002 in Bologna, they conquered the most prestigious European trophy for the third time, beating hosts Kinder Bologna 89–83. Also, in 2000, the women&#x27;s volleyball team reached the CEV Cup final.

=== 2001–present ===

In 2007 in Athens F4, Panathinaikos BC were crowned European Champions for the fourth time, beating CSKA Moscow 93–91. In 2009 in Berlin, the &quot;greens&quot; defeated again CSKA 73–71 to become the Champions of Europe for the fifth time.

In 2009, the men&#x27;s volleyball team reached the CEV Cup final, while the women&#x27;s volleyball team reached the Challenge Cup final.

The sixth Euroleague triumph for Panathinaikos BC came in Barcelona in 2011, after defeating Maccabi 78–70 in the final. Panathinaikos BC became so, the second most successful club (behind Real Madrid) in the history of the competition.

In 2013, a new sports department was founded for the first time after many years. It is the rugby team, which was announced on 7 November 2013, while the re-foundation of the field hockey department and the creation also of a baseball team was announced in 2014.

On 29 December 2016, following the current trend of sports clubs getting involved in electronic sports, the club announces the establishment of an eSports section.

In December 2018, Panathinaikos proceeded to the foundation of Wheelchair Basketball department.

== Crest ==
In 1918, Michalis Papazoglou proposed the trifolium as emblem of Panathinaikos, symbol of harmony, unity, nature, and good luck. Georgios Chatzopoulos, member of the club (later President) and director of the National Gallery, took over to design the emblem for the club. Up to the end of the 1970s, a trifolium (green or white) was sewed on the heart&#x27;s side on the jersey of the club΄s teams.

With the beginning of professionalism in the Greek football, the crest of the FC was created, accompanied by the club initials and the year of founding (1908). The basketball team uses also since 1992 its own logo.

In 2014, the direction of the club introduced a separate crest for the whole club and all the amateur departments.

<doc id="702398" wikidata="Q1060823" url="?curid=702398" title="Trademark dilution">
<text>Trademark dilution is a trademark law concept giving the owner of a famous trademark standing to forbid others from using that mark in a way that would lessen its uniqueness. In most cases, trademark dilution involves an unauthorized use of another&#x27;s trademark on products that do not compete with, and have little connection with, those of the trademark owner. For example, a famous trademark used by one company to refer to hair care products might be &quot;diluted&quot; if another company began using a similar mark to refer to breakfast cereals or spark plugs.

Dilution is a basis of trademark infringement that applies only to famous marks. With a non-famous mark, the owner of the mark must show that the allegedly infringing use creates a likelihood of confusion as to the source of the product or service being identified by the allegedly infringing use: it is highly unlikely a likelihood of confusion will be found if the products or services are in unrelated markets. With a famous mark, any other use has the potential for confusion, since consumers may assume affiliation with the owner of the mark regardless of the product or service.

==Background==
Trademark law traditionally concerned itself with situations where an unauthorized party sold goods that are directly competitive with or at least related to those sold by the trademark owner. A trademark is diluted when the use of similar or identical trademarks in other non-competing markets means that the trademark in and of itself will lose its capacity to signify a single source. In other words, unlike ordinary trademark law, dilution protection extends to trademark uses that do not confuse consumers regarding who has made a product. Instead, dilution protection law aims to protect sufficiently strong trademarks from losing their singular association in the public mind with a particular product, perhaps imagined if the trademark were to be encountered independently of any product (e.g., just the word Pepsi spoken, or on a billboard).

==Requirements for protection==
The strength required for a trademark to deserve dilution protection differs among jurisdictions, though it generally includes the requirement that it must be distinctive, famous, or even unique. Such trademarks would include instantly recognizable brand names, such as Coca-Cola, Kleenex, Kool-Aid, or Sony, and unique terms that were invented (such as Exxon) rather than surnames (such as Ford or Zamboni) or ordinary words in language. Some jurisdictions require additional registration of these trademarks as defensive marks in order to qualify for dilution protection.

Another way of describing the necessary strength of a trademark may establish some basis for dilution protection from a consumer-confusion standpoint. Truly famous trademarks are likely to be seen in many different contexts due to branching out or simple sponsorship, to the extent that there may be very few markets, if any, that a consumer would be surprised to see that famous trademark involved in. A prime example may be the past involvement of Coca-Cola in clothing lines.

One further use of the protection of trademark dilution is for controversial images, including the Cleveland Guardians&#x27; former mascot and logo, Chief Wahoo, while the team was known as the Cleveland Indians at the time along with the Washington Commanders, formerly known as the Redskins. In those cases, a limited selection of merchandise is distributed solely in their physical team stores of their former controversial Native American logos, both to maintain the trademarks and prevent others from usurping them, and to null the further use of those logos in public.

==Blurring and tarnishment==
Dilution is sometimes divided into two related concepts: blurring, or essentially basic dilution, which &quot;blurs&quot; a mark from association with only one product to signify other products in other markets (such as &quot;Kodak shoes&quot;); and tarnishment, which is the weakening of a mark through unsavory or unflattering associations. Not all dilution protection laws recognize tarnishment as an included concept.

==Laws by country==

===Canada ===

In Canada, the legal basis can be found in s. 22 of the &quot;Trade-marks Act&quot;:
 
It is commonly acknowledged that goodwill is constituted by the reputation of a trade mark and its persuasive effect.

==== Application of Section 22 by Canadian Courts ====

In the &quot;Clairol&quot; case, the court stated that goodwill can be depreciated through &quot;reduction of the esteem in which the mark itself is held or through the direct persuasion and enticing of customers who could otherwise be expected to buy or continue to buy goods bearing the trade mark&quot;. The court added that the test of confusion is irrelevant here and that the &quot;test is the likelihood of depreciating the value of the goodwill attaching to the trade mark&quot; and that this result could be obtained without actual deception/confusion.

S. 22 thus steps where confusion fails to tread. Even if there is no actual risk that the consumer might be confused between the two products, the trade mark owner will still be able to prevent another person from using his/her trade mark if that use is likely to depreciate the value of the trade mark.

In the &quot;Veuve Clicquot&quot; case, the trade mark of the famous French champagne was used by a small chain of women&#x27;s clothing store that was trading in eastern Quebec and Ottawa. According to the court, s. 22 applies even where a defendant&#x27;s wares or services do not compete with the plaintiff&#x27;s and their mark are not identical. The marks were not identical (&quot;Cliquot&quot; and &quot;Veuve clicquot&quot;) and the risk of confusing the champagne brand and a clothing store was low. However the court ruled that the only element needed was the ability of an average consumer to recognize the first distinctive character. Even if the trade mark is not that well known, the fact that a significant goodwill is attached to it might be enough for the court to find the use by another person unlawful. However, in that particular case, the court claimed that the plaintiff Veuve Clicquot failed to prove that the linkage between champagne and clothing was likely to cause depreciation.

In the &quot;Perrier&quot; case, the plaintiff, a French company, was the bottler and distributor of spring water. It sought an injunction to restrain another company base in Ontario from advertising and distributing bottled water in association with the name &quot;Pierre eh!&quot; claiming that the value of the goodwill attached to the French trade mark would likely be depreciated. The plaintiff succeeded on section 22 to stop the use of &quot;Pierre Eh!&quot; on bottled water.

==== Proving depreciation of goodwill====

The plaintiff has to prove the elements of section 22, particularly that the use would likely depreciate the value of the goodwill of the claimant&#x27;s mark. A precision has been made by Vaver, that the fact &quot;that the use could well cause depreciation is not enough. The use must actually have caused depreciation&quot;.

==== Limits to the use of Section 22 ====

The use of Section 22 was restricted in the Clairol case to the use &quot;in the technical trade-mark sense&quot;. For example, unions are allowed to use the trade mark to caricature because caricature or criticism is not a trade mark infringement, nor event a use of the trade mark, if it occurs outside &quot;the normal course of trade&quot;. (see also The Michelin v CAW case. In that case, the court rejected the trade mark infringement argument because no one was planning on using the trade mark to sell a product).

===United States===
Prior to specifically targeted laws being adopted, dilution protection was used in some U.S. jurisdictions to attack domain name infringement of trademarks (see Cybersquatting). For example, in the 1998 case of &quot;Panavision International v. Toeppen&quot;, defendant Dennis Toeppen registered the domain name www.panavision.com, and posted aerial views of the city of Pana, Illinois, on the site. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that trademark dilution occurred when potential customers of Panavision could not find its web site at panavision.com, and instead were forced to search through other (less obvious) domain names. The fact that potential customers might be discouraged from locating Panavision&#x27;s legitimate website, coupled with evidence that Toeppen was in the business of registering domain names for profit, led the court to find that Toeppen&#x27;s conduct &quot;diminished the capacity of the Panavision marks to identify and distinguish Panavision&#x27;s goods and services on the Internet&quot;, and thus constituted dilution.

Lately, the Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006 (H.R. 683), was signed into law, which overturned &quot;Moseley v. V Secret Catalogue, Inc.&quot;, . &quot;Moseley&quot; held the plaintiff needed to prove &quot;actual&quot; dilution under the Federal Trademark Dilution Act (&quot;FTDA&quot;). The new law revises the FTDA, requiring the plaintiff to show only that the defendant&#x27;s mark is &quot;likely&quot; to cause dilution. However, the revision also reduced the universe of marks falling under its protection, requiring that marks be nationally well known to qualify for protection from dilution.

For example, when Wolfe&#x27;s Borough Coffee, Inc., a New Hampshire-based coffee company, sold its coffee under the trademarks that included the words &quot;Charbucks Blend&quot; and &quot;Mr. Charbucks,&quot; Starbucks Corporation sued, claiming that the use of the word &quot;Charbucks&quot; diluted the &quot;Starbucks&quot; mark by both blurring and tarnishment. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals decided that marks need not be &quot;substantially similar&quot; under the FTDA for dilution to occur when other factors supporting a finding of dilution, such as the distinctiveness of the famous mark and the degree of its recognition, were present. In its decision, the court found that these other factors may be sufficient to support a dilution claim and remanded the case to the district court in order to determine whether dilution had in fact occurred. The district court ruled that sales of Charbucks did not violate the trademark and could continue.
