<text>The Koyukuk River (; &quot;Ooghekuhno&#x27; &quot; in Koyukon, &quot;Kuuyukaq&quot; or &quot;Tagraġvik&quot; in Iñupiaq) is a tributary of the Yukon River, in the U.S. state of Alaska. It is the last major tributary entering the Yukon before the larger river empties into the Bering Sea.

Rising at the confluence of the North Fork Koyukuk River with the Middle Fork Koyukuk River, it flows generally southwest to meet the larger Yukon River at Koyukuk. The river, with headwaters above the Arctic Circle in the Endicott Mountains of the Brooks Range, drains an area north of the Yukon River that includes part of the Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve, as well as Kanuti National Wildlife Refuge and Koyukuk National Wildlife Refuge.

The main stem of the river is lined by the communities of Evansville, Bettles, Alatna, Allakaket, Hughes, and Huslia before reaching Koyukuk. Its headwaters tributaries include the Koyukuk&#x27;s south, middle, and north forks, the Alatna River, and the John River. Major tributaries further downstream include the Kanuti, Batzu, Hogatza, Huslia, Dulbi, Kateel, and Gisasa rivers. Of these, the Alatna, John, and North Fork are National Wild and Scenic Rivers, as is the Tinayguk River, a tributary of the North Fork.

==Name==
&quot;Koyukuk&quot; was derived from the Central Yup&#x27;ik phrase &quot;kuik-yuk,&quot; meaning &quot;a river.&quot; The Koyukuk River was given this generic C. Yup&#x27;ik name by Russian explorer Petr Vasilii Malakhov, because he did not know the local Koyukon name for it (i.e., &quot;Ooghekuhno&quot;). The Western Union Telegraph Expedition used the spelling of &quot;Coyukuk&quot; before the United States Board on Geographic Names settled on &quot;Koyukuk.&quot;

== History ==
The Russian Petr Vasilii Malakhov reached the river at its confluence with the Yukon in 1838. The United States acquired Alaska after the American Civil War, but it was 1885 before US representatives Lieutenant Henry Allen and Private Fred Fickett of the United States Army ascended and explored the river. The discovery of gold deposits by Johnnie Folger on the Middle Fork in 1893 on The Tramway bar led to a gold rush in 1898; trading posts and mining camps, including Bettles, were rapidly developed on the upper river.

In 1929, Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Marshall explored the North Fork of the Koyukuk River, and identified what he called the Gates of the Arctic.

In 1980 the United States Congress designated 100 mi (164 km) of the North Fork of the Koyukuk River in the Brooks Range as the &quot;Koyukuk Wild and Scenic River,&quot; which authorized certain levels of protection for the habitat.

In 1994 the river flooded, sweeping away three villages, forcing the wholesale relocation of the population.

==Flora and fauna==
Vegetation along the Koyukuk River, sparse along the upper reaches, consists of tundra plants such as dwarf willows and other shrubs, sedges, and lichens. Further downstream at lower elevations, taiga and boreal forest plants are common except in the Koyukuk Flats near the mouth, where sedges and other herbaceous plants dominate the poorly drained muskeg. Trees found in more well-drained areas along the river include mountain alder, trembling aspen, white, and black spruce.

Fish species frequenting the lower Koyukuk include Arctic lamprey and sockeye salmon. The sockeye and other salmon species, including Chinook and chum, also thrive along the upper reaches and tributaries.
Caribou migrate across the upper part of the Koyukuk watershed. Other major vertebrates in the region include bald eagles, brown and black bears, mink, beaver, marten, and river otter. Beluga whales sometimes visit the lower Koyukuk.

Moose herds, which thrive in parts of the watershed, especially in riparian zones downstream of Hughes, attract local and non-local hunters, bears, and wolves. A consortium of moose hunters and state wildlife officials work to keep the moose population at sustainable levels.

Through 2005, no one had published a study of invertebrates of the Koyukuk or its larger tributaries. General information included in a study related to pipeline construction through the watershed suggested the presence of a variety of true flies, midges, black flies, mayflies, stoneflies, and caddisflies.

<text>The is a subway line in Tokyo, Japan, owned and operated by Tokyo Metro.

==Overview==
The line serves the wards of Shibuya, Minato, Chiyoda, Chūō, Kōtō, and Sumida. Despite being shorter in length than nearly all other Tokyo subway lines, the Hanzōmon Line operates some of the longest through services with private railways – namely Tōkyū Corporation and Tobu Railway. The line is connected to Tōkyū Den-en-toshi Line at Shibuya Station to the south, and to the Tobu Skytree Line at to the north. Through trains operate between on the Tōkyū Den-en-toshi Line and on the Tobu Skytree Line, onward to on the Tobu Isesaki Line and on the Tobu Nikko Line. Through-service trains between Chūō-Rinkan and Minami-Kurihashi cover a total distance of in a single run – nearly six times the length of the Hanzōmon Line alone.

The Hanzōmon Line has direct interchanges with all other Tokyo Metro and Toei lines. It connects with the Tokyo Metro Ginza Line at five stations (the four stations between Shibuya and Nagatachō, as well as at Mitsukoshimae Station.

The line is named after the west gate of the Imperial Palace (&quot;Hanzōmon&quot;), which in turn is named after 16th century samurai Hattori Hanzō, who was important to the founding of the shogunate which built the palace. The Hanzōmon Line&#x27;s color on maps and station guides is purple, and stations carry the letter &quot;Z&quot; followed by a two-digit number.

According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation, as of June 2009 the Hanzōmon Line is the sixth most crowded subway line in Tokyo, at its peak running at 173% capacity between Shibuya and Omotesandō stations.

==History==
The Hanzōmon Line was first planned in 1968, along with the Chiyoda Line and Yūrakuchō Line, as a reliever line for the heavily congested Ginza Line. Its initial routing was from Futako-Tamagawa Station on the Tōkyū Den-en-toshi Line to a new station in the Fukagawa district of Kōtō. In 1985, a second draft plan from the Ministry of Transportation moved the Hanzōmon Line&#x27;s final terminus to Matsudo. During the planning stage, it was known as Line 11.

Construction began in 1972 and the majority of the line was expected to open in 1975. However, the Teito Rapid Transit Authority did not have enough funds to build the line, which delayed its construction. On August 1, 1978, the first section of the Hanzōmon Line finally opened from Shibuya to Aoyama-itchōme, including through services with the Den-en-toshi Line. It was then extended to Nagatachō Station in September 1979. The line was initially operated mainly using Tokyu rolling stock, as the first TRTA 8000 series train did not enter service until 1981.

However, the next extension posed political problems, as the original plan had the line run directly under the Imperial Palace to Ōtemachi Station. TRTA decided to divert the route around the north side of the Imperial Palace, which required the construction of three new stations. An eminent domain battle erupted with landowners along the proposed route, which delayed the completion of the next stage of the line. Hanzomon Station opened in December 1982, and the full extension around the Imperial Palace, terminating at Mitsukoshi-mae, was not completed until January 1989. The line was then extended to Suitengu-mae in November 1990 and finally Oshiage in March 2003, the latter also enabling through service with the Tobu Skytree Line.

The line, station facilities, rolling stock, and related assets were inherited by Tokyo Metro after the privatization of the Teito Rapid Transit Authority (TRTA) in 2004.

The Ministry of Transportation recommended in 2000 that the line be extended to its intended terminus in Matsudo by 2015. However, Tokyo Metro stated in its initial public offering that its construction operations would cease once the Fukutoshin Line is completed, which cast some doubt as to whether the Matsudo extension will actually be built.

<doc id="718108" wikidata="Q347967" url="?curid=718108" title="Gerontophilia">
<text>Gerontophilia or is the primary sexual attraction to older people. A person with such a sexual preference is a gerontophile or gerontosexual.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;gerontophilia&quot; was coined in 1901 by psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing. It derives from Greek: &quot;geron&quot;, meaning &quot;old person&quot; and &quot;philia&quot;, meaning &quot;friendship&quot;. Gerontophilia is classified as a paraphilia, but is not mentioned in the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; or International Classification of Diseases.

== History ==
The prevalence of gerontophilia is unknown. A study of pornographic search terms on a peer-to-peer network reported that 0.15% had gerontophilic themes. Sex offenders with elderly victims do not necessarily have gerontophilia. There are other possible motivations for these offenses, such as rage or sadism, or the increased vulnerability of elderly as a social group, which are factors that may not involve a sexual preference for the elderly. There are no studies showing that most such offenders are gerontophiles. In one small study, two of six sex offenders against the elderly showed gerontophilic tendencies. Gerontophilia can also be expressed with consenting elderly partners in a legal context.

Research on gerontophilia is limited to a small number of case studies, beginning with a paper by French physician Charles Féré in 1905. Féré described a 27-year-old man who rejected an arranged marriage with a 20-year-old &quot;beauty&quot; in favor of a 62-year-old woman. Such studies commonly report that the subject had an early sexual experience with a much older woman.

A figurative gerontophilia was a characteristic of Algernon Charles Swinburne&#x27;s passion for antiquated poets.

<doc id="718110" wikidata="Q3108101" url="?curid=718110" title="Tropical garden">
<text>A tropical garden is a type of garden that features tropical plants and requires heavy rainfall or a decent irrigation or sprinkler system for watering. These gardens typically need fertilizer and heavy mulching.

Tropical gardens are no longer exclusive to tropical areas. Many gardeners in cooler climates are adopting the tropical garden design, which is possible through careful choice of plants and flowers. Main features include plants with very large leaves, vegetation that builds in height towards the back of the garden, creating a dense garden. Large plants and small trees hang over the garden, leaving sunlight to hit the ground directly.

==Tropical plants==
The following are some examples of tropical plants to be used in tropical gardens or as indoor plants.

===Hoyas===
Hoyas are known as the “Wax Flowers” due to their and almost unreal appearance. They need relatively warm and humid conditions, but depending on the specific variety of Hoya, they can endure heavy rainfall for some months during the wet seasons just as they may also be exposed to long dry periods. They are commonly used indoors. They need indirect light, but the amount or required light depends on the variety. They need small amounts of water and the soil is to be kept slightly dry since a very wet soil can end up killing this kind of plant. They can be grown in pots that are not too big or in hanging baskets. They grow better if kept at a minimum temperature of 15 degree Celsius (59 Fahrenheit).

===Banana plants===
Contrary to common belief, growing banana trees is not that difficult and allow people to enjoy their own bananas. Also these plants can be used as windbreaks. They need fertile soils, large mulch and organic matter, large amounts of nitrogen and potassium, warm temperature, high humidity, large amounts of water, and from other banana plants. Banana plants are not to be exposed to strong winds and extreme weather conditions (too hot or too cold weather) with an ideal temperature being 26-30 degree Celsius (78-86 Fahrenheit). They stop growing below 14 degree Celsius (57 Fahrenheit). Banana rhizomes are planted upright and their roots have to be well covered with soil.

===Bird of paradise===
Among the many species commonly called birds of paradise is &quot;Strelitzia reginae&quot;, a plant indigenous to South Africa and South America. As a tropical plant, it grows in warm, humid climates. This exotic, colorful plant with evergreen leaves resembles a bird&#x27;s beak. It is an outdoor plant, provided the weather is not too cold. Otherwise, it is better to keep it in a pot indoors. It needs rich soil as well as full sun or partial shade. Another requirement for this plant is good drainage.

===Ferns===
Ferns are commonly used to give gardens a great foliage. Most ferns are easy to take care of. They basically cannot be exposed to direct sunlight for long periods of time. Moreover, their soil should always be moist. One way to keep ferns moist is by misting them.

===Papaya tree===
Papaya trees should be planted where they can be kept warm and free from wind and freeze. They need enough water to support their leaves, but it should not be excessive, which can lead to root rot. They also need a well-drained soil.

===Orchids===
Night temperatures between 12 and 18 degrees Celsius (55-65 Fahrenheit), and day temperatures between 23 and 26 degree Celsius (75-80 Fahrenheit) are fine temperatures for orchids. Orchids need sufficient amounts of light as well as humidity. However, there are many varieties of orchids and each of them features specific care needs.

==Maintenance==
A tropical garden is one of the most difficult types of garden to build and maintain; it becomes more difficult the more the local climate differs from the plants&#x27; natural habitat. The keys to a healthy tropical garden are plentiful light and water. The large leaves that feature in tropical plants require the soil to be humid at all times, so irrigation is essential for some gardens. Over-watering causes the roots to rot, killing plants.

A tropical plant that is not cold-hardy should be brought indoors during the winter and returned to the garden for the summer.

<text>The Apollo command and service module (CSM) was one of two principal components of the United States Apollo spacecraft, used for the Apollo program, which landed astronauts on the Moon between 1969 and 1972. The CSM functioned as a mother ship, which carried a crew of three astronauts and the second Apollo spacecraft, the Apollo Lunar Module, to lunar orbit, and brought the astronauts back to Earth. It consisted of two parts: the conical command module, a cabin that housed the crew and carried equipment needed for atmospheric reentry and splashdown; and the cylindrical service module which provided propulsion, electrical power and storage for various consumables required during a mission. An umbilical connection transferred power and consumables between the two modules. Just before reentry of the command module on the return home, the umbilical connection was severed and the service module was cast off and allowed to burn up in the atmosphere.

The CSM was developed and built for NASA by North American Aviation starting in November 1961. It was initially designed to land on the Moon atop a landing rocket stage and return all three astronauts on a direct-ascent mission, which would not use a separate lunar module, and thus had no provisions for docking with another spacecraft. This, plus other required design changes, led to the decision to design two versions of the CSM: Block I was to be used for uncrewed missions and a single crewed Earth orbit flight (Apollo 1), while the more advanced Block II was designed for use with the lunar module. The Apollo 1 flight was cancelled after a cabin fire killed the crew and destroyed their command module during a launch rehearsal test. Corrections of the problems which caused the fire were applied to the Block II spacecraft, which was used for all crewed spaceflights.

Nineteen CSMs were launched into space. Of these, nine flew humans to the Moon between 1968 and 1972, and another two performed crewed test flights in low Earth orbit, all as part of the Apollo program. Before these, another four CSMs had flown as uncrewed Apollo tests, of which two were suborbital flights and another two were orbital flights. Following the conclusion of the Apollo program and during 1973–1974, three CSMs ferried astronauts to the orbital Skylab space station. Finally in 1975, the last flown CSM docked with the Soviet craft Soyuz 19 as part of the international Apollo–Soyuz Test Project.

== Before Apollo ==
Concepts of an advanced crewed spacecraft started before the Moon landing goal was announced. The three-person vehicle was to be mainly for orbital use around Earth. It would include a large pressurized auxiliary orbital module where the crew would live and work for weeks at a time. They would perform space station-type activities in the module, while later versions would use the module to carry cargo to space stations. The spacecraft was to service the Project Olympus (LORL), a foldable rotating space station launched on a single Saturn V. Later versions would be used on circumlunar flights, and would be the basis for a direct ascent lunar spacecraft as well as used on interplanetary missions. In late 1960, NASA called on U.S. industry to propose designs for the vehicle. On May 25, 1961 President John F. Kennedy announced the Moon landing goal before 1970, which immediately rendered NASA&#x27;s Olympus Station plans obsolete.

==Development history==
When NASA awarded the initial Apollo contract to North American Aviation on November 28, 1961, it was still assumed the lunar landing would be achieved by direct ascent rather than by lunar orbit rendezvous. Therefore, design proceeded without a means of docking the command module to a lunar excursion module (LEM). But the change to lunar orbit rendezvous, plus several technical obstacles encountered in some subsystems (such as environmental control), soon made it clear that substantial redesign would be required. In 1963, NASA decided the most efficient way to keep the program on track was to proceed with the development in two versions:
* Block I would continue the preliminary design, to be used for early low Earth orbit test flights only.
* Block II would be the lunar-capable version, including a docking hatch and incorporating weight reduction and lessons learned in Block I. Detailed design of the docking capability depended on design of the LEM, which was contracted to Grumman Aircraft Engineering.

By January 1964, North American started presenting Block II design details to NASA.
Block I spacecraft were used for all uncrewed Saturn 1B and Saturn V test flights. Initially two crewed flights were planned, but this was reduced to one in late 1966. This mission, designated AS-204 but named Apollo 1 by its flight crew, was planned for launch on February 21, 1967. During a dress rehearsal for the launch on January 27, all three astronauts (Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee) were killed in a cabin fire, which revealed serious design, construction and maintenance shortcomings in Block I, many of which had been carried over into Block II command modules being built at the time.

After a thorough investigation by the Apollo 204 Review Board, it was decided to terminate the crewed Block I phase and redefine Block II to incorporate the review board&#x27;s recommendations. Block II incorporated a revised CM heat shield design, which was tested on the uncrewed Apollo 4 and Apollo 6 flights, so the first all-up Block II spacecraft flew on the first crewed mission, Apollo 7.

The two blocks were essentially similar in overall dimensions, but several design improvements resulted in weight reduction in Block II. Also, the Block I service module propellant tanks were slightly larger than in Block II. The Apollo 1 spacecraft weighed approximately , while the Block II Apollo 7 weighed . (These two Earth orbital craft were lighter than the craft which later went to the Moon, as they carried propellant in only one set of tanks, and did not carry the high-gain S-band antenna.) In the specifications given below, unless otherwise noted, all weights given are for the Block II spacecraft.

The total cost of the CSM for development and the units produced was $36.9 billion in 2016 dollars, adjusted from a nominal total of $3.7 billion using the NASA New Start Inflation Indices.

==Command module (CM)==
The command module was a truncated cone (frustum) with a diameter of across the base, and a height of including the docking probe and dish-shaped aft heat shield. The forward compartment contained two reaction control system thrusters, the docking tunnel, and the Earth Landing System. The inner pressure vessel housed the crew accommodation, equipment bays, controls and displays, and many spacecraft systems. The aft compartment contained 10 reaction control engines and their related propellant tanks, freshwater tanks, and the CSM umbilical cables.

===Construction===
The command module was built in North American&#x27;s factory in Downey, California, and consisted of two basic structures joined together: the inner structure (pressure shell) and the outer structure.

The inner structure was an aluminum sandwich construction consisting of a welded aluminum inner skin, adhesively bonded aluminum honeycomb core, and outer face sheet. The thickness of the honeycomb varied from about at the base to about at the forward access tunnel. This inner structure was the pressurized crew compartment.

The outer structure was made of stainless steel brazed-honeycomb brazed between steel alloy face sheets. It varied in thickness from 0.5 inch to 2.5 inches. Part of the area between the inner and outer shells was filled with a layer of fiberglass insulation as additional heat protection.

====Thermal protection (heat shield)====

An ablative heat shield on the outside of the CM protected the capsule from the heat of reentry, which is sufficient to melt most metals. This heat shield was composed of phenolic formaldehyde resin. During reentry, this material charred and melted away, absorbing and carrying away the intense heat in the process. The heat shield has several outer coverings: a pore seal, a moisture barrier (a white reflective coating), and a silver Mylar thermal coating that looks like aluminum foil.

The heat shield varied in thickness from in the aft portion (the base of the capsule, which faced forward during reentry) to in the crew compartment and forward portions. The total weight of the shield was about .

====Forward compartment====
The -tall forward compartment was the area outside the inner pressure shell in the nose of the capsule, located around the forward docking tunnel and covered by the forward heat shield. The compartment was divided into four 90-degree segments that contained Earth landing equipment (all the parachutes, recovery antennas and beacon light, and sea recovery sling), two reaction control thrusters, and the forward heat shield release mechanism.
At about during reentry, the forward heat shield was jettisoned to expose the Earth landing equipment and permit deployment of the parachutes.

====Aft compartment====
The -tall aft compartment was located around the periphery of the command module at its widest part, just forward of (above) the aft heat shield. The compartment was divided into 24 bays containing 10 reaction control engines; the fuel, oxidizer, and helium tanks for the CM reaction control subsystem; water tanks; the crushable ribs of the impact attenuation system; and a number of instruments. The CM-SM umbilical, the point where wiring and plumbing ran from one module to the other, was also in the aft compartment. The panels of the heat shield covering the aft compartment were removable for maintenance of the equipment before flight.

===Earth landing system===

The components of the ELS were housed around the forward docking tunnel. The forward compartment was separated from the central by a bulkhead and was divided into four 90-degree wedges. The ELS consisted of two drogue parachutes with mortars, three main parachutes, three pilot parachutes to deploy the mains, three inflation bags for uprighting the capsule if necessary, a sea recovery cable, a dye marker, and a swimmer umbilical.

The command module&#x27;s center of mass was offset a foot or so from the center of pressure (along the symmetry axis). This provided a rotational moment during reentry, angling the capsule and providing some lift (a lift to drag ratio of about 0.368). The capsule was then steered by rotating the capsule using thrusters; when no steering was required, the capsule was spun slowly, and the lift effects cancelled out. This system greatly reduced the &quot;g&quot;-force experienced by the astronauts, permitted a reasonable amount of directional control and allowed the capsule&#x27;s splashdown point to be targeted within a few miles.

At , the forward heat shield was jettisoned using four pressurized-gas compression springs. The drogue parachutes were then deployed, slowing the spacecraft to . At the drogues were jettisoned and the pilot parachutes, which pulled out the mains, were deployed. These slowed the CM to for splashdown. The portion of the capsule that first contacted the water surface contained four crushable ribs to further mitigate the force of impact. The command module could safely parachute to an ocean landing with only two parachutes deployed (as occurred on Apollo 15), the third parachute being a safety precaution.

===Reaction control system===
The command module attitude control system consisted of twelve attitude control thrusters, ten of which were located in the aft compartment, plus two in the forward compartment. These were supplied by four tanks storing of monomethylhydrazine fuel and nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer, and pressurized by of helium stored at in two tanks.

===Hatches===
The forward docking hatch was mounted at the top of the docking tunnel. It was in diameter and weighed , constructed from two machined rings that were weld-joined to a brazed honeycomb panel. The exterior side was covered with of insulation and a layer of aluminum foil. It was latched in six places and operated by a pump handle. The hatch contained a valve in its center, used to equalize the pressure between the tunnel and the CM so the hatch could be removed.

The unified crew hatch (UCH) measured high, wide, and weighed . It was operated by a pump handle, which drove a ratchet mechanism to open or close fifteen latches simultaneously.

===Docking assembly===
Apollo&#x27;s mission required the LM to dock with the CSM on return from the Moon, and also in the transposition, docking, and extraction maneuver at the beginning of the translunar coast. The docking mechanism was a non-androgynous system, consisting of a &quot;probe&quot; located in the nose of the CSM, which connected to the &quot;drogue&quot;, a truncated cone located on the lunar module. The probe was extended like a scissor jack to capture the drogue on initial contact, known as &quot;soft docking&quot;. Then the probe was retracted to pull the vehicles together and establish a firm connection, known as &quot;hard docking&quot;. The mechanism was specified by NASA to have the following functions:
*Allow the two vehicles to connect, and attenuate excess movement and energy caused by docking
*Align and center the two vehicles and pull them together for capture
*Provide a rigid structural connection between both vehicles, and be capable of removal and re-installation by a single crewman
*Provide a means of remote separation of both vehicles for the return to Earth, using pyrotechnic fasteners at the circumference of the CSM docking collar
*Provide redundant power and logic circuits for all electrical and pyrotechnic components.

====Coupling====
The probe head located in the CSM was self-centering and gimbal-mounted to the probe piston. As the probe head engaged in the opening of the drogue socket, three spring-loaded latches depressed and engaged. These latches allowed a so-called &#x27;soft dock&#x27; state and enabled the pitch and yaw movements in the two vehicles to subside. Excess movement in the vehicles during the &#x27;hard dock&#x27; process could cause damage to the docking ring and put stress on the upper tunnel. A depressed locking trigger link at each latch allowed a spring-loaded spool to move forward, maintaining the toggle linkage in an over-center locked position. In the upper end of the lunar module tunnel, the drogue, which was constructed of 1-inch-thick aluminum honeycomb core, bonded front and back to aluminum face sheets, was the receiving end of the probe head capture latches.

====Retraction====
After the initial capture and stabilization of the vehicles, the probe was capable of exerting a closing force of to draw the vehicles together. This force was generated by gas pressure acting on the center piston within the probe cylinder. Piston retraction compressed the probe and interface seals and actuated the 12 automatic ring latches which were located radially around the inner surface of the CSM docking ring. The latches were manually re-cocked in the docking tunnel by an astronaut after each hard docking event (lunar missions required two dockings).

====Separation====
An automatic extension latch attached to the probe cylinder body engaged and retained the probe center piston in the retracted position. Before vehicle separation in lunar orbit, manual cocking of the twelve ring latches was accomplished. The separating force from the internal pressure in the tunnel area was then transmitted from the ring latches to the probe and drogue.
In undocking, the release of the capture latches was accomplished by electrically energizing tandem-mounted DC rotary solenoids located in the center piston. In a temperature degraded condition, a single motor release operation was done manually in the lunar module by depressing the locking spool through an open hole in the probe heads, while release from the CSM was done by rotating a release handle at the back of the probe to rotate the motor torque shaft manually.
When the command and lunar modules separated for the last time, the probe and forward docking ring were pyrotechnically separated, leaving all docking equipment attached to the lunar module. In the event of an abort during launch from Earth, the same system would have explosively jettisoned the docking ring and probe from the CM as it separated from the boost protective cover.

===Cabin interior arrangement===
The central pressure vessel of the command module was its sole habitable compartment. It had an interior volume of and housed the main control panels, crew seats, guidance and navigation systems, food and equipment lockers, the waste management system, and the docking tunnel.

Dominating the forward section of the cabin was the crescent-shaped main display panel measuring nearly wide and tall. It was arranged into three panels, each emphasizing the duties of each crew member. The mission commander&#x27;s panel (left side) included the velocity, attitude, and altitude indicators, the primary flight controls, and the main FDAI (Flight Director Attitude Indicator).

The CM pilot served as navigator, so his control panel (center) included the Guidance and Navigation computer controls, the caution and warning indicator panel, the event timer, the Service Propulsion System and RCS controls, and the environmental control system controls.

The LM pilot served as systems engineer, so his control panel (right-hand side) included the fuel cell gauges and controls, the electrical and battery controls, and the communications controls.

Flanking the sides of the main panel were sets of smaller control panels. On the left side were a circuit breaker panel, audio controls, and the SCS power controls. On the right were additional circuit breakers and a redundant audio control panel, along with the environmental control switches. In total, the command module panels included 24 instruments, 566 switches, 40 event indicators, and 71 lights.

The three crew couches were constructed from hollow steel tubing and covered in a heavy, fireproof cloth known as Armalon. The leg pans of the two outer couches could be folded in a variety of positions, while the hip pan of the center couch could be disconnected and laid on the aft bulkhead. One rotation and one translation hand controller was installed on the armrests of the left-hand couch. The translation controller was used by the crew member performing the transposition, docking, and extraction maneuver with the LM, usually the CM Pilot. The center and right-hand couches had duplicate rotational controllers. The couches were supported by eight shock-attenuating struts, designed to ease the impact of touchdown on water or, in case of an emergency landing, on solid ground.

The contiguous cabin space was organized into six equipment bays:

* The lower equipment bay, which housed the Guidance and Navigation computer, sextant, telescope, and Inertial Measurement Unit; various communications beacons; medical stores; an audio center; the S-band power amplifier; etc. There was also an extra rotation hand controller mounted on the bay wall, so the CM Pilot/navigator could rotate the spacecraft as needed while standing and looking through the telescope to find stars to take navigational measurements with the sextant. This bay provided a significant amount of room for the astronauts to move around in, unlike the cramped conditions which existed in the previous Mercury and Gemini spacecraft.
* The left-hand forward equipment bay, which contained four food storage compartments, the cabin heat exchanger, pressure suit connector, potable water supply, and G&amp;N telescope eyepieces.
* The right-hand forward equipment bay, which housed two survival kit containers, a data card kit, flight data books and files, and other mission documentation.
* The left hand intermediate equipment bay, housing the oxygen surge tank, water delivery system, food supplies, the cabin pressure relief valve controls, and the ECS package.
* The right hand intermediate equipment bay, which contained the bio instrument kits, waste management system, food and sanitary supplies, and a waste storage compartment.
* The aft storage bay, behind the crew couches. This housed the 70 mm camera equipment, the astronaut&#x27;s garments, tool sets, storage bags, a fire extinguisher, CO2 absorbers, sleep restraint ropes, spacesuit maintenance kits, 16mm camera equipment, and the contingency lunar sample container.

The CM had five windows. The two side windows measured square next to the left and right-hand couches. Two forward-facing triangular rendezvous windows measured , used to aid in rendezvous and docking with the LM. The circular hatch window was in diameter located directly over the center couch. Each window assembly consisted of three thick panes of glass. The inner two panes, which were made of aluminosilicate, made up part of the module&#x27;s pressure vessel. The fused silica outer pane served as both a debris shield and as part of the heat shield. Each pane had an anti-reflective coating and a blue-red reflective coating on the inner surface.

==Service module (SM)==
===Construction===
The service module was an unpressurized cylindrical structure with a diameter of and long. The service propulsion engine nozzle and heat shield increased the total height to .
The interior was a simple structure consisting of a central tunnel section in diameter, surrounded by six pie-shaped sectors. The sectors were topped by a forward bulkhead and fairing, separated by six radial beams, covered on the outside by four honeycomb panels, and supported by an aft bulkhead and engine heat shield. The sectors were not all equal 60° angles, but varied according to required size.
* Sector 1 (50°) was originally unused, so it was filled with ballast to maintain the SM&#x27;s center-of gravity.

:On the last three lunar landing (I-J class) missions, it carried the scientific instrument module (SIM) with a powerful Itek focal length camera originally developed for the Lockheed U-2 and SR-71 reconnaissance aircraft. The camera photographed the Moon; had the S-IVB failed to fire causing the CSM to not leave earth orbit, astronauts would have used it to photograph the Earth. SIM also had other sensors and a subsatellite.
* Sector 2 (70°) contained the service propulsion system (SPS) oxidizer sump tank, so called because it directly fed the engine and was kept continuously filled by a separate storage tank, until the latter was empty. The sump tank was a cylinder with hemispherical ends, high, in diameter, and contained of oxidizer. Its total volume was 
* Sector 3 (60°) contained the SPS oxidizer storage tank, which was the same shape as the sump tank but slightly smaller at high and in diameter, and held of oxidizer. Its total volume was 
* Sector 4 (50°) contained the electrical power system (EPS) fuel cells with their hydrogen and oxygen reactants.
* Sector 5 (70°) contained the SPS fuel sump tank. This was the same size as the oxidizer sump tank and held of fuel.
* Sector 6 (60°) contained the SPS fuel storage tank, also the same size as the oxidizer storage tank. It held of fuel.

The forward fairing measured long and housed the reaction control system (RCS) computer, power distribution block, ECS controller, separation controller, and components for the high-gain antenna, and included eight EPS radiators and the umbilical connection arm containing the main electrical and plumbing connections to the CM. The fairing externally contained a retractable forward-facing spotlight; an EVA floodlight to aid the command module pilot in SIM film retrieval; and a flashing rendezvous beacon visible from away as a navigation aid for rendezvous with the LM.

The SM was connected to the CM using three tension ties and six compression pads. The tension ties were stainless steel straps bolted to the CM&#x27;s aft heat shield. It remained attached to the command module throughout most of the mission, until being jettisoned just prior to re-entry into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. At jettison, the CM umbilical connections were cut using a pyrotechnic-activated guillotine assembly. Following jettison, the SM aft translation thrusters automatically fired continuously to distance it from the CM, until either the RCS fuel or the fuel cell power was depleted. The roll thrusters were also fired for five seconds to make sure it followed a different trajectory from the CM and faster break-up on re-entry.

===Service propulsion system===


The service propulsion system (SPS) engine was originally designed to lift the CSM off the surface of the Moon in the direct ascent mission mode, The engine selected was the AJ10-137, which used Aerozine 50 as fuel and nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) as oxidizer to produce of thrust. A contract was signed in April 1962 for the Aerojet-General company to start developing the engine, resulting in a thrust level twice what was needed to accomplish the lunar orbit rendezvous (LOR) mission mode officially chosen in July of that year. The engine was actually used for mid-course corrections between the Earth and Moon, and to place the spacecraft into and out of lunar orbit. It also served as a retrorocket to perform the deorbit burn for Earth orbital flights.

The propellants were pressure-fed to the engine by of gaseous helium at , carried in two diameter spherical tanks.

The exhaust nozzle measured long and wide at the base. It was mounted on two gimbals to keep the thrust vector aligned with the spacecraft&#x27;s center of mass during SPS firings. The combustion chamber and pressurant tanks were housed in the central tunnel.

===Reaction control system===

Four clusters of four reaction control system (RCS) thrusters (known as &quot;quads&quot;) were installed around the upper section of the SM every 90°. The sixteen-thruster arrangement provided rotation and translation control in all three spacecraft axes. Each R-4D thruster measured long by diameter, generated of thrust, and used helium-fed monomethylhydrazine (MMH) as fuel and nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) as oxidizer. Each quad assembly measured and had its own fuel, oxidizer, and helium tanks mounted on the inside of an skin panel. The primary fuel (MMH) tank contained ; the secondary fuel tank contained ; the primary oxidizer tank contained , and the secondary oxidizer tank contained . The propellant tanks were pressurized from a single tank containing of liquid helium. Back flow was prevented by a series of check valves, and back flow and ullage requirements were resolved by containing the fuel and oxidizer in Teflon bladders which separated the propellants from the helium pressurant.

The four completely independent RCS clusters provided redundancy; only two adjacent functioning units were needed to allow complete attitude control.

The lunar module used a similar four-quad arrangement of R-4D thruster engines for its RCS.

===Electrical power system===

Electrical power was produced by three fuel cells, each measuring tall by in diameter and weighing . These combined hydrogen and oxygen to generate electrical power, and produced drinkable water as a byproduct. The cells were fed by two hemispherical-cylindrical diameter tanks, each holding of liquid hydrogen, and two spherical diameter tanks, each holding of liquid oxygen (which also supplied the environmental control system).

On the flight of Apollo 13, the EPS was disabled by an explosive rupture of one oxygen tank, which punctured the second tank and led to the loss of all oxygen. After the accident, a third oxygen tank was added to obviate operation below 50% tank capacity. That allowed the elimination of the tank&#x27;s internal stirring-fan equipment, which had contributed to the failure.

Also starting with Apollo 14, a 400 Ah auxiliary battery was added to the SM for emergency use. Apollo 13 had drawn heavily on its entry batteries in the first hours after the explosion, and while this new battery could not power the CM for more than 5–10 hours it would buy time in the event of a temporary loss of all three fuel cells. Such an event had occurred when Apollo 12 was struck twice by lightning during launch.

===Environmental control system===
Cabin atmosphere was maintained at of pure oxygen from the same liquid oxygen tanks that fed the electrical power system&#x27;s fuel cells. Potable water supplied by the fuel cells was stored for drinking and food preparation. A thermal control system using a mixture of water and ethylene glycol as coolant dumped waste heat from the CM cabin and electronics to outer space via two radiators located on the lower section of the exterior walls, one covering sectors 2 and 3 and the other covering sectors 5 and 6.

===Communications system===

Short-range communications between the CSM and LM employed two VHF scimitar antennas mounted on the SM just above the ECS radiators. These antennas were originally located on the Block I command module and performed a double function as aerodynamic strakes to stabilize the capsule after a launch abort. The antennas were moved to the Block II service module when this function was found unnecessary.

A steerable unified S-band high-gain antenna for long-range communications with Earth was mounted on the aft bulkhead. This was an array of four diameter reflectors surrounding a single square reflector. During launch it was folded down parallel to the main engine to fit inside the Spacecraft-to-LM Adapter (SLA). After CSM separation from the SLA, it deployed at a right angle to the SM.

Four omnidirectional S-band antennas on the CM were used when the attitude of the CSM kept the high-gain antenna from being pointed at Earth. These antennas were also used between SM jettison and landing.

==Modifications for Saturn IB missions==

The payload capability of the Saturn IB launch vehicle used to launch the Low Earth Orbit missions (Apollo 1 (planned), Apollo 7, Skylab 2, Skylab 3, Skylab 4, and Apollo–Soyuz) could not handle the mass of the fully fueled CSM. This was not a problem, because the spacecraft delta-v requirement of these missions was much smaller than that of the lunar mission; therefore they could be launched with less than half of the full SPS propellant load, by filling only the SPS sump tanks and leaving the storage tanks empty. The CSMs launched in orbit on Saturn IB ranged from (Apollo–Soyuz), to (Skylab 4).

The omnidirectional antennas sufficed for ground communications during the Earth orbital missions, so the high-gain S-band antenna on the SM was omitted from Apollo 1, Apollo 7, and the three Skylab flights. It was restored for the Apollo–Soyuz mission to communicate through the ATS-6 satellite in geostationary orbit, an experimental precursor to the current TDRSS system.

On the Skylab and Apollo–Soyuz missions, some additional dry weight was saved by removing the otherwise empty fuel and oxidizer storage tanks (leaving the partially filled sump tanks), along with one of the two helium pressurant tanks.
This permitted the addition of some extra RCS propellant to allow for use as a backup for the deorbit burn in case of possible SPS failure.

Since the spacecraft for the Skylab missions would not be occupied for most of the mission, there was lower demand on the power system, so one of the three fuel cells was deleted from these SMs. The command module was also partially painted white, to provide passive thermal control for the extended time it would remain in orbit.

The command module could be modified to carry extra astronauts as passengers by adding jump seat couches in the aft equipment bay. CM-119 was fitted with two jump seats as a Skylab Rescue vehicle, which was never used.

==Major differences between Block I and Block II==

===Command module===

* The Block II used a one-piece, quick-release, outward opening hatch instead of the two-piece plug hatch used on Block I, in which the inner piece had to be unbolted and placed inside the cabin in order to enter or exit the spacecraft (a flaw that doomed the Apollo 1 crew). The Block II hatch could be opened quickly in case of an emergency. (Both hatch versions were covered with an extra, removable section of the Boost Protective Cover which surrounded the CM to protect it in case of a launch abort.)
* The Block I forward access tunnel was smaller than Block II, and intended only for emergency crew egress after splashdown in case of problems with the main hatch. It was covered by the nose of the forward heat shield during flight. Block II contained a shorter forward heat shield with a flat removable hatch, beneath a docking ring and probe mechanism which captured and held the LM.
* The aluminized PET film layer, which gave the Block II heat shield a shiny mirrored appearance, was absent on Block I, exposing the light gray epoxy resin material, which on some flights was painted white.
* The Block I VHF scimitar antennas were located in two semicircular strakes originally thought necessary to help stabilize the CM during reentry. However, the uncrewed reentry tests proved these to be unnecessary for stability, and also aerodynamically ineffective at high simulated lunar reentry speeds. Therefore, the strakes were removed from Block II and the antennas were moved to the service module.
* The Block I CM/SM umbilical connector was smaller than on Block II, located near the crew hatch instead of nearly 180 degrees away from it. The separation point was between the modules, instead of the larger hinged arm mounted on the service module, separating at the CM sidewall on Block II.
* The two negative pitch RCS engines located in the forward compartment were arranged vertically on Block I, and horizontally on Block II.

===Service module===

* On the Apollo 6 uncrewed Block I flight, the SM was painted white to match the command module&#x27;s appearance. On Apollo 1, Apollo 4, and all the Block II spacecraft, the SM walls were left unpainted except for the EPS and ECS radiators, which were white.
* The EPS and ECS radiators were redesigned for Block II. Block I had three larger EPS radiators located on Sectors 1 and 4. The ECS radiators were located on the aft section of Sectors 2 and 5.
* The Block I fuel cells were located at the aft bulkhead in Sector 4, and their hydrogen and oxygen tanks were located in Sector 1.
* Block I had slightly longer SPS fuel and oxidizer tanks which carried more propellant than Block II.
* The Block II aft heat shield was a rectangular shape with slightly rounded corners at the propellant tank sectors. The Block I shield was the same basic shape, but bulged out slightly near the ends more like an hourglass or figure eight, to cover more of the tanks.

<text>Sir Edwin Henry Landseer (7 March 1802 – 1 October 1873) was an English painter and sculptor, well known for his paintings of animals – particularly horses, dogs, and stags. His best-known work is the lion sculptures at the base of Nelson&#x27;s Column in Trafalgar Square.

==Life==

Landseer was born in London, the son of the engraver John Landseer A.R.A. and Jane Potts. He was something of a prodigy whose artistic talents were recognised early on. He studied under several artists, including his father, and the history painter Benjamin Robert Haydon, who encouraged the young Landseer to perform dissections in order to fully understand animal musculature and skeletal structure. Landseer&#x27;s life was entwined with the Royal Academy. At the age of just 13, in 1815, he exhibited works there as an “Honorary Exhibitor”. He was elected an Associate at the minimum age of 24, and an Academician five years later in 1831.

He was an acquaintance of Charles Robert Leslie, who described him as &quot;a curly-headed youngster, dividing his time between Polito&#x27;s wild beasts at Exeter Change and the Royal Academy Schools.&quot; They also visited Scotland together in 1824, which had a great effect upon Landseer.

In 1823 Landseer was commissioned to paint a portrait of Georgiana Russell, Duchess of Bedford. Despite her being twenty years older than he was, they began an affair.

He was knighted in 1850, and although elected to be President of the Royal Academy in 1866 he declined the invitation and the position went to Francis Grant. In his late thirties Landseer suffered what is now believed to be a substantial nervous breakdown, and for the rest of his life was troubled by recurring bouts of melancholy, hypochondria, and depression, often aggravated by alcohol and drug use. In the last few years of his life Landseer&#x27;s mental stability was problematic, and at the request of his family he was declared insane in July 1872.

==Painting==
Landseer was a notable figure in 19th-century British art, and his works can be found in Tate Britain, the Victoria and Albert Museum, Kenwood House and the Wallace Collection in London. He also collaborated with fellow painter Frederick Richard Lee.

Landseer&#x27;s popularity in Victorian Britain was considerable, and his reputation as an animal painter was unrivalled. Much of his fame – and his income – was generated by the publication of engravings of his work, many of them by his brother Thomas.

One of his earliest paintings is credited as the origin of the myth that St. Bernard rescue dogs in the Alps carry a small casket of brandy on their collars. &quot;Alpine Mastiffs Reanimating a Distressed Traveller&quot; (1820) shows two of the dogs standing over a man who is partially buried in snow. One is barking to attract attention while the other, who is depicted with the miniature barrel, attempts to revive the man by licking his hand.

His appeal crossed class boundaries: reproductions of his works were common in middle-class homes, while he was also popular with the aristocracy. Queen Victoria commissioned numerous pictures from the artist. Initially asked to paint various royal pets, he then moved on to portraits of ghillies and gamekeepers. Then, in the year before her marriage, the queen commissioned a portrait of herself. He taught both Victoria and Albert to etch, and made portraits of Victoria&#x27;s children as babies, usually in the company of a dog. He also made two portraits of Victoria and Albert dressed for costume balls, at which he was a guest himself. One of his last paintings was a life-size equestrian portrait of the Queen, shown at the Royal Academy in 1873, made from earlier sketches.

Landseer was particularly associated with Scotland, which he had first visited in 1824 and the Highlands in particular, which provided the subjects (both human and animal) for many of his important paintings. The paintings included his early successes &quot;The Hunting of Chevy Chase &quot;(1825–26), &quot;An Illicit Whisky Still in the Highlands&quot; (1826–1829) and his more mature achievements, such as the majestic stag study &quot;The Monarch of the Glen&quot; (1851) and &quot;Rent Day in the Wilderness&quot; (1855–1868). In 1828, he was commissioned to produce illustrations for the Waverley Edition of Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s novels.

So popular and influential were Landseer&#x27;s paintings of dogs in the service of humanity that the name Landseer came to be the official name for the variety of Newfoundland dog that, rather than being black or mostly black, features a mixture of both black and white. It was this variety Landseer popularised in his paintings celebrating Newfoundlands as water rescue dogs, most notably &quot;Off to the Rescue&quot; (1827), &quot;A Distinguished Member of the Humane Society&quot; (1838), and &quot;Saved&quot; (1856). The paintings combine the Victorian conception of childhood with the appealing idea of noble animals devoted to humankind, a devotion indicated, in &quot;Saved,&quot; by the fact the dog has rescued the child without any apparent human involvement.

Landseer&#x27;s painting &quot;Laying Down The Law&quot; (1840) satirises the legal profession through anthropomorphism. It shows a group of dogs, with a poodle symbolising the Lord Chancellor.

&quot;The Shrew Tamed&quot; was entered at the 1861 Royal Academy Exhibition and caused controversy because of its subject matter. It showed a powerful horse on its knees among straw in a stable, while a young woman lies with her head pillowed on its flanks, lightly touching its head with her hand. The catalogue explained it as a portrait of a noted equestrienne, Ann Gilbert, applying the taming techniques of the famous &#x27;horse whisperer&#x27; John Solomon Rarey. Critics were troubled by the depiction of a languorous woman dominating a powerful animal and some concluded Landseer was implying the famous courtesan Catherine Walters, then at the height of her fame. Walters was an excellent horsewoman and along with other &quot;pretty horsebreakers&quot;, frequently appeared riding in Hyde Park.

Some of Landseer&#x27;s later works, such as his &quot;Flood in the Highlands&quot; and &quot;Man Proposes, God Disposes&quot; (both of 1864) are pessimistic in tone. The latter shows two polar bears toying with the bones of the dead and other remains, from Sir John Franklin&#x27;s failed Arctic expedition. The painting was purchased at auction by Thomas Holloway and hangs in the picture gallery of Royal Holloway, University of London. It is a college tradition to cover the painting with a Union Jack, when exams are held in the gallery, as there is a longstanding rumour that the painting drives people mad when they sit near it. In 1862 Landseer painted a portrait of Louisa Caroline Stewart-Mackenzie holding her daughter Maysie.

==Sculpture==

In 1858 the government commissioned Landseer to make four gold lions for the base of Nelson&#x27;s Column in Trafalgar Square, following the rejection of a set in stone by Thomas Milnes. Landseer accepted on condition that he would not have to start work for another nine months, and there was a further delay when he asked to be supplied with copies of casts of a real lion he knew were in the possession of the academy at Turin. The request proved complex, and the casts did not arrive until the summer of 1860. The lions were made at the Kensington studio of Carlo Marochetti, who also cast them. Work was slowed by Landseer&#x27;s ill health, and his fractious relationship with Marochetti. The sculptures were installed in 1867.

==Death==
Landseer&#x27;s death on 1 October 1873 was widely marked in England: shops and houses lowered their blinds, flags flew at half mast, his bronze lions at the base of Nelson&#x27;s column were hung with wreaths, and large crowds lined the streets to watch his funeral cortege pass. Landseer was buried in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London.

At his death, Landseer left behind three unfinished paintings: &quot;Finding the Otter&quot;, &quot;Nell Gwynne&quot;, and &quot;The Dead Buck&quot;, all on easels in his studio. It was his dying wish that his friend John Everett Millais should complete the paintings, and this he did.

In 1876, a 30-foot self-righting lifeboat, built by Woolfe of Shadwell, costing £275, was gifted to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, and placed at Chapel Lifeboat Station in Lincolnshire. Funded by Miss Jennie Landseer, the lifeboat was named &quot;Landseer&quot;, in memory of her late brother.

==Miscellaneous==
Landseer was rumoured to be able to paint with both hands at the same time, for example, paint a horse&#x27;s head with the right and its tail with the left, simultaneously. He was also known to be able to paint extremely quickly—when the mood struck him. He could also procrastinate, sometimes for years, over certain commissions.

The architect Sir Edwin Landseer Lutyens was named after him and was his godson—Lutyens&#x27; father was a friend of Landseer.

<text>The Paw Paw River is located in the U.S. state of Michigan in the southwest portion of the lower peninsula. It is formed by the confluence of the north and south branches at in Waverly Township in the northeast of Van Buren County. It flows approximately through Van Buren County and Berrien County until joining the St. Joseph River just above its mouth on Lake Michigan at Benton Harbor.

==History==
Native Americans named the Paw Paw River after the paw paw fruit that grew abundantly along the river&#x27;s banks.

==Ecology and conservation==
The watershed includes rare Great Lakes marshes and floodplain forests, which serve as habitats for migratory birds such as the prothonotary warbler (commonly known as the golden swamp warbler), as well as the endangered Mitchell&#x27;s satyr butterfly. Other rare species include the massasauga rattlesnake and the spotted turtle.

In November 2003, The Nature Conservancy announced the purchase of 139 acres (0.6 km2) in the Paw Paw Prairie Fen, located in the East Branch of the river near Mattawan. The Sarett Nature Center owns 800 acres (3.2 km2) of along the river in Berrien County, just north of Benton Harbor.

The Paw Paw River has 39 species of fish including walleye, bass, bluegill, black crappie, and northern pike. The mainstem is a coolwater stream as evidenced by the presence of burbot and mottled sculpin, it also contains hornyhead chub, common shiner, johnny darter, and walleye. Several riparian wetlands provide excellent habitat for northern pike. The fish community near the mouth is influenced by its proximity to Lake Michigan, and steelhead trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;) are stocked there. Potamodromous trout and salmon have access to most of the river system, and are shore-fished in the fall upstream of Hartford. There are 24 registered dams within the Paw Paw River sub-watershed, but these dams are all low head dams or on small tributaries, so potamodromous trout and salmon can migrate into its headwaters at Campbell Creek.

==Watershed==
The watershed covers about , mostly in Van Buren County, and also drains a tiny portion of Kalamazoo County.

Tributaries of the main branch include:
*Ox Creek in Benton Harbor
*Sand Creek and Blue Creek in Benton Township
*Ryno Drain in Coloma
*Mill Creek near Watervliet
*Paw Paw Lake and Little Paw Paw Lake (in Berrien County) near Watervliet
*Pine Creek between Hartford and Watervliet
*Mud Lake Drain between Hartford and Watervliet
*Hog Creek near Hartford
*Brush Creek near Lawrence
*Carter Creek between Paw Paw and Lawrence

North branch tributaries include:
*Brandywine Creek
*Hayden Creek
*Ritter Creek
*Todd Drain
*Campbell Creek
The north branch headwaters arise in springs near the Wolf Lake State Fish Hatchery.

South branch tributaries include:
*The east branch is about 8.5 miles (14 km) long and arises from two main sources: Paw Paw Lake (in Kalamazoo County) and Mattawan Creek in the village of Mattawan. It joins the South Branch in the city of Paw Paw.
*Three Mile Lake Drain, south of Paw Paw
*Eagle Lake Drain, south of Paw Paw
*Lawton Drain, east of Lawton
The south branch headwaters arise in Decatur Township in eastern Van Buren County.

<doc id="718116" wikidata="Q1361301" url="?curid=718116" title="Eros (concept)">
<text>Eros (, ; ) is a concept in ancient Greek philosophy referring to sensual or passionate love, from which the term &quot;erotic&quot; is derived. &quot;Eros&quot; has also been used in philosophy and psychology in a much wider sense, almost as an equivalent to &quot;life energy&quot;. Psychoanalysis uses the term to describe the &quot;universal desire&quot; that drives all innate needs (of the &quot;id&quot;), which according to Freud is identical to Plato&#x27;s conception. The Protestant philosopher C. S. Lewis posits it as one of the four ancient Greek words for love in Christianity, alongside &quot;storge&quot;, &quot;philia&quot;, and &quot;agape&quot;.

==In literature==

===Classical Greek tradition===
In the classical world, erotic love was generally described as a kind of madness or &quot;theia mania&quot; (&quot;madness from the gods&quot;). This erotic love was described through an elaborate metaphoric and mythological schema involving &quot;love&#x27;s arrows&quot; or &quot;love darts&quot;, the source of which was often the personified figure of Eros (or his Latin counterpart, Cupid), or another deity (such as Rumor). At times the source of the arrows was said to be the image of the beautiful love object itself. If these arrows struck the lover&#x27;s eyes, they would then travel to and &#x27;pierce&#x27; or &#x27;wound&#x27; their heart and overwhelm them with desire and longing (lovesickness). The image of the &quot;arrow&#x27;s wound&quot; was sometimes used to create oxymorons and rhetorical antithesis concerning its pleasure and pain.

&quot;Love at first sight&quot; was explained as a sudden beguiling of the lover through the action of these processes, but this was not the only mode of entering into passionate love in classical texts. At times the passion could occur after the initial meeting; for example, in Phaedra&#x27;s letter to Hippolytus in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Heroides&quot;: &quot;That time I went to Eleusis... it was then most of all (though you had pleased me before) that piercing love lodged in my deepest bones.&quot; At times, the passion could even precede the first glimpse, as in Paris&#x27; letter to Helen of Troy in the same work, where Paris says that his love for Helen came upon him before he had set eyes on her: &quot;...you were my heart&#x27;s desire before you were known to me. I beheld your features with my soul ere I saw them with my eyes; rumour, that told me of you, was the first to deal my wound.&quot;

Whether by &quot;first sight&quot; or by other routes, passionate love often had disastrous results according to the classical authors. In the event that the loved one was cruel or uninterested, this desire was shown to drive the lover into a state of depression, causing lamentation and illness. Occasionally, the loved one was depicted as an unwitting ensnarer of the lover, because of her sublime beauty—a &quot;divine curse&quot; which inspires men to kidnap her or try to rape her. Stories in which unwitting men catch sight of the naked body of Artemis the huntress (and sometimes Aphrodite) lead to similar ravages (as in the tale of Actaeon).

There are few written records of women&#x27;s lives and loves in ancient Greece. Nevertheless, some historians have suggested that women may have been the objects of love more often than was previously believed and that men&#x27;s love for women may have been an ideal. In ancient Athens the dominance of man in the marital relationship is expressed by figures such as the prominent Greek statesman and general Alcibiades. Another famous relationship between a man and a woman in ancient Athens was the romantic involvement of Aspasia with the statesman Pericles. In Sparta, the social status of women was stronger and the marital rituals were solemnized. There was an elaborate preparation for the first night after the marriage, while the man in a symbolic rite had to abduct his future wife before the official ceremony, while she had her hair cut short and dressed in boy&#x27;s clothes. The ideal outcome of marital eros in Sparta was the birth of a healthy boy.

In &quot;The Symposium&quot; by Plato, Aristophanes relays a myth of the origin of both heterosexual and homosexual love. Eros paidikos, or pedagogic pederasty, was apparently known since 200 years before Plato. Originally, according to Aristophanes, each human being had two heads, four arms, and four legs, before Zeus decided to split every person in two. After everyone was split, each half searched for their other half, to make themselves whole again. Some people were originally half-male and half-female, and when Zeus split them they became men and women who sought opposite-sex partners. Some people were originally all-female, and they split into females who sought female partners. Some were all-male, and they split into males who sought other males.

===Plato===
The ancient Greek philosopher Plato developed an idealistic concept of eros which would prove to be very influential in modern times. In general, Plato did not consider physical attraction to be a necessary part of eros. According to Plato, eros could be diverted to philosophy (inclusive of mathematical, ethical and ascetical training), rather than dissipated in sexuality, for the purpose of using erotic energy as a vehicle for the transformation of consciousness, and union with the Divine. In &quot;Symposium&quot;, eros is described as a universal force that moves all things towards peace, perfection and divinity. Eros himself is a &quot;daimon&quot;, namely a creature between divinity and mortality.

&quot;Platonic love&quot; in this original sense can be attained by the intellectual purification of eros from carnal into ideal form. Plato argues there that eros is initially felt for a person, but with contemplation it can become an appreciation for the beauty within that person, or even an appreciation for beauty itself in an ideal sense. As Plato expresses it, eros can help the soul to &quot;remember&quot; beauty in its pure form. It follows from this, for Plato, that eros can contribute to an understanding of truth.

Eros, understood in this sense, differed considerably from the common meaning of the word in the Greek language of Plato&#x27;s time. It also differed from the meaning of the word in contemporary literature and poetry. For Plato, eros is neither purely human nor purely divine: it is something intermediate which he calls a daimon.

Its main characteristic is permanent aspiration and desire. Even when it seems to give, eros continues to be a &quot;desire to possess&quot;, but nevertheless it is different from a purely sensual love in being the love that tends towards the sublime. According to Plato, the gods do not love, because they do not experience desires, inasmuch as their desires are all satisfied. They can thus only be an object, not a subject of love (&quot;Symposium&quot; 200-1). For this reason they do not have a direct relationship with man; it is only the mediation of eros that allows the connecting of a relationship (&quot;Symposium&quot; 203). Eros is thus the way that leads man to divinity, but not vice versa.

Paradoxically, for Plato, the object of eros does not have to be physically beautiful. This is because the object of eros is beauty, and the greatest beauty is eternal, whereas physical beauty is in no way eternal. However, if the lover achieves possession of the beloved&#x27;s &quot;inner&quot; (i.e., ideal) beauty, his need for happiness will be fulfilled, because happiness is the experience of knowing that you are participating in the ideal.

===European literature===

The classical conception of love&#x27;s arrows was developed further by the troubadour poets of Provence during the medieval period, and became part of the European courtly love tradition. The role of a woman&#x27;s eyes in eliciting erotic desire was particularly emphasized by the Provençal poets, as N. E. Griffin states:

According to this description, love originates upon the eyes of the lady when encountered by those of her future lover. The love thus generated is conveyed on bright beams of light from her eyes to his, through which it passes to take up its abode in his heart.
In some medieval texts, the gaze of a beautiful woman is compared to the sight of a basilisk—a legendary reptile said to have the power to cause death with a single glance.

These images continued to be circulated and elaborated upon in the literature and iconography of the Renaissance and Baroque periods. Boccaccio for example, in his &quot;Il Filostrato&quot;, mixes the tradition of Cupid&#x27;s arrow with the Provençal emphasis on the eyes as the birthplace of love: &quot;Nor did he (Troilus) who was so wise shortly before... perceive that Love with his darts dwelt within the rays of those lovely eyes... nor notice the arrow that sped to his heart.&quot;

The rhetorical antithesis between the pleasure and pain from love&#x27;s dart continued through the 17th century, as for example, in these classically inspired images from &quot;The Fairy-Queen&quot;:

===Roman Catholic teachings===

Ancient Jewish tradition, Augustine of Hippo, and Bonaventure all have influence on Roman Catholic marital teachings regarding &quot;eros&quot;. In his first encyclical, &quot;Deus caritas est&quot;, Pope Benedict XVI discusses three of the four greek relationship terms: &quot;eros&quot;, &quot;philia&quot; and &quot;agape&quot;, and contrasts between them. In &quot;agape&quot;, for Benedict, one gives of oneself to another; in &quot;eros&quot;, the self seeks to receive from another self; &quot;philia&quot; is the mutual love between friends. He explains that &quot;eros&quot; and &quot;agape&quot; are both inherently good, but that &quot;eros&quot; risks being downgraded to mere sex if it is not balanced by an element of spiritual Christianity.

==Modern psychologists==

===Freud ===
In Freudian psychology, eros, not to be confused with libido, is not exclusively the sex drive, but our life force, the will to live. It is the desire to create life, and favors productivity and construction. In early psychoanalytic writings, instincts from the eros were opposed by forces from the ego. But in later psychoanalytic theory, eros is opposed by the destructive death instinct of Thanatos (death instinct or death drive).

In his 1925 paper &quot;The Resistances to Psycho-Analysis&quot;, Freud explains that the psychoanalytic concept of sexual energy is more in line with the Platonic view of eros, as expressed in the Symposium, than with the common use of the word &quot;sex&quot; as related primarily to genital activity. He also mentions the philosopher Schopenhauer as an influence. He then goes on to confront his adversaries for ignoring such great precursors and for tainting his whole theory of eros with a &quot;pansexual&quot; tendency. He finally writes that his theory naturally explains this collective misunderstanding as a predictable resistance to the acknowledgement of sexual activity in childhood.

However, F. M. Cornford finds the standpoints of Plato and of Sigmund Freud to be &quot;diametrically opposed&quot; with regard to eros. In Plato, eros is a spiritual energy initially, which then &quot;falls&quot; downward; whereas in Freud eros is a physical energy which is &quot;sublimated&quot; upward.

The philosopher and sociologist Herbert Marcuse appropriated the Freudian concept of eros for his highly influential 1955 work &quot;Eros and Civilization&quot;.

===Jung===
In Carl Jung&#x27;s analytical psychology, the counterpart to eros is &quot;logos&quot;, a Greek term for the principle of rationality. Jung considers logos to be a masculine principle, while eros is a feminine principle. According to Jung:
Woman&#x27;s psychology is founded on the principle of &quot;Eros&quot;, the great binder and loosener, whereas from ancient times the ruling principle ascribed to man is &quot;Logos&quot;. The concept of &quot;Eros&quot; could be expressed in modern terms as psychic relatedness, and that of &quot;Logos&quot; as objective interest.
This gendering of eros and logos is a consequence of Jung&#x27;s theory of the anima/animus syzygy of the human psyche. Syzygy refers to the split between male and female. According to Jung, this split is recapitulated in the unconscious mind by means of &quot;contrasexual&quot; (opposite-gendered) elements called the anima (in men) and the animus (in women). Thus men have an unconscious feminine principle, the &quot;anima&quot;, which is characterized by feminine eros. The work of individuation for men involves becoming conscious of the anima and learning to accept it as one&#x27;s own, which entails accepting eros. This is necessary in order to see beyond the projections that initially blind the conscious ego. &quot;Taking back the projections&quot; is a major task in the work of individuation, which involves owning and subjectivizing unconscious forces which are initially regarded as alien.

In essence, Jung&#x27;s concept of eros is not dissimilar to the Platonic one. Eros is ultimately the desire for wholeness, and although it may initially take the form of passionate love, it is more truly a desire for &quot;psychic relatedness&quot;, a desire for interconnection and interaction with other sentient beings. However, Jung was inconsistent, and he did sometimes use the word &quot;eros&quot; as a shorthand to designate sexuality.

<doc id="718119" wikidata="Q1046185" url="?curid=718119" title="Michael Young (baseball)">
<text>Michael Brian Young (born October 19, 1976) is an American former professional baseball infielder who played 14 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Texas Rangers, Philadelphia Phillies, and Los Angeles Dodgers. Since 2014, Young has worked in the Rangers’ front office as a Special Assistant to the General Manager. Originally a second baseman, the versatile Young was a five-time All-Star at shortstop, once at third base, and once as a combination designated hitter / utility infielder. He was the 2005 American League (AL) batting champion.

Young played baseball in high school at Bishop Amat Memorial High School and in college at University of California, Santa Barbara (UC Santa Barbara). He was originally drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in 1994, but elected to return to college and was eventually drafted in 1997 by the Toronto Blue Jays. After spending several seasons in the minor leagues with the Blue Jays, Young was traded to the Rangers, where he spent over a decade. While with the Rangers, Young set several club records in offensive statistical categories, including runs scored and total bases. In 2016, Young was inducted into the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame. In 2019, Young&#x27;s No. 10 was retired by the Rangers.

==Early life and education==
Young attended Bishop Amat Memorial High School in La Puente, California, followed by the University of California, Santa Barbara, to which he later donated money to refurbish the school&#x27;s baseball field.

Young was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the 25th round of the 1994 Major League Baseball draft but did not sign. Three years later the Toronto Blue Jays selected him in the fifth round of the 1997 Major League Baseball draft. Young signed with the Blue Jays, who traded him in 2000 with pitcher Darwin Cubillán to the Rangers for Esteban Loaiza while Young was still in their minor league system.

==Playing career==
===Minor leagues (1997–2000)===
Young made his professional debut in 1997 with the St. Catharines Blue Jays in the New York–Penn League (NY-Penn) (short-season A). Among his achievements in the NY-Penn League were a 16-game hitting streak, tying for fifth with 48 RBIs, and tying for third in the league with 136 total bases. In 1998, he spent the season with the Hagerstown Suns of the South Atlantic League. Playing second base, he led all players at his position in fielding percentage. 1999 would be an all-star season for Young. Playing for the Dunedin Blue Jays of the Florida State League, he earned spots on both the midseason and postseason all-star teams by leading the league in doubles and finishing fourth in batting average and hits, .313 and 155 respectively. After the regular season, he played for the Rancho Cucamonga Surfers in the California Fall League. He split 2000 between Double-A and Triple-A and, on July 19, was traded to the Rangers with Darwin Cubillán for Esteban Loaiza. The Rangers purchased his contract on September 27. He played the final five games of the season in the majors making his debut as a pinch runner. Though he began 2001 in Triple-A, he was recalled to the majors on May 25 and did not return to the minors during the season.

===Texas Rangers (2000–2012)===
Young reached the Majors briefly in 2000, playing 2nd and getting two at-bats. He hit .249 in 106 games as a second baseman in 2001. In 2002, Young placed second in fielding among second basemen with a .988 fielding percentage. In 2003, Young was 3rd in the league in hits with 204 and led all second baseman with a batting average of .306. Young had a fielding percentage of .987.

 After signing a new contract, Young moved to shortstop, filling the hole left by the departure of regular Ranger&#x27;s shortstop Alex Rodriguez in 2004, to make room for newly acquired second baseman Alfonso Soriano. He was second in the American League in hits with 216 and at bats with 690, fourth in runs with 114, and ninth in batting with an average of .313. He spent 89 games hitting in the leadoff spot, the last time in his career that he hit leadoff before 2013.

Young won the AL batting title in 2005 with an average of .331 and was first in MLB in hits with 221. He was second in AL in at-bats with 668, and his 114 runs were fifth-best. Young also established a career-high in home runs with 24. Young&#x27;s 91 RBIs placed him second among all shortstops in the AL.

On February 14, 2006, Young and Rangers teammate Mark Teixeira were selected to the United States roster for the 2006 World Baseball Classic.

After the 2006 MLB All-Star Game held at PNC Park in Pittsburgh, Young was awarded the Major League Baseball All-Star Game MVP Award after hitting a game-winning two-run triple in the ninth inning. Young led the American League in fielding percentage at shortstop with .981. Young also played all 162 games of the 2006 season, had 217 hits and topped 100 RBI for the first time in his career.

In March 2007, Young agreed to an $80 million contract extension that would have kept him with the Rangers until 2013.

Young finished the 2007 season with a batting average of .315, which led the Rangers and was 11th-highest in the AL. Young also led the Rangers with 94 RBIs and was second among all shortstops in the AL. Young was second on the team and tied a career-high in stolen bases with 13. Young&#x27;s 201 hits were 4th in the AL, and marked the 5th consecutive 200-hit season, joining Ichiro Suzuki and Wade Boggs as the only players to do so since 1940 and just the second middle infielder, along with Charlie Gehringer, to have accomplished that feat.

Young played in the longest All-Star game in history. He drove in the game-winning RBI at the 2008 MLB All-Star Game after four hours and 40 minutes of playing time. Also, in 2008 Young won the Gold Glove at shortstop for the American League.
In 2009, Young moved to third base to make room for shortstop prospect Elvis Andrus. The Rangers did not consult Young on this, and he requested a trade. He subsequently rescinded the request. On April 19, 2009, Young hit his first career walk-off home run, off Royals pitcher Kyle Farnsworth. Young was voted on the AL 2009 All Star team by the players.

On June 16, 2010, Young hit a ground ball up the middle to collect his 1,748th career hit and passed Iván Rodríguez to become the Rangers&#x27; career leader in hits. On defense, in 2010 he tied for the AL lead in errors by a third baseman, with 19, and had the lowest fielding percentage among them, at .950.

During the 2010–11 offseason, Young said that the Rangers had &quot;misled and manipulated&quot; him and requested a trade. The Rangers, having acquired free agent third baseman Adrián Beltré, planned to have Young be the team&#x27;s primary designated hitter as well as a utility infielder, and see time at first base for the first time in his career. He was a 2011 American League All Star.

On August 7, 2011, Young hit an infield single against Josh Tomlin of the Cleveland Indians for his 2,000th career hit.

In 2011, Young batted .338 (3rd in the American League) with 11 home runs, primarily splitting his time between DH (69 games), third base (40 games), and first base (36 games). He tied with Adrián González for the AL lead in hits (213), and was 5th in RBIs (106) and sacrifice flies (9), 8th in on-base percentage (.380), and 10th in doubles (41).

After Young struggled in the 2012 season, the Rangers asked if he desired a trade as they planned to cut his playing time for the 2013 season. Young did not request one, though the Rangers began to pursue a trade, and eventually traded him to the Philadelphia Phillies. 

Since being traded in 2012, the Rangers had not issued Young&#x27;s uniform number 10 to any player or coach. On June 18, 2019, the Rangers announced they would retire Young&#x27;s number 10 jersey in August.

====Rangers career rankings====
At the time of his departure from the team, Young led the Rangers in several stat categories including games played (1774), hits (2178), doubles (406), triples (55), runs scored (1057), at bats (7221), strikeouts (1132), extra-base hits (632), and total bases (3210). He was third all-time in runs batted in (RBIs) with 962 and sixth all-time in home runs with 172. He also held several single-season records including most multi-hit games (70 in 2004), most hits (221 in 2005), doubles (52 in 2006), and at bats and plate appearances in 2006 (691 and 748 respectively).

===Philadelphia Phillies (2013)===
Young agreed to waive his no-trade clause and on December 9, 2012, was traded to the Phillies in exchange for pitcher Josh Lindblom and minor league pitcher Lisalverto Bonilla. The deal reunited him with former teammates Laynce Nix, Cliff Lee and Mike Adams. The Phillies were monitoring Young for some time before his acquisition. Their former Hall of Fame third baseman Mike Schmidt said, &quot;we got a Derek Jeter kind of player on our team all of a sudden ... He&#x27;s two or three Michael Young years away from being a Hall of Famer, first ballot maybe.&quot; Phillies general manager Rubén Amaro, Jr. and manager Charlie Manuel also were fond of Young and made him a target heading into the Winter Meetings. Once they agreed to a deal, Young had to approve it, which he did, later mentioning that he would only have done so to go to a winning team like the Phillies. The Phillies viewed Young as a stop-gap to get them to top prospect Cody Asche.

In 126 games with the Phillies, he hit .276 with 8 homers and 42 RBI. However, the Phillies did not turn out to be the &quot;winning team&quot; that Young had expected. On August 31, the Phillies&#x27; record stood at 62–74, and they were games out of first place and 14 games out of the last available playoff spot. He was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers. Upon leaving Philadelphia, Young released a statement in which he thanked the Phillies and said that he &quot;had a blast&quot; playing in Philadelphia and that he would recommend it &quot;in a heartbeat&quot; to any other player. Phillies players, namely younger players such as Darin Ruf and Cody Asche, commented that they loved having a veteran like Young to whom they could look up and seek advice from. Ruf said, &quot;He was the type of guy to come up to a younger guy like myself or Cody and tell us a thing or two about what he thinks we need to do and how he thinks we could prolong our careers. He was just a great teammate to have around.&quot;

===Los Angeles Dodgers (2013)===

On August 31, 2013, he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for minor league pitcher Rob Rasmussen. In the last year of his contract, Young again waived his no-trade clause to join his hometown team for an expected playoff run. Young was acquired to be a backup infielder and provide a veteran presence on the team. Young made his Dodgers debut on September 1, 2013 pinch hitting in a game against the Colorado Rockies. He appeared in 21 games for the Dodgers at a variety of positions and hit .314.

After initially considering some offers as a free agent, Young announced his retirement from baseball on January 31, 2014.

===Career statistics===
In 1970 games over 14 seasons, Young posted a .300 batting average (2375-for-7918) with 1137 runs, 441 doubles, 60 triples, 185 home runs, 1030 RBI, 90 stolen bases, 575 bases on balls, .346 on-base percentage and .441 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .979 fielding percentage playing at all four infield positions. In 43 postseason games, he batted .238 (36-for-151) with 11 runs, 10 doubles, 3 home runs, 19 RBI and 5 walks.

==Post-playing career==
On November 5, 2014, Young was hired by the Texas Rangers as a special assistant to general manager Jon Daniels. He played a key role in the offseason acquisition of Ian Desmond in 2016.

On July 30, 2016, Young was inducted into the Texas Rangers Baseball Hall of Fame in a pregame ceremony before the team&#x27;s matchup with the Kansas City Royals.

Young was eligible to be elected into the Hall of Fame in 2019, but received less than 5% of the vote and became ineligible for the 2020 ballot.

On August 31, 2019, the Texas Rangers retired Michael Young&#x27;s #10.

Young served as the manager for the National League team in the 2024 All-Star Futures Game.

==Personal life==
Young&#x27;s mother is of Mexican descent. Young met his wife Cristina, also Mexican-American, in high school. They have three sons named Mateo, Emilio, and Antonio respectively. Young is a cousin of former WBO Light Welterweight boxing champion Zack Padilla. Another cousin, Jason Young, played minor league baseball.

Young is a philanthropist. He and his wife are sponsors of the Wipe Out Kids&#x27; Cancer campaign. In 2006, Young began the Young Heroes Scholarship Program, and in 2010, the Michael Young Family Hispanic Scholarship Program was established. In July 2011, Young and his wife announced the launch of the Michael Young Family Foundation, a charity that supports the involvement of children&#x27;s health in all areas: physical social, mental, and educational. Young is represented by baseball agent Dan Lozano.

Young is a two-time winner of the Marvin Miller Man of the Year Award winning in 2008 and 2011. He is one of only five players who have won multiple times (John Smoltz, Jim Thome, Curtis Granderson, and Marcus Semien). In 2021, he donated $50,000 to help with the restoration of the Reverchon Park Ball Field in Dallas. Young&#x27;s hobbies include billiards and golf.

<text>Madison Grant (November 19, 1865 – May 30, 1937) was an American lawyer, zoologist, anthropologist, and writer known for his work as a conservationist, eugenicist, and advocate of scientific racism. Grant is less noted for his far-reaching achievements in conservation than for his pseudoscientific advocacy of Nordicism, a form of racism which views the &quot;Nordic race&quot; as superior.

As a white supremacist eugenicist, Grant was the author of &quot;The Passing of the Great Race&quot; (1916), one of the most famous racist texts, and played an active role in crafting immigration restriction and anti-miscegenation laws in the United States. As a conservationist, he is credited with the saving of species including the American bison, helped create the Bronx Zoo, Glacier National Park, and Denali National Park, and co-founded the Save the Redwoods League. Grant developed much of the discipline of wildlife management.

== Early life ==
Grant was born in New York City, the son of Gabriel Grant, a physician and American Civil War surgeon, and Caroline Manice. Madison Grant&#x27;s mother was a descendant of Jessé de Forest, the Walloon Huguenot who in 1623 recruited the first band of colonists to settle in New Netherland, the Dutch Republic&#x27;s territory on the American East Coast. On his father&#x27;s side, Madison Grant&#x27;s first American ancestor was Richard Treat, dean of Pitminster Church in England, who in 1630 was one of the first Puritan settlers of New England. Grant&#x27;s forebears through Treat&#x27;s line include Robert Treat (a colonial governor of New Jersey), Robert Treat Paine (a signer of the Declaration of Independence), Charles Grant (Madison Grant&#x27;s grandfather, who served as an officer in the War of 1812), and Gabriel Grant (father of Madison), a prominent physician and the health commissioner of Newark, New Jersey. Grant was a lifelong resident of New York City.

Grant was the oldest of four siblings. The children&#x27;s summers, and many of their weekends, were spent at Oatlands, the Long Island country estate built by their grandfather DeForest Manice in the 1830s. As a child, he attended private schools and traveled Europe and the Middle East with his father. He attended Yale University, graduating early and with honors in 1887. He received a law degree from Columbia Law School, and practiced law after graduation; however, his interests were primarily those of a naturalist. He never married and had no children. He first achieved a political reputation when he and his brother, DeForest Grant, took part in the 1894 electoral campaign of New York mayor William Lafayette Strong.

== Career and conservation efforts ==
Thomas C. Leonard wrote that &quot;Grant was a cofounder of the American environmental movement, a crusading conservationist who preserved the California redwoods; saved the American bison from extinction; fought for stricter gun control laws; helped create Glacier and Denali national parks; and worked to preserve whales, bald eagles, and pronghorn antelopes.&quot;

Grant was a friend of several U.S. presidents, including Theodore Roosevelt and Herbert Hoover. He is credited with saving many species from extinction, and co-founded the Save the Redwoods League with Frederick Russell Burnham, John C. Merriam, and Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1918. He is also credited with helping develop the first deer hunting laws in New York state, legislation which spread to other states as well over time.
He was also a developer of wildlife management; he believed its development to be harmonized with the concept of eugenics. Grant helped to found the Bronx Zoo, build the Bronx River Parkway, save the American bison as an organizer of the American Bison Society, and helped to create Glacier National Park and Denali National Park. In 1906, as Secretary of the New York Zoological Society, he lobbied to put Ota Benga, a Congolese man from the Mbuti people (a tribe of &quot;pygmies&quot;), on display alongside apes at the Bronx Zoo. 

Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, he served on the boards of many eugenic and philanthropic societies, including the board of trustees at the American Museum of Natural History, as director of the American Eugenics Society, vice president of the Immigration Restriction League, a founding member of the Galton Society, and one of the eight members of the International Committee of Eugenics. He was awarded the gold medal of the Society of Arts and Sciences in 1929. In 1931, the world&#x27;s largest tree (in Dyerville, California) was dedicated to Grant, Merriam, and Osborn by the California State Board of Parks in recognition for their environmental efforts. A subspecies of caribou was named after Grant as well (&quot;Rangifer tarandus granti&quot;, also known as Grant&#x27;s Caribou). He was an early member of the Boone and Crockett Club (a big game hunting organization) since 1893, and he mobilized its wealthy members to influence the government to conserve vast areas of land against encroaching industries. He was the head of the New York Zoological Society from 1925 until his death.

Grant&#x27;s campaigns for conservationism and eugenics were not unrelated: both assumed the need for various types of stewardship over their charges. Grant was generally indifferent to forms of animal life that he did not regard as aristocratic, and assigned such a hierarchy to humans as well. Historian Jonathan Spiro wrote, &quot;Whereas wildlife managers felt that the survival of the species as a whole was more important than the lives of a few individuals, so Grant preached that the fate of the race outweighed that of a few particular humans who were &#x27;of no value to the community&#x27;.&quot; In Grant&#x27;s mind, natural resources needed to be conserved for the &quot;Nordic race&quot; to the exclusion of other races. Grant viewed the Nordic race as he did any of his endangered species, and considered the modern industrial society as infringing just as much on its existence as it did on the redwoods. Like many eugenicists, Grant saw modern civilization as a violation of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;, whether it manifested itself in the over-logging of the forests, or the survival of the poor via welfare or charity. In the words of the &quot;New Yorker&quot;, for figures such as Grant, &quot;it was an unsettlingly short step from managing forests to managing the human gene pool&quot;.

== Nordicism ==
Grant was the author of the once much-read book &quot;The Passing of the Great Race&quot; (1916), an elaborate work of racial hygiene attempting to explain the racial history of Europe. The most significant of Grant&#x27;s concerns was with the changing &quot;stock&quot; of American immigration of the early 20th century (characterized by increased numbers of immigrants from Southern Europe and Eastern Europe, as opposed to Western Europe and Northern Europe), &quot;Passing of the Great Race&quot; was a &quot;racial&quot; interpretation of contemporary anthropology and history, stating race as the basic motor of civilization.

Similar ideas were proposed by prehistorian Gustaf Kossinna in Germany. Grant promoted the idea of the &quot;Nordic race&quot;, a loosely defined biological-cultural grouping rooted in Scandinavia, as the key social group responsible for human development; thus the subtitle of the book was &quot;The racial basis of European history&quot;. As an avid eugenicist, Grant further advocated the separation, quarantine, and eventual collapse of &quot;undesirable&quot; traits and &quot;worthless race types&quot; from the human gene pool and the promotion, spread, and eventual restoration of desirable traits and &quot;worthwhile race types&quot; conducive to Nordic society. He wrote, &quot;A rigid system of selection through the elimination of those who are weak or unfit—in other words social failures—would solve the whole question in one hundred years, as well as enable us to get rid of the undesirables who crowd our jails, hospitals, and insane asylums. The individual himself can be nourished, educated and protected by the community during his lifetime, but the state through sterilization must see to it that his line stops with him, or else future generations will be cursed with an ever increasing load of misguided sentimentalism. This is a practical, merciful, and inevitable solution of the whole problem, and can be applied to an ever widening circle of social discards, beginning always with the criminal, the diseased, and the insane, and extending gradually to types which may be called weaklings rather than defectives, and perhaps ultimately to worthless race types.&quot;

Grant&#x27;s work is considered one of the most influential and vociferous works of scientific racism and eugenics to come out of the United States. Stephen Jay Gould described &quot;The Passing of the Great Race&quot; as &quot;the most influential tract of American scientific racism&quot;. &quot;The Passing of the Great Race&quot; was published in multiple printings in the United States, and was translated into other languages, including German in 1925. By 1937, the book had sold 16,000 copies in the United States alone.

The book was embraced by proponents of the Nazi movement in Germany and was the first non-German book ordered to be reprinted by the Nazis when they took power. Adolf Hitler wrote to Grant, &quot;The book is my Bible.&quot;

One of Grant&#x27;s long-time opponents was the anthropologist Franz Boas. Grant disliked Boas and for several years tried to get him fired from his position at Columbia University. Boas and Grant were involved in a bitter struggle for control over the discipline of anthropology in the United States, while they both served (along with others) on the National Research Council Committee on Anthropology after the First World War.

Grant represented the &quot;hereditarian&quot; branch of physical anthropology at the time, despite his relatively amateur status, and was staunchly opposed to and by Boas himself (and the latter&#x27;s students), who advocated cultural anthropology. Boas and his students eventually wrested control of the American Anthropological Association from Grant and his supporters, who had used it as a flagship organization for his brand of anthropology. In response, Grant, along with American eugenicist and biologist Charles B. Davenport, in 1918 founded the Galton Society as an alternative to Boas.

==Immigration restriction==

Grant advocated restricted immigration to the United States through limiting immigration from Eastern Europe and Southern Europe, as well as the complete end of immigration from East Asia. He also advocated efforts to purify the American population through selective breeding. He served as the vice president of the Immigration Restriction League from 1922 to his death. Acting as an expert on world racial data, Grant also provided statistics for the Immigration Act of 1924 to set the quotas on immigrants from certain European countries. Even after passing the statute, Grant continued to be irked that even a smattering of non-Nordics were allowed to immigrate to the country each year. His support for anti-miscegenation laws was quoted in arguments for the Racial Integrity Act of 1924 in Virginia. 

Though Grant was extremely influential in legislating his view of racial theory, he began to fall out of favor in the United States in the early 1930s. The declining interest in his work has been attributed both to the effects of the Great Depression, which resulted in a general backlash against Social Darwinism and related philosophies, and to the changing dynamics of racial issues in the United States during the interwar period. Rather than subdivide Europe into separate racial groups, the bi-racial (black vs. white) views of Grant&#x27;s protegé Lothrop Stoddard became more dominant in the aftermath of the Great Migration of African-Americans from Southern States to Northern and Western ones (Guterl 2001).

== Legacy ==
According to historian of economics Thomas C. Leonard: &quot;Prominent American eugenicists, including movement leaders Charles Davenport and Madison Grant, were conservatives. They identified fitness with social and economic position, and they also were hard hereditarians, dubious of the Lamarckian inheritance clung to by progressives. But as eugenicists, these conservatives were not classical liberals. Like all eugenicists, they were illiberal. Conservatives do not object to state coercion so long as it is used for what they regard as the right purposes, and these men were happy to trample on individual rights to obtain the greater good of improved hereditary health... Historians invariably style Madison Grant a conservative, because he was a blueblood clubman from a patrician family, and his best- known work, &quot;The Passing of the Great Race&quot;, is a museum piece of scientific racism. But Grant&#x27;s eugenic ideas originated from a corner of the conservative impulse intimately connected to Progressivism: conservation.&quot;

Leonard wrote that Grant also opposed war, had doubts about imperialism, and supported birth control.

Leonard&#x27;s view that eugenicists such as Grant were conservatives is an outlier, however. Writer Jonah Goldberg has noted that &quot;eugenics lay at the heart of the progressive enterprise&quot; and was embraced by almost all early progressives, from Margaret Sanger to H.G. Wells and John Maynard Keynes. Likewise, Thomas Sowell has noted that most leading eugenicists were firmly ensconced within progressive intellectual circles, where the desire for the government to take strong action to protect the gene pool went hand-in-hand with other statist views, including opposition to free-market capitalism. Similarly, historian Edwin Black has stated that the eugenic crusade was &quot;created in the publications and academic research rooms of the Carnegie Institution, verified by the research grants of the Rockefeller Foundation, validated by leading scholars from the best Ivy League universities, and financed by the special efforts of the Harriman railroad fortune.&quot; From this perspective, it is perfectly understandable that Madison Grant—a graduate of elite Ivy League universities and a strong advocate for various progressive causes of the day—would also be a eugenicist.

Grant became a part of popular culture in 1920s America, especially in New York. Grant&#x27;s conservationism and fascination with zoological natural history made him influential among the New York elite, who agreed with his cause, most notably Theodore Roosevelt. Author F. Scott Fitzgerald featured a reference to Grant in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. Tom Buchanan, a fatuous Long Island aristocrat married to Daisy, was reading a book called &quot;The Rise of the Colored Empires&quot; by &quot;this man Goddard&quot;, blending Grant&#x27;s &quot;Passing of the Great Race&quot; and his colleague Lothrop Stoddard&#x27;s &quot;The Rising Tide of Color Against White World Supremacy&quot;.
Grant left no offspring when he died in 1937 of nephritis. Several hundred people attended Grant&#x27;s funeral, and he was buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Tarrytown, New York. He left a bequest of $25,000 to the New York Zoological Society to create &quot;The Grant Endowment Fund for the Protection of Wild Life&quot;, $5,000 to the American Museum of Natural History, and another $5,000 to the Boone and Crockett Club. Relatives destroyed his personal papers and correspondence after his death.

At the postwar Nuremberg Trials, three pages of excerpts from Grant&#x27;s &quot;Passing of the Great Race&quot; were introduced into evidence by the defense of Karl Brandt, Hitler&#x27;s personal physician and head of the Nazi euthanasia program, in order to justify the population policies of the Third Reich, or at least indicate that they were not ideologically unique to Nazi Germany.

Grant&#x27;s works of scientific racism have been cited to demonstrate that many of the genocidal and eugenic ideas associated with the Third Reich did not arise specifically in Germany, and in fact that many of them had origins in other countries, including the United States. As such, because of Grant&#x27;s well-connected and influential friends, he is often used to illustrate the strain of race-based eugenic thinking in the United States, which had some influence until the Second World War. Because of the use made of Grant&#x27;s eugenics work by the policy-makers of Nazi Germany, his work as a conservationist has been somewhat ignored and obscured, as many organizations with which he was once associated (such as the Sierra Club) wanted to minimize their association with him. His racial theories, which were popularized in the 1920s, are today seen as discredited. The work of Franz Boas and his students, Ruth Benedict and Margaret Mead, demonstrated that there were no inferior or superior races.

On June 15, 2021, California State Parks removed a memorial to Madison Grant from Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park placed in the park in 1948. The monument&#x27;s removal is part of a broader effort in California Parks to address outdated exhibits and interpretations related to the founders of Save the Redwoods. In spring 2022, California State Parks will install a new interpretive panel, co-written with academic scholars, that tells a fuller story about Grant, his conservation legacy, and his central role in the eugenics movement.

<text>Cerioporus squamosus, synonym &quot;Polyporus squamosus&quot;, is a basidiomycete bracket fungus, with common names including dryad&#x27;s saddle and pheasant&#x27;s back mushroom. It has a widespread distribution, being found in North America, Eurasia, and Australia, where it causes a white rot in the heartwood of living and dead hardwood trees.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first described scientifically by British botanist William Hudson in 1778, who named it &quot;Boletus squamosus&quot;. It was given its current name in 1886 by Lucien Quélet but is still widely known by the Elias Magnus Fries name &quot;Polyporus squamosus&quot;.

=== Etymology ===
&quot;Squamosus&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;squamosus&quot; meaning covered with scales or scaly, referring to the signature dark brown scales found on the mushroom&#x27;s cap.

The name &quot;dryad&#x27;s saddle&quot; refers to creatures in Greek mythology called dryads who could conceivably sit and rest on this mushroom, whereas the &quot;pheasant&#x27;s back&quot; analogy derives from the pattern of colors on the bracket matching that of a pheasant&#x27;s back.

==Description==
Dryad&#x27;s saddle is an annual mushroom commonly found attached to dead logs and stumps or on living hardwood trees at one point with a thick stem. Generally, the fruit body is round and between across – exceptionally – and up to thick. The body can be yellow to brown and has &quot;squamules&quot; or scales on its upper side. On the underside one can see the pores that are characteristic of the genus &quot;Cerioporus&quot;; they are made up of tubes packed together closely. The tubes are between long. The stalk is long and thick. The mushroom&#x27;s smell resembles that of watermelon rind.

The fruit body produces a white spore print. The spores are 11–15 x 4–5 μm and are long and smooth ellipsoids. They can be found alone, in clusters of two or three, or forming shelves. Young specimens are soft but toughen with age. It is particularly common on dead elm and is also found on living maple trees.

=== Similar species ===
In &quot;Polyporus tuberaster&quot;, the cap is rounder and the stipe more central, with the scales only dark at the tip.

==Distribution and habitat==
This organism is common and widespread, being found east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States (April–October) and over much of Europe (July–November). It is also found in Asia and Australia. It commonly fruits in the spring, occasionally during autumn, and rarely during other seasons. Many mushroom hunters will stumble upon substantially sized mushroom this when looking for morels during the spring as both have similar fruiting times.

The species plays an important role in woodland ecosystems by decomposing wood, usually elm, silver maple, or box elder but is occasionally a parasite on living trees. Other tree hosts include ash, beech, horse chestnut, Persian walnut, lime, maple, planetree, poplar, magnolia, and willow.

==Uses==
The species is edible when young and cooked. Specimens can become infested with maggots and become firm, rubbery and inedible as they mature. Cookbooks dealing with preparation generally recommend gathering these while young, slicing them into small pieces and cooking them over a low heat.

Some people value the thick, stiff paper that can be made from this and many other mushrooms of the genus &quot;Cerioporus&quot;.

<text>Lahore Zoo (Punjabi: , ) in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan, established in 1872, is one of the largest zoos in Pakistan. It is currently managed by the Forest, Wildlife and Fisheries department of the Government of Pakistan. Today the zoo houses a collection of about 1378 animals of 135 species. Lahore Zoo was the host of the fifth annual conference of SAZARC in 2004.

Lahore Zoo is the third oldest zoo in the world. House of Vienna Zoo of Austria, established in 1752 as a menagerie, was opened to public as a zoo in 1779. London Zoo of England, established in 1828, was opened to public in 1847. The Alipore Zoo of India, established some time in the early 19th century, was opened to public as a zoo in 1876.

==History==

Lahore Zoo had its beginnings in a small aviary donated by Lala Mela Ram in 1872 to the Lahore Municipal Corporation. Over time the animal collection increased and the zoo expanded. It later began to take interest in conservation, education and research in addition to providing recreational facilities to the public. By 2010, the zoo was home to about 1280 trees of 71 species and 1380 animals of 136 species including 996 birds of 82 species, 49 reptiles of 8 and 336 mammals of 45 species.

The zoo was managed by the Lahore Municipal Corporation from 1872 to 1923, when management was turned over to the Deputy Commissioner of Lahore. Management was transferred to the Livestock and Dairy Development department in 1962, and then to the Wildlife and Parks department in 1982. Between its founding in 1872 and its turnover to the Wildlife and Parks department in 1982 there was very little development at the zoo. Since 1982, it has upgraded its exhibits, layout, and landscaping, and has become a self-financing organization.

An 18-month master planning, improvement and development project for the zoo was approved on July 25, 2005. It was carried out by &#x27;Zoo Maintenance Committee&#x27; and sponsored by Planning and Development Department of Government of Punjab. The project cost around 202.830 million Pakistani rupees and aimed for the improvement and addition of facilities.

In November 2023, the zoo closed temporarily for renovations. As part of the plan, the zoo will be revamped on the &quot;Singaporean style&quot; with glass cages being installed, the cages incorporating a naturally habitat of the animals, a hologram, and new arrivals including the Giant Panda. 

==Areas and attractions==

=== Fancy Birds Aviary ===
Located just east of the zoo&#x27;s main entrance, this is the oldest section of the zoo, as the zoo itself started out as an aviary in 1872. It is home to most of the zoo&#x27;s gamebirds and parrots. The area consists of four rows of double-sided bird cages housing peafowl, pheasants, partridges, western crowned pigeons and various species of parrots including macaws, grey parrots and conures, among others. Located at the eastern end of this section are a row of enclosures housing a pack of Asiatic jackals, juvenile spur-thighed tortoises and Asian houbara. Nearby is a small enclosure, once home to smooth-coated otters, housing Indian flapshell turtles and red-eared sliders, this enclosure also acts as temporary holding pen for the zoo&#x27;s juvenile mugger crocodiles.

=== Lion House ===
Originally constructed in 1872, the current Lion House complex, covering an area of 24,500 square feet was built in 1987 at a cost of 5.1 million rupees and was renovated in 2012. It comprises three concrete buildings with indoor cages and each building have two adjoining outdoor enclosures. The first of these buildings is home to the zoo&#x27;s Bengal tigers and pumas. Lahore Zoo currently has fifteen tigers and three pumas, most of which have been born at the zoo. The second building, consisting of three indoor compartments and two outdoor enclosures, houses the zoo&#x27;s lions. From the 2015 to 2016 13 lion cubs were born at the zoo, currently the zoo is home to more than 20 lions. The third, and final, building is home to the zoo&#x27;s family of black bears. The zoo&#x27;s resident black bear pair has given birth to two litters of two cubs, born in 2009 and 2011, all of which currently reside at the zoo. This is the only enclosure in the Lion House that does not have indoor viewing for visitors. However, the maintenance is poor and you will find Tiger in Lion’s cage and Lioness in Tiger’s cage.

=== Elephant House ===
Constructed in 1972 at a cost of 500,000 rupees, this is one of the most popular attractions of the zoo. It consists of three large indoor rooms each with adjoining outdoor paddocks. Originally housing three endangered pachyderm species native to Africa, The African bush elephant, the Southern white rhinoceros, and the hippopotamus, it currently houses a female hippo, Rani, that was brought to the zoo in July 2006 and a male white rhinoceros. The zoo&#x27;s only elephant, Suzi, which had been resident at the zoo since 1988 died in May, 2017, from several illnesses, leaving the zoo without an elephant. The zoo&#x27;s male hippo, Raja, was brought to the zoo in 1974 and at the time of his death, in October, 2015, was the oldest resident of the zoo, at 51. There had been attempts by the zoo administration to breed hippos but these had failed due to Raja&#x27;s old age. The zoo&#x27;s female white rhino, Kawo, died in 2014 on account of old age.

=== Monkey House ===
Constructed in 2012 over Lahore Zoo&#x27;s previous out of date monkey house, these four new enclosure are located just west of the zoo&#x27;s main entrance of main gate. The first enclosure houses the zoo&#x27;s olive baboon family, currently numbering around nine individuals. The next two enclosure houses a pair of tufted capuchins and mantled guerezas. The final enclosure is home to a family of vervet monkeys. Housed, in nearby enclosures, are the zoo&#x27;s family of porcupines, adult spur-thighed tortoises and a pair of smooth-coated otters. Species previously housed in the Monkey House include black-footed grey langurs, mandrills and spider monkeys.

=== Chimpanzee House ===
Home to the zoo&#x27;s chimpanzees, this building houses a wide array of other species including wolves, swamp cats and rhesus macaques. The zoo&#x27;s first pair of chimps, male Romeo and female Julie, had been brought in 1994. A male chimp, Tinku was born to the pair in 2000 but died due to pneumonia in September, 2004. In August, 2001, Julie gave birth to two female chimps, named Pinky and Honey. Romeo died, also of pneumonia, in 2008. Juliet succumbed to hepatitis in 2012 and Pinky died in 2014, leaving Honey the only chimpanzee left at the zoo. This building also acts as a temporary holding area for various species of cats, including leopards, lions and pumas. Species previously housed here include cheetahs and baboons.

=== Waterfowl Lake ===
Located south of the Fancy Aviary, this lake houses various species of waterfowl and wading birds. It consists of four islands with some of the oldest trees in the zoo. Located adjacent to the enclosure is a banyan tree that is reported to be over 400 years old. Species housed in this part of the zoo include black swans, Muscovy ducks, lesser flamingos and Dalmatian pelicans. Located nearby is a small enclosure housing a pair of wild boars.

=== Reptile House ===
This building houses most of the zoo&#x27;s reptiles, including Indian cobras, Sindh kraits, saw-scaled vipers and Indian pythons. The Reptile House was renovated in 2006, providing better ventilation to the exhibits and air conditioning for the animals. A small taxidermy museum, displaying various species of animals that previously lived at the zoo, is also present in the building. This visit is separately charged and the enclosures are in a dirty condition.

=== Walk-through Aviary ===
Located directly east of the Reptile House, the three-domed walk-through aviary is relatively new construction. Entry to the aviary is not included in general admission ticket of the zoo. Species housed in this enclosure include various species of pheasants, Indian peafowl and demoiselle cranes. As of 2015 the Walk-through Aviary was not open to the public.

=== Chimpanzee Island ===
This is a large moated enclosure located south of the waterfowl lake that was originally created to house the zoo&#x27;s chimpanzee, but because of deaths of all but one of the chimpanzees, this enclosure currently houses a pair of Himalayan brown bears.

=== Urial hillock ===
Located on west of, and right in front of the entrance to, the Reptile House, is a small naturally created hill that is home to urials and mouflons held in two separate enclosures.

=== Others ===
Other notable animals found at Lahore Zoo include giraffes, mugger crocodiles, blackbucks, nilgais, red deer, hog deer, guanacos, plains zebra, ostrich, emus and southern cassowary, vulturine guineafowl.

===Safari park===
Lahore Zoo Safari was opened on January 21, 2009, a renovation of &quot;Lahore Wildlife Park&quot; (also called Woodland Wildlife Park) which was established in 1982. The Safari Park is located near Raiwind Road about from the Lahore Zoo. The species housed here include Indian peafowl, Bengal tiger, common pheasant, emu, lion, mute swan, nilgai, ostrich and silver pheasant among a few others. The wildlife park is now considered to be an extension of Lahore Zoo.

The Government of Pakistan turned management of the wildlife park over to the &quot;Zoo Maintenance Committee&quot; headed by the chairman of the Punjab branch of the &quot;Wildlife &amp; Parks&quot; department. Vice-chairman Tauqeer Shah said this transfer of control was due to poor previous management that was not working to improve the park. A ticket system was introduced in the wildlife park so that the Lahore Zoo Safari could become a semi-autonomous, self-financed organization.

==Public service==
Instruction boards, maps and sign boards are placed around the zoo for guidance and education. The zoo includes a mosque for Muslim prayers. In 2008, walk ways, the cafeteria, and public washrooms were renovated and umbrella benches, drinking water coolers and new waste bins were added as part of some basic infrastructure updates.

===Recreation===
Camel rides and electronic kiddy rides are available for children. Lahore Zoo also has plenty of areas for visitors to picnic. A waterfall was created for visitors, and statues of various animals have been placed within the boundaries of the zoo.

===Education ===
The education officer of Lahore Zoo is Kiran Saleem. The zoo hosts guided tours for school groups, as well as placing information boards about the animals and plants around the zoo. A touch table has been set up to let children to touch animal parts like skins, horns, feathers and eggs that they cannot otherwise see or feel. The zoo has also prepared brochures and posters about endangered species in Pakistan like Ganges and Indus river dolphin.

On September 5, 2009, Lahore Zoo celebrated the &quot;International Vulture Awareness Day&quot; and distributed posters regarding the importance of vultures in ecosystems. Reasons of sharp decline of populations of Indian white-rumped vulture were made known to local people.

In 2010, Lahore Zoo celebrated events like World Environment Day on June 5 and World Animal Day on October 4. This particular and colorful event was organized by the students of Zoology department, University of the Punjab, Lahore. The students (BS.hons Batch 2010-14) participated actively to arrange for the event in the supervision of their course instructor, former Education officer of Lahore Zoo, Bushra Nisar Khan.

In November 2010, Lahore Zoo started its first publication, a quarterly newsletter. It is said to be the part of the education and awareness programme.

=== Research facilities ===
The Lahore Zoo, with the assistance of its education office in particular, provides research facilities and supports relevant studies at the zoo. Scores of students from University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences and University of the Punjab work in collaboration with Lahore Zoo to complete their research projects and internships. As a prime example, the zoo provided direct assistance to a research project with the kind approval of Director General Wildlife and Parks Department, Punjab. The study was conducted by a BS.Hons student of Department of Zoology, University of the Punjab. The researcher, Sana Ahmed, presented her synopsis as to study the public perception about the zoo and the role it plays to enhance the visitors&#x27; experience. The study included a survey from more than 200 zoo visitors, questioning them about different zoo facilities, animal species kept at zoo and about their experiences and suggestions. The study provided a useful insight to how visitors perceive the zoo. Likewise, it helped the zoo in shaping future strategies to design and launch interactive public awareness campaigns about ex-situ conservation. The research paper was presented in the National conference and training workshop of Wildlife and Aerobiology, held at University of the Punjab, Lahore. The researcher, first author of the paper (co-author of 3 other papers) got her paper publish in The Journal of Animal and Plant Sciences under the title, &quot;The Study of Public Perception for Captive Animals at Lahore Zoo, Pakistan.&quot;

===Gift shop===
In 2005, a gift shop was opened in joint collaboration between Pakistan branch of WWF and the Lahore Zoo. Ali Bokhari, the marketing head of WWF-Pakistan, stated that the profit earned would be split in half between the Lahore Zoo and WWF-Pakistan. Lahore Zoo would make souvenirs from the profit which would be on sale at the shop, while the WWF would invest it on the conservation of nature in Pakistan. The products include shirts, mugs, plush toys, posters, caps and bags among many others.

==Breeding efforts==
*Asian black bear: In September 2009, a rescued female was given to Lahore Zoo by World Wide Fund for Nature. Lahore Zoo was successful in breeding the species when twins were born in early January 2010. The cubs, however, went missing on 17 January.
*Chimpanzee: A pair (named &#x27;Romeo&#x27;, the male and &#x27;Juliet&#x27;, the female) were brought to the zoo in 1994. They gave birth to a male named &#x27;Tinku&#x27; in April 2000, another female named &#x27;Pinky&#x27; in 2004 and a female named &#x27;Honey&#x27; in April 2005. In October 2004, the Wildlife Department of Pakistan told the &quot;Daily Times&quot; that the four-year-old &#x27;Tinku&#x27; had died some time in early August from pneumonia. On September 17, 2008, Romeo died at the age of 21 from a prolonged illness.
*Hippopotamus: A six-year-old male hippopotamus was brought to the zoo on January 16, 1974. On July 11, 2006, zoo bought a six-year-old female to mate with the male that has been at the zoo for over three decades. An expert said that this was pointless because the male had passed its reproductive stage. Raja died on October 25, 2015. 
*Gharial: In November 2004, Lahore Zoo exchanged animals with Karachi Zoo including a male gharial. Lahore Zoo already had three female gharials and with a male, it could initiate a conservation attempt. The male was transported by truck to the zoo, but died the day after it was transferred. Currently there are only two female gharials at the zoo.
*Leopard: On 18 January 2006, zoo officials said that a seven-year-old female wild leopard was caught at Muree and brought to Lahore Zoo for breeding. However, it died about a month later on 21 February because of nervousness. On 5 April 2009, it was reported that 3 leopards (black panthers; one male and two female) purchased in February 2009 had to be returned because they had become sick. Currently Lahore Zoo houses only two leopards.

==Plans==
On December 8, 2010, it was announced that the administration of Lahore Zoo is planning to make Reema Khan, an actress, as the ambassador of wildlife in captivity. Current zoo director, Iqbal Khalid, told Dawn News that Khan will help create awareness among citizens about wildlife issues. It was also revealed, that Lahore Zoo will start renting exotic animals from other countries. This will give a chance to local people to learn more about different animals across the globe. Lahore Zoo plans to rent two giant pandas from People&#x27;s Republic of China. &quot;Once it gets a sponsor, the zoo administration will submit a request to the Chinese government for the animal, which is popular around the world. Chinese officials will visit the zoo to inspect housing and health facilities for pandas,&quot; said Khalid.

In September 2015, the Lahore Zoo administration announced plans to bring 19 new animals in order to maintain a healthy gene pool in the zoo. Zoo director Hassan Ali Sukhaira also stated that veterinary lab, with pathological and hematological labs, treatment rooms and an ICU, will be established at the zoo. The first of these new animals, a trio of giraffes, arrived at the zoo on 26 June 2018.

==Controversies==
The plight of captive animals at Lahore Zoo, has been subject to criticism by local animal rights activists.

===Safety and security concerns===
On 21 November 1999, an Asian black bear killed an 18-month-old boy named Abdullah in the zoo. The child, who was with his parents, tried to shake hands with the caged animal. The bear pulled the boy into the cage and tore him apart. An angry crowd tried to kill the animal but the police intervened to bring the situation under control. Zoo officials blamed the parents for allowing the boy to touch the animal. On 8 January 2004, an attendant at the zoo was attacked by a red fox when its cage was left unlocked, causing a panic among visitors. On 9 April 2007, two stray dogs entered an Indian peafowl pen from a broken portion of a fence and managed to kill about 28 peafowl. This resulted in criticism as Indian peafowl is considered sacred in Indian subcontinent. On 10 May 2009, it was reported that a new born macaw was stolen from the zoo. The zoo director said that someone from the zoo staff must have been responsible. On 17 January 2010, two Asian black bear cubs went missing from the zoo.

===Animal deaths===
Lahore Zoo has been criticized for not having the level of medical facilities expected in a modern zoo. Zoo officials reported in April 2005 that three female black-footed gray langurs died due to cold weather the previous winter. In November 2005, a male mandrill and male puma died at the zoo. A female Asian black bear died in mid-February 2006. In September 2006, some animals at the zoo were diagnosed with tuberculosis, which can also be transmitted to humans, but early detection and treatment prevented an outbreak. In January 2009, a female giraffe was attacked by a plains zebra and died soon after due to injuries.

In October 2004 the Wildlife Department of Pakistan told the Daily Times that a four-year-old male chimpanzee had died in early August from pneumonia, but zoo management had not revealed this news to public immediately. In September 2008, another male chimpanzee died at the age of 21 from a prolonged unidentified illness.

Lahore Zoo received a pair of Bengal tigers from Belgium in 1992 to start their captive breeding program. In 1997, six Bengal tigers died from &quot;Trypanosomiasis&quot; at the zoo, and in 2006, four more became victims. In July 2007, two female Bengal tigers, one of which had given the zoo 19 cubs, died from same disease. In early May 2009, a 3-year-old female Bengal tiger died after a cesarean section to take out her dead babies. In April 2009, a Bengal tiger gave birth to four In July 2009, a lioness gave birth to two cubs but killed them by eating their heads. Director, Zafar Shah, said that the lioness had been killing her cubs for the last three years and is a victim of &quot;cannibalism&quot; - a mental disease found in 5-6% of lions worldwide. At Lahore Zoo, there have been many births of Bengal tiger cubs who are deformed and do not survive long. In late 2010, the officials showed concern for the issue of inbreeding that might be the reason behind these deaths.

In early November 2010, Lahore Zoo received 53 falcons which were being illegally transported to Qatar from Benazir Bhutto International Airport. 16 falcons died due to heat strokes and other reasons. In April 2011, the zoo officials returned the remaining falcons to the wildlife department to be set free so that they can migrate to colder regions.

===Smuggling scandal===
On 27 March 2009, two white Bengal tigers were brought into Pakistan from Indonesia without necessary import documents and sold to the Lahore Zoo. The sources said that trans-boundary movement of the rare and endangered species was controlled by the CITES and that a certificate of permission from CITES and permission from the Islamabad-based &quot;National Council for Conservation of Wildlife&quot; (NCCW) were both required before import of the animals. Lahore Zoo had neither. The director of the zoo, Yusuf Paul said the zoo had purchased two female white Bengal tigers from supplier Mohammad Afzal of a Lahore-based organisation, &quot;Animal World&quot;, for 7.6 million Pakistani rupees.

<doc id="718146" wikidata="Q3302959" url="?curid=718146" title="Emma Vyssotsky">
<text>Emma Vyssotsky (October 23, 1894 – May 12, 1975, née Emma T. R. Williams) was an American astronomer who was honored with the Annie J. Cannon Award in Astronomy in 1946.

==Biography==
Emma earned her bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics at Swarthmore College in 1916 and worked at Smith College as an astronomy/mathematics demonstrator for a year before finding work at an insurance company as an actuary. In 1927, after receiving a Whitney Fellowship and a Bartol Scholarship, she enrolled in astronomy at Radcliffe College (now part of Harvard). There, she worked with Cecilia Payne on the &quot;spectral line contours of hydrogen and ionized calcium throughout the spectral sequence.&quot;

Emma received her PhD in astronomy from Harvard College in 1930 for her dissertation titled, &quot;A Spectrophotometric Study of A Stars&quot;. At the time, she was only the third individual to be awarded a PhD in astronomy from Harvard.

She followed her husband, astronomer Alexander N. Vyssotsky, to the University of Virginia, where he was offered a professorship; she was offered an instructor position. She spent her astronomy career at the McCormick Observatory at the university, where her specialty was the motion of stars and the kinematics of the Milky Way. The couple worked together. [They were] studying stellar parallaxes by applying trigonometric functions to observations made on multiple photographic exposures. They discovered many of these parallaxes by attaching a special objective prism to the observatory&#x27;s astrograph. Their research led to accurate calculations of stellar motions and the determination of the structure of galaxies.She worked at the observatory &quot;for more than a dozen years&quot; before the university promoted her to professor in 1945, but by then she had taken a medical leave of absence after contracting a debilitating illness, Malta Fever, which restricted her activities. Still, she continued to publish.

== Personal life ==
Emma Williams married the Russian-born astronomer Alexander N. Vyssotsky in 1929; they published jointly and worked together at the McCormick Observatory in Charlottesville, Virginia. They had one son, Victor A. Vyssotsky (a mathematician and computer scientist), who was involved in the Multics project and co-created the Darwin computer game.

Emma died in Winter Park, Florida two years after her husband&#x27;s death.

== Awards ==
In 1946, she was awarded the Annie J. Cannon Award in Astronomy by the American Astronomical Society in recognition of her contributions to the field of stellar spectra.

== Select publications ==
Emma published much of her research under the name E. T. Williams. The couple would alternate the lead author role on their joint papers, with her name appearing first sometimes, and his name appearing first at other times.

<text>Margaret Waters (1835–1870), otherwise known as Willis, was an English murderer hanged by executioner William Calcraft on 11 October 1870 at Horsemonger Lane Gaol (also known as Surrey County Gaol) in London.

Waters was born in 1835 and lived in Brixton. She was known for baby farming, the practice of taking in other women&#x27;s children for money, which often resulted in infanticide.

Waters drugged and starved the infants in her care and is believed to have killed at least 19 children. Charged with five counts of wilful murder as well as neglect and conspiracy, Waters was convicted of murdering an infant named John Walter Cowen. Her sister, Sarah Ellis, was convicted in the same case for obtaining money under false pretences and sentenced to eighteen months&#x27; hard labour.

<doc id="718168" wikidata="Q1709977" url="?curid=718168" title="Jovinian">
<text>Jovinian (; died c. 405) was an opponent of Christian asceticism in the 4th century and was condemned as a heretic at synods convened in Rome under Pope Siricius and in Milan by Ambrose in 393 because of his views. Our information about him is derived principally from the work of Jerome in two books, &quot;Adversus Jovinianum&quot;. Jerome referred to him as the &quot;Epicurus of Christianity&quot;. He was a native of Corduene, in present day Turkey. John Henry Newman called Aerius of Sebaste, Jovinian and Vigilantius the forerunners of Protestantism, likening them to the &quot;Luther, Calvin, and Zwingli of the fourth century&quot;. Other Protestants also praise Jovinian as an early reformer or even credit him as the &quot;first Protestant&quot;. Jovinian&#x27;s teachings received much popular support in Rome and Milan and his followers Sarmatio and Barbatianus kept preaching his ideas after Jovinian was expelled.

==Life==
Jovinian was a monk at one time in his life, but subsequently turned against monastic asceticism—though without giving up his status as monk. Jovinian was apparently broadly read and adduced examples from secular literature, which did not sit well at the synods. He became the leader of a group of disciples: Auxentius, Genialis, Germinator, Felix, Prontinus, Martianus, Januarius and Ingeniosus are identified in the act of 390 condemning him. His writings praising the excellence of marriage, which he published from Rome, were condemned at a synod held in Rome under Pope Siricius and subsequently at the Milan synod.

Jovinian, in the polemical view of his chief opponent, Jerome, has some of the style of an &quot;Epicurus of Christianity.&quot; The following is a passage attributed to Jovinian by Jerome in his &quot;Against Jovinian&quot;:
I respond to your invitation, not that I may go through life with a high reputation, but may live free from idle rumour. I beseech the ground, the young shoots of our plantations, the plants and trees of tenderness snatched from the whirlpool of vice, to grant me audience and the support of many listeners. We know that the Church through hope, faith, charity, is inaccessible and impregnable. In it no one is immature: all are apt to learn: none can force a way into it by violence, or deceive it by craft.
Nothing is known of the later career of Jovinian. From a remark in Jerome&#x27;s work &quot;Against Vigilantius&quot;, written in 409, that he &quot;amidst pheasants and pork rather belched out than breathed out his life&quot;, it is inferred by some (who assume Jerome to speak from authoritative knowledge and not merely in his usual highly rhetorical mode of vituperation) that he was then dead, and had not been made to suffer for his views too strenuously. In fact, penalties of quite a cruel nature were often meted out upon heretics during the reign of Theodosius I, and legal records at the time show that the Roman state did prescribe cruel punishments for him, including flogging and (supposing he survived) exile &quot;...to the Isle of Bua&quot; in the Adriatic Sea. It is worth noting in this regard that Augustine of Hippo, in a relatively recently discovered letter (10*), laments the use of the leaded thong on heretics, since, in the Saint&#x27;s words, &quot;...it so often leads to death.&quot;

Despite seeing marriage as an honorable state, Jovinian himself did not marry, so that he was not kept busy by the state of marriage.

==Teachings==
The writings of Jovinian were sent to Jerome by his friend Pammachius. Jerome replied to them in a long treatise in two books, written in 393. Many of Jovinian&#x27;s views could be considered contrary to ascetic ideals that were gaining prominence in the era, and would ultimately influence what constitutes Roman Catholic orthodoxy today.

He felt that virgins, widows and married women, even remarried widows, are of equal merit in the Christian community. Jovinian addressed his virginal reader:
I do you no wrong, Virgin: you have chosen a life of chastity on account of the present distress: you determined on the course in order to be holy in body and spirit: be not proud: you and your married sisters are members of the same Church…Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give my judgement, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. I think therefore that this is good by reason of the present distress, namely, that it is good for a man to be as he is… See, the Apostle confesses that as regards virgins he has no commandment of the Lord, and he who had with authority laid down the law respecting husbands and wives, does not dare to command what the Lord has not enjoined. And rightly too. For what is enjoined is commanded, what is commanded must be done, and that which must be done implies punishment if it be not done. For it is useless to order a thing to be done and yet leave the individual free to do it or not do it. If the Lord had commanded virginity He would have seemed to condemn marriage, and to do away with the seed-plot of mankind, of which virginity itself is a growth. If He had cut off the root, how was He to expect fruit If the foundations were not first laid, how was He to build the edifice, and put on the roof to cover all! Excavators toil hard to remove mountains; the bowels of the earth are pierced in the search for gold. And, when the tiny particles, first by the blast of the furnace, then by the hand of the cunning workman have been fashioned into an ornament, men do not call him blessed who has separated the gold from the dross but him who wears the beautiful gold. Do not marvel then if, placed as we are, amid temptations of the flesh and incentives to vice, the angelic life be not exacted of us, but merely recommended. If advice be given, a man is free to proffer obedience; if there be a command, he is a servant bound to compliance.
Jovinian also maintained that abstinence is no better than the partaking of food in the right disposition. Looking back into the creation, Jovinian stated that God gave dominion to humanity over the creation. After the great flood, God allowed humanity to take food not only from plants, but also from animals. St. Paul in the New Testament also teaches that all food is clean if they are eaten with thankfulness (Romans 14:20). Another point that Jovinian argues is, &quot;they who with full assurance of faith have been born again in baptism, cannot be overthrown by the devil.&quot; As Jerome critiques in his treatise, Jerome alters the word &quot;overthrown&quot; with &quot;tempted&quot;. This may show that either Jerome missed a point that Jovinian was making, as his argument on this point was much shorter. The word &quot;overthrow&quot; may have indicated much more significance than a believer committing sin since Jovinian believed that a believer was able to sin after the baptism. He wrote that if they do sin, they must repent. Rather, Jovinian seems to have been arguing that something significant occurs in the life of the believer when he or she is baptized, something that goes beyond peccability. This quote reveals a concern not simply over the presence of sin, but over the future state of believers. Jovinian evidently argued that baptism, administered “with full assurance of faith”, places believers in a state in which the blessings they experience as a result are not diminished by the presence of sin. 

In other words, Jovinian argued for what historian David Hunter called the final indefectibility of believers rather than their personal impeccability. Those who are baptized into the Church are in a permanent state of grace. Jovinian limited the impossibility of relapse to the truly regenerate, thus his teaching on perseverance has affinities with Augustine&#x27;s gift of perseverance and the Calvinist doctrine of perseverance of the saints. However Jovinian did not derive his view of eternal security from a doctrine of predestination, but instead from his denial of works having merit. 

The fourth proposition stated is, &quot;there is one reward in the kingdom of heaven for all who have kept their baptismal vow.&quot; Referencing Matthew 25:31-46 about sheep and goats, the judgment of humanity through the flood, and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Jovinian stated, “There is one salvation for those who are released, one destruction for those who stay behind”. Jovinian rejected the idea that believers should be divided into classes, some more spiritual than others, because the New Testament repeatedly emphasizes that all believers partake of the body and blood of Christ (John 6:56), that the Holy Spirit indwells all believers (1 Cor 6:19), and that the Church itself is one. For these reasons, the common teaching that an ascetic lifestyle produces greater reward should be rejected. All believers possess the presence of Christ and are part of the same body. Therefore, all experience the same reward. 

Many scholars have argued that for Jovinian, works did not justify a man, thus holding to a Protestant view of justification, which is by faith alone. It has been argued that Jovinian believed in a distinction between the visible and invisible churches, based on his statement that the Church is founded on faith, and that all in the Church are taught by God and that no &quot;unripe&quot; members exist within the Church and no one can enter the church &quot;by fraud&quot;.

Jovinian distinguished physical baptism and baptism of the Holy Spirit, which confers grace to the believer.

From a letter of the synod at Milan to Pope Siricius (Ambrose, &quot;Epistle&quot; xlii) and from Augustine&#x27;s book &quot;Contra Julian&quot; ii, it is clear that Jovinian also denied the perpetual virginity of Mary.

The counter of Jerome to this &quot;Epicurus of Christianity&quot; took a whole book to praise virginity and disparage the state of marriage, based upon Paul&#x27;s remarks in &quot;1 Corinthians&quot; 7. The work was couched in abusive and intemperate language that appalled Pammachius, who found it excessive in its praise of virginity and in depreciation of marriage. Jerome did not approve of democratic distribution of bliss in the life to come:
Perhaps those who have been married twice or thrice ought not to complain, for the same whoremonger if penitent is made equal in the kingdom of heaven even to virgins.
Efforts to suppress it failed, however, and Jerome&#x27;s work obtained a wide circulation.

Geoffrey Chaucer mentions Jovinian with scorn in the &quot;Summoner&#x27;s Tale&quot; of his &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, lines 221-3:
...lyke Iouinian&lt;br&gt;
Fat as a whale and walkynge as a swan&lt;br&gt;
As vinolent as botel in the spence&lt;br&gt;
== Reaction ==
After Jovinian attacked monasticism, Jerome attacked him harshly. Jerome gives a very bad picture of the character of Jovinian, clearly colored by bitterness. Jerome called Jovinian a servant of corruption, barbarous writer, while Augustine was more lenient, despite disagreeing with some views of Jovinian. Pope Siricius later excommunicated Jovinian and his followers, because he was zealously opposed to any marriage of clergy. Jovinian was also condemned by Ambrose, in the same fashion as Siricius, because of his high views on marriage.

Later in the Protestant reformation, Jovinian has been seen as a &quot;witness of truth&quot;, while he is most often seen as a heretic by Catholics.

<doc id="718175" wikidata="Q2352902" url="?curid=718175" title="M-34 (Michigan highway)">
<text>M-34 is an east–west state trunkline highway in the southeastern region of the US state of Michigan. It has a western terminus near Osseo on M-99 and runs through forest and farm lands to its eastern terminus at Business US Highway 223 (BUS US 223) and M-52 in Adrian. The highway serves a number of smaller communities in the area and intersects two US Highways while carrying between 4,200 and 11,300 vehicles on a daily basis.

M-34 was designated and signed with the beginning of the state highway system around July 1, 1919, along a route that extended to either end of its current routing. These western and eastern extensions were added to other highways during the 1920s, shortening M-34 to roughly its current length. A few more changes were made in the mid-1950s and 1960s resulting in the modern routing. M-34 has a short, unsigned sibling, Connector 34, which is better known as Industrial Drive in the Adrian area.

==Route description==

M-34 begins at an intersection with M-99 just west of Osseo. M-99 approaches Osseo from the west along Hudson Road and where M-99 turns south along Pioneer Road, M-34 continues east along Hudson Road. The highway turns to the southeast to the south of Osseo near Deer Lake and continues towards Pittsford. Hudson Road runs through a mix of forests and local farms. The trunkline passes to the south of the main business district in Pittsford. East of town, the highway turns east and intersects US Highway 127 (US 127) at the Hillsdale–Lenawee county line in Hudson. The trunkline continues eastward through the city of Hudson as Main Street. On the eastern edge of town, it becomes Carleton Road and passes through more farmland. Just south of Clayton, M-34 has a junction with the northern terminus of M-156, a connector highway that runs south into Ohio and US 20.

Approximately four miles (6.4 km) east of that junction, M-34 turns north for about two miles (3.2 km) along Benner Highway and passes through the community of Cadmus. At the end of its course along Benner Highway, M-34 turns east towards Adrian on Beecher Road. There are some residential subdivisions along the road on the southwest side of Adrian. M-34 intersects Industrial Drive and crosses US 223 and Beecher Road becomes Beecher Street in town. The trunkline continues east and terminates at the intersection of Beecher and Main streets where it meets BUS US 223/M-52.
M-34 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT&#x27;s surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-34 were the 11,302 vehicles daily immediately east of the BUS US 223/M-52 junction in Adrian; the lowest counts were the 4,166 vehicles per day between Hudson and the M-156 junction. No section of M-34 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.

==History==
When the state highway system was signed around July 1, 1919, M-34 started in Jonesville at an intersection with M-23 along the present-day alignment of M-99. The highway ran to Adrian along its present route and continued southeasterly along present-day US 223 through Blissfield, where it terminated at the Ohio state line near Sylvania, Ohio. In 1924, the western terminus of the highway was extended to Homer where it terminated at M-60. Just a few years later, in 1926, the western terminus was truncated, to end at Hillsdale, with the remainder to Jonesville becoming an extension of the M-64 of the day. At the same time, the eastern segment of M-34 from Adrian to the border was assumed into the US 127 corridor, therefore, scaling the terminus back to US 127 (now US 223).
In 1954, a new US 223 bypass was built around Adrian, resulting in the relocation of M-34 to end at BUS US 223/M-52. Finally, in 1966, when a new alignment of M-99 highway was opened, the western terminus of M-34 was scaled back to end at the new highway near Osseo. In 2003, the short connector between M-34 and US 223 was abandoned and obliterated. Industrial Drive, which is known internally at MDOT as Connector 34, is a new connector between the two highways that was assumed into the state trunkline system at the same time.

<doc id="718177" wikidata="Q3566301" url="?curid=718177" title="Minot International Airport">
<text>Minot International Airport is in Ward County, North Dakota, United States, two miles north of the city of Minot, which owns it. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a &quot;primary commercial service&quot; airport.

MOT currently handles between ten and fifteen commercial flights a day from three airlines, as well as various charters and general aviation traffic. For many years Northwest Airlines, followed by successor Delta Air Lines, was the airport&#x27;s sole commercial carrier but an economic and population boom have resulted in other carriers adding flights as well. Delta Connection, United Express, and Allegiant Air currently offer flights to Minneapolis, Denver, Phoenix/Mesa, and Las Vegas, respectively.

Minot International has no scheduled passenger airline service out of the country, but receives its international title (like many other airports) because of its customs service. Customs service is available for aircraft arriving from Canada and other countries. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) fully searches all passengers and carry-on luggage prior to boarding, rather than using a selective process as is the case at major airports.

Delta Air Lines commands the largest percentage of MOT travelers and operates up to six daily flights to Minneapolis, all on Delta Connection.

United Airlines became Minot&#x27;s second largest airline in 2010 and currently operates four daily flights to Denver. Allegiant Air became the airport&#x27;s third airline in 2010, with flights to Las Vegas, then added service to Phoenix-Mesa. The number of flights to each destination fluctuates.

Frontier Airlines became the airport&#x27;s fourth airline in 2012 with four flights per week to Denver. Though passenger loads were high, Frontier discontinued service from Minot in 2015 due to restructuring of The original Frontier Airlines served Minot on a route that connected it with Saskatoon, Regina, and Denver (Stapleton); bankruptcy halted that airline&#x27;s operations in 1986.

==Facilities==
The airport covers at an elevation of above sea level. It has two runways: 13/31 is feet concrete and 8/26 is asphalt. Its longest runway can receive Boeing 747s.

In the year ending March 30, 2023, the airport had 33,020 aircraft operations, average 90 per day: 73% general aviation, 6% airline, 6% military, and 15% air taxi. 128 aircraft were then based at this airport: 119 single-engine, 6 multi-engine, 1 jet, and 2 helicopter.

In 2013, aircraft operations dropped to 32,023 for the fiscal year. Itinerant general aviation operations is still the highest percentage of operations with 10,429. Air carrier is at 6,825 and air taxi is at 5,201. Finally, for itinerant operations, military made up 283. Local operations include 6,898 civil and 2,387 military operations. Based aircraft has dropped to 112 housed aircraft.

Avflight is the fixed-base operator at the airport, offering a 24 hour fueling station for quick turns and efficient technology stops. Other services include catering, Customs, international garbage disposal, and rental cars.

Minot Aero Center is a maintenance business at the airport, offering flight training, maintenance, and general aircraft services.

==Historical airline service==
Braniff Airways started service in 1952 with one daily departure south to Bismarck with DC-3 equipment. The original Frontier Airlines started new service on May 1, 1959, with three daily departures to Bismarck on 26 passenger DC-3s. North Central Airlines had four daily departures in July 1960 on DC-3 equipment; the service went to Bismarck and Devils Lake, east of Minot. North Central became Republic in 1979, Northwest in 1986, and Delta in 2010.

==Growth and future==
Minot&#x27;s growth in population and economy, along with the enormous influx of workers and residents due to the Bakken oil boom in western North Dakota, have increased air passenger numbers tremendously. Though Minot is the fourth largest city in North Dakota, the airport is now the third-busiest. Located at the southwest corner of the property, the early 1990s terminal was designed for roughly 100,000 passengers, and became undersized after just two decades. This resulted in makeshift changes such as temporary long term parking, additional hold-room areas, and other similar measures.

Minot&#x27;s forecasted growth over the next twenty years warranted a study to identify alternatives to deal with that growth, and the best option was a new terminal directly east of the 1991 terminal; its predecessor was on the west side of the property, near 24th Avenue NW and just east of North Broadway (US 83). Design of the current terminal building was completed in May 2013, and included four to six gates, room for up to four car rental companies, additional restaurant space, additional check in areas for future new airlines, and greatly expanded parking facilities for short term, long term, and rental car parking.

Growing passenger numbers, parking issues, and the possibilities of new airlines and destinations made a new terminal at Minot International Airport a top priority. The projected $40 million terminal joined a list of other major improvements over the next three years which include additional apron, a new taxiway, a new Snow Removal Equipment building, additional parking and a new access road, with total investment around $98 million to cope with increased traffic.

Four times the size of its predecessor, the new terminal opened on The old terminal building was demolished that November, after the city voted to demolish the structure after the new terminal was completed. There is no definite plan for the area after the demolition, but the city is considering a car rental facility as a frontrunner to be built in the old terminal&#x27;s place.

==Ground Transportation==
Minot City Transit buses do not directly serve the terminal, however, buses do travel along 3rd Street Northeast and Airport Road, where passengers may flag down any bus at an intersection.

<text>Leonard Eugene Alley (born July 10, 1940) is an American former professional baseball player. He played his entire career in Major League Baseball as a shortstop for the Pittsburgh Pirates from through . A two-time All-Star player, Alley was a member of Pirates teams that won three consecutive National League Eastern Division titles between and , and won the World Series in .

== Early life ==
Alley was born on July 10, 1940, in Richmond, Virginia. While still an infant, Alley&#x27;s father died in a car accident, and he and his three siblings were raised by his mother. He attended Hermitage High School in Henrico, Virginia. Alley had hoped to receive a basketball scholarship to attend the University of Virginia, but the sum offered was insufficient. Instead, the 18-year old Alley signed to play baseball with the Pittsburgh Pirates.

== Professional baseball ==
Alley was a modest hitter, with some strong years, but an exceptionally steady shortstop with good range and an accurate throwing arm.

=== Minor leagues ===
In 1959, the Pirates assigned Alley to the Dubuque Packers of the Class-D Midwest League. He had a .287 batting average (his highest in the minor leagues) with 15 home runs, and a .922 fielding percentage at shortstop, his principal position with Dubuque. Because of pain in his throwing arm, he did not continue at shortstop for the next three years. 

He continued in the Pirates minor league system until 1963, playing third base in 1960 (.932 fielding percentage), and second base in 1961 (.933 fielding percentage) and 1962 (.969 combined fielding percentage between Single-A and Triple-A baseball). Finally, in 1963, he played a full year of Triple-A baseball for the Columbus Jets of the International League at shortstop, with a .963 fielding percentage, a .244 batting average, 19 home runs, 61 runs batted in (RBI) and 76 runs scored.

=== Pittsburgh Pirates ===
Alley played briefly for the Pirates at the end of the 1963 season, and then played in 81 games for the Pirates in 1964, hitting only .211, but with a fielding percentage at shortstop of .966 in 61 games at that position. He was a frequent backup to starting shortstop Ducky Schofield.

In 1965, he started 40 games at second base for the injured Bill Mazeroski, and then 102 games at shortstop after Mazeroski&#x27;s return. He had a .968 fielding percentage at shortstop and .974 at second base. He hit .252, with five home runs, 47 runs and 47 RBI. He was fourth in the NL in fielding percentage by a shortstop.

1966 was his first full year at shortstop. He had a .979 fielding percentage (second in the league behind Chico Cardénas&#x27; .980), and led all National League shortstops in turning double plays with 128. He received the Gold Glove Award for NL shortstops. In the same year, Mazeroski set the all-time double play record for second basemen in a season with 161. The Pirates as a team turned 215 double plays, the second most in baseball history after the record 217 set by the 1949 Philadelphia Athletics (as of 2023). Alley also hit for a career high .299 batting average, had a career high with 88 runs scored, and his 20 sacrifice hits were second in the NL.

In 1967, Alley led the league&#x27;s shortstops again in double plays with 105, as well as leading the league&#x27;s shortstops in putouts (257) and was second in assists (500). He was fifth in fielding percentage. He again won the Gold Glove Award. He was also selected to the NL All-Star team for the first time. He batted .287, and had a career high 55 RBI.

Alley made the NL All-Star a second time in 1968. From 1965 to 1968 he was in the top four NL players in assists. In 1966 and 1967, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; named him to its All-Star Team. Alley and Mazeroski both received Gold Glove Awards in 1966 and 1967, along with their teammate Roberto Clemente. They also joined a select list of eight shortstop-second baseman duos to each win a Gold Glove the same season more than once while playing together.

Alley was on Pirates teams that won their division in 1970 through 1972, and had the NL&#x27;s best record in 1971 and 1972. They lost in the NL championship series to the Cincinnati Reds twice (1970, 1972), but defeated the San Francisco Giants in 1971, and went on to win the World Series against the Baltimore Orioles (Alley only appearing in one playoff game and two games of the World Series, having suffered a knee injury).

Shoulder and knee problems ultimately ended Alley&#x27;s career early. Alley developed a sore throwing arm shortly before the 1967 All-Star Game that never fully healed. In 1969, he played only 82 games and was on the disabled list for 29 days, though he still had a .977 fielding percentage and 21-game hitting streak. He originally injured his knee in 1969 when he suffered a collision on a play while covering first base in a game against the Houston Astros, leading to multiple surgeries. A knee injury suffered late in the 1971 season subsequently required surgery, and limited his participation in the 1971 postseason playoffs and World Series.

On September 2, 1970, Alley hit an inside-the-park grand slam at Jarry Park Stadium in Montreal, against the Montreal Expos. With the bases loaded, facing Carl Morton, Alley hit a line drive which landed in front of center fielder Boots Day, who slipped on the wet grass. The ball rolled all the way to the wall in deepest center field, and all the baserunners and Alley scored.

1973 was his final year, appearing in 76 games altogether, and 56 in the field at either shortstop or third base.

== Post-baseball life ==
Alley worked for a printing company in Richmond after his retirement from baseball.

In 1998, Alley was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame. In 2013, he received the Paul Keyes RBI (Richmond Baseball Impact) Award, given annually to a person making a significant contribution to baseball within or around the Richmond community.

<doc id="718196" wikidata="Q148726" url="?curid=718196" title="Albert Pujols">
<text>José Alberto Pujols Alcántara (, ; born January 16, 1980) is a Dominican professional baseball manager and former first baseman and designated hitter who is the manager of the Leones del Escogido of the Dominican Professional Baseball League. He played 22 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Cardinals, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim / Los Angeles Angels, and Los Angeles Dodgers. Nicknamed &quot;the Machine&quot; (Spanish: &quot;La Máquina&quot;), Pujols is considered to be one of the greatest baseball players of all time.

Pujols is a highly regarded hitter who has long shown a &quot;combination of contact hitting ability, patience and raw power.&quot; He was the National League (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) in , , and and is an 11-time All-Star (2001, 2003–2010, 2015, 2022). He is a six-time Silver Slugger who has twice led the NL in home runs, and he has also led the NL once each in batting average, doubles, and runs batted in (RBIs). In 2018, Pujols collected his 3,000th career hit, becoming the 32nd MLB player to reach that milestone. During the 2022 season, Pujols returned to the Cardinals and moved into second place all-time for career RBIs and total bases and became the fourth player with 700 career home runs. At the end of the season, he was also the major league career leader in double plays grounded into (426), 3rd in sacrifice flies (123), 5th in games played (3,080) and doubles (686), and 6th in at bats (11,421). He won two Gold Glove awards at first base in his career.

==Early life==
Pujols was born and raised in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, mostly by his grandmother, America Pujols, and 10 of his uncles and aunts. He is an only child. His father, Bienvenido Pujols, was a softball pitcher who struggled with alcoholism. Pujols often had to take his father home when his father got drunk following games. Growing up, Pujols practiced baseball using limes for balls and a milk carton for a glove. Pujols, his father, and his grandmother immigrated in 1996 to Washington Heights in New York City, where Pujols witnessed a shooting at a bodega. Partly because of the shooting, they moved two months later to Independence, Missouri, to join some relatives.

Pujols played baseball at Fort Osage High School in Independence and was named an All-State athlete twice. As a senior, he was walked 55 times intentionally, but he still hit eight home runs in 33 at-bats. One of his home runs travelled .

==College career==
After graduating from high school a semester early in December 1998, he was given a baseball scholarship to Maple Woods Community College. Pujols hit a grand slam and turned an unassisted triple play in the first game of his only college season. Playing shortstop, he batted .461 with 22 home runs as a freshman before deciding to enter the Major League Baseball (MLB) draft.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
Few teams were interested in Pujols because of uncertainty about his age, which position he would play, and his build. Tampa Bay Rays scout Fernando Arango recommended that his team sign Pujols, and quit his job when Tampa Bay failed to do so. Pujols was not drafted until the 13th round of the 1999 Major League Baseball (MLB) draft, when the St. Louis Cardinals selected him with the 402nd overall pick. Pujols initially turned down a $10,000 bonus and spent the summer playing for the Hays Larks of the Jayhawk Collegiate League (a summer league in the National Baseball Congress). When the Cardinals increased their bonus offer to $60,000, he signed.

Pujols began his minor league career in 2000 playing third base with the Peoria Chiefs of the single-A Midwest League. He batted .324 with 128 hits, 32 doubles, six triples, 17 home runs and 84 RBI, in 109 games. He was voted the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player and named to the All-Star team. Pujols also played 21 games with the Potomac Cannons in the high-A Carolina League that year, batting .284 with 23 hits, eight doubles, one triple, two home runs and 10 RBI. He finished the 2000 season with the Memphis Redbirds in the AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL), and after appearing in three regular season games with them, he batted .367 in the playoffs and was named the postseason Most Valuable Player (MVP) as the Redbirds won their first PCL title.

===St. Louis Cardinals (2001–2011)===
====Early career (2001–2003)====
During spring training in 2001, incumbent first baseman Mark McGwire told Cardinals manager Tony La Russa that if he did not promote Pujols to the major league roster, &quot;it might be one of the worst moves you make in your career.&quot; La Russa later recounted the &quot;myth&quot; that Pujols only made the Opening Day roster in 2001 because Bobby Bonilla was injured. According to La Russa, he and the rest of Cardinals management were impressed enough by Pujols that they decided to promote him to the big league club even before Bonilla&#x27;s injury. Cardinals executive John Vuch backed this up, calling the link between Pujols and Bonilla an &quot;old wives&#x27; tale&quot; and stating that the competition for the last roster spot was actually between Bonilla and John Mabry. Although the team did not require Pujols to fill any particular position, the Cardinals activated him to the Opening Day roster, and he started all season at third base, right field, left field, or first base.

On Opening Day against the Colorado Rockies on April 2, Pujols became the first major league player born in the 1980s. In that game, he recorded his first career hit, a single against pitcher Mike Hampton in an 8–0 loss. Four days later, he had three hits and three RBI — including his first home run — against the Arizona Diamondbacks&#x27; Armando Reynoso in a 12–9 win. On April 9, in his first career home game, Pujols hit a two-run home run in his first at bat against Denny Neagle of Colorado. Through 2015, he was one of three players to hit 20 or more home runs in their rookie year before July, along with Wally Berger (1930) and Joc Pederson (2015). At midseason, Pujols became the first Cardinals rookie since Luis Arroyo in 1955 to make the All-Star Game. He finished the season batting .329 (sixth in the league) with 194 hits (fifth in the league), 47 doubles (fifth in the league), 37 home runs, and 112 runs. His 37 home runs led the Cardinals, topping Jim Edmonds&#x27; 30 and McGwire&#x27;s 29. He was named the National League (NL) Silver Slugger Award winner for the third base position, and he finished fourth in NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting, behind Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa and Luis Gonzalez. He was unanimously named the NL Rookie of the Year after setting an NL rookie record with 130 RBI&#x27;s (fifth in the league) and becoming the fourth MLB rookie to hit .300 with 30 home runs, 100 runs, and 100 RBI&#x27;s.

The Cardinals finished the 2001 season with a 93–69 record and advanced to the playoffs as the National League wild card team. The team advanced to the NL Division Series (NLDS). In Game 2 on October 10, Pujols hit a game-winning two-run home run against Diamondbacks pitcher Randy Johnson in a 4–1 victory. The Cardinals, however, were eliminated in five games, and Pujols had just two hits in 18 at-bats.

After playing several positions in 2001, Pujols spent most of 2002 in left field. He began the season batting cleanup but was moved in May to the third spot in the lineup, where he remained for the rest of his Cardinals career. Pujols hit his 30th home run and 100th RBI of the season in a 5–4 loss to the Cincinnati Reds in August, making him the sixth Cardinal to have back-to-back 30-home-run seasons and the second Cardinal (the other was Ray Jablonski) to start his career with back-to-back 100-RBI seasons. The following month, Pujols hit a game-winning two-run single against Pete Munro in a 9–3 victory over the Houston Astros that gave the Cardinals the NL Central title. Pujols finished the year batting .314 (seventh in the NL) with 185 hits (tied for fourth in the NL), 40 doubles (eighth in the NL), 34 home runs (10th in the NL), 118 runs scored (second in the NL to Sosa&#x27;s 122), and 127 RBI&#x27;s (second in the NL). He became the first player in major league history to hit over .300 with at least 30 home runs, 100 runs scored, and 100 RBI in his first two seasons. Pujols finished second in MVP voting to Bonds, becoming the first Cardinal since Stan Musial to finish in the top four in MVP voting for consecutive seasons. At the end of the 2002 season, Chris Haft of &quot;MLB.com&quot; called him &quot;an outstanding hitter.&quot;

Pujols&#x27; contributions helped the Cardinals finish third in home runs and second in batting average and RBI; the Cardinals&#x27; pitching staff also finished fourth in ERA. The Cardinals again reached the playoffs, and Pujols had three hits and three RBI in a three-game sweep of the Diamondbacks in the 2002 NLDS. The team advanced to the 2002 NL Championship Series (NLCS), but lost in five games to the San Francisco Giants. Pujols had five hits, one home run and two RBI in the series.

Five Cardinals were named to the All-Star Game in 2003 while Pujols led the NL in votes. It was the first of eight straight seasons that Pujols would reach the All-Star Game. From July 12 to August 16, Pujols had a 30-game hitting streak, tied for the second-longest in Cardinals&#x27; history with Musial and behind only Rogers Hornsby&#x27;s 33-game streak. On July 20, Pujols hit his 100th career home run, a game-winner in a 10–7 victory over the Dodgers. He became the fourth major leaguer to hit his 100th home run in his third season, along with Ralph Kiner, Eddie Mathews and Joe DiMaggio. Pujols hit his 114th home run on September 20 in a game against the Astros, which tied him with Kiner for the most home runs by a player in his first three seasons.

In 157 games, Pujols hit 43 home runs (fourth in the league, behind Jim Thome, Richie Sexson and Bonds) and had 124 RBI&#x27;s (tied with Sexson for fourth and behind Preston Wilson, Gary Sheffield and Thome). He became the youngest player since Tommy Davis in 1962 to win the NL batting title after batting .359, and he led the league in runs (137), hits (212), and doubles (51). Pujols joined Rogers Hornsby as the only players in the Cardinals&#x27; history to record more than 40 homers and 200 hits in the same season. Though his stellar play had Cardinals&#x27; fans chanting &quot;M-V-P!&quot; during home games as early as June, Pujols again finished second to Bonds in MVP voting. He won his second Silver Slugger Award and first &quot;Sporting News&quot; Player of the Year Award. Pujols&#x27; contributions helped the Cardinals rank second in batting average and third in home runs in the NL; however, the pitching staff posted a 4.60 ERA, which was below the league average, and the Cardinals missed the playoffs.

====New contract (2004–2005)====
After receiving many awards in his first three seasons, Pujols was rewarded monetarily for his accomplishments on February 20, 2004, when he signed a seven-year, $100 million contract extension with a $16 million club option for 2011 with no-trade provisions. He was moved to first base in 2004 after the Cardinals traded Tino Martinez in the offseason. On June 16, he hit a walk-off home run against Reds pitcher Mike Matthews in the 10th inning of a 4–3 victory.

Pujols&#x27; highlights later in the season included a July game in which he hit five RBI and three home runs in a thrilling win over the rival Chicago Cubs, and another in which he broke up a no-hitter by Giants pitcher Dustin Hermanson. During a September game against the Rockies, he earned his 500th RBI, joining Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams as the only players to have 500 RBI in their first four seasons. He said he was confident there was going to be &quot;a lot more.&quot; Although Pujols was diagnosed with plantar fasciitis during the second half of the season, he finished the season with a .331 average (fifth in the league), 196 hits (fifth), 51 doubles (second to Lyle Overbay&#x27;s 53), 46 home runs (tied with Adam Dunn for second behind Adrián Beltré&#x27;s 48), and 123 RBIs (third, behind Vinny Castilla&#x27;s 131 and Scott Rolen&#x27;s 124) in 154 games. He also led the league with 133 runs scored. On defense, he tied for the league lead in errors by a first baseman, with 14. He finished third in MVP voting (behind Bonds and Beltré), joining Musial as the only Cardinals to finish in the top five in voting for at least four years in a row. He won the Silver Slugger Award at first base, the third position he won the award at. Pujols, along with teammates Edmonds and Rolen, earned the nickname &quot;MV3&quot; for their phenomenal seasons; Pujols led the three in home runs and batting average.

The Cardinals won the NL Central, aided by pitcher Chris Carpenter, who won 15 games and had a 3.46 ERA his first season with the team en route to winning the National League Comeback Player of the Year Award. In Game 4 of the NLDS against the Dodgers, Pujols hit a three-run home run against Wilson Álvarez and had four RBI as the Cardinals won, 6–2, and took the series three games to one. In Game 6 of the NLCS, Pujols had three hits, scored three runs (including the winning run), and hit a two-run home run off Munro in a 12-inning, 6–4 victory. The Cardinals won the series in seven games, advancing to the World Series for the first time since 1987. Pujols was named the NLCS MVP after batting .500 with four home runs and nine RBI. He was one of three Cardinals batters hit over .250 in the series against the Boston Red Sox, batting .333 as the Cardinals were swept by Boston in four games.

By 2005, many baseball fans thought that Pujols was the best Cardinal since Musial. Pujols picked up his 100th RBI of the season on August 31, joining Williams, DiMaggio and Al Simmons as the only players with 100 RBI in their first five seasons. Pujols hit his 200th career home run in a game against the Reds on September 30, making him the third-youngest major league player to reach that milestone (behind Mel Ott and Eddie Mathews) and the second-fastest to reach it (behind Kiner). In 161 games, Pujols batted .330 (second to Derrek Lee&#x27;s .335 average) with 195 hits (fourth behind Lee, Miguel Cabrera and Jimmy Rollins), 38 doubles, 41 home runs (third, behind Andruw Jones&#x27; 51 and Lee&#x27;s 46), 117 RBI&#x27;s (tied with Burrell for second behind Jones&#x27; 128), and 129 runs scored (first in the league). For the first time in his career, he won the NL MVP award as Bonds was limited to 14 games due to an injury.

Pujols returned to the playoffs as the Cardinals won the NL Central for the second year in a row. He had five hits in nine at-bats with four runs scored and two RBI in the NLDS as the Cardinals swept the Padres. In Game 5 of the NLCS against the Astros, with the Cardinals trailing by two runs and only one out from elimination in the ninth inning, Pujols hit a game-winning three-run home run against Brad Lidge that landed on the train tracks in the back of Minute Maid Park. The Cardinals won 5–4. &quot;MLB.com&quot; writer Matthew Leach later called it &quot;one of the most famous playoff home runs in recent years.&quot; Nevertheless, the Cardinals were eliminated in Game 6 by the Astros. Pujols batted .304 with two home runs and six RBI in the series.

====Continued success and first World Series (2006–2008)====
Over two games in April 2006, Pujols hit home runs in four consecutive plate appearances, making him the 20th player to accomplish the feat. Pujols maintained after the game that he was more concerned with winning than the numbers: &quot;I don&#x27;t look at numbers,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&#x27;t know. I didn&#x27;t know anything about [the record] until you guys brought it up. Because that&#x27;s not me. I don&#x27;t get locked in on numbers. I don&#x27;t get locked in on anything like that. I get locked in on seeing the ball and helping my team out to win and hopefully doing some damage out there.&quot; Pujols had three hits and four RBI, including his 1,000th career hit (a home run against Jerome Williams), as the Cardinals defeated the Cubs 9–3 on April 21, 2006. On June 4, he was placed on the disabled list (DL) for the first time in his career with a strained right oblique that kept him out for three weeks. On August 22, Pujols hit a three-run home run and a grand slam against John Maine in an 8–7 loss to the Mets. On September 28, with the Cardinals trailing the Padres 2–1 in the eighth inning, he hit a three-run home run against Cla Meredith, helping the Cardinals win 4–2 and end a seven-game losing streak. The win preserved the Cardinals&#x27; 1.5-game division lead; La Russa later called it &quot;the most huge of the huge ones he&#x27;s hit.&quot;
Pujols finished the season with a .331 average (third to Freddy Sanchez&#x27;s .344 and Cabrera&#x27;s .339), 177 hits, 33 doubles, 49 home runs (second to Ryan Howard&#x27;s 58), 137 RBI (second to Howard, 149) and 119 runs scored (tied with Matt Holliday, Hanley Ramírez, and Alfonso Soriano for fifth). Of his 49 home runs, 20 produced a game-winning RBI, breaking Willie Mays&#x27; single-season record set in 1962. He finished second to Howard in MVP voting and won the NL Gold Glove Award for first base. He won his first of four consecutive Fielding Bible Awards for the first base position.

Led by Pujols and Carpenter, the Cardinals won the NL Central and reached the playoffs for the third year in a row. In Game 1 of the NLDS against the Padres, he hit a game-winning two-run home run against Jake Peavy as the Cardinals won 5–1. He had a game-winning RBI against David Wells and had three hits in Game 2 as the Cardinals won 2–0. He batted .333 with a home run and an RBI in the series as the Cardinals defeated the Padres in four games. In Game 2 of the NLCS against the Mets, Pujols scored three runs as the Cardinals won 9–6. He batted .318 with one home run and one RBI in the series as the Cardinals defeated the Mets in seven games. In Game 1 of the World Series against the Detroit Tigers, he hit a two-run home run against Justin Verlander as the Cardinals won 7–2. In Game 5, he made a sprawling, flip-from-his-back play to rob Plácido Polanco of a hit as the Cardinals clinched the series, giving Pujols his first career World Series ring.
Near the beginning of the 2007 season in an April 22 game against the Cubs, Pujols hit a game-winning three-run home run against Ryan Dempster in the 10th inning of a 12–9 victory, tying Ken Boyer for second all-time on the Cardinals&#x27; home run list with his 255th. Pujols finished the season with 185 hits, 38 doubles and 103 RBI (a career-low). He was among the league leaders in batting average (.327, sixth) and home runs (32, tied for tenth). He scored 99 runs, ending his streak of seasons with at least 30 home runs, a .300 average, 100 runs scored and 100 RBI, at six. He grounded into a major-league-leading 27 double plays. He finished ninth in MVP voting, the first year he had finished outside the top five.

Pujols began 2008 by reaching base in 42 straight games, the longest streak to open a season since 1999. On June 11, he was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a strained left calf muscle. Pujols hit his 300th home run against Bob Howry on July 4 in a 2–1 loss to the Cubs. He said after the game that to him it was &quot;just another homer that goes out of the park. I&#x27;m happy to do it in front of our fans; they were waiting for it.&quot; On September 11, in a 3–2 loss to the Cubs, Pujols hit his 100th RBI of the season against Rich Harden, making him the third player in major league history to start his career with eight seasons of at least 100 RBI (along with Al Simmons and Ted Williams). He regretted that the milestone came in a loss, saying, &quot;I wish it would have come with a great win. It would have been more special.&quot;
In 148 games in 2008, Pujols batted .357 (second to Chipper Jones&#x27; .364 average) with 187 hits (third, behind Reyes&#x27;s 204 and David Wright&#x27;s 189), 44 doubles (tied with Stephen Drew and Aramis Ramírez for fourth in the league behind Berkman and Nate McLouth&#x27;s 46 and Corey Hart&#x27;s 45), 37 home runs (tied with Ryan Braun and Ryan Ludwick for fourth in the league behind Howard&#x27;s 48, Dunn&#x27;s 40, and Delgado&#x27;s 38), 116 RBI (fourth, behind Howard&#x27;s 146, Wrights 124 and Adrián González&#x27;s 119) and 100 runs scored. He grounded into a National League-leading 27 double plays. Pujols won his second NL MVP Award, and he won the Silver Slugger Award for the fourth time in his career. He was named &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Player of the Year for the second time in his career. For his work off the field, he was named the 2008 winner of the Roberto Clemente Award. He considered having Tommy John surgery after the season but underwent nerve transposition surgery on his right elbow instead to ease discomfort.

====Later Cardinals career and second World Series (2009–2011)====
On April 25, 2009, Pujols picked up his 1,000th career RBI with a 441-foot grand slam against David Patton in an 8–2 victory over the Cubs. &quot;I hit that ball as good as I can hit a ball,&quot; he said after the game. On July 3, he hit his 10th career grand slam against Weathers in a 7–4 victory over the Reds, breaking Musial&#x27;s record for most grand slams by a Cardinal. The grand slam was also his 350th career home run, making him the third-fastest player to reach the milestone, behind Alex Rodriguez and Ken Griffey Jr. He received the highest number of votes in NL history for the All-Star Game that year.

Pujols had four hits, scored three runs, and knocked in five RBI on August 4, including a grand slam against Sean Green that tied the NL record for most grand slams in a season (five), in a 10-inning, 12–7 victory over the Mets. In 160 games, Pujols batted .327 (third, behind Ramírez&#x27;s .342 and Pablo Sandoval&#x27;s .330) with 186 hits (sixth), 45 doubles (second to Miguel Tejada&#x27;s 46), 47 home runs (first), 135 RBI (third behind Fielder and Howard&#x27;s 141) and 124 runs scored (first). He was unanimously named the NL MVP for the third time, tying Musial as the Cardinals&#x27; leader in that category. For the fifth time in his career, he won the Silver Slugger Award. He won the &quot;Sporting News&quot; MLB Player of the Year award for the second consecutive year, joining Williams and Joe Morgan as the only players to win it in back-to-back years. For the fourth year in a row, he won the Fielding Bible Award for first base.

Aided by the mid-season acquisition of Matt Holliday (who replaced Ryan Ludwick as the cleanup hitter) and the emergence of Adam Wainwright (who led the NL in wins), the Cardinals returned to the playoffs after a two-year hiatus. In the NLDS against the Dodgers, Pujols batted .300 with one RBI as the Cardinals were swept in three games. Following the postseason, Pujols had surgery to remove five bone spurs from his right elbow. The Cardinals called the surgery a &quot;success&quot;, and Dr. James Andrews decided that Pujols did not need Tommy John surgery.

For April 2010, Pujols earned his first Pepsi Clutch Performer of the Month Award. He batted .348, 1.270 OPS, three home runs and 14 RBI with runners on base. Further, in situations with his team leading by one run, tied, or having the potential tying run on base, at bat, or on deck after the seventh inning (&quot;late-and-close&quot;), he batted .583 (7-for-12) with a home run, two doubles, three RBI and five runs scored. On June 29, in an 8–0 victory over the Diamondbacks, Pujols hit five RBI and hit two home runs against Dontrelle Willis for his 37th career multi-homer game, which tied Musial&#x27;s franchise record for multi-homer games. &quot;It&#x27;s pretty special,&quot; he said of tying Musial. &quot;I&#x27;m blessed to have the opportunity to be compared sometimes with him.&quot; On August 26, he hit his 400th career home run against Jordan Zimmermann in a 13-inning, 11–10 loss to the Nationals. He became the third-youngest player to reach the milestonebehind Griffey Jr. and Rodriguezand he became the fourth-quickest player by at bats to reach the milestone (behind McGwire, Babe Ruth, Harmon Killebrew, and Thome). On September 11, in a 12-inning 6–3 loss to Atlanta, Pujols had three RBI and reached 100 RBI for the 10th consecutive year with a two-run double against Tommy Hanson. Only Al Simmons has a longer streak of 100 RBI seasons at the beginning of a career, with 11. Pujols joined Jimmie Foxx, Lou Gehrig, and Rodriguez in having 10 consecutive seasons of 100 or more RBI at any time in their career. Foxx and Rodriguez are the only two players besides Pujols to have 10 consecutive years of 30 home runs and 100 RBI. The next day, in a 7–3 victory over the Braves, he passed Musial to be the all-time Cardinals&#x27; leader in multi-home run games when he hit two home runs against Tim Hudson for the 38th time in a game.

In 159 games, Pujols batted .312 (sixth) with 183 hits (fifth) and 39 doubles (tied for eighth with Marlon Byrd); he led the league in runs scored (115), home runs (42) and RBI (118). He won his second Gold Glove Award for first base, and he won the NL First Base Silver Slugger Award for the sixth time. He finished second in the NL MVP voting to Joey Votto, who said he was &quot;shocked&quot; that Pujols only got one first-place vote.

Pujols and the Cardinals set a deadline for the start of 2011 spring training for contract extension negotiations but failed to reach an agreement. After Pujols struggled in his first 30 games of the season in batting .231, he batted .316 with 30 home runs in his final 117 games. Against the Cubs, he hit consecutive extra-inning walk-off home runs on June 4 and 5 for the first time since Albert Belle in 1995. Carpenter noted after the game that Pujols&#x27; slump earlier in the year was over: &quot;He continues to do great things, there&#x27;s no doubt about it,&quot; he said. &quot;The things that he&#x27;s done the last few days have been just like the old Albert.&quot; On June 19 against the Royals, Wilson Betemit collided with Pujols, inducing a small fracture his left wrist and keeping him inactive until July 5. On July 30, in a 9–2 victory over the Cubs, he got his 2,000th career hit against Carlos Mármol, becoming the fifth Cardinal to reach 2,000 hits and 12th-fastest major leaguer by games to reach the milestone. In the Cardinals&#x27; final game of the season, against the Astros on September 28, he had the game-winning RBI against Brett Myers in the 8–0 victory, helping the Cardinals overcome a 10.5-game deficit to Atlanta to win the Wild Card.

Pujols finished the season with 173 hits (tied for ninth with Aramis Ramírez), 29 doubles (a career-low), and 105 runs scored (tied for third with Justin Upton behind Ryan Braun&#x27;s 109 and Matt Kemp&#x27;s 115). He saw his streak of seasons batting at least .300 with 30 home runs and 100 RBI snapped when he hit 37 home runs (third, behind Fielder&#x27;s 38 and Kemp&#x27;s 39), but batted .299 with 99 RBI (seventh); however, only three other players in the major leagues matched him in those categories (José Bautista, Fielder, and Kemp), causing Tyler Kepner of &quot;The New York Times&quot; to write, &quot;Even when Pujols struggles, he excels.&quot; He grounded into a major-league leading 29 double plays. He was fifth in MVP voting.
In Game 2 of the NLDS against the Phillies on October 2, Pujols had a game-winning RBI single against Cliff Lee in the 5–4 victory. He batted .350 with one RBI in the series as the Cardinals defeated the Phillies in five games. In Game 2 of the NLCS against the Brewers, he had four hits, three runs scored, one home run and five RBI, in a 12–3 victory. He batted .478 with two home runs and nine RBI in the series as the Cardinals defeated the Brewers in six games. On October 22, in Game 3 of the World Series, Pujols had five hits, three home runs, four runs scored and six RBI in a 16–7 victory over the Rangers. He joined Babe Ruth and Reggie Jackson as the only players in baseball history to hit three home runs in a World Series game, set a series record with 14 total bases, became the first player in series history to have hits in four consecutive innings, and tied records for most hits and most RBI in a World Series game. He had one hit and no RBI the other six games of the series but became a World Series champion for the second time as the Cardinals defeated the Rangers in seven games. After the season, he became a free agent for the first time in his career.

===Los Angeles Angels (2012–2021)===
Three teams were reported to be interested in Pujols during the 2011 offseason: the Cardinals, the Miami Marlins, and the Los Angeles Angels. The Cardinals offered Pujols a 10-year, $210 million deal (with $30 million deferred), but Pujols rejected it. His wife, Deidre, explained on a radio talk show that they were &quot;insulted&quot; and &quot;confused&quot; that the Cardinals had initially offered Pujols a five-year deal. The Marlins reportedly offered Pujols a 10-year contract too, but on December 8, he signed a 10-year deal with the Angels worth around $254 million.

====Early Angels tenure (2012–2016)====

Pujols did not perform very well to begin the 2012 season, batting .217 with no home runs and four RBI in the month of April. Soon after the Angels called up top prospect Mike Trout and fired hitting coach Mickey Hatcher, Pujols&#x27; numbers began to rise, as he batted .323 with 13 home runs from May 15 through the All-Star Break. On July 31, he hit two home runs against Derek Holland in a 6–2 victory over the Rangers. After the game, Holland observed that Pujols had &quot;definitely turned it around, no doubt about it... He had a slow start, but he&#x27;s picked it up. He&#x27;s a great hitter...&quot; On August 14, Pujols had four RBIs, including a game-winning three-run home run against Ubaldo Jiménez in a 9–6 victory over the Cleveland Indians. In 2012, Pujols batted .285 (at the time, a career low) in 153 games with 173 hits, 50 doubles (second to Alex Gordon&#x27;s 51), 30 home runs, 105 RBIs (7th in AL), and 85 runs scored.

In 2013, Pujols had by far the worst season of his career to date, failing to play at least 100 games in a season for the first time. Pujols also posted career worsts in hits, runs scored, doubles, home runs, RBI, walks, batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and OPS. Overall in 99 games, Pujols batted .258 with 101 hits, 19 doubles, 17 home runs, 64 RBI, and 49 runs scored. On August 19, 2013, Pujols was ruled out for the remainder of the 2013 season after suffering a foot injury. In August 2013, on his St. Louis WGNU radio show, former Cardinals player Jack Clark accused Pujols of having used performance-enhancing drugs. Clark served as the Cardinals&#x27; hitting coach during the early part of Pujols&#x27; tenure in St. Louis. On the morning of August 9, Pujols issued a statement adamantly denying that he had ever taken PEDs. He denounced Clark&#x27;s allegations as &quot;irresponsible and reckless,&quot; and threatened to sue Clark and WGNU over the allegations. Partly due to legal threats from Pujols, InsideSTL Enterprises, which owns WGNU&#x27;s weekday airtime under a time brokerage agreement, cut ties with Clark. On October 4, 2013, Pujols filed a defamation lawsuit against Clark. In response, Clark challenged Pujols, proposing that they both take polygraph tests to resolve who is telling the truth. However, on February 10, 2014, Clark apologized and retracted his accusations against Pujols, saying he had &quot;no knowledge whatsoever&quot; that Pujols ever used PEDs. &quot;During a heated discussion on air, I misspoke,&quot; Clark said. In return, Pujols dropped the suit.

On April 22, 2014, Pujols hit his 499th and 500th home runs off the Washington Nationals&#x27; Taylor Jordan at Nationals Park, where he had hit his 400th career home run in the 2010 season. Pujols became the 26th player ever to reach the 500-home-run mark, the third-youngest to reach it, and the only player to hit Nos. 499 and 500 in the same game. On August 10, he played in MLB&#x27;s longest game of the year, and the longest in the history of Angel Stadium, ending the 19-inning, 6-hours-and-31-minute contest against the Red Sox with a solo home run for a 5–4 final score. It was his first walk-off home run as an Angel and first since June 2011. On September 6, against the Minnesota Twins, Pujols collected his 2,500th career hit, a two-run go-ahead double off of Jared Burton in the 9th inning. He also passed the 1,500-run mark in the same game. In the process, he became the fifth player in major league history with 2,500 hits and 500 home runs while maintaining a .310 lifetime batting average, after Babe Ruth, Jimmie Foxx, Ted Williams and Manny Ramirez.

For the 2014 season, Pujols batted .272 and grounded into an American League-leading 28 double plays. He was tied for the 3rd-highest salary in the AL, at $23 million. After the 2014 season, Pujols traveled to Japan to join a team of MLB All-Stars playing against the All-Stars of Nippon Professional Baseball in the Japan All-Star Series.

Before the 2015 season, Pujols enjoyed his first offseason in his time with the Angels in which he was both free of injury or recuperation from injury. However, his offensive production lagged behind his career levels the first month of the season. By the end of April, Pujols was batting .208 with three home runs and nine RBI in 86 plate appearances. The next month, Pujols&#x27; offensive production had started to come around. Between May 28 and June 22, he batted .356 with 15 homers, 30 RBI, and a 1.326 OPS. At this time, he was leading the American League in home runs with 23. After batting .303/.395/.737 with 13 home runs in June 2015, Pujols was named AL Player of the Month for the first time and seventh overall monthly award. His home run total led the major leagues and 73 total bases tied Manny Machado for first in the AL. Remarkably, his batting average on balls in play was .218, significantly lower than the league average of about .300. Selected to the All Star Game, Pujols was announced as a reserve for the American League. Due to an injury just days earlier with Tigers slugger Miguel Cabrera, Pujols instead started at first base. It was his 10th overall selection to the midsummer classic, and first as a member of the Angels. On September 22, Pujols hit his 556th career home run to pass Ramírez for sole possession of 14th place on the all-time career home run leaderboard. In the last game of the season, on October 4, Pujols hit his 40th home run, the seventh time he had done so in a season. Among active MLB players, he trailed only Alex Rodriguez, with eight. With Trout also hitting 40 home runs, the 2015 Angels became just the 31st team in MLB history with multiple players to hit 40+ home runs in a season.

For the 2015 season, he batted .244/.307/.480, and he had the lowest batting average on balls in play (.217) of all major league players. He was tied for the 3rd-highest salary in the AL, at $24 million.

On April 30, 2016, Pujols became the 85th player to make 10,000 career plate appearances. On May 2, Pujols became the 20th player all-time to amass 5,000 career total bases. On August 17, Pujols joined Barry Bonds as the only other player to be intentionally walked over 300 times. Playing the Toronto Blue Jays on August 25, he reached 100 RBI for the 13th time in his career, the fifth player to do so. While playing Cincinnati on August 29, Pujols hit his 26th home run and 103rd RBI of the season. The home run tied him with Frank Robinson for ninth place on the all-time home run list at 586, and allowed him to become the seventh player all-time with 1,200 career extra base hits, and the 21st to reach 1,800 RBI. On September 16, Pujols became the 16th player all-time to reach 600 career doubles.

Pujols batted .268 for the 2016 season. He tied for 2nd in the AL in double plays grounded into, with 24. He had the 6th-highest salary in the league, at $25 million.

====Later Angels tenure (2017–2021)====

On June 3, 2017, Pujols became the ninth player in Major League history to hit at least 600 home runs, when he hit a grand slam off of Ervin Santana of the Minnesota Twins. He was the fourth-youngest player to achieve the feat (behind Alex Rodriguez, Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron), and the first to hit a grand slam for his 600th home run.

For the 2017 season, Pujols played in 149 games and had 593 at bats, but set career-lows in batting average (.241), on base percentage (.286), slugging percentage (.386), doubles (17), and walks (37), while leading the majors by grounding into 26 double plays. He had the slowest baserunning sprint speed of all major league players, at 21.8 feet/second. He had the 6th-highest salary in the AL, at $26 million.

On May 4, 2018, Pujols recorded his 3,000th major league hit, against Mike Leake of the Seattle Mariners. On July 12, Pujols hit his 630th career home run, moving into a tie with Ken Griffey Jr. for sixth place all-time for that category. The next day, Pujols was placed on the 10-day disabled list due to left knee inflammation. He hit a single on August 10 for his 1,000th hit as an Angel, becoming the ninth player to record 1,000 hits in both the American League and National League. He had surgery on his left knee in August, ending his season, and on his right elbow to remove a bone spur in September.

In 2018, he batted .245/.289/.411 with 19 home runs and 64 RBIs (matching the lowest season total of his career). He had the slowest baserunning sprint speed of all major league players for the second consecutive year, at 22.2 feet/second. He was the sixth-oldest player in the American League. He had the 5th-highest salary in the AL, at $27 million.

On May 9, 2019, Pujols became the fourth player in major league history to record 2,000 RBIs, hitting a solo home run against the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park. A Tigers fan caught the 2,000 RBI ball but refused to turn it over to MLB officials, saying that he wanted to sleep on it before making a decision. In response, MLB refused to authenticate the ball. The fan, Ely Hydes, eventually decided that he wanted to return the ball to Pujols, who in turn refused, stating that the fan should either keep the ball or donate it to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Pujols hit his 200th home run as an Angel on June 13, becoming only the sixth player to hit 200 home runs with two different teams.

In 2019, he batted .244/.305/.430. Pujols had the lowest line drive percentage of all major league hitters (15.3%), and the 16.7% of balls he hit to the opposite field were the lowest in baseball. He had the second-slowest sprint speed of all major league players, at 22.5 feet/second. He was the third-oldest player in the American League, behind Ichiro Suzuki (who retired in March) and Fernando Rodney. He was tied for the 4th-highest salary in the AL, at $28 million.

At the beginning of the 2020 season, Pujols (at the age of 40) was the oldest player in the major leagues. On August 24, Pujols passed Rodriguez to reach second on the all-time RBIs list with a single against the Astros. With his 2,087th RBI, he trailed only Hank Aaron&#x27;s 2,297. (Babe Ruth has 2,214 RBIs as recognized by Baseball Reference, but only 1,989 on the official MLB list; MLB does not count pre-1920 RBIs because it was not yet an official statistic.) On September 18, Pujols hit his 661st career home run to pass Willie Mays for fifth place all-time.

In 2020, Pujols batted .224/.270/.395 with 6 home runs and 25 RBIs in 152 at bats. He had the slowest sprint speed of all major league players, at 22.0 feet/second. He was tied for the 7th-highest salary in the league, at $29 million.

Pujols began the 2021 season with the Angels. On May 6, 2021, the Angels designated Pujols for assignment. Through 24 games, Pujols was hitting .198/.250/.372 with five home runs. On May 13, Pujols cleared waivers and became a free agent.

====Assessment of Angels tenure====
In nine-plus seasons with the Angels, Pujols hit .256 with 222 homers and 783 runs batted in. During his time with the Angels, the team won the AL West once (in 2014) and won no postseason games.

In 2016, sportswriter Joe Posnanski of NBC Sports described Pujols as &quot;a cautionary tale against big contracts&quot; and &quot;an overpaid designated hitter in the middle of the lineup for a going-nowhere Los Angeles Angels team&quot;.

In an August 7, 2018, article entitled &quot;How the shift has ruined Albert Pujols,&quot; ESPN sportswriter Alden Gonzalez wrote: 

===Los Angeles Dodgers (2021)===
On May 17, 2021, Pujols agreed to a one-year major league deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers. He made his Dodgers debut that night as the starting first baseman against the Arizona Diamondbacks. With his longtime number 5 having been assigned to Corey Seager, Pujols chose the number 55; both as nods to his two former teams, as well as the Bible. &quot;If you know the Bible,&quot; Pujols explained, &quot;it&#x27;s the number of grace. So I feel 5-5, double grace.&quot; On May 20, Pujols hit his first home run as a Dodger, a two-run homer off Merrill Kelly of the Diamondbacks. In October, Scott Miller of &quot;The New York Times&quot; asserted that Pujols had &quot;flourished beyond expectations, scorching lefties for a .306 batting average&quot;.

Overall, in 2021 he appeared in 85 games for the Dodgers and hit .254 with a .299 on base percentage, 12 homers, and 38 RBIs. For the second season in a row, he had the slowest baserunning sprint speed of all major league players, at 22.4 feet/second. His line drive percentage of 15.4% was the lowest in the major leagues, and his 16.7% of balls hit to the opposite field was the lowest in the majors. He was the oldest player in the league for the second season in a row, and had the fifth-highest salary at $30 million.

In his first postseason appearance since 2014, he appeared in nine games for the Dodgers, with five hits in 18 at bats for a batting average of .278. Pujols subsequently announced that he would play in the Dominican Professional Baseball League (LIDOM) in the offseason, for Leones del Escogido.

=== Return to St. Louis (2022) ===

On March 28, 2022, Pujols signed a one-year contract to return to the St. Louis Cardinals and announced that 2022 would be his final season. He said, &quot;There were a lot of teams interested. It took 12 hours, maybe even less, to get a deal done once we received a call from the Cardinals,&quot; adding: &quot;We have the best fans in baseball. It feels like I never left.&quot; He was the oldest player in the major leagues for the third season in a row.

On May 15, Pujols made his pitching debut, the oldest player to do so since 1929. In a 15–6 blowout win against the San Francisco Giants, he gave up two home runs and four earned runs in the ninth inning. On June 4 against the Chicago Cubs, he became the 10th major league player to play 3,000 games, appearing as an injury replacement for Corey Dickerson. On June 7 against the Tampa Bay Rays, Pujols singled for his 3,320th career hit, passing Paul Molitor for tenth all-time in hits. On July 10, after the Philadelphia Phillies had shut out the Cardinals in three straight games, Pujols made a rare start against a right-handed pitcher, and his three hits, including a home run, helped spark a 4–3 win. The home run was Pujols&#x27; 1,377th extra-base hit, tying him for third all-time with Stan Musial. Pujols was chosen to be on the National League team for the All-Star Game by MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred as a &quot;legacy&quot; selection to honor his career achievements. He was also selected to participate in the Home Run Derby, where he advanced to the second round and fell one home run short of eventual winner Juan Soto.

On August 20, he passed Musial for second place all-time in total bases, trailing only Hank Aaron. On August 22, he was named the National League Player of the Week alongside teammate Paul Goldschmidt after hitting .615 with three home runs and seven RBIs. On August 29, Pujols hit a third-inning home run off of Ross Detwiler of the Cincinnati Reds. Detwiler was the 450th unique pitcher to surrender a home run to Pujols, who thus broke a record belonging to Barry Bonds. On September 10 and 11, Pujols hit his 696th and 697th home runs, at PNC Park against the Pittsburgh Pirates, to move into fourth place on the all-time list. On September 14, he became the second player in MLB history to officially compile 2,200 RBIs. On September 23, Pujols became the fourth player to hit 700 career home runs. His 699th and 700th home runs came during consecutive at-bats during an 11–0 victory for the Cardinals at Dodger Stadium. He hit No. 699 off Andrew Heaney, his 200th home run off a left-handed pitcher; and his 700th off Phil Bickford, his 500th home run off a right-handed pitcher. On October 2, he hit No. 702 in his last career home game, mirroring the home run he hit in his St. Louis debut two decades earlier. On October 3, he hit No. 703, which gave him sole possession of second place on the all-time RBI list, surpassing Babe Ruth&#x27;s total. Pujols finished his regular-season career first in double plays grounded into (426), third in sacrifice flies (123), fifth in games played (3,080) and doubles (686), and sixth in at bats (11,421).

The Cardinals won the National League Central division, earning a berth in the postseason and enabling Pujols&#x27; 10th and final postseason appearance. He went 2-for-8 in the National League Wild Card Series with the Philadelphia Phillies. In Game 2 on October 8, he singled in his last two at-bats. The Phillies won the game, eliminating the Cardinals and bringing Pujols&#x27; playing career to an end. On November 1, it was announced that Pujols had signed retirement papers with the Cardinals.

After the season was finished, Pujols was awarded the Major League Baseball Comeback Player of the Year Award, along with Justin Verlander.

==Post-playing career==

On February 23, 2023, the Angels hired Pujols as a special assistant as part of a 10–year personal services contract. Since retiring, Pujols has also been an analyst on MLB Network.

In June 2023, Pujols was named the &quot;official global ambassador&quot; of Baseball United, a professional baseball organization in the Middle East and South Asia. He was also reported to have an ownership interest in the league.

In February 2024, Pujols was named the manager of the Leones del Escogido. The Leones del Escogido won the Serie Final of the 2024–25 season.

==Playing style==
Pujols&#x27; swing was praised for its consistency. &quot;It&#x27;s the same swing every time,&quot; former teammate Lance Berkman once said. &quot;He has the ability to repeat his swing over and over and over, which leads to him being very consistent,&quot; Cardinals&#x27; video coordinator Chad Blair said. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer Daniel G. Habib described the swing as &quot;quick&quot; and &quot;quiet&quot;. Pujols used a 32.5-ounce bat against right-handed pitchers, but used a 33-ounce bat against left-handers to avoid trying to pull the ball when he swung. He credited his hitting ability partly to learning what pitchers would do in certain counts and situations: 

==Accomplishments and accolades==
Pujols is second in major league history in runs batted in and total bases behind only Hank Aaron. He and Aaron are the only two players to amass 3,000 hits, 700 home runs, and 2,200 RBIs. Only two other players (Stan Musial and Willie Mays) have surpassed 6,000 total bases. Pujols hit home runs off of a record 458 different pitchers over the course of his career, and is fourth in career home runs and fifth in doubles. In 2009, Pujols set the major league single-season record for assists by a first baseman with 185.

Pujols is the all-time leader in double plays hit into. In an age when seasons of 150+ strikeouts were the norm for sluggers, he never struck out 100 times in a season.

Pujols became the first player to produce four hits and two homers in a single game at the age of 42 or older in August 2022. Given his career achievements, Pujols is widely expected to be inducted into the Hall of Fame and potentially a unanimous selection the first year in which he becomes eligible (2028).

Pujols has earned praise from many of his fellow players and coaches. In 2008, he was named the most feared hitter in baseball in a poll of all 30 MLB managers. La Russa has called him &quot;the best player I&#x27;ve ever managed.&quot; National League Central Division rival Joey Votto referred to him as &quot;one of the greatest hitters of all time.&quot; Brendan Ryan said, &quot;He&#x27;s the best there is.&quot; Fernando Viña said, while Pujols was in his first stint with the Cardinals, &quot;He&#x27;s the face of the Cardinals.&quot;

===Awards and honors===



==Other endeavors==
===Business ventures===
In 2006, Pujols and the Hanon family opened Pujols 5 Westport Grill, a restaurant located in Westport Plaza of Maryland Heights, Missouri. A 10-foot, 1,100-lb. statue of Pujols was dedicated on November 2, 2011, outside the restaurant. An anonymous donor commissioned sculptor Harry Weber to create the statue, which belongs to the Pujols Family Foundation. After Pujols signed with the Angels, the restaurant was renamed the St. Louis Sports Hall of Fame Grill.

In 2008, Pujols teamed up with St. Louis Soccer United, a group looking to bring a Major League Soccer (MLS) franchise to the St. Louis area. However, the group&#x27;s bid for a franchise was unsuccessful, and a USL team (Saint Louis FC) was formed.

===Charitable work===

In 2005, Albert and Deidre Pujols launched the Pujols Family Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit dedicated to their &quot;commitment to faith, family and others.&quot; The organization promotes awareness of Down syndrome and works to support those who have it and their families, aids the poor in the Dominican Republic, and supports people with disabilities and/or life-threatening illnesses. Among other activities, the foundation hosts events for people with Down syndrome. The foundation gave the Down Syndrome Association of Greater St. Louis the resources to open an office and hire staff. In 2009, the Albert Pujols Wellness Center for Adults with Down Syndrome opened in Chesterfield, Missouri; Pujols was present at the opening on November 18. The foundation hosts an annual &quot;All Stars Basketball Game&quot; with down syndrome players at Missouri Baptist University.

Pujols has taken several trips to the Dominican Republic, by taking supplies as well as a team of doctors and dentists to the poor who need medical care. The Pujols Family Foundation also holds an annual golf tournament to raise money to send dentists to the Dominican Republic.

In 2009, Pujols donated money to the Mike Coolbaugh Memorial Tournament, allowing the event to occur after a sponsor backed out. On August 28, 2010, Pujols and La Russa attended Glenn Beck&#x27;s &quot;Restoring Honor&quot; rally in Washington, D.C., after being assured by Beck that the rally was not political. During the rally, Pujols was presented with a medal for his off-the-field efforts.

==Personal life==
Pujols married Deidre Pujols on January 1, 2000. They have five children. After 22 years of marriage, Pujols filed for divorce on April 4, 2022, citing irreconcilable differences. Pujols is a devout evangelical Christian. He became an evangelical Christian on November 13, 1998, influenced in part by Deidre and his grandmother. During his first tenure with the Cardinals, Pujols and his family attended West County Community Church, a Southern Baptist church in Wildwood, Missouri.

On September 3, 2023, Pujols married Nicole Fernandez, the daughter of former President of the Dominican Republic, Leonel Fernández. The two had been dating since October 2022, shortly before Pujols’ playing career ended.

During his playing days, even with the Angels and Dodgers, Pujols lived in St. Louis during the offseason. He owned a home in Irvine, California, but put it up for sale in 2016. Pujols is a supporter of people with Down syndrome, a condition his daughter Isabella was born with. In 2007, Pujols became a U.S. citizen, scoring a perfect 100 on his citizenship test.

Pujols is close friends with third baseman Plácido Polanco, a former teammate with the Cardinals. Polanco has called Pujols his &quot;closest friend in baseball&quot;, and Pujols is the godfather to Polanco&#x27;s son, Ishmael. Pujols is also friends with Robinson Canó, who selected Mark Trumbo for the 2012 Home Run Derby after being asked to by Pujols.

<text>&quot;You&#x27;re My Best Friend&quot; is a song by the British rock band Queen, written by the band&#x27;s bass player, John Deacon, who wrote it for and about his wife. It was first included on the 1975 album &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;, and later released as a single. The ballad also appeared on the &quot;Live Killers&quot; (1979) live album, and on the compilation albums &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (1981), &quot;Absolute Greatest&quot; (2009) and &quot;Queen Forever&quot; (2014).

The song reached number seven in the UK Singles Chart and number 16 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It is certified platinum by the RIAA in the US with over one million copies sold. The song has since featured in television, film, and other media, such as &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;Family Guy&quot;.

==History==
Deacon wrote the song for his wife, Veronica Tetzlaff. In this song, he plays a Wurlitzer electric piano in addition to his bass guitar work. The characteristic &quot;bark&quot; of the Wurlitzer&#x27;s bass notes plays a prominent role in the song. During live performances, Freddie Mercury would play a grand piano, while Deacon played the bass guitar as in the original recording. The song would be performed live by the band from the Summer Gigs 1976 Tour up to the end of the North American leg of The Game Tour in 1980. It was then dropped from the rest of the tour, and would not be played live again until after the death of Mercury.

The song was used in several TV shows and films such as &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;, &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, &quot;EastEnders&quot;, &quot;My Name is Earl&quot;, &quot;The King of Queens&quot;, &quot;Good Omens&quot;, &quot;The Break-Up&quot;, the end credits of &quot;I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;, &quot;Peter&#x27;s Friends&quot;, &quot;The Secret Life of Pets&quot;, and the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Farmer Guy&quot;.

==Music video==
The music video, directed by Bruce Gowers, shows the band in a huge ballroom surrounded by over one thousand candles, including a huge chandelier hung from the ceiling. The video was filmed in April 1976 at Elstree Studios, near London. Additionally, Deacon is seen playing a grand piano rather than the Wurlitzer he used on the recording.

==Composition==
The song was composed by John Deacon in the key of C major with a meter of 4/4, in swing feel.

The album &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; features songs of numerous styles, including this three-minute pop song. Very unusual for the genre, there is no section appearing more than twice; characteristic of many Queen songs, as affirmed by Brian May. On the other hand, in terms of phrases and measures, there are numerous repetitions or variants. The form is cyclic and very similar to that of &quot;Spread Your Wings&quot; (1977). Another similarity between the two songs is the lack of (real) modulation. The arrangement features 3 and 4-part vocal and guitar harmonies, bass (melodic approach), drums, and electric piano. This is Deacon&#x27;s second recorded song and the first one released on single, some six months after the album-release. Mercury hits two sustained C5s in the lead vocal track.

==Reception==
&quot;Cash Box&quot; said that &quot;the harmonies are smoothly designed to accentuate the hook of the chorus&quot; and that &quot;the beat is really good, on the edge of bubblegum, but still classy.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; said it &quot;stands to be every bit the enormous hit [&#x27;Bohemian Rhapsody&#x27;] was,&quot; even though it does not break new ground the way &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; did. &quot;Classic Rock History&quot; critic Millie Zeiler rated it John Deacon&#x27;s best Queen song.

<doc id="718212" wikidata="Q202845" url="?curid=718212" title="Tongariro National Park">
<text>Tongariro National Park (; ), located in the central North Island, is the oldest national park in New Zealand and the sixth national park established in the world. It has been recognised by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site for its mixed cultural and natural values.

The active volcanic mountains Ruapehu, Ngauruhoe, and Tongariro are located in the centre of the park. Three ski fields operate from the slopes of Mount Ruapehu, and the park is also a popular recreation area for hiking, fishing, hunting and other outdoor pursuits. Tongariro National Park is home to the famed Tongariro Alpine Crossing, widely regarded as one of the world&#x27;s best one-day hikes.

The natural environment of the park ranges from temperate rainforest to beech forest, tussock shrubland and alpine ecosystems. A variety of endemic and native birds and plants are found in the park.

There are a number of Māori religious sites within the park, and many of the park&#x27;s summits, including Ngauruhoe and Ruapehu, are &quot;tapu&quot;, or sacred. 

There are many small towns around the boundary of the park including Ohakune, Waiouru, Horopito, Pokaka, Erua, National Park Village and Tūrangi.

== Māori relationship to the mountains ==
In Māori legend the volcanoes in Tongariro National Park are personified. Various versions of the basic story exist: Tongariro and Taranaki were both in love with Ruapehu or Pihanga and had a great battle. Taranaki lost the battle and fled west towards the coast, carving out the Whanganui River on the way. The Tama Lakes (Māori: &quot;Ngā puna a Tama&quot;), two crater lakes between Mount Ruapehu and Mount Ngauruhoe, are said to represent the gap left when Taranaki departed.

In 2017, the Department of Conservation issued a notice advising visitors not to climb to the summits of the mountains in Tongariro National Park because they are sacred to local iwi. Some Māori view the mountains as their ancestors, with the peaks being the heads of the ancestors, and see it as wrong to stand on the heads of the ancestors. The notice also asked tourist operators to &quot;remove all references to summit side trips or ascending peaks in the park, remove any images of people touching or swimming in sacred lakes and to stop referring to Mt Ngāuruhoe as Mt Doom&quot;. Following the advisory notice, Department of Conservation staff noticed a significant decrease in the numbers of people summiting mountains in the park.

The park falls in the tribal areas (&quot;rohe&quot;) of two main iwi: Ngāti Tūwharetoa and Ngāti Rangi. The northern and western parts of the park, extending south to the summit of Ruapehu, belong to Ngāti Tūwharetoa while Ngāti Rangi&#x27;s area includes the southern and south-western flank of Ruapehu. Other iwi with traditional interests in the park are the upper Whanganui iwi Ngāti Hāua and Te Korowai o Wainuiārua from the Whanganui River.

The Waitangi Tribunal&#x27;s national park inquiry in 2004 to 2013 investigated Treaty of Waitangi claims relating to Tongariro National Park. In July 2018, the Crown met representatives of some iwi and it was agreed that negotiations would be delayed until all groups with interests in the park had had their settlements progressed, at which time cultural redress would be developed. The cultural redress process seeks to protect spiritually significant sites, recognise the traditional relationships of iwi with the environment and give claimants greater power to participate in managing the places involved.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
According to Māori oral history, Ngāti Tuwharetoa ancestor Ngātoro-i-rangi climbed the volcanoes 30 generations ago, naming Tongariro and other landscape features and claiming the area for his descendants.

Around 1750, Te Rangihiroa, son of local chief Pakaurangi, was said to have explored the area around the volcanoes in the park. The Māori name for Blue Lake (near the Tongariro Alpine Crossing), Te Wai-whakaata-o-te-Rangihiroa, can be translated as &#x27;Rangihiroa&#x27;s mirror&#x27;. Te Rangihiroa&#x27;s sister was Te Maari, whose name was given to the Te Maari craters on Tongariro.

John Bidwill is thought to be the first European to climb Mount Ngauruhoe, in March 1839. His Māori guides refused to take him to the summit because it was sacred or tapu, so Bidwill climbed alone. He was met with anger when he returned to the village he had started from. Bidwill may also have climbed Mount Tongariro. The chief Mananui Te Heu Heu Tūkino II then placed a tapu on the area, denying Dieffenbach, Governor George Grey and Hochstetter permission to ascend the volcanoes, and the artist George French Angas was forbidden from sketching the mountains. Mananui and many of his family died in a landslide in 1846. His body was put in a vault at Pūkawa, and later taken to a burial cave on Mount Tongariro. In 1910, Mananui&#x27;s remains were reinterred in a tomb at Waihī. 

Henry Dyson made an ascent of Ngauruhoe in March 1851, defying Mananui&#x27;s tapu but with the support of Te Herekiekie of Tokaanu. Pierce Connelly, an artist, climbed Ngauruhoe in 1877 and William Collie, photographer, climbed Ngauruhoe in 1878. Both were stripped of their belongings for breaking the tapu on the mountain. Donald Manson, a watch salesman from the United States, climbed Ngauruhoe in 1881 after paying Māori £10 for permission to do so.

===Park establishment===

With the mountain summits being of great significance to local Māori, and in order to prevent the selling of the mountains to European settlers, in 1886 the Ngāti Tūwharetoa iwi had the mountains surveyed in the Native Land Court and then set aside (&quot;whakatapua&quot;) as a reserve in the names of certain chiefs. One of these chiefs was Te Heuheu Tūkino IV (Horonuku), son of Mananui Te Heuheu Tūkino II and the most significant chief of the Ngāti Tūwharetoa iwi. Later the peaks of Mount Tongariro, Mount Ngauruhoe, and parts of Mount Ruapehu, were conveyed to the Crown on 23 September 1887, on condition that a protected area was established there.

This area was generally considered to be too small to establish a national park after the model of Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, United States, and so further areas were acquired. When the New Zealand Parliament passed the Tongariro National Park Act in October 1894, the park covered an area of about , but it took until 1907 to acquire the land. 

In 1908, a scientific party consisting of botanist Leonard Cockayne, forester and surveyor Edward Phillips Turner and geologist Robert Speight spent several months exploring and surveying the park. Their report presented to Parliament detailed the flora and fauna and geology of the region, and recommended that the park&#x27;s boundaries be expanded. Cockayne also noted that it was important to protect the environment from development and introduced pests.

When the Act was renewed in 1922, the park area was extended to . Further extensions, especially Pihanga Scenic Reserve in 1975, enlarged the park to its current size of . The last modification to the Act was passed in 1980. Tongariro National Park has been under the control of the New Zealand Department of Conservation since the creation of the department in 1987. A plaque at the Whakapapa Visitor Centre commemorates Te Heuheu&#x27;s gift to New Zealand.

===Development===
The first activity in the young Tongariro National Park was the construction of tourist huts at the beginning of the 20th century, but it was not until the opening of the North Island Main Trunk railway line between Auckland and Wellington in 1908 and the building of roads in the 1920s that a significant number of people visited the park. This early tourist development explains the rather uncommon existence of a permanently inhabited village and fully developed ski area within a national park. Skiing on the mountains in the park became popular from about 1914, when the Ruapehu Ski Club was established. The first ski hut was built on Mt Ruapehu in 1923 at an elevation of 1770 m, and a ski lift was constructed in 1938–1939. The second Tongariro National Park Act, in 1922, started some active conservation efforts, and in 1923 a park ranger was appointed.

The first motor vehicle reached Whakapapa village via the Bruce Road in August 1925, after the previous rough cart track was upgraded by prison labour and a bridge was built over the Whakapapa River. This led to an influx of tourists and demands for more accommodation at Whakapapa. The hotel Chateau Tongariro at Whakapapa opened in 1929 with 95 bedrooms and associated cheaper lodges for trampers. The road was extended beyond Whakapapa Village after World War 2. Road access to the park was further improved in the 1960s with the development of roads needed for building the Tongariro Power Scheme.

=== World Heritage Site ===
In 1990, New Zealand nominated Tongariro National Park as a World Heritage Site. World Heritage Sites are places protected under a treaty administered by UNESCO for having cultural, historical, or scientific heritage considered to be of outstanding value to humanity. The government&#x27;s nomination stated that the park was valuable under the &#x27;Natural Property&#x27; category for its chain of volcanoes aligned along a tectonic plate boundary, showing Earth&#x27;s evolutionary history; its ongoing geological processes and associated plant environments; and its outstanding natural phenomena and beauty. Mount Ruapehu was said to be the &quot;most active composite volcano in the world&quot;, making it ideal for scientific observation. Crater Lake on Mount Ruapehu was stated to be unique due to its glacial setting and frequent eruptions, making it a case study of the lahar-producing interaction of magma and lake water. The park was listed for its natural features in 1990, and in 1993 it achieved dual heritage status for having both natural values and Māori cultural and spiritual significance. This was the first national park in the world to have its spiritual significance recognised as a &quot;cultural landscape&quot;, an initiative supported by Tumu Te Heuheu of Ngati Tuwharetoa.

== Geography ==

=== Location and size ===
Tongariro National Park covers an area of surrounding the massif of the three active volcanoes Mount Ruapehu, Mount Ngauruhoe, and Mount Tongariro in the centre of the North Island. The northern boundary of the park is just a few kilometres west-southwest of Lake Taupō. The Tongariro National Park Visitor Centre at Whakapapa Village is south of Auckland by road, and north of Wellington.

The Pihanga Scenic Reserve, containing Lake Rotopounamu, Mount Pihanga and the Kakaramea-Tihia Massif, though separate from the main park area, is also part of the national park.

Rangipo Desert (also known as Te Onetapu) is a largely uninhabited area of about to the east of Mount Ruapehu. Part of it is owned by the army and the rest is in Tongariro National Park. Rangipo Desert receives of rainfall per year, but resembles a desert because of its location on the volcanic plateau, poor soil quality and consequent erosion, sparse vegetation and strong drying winds. Frosts are common and heavy snowfalls occur in winter. The stretch of State Highway 1 passing through the Rangipo Desert is known as the Desert Road. 

Most of the park is located in the Ruapehu District (Manawatū-Whanganui region), although the northeast is in the Taupō District (Waikato Region, or Hawke&#x27;s Bay Region to the north). 

Three towns are adjacent to the park: Tūrangi, Waimarino (formerly called National Park Village) and Ohakune. Further away are Waiouru and Raetihi. Two Māori settlements, Papakai and Otukou, are not part of the park but lie to the west of Lake Rotoaira between the Pihanga Scenic Reserve and the main park area. Within the park borders, the only settlement is the tourism-based Whakapapa Village where the Chateau Tongariro, accommodation facilities and the Tongariro National Park Visitor Centre are located. There is temporary accommodation at Iwikau Village on the Whakapapa ski field, and also at the Tukino ski field.

Ketetahi hot springs is an area of on the northern slope of Mount Tongariro which, although lying within the park boundaries, has never been part of Tongariro National Park. Hikers on the Tongariro Alpine Crossing were formerly allowed to pass by the hot springs, but the Māori owners, Ketetahi Springs Trust, closed the route because they objected to commercial guides making money from their land. In 2010 the Department of Conservation agreed to re-route the Tongariro Alpine Crossing so that it does not cross the private land.

=== Climate ===
Like the whole of New Zealand, Tongariro National Park is situated in a temperate zone. The prevailing westerly winds gather water over the Tasman Sea. Apart from Mount Taranaki, the volcanoes of Tongariro National Park are the first significant elevations that these westerly winds encounter across the central North Island. Rain falls almost daily. The east–west rainfall differences are not as great as in the Southern Alps, because the three volcanoes do not belong to a greater mountain range, but there is still a noticeable rain shadow effect. The Rangipo desert on the eastern leeward side receives around of rainfall annually. At Whakapapa Village (elevation 1119 m) the average annual rainfall is about , in Ohakune (610 m) about and at higher altitudes, such as Iwikau Village (1770 m), about . In winter there is snow to about 1500 m. Temperatures vary dramatically, even within one day. At Whakapapa, they can fall below freezing point all year round. The average temperature is 13 °C, with a maximum of 25 °C in summer and a minimum of −10 °C in winter. In some summers the summits of the three volcanoes are covered with snow; on top of Mount Ruapehu, snow fields can be found every summer and the summit is glaciated.

=== Rivers ===
Many rivers originate in the park, including the Waikato, Whangaehu and Whanganui. The Waikato River, which is sacred to Māori, rises on Mount Ruapehu. Also rising on Ruapehu are the Wahianoa River, Whangaehu River and Mangawhero River. To the west the Whanganui River and its tributary the Mangatepōpō Stream rise on Mount Tongariro, flowing eventually into the Whanganui National Park, and the Tāwhitikuri Stream rises in the park and flows into the Mangatepōpō. Water from streams and rivers which rise in the park is diverted into the Tongariro Power Scheme outside the park.

== Geology ==

The park&#x27;s volcanoes are at the southern end of a range of volcanoes, below which the Australian Plate meets the Pacific Plate. These volcanoes have resulted from internal tectonic processes. The Pacific Plate subducts under the Australian plate, and subsequently melts due to the high temperatures of the asthenosphere. This magma, being less dense, rises to the surface and goes through the weak parts of the Earth&#x27;s crust (the faults) resulting in volcanic processes in the area.

Volcanic processes have been building the mountains of Tongariro National Park for over two million years. Three volcanoes (Tongariro, Ngauruhoe and Ruapehu) remain active, while the park&#x27;s two northernmost volcanoes (Pihanga and the Kakaramea-Tihia Massif) last erupted over 20,000 years ago. They have however produced significant historic mudflows. 

Erosion and deposition by mountain glaciers has also played an important role in shaping Tongariro and Ruapehu volcanoes. Small glaciers are present on the summit of Mt. Ruapehu today, however there is abundant geomorphological evidence for more extensive glaciation in the recent geological past. Glaciers were last present on Tongariro during the Last Glacial Maximum.

== Ecology ==
===Flora===
The park has numerous vegetation zones which usually have distinct boundaries: forest, shrub, scrubland, tussock, fernland, sedgeland, rushland, moss field, gravel and stone fields and ice field. Vegetation patterns are generally determined by altitude, for example the mountain beech is generally found above 1000 m, but also depend on other factors: existing forests have developed since the Taupō pumice eruption which destroyed the park’s northern and eastern forests; tussock and shrubland are the result of burning except those above the treeline which are related to climate and soil conditions; poor soil drainage resulted in bracken fernlands, sedgeland and rushlands around Hauhungatahi. Erosion and climate allow only small tussock and shrubs to grow in gravel and stone fields. 

In the north of the park, south of SH47, is a podocarp-broadleaf rain forest where there are Hall&#x27;s totara (&quot;Podocarpus laetus&quot;), kahikatea (&quot;Dacrycarpus dacrydioides&quot;), rimu (&quot;Dacrydium cuppressinum&quot;), northern rātā (&quot;Metrosideros robusta&quot;), kāmahi (&quot;Pterophylla racemosa&quot;) and kaikawaka (&quot;Libocedrus bidwillii&quot;). The forest understory contains mountain cabbage trees (&quot;Cordyline indivisa&quot;), &quot;Coprosma tenuifolia&quot;, &quot;Cyathea smithii&quot;, black maire (&quot;Nestigis cunninghamii&quot;), māhoe (&quot;Melicytus ramiflorus&quot;), bush flax (&quot;Astelia fragrans&quot;), epiphytes, grasses and ferns such as crown fern (&quot;Blechnum discolor&quot;). At a lower altitude there are areas of kānuka (&quot;Kunzea serotina&quot;), mānuka (&quot;Leptospermum scoparium&quot;) and bracken (&quot;Pteridium esculentum&quot;).

Beech forests of red (&quot;Nothofagus fusca&quot;), silver (&quot;Nothofagus menziesii&quot;) and mountain beech (&quot;Nothofagus solandri&quot; var. &quot;cliffortioides&quot;) grow on Tongariro as well as near the Waihohonu Huts, and to the south and west of Ruapehu. Red mistletoe (&quot;Peraxilla tetrapetala&quot;) grows in summer on the mountain beech at Whakapapa Village. 

To the northwest of the park and around the three mountains, between an altitude of 1200 and 1500 m, are tussock and shrubland. The tussock consists mainly of red tussock grass (&quot;Chionochloa rubra&quot;), mountain inaka (&quot;Dracophyllum recurvum&quot;), wire rush (&quot;Empodisma minus&quot;), monoao (&quot;Dracophyllum subulatum&quot;) and tangle fern (&quot;Gleichenia alpina&quot;). West of Tongariro exotic heather (&quot;Calluna vulgaris&quot;), with its distinctive pink and mauve flowers, grows on better drained sites competing with red tussock, mountain inaka and other native species. 

The gravel and stone fields support mountain inaka, bristle tussock (&quot;Rhytidosperma setifolium&quot;), snow totara (&quot;Podocarpus nivalus&quot;) and snowberry (&quot;Gaultheria colensoi&quot;) at an altitude of about 1100–1550m. Mountain inaka establishes itself in crevices and on stable ground surfaces. Red tussock, mountain daisies (&quot;Celmisia&quot; sp.) and other tussocks grow but the vegetation is constantly broken down by the frost. Orchids, such as the leek-leaved orchid (&quot;Prasophyllum colensoi&quot;) and green-hooded orchid (&quot;Pterostylis patens&quot;), grow on Tongariro&#x27;s sub-alpine and alpine areas. Mosses (including species of &quot;Rhacomitrium&quot;) are found to the north of the Blue Lake on Tongariro and moss fields occur on other moist gravel slopes. Above 1770 m, parahebes, everlasting daisies (&quot;Helichrysum&quot; sp.) and mountain carrot (&quot;Anisotome aromatica&quot;) exist up to about 2000m above which there are only crustose lichens on stable rocks.

===Fauna===
There are 56 significant species of birds in the park, including rare endemic species like the North Island brown kiwi, kākā, blue duck, North Island fernbird, double-banded plover and New Zealand falcon/kārearea. Other bird species common in the park are tūī, New Zealand bellbird, morepork/ruru, grey warbler/riroriro, fantail, whitehead/pōpokotea and silvereye. The park also features the only two native mammals of New Zealand, the short- and long-tailed bat. Tongariro National Park also teems with insects like moths and wētā. Also present in the park, as well as the whole of New Zealand, are animals introduced by Europeans, such as black rats, stoats, cats, rabbits, hare, possums and red deer.

== Conservation ==

=== Heather ===
In the early 20th century, park administrators, including John Cullen, introduced heather to the park to make it suitable for grouse hunting. Grouse were introduced in 1924, but within a few years had disappeared. The heather thrived, leading to criticism of its introduction as early as the 1920s because it threatens the ecological system and endemic plants of the park. In 1996, the heather beetle, &quot;Lochmaea suturalis&quot;, was imported to deal with the invasive heather but initially this was not very successful. Between 1996–2018, only 5,000 ha of heather was damaged by the beetles. However research in 2021 showed that the heather beetles were spreading and had been killing the heather. Since 2018 the beetles have damaged more than 35,000 ha of heather, reducing cover in affected areas by up to 99% and thereby allowing native plants to recover. The New Zealand Defence Force no longer needs to spray herbicide on large parts of its training ground next to the national park. A 2024 study of heather in the park found that it was present over one third of the landscape of the park. Heather has caused the disappearance of native ferns, sedges and rushes and affected the growth pattern of red tussock. An underground fungus that has a symbiotic relationship with the tussock was also affected by the spread of heather.

=== Pine trees ===
Pine trees were introduced into New Zealand in the 1930s for forestry and control of erosion, but wilding pines, coniferous trees grown from wind-blown seeds, have become a nationwide problem. Volunteers and the government have been working since the 1960s to eradicate wilding pines on Mount Ruapehu, since they shut out native plants, consume water and degrade the environment. Tongariro National Park received funding from the National Wilding Conifer Control Programme which was set up in 2016 to produce a coordinated nationwide effort at pine control. By 2023 the Conifer Control Programme had stopped the spread of wilding pines in the Tongariro area including the national park and removed most sources of seeds.

=== Kaimanawa horses ===
Until the mid-20th century, wild horses descended from animals brought to New Zealand in the 1800s roamed in the national park and surrounding areas. After the population declined due to hunting and habitat changes, the horses, today known as the Kaimanawa horses, came under government protection in 1981. The population is managed by the Department of Conservation to ensure the horses&#x27; current range does not extend back into Tongariro National Park.

=== Deer, goats and pigs ===
Red deer were released periodically in Tongariro National Park from the late 19th century, and sika deer introduced to the Kaimanawas in 1905 later spread to the park. By the 1940s deer were recognised as a menace to local plant life, and the government made efforts to reduce the population through culling. During 1962, deer were regularly sighted within metres of the Chateau, a sign that the population was higher than officials had thought. Private hunters can shoot deer in the park as a means to keep the population down.

Alongside a goat control programme in Tongariro Forest adjacent to Tongariro National Park, the Department of Conservation (DoC) is vigilant about detecting feral goats within the park. In 2024, a helicopter using thermal imaging technology searched 16,000 ha of the park for goats, but none were found. DoC states that regular surveillance and early action is more cost-effective than trying to root out a population that has already become established.

Pigs are found in low numbers in the Rotopounamu-Mount Pihanga area and the northern slopes of Mount Tongariro. Pigs affect plant life by eating seedlings and berries and rooting up the roots of trees and plants. Disturbance of plant roots also increases erosion and sends sediment into rivers. Pigs have also been known to eat the eggs of ground-dwelling birds such as kiwi. The Department of Conservation keeps numbers down by hunting, and private hunting is allowed. 

=== Project Tongariro ===
The Tongariro Natural History Society (known as Project Tongariro) is a conservation group set up by volunteers in 1984 as a memorial to national park staff lost in a 1982 helicopter accident. Since the 1980s the group has undertaken many projects in Tongariro National Park, including ecological restoration at Lake Rotopounamu, restoration of sites used in filming the Lord of the Rings, surveys of blue duck habitats, and restoration of the Hapuawhenua Viaduct in the park.

=== Over-tourism ===

In the period July 2022 – March 2023, 9% of international visitors to New Zealand spent time in Tongariro National Park. Over-tourism is a problem in the park, particularly on the Tongariro Alpine Crossing where visitor numbers increased from 10,000 in 1990 to 125,000 in 2015. In addition to the difficulties of managing greater numbers of vehicles, rubbish disposal and toilet facilities, the environment becomes degraded and park staff face more callouts for visitors needing rescue. In an attempt to manage the situation, in 2023 the Department of Conservation put in place a booking system for those wishing to walk the Tongariro Alpine Crossing.

== Activities ==
The main recreational activities in the park are hiking and climbing in summer, and skiing and snowboarding in winter. 

=== Access ===
The bulk of Tongariro National Park is surrounded by roads that roughly follow the park borders and provide access. In the west, State Highway 4 passes Waimarino (National Park Village), and in the east, State Highway 1 runs parallel to the Tongariro River. State Highway 47 joins these two highways to the north of much of the park, although it bisects the Pihanga Scenic Reserve. The southern link is State Highway 49. The North Island Main Trunk railway from Auckland to Wellington passes Waimarino.

The main entrance to the park is at Whakapapa Village, accessed via State Highway 48. A mountain access road leads from Whakapapa Village to Iwikau Village at the base of Whakapapa skifield. On the Turoa side, the Ohakune Mountain Road provides access from Ohakune township to the base of Turoa skifield. There is also a skifield access road to the Tukino ski field. These three roads each ascend to over 1,700m. Other roads into the park include Mangatepopo Road and Ketetahi Road, which provide access to the start and end points of the Tongariro Alpine Crossing.
=== Hiking and walking ===
The most popular track in Tongariro National Park is the Tongariro Alpine Crossing. Most of the track is also part of the Tongariro Northern Circuit, a two- to four-day hike, which is one of New Zealand&#x27;s ten &quot;Great Walks&quot;. Side trips to the summits of Mount Tongariro and Mount Ngauruhoe are possible on these tracks, though discouraged by the Department of Conservation. Another route is the three- to six-day Round the Mountain Track around Mount Ruapehu. Besides these, there are numerous shorter tracks appropriate for day tramps. With this track net, three camp sites, two emergency shelters, nine public and four private huts and the facilities in Whakapapa, the park is well developed for tourism. These tracks also serve as winter routes, as well as the track to the summit of Mount Ruapehu. Rock-climbing is also an option.
=== Skiing ===
Snow season is from late June to early November. The biggest ski area, Whakapapa, is on the north-western slopes of Mount Ruapehu. It has 15 lifts, covering an area of . The base of the ski field is at Iwikau Village, at the top of the Bruce Road, from the Tongariro National Park Visitor Centre. Iwikau Village has around 47 ski club huts: most of them also accommodate non-club members. Other facilities and accommodation are located in Whakapapa Village at the base of the mountain. A second ski field called Turoa is located on the south-western slope. It has nine lifts and a ski area of . There is no accommodation at the Turoa ski field: the nearest town is Ohakune. These two ski fields came under common management in 2000. The company later went into receivership, and in November 2023, Pure Tūroa, a Māori collective, took over a 10-year lease of Turoa. Management of Whakapapa remained with the receivers. 

Apart from these major ski fields, there is also Tukino, a club ski field that is open to the public. Tukino Skifield has three nutcracker rope tows and covers . The field is accessed via a 4WD road from State Highway 1. The Tukino field is run by theTukino Mountain Clubs Association representing Desert Alpine Ski Club, Tukino Alpine Sports Club and the Aorangi Ski Club on the south-eastern slope. The three ski clubs each have an accommodation block on the field.

=== Mountain biking ===
Mountain biking was originally only allowed on the main formed roads in the park. However, the partial review of the National Park Management Plan (2006) conducted in 2011 allowed for public mountain biking and concessions for mountain biking operations on two additional specified routes: the Old Coach Road, and the track from the Desert Road to the Pillars of Hercules. A further partial review of the management plan conducted in 2018 provided for additional mountain biking options on future shared-use walking and mountain biking tracks through the park, on the routes Turoa to Ohakune, Ohakune to Horopito, and Horopito to National Park. The 2018 amendment also permitted the use of e-bikes on the approved routes.

==== Te Ara Mangawhero cycling and walking track ====
The first stage of Te Ara Mangawhero, a cycling and walking track between Mount Ruapehu and Ohakune, opened on 4 November 2024. The iwi Ngāti Rangi, the Department of Conservation and Ruapehu District Council collaborated to build the 11.4 km loop track which is expected to bring tourists to the area. The track passes through sub-alpine forest along an old bush tramway. Eventually the track is expected to extend towards Turoa ski field and form part of the Mountains to Sea trail from Mount Ruapehu down the Whanganui River to the sea.

=== Hazards ===
Recreational activities in Tongariro National Park, particularly in the alpine areas, come with some risk as visitors fall, get lost or are not prepared for sudden or severe weather changes in the alpine environment. There are memorials in the park to early visitors who lost their lives. Horace Holl is commemorated on a memorial near the Mangaturuturu Hut on the &#x27;Round the Mountain&#x27; track. Holl was a well-known climber and explorer who drowned in 1927 while leading a pack horse across a flooded river. The Stanton memorial, a plaque on a large rock in the Whakapapaiti Valley, commemorates 18-year-old Warwick Stanton who died in August 1931. Stanton was one of a group of 14 university students caught in bad weather on Mount Ruapehu. He left the party to seek help but did not survive. Only months after Stanton died, the Mountain Guides Act was enacted in November 1931 to license alpine guides, in an attempt to avoid similar tragedies in future.

Recent incidents include walkers dying of hypothermia in 2018 and 2019, a climber dying after a fall in 2020, and people dying in skiing accidents in 2022 and 2024. In 2017, a report produced by the Mountain Safety Council showed that out of all public conservation areas in New Zealand, Tongariro National Park had the most tramping-related search and rescue incidents.

Sudden weather changes have been responsible for several major incidents in the park. In 1990, six soldiers on a training exercise on Mount Ruapehu died when their group of 13 was stuck in a blizzard with inadequate supplies and insufficient shelter. In 2008, the Mangatepopo Canyon disaster occurred when six students and a teacher on an outdoor pursuits trip died after a thunderstorm caused a flash flood in a gorge on the Mangatepopo Stream in Tongariro National Park.

Air accidents in the park include 13 people killed when their plane went off course and crashed into Mount Ruapehu in 1948, and five people who died in a helicopter accident at Mount Ruapehu in 1982.

==== Volcanic hazards ====
Since Mounts Ruapehu, Tongariro and Ngauruhoe are active volcanoes, there is risk from eruptions or lahars. Skiers were evacuated from the ski fields in September 1995, when an eruption of ash and steam occurred. An eruption detection system operates in the ski areas on Mount Ruapehu, and will activate sirens and loudspeaker messages if necessary. Iwikau Village, as well as some ski lifts and cafés elsewhere on Whakapapa ski field, have been deemed to be safe from lahars, which flow down valleys. In 2007, a small eruption on Mount Ruapehu caused lahars, and one climber had a leg amputated after a boulder crashed through the alpine hut that he was in, trapping him.

On Mount Tongariro, the tracks including the Tongariro Alpine Crossing are closed if volcanic activity increases. In 2012, the Upper Te Maari Crater at Tongariro erupted, damaging huts and tracks. The Tongariro Alpine Crossing closed and did not fully reopen until May 2013 after volcanic activity had subsided.

Visitors are also at risk if they do not follow warning signs and instructions. In 2020, a tramper on the Tongariro Alpine Crossing was badly burned when he ventured too close to a steam vent to take photos and his leg went through the crust.

=== Historic sites ===
Several publicly-accessible historic sites can be visited within the park.
==== Waihohonu Hut ====
Waihohonu Hut is located on the north-east slope of Mount Ruapehu near the Desert Road. It was built by the Tourist and Health Resorts Department on its current site in 1904, was the first hut built in Tongariro National Park and is New Zealand&#x27;s oldest existing mountain hut. It was built to house tourists travelling to the park by coach, but use declined somewhat after the Main Trunk railway line was constructed at the other side of the park. The hut was used regularly until 1968, when it was replaced by a new hut with the same name, and since 1979 the original hut has been maintained as a historic site. It was registered as a Historic Place Category 1 by the Historic Places Trust (now Heritage New Zealand) in 1993.

==== Taonui Viaduct and Hapuawhenua Viaduct ====
The Taonui Viaduct (1907) and Hapuawhenua Viaduct (1908), located between Ohakune and Horopito, were constructed as part of the North Island Main Trunk railway line. Together they form a pair of large curved steel truss railway viaducts, which is unique in New Zealand. At 284m long, the Hapuawhenua Viaduct is the longest of the existing viaducts that were built on the NIMT (The Mangaweka Viaduct was longer, but was demolished in the 1980s). Both viaducts were in use until 1987, when the Horopito Deviation opened and a new, concrete Hapuawhenua Viaduct was built. The railway tracks on both old viaducts were lifted, and a walkway of old sleepers was created along the centre of the deck of the original Hapuawhenua Viaduct. The Hapuawhenua Viaduct was listed as a Historic Place Category 1 in 1995, and in 2009 the Taonui Viaduct was also listed as a Historic Place Category 1. In 2009, the newly conserved Hapuawhenua Viaduct opened to the public as a walking and cycling track.

==== Fergusson Cottage ====
Fergusson Cottage at Whakapapa Village was listed as a Historic Place Category 2 by Heritage New Zealand in 2005. It was built in 1924 and is the oldest extant structure in the village. As the third hut built in the area for visiting hikers and skiers, it was initially known as &#x27;No. 3 Hut&#x27; and was also known as &#x27;Ladies Hut&#x27;, accommodating women in mixed parties. After Lady Fergusson stayed there in August 1926, the hut&#x27;s name was changed to Fergusson Cottage. The cottage was later extended and modified several times. It was used as accommodation for Chateau Tongariro staff until 1993, when it became a café.
==== Chateau Tongariro ====

The Chateau Tongariro, also known as the Grand Chateau, was an opulent hotel built at Whakapapa Village by a subsidiary of the Mount Cook Tourist Company and opened in 1929 to serve the increasing number of visitors to Tongariro National Park. The New Zealand Government managed the hotel from 1932 until the 1980s. The hotel closed in 2023 due to being an earthquake risk. The building was listed as a Historic Place Category 1 by Heritage New Zealand in 1996, in recognition of its architecture, historical significance to the area and to international tourism to New Zealand, and its &quot;iconographic status&quot;.

==In popular culture==
A 1984 feature film, &quot;Wild horses&quot;, was filmed in the park. The plot centres around conflict between Kaimanawa horse wranglers, deer cullers and park rangers.

Peter Jackson shot scenes on Ruapehu for &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy including Mt Doom, Ithilien and Mordor. Locations at the Mangawhero River, Whakapapa ski field and Tukino ski field can be visited.

Mount Ngauruhoe was also featured in &quot;Hunt for the Wilderpeople&quot;.

Tongariro National Park landscapes were used as backgrounds for Queen Bavmorda&#x27;s castle in the 1988 film &quot;Willow&quot;.

<text>Ellen Jayne Wheeler (born October 9, 1961 in Glendale, California) is an American actress, director and producer. Her work, both on screen and in production, has been primarily in American daytime drama. 

== Early life and career ==
Wheeler&#x27;s parents both had a background in theater and entertainment; her father was an assistant director at MGM, while her mother was an actress. She was raised Mormon, and attended Brigham Young University to study acting.

Wheeler has appeared in several soap operas, including &quot;Another World&quot; and &quot;All My Children&quot;. In 1986, she won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series for her work as twins Marley and Vicky Love Hudson on &quot;Another World&quot;. In 1988, she won another Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her work as Cindy Parker Chandler on &quot;All My Children&quot;. Wheeler&#x27;s character was one of the first characters with AIDS on daytime television. Wheeler also made a memorable guest appearance as Phyllis Wicke in the 1991 primetime revival of the gothic soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;.

In 1996, she starred in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode, &quot;The Quickening&quot;.

In 1998, she briefly reprised the role of Marley on &quot;Another World&quot;. Rather than have the same actress play the role of both twins, the show made the decision to have Wheeler, the first actress to play the twins, portray Marley, and have actress Jensen Buchanan continue to play Vicky; their differences in appearance (other than a considerable height and build difference which were never addressed) were explained by plastic surgery after Marley was disfigured in a fire.

Wheeler was once married to her &quot;Another World&quot; costar, Tom Eplin. They were married during the time that their characters Vicky/Marley and Jake were involved.

==Directing and producing==
During the final season of &quot;Another World&quot;, Wheeler drew on her stage directorial experience and was invited by AW&#x27;s executive producer, Chris Goutman, to direct a few episodes of the show.

After the cancellation of &quot;Another World&quot; in 1999, she continued her focus on directing. While continuing to act, she directed several episodes of &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and finally became part of the directorial team at &quot;As the World Turns&quot;.

After two seasons with &quot;ATWT&quot;, Wheeler worked as an associate producer at another Procter &amp; Gamble serial, &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. She returned to &quot;ATWT&quot; and directed episodes of the show for several years, until she was appointed executive producer of &quot;Guiding Light&quot; in April 2004, a position she would hold until the final episode of the show in September 2009. Under her direction, the show named a new head writer, David Kreizman, and in 2008, she created a four-person head writing team; in addition to Kreizman, that team includes Lucky Gold, Chris Dunn and executive story editor (and eventual head writer) Jill Lorie Hurst.

In response to budget cuts and changing production methods, Wheeler led &quot;Guiding Light&#x27;s&quot; transition to a new filming method. The show moved away from traditional three-camera filming in a &quot;proscenium&quot; stage setting, and in early 2008 began to broadcast episodes that were recorded on digital cameras. The show rebuilt smaller, more realistic sets in its studio and utilized several other interior and exterior sets in a New Jersey town (adjacent to New York City, where GL is produced).

In 2007, Wheeler launched &quot;Guiding Light&quot;&#x27;s 70th anniversary (the longest running show in history) by volunteering her cast and crew on a charity and service campaign known as &quot;Find Your Light&quot;, encouraging viewers to participate alongside actors, directors and crew members in work for the homeless and other deserving groups and individuals across the country.

Despite Wheeler&#x27;s efforts to save the show, CBS cancelled the program on April 1, 2009. The final episode was broadcast on September 18, 2009.

<text>State Road 327 (SR 327) is a State Road in the north-eastern section of the state of Indiana. Running for about in a general north-south direction, connecting rural portions of DeKalb and Steuben counties. SR 327 was originally introduced in the early 1930s routed between Garrett and Corunna. The road was extended north to the Michigan state line in the mid-1930s. In the late 1960s the road was extended south to the city of Fort Wayne. This extension didn&#x27;t last by the mid-1970s the southern end of SR 327 was truncated to its current location at SR 205.

==Route description==

SR 327 starts at an all-way stop with SR 205, and two DeKalb county roads. It heads north as a two-lane highway passing through farmland. The route enters Garrett, concurrent with Randolph Street, and passes through a mix of commercial and residential properties. The highway passes through the Garrett Historic District, a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places. While in the historic district the road passes through the central business district before passing under CSX Railroad tracks. North of the railroad tracks the route leaves the historic district, while passes through residential properties. On the north side of Garrett SR 327 has a four-way stop at SR 8 before the road leaves Garrett. North of Garrett the road makes a sharp curve turning due west. The road has a second sharp curve turning back due north and heads towards Corunna. The route enter Corunna from the south and passes through residential properties. The highway passes over the Norfolk Southern Railroad tracks and has an intersection at U.S. Route 6 (US 6).

SR 327 turns west concurrent with US 6 as a two-lane highway, passing through commercial properties. After leaving Corunna, SR 327 turns north leaving US 6 and heads towards Helmer, the landscape becomes farms and fields. South of Helmer the road bends towards the west before curving towards the north and having an intersection with the western terminus of the eastern segment of SR 4. After SR 4 the road enters Helmer and crosses an Indiana Northeastern Railroad track. North of the railroad tracks the road passes through residential properties, before leaving Helmer. Past Helmer the route passes through rural farmland and an intersection at US 20. The highway enters Orland and passes through residential properties with a few commercial properties. After leaving Orland SR 327 passes Fawn River State Fish Hatchery, while passing through agriculture. South of the Michigan state line SR 327 passes under the Indiana Toll Road, before the SR 327 designation ends at the state line. While the SR 327 designation end at the state line the roadway continues north into Michigan as Rierson Road.

No part of SR 327 in Indiana is included in the National Highway System (NHS). The NHS is a network of highways that are identified as being important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. The highway is maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) like all other State Roads in the state. The department tracks the traffic volumes along all state roads as a part of its maintenance responsibilities using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. Between 2014 and 2015, INDOT figured that lowest traffic levels were 748 vehicles used the highway daily between Indiana Toll Road and Michigan state line. The peak traffic volumes were 7,956 vehicles AADT along the section of SR 327 at its concurrency with US 6.

==History==
SR 327 had its beginning in 1931 when it was designated from Garrett to Corunna. The route between Corunna and the Michigan state line was authorized in 1934. DeKalb County purchased the right-of-way for the road between Corunna and Helmer in 1935. The state highway commission constructed the section of road, between US 6 and Michigan state line, in 1936. During 1969 SR 327 was extended south to Interstate 69 in Fort Wayne, along former US 27. The entire roadway was paved between 1970 and 1971. The state highway commission truncated SR 327 south of Garrett at an intersection with SR 205 between 1974 and 1975.

<doc id="718230" wikidata="Q1075151" url="?curid=718230" title="Paparoa National Park">
<text>Paparoa National Park is on the west coast of the South Island of New Zealand.
The park was established in 1987 and encompasses . The park ranges from or near the coastline to the peaks of the Paparoa Range. A separate section of the park lies to the north and is centred at Ananui Creek. The park protects a limestone karst area. The park contains several caves, of which Metro Cave / Te Ananui Cave is a commercial tourist attraction. The majority of the park is forested with a wide variety of vegetation. The park was the site of the 1995 Cave Creek disaster where fourteen people died as a result of the collapse of a scenic viewing platform.

The Paparoa Track, one of New Zealand&#x27;s Great Walks, runs through the park.

The small settlement of Punakaiki, adjacent to the Pancake Rocks and Blowholes tourist attraction, lies on the edge of the park. The park is also located near the towns of Westport, Greymouth and Barrytown.

==History==
===Park establishment===
In 1976, the Federated Mountain Clubs had identified the northern part of the Paparoa Ranges as a potential wilderness area. In 1979, the Native Forest Action Council proposed a 130,000 hectare national park, including the northern Paparoa Ranges and land to the north and east. This eventually led to the National Parks and Reserves Authority identifying the western Paparoa Range as a prospective national park. Meanwhile, a joint proposal by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and the National Museum succeeded in having a core area of great ecological significance – the forests of the lowland karst syncline – gazetted as the Pororari Ecological Area in 1979.

The initial proposal for a large park incorporating the wilderness area was rejected, but after seven rounds of submissions and help from other environment groups including the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society, an area of 30,327 hectares was gazetted as Paparoa National Park on 23 November 1987.

===Expansion===
Following the liquidation of Pike River Coal, Solid Energy purchased the assets of the company. The government then purchased the of land around the Pike River Mine. The environment minister, Nick Smith, announced on 15 November 2015 that the 3,580 ha of land was to be added to the Park.

==Geography==
=== Location ===
Paparoa National Park is located in the northern West Coast region of the South Island, between the Buller River (Kawatiri) and the Grey River (Māwheranui). It includes the western side of the Paparoa Range and some separate eastern sections along the Inangahua River. The park covers the catchment areas of the Punakaiki, Pororari and Fox (Potikohua) rivers and Bullock Creek (Punungairo), and also the Metro / Te Ananui cave system and the southern side of the Tiropahi River catchment.

==Geology==
===Landforms===
The park has unusually diverse geology with a wide variety of coastal, lowland and mountain landforms. The major geological structures that form the park are the Barrytown syncline, the Punakaiki anticline, the Paparoa Tectonic Zone, the Cape Foulwind fault and the Hawera fault. Most of the land area of the park is mountainous. The eastern side of the main range has deep glaciated valleys that run north and south, with towering bluffs and cirques, hanging valleys, and truncated spurs. The western coastline is known for its spectacular and varied scenery and its accessibility.

=== Mountains ===
The Paparoa mountains were uplifted during the late Pliocene or early Quaternary periods. Mt Lodge, the highest mountain in the park at , has rocks that are the oldest in New Zealand. Over the last 10 million years, the movement of the Alpine Fault has separated the predominantly granite and gneiss rocks of the Paparoas from their original neighbours, so that they now more closely resemble the rocks in Fiordland, far to the southwest, than to the relatively nearby main range of the Southern Alps.

===Karst===
Rivers flowing from the Paparoa Ranges pass through the limestone syncline, creating subterranean waterways and extensive cave systems that are one of the features of the park. The main rivers are the Fox, Pororari and Punakaiki. Another of the rivers is Cave Creek, site of the 1995 Cave Creek disaster. Cave Creek is fed by a complex cave system.

Upstream of the Xanadu and Taurus Major sinkholes, on Bullock Creek (the most northerly on the west coast, others being near Ross and Fox Glacier), a polje of up to about square and deep can form after heavy rain. Bush felling and drainage took place in the polje from the 1870s, but the wetland ecology has been undergoing restoration since 1986. The other large polje in this country is at Lake Disappear in Waikato.

The river gorges, confined by high, forest-crowned limestone cliffs, provide a means of access to the park&#x27;s karst interior. However, in many of the tributaries the gorges are narrow, steep and include waterfalls. Dry, mossy streambeds, karren, sinkholes (or dolines), blind valleys and basins where water emerges from caves or vanishes into sinks are all indicators of the complex subterranean system beneath. Intricate systems of shafts, passages and caverns have been slowly formed by the continual effects of water through the soluble limestone. The forest ensures that this process continues by supplying decaying vegetation to add to the acidity in the flowing water. The largest single feature in the karst region is the Barrytown syncline. Limestone is exposed on both flanks of the syncline with more recent gravels and mudstones occupying the low-lying area in between. These more easily erodible rocks overlie interstratal karst. The majority of known cave systems are in the western side of the limestone syncline where underground drainage patterns are concentrated mainly along horizontal lines of weakness in the bedding planes.

===Coastal region===
The Paparoa coastline is characterised by high cliffs cut away by waves from the Tasman Sea, with indented coves and sandy beaches. There are small islands offshore and rock pillars. These terraces were once islands, which became part of the mainland when New Zealand was uplifted quite recently in its geological history. The most well known feature of the coastal region is the Pancake Rocks and Blowholes at Dolomite Point, near Punakaiki, where evenly layered stacks of platey limestone have been eroded in places to form surge pools and blowholes.

==Ecology==
===Fauna===
Bird habitats within the park range from on or near the coastline to the peak of the Paparoa Ranges. Several species such as tūī, bellbird, kākā, kererū (New Zealand pigeon) and parakeets migrate from winter habitat in the lower forests to summer habitat in the upland forests.

A significant feature of the coast is the colony of the rare seabird, the Westland petrel (tāiko), that is located on densely forested terraces just south of Punakaiki river. The Westland petrel breeding site at Punakaiki has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International.

Large colonies of New Zealand fur seals have been established adjacent areas around Westport such as at Cape Foulwind. Rare southern elephant seals and leopard seals also visit. Hector&#x27;s dolphins (some of the highest population densities in the nation) and some other dolphins including killer whales can be observed close to shores as well. For whales, their number is still very small, but various species have been observed.

==Conservation and human interaction==
===Protection from mining===
Although Paparoa National Park is protected from mining by Schedule 4 of the Crown Minerals Act, there have been proposals to allow some mining within the park&#x27;s borders. On 22 March 2010, Gerry Brownlee (Minister of Energy and Resources) and Kate Wilkinson (Minister of Conservation) released a discussion paper including a proposal to remove 7,058 hectares of land from Schedule Four of the Crown Minerals Act 1991, including the Inangahua sector of Paparoa National Park. The area of the Inangahua sector included in this proposal was 3,315 hectares, or 8 per cent of the park. The proposed change would remove the prohibition on mining for the area concerned. On 26 March 2010, a spokesman for Gerry Brownlee said that opencast mining in Paparoa National Park could not be ruled out.

On 20 July 2010, in a joint statement by Brownlee and Wilkinson, the Government announced that it had received 37,552 submissions on its discussion paper, and that it had decided not to remove any land from Schedule 4 of the Crown Minerals Act for the purposes of further mineral exploration or extraction. Ms Wilkinson said the government had agreed to continue with its proposal to add 14 areas with a total of 12,400 hectares of land to Schedule 4, including 240 hectares of Paparoa National Park (the northwest addition).

===Activities===
The park is a popular location for tramping, walking, and viewing scenery and caves. The Truman Track, located north of Punakaiki, provides access from to a headland via a short walk through coastal forest of ferns, nīkau palms, podocarps and rātā, with flax nearer the coastline. The Paparoa Track is another popular route.

==== Paparoa Track and Pike29 Memorial Track ====
A walkway, the Paparoa Track from Blackball to Punakaiki and the &quot;Pike29 Memorial Track&quot; were constructed through the park as a memorial to the 29 miners lost in the 2010 Pike River Mine disaster. Most of the families of the victims approved, but there has been some criticism because Solid Energy decided in 2014 that it was too risky to re-enter the mine to recover any remains from the mine.

The formation of the Paparoa Track has been a catalyst for the emerging adventure sports community on the West Coast with events such as The Paparoa which features trail running and mountain biking over the track. The event is based around the regions mining history and also celebrates the number of exceptional female adventure athletes the region has produced such as Casey Brown, Ruth Croft and Emily Miazga.

<doc id="718232" wikidata="Q1140031" url="?curid=718232" title="Guillermo Díaz (actor)">
<text>Guillermo Díaz (born March 22, 1975) is an American actor. He is known for films &quot;Half Baked&quot; (1998), &quot;200 Cigarettes&quot; (1999) and &quot;Stonewall&quot; (1995). He is best known for his role as Diego &quot;Huck&quot; Muñoz in the drama series &quot;Scandal&quot;. Díaz has made guest appearances on &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;Weeds&quot;, &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;Broad City&quot;, and &quot;Girls&quot;.

== Early life and career ==
Díaz was born in New Jersey to Cuban parents, and grew up in Washington Heights, Manhattan. In 1994, he landed his first speaking role as Spike in Boaz Yakin&#x27;s &quot;Fresh&quot;. From there he began working on &quot;Party Girl&quot; as Leo, Parker Posey&#x27;s roommate. His next role was a drag queen (La Miranda) in Nigel Finch&#x27;s &quot;Stonewall&quot;. In 1996, Díaz worked in Jim McKay&#x27;s &quot;Girls Town&quot; as Dylan, after which he appeared in &quot;I&#x27;m Not Rappaport&quot;.

Díaz played Paco de la Vega al Camino Cordoba Jose Cuervo Sanchez Rodriguez Jr., a high school gang member in &quot;High School High&quot;. He later appeared in &quot;Freeway&quot; as Flaco, another gang member. While in Los Angeles, he did guest spots on &quot;ER&quot; and &quot;Party of Five&quot;.

After finishing work on the West Coast, Díaz traveled back east to play a stoner named Eric in Brian Sloan&#x27;s film &quot;I Think I Do&quot;. A similar role followed as Scarface in the film &quot;Half Baked&quot;. One of his co-stars was Dave Chappelle, who later cast him in several episodes of &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot;. In 1999, he landed a non-verbal role in &quot;200 Cigarettes&quot;, and went on to act in both Ethan Hawke&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Chelsea Walls&quot; and the movie &quot;Just One Time&quot;, where as secondary characters one critic thought that he and Jennifer Esposito provided what little &quot;comic spark&quot; existed in the film.

Díaz played Guillermo García Gómez, a drug dealer/trafficker, in seasons 2-6 of the series &quot;Weeds&quot;. In 2009, he starred on the series &quot;Mercy&quot;, where his portrayal of the gay nurse Angel received negative criticism in online forums for being too flamboyant. In 2010, he appeared in the thriller film &quot;Exquisite Corpse&quot;.

After having portrayed several Mexican gangsters (cholos), Díaz was cast in 2010 as a Latino gangster named Poh Boy in &quot;Cop Out&quot;. When asked about being typecast, he said: &quot;I [used to worry], but not really anymore. Now I&#x27;m just grateful that I&#x27;m working. I try to make everything different.&quot;

In 2010, Díaz did a photoshoot for &quot;Pinups Magazine&quot;. The photoshoot featured full frontal nudity from Díaz.

In 2011, Díaz appeared alongside Britney Spears in a music video for the single &quot;I Wanna Go&quot;, and took part in a scene referencing his character Scarface from &quot;Half Baked&quot;.

=== &quot;Scandal&quot; ===

In 2012, Díaz began his main role as Huck in the drama series &quot;Scandal&quot;.

Díaz was one of the many celebrities that acted in Beyoncé and Jay Z&#x27;s video for &quot;Run&quot; in 2014.

== Personal life ==

Díaz is gay. In 2011, he told &quot;Out&quot; magazine that his rough upbringing in New York City, during which he hid his sexuality so as not to become a target, ultimately made him a better actor. He said: &quot;I went to school in the Bronx. I learned to constantly try to cover up the fact that I was gay. That façade of being somebody I&#x27;m really not just to protect myself definitely helped with acting.&quot; He was named one of &quot;Out&quot; Magazine&#x27;s 100 most influential gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender people for 2013.

Díaz has said on multiple occasions that he is a fan of Madonna. He has been to all of her tours apart from The Virgin Tour and The Who&#x27;s That Girl Tour. He also has her face tattooed on his right arm.

In November 2017, Díaz was nominated to &quot;Out&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;OUT100&quot; for 2017 in recognition of his work and his visibility.

==In popular culture==
In 2006, he joined the cast of a series of improv-based commercials for Sierra Mist titled &quot;Mist Takes&quot;. A Spanish version of the advertisements began airing, and the bilingual Díaz also starred in those with other Latino comedians.

<text>James Breuer (born June 21, 1967) is an American stand-up comedian, and actor. He was a cast member on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 1995 to 1998 and starred in the film &quot;Half Baked&quot; (1998).

==Career==
Breuer was a member of the cast of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 1995 to 1998, playing characters such as Joe Pesci and Goat Boy. He went on to host &quot;The Jim Breuer Show&quot; after leaving &quot;SNL&quot;.

Breuer regularly tours as a comedian. Footage of his 2008 tour was used in his documentary &quot;More Than Me&quot; and in his four-hour DVD program &quot;The Jim Breuer Road Journals&quot;. In September 2021, he cancelled shows at venues requiring COVID-19 vaccination in New Jersey and Michigan and has stated that he will not perform at venues with such requirements.

In 2023, Breuer appeared as a featured speaker on the ReAwaken America Tour. During one appearance, Breuer received backlash for mocking the collapse of football player Damar Hamlin; he suggested the collapse was caused by COVID-19 vaccines, echoing conspiracy theories in anti-vaccine circles.

==Personal life==
Breuer was born in Valley Stream, New York, and graduated in 1985 from Valley Stream Central High School.

From 2005 to 2021, he lived in Chester Township, New Jersey, with his wife Dee, whom he married in 1992, and their three daughters. In August 2021, Breuer and his family moved to Naples, Florida, after selling their home in New Jersey.

He describes himself as a &quot;superfan&quot; of the New York Mets.

<doc id="718242" wikidata="Q7797247" url="?curid=718242" title="Three-check chess">
<text>Three-check chess, also simply known as three-check, is a chess variant where a player can win by placing their opponent in check three times. Apart from this, standard rules of chess apply, including starting position and other ending conditions, such as stalemate and checkmate. A move is considered to give one check if the king is threatened, regardless if multiple pieces are checking the king. Three-check can be played over the board, but it is also popular on internet chess servers such as Chess.com and Lichess.

== History ==
It is unknown specifically where three-check chess originated, but David Pritchard, author of &quot;The Encyclopedia of Chess Variants&quot;, suspected Soviet origin, and noted that Anatoly Karpov was an &quot;invincible&quot; player of three-check chess in his youth. On Lichess, the three-check world championship is hosted yearly. Other strong players who have played three-check include grandmasters Maxime Vachier-Lagrave and Sergei Zhigalko.

== Strategy ==
Given that the game is quickly completed, and often not decided by checkmate, three-check players will frequently sacrifice pieces if they are guaranteed to achieve one or multiple checks on the king. Opening diagonals towards the king is inadvisable – 1. d4? allows the immediate 1... e5! taking advantage of white&#x27;s dark-squared weaknesses upon the a5-e1 diagonal.

International Master Daniel Rensch has written for Chess.com on strategical and tactical opportunities to be wary of while playing three-check:

* Keep the diagonals to one&#x27;s own king closed. Rensch recommends the Sicilian Defence, though warns of a deadly trap: 1. e4 c5 2. Bc4 Nc6?? 3. Bxf7+! Kxf7 4. Qh5+ and white delivers the third check on the next move.
* Remove one&#x27;s own king from an open file - although Rensch does not consider files to be as dangerous as diagonals in three-check, he mentions that &quot;open files are the quickest way for a winning position to become a lost one in three-check!&quot;
* Never allow consecutive checks, even if it means gaining material. The initiative in three-check is extremely powerful, and it is common to sacrifice several pieces to achieve multiple checks.
* A queen is especially powerful, because with few exceptions it is always able to get at least two consecutive checks. The exceptions are: the queen can be captured immediately; the queen is absolutely pinned against its own king and the line of the pin has no square from which the queen can give a followup check; or a cross-check achieved by a discovered check where the moving piece blocks the original check, and the queen cannot block the check or capture the checking piece with check (including when the cross-check is the third check for that player, and when the blocking move also absolutely pins the queen).

<text>The body of water named Lake Placid is located in the Adirondack Mountains in northern New York, the United States. It is on the northern side of the Village of Lake Placid.

==Geography==
The lake is approximately , and has an average depth of about . It is located in the towns of North Elba and St. Armand, both in Essex County.

There are three islands on Lake Placid, named Buck, Moose, and Hawk.

==Conservation==
The lake borders the northern part of the village of Lake Placid, and is a source of drinking water for the town. Maintaining water quality in the lake is a major local issue. The lake is fed by springs and Adirondacks mountain streams. There are nearly 300 houses on the lake shore. Because most of the houses are unoccupied much of the year, the water usually remains clean.

Local efforts to combat aquatic invasive species have been successful. They are supported by a boat cleaning station where powerboats are put into the water.

The lake has produced record lake trout.

<text>Lori Beth Denberg (born February 2, 1976) is an American actress and comedian. She is best known for her work as an original cast member of the Nickelodeon sketch comedy series &quot;All That&quot; and for her role as Lydia Liza Gutman on The WB sitcom &quot;The Steve Harvey Show&quot;.

==Early and personal life==
Denberg was born February 2, 1976, in the Northridge section of Los Angeles, California. She was raised in a Jewish family.

Denberg is an ordained minister.

She quit drinking in 2005.

==Career==
She began her career appearing on Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;All That&quot; (from 1994 to 1998), after graduating from high school. At 18, she was the oldest cast member. She appeared in the first three seasons of the Nickelodeon game show &quot;Figure It Out&quot; as a regular panelist (from 1997 to 1998), and then The WB&#x27;s &quot;The Steve Harvey Show&quot; (from 1998 to 2002).

On &quot;Figure It Out&quot;, Denberg had a knack for guessing the correct answer just before the contestant could win the grand prize, often even before the end of the second round, as her questions and guesses were more serious and better thought out, as opposed to the sillier questions and guesses that other panelists (particularly Kevin Kopelow and Danny Tamberelli) would give.

She appeared in the 1997 film &quot;Good Burger&quot; with fellow &quot;All That&quot; castmates Josh Server, Kenan Thompson, and Kel Mitchell. She had a minor role in the film &quot;&quot; in 2004, playing cheerleader Martha Johnstone. Denberg reunited with her &quot;All That&quot; cast members for the 2011 Comikaze Expo. She joked at the expo that she was now &quot;living out her old age.&quot; She made a brief cameo in a 2012 episode of &quot;Workaholics&quot; as herself.

In February 2018, she joined fellow &quot;All That&quot; castmates for a semi-reunion on the MTV show &quot;Wild &#x27;N Out&quot;, which aired the following month. She also appeared in an episode of &quot;Double Dare&quot; that pit Thompson against Mitchell to assist in the demonstration of physical challenges.

In December 2018, Denberg appeared in &quot;Discontinued&quot;, a special hosted by YouTube star Andre Meadows. The special looks at the rise and fall of the world&#x27;s most famous discontinued foods, toys, customs, and businesses.

Denberg returned as a recurring guest star in the 2019 revival of &quot;All That&quot;, reprising her Loud Librarian role and &quot;passing the torch&quot; as the host of Vital Information to new cast member Reece Caddell. She also made a cameo appearance playing Uno in the independent film &quot;Ham on Rye&quot; in 2019.

She competed on the twenty-fourth season of &quot;Worst Cooks in America&quot;, the show&#x27;s seventh celebrity edition titled &quot;That″s So ″90s&quot;, which aired in 2022.

In 2024, Denberg gave an interview to &quot;Business Insider&quot; in which she accused Dan Schneider, the creator of &quot;All That&quot; and several other Nickelodeon shows, of touching her inappropriately, showing her pornography, and attempting to initiate phone sex with her when she was 19. Denberg also accused Schneider of having her banned from the set of &quot;The Amanda Show&quot; in 1999 after she voiced concern for the well-being of the show&#x27;s star, her friend and former &quot;All That&quot; costar Amanda Bynes. Schneider denied much of the allegations, calling them “wildly exaggerated”.

<doc id="718252" wikidata="Q572391" url="?curid=718252" title="Punakaiki">
<text>Punakaiki is a small village on the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand. It is located between Westport and Greymouth on , the only through-road on the West Coast. Punakaiki is immediately adjacent to Paparoa National Park, and is also the access point for a popular visitor attraction, the Pancake Rocks and Blowholes.

== Location ==
Punakaiki is located on State Highway 6, and is north of Greymouth and south of Westport. Because State Highway 6 is the only through-road on the West Coast, a large number of visitors pass through the town.

The village is on the southern border of Buller District, where it meets Grey District, and lies on the edge of Paparoa National Park. To the north is the sheer bluff Perpendicular Point, known as Te Miko. The settlement sits to the south, by the Pororari Lagoon at the mouth of the Porarari River. To the south of the village is Dolomite Point, site of the Pancake Rocks, and Razorback Point at the mouth of the Punakaiki River. A feature of this part of the West Coast are the steep forested bluffs and cliffs of the Paparoa Range, descending several hundred metres to small beaches and sheer headlands, with occasional flats and terraces in between.

== History ==

The coastal caves and overhangs of the area bear traces of seasonal Māori occupation, and by the time Europeans arrived the area was the home of the Ngāti Waewae people, a hapū of Kāi Tahu, who traded much-prized pounamu.

Early European explorers navigating the coast encountered sheer cliffs at Te Miko, navigable only by climbing ladders totalling 46 feet high (or so Haast estimated) made of harakeke and rotting rātā vine. Charles Heaphy noted in 1846 that &quot;…as several of the rotten steps gave way under our feet, our position was far from being pleasant. A number of cormorants and other marine birds, too, that had their nests in the crevices of the rock were screaming and wheeling about us at the intrusion.&quot; During the gold rush of the 1860s these were replaced by chain ladders, soon known as &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;, but the wooden rungs were destroyed by overuse, and travellers slid down the chains instead or jammed sticks into the links.

There was, however, an inland trail crossing a higher terrace through rātā forest; prospector William Smart was guided through it by local Māori to avoid the &quot;rotten&quot; ladders. By October 1866, the authorities had cut a track to avoid the ladders, but it soon degenerated into a morass. In 1867, under-employed &quot;diggers&quot;(prospectors) were used to cut the &quot;Razorback Road&quot;, now known as the Inland Pack Track, to avoid the coast completely, heading up the Fox River, south through rough hill country, and emerging at the mouth of the Punakaiki River. The route which linked Cobden, north of Greymouth, with the gold workings at Brighton on the mouth of the Fox River, cost perhaps £10,000 and was completed by October 1867, but was not a success: it required too many river crossings that were difficult in times of flood, and after the gold rush ended and the diggers moved on it fell into disrepair. In January 1873, the &quot;Grey River Argus&quot; called the road &quot;perfectly useless&quot; and it was little-used after the 1870s.

Travellers who crossed Te Miko plateau stopped at the Pororari River lagoon, and waited for low tide to cross the mudflats (while avoiding quicksand). A dry limestone overhang on the north side of the lagoon was a convenient place to wait, and became known as the &quot;Post Office&quot;, because diggers would leave messages and carve their names into the walls. As late as 1931, graffiti like &quot;Sandy 1866&quot; and &quot;Hamilton Nov 20/65&quot; were still visible.

After crossing what is now the site of Punakaiki, the path continued over the Dolomite Point headland and descended to the Punakaiki River. Early travellers did not record or comment on the Pancake Rock formations, which are just 15 minutes from the track, and Māori did not appear to have highlighted them to early European explorers. Those heading south to the diggings at Canoe Creek still had to navigate the Razorback, navigating a narrow path between a deep chasm on one side and a sheer drop to the beach on the other. A vehicular road was not built here until 1929, finally connecting Greymouth and Westport.

In 2018, the remnants of Cyclone Fehi caused severe damage to the road immediately north of Dolomite point. Improvements costing $7.8 million were completed by Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency to provide more resilience to this section of State Highway 6.

== Population ==
There are fewer than 100 permanent residents, but the village has been host to at least 500,000 visitors in some years.

== Wildlife and conservation ==
Located on the edge of the Paparoa National Park, Punakaiki has a diverse range of birdlife and marine wildlife. Fur seals are seen on the rocks and Hector&#x27;s dolphins close to the shore. Birds seen in the area include blue penguin, blue shag, black shag, Australasian gannet, white-faced heron, weka, kererū, tūī, bellbird, fantail, grey warbler, and tomtit.

The Westland petrel has its only known breeding colonies close to Punakaiki. The breeding range is in forest-covered coastal foothills in an 8 kilometre wide strip between Barrytown and Punakaiki, specifically between the Punakaiki River and Waiwhero (Lawson) Creek. These colonies were established in the middle of the 18th century. The Department of Conservation designated the colony area as the Westland Petrel Special Protected Area in 1999 and access by the public is restricted. There is a breeding colony located on private land, where guided tours of the colony are available.

Limestone caves in the Punakaiki area preserved animal fossils dating back 25,000 years which help us visualize the fauna of the Otira Glaciation period. This fauna includes a variety of large and smalls (including moas), amphibians, reptiles, and potentially bats and kiwi.

Local conservation efforts include the Punakaiki Coastal Restoration Project which was started by the Department of Conservation, aluminum production company Rio Tinto, and Conservation Volunteers in 2009. The project covers 40 ha and is 4 km south of Punakaiki. The intention is to restore the Sand Forest Flats and provide a forest to sea corridor. The land is owned by the Department of Conservation.

== Climate ==
Located on the West Coast of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, Punakaiki has an oceanic climate with prevailing westerlies, which accounts for the strong maritime influence on the local climate and the high annual rainfall, amplified by the Paparoa Range immediately to the east. Mean minimum temperatures throughout the year are higher than any other West Coast location, giving the Punakaiki area a distinct lack of frost; no month has a mean temperature below 10 °C (50 °F), lending a subtropical note to the climate.

== Tourism ==

In the period immediately before the COVID-19 pandemic, around 500,000 visitors each year passed through Punakaiki, and most stopped at Dolomite Point to walk out and view the Pancake Rocks and Blowholes. The peak visitor numbers were around 6,000 a day. Overseas visitors made up 92% of the business at the local Punakaiki tavern, and 85% at the Punakaiki campground. The large number of visitors to the small village has put a strain on local infrastructure, and requires levels of investment that cannot be funded by the small number of ratepayers. Some of the main concerns were the inadequate provision of car parks and toilet facilities to meet demand at peak times.

There had also been concerns from the local community about the behaviour and impact of &quot;freedom campers&quot; – those who stay the night in their cars or campervans in a public place, rather than the campground. In 2016, residents petitioned the Buller District and Grey District councils for a ban on freedom camping in the town, but this appeal was not successful.

On 19 March 2020, all New Zealand&#x27;s borders and entry ports were closed to non-residents in response to the pandemic. Staged re-opening of the borders did not begin until February 2022. With New Zealand&#x27;s borders being closed for such an extended period, local tourism operators in Punakaiki had to adjust to lower volumes, and to refocus on attracting domestic visitors.

In January 2022, the campground operators reported that they had been fully booked over the Christmas holiday season, with most of the visitors from the South Island, and many coming to do the Paparoa Track. However, tourism operators reported major reductions in bookings for the period after the summer school holidays.

=== Visitor centre ===

The Paparoa National Park visitor centre is located at Dolomite Point, opposite the entrance to the Pancake Rocks &amp; Blowholes.

In September 2020, as part of an economic stimulus in response to the pandemic, the Government announced a grant from the Provincial Growth Fund for redevelopment of visitor facilities at Punakaiki. The $26 million project included a new visitor centre, Department of Conservation (DOC) information centre, community meeting room, and offices for the local hapū, Ngāti Waewae. There was also funding for a highway crossing and car park, and a walking and cycling path to improve accessibility for visitors. One unusual aspect of the plans for the &quot;Experience Centre&quot; was a green roof. Seeds and seedlings of around a dozen species chosen for the roof were gathered from the local area and 11,000 plants were raised in a Conservation Volunteers New Zealand nursery at Barrytown Flats for subsequent establishment on the roof of the building. There was controversy in 2021 about the decision to transfer the facility to Ngāti Waewae on completion, and plans for charging visitors for entry to the &quot;Experience Centre&quot;. A ceremony to mark the start of construction on the new visitor cente was led by Ngāti Waewae on 28 May 2022.

=== Pancake Rocks ===

The Pancake Rocks are a very popular tourist destination at Dolomite Point south of the main village. From a visitor centre and cafe a wheelchair-navigable path leads to the stylobedded pancake rock formations and central Putai Blowhole, which spouts spectacularly at high tide and during a south-westerly swell.

=== Punakaiki cavern ===

One of the nearby attractions in Punakaiki is an easily accessible cavern. There is around of passageways, with stalactites and glow worms. The cavern is located just off State Highway 6, around north of the visitor centre.

=== Walks in the local area ===
Popular local walks in the Punakaiki area include:
* Pancake Rocks and Blowholes
* Truman Track
* Pororari River
* Punakaki River, and a Pororari River loop via the Inland Pack Track
* Pororari River, and a Bullock Creek loop via the Inland Pack Track
* Cave Creek / Kotihotiho Memorial Track

Punakaiki also provides access to the Paparoa Track, a , 2–3 day mountain bike or tramping track that crosses the Paparoa Range. The track is the tenth New Zealand Great Walk to be created, and has been fully open since 1 March 2020.

<text>The Obelisco de Buenos Aires (Obelisk of Buenos Aires) is a national historic monument and icon of Buenos Aires. Located in the Plaza de la República in the intersection of avenues Corrientes and 9 de Julio, it was erected in 1936 to commemorate the quadricentennial of the first foundation of the city.

==History==

Construction began on March 20, 1936, and it was finished on May 23 of the same year. It was designed by architect Alberto Prebisch (one of the main architects of the Argentine modernism who also designed the Teatro Gran Rex, in Corrientes and Suipacha) at the request of the mayor Mariano de Vedia y Mitre (appointed by president Agustín Pedro Justo). For its construction, which cost 200,000 pesos moneda nacional, of concrete and of Olaen white stone from Córdoba were used.

The obelisk was built by the German company G.E.O.P.E. - Siemens Bauunion - Grün &amp; Bilfinger, which completed its work in a record time of 31 days, with 157 workers. The rapid hardening Incor cement was used and was built in sections of to facilitate the dumping of concrete.

Its height is , and of these are up to the initiation of the apex, which is . The tip is blunt, measuring and ends in a lightning rod that cannot be seen because of the height; its cables run through the interior of the obelisk.

It has only one entrance (on its west side) and on its top there are four windows, that can only be reached by a straight staircase of 206 steps with 7 breaks every .

On February 20, 1938, Roberto María Ortiz succeeded Justo as president and appointed Arturo Goyeneche as the new mayor of the city. In June 1939, the city council sanctioned the demolition of the &quot;Obelisco&quot;, citing economic, aesthetic and public safety reasons. However, the ordinance was vetoed by the municipal executive power, characterizing it as an act without merit and juridical content, because it alters the state of things emanated by the executive power, and that it was a monument under the jurisdiction and custody of the Nation and is part of its heritage.

Where the Obelisk stands, there was a church dedicated to St. Nicholas of Bari; it was demolished. In that church the Argentine flag was officially hoisted for the first time in Buenos Aires, in 1812. That fact is noted in one of the inscriptions on the north side of the monument.

As a result of the detachments of sheets of stone covering, which occurred on the night of June 20–21, 1938, the day after a public event with the presence of president Ortiz took place there. It was decided to remove such cladding in 1943 and was replaced by another one made of polished cement, making cracks to simulate the joints of the stones. When the slabs were removed, a legend that said &quot;Its architect was Alberto Prebisch&quot; was also removed.

In 1973, it was decorated as a Christmas tree. In 1975, during the Peronist government of Isabel Perón, a ring-shaped rotating sign was hung around the obelisk, with the motto &quot;El silencio es salud&quot; (Silence is health). Although it was allegedly geared against motorists creating excessive noise, it was widely interpreted as a statement calling Argentines to refrain from expressing their political views.

Throughout its history, the monument has suffered vandalism, especially politically oriented graffiti. In the 1980s, an activist group broke in and spilled paint from the top windows, causing the city government to erect a fence around its base in 1987. This move stirred controversy, but eventually proved effective in reducing the number of defacing incidents.

On 1 November 2005 it was announced that a comprehensive restoration, financed by the Argentine painting and restoration industry association (Ceprara), was finished. The monument was painted with 90-micrometre acrylic paint to a &quot;Paris stone&quot; hue, deemed more pleasant than the previously used white.

On December 1, 2005, the obelisk was covered by a giant pink condom to commemorate the World AIDS Day.

To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the La Noche de los Lápices, the monument was converted into a giant pencil.
Lines B, C, and D of the Buenos Aires Metro have stations near the monument, and are connected by a number of underground passages with commercial galleries.

The Obelisco hosted the opening ceremony of the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics.

== Inscriptions on its sides ==
At the base of the south face, in a very small rectangle, this sonnet written by Baldomero Fernández Moreno during a tribute dinner in the Alvear Palace Hotel to Prebisch:

::::&quot;El Obelisco&quot;

::::&quot;¿Donde tenía la ciudad guardada&quot;
::::&quot;esta espada de plata refulgente&quot;
::::&quot;desenvainada repentinamente&quot;
::::&quot;y a los cielos azules asestada?&quot;

::::&quot;Ahora puede lanzarse la mirada&quot;
::::&quot;harta de andar rastrera y penitente&quot;
::::&quot;piedra arriba hacia el Sol omnipotente&quot;
::::&quot;y descender espiritualizada.&quot;

::::&quot;Rayo de luna o desgarrón de viento&quot;
::::&quot;en símbolo cuajado y monumento&quot;
::::&quot;índice, surtidor, llama, palmera.&quot;

::::&quot;La estrella arriba y la centella abajo,&quot;
::::&quot;que la idea, el ensueño y el trabajo&quot;
::::&quot;giren a tus pies, devanadera.&quot;

English version:

::::&quot;The Obelisk&quot;

::::&quot;Where did the city keep&quot;
::::&quot;this shining silver sword&quot;
::::&quot;[that was] suddenly unsheathed&quot;
::::&quot;and into the blue skies thrusted?&quot;

::::&quot;Now you may take a look&quot;
::::&quot;[it] tired of walking low and penitent&quot;
::::&quot;stone up towards the omnipotent Sun&quot;
::::&quot;and descend spiritualized.&quot;

::::&quot;Moonbeam or wind tear&quot;
::::&quot;in immobile symbol and monument&quot;
::::&quot;index, fountain, flame, palm tree.&quot;

::::&quot;The star above and the spark below,&quot;
::::&quot;that the idea, the dream and the work&quot;
::::&quot;[may] turn at your feet, winder.

<text>The Australian Business Number (ABN) is a unique 11-digit identifier issued by the Australian Business Register (ABR) which is operated by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). The ABN was introduced on 1 July 2000 by John Howard&#x27;s Liberal government as part of a major tax reform, which included the introduction of a GST.

The law requires each entity that carries on a business in Australia has an ABN and that the ABN appear on each tax invoice and other tax related documents issued by the entity.

The Australian Business Register (ABR) is maintained by the Registrar of the ABR, who is also the Commissioner of Taxation. The Registrar registers entities, issuing them with an ABN, while the Commissioner of Taxation issues the entity a tax file number.

==Entitlement to an ABN==
The Registrar issues ABNs only to entities that are entitled to an ABN, which can be:
* an individual,
* a body corporate,
* a corporation sole,
* a body politic,
* a partnership,
* any other unincorporated association or body of persons,
* a trust, or
* a superannuation fund.

For an entity to be entitled to an ABN, it must:
* carry on an enterprise in Australia, or
* carry on an enterprise that makes supplies connected with Australia, or
* be a company registered under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).

Whether or not an entity is carrying on an enterprise is a question of fact and there are many circumstances where an entity will be carrying on an enterprise. Without being exhaustive, an entity will be carrying on an enterprise if it:
* is in the form of a business,
* leases property,
* is a religious institution,
* is a superannuation fund,
* is an arm of the government, or
* is a charity.

The Registrar can refuse an entity&#x27;s application to be registered. Equally, the Registrar can cancel an entity&#x27;s registration and thus their ABN. Each of these decisions are reviewable taxation decisions.

==Applying for an ABN==
An entity can apply for an ABN:

* online through the Australian Business Register portal,
* using the services of a registered tax agent, or
* lodging a paper-based application with the ATO.

Before applying for an ABN the entity must have a tax file number (TFN).

==Format==
The ABN is an 11-digit number where the first two digits are a checksum. Unlike with the tax file number (TFN), the ATO has publicised the formula for checking and creating valid ABN checksums. Also, the nature of the ABN algorithm means that any 9-digit number can be made into a valid ABN.

In the case of companies, the ATO determines the ABN by using the company&#x27;s Australian Company Number (ACN) to which the two-digit checksum is prefixed.

<doc id="718273" wikidata="Q289076" url="?curid=718273" title="Design for Six Sigma">
<text>Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) is a collection of best-practices for the development of new products and processes. It is sometimes deployed as an engineering design process or business process management method. DFSS originated at General Electric to build on the success they had with traditional Six Sigma; but instead of process improvement, DFSS was made to target new product development. It is used in many industries, like finance, marketing, basic engineering, process industries, waste management, and electronics. It is based on the use of statistical tools like linear regression and enables empirical research similar to that performed in other fields, such as social science. While the tools and order used in Six Sigma require a process to be in place and functioning, DFSS has the objective of determining the needs of customers and the business, and driving those needs into the product solution so created. It is used for product or process &quot;design&quot; in contrast with process &quot;improvement&quot;. Measurement is the most important part of most Six Sigma or DFSS tools, but whereas in Six Sigma measurements are made from an existing process, DFSS focuses on gaining a deep insight into customer needs and using these to inform every design decision and trade-off.

There are different options for the implementation of DFSS. Unlike Six Sigma, which is commonly driven via DMAIC (Define - Measure - Analyze - Improve - Control) projects, DFSS has spawned a number of stepwise processes, all in the style of the DMAIC procedure.
DMADV, define – measure – analyze – design – verify, is sometimes synonymously referred to as DFSS, although alternatives such as IDOV (Identify, Design, Optimize, Verify) are also used. The traditional DMAIC Six Sigma process, as it is usually practiced, which is focused on evolutionary and continuous improvement manufacturing or service process development, usually occurs after initial system or product design and development have been largely completed. DMAIC Six Sigma as practiced is usually consumed with solving existing manufacturing or service process problems and removal of the defects and variation associated with defects. It is clear that manufacturing variations may impact product reliability. So, a clear link should exist between reliability engineering and Six Sigma (quality). In contrast, DFSS (or DMADV and IDOV) strives to generate a new process where none existed, or where an existing process is deemed to be inadequate and in need of replacement. DFSS aims to create a process with the end in mind of optimally building the efficiencies of Six Sigma methodology into the process &quot;before&quot; implementation; traditional Six Sigma seeks for continuous improvement &quot;after&quot; a process already exists.

==DFSS as an approach to design==
DFSS seeks to avoid manufacturing/service process problems by using advanced techniques to avoid process problems at the outset (e.g., fire prevention). When combined, these methods obtain the proper needs of the customer, and derive engineering system parameter requirements that increase product and service effectiveness in the eyes of the customer and all other people. This yields products and services that provide great customer satisfaction and increased market share. These techniques also include tools and processes to predict, model and simulate the product delivery system (the processes/tools, personnel and organization, training, facilities, and logistics to produce the product/service). In this way, DFSS is closely related to operations research (solving the knapsack problem), workflow balancing. DFSS is largely a design activity requiring tools including: quality function deployment (QFD), axiomatic design, TRIZ, Design for X, design of experiments (DOE), Taguchi methods, tolerance design, robustification and Response Surface Methodology for a single or multiple response optimization. While these tools are sometimes used in the classic DMAIC Six Sigma process, they are uniquely used by DFSS to analyze new and unprecedented products and processes. It is a concurrent analyzes directed to manufacturing optimization related to the design.

===Critics===
Response surface methodology and other DFSS tools uses statistical (often empirical) models, and therefore practitioners need to be aware that even the best statistical model is an approximation to reality. In practice, both the models and the parameter values are unknown, and subject to uncertainty on top of ignorance. Of course, an estimated optimum point need not be optimum in reality, because of the errors of the estimates and of the inadequacies of the model. The uncertainties can be handled via a Bayesian predictive approach, which considers the uncertainties in the model parameters as part of the optimization. The optimization is not based on a fitted model for the mean response, E[Y], but rather, the posterior probability that the responses satisfies given specifications is maximized according to the available experimental data.
Nonetheless, response surface methodology has an effective track-record of helping researchers improve products and services: For example, George Box&#x27;s original response-surface modeling enabled chemical engineers to improve a process that had been stuck at a saddle-point for years.

==Distinctions from DMAIC==
Proponents of DMAIC, DDICA (Design Develop Initialize Control and Allocate) and Lean techniques might claim that DFSS falls under the general rubric of Six Sigma or Lean Six Sigma (LSS). Both methodologies focus on meeting customer needs and business priorities as the starting-point for analysis.

It is often seen that the tools used for DFSS techniques vary widely from those used for DMAIC Six Sigma. In particular, DMAIC, DDICA practitioners often use new or existing mechanical drawings and manufacturing process instructions as the originating information to perform their analysis, while DFSS practitioners often use simulations and parametric system design/analysis tools to predict both cost and performance of candidate system architectures. While it can be claimed that two processes are similar, in practice the working medium differs enough so that DFSS requires different tool sets in order to perform its design tasks. DMAIC, IDOV and Six Sigma may still be used during depth-first plunges into the system architecture analysis and for &quot;back end&quot; Six Sigma processes; DFSS provides system design processes used in front-end complex system designs. Back-front systems also are used. This makes 3.4 defects per million design opportunities if done well.

Traditional six sigma methodology, DMAIC, has become a standard process optimization tool for the chemical process industries.
However, it has become clear that the promise of six sigma, specifically, 3.4 defects per million opportunities (DPMO), is simply unachievable after the fact. Consequently, there has been a growing movement to implement six sigma design usually called design for six sigma DFSS and DDICA tools. This methodology begins with defining customer needs and leads to the development of robust processes to deliver those needs.

Design for Six Sigma emerged from the Six Sigma and the Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control (DMAIC) quality methodologies, which were originally developed by Motorola to systematically improve processes by eliminating defects. Unlike its traditional Six Sigma/DMAIC predecessors, which are usually focused on solving existing manufacturing issues (i.e., &quot;fire fighting&quot;), DFSS aims at avoiding manufacturing problems by taking a more proactive approach to problem solving and engaging the company efforts at an early stage to reduce problems that could occur (i.e., &quot;fire prevention&quot;). The primary goal of DFSS is to achieve a significant reduction in the number of nonconforming units and production variation. It starts from an understanding of the customer expectations, needs and Critical to Quality issues (CTQs) before a design can be completed. Typically in a DFSS program, only a small portion of the CTQs are reliability-related (CTR), and therefore, reliability does not get center stage attention in DFSS. DFSS rarely looks at the long-term (after manufacturing) issues that might arise in the product (e.g. complex fatigue issues or electrical wear-out, chemical issues, cascade effects of failures, system level interactions).

==Similarities with other methods==
Arguments about what makes DFSS different from Six Sigma demonstrate the similarities between DFSS and other established engineering practices such as probabilistic design and design for quality. In general Six Sigma with its DMAIC roadmap focuses on improvement of an existing process or processes. DFSS focuses on the creation of new value with inputs from customers, suppliers and business needs. While traditional Six Sigma may also use those inputs, the focus is again on improvement and not design of some new product or system. It also shows the engineering background of DFSS. However, like other methods developed in engineering, there is no theoretical reason why DFSS cannot be used in areas outside of engineering.

==Software engineering applications==

Historically, although the first successful Design for Six Sigma projects in 1989 and 1991 predate establishment of the DMAIC process improvement process, Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) is accepted in part because Six Sigma organisations found that they could not optimise products past three or four Sigma without fundamentally redesigning the product, and because improving a process or product after launch is considered less efficient and effective than designing in quality. ‘Six Sigma’ levels of performance have to be ‘built-in’.

DFSS for software is essentially a non superficial modification of &quot;classical DFSS&quot; since the character and nature of software is different from other fields of engineering. The methodology describes the detailed process for successfully applying DFSS methods and tools throughout the software product design, covering the overall Software Development life cycle: requirements, architecture, design, implementation, integration, optimization, verification and validation (RADIOV). The methodology explains how to build predictive statistical models for software reliability and robustness and shows how simulation and analysis techniques can be combined with structural design and architecture methods to effectively produce software and information systems at Six Sigma levels.

DFSS in software acts as a glue to blend the classical modelling techniques of software engineering such as object-oriented design or Evolutionary Rapid Development with statistical, predictive models and simulation techniques. The methodology provides Software Engineers with practical tools for measuring and predicting the quality attributes of the software product and also enables them to include software in system reliability models.

==Data mining and predictive analytics application==

Although many tools used in DFSS consulting such as response surface methodology, transfer function via linear and non linear modeling, axiomatic design, simulation have their origin in inferential statistics, statistical modeling may overlap with data analytics and mining,

However, despite that DFSS as a methodology has been successfully used as an end-to-end [technical project frameworks ] for analytic and mining projects, this has been observed by domain experts to be somewhat similar to the lines of CRISP-DM

DFSS is claimed to be better suited for encapsulating and effectively handling higher number of uncertainties including missing and uncertain data, both in terms of acuteness of definition and their absolute total numbers with respect to analytic s and data-mining tasks, six sigma approaches to data-mining are popularly known as DFSS over CRISP [ CRISP- DM referring to data-mining application framework methodology of SPSS ]

With DFSS data mining projects have been observed to have considerably shortened development life cycle . This is typically achieved by conducting data analysis to pre-designed template match tests via a techno-functional approach using multilevel quality function deployment on the data-set.

Practitioners claim that progressively complex KDD templates are created by multiple DOE runs on simulated complex multivariate data, then the templates along with logs are extensively documented via a decision tree based algorithm

DFSS uses Quality Function Deployment and SIPOC for feature engineering of known independent variables, thereby aiding in techno-functional computation of derived attributes

Once the predictive model has been computed, DFSS studies can also be used to provide stronger probabilistic estimations of predictive model rank in a real world scenario

DFSS framework has been successfully applied for predictive analytics pertaining to the HR analytics field, This application field has been considered to be traditionally very challenging due to the peculiar complexities of predicting human behavior.

<doc id="718274" wikidata="Q7634547" url="?curid=718274" title="Suffolk County Community College">
<text>Suffolk County Community College (SCCC) is a public community college in Selden, New York. It is part of the State University of New York (SUNY) system and is funded in part by Suffolk County, New York. Suffolk County Community College was founded in 1959 and has three campuses: Selden, Brentwood and Riverhead. It also has a satellite center in downtown Riverhead.

The school was founded largely through the efforts of Albert Ammerman who was the college&#x27;s president from its founding in December 1959 until 1983. In its first year it had 13 faculty with 171 full-time students at the Sachem High School in Ronkonkoma and 335 part-time students at Riverhead High School until what is now called the Ammerman campus opened in 1962 in the former Suffolk County Tuberculosis Sanatorium (originally built in 1912). By 1977 it had opened a campus in Riverhead and one on the edge of the Pilgrim Psychiatric Center in Brentwood.

==Academics==
The college offers the Associate in Arts (A.A.), Associate in Science (A.S.), and Associate in Applied Science (A.A.S.) degree, as well as a variety of certificate programs. Many students transfer to four-year colleges and universities to complete their baccalaureate degree after attending SCCC. Suffolk is now also partnered with Cornell University through the Pathways to Success Program which allows transfers directly into Cornell degree programs. Suffolk is also partnered with Stony Brook University and typically allows students with a 3.0 GPA and 24 credit hours to transfer.

==Campuses==

===Ammerman Campus===
The Ammerman campus at Selden opened in 1961. It is the largest, first, and main campus of Suffolk County Community College. Located off of Nicolls Road, it has become a landmark of Suffolk County. The main campus is the home to the majority of the sports teams as well. The site was previously a tuberculosis sanitarium.

Only two of the sanitorium&#x27;s buildings remain (both of which were built by the Works Progress Administration in the 1930s)—Ammerman Building (the former William Hugh Ross Building for male patients) and Kreiling Hall (the former J.H. Marshall Building for children). School officials deny a persistent rumor that the basement of the Kreiling Hall was used as a morgue noting that the walk-in refrigerators there were used for a cafeteria. As of 2008 only three of the 10,000 Norway spruce and Scotch pine trees that landscaped the sanitarium&#x27;s grounds remain.

===Eastern Campus===
The Eastern campus at Riverhead (actually in the hamlet of Northampton in the Town of Southampton with a Riverhead postal address) opened in 1977 on Speonk-Riverhead Road (CR 88), next to Riverhead-Moriches Road (CR 51). The Eastern campus is the college&#x27;s smallest. The Eastern campus has hiking trails that are utilized by some athletic courses.

===Michael J. Grant Campus===
The Michael J. Grant campus at Brentwood opened in 1974 and is the college&#x27;s fastest growing. Bordered by Wicks Road, Community College Drive, and Crooked Hill Road (CR 13), the Grant campus is the sole home of the lacrosse, men&#x27;s &amp; women&#x27;s track &amp; field, men&#x27;s &amp; women&#x27;s bowling, and men&#x27;s &amp; women&#x27;s indoor track teams.

===Downtown Sayville===
The Sayville Downtown Center opened in 2006 and closed in 2023.

===Downtown Riverhead===
This satellite center is home to The Culinary Arts and Hospitality Center. It opened in 2008. The campus features a cafe that serves breakfast and lunch.

==Athletics==
The college&#x27;s athletics program is a component of the college&#x27;s co-curricular offerings. SCCC is a member of the National Junior College Athletic Association. Athletics take place on both the Ammerman and Grant campuses. Men&#x27;s Intercollegiate sports teams include baseball, basketball, cross-country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, and tennis. Women&#x27;s teams include soccer, basketball, cheerleading (co-ed), dance (co-ed), cross-country, swimming, softball, tennis, and volleyball. In addition, the office coordinates an intramural program for men and women.

In the 2003 the men&#x27;s basketball team won the NJCAA Men&#x27;s Division III Basketball Championship and the women&#x27;s basketball team won the NJCAA Women&#x27;s Basketball Division III Championship. The men repeated as champs in 2004.

In 2005 the women&#x27;s soccer team was formed, where they placed first during the regular season in division III, region 15. Five members of the team made all region first team players- Angela F. Merante, DiAnna G. Dezego, Jaclyn A. Ciamillo, Jacqueline Papile, and Vanessa Thompson. Komi Afeto, their coach, was named coach of the year.

==Art galleries==

Suffolk County Community College has student exhibition galleries on each of its three main campuses. The gallery on the Ammerman Campus is the Maurice N. Flecker Memorial Gallery, located in the Southampton Building. The Lyceum Gallery, on the Eastern Campus features local and regional artists as well as student works. Gallery West, is located on The Michael J.Grant Campus and features an annual regional high school exhibition as well as student work.

==Honor societies==
SCCC has two honor societies, Phi Theta Kappa (ΦΘΚ) and Alpha Beta Gamma (ΑΒΓ).

===Phi Theta Kappa (ΦΘΚ)===
PTK membership is based primarily upon academic achievement.

<text>State Road 9 in the U.S. State of Indiana is a long north–south state highway in the eastern portion of Indiana. Its southern terminus is near Columbus at State Road 46, and the northern terminus is at the Michigan/Indiana border between Howe, Indiana, and Sturgis, Michigan, where it continues as M-66.

Some of Indiana 9 is divided highway and even freeway, but Interstate 69 largely supplants it as all but a regional route between Huntington and Anderson.

== Route description ==

=== Columbus to Shelbyville ===
SR 9 heads north from its southern terminus at State Road 46 (SR 46). SR 9 passes through Hope on the way to the eastern terminus of the western section of State Road 252 (SR 252). North of SR 252, SR 9 heads northeast then northwest toward Shelbyville. SR 9 enters Shelbyville from the south and has an intersection with State Road 44 (SR 44).

=== Shelbyville to Anderson ===
North of SR 44, SR 9 continues into downtown Shelbyville and then continues north passing over Interstate 74/U.S. Route 421. SR 9 heads north toward Greenfield, in Greenfield SR 9 has an intersection with U.S. Route 40 and an interchange with Interstate 70. Then SR 9 heads north toward Pendleton. In Pendleton SR 9 has a concurrency with U.S. Route 36 and State Road 67. Then SR 9 merges onto interstate 69 before the concurrency ends at the next exit. Then SR 9 heads north toward downtown Anderson, passing Harrah&#x27;s Hoosier Park Racing and Casino.

Then SR 9 has an intersection with State Road 26, just west of Fairmount. Then SR 9 enters Marion, where SR 9 has an intersection with U.S. Route 35/State Road 22 followed by an intersection with State Road 37. Then just south of downtown Marion SR 9 has a concurrency with State Road 15. In downtown Marion SR 9 and SR 15 has an intersection with State Road 18. Then north of downtown Marion SR 15 turns northwest toward Wabash and SR 9 turns northeast toward Huntington. On the way to Huntington SR 9 passes near Mt. Etna. Then SR 9 enters Huntington on the southwest side of town.

=== Huntington to Columbia City ===
SR 9 bypasses Huntington on the west side of town, concurrent with U.S. Route 24. On the northeast side of Huntington US 24 and SR 9 have an intersection with U.S. Route 224 and State Road 5. Then SR 9 leaves the bypass on the north side of Huntington and heads north towards Columbia City, passing through an intersection with State Road 114 and State Road 14. SR 9 enters Columbia City on the south side of town. After it enters Columbia City SR 9 has a concurrency with State Road 205. The concurrency ends in downtown Columbia City at Old U.S. Route 30, where SR 205 turns east.

=== Columbia City to Michigan ===
SR 9 heads north out of downtown Columbia City. Before leaving Columbia City SR 9 has an intersection with U.S. Route 30. SR 9 heads north passing through an intersection with U.S. Route 33 and passing near Chain O&#x27;Lakes State Park. Then SR 9 enters Albion on the south part of town. In downtown Albion SR 9 has an intersection at the western terminus of State Road 8. SR 9 heads north out of Albion, then SR 9 has a concurrency with U.S. Route 6.

Before the Michigan state line, SR 9 passes through an intersection with State Road 120 in Howe. Then just south of the Michigan state line, SR 9 has an intersection with the Indiana Toll Road (Interstate 80/Interstate 90). Then SR 9 crosses into Michigan as M-66 heading north toward Sturgis.

==History==
From 1917 to 1926 the current route of SR 9 was known as State Road 11. With the SR 9 given to a route that went from Linton to Brazil and a second section from Rockville to Old State Road 10.

== Explanation of nickname ==
The nickname of State Road 9 is Highway of Vice Presidents, from Shelbyville to Columbia City. The reason for the name is that four of Indiana&#x27;s six Vice Presidents lived in cities along the route:
*Thomas A. Hendricks — Grover Cleveland&#x27;s Vice President (1885) from Shelbyville
*Thomas R. Marshall — Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s Vice President (1913–1921) from Columbia City
*J. Danforth Quayle — George H.W. Bush&#x27;s Vice President (1989–1993) from Huntington
*Michael R. Pence - Donald J. Trump&#x27;s Vice President (2017—2021) from Columbus

Indiana&#x27;s other two vice presidents are also honored by the highway nickname:
*Schuyler Colfax — Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s Vice President (1869–1873) from South Bend
*Charles W. Fairbanks — Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Vice President (1905–1909) from Indianapolis

<doc id="718279" wikidata="Q1545315" url="?curid=718279" title="Home Taping Is Killing Music">
<text>&quot;Home Taping Is Killing Music&quot; was the slogan of a 1980s anti-copyright infringement propaganda campaign by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), a British music industry trade group. With the rise in cassette recorder popularity, the BPI feared that the ability of private citizens to record music from the radio onto cassettes would cause a decline in record sales. The logo, consisting of a Jolly Roger formed from the silhouette of a compact cassette, also included the words &quot;And It&#x27;s Illegal&quot;. The campaign was officially launched by then-BPI chairman Chris Wright on 28 October 1981.

An early proponent of home taping was Malcolm McLaren, who was at the time managing the British new wave band Bow Wow Wow. In 1980, the band released their cassette single &quot;C·30 C·60 C·90 Go&quot; on cassette that featured a blank B-side on which the buyer could record their own music. 

In the 2000s, the campaign experienced a revival, as the Norwegian branch of IFPI (International Federation of the Phonographic Industry) launched a new campaign named Piracy Kills Music. The campaign has exactly the same message, same name and similar logos. The campaign won the Norwegian 2008 Gulltaggen award for &quot;Best Internet Strategy&quot; with much controversy.

== Parodies ==
The slogan was often parodied, one example being the addendum &quot;and it&#x27;s about time too!&quot;, used by Dutch anarcho-punk band the Ex. Some fanzines changed the words from &quot;Home taping is killing the music industry&quot; and added the words &quot;...so be sure to do your part!&quot; below the logo. Another example was the early 1980s counter-slogan &quot;Home Taping is Skill in Music&quot;, referring to early mixtapes, a precursor to sampling and remixes. The cassette &amp; crossbones image was displayed briefly as a backdrop in the &quot;Time Out for Fun&quot; video by the band Devo from their 1982 album, &quot;Oh, No! It&#x27;s Devo&quot;. Venom&#x27;s 1982 album &quot;Black Metal&quot; used the logo with the words &quot;Home Taping Is Killing Music; So Are Venom&quot;. The phrase &quot;Home-Taping Is Making Music&quot; appears on the back cover of Peter Principle&#x27;s self-produced 1988 album &quot;Tone Poems&quot;. The American punk band Rocket from the Crypt sold T-shirts with the tape and bones and the words &quot;Home Taping Is Killing the Music Industry: Killing Ain&#x27;t Wrong.&quot; Sonic Youth has T-shirts with the cassette and &quot;Sonic Youth&quot; written under it. The cover of Billy Bragg&#x27;s album &quot;Workers Playtime&quot; featured a notice reading &quot;Capitalism is killing music – pay no more than £4.99 for this record&quot;. Mitch Benn also comments &quot;Home taping isn&#x27;t killing music, music&#x27;s dying of natural causes&quot; in the song &quot;Steal This Song&quot; on the album &quot;Radioface&quot;. In Poland during the mid-1980s, some (PRONIT label) vinyl pressings of certain albums contained a parody stamp labeled &quot;Home taping... is much fun&quot;.

One cassette version of the Dead Kennedys e.p. &quot;In God We Trust Inc.&quot; had a blank side, printed with the message &quot;Home taping is killing record industry profits! We left this side blank so you can help.&quot;

During the 1980s, rock group the Beat sold blank cassette tapes as merchandise at their live shows. The band frequently encouraged fans and concert patrons to record their live performances instead of illegally copying their studio albums. The group&#x27;s leader, Paul Collins, believed this practice would satisfy a need for instant gratification while preventing the sales of their albums from diminishing. 

La Route du Rock biannual music festival in France uses the tape image as part of the event&#x27;s logo.
More recently, the pro-p2p file sharing group Downhill Battle has used the slogan &quot;Home Taping Is Killing the Music Industry, and It&#x27;s Fun&quot; on T-shirts, and the BitTorrent website &quot;The Pirate Bay&quot; uses the logo of a pirate ship whose sails bear the &quot;tape and bones.&quot; Additionally the Pirate Party UK has a version of the tape and bones with the logo &quot;copyright is killing music – and it&#x27;s legal&quot; and the Swedish Piratbyrån is using the same tape and bones as their logo.

Similar rhetoric has continued; in 1982 Jack Valenti famously compared the VCR and its anticipated effect on the movie industry to the Boston Strangler, and in 2005 Mitch Bainwol of the RIAA claimed that CD burning is hurting music sales.

In March 2010, TalkTalk, as part of its campaign against the UK Government&#x27;s filesharing proposals, created a spoof video entitled &quot;Home Taping is Killing Music&quot;. The song was written and performed by singer/songwriter Dan Bull and featured lookalikes of Madonna, George Michael and Adam Ant lip-synching to the song.

<text>Hermann Nitsch (29 August 1938 – 18 April 2022) was an Austrian contemporary artist and composer. His art encompassed wide-scale performances incorporating theater, multimedia, rituals and acted violence. He was a leading figure of Viennese Actionism.

== Life ==
Born in Vienna, Nitsch received training in painting when he studied at the Wiener Graphische Lehr-und Versuchanstalt, during which time he was drawn to religious art. He is associated with the Vienna Actionists—a loosely affiliated group of Austrian artists interested in transgressive themes and the centrality of the body in their artwork, which also includes Günter Brus, Otto Muehl, and Rudolf Schwarzkogler.

Nitsch&#x27;s abstract &#x27;splatter&#x27; paintings, like his performance pieces were inspired by his neutral perspective on humanity and being human. In the 1950s, Nitsch conceived of the &quot;Orgien Mysterien Theater&quot; (which roughly translates as &quot;Theatre of Orgies and Mysteries&quot; or &quot;The Orgiastic Mystery Theater&quot;) and staged nearly 100 performances between 1962 and 1998.

In 1966 he was with Yoko Ono, Gustav Metzger, Günter Brus, Otto Muehl, Wolf Vostell, Juan Hidalgo, and others, as a participant of the &quot;Destruction in Art Symposium&quot; (&quot;DIAS&quot;) in London.

== Art ==
In 1962, together with Otto Muehl and Adolf Frohner, he performed the three-part action “The Blood Organ” in Vienna, for which a joint manifesto was published. At the beginning of the 1960s, he developed the main ideas for his &quot;Orgie Mysterien Theater.&quot; Nitsch&#x27;s &quot;Orgien Mysterien Theater&quot; performances (or &quot;Aktionen&quot;, as he called them) can be considered to have been both ritualistic and existential. The scene often involved slaughters, religious sacrifices, and crucifixion, as well as blood and flesh. The performances were also accompanied by music, dancing, and active participants. In his first &quot;Orgie Mysterien Theater&quot; performance, Nitsch and his friends used animal carcasses, entrails, and blood similarly to a ritual. The cloths, bandages, and other fabrics used in these performances introduced Nitsch to the idea of making paintings.

From 1971 on Nitsch organized his “Orgy-Mystery Games” at the Prinzendorf Castle area he acquired, including the high point of his life&#x27;s work, the great “6-Day Game” in the summer of 1998, directed by Alfred Gulden.

In 1972, Nitsch participated in Documenta 5 in Kassel, curated by Harald Szeemann; he was also represented at Documenta 7 in 1982. In 1975, Marina Abramović took part in a Nitsch performance. In addition upon occasion Christoph Schlingensief also participated in the work of Nitsch.

Nitsch was repeatedly invited to bring his conceptions of art and ritual to the opera. In 1995, he co-directed the Vienna State Opera and created the sets and costumes for Jules Massenet&#x27;s opera Hérodiade. In 2001, Nitsch was responsible for the stage design and costumes for the performance of the Gandhi opera Satyagraha by the American composer Philip Glass in the Festspielhaus St. Pölten in Lower Austria. In 2005, he created the equipment for Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s Le Renard. In 2007, he directed the scenes from Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; by Robert Schumann at the Zurich Opera House. In 2011 he was responsible for the scenic conception, design, stage design, and costumes for Saint François d’Assise by Olivier Messiaen at the Bavarian State Opera in Munich.

Nitsch&#x27;s worldview was strongly influenced by mystical authors, but also by de Sade, Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, and Antonin Artaud, among others. In his theoretical book Orgien-Mysterien-Theater, Nitsch stated that his actions and images should first cause disgust in the audience, then catharsis. The combining of real animal carcasses and real blood with religious content such as the crucifixion and the Immaculate Conception were consciously used by Nitsch in order to bring the viewer to reflect on symbolic topoi such as blood and death that are often repressed in everyday life, which also play a central role in Christianity. Christian viewers and numerous critics perceived his actions and works as blasphemy.

In addition to his theater of orgies and mysteries, Nitsch was also active as a composer and writer. His actions are noted in meticulously notated scores which, in addition to instructions and texts, also contain graphically notated pieces of music.

Because he offended not only animal rights activists, but also theologians and representatives of public morality, his work is highly controversial. Conversely, some action and performance artists, including former comrades-in-arms, distance themselves from what they consider to be the overly religious element of his work. In terms of content, his art at Prinzendorf Castle can certainly be interpreted as an attempt at a counter to Richard Wagner&#x27;s Bayreuth.

From November 1988 to January 1989, the Städtische Galerie in the Lenbachhaus in Munich showed some of the artist&#x27;s works as part of the solo exhibition &quot;Nitsch - Das Bildnerische Werk&quot;.

He performed the &quot;2-day game&quot; campaign in summer 2004. On 19 November 2005, the 122nd action of the Orgies-Mysteries-Theater took place at Vienna&#x27;s Burgtheater as part of the 50th anniversary celebrations for the reopening after World War II.

On 24 May 2007, the “Hermann Nitsch Museum” was opened in the Mistelbach Museum Center, which led to protests among parts of the Mistelbach population. In Naples on 13 September 2008, Nitsch&#x27;s long-time gallery owner Peppe Morra opened a museum dedicated exclusively to Nitsch&#x27;s work, the “Museo Archivio Laboratorio per le Arti Contemporanee Hermann Nitsch”, which was set up in a former power station.

In the Weinviertel, not far from his Prinzendorf Castle, Nitsch owned a vineyard. The yields from it are pressed according to traditional standards and filled into double-liter bottles. Since the 2006 vintage, the Nitsch-Doppler, whose label Hermann Nitsch artistically redesigned every year, has been presented to the public in Vienna.

In 2010 Nitsch created a series of Limited Edition Prints, presenting his 130. Aktion at the Museo Nitsch in Napoli with the Dutch artist Rene Rietmeyer.

&quot;&quot;UNDER MY SKIN&quot;” This book is the documentation of Personal Structures Art Projects #02. Published by European Cultural Centre.

He exhibited his works during the 2017 Venice Biennale at the European Cultural Centre.

Most recently, in 2020, 80 current works were shown at the Museum Mistelbach in the exhibition &quot;Hermann Nitsch - New Works&quot;. After the color red, which he used earlier in his artistic work, and after the color yellow - the color of light and resurrection - Nitsch used bright colors in his late creative days. His endeavor was to bring sounds, tastes, and tactile sensations onto the canvas with his own hands. He was inspired by peonies and other flowers. His late work has an optimistic and life-affirming effect through the floral color symphonies and the transcendent lightness. [15]

== Art market ==
Nitsch&#x27;s estate is represented by Pace Gallery (since 2022) and Galerie Kandlhofer.

== Controversy ==
Because of their intense and graphic nature, often using nude performers and blood, Nitsch was subject to several court trials with charges of gross public indecency, and even sentences of three prison terms, because of his artworks. It has been suggested by critics that his work may exemplify certain peoples&#x27; fascination with, and desensitization to, violence.

==Plot==
The film opens with workmen installing a phone booth in the middle of a square. Later, a man takes his son to the school bus. He enters the phone booth to make a call and the door slowly closes behind him. The man realizes that the phone does not work, so he tries to leave, only to discover that the door is stuck. He tries desperately to get it open, but nothing works.

Eventually two business men come by and try to help him out, but to no avail. This gathers the attention of many passers-by who begin to congregate and watch the action. Several people (including a strong man, a repair man and a police officer) try to open the door but it remains stuck. Eventually a firefighter is just about to try to break open the glass roof of the phone booth when the phone booth company appears. They unbolt the booth and take it away on their truck, with the man still inside it. The crowd cheers and waves him away.

The man watches frantically as he is carted across town. He tries to scream for help from people but everyone, apart from some dwarves, just smile and wave. There are allusions to his fate along the way, with a dwarf holding a ship in a bottle and a glass coffin containing a corpse being mourned. Eventually the truck stops next to another truck also carrying a man stuck in a phone booth. The two men try to communicate but cannot. After many hours the truck arrives at a massive underground warehouse. The phone booth is lifted up in the air by a giant magnet and the truck drives away. The phone booth is carried by a forklift through the warehouse, which is full of phone booths containing decaying remains of other trapped citizens. The man struggles in fear but cannot escape. The forklift drops him and leaves. The man looks to his right and sees the trapped man he saw on his way to the warehouse, who has strangled himself with the telephone cord. In other booths lie corpses in various states of decay. The man collapses out of frame in despair. The film ends with the phone booth company setting up a similar booth in the same park.

<doc id="718302" wikidata="Q348534" url="?curid=718302" title="3000 Miles to Graceland">
<text>3000 Miles to Graceland is a 2001 American action comedy film directed and co-produced by Demian Lichtenstein. The original script was written by Richard Recco and Demian Lichtenstein shares a co-writing credit on the final film. The film stars Kurt Russell, Kevin Costner, Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Bokeem Woodbine, Christian Slater, Kevin Pollak and Daisy McCrackin.

&quot;3000 Miles to Graceland&quot; was released in the United States on February 23, 2001, by Warner Bros. Pictures and Morgan Creek Productions. The film received mostly negative reviews by the critics and was a box office bomb making only $18.7 million against its $47.4 million budget.

==Plot==

Recent parolee Michael Zane stops at a run-down desert motel outside Las Vegas, Nevada. He catches a boy, Jesse, stealing from his car, and chases him back to his mother, Cybil Waingrow, whom he seduces.

The following morning, four men arrive to pick up Michael: Murphy, Hanson, Gus, and Franklin. Dressed in Elvis costumes, the group goes to Las Vegas and rob the Riviera, which is holding an Elvis convention. A firefight breaks out and Franklin is killed during their escape.

Back at the motel, Hanson and Murphy argue about Franklin&#x27;s share until Murphy shoots Hanson. Michael hides the money in the attic, unaware that Jesse is watching him. The three remaining thieves drive into the desert to bury Hanson. Murphy returns alone after shooting Gus and Michael, but hits a coyote and crashes his car, knocking him unconscious before he reaches the motel.

Michael was wearing a bulletproof vest and survived the shooting by playing dead. He makes his way back to the motel and discovers that the money is missing. Guessing that Jesse is responsible, he storms into Cybil&#x27;s place and finds the money. He tries to bribe Cybil to forget the situation but eventually agrees to take Cybil and Jesse with him.

Michael explains that the money is marked, but says Murphy knows a money launderer in Idaho who can help. Murphy, realizing that Michael has taken the money, drives to Idaho to intercept him. At a restaurant, Cybil steals Michael&#x27;s wallet and sneaks away from Michael and Jesse. She takes Michael&#x27;s car and calls the money launderer, Peterson, using a password she found in Michael&#x27;s wallet. Murphy appears at the money launderer&#x27;s premises using the same password. Peterson explains that Cybil called first, so they wait for her.

Cybil arrives and finds Murphy, who she assumes is Peterson. Michael and Jesse arrive later in a stolen car and find the premises empty except for the bodies of Peterson and his secretary. Jesse guesses that Murphy has his car and Michael reports it stolen, causing Murphy to be arrested. The police discover that Michael is also driving a stolen car and arrest him as well. The men are put in adjoining cells and have a confrontation.

Jesse helps Michael make bail after Michael agrees to make him his partner. Murphy calls a man named Jack who helps him make bail. Michael retrieves his car and finds Cybil tied up and gagged in the trunk. Murphy is picked up while hitchhiking, then kills the driver and steals his clothes and vehicle.

Cybil and Jesse drive by. Murphy runs them off the road, and takes Jesse hostage, telling Cybil to find Michael and the money. Cybil begs Michael for help. After some persuasion, Michael decides to help and reports Murphy to the authorities.

Michael meets Murphy at a warehouse with the money and convinces him to release Jesse. As Murphy realizes that the bag is full of cut-up newspaper instead of money, he is stung by a scorpion that Michael hid inside.

A SWAT team surrounds the warehouse. Murphy pretends to surrender but grabs a gun and shoots Michael. A gunfight ensues. Murphy refuses to surrender and is killed by police. An ambulance takes Michael for medical care but is stolen by Cybil and Jesse. Once again, Michael wore a bulletproof vest and was only slightly injured. The three escape together and are seen on Michael&#x27;s boat, the &quot;Graceland.&quot;

==Cast==

<doc id="718303" wikidata="Q9562555" url="?curid=718303" title="Acacia baileyana">
<text>Acacia baileyana or Cootamundra wattle is a shrub or tree in the flowering plant family Fabaceae. The scientific name of the species honours the botanist Frederick Manson Bailey. It is indigenous to a very small area in southern inland New South Wales, comprising Temora, Cootamundra, Stockinbingal and Bethungra districts. However, it has been widely planted in other Australian states and territories. In many areas of Victoria, it has become naturalised and is regarded as a weed, outcompeting indigenous Victorian species.

Almost all wattles have cream to golden flowers. The small flowers are arranged in spherical to cylindrical inflorescences, with only the stamens prominent. Wattles have been extensively introduced into New Zealand.

== Uses ==

&quot;A. baileyana&quot; is used in Europe in the cut flower industry. It is also used as food for bees in the production of honey. American urban landscape designer Renée Gunter uses this plant in her South Los Angeles lawn as a drought-resistant alternative to thirstier plants.

Less than 0.02% alkaloids were found in a chemical analysis of &quot;Acacia baileyana.&quot;

==Cultivation==
This plant is adaptable and easy to grow. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. Unfortunately, it has an ability to naturalise (i.e. escape) into surrounding bushland. Also, it hybridises with some other wattles, notably the rare and endangered Sydney Basin species &quot;Acacia pubescens&quot;.

A prostrate weeping form is in cultivation. Its origin is unknown, but it is a popular garden plant, with its cascading horizontal branches good for rockeries. The fine foliage of the original Cootamundra wattle is grey-green, but a blue-purple foliaged form, known as &#x27;Purpurea&#x27; is very popular.

==Use of colour==
The colour Cootamundra wattle is used currently by the Australian Capital Territory Fire Brigade as their colour scheme for firefighting appliances.

<text>Double Falsehood (archaic spelling: Double Falshood) or The Distrest Lovers is a 1727 play by the English writer and playwright Lewis Theobald, although the authorship has been contested ever since the play was first published, with some scholars considering that it may have been written by John Fletcher and William Shakespeare. Some authors believe that it may be an adaptation of a lost play by Shakespeare and Fletcher known as &quot;Cardenio&quot;. Theobald himself claimed his version was based on three manuscripts of an unnamed lost play by Shakespeare.

==Sources==
The 1727 play is based on the &quot;Cardenio&quot; episode in Miguel de Cervantes&#x27;s &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, which occurs in the first part of the novel. The author of the play appears to know the novel through Thomas Shelton&#x27;s English translation, which appeared in 1612. Theobald&#x27;s play changes the names of the main characters from the Spanish original: Cervantes&#x27; Cardenio becomes Julio, his Lucinda becomes Leonora; Don Fernando is turned into Henriquez, and Dorothea into Violante.

==Authorship==
Publisher Humphrey Moseley was the first to link &quot;Cardenio&quot; with Shakespeare: the title page of his edition of 1647, entered at the Stationers&#x27; Register on 9 September 1653, credits the work to &quot;Mr Fletcher &amp; Shakespeare&quot;. In all, Moseley added Shakespeare&#x27;s name to six plays by other writers, attributions which have always been received with scepticism.

Theobald&#x27;s claim of a Shakespearean foundation for his &quot;Double Falshood&quot; met with suspicion, and even accusations of forgery, from contemporaries such as Alexander Pope, and from subsequent generations of critics as well. Nonetheless, Theobald is regarded by critics as a far more serious scholar than Pope, and as a man who &quot;more or less invented modern textual criticism&quot;. The evidence of Shakespeare&#x27;s connection with a dramatization of the Cardenio story comes from the entry in the Stationers&#x27; Register, but Theobald could not have known of this evidence, &quot;since it was not found until long after his death&quot;. There appears to be agreement among scholars that the 18th century &quot;Double Falsehood&quot; is not a forgery, but is based on the lost &quot;Cardenio&quot; of 1612–13, and that the original authors of &quot;Cardenio&quot; were John Fletcher and possibly William Shakespeare.

In March 2010, The Arden Shakespeare published &quot;Double Falsehood&quot;, with a &quot;Note on this Edition&quot; stating that the edition &quot;makes its own cautious case for Shakespeare&#x27;s participation in the genesis of the play,&quot; followed with speculations regarding how such a case might, in an imagined future, either be &quot;substantiated beyond all doubt&quot; or &quot;altogether disproved&quot;. Arden editor, Brean Hammond, in the introduction, states that recent analysis based on linguistics and style &quot;lends support&quot; to the idea that Shakespeare and Fletcher&#x27;s hand can be detected in the 18th century edition. Hammond then expresses the hope that his edition &quot;reinforces the accumulating consensus that the lost play has a continuing presence in its eighteenth-century great-grandchild.&quot; Author and critic Kate Maltby cautions against promoting &quot;Double Falsehood&quot; with exaggerated statements. She points out that nowhere does the Arden editor of &quot;Double Falsehood&quot; make the &quot;grandiose claim&quot; found on advertisements for a production of the play that invite people to come and &#x27;Discover a Lost Shakespeare&#x27;. She points out that if a young person sees a production of &quot;Double Falsehood&quot;, and is told it is by Shakespeare, they may come away with the &quot;lifelong conviction that &#x27;Shakespeare&#x27; is pallid and dull.&quot;

In 2015, Ryan L. Boyd and James W. Pennebaker of the University of Texas at Austin published research in the journal &quot;Psychological Science&quot; that reported statistical and psychological evidence suggesting Shakespeare and Fletcher may have coauthored &quot;Double Falsehood&quot;, with Theobald&#x27;s contribution being &quot;very minor&quot;. By aggregating dozens of psychological features of each playwright derived from validated linguistic cues, the researchers found that they were able to create a &quot;psychological signature&quot; (i.e., a high-dimensional psychological composite) for each authorial candidate. These psychological signatures were then mathematically compared with the psycholinguistic profile of &quot;Double Falsehood&quot;. This allowed the researchers to determine the probability of authorship for Shakespeare, Fletcher, and Theobald. Their results challenge the suggestion that the play was a mere forgery by Theobald. Additionally, these results provided strong evidence that Shakespeare was the most likely author of the first three acts of &quot;Double Falsehood&quot;, while Fletcher likely made key contributions to the final two acts of the play.

==Performance and publication==

The play was first produced on 13 December 1727 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and published in 1728. The drama was revived at Covent Garden on 24 April 1749, and performed again on 6 May that year. Later performances occurred in 1781 and 1793, and perhaps in 1770 also. After the first edition of 1728, later editions appeared in 1740 and 1767.

===Modern revivals===
A new edition of the play was published in March 2010 in the Arden Shakespeare series. In January 2011 this version, advertised as by &quot;William Shakespeare and John Fletcher&quot;, was presented at the Union Theatre, Southwark, by theatre company MokitaGrit, director Phil Willmott. Wilmott, while praising the &quot;flashes of psychological insight&quot; in the work, found himself unconvinced by the attribution to Shakespeare, noting the absence of comic interludes, the play&#x27;s uncharacteristic structure and, above all, the absence of &quot;heart-stopping moments of poetry&quot;. Certainly some typical Shakespearean plot elements, such as women disguised as men, a disaffected younger brother and a switch from scenes at court to one in the country are to be found, but the possibility remains that these were included by another as an &quot;homage&quot; to Shakespeare&#x27;s style, or as a deliberate attempt to deceive. The critic Lyn Gardner found the work stageworthy, but also doubted the attribution, observing that it was &quot;more of a curiosity than a classic&quot;.

In April 2011 the Royal Shakespeare Company presented a version of &quot;Double Falsehood&quot; as &quot;&quot;Cardenio&quot;, Shakespeare&#x27;s &#x27;lost play&#x27; re-imagined.&quot; The text included &quot;restored&quot; elements of the plot based on Cervantes. The production received good reviews, but the critic Michael Billington believed that it was more suggestive of Fletcher than Shakespeare.

In August 2012, the Hudson Shakespeare Company of New Jersey staged an adaptation of &quot;Double Falsehood&quot; as part of their summer outdoor Shakespeare in the Parks season billing the show as &quot;&quot;Cardenio&quot;, the lost Shakespeare&quot;. While the basic script adhered to the same structure of &quot;Double Falsehood&quot;, director Jon Ciccarelli modified the character names to match up with their Cervantes counterparts along with adding scenic material, music, stage combat choreography and dance to further flesh out the central Cardenio story.

In 2012 Terri Bourus directed a production of Gary Taylor&#x27;s &quot;unadaptation&quot; of &quot;Cardenio&quot;, an attempt to reverse Theobald&#x27;s alterations of the original. Taylor&#x27;s text along with detailed evidence supporting the view that Theobald had used the original playscript was published in a collection of essays the following year.

As part of their 2024 season, Shakespeare by the Sea produced a new adaptation of &quot;Cardenio&quot; by Jonathan Fisher and Anna Miles, using an adapted text of &quot;Double Falsehood&quot; and adding a new frame story that follows Fletcher and Shakespeare&#x27;s collaboration in composing the play.

==Cast==
The 1728 edition provided a cast list for the main speaking parts in the original production:

The play&#x27;s minor roles, of servants, messengers, and others, were omitted from the &quot;dramatis personae&quot;.

The cast&#x27;s Wilks and Booth were Robert Wilks and Barton Booth, both prominent actors of their generation. The Mrs. Booth who played Violante was the former Hester Santlow; Mary Porter played Leonora.

==Synopsis==
The play is set in &quot;the province of Andalusia in Spain&quot;. The opening scene introduces Duke Angelo and his elder son and heir, Roderick. Roderick is the dutiful and virtuous son; the Duke also has a younger son, Henriquez, a scapegrace and prodigal who is absent from the ducal court, pursuing his own interests. Henriquez has just written his father a letter, requesting gold to buy a horse; Henriquez will send his friend Julio to court to receive payment. The Duke and Roderick decide to use Julio for their own purposes: they will detain him at court &quot;some few days...and assay to mould him / An honest spy&quot; upon Henriquez&#x27;s &quot;riots&quot;.

Julio&#x27;s father Camillo is not happy about his son&#x27;s mission to court. Julio wants to arrange a marriage with Leonora; his intended bride is agreeable, and the call to court delays Julio&#x27;s plan to obtain the consent of both their fathers. Julio leaves Henriquez behind him to further his suit with Leonora, a foolish trust. Henriquez has developed an infatuation with Violante, a beautiful and virtuous local girl of humble birth; she rejects his inappropriate solicitations. Henriquez forces himself upon her. Afterward, confronting his guilty conscience over his &quot;brutal violence&quot;, Henriquez tries to convince himself that his act wasn&#x27;t a rape, with the feeble rationalization that Violante did not cry out, however much she struggled physically.

His pangs of guilt do not prevent Henriquez from pursuing another scheme: in Julio&#x27;s absence he is courting Leonora. (Henriquez admits in a soliloquy that he sent Julio away with this in mind. His pursuit of both Violante and Leonora is the &quot;double falsehood&quot; of the title.) The young woman is appalled and repelled by this, but her father Don Bernard wants the family connection with the nobility that their marriage will produce. Leonora sends a letter to Julio, and he returns in time to frustrate the wedding. Julio challenges Henriquez with his sword but is overwhelmed and ejected by Bernard&#x27;s servants; Leonora faints and is carried out. Bernard discovers a dagger and a suicide note on his daughter&#x27;s person, revealing her final determination to resist the forced marriage.

Julio and the two young women, each in a distraught state of mind, depart mysteriously; the fathers Camillo and Bernard are left to confront their own distress. Roderick arrives, and comforts the two old men. Their unhappiness works something of a reversal in each man&#x27;s character: the formerly mild Camillo hardens his nature, while the formerly harsh Bernard dissolves in tears.

In Act IV the scene shifts from court and town to the wilds where the shepherds keep their flocks. Violante has disguised herself as a boy, and has become a servant to a master shepherd. Julio is also in the neighborhood, wandering distractedly, fighting with shepherds and stealing their food. The Master shepherd is a rare character in traditional English drama, who can actually recognize a woman when she&#x27;s disguised as a boy. He makes a crude and unwelcome sexual advance toward Violante, which is interrupted by the arrival of Roderick. Henriquez has learned that Leonora has taken refuge in a nearby nunnery, and has gained his brother&#x27;s help in a plan to retrieve her. Roderick has agreed, in part to keep an eye on his younger brother; he insists that Leonora be treated honourably, and given her choice whether to return with them.

Roderick is also clever enough to piece together the larger situation; he manages to bring Julio, Leonora, Violante, and Henriquez back home altogether. He engineers a grand confrontation and reconciliation scene at the play&#x27;s end: Julio and Leonora and happily re-united, and a now-repentant Henriquez wants to marry Violante to make up for his crime. The three fathers acquiesce to this arrangement.

==Versions of pastoral==
Theobald takes a very different approach to the pastoral genre and theme, compared to Shakespeare and Fletcher. In the pastoral tradition exploited by the earlier dramatists, the retreat to the primitive world of nature is a return to a rough but morally benign innocence. Theobald worked a century later in a different social and cultural frame; his shepherds are tougher, their life more bleak. Violante is surprised at the Master shepherd&#x27;s sexual advances:

::Who would have thought, that such poor worms as they,
::(Whose best feed is coarse bread; whose bev&#x27;rage, water),
::Should have so much rank blood?

In traditional pastoral, it is more commonly the well-fed denizens of court and city (in contrast to those who live and work in a closer relationship with nature) who are morally corrupt and sensual.

<text>The first of the AFI 100 Years... series of cinematic milestones, AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 American Movies is a list of the 100 best American movies, as determined by the American Film Institute from a poll of more than 1,500 artists and leaders in the film industry who chose from a list of 400 nominated movies. The 100-best list American films was unveiled in 1998. AFI released an updated list in 2007.

== Criteria ==
Films were judged according to the following criteria:

# &quot;Feature length&quot;: Narrative format, at least 60 minutes long.
# &quot;American film&quot;: English language, with significant creative and/or financial production elements from the United States. (Certain films, notably &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, were British-made but funded and distributed by American studios. &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; was New Zealand-made with American funding.)
# &quot;Critical recognition&quot;: Formal commendation in print.
# &quot;Major award winner&quot;: Recognition from competitive events including awards from organizations in the film community and major film festivals.
# &quot;Popularity over time&quot;: Including figures for box office adjusted for inflation, television broadcasts and syndication, and home video sales and rentals.
# &quot;Historical significance&quot;: A film&#x27;s mark on the history of the moving image through technical innovation, visionary narrative devices or other groundbreaking achievements.
# &quot;Cultural impact&quot;: A film&#x27;s mark on American society in matters of style and substance.
==List==

===2007 changes===
Twenty-three films were replaced in the 2007 tenth anniversary list. &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;, previously ranked #39, was the highest-ranked film to be dropped from the updated list, while &quot;The General&quot; at #18 was the highest-ranked new entry.

==Broadcast history==
=== Presentation broadcast on CBS ===
A 145-minute presentation of the 100 films aired on CBS on June 16, 1998.

A 460-minute version aired as a 10-part series on TNT, narrated by James Woods and hosted by American talents as follows:

*Richard Gere hosted the episode &quot;Against the Grain&quot;
*Richard Gere hosted the episode &quot;Beyond the Law&quot;
*Sally Field hosted the episode &quot;Family Portraits&quot;
*Jodie Foster hosted the episode &quot;In Search of...&quot;
*Sally Field hosted the episode &quot;Love Crazy&quot;
*Richard Gere hosted the episode &quot;War &amp; Peace&quot;
*Sally Field hosted the episode &quot;The Wilder Shores of Love&quot;

==Criticisms==
As with awards, the list of those who vote and the final vote tally are not released to the public, nor the criteria for how the 400 nominated films have been selected.

On June 26, 1998, the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; published an article by film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum which offers a detailed response to the movies in the AFI list, as well as criticism of the AFI&#x27;s appropriation of British films, such as &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (albeit with aforementioned American funding) and &quot;The Third Man&quot;. Rosenbaum also produced an alternative list of 100 American movies that he felt had been overlooked by the AFI. Rosenbaum chose to present this alternative list alphabetically since to rank them according to merit would be &quot;tantamount to ranking oranges over apples or declaring cherries superior to grapes.&quot;

The AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) list includes five titles from Rosenbaum&#x27;s list (including &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;), and the accompanying promotional poster lists the titles in alphabetical order.

<text>U.S. Route 28 (US 28) was an east–west United States Numbered Highway that was located completely in the U.S. state of Oregon. It connected US 99 in Eugene with US 30 in Ontario. It existed from 1926 to 1952.

==History==
In 1937, US 28 was truncated from Florence to Eugene, which then became its western terminus. US 28 was replaced with US 26 when US 26 was extended from Wyoming to the Pacific Ocean in 1952. The portion of US 28 from Ontario to Prineville became US 26. That highway then continued in a northwesterly direction to Portland and Astoria. From Prineville to Eugene, US 28 became US 126, now known as Oregon Route 126 (OR 126).

==Route description==

US 28 began at US 99 in Eugene before continuing to Sisters and Redmond, where the route met US 97. Continuing east, the highway traveled concurrently with US 395 between Mount Vernon and John Day.

At the intersection with OR 126, the old designation of US 28 follows US 26 and picks up the Ochoco Highway No. 41, which also follows OR 126 west to US 97 in Redmond. The Ochoco Highway ends at OR 19 near Dayville, from which US 28 followed the John Day Highway No. 5 through John Day to US 20 in Vale. The remainder of US 28 in Oregon overlapped US 20 on the Central Oregon Highway No. 7 to the Idaho state line.

<text>The AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... series was a series of annual lists from 1998 to 2008 by the American Film Institute—typically accompanied by CBS television specials—celebrating the century of American cinema.

As a centennial celebration of cinematic milestones, the series intended to inspire discussion and public interest in classical Hollywood cinema. As such, each list only included feature-length American films that were typically released before 2005. AFI defined &quot;American film&quot; as an &quot;English language motion picture with significant creative and/or financial production elements from the United States;&quot; and &quot;feature-length film&quot; as a &quot;motion picture of narrative format that is typically over 60 minutes in length.&quot;

To determine the composition of these lists, the names of a few hundred nominated films were listed on ballots that AFI would distribute to a jury of over 1,000 leaders in the creative industry, including film artists (directors, screenwriters, actors, editors, cinematographers), critics, and historians.

<doc id="718315" wikidata="Q1977371" url="?curid=718315" title="Nenana River">
<text>The Nenana River () is a tributary of the Tanana River, approximately long, in central Alaska in the United States. It drains an area on the north slope of the Alaska Range on the south edge of the Tanana Valley southwest of Fairbanks.

It issues from the Nenana Glacier in the northern Alaska Range, southwest of Mount Deborah, approximately 100 mi (160 km) south of Fairbanks. It flows briefly southwest, then west, then north, forming the eastern boundary of Denali National Park and Preserve. It emerges from the mountains onto the broad marshy Tanana Valley, joining the Tanana River from the south at Nenana, Alaska, approximately southwest of Fairbanks. The Tanana River continues to its confluence with the Yukon River.

The upper valley of the river furnishes approximately 100 mi (160 km) of the northern route of both the Alaska Railroad and the Parks Highway (Alaska State Highway 3) connecting Fairbanks and Anchorage.

The Nenana supports populations of Alaska blackfish, Arctic grayling, Arctic lamprey, broad whitefish, burbot, chum salmon, humpback whitefish, king salmon, lake chubs, least cisco, longnose suckers, northern pike, round whitefish, sheefish, silver salmon, and slimy sculpins. Major archaeological sites located in the valley include Broken Mammoth and Swan Point, of late Pleistocene age.

==Name origin==
Lieutenant Henry Allen of the U.S. Army explored the river in 1887. He named it the Cantwell River after Lieutenant John C. Cantwell, of the Revenue Cutter Service, who had explored the Kobuk River region in 1884–85. In 1898, members of the United States Geological Survey reported that people living along the river called it &quot;Tutlut&quot;. However, the local Tanana name was spelled &quot;Nenana&quot; on a later map. A century later, linguist William Bright wrote that the river&#x27;s name derived from the Lower Tanana (Athabascan) word, &quot;neenano&quot;&#x27;, meaning the &quot;stopping-while-migrating stream&quot;.

==Boating==
The river is one of the most popular destinations for boating and whitewater rafting in Alaska. Thousands of users, some on commercial cruises and others on private trips, travel on the river each year. The proximity of the Denali Highway, which runs parallel to the upper river for about , and the Parks Highway, which follows the river for , makes the river accessible at many places.

The river begins as a Class I (easy) rafting stream on the International Scale of River Difficulty. Jetboats and other craft ply the waters along the Denali Highway. Below this, however, the flow rate increases, and the Nenana becomes a Class I to II (medium) stream for the between Windy Station and McKinley Village Lodge. The most difficult whitewater, for experts only, occurs over the next , in Nenana Gorge between McKinley Village and Healy, and is rated Class IV (very difficult). Below this, the river is Class I or II all the way to Nenana.

Dangers include extremely cold swift water, Class IV rapids in the gorge, overhanging trees along the upper river, and overhangs, logjams, and braids on the lower river. An additional danger at the river mouth involves following the wrong braid, missing the take-out at Nenana, and being swept into the Tanana River, from which it may not be possible to exit until reaching Manley Hot Springs, further downstream.

<text>Altichiero da Zevio (), also called Aldighieri da Zevio, was an Italian painter much influenced by Giotto, certainly through knowledge of the frescoes in the Cappella degli Scrovegni in Padua and quite possibly through having been trained in Florence by one of Giotto&#x27;s pupils. Altichiero worked in Verona and Padua. Works by him survive in the church of Sant&#x27;Anastasia in Verona and in the Cappella di S Felice (originally Cappella di S Giacomo) in the basilica of Sant&#x27;Antonio (Il Santo) and the Oratorio di San Giorgio in Padua. His stature was compromised for a long time through his supposed collaboration with a certain Jacopo Avanzo or Avanzi, but study of the documents and historiography demonstrated Atichiero&#x27;s authorship of the frescoes in both the Santo and the 
Oratorio di San Giorgio. It has been argued that the hand of an assistant (conceivably Jacopo Avanzo or Jacopo Avanzi, both Bolognese painters) can be seen in some early scenes in the Santo (Cappella di S Felice, originally the Cappella di S Giacomo) – although it was certainly Altichiero who was paid to decorate the chapel, and he received 792 ducats in the summer of 1379.
Altichiero was probably born somewhere near Zevio. He became an important member of the della Scala household in Verona, and around 1364 painted a series of frescoes based upon Flavius Josephus&#x27;s &quot;The Wars of the Jews&quot; at the della Scala palace of Sala del Podestà.

The last record of Altichiero is a Paduan archival document of September 1384. At that time he was in Verona or about to go there. The Florentine art historian Giorgio Vasari is the source of the tradition that Altichiero returned to Verona after working in Padua.

<text>Mayim Chaya Bialik ( ; born December 12, 1975) is an American actress, author, and former game show host. From 1991 to 1995, she played the title character of the NBC sitcom &quot;Blossom&quot;. From 2010 to 2019, she played neuroscientist Amy Farrah Fowler on the CBS sitcom &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, for which she was nominated four times for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series and won the Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series in 2015 and 2017. Bialik shared hosting duties of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; with Ken Jennings on a rotating basis between August 2021 and December 2023.

==Early life and education==
Mayim Chaya Bialik was born on December 12, 1975, in San Diego, California, to Beverly (née Winkleman) and Barry Bialik. Her family were Jewish immigrants who lived in the Bronx, New York City. Three of her four grandparents migrated from Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. After being raised as a Reform Jew, she described herself as Modern Orthodox Jewish in 2013. Bialik became a Bat Mitzvah and has called herself a &quot;staunch Zionist&quot;. Her name, Mayim (&quot;water&quot; in Hebrew), originates in a family nickname of her great-grandmother, Miriam. The Hebrew-language poet Hayim Nahman Bialik was her great-great-great-granduncle.

Bialik graduated in 1993 from North Hollywood High School in Los Angeles, California. In acknowledgment of her acting commitments, she was granted a deferred acceptance and attended University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). She earned a Bachelor of Science degree in neuroscience, with minors in Hebrew and Jewish studies, in 2000.

Bialik has said she did not have the grades needed for medical school. She went on to study for a doctorate in neuroscience. She took a break from studies in 2005 to return to acting. She returned to earn her PhD degree in neuroscience from UCLA in 2007 under Dr. James McCracken. Her dissertation was titled &quot;Hypothalamic regulation in relation to maladaptive, obsessive-compulsive, affiliative and satiety behaviors in Prader–Willi syndrome&quot;.

== Career ==
=== 1987–2009: Child actress and other roles ===
Bialik started her career as a child actress in the late 1980s. Her early roles included the 1988 horror film &quot;Pumpkinhead&quot; (her first acting job) and guest appearances on &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; (two final-season episodes) and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. In 1988 to 1989, she appeared in eight episodes of the sitcom &quot;Webster&quot; as Frieda, Webster&#x27;s classmate. It was for &quot;Beauty and the Beast,&quot; where she played a sewer-dwelling girl named Ellie (with about ten lines of dialogue) that she obtained her Screen Actors Guild (SAG) card. Bialik appeared in three episodes of &quot;MacGyver&quot; as Lisa Woodman. She appeared in &quot;Beaches&quot; (1988), playing Bette Midler&#x27;s character as a young girl. Many reviews singled out her performance as a strong point in the film. She appeared in the music video for Michael Jackson&#x27;s song &quot;Liberian Girl&quot;. In 1990, she was tied to two television pilots, Fox&#x27;s &quot;Molloy&quot; and NBC&#x27;s &quot;Blossom&quot;. &quot;Molloy&quot; produced six episodes for a tryout run, followed by the shooting of the pilot special for &quot;Blossom&quot;. The latter aired two weeks before the Fox series and garnered higher ratings. When &quot;Molloy&quot; folded after its six episodes, &quot;Blossom&quot; premiered as a mid-season replacement on January 3, 1991, and aired until May 22, 1995.

On September 8, 1992, Bialik was a celebrity contestant guest in the episode &quot;Disturbing The Heavenly Peace&quot;, the first episode of the second season of the PBS game show &quot;Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; She had a major part in the Woody Allen comedy film &quot;Don&#x27;t Drink the Water&quot; in 1994. Between 1995 and 2005, she mostly did voiceover work for cartoons, such as &quot;The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest&quot;, Disney&#x27;s &quot;Recess&quot; and &quot;Kim Possible&quot;, Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot;, and Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot;. She appeared in the feature film &quot;Kalamazoo?&quot; (2005) and in three episodes of the HBO comedy series &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; as Jodi Funkhouser, the daughter of a friend of Larry David. The character transitioned to male in a later episode, going by the name Joey, and was recast to Chaz Bono. Bialik also made guest appearances as a fictionalized version of herself in the series &quot;Fat Actress&quot; and in an episode of &quot;Saving Grace&quot;. Bialik had a recurring role as the high school guidance counselor in ABC Family&#x27;s &quot;The Secret Life of the American Teenager&quot;. In 2009, Clinton Kelly nominated her for a makeover on TLC&#x27;s &quot;What Not to Wear&quot;. 

=== 2010–2019: &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; ===
She joined the cast of &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; as Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler in 2010. Her first appearance was in the season3 finale as a potential love interest for the character of Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons). In season 4, she began as a recurring character playing Sheldon&#x27;s &quot;friend that&#x27;s a girl, but not a girlfriend.&quot; Beginning with the 8th episode of season4, she became part of the main cast. Amy is a neurobiologist, a field that is related to Bialik&#x27;s real-life doctorate in neuroscience. Bialik&#x27;s performance in &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; earned her Emmy Award nominations in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. Bialik was one of seven actresses who had a &quot;quirky&quot; personality to audition for the role. Before she joined the cast, in the episode &quot;The Bat Jar Conjecture&quot;, Raj suggests recruiting the real-life Bialik to their Physics Bowl team, saying &quot;You know who&#x27;s apparently very smart is the girl who played TV&#x27;s &quot;Blossom&quot;. She got a Ph.D. in neuroscience or something.&quot; She is one of the guest stars on the 2014 Steve Carell improvisational sketch show &quot;Riot&quot;.

In August 2014, Bialik began hosting a revival of &quot;Candid Camera&quot; on TV Land along with Peter Funt. Her most recent movie appearance was in a Lifetime Christmas movie, &quot;The Flight Before Christmas&quot;. In 2019, Bialik appeared in a commercial for IBM. On August 20, 2019, it was announced that she and her new production company, Sad Clown Productions, had signed exclusive contracts with Warner Bros. Entertainment. Mackenzie Gabriel-Vaught, a former executive at Chuck Lorre Productions, is Sad Clown&#x27;s head of development. Sad Clown Productions, in conjunction with Jim Parsons&#x27;s That&#x27;s Wonderful Productions, BBC Studios, and Miranda Hart, executive-produces a starring vehicle for Bialik, &quot;Call Me Kat&quot;, based on the British series &quot;Miranda&quot;. A co-production of Warner Bros. and Fox Entertainment, it premiered on Fox on January 3, 2021, and was renewed for a second season in May 2021.

During her time on &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, Bialik wrote two books in addition to co-authoring two books with pediatrician Jay Gordon. &quot;Beyond the Sling&quot; is about attachment parenting, while &quot;Mayim&#x27;s Vegan Table&quot; contains over 100 of Bialik&#x27;s vegan recipes. Her third book, &quot;Girling Up&quot;, is about the struggles of and ways in which girls grow up, showing the scientific ways in which their bodies change. Its successor, &quot;Boying Up&quot; (2018) analyzes the science, anatomy, and mentality of growing up as a boy, and the physical and mental changes and challenges boys face while transitioning from adolescence to adulthood.

=== 2021–2023: &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; host and directorial debut ===
From May 31 to June 11, 2021, Bialik was a guest host of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; On August 11, 2021, it was announced that she would host the series&#x27; future primetime specials and spinoffs. When executive producer Mike Richards resigned as host after one week, it was announced that Bialik would guest-host the show for three weeks. Her contract was extended to seven weeks; she would then alternate with Ken Jennings for the rest of the calendar year. On December 8, 2021, it was announced that Bialik and Jennings would continue to host the show for the rest of the 2021–22 season. On July 27, 2022, it was announced that Bialik and Jennings would be the show&#x27;s permanent hosts in a job-sharing arrangement. In May 2023, Bialik competed as a contestant on an episode of &quot;Celebrity Wheel of Fortune&quot; against Vanna White and Ken Jennings. Bialik won $62,200 for Mental Wealth Alliance.

Bialik wrote and directed her first film, &quot;As They Made Us&quot; (2022), about a divorced mom juggling her family&#x27;s needs and her own quest for love. Dustin Hoffman and Candice Bergen starred as well as Simon Helberg, Bialik&#x27;s former &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; castmate. The film was expected to premiere in late 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic delayed filming. Ash Christian was attached to the project, but died in August 2020. Principal photography began in June 2021. The film was released on April 8, 2022.

In May 2023, it was announced that Bialik would temporarily leave &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and would not serve as host for the rest of season 39 due to her support of the Writers Guild of America strike. Ken Jennings hosted the remainder of season 39 during Bialik&#x27;s absence. In December 2023, it was announced that she would no longer host the syndicated version of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;

== Advocacy and activism ==

=== Grok Nation ===
Bialik founded Grok Nation (originally styled &quot;GrokNation&quot;) in August 2015 to facilitate conversations among people of different ages and backgrounds about issues. It aimed to engage readers in online conversations that lead to offline action, mobilizing them to change the world as a community. To &quot;grok&quot; means to understand in a profound manner. (The term comes from the 1961 science fiction novel &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; by Robert A. Heinlein.) Bialik had written on a similar idea for Jewish Telegraphic Agency–affiliated Jewish parenting site Kveller for five years. She announced and described her new creation on Kveller.

Along with former &quot;Sassy&quot; writer and editor Christina Kelly, Bialik relaunched Grok Nation as a women&#x27;s lifestyle site in March 2018. The site ceased updates in March 2019, with new content shifting to Bialik&#x27;s email newsletter.

=== Support of Israel ===
During the 2014 Gaza Conflict, she donated money to the Israel Defense Forces for armored vests. She has been vocal since the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel saying she was &quot;speechless&quot; amid the &quot;exceptionally painful&quot; conflict between Israel and Hamas. She has also spoken up against antisemitism on college campuses in the United States. On November 6, 2023, Bialik and Noa Tishby stated that they were against calls for a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Palestine saying, &quot;No country in the world would be asked to stop protecting itself under attack from all of its borders.&quot;

=== Veganism ===
Bialik is a vegan and a founding member of the Shamayim V&#x27;Aretz Institute, a Jewish organization that advocates the ethical treatment of animals. In 2017, she announced that she and vegan chef Ali Cruddas had opened Bodhi Bowl, a vegan restaurant in Los Angeles. It closed permanently in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== &quot;The New York Times&quot; op-ed ===
After the Harvey Weinstein sexual misconduct allegations surfaced, Bialik wrote a &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed in 2017 in which she described the entertainment industry as one &quot;that profits on the exploitation of women... [and] the objectification of women&quot;. With regard to protecting herself from sexual harassment, Bialik wrote that she dressed modestly and did not act flirtatiously with men, adding, &quot;In a perfect world, women should be free to act however they want. But our world isn&#x27;t perfect. Nothing—absolutely nothing—excuses men for assaulting or abusing women. But we can&#x27;t be naïve about the culture we live in.&quot; Bialik&#x27;s article drew backlash from critics who said she was insinuating that modesty and a conservative wardrobe can guard one against sexual assault. Patricia Arquette tweeted, &quot;I have to say I was dressed non-provocatively at 12 walking home from school when men masturbated at me. It&#x27;s not the clothes.&quot; In response, Bialik said she regretted that the piece &quot;became what it became&quot; and participated in a Facebook Live event hosted by &quot;The New York Times&quot; to answer questions about it.

==Personal life==
In 2014, Bialik was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Boston University.

=== Marriage and family ===
Bialik married Michael Stone on August 31, 2003; they had a Victorian-themed ceremony that included traditional Jewish wedding customs. Stone, who was raised Mormon but left the church as an adolescent, converted to Judaism to marry Bialik. They have two sons together. Bialik returned to television in 2010, as opposed to continuing her scientific career, so she could spend more time with her children. Bialik and Stone announced their divorce in November 2012, and it was finalized six months later.

=== Religious beliefs ===
In a 2012 interview, Bialik called herself an &quot;aspiring Modern Orthodox&quot;. She has also appeared in several YouTube cameos as Blossom and Amy Farrah Fowler, asking questions about Jewish beliefs. The videos are produced by Allison Josephs, Bialik&#x27;s Judaism study partner, whom she met with the help of Partners in Torah. Bialik is a frequent contributor to the Jewish parenting website, &quot;Kveller&quot;.

=== Vaccination beliefs ===
In a 2009 interview, Bialik said of her family: &quot;We are a non-vaccinating family, but I make no claims about people&#x27;s individual decisions. We based ours on research and discussions with our pediatrician, and we&#x27;ve been happy with that decision, but obviously there&#x27;s a lot of controversy about it.&quot; In October 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, she said that though she had not received a vaccination in 30 years, she planned to be vaccinated against both the flu and the SARS-CoV-2 virus and that &quot;As of today, my children may not have had every one of the vaccinations that your children have, but my children are vaccinated.&quot; Bialik has also said that her children were not vaccinated at the time of her 2012 book &quot;Beyond the Sling&quot;, but that they have since received a &quot;delayed&quot; vaccination schedule.

<text>Thorsten Kaye (born Thorsten Ernst Kieselbach, 22 February 1966) is a German-British-American actor. His best known roles include Patrick Thornhart on &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, Dr. Ian Thornhart on &quot;Port Charles&quot;, Zach Slater on &quot;All My Children&quot; and Ridge Forrester on &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;.

==Acting career==
Kaye was born in Frankfurt, Federal Republic of Germany. He appeared in many classical theater roles, including &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, &quot;Tartuffe&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;, &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, and &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, both in London and with the Hilberry Repertory Company in Detroit.

Kaye then moved to Los Angeles, where he acted in many television shows, including the miniseries, Sidney Sheldon&#x27;s &quot;Nothing Lasts Forever,&quot; before moving to New York to play Patrick Thornhart on ABC&#x27;s &quot;One Life to Live&quot; (1995–1997). The character gained quite a bit of popularity, and it is where he would meet his real life partner, Susan Haskell. After completing a two-year stint on &quot;OLTL&quot;, Thorsten did some guest starring work for other shows, as well as starring in a few feature films.

In April 2000, Thorsten accepted the role of the dedicated physician Ian Thornhart (Patrick&#x27;s older brother) on the ABC daytime soap (and the spin-off show of &quot;General Hospital&quot;), &quot;Port Charles&quot; (2000–2003). He appeared on the soap until its run ended in October 2003. Thorsten received two Daytime Emmy Award Nominations for Outstanding Lead Actor for his portrayal of Ian in 2003 and 2004.

In April 2004, Thorsten returned to New York to join the cast of the ABC soap &quot;All My Children&quot; in the role of casino owner, Zach Slater. He was nominated for two Daytime Emmy Awards in 2006 and 2009. Thorsten portrayed Slater until December 2009. He returned three times in 2010, and again in 2011 to bring Zach&#x27;s storyline to a close when &quot;AMC&quot; came to an end after 41 years, in September 2011.

Thorsten Kaye has one of the lead roles in a new psychological thriller (feature-length film) titled &quot;Occupant&quot;, which was released in the U.S and Canada in October 2011 on demand in many cable/satellite markets as well as on most digital platforms, including iTunes, Amazon, Blockbuster, and PlayStation.

In 2012, Kaye began appearing in the role of Nick, a recurring character on the NBC series &quot;Smash&quot;. In October 2013, it was announced that Kaye was cast to portray Ridge Forrester on &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, replacing originator Ronn Moss, who departed the series in 2012 after 25 years in the role. On 15 December 2023 Kaye became the first German-British to win the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, which he won for his portrayal of Ridge Forrester. He won again in 2024.

==Personal life==
When not working, Kaye enjoys music, literature and riding American motorcycles. He is a fan of the Miami Dolphins and the Detroit Red Wings.

While appearing on &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, he met his partner, Susan Haskell, who played his on-show love interest (Margaret &quot;Marty&quot; Saybrooke). They have two daughters, McKenna (born February 2003) and Marlowe (born January 2007).

Kaye was an active blogger for the Detroit Red Wings at NHL.com during the 2008 and 2009 Stanley Cup Playoffs.

<text>A medical error is a preventable adverse effect of care (&quot;iatrogenesis&quot;), whether or not it is evident or harmful to the patient. This might include an inaccurate or incomplete diagnosis or treatment of a disease, injury, syndrome, behavior, infection, or other ailments.

== Definitions ==
A medical error occurs when a health-care provider chooses an inappropriate method of care or improperly executes an appropriate method of care. Medical errors are often described as human errors in healthcare.

There are many types of medical error, from minor to major, and causality is often poorly determined. A never-event is a major type of medical error that is avoidable and preventable and should never happen, such as surgical errors. 

There are many taxonomies for classifying medical errors.

===Definitions of diagnostic error===

There is no single definition of diagnostic error, reflecting in part the dual nature of the word diagnosis, which is both a noun (the name of the assigned disease; diagnosis is a label) and a verb (the act of arriving at a diagnosis; diagnosis is a process). At the present time, there are at least 4 definitions of diagnostic error in active use:

Graber et al. defined diagnostic error as a diagnosis that is wrong, egregiously delayed, or missed altogether. This is a &quot;label&quot; definition, and can only be applied in retrospect, using some gold standard (for example, autopsy findings or a definitive laboratory test) to confirm the correct diagnosis. Many diagnostic errors fit several of these criteria; the categories overlap.

There are two process-related definitions: Schiff et al. defined diagnostic error as any breakdown in the diagnostic process, including both errors of omission and errors of commission. Similarly, Singh et al. defined diagnostic error as a &quot;missed opportunity&quot; in the diagnostic process, based on retrospective review.

In its landmark report, Improving Diagnosis in Health Care, The National Academy of Medicine proposed a new, hybrid definition that includes both label- and process-related aspects: &quot;A diagnostic error is failure to establish an accurate and timely explanation of the patient&#x27;s health problem(s) or to communicate that explanation to the patient.&quot; This is the only definition that specifically includes the patient in the definition wording.

=== Definition of prescription error ===
A prescription or medication error, as defined by the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention, is an event that is preventable that leads to or has led to unsuitable use of medication or has led to harm to the person during the period of time that the medicine is controlled by a clinician, the person, or the consumer. Some adverse drug events can also be related to medication errors.

== Impact ==
One extrapolation suggests that 180,000 people die each year partly as a result of iatrogenic injury. The World Health Organization registered 14 million new cases and 8.2 million cancer-related deaths in 2012. It estimated that the number of cases could increase by 70% through 2032. As the number of cancer patients receiving treatment increases, hospitals around the world are seeking ways to improve patient safety, to emphasize traceability and raise efficiency in their cancer treatment processes. Children are often more vulnerable to a negative outcome when a medication error occurs as they have age-related differences in how their bodies absorb, metabolize, and excrete pharmaceutical agents.

=== UK ===
In the UK, an estimated 850,000 medical errors occur each year, costing over £2 billion (estimated in the year 2000). The accuracy of this estimate is not clear. Criticism has included the statistical handling of measurement errors in the report, and significant subjectivity in determining which deaths were &quot;avoidable&quot; or due to medical error, and an erroneous assumption that 100% of patients would have survived if optimal care had been provided.

A 2006 study found that medication errors are among the most common medical mistakes, harming at least 1.5 million people every year. According to the study, 400,000 preventable drug-related injuries occur each year in hospitals, 800,000 in long-term care settings, and roughly 530,000 among Medicare recipients in outpatient clinics. The report stated that these are likely to be conservative estimates. In 2000 alone, the extra medical costs incurred by preventable drug-related injuries approximated $887 millionand the study looked only at injuries sustained by Medicare recipients, a subset of clinic visitors. None of these figures take into account lost wages and productivity or other costs.

=== US ===
According to a 2002 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality report, about 7,000 people were estimated to die each year from medication errors – about 16 percent more deaths than the number attributable to work-related injuries (6,000 deaths). One in five Americans (22%) report that they or a family member have experienced a medical error of some kind. A 2000 Institute of Medicine report estimated that medical errors result in between 44,000 and 98,000 preventable deaths and 1,000,000 excess injuries each year in U.S. hospitals. A 2001 study in the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; of seven Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers estimated that for roughly every 10,000 patients admitted to the select hospitals, one patient died who would have lived for three months or more in good cognitive health had &quot;optimal&quot; care been provided. A 2001 study estimated that 1% of hospital admissions result in an adverse event due to negligence. Identification or errors may be a challenge in these studies, and mistakes may be more common than reported as these studies identify only mistakes that led to measurable adverse events occurring soon after the errors. Independent review of doctors&#x27; treatment plans suggests that decision-making could be improved in 14% of admissions; many of the benefits would have delayed manifestations. Even this number may be an underestimate. One study suggests that adults in the United States receive only 55% of recommended care. At the same time, a second study found that 30% of care in the United States may be unnecessary. For example, if a doctor fails to order a mammogram that is past due, this mistake will not show up in the first type of study. In addition, because no adverse event occurred during the short follow-up of the study, the mistake also would not show up in the second type of study because only the principal treatment plans were critiqued. However, the mistake would be recorded in the third type of study. If a doctor recommends an unnecessary treatment or test, it may not show in any of these types of studies.

Cause of death on United States death certificates, statistically compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are coded in the International Classification of Disease (ICD), which does not include codes for human and system factors.

== Causes ==
The research literature showed that medical errors are caused by errors of commission and errors of omission. Errors of omission are made when providers did not take action when they should have, while errors of commission occur when decisions and action are delayed. Commission and omission errors have also been attributed with communication failures.

Medical errors can be associated with inexperienced physicians and nurses, new procedures, extremes of age, and complex or urgent care. Poor communication (whether in one&#x27;s own language or, as may be the case for medical tourists, another language), improper documentation, illegible handwriting, spelling errors, inadequate nurse-to-patient ratios, and similarly named medications are also known to contribute to the problem. Misdiagnosis may be associated with individual characteristics of the patient or due to the patient multimorbidity. Patient actions or inactions may also contribute significantly to medical errors.

=== Healthcare complexity ===
Complicated technologies, powerful drugs, intensive care, rare and multiple diseases, and prolonged hospital stay can contribute to medical errors. In turn, medical errors from carelessness or improper use of medical devices often lead to severe injuries or death. Since 2015, 60 injuries and 23 deaths have been caused by misplaced feeding tubes while using the Cortrak2 EAS system. The FDA recalled Avanos Medical&#x27;s Cortrak system in 2022 due to its severity and the high toll associated with the medical error.

Complexity makes diagnosis especially challenging. There are less than 200 symptoms listed in Wikipedia, but there are probably more than 10,000 known diseases. The World Health Organization&#x27;s system for the International Classification of Disease, 9th Edition from 1979 listed over 14,000 diagnosis codes. Textbooks of medicine often describe the most typical presentations of a disease, but in many conditions patients may have variable presentations instead of the classical signs and symptoms. To add complexity, the signs and symptoms of a given condition change over time; in the early stages the signs and symptoms may be absent or minimal, and then these evolve as the condition progresses. Diagnosis is often challenging in infants and children who can&#x27;t clearly communicate their symptoms, and in the elderly, where signs and symptoms may be muted or absent.

There are more than 7000 rare diseases alone, and in aggregate these are not uncommon: Roughly 1 in 17 patients will be diagnosed with a rare disease over their lifetime. Physicians may have only learned a handful of these during their education and training.

=== System and process design ===
In 2000, The Institute of Medicine released &quot;To Err is Human,&quot; which asserted that the problem in medical errors is not bad people in health care—it is that good people are working in bad systems that need to be made safer.

Poor communication and unclear lines of authority of physicians, nurses, and other care providers are also contributing factors. Disconnected reporting systems within a hospital can result in fragmented systems in which numerous hand-offs of patients results in lack of coordination and errors.

Other factors include the impression that action is being taken by other groups within the institution, reliance on automated systems to prevent error., and inadequate systems to share information about errors, which hampers analysis of contributory causes and improvement strategies.
Cost-cutting measures by hospitals in response to reimbursement cutbacks can compromise patient safety.
In emergencies, patient care may be rendered in areas poorly suited for safe monitoring. The American Institute of Architects has identified concerns for the safe design and construction of health care facilities.
Infrastructure failure is also a concern. According to the WHO, 50% of medical equipment in developing countries is only partly usable due to lack of skilled operators or parts. As a result, diagnostic procedures or treatments cannot be performed, leading to substandard treatment.

The Joint Commission&#x27;s Annual Report on Quality and Safety 2007 found that inadequate communication between healthcare providers, or between providers and the patient and family members, was the root cause of over half the serious adverse events in accredited hospitals. Other leading causes included inadequate assessment of the patient&#x27;s condition, and poor leadership or training.

=== Competency, education, and training ===
Variations in healthcare provider training &amp; experience and failure to acknowledge the prevalence and seriousness of medical errors also increase the risk. The so-called July effect occurs when new residents arrive at teaching hospitals, causing an increase in medication errors according to a study of data from 1979 to 2006.

=== Human factors and ergonomics ===

Cognitive errors commonly encountered in medicine were initially identified by psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in the early 1970s. Jerome Groopman, author of &quot;How Doctors Think&quot;, says these are &quot;cognitive pitfalls&quot;, biases which cloud our logic. For example, a practitioner may overvalue the first data encountered, skewing their thinking. Another example may be where the practitioner recalls a recent or dramatic case that quickly comes to mind, coloring the practitioner&#x27;s judgement. Another pitfall is where stereotypes may prejudice thinking. Pat Croskerry describes clinical reasoning as an interplay between intuitive, subconscious thought (System 1) and deliberate, conscious rational consideration (System 2). In this framework, many cognitive errors reflect over-reliance on System 1 processing, although cognitive errors may also sometimes involve System 2.

Sleep deprivation has also been cited as a contributing factor in medical errors. One study found that being awake for over 24 hours caused medical interns to double or triple the number of preventable medical errors, including those that resulted in injury or death. The risk of car crash after these shifts increased by 168%, and the risk of near miss by 460%. Interns admitted falling asleep during lectures, during rounds, and even during surgeries. Night shifts are associated with worse surgeon performance during laparoscopic surgeries.

Practitioner risk factors include fatigue,
depression, and burnout.
Factors related to the clinical setting include diverse patients, unfamiliar settings, time pressures, and increased patient-to-nurse staffing ratio increases.
Drug names that look alike or sound alike are also a problem.

Errors in interpreting medical images are often perceptual instead of &quot;fact-based&quot;; these errors are often caused by failures of attention or vision. For example, visual illusions can cause radiologists to misperceive images.

A number of Information Technology (IT) systems have been developed to detect and prevent medication errors, the most common type of medical errors. These systems screen data such as ICD-9 codes, pharmacy and laboratory data. Rules are used to look for changes in medication orders, and abnormal laboratory results that may be indicative of medication errors and/or adverse drug events.

== Examples ==
Errors can include misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis, administration of the wrong drug to the wrong patient or in the wrong way, giving multiple drugs that interact negatively, surgery on an incorrect site, failure to remove all surgical instruments, failure to take the correct blood type into account, or incorrect record-keeping. A 10th type of error is ones which are not watched for by researchers, such as RNs failing to program an IV pump to give a full dose of IV antibiotics or other medication.

=== Errors in diagnosis ===
According to a 2016 study from Johns Hopkins Medicine, medical errors are the third-leading cause of death in the United States. The projected cost of these errors to the U.S. economy is approximately $20 billion, 87% of which are direct increases in medical costs of providing services to patient affected by medical errors. Medical errors can increase average hospital costs by as much as $4,769 per patient. One common type of medical error stems from x-rays and medical imaging: failing to see or notice signs of disease on an image. The retrospective &quot;miss&quot; rate among abnormal imaging studies is reported to be as high as 30% (the real-life error rate is much lower, around 4-5%, because not all images are abnormal), and up to 20% of missed findings result in long-term adverse effects.

A large study reported several cases where patients were wrongly told that they were HIV-negative when the physicians erroneously ordered and interpreted HTLV (a closely related virus) testing rather than HIV testing. In the same study, &gt;90% of HTLV tests were ordered erroneously.
A 2008 literature review in The American Journal of Medicine estimated that between 10 and 15% of physician diagnoses are erroneous.

Misdiagnosis of lower extremity cellulitis is estimated to occur in 30% of patients, leading to unnecessary hospitalizations in 85% and unnecessary antibiotic use in 92%. Collectively, these errors lead to between 50,000 and 130,000 unnecessary hospitalizations and between $195 and $515 million in avoidable health care spending annually in the United States.

=== Misdiagnosis of psychological disorders ===
Female sexual desire sometimes used to be diagnosed as female hysteria.

Sensitivities to foods and food allergies risk being misdiagnosed as the anxiety disorder orthorexia.

Studies have found that bipolar disorder has often been misdiagnosed as major depression. Its early diagnosis necessitates that clinicians pay attention to the features of the patient&#x27;s depression and also look for present or prior hypomanic or manic symptomatology.

The misdiagnosis of schizophrenia is also a common problem. There may be long delays of patients getting a correct diagnosis of this disorder.

Delayed sleep phase disorder is often confused with: psychophysiological insomnia; depression; psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, ADHD or ADD; other sleep disorders; or school refusal. Practitioners of sleep medicine point out the dismally low rate of accurate diagnosis of the disorder, and have often asked for better physician education on sleep disorders.

Cluster headaches are often misdiagnosed, mismanaged, or undiagnosed for many years; they may be confused with migraine, &quot;cluster-like&quot; headache (or mimics), CH subtypes, other TACs ( trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias), or other types of primary or secondary headache syndrome. Cluster-like head pain may be diagnosed as secondary headache rather than cluster headache. Under-recognition of CH by health care professionals is reflected in consistent findings in Europe and the United States that the average time to diagnosis is around seven years.

Asperger syndrome and autism tend to get undiagnosed or delayed recognition and delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosed. Delayed or mistaken diagnosis can be traumatic for individuals and families; for example, misdiagnosis can lead to medications that worsen behavior.

The DSM-5 field trials included &quot;test-retest reliability&quot; which involved different clinicians doing independent evaluations of the same patient—a new approach to the study of diagnostic reliability.

=== Outpatient vs. inpatient ===
Misdiagnosis is the leading cause of medical error in outpatient facilities.
Since the National Institute of Medicine&#x27;s 1999 report, &quot;To Err is Human,&quot; found up to 98,000 hospital patients die from preventable medical errors in the U.S. each year, government and private sector efforts have focused on inpatient safety.

=== Medical prescriptions ===

While in 2000 the Committee on Quality of Health Care in America affirmed medical mistakes are an &quot;unavoidable outcome of learning to practice medicine&quot;, at 2019 the commonly accepted link between prescribing skills and clinical clerkships was not yet demonstrated by the available data and in the U.S. legibility of handwritten prescriptions has been indirectly responsible for at least 7,000 deaths annually.

Prescription errors concern ambiguous abbreviations, the right spelling of the full name of drugs: improper use of the nomenclature, of decimal points, unit or rate expressions; legibility and proper instructions; miscalculations of the posology (quantity, route and frequency of administration, duration of the treatment, dosage form and dosage strength); lack of information about patients (e.g. allergy, declining renal function) or reported in the medical document.&lt;ref name =&quot;10.29313/gmhc.v7i1.4069&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There were an estimated 66 million clinically significant medication errors in the British NHS in 2018. The resulting adverse drug reactions are estimated to cause around 700 deaths a year in England and to contribute to around 22,000 deaths a year. The British researchers did not find any evidence that error rates were lower in other countries, and the global cost was estimated at $42 billion per year.

Medication errors in hospital include omissions, delayed dosing and incorrect medication administrations. Medication errors are not always readily identified, but can be reported using case note reviews or incident reporting systems. There are pharmacist-led interventions that can reduce the incident of medication error. Electronic prescribing has been shown to reduce prescribing errors by up to 30%.

== Mitigation (after an error) ==
Mistakes can have a strongly negative emotional impact on the doctors who commit them.

=== Recognizing that mistakes are not isolated events ===
Some physicians recognize that adverse outcomes from errors usually do not happen because of an isolated error and actually reflect system problems. This concept is often referred to as the Swiss Cheese Model. This is the concept that there are layers of protection for clinicians and patients to prevent mistakes from occurring. Therefore, even if a doctor or nurse makes a small error (e.g. incorrect dose of drug written on a drug chart by doctor), this is picked up before it actually affects patient care (e.g. pharmacist checks the drug chart and rectifies the error). Such mechanisms include:
Practical alterations (e.g.-medications that cannot be given through IV, are fitted with tubing which means they cannot be linked to an IV even if a clinician makes a mistake and tries to), systematic safety processes (e.g. all patients must have a Waterlow score assessment and falls assessment completed on admission), and training programmes/continuing professional development courses are measures that may be put in place.

There may be several breakdowns in processes to allow one adverse outcome. In addition, errors are more common when other demands compete for a physician&#x27;s attention. However, placing too much blame on the system may not be constructive.

=== Placing the practice of medicine in perspective ===
Essayists imply that the potential to make mistakes is part of what makes being a physician rewarding and without this potential the rewards of medical practice would be diminished. Laurence states that &quot;Everybody dies, you and all of your patients. All relationships end. Would you want it any other way? [...] Don&#x27;t take it personally&quot;.
Seder states &quot;[...] if I left medicine, I would mourn its loss as I&#x27;ve mourned the passage of my poetry. On a daily basis, it is both a privilege and a joy to have the trust of patients and their families and the camaraderie of peers. There is no challenge to make your blood race like that of a difficult case, no mind game as rigorous as the challenging differential diagnosis, and though the stakes are high, so are the rewards.&quot;

=== Disclosing mistakes ===
Forgiveness, which is part of many cultural traditions, may be important in coping with medical mistakes. Among other healing processes, it can be accomplished through the use of communicative disclosure guidelines.

==== To oneself ====
Inability to forgive oneself may create a cycle of distress and increased likelihood of a future error.

However, Wu et al. suggest &quot;...those who coped by accepting responsibility were more likely to make constructive changes in practice, but [also] to experience more emotional distress.&quot; It may be helpful to consider the much larger number of patients who are not exposed to mistakes and are helped by medical care.

==== To patients ====
Gallagher et al. state that patients want &quot;information about what happened, why the error happened, how the error&#x27;s consequences will be mitigated, and how recurrences will be prevented.&quot; Interviews with patients and families reported in a 2003 book by Rosemary Gibson and Janardan Prasad Singh, put forward that those who have been harmed by medical errors face a &quot;wall of silence&quot; and &quot;want an acknowledgement&quot; of the harm. With honesty, &quot;healing can begin not just for the patients and their families but also the doctors, nurses and others involved.&quot; In a line of experimental investigations, Annegret Hannawa et al. developed evidence-based disclosure guidelines under the scientific &quot;Medical Error Disclosure Competence (MEDC)&quot; framework.

A review of studies examining patients&#x27; views on investigations of medical harm found commonalities in their expectations of the process. For example, many wanted reviews to be transparent, trustworthy, and person-centred to meet their needs. People wanted to be meaningfully involved in the process and to be treated with respect and empathy. Justice-seekers wanted an honest account of what happened, the circumstances leading up to it, and measures to ensure it does not happen again. Processes that, for example, involved people independent of the organisation responsible for harm gave investigations credibility.

A 2005 study by Wendy Levinson of the University of Toronto showed surgeons discussing medical errors used the word &quot;error&quot; or &quot;mistake&quot; in only 57 percent of disclosure conversations and offered a verbal apology only 47 percent of the time.

Patient disclosure is important in the medical error process. The current standard of practice at many hospitals is to disclose errors to patients when they occur. In the past, it was a common fear that disclosure to the patient would incite a malpractice lawsuit. Many physicians would not explain that an error had taken place, causing a lack of trust toward the healthcare community. In 2007, 34 states passed legislation that precludes any information from a physician&#x27;s apology for a medical error from being used in malpractice court (even a full admission of fault). This encourages physicians to acknowledge and explain mistakes to patients, keeping an open line of communication.

The American Medical Association&#x27;s Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs states in its ethics code:
:&quot;Situations occasionally occur in which a patient suffers significant medical complications that may have resulted from the physician&#x27;s mistake or judgment. In these situations, the physician is ethically required to inform the patient of all facts necessary to ensure understanding of what has occurred. Concern regarding legal liability which might result following truthful disclosure should not affect the physician&#x27;s honesty with a patient.&quot;

From the American College of Physicians Ethics Manual:
:&quot;In addition, physicians should disclose to patients information about procedural or judgment errors made in the course of care if such information is material to the patient&#x27;s well-being. Errors do not necessarily constitute improper, negligent, or unethical behavior, but failure to disclose them may.&quot;

However, &quot;there appears to be a gap between physicians&#x27; attitudes and practices regarding error disclosure. Willingness to disclose errors was associated with higher training level and a variety of patient-centered attitudes, and it was not lessened by previous exposure to malpractice litigation&quot;. Hospital administrators may share these concerns.

Consequently, in the United States, many states have enacted laws excluding expressions of sympathy after accidents as proof of liability.

Disclosure may actually reduce malpractice payments.

==== To non-physicians ====
In a study of physicians who reported having made a mistake, it was offered that disclosing to non-physician sources of support may reduce stress more than disclosing to physician colleagues. This may be due to the finding that of the physicians in the same study, when presented with a hypothetical scenario of a mistake made by another colleague, only 32% of them would have unconditionally offered support. It is possible that greater benefit occurs when spouses are physicians.

==== To other physicians ====
Discussing mistakes with other physicians is beneficial. However, medical providers may be less forgiving of one another. The reason is not clear, but one essayist has admonished, &quot;Don&#x27;t Take Too Much Joy in the Mistakes of Other Doctors.&quot;

==== To the physician&#x27;s institution ====
Disclosure of errors, especially &quot;near misses&quot;, may be able to reduce subsequent errors in institutions that are capable of reviewing near misses. However, doctors report that institutions may not be supportive of the doctor.

==== Use of rationalization to cover up medical errors ====
Based on anecdotal and survey evidence, Banja states that rationalization (making excuses) is very common among the medical profession to cover up medical errors.

==== By potential for harm to the patient ====
In a survey of more than 10,000 physicians in the United States, when asked the question, &quot;Are there times when it&#x27;s acceptable to cover up or avoid revealing a mistake if that mistake would not cause harm to the patient?&quot;, 19% answered &quot;yes&quot;, 60% answered &quot;no&quot; and 21% answered &quot;it depends&quot;. On the question, &quot;Are there times when it is acceptable to cover up or avoid revealing a mistake if that mistake would potentially or likely harm the patient?&quot;, 2% answered &quot;yes&quot;, 95% answered &quot;no&quot; and 3% answered &quot;it depends&quot;.

=== Legal procedure ===
Standards and regulations for medical malpractice vary by country and jurisdiction within countries. Medical professionals may obtain professional liability insurances to offset the risk and costs of lawsuits based on medical malpractice.

== Prevention ==
Medical care is frequently compared adversely to aviation; while many of the factors that lead to errors in both fields are similar, aviation&#x27;s error management protocols are regarded as much more effective. Safety measures include informed consent, the availability of a second practitioner&#x27;s opinion, voluntary reporting of errors, root cause analysis, reminders to improve patient medication adherence, hospital accreditation, and systems to ensure review by experienced or specialist practitioners.

A template has been developed for the design (both structure and operation) of hospital medication safety programmes, particularly for acute tertiary settings, which emphasizes safety culture, infrastructure, data (error detection and analysis), communication and training.

Particularly to prevent the medication errors in the perspective of the intrathecal administration of local anaesthetics, there is a proposal to change the presentation and packaging of the appliances and agents used for this purpose. One spinal needle with a syringe prefilled with the local anaesthetic agents may be marketed in a single blister pack, which will be peeled open and presented before the anaesthesiologist conducting the procedure.

Physician well-being has also been recommended as an indicator of healthcare quality given its association with patient safety outcomes. A meta-analysis involving 21517 participants found that physicians with depressive symptoms had a 95% higher risk of reporting medical errors and that the association between physician depressive symptoms and medical errors is bidirectional 

=== Reporting requirements ===
In the United States, adverse medical event reporting systems were mandated in just over half (27) of the states as of 2014, a figure unchanged since 2007. In U.S. hospitals error reporting is a condition of payment by Medicare. An investigation by the Office of Inspector General, Department of Health and Human Services released January 6, 2012 found that most errors are not reported and even in the case of errors that are reported and investigated changes are seldom made which would prevent them in the future. The investigation revealed that there was often lack of knowledge regarding which events were reportable and recommended that lists of reportable events be developed.

=== Cause-specific preventive measures ===
Traditionally, errors are attributed to mistakes made by individuals, who then may be penalized. A common approach to respond to and prevent specific errors is requiring additional checks at particular points in the system, whose findings and detail of execution must be recorded. As an example, an error of free flow IV administration of heparin is approached by teaching staff how to use the IV systems and to use special care in setting the IV pump. While overall errors become less likely, the checks add to workload and may in themselves be a cause of additional errors. In some hospitals, a regular morbidity and mortality conference meeting is scheduled to discuss complications or deaths and learn from or improve the overall processes.

A newer model for improvement in medical care takes its origin from the work of W. Edwards Deming in a model of Total Quality Management. In this model, there is an attempt to identify the underlying system defect that allowed the error to occur. As an example, in such a system the error of free flow IV administration of heparin is dealt with by not using IV heparin and substituting subcutaneous administration of heparin, obviating the entire problem. However, such an approach presupposes available research showing that subcutaneous heparin is as effective as IV. Thus, most systems use a combination of approaches to the problem.

=== Anaesthesiology ===
The field of medicine that has taken the lead in systems approaches to safety is anaesthesiology. Steps such as standardization of IV medications to 1 ml doses, national and international color-coding standards, and development of improved airway support devices has the field a model of systems improvement in care.

=== Medications ===
Reducing errors in prescribing, dispensing, compounding/formulating, labelling, and handling medications is a priority and has been the subject of systematic reviews and studies. Examples of areas to reduce medication errors and improve safety include: Training professionals or using databases to compare new and previous prescribed medications to prevent mistakes, also known as &quot;medication reconciliation&quot;, prescribing through an electronic medical record system and/or using decision support systems that has automatic checks in place, with computerized alerts or other novel technologies, the use of machine-readable barcodes, healthcare professional and patient training or supplementary educational programs, adding in an extra step for double checking prescriptions (both at the level of the healthcare professional and at the administrator level), using standardized protocols in the workplace that include a check-list, physical markings or writing on syringes to indicate correct doses, programmes that include the person being able to administer the medications themselves, ensuring that the workplace or environment is well-lit, monitoring and adjusting healthcare professional working hours, and the use of an interdisciplinary team. There is weak evidence indicating that a number of these suggested interventions may be helpful in reducing errors or improving patient safety, however, in general, evidence supporting the best or most effective intervention for reducing errors not strong. Evidence supporting improvements aimed at reducing medical errors in medications for pediatric hospitalized patients is also very weak.

=== Historically ===
As far back as the 1930s, pharmacists worked with physicians to select, from many options, the safest and most effective drugs available for use in hospitals. The process is known as the Formulary System and the list of drugs is known as the Formulary. In the 1960s, hospitals implemented unit dose packaging and unit dose drug distribution systems to reduce the risk of wrong drug and wrong dose errors in hospitalized patients; centralized sterile admixture services were shown to decrease the risks of contaminated and infected intravenous medications; and pharmacists provided drug information and clinical decision support directly to physicians to improve the safe and effective use of medications. Pharmacists are recognized experts in medication safety and have made many contributions that reduce error and improve patient care over the last 50 years. More recently, governments have attempted to address issues like patient-pharmacist communication and consumer knowledge through measures like the Australian Government&#x27;s Quality Use of Medicines policy.

== Misconceptions ==
Some common misconceptions about medical error include:
* Medical error is the &quot;third leading cause of death&quot; in the United States. This canard stems from an erroneous 2016 study which, according to David Gorski, &quot;has taken on a life of its own&quot; and fuelled &quot;a myth promulgated by both quacks and academics&quot;.
* &quot;Bad apples&quot; or incompetent health care providers are a common cause. (Although human error is commonly an initiating event, the faulty care delivery process invariably permits or compounds the harm and so is the focus of improvement.)
* High-risk procedures or medical specialties are responsible for most &quot;avoidable&quot; adverse events. (Although some mistakes, such as in surgery, are harder to conceal, errors occur in all levels of care. Even though complex procedures entail more risk, adverse outcomes are not usually due to error, but to the severity of the condition being treated.) However, United States Pharmacopeia has reported that medication errors during the course of a surgical procedure are three times more likely to cause harm to a patient than those occurring in other types of hospital care.
* If a patient experiences an adverse event during the process of care, an error has occurred. (Most medical care entails some level of risk, and there can be complications or side effects, even unforeseen ones, from the underlying condition or from the treatment itself.)

<text>Pingtung County () is a county located in southern Taiwan. It has a warm tropical monsoon climate and is known for its agriculture and tourism. Kenting National Park, Taiwan&#x27;s oldest national park, is located in the county. The county seat is Pingtung City.

==Name==
The name &quot;Pingtung&quot; means &quot;east of Banping mountain&quot;, referring to a nearby mountain known as Banping mountain ().

==History==
===Early history===
Aboriginal inhabitants of Liuqiu Island ( southwest of Taiwan, and now part of Pingtung County) killed Dutch sailors on two occasions. In response, in the spring of 1636, Dutch sailors carried out a punitive campaign that became known as the Lamey Island Massacre.

Modern-day Pingtung County and Kaohsiung City were part of Banlian-chiu (萬年州; &quot;Bān-liân-chiu&quot;) during the Kingdom of Tungning (1661–1683) and Fongshan Prefecture (鳳山縣; &quot;Hōng-soaⁿ-koān&quot;) during Qing dynasty rule (1683–1895).

Until the seventeenth century, this area of Taiwan was a place of exile for Chinese criminals and the occasional landing point for international mariners. Only the settlements near present-day Checheng Township existed. In 1664, the Hakka settlers arrived from mainland China and farmed under a homesteading system introduced by Zheng Jing.

Pingtung City, the biggest city in Pingtung County, also known as &quot;A-Kau&quot; (阿猴; &quot;A-kâu&quot;, English: the forest), was the home of Taiwanese Plains Aborigines.

In 1684, settlers from China&#x27;s southern Fujian region created the first Han Chinese villages near Pingtung. By 1734, most of the Pingtung Plain was cultivated, and Pingtung was expanded in 1764. In 1836, the government and locals worked together to build the city&#x27;s four walls (the North Gate, the East Gate, the West Gate, and the South gate), and the roads were completed.

In March 1867, fourteen American sailors were killed near Kenting by local aborigines in the &quot;Rover&quot; incident, which lead to the failed American Formosa Expedition three months later. In 1871, local aborigines killed 54 sailors from Ryukyu in the Mudan Incident. The Japanese carried out a punitive campaign against the local aborigines in the 1874 Japanese invasion of Taiwan.

<text>CKCK-DT (channel 2) is a television station in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, part of the CTV Television Network. Owned and operated by network parent Bell Media, the station maintains studios and transmitter facilities on Eastgate Drive and Highway 1, just east of Regina proper.

Master control facilities are located at the studios of CFCN-DT in Calgary, shared with eight other CTV owned-and-operated stations in British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan.

==History==
CKCK first signed on the air on July 28, 1954, as the first privately owned television station in Western Canada. It was originally owned by the Sifton family, which also owned the &quot;Regina Leader-Post&quot; and CKCK radio. It was originally a CBC Television affiliate. Shortly after signing on, it took a secondary affiliation with American broadcast network CBS. In 1962, as part of a deal that allowed CTV to come to Saskatchewan, CKCK opened a rebroadcaster in Moose Jaw. In return, Moose Jaw&#x27;s original station, CHAB-TV, switched to CTV and opened a semi-satellite in Regina, CHRE-TV.
The station swapped affiliations with CHAB/CHRE and joined CTV when the latter stations were purchased by the CBC. As a result of this deal, CHRE changed its call letters to CBKRT and became the main station; it is now CBKT.
In 1977, CKCK was sold to Harvard Developments, owned by Regina&#x27;s Hill family. In 1985, Baton Broadcasting acquired a 90 percent stake in the station (the remaining 10 percent would soon follow), bringing it under common ownership with CTV&#x27;s other Saskatchewan affiliates—CFQC in Saskatoon, CICC in Yorkton, and CIPA in Prince Albert. In 1987, these stations and Baton&#x27;s two privately owned CBC affiliates in Saskatchewan, CKOS in Yorkton and CKBI in Prince Albert, began branding as the &quot;Saskatchewan Television Network,&quot; which linked up with Baton&#x27;s Ontario stations as the Baton Broadcast System in 1994.

Following Baton&#x27;s acquisition of CTV in 1997, CKCK became a CTV owned-and-operated station. Local programming today is limited primarily to the station&#x27;s popular newscasts.
From the 1970s through the late 1980s, CKCK branded itself as &quot;CKTV&quot;, but its official call letters remained CKCK-TV. During this period, though, the station did acquire the CKTV calls for its Fort Qu&#x27;Appelle retransmitter. That station is now CKCK-TV-7; &quot;CKTV&quot; is currently used the call sign for a Radio-Canada owned-and-operated station in Saguenay, Quebec. Nevertheless, while the station identifies itself only as CTV, many people in southern Saskatchewan still call the station &quot;CKTV&quot; or &quot;CK&quot;.

In December 2008, CTVglobemedia applied to the CRTC to operate an HD feed of CKCK-TV, which would be delivered as a &quot;satellite-to-cable&quot; feed. The move would allow CKCK to operate an HD signal which could be substituted in place of American HD signals on local cable services, without actually operating an over-the-air digital television transmitter.

As with its Saskatoon sister station, CKCK&#x27;s programming is aired in pattern with that of Winnipeg sister station CKY-DT, with prime time programming running from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. simultaneously with East Coast stations, and CTV&#x27;s 7 p.m. ET programming bumped to 10 p.m. However, as Saskatchewan does not observe daylight saving time and remains on Central Standard Time year-round, programming is delayed by an hour in comparison to CKY when DST is in effect. In March, the station also broadcasts the annual &quot;Telemiracle&quot; telethon (which alternates between Regina and Saskatoon on a yearly cycle), supporting the Kinsmen and Kinettes of Saskatchewan. The event is simulcast by all CTV stations in Saskatchewan.

==News operation==

CKCK-DT presently broadcasts 25 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with five hours each weekday).

CKCK-TV&#x27;s original newscast was anchored by Jim McLeod, signing on 1954. McLeod anchored for many years, staying on the air long enough to debut the station&#x27;s first colour newscast in 1973.

On September 22, 1997, the station launched a noon newscast a short time before the Baton Broadcast System rebranded to CTV across Canada. 

On October 31, 2011, CKCK debuted a three-hour morning newscast under the title &quot;CTV Morning Live&quot;, which airs on weekdays 6–9 a.m.; other morning newscasts under the &quot;CTV Morning Live&quot; banner were launched on other CTV owned-and-operated stations across western and central Canada as part of a benefits package that was included as a condition of the sale of the CTV network to Bell Canada.

On July 28, 2014, CKCK began producing newscasts in high definition, and introduced a new studio as part of the migration.

An additional hour of local news coverage was added in 2017 in the 5 p.m. time slot.

CKCK&#x27;s newscasts are also broadcast by CICC-TV in Yorkton, since that station does not broadcast a local 6 or 11:30 p.m. newscast. As a result, CKCK&#x27;s program regularly includes reports from Yorkton.

As of September 2023, &quot;CTV Morning Live&quot;, &quot;CTV News at 5&quot; and &quot;CTV News at 11:30&quot; are broadcast from Regina on all CTV stations in Saskatchewan.

Bell Media cuts on February 8, 2024, resulted in the cancellation of CKCK&#x27;s noon newscast. The changes also brought the station&#x27;s provincial weekend 6 and 11:30 p.m. newscasts to an end.

==&quot;Indigenous Circle&quot;==
In 1993, CKCK-TV began producing a half hour weekly broadcast dedicated to Indigenous affairs titled &quot;Indigenous Circle&quot;. 

The show aired on all CTV stations in Saskatchewan on Sundays, and would feature a range of Indigenous-related news content, interview segments, special documentaries and musical performances. 

The final traditional episode of &quot;Indigenous Circle&quot; aired on February 18, 2018, although the name lives on within a segment of the station&#x27;s regular newscasts, airing on Tuesdays following the cancellation of CKCK&#x27;s local weekend newscasts.

Certain stories on CTV National News also use the &quot;Indigenous Circle&quot; moniker. 

==Technical information==
===Subchannel===
===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
On August 31, 2011, when Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts, CKCK flash cut its digital signal into operation on VHF channel 8 at 12:05 a.m. Digital television receivers display CKCK-DT&#x27;s virtual channel as 2.1. The station&#x27;s high definition feed began to be carried on Bell Satellite TV channel 1106 on September 12, 2011.

===Former transmitters===
* CKMC-TV 12 Swift Current
* CKMJ-TV 7 Moose Jaw

On February 11, 2016, Bell Media applied for its regular license renewals, which included applications to delete a long list of transmitters, including CKCK-TV-1, CKCK-TV-2, CKCK-TV-7 and CKMC-TV-1. Bell Media&#x27;s rationale for deleting these analog repeaters is below:
&quot;We are electing to delete these analog transmitters from the main licence with which they are associated. These analog transmitters generate no incremental revenue, attract little to no viewership given the growth of BDU or DTH subscriptions and are costly to maintain, repair or replace. In addition, none of the highlighted transmitters offer any programming that differs from the main channels. The Commission has determined that broadcasters may elect to shut down transmitters but will lose certain regulatory privileges (distribution on the basic service, the ability to request simultaneous substitution) as noted in Broadcasting Regulatory Policy CRTC 2015–24, Over-the-air transmission of television signals and local programming. We are fully aware of the loss of these regulatory privileges as a result of any transmitter shutdown.&quot;

The licence for those transmitters expired in August 2017, and were subsequently shut down.
At the same time, Bell Media applied to convert the licenses of CTV Two Atlantic (formerly ASN) and CTV Two Alberta (formerly ACCESS) from satellite-to-cable undertakings into television stations without transmitters (similar to cable-only network affiliates in the United States), and to reduce the level of educational content on CTV Two Alberta. With the shutdown of CJFB-TV several years ago, Bell also asked for the change to the condition of license for its repeater in Swift Current, CKMC-TV that prevents it from soliciting advertising in that community, and that CJFB-TV may substitute commercials on it (which is irrelevant since the station is no longer in operation).

On July 30, 2019, Bell Media was granted permission to close down the transmitters for CKMC-TV and CKMJ-TV as part of Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2019-268. Both transmitters were scheduled to close down by February 26, 2021.

<text>Skidmore College is a private liberal arts college in Saratoga Springs, New York. Approximately 2,700 students are enrolled at Skidmore pursuing a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in one of more than 60 areas of study.

The college originated from a women&#x27;s industrial club that was founded by Lucy Skidmore Scribner in 1903 and chartered as a school in 1911. In 1922 it grew into Skidmore College, a baccalaureate-degree-granting institution. In the late 1960s, the college moved from downtown Saratoga Springs to a newly constructed campus on the city&#x27;s northern border. After a half-century as a women&#x27;s college, Skidmore became coeducational in 1971.

==History==
Skidmore College has undergone many transformations since its founding in the early 20th century as a women&#x27;s college. The Young Women&#x27;s Industrial Club was formed in 1903 by Lucy Ann Skidmore (1853–1931) with inheritance money from her husband, who died in 1879, and from her father, Joseph Russell Skidmore (1821–1882), a former coal merchant. In 1911, the club was chartered under the name Skidmore School of Arts as a college to vocationally and professionally train young women. The school&#x27;s board of regents finally permitted the granting of baccalaureate degrees in 1922, and the school subsequently changed names to the current Skidmore College.

Skidmore College was initially established with a campus in downtown Saratoga Springs. In 1961, the college board approved a move to what would become the new Jonsson Campus: 850 acres on the outer edges of Saratoga Springs, which had been purchased for the college by Skidmore trustee Erik Jonsson, the founder and president of Texas Instruments and the future mayor of Dallas, Texas. Jonsson Tower on the new campus bears his name. The first buildings on the modern campus opened in 1966, and the college gradually moved all operations to the new location. 

In 1971, Skidmore began admitting men to its regular undergraduate program. (A few male World War II veterans had been admitted in the mid-1940s.) In 1971 Skidmore also launched the University Without Walls (UWW) program, which allowed nonresident students over age 25 to earn bachelor&#x27;s degrees. That program ended in 2012. 

In 2020, Marc C. Conner became the college&#x27;s eighth president, replacing Philip A. Glotzbach, who had served as president since 2003. In February 2019, Glotzbach had announced that he would retire at the end of the 2019–2020 school year.

In 2023, the college&#x27;s computer network was subject to a ransomware attack. The college notified affiliates whose data may have been accessed, and provided two years of a credit-monitoring service. An Oklahoma law firm filed a class-action suit, with two former employees of the college named as lead plaintiffs.

==Academics==
Skidmore offers 44 undergraduate majors, an average class size of 16, and more than 1,000 courses. The World Languages and Literatures Department offers classes in six languages and self-instructional coursework in five additional languages. 

In the 2022–2023 school year, 617 bachelor&#x27;s degrees were awarded in the following departments:
*Area, Ethnic, Cultural, Gender, and Group Studies (11)
*Biological and Biomedical Sciences (69)
*Business, Management, and Marketing (104)
*Computer and Information Sciences (21)
*Education (12)
*English Language and Literature/Letters (30)
*Foreign Languages, Literatures, and Linguistics (7)
*History (17)
*Liberal Arts and Sciences, General Studies, and Humanities (9)
*Mathematics and Statistics (10)
*Natural Resources and Conservation (27)
*Philosophy and Religious Studies (11)
*Physical Sciences (24)
*Psychology (82) 
*Public Administration and Social Service Professions (16)
*Social Sciences (101)
*Visual and Performing Arts (66)

Students are also encouraged to take their education outside of the classroom with internships. These can be taken for credit and can be completed throughout the academic year; nearly 85% of students participate in an internship during their Skidmore career. Opportunities for these internships are highly publicized both by the departments themselves and by the career center.
Due to the definition of degrees by New York State, Skidmore cannot accredit all departments with a Bachelor&#x27;s of Science. A B.S. is given to those students majoring in art (studio), dance, dance-theater, education, exercise science, business, social work, and theater. The distinction rests in the number of hours of &quot;non-liberal arts&quot; courses allowed toward the 120 credit hours needed for graduation, 60 for a B.S. and 30 for a B.A. These &quot;non-liberal arts&quot;-designated courses are considered by the college to be of a professional nature.

===Rankings and reputation===
Skidmore is considered one of the Hidden Ivies according to &quot;Greenes&#x27; Guides to Educational Planning&quot; (2000). The college was ranked as the 36th best national liberal arts college in the 2025 rankings of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. The 2020 &quot;Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education&quot; ranking of U.S. colleges and universities placed Skidmore at 93rd. For its 2025 America&#x27;s Top Colleges list, &quot;Forbes&quot; rated Skidmore 122nd overall, and 30th among liberal arts universities.

==Admissions==
The number of new students enrolling in the fall of 2023 (for the class of 2027) was 735. There had been 12,144 total applications for the class of 2027, with a 23% acceptance rate and a yield rate (the percentage of accepted students who enroll) of 27%. For submitted standardized tests, the middle 50% ranges were 1320-1440 for the SAT and 30-33 for the ACT.

==Campus and facilities==

Most humanities classes are held in one of four academic buildings: Palamountain, Tisch, Bolton, and Ladd. Harder Hall houses math and computer science; geology, chemistry, physics, and biology operate out of Dana Science Center.

Skidmore&#x27;s average class size is 16 students; 94% of classes have fewer than 30 students. The student body comes from 44 U.S. states and more than 60 countries. About 90% of students live on campus. The college has around 100 student clubs and organizations, including athletic teams, arts groups, an honor society, and community-service clubs.

In 2020, Skidmore broke ground on the 200,000-square-foot Billie Tisch Center for Integrated Sciences, a complex housing 10 Skidmore science departments and programs, 46 research labs, and a maker space for students and faculty, as well as a site-specific 165-foot sculpture by artist Alyson Shotz. The complex, scheduled to be complete in 2024, is named in honor of trustee and donor Wilma &quot;Billie&quot; Tisch, a 1948 graduate.

The Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery is among the college&#x27;s main arts facilities. In addition to the Tang, Skidmore has undergraduate studio space as well as several smaller galleries. The Saisselin Art Building houses studios for animation, ceramics, communication design, drawing, fibers, metals, painting, photography, printmaking, and sculpture. Skidmore has a music program housed in the Arthur Zankel Music Center, which contains a large concert hall and facilities.

=== The Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery ===

The Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery was opened in 2000, and was designed by the architect Antoine Predock. Predock&#x27;s design includes two major gallery wings (the Wachenheim Gallery and the Malloy Wing), two smaller galleries (the State Farm Mezzanine and the Winter Gallery), digitally equipped classrooms, and several event spaces. The Tang is nationally known for both its architecture and its holdings, and its excellence has been recognized by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Art in America&quot;, and &quot;Architectural Digest&quot;, among other publications. The Tang receives roughly 40,000 visitors annually. The Tang recently hosted a retrospective of the work of Alma Thomas in partnership with the Studio Museum in Harlem.

==Student life==
===The Student Government Association===

The Student Government Association (SGA) is the official governing body of students at Skidmore College. It aims to implement programs, events, and policies that establish and maintain high standards of community life, academic scholarship, responsible citizenship, and personal growth. In addition to serving as the official liaison between students and the college administration, the SGA is also responsible for providing events and entertainment for the student body, as well as funding and regulating the approximately 90 student-run clubs and organizations on campus.

===Publications===

====&quot;Salmagundi&quot;====
&quot;Salmagundi&quot; is a quarterly journal that focuses on the humanities and social sciences. Founded by Robert Boyers, a long-time faculty member in the English department, it has been published at Skidmore since 1969 and now has an international subscriber base of several thousand readers.

Nadine Gordimer, J. M. Coetzee, Tzvetan Todorov, George Steiner, Orlando Patterson, Norman Manea, Christopher Hitchens, Seamus Heaney, Mary Gordon, Susan Sontag, Benjamin Barber, Joyce Carol Oates, Richard Howard, Carolyn Forche, Martin Jay, and David Rieff are among the writers who have contributed to &quot;Salmagundi&quot;. Regular columnists include Benjamin Barber, Tzvetan Todorov, Martin Jay, Charles Molesworth, Marilynne Robinson, Carolyn Forché, and Mario Vargas Llosa.

====&quot;The Skidmore News&quot;====
&quot;The Skidmore News&quot; is the college&#x27;s official student-run newspaper. Its staff is composed entirely of students, and it is published on a weekly basis during the academic year. In 2002, the Associated Collegiate Press awarded the newspaper first place for a four-year college weekly for special coverage of the community reaction to the September 11 attacks. In 2010, &quot;The Skidmore News&quot; stopped printing physical copies and moved entirely online.

====&quot;The Skidmo&#x27; Daily&quot;====
&quot;The Skidmo&#x27; Daily&quot; is the college&#x27;s satirical publication. It was founded in 2013 by Jack Rosen &#x27;16, and its editorial board and staff are made up of students. Since July 2016 the paper has been posting content to its website, which includes web-exclusive content not found in the print editions, as well as an archive of print editions.

===National College Comedy Festival===
The National College Comedy Festival is an annual not-for-profit festival of student sketch and improvisational comedy that takes place each winter on campus. The festival, which first was held in February 1990, includes professional workshops.

===Sustainability===
Skidmore&#x27;s Strategic Plan reflects the college&#x27;s commitment to sustainability and includes a pledge to deepen connections with the local community, emphasize planning for sustainable operation, and reduce the college&#x27;s environmental footprint. Three of Skidmore&#x27;s buildings have geothermal heating and cooling systems, and the college has recently hired a sustainability coordinator to assist with efforts to &quot;green&quot; the campus. Skidmore received a grade of &quot;B+&quot; on the Sustainable Endowment Institute&#x27;s &quot;College Sustainability Report Card 2011.&quot;

==Athletics==
Skidmore&#x27;s athletic department, run out of the Williamson Sports Center, currently funds and supports 19 varsity teams, including basketball, ice hockey, rowing and riding. Skidmore is a founding member of the Upstate Collegiate Athletic Association, which was renamed to the Liberty League in 2004. As of 2024, Skidmore has won 11 National Championships and 92 Conference Championships. 

From 1973 until 1982, Skidmore athletic teams were nicknamed the &quot;Wombats&quot;. In 1982 the team nickname was changed to &quot;Thoroughbreds&quot; because it was felt that the wombat &quot;lacked the image of an athlete.&quot;

==In honor==
The SS &quot;Skidmore Victory&quot; (VC2-S-AP3), a World War II cargo ship, was named after the college. Victory ships (VC2) were a class of cargo ship produced in large numbers by American shipyards to replace losses caused by German submarines.

In 2016, Saratoga Race Course named an annual race after the college. &quot;The Skidmore&quot; is run by 2-year-olds every August on turf at 5/12 furlongs.

<text>Paper marbling is a method of aqueous surface design, which can produce patterns similar to smooth marble or other kinds of stone. The patterns are the result of color floated on either plain water or a viscous solution known as size, and then carefully transferred to an absorbent surface, such as paper or fabric. Through several centuries, people have applied marbled materials to a variety of surfaces. It is often employed as a writing surface for calligraphy, and especially book covers and endpapers in bookbinding and stationery. Part of its appeal is that each print is a unique monotype.

== Procedure ==

There are several methods for making marbled papers. A shallow tray is filled with water, and various kinds of ink or paint colors are carefully applied to the surface with an ink brush. Various additives or surfactant chemicals are used to help float the colors. A drop of &quot;negative&quot; color made of plain water with the addition of surfactant is used to drive the drop of color into a ring. The process is repeated until the surface of the water is covered with concentric rings. The floating colors are then carefully manipulated either by blowing on them directly or through a straw, fanning the colors, or carefully using a human hair to stir the colors. 

In the 19th century, the Kyoto-based Japanese master Tokutaro Yagi developed an alternative method that employed a split piece of bamboo to gently stir the colors, resulting in concentric spiral designs. A sheet of &quot;washi&quot; paper is then carefully laid onto the water surface to capture the floating design. The paper, which is often made of (paper mulberry), must be unsized and strong enough to withstand being immersed in water without tearing.

Another method of marbling more familiar to Europeans and Americans is made on the surface of a viscous mucilage, known as &quot;size&quot; or &quot;sizing&quot; in English. While this method is often referred to as &quot;Turkish marbling&quot; in English and called in modern Turkish, ethnic Turkic peoples were not the only practitioners of the art, as Persian, Tajiks, and people of Indian origin also made these papers. The use of the term &quot;Turkish&quot; by Europeans is most likely due to both the fact that many first encountered the art in Istanbul, as well as essentialist references to all Muslims as Turks, much as Europeans were referred to as in Turkish and Persian, which literally means Frankish.

Historic forms of marbling used both organic and inorganic pigments mixed with water for colors, and sizes were traditionally made from gum tragacanth (&quot;Astragalus&quot; spp.), gum karaya, guar gum, fenugreek (&quot;Trigonella foenum-graecum&quot;), fleabane, linseed, and psyllium. Since the late 19th century, a boiled extract of the carrageenan-rich alga known as Irish moss (&quot;Chondrus crispus&quot;), has been employed for sizing. Today, many marblers use powdered carrageenan extracted from various seaweeds. Another plant-derived mucilage is made from sodium alginate. In recent years, a synthetic size made from hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, a common ingredient in instant wallpaper paste, is often used as a size for floating acrylic and oil paints.

In the size-based method, colors made from pigments are mixed with a surfactant such as ox gall. Sometimes, oil or turpentine may be added to a color, to achieve special effects. The colors are then spattered or dropped onto the size, one color after another until there is a dense pattern of several colors. Straw from the broom corn was used to make a kind of whisk for sprinkling the paint, or horsehair to create a kind of drop-brush. Each successive layer of pigment spreads slightly less than the last, and the colors may require additional surfactant to float and uniformly expand. Once the colors are laid down, various tools and implements such as rakes, combs, and styluses are often used in a series of movements to create more intricate designs.

Cobb paper or cloth is often mordanted beforehand with aluminium sulfate (alum) and gently laid onto the floating colors (although methods such as Turkish and Japanese do not require mordanting). The colors are thereby transferred and adhered to the surface of the paper or material. The paper or material is then carefully lifted off the size and hung up to dry. Some marblers gently drag the paper over a rod to draw off the excess size. If necessary, excess bleeding colors and sizing can be rinsed off, and then the paper or fabric is allowed to dry. After the print is made, any color residues remaining on the size are carefully skimmed off of the surface, in order to clear it before starting a new pattern.

Contemporary marblers employ a variety of modern materials, some in place of or in combination with the more traditional ones. A wide variety of colors are used today in place of the historic pigment colors. Plastic broom straw can be used instead of broom corn, as well as bamboo sticks, plastic pipettes, and eye droppers to drop the colors on the surface of the size. Ox gall is still commonly used as a surfactant for watercolors and gouache, but synthetic surfactants are used in conjunction with acrylic, PVA, and oil-based paints.

== History in East Asia ==
An intriguing reference which some think may be a form of marbling is found in a compilation completed in 986 CE entitled &quot;Four Treasures of the Scholar&#x27;s Study&quot; (; ) or edited by the 10th century scholar-official (958–996 CE). This compilation contains information on inkstick, inkstone, ink brush, and paper in China, which are collectively called the four treasures of the study. The text mentions a kind of decorative paper called () meaning &#x27;drifting-sand&#x27; or &#x27;flowing-sand notepaper&#x27; that was made in what is now the region of Sichuan (Su 4: 7a–8a).

This paper was made by dragging a piece of paper through a fermented flour paste mixed with various colors, creating a free and irregular design. A second type was made with a paste prepared from honey locust pods, mixed with croton oil, and thinned with water. Presumably, both black and colored inks were employed. Ginger, possibly in the form of an oil or extract, was used to disperse the colors, or “scatter” them, according to the interpretation given by T.H. Tsien. The colors were said to gather together when a hair-brush was beaten over the design, as dandruff particles was applied to the design by beating a hairbrush over top. The finished designs, which were thought to resemble human figures, clouds, or flying birds, were then transferred to the surface of a sheet of paper. An example of paper decorated with floating ink has never been found in China. Whether or not the above methods employed floating colors remains to be determined (Tsien 94–5).

Su Yijian was an Imperial scholar-official and served as the chief of the Hanlin Academy from about 985–993 CE. He compiled the work from a wide variety of earlier sources and was familiar with the subject, given his profession. Yet it is important to note that it is uncertain how personally acquainted he was with the various methods for making decorative papers that he compiled. He most likely reported information given to him, without having a full understanding of the methods used. His original sources may have predated him by several centuries. Not only is it necessary to identify the original source to attribute a firm date for the information, but also the account remains uncorroborated due to a lack of any surviving physical evidence of marbling in Chinese manuscripts.

In contrast, , which means &#x27;floating ink&#x27; in Japanese, appears to be the earliest form of marbling during the 12th-century Sanjuurokuninshuu , located in Nishihonganji , Kyoto. Author Einen Miura states that the oldest reference to papers are in the &quot;waka&quot; poems of Shigeharu, (825–880 CE), a son of the famed Heian-era poet Narihira (Muira 14) in the Kokin Wakashū, but the verse has not been identified and even if found, it may be spurious. Various claims have been made regarding the origins of . Some think that may have derived from an early form of ink divination (encromancy). Another theory is that the process may have derived from a form of popular entertainment at the time, in which a freshly painted Sumi painting was immersed into water, and the ink slowly dispersed from the paper and rose to the surface, forming curious designs, but no physical evidence supporting these allegations has ever been identified.

According to legend, Jizemon Hiroba is credited as the inventor of . It is said that he felt divinely inspired to make paper after he offered spiritual devotions at the Kasuga Shrine in Nara Prefecture. He then wandered the country looking for the best water with which to make his papers. He arrived in Echizen, Fukui Prefecture where he found the water especially conducive to making . He settled there, and his family carried on with the tradition to this day. The Hiroba family claims to have made this form of marbled paper since 1151 CE for 55 generations (Narita, 14).

== History in the Islamic world ==

The method of floating colors on the surface of mucilaginous sizing is thought to have emerged in the regions of Greater Iran and Central Asia by the late 15th century. It may have first appeared during the end of the Timurid dynasty, whose final capital was in the city of Herat, located in Afghanistan today. Other sources suggest it emerged during the subsequent Shaybanid dynasty, in the cities of Samarqand or Bukhara, in what is now modern Uzbekistan. Whether or not this method was somehow related to earlier Chinese or Japanese methods mentioned above has never been concretely proven.
Several Persian historical accounts refer to () , often shortened to (). Annemarie Schimmel translated this term as &#x27;clouded paper&#x27; in English. While Sami Frashëri claimed in his Kamus-ı Türki, that the term was &quot;more properly derived from the Chagatai word &quot; (); however, he did not reference any source to support this assertion. In contrast, most historical Persian, Turkish, and Urdu texts refer to the paper as alone. Today in Turkey, the art is commonly known as , a cognate of the term first documented in the 19th century. In Iran, many now employ a variant term, (), meaning &#x27;cloud and wind&#x27; for a modern method made with oil colors.

The art first emerged and evolved during the long 16th century in Persia and Transoxiana then spread to the Ottoman Turkey, as well as Mughal and the Deccan Sultanates in India. Within these regions, various methods emerged in which colors were made to float on the surface of a bath of viscous liquid mucilage or &quot;size&quot;, made from various plants including fenugreek seed, onion, gum tragacanth (&quot;astragalus&quot;) and &quot;salep&quot; (the roots of Orchis mascula), among others.

A pair of leaves purported to be the earliest examples of this paper, preserved in the Kronos collection, bears rudimentary droplet-motifs. One of the sheets bears an accession notation on the reverse stating &quot;These abris are rare&quot; () and adds that it was &quot;among the gifts from Iran&quot; to the royal library of Ghiyath Shah, the ruler of the Malwa Sultanate, dated Hijri year 1 Dhu al-Hijjah 901/11 August 1496 of the Common Era.

Approximately a century later, a technically advanced approach using finely prepared mineral and organic pigments and combs to manipulate the floating colors resulted in comparatively elaborate, intricate, and mesmerizing overall designs. Both literary and physical evidence suggests that before 1600, a Safavid-era émigré to India named Muḥammad Ṭāhir developed many of these innovations. Later that century, Indian marblers combined the technique with stencil and resist masking methods to create miniature paintings, attributed to the Deccan sultanates and especially the city of Bijapur in particular, during the Adil Shahi dynasty in the 17th century.

The earliest examples of Ottoman marbled paper may be the margins attached to a cut paper découpage manuscript of the () by the poet Arifi (popularly known as the [&#x27;Ball and Polo-stick&#x27;]) completed by Mehmed bin Gazanfer in 1539–40. Recipes ascribed to one early master by the name of Shebek, appear posthumously in the earliest, anonymously compiled Ottoman miscellany on the art known as the (, &#x27;An Arrangement of a Treatise on Ebrî&#x27;), dated on the basis of internal evidence to after 1615. Many in Turkey attribute another famous 18th-century master Hatip Mehmed Efendi (died 1773) with developing motif and perhaps early floral designs and refer to them as &quot;Hatip&quot; designs, although similar evidence also survives from Iran and India, which await further study.

The current Turkish tradition of dates to the mid-19th century, with a series of masters associated with a branch of the Naqshbandi Sufi order based at what is known as the (Lodge of the Uzbeks), located in Sultantepe, near Üsküdar. The founder of this line, Sadık Effendi (died 1846) allegedly first learned the art in Bukhara and brought it to Istanbul, then taught it to his sons Edhem and Salıh. Based upon this later practice, many Turkish marblers assert that Sufis practiced the art for centuries; however, little evidence supports this claim. Sadık&#x27;s son Edhem Effendi (died 1904) manufactured papers as a kind of cottage industry for the , to supply Istanbul&#x27;s burgeoning printing industry with the paper, purportedly tied into bundles and sold by weight. Many of his papers feature designs made with turpentine, analogous to what English-speaking marblers refer to as the &quot;stormont&quot; pattern.

The premier student of Edhem Efendi, Necmeddin Okyay (1885–1976), first taught the art at the Fine Arts Academy in Istanbul. He famously innovated elaborate floral designs, in addition to &quot;,&quot; a method of writing traditional calligraphy using a gum arabic resist masking applied before marbling the sheet. Okyay&#x27;s premier student, Mustafa Düzgünman (1920–1990), taught many contemporary marblers in Turkey today. He codified the traditional repertoire of patterns, to which he only added a floral daisy design, after the manner of his teacher.

== History in Europe ==

In the 17th century, European travelers to the Middle East collected examples of these papers and bound them into album amicorum, which literally means &quot;album of friends&quot; in Latin, and is a forerunner of the modern autograph album. Eventually, the technique for making the papers reached Europe, where they became a popular covering material not only for book covers and end-papers, but also for lining chests, drawers, and bookshelves. By the late 17th century, Europeans also started to marbled the edges of books.

The methods of marbling attracted the curiosity of intellectuals, philosophers, and scientists. Gerhard ter Brugghen published the earliest European technical account, written in Dutch, in his in Amsterdam in 1616, while the first German account was written by Daniel Schwenter, published posthumously in his in 1671 (Benson, &quot;Curious Colors&quot;, 284; Wolfe, 16). Athanasius Kircher published a Latin account in &quot;Ars Magna Lucis et Umbræ&quot; in Rome in 1646, widely disseminated knowledge of the art throughout Europe. Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert published a thorough overview of the art with illustrations of marblers at work together with images of the tools of the trade in their &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;.

In 1695, the Bank of England employed partially marbled papers banknotes for several weeks until it discovered that William Chaloner had successfully forged similar notes (Benson, &quot;Curious Colors&quot;, 289–294). Nevertheless, the Bank continued to issued partially marbled cheques until the 1810s (Benson, &quot;Curious Colors&quot;, 301–302). In 1731, English marbler Samuel Pope obtained a patent for security marbling, claiming that he invented the process, then sued his competitors for infringement; however, those he accused exposed him for patent fraud (Benson, &quot;Curious Colors&quot;, 294–301). Benjamin Franklin obtained English marbled security papers employed for printing Continental Congress $20 banknote in 1775, as well as promissory notes to support the American Revolutionary War, threepence notes issued during the Copper Panic of 1789, as well as his own personal cheques (Benson, &quot;Curious Colors&quot;, 302–307).

== Nineteenth century ==

After English marbler Charles Woolnough published his &quot;The Art of Marbling&quot; (1853), the art production increased in the 19th century. In it, he describes how he adapted a method of marbling onto book cloth, which he exhibited at the Crystal Palace Exhibition in 1851. (Wolfe, 79) Josef Halfer, a bookbinder of German origin, who lived in Budakeszi, Hungary conducted extensive experiments and devised further innovations, chiefly by adapting &quot;Chondrus crispus&quot; for sizing, which superseded Woolnough&#x27;s methods in Europe and the US.

== In the 21st century ==

Marblers still make marbled paper and fabric, even applying the technique to three-dimensional surfaces. Aside from continued traditional applications, artists now explore using the method as a kind of painting technique, and as an element in collage. In recent decades, international symposia and museum exhibitions featured the art. A marbling journal &quot;Ink &amp; Gall&quot; sponsored the first International Marblers&#x27; Gathering held in Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1989. Active international groups can be found on social media networks such as Facebook and the International Marbling Network.

Another adaptation called body marbling has emerged at public events and festivals, applied with non-toxic, water-based neon or ultraviolet reactive paints.

<text>Yibin (; Sichuanese Pinyin: ȵi2bin1; Sichuanese pronunciation: ) is a prefecture-level city in the southeastern part of Sichuan province, China, located at the junction of the Min and Yangtze Rivers. Its population was 4,588,804 inhabitants, according to the 2020 census, of whom 2,158,312 lived in the built-up area comprising three urban districts.

==History==
Human habitation of Yibin dates back at least 4,000 years. At that time, this place was one of the important birthplaces of ancient Bashu culture.Yibin was established as a county in the Han dynasty (206 BC − AD 220). Under the Ming and Qing, the town and its hinterland was known as Xuzhou Commandery &quot;Xùzhōufǔ&quot;), which was variously romanized as Suifu, Suifoo, Xufu, and Suchow. Its population around 1907 was estimated at 50,000.

==Geography and climate==

Yibin is located in the southeast portion of Sichuan at the southern end of the Sichuan Basin, bordering Zhaotong (Yunnan) to the south, Luzhou to the east, Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture and Leshan to the west, and Zigong to the north, and has a total area is . The city ranges in latitude from 27° 50&#x27;−29° 16&#x27; N, and in longitude from 103° 36&#x27;−105° 20&#x27; E, stretching east-west and north-south.

The city is located at the confluence of the Min and Yangtze Rivers. Above Yibin, the Yangtze is also known as the Jinsha River. Below Yibin, the Yangtze is known in Chinese as the &quot;Chang Jiang&quot; or &quot;Long River.&quot;

As with the rest of the Sichuan Basin, Yibin has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cwa&quot;) with high humidity year-round; winters are short and mild while summers are long, hot, and humid. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July and August; the annual mean is . Despite its location in the Yangtze River valley, it is still cooler than Chongqing, located further downstream, in its warmest months. Frost is uncommon and the frost-free period lasts 347 days. Rainfall is common year-round but is the greatest in July and August, with very little of it in the cooler months. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 10% in December and January to 42% in August, the city receives only 1,018 hours of bright sunshine annually; Yibin has one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, lower than even nearby Chengdu and Chongqing. Spring (March–April) tends to be sunnier and warmer in the day than autumn (October–November).

==Administrative divisions==

==Economy==
The city&#x27;s industry focuses on electronics, food products, and power generation. It also produces paper, silk, and leather products. The surrounding region is rich in agricultural resources, growing rice, barley, oil seeds, sesame, and tea.

The largest employer in Yibin is Wuliangye Yibin, a company best known for Wuliangye, a brand of sorghum-based distilled spirits known as baijiu. The Wuliangye Group grew from a small company employing just 300 people in 1977 into a large company employing over 20,000 on a seven-square-kilometer plant. According to an August 2005 article in a securities weekly, the Wuliangye Group is 72% state-owned and provides 70% of the revenues of Yibin City, a major regional center at the head of the Yangtze in southeastern Sichuan. In 2004 6,225 retired military worked for the company, out of a total work force of over 20,000. A third of top management positions are held by retired members of the military. Unsuccessful efforts to diversify its business, poor transparency and a murky ownership pictures are among the company&#x27;s problems today.

== Education ==
There are several notable education institutes, including Yibin University, also known as Yiyuan, which offers a range of academic programs in a picturesque setting in Cuiping, Yibin. The university is known for providing a secure academic environment. Yibin Vocational and Technical College, held by the Yibin Municipal People&#x27;s Government, is another prominent institute offering vocational and technical programs to equip students with practical skills.

==Transportation==
The region&#x27;s natural waterways provide transportation links with the surrounding area, and Yibin is also connected to Chongqing and Chengdu by rail and express highway. Yibin&#x27;s proximity to the Yunnan and Guizhou borders also means that transportation to the provinces is available by rail and by bus.

Yibin has three bridges over the &quot;Chang Jiang&quot; section of the Yangtze and ten bridges over the Jinsha.

Yibin Wuliangye Airport offers flights to Beijing, Guangzhou, Guiyang, Hangzhou, Kunming, Lhasa, Sanya, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Xi&#x27;an, and Yichang.

Yibin opened the world&#x27;s second Autonomous Rail Rapid Transit/&quot;trackless tram&quot; system in December 2019.


==Tourism==
There are several hot springs near Yibin, plus many other tourist attractions. Such attractions include the Bamboo Sea in Changning County and the Xingwen Stone Forest. Yibin is also the confluence of the Min and Jinsha Rivers, which together form the &quot;Chang Jiang&quot; as the Yangtze River is known in Chinese, from Yibin to Shanghai. Cuiping Mountain Park (), located west of the confluence of those two rivers, provides views of downtown Yibin.

<doc id="718355" wikidata="Q5172929" url="?curid=718355" title="Corrida (horse)">
<text>Corrida (1932 – probably 1944) was a French Thoroughbred racehorse who won races in France, Belgium, Germany and England and is regarded as one of the top fillies of the 20th century worldwide. She is best known for her back-to-back wins in France&#x27;s most prestigious horse race, the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe.

== Racing career ==
Corrida in Latin languages translates as bullfight. At age two, she won the Prix Morny and was second by a head to Pampeiro in the Grand Critérium. At age three, owner Marcel Boussac shipped Corrida to England, where trainer George Lambton prepared her at Newmarket Racecourse. Entered in the 1,000 Guineas and The Oaks, Corrida performed poorly, and after a third lackluster effort was returned to France. There, Corrida won the Grand Prix de Marseille at Hippodrome de Marseille Borely and had three placings in major races including a third in the 1935 Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe.

In 1936, she blossomed into the most dominant horse in France. That year, Corrida won seven major races. In England, she captured the Hardwicke Stakes at Ascot Racecourse, then won the Grand Prix Prince Rose at Hippodrome Wellington, in Ostend, Belgium and in France the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud, the Prix d&#x27;Hédouville, the Prix du Prince de Galles, and the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe, and repeated her win in the Grand Prix de Marseille.

In 1937, Corrida returned to Belgium to win her second straight Grand International d&#x27;Ostende and traveled to Berlin, Germany, where she won the Grosser Preis von Reichshauptstadt. In October at Hippodrome de Longchamp in Paris, she continued to dominate the colts, becoming the first female horse to ever win the 1½ mile Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe twice.

== Retirement ==
Corrida was retired to her owner&#x27;s Haras de Fresnay-le-Buffard breeding farm in Neuvy-au-Houlme in Lower Normandy. She was bred to the champion sire Tourbillon and produced Coaraze, who won a number of important French races, including the Prix du Jockey Club and the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. Coaraze was her only offspring to survive the German occupation of France in World War II. Following the D-Day landing at Normandy by the Allied Forces, Corrida disappeared from the pasture at Haras de Fresnay-le-Buffard during the Battle of the Falaise Gap. No trace of her was ever found.
