<text>The governor of Puerto Rico () is the head of government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and commander-in-chief of the Puerto Rico National Guard. Currently, Jenniffer González-Colón is serving as the 190th governor of the archipelago and island. 

The governor has a duty to enforce local laws, to convene the Legislative Assembly, the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Legislative Assembly, to appoint government officers, to appoint justices, and to grant pardons. Since 1948, the governor has been elected by the people of Puerto Rico. Prior to that, the governor was appointed either by the king of Spain (1510–1898) or the president of the United States (1898–1948).

Article IV of the Constitution of Puerto Rico vests the executive power on the governor and empowers them with the faculty to appoint officers. These two faculties in allow the governor to delegate most of their functions while continuing to be the chief executive and head of government.

==History== 

The first known and recorded heads of government in the history of Puerto Rico were the &quot;caciques&quot;, the tribal chiefs of the natives known as &quot;Taínos&quot; that inhabited the island before the arrival of Spaniards. It is believed that the &quot;cacique&quot; rank was apparently established through democratic means. His importance in the tribe was determined by the size of his tribe rather than his warlord skills, since the Taínos were mostly a pacifist culture. Agüeybaná I is the most-well known cacique as he was the one governing all others when the Spaniards arrived in 1493 although many others existed during his period, as well as before and after him.

===Spanish colonial era===
When the Spanish Empire colonized Puerto Rico during the 16th century, the Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de León established himself as the island&#x27;s first governor. Vicente Yáñez Pinzón had been appointed to take the position of Captain General of the City of Puerto Rico prior to the island&#x27;s colonization, but he never performed this function. As part of the Spanish Empire, the Spanish monarchy was in charge of appointing the governor of Puerto Rico. The person selected was in charge of the island&#x27;s development and wealth and was responsible for reporting the colony&#x27;s status to the government in Spain.

The first native Puerto Rican to perform the function was Juan Ponce de León II, grandson of the conquistador, who served as interim governor in 1579.

After 1580 Puerto Rico&#x27;s government was established as the Captaincy General of Puerto Rico, and subsequent governors held the office of Captain General as well.

===As a United States unincorporated territory===
On July 25, 1898, at the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, Puerto Rico was invaded by the United States. Following the conclusion of the war, Spain was forced to cede Puerto Rico, along with Cuba, the Philippines and Guam, to the United States under the 1898 Treaty of Paris. Puerto Rico began the twentieth century under the military rule of the United States with officials, including the governor, who were appointed by the President of the United States.

In 1900, William McKinley signed the Foraker Act as a United States federal law, which established civilian (limited popular) government on Puerto Rico. The new government had a governor and an executive council appointed by the President, a House of Representatives with 35 elected members, a judicial system with a Supreme Court, and a non-voting Resident Commissioner in Congress. The first civilian governor of the island under the Foraker Act was Charles Herbert Allen. This system was still used after the approval of the Jones–Shafroth Act, which altered the structure of government in Puerto Rico, and was in use until 1948.

Following the approval of the federal Elective Governor Act by President Harry S. Truman in 1947, the governor has been elected through a democratic process every four years since 1948. At that time, Luis Muñoz Marín became the first democratically elected governor.

The current governmental structure was established under the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, ratified in 1952. Sitting governor Luis Muñoz Marín was re-elected as the first governor under the Constitution. Under Article IV of the Constitution, the governor continues to be popularly elected every four years and is the head of the Commonwealth&#x27;s executive branch. The governor-elect takes office on January 2 of the following year in a public inaugural ceremony which may be preceded by a private oath-taking ceremony.

==Powers==
The governor is head of the government of Puerto Rico. They have the power to veto legislation that the Puerto Rican legislature passes. The governor also has the power to appoint the members of their cabinet, who in turn must be ratified by the Legislature. The governor also has the power to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court and all the lower courts of the island.

The governor must address the legislature at the beginning of each year to present two speeches, one is the &quot;State of the Commonwealth&quot; speech and another in which the governor presents the &quot;Recommended Budget&quot; for the next fiscal year, in which the governor proposes to the legislature a budget. They are also the commander-in-chief of the Puerto Rico National Guard and the chief diplomat.
==Eligibility==
On July 25, 1952, the Constitution of Puerto Rico was enacted by Governor Muñoz Marín after the approval by Congress and the President of the United States. Pursuant to section Three, Article IV of the Constitution of Puerto Rico, the governor must be a citizen of the United States, a resident of Puerto Rico for five consecutive years prior and at least 35 years old at the time of the election.

The governor serves a four-year term which begins on the second day of January after the year of their election and ends on the date their successor takes office. Consecutive service is unlimited, according to the Constitution of the Island. Luis Muñoz Marín, its first elected governor, served for four consecutive terms from 1949 to 1965, but almost all subsequent governors served either one or two terms; the Constitution of the Commonwealth was ratified by the people of Puerto Rico in 1952. Rafael Hernández Colón, however, served three non-consecutive terms: first from 1973 to 1977, and then from 1985 to 1993.

==Elections==
The governor is elected by a direct vote of the people. Candidates typically represent a political party, with every elected governor to date () having been a member of the New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico or the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico. Only a plurality vote (more than any other candidate) is required to win election, rather than a majority (more than half the votes).

The Puerto Rico Elections Code states that if the margin of victory of a candidate is less than 0.5% of the votes, a full recount must take place. So far, only in the gubernatorial elections of 1980 and 2004 has a recount occurred.

==Succession==
Upon the death, resignation, or removal from office (by impeachment and conviction) of a sitting governor, the secretary of state would then take the office of governor until the end of the four-year term. In case the secretary of state is unwilling or unable to assume it, the secretary of justice would assume the governorship, followed by the secretary of treasury, the secretary of education, the secretary of labor and human resources, the secretary of transportation and public works, the secretary of economic development and commerce, the secretary of health and the secretary of agriculture. If none of them is available for succession the Legislative Assembly meets to elect by majority vote of all of its members a governor for the rest of the term. Other provisions exist for the transition between an incumbent governor and a governor-elect.

Similar to some U.S. states, such as California, if the governor is temporarily away from Puerto Rico, the secretary of state, or in their absence the highest ranking Cabinet member in the line of succession, becomes acting governor until the governor&#x27;s return. In decades past, when off-island gubernatorial travel was infrequent, the powers of the governorship rarely devolved upon the secretary of state or other Cabinet officers. More accessible travel has made the acting governorship a much more common occurrence. During recent times, not only has the secretary of state frequently served as acting governor, but the secretary of justice, and secretary of treasury have as well.

===2019 leadership crisis===
On July 24, 2019, Governor Ricardo Rosselló announced his resignation after two weeks of protests and demonstrations in Puerto Rico. He became the first elected governor to resign. His resignation took effect on August 2, 2019, at 5 pm. Before leaving office, Rosselló nominated Pedro Pierluisi as secretary of state, intending to make Pierluisi his successor, but his nomination was not approved by the full legislature before Rosselló&#x27;s resignation took effect. Despite not having been confirmed by the Senate of Puerto Rico, Pierluisi was sworn in as governor, which prompted a legal challenge. Less than a week later, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico declared that Pierluisi had taken office on unconstitutional grounds and removed him from office, effective 5 p.m. AST on August 7. At that time, the next in line was then Secretary of Justice, Wanda Vázquez Garced, who became governor following the original line of succession as it was on August 2 at 5 pm.

<doc id="708722" wikidata="Q7722641" url="?curid=708722" title="The Choirboys (novel)">
<text>The Choirboys (), a novel, is a controversial 1975 work of fiction written by Los Angeles Police Department officer-turned-novelist Joseph Wambaugh. In 1995 the novel was selected by the Mystery Writers of America as Number 93 of &quot;The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time&quot;.

&quot;The Choirboys&quot; is a tragicomic parody about the effects of urban police work on young officers, seen through the exploits of a group of Los Angeles police officers in the Wilshire Division of the Los Angeles Police Department while an investigation is being conducted into an alleged shooting that took place in MacArthur Park, a frequent hangout of the group.

== Plot summary ==
A group of ten patrol officers on the nightwatch conducts end-of-shift get-togethers they euphemistically call &quot;choir practices&quot; (possibly to hide their true nature from superiors but actually a sardonic reference). These &quot;choir practices&quot; almost always involve heavy drinking, complaints about their superior officers, and war stories (and, occasionally, group sex with a pair of lusty, overweight barmaids). They hold the choir practices in MacArthur Park because it is in another division&#x27;s territory and &quot;one does not shit in one&#x27;s own nest.&quot;

Each of the officers is disillusioned, to varying degrees, that many of the people they&#x27;re paid to protect are not unlike the suspects they arrest, and that the ridiculous regulations of their department are onerously enforced on them while their commanders (without skills in police work) indulge themselves hypocritically. Wambaugh&#x27;s portrayals of the ten officers are archetypes of varied personalities found in police departments in the 1970s, albeit well-drawn, but his most cutting descriptions are saved for the brutal &quot;black-glove officer,&quot; Roscoe Rules. The theme of police officer suicide (also known as &quot;eating your gun&quot;), which runs through many of Wambaugh&#x27;s books, provides a grim undercurrent to the black humor of the novel and suggests a sub-conscious motivation for their activities.

== Reception and cultural influence ==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; said in 1975 that &quot;Very little in Wambaugh&#x27;s first two novels prepares one for the scabrous humor and ferocity of &quot;The Choir Boys&quot;.&quot;

Due to the popularity of the book, the slang term &quot;choir practice&quot; became a somewhat popular euphemism for off-duty recreational activities even if it does not involve alcohol.

&quot;The Choirboys&quot; is considered an indictment of the LAPD hierarchy in several ways: the choirboys&#x27; dislike and distrust of command-level officers; the way the investigation into the shooting was handled; and many of their superiors&#x27; apathetic attitudes about the pressures officers have to deal with. Wambaugh, however, summarized the conduct of the choirboys both on and off-duty by having Sgt. Yanov, their field supervisor, comment to his superior at the conclusion: &quot;They weren&#x27;t troublemakers...they were just policemen. Rather ordinary young guys. Maybe a little lonelier than some. Or scared.&quot;

Wambaugh&#x27;s previous LAPD novels, &quot;The New Centurions&quot; and &quot;The Blue Knight&quot;, had been conventional and straightforward portrayals of his experiences. With &quot;The Choirboys&quot; he &quot;found his voice,&quot; and thereafter his novels were stylistic lampoons of not only the Los Angeles police world but the Hollywood lifestyle, and often filled with black comedy. Wambaugh, by then a successful author, resigned from the LAPD after fourteen years of service in order to publish &quot;The Choirboys&quot; without retribution from those he burlesqued. &quot;The Choirboys&quot; is also significant in that Wambaugh turned to the bizarre anecdotes of others (which he terms &quot;cop talk&quot;) to provide the grist for his writing after previously drawing from his own experience.

== The Choirboys ==
The nightwatch radio cars of Wilshire Station:

===7-A-1: Spermwhale Whalen and Baxter Slate===
At age 52, Herbert &quot;Spermwhale&quot; Whalen is the oldest and, legitimately, the toughest of the choirboys. However, unlike Roscoe Rules, he isn&#x27;t &quot;an insufferable prick,&quot; although he has the same contempt for most &quot;civilians, police brass and station supervisors, and all members of the Civil Service Department.&quot; A nineteen-year veteran, Whalen considers anyone with less tenure a rookie. Whalen was a transport pilot in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. He attained the rank of major as a reservist in the Air Force. Whalen is the only choirboy who never attended college. He carries a cropped mugshot of his dead son because it&#x27;s the last photo taken of him before he died. He&#x27;s been married three times and says he respects the second one the most because she had the most fortitude to take him for nearly everything he owned.

Baxter Slate, almost 27, is a handsome cynic with a baccalaureate in classical literature, which he considers worthless; can tell dirty jokes in Latin; and amuses himself by confounding Roscoe Rules with his advanced vocabulary. Outwardly, Slate appears to be the most stable of the officers, but he is tormented by inner demons, particularly emotional scars from working child abuse cases, and is driven to suicide because of his shame in inadvertently being caught by Sam Niles in a humiliating encounter with a dominatrix.

===7-A-29: Sam Niles and Harold Bloomguard===
Sam Niles and Harold Bloomguard, both 26, are, like many police officers of the era, Vietnam veterans, former Marines who were trapped together in a North Vietnamese Army cave during their tour. Harold found a father figure in Sam and followed him into the LAPD, where both obtained college degrees in their off-duty time.

On the surface Niles is the dominant of the two. From a background of poverty and abuse, Niles is uncomfortable with all relationships, hastily marrying a coed. They were divorced as quickly. Although he tolerates his partner, he also fears him because Harold knows his innermost shame and secret, the helpless weakness he once showed in the cave.

Bloomguard is the opposite. He&#x27;s a physical and emotional weakling who attached himself to Sam Niles and dotes on his partner. While Niles had no difficulty meeting all the police selection requirements, Bloomguard, who barely met the height requirement, gorged himself on high-calorie food for three days just to meet the weight requirement. Bloomguard is a protector of the ducks at MacArthur Park and other small and meek animals.

Due to his Vietnam experience, Niles developed severe claustrophobia, which becomes a key factor in the MacArthur Park shooting. Harold Bloomguard was the &quot;driving force behind the inception of the MacArthur Park choir practice.&quot;

===7-A-33: Spencer Van Moot and Willie Wright ===
At 40, Spencer Van Moot is the second-oldest of the Choirboys and their &quot;great provider&quot;, taking the fullest advantage of free meals, cigarettes, and other gratuities offered to uniformed officers by businesses within the division&#x27;s jurisdiction. He is also a connoisseur of food and fashion and spends much of the time at choir practices complaining about his failing third marriage.

&quot;Father&quot; Willie Wright is a short, chubby 24-year-old officer. A converted and thoroughly devout Jehovah&#x27;s Witness, Father Willie is, like his partner, in an unhappy marriage, but in his case, his unhappiness is due primarily to an obsessively religious wife who would rather distribute &quot;Watchtower&quot; magazines door-to-door on his days off than have sex with him. Wright joined the Choirboys out of loneliness and frustration. His guilt-driven, drunken sermons over the evils of drink and marital infidelity, despite the fact that he frequently engaged in both, earned him the moniker &quot;Father&quot; Willie Wright.

===7-A-77: Calvin Potts and Francis Tanaguchi===
Calvin Potts, 28, is a recently divorced black officer and an alcoholic like the rest of his middle-class Baldwin Hills family. His ex-wife&#x27;s father is one of Los Angeles&#x27; top black attorneys who convinced the divorce judge to order Potts to pay nearly half of his salary in alimony and child support, so that Potts now rides an old Schwinn bicycle to work.

Francis Tanaguchi, 25, is a third-generation Japanese-American who was raised in the barrios of Los Angeles, and &quot;unquestionably, the biggest pain in the ass on the nightwatch at Wilshire Station&quot;. He believes, at heart, that he&#x27;s more Hispanic than Asian and goes to great lengths to de-emphasize his Japanese ancestry. Francis is also an inveterate practical joker, once pretending to be a vampire for three weeks and suspected of being behind the anonymous sultry female voice nicknamed &quot;The Dragon Lady&quot; who makes anonymous phone calls to the homes of the choirboys in the middle of the night. Potts and Tanaguchi are collectively referred to as &quot;The Gook and The Spook.&quot;

===7-A-85: Roscoe Rules and Dean Pratt ===
Henry &quot;Roscoe&quot; Rules, 29, is a five-year veteran of the LAPD. He is brutal and mean, a bully. He was nicknamed &quot;Roscoe&quot; during a choir practice when he referred to his police-issue .38 special as a &quot;roscoe&quot; after watching a Humphrey Bogart movie on television. Of all the officers, he is the one most intent on proving he is the toughest cop on the force and refers to people he dislikes (which is just about everyone) as &quot;scrotes&quot; (short for scrotums). The word was coined by Father Willie Wright for Roscoe to use in reference to people since Rules felt that the word &quot;asshole&quot; was overused in police work, and the word scrotum too long. Of the word &quot;scrote&quot; as used by Roscoe Rules, Baxter Slate quips that it is &quot;a philosophy in a word&quot;. Rules hates the city and lives on a &quot;ranch&quot; sixty miles from it, &quot;east of Chino&quot;. To describe just how mean Roscoe Rules is, fellow officers created an inside joke that Roscoe Rules &quot;handed out towels in the showers at Auschwitz&quot;.

Dean &quot;Whaddayamean Dean&quot; Pratt, 25, is a bachelor who fears Roscoe and kowtows to his every impulse. Pratt is notorious for being unable to tolerate even moderate amounts of alcohol. When inebriated, Dean is incapable of holding even the simplest of conversations. &quot;Any question, statement, piece of smalltalk would be met by an idiotic frustrating maddening double beseechment: &quot;I don&#x27;t get it. I don&#x27;t get it.&quot; Or, &quot;Whaddaya trying to say? Whaddaya trying to say?&quot; Or, most frequently heard, &quot;Whaddaya mean? Whaddaya mean?&quot;&quot;

==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==

In 1977, &quot;The Choirboys&quot; was adapted into a film starring Charles Durning, Perry King, James Woods, Louis Gossett Jr. and Randy Quaid. Ultimately the film was unsuccessful and critically panned. The entire ending was changed for the film, and critics complained that while the book showed the police officers as sympathetic characters, the film painted them as a bunch of drunken jerks. Wambaugh himself refused to have his name associated with the film, as he considered it to be an extremely poor interpretation of his novel. He later said that the experience led him to produce his own films to protect his literary work.

Several characters had their names changed from what they had been in the novel:
Sam Niles - Sam Lyles, Calvin Potts - Calvin Motts, Willie Wright - &quot;Father&quot; Sartino, Dean Pratt - Dean Proust.

<text>Michael Stewart (August 1, 1924 – September 20, 1987) was an American playwright and dramatist, librettist, lyricist, screenwriter and novelist.

==Life and career==
Born Myron Stuart Rubin in Manhattan, Stewart attended Queens College, and graduated from the Yale School of Drama with a Master of Fine Arts in 1953.

His early work was writing sketches for the revues &quot;The Shoestring Revue&quot; (1955), &quot;The Littlest Revue&quot; (1956), and &quot;Shoestring &#x27;57&quot; (1956, Barbizon-Plaza, New York). He then joined the staff writers of Sid Caesar&#x27;s television program, &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Hour&quot;.

He met Charles Strouse and Lee Adams in 1954, and several years after collaborated with them and Gower Champion on the 1960 Broadway musical &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;. He worked again with Champion and Jerry Herman, with their musical &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; opening on Broadway in 1964.

Stewart died on September 20, 1987, in New York City. Jule Styne said of him: &quot;He was an extremely talented and knowledgeable man of the theater. He was one of the great musical-theater writers, and his string of hits showed that.&quot; Stewart&#x27;s sister was writer Francine Pascal and brother Burt Rubin.

<doc id="708752" wikidata="Q1018122" url="?curid=708752" title="Buttermere">
<text>Buttermere is a lake in the Lake District in North West England. It has a length of approximately and a maximum width of , an area of , a maximum depth of , and a surface elevation of above sea level. Its primary outflow is Buttermere Dubs, a short stream which connects the lake to Crummock Water. From Crummock Water the River Cocker flows to Cockermouth, where it joins the River Derwent and finally enters the Irish Sea at Workington. The lake is in the unitary authority of Cumberland, and the ceremonial county of Cumbria.

==Geography==
The lake is long by wide, and is deep. It has an elevation above sea level of . It is situated towards the head of the valley of the River Cocker and is surrounded by fells, notably the High Stile range to the south west, Robinson to the north-east, Fleetwith Pike and Haystacks to the south-east and Grasmoor to the north-west.

The village of Buttermere stands at the north-western end of the lake, and beyond this is Crummock Water. There is a path around the lake which is about long, and at one point runs through a rock tunnel beneath the locality of Hassness. Access is by road, from Cockermouth in the north-west; from Borrowdale via the Honister Pass; or from Braithwaite and the Newlands Valley via Newlands Hause.

==Etymology==
There are two possible origins for the name &quot;Buttermere&quot;:

One, that Buttermere means &quot;the lake by the dairy pastures&quot; (from the Old English &quot;butere mere&quot;). Whaley suggests this as the correct interpretation: &quot; &#x27;butter lake, the lake with good pasture-land&#x27;, from OE &#x27;butere&#x27; &#x27;butter&#x27;, conveying the fertile nature of the flat alluvial land at both ends of the lake, plus &#x27;mere&#x27; &#x27;lake&#x27;...&quot;

Two, that it is the corrupt form of a personal name. Robert Ferguson asserts in his 1866 work, &quot;The Northmen in Cumberland and Westmoreland&quot; that Buttermere derives from the Old Norse personal name &quot;Buthar&quot;, as in &quot;Buthar&#x27;s mere&quot; (lake). This accords with local tradition, which says that the valley of Buttermere was part of the holdings of an 11th-century Norse chieftain called &quot;Buthar&quot; (sometimes spelt &quot;Boethar&quot;). Large numbers of Vikings settled in the Cumbrian area during the 9th and 10th centuries and many names in the area are of Norse origin: streams are termed &#x27;becks&#x27;, from the Old Norse &quot;bekkr&quot;; mountains are &#x27;fells&#x27;, from the Norse &quot;fjall&quot;; waterfalls are forces, from &quot;fos&quot;; ravines are &#x27;gills&#x27;; valleys are &#x27;dales&#x27;, from &quot;dalr&quot; (ON); and small lakes are termed &#x27;tarns&#x27;, which derives from &quot;tjorn&quot;, meaning teardrop. Whaley suggests that the personal name interpretation is incorrect, but notes that the Victoria County History &quot;deemed it &#x27;not disputed that the family of the Scotic ruler, Bueth or Boet, held its own against the Norman intruder&#x27;, with possession of the barony of Gillesland, for fifty years after the Norman Conquest.&quot;

See article on Buttermere at the English Lakes.com website.

==History==
From his hidden stronghold at Buttermere, it is said that Jarl Buthar conducted a campaign of running resistance against the Norman invaders, from the time of William the Conqueror&#x27;s Harrying of the North in 1069 right up until the early 12th century. In 1072 King William set up a garrison at Carlisle, but the isolated garrison needed constant reinforcement and supplies. It is claimed that the Cumbrians fought a guerrilla war against the Normans for almost half a century, attacking supply wagons, ambushing patrols and inflicting great losses upon them in terms of money, material and men.

The extent to which Jarl Buthar is a semi-mythological figure is unclear. He is apparently mentioned in 12th-century Norman documents, but much of his story appears to be based on local legend and archaeology, later enhanced by Nicholas Size&#x27;s popular dramatised history (see below).

Jarl Boethar&#x27;s campaign and a final battle at Rannerdale (c.f. Ferguson, &quot;Ragnar&#x27;s dale&quot;) between the Normans and the Anglo-Scandinavian Cumbrians led by the Jarl is the subject of a dramatised history by Nicholas Size, called &quot;The Secret Valley: The Real Romance of Unconquered Lakeland&quot;, published in 1930.

Rosemary Sutcliff&#x27;s YA novel &quot;Shield Ring&quot;, published in 1956, imagines the lives of Jarl Buthar and his band of Cumbrian rebels, and their last stand against the forces of a Norman army under the command of Ranulf le Meschin, Lord of Carlisle and later Earl of Chester, nearly 50 years after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. It was clearly inspired by Nicholas Size&#x27;s history, which it closely follows.

Mary Robinson (1778–1837), known as the &quot;Maid of Buttermere&quot; and the subject of Melvyn Bragg&#x27;s novel of that name, was the daughter of the landlord of the Fish Inn in Buttermere village.

The lake is owned by the National Trust, it forms part of its Buttermere and Ennerdale property.

<doc id="708759" wikidata="Q1230745" url="?curid=708759" title="William Mulready">
<text>William Mulready (1 April 1786 – 7 July 1863) was an Irish genre painter living in London. He is best known for his romanticising depictions of rural scenes, and for creating Mulready stationery letter sheets, issued at the same time as the Penny Black postage stamp.

==Life and family==
William Mulready was born in Ennis, County Clare. Early in his life, in 1792, the family moved to London, where he was able to get an education and was taught painting well enough so that he was accepted at the Royal Academy School at the age of fourteen.
In 1802, he married Elizabeth Varley (1784–1864), a landscape painter. She came from a family of established artists; her brothers included John Varley, friend of William Blake, Cornelius Varley, and William Fleetwood Varley.

Their three children, Paul Augustus (1805–1864), William (1805–1878), and Michael (1807–1889) also became artists. His relationship with his wife however deteriorated gradually over the years, which is detailed in papers stored at the library of the Victoria and Albert Museum. His strong Catholic beliefs prevented any chance of a divorce but they separated. He accused her of &quot;bad conduct&quot; but shied from providing details. In a letter to him in 1827 she blamed him entirely for the collapse of their marriage, suggesting cruelty, pederastic activities and adultery were the reasons, writing that one of his pupils, Harriet Gouldsmith, had told her Malready &quot;preferred her little finger&quot; to his wife and children, and accusing him having &quot;had taken a low boy to your bed, and turned one adrift at midnight, to seek one at the house of an unmarried man&quot;.

His son, William Mulready Junior (1805–1878), lived in London and maintained a career of a portrait painter and picture restorer. He had five children (Ellen, Mary, Augustus Edwin, Henry William, and John). They also were trained as artists, but not all of them pursued the artistic career: Henry William and John described themselves as &#x27;house painters&#x27;. Augustus Edwin Mulready (1844–1904) was the most successful of them and became known as a member of the Cranbrook Colony of artists.
==Artistic career==
Many of his early pictures show landscapes, before he started to build a reputation as a genre painter from 1808 on, painting mostly everyday scenes from rural life. He also illustrated children&#x27;s books including the first edition of Charles and Mary Lamb&#x27;s &quot;Tales from Shakespeare&quot; in 1807; William Roscoe&#x27;s entertaining poem &quot;The Butterfly&#x27;s Ball, and the Grasshopper&#x27;s Feast&quot; in the same year; and a sequel to the latter by Catherine Ann Dorset. Some of these were for the Juvenile Library of William Godwin and Mary Jane Clairmont; Godwin in turn wrote, under a pseudonym, an account of Mulready&#x27;s early life, suitable for children.

Mulready&#x27;s paintings were popular in Victorian times. His first painting of importance, &quot;Returning from the Ale House&quot;, now in the Tate Gallery, London, under the title &quot;Fair Time&quot;, appeared in 1809.
In 1815 he became an Associate of the Royal Academy (A.R.A.) and R.A. in 1816. In the same year, he also was awarded the French &quot;Legion of Honour&quot;. Mulready&#x27;s most important pictures are in the Victoria and Albert Museum and in the Tate Gallery. In the former are 33, among them &quot;Hampstead Heath&quot; (1806); &quot;Giving a Bite&quot; (1836); &quot;First Love&quot; (1839); &quot;The Sonnet&quot; (1839); &quot;Choosing the Wedding Gown&quot; (1846); and &quot;The Butt&quot; (&quot;Shooting a Cherry&quot;) (1848). In the latter are five, including a &quot;Snow Scene&quot;. In the National Gallery, Dublin, are &quot;Young Brother&quot; and &quot;The Toy Seller&quot;. His &quot;Wolf and the Lamb&quot; is in Royal possession.

In 1840, Mulready designed the illustrations for the postal stationery, known as Mulready stationery were introduced by the Royal Mail at the same time as the Penny Black in May 1840. They were issued in two forms; one variant was precut to a diamond or lozenge shape and folded to form an envelope that could be held together by seal at the apex of the topmost flap; and lettersheets that were cut in rectangles, folded over and sealed or tucked in.
Stationery manufacturers, whose livelihood was threatened by the new lettersheet, produced many caricatures (or lampoons) of Mulready&#x27;s design. Only six days after their introduction, on 12 May, Rowland Hill wrote that; &quot;I fear we shall have to substitute some other stamp for that design by Mulready ... the public have shown their disregard and even distaste for beauty,&quot; and within two months a decision had been made to replace the Mulready designed stationery. Essentially Mulready&#x27;s designs were a folly.

==Death==

He died at the age of 77 in Bayswater, London and is buried in the nearby Kensal Green Cemetery where a monument to his memory was erected. The monument lies on the north side of the main path, midway between the entrance and the main chapel, and although not in the front line of graves it is easily spotted due to its unique form. The tomb was designed by Godfrey Sykes.

<text>YouGov plc is a British international Internet-based market research and data analytics firm headquartered in the UK with operations in Europe, North America, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific.

==History==

=== 2000–2010 ===
Stephan Shakespeare and future UK chancellor of the exchequer Nadhim Zahawi formed YouGov in the United Kingdom in May 2000. In 2001, they engaged BBC political analyst Peter Kellner, who became chairman and then, from 2007 to 2016, President.

In its initial years, YouGov hired a number a notable commentators to write columns on its website, including future UK prime minister Boris Johnson, and presenter John Humphrys. In April 2005, YouGov became a public company listed on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange. In the same year, the company launched BrandIndex which tracks public opinion on consumer brands using daily polls.

In 2006, YouGov began expanding outside the UK through acquisitions and acquired Dubai-based research firm Siraj for $1.2 million plus an eventual earn out of $600,000. In 2007, polling firm Polimetrix, headed by Stanford University professor Doug Rivers,
was acquired by the company. Also in 2007, they added Palo Alto, California-based US research firm Polimetrix for approximately $17 million, Scandinavian firm Zapera for $8 million and German firm Psychonomics for $20 million. In 2009 and 2010, YouGov expanded its US operations with two acquisitions; first buying Princeton, New Jersey, research firm Clear Horizons for $600,000 plus an earn out of $2.7 million, then Connecticut-based research firm Harrison Group for $6 million with a $7 million earnout.

In 2010, YouGov bought a 20% stake of sports media data company SMG Insight. In 2018, the company acquired the remaining 80% of SMG Insight&#x27;s stock. The new business was rebranded YouGov Sport.
Ahead of the 2010 UK General Election, YouGov entered an exclusive contract to provide political polls to &quot;The Times&quot;. The business also launched TellYouGov, which combined analysis drawing from social media data and polling results. The business continues to analyse social media, now primarily via YouGov Signal.

=== 2011–2020 ===
In 2011, YouGov acquired Portland, Oregon-based firm Definitive Insights for $1 million with a potential $2 million earn out and also made its first organic expansion by opening an office in Paris. In January 2014, YouGov entered the Asia Pacific region with the acquisition of Decision Fuel for an estimated consideration of approximately £5 million. Also in 2014, YouGov launched Profiles, an audience segmentation tool, combining data points from its most active panellists showing how the public engages with traditional and new media channels.

In 2016, Peter Kellner stepped down as the company’s Chairman. In this year, YouGov began to use a methodology known as multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) in its political polling. Its first public use was during the United Kingdom’s referendum on EU membership. YouGov has used this approach around elections since.

In the 2017 UK General Election, YouGov’s projection was an outlier. While most pollsters projected large Conservative majorities, YouGov correctly predicted a hung parliament. YouGov modelling rightly projected a number of shock results, including in Kensington and Canterbury. In December 2017, YouGov purchased Galaxy Research to establish a presence in Australia. Galaxy Research was an Australian market research company that provided opinion polling for state and federal politics. Its polls were published in News Limited tabloid newspapers, including the &quot;Herald Sun&quot;, &quot;Courier-Mail&quot;, and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; (in contrast to Newspoll data, which is presented in the News Limited broadsheet newspaper &quot;The Australian&quot;). 
In 2020, YouGov launched YouGov Turkey, the result of an acquisition of Istanbul-based online research agency Wizsight. The business also polled extensively around the Coronavirus pandemic, working with Imperial College London to track how populations responded to the virus and associated policies.

=== 2021–present ===
In 2021, the company completed acquisitions of Canada-based Charlton Insights, Swiss-based LINK Marketing Services AG, and Australia-headquartered Faster Horses. Other acquisitions in 2021 included Lean App which was bought to improve YouGov’s services with financial transaction data, and Rezonence which offers users access to premium content in exchange for taking part in a survey. The business also launched YouGov Safe, giving insight into consumer online behaviour by encouraging consumers to share their data in a GDPR-friendly manner.

In July 2023, YouGov agreed to acquire the consumer panel division of German market research company GfK for €315 million. The next month, YouGov chairman Shakespeare said the company was considering either moving its listing in the UK to the US, or establishing a secondary listing in the US. &quot;I think the markets are better at supporting companies like ours there,&quot; he said in an interview with the &quot;Financial Times&quot;. The company later clarified that it was “not being considered in the near term.” In January 2024, YouGov concluded the acquisition of GfK’s consumer panel, and also acquired Chicago-based data company KnowledgeHound in a separate deal. In August 2024, YouGov acquired New Zealand-based generative AI company Yabble for £4.5 million.

==Description and governance==
Stephan Shakespeare is YouGov’s Chief Executive Officer, replacing Steve Hatch in February 2025. Shakespeare had previously been the company’s CEO between 2010 and 2023 before becoming YouGov’s Non-Executive Chair. Since Peter Kellner&#x27;s retirement from the company in 2016, its methodology has been overseen by YouGov’s chief scientist, Doug Rivers.

YouGov is a member of the British Polling Council.

==Methodology==
YouGov specialises in market research and opinion polling through online methods. The company&#x27;s methodology involves obtaining responses from an invited group of Internet users, and then weighting these responses in line with demographic information. It draws these demographically representative samples from a panel of over 24 million people worldwide.

In February 2024, FiveThirtyEight ranked YouGov as fourth out of more than 300 pollsters in its ratings, based on analysis of 624 YouGov polls.

YouGov&#x27;s polling results have been found to be notably more accurate than those of other online pollsters relying on nonprobability sampling instead of random sampling. &quot;The New York Times&quot; has attributed YouGov&#x27;s performance to its curation of its respondent panel and a sophisticated sampling process from that panel.

== Allegations of poll manipulation ==
In June 2022, former employee and then future MP Chris Curtis, who at that time worked for competitor Opinium, said that during the 2017 United Kingdom general election, a YouGov poll was suppressed by the company because it was &quot;too positive about Labour&quot;, under pressure from the Conservative co-founder of YouGov Nadhim Zahawi. YouGov denied that the poll was spiked for political reasons, instead arguing that the poll was based on a &quot;skewed sample&quot;. Former YouGov president Peter Kellner confirmed last-minute small methodology changes which transferred 2% from Labour to Conservative and increased the predicted Conservative lead from 3% to 7%.

A day later, Curtis withdrew his allegations, saying that he now accepted &quot;YouGov&#x27;s position that in fact the results were pulled because of concerns other members of the team had about the methodology&quot;, and that he had not intended to allege that Nadhim Zahawi had had any bearing on the decision, and apologised for any confusion caused by his previous statements.

<text>The Banu Hilal () was a confederation of Arab tribes from the Najd region of the central Arabian Peninsula that emigrated to the Maghreb region of North Africa in the 11th century. Masters of the vast plateaux of the Najd, they enjoyed a somewhat infamous reputation, possibly owing to their relatively late (for the Arabian tribes) conversion to Islam and accounts of their campaigns in the borderlands between Iraq and Syria. When the Fatimid Caliphate became the rulers of Egypt and the founders of Cairo in 969, they hastened to confine the unruly Bedouin in the south before sending them to Central North Africa (Libya, Tunisia and Algeria) and then to Morocco.

Historians estimate the total number of Arab nomads who migrated to the Maghreb in the 11th century to be to 500,000 to 700,000 to 1,000,000. Historian Mármol Carvajal estimated that more than a million Hilalians migrated to the Maghreb between 1051 and 1110, and estimated that the Hilalian population in the Maghreb at his time in 1573 was at 4,000,000 individuals, excluding other Arab tribes and other Arabs already present.

== Origin ==

The Banu Hilal originated in Najd in the central Arabian Peninsula, sometimes travelling towards Iraq in search of pastures and oases. According to Arab genealogists, the Banu Hilal were a sub-tribe of the Mudar tribal confederation, specifically of the Amir ibn Sa&#x27;sa&#x27;a, and their progenitor was Hilal. According to traditional Arab sources, their full genealogy was the following: Hilāl ibn &quot;ʿ&quot;Āmir ibn Ṣaʿṣaʿa ibn Muʿāwiya ibn Bakr ibn Hawāzin ibn Manṣūr ibn ʿIkrima ibn K̲h̲aṣafa ibn Qays ibn ʿAylān ibn Muḍar ibn Nizār ibn Ma&#x27;ad ibn ʿAdnān. The Banu Hilal were very numerous, effectively a nation divided into its own sub-tribes, of which the most notable were the Athbaj, Riyah, Jusham, Zughba, Adi, and Qurra.

Ibn Khaldun described their genealogy, which consisted of two mother tribes: themselves and the Banu Sulaym. In Arabia, they lived on the Ghazwan near Ta&#x27;if while the Banu Sulaym attended nearby Medina, sharing a common cousin in the Al Yas branch of the Quraysh. At the time of their migration, Banu Hilal comprised six sub-tribes: Athbadj, Riyah, Jusham, Adi, Zughba, and Rabi&#x27;a.

== History ==
=== Pre-Islamic Arabia ===
Its original habitat, like that of its related tribes, was the Najd, and its history during pre-Islamic times is bound with other tribes of Banu&quot;ʿ&quot;Āmir ibn Ṣaʿṣaʿa, especially in Ayyām al-ʿArab and in affairs related to the rise of Islam in the region, such as that of Biʾr Māʿūna. Banu Hilal likely did not accept the rule of Islam until after Muhammad&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Hunayn in 630, but like other Āmirid tribes, they also did not join in the Ridda Wars that followed Muhammad&#x27;s death in 632.

=== Migration to Egypt, Iraq and the Levant ===
The tribe does not appear to have played any significant role in the early Muslim conquests, and for the most part remained in the Nejd. Only in the early 8th century did some of the Banu Hilal (and the Banu Sulaym) move to Egypt. Many followed, so that the two groups became numerous in Egypt. During the Abbasid Caliphate, the Hilal were known for their unruliness. In the 9th century, Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym migrated from Najd to Iraq, and later to the Levant, before migrating to the Maghreb in the 11th century.

In the 970s, the Hilal and the Sulaym joined the radical sect of the Qarmatians in their attacks on the Fatimid Caliphate, which had just conquered Egypt and was pushing into Syria. As a result, after his victory over the Qarmatians in 978, the Fatimid caliph al-Aziz () forcibly relocated the two tribes to Upper Egypt. As they continued to fight among themselves and pillage the area, they were prohibited from crossing the Nile River or leaving Upper Egypt.

=== Migration to the Maghreb ===

The Banu Hilal first began migrating to the Maghreb when the Zirid dynasty of Ifriqiya proclaimed its independence from the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt. In retribution against the Zirids, the Fatimids dispatched large Bedouin Arab tribes, mainly the Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym, to defeat the Zirids and settle in the Maghreb. These tribes followed a nomadic lifestyle and were originally from the Hejaz and Najd. To persuade the Bedouin into migrating to the Maghreb, the Fatimid caliph gave each tribesman a camel and money and helped them cross from the east to the west bank of the Nile River. The severe drought in Egypt at the time also persuaded these tribes to migrate to the Maghreb, which had a better economic situation at the time. The Fatimid caliph instructed them to rule the Maghreb instead of the Zirid emir Al-Mu&#x27;izz and told them &quot;I have given you the Maghrib and the rule of al-Mu&#x27;izz ibn Balkīn as-Sanhājī the runaway slave. You will want for nothing.&quot; and told Al-Mu&#x27;izz &quot;I have sent you horses and put brave men on them so that God might accomplish a matter already enacted&quot;.

Upon arriving in Cyrenaica, the Arab nomads found the region almost empty of its inhabitants, except a few Zenata Berbers that Al-Mu&#x27;izz had already mostly destroyed. The number of Hilalians who moved westward out of Egypt has been estimated as high as 200,000 families. Cyrenaica was left to be settled by Banu Sulaym while the Hilalians marched westwards. As a result of the settlement by Arab tribes, Cyrenaica became the most Arab place in the Arab world after the interior of Arabia. According to Ibn Khaldun, the Banu Hilal were accompanied by their wives and their children when they came to the Maghreb. They settled in Ifriqiya after winning battles against Berber tribes, eventually going on to coexist with them. Abu Zayd al-Hilali led between 150,000 and 300,000 Arabs into the Maghreb, who intermarried with the indigenous peoples. The Fatimids used the tribe, which began their journey as allies and vassals, to punish the particularly difficult to control Zirids after the conquest of Egypt and the founding of Cairo. As the dynasty became increasingly independent and abandoned Shia Islam, they quickly defeated the Zirids after the battle of Haydaran and deeply weakened the neighboring Hammadid dynasty and the Zenata. The Zirids abandoned Kairouan to take refuge on the coast where they survived for a century. The Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym spread on the high plains of Constantine where they gradually obstructed the Qal&#x27;at Bani Hammad as they had done to Kairouan a few decades ago. From there, they gradually gained control over the high plains of Algiers and Oran. In the second half of the 12th century, they went to the Moulouya valley and the Atlantic coast in the western Maghreb to areas such as Doukkala.

 Their influx was a major factor in the linguistic, cultural and ethnic Arabization of the Maghreb and in the spread of nomadism in areas where agriculture had previously been dominant. They had also heavily transformed the culture of the Maghreb into Arab culture, and spread nomadism in areas where agriculture was previously dominant. It played a major role in spreading Bedouin Arabic to rural areas such as the countryside and steppes, and as far as the southern areas near the Sahara. Ibn Khaldun noted that the lands ravaged by Banu Hilal invaders had become completely arid desert.

Historians estimate the total number of Arab nomads who migrated to the Maghreb in the 11th century to be 250,000 (only the first few decades) to 700,000 to 1,000,000 when the entire population of the Maghreb at the time was 5,000,000. Historian Mármol Carvajal estimated that more than a million Hilalians migrated to the Maghreb between 1051 and 1110, and estimated that the Hilalian population at his time in 1573 at 4,000,000 individuals, excluding other Arab tribes and other Arabs already present.

The Banu Hilal later came under the rule of various subsequent dynasties, including the Almohad Caliphate, Hafsid dynasty, Zayyanid dynasty and Marinid dynasty. Finding their continued presence intolerable, the Almohad Caliphate defeated the Banu Hilal in the Battle of Setif and forced many of them to leave Ifriqiya and settle in Morocco. Upon the arrival of the Turks, the Banu Hilal rose against the Ottoman Empire near the Aurès region and south Algeria. In Morocco during the 17th century, the sultan Ismail Ibn Sharif created a guich army made up of Arab warriors from the Banu Hilal and the Banu Maqil which was one of the main parts of the Moroccan army. They were garrisoned in their own lands of water and pastures and served as troops and military garrisons to fight in wars and suppress rebellions.

== Social organization ==
Originally, the Banu Hilal embraced a nomadic lifestyle, rearing cattle and sheep. Despite several tribes living in arid and desert areas, they became experts in the field of agriculture. The Banu Hilal were conservative and patriarchal, and were tolerant Shi&#x27;ites. They were initially Isma&#x27;ili Shia, but after their conquest of the Sunni Maghreb, the vast majority of Banu Hilal progressively adopted the Maliki school of Sunni Islam, following the Malikization of the Maghreb in the twelfth century and later centuries.

== Taghribat Banu Hilal ==

The accounts and records that the folk poet Abdul Rahman al-Abnudi gathered from the bards of Upper Egypt culminated in the Taghribat Bani Hilal, an Arab epic describing the journey of the tribe from Arabia to the Maghreb. The tale is divided into three main cycles. The first two bring together unfolding events in Arabia and other countries of the east, while the third, called &quot;Taghriba&quot; (march west), recounts the migration of the Banu Hilal to North Africa. Until the early 20th century, the story of Banu Hilal was performed in a variety of forms across the Arab world from Morocco to Iraq, as folktale or local legend recounted in poetry.

<doc id="708805" wikidata="Q2157505" url="?curid=708805" title="Ashfield, New South Wales">
<text>Ashfield is a suburb in the Inner West of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Ashfield is about eight kilometres west of the Sydney central business district.

Ashfield&#x27;s population is highly multicultural with the majority of the area&#x27;s dwellings being a mixture of mainly post-war low-rise flats (apartment blocks) and Federation-era detached houses. Amongst these are a number of grand Victorian buildings that offer a hint of Ashfield&#x27;s rich cultural heritage.

==History==

===Aboriginal people===
Before the arrival of the British, the area now known as Ashfield was inhabited by the Wangal people. Wangal country was believed to be centred on modern-day Concord and stretched east to the swampland of Long Cove Creek (now known as Hawthorne Canal). The land was heavily wooded at the time with tall eucalypts covering the higher ground and a variety of swampy trees along Iron Cove Creek. The people hunted by killing native animals and fish. The arrival of the First Fleet in 1788 had a devastating effect on the local people, mainly from the introduction of smallpox, to which the indigenous people had little resistance.

===Early British settlement===
By 1790, a rough track had been built between the colony&#x27;s two settlements at Sydney Cove and Parramatta. This route later became the main artery of the expanding Greater Sydney and, as the northern boundary of what is now Ashfield, dictated early British settlement in the area. The first land grant in the area was made to Rev Richard Johnson in 1793 and all of it had been granted by 1810. By the 1820s, all the grants had been amalgamated into two large estates: &quot;Ashfield Park&quot; (the northern half between Liverpool Road and Parramatta Road) and &quot;Canterbury Estate&quot; (the area south of Liverpool Road). Ashfield Park was named by Robert Campbell, whose father was the laird of Ashfield in Scotland.

===Early Subdivision Plans===
===Population growth===
In 1838, Elizabeth Underwood, then owner of Ashfield Park, subdivided part of her land to form the village of Ashfield between Liverpool Road and Alt Street. Part of the subdivision was the building of St John&#x27;s Church in Alt Street in 1841. This is the oldest surviving building in Ashfield. By 1855, the village had about 70 houses and 200 residents. However, the opening of the Sydney-Parramatta railway line that year, with Ashfield as one of its six original stations, led to a population explosion. In 1872, there were enough residents for the area to be granted a municipal council. By 1890, the population had grown to 11,000.

During this time, Ashfield was seen as a highly desirable location compared to the city, which had become crowded and pestilent. Many grand Victorian houses were built in the latter part of the 19th century. But by the time of World War I, the suburb had fallen out of favour and the rich residents had mostly headed for the North Shore. Many of the grand homes were knocked down in the 1920s and 1930s and replaced with small art deco blocks of flats or semi-detached houses. A few remain, however, and are listed in the Landmarks section.

By the 1950s, the population of Ashfield had begun to fall, as it had in many surrounding suburbs, as people moved to newer houses on larger blocks of land on the urban fringe. The Council&#x27;s response was to start approving large blocks of flats, many of which were built during the 1960s and 1970s but which also continue to be built today. There is, however, recognition of the area&#x27;s heritage with many buildings in the suburb protected by heritage orders.

===Industrial history===

While never a noted industrial suburb, Ashfield has had a couple of significant industries. On Parramatta Road near Frederick Street was the Australian Six motor car factory which opened in 1920. The site later became an AWA factory producing radio valves and other components. The site has since been turned into a commercial and residential development. On the other side of Frederick Street was the Peek Freans biscuit factory, the tower of which was (and still is) a familiar site to passing motorists on Parramatta Road. However, this factory is also no longer industrial, serving today as a large Bunnings warehouse.

==Commercial area==
The main shopping precinct is located along Liverpool Road south of Ashfield railway station. Along this strip, there are a few medium-sized office blocks, many street-level shops and Ashfield Mall, a shopping centre containing supermarkets, a discount department store and specialty shops. This commercial area also extends into Charlotte Street and Elizabeth Street on the northern side of the station. A second commercial precinct is located along Parramatta Road consisting mostly of automotive-related retail and light industry.

==Transport==
Ashfield is located at the intersection of two major roads. Parramatta Road runs from Sydney city to Parramatta and ultimately continues on as the Great Western Highway through Penrith and the Blue Mountains. Liverpool Road runs from Parramatta Road at Ashfield to Liverpool and ultimately continues on as the Hume Highway. While completion of the Sydney Orbital Network has bypassed these two roads somewhat, they remain busy and well connected to all parts of Sydney. Another major road is Frederick/Milton Street which connects the City West Link Road at Haberfield with Georges River Road at Croydon Park.
Ashfield railway station is on the Main Suburban railway line of the Sydney Trains network. Ashfield was opened in 1855 as part of the original Sydney to Parramatta railway. It was renovated in 2002. There are express and all stations services to the City Circle, Homebush, Parramatta, Leppington and Liverpool.

Ashfield is the terminus for one Transit Systems bus services: 464 (to Mortlake, via Croydon Park, Burwood, and Concord). Another nine routes pass through Ashfield: 406 (to Five Dock and Hurlstone Park), 413 (City to Campsie), 418 (to Burwood and Sydenham station, and Tempe), 461X (City to Burwood), 490 &amp; 492 (Drummoyne to Rockdale and Hurstville), 491 (Five Dock to Hurstville) and 480 &amp; 483 (City to Strathfield).

There are virtually no dedicated bicycle paths in the suburb of Ashfield but there is a local bicycle users group which has worked with the then Ashfield Municipal Council to identify preferred routes through Ashfield for cyclists. The Strathfield-Newtown route is the most important of these, passing down Park Lane and Robert Street towards Summer Hill where it links with the Cooks River to Iron Cove Greenway Corridor providing access to those two popular local cycleways.

==Education==

Ashfield has three primary schools: Ashfield Public (on Liverpool Road), St Vincent&#x27;s (a Catholic K–12 school in Bland Street), and Yeo Park Infants (on Victoria Street at the southern extremity of the suburb). It also has two high schools: Ashfield Boys High School (next to Ashfield Public on Liverpool Road) and St Vincent&#x27;s College (a Catholic co-educational school in Bland Street formed as a result of a merger in 2023 of adjacent schools Bethlehem College and De La Salle College).

Ashfield Public is the oldest of these having been established in 1876 after much lobbying from local residents. Prior to that there had been schools operating out of the Methodist, Anglican and Presbyterian churches and there had even been a public school operating briefly out of the Methodist church between 1862 and 1866 but it wasn&#x27;t until 1876 that it became a permanent fixture. In 1907, two years of secondary school were added and the school became a Superior School but it was not until 1965 that Ashfield Boys High was formally established and separated from the primary school.

Bethlehem was the first high school in the area, established by the Sisters of Charity in 1881. It led to a Catholic primary school St Charles being established shortly after. When it burnt down in 1904, St Vincents became the replacement, taking on the name of the newly built church next door. The De La Salle school was established in 1915.

The year after Bethlehem was established, an Anglican girls boarding school called Normanhurst School was started in Bland Street. It moved to Orpington Street in 1888 and stayed there until 1941 when it closed down. It produced notable students including Pamela Travers (author of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;) and tennis champion Daphne Akhurst. There were a number of other private schools in the area during this period as well but none survived to the present day.

==Health==
There are no public hospitals in Ashfield although there are two private facilities. The Sydney Private Hospital on the corner of Victoria Street and Robert Street first opened in 1931 as the Masonic Hospital. It did at one point have an Accident and Emergency Unit, an Intensive Care Unit, and a Maternity Unit. All of these were closed down in 2000 when the hospital changed ownership. It now focuses on elective surgery. The Wesley Private Hospital in Frederick Street is a well-established mental health facility.

==Landmarks==

For visitors passing through Ashfield along Parramatta Road, Liverpool Road or the railway line, the three main landmarks that stand out are the tower of the old Peek Frean Biscuit factory (now Bunnings Warehouse) on Parramatta Road, Wests Leagues Club on Liverpool Road next to the railway line and the Ashfield water reservoir in Holden Street to the south of the town centre. The water tower was built in 1912 and provides the water supply for the surrounding areas.

===Houses===

Ashfield Council produced a number of guides for heritage walks in the area, but these guides are not being printed anymore. Some of the important heritage buildings in Ashfield, from Ashfield Council&#x27;s heritage guide, are found in the section below. The Inner West Council does not currently have any guides for the Ashfield area although they do have heritage guides for Balmain and Leichhardt.

To the south of the town centre are Plynlimmon (built 1867) in Norton St and now a child care centre; Glenore (built 1897) and Buninyong (built 1901), two adjacent properties in Tintern Road; Mountjoy (built 1870) now part of the hospital in Victoria Street; Glentworth (built 1887) also in Victoria Street and now part of a retirement village; Ashfield Castle (built 1887) in Queen Street and originally known as Ambleside; Thirning Villa, (built 1868) and now part of Pratten Park; Gallop House in Arthur Street, now part of a nursing home; and Milton in Blackwood Avenue, which was built in the 1850s and was once home to NSW Premier Sir Henry Parkes. North of the railway line are Pittwood in Charlotte Street, formerly part of a nursing home but now used by Sydney Missionary and Bible College; the impressive tower of Amesbury (built 1888) in Alt Street; nearby Taringa in Taringa Street; and Gorton in Henry Street, which was built in 1860 and since 1876 has been the Infants Home. On Lapish Avenue on the western end of town still stands a street scape of five Art Deco Sydney Bungalow styled semi-detached pairs and a block of units at each end that were designed and built during World War II as speculative housing the full history of the land has been meticulously research and documented.

A number of these properties are listed on the Register of the National Estate including Amesbury, Ashfield Castle, Buninyong, Glenore, Taringa and two unnamed Gothic houses at 177-179 Norton Street. Also listed on the Register are Ashfield Park (see Parks section), the police and fire station in Victoria Street, and the band rotunda in Yeo Park.

===Churches===

The first church in Ashfield was St. John the Baptist&#x27;s Anglican Church in Alt Street. It was part of Elizabeth Underwood&#x27;s 1838 subdivision that gave rise to the village of Ashfield and was reserved by her for the purpose of &#x27;the erection of an Episcopalian Church&#x27;. Prior to then, Anglican church services had been held in her house. Work on St Johns began in 1840 and after the project was taken over by colonial architect Edmund Blacket, it was consecrated in 1845. It is the oldest surviving building in Ashfield.

In 1842, neighbouring landowner Robert Campbell made an acre of land between Liverpool Road and Norton Street available for a Methodist chapel and schoolhouse. In 1864, a larger building was erected on the site which still exists as the Ashfield Uniting Church. It is also home of the Exodus Foundation providing 400 meals a day to the needy.

The Presbyterians did not build a local church until 1876, choosing a site on the corner of Liverpool Road and Knox Street. Prior to this they attended St David&#x27;s in Haberfield. Although they later built a larger church on the same Knox Street site, the original church is located at the southwestern corner of the property, having been moved twice from its original location.

Catholic services began in the area in 1880 with the establishment of Bethlehem College. Services quickly outgrew the school&#x27;s small chapel and in 1894, the Vincentian Fathers started building a church in Bland Street, opposite Bethlehem. Designed by Catholic Architects Sheerin and Hennessy in a grand Romanesque style, St Vincents was completed in 1907.

The Baptists held their first service in the School of Arts building on the corner of Liverpool Road and Holden Street. After building a small church further down Holden Street in 1886, they returned to the School of Arts in 1903 which then became known as the Baptist Tabernacle. In 1937, they sold the building, which was knocked down and replaced with a cinema, and moved to their current site on the corner of Holden and Norton Streets. It is Gothic in style with a landmark tower, an impressive street facade and a sympathetically designed adjoining hall.

The Seventh-day Adventists have had a church in Ashfield for over 100 years. The church was first established from a series of camp meetings held in the area in the late 1890s. The current church is located on Charlotte Street.

===Parks===
From the late 1870s, meetings were held in Ashfield in support of a new 106-acre reserve in the district for the enjoyment of locals at a time when housing subdivision was rapidly increasing. Ashfield Park on Parramatta Road is one of the largest public parklands in inner west Sydney. It features large phoenix palms, a war memorial, a children&#x27;s playground with a statue of Mary Poppins (in recognition of the author PL Travers who lived nearby between 1918–1924), a monument to International Mother Language Day built by former artist-in-residence Ian Marr and the Bangladeshi community, a statue of Philippines national hero Jose Rizal, a sporting field and one of Sydney&#x27;s oldest bowling clubs. The park, which is just over 6 hectares in area, was proclaimed in 1885 when it was claimed at the time you could &#x27;see all the way to Martin Place&#x27;.

The area&#x27;s major sporting ground is Pratten Park, home of the Western Suburbs grade cricket club in summer and used by the Canterbury District Soccer Football Association in winter. There are also tennis courts and a bowling club adjacent to the main oval. Thirning Villa, located within the park, is home to the Ashfield District Historical Society and an artist in residence sponsored by the local council.

The other sporting field in the area is at Hammond Park on Frederick Street. It predates both Ashfield Park and Pratten Park having begun life in 1877 as a private cricket ground. In 1888, it was intended to be the setting for the first descent of a parachute from a hot air balloon in Australia. Unfortunately, the parachutist (JT Williams) missed the mark and landed in Homebush, roughly 4 km away. This park was also the site of an ice skating rink in the late 1800s.

The other parks of note in the area are Yeo Park on the southern edge of the suburb and featuring a National Heritage listed band rotunda, and Explorers Park on the corner of Parramatta Road and Liverpool Road, built to commemorate the point where many early British explorers began their journeys west and south. It also features engraved images from early indigenous people in Sydney.
===Swimming pools===
The Ashfield Olympic Swimming Centre was first opened on 26 January 1963 by NSW Premier Bob Heffron on Elizabeth Street, Ashfield. It had an outdoor 50 metre pool, a diving pool and tower (also used for water polo), children&#x27;s pools and later a heated indoor 25 metre pool. The site is highly visible from trains passing on the western line immediately to the south. Due to ongoing dilapidation all pools and buildings were demolished in 2018 when the Inner West Council undertook a $44.7 million redevelopment of the site, reopening on 17 October 2020 as the Ashfield Aquatic Centre with five new pools. The outdoor 50 m pool is open all year round and heated in winter. The facility also includes a multipurpose outdoor pool with an adjustable/moveable floor (which can change its depth by 2.1 m), an outdoor children&#x27;s pool, an indoor 25-metre multipurpose pool, an indoor baby/toddlers pool, health and fitness centre, sauna, steam and spa, crèche, café and retail space.

==Governance==

The suburb of Ashfield is within the Inner West Council local government area, in the Inner West region of Sydney in the state of New South Wales, Australia.

For federal elections, Ashfield is part of the electoral division of Grayndler, currently held by Labor&#x27;s Anthony Albanese. Since 1977, it has mostly been in this division although parts have been in the neighbouring Divisions of Lowe and Watson at various times. Previously, the suburb was in the electorate of Parkes from Federation in 1901 until 1949. From then until 1977, it was in the now abolished electorate of Evans.

For state elections, Ashfield is part of the Summer Hill electorate. Before the 2015 state election, the suburb was split between the electoral divisions of Strathfield and Canterbury. Prior to 1894, Ashfield was in the state electorate of Canterbury. From 1894 until 1999, there was a state electorate of Ashfield, which was abolished when the state government decided to reduce the total number of electorates in the state.

==Culture==

===Events===

The major community event in Ashfield each year is the &quot;Carnival of Cultures&quot;, a celebration of the area&#x27;s multiculturalism. Held every year since 1996 in Ashfield Park, it includes performances, food stalls and children&#x27;s entertainment.
In recent years, the Sydney Writers&#x27; Festival has also held part of its library program in Ashfield as part of the regular &quot;Authors at Ashfield&quot; &quot;(since the 2016 merger to the Inner West Council, it has been known as &#x27;speaker series&#x27;)&quot; series of talks.

===Arts===
Ashfield Council developed a program of community arts in the suburb, which has continued into the merge into Inner West Council in 2016. This included the funding of an artist-in-residence program, who is based at Thirning Villa in Pratten Park. The current artist is the Refugee Art Project and New Moon Collective.
Part of their residency involves artist talks, community workshops and teaching/educating at local schools. In front of Thirning Villa is Ashfield&#x27;s version of the Rosetta Stone, made by former artist-in-residence Ian Marr and featuring a passage from the Iliad by Homer in twelve different community languages. Another former artist was the writer Van Badham.

===Sport===
Ashfield has a long history with the sport of rugby league. The Western Suburbs Magpies rugby league team was formed in Ashfield in 1908 and played in the inaugural New South Wales Rugby League competition that year. The club won its four premierships (1930, 1934, 1948 &amp; 1952) while based at Pratten Park. It moved west to Lidcombe Oval in 1967, then southwest to Campbelltown Stadium in 1987. In 2000, the club merged with the Balmain Tigers to form the Wests Tigers which splits its games between Leichhardt Oval and Campbelltown. The Wests Leagues Club has stayed in Ashfield since 1908 despite the wanderings of its home ground.

Ashfield also holds a cycling milestone when it hosted the first woman&#x27;s cycling race in the world in 1888. Dorothy Morrell won the two-mile (3 km) race.

Ashfield is the site of the first official Australian cricket pitch, which was established in 1875 and originally owned and leased by a local butcher. It was later sold to the Ashfield Cricket Club and then, in 1910, to Ashfield Council who renamed it &quot;Hammond Park&quot; after former mayor Mark J. Hammond.

<text>Samuel J. &quot;Sam&quot; Palmisano (born July 29, 1951) is a former president and the eighth chief executive officer of IBM until January 2012. He also was chairman of the company until October 1, 2012.

Palmisano was appointed president and chief operating officer (COO) effective in October 2000. He was promoted to CEO in March 2002, while retaining the title of president, and named chairman effective January 1, 2003. Palmisano announced on October 25, 2011, that he was stepping aside as president and CEO. He was succeeded in these positions by Ginni Rometty.

As of 2009, IBM was the largest IT company in the world and 45th largest company overall.

==Education and personal life==
Palmisano grew up in an Italian-American middle class family in Baltimore, Maryland. His father owned a body shop.

As an offensive lineman at Calvert Hall College High School in Baltimore, Maryland he prepared earnestly, studying pregame scouting reports and seldom missed a blocking assignment. He was also a union musician, and once was the opening act and played backup saxophone for The Temptations.

He holds a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history from Johns Hopkins University where he was member of Beta Theta Pi. He also played football (center, offensive tackle, team co-captain) there, and turned down an opportunity to try out with the Oakland Raiders.

He met his wife, Gaier Notman, a 1969 alumna of Miss Porter&#x27;s School, at an IBM training school.

==Career==

=== IBM 1973-2012 ===

Palmisano joined IBM in 1973 as a salesman.

From 1989-1990, he had a one-year stint as executive assistant to then-chairman and CEO John F. Akers. During that time Palmisano was seen as a rising star and he had lunch with former chairman Thomas Watson, Jr. once per month. Palmisano afterwards ran the company&#x27;s Japanese office.

He was appointed senior vice president and group executive of the Personal Systems Group in 1997. He was then promoted to senior vice president and group executive of IBM Global Services in 1998, during the period when IBM shifted its focus from pure technology to embrace outsourcing and other services. He became senior vice president and group executive of Enterprise Systems in 1999 when the systems group drove IBM&#x27;s move to adopt the Linux operating system.

Before leading IBM Global Services, Palmisano led the IBM strategic outsourcing business and before that, he was president of an IBM subsidiary—Integrated Systems Solutions Corporation—which ultimately became IBM Global Services.

Palmisano was elected president and chief operating officer (COO) effective in October 2000.

====Chief Executive Officer====
Palmisano was promoted to CEO in March 2002 and named chairman effective January 1, 2003, succeeding the retiring Louis V. Gerstner, Jr. after the Dot-com bubble bust. While his predecessor had saved the company from bankruptcy by downsizing the workforce and cutting costs and then leading IBM&#x27;s resurgence with systems integration and services consulting (such as e-commerce), Palmisano&#x27;s goal was to reestablish IBM as a standard-setting company. He was influenced by the Watsons, the company founders who &quot;always defined I.B.M. as a company that did more than sell computers; they believed that it had an important role to play in solving societal challenges&quot;. 

Palmisano&#x27;s mandate was to move into new businesses with high-profit margins and potential for innovation. This included purchasing PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting in 2002 so that IBM could go beyond selling computers and software and help customers use technology to solve business challenges (marketing, procurement, and manufacturing). During his tenure, the company also acquired 25 software companies that specialized in data mining and analytics so that IBM could help companies and governments to find patterns in web and internal data. Palmisano also prepared the company for cloud computing, originally known inside IBM as on-demand computing, where the center of innovation would be services and software, delivered over the Internet from data centers and connecting to PCs and other devices. 

In 2008, despite the financial crisis and economic recession , he launched I.B.M.’s Smarter Planet initiative which applies computer intelligence to create more efficient systems for numerous applications including utility grids and traffic management. Although the services and consulting businesses, which then-CEO Gerstner had championed, provided most of IBM&#x27;s revenue, software analytics had higher margins, contributed more profits and had more growth.

Palmisano also led the sale of the PC group to Lenovo which closed in 2005. The move was controversial inside IBM, as it had invented the personal computer in the 1980s, and the PC was one of the company&#x27;s few products widely used by the masses and created strong brand recognition for IBM. Although it fell behind rivals during the 1990s, that division helped drive sales of other I.B.M. products in corporate accounts, and its purchasing power helped lower the cost of components for larger IBM offerings like mainframes and servers.

As IBM&#x27;s PC group was profitable and generated around US$20 billion in yearly revenue, the divestiture resulted in IBM ceding the title of the world&#x27;s largest information technology firm (by revenue) to Hewlett-Packard, the latter whose revenue had increased due to the acquisition of Compaq in 2002. However to Palmisano, moving to new high-margin businesses meant exiting low-margin businesses like PC manufacturing, plus PC manufacturing was becoming commoditized and offered few opportunities for innovation. It took five years but Palmisano was vindicated . Also recognizing that drives were becoming a commodity, he sold off IBM&#x27;s disk drive business to Hitachi and then signed a five-year deal to buy Hitachi drives.

As CEO of IBM, Palmisano shifted many development and support positions to emerging markets.

He was elected to the board of ExxonMobil in 2006. In 2021, he was voted off the board after an ESG - based shareholder revolt led by activist hedge fund Engine 1. He is also the Honorary Chairman of National Engineers Week 2008.

In November 2008, Palmisano, during a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations, outlined IBM&#x27;s Smarter Planet initiative.

While CEO of IBM in 2009, Palmisano earned a total compensation of $21,159,289, which included a base salary of $1,800,000, a cash bonus of $4,750,000, stocks granted of $13,517,401, no options, and other compensation of $1,091,888.

In 2010 Palmisano was awarded The Deming Cup, an excellence award presented by the W. Edwards Deming Center for Quality, Productivity, and Competitiveness at Columbia Business School, for his ability to drive IBM to new levels of operational excellence and for his role in creating and leading IBM&#x27;s Global Services business unit.

Palmisano announced on October 25, 2011, that he was stepping aside as president and CEO, being succeeded by Ginni Rometty effective on January 1, 2012. Palmisano continued as chairman until October 1, 2012.

=== After IBM ===
Samuel J. Palmisano is the chairman of the Center for Global Enterprise, a private, nonprofit, nonpartisan research institution devoted to the study of contemporary corporation, the management science in a globally interconnected world. The CGE was established in 2013 to help educate societal stakeholders – as well as leaders from the private sector, public sector, and academia – on the globally integrated economy and its promise for a better future.

In May 2013, Bloomberg LP appointed Palmisano as an independent advisor for the company&#x27;s privacy and data standards.

In February 2016, President Barack Obama appointed Palmisano as the vice chairman of a new White House cybersecurity commission tasked with helping the country better defend itself against and withstand cyber attacks, the Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity.

<text>The Brig o&#x27; Balgownie is a 13th-century bridge spanning the River Don in Old Aberdeen, Scotland.

Construction of the bridge was begun in the late 13th century by Richard Cementarius, although its completion was not until 1320 at the time of the Scottish War of Independence. After falling into disrepair in the mid 16th century it was extensively renovated from 1607 to 1611.

Throughout its history the bridge has been considered an important asset. For five centuries possession of the bridge was the only way to move large armies quickly along the eastern coast of Aberdeenshire. It also provided a trade route to the wealthy areas of the north-east of Scotland.

The bridge is constructed of granite and sandstone. Its single gothic arch has span of over and at low tide the apex of the arch lies over above the water-line.

The bridge ceased to be a major route in 1830 when the new Bridge of Don was built downstream.

==History==
The text below is taken from the notes of a public talk &quot;History of the Brig o&#x27;Balgownie&quot; given by Dr. Christopher P. Croly from the Archaeological Unit at Aberdeen City Council.

===Origin of the bridge&#x27;s name===
The name &quot;Balgownie&quot; comes from the surrounding area, Balgownie, which from an early time was a barony. The name itself has a Gaelic origin, but is a source of some debate. Some authorities believe that the first part of the name derives from &quot;Baile&quot; and means &quot;town&quot;. However the very earliest references to the barony, or settlement, of Balgownie invariably have the word as Palgoueny, or Polgowny, or a number of minor variants, generally starting with &quot;Pol&quot;. &quot;Pol&quot; relates to a pool, probably the one known as the &quot;black neuk&quot;. However it may be that P and B are interchangeable and the distinction may not affect the meaning. There are two possible suggestions for the second part, some say that &quot;gabhainn&quot;, genitive of &quot;gabhann&quot;, means a &quot;of a cattle-fold&quot; whilst others have asserted that it derives from &quot;gobhainn&quot; which indicates a blacksmith, or just a smith.

The first recorded instance of the name of Polgowny dates from 1256, but it is in all likelihood older.

===Who built the bridge===
The familiar story is that the stone bridge was commissioned by either Bishop Henry Cheyne or Robert the Bruce, or indeed was begun by the former and completed by the latter, and that the work was done by Richard Cementarius. It is said that Cheyne started the work but fled Bruce&#x27;s troops, and then Bruce finished the work later on. However, the earliest written version of the origins of the bridge is slightly at odds with later ones. The first written history of the bridge was by Sir Alexander Hay, in a charter of 1605. In the charter he wrote that the bridge &quot;was built by command, and at the expense of, the deceased most invincible prince, Robert Bruce, king of the Kingdom of Scotland.&quot; This account only contains one element of what becomes a fairly consistent story. Parson Gordon was the first to record a fuller version of the story some sixty years after Hay. He wrote: &quot;No man can certainly tell who builded the Bridge of Done. The commone and most probable reporte is that the renouned Prince Robert Bruisse, King of Scotland, at such tyme as he banished B. Henrie Cheyne from his sea, and drave him out of Scotland beside, did command for to sequester the bishops yeerlie revenue to be imployed towards pious uses, and that this bridge (which is lyke to be true) was builted with a part of that revenue.&quot;

Thus the two earliest versions of this story both put the onus for building the bridge on Robert the Bruce, and neither mention involvement by Bishop Cheyne. This story has been repeated a number of times over the centuries often with only minor changes. In 1780 Francis Douglas wrote that it &quot;is said to have been built by Henry Cheyne, bishop of Aberdeen, about the year 1290, or by King Robert the Bruce, who perhaps completed what the bishop had begun.&quot; In the 19th century Camden wrote that &quot;it was projected by Bishop Henry Cheyne … and built at his expense&quot;. In the 20th century Alexander Keith tells all elements of the story: that it was started by Bruce or Cheyne, but certainly completed by the former. He favours the Bruce version citing Hay and Boece as his evidence. The story about the involvement of Cementarius is an entirely new one, and seems to be no older than the 20th century. It was perhaps first stated by W. Douglas Simpson.

Richard Cementarius is often cited as the first Provost of Aberdeen, or rather the first Alderman. However, that can not be correct: what would be correct would be to say that he is the first person whose name has been connected with that office in some official document, and that therefore he is the first &quot;recorded&quot; Provost of Aberdeen. However that does not seem to be true either. Certainly Richard is an historical figure: there is a contemporary reference to Richard in the Exchequer Rolls return for Aberdeen of 1264 which refers to &quot;Magistro Ri. Cementario&quot; in the context of work being carried out of Aberdeen Castle. What is important is that he is not specifically described as &quot;provost&quot;. Other documents about him all refer to him as a burgess of the Burgh, but never as provost. Moreover, he seems to have been dead by 1294. In that year Malcolm of Palogoueny and Duncan the merchant, both described as burgesses, wrote a charter in which they acted as guarantors of the estate of the late Richard, also described as burgess. He had left monies and annual rents to the altar of St John the Apostle in the Church of St Nicholas. The altar itself he seems to have founded in 1277. So from these it is probable that he was alive in 1277 but dead by 1294, therefore any involvement that he had with building the bridge would have to have been before 1294. As we do not know when the bridge was built it is unclear if he could have been involved. But it is a modern story whose only real prop is the similarity between the arch in the bridge and an arch in Drum Castle, also ascribed to Cementarius, but not proved and that certainly needs more research. However, it may simply have reflected a common building style.

===Maintenance===
Before 1605 there was no regular means for funding maintenance of the bridge, and due to a lack of substantial monies some of the work repairs were necessarily temporary in nature. By 1605 the bridge was in a state of major deterioration when Sir Alexander Hay of Whytburgh established a fund for the maintenance of the bridge and various other entities also raised money to contribute to the bulk of repairs required, resulting in its complete renovation between 1607 and 1611. The first actual use of Hay&#x27;s fund was for purchasing new cobblestones in 1616, and the fund has been maintained since by Aberdeen Council.

<doc id="708812" wikidata="Q5243000" url="?curid=708812" title="Daya Nayak">
<text>Daya Nayak is an Indian Police officer of the Mumbai Police. He joined the department in 1995, and rose to fame as an encounter specialist in the late 1990s, as a member of the Detection Unit.

== Early life ==
Daya Nayak was born in a Brahmin family at Yennehole village of the Karkala taluk, Udupi district in a Konkani-speaking family. He studied till the 7th standard in a Kannada - medium school built by his grandfather. In 1979, he came to Mumbai, after his father asked him to earn some money to help the family. He worked at a hotel canteen, sleeping on the hotel&#x27;s porch. He continued his education while working, and graduated 8 years later from the CES college in D. N. Nagar. After graduating, he started working with a plumber as a supervisor, earning a monthly salary of 3,000. He continued staying at the hotel until he got a police job. He was an encounter specialist.

== Police career ==

Daya Nayak joined the Bombay Police now known Mumbai Police as a trainee with the rank of Sub-Inspector in 1995. After completing his training, he was posted to the Juhu police station in 1996. His first encounter killing happened on the night of 31 December, where he had opened fire upon a few gangsters. Subsequently, he was shifted to the special squad working against the gangsters.

In 1997, he was hospitalised after being shot twice and badly wounded by a gangster. Nayak himself disapproved of the sobriquet &quot;encounter specialist&quot;, insisting that he is not a trigger-happy man but was forced to kill gangsters to prevent more &quot;bloodshed and mayhem&quot;.

== School in Yennehole ==

Daya Nayak built a school in his native village Yennehole. The money for building the school was collected through donations from Bollywood personalities in name of the Radha Nayak Educational Trust(named after Nayak&#x27;s mother). The school was inaugurated by Amitabh Bachchan in 2000 in presence of celebrities like M. F. Husain, Suniel Shetty and Aftab Shivdasani. It was later handed over to the Government of Karnataka, and is now known as the Radha Nayak Government High School.

== Controversies ==

In 2003, Ketan Tirodkar, a journalist, accused Daya Nayak of having links with the Mumbai underworld, and of amassing wealth disproportionate to his income through illegal means. Tirodkar alleged that he had become friends with Nayak in 2002, and ran an extortion business with him.

Nayak was investigated by the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) court for links with the underworld. He came out clean in investigations conducted by ACP Shankar Kamble in 2003 and by DCP K L Bishnoy in 2004. He was given clean chit after another inquiry by ACP Dilip Sawant in 2004. The same year, Tirodkar was taken into custody on the charge of having links with the Dubai-based don Chota Shakeel.

In 2006, Nayak was arrested during an investigation led by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) ACP Bhim Rao Ghadge. The ACB officials raided his house on 21 January 2006. The school built by him was also raided without the knowledge of approval of the Karnataka state government. On 18 February 2006, a sessions court issued a non-bailable warrant against him in the disproportionate assets case after his anticipatory bail plea was rejected by the sessions court, the Bombay High Court and after the Supreme Court of India declined to interfere in the case and directed him to surrender.

The 2003 complaint against him stated that he had amassed wealth worth crores of rupees. ACB found his assets to be worth much less – Rs. 8,917,000, but still filed a chargesheet against him, stating that these assets were disproportionate to Nayak&#x27;s monthly salary of 10,000 as a sub-inspector. Nayak was accused of floating bogus companies with help of his associate Rajendra Phadte, and getting his wife Komal to take property loans.

The ACB summoned Them 27 times, but could not find any evidence. ACB arrested him at the insistence of the IPS officer Pradnya Saravade. He was jailed for 26 days, during which both his parents died. He appealed to the Maharashtra State Human Rights Commission (MSHRC).

Nayak insisted that all his money was accounted for, and every transaction was made by cheque. He also pointed out that his assets had been shown as inflated. For example, his Tata Sumo was a government vehicle and the 200,000 rupee expense reimbursed by the government for a post-encounter hospital stay had been counted as an asset. The ACB alleged that Nayak had transferred 1 billion to a foreign contact from a cyber café in Goa. It claimed that he was in Goa on 18 January 2006, but his duty records proved that he was at the Charkop Police station. ACB also brought up the point that a person called D Naik had travelled several times between Mumbai and Goa by air. It was later found out that the person was the Goa minister Damodar Naik.

According to Nayak&#x27;s supporters, he was framed by some of his colleagues who had close ties with the underworld criminals, whom Nayak had fought with. Nayak himself termed Ghadge as the &quot;most corrupt officer&quot;, and alleged that Ghadge had filed an FIR against him after he refused his demand for a bribe of 10 million.

In 2008, after the Soharbuddin Sheikh encounter case came to light, Tirodkar filed one more affidavit stating that Daya Nayak was involved in the death of Sadiq Jamal, another alleged fake encounter by the Gujarat Police. According to Tirodkar, the Gujarat police had asked Daya Nayak and him to supply &quot;a Muslim boy with some criminal background&quot; to the Gujarat Police, and in response, Nayak handed over Sadiq Jamal to them.

In 2010, the Court quashed all the MCOCA charges against him.

== After reinstatement ==

On 16 June 2012, the Maharashtra Police reinstated Nayak. He was posted in the Local Arms unit. He was then posted to the Western Zone, and worked out of Bandra. In January 2014, he was transferred to Nagpur. However, he did not report there, and was suspended in July 2015. The transfer order was cancelled in August 2015, and Nayak was reinstated in Mumbai Police on 11 January 2016. 

Nayak was promoted as a Sr. Inspector in January 2024.

== In popular culture ==

The Hindi films &quot;Ab Tak Chhappan&quot; by Shimit Amin and N Chandra&#x27;s &quot;Kagaar&quot; are based on Nayak&#x27;s personal experiences, as is the Kannada film &quot;Encounter Daya Nayak&quot;. &quot;Ab Tak Chhappan&quot; was later remade into Telugu as &quot;Siddham&quot;. The 2007 film &quot;Risk&quot; by Vishram Sawant has overtones from Daya Nayak&#x27;s life. - A Telugu film, titled &quot;Golimaar&quot; released in 2010 is also inspired by his life. The 2012 Bollywood film &quot;Department&quot; highlights the encounter specialists of the Mumbai Police; Daya Nayak&#x27;s role is played by Sanjay Dutt. A sequel to &quot;Ab Tak Chhappan&quot; was released in February 2015 titled &quot;Ab Tak Chhappan 2.&quot;

Another Telugu film titled &quot;Temper&quot;, was released in 2015 and the protagonist&#x27;s name was also titled after him.

<text>Gordon Hill Jenkins (May 12, 1910 – May 1, 1984) was an American arranger, composer, and pianist who was influential in popular music in the 1940s and 1950s. Jenkins worked with The Andrews Sisters, Johnny Cash, The Weavers, Frank Sinatra, Louis Armstrong, Judy Garland, Nat King Cole, Billie Holiday, Harry Nilsson, Peggy Lee and Ella Fitzgerald.

==Biography==
===Career===
Gordon Jenkins was born in Webster Groves, Missouri. He began his career writing arrangements for a radio Station in St. Louis. He was hired by Isham Jones, the director of a dance band known for its ensemble playing, which gave Jenkins the opportunity to develop his skills in melodic scoring. He also conducted &quot;The Show Is On&quot; on Broadway.

After the Jones band broke up in 1936, Jenkins worked as a freelance arranger and songwriter, contributing to sessions by Isham Jones, Paul Whiteman, Benny Goodman, Andre Kostelanetz, Lennie Hayton, and others. In 1938, Jenkins moved to Hollywood and worked for Paramount Pictures and NBC, and then became Dick Haymes&#x27; arranger for four years. In 1944, Jenkins had a hit song with &quot;San Fernando Valley&quot;. In the 1940s, he was music director for the radio version of the program &quot;Mayor of the Town&quot;, and his orchestra provided the music for Ransom Sherman&#x27;s program on CBS.

In 1945, Jenkins joined Decca Records. In 1947, he had his first million-seller with &quot;Maybe You&#x27;ll Be There&quot; featuring vocalist Charles LaVere and, in 1949, had a hit with Victor Young&#x27;s film theme &quot;My Foolish Heart&quot;, which was also a success for Billy Eckstine. At the same time, he regularly arranged for and conducted the orchestra for various Decca artists, including Dick Haymes (&quot;Little White Lies&quot;, 1947), Ella Fitzgerald (&quot;Happy Talk&quot;, 1949, &quot;Black Coffee&quot;, 1949, &quot;Baby&quot;, 1954), Billie Holiday (&quot;Crazy He Calls Me&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re My Thrill&quot;, &quot;Please Tell Me Now&quot;, &quot;Somebody&#x27;s on My Mind&quot;, 1949, and conducted and produced her last Decca session with &quot;God Bless the Child&quot;, &quot;This Is Heaven to Me&quot;, 1950), Patty Andrews of the Andrews Sisters (&quot;I Can Dream, Can&#x27;t I&quot;, 1949) and Louis Armstrong (&quot;Blueberry Hill&quot;, 1949 and &quot;When It&#x27;s Sleepy Time Down South&quot;, 1951).

Jenkins wrote the score for the Broadway revue, &quot;Along Fifth Avenue, starring Nancy Walker and Jackie Gleason, which ran for 180 performances in 1949.

The liner notes to Verve Records&#x27; 2001 reissue of one of Jenkins&#x27; albums with Armstrong, &quot;Satchmo In Style&quot;, quote Decca&#x27;s A&amp; RDirector Milt Gabler, saying that Jenkins &quot;stood up on his little podium so that all the performers could see him conduct. But before he gave a downbeat, Gordon made a speech about how much he loved Louis and how this was the greatest moment in his life. And then he cried.&quot;

During this time, Jenkins also began recording and performing under his own name. One of his enduring works while at Decca was a pair of Broadway-style musical vignettes, &quot;Manhattan Tower&quot; and &quot;California&quot; which saw release several times (78s, 45s, and LP) in the 1940s and 1950s. The two were paired on a very early Decca LP in 1949, and Jenkins was given the Key to New York City by its mayor when Jenkins&#x27;s orchestra performed the 16-minute suite on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in the early 1950s. &quot;Manhattan Tower&quot; was also a Patti Page LP album, issued by Mercury Records as catalog number MG-20226 in 1956. It is her version of Gordon Jenkins&#x27; popular 1948/1956 &quot;Manhattan Tower&quot; suite and the album charted at No. 18 on the Billboard charts. The album was reissued, combined with the 1956 Patti Page album &quot;You Go to My Head&quot;, in compact disc format, by Sepia Records on September 4, 2007. Jenkins also made a rare excursion into film work in 1952 when he scored the action film &quot;Bwana Devil&quot;, the first 3-D movie shot in color.

His &quot;Seven Dreams&quot; released in 1953 included &quot;Crescent City Blues&quot;, which was the source for Johnny Cash&#x27;s popular recording, &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot;. In 1956, he expanded &quot;Manhattan Tower&quot; to almost three times its length, released it (this time on Capitol Records), and performed it on an hour-long television show. (Both versions of &quot;Manhattan Tower&quot; are currently available on CD.) His final long-form work was &quot;The Future&quot;, which made up the entire third disk of Frank Sinatra&#x27;s 1980 Grammy-nominated &quot;&quot; album. Although the piece was savaged by critics, Sinatra reportedly loved the semi-biographical work and felt that Jenkins was treated unfairly by the media.

Jenkins headlined New York&#x27;s Capitol Theater between 1949 and 1951 and the Paramount Theater in 1952. He appeared in Las Vegas in 1953 and many times thereafter. He worked for NBC as a TV producer from 1955 to 1957, and performed at the Hollywood Bowl in 1964. By 1949, Jenkins was musical director at Decca, and he signed – despite resistance from Decca&#x27;s management – the Weavers, a Greenwich Village folk ensemble that included Pete Seeger among its members. The combination of the Weavers&#x27; folk music with Jenkins&#x27; orchestral arrangements became popular. Their most notable collaboration was a version of Lead Belly&#x27;s &quot;Goodnight Irene&quot; (1950) backed by Jenkins&#x27; adaptation of the Israeli folk song, &quot;Tzena, Tzena, Tzena&quot;. Other notable songs they recorded together are &quot;The Roving Kind&quot;, &quot;On Top of Old Smoky&quot; (1951), and &quot;Wimoweh&quot; (1952).

Also while at Decca Records Jenkins arranged and conducted several songs for Peggy Lee including her 1952 major hit recording of Rodgers and Hart&#x27;s &quot;Lover&quot;, which she also performed in the Warner Bros. remake of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; (1952 film). Lee also had chart successes with the Jenkins-arranged &quot;Be Anything (But Be Mine)&quot; and &quot;Just One of Those Things&quot;.

After a brief stint with RCA&#x27;s &quot;X&quot; Records which produced the album &quot;Gordon Jenkins&#x27; Almanac&quot; in 1956, Jenkins was hired by Capitol, where he worked with Frank Sinatra, notably on the albums &quot;Where Are You?&quot; (1957) and &quot;No One Cares&quot; (1959), and Nat King Cole, with whom he had his greatest successes; Jenkins was responsible for the lush arrangements on the 1957 album &quot;Love Is the Thing&quot; (Capitol&#x27;s first stereo release, which included &quot;When I Fall in Love&quot;, and &quot;Star Dust&quot; two of Cole&#x27;s best-known recordings), as well as the albums &quot;The Very Thought of You&quot; (1958) and &quot;Where Did Everyone Go?&quot; (1963). Jenkins also wrote the music and lyrics for Judy Garland&#x27;s 1959 album &quot;The Letter&quot; which also featured vocalist Charles LaVere, and conducted several of Garland&#x27;s London concerts in the early 1960s.

Whilst most of Jenkins&#x27; arrangements at Capitol were in his distinctive string-laden style, he continued to demonstrate more versatility when required, particularly on albums such as &quot;A Jolly Christmas From Frank Sinatra&quot; (1957), which opens with a swinging version of &quot;Jingle Bells&quot;, and Nat King Cole&#x27;s album of spirituals, &quot;Every Time I Feel The Spirit&quot; (1960), which includes several tracks with a pronounced formula_1 beat that might almost be described as rock. He also produced a diverse set of charts for his critically acclaimed 1960 album &quot;Gordon Jenkins Presents Marshal Royal&quot;, a jazz-pop crossover project with Count Basie&#x27;s alto saxophonist which included both strings and a swinging rhythm section.

However, as rock and roll gained ascendancy in the 1960s, Jenkins&#x27; lush string arrangements fell out of favor and he worked only sporadically. However, Sinatra, who had left Capitol to start his own label, Reprise Records, continued to call upon the arranger&#x27;s services at various intervals over the next two decades, on albums such as &quot;All Alone&quot; (1962), &quot;September of My Years&quot; (1965), for which Jenkins won a Grammy Award, &quot;Ol&#x27; Blue Eyes Is Back&quot; (1973), and &quot;She Shot Me Down&quot; (1981). Jenkins also worked with Harry Nilsson, arranging and conducting &quot;A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night&quot; (1973), an album of jazz standards. The Nilsson sessions, with Jenkins conducting, were recorded on video and later broadcast as a television special by the BBC.

Although best known as an arranger, Jenkins also wrote several well-known songs, including &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot;, &quot;Goodbye&quot; (Benny Goodman&#x27;s sign-off tune), &quot;Blue Prelude&quot; (with Joe Bishop), &quot;This Is All I Ask&quot;, and &quot;When a Woman Loves a Man&quot;. Jenkins also composed both the &quot;Future&quot; suite and the entire &quot;Future&quot; section of Sinatra&#x27;s 1980 concept album &quot;&quot;, and scored the music for the 1980 film &quot;The First Deadly Sin&quot;, which starred Sinatra in his last major film role.

===Personal life===
Jenkins married high school sweetheart Nancy Harkey in 1931 and had three children: Gordon Jr., Susan, and Page. In 1946, he divorced Harkey and married Beverly Mahr, one of the singers in his band. They had a son, Bruce. Jenkins also recorded an album with Beverly Jenkins for Impulse! in 1964, entitled &quot;Gordon Jenkins Presents My Wife The Blues Singer&quot;.

Toward the end of his life, he was in a near-fatal automobile accident, which left him debilitated. Nonetheless, he conducted a full orchestra for a recording session in spite of his pain.

Jenkins died of Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease in Malibu, California, eleven days shy of his 74th birthday.

His son, sports writer Bruce Jenkins, wrote a biography on his late father in 2005, titled &#x27;Goodbye: In search of Gordon Jenkins&#x27; including a rare interview with Frank Sinatra among others for insights into Jenkins&#x27; process.

Jenkins&#x27; granddaughter, singer/songwriter Ella Dawn Jenkins, is a career musician in San Francisco.

<text>Jake McGoldrick is an English teacher and former member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors representing District 1, which includes the Richmond District neighborhood McGoldrick was elected in 2000 as part of the progressive majority of candidates that were swept into office that year.

== Early life ==
A native of Philadelphia, McGoldrick lived in San Francisco for more than thirty years, much of that time in the Richmond District.

He graduated with BA in American Studies and MA in English from San Francisco State University. He has taught ESL at University of San Francisco since 1990.

== Career ==
McGoldrick was also a representative for San Francisco County in the Bay Area Air Quality Management District Board of Directors.

McGoldrick was sworn in as the District 1 Supervisor on January 8, 2001. He was re-elected to a second term in November 2004.

In 2007, local businessman David Heller, who had failed in his own run for the Board of Supervisors, announced his intention to collect signatures to recall McGoldrick. Business interests who wanted to recall McGoldrick failed to gather enough signatures to put it on the November ballot – falling about 1,000 signatures short. Proponents of this effort, which include the local Republican Party, tried and again failed to put the recall on the February 2008 ballot.

As supervisor, he was succeeded by San Francisco Board of Education Commissioner Eric Mar.

<text>James Leslie Mitchell (13 February 1901 – 7 February 1935), known by the pseudonym Lewis Grassic Gibbon (), was a Scottish writer. He was best known for &quot;A Scots Quair&quot;, a trilogy set in the north-east of Scotland in the early 20th century, of which all three parts have been serialised on BBC television.

==Personal life==
Mitchell was born into a farming family in Auchterless and raised from the age of seven in Arbuthnott, in the former county of Kincardineshire. He was educated first at the parish school and then at Mackie Academy in Stonehaven. Mitchell started working as a journalist for the &quot;Aberdeen Journal&quot; in 1917 and later for the &quot;Farmers Weekly&quot; after moving to Glasgow. During that time he was active with the British Socialist Party.

In 1919, Mitchell joined the Royal Army Service Corps and served in Iran, India and Egypt before enlisting in the Royal Air Force in 1923. In the RAF he worked as a clerk and spent some time in the Middle East.

When he married Rebecca Middleton (known as Ray) in 1925, they settled in Welwyn Garden City. He began writing full time in 1929, producing numerous books and shorter works under his real name and his pseudonym. He suffered an early death in 1935 from peritonitis, brought on by a perforated ulcer.

Mitchell&#x27;s body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 11 February 1935. Literary figures who attented the ceremony included Edwin Muir, James Barke, Donald Carswell, John Malcolm Bulloch and the Scots language poet Jean Baxter. When his ashes were interred at the cemetery in Arbuthnott on 23rd February, the Scottish literary community was represented by Nan Shepherd, Helen Cruickshank and Eric Linklater.

==Fiction==
Mitchell gained attention from his earliest attempts at fiction, notably from H. G. Wells, but it was his trilogy entitled &quot;A Scots Quair&quot;, and in particular its first book &quot;Sunset Song&quot;, with which he made his mark. &quot;A Scots Quair&quot;, with its combination of stream-of-consciousness, lyrical use of dialect, and social realism, is considered to be among the defining works of the 20th century Scottish Renaissance. It tells the story of Chris Guthrie, a young woman growing up in the north-east of Scotland in the early 20th century. All three parts of the trilogy have been turned into serials by BBC Scotland, written by Bill Craig, with Vivien Heilbron as Chris. Additionally, Sunset Song has been adapted into a film, released in 2015. &quot;Spartacus&quot;, a novel set in the famous slave revolt, is his best-known full-length work outside this trilogy.

In 1932 he used the pseudonym Lewis Grassic Gibbon for the first time when &#x27;Sunset Song&#x27; was published in August of that year. The name, Lewis Grassic Gibbon, is a variation of his maternal grandmother&#x27;s name Lilias Grassick Gibbon. 

In 1934 Mitchell collaborated with Hugh MacDiarmid on &quot;Scottish Scene&quot;, which included three of Gibbon&#x27;s short stories. His stories were collected posthumously in &quot;A Scots Hairst&quot; (1969). Possibly his best-known is &quot;Smeddum&quot;, a Scots word which could be best translated as the colloquial term &quot;guts&quot;. Like &quot;A Scots Quair&quot;, it is set in north-east Scotland with strong female characters. In 1976 the BBC produced a &quot;Play for Today&quot;, &quot;Clay, Smeddum and Greenden&quot;, a dramatisation of three of his short stories by Bill Craig. Also notable is his essay &quot;The Land&quot;.

==Remembrance==
The Grassic Gibbon Centre, attached to the local village hall, was established in Arbuthnott in 1991 to commemorate the author&#x27;s life. Within it is a small museum about his life and work, as well as a café. There is a memorial to him and his wife, and other members of the Mitchell family, in the western corner of the village churchyard (parish church of Saint Ternan) of Arbuthnott Church, nowadays in Aberdeenshire.

In 2016 &quot;Sunset Song&quot; was voted Scotland&#x27;s favourite novel in the BBC Love to Read campaign. A feature article on the novel has been written by Nicola Sturgeon, who edited a recent edition.

<text>George Washington Wilson (7 February 1823 – 9 March 1893) was a pioneering Scottish photographer. In 1849, he began a career as a portrait miniaturist, switching to portrait photography in 1852. He received a contract to photograph the Royal Family, working for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. He pioneered various techniques for outdoor photography and the mass production of photographic prints as he gradually began to largely do landscape photography in the 1860s. By 1864 he claimed to have sold over half a million copies.

==Biography==

Wilson was born in Alvah, Banffshire. After studying art in Edinburgh and London, Wilson returned to his native city of Aberdeen in 1849 and established a business as a portrait miniaturist catering to the wealthy families of the North East of Scotland. After some years of mediocre success, Wilson ventured into portrait photography in 1852, setting up a portrait studio with John Hay in 25 Crown Street in Aberdeen. From there, aided by his well-developed technical and commercial acumen and a contract to photograph the Royal Family while documenting the building of Balmoral Castle in 1854–1855, he established himself as one of Scotland&#x27;s premier photographers working for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in 1860.

Pioneering the development of techniques for photography outside of the studio and the mass production of photographic prints, he moved increasingly from portraiture to landscape photography in the 1860s. He also produced stereoscopic pictures whose main characteristic was that exposures were very short. By 1864 he claimed to have sold over half a million prints.

At the time of his death in 1893 (he had handed over the business to his sons, Charles, Louis and John Hay Wilson in 1888) the firm employed 40 staff and was one of the largest publishers of photographic prints in the world, competing with James Valentine, who was also a prolific photographer, with a large company in Dundee. The business survived until 1908, when it was wound up at auction.

He died on 9 March 1893 and is buried in Nellfield Cemetery in Aberdeen.

==Collection==

Over 40,000 of Wilson&#x27;s photographic glass plates survive, largely due to the meticulous washing and chemical treatments he insisted on. Aberdeen University is in possession of some 38,000 of these, which were donated by an Aberdeen photographer, the late Archie Strachan, in 1958. They date from the late 1850s down to the early years of the 20th century and cover not only Aberdeen and the North East of Scotland but the whole of Scotland and most of England, as well as parts of Wales and Northern Ireland, Gibraltar, Morocco including Tangier, the South of Spain, and (especially) colonial South Africa and Australia.

From about 1870 onwards Wilson relied increasingly on others to add to his stock. Thus all of the Mediterranean Sea views and many of the English and Scottish series are the work of staff photographers, or were commissioned by the company from photographic firms elsewhere in the UK; and the Australian and South African images were added to the firm&#x27;s stock in the 1890s by Charles Wilson (George&#x27;s son) and staff photographers such as Fred Hardie.

<text>Frank James Lampard (born 20 June 1978) is an English professional football manager and former player who is the manager of club Coventry City. Widely regarded as one of Chelsea&#x27;s greatest players ever and one of the greatest midfielders of his generation, Lampard has the record of the most goals by a midfielder in the Premier League and most goals from outside the box (41). He ranked highly on a number of statistics for Premier League players for the ten years from 1 December 2000, including most games and most wins.

A box-to-box midfielder, Lampard began his career in 1995 at West Ham United, the club where his father Frank Sr. also played. In 2001, he was signed by London rivals Chelsea for £11 million. In his thirteen years with the club, Lampard established himself as a prolific scorer from midfield, becoming the club&#x27;s all-time leading goalscorer, with 211 goals in all competitions. At Chelsea, Lampard won three Premier League titles, the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, four FA Cups, and two League Cups. In 2005, he was named FWA Footballer of the Year, and finished runner-up for both the Ballon d&#x27;Or and FIFA World Player of the Year. After leaving Chelsea, Lampard played for league rivals Manchester City and Major League Soccer club New York City FC before retiring in 2017. Lampard played 106 matches and scored 29 goals for the England national team, after making his debut in 1999. He represented his country at three FIFA World Cups – in 2006, 2010 and 2014 – and in UEFA Euro 2004, where he was named in the Team of the Tournament. Lampard was voted England Player of the Year in 2004 and 2005.

Lampard is one of 11 players, and the only midfielder, to have scored 150 or more goals in the Premier League. He is fourth in the Premier League&#x27;s all-time assists ranking, with 102 assists. Lampard holds a number of additional Chelsea and Premier League records, and has won PFA Fans&#x27; Player of the Year and the FWA Tribute Award. During his career, he was named in the PFA Team of the Year three times, Premier League Player of the Month four times, Premier League Player of the Season once and finished as the Premier League&#x27;s top assist provider three times, and was named in the FIFPro World XI and a MLS All-Star. After departing, Lampard was named in the Chelsea Team of the Decade as voted for by Chelsea fans, and into the Premier League Hall of Fame.

After retiring from international football, Lampard was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2015 for services to football. Lampard served as a team captain on the ITV sport panel show &quot;Play to the Whistle&quot; from 2015 until 2017. He has also written a number of children&#x27;s books. Lampard began his managerial career with Derby County in 2018, leading the club to the final of that season&#x27;s Championship play-offs. He was appointed as Chelsea&#x27;s head coach a year later, guiding them to fourth place and the FA Cup Final in his first season, before being dismissed in 2021. Following a one-year spell with Everton, and a brief return to Chelsea, Lampard joined Coventry City as manager in 2024.

==Club career==
===West Ham United===
Lampard began his career at West Ham United, his father&#x27;s former club, joining the youth team in 1994, his schoolboy hero being West Ham striker Frank McAvennie. Lampard joined West Ham when his father was the assistant coach, entering as an apprentice in the youth team in 1994 and signing a professional contract the following year. He went on loan to Second Division club Swansea City in October 1995, debuting in his team&#x27;s victory 2–0 over Bradford City and scoring his first career goal in a match against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. Lampard played nine times for Swansea before returning to West Ham in January 1996.

====1995–97: Development====
Lampard made his debut for West Ham on 31 January 1996 against Coventry City coming on as a substitute for John Moncur. His only other game of the season was the season&#x27;s last, on 5 May 1996, a 1–1 home draw with Sheffield Wednesday when Lampard was used as a substitute for Keith Rowland.

The following season Lampard made his first start for West Ham, on 17 August 1996, in a 2–0 away defeat to Arsenal before being substituted for Robbie Slater. Lampard&#x27;s season ended on 15 March 1997 when he sustained a broken leg during an away, 0–0 draw, against Aston Villa. Carried from the pitch on a stretcher, his 31st-minute substitute was Rio Ferdinand. The game also saw his first booking as a West Ham player. Lampard claims to have been jeered from the pitch by West Ham United supporters, an action which made him consider leaving football. He had made 16 appearances in all competitions for The Hammers.

====1997–99: First-team regular====
From this season Lampard took the number 18 squad number having previously held the number 26 spot. On the first day of the 1997–98 season, West Ham opened their fixtures with an away game against Barnsley who were playing in the top tier of English football for the first time in 110 years. Lampard came on as a 76th-minute substitute for Eyal Berkovic. Barely a minute later he scored what was the winning goal in a 2–1 win for The Hammers having received the ball from Michael Hughes and flicking it past Barnsley goalkeeper David Watson. The season also saw his first hat-trick. On 19 November 1997, West Ham played Walsall in a League Cup, fourth-round game. Lampard&#x27;s three goals plus another from John Hartson were enough to beat Walsall who responded via a goal from Andy Watson. Lampard made 42 appearances for the 1997–98 season in all competitions scoring nine goals.

Lampard was an ever-present for West Ham in the 1998–99 season, helping his team to fifth place in the 1998–99 Premier League and qualification for the UEFA Intertoto Cup. This is the highest West Ham have ever come in the league.

====1999–2001: New contract and departure====
Before the start of the 1999–2000 FA Premier League season, Lampard signed an extension to his contract which would have kept him with the club until 2005. Having qualified for the Intertoto Cup, West Ham&#x27;s season started early, in July 1999. On 24 July 1999, Lampard scored his first goal in European football in a 1–1 away draw with Finnish side Jokerit. Another goal in the semi-final against Heerenveen put West Ham into the final against Metz. Despite losing the first leg 1–0 in London, West Ham won 3–1 in France on 24 August 1999 with goals from Trevor Sinclair, Paulo Wanchope and Lampard. Winning the competition saw West Ham in the 1999–2000 UEFA Cup. Lampard scored his first goal in this competition on 16 September 1999, in a 3–0 home win against Osijek, a tie which they won 6–1 on aggregate.

This season also saw West Ham beat Bradford City 5–4 at Upton Park in February 2000. The game received notoriety for Lampard&#x27;s fight over the ball with Paolo Di Canio. With West Ham 4–2 down they gained a penalty. Lampard was West Ham&#x27;s regular penalty taker. Di Canio, however, wanted to take the kick and the two tussled over the ball with Di Canio winning and scoring to make the game 4–3 to West Ham. In the 1999–2000, season he finished as the club&#x27;s third top scorer, behind Di Canio and Paulo Wanchope, with a total of 14 goals.

In the 2000–01 season, West Ham&#x27;s form suffered. They spent most of the season in the bottom half of the Premier League table. From fifth place the previous season they finished 15th. Despite this Lampard scored 9 goals in 37 games, behind only Frédéric Kanouté and Di Canio. In May 2001, his uncle Harry Redknapp left the club by mutual consent after seven years in the role. His father Frank also left the club and Lampard, under the pressure of being known as &quot;Frank Lampard&#x27;s son&quot; and the poor treatment of his father by West Ham, decided to move to another club. He left West Ham for Chelsea for £11 million in June 2001, the Hammers having previously declined a £15 million joint bid from Aston Villa for Lampard and Frédéric Kanouté.

===Chelsea===
====2001–04: Signing and first-team breakthrough====
Lampard&#x27;s Premier League debut with Chelsea came on 19 August 2001 in a 1–1 draw with Newcastle United on the opening day of the 2001–02 season, while his first red card came in a match against Tottenham Hotspur on 16 September 2001. He appeared in all of Chelsea&#x27;s league matches and scored eight goals in the 2001–02 season. He netted the match-winner in Chelsea&#x27;s 2002–03 season-opener against Charlton Athletic.

The following season, he was selected as the Premier League Player of the Month in September 2003, and the PFA Fans&#x27; Player of the Month in October. Chelsea finished second in the 2003–04 Premier League behind unbeaten Arsenal and he was named in the 2004 PFA Team of the Year as he reached double figures in league goals (10) for the first time in his career, in addition to four goals in fourteen UEFA Champions League matches, as Chelsea advanced to the semi-finals. In the semi-final against Monaco he scored, but Chelsea lost 5–3 on aggregate. At the end of the season, he came second behind Thierry Henry for the 2004 FWA Footballer of the Year award.

====2004–06: Back-to-back Premier League wins====
Lampard played in all 38 Premier League matches for the third consecutive season in 2004–05. He finished with 13 goals (19 in all competitions), in addition to leading the league in assists with 18.

In August 2004, he scored the winning goal against Southampton in the Premier League, and continued scoring important goals as he scored both in a 2–0 win against Tottenham. In March 2005 he scored a long-range goal from 30 yards against Crystal Palace in the Premier League which Chelsea won 4–1. Lampard continued his season strongly, and his brilliant performances for Chelsea in the Premier League and Champions League further increased his reputation as one of the best midfielders in the world. In the 2004–05 Champions League, he scored one of the goals in Chelsea&#x27;s famous 4–2 win over Barcelona, helping Chelsea to progress to the quarter-finals. In the quarter-finals, he scored three goals in two legs against Bayern Munich as Chelsea won 6–5 on aggregate. His second goal in the first leg was a spectacular one; he controlled Claude Makélélé&#x27;s cross with his chest then turned and swivelled and sent the ball inside the far post with a left-foot half volley.

In April 2005, Lampard scored both goals against Bolton Wanderers in a 2–0 win which was the Premier League title-winning match for Chelsea, which also won the first major trophy of his career as Chelsea bagged their first top-flight title in 50 years, by a 12-point margin. He was named as Barclays Player of the Season for 2004–05. Though Chelsea were eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by league rivals Liverpool, they took home the Football League Cup, in which Lampard scored twice in six matches, which included the opening goal against Manchester United in the League Cup semi-final, which Chelsea won 2–1. He landed his first personal award by being named the 2005 Footballer of the Year.

Lampard netted a career-high 16 league goals in 2005–06. In September 2005 he was selected as a member of the inaugural World XI. He finished as runner-up to Ronaldinho for both the Ballon d&#x27;Or and FIFA World Player of the Year awards. His record of consecutive Premier League appearances ended at 164 (five better than previous record-holder David James) on 28 December 2005, when he sat out a match against Manchester City due to illness. Lampard scored 12 goals in his first four months of the 2005–06 season. He scored twice in three separate matches from August to November, including both in a 2–1 win over Aston Villa, making Chelsea the first team to win their first seven matches in the Premier League. He scored twice again, this time against Blackburn Rovers in a 4–2 win, which included a free-kick from 25 yards. After the match, manager José Mourinho hailed Lampard as the &quot;best player in the world&quot;. Chelsea eventually won the Premier League for the second time, in which Lampard was Chelsea&#x27;s topscorer with 16 league goals. In the Champions League group stage, he scored a free-kick against Anderlecht. Chelsea progressed to the first knock-out round to face Barcelona, with Lampard scoring a goal in the second leg, but Chelsea were eliminated 3–2 on aggregate.

====2006–11: Domestic and individual success====
Due to a back injury sustained by John Terry, Lampard spent much of the 2006–07 campaign as team captain in his absence. He enjoyed a streak of seven goals in eight games. He scored both goals in a 2–0 win over Fulham and scored his 77th goal for Chelsea from a long range strike in a 3–2 win over Everton on 17 December, overtaking Dennis Wise as Chelsea&#x27;s highest scoring midfielder. Then in the UEFA Champions League group stage he scored a goal from an extremely tight angle against Barcelona, at the Camp Nou, the match ended 2–2. Lampard finished with 21 goals in all competitions, including a career-high six FA Cup goals. He scored his first Chelsea hat-trick in the third-round tie against Macclesfield Town on 6 January 2007. He scored two goals to help Chelsea to a quarter-final draw with Tottenham Hotspur after having trailed 3–1, and he was named the FA Cup player-of-the-round for his performance. He gave the assist to Didier Drogba in the 2007 FA Cup Final which was the winning goal in extra-time, as Chelsea won it 1–0. In a post-match interview following Chelsea&#x27;s FA Cup Final victory over Manchester United, Lampard said he wanted to stay at the club &quot;forever&quot;.

Lampard&#x27;s 2007–08 season was hampered by injury. He managed to play 40 matches, 24 of them in the Premier League. This was the fewest league games he had played in a season since 1996–97. On 16 February 2008, Lampard became the eighth Chelsea player to score 100 goals for the club in a 3–1 FA Cup fifth-round win over Huddersfield Town. After the final whistle, Lampard removed his jersey and flashed a T-shirt to the Chelsea fans with &quot;100 Not Out, They Are All For You, Thanks&quot; printed across the front. On 12 March 2008, Lampard scored four goals in a 6–1 rout of Derby County. Then in the second leg of the Champions League quarter-final, he scored the winning goal against Fenerbahçe in the 87th minute as Chelsea won 3–2 on aggregate.

On 30 April, Lampard, grieving the loss of his mother a week earlier, decided to play in the second leg of Chelsea&#x27;s Champions League semi-final against Liverpool, who were eliminated on 4–3 aggregate as he took an emotional penalty in the 98th minute of extra-time, which he scored confidently. In the final against Manchester United, he scored an equalising goal in the 45th minute, as Michael Essien&#x27;s deflected shot found him as he went to the box with his trade-mark late run, and he scored with a left foot finish. The match ended 1–1 after extra-time and Chelsea eventually lost 6–5 on penalties. He was later named UEFA Club Midfielder of the Year.

On 13 August 2008, Lampard signed a new five-year contract with Chelsea worth £39.2 million, making him the highest-paid Premier League player. He started the 2008–09 season by scoring five goals in his first eleven league matches. He scored the 150th goal of his club career with a goal against Manchester City in the Premier League. In October 2008, in the Premier League he scored a chipped goal against Hull City with his left foot; he unleashed a chip from 20 yards that curled and swerved and fooled the goalkeeper as it went into the net. FIFA World Cup-winning coach Luiz Felipe Scolari said after the game, &quot;It was the best goal I have seen, my vote for World Player of the year award will go to him, only a player with his intelligence could have done that.&quot; Lampard scored his hundredth career Premier League goal in a 5–0 victory over Sunderland on 2 November. Eighteen of Lampard&#x27;s hundred goals were penalties. He was named Premier League Player of the Month for the third time in his career in October.

After a streak of matches without scoring, Lampard scored three goals in two games, the first being against West Bromwich Albion and the latter two against Fulham. On 17 January 2009, he made his 400th Chelsea appearance against Stoke City, scoring a stoppage time winner. He again scored a stoppage time winner on 28 February, this time against Wigan Athletic. Then in the fourth round of the FA Cup, he scored a free-kick from 35 yards against Ipswich Town. He scored twice against Liverpool in the second-leg quarter finals of the Champions League which ended 4–4, but Chelsea won 7–5 on aggregate. Then he provided two assists in the next game against Arsenal in FA Cup semi-finals which Chelsea won 2–1. Lampard finished the season with 20 goals and 19 assists. Lampard&#x27;s 20th goal of the season was the winning goal in the FA Cup Final against Everton, with a left-foot shot from long-range. He repeated the corner flag celebration his father had done after scoring the winning goal in the 1979–80 FA Cup semi-final second leg against Everton. It was the fourth consecutive season that he scored 20 or more goals. He was later named Chelsea&#x27;s Player of the Year for the third time.

Lampard started the 2009–10 season by scoring against Manchester United, in the 2009 Community Shield, in the 72nd minute. The match ended 2–2, and Lampard scored in its penalty shootout which they won 4–1. He scored his 133rd goal for Chelsea in a Champions League match against Atlético Madrid on 21 October 2009, which moved him up to fifth among the club&#x27;s all-time goalscorers. He had been struggling to score the number of goals he had in the past seasons, however this soon changed as he scored two goals in the 5–0 defeat of Blackburn on 24 October 2009. On 30 October, he was nominated for the FIFA World Player of the Year award for the sixth-straight year.

On 16 December, Lampard scored a crucial 79th minute winning goal against Portsmouth and on 20 December, Lampard scored a penalty against his former club West Ham in a 1–1 draw, however he had to take his spot-kick three times due to players running into the box too early, he nonetheless scored all three. In Chelsea&#x27;s 7–2 thrashing of Sunderland in January 2010, Lampard scored twice to add to his league tally. On 27 January 2010, Lampard again scored two goals, in Chelsea&#x27;s 3–0 win over Birmingham City in the Premier League. On 27 February, Lampard yet again scored twice against Manchester City but despite his contribution Chelsea went on to lose the game 4–2 at home, for the first time in 38 games.

Lampard, for the second time in his career, hit four goals in one match against Aston Villa on 27 March 2010 to bring his goal tally past 20, for the fifth-consecutive season. This also brought him his 151st Chelsea goal, and it put him as the club&#x27;s third highest scorer ever, overtaking Peter Osgood&#x27;s record of 150. Lampard scored in a 3–0 win, again over Aston Villa, in the 2010 FA Cup semi-final. Lampard reached 20 Premier League goals for the first time when he scored twice against Stoke City in Chelsea&#x27;s 7–0 win on 25 April 2010. This milestone also represented the first time he had hit 25 in all competitions in a season. On 2 May, Lampard scored against Liverpool in the second last game of the season to give Chelsea a vital three points that took them to the top of the league by a single point. He scored one and assisted two other goals in the final match of the season where Chelsea thrashed Wigan Athletic 8–0 at Stamford Bridge to win the 2009–10 Premier League title and give him a remarkable 27 goals in the season. Lampard ended his season lifting the 2010 FA Cup as Chelsea beat Portsmouth 1–0 in the final.

The 2010–11 season began brightly for Lampard, being an integral part of Chelsea&#x27;s system as usual. After a match against Stoke in August 2010, which Chelsea won 2–0, it was revealed that Lampard was suffering from a hernia, which was successfully operated on. However, he suffered fresh injuries during training in mid-November, and remained sidelined for a further three weeks. Manager Carlo Ancelotti said that he injured his abductor muscle in his leg in training on 11 November, and would not be fit until December. He finally made his comeback after four months out injured against Tottenham on 12 December, as a substitute in the 75th minute. Lampard scored a penalty in the 3–3 draw between Chelsea and Aston Villa on 2 January 2011, the first after returning from injury. On 9 January, Lampard scored twice and gave one assist in a 7–0 win against Ipswich Town in the FA Cup reaching the landmark of 201 career club goals.

On 1 February, Lampard scored a penalty against Sunderland, then produced an assist, with Chelsea ending up winning the game 4–2.
Lampard then assisted for Nicolas Anelka in Chelsea&#x27;s 2–0 victory against Copenhagen, in the Round of 16 match in the Champions League. On 1 March, Lampard scored the winning goal in a crucial 2–1 victory over Manchester United, keeping Chelsea&#x27;s Premier League title hopes alive. Then in the next game, he scored two goals in Chelsea&#x27;s 3–1 victory over Blackpool, and also contributed with an assist for John Terry to score.

In April 2011, Lampard scored his 11th goal of the season in a 3–0 victory against former club West Ham. Lampard scored again against Manchester United, but it proved to be only a consolation, as Chelsea lost 2–1 at Old Trafford, thus ending Chelsea&#x27;s title hopes.

====2011–13: European triumphs====
In Chelsea&#x27;s third Premier League match of the season, Lampard scored his first goal of the season and also provided an assist for José Bosingwa&#x27;s opening goal, as Chelsea beat Norwich City 3–1.

After not featuring in Chelsea&#x27;s 4–1 win against Swansea City on 24 September, Lampard returned to the starting line-up for their Champions League group stage game against Valencia netting an important opening goal in their 1–1 draw. Lampard continued his fine form by netting his fifth Chelsea hat-trick on 2 October, in a 5–1 thrashing of Bolton Wanderers.

In the eleventh round of the Premier League, Lampard scored the only goal of the match against Blackburn Rovers with a diving header, giving Chelsea a win after two consecutive defeats. After starting the game against Manchester City on the bench, Lampard came on in the second half to score the winning goal from the penalty spot in the 82nd minute. Lampard again proved to be the match-winner again as he scored in the 89th minute against Wolverhampton Wanderers, with the match finishing 2–1 to Chelsea.

On 25 February 2012, Lampard scored his tenth Premier League goal of the season in Chelsea&#x27;s 3–0 win against Bolton, becoming the only player to score at least ten goals in nine consecutive seasons in the Premier League and his 149th all-time league goal.

Eleven days after the dismissal of manager André Villas-Boas, Chelsea hosted Napoli in the 2011–12 Champions League round of 16-second leg, trailing the Naples side 3–1 from the first leg. Lampard helped Chelsea make a remarkable comeback, assisting John Terry from a corner for the second goal and then equalising the aggregate score from the penalty spot with a powerful shot to the left of the goal. Branislav Ivanović sealed Chelsea&#x27;s victory in extra-time. In the second leg of the quarter-finals of the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League against Benfica, Lampard converted a crucial penalty to give Chelsea a 2–1 win at Stamford Bridge, and helping them advance with an aggregate score of 3–1. He scored the 150th Premier League goal of his career against Fulham in a 1–1 draw on 9 April 2012. In the semi-final of the FA Cup Chelsea defeated Tottenham Hotspur 5–1, in a match that would be remembered for an infamous &quot;goal that never was&quot; awarded to Chelsea&#x27;s Juan Mata. Lampard assisted Didier Drogba for the first goal, and also scored the fourth goal for the Blues from a free-kick 35 yards from goal.

Lampard was pivotal in the semi-finals of the 2011–12 Champions League against the heavily favoured defending champions Barcelona. Bookmakers had Barcelona on the shortest odds to win a second consecutive Champions League title, and various commentators opined that Chelsea would have to produce their best two games of the season – and hope that Barca played their worst two – to upset the Catalan giants. In the first leg at Stamford Bridge, Lampard stripped Lionel Messi off the ball then played a cross-field pass to Ramires, who set up Drogba for the only goal of the game, giving Chelsea a 1–0 advantage. In the second leg at the Camp Nou, Lampard assumed the captaincy after Terry was sent off early in the game. Down 2–0 to Barça just before half-time, Lampard assisted Ramires&#x27; goal with a through-pass which levelled the aggregate score at 2–2 while putting Chelsea ahead on away goals. Chelsea teammate Fernando Torres added another goal in stoppage time to give Chelsea a 3–2 victory overall and produce one of the greatest upsets in the history of European football. This set up Chelsea&#x27;s match with Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena in the Champions League final.

In the 2012 FA Cup Final, Lampard assisted Didier Drogba&#x27;s winning goal in 2–1 win over Liverpool, the seventh FA Cup in Chelsea&#x27;s history as well as the fourth of his career. Lampard captained Chelsea in the 2012 Champions League final against Bayern Munich due to Terry&#x27;s suspension. It was a match where Chelsea were considered to be the underdogs. After finishing 1–1 in normal time, the game went to a penalty shootout with Lampard successfully converting his team&#x27;s third spot-kick, helping Chelsea win 4–3 on penalties. As Chelsea&#x27;s captain for the match, Lampard lifted the trophy with club captain Terry. Lampard ended the 2011–12 season as Chelsea&#x27;s top scorer with 16 goals in all competitions, along with 10 assists.

Lampard missed Euro 2012 with a thigh injury, but did play all of Chelsea&#x27;s pre-season games, scoring against the MLS All-Stars and Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. In Chelsea&#x27;s first game of the new Premier League campaign, Lampard converted a penalty won by Eden Hazard as Chelsea brushed aside Wigan 2–0. In Chelsea&#x27;s second game of the season, three days later against newly promoted Reading, he again converted a penalty won by Hazard as Chelsea cruised to a 4–2 win. On 6 October, he scored his third league goal of the season in a 4–1 win against Norwich City. After six weeks out injured, on 16 December Lampard appeared in the final of the 2012 FIFA Club World Cup with Chelsea losing 1–0 to Brazilian club Corinthians. He marked his 500th appearance in the Premier League by scoring in an 8–0 win against Aston Villa on 23 December. On 30 December 2012, Lampard scored a brace as Chelsea came from a goal down in the game against Everton to win 2–1.

In the third round of the FA Cup, Lampard entered in the second half and scored a penalty in Chelsea&#x27;s victory over Southampton. On 6 January 2013, Lampard&#x27;s agent Steve Kutner announced that Lampard would not be offered a new contract with Chelsea and would leave when his contract expired in June 2013. On 12 January 2013, Lampard scored a penalty in the 4–0 win over Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium. This goal made Lampard Chelsea&#x27;s second-highest goalscorer of all-time with 194 goals and moved him clear of Kerry Dixon and putting him eight goals behind Bobby Tambling in first. He scored his 199th goal for Chelsea in a 4–0 FA Cup victory over Brentford on 17 February, becoming Chelsea&#x27;s all-time leading FA Cup goalscorer with 26 goals. Lampard&#x27;s 200th Chelsea goal came against his former club West Ham on 17 March 2013, heading home an Eden Hazard cross.

Lampard equalled Bobby Tambling&#x27;s record with a long-range goal into the top left corner from just outside the box in the 61st minute in a league match against Aston Villa on 11 May. Then, later on in the 88th minute, he scored a second goal, breaking the record and securing a 2–1 victory for Chelsea. In the UEFA Europa League final on 15 May, Lampard captained the London club to a 2–1 victory over Benfica, securing the 11th major trophy of the Roman Abramovich era.

On 16 May 2013, Lampard signed a one-year extension to his contract with Chelsea, stating &quot;I always maintained the dream was to stay at Chelsea.&quot;

====2013–14: Final season at Chelsea====
On the opening day of the 2013–14 Premier League season, Lampard scored a free-kick in a 2–0 win against newly promoted Hull City. On 1 October, he scored his 205th goal for Chelsea in a 4–0 win away to Steaua București in the Champions League.

Lampard moved to fourth on the all-time Premier League goal-scoring list on 2 December by beating Robbie Fowler&#x27;s number of 164 goals. On 22 February 2014, Lampard scored a stoppage-time winner against Everton, initially credited to John Terry but awarded to Lampard by the Dubious Goals Committee, keeping Chelsea in first place.

In March, in recognition of his contributions, Lampard was given share number 200 by the Chelsea Pitch Owners Association which owns the Stamford Bridge freehold. On 2 April, he played his 100th Champions League match, losing 3–1 to Paris Saint-Germain. On 5 April 2014, Lampard scored the 250th goal of his club career in a 3–0 win against Stoke.

On 23 May 2014, Lampard was included on the list of players released by Chelsea. Lampard, however, said that any contract talks with Chelsea would be decided after the 2014 World Cup, with a statement saying &quot;he will meet with Chelsea before any consideration of a move elsewhere&quot;. On 3 June 2014, Chelsea confirmed Lampard would leave the club.

===Manchester City===
====Signing and New York City FC controversy====
On 24 July 2014, it was claimed that Lampard, as a free agent, had signed a two-year contract with New York City FC (NYCFC) to commence ahead of the 2015 MLS season. It was announced at a live press conference in Brooklyn that he would be joining the club, which would be entering Major League Soccer (MLS) for the 2015 season. Sporting director Claudio Reyna hailed him as &quot;one of the greatest players in world history&quot;. NYCFC&#x27;s parent club, Manchester City, announced on 3 August 2014 that Lampard would join the club on a six-month deal ending in January 2015. Initially reported as a loan, reports emerged on 31 December 2014 that Lampard had signed a short-term contract with the club as a free agent with his MLS contract not to start until the end of his stay in Manchester. The same day, it was announced Lampard would extend his contract with Manchester City until the end of the English season, missing the start of the 2015 MLS season and it was confirmed that Lampard had never been an MLS player with his arrival date in MLS unclear.

Lampard extending his stay in Manchester prompted an angry response from fans in New York, with NYCFC being accused of dishonesty for using the player in their promotional material and MLS Commissioner Don Garber being accused of poor leadership and a lack of transparency in handling the affair. On 1 January 2015, Manchester City head coach Manuel Pellegrini hinted that Lampard could extend his stay at Manchester City to a second season. On 9 January, Manchester City admitted that Lampard had never signed a two-year contract with NYCFC, having instead originally signed a non-binding &quot;commitment&quot; to join the team. The same day, Lampard confirmed his intention to join NYCFC at the end of the 2014–15 Premier League season. Around 300 people asked for season ticket refunds in response to the affair, while the 2015 MLS SuperDraft started a chant of &quot;Where&#x27;s Frank Lampard?&quot; from the crowd.

====2014–15: Only season in Manchester====
Lampard made his Manchester City debut on 13 September in a 2–2 away draw against Arsenal; he received a yellow card and was substituted at half-time for Samir Nasri. He scored his first goal for the club on 21 September with a volley from inside the box against former club Chelsea, having only been on the field for seven minutes as a substitute. Lampard&#x27;s equalising goal ended Chelsea&#x27;s perfect winning streak in the season, but it was a goal which he did not celebrate, and he described it as a very emotional day. In Lampard&#x27;s first League Cup match for City three days later, he scored the first and last goals as the side defeated Sheffield Wednesday 7–0 at home in the third round. On 27 September, Lampard came on in the 71st minute, only to score another goal to make it four goals in four matches and his fourth that week. He made his first Champions League appearance on 30 September in Manchester City&#x27;s 1–1 draw with Roma.

On 1 January 2015, the day after extending his stay with the club, Lampard scored the winner for City in a Premier League encounter against Sunderland. On 14 March 2015, Lampard made his 600th Premier League appearance, becoming the second player to do so after Ryan Giggs, coming on as a substitute during City&#x27;s 1–0 defeat to Burnley. On 24 May, Lampard captained Manchester City in their final match of the season and the last of his spell with the club. He scored his 177th Premier League goal to give City the lead in an eventual 2–0 win over Southampton at the City of Manchester Stadium and was substituted for Jesús Navas in the 77th minute.

===New York City FC===
====2015–16: Final seasons and retirement====
On 10 January 2015, Lampard signed a pre-contract to play for New York City FC in MLS, beginning on 1 July. Injury delayed his debut until 1 August, when he came on as a 69th-minute substitute for Andrew Jacobson in a 3–2 defeat to the Montreal Impact at Yankee Stadium. In July, Lampard was one of the 22 players to be named to the 2015 MLS All-Star Game roster. On 16 September, he scored his first MLS goal as his team beat Toronto 2–0 to end a three-game losing streak. Eleven days later, Lampard scored the opening goal in a 2–1 victory over Vancouver Whitecaps FC in the 29th minute of play; he was later also fouled in the area in the final minute of stoppage time, which allowed David Villa to convert the match-winning goal from the resulting penalty. On 2 October, he scored New York City&#x27;s fastest ever goal in MLS history in a 2–1 away defeat to D.C. United. The team finished its debut season outside a place for the MLS Cup Playoffs, which drew criticism from some in the media, who expected more from the club&#x27;s trio of designated players composed of former Champions League winners Lampard, David Villa, and Andrea Pirlo.

Having missed the beginning of the season with a calf injury, Lampard made his first appearance in 2016 on 22 May in the New York derby, playing the final 15 minutes; New York City lost the game 7–0, while Lampard was jeered by his side&#x27;s own fans. However, he then scored in his first start of the season against Philadelphia Union on 18 June and was cheered by the New York fans once again. In his second start, he managed to make it back-to-back goals against Seattle Sounders FC on 20 June. His fourth goal in five matches came against Sporting Kansas City in a 3–1 defeat on 11 July. Lampard then took his goal tally for the season to five with the third goal in a 3–1 victory over the Montreal Impact on 17 July.

On 31 July 2016, Lampard became the first New York City player to score a hat-trick, achieving this feat in a 5–1 win over the Colorado Rapids. Lampard finished his second MLS season with the club with 13 goals and 3 assists in 19 appearances, as New York City finished in second place in the Eastern Conference, and qualified for the MLS Cup Playoffs for the first time ever, clinching a spot in the Eastern Conference semi-finals. He featured in both legs of the Conference semi-final against Toronto, as New York were eliminated from the Playoffs 7–0 on aggregate. On 14 November 2016, New York City announced that Lampard would leave as soon as his contract expired.

Lampard announced his retirement on 2 February 2017 after turning down several offers, and said that he would look to obtain his coaching qualifications after retiring.

==International career==
===Youth and early career===
Lampard was capped by England at youth level before making his under-21 debut on 13 November 1997 in a match against Greece. He played for the under-21 side from November 1997 to June 2000, and scored nine goals in 19 appearances, a mark bettered only by Alan Shearer and Francis Jeffers. He was capped once by England B, playing in a 2–1 home defeat against Chile on 10 February 1998.

On 10 October 1999, Lampard debuted for the England senior squad in a 2–1 friendly win over Belgium. He scored his first goal on 20 August 2003 in a 3–1 win over Croatia. He was part of the team at the FA Summer Tournament (Manchester) 2004, which England won.

He was overlooked for Euro 2000 and the 2002 World Cup, and had to wait until Euro 2004 to take part in his first international competition. England reached the quarter-finals with Lampard scoring three goals in four matches. He scored against France and Croatia in the group stages. In the quarter-final, he equalised for England in the 112th minute against Portugal, bringing the scoreline to 2–2 but England lost on penalties. He was named in the team of the tournament by UEFA.

===2004–10: UEFA Euro 2004 and 2006 FIFA World Cup===
He became a regular in the squad following the retirement of Paul Scholes, and was voted England Player of the Year by fans in 2004 and 2005. He was England&#x27;s top-scorer in their 2006 World Cup qualifying campaign, with five goals. He scored two crucial goals in the qualifiers, the first against Austria in a 1–0 win, and the second being the winning goal against Poland.

In England&#x27;s first game of the tournament against Paraguay, Lampard was named man of the match as England won 1–0. Though Lampard played every minute of England&#x27;s 2006 World Cup matches, he went scoreless as England were eliminated in the quarterfinals by Portugal on penalties, and he was one of the three England players whose penalty was saved alongside Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher.

He scored in a 2–1 loss to Germany in a friendly at the new Wembley in 2007. He was very disappointing during qualifying for Euro 2008. He was booed by England supporters while coming on as a second-half substitute during England&#x27;s Euro 2008 qualifying match against Estonia on 13 October 2007. Lampard sent Stipe Pletikosa the wrong way from the spot and finished with one goal (in a 3–2 loss to Croatia on 21 November) as England failed to qualify for the tournament. He scored his first international goal in two years in a 4–0 win over Slovakia in March 2009, and also created another for Wayne Rooney. Lampard&#x27;s goal was the 500th England goal scored at Wembley. On 9 September 2009, Lampard struck twice in England&#x27;s 5–1 win against Croatia which secured their place at 2010 World Cup.

===2010–12: 2010 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2012 injury===
In the round-of-16 match of the 2010 FIFA World Cup against rivals Germany, Lampard had a first-half shot at goal that bounced off the crossbar and from TV replays was clearly seen to cross the goal line. If counted, it would have tied the game 2–2. However, neither the referee nor the linesman saw it as a goal, and play was continued. In the second-half, Lampard hit the cross-bar again, with a 30-yard free-kick. The final score was a 4–1 win for Germany, eliminating England from the tournament.

As England exited the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Lampard had already achieved the record of having made 37 shots on goal without scoring in a World Cup tournament, more than any other player since 1966.

On 8 February 2011, it was announced that Lampard would captain the national team against Denmark in a friendly played the next day after both Rio Ferdinand and Steven Gerrard were absent through injury. In the Euro 2012 qualifiers, Lampard netted two goals for England, both penalties. The first against Wales in a 2–0 win, and the latter vs Switzerland in a 2–2 draw. In November 2011, Lampard captained England to a 1–0 friendly victory over current World Champions Spain, a game in which he scored the only goal.
On 31 May 2012, he was ruled out of the Euro 2012 due to a thigh injury. He was subsequently replaced by Jordan Henderson.

===2012–14: Final years with England===
On 14 August 2012, manager Roy Hodgson announced that Lampard would captain the Three Lions in their upcoming friendly against Italy the following day, which England won 2–1. Lampard started England&#x27;s first game in qualification and starred as England thrashed Moldova 5–0, with Lampard scoring his 24th and 25th England goals. His first goal was England&#x27;s 100th ever penalty and his second was a header from a cross from Glen Johnson, after Steven Gerrard was substituted he captained the side. On 22 March 2013, he surpassed David Platt as England&#x27;s highest scoring midfielder when he scored his 28th international goal in a 0–8 win over San Marino. Lampard became only the eighth English player to earn his 100th England cap, doing so in a World Cup qualifier against Ukraine, on 10 September 2013.

On 12 May 2014, Lampard was named in the 23-man England squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and a week later he was named vice-captain. On 24 June, for the last game of the group stage, Lampard captained his England side to draw with Costa Rica 0–0. On 26 August 2014, Lampard announced that he had retired from international football. He earned 106 caps, scoring 29 goals.

==Style of play==
Regarded by some pundits, managers, and teammates as one of the greatest midfielders of his generation, Lampard was an all-round and versatile box-to-box player, who was capable of playing anywhere in midfield; throughout his career he was deployed as a central midfielder, as an attacking midfielder, as a defensive midfielder, and even as a supporting striker on occasion. He was also deployed as a deep-lying playmaker on occasion, in particular in his later career, due to his ability to build attacks with his passing.

A hard-working player, with notable stamina and an ability to read the game, Lampard was also capable of functioning creatively and starting attacking plays or providing assists for teammates after winning back possession, due to his technique, vision, and passing range. In addition to his creative and defensive midfield duties, Lampard also possessed a keen eye for goal, due to his ability to get forward and make late attacking runs from behind into the penalty area, or produce accurate and powerful shots from distance. These attributes enabled him to maintain a prolific goalscoring record throughout his career, despite his deep playing position. Moreover, Lampard was also an accurate set-piece and penalty kick taker, who was known for scoring with powerful, low driving shots from free kicks.

Beyond his qualities as a footballer, he also stood out for his leadership throughout his career. In 2017, Gareth Southgate labelled Lampard as one of the group of England&#x27;s past players who were &quot;very good&quot;, but below the likes of the nation&#x27;s past &quot;top players&quot;, such as Gascoigne, Scholes, and Rooney, commenting: &quot;You&#x27;ve got very good players and then there are top players. In my time in the England setup, Paul Gascoigne, Paul Scholes and Rooney just had that little bit more than all the others. And we are talking high‑level people there, players like Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and David Beckham.&quot;

==Managerial career==
===Derby County===
On 31 May 2018, Lampard was appointed as manager of Championship club Derby County on a three-year contract. His first game in charge, on 3 August, resulted in a 2–1 away win for Derby at Reading, with Tom Lawrence scoring a last-minute winner. His first loss as a manager came on 11 August in a 4–1 loss against Leeds United, in his second match in charge. On 25 September, in just his 12th game as a manager, Lampard&#x27;s Derby County knocked Premier League club Manchester United out of the EFL Cup on penalties, following a 2–2 draw at Old Trafford.

After a 2–0 defeat in the return fixture against Leeds United at Elland Road on 11 January 2019 to further Leeds&#x27; lead at the top of the Championship table, Lampard was critical of Leeds head coach Marcelo Bielsa, as in the pre-match build-up Bielsa admitted he had sent a spy to the Derby training ground, after reports emerged in the press that a man was spotted the previous day outside the Derby training ground. On 12 January, Leeds United released a statement in response to the incident. Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino described the incident as &#x27;not a big deal&#x27; and commonplace in Argentina.

In his first season in charge of Derby, Lampard guided the club to the Championship play-offs after helping them finish 6th in the 2018–19 Championship season. In the semi-finals of the play-offs, Derby overturned a 0–1 home loss to win 4–2 away against Leeds United and claim the tie 4–3 on aggregate, setting up an appearance against Aston Villa in the final. Derby lost the play-off final to Aston Villa 2–1.

Upon the conclusion of the season, Lampard was heavily linked with the vacant managerial spot at former club Chelsea. On 25 June 2019, Derby granted Lampard permission to hold talks with the Chelsea bosses over said position.

===Chelsea===
On 4 July 2019, Lampard was appointed as the new head coach at former club Chelsea on a three-year contract, making him the first English manager to manage the side in over two decades. In Lampard&#x27;s first competitive game with Chelsea, the club lost 4–0 to Manchester United on the opening day of the 2019–20 Premier League. It was the biggest defeat for a Chelsea manager in their first game since Danny Blanchflower&#x27;s team was beaten 7–2 by Middlesbrough in December 1978. In Lampard&#x27;s second competitive game, they lost to Liverpool on penalties in the 2019 UEFA Super Cup.

On 24 August 2019, Lampard obtained his first Premier League victory as Chelsea manager, beating Norwich City 2–3 away from home. On 25 September, Chelsea picked up their first home win under Lampard, beating League Two side Grimsby Town 7–1 in the EFL Cup. Lampard&#x27;s matchday squad against Grimsby featured ten academy graduates, including Reece James and Billy Gilmour, making their first-team debuts. Lampard won Premier League Manager of the Month for October 2019 after Chelsea recorded a perfect record in the league for the month. By doing so, he became the third manager to win Premier League Player of the Month and Manager of the Month, after Gareth Southgate and Stuart Pearce. Lampard eventually guided Chelsea to fourth in the Premier League and the FA Cup Final, where they lost to Arsenal.

In the following season, Chelsea made five major acquisitions in the summer transfer window in Hakim Ziyech, Timo Werner, Ben Chilwell, Kai Havertz and Édouard Mendy. Chelsea initially started strongly, topping their Champions League group and the Premier League in early December. However, after a run of two wins in eight Premier League matches, Chelsea dropped to ninth and Lampard was dismissed as manager on 25 January 2021. He remained on Chelsea&#x27;s payroll to see out his contract, &quot;pocketing £75,000&quot; per week in compensation. His dismissal came just 24 hours after Chelsea&#x27;s 3–1 win over Luton Town in the FA Cup. On 26 January, German coach Thomas Tuchel was announced as his replacement.

It was reported Lampard&#x27;s departure was also influenced by disagreements with the club&#x27;s transfer policy; Lampard is said to have requested the acquisitions of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Declan Rice, and James Tarkowski, with these moves being blocked by Chelsea&#x27;s co-director Marina Granovskaia. Lampard also reportedly fell out with or had limited communication with some players, causing former teammate and club advisor Petr Čech to have to serve as an intermediary.

===Everton===
Having been out of work for a year, Lampard was appointed manager of Premier League club Everton on 31 January 2022, after the dismissal of Rafael Benítez due to poor results. At the time of his appointment, the club was positioned in 16th place, four points above the relegation zone. With one game remaining in the 2021–22 season, on 19 May Lampard guided Everton to Premier League safety maintaining their 68-year top flight status. Having been 2–0 down at half-time to Crystal Palace Lampard brought on Dele Alli and played a more attacking formation resulting in a 3–2 win for the Merseyside team. Lampard described the night as &quot;one of the greatest nights of my career&quot;.

The following season saw the club once again fall into a relegation battle, with a run of only 1 win in 11 matches leaving the club 19th in the league by January. Everton owner Farhad Moshiri in an interview with Talksport suggested that Lampard&#x27;s position at the club remained secure despite this run of form. However, Lampard was sacked a few days later on 23 January 2023, just eight days less than a year into the job, after a 2–0 loss to West Ham. Lampard was replaced by Sean Dyche on 30 January 2023.

===Return to Chelsea===
On 6 April 2023, Lampard returned to Chelsea by being appointed as caretaker manager until the end of the 2022–23 season, following the dismissal of Graham Potter. Chelsea&#x27;s form dropped after Lampard took over and produced a first bottom-half finish since 1996 and a record low tally of points and goals scored in the Premier League era. In terms of winning percentage, Lampard also had the worst record (9%) among every Chelsea manager who had led 3 or more matches, achieving just one win in his 11 matches in charge.
===Coventry City===
On 28 November 2024, Lampard was appointed as the new manager of EFL Championship club Coventry City.

==Media==
From 2015 until 2017, Lampard served as a team captain on the ITV comedy panel show &quot;Play to the Whistle&quot; alongside Bradley Walsh. He was a regular pundit for football on BT Sport. For the 2018 World Cup, Lampard was among the BBC&#x27;s list of pundits as he insisted that it would not affect his managerial duties.

Lampard features in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series; he was on the cover for the International edition of &quot;FIFA 10&quot;, alongside Wayne Rooney and Theo Walcott. In 2018, Lampard was added as an icon to the Ultimate Team in &quot;FIFA 19&quot;.

On Sunday 9 June 2024, Lampard led England to a 6–3 victory as manager in the annual Soccer Aid game against the rest of the world. The match raised £15 million for charity.

==Personal life==
Lampard was born in Romford, London; he has two sisters, Natalie and Claire. He attended Brentwood School between 1989 and 1994, finishing with eleven GCSEs, including an A* in Latin.

Lampard belongs to a family of footballers; his father is Frank Lampard, Sr., the former West Ham United player and assistant manager who was still associated with the club when Lampard junior was playing for them. Lampard&#x27;s uncle is Harry Redknapp and his cousin is Redknapp&#x27;s son Jamie Redknapp. His mother Pat, a librarian, died in April 2008 aged 58 as a result of pneumonia.

Lampard is a Christian, and credits his faith for helping him cope with the death of his mother.

Lampard is a supporter of the Conservative Party and was rumoured to be running as a candidate for Kensington upon Malcolm Rifkind&#x27;s retirement at the 2015 general election. He subsequently denied that he was running to be an MP.

He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2015 Birthday Honours. Lampard published his autobiography, &quot;Totally Frank&quot;, in 2006. He has written a series of children&#x27;s novels, inspired by his mother and children, related to football.

Lampard formerly owned The Pig&#x27;s Ear, Chelsea&#x27;s oldest pub, with his father. They sold the business in 2018, and his father then took over the Grade II Nightingale pub in Wanstead in 2019. Lampard has retained the ownership of the freehold at the Old Church Street, Chelsea property.

Lampard has had a troubled relationship with his boyhood club West Ham United where he was seen by some fans as a product of nepotism. He claims that he often received negative taunts about his weight, and that during a match as an 18-year-old when he broke his leg in play, he heard cheers from fans. Following his transfer to Chelsea, Lampard turned against his former club and has since stated: &quot;I remember when Joe Cole first came to Chelsea he would turn away in disappointment if West Ham lost. I would smile. That&#x27;s how deeply I felt. I wanted West Ham to lose. Now I don&#x27;t even look for their results.&quot; Later in his career, Lampard adopted a more mature attitude towards his former club saying that he had complete respect for the club and thanking Harry Redknapp and Tony Carr for the influence at the start of his career.

===Controversies===
In 2000, Lampard, Rio Ferdinand and Kieron Dyer appeared on a sex video that was filmed at the holiday resort of Ayia Napa in Cyprus. Channel 4 aired a brief edited clip as part of their 2004 documentary &quot;Sex, Footballers and Videotape&quot;, claiming it was used to &quot;remind the viewer that this is based on real life&quot;. On 23 September 2001, Lampard, along with three other Chelsea players, was fined two weeks&#x27; wages by the club for his behaviour whilst on a drinking binge on 12 September. Lampard and the others had abused American tourists at a Heathrow hotel, just 24 hours after the September 11 attacks. A hotel manager stated: &quot;they were utterly disgusting. They just didn&#x27;t seem to care about what had happened&quot;. Lampard apologised over his behaviour when he signed for NYCFC in 2014, implying that he did not mean offence and that he was naive and young.

In 2021, Lampard was charged with using a mobile phone while driving after being filmed by CyclingMikey holding a takeaway cup in one hand and a mobile phone in the other. Lampard hired Nick Freeman to defend him. The case was later dropped as the Crown Prosecution Service stated it had insufficient evidence.

===Relationships===
Lampard lives in Surrey and London. He has two daughters with his former fiancée, Spanish model Elen Rivas.

On 24 April 2009, Lampard was involved in a radio confrontation with James O&#x27;Brien on the London radio station LBC 97.3. Newspapers had reported that following Lampard&#x27;s split from Rivas their children were living with her in a small flat while Lampard had converted their family home into a bachelor pad. Lampard phoned in, objecting to criticism and asserting that he had fought &quot;tooth and nail&quot; to keep his family together.

Lampard married Christine Bleakley, a Northern Irish broadcaster, on 20 December 2015. They have a daughter born in 2018 and a son born in 2021.

<text>Colonel Bailey Kelly Ashford (September 18, 1873 – November 1, 1934) was an American physician who had a military career in the United States Army, and afterward taught full-time at the School of Tropical Medicine in Puerto Rico, which he helped establish in San Juan.

A pioneering physician in the treatment of anemia, Ashford organized and conducted a parasite treatment campaign against hookworm while stationed in Puerto Rico. This cured approximately 300,000 persons (one-third of the Puerto Rico population) and reduced the death rate from associated anemia by 90 percent. He was a founding member of the Puerto Rico Anemia Commission.

==Early years==
Ashford was born in Washington, D.C., on September 18, 1873, as one of five children in the family of Francis Ashford, a prominent physician, and his wife. His general education was obtained at the public schools and at Columbian University in Washington, D.C. (now George Washington University). In 1896, he graduated from the Georgetown University School of Medicine. He served as a resident physician in several area hospitals.

Commissioned lieutenant in the United States Army Medical Corps in November 1897, Ashford accompanied the military expedition to Puerto Rico in 1898 during the Spanish–American War.

==Personal life==
Ashford made Puerto Rico his adopted home, marrying a local woman, María López Nussa. They had three children: Mahlon, Margarita, and Gloria María.

==Professional life==
===Hookworm treatment===
Serving as the medical officer in the general military hospital in Ponce, Puerto Rico, in 1899 he was the first to describe and successfully treat North American hookworm. He was a tireless clinician and conducted an exhaustive study of the anemia caused by hookworm infestation, which was the leading cause of death and responsible for as many as 12,000 deaths a year. From 1903 to 1904, together with his colleague Pedro Gutiérrez Igaravídez, he organized and conducted a parasite treatment and education campaign, which treated approximately 300,000 persons (one-third of the Puerto Rico population). This work reduced the death rate from this anemia by 90 percent. Through Ashford&#x27;s professor, Charles Wardell Stiles, his work also led to the creation of a seminal campaign to fight hookworm in the American South that was funded by John D. Rockefeller.

===Anemia treatment===
Captain Ashford was a founding member of the Puerto Rico Anemia Commission. By special authority of the Secretary of War, he served on the Commission from 1904 to 1906.

===School of Tropical Medicine===
In 1911, his proposal for an Institute of Tropical Medicine (Later renamed School of Tropical Medicine) in Puerto Rico was approved by Antonio R. Barceló, the president of the Puerto Rican Senate. He pushed for passage of the legislation to authorize the school, and Governor Horace Mann Towner and his cabinet proceeded to create it. After serving as a commander of the Army Medical Department&#x27;s First Division during World War I, Colonel Ashford was assigned to San Juan. He campaigned for the development of &quot;a real school of tropical medicine in the American tropics&quot;.

Ashford was promoted to lieutenant colonel in July 1916 and colonel in May 1917. During World War I, he left Puerto Rico to serve as director of the U.S. Army Sanitary School in Langres, France.

The School of Tropical Medicine of Puerto Rico was formally dedicated in 1925.

Ashford retired from active duty on February 10, 1928. After a 30-year Army career as a military doctor, he assumed a full-time faculty position at the School, where he continued his interest in tropical medicine. Together with doctors Isaac González Martínez and Ramón M. Suárez Calderon, he continued to carry out experiments related to anemia. The University of Puerto Rico campus at Rio Piedras, the building of the Institute of Tropical Medicine (see drawings) in Puerta de Tierra, San Juan, is one of the few examples of the Neo-Plateresque architectural style in the Island.

==Legacy and honors==

In his honor, the main avenue in the San Juan, Puerto Rico district of Condado, bears his name as does the Ashford Presbyterian Community Hospital as well as the Ashford Medical Center, also in Condado. His home in Condado is being preserved and renovated.

In 1911, Ashford was conferred the honorary degree of Doctor of Science by Georgetown University. In 1915, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine by Georgetown University professors George M. Kober and Francis A. Tondorf. In 1925, Ashford was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for his World War I service.

In 1941, The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene established the &quot;Bailey K. Ashford Medal&quot;. This is awarded for distinguished work in tropical medicine to a worker in his or her early or mid-career. The first person to receive the award was Lloyd E. Rozeboom. The medal is awarded every year, and more than one award may be given.

Ashford died on November 1, 1934, in his home in San Juan. Originally buried at the Fort Brooke Military Cemetery, his remains were re-interred at Puerto Rico National Cemetery in the city of Bayamón on April 20, 1954.

<doc id="708839" wikidata="Q3895095" url="?curid=708839" title="Loschmidt's paradox">
<text>In physics, Loschmidt&#x27;s paradox (named for J.J. Loschmidt), also known as the reversibility paradox, irreversibility paradox, or (), is the objection that it should not be possible to deduce an irreversible process from time-symmetric dynamics. This puts the time reversal symmetry of (almost) all known low-level fundamental physical processes at odds with any attempt to infer from them the second law of thermodynamics which describes the behaviour of macroscopic systems. Both of these are well-accepted principles in physics, with sound observational and theoretical support, yet they seem to be in conflict, hence the paradox.

== Origin ==
Josef Loschmidt&#x27;s criticism was provoked by the H-theorem of Boltzmann, which employed kinetic theory to explain the increase of entropy in an ideal gas from a non-equilibrium state, when the molecules of the gas are allowed to collide. In 1876, Loschmidt pointed out that if there is a motion of a system from time &quot;t&quot;0 to time &quot;t&quot;1 to time &quot;t&quot;2 that leads to a steady decrease of &quot;H&quot; (increase of entropy) with time, then there is another allowed state of motion of the system at &quot;t&quot;1, found by reversing all the velocities, in which &quot;H&quot; must increase. This revealed that one of Boltzmann&#x27;s key assumptions, molecular chaos, or, the &quot;Stosszahlansatz&quot;, that all particle velocities were completely uncorrelated, did not follow from Newtonian dynamics. One can assert that possible correlations are uninteresting, and therefore decide to ignore them; but if one does so, one has changed the conceptual system, injecting an element of time-asymmetry by that very action.

Reversible laws of motion cannot explain why we experience our world to be in such a comparatively low state of entropy at the moment (compared to the equilibrium entropy of universal heat death); and to have been at even lower entropy in the past.

Later authors have coined the term &quot;Loschmitz&#x27;s demon&quot; (in analogy to Maxwell&#x27;s demon, see below) for an entity that is able to reverse time evolution in a microscopic system, in their case of nuclear spins, which is indeed, if only for a short time, experimentally possible.

=== Before Loschmidt ===
In 1874, two years before the Loschmidt paper, William Thomson defended the second law against the time reversal objection in his paper &quot;The kinetic theory of the dissipation of energy&quot;.

== Arrow of time ==
Any process that happens regularly in the forward direction of time but rarely or never in the opposite direction, such as entropy increasing in an isolated system, defines what physicists call an arrow of time in nature. This term only refers to an observation of an asymmetry in time; it is not meant to suggest an explanation for such asymmetries. Loschmidt&#x27;s paradox is equivalent to the question of how it is possible that there could be a thermodynamic arrow of time given time-symmetric fundamental laws, since time-symmetry implies that for any process compatible with these fundamental laws, a reversed version that looked exactly like a film of the first process played backwards would be equally compatible with the same fundamental laws, and would even be equally probable if one were to pick the system&#x27;s initial state randomly from the phase space of all possible states for that system.

Although most of the arrows of time described by physicists are thought to be special cases of the thermodynamic arrow, there are a few that are believed to be unconnected, like the cosmological arrow of time based on the fact that the universe is expanding rather than contracting, and the fact that a few processes in particle physics actually violate time-symmetry, while they respect a related symmetry known as CPT symmetry. In the case of the cosmological arrow, most physicists believe that entropy would continue to increase even if the universe began to contract (although the physicist Thomas Gold once proposed a model in which the thermodynamic arrow would reverse in this phase). In the case of the violations of time-symmetry in particle physics, the situations in which they occur are rare and are only known to involve a few types of meson particles. Furthermore, due to CPT symmetry, reversal of the direction of time is equivalent to renaming particles as antiparticles and &quot;vice versa&quot;. Therefore, this cannot explain Loschmidt&#x27;s paradox.

== Dynamical systems ==
Current research in dynamical systems offers one possible mechanism for obtaining irreversibility from reversible systems. The central argument is based on the claim that the correct way to study the dynamics of macroscopic systems is to study the transfer operator corresponding to the microscopic equations of motion. It is then argued that the transfer operator is not unitary (&quot;i.e.&quot; is not reversible) but has eigenvalues whose magnitude is strictly less than one; these eigenvalues corresponding to decaying physical states. This approach is fraught with various difficulties; it works well for only a handful of exactly solvable models.

Abstract mathematical tools used in the study of dissipative systems include definitions of mixing, wandering sets, and ergodic theory in general.

== Fluctuation theorem ==

One approach to handling Loschmidt&#x27;s paradox is the fluctuation theorem, derived heuristically by Denis Evans and Debra Searles, which gives a numerical estimate of the probability that a system away from equilibrium will have a certain value for the dissipation function (often an entropy like property) over a certain amount of time. The result is obtained with the exact time reversible dynamical equations of motion and the universal causation proposition. The fluctuation theorem is obtained using the fact that dynamics is time reversible. Quantitative predictions of this theorem have been confirmed in laboratory experiments at the Australian National University conducted by Edith M. Sevick et al. using optical tweezers apparatus. This theorem is applicable for transient systems, which may initially be in equilibrium and then driven away (as was the case for the first experiment by Sevick et al.) or some other arbitrary initial state, including relaxation towards equilibrium. There is also an asymptotic result for systems which are in a nonequilibrium steady state at all times.

There is a crucial point in the fluctuation theorem, that differs from how Loschmidt framed the paradox. Loschmidt considered the probability of observing a single trajectory, which is analogous to enquiring about the probability of observing a single point in phase space. In both of these cases the probability is always zero. To be able to effectively address this you must consider the probability density for a set of points in a small region of phase space, or a set of trajectories. The fluctuation theorem considers the probability density for all of the trajectories that are initially in an infinitesimally small region of phase space. This leads directly to the probability of finding a trajectory, in either the forward or the reverse trajectory sets, depending upon the initial probability distribution as well as the dissipation which is done as the system evolves. It is this crucial difference in approach that allows the fluctuation theorem to correctly solve the paradox.

==Information theory==

A more recent proposal concentrates on the step of the paradox in which velocities are reversed. At that moment the gas becomes an open system, and in order to reverse the velocities, position and velocity measurements have to be made. Without this, no reversal is possible. These measurements are themselves either irreversible, or reversible. In the first case, they require an increase of entropy in the measuring device that will at least offset the decrease during the reversed evolution of the gas. In the second case, Landauer&#x27;s principle can be evoked to reach the same conclusion. Hence, the gas+measuring device system obeys the Second Law of Thermodynamics. It is not a coincidence that this argument mirrors closely another one given by Bennett to explain away Maxwell’s demon. The difference is that the role of measurement is obvious in Maxwell’s demon, but not in Loschmidt’s paradox, which may explain the 40-year gap between both explanations. In the case of the single-trajectory paradox, this argument preempts the need for any other explanation, although some of them make valid points. The broader paradox, “an irreversible process cannot be deduced from reversible dynamics,” is not covered by the argument given in this section.

== Big Bang ==
Another way of dealing with Loschmidt&#x27;s paradox is to see the second law as an expression of a set of boundary conditions, in which our universe&#x27;s time coordinate has a low-entropy starting point: the Big Bang. From this point of view, the arrow of time is determined entirely by the direction that leads away from the Big Bang, and a hypothetical universe with a maximum-entropy Big Bang would have no arrow of time. The theory of cosmic inflation tries to give reason why the early universe had such a low entropy.

<text>Ranunculus repens, the creeping buttercup, is a flowering plant in the buttercup family Ranunculaceae, native to Europe, Asia and northwestern Africa. It is also called creeping crowfoot and (along with restharrow) sitfast.

==Description==
It is a herbaceous, stoloniferous perennial plant growing to tall. It has both prostrate running stems, which produce roots and new plants at the nodes, and more or less erect flowering stems. The basal leaves are compound, borne on a long petiole and divided into three broad leaflets long, shallowly to deeply lobed, each of which is stalked, distinguishing the species from &quot;Ranunculus acris&quot; in which the terminal leaflet is sessile. The leaves higher on the stems are smaller, with narrower leaflets and may be simple and lanceolate. Both the stems and the leaves are finely hairy. The flowers are golden yellow, glossy, and diameter, usually with five petals, and the flower stem is finely grooved. The gloss is caused by the smooth upper surface of the petal that acts like a mirror; the gloss aids in attracting pollinating insects and thermoregulation of the flower&#x27;s reproductive organs. The fruit is a cluster of achenes long. Creeping buttercup has three-lobed dark green, white-spotted leaves that grow out of the node. It grows in fields and pastures and prefers wet soil.

==Habitat==
It is a very common weed of agricultural land and gardens, spreading quickly by its rooting stolons and resisting removal with a deeply anchored filamentous root ball. In Ireland: very common in damp places, ditches and flooded areas.

==Cultivation and uses==
Creeping buttercup was sold in many parts of the world as an ornamental plant, and has now become an invasive species in many parts of the world.

Like most buttercups, &quot;Ranunculus repens&quot; is poisonous, although these poisons are lost when dried with hay. The taste of buttercups is acrid, so cattle avoid eating them. The plants then take advantage of the cropped ground around them to spread their stolons. Creeping buttercup also is spread through the transportation of hay. Contact with the sap of the plant can cause skin blistering.

==Etymology==
&quot;Ranunculus&quot; is a diminutive of &#x27;rana&#x27;, meaning &#x27;little frog&#x27;. This name is in reference to the amphibious habitat of many &quot;Ranunculus&quot; species.

&quot;Repens&quot; means &#x27;creeping&#x27; or &#x27;stoloniferous&#x27;.

<doc id="708843" wikidata="Q995073" url="?curid=708843" title="Bryan Murray (ice hockey)">
<text>Bryan Clarence Murray (December 5, 1942 – August 12, 2017) was a Canadian professional ice hockey executive and coach. He served as general manager of the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey League (NHL) from 2007 to 2016. He had previously been general manager of the NHL&#x27;s Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, Florida Panthers, and Detroit Red Wings. He was also the head coach for the Washington Capitals, Detroit Red Wings, Florida Panthers, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, and Ottawa Senators, for a total of 17 full or partial seasons.

He compiled over 600 NHL victories in regular season games. In his 13 full NHL seasons as head coach, he took his teams to the playoffs 12 times. In other leagues, he was head coach of the American Hockey League&#x27;s Hershey Bears and the Western Hockey League&#x27;s Regina Pats.

==Early life==
Murray played ice hockey in his hometown of Shawville growing up, joining the Shawville Pontiacs intermediate club at age 14. He later joined the Rockland Nationals of the Central Junior Hockey League. He attended Macdonald College, a suburban campus of McGill University, which is located in Ste. Anne de Bellevue, Quebec, where he played hockey and football. He returned to Shawville and worked as a gym teacher at Pontiac Protestant High School. He then went into business buying a local motel, and starting Murray&#x27;s Sporting Goods in Shawville, later managed by his wife Geri.

==Early coaching career==
Murray began his coaching career with the Rockland Nationals in 1976 when the team went all the way and won the Centennial Cup of the Canadian Junior Hockey League (CJHL). He earned a good reputation as a coach and was offered a position with the Pembroke Lumber Kings, and then with the Regina Pats of the Western Hockey League (WHL). He left his business interests in the hands of family members and moved west. He took Regina to the Memorial Cup in 1980. Murray then became the head coach of the American Hockey League&#x27;s Hershey Bears in 1980–81, and served in that role until he was promoted to head coach of the Washington Capitals, the Hershey Bears&#x27; parent NHL team, partway through the next season in 1981–82.

==NHL coach and general manager==
In seven full seasons with the Capitals, Murray brought the team to the playoffs each year, and these playoff appearances were the first in franchise history. In his second year, the Capitals won their first playoff series. However, his teams did not advance beyond the second round. He won the Jack Adams Award as coach of the year in 1984. Murray was fired partway through the 1989–90 season, with the team struggling, and was replaced by his brother Terry Murray.

In 1990, Murray became a coach and general manager of the Detroit Red Wings. The team had good results in his three seasons, making the playoffs each year, but not getting beyond the second round. He remained as general manager in the 1993–94 season, after the team named Scotty Bowman as head coach. He departed the Red Wings following the season.

Murray was next appointed general manager of the expansion Florida Panthers in 1994. In 1996, the young Panthers made it to the Stanley Cup Finals, and Murray was selected as NHL Executive of the Year. He also coached the Panthers for part of the 1997–98 season.

He next joined the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim as head coach for the 2001–02 season. From 2002 to 2004, Murray was general manager of the Mighty Ducks, and again saw his team quickly make a mark in the playoffs, reaching the Stanley Cup Finals. After a disappointing 2003–04 season with the Mighty Ducks, he surprised many by deciding to resign from the general manager post, and became the head coach of the Ottawa Senators close to his hometown.

On February 20, 2007, he became the fifth NHL coach to achieve 600 victories, in a shootout win against the Edmonton Oilers. Despite this impressive number of victories (at the time the most among active NHL coaches), Murray never won a Stanley Cup. In his most recent trip to the Finals as head coach in 2007, the Senators team that he coached lost in five games to his former club, the Anaheim Ducks. 

With the firing of John Muckler on June 18, 2007, Murray was promoted to general manager of the Senators, while assistant coach John Paddock took over the club&#x27;s head coaching duties. However, on February 27, 2008, following a 15–2 start, which had briefly put the Senators in first place in the Eastern Conference, Murray fired Paddock after the team struggled through a disastrous January and February. Murray stepped in as interim head coach for the remainder of the 2007–08 season, finishing with a 7–9–2 record, with the team ultimately finishing in seventh place in the Eastern Conference. The Senators were swept in the first round of the playoffs by the Pittsburgh Penguins.

Craig Hartsburg was hired as the new coach of the team in June 2008. After the Senators struggled for most of the 2008–09 season, Murray fired Hartsburg after a 7–4 loss against the Capitals. In 48 games as head coach of the Senators, Hartsburg posted a 17–24–7 record. Cory Clouston, head coach of the AHL&#x27;s Binghamton Senators, the team&#x27;s top farm club, was hired as interim head coach. Clouston was appointed as head coach with a two-year contract before the next season.

Murray signed a three-year contract extension as general manager on April 8, 2011. He fired Clouston and two assistant coaches on April 9, 2011, following the Senators&#x27; last game of the season. The team had been beset by injuries to key players such as captain Daniel Alfredsson and star forward Jason Spezza, leading to a mid-season collapse. Murray made a flurry of trades in 2011, after the Senators had fallen out of contention, and promoted many younger players from the team&#x27;s Binghamton farm club.

In 2012, Murray was added to the Shawville Hockey Walk of Fame. In 2015, he was inducted into the Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame. In 2017, he was added to the Senators&#x27; &quot;Ring of Honour&quot; at Canadian Tire Centre.

==Personal life==
Murray, one of ten children born to Clarence and Rhoda Murray, was born and raised in the small Ottawa Valley town of Shawville, Quebec, near Ottawa. He had two daughters with his wife Geri, Heide and Brittany. 

His younger brother, Terry Murray, was head coach for the Washington Capitals, Philadelphia Flyers, Florida Panthers, and Los Angeles Kings. His nephew, Tim Murray, previously served under Bryan as assistant general manager of the Senators, and later served as the general manager of the Buffalo Sabres.

==Health and death==
In July 2014, the Senators website announced Murray was diagnosed with cancer and was undergoing treatment. On November 13, 2014, Murray announced he had stage 4 colon cancer, which had spread to his liver and lungs. He said &quot;there is no cure for me at this point&quot; and that he may have had cancer for up to ten years before its detection.

On August 12, 2017, Murray died of colon cancer at the age of 74, three years after he was diagnosed. His funeral was held in his hometown at the Shawville United Church and a Celebration of Life was held at the Canadian Tire Centre. Murray was survived by his wife Geri (née Sutton), daughters Heide and Brittany, and granddaughters Emma and Addie.

The Senators wore a decal on the side of their helmets in his memory for the 2017–18 season, a red circle, inside of which are his initials, years of birth and death, and a brief description of him as a &quot;family man, friend, coach, and mentor.&quot; Senators&#x27; goaltender Craig Anderson unveiled a new mask for the 2018-19 season which featured Murray&#x27;s likeness on the left side with the caption &quot;1942-2017&quot;. Designed by Sylvie Marsolais, the mask design was Anderson&#x27;s way of thanking the man who brought him to Ottawa in 2011. &quot;My career took a turn for the better once I met Bryan,&quot; said Anderson.

<text>William Howell Masters (December 27, 1915 – February 16, 2001) was an American gynecologist and the senior member of the Masters and Johnson human sexuality research team. Along with his partner Virginia E. Johnson, he pioneered research into the nature of human sexual response and the diagnosis and treatment of sexual dysfunctions and disorders from 1957 until the 1990s.

==Early life==
Born in Cleveland, Ohio, William Masters was the older son of Francis Wynn Masters and Estabrooks Taylor Masters. His younger brother was named Frank. Growing up, Masters had a particularly rough childhood at the hands of his father, a difficult man who liked to be in control and had a very bad temper. All household decisions had to be cleared through the father, and in fits of anger he beat young Bill with a belt, sometimes until Bill bled. Nevertheless, Bill was a bright child and excelled at school. After his Aunt Sally decided to pay his tuition, Masters attended the Lawrenceville School, a preparatory school in New Jersey, then for boys only. Once Bill began his education, his father considered him an adult and gave him little to no financial or family support, and so he rarely visited home. With the completion of his early education Masters then attended and graduated from Hamilton College in upstate New York. Afterward, he enrolled at the University of Rochester Medical School, from which he received his medical degree. He was a member of Alpha Delta Phi, and became a faculty member at Washington University in St. Louis. In 1942, he married his first wife, Elizabeth Ellis, who was known as Libby or Betty. The couple had two children.

==Career==

===Sexological research===

===Relationship with Virginia Johnson===
Masters met Virginia E. Johnson in 1957 when he hired her as a research assistant to undertake a comprehensive study of human sexuality. Masters divorced his first wife, Elizabeth Ellis Masters, to marry Johnson in 1971. Masters and Johnson eventually divorced over two decades later but continued their professional collaboration.

==Death==
William Masters suffered complications from Parkinson&#x27;s disease and died in Tucson, Arizona, on February 16, 2001. Masters&#x27;s second wife, Virginia Johnson, died in July 2013. Dr. Masters was survived by two children from his marriage to Elizabeth Ellis: Sarah Masters Paul, and William Howell Masters III. He was a church-going Episcopalian and a registered Republican.

==In popular culture==
The American cable network Showtime debuted &quot;Masters of Sex&quot;, a dramatic television series loosely based on the 2009 biography of the same name, on September 29, 2013. The series stars Michael Sheen as Masters and Lizzy Caplan as Virginia Johnson.

Sheen has stated in an interview that he does not know what the real Bill Masters was like and he was doing his own interpretation in his portrayal of him.

<text>Lake Tappan is a reservoir impounded by the Tappan Dam on the Hackensack River, straddling the border between the U.S. states of New Jersey and New York. Within New Jersey, the lake traverses the border separating the municipalities of River Vale and Old Tappan in Bergen County, while extending northward across the New York state line into the town of Orangetown in Rockand County. The reservoir was formed in 1967, flooding areas that included the former CAPROC Field Civil Air Patrol airstrip.

The Lake Tappan reservoir covers 1,255 acres (5.1 km2), the majority of its area being within New Jersey, and it contains of water, with up to released downstream daily into the Oradell Reservoir, which lies entirely within Bergen County in New Jersey. The passage of this water between reservoirs can occur in as rapidly as two to three hours. Lake Tappan has an average depth of 21&#x27; with a maximum depth of 43&#x27;.

On March 11, 2003, New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey visited the reservoir and proposed protecting it as well as the nearby Woodcliff Lake Reservoir and their tributaries with Category 1 water purity status.

The reservoir is owned by Suez North America, a private utility.

Lake Tappan is a local fishing spot as well, serving as a habitat for bluegill, bass, perch, catfish and carp.

<doc id="708863" wikidata="Q1428782" url="?curid=708863" title="Speak English or Die">
<text>Speak English or Die is the debut album by the American crossover thrash band Stormtroopers of Death, released in August 1985.

Parts of the songs &quot;March of the S.O.D.&quot;, &quot;Milano Mosh&quot;, &quot;Chromatic Death&quot; and &quot;Sargent D and the S.O.D.&quot; were used for commercial breaks of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; in the early 1990s.

==Composition==
After Anthrax finished recording &quot;Spreading the Disease&quot;, there was still some studio time left, so members Scott Ian and Charlie Benante called some friends, practiced some songs, and recorded it all within a week.

Many point to this album – and particularly the song &quot;Milk&quot; – as one of the first songs to feature a blast beat, courtesy of Benante. When asked in 2009 if he invented the blast beat, Benante replied, &quot;If you mean that I decided to sit in my room and invent it, no it wasn&#x27;t like that. The thing was something that had been around the NY hardcore scene for ages but hadn&#x27;t been used for other things. The first time it really happened was on S.O. D&#x27;s &#x27;Milk&#x27; song, so I guess you could say I had a lot to do with it. Now a lot of bands are using it and doing it really well.&quot;

The album had some controversy due to the lyrics, which addressed homosexuality, women and foreign cultures. Dan Lilker stated, &quot;The lyrics were never intended to be serious, just to piss people off.&quot;

In an interview with Songfacts in 2014, when asked &quot;If &quot;Speak English or Die&quot; came out today, do you think that because of the political correctness of today, it would go over the same?&quot;, Lilker responded, &quot;It probably would have had a harder time just because people seem to be more uptight now. Nevertheless, it was what it was, which is saying it is what it is, but back then. And I don&#x27;t regret it. Maybe minor aspects went overboard with certain lyrical things, but then again, we didn&#x27;t really mean them. Perhaps if people realize that, then it&#x27;s just more funny.&quot;

==Reception==

&quot;Speak English or Die&quot; was well received and is considered one of the greatest and most influential crossover thrash albums of all time, according to sources such as Punk News and Ultimate Guitar. Allmusic gave the album 4.5 stars out of 5 and said, &quot;S.O.D.&#x27;s &quot;Speak English or Die&quot; was an important record in the fusion of hardcore punk with thrash and speed metal&quot;.

&quot;Speak English or Die&quot; has sold over one million copies worldwide.

==Legacy==
The album was re-released by Megaforce in August 1995 and a platinum edition of the album was released in February 2000.

In August 2014, &quot;Revolver&quot; placed &quot;Speak English or Die&quot; on its &quot;14 Thrash Albums You Need to Own&quot; list.

Al Jourgensen, frontman of industrial metal band Ministry, describes &quot;Speak English or Die&quot; as an influential album that inspired him to add thrash metal guitar riffs to his band&#x27;s music starting with 1989&#x27;s &quot;The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste&quot;. He adds that &quot;Speak English or Die&quot; is &quot;one of the best records ever.&quot; The group would later cover &quot;United Forces&quot; for their 2012 album &quot;Relapse&quot;.

Scott Ian once recalled that Eddie Vedder was a fan of the album as well, saying he &quot;cornered me one night at a party for 25 minutes telling me this story about the first time he heard &quot;Speak English Or Die&quot; and how it affected his life.&quot;

There were also plans for a &quot;Speak English or Die&quot; tribute album featuring multiple artists during the late &#x27;90s, but the release never materialized.

S.O.D. also played on June 8, 1999, at Club Citta, completing a three-night stint at the venue.

The bonus track &quot;Ram It Up&quot; added in reissues was an outtake from the original album sessions that had appeared already in 1985 on the Megaforce &quot;From the Megavault&quot; compilation. The song is a cover version taken from the &quot;Tod und Wahnsinn&quot; album (1983) of the German hardcore punk band Inferno.

<text>Manuel Méndez Ballester (4 August 1909 – 24 January 2002), was a Puerto Rican writer who also worked in journalism, radio broadcasting, television and teaching.

== Life and career ==
José Manuel Epifanio Méndez Ballester, better known as Manuel Méndez Ballester was born in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, in 1909 to parents Andrés Méndez Licíaga and Juana Ballester González. In Aguadilla, he was raised and received his primary education. Relocating to New York in his teens, he initiated secondary schooling, but upon his return to Puerto Rico, continued his studies on his own. While still in his adolescence, and due to economic urgency, he began to work as a clerk in several commercial houses of Aguadilla and San Juan. He later served in the offices of the District Court of Aguadilla. His next profession was as the Administrator of the Central Coloso sugar cane refinery, a task that allowed him first hand account of the social life, customs and problems of the sugar cane workers. This association and knowledge would prove of great value for the development of his literary role as a dramatist.

Méndez Ballester began to participate in and became fond of local theater productions, and by 1931, his journalistic ventures led him to be collaborator and then editor of &quot;Atalaya y Letras&quot;, a local cultural periodical in Aguadilla.

Méndez Ballester enrolled at the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus, seeking to become a lawyer, but before finalizing the first year of studies he dropped out to pursue a career in radio programming for the Department of Public Education. He returned to the university in 1935 as an evaluator and assessor of teachers for workers whom the Administration of Reconstruction of Puerto Rico sponsored.

&quot;Isla Cerrera,&quot; written in 1937, was his first novel, and was a historical view of the early days of Spanish colonization. &quot;El Clamor de Los Surcos&quot;, his first popular play in 1938, received high accolades by Ateneo Puertorriqueño. His classic tragedy in three acts, &quot;Tiempo Muerto&quot;, premiered in 1940. This is considered to be his masterpiece and the one most associated with Méndez Ballester. It is set in the sugar cane fields of Aguadilla and deals with the workers during the off season or &quot;dead time,&quot; thus the title.

In 1943, he organized la Sociedad General de Autores (General Society of Authors) with whom he presented two new drama works: &quot;Hilaricón&quot; in 1943, and &quot;Nuestros Días&quot; in 1944. He then developed a more comical than satirical style with his &quot;El Misterio del Castillo&quot; in 1946, &quot;Un Fantasma Desentito&quot; in 1950, the farce &quot;Es de Vidrios la Mujer&quot; in 1952, and &quot;El Curioso Impertinente.&quot; In 1958 he wrote &quot;Encrucijada&quot;, and &quot;El Milagro&quot; in 1961, followed by &quot;La Feria o El Mono con la Lata en el Rabo&quot; (1963). In 1965 he wrote &quot;Bienvenido Don Goyito&quot;, a popular play which is still revered today. In 1968 he published &quot;Arriba las Mujeres&quot;, in 1970, the dramatic piece &quot;La Invasión, ó Jugando al Divorcio&quot; and in 1975 back to comedy with &quot;Los Cocorocos&quot;.

Méndez Ballester was interested in politics and became a senator for the city of San Juan, and upon his retirement from politics dedicated himself to become Puerto Rico&#x27;s foremost dramatist and man of letters. He died on January 23, 2002, at Auxilio Mutuo Hospital in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico, at age 92. There was a solemn funeral in his parents&#x27; native town of San Sebastián, then a procession to Aguadilla, where there was a service at the Inter American University, where he had donated all his literary papers and historical documents to a library named in his honor.

===Luz Odilia Font===
Mendez Ballester is credited with discovering the talents of a young actress, his then neighbor in San Juan, the also San Sebastian native Luz Odilia Font.

<text>Don Juan DeMarco is a 1995 American romantic comedy-drama film starring Johnny Depp as John Arnold DeMarco, a man who believes himself to be Don Juan, the greatest lover in the world. Clad in a cape and domino mask, DeMarco undergoes psychiatric treatment with Marlon Brando&#x27;s character, Dr. Jack Mickler, to cure him of his apparent delusion. But the psychiatric sessions have an unexpected effect on the psychiatric staff, some of whom find themselves inspired by DeMarco&#x27;s delusion; the most profoundly affected is Dr. Mickler himself, who rekindles the romance in his complacent marriage.

The movie is based on two different sources; the modern-day story is based on director/screenwriter Jeremy Leven&#x27;s short story &quot;Don Juan DeMarco and the Centerfold&quot; (the movie&#x27;s original title before the studio changed it shortly before release), while the flashbacks depicting DeMarco&#x27;s back-story are based on the more familiar legend of Don Juan, especially as told by Lord Byron in his version of the legend.

Depp received the London Film Critics Circle Award for Actor of the Year, along with his performance in &quot;Ed Wood&quot;, while the film&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?&quot;, co-written and performed by Bryan Adams, was nominated for the Oscar, Grammy, and Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.

==Plot==
John Arnold DeMarco is a 21-year-old man who dresses like Zorro, with a similar mask, hat and cape, and claims to be Don Juan. After a passionate affair, he decides to commit suicide. At the site of the billboard he plans to jump off of, psychiatrist Jack Mickler dissuades him by posing as Don Octavio de Flores. John is then held for a ten-day review in a mental institution.

Mickler, who is about to retire, insists on doing the evaluation and conducts it without medicating the youth. Mickler listens to John&#x27;s story continuing to pose as Don Octavio: Don Juan was born in Mexico, he has an affair with his school tutor which ultimately leads to the death of his father in a swordfight. Mickler listens to the story while spotting inconsistencies, such as the Castilian nature of John&#x27;s accent, but continues to humor him.

At home, Mickler is living in a passionless marriage to his wife, Marilyn. As Mickler notices that John&#x27;s presence at the institution is having an impact on the staff – both distracting the women and dancing with a male attendant on the lawn – he finds himself being influenced, and starts listening to opera in his house and rekindling the passion with his wife.

Eventually Mickler meets with John&#x27;s grandmother, who tells him that John grew up in Phoenix, Arizona, and that his father died in a car crash. When Mickler returns to the institution and confronts his patient with this information, John dismisses his grandmother as misanthropic and of making the backstory up. In response Mickler recounts the story of an insecure young man who fell in love with a woman in a magazine, who then contacted her and was told she never wanted to speak to him again. When John asks what happened to the young man, Mickler tells him he tried to commit suicide.

As the ten days tick down, pressure mounts on Mickler to support the youth&#x27;s indefinite confinement, a decision which he is skeptical of. John has mentioned that his mother became a nun and remains in the convent to this day, and in a subsequent meeting with John, Mickler suggests that John&#x27;s mother could have possibly had affairs, to which John responds with violent anger.

John concludes his story, about how he was kept two years in a harem as the lover of the sultaness, before finding true love and being rejected on a remote Greek island by his one true love, Doña Ana. Mickler tells him at the story&#x27;s end that he believes John is Don Juan DeMarco, the greatest lover the world has ever known. When John asks Mickler who he is, he says &quot;I am Don Octavio de Flores&quot; and that John has seen through all of his masks.

At the end of the ten days, Mickler is able to convince John to take his medication, and makes him understand that not everyone believes he is Don Juan. Right before his retirement, Mickler and John meet with the board, with John in street clothes. He speaks with an American accent, and acknowledges that he was born in Queens, his father was killed in an accident, and that his mother was unfaithful to his father. John is released and accompanies Mickler, along with the doctor&#x27;s wife, to the remote island that Don Juan has described where he met his true love.

Selena also makes a brief appearance as a singer; this was her first and only film appearance before her death on March 31, 1995.

==Music==
The film features the original Bryan Adams song, &quot;Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?&quot;; the lyrics incorporate quotes from Depp&#x27;s character, and the melody is used as a musical motif throughout the film. In addition, the song itself is performed three times, once by Selena and a mariachi band serenading the characters in Spanish, once by Jose Hernandez and Nydia, as background music (again in Spanish), and once by Bryan Adams during the closing credits. The song is also available on the soundtrack. The song was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song at the 68th Academy Awards, but lost to &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot; from &quot;Pocahontas&quot;.

Selena recorded other songs for the soundtrack, including &quot;El Toro Relajo&quot;. The score was composed, orchestrated, and conducted by Michael Kamen and was performed by the London Metropolitan Orchestra.

Tori Amos and Michael Stipe recorded a duet for the film called &quot;It Might Hurt a Bit&quot; but it remains unreleased.

==Release==

=== Box office ===
A cut of the film was screened for investors in October 1994, before being released in April 1995.

The film had an estimated budget of $25 million, grossing just $22,150,451 in the U.S. With a total $68,592,731 gross worldwide, it was considered a success for New Line Cinema. Upon its opening weekend, &quot;Don Juan DeMarco&quot; opened at #4 with $4,556,274 behind the openings of &quot;Bad Boys&quot; and &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot;, and the second weekend of &quot;Tommy Boy&quot;.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 72% based on reviews from 39 critics, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The site&#x27;s consensus was &quot;&quot;Don Juan DeMarco&quot; proves that a slight story can translate to entertaining cinema if it&#x27;s acted out by a pair of well-matched professionals enjoying their craft.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 63 out of 100 based on reviews from 19 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;A−&quot; on scale of A+ to F.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;It benefits not only from Mr. Brando&#x27;s peculiar presence, but also from Johnny Depp, who again proves himself a brilliantly intuitive young actor with strong ties to the Brando legacy. The movie is cheesy, but its stars certainly are not.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 2 out of 4, and wrote &quot;Brando doesn&#x27;t so much walk through this movie as coast, in a gassy, self-indulgent performance no one else could have gotten away with.&quot;

*Breakthrough – A publication that changed scientific knowledge significantly
*Influence – A publication which has significantly influenced the world or has had a massive impact on the teaching of statistics.

==Probability==
;&quot;Théorie analytique des probabilités&quot;
:Author: Pierre-Simon Laplace
:Publication data: 1820 (3rd ed.)
:Online version: Internet Archive; CNRS, with more accurate character recognition; Gallica-Math, complete PDF and PDFs by section
:Description: Introduced the Laplace transform, exponential families, and conjugate priors in Bayesian statistics. Pioneering asymptotic statistics, proved an early version of the Bernstein–von Mises theorem on the irrelevance of the (regular) prior distribution on the limiting posterior distribution, highlighting the asymptotic role of the Fisher information. Studies the influence of median and skewness in regression analysis. Inspired the field of robust regression, proposed the Laplace distribution and was the first to provide alternatives to Carl Friedrich Gauss&#x27;s work on statistics.
:Importance: Topic creator, Breakthrough, Influence

==Mathematical statistics==
Mathematical Methods of Statistics
:Author: Harald Cramér
:Publication data: Princeton Mathematical Series, vol. 9. Princeton University Press, Princeton, N. J., 1946. xvi+575 pp. (A first version was published by Almqvist &amp; Wiksell in Uppsala, Sweden, but had little circulation because of World War II.)
:Description: Carefully written and extensive account of measure-theoretic probability for statisticians, along with careful mathematical treatment of classical statistics.
:Importance: Made measure-theoretic probability the standard language for advanced statistics in the English-speaking world, following its earlier adoption in France and the USSR.

Statistical Decision Functions
:Author: Abraham Wald
:Publication data: 1950. John Wiley &amp; Sons.
:Description: Exposition of statistical decision theory as a foundations of statistics. Included earlier results of Wald on sequential analysis and the sequential probability ratio test and on Wald&#x27;s complete class theorem characterizing admissible decision rules as limits of Bayesian procedures.
:Importance: Raised the mathematical status of statistical theory and attracted mathematical statisticians like John von Neumann, Aryeh Dvoretzky, Jacob Wolfowitz, Jack C. Kiefer, and David Blackwell, providing greater ties with economic theory and operations research. Spurred further work on decision theory.

Testing Statistical Hypotheses
:Author: Erich Leo Lehmann
:Publication data: 1959. John Wiley &amp; Sons.
:Description: Exposition of statistical hypothesis testing using the statistical decision theory of Abraham Wald, with some use of measure-theoretic probability.
:Importance: Made Wald&#x27;s ideas accessible. Collected and organized many results of statistical theory that were scattered throughout journal articles, civilizing statistics.

==Bayesian statistics==
An Essay Towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances
:Author: Thomas Bayes
:Publication data: 1763-12-23
:Online version: 
:Description: In this paper Bayes addresses the problem of using a sequence of identical &quot;trials&quot; to determine the per-trial probability of &quot;success&quot; – the so-called &quot;inverse probability&quot; problem. It later inspired the theorem that bears his name (Bayes&#x27; theorem). See also Pierre Simon de Laplace.
:Importance: Topic creator, Breakthrough, Influence

On Small Differences in Sensation
:Author: Charles Sanders Peirce and Joseph Jastrow
:Publication data: 
:Online version: http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Peirce/small-diffs.htm
:Description: Peirce and Jastrow use logistic regression to estimate subjective probabilities of subjects&#x27;s judgments of the heavier of two measurements, following a randomized controlled repeated measures design.
:Importance: Pioneered elicitation of subjective probabilities.

Truth and Probability

:Description: Early exposition of the general linear model using matrix algebra (following lecture notes of George W. Brown). Bases inference on the randomization distribution objectively defined by the experimental protocol, rather than a so-called &quot;statistical model&quot; expressing the subjective beliefs of a statistician: The normal model is regarded as a convenient approximation to the randomization-distribution, whose quality is assessed by theorems about moments and simulation experiments.
:Importance: The first and most extensive discussion of randomation-based inference in the field of design of experiments until the recent 2-volume work by Hinkelmann and Kempthorne; randomization-based inference is called &quot;design-based&quot; inference in survey sampling of finite populations. Introduced the &quot;treatment-unit additivity&quot; hypothesis, which was discussed in chapter 2 of David R. Cox&#x27;s book on experiments (1958) and which has influenced Donald Rubin and Paul Rosenbaum&#x27;s analysis of observational data.

<text>Jason Michael Lee (born April 25, 1970) is an American actor, filmmaker, photographer and former professional skateboarder. He is known for playing Earl Hickey in the television comedy series &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot;, for which he was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy in 2005 and 2006. He is also known for his roles in Kevin Smith films such as &quot;Mallrats&quot; (1995), &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; (1997), &quot;Dogma&quot; (1999), &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot; (2001), &quot;Jersey Girl&quot; (2004), &quot;Clerks II&quot; (2006), &quot;Cop Out&quot; (2010), and &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Reboot&quot; (2019). Lee won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male for his performance in &quot;Chasing Amy&quot;.

His other notable film roles include starring in &quot;Mumford&quot; (1999), &quot;Almost Famous&quot; (2000), &quot;Heartbreakers&quot; (2001), &quot;Big Trouble&quot; (2002), &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; (2003) and &quot;Columbus Circle&quot; (2011). His voice acting credits include Syndrome in &quot;The Incredibles&quot; (2004), Bones in &quot;Monster House&quot; (2006) and the title character in &quot;Underdog&quot; (2007). Lee starred as Dave Seville in the live-action/animation &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot; films (2007–2015).

A former professional skateboarder, Lee is the co-founder and co-owner of Stereo Skateboards, founding the company in 1992 with fellow skateboarder Chris &quot;Dune&quot; Pastras. Since 1992, Stereo manufactures and distributes skateboard decks, equipment and apparel, as well as producing skate videos.

==Early life==
Lee was born in Santa Ana, California, on April 25, 1970. His father, Greg Lee, was a car dealership manager and his mother, Carol Lee, was a homemaker. He has an older brother, James (b. 1968). Lee was raised in Huntington Beach and attended Ocean View High School. A hyperactive and energetic child, Lee took up skateboarding after his mother bought him a skateboard with the hope that he would use it to burn off excessive energy. As he developed an interest on the art of skateboarding, Lee spent the majority of his time perfecting his craft, which would eventually lead to him dropping out of school in order to pursue a professional career.

==Career==
===Skateboarding===
Lee was a professional skateboarder in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1992, he founded Stereo Sound Agency, known as Stereo Skateboards, with fellow skater Chris &quot;Dune&quot; Pastras. In 2003, after it had been defunct for a few years, the pair successfully revived the company. As of October 2013, Lee and Pastras remained on the professional &quot;Classics&quot; team roster.

Lee was featured in the skateboarding promotional video, &quot;Video Days&quot; (1991), filmed for the skateboarding company Blind Skateboards. In 2004, Lee&#x27;s skateboarding was featured in &quot;Way Out East!&quot;, a film produced by Stereo Skateboards.

In August 2012, Lee was also featured in a brief video on the skateboard website The Berrics entitled &quot;Jason Lee decided to come to the park.&quot;

In August 2012, Lee participated in the ninth annual Stand-Up for Skateparks Event, which he chaired with Tony Hawk. The event is held annually by the Tony Hawk Charitable Foundation and seeks to &quot;help create free, quality public skateparks for youth in low-income communities.&quot;

In October that same year, a video was released by the Keep A Breast Foundation, featuring various skateboarding identities, including Lee, together with Pastras. The video, contributing to the Foundation&#x27;s aim to prevent and raise awareness of breast cancer, promotes the &quot;I Love Boobies&quot; bracelet. It also features Clint Peterson (Stereo) and Giovanni Reda (WESC), who are both teammates of Lee.

Lee later worked with Tony Hawk when he lent his voice and likeness to &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Project 8&quot; (2006) to become a playable character. Lee then voiced Coach Frank, a character created during the development of Stereo, in the video game &quot;Skate 3&quot; (2010).

Professional skateboarder and owner of the Girl and Lakai Limited Footwear skateboard brands Mike Carroll has cited Lee as one of his skating influences.

Lee has been particularly cited for his 360 flips, which even the trick&#x27;s inventor, Rodney Mullen, credits him with stylizing and popularizing.

===Acting===
After taking some minor acting roles in 1992–1994 (including the music video for the Sonic Youth single &quot;100%&quot;, a small part in &quot;Mi Vida Loca&quot;, and a bit part as a dance instructor on &quot;Chance and Things&quot;), Lee left professional skateboarding for a full-time acting career. His first major film role was in Kevin Smith&#x27;s &quot;Mallrats&quot;, which became a cult hit. This started a friendship that subsequently led to appearances in many of Smith&#x27;s films, including &quot;Chasing Amy&quot;, &quot;Dogma&quot;, &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;, &quot;Clerks II&quot;, &quot;Cop Out&quot;, and &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Reboot&quot;. Lee won an Independent Spirit Award for his role in &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; as Banky Edwards.
Lee graduated to leading man roles in &quot;Heartbreakers&quot;, &quot;Stealing Harvard&quot;, and &quot;A Guy Thing&quot;. He has had supporting roles in &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot;, &quot;Almost Famous&quot;, &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot;, &quot;Big Trouble&quot;, &quot;The Ballad of Jack and Rose&quot;, and &quot;Mumford&quot;, as well as a minor role in &quot;Enemy of the State&quot;. Lee also voiced Syndrome in &quot;The Incredibles&quot; and &quot;Jack-Jack Attack&quot;. He reprised the role as a &quot;robot copy&quot; of Syndrome in &quot;Disney Presents Pixar&#x27;s The Incredibles in a Magic Kingdom Adventure&quot;. Lee is also the voice of Underdog in &quot;Underdog&quot; and portrays Dave Seville in the live-action/CGI films starring Alvin and the Chipmunks.

In 2005, Lee was offered the lead role in the television series &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot;. According to interviews on the first-season DVD, he passed on the series twice before finally agreeing to read for the pilot. In the series he stars as Earl Hickey. Lee received two Golden Globe nominations for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy in 2006 and 2007, as well as a nomination for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series in 2006. NBC cancelled &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot; after four seasons.

On June 22, 2010, &quot;Memphis Beat&quot; premiered. Lee stars alongside Alfre Woodard and portrays Dwight Hendricks. In October 2011, it was announced the series was not renewed for a third season. He guest-starred in 2010 and 2013 episodes of &quot;Raising Hope&quot;, created by &quot;My Name is Earl&quot; creator and producer Greg Garcia.

As of December 2011, Lee appeared in &quot;Up All Night&quot;, but after its second season, it was officially cancelled on May 9, 2013. In June 2013, &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip (2015)&quot;, a fourth and final film in the &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot; franchise, was announced by 20th Century Fox; its release date was December 18, 2015.

Lee is in the Amazon Studios 49-minute pilot of &quot;Cocked&quot;, where he plays the character of Grady Paxson, one of three men who run a family company, manufacturing guns. The show premiered on January 15, 2015, and also stars Brian Dennehy, Diora Baird, Dreama Walker, and Sam Trammell. On January 25, 2015, The Hallmark Channel premiered &quot;Away &amp; Back&quot;, a Hallmark Hall of Fame film starring Lee, Maggie Elizabeth Jones and Minka Kelly.

===Photography===
Lee began shooting photos regularly in the early 2000s, and became interested in instant photography. He released his first photo book through &quot;Refueled Magazine&quot;. It consists of &quot;184 pages of Polaroid &amp; Fuji Instant Film photographs from 2006-2016&quot;, printed in an edition of 500 copies. In 2018 he published &quot;A Plain View,&quot; a photo book consisting of color 4×5 photographs from his exploration of rural and urban America. From June to December 2019, his photographs of Oklahoma were exhibited in exhibit &quot;OK: Jason Lee Photographs&quot; in Philbrook Museum of Art. These works are scheduled to be released as the book &quot;OK&quot; in 2022. In December 2020, British publishing house Stanley/Barker released &quot;In the Gold Dust Rush&quot;, consisting of black and white photographs of rural America. In 2021, Lee released &quot;Galveston,&quot; commissioned by the Galveston Historical Foundation. He is inspired by work of New Topographics movement, notably by Henry Wessell. He photographs on film.

==Personal life==
Lee married actress and photographer Carmen Llywelyn in 1995. They divorced in 2001. Llywelyn later said that his commitment to Scientology was the principal cause for their separation. Llywelyn wrote that their relationship collapsed when she revealed to her talent manager and fellow Scientologist, Gay Ribisi (mother of actor Giovanni Ribisi and actress Marissa Ribisi), that she had read &quot;A Piece of Blue Sky&quot;, a book about the reality of Scientology. Two days after her conversation with Ribisi, Llywelyn received a one-paragraph &quot;disconnection letter&quot; from Lee and was labeled a suppressive person.

Following his divorce from Llywelyn, Lee became engaged to actress Beth Riesgraf. Together, they have a son, Pilot Inspektor, born in 2003. Lee states their son&#x27;s name was inspired by &quot;He&#x27;s Simple, He&#x27;s Dumb, He&#x27;s the Pilot.&quot; by rock band Grandaddy.

Lee married Turkish model Ceren Alkaç in California in July 2008. A month later, Alkaç gave birth to a daughter named Casper. The couple had their second child, a son named Sonny, in 2012. Their third child, a daughter named Alberta &#x27;Birdy&#x27; Lee, was born in 2017.

In 2016, Lee revealed that he is no longer a Scientologist. When asked by &quot;The Guardian&quot; why he became a Scientologist he said, &quot;Everybody wants answers, everybody wants to feel less depressed or less anxious or they want to try to understand some issue that they might have with themselves.&quot; He added: &quot;Ultimately, it was just not for me. That&#x27;s it. I wasn&#x27;t really involved going back many, many years now.&quot;

Lee currently resides in Los Angeles, California with his family after living in Denton, Texas for four years. He is a 1/5th co-owner of the restaurant &quot;Barley and Board&quot;.

<doc id="708898" wikidata="Q236621" url="?curid=708898" title="Kristin Halvorsen">
<text>Kristin Halvorsen (born 2 September 1960) is a Norwegian politician of the Socialist Left Party. She served as Minister of Finance from 2005 to 2009 and as Minister of Education from 2009 to 2013. She also served as the party&#x27;s leader from 1997 to 2012 and a member of parliament representing Oslo, from 1989 to 2013.

Taking over as leader of the Socialist Left Party in 1997, she established an unprecedented level of consensus within the party. At the 2005 election, the party received a disappointing 8.8% share of the vote, and in 2009 down further, to 6.2%. She stepped down as leader in 2012, and was succeeded by Audun Lysbakken on 11 March.

The Socialist Left, in coalition with the Labour Party and the Centre Party, won Norway&#x27;s September 2005 parliamentary elections. The resulting Red-Green coalition government marked the first time that the Socialist Left Party was included in the cabinet. Halvorsen took office as Minister of Finance, becoming the first woman to hold the position.

==Background==
Halvorsen was born in Horten, Vestfold. After taking university courses in pedagogy (1.5 years) and criminology (1 year) without receiving a degree, Halvorsen worked for a while as a legal secretary. She served as a vice member to the Parliament from 1985, and was elected member of Parliament in 1989, representing the county of Oslo, a seat she has held ever since. She has been a member of the parliamentary standing Committee on Finance (1989–1997) and the Committee on Scrutiny and Constitutional Affairs (1997–2001). She is presently a member of the Election Committee and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and Chairman of the Socialist Left Party&#x27;s parliamentary group, but is on leave from these positions while sitting in government.

Halvorsen was the first Norwegian party leader to launch a blog.

== Personal life ==
Kristin Halvorsen&#x27;s parents are Leif Georg Halvorsen, a civil engineer, and Marit Larsen, a teacher. Kristin is married to Charlo Halvorsen, an editor at Norsk Rikskringkasting.

==Controversies==
===Kindergarten coverage promise===
In the electoral campaign of the 2005 election Halvorsen announced that she would leave politics if the government would not be able to provide all citizens with kindergarten for their children by the end of 2007, and proclaimed that &quot;this is so important for me that you&#x27;ll get rid of me if we don&#x27;t accomplish this&quot;. While she stood firmly by her announcement even two months after the election, she in October 2006 simply withdrew her promise, stating that &quot;what I have said is that we&#x27;ll have full coverage in 2007. But nobody will get rid of me if full coverage is missing in one or two municipalities&quot;. By the end of 2007, 90 percent of municipalities will be able to offer kindergarten for all applicants, with the not fully covered constituting approximately 43 municipalities in Norway.

===Poverty resolved &quot;with the stroke of a pen&quot; claim===
In the same electoral campaign she claimed that poverty in Norway could be eliminated &quot;with the stroke of a pen&quot;. After being elected to government and becoming Minister of Finance, by the end of the four-year term she had not accomplished this, as homelessness was actually increasing. When attending a television program during the 2009 electoral campaign, she also refused to apologise to the poor in Norway for her failure.

===Israel boycott===
On 5 January 2006, Halvorsen caused a controversy by calling for boycott of Israeli products as a sign of solidarity with the Palestinians. The government and the other parties in the coalition distanced themselves from these remarks, and Halvorsen later apologized as foreign matters were outside her government position.

In January 2009, Halvorsen took part in anti-Israel protests which erupted into violent riots.

<text>Jason Benedict Lee (born 9 May 1971) is an English football manager and former player.

Lee played as a forward, most notably in the Premier League for Nottingham Forest where he featured over three seasons, one of which saw him play in the UEFA Cup. He also had a brief spell in the Scottish First Division with Falkirk, but played the bulk of his professional career in the Football League with Charlton Athletic, Stockport County, Lincoln City, Southend United, Grimsby Town, Watford, Chesterfield, Peterborough United, Boston United, Northampton Town, Notts County and Mansfield Town. He later had spells in non-league football with Kettering Town, Corby Town, Ilkeston Town and Arnold Town

In 2011 he returned to Boston United and was appointed as manager initially alongside Lee Canoville, although he later took up the role on a sole basis before being dismissed in 2012.

==Playing career==
Lee began his career at Charlton Athletic but having failed to establish himself in the side moved to Lincoln City in 1991 before later moving to Southend United.

He moved to Nottingham Forest in 1994. Initially, Lee failed to crack his way into Forest&#x27;s first team. However, the departure of Stan Collymore to Liverpool saw him feature for the first team. In the 1995–96 season he scored eight league goals in 28 games.

Following two loan spells, back at his first club Charlton and at Grimsby Town, Lee was transferred to Watford in 1997 for £200,000 – the same fee paid by Forest three years earlier – and played in their 1997–98 Second Division championship-winning side, scoring ten goals. However, Lee&#x27;s refusal to uproot his family from Nottingham caused tension with manager Graham Taylor, who sold him to Chesterfield early in the 1998–99 season for £250,000.

After that, he played for Peterborough United (2000–2003), Falkirk (2003–2004), Boston United (2004–2006). In January 2006, Lee joined Northampton Town on a free transfer. He was part of the Northampton side that won promotion from League Two, appearing 11 times for the Cobblers and scoring one goal against Notts County. However, he was released at the end of the season and subsequently joined Aldershot Town. His stay at the Shots was a brief one, and in June 2006 he moved to Notts County, and was team captain for the 2007–08 season. It was announced on BBC East Midlands Today, during a feature presented by the player, that he would not be retained by the club for the 2008–09 campaign.

Following his release from the Magpies, signed for Mansfield Town on 1 August 2008.

Lee signed for Kettering Town on 13 January 2009, for the remainder of the 2008–09 season from Mansfield Town. Lee scored once in six league games for Kettering, his strike coming in a 2–1 loss to Stevenage on 27 January 2009.

He moved on to Corby Town, making his debut in a 3–3 draw against Farnborough on 21 March 2009.

He joined Ilkeston Town of the Conference North on 1 April 2010, scoring on his début in a 2–1 victory over AFC Telford United.

After a long and wide-ranging career Lee announced his retirement from football in November 2010 following the death of his mother.

Lee came out of retirement in March 2011 when he joined Arnold Town, debuting in the club&#x27;s Northern Counties East League 1–0 defeat at Hallam on 8 March 2011. The same week he was announced as the Matchday VIP Host for former club Lincoln City, a role which would limit his availability for Arnold. His second, and final, league appearance for the club saw him sent-off for two yellow cards, the second for the use of the elbow, in the 4–2 defeat to Pickering Town on 19 March 2011.

==Managerial career==
On 22 March 2011, Lee, along with Lee Canoville was confirmed as caretaker coach of Boston United following the resignation of joint first team managers Rob Scott and Paul Hurst. Lee re-registered himself as a player towards the end of the 2010–11 season. He made three appearances, including the final of the Lincolnshire Senior Shield and one Conference North playoff-game. Jason Lee was sacked as manager in December 2012 after a run of poor results in the 2012/13 season leaving the Pilgrims in 10th place.

== Football administration ==
In 2013 Lee became the EqualitiEducation Executive for the Professional Footballers Association (PFA).

==In popular culture==
Lee was frequently mocked by comedians Frank Skinner and David Baddiel in the 1990s football comedy TV show &quot;Fantasy Football League&quot;. In a series of sketches, Lee was lampooned for his perceived poor footballing ability and his distinctive hairstyle, described as resembling a &quot;pineapple&quot;. When asked what he made of Baddiel performing in blackface, Lee said: &quot;I&#x27;d ask them if they realised the significance of what they were doing. It was, looking back, a form of bullying. I work in equalities now, and it can affect different people in different ways. I don&#x27;t think people appreciate the possible harm it can cause. Not everyone has the make-up to deal with that, and they shouldn&#x27;t have to.&quot; In a 2022 interview, Skinner said their behaviour had been unacceptable: &quot;Looking back, it was a bullying campaign. And it&#x27;s awful. And yeah, I&#x27;m ashamed of it ... It wouldn&#x27;t be too much to say we&#x27;re both deeply ashamed.&quot; David Baddiel featured on Lee&#x27;s podcast, during which he apologised unreservedly for what Baddiel termed racist behaviour. The interview is the most successful on the &#x27;absoluteleepodcast&#x27; podcast, earning 59,000 views on YouTube (Jan 2024 data).

<text>Aeonium, the tree houseleeks, is a genus of about 35 species of succulent, subtropical plants of the family Crassulaceae. Many species are popular in horticulture. The genus name comes from the ancient Greek αἰώνιος / aiōnios (ageless). While most of them are native to the Canary Islands, some are found in Madeira, Cape Verde, Morocco, in East Africa (Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya) and Yemen.

==Description==
The succulent leaves are typically arranged on a basal stem, in a dense, spreading rosette. A feature which distinguishes this genus from many of its relatives is the manner in which the flowers bear free petals, and are divided into 6 or 12 sections. Each rosette produces a central inflorescence only once, and then dies back (though it will usually branch or offset to produce ensuing rosettes).

Low-growing &quot;Aeonium&quot; species are &quot;A. tabuliforme&quot; and &quot;A. smithii&quot;; large species include &quot;A. arboreum and&quot; &quot;A. valverdense&quot;. They are related to the genera &quot;Sempervivum&quot;, &quot;Aichryson&quot; and &quot;Monanthes&quot;, as can be seen by their similar flower and inflorescences. Recently, the genus &quot;Greenovia&quot; has been placed within &quot;Aeonium&quot;.

== Species and distribution ==
All but two species are native to at least one of three different Macaronesian archipelagos (the Canary Islands, Madeira, or Cape Verde) Most aeoniums are from the Canary Islands, The only species not native to these three Macaronesian island groups (&quot;Aeonium stuessyi&quot; and &quot;Aeonium&quot; &quot;leucoblepharum&quot;) are found in Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania; and Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, Uganda and Yemen, respectively. &quot;Aeonium arboreum&quot; is native to both the Canary Islands and Morocco.

Species accepted by Plants of the World Online as of April 2023: 
== Hybrids ==
Much hybridising has been done, resulting in several cultivars of mixed or unknown parentage. The following species and cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:-

*&quot;Aeonium tabuliforme&quot; 
*&quot;Aeonium haworthii&quot; 
*&quot;Aeonium haworthii&quot; &#x27;Variegatum&#x27; 
*&quot;Aeonium&quot; &#x27;Blushing Beauty&#x27; 
*&quot;Aeonium&quot; &#x27;Sunburst&#x27; 
*&quot;Aeonium&quot; &#x27;Zwartkop&#x27;
Hybridising between Aeonium species or cultivars and other Crassulaeceae species or cultivars has produced intergeneric crosses:

* x &quot;Semponium &quot;&#x27;Sienna&#x27; (&quot;Sempervivum&quot; &#x27;Green Ice&#x27; x &quot;Aeonium&quot; &#x27;Ice Warrior&#x27;).
* &quot;x Semponium&quot; &#x27;Destiny&#x27; - winner of the Royal Horticultural Society Chelsea Flower Show &#x27;Chelsea Plant of the Year 2022&#x27; award.

Some species have been introduced in California.

UK national collections of aeoniums are held by Mellie Lewis at Clun in Shropshire and by Inverewe at Poolewe, Wester Ross in Scotland.

<text>Old San Juan () is a historic district located at the &quot;northwest triangle&quot; of the islet of San Juan in San Juan. Its area roughly correlates to the Ballajá, Catedral, Marina, Mercado, San Cristóbal, and San Francisco sub-barrios (sub-districts) of barrio San Juan Antiguo in the municipality of San Juan, Puerto Rico. 

Old San Juan is the oldest settlement within Puerto Rico and the historic colonial district of the city of San Juan. This historic district is a Puerto Rico Registered Historic Zone and a National Historic Landmark District, Old San Juan Historic District, and is also listed on the United States National Register of Historic Places. Several historical buildings and structures, particularly La Fortaleza, the city walls, and El Morro and San Cristóbal castles, have been inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage Site list since 1983.

Historically the mixed-use commercial and residential real estate in the main street&quot;s&quot; of &quot;Calle Cristo&quot; and &quot;Calle Fortaleza&quot; from &quot;Calle Tanca&quot; to the Governor’s Mansion is the most valuable in the area and it has kept its value and increased steadily through several years despite the past economic turmoil.

==Location==
Old San Juan is located on a small and narrow island which lies along the north coast, about from the east end of Puerto Rico, and is connected to the mainland of Puerto Rico by three bridges. It is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and to the south by San Juan Bay (&quot;Bahia de San Juan&quot;)—which lies between the city and the mainland. On a promontory (&quot;morro&quot;) about high, at the west end of the island and commanding the entrance to the harbor, rise the battlements of Fort San Felipe del Morro, and its lighthouse.

The San Antonio Channel (&quot;Caño de San Antonio&quot;) lies to the southeast, where the island of Old San Juan connects to the mainland through Santurce, by three bridges: Dos Hermanos (Ashford Avenue), G. Esteves (Ponce de León Avenue) and San Antonio (Fernández Juncos Avenue).

The city is characterized by its narrow, blue cobblestone streets, and flat-roofed brick and stone buildings, which date back to the 16th and 17th centuries—when Puerto Rico was a Spanish possession. Near Fort San Felipe del Morro, is the Casa Blanca, a palace built on land which belonged to the family of Ponce de León.

==History==
===Origins===
In 1508, Juan Ponce de León founded the original settlement, Caparra (named after the Province of Cáceres, Spain, birthplace of the then-governor of Spain&#x27;s Caribbean territories, Nicolás de Ovando). The ruins of Caparra are known as the Pueblo Viejo sector of Guaynabo, behind the almost land-locked harbor just to the west of the present San Juan metropolitan area. In 1509, the settlement was abandoned and moved to a site which was called at the time &quot;Puerto Rico&quot; (meaning &quot;rich port&quot; or &quot;good port&quot;), a name that evoked that of a similar geographical harbor in the island of Gran Canaria, Canary Islands. The official settlement of this new town was marked by the establishment of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Juan in 1511, the first Catholic diocese to be established in the Americas, and by the construction of the first wooden iteration of its cathedral in 1513 together with the establishment of a Latin school by bishop Alonso Manso.

In 1521, this new settlement was given its formal name of &quot;Ciudad de Puerto Rico de San Juan Bautista&quot;, following the custom of christening the primary settlement of an island colony with both its formal town name and the name given by Christopher Columbus to the island, honoring John the Baptist. The settlement was also platted this same year, with many of its first streets and plazas being built at the time, such Calle del Cristo, Plaza de Armas and Plaza de la Catedral. Also constructed in 1521, Casa Blanca served as the first fortification of the settlement and residence of Juan Ponce de León and his descendants until the mid-eighteenth century.

===Expansion and growth===
Some of the first European establishment in the Western Hemisphere were also established in Old San Juan during the mid and second half of the16th century. Some of these include the Thomas Aquinas Convent (today the National Gallery of Puerto Rico) in 1523, Nuestra Señora de la Concepción Hospital in 1524, and the former Gothic stone cathedral building. 

The strategic position of Old San Juan in the context of the Caribbean and the Atlantic Ocean also made it a target for foreign attacks, which motivated the erection of a city wall between 1530 and 1560. Several fortresses and castles were also build during this time: La Fortaleza was built between 1533 and 1540, followed by the construction of the first battery at El Morro. Plans for the castle portion of San Felipe del Morro were made in 1584. Extensions, plus construction of El Cañuelo and El Boquerón forts, were made between 1599 and 1609. Complete circumvallation of the city was finally completed in 1641. Although several fortresses were built at the site during the time, it was not until 1771 when San Cristobal, the largest of the fortresses, was completed.

By 1776, the population totaled 6000, half of which were soldiers. The garrison town of San Juan included 250 acres of military installations and 62 acres of public and private use. By 1781, the city&#x27;s fortifications included 376 cannon. By 1876, 24,000 lived inside the walls of San Juan, encompassing 62 acres, and 926 buildings.

Prior to the 19th century, the area outside the city walls occupying the east side of Old San Juan Island, was almost uninhabited. In 1838 the so-called area of Puerta de Tierra had a population of 168 residents, mainly of African descent. According to a census made in 1846, the population had risen to 223 inhabitants living in 58 houses. On March 3, 1865, the municipal government of San Juan approved a resolution promoting the city expansion across the Puerta de Tierra which included the plan for demolishing the city walls along the eastern side. On May 28, 1897, the wall demolition was officially started after a proclamation was issued by Queen Maria Christina. By the year 1899, the population of Puerta de Tierra had risen to 5,453; while the area comprising the old walled city had a civilian population of roughly 18,103 inhabitants.

===Maintaining architectural integrity===
During the late 1940s, disrepair in the old city was evident. The local authorities were considering development proposals for renovating the old city and incorporating modern architecture on new constructions. Anthropologist Ricardo Alegría vehemently advised against the idea of demolishing old colonial buildings in favor of contemporary building designs. He followed the example suggested by his father, a local civic leader who had successfully prevented the demolition of the &quot;Capilla del Cristo&quot; in favor of a traffic redesign. He advised mayor Rincón de Gautier in having local zoning laws changed to favor remodeling and the incorporation of Spanish colonial motifs in any new construction. This helped preserve the city&#x27;s architectural profile, and has been a key to San Juan&#x27;s current status as a tourist destination.

Luis Muñoz Marín, as a senator and later as governor of Puerto Rico, supported and implemented what became known as Operation Bootstrap, which included the development of the tourism industry. In 1948 the government invited one of the organizers of Colonial Williamsburg to lead its tourism development efforts. These efforts were further supported by the 1955 creation of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture (&quot;Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña&quot;) head by Alegría. He sought legal and administrative changes that would allow for major remodeling efforts to be successful. At the time, most real estate in Old San Juan had devalued under appraised values because the city was perceived as unsafe (particularly because of building disrepair and social ills such as prostitution) and not profitable for business (because of rent control statutes, as well as the reluctance of commercial banks to fund remodeling). Under combined efforts by the institute and the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico, &quot;model&quot; remodelings were made to show potential property owners how their renewed properties could look. Strict remodeling codes were implemented to prevent new constructions from affecting the common colonial Spanish architectural themes of the old city. As with other Operation Bootstrap projects, mainland corporate investors were lured in with tax breaks and other incentives. When a project proposal suggested that the old Carmelite Convent in San Juan be demolished to erect a new hotel, the Institute had the building declared a historic building, and asked that it be converted to a hotel in a renewed facility. As in other Operation Bootstrap projects, the Woolworth family was invited in 1957 to reconstruct the former convent (which had more recently been a low-rent apartment building and city garage) into the luxury &quot;Hotel El Convento&quot;. The Bank provided low interest loans to remodelers, and the government gave triple tax exemptions to commercial activities in the old city (they were exempted for a limited time, not only from property taxes and municipal taxes, but from income tax from activities generated in their properties as well). At least one retailer from the shopping district in Charlotte Amalie was given incentives to set up shop in the &quot;Calle del Cristo&quot; (the city&#x27;s red light district during the early 1940s) in order to persuade other retailers to follow suit and somehow &quot;clean up&quot; the district. Potential developers were offered sketches of their properties after a remodeling, as to suggest which architectural elements to improve or change. The paradigm to reconstruct and renovate the old city and revitalize it has been followed by other cities in Latin America, particularly Havana, Lima and Cartagena de Indias.

==Historic designations==

The San Juan National Historic Site () was established in 1949 to preserve historic fortifications in Old San Juan and the National Register of Historic Places listed it in 1966. Both that site and La Fortaleza (English: &quot;The Fortress&quot;) were then declared a single World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1983. 

In 1951, the broader area within the old city walls became the first listing of the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones as the &quot;Zona Antigua Histórica Casco de San Juan&quot; (English: Historic Old Town Area of San Juan). In 1972, the same area was recognized by the National Register of Historic Places as the San Juan Historic Zone (). In 2012, the National Register increased the boundaries and renamed the district to Old San Juan Historic District (). Old San Juan was then designated a National Historic Landmark District in 2013.

== Landmarks and attractions ==

=== La Fortaleza and the San Juan National Historic District sites ===
* San Cristóbal Castle (&quot;Castillo San Cristóbal&quot;), the largest fortification built by the Spanish in the Americas, which provided defense against both land-based and sea attacks by pirates and foreign powers during the colonial period.
* San Felipe del Morro Castle (&quot;Castillo San Felipe del Morro&quot;, or just &quot;El Morro&quot;), a 16th century citadel in the northwestern edge of the islet that provided defense against foreign and pirate attacks during the Spanish colonization, also the site of a historic lighthouse. 
* Santa Catalina Palace, popularly known as La Fortaleza (Spanish for &quot;the fortress&quot;), a former fortification and currently the official residence of the governor of Puerto Rico. It is the oldest executive residence in the Western Hemisphere.
* The San Juan City Walls surround Old San Juan and it gives the city one of its nicknames, &quot;La ciudad amurallada&quot; (&quot;the walled city&quot;). About 3/4 of the city walls remain intact but only one of the city gates remain in existence. San Juan is one of the six cities under United States jurisdiction that possessed defensive walls and it is the only US city that still preserves its colonial defensive wall system.

=== Plazas and squares ===
* Paseo de La Princesa (Spanish for &quot;promenade of the princess&quot;) is a famous promenade named after the former La Princesa Prison. It extends for a quarter of a mile and runs along the southern city wall of Old San Juan. It provides views of San Juan&#x27;s city walls and San Juan Bay, and it is a popular location that becomes very lively during festivals and other cultural celebrations. A boardwalk at the end of the promenade connects it to Puerta de San Juan (the San Juan City Gate), formerly known as Puerta de Agua (Spanish for &quot;water gate&quot;), the only remaining city gate.
* Plaza Colón (Spanish for &quot;Columbus square&quot; or &quot;plaza&quot;) is located in the eastern end of Old San Juan where the former eastern city walls used to be located. Originally named Santiago Square, the plaza is now a popular meeting place for locals and tourists as it is located next to famous landmarks such as the San Cristóbal castle and the Tapia Theater.
* Plaza de Armas is the main town square of San Juan where several administrative buildings such as the historic San Juan City Hall are located. A &quot;plaza de armas&quot; is a large square often found in Spanish-founded cities across the Americas and the Philippines that were originally intended for military parades, hence the name &quot;plaza de armas&quot; (literally &quot;arms&quot; or &quot;weapons square&quot;).
* Plaza de la Catedral (English: &quot;Cathedral Square&quot;), popularly known as Plazuela Las Monjas, is located south of Hotel El Convento and west of the main entrance to San Juan&#x27;s cathedral. 
* Plaza de San José (English: &quot;San José Squar&quot;e), formerly known as Plaza de Santo Domingo, is located next to San José Church. It is also a popular meeting place due to its location next to restaurants and other businesses important to Old San Juan&#x27;s nightlife. The statue of Ponce de León located in the center of the square is famous for being built from melted British cannons obtained after Sir Ralph Abercromby&#x27;s failed attempt to capture San Juan.
* Plaza del Quinto Centenario (English: Square of the Fifth Centenary) is a modern square built to commemorate the 500th year anniversary of San Juan and the European discovery of Puerto Rico and the Americas. The square is located next to the Ballajá Barracks and El Morro.
*Plazuela de la Rogativa is a small plaza located close to La Fortaleza that is famous for the bronze sculpture of &quot;La Rogativa&quot;. The sculpture, completed by New Zealand artist Lindsay Daen in 1971, portrays &quot;La Rogativa&quot; (Spanish for &quot;the pleading&quot;), from a legend that says that the British invasion led by Sir Abercromby was foiled thanks to a pleading procession led by the bishop of San Juan and a group of women carrying torches. The story states that the British mistook the procession for Spanish reinforcements.
*Parque de las Palomas (Spanish for &quot;park of the pigeons&quot;), despite its name is a public plaza rather than a park located at the end of &quot;Calle del Cristo&quot; next to the chapel of the same name. In addition to the wonderful views of San Juan and the bay that this space offers, the plaza is famous, specially among children, for the numerous pigeons that live there. There are vendors who sell bird food to feed the pigeons.

=== Churches and religious buildings ===
* San Juan Cathedral, officially the Metropolitan Cathedral Basilica of Saint John the Baptist (Spanish: &quot;Catedral Basílica Metropolitana de San Juan Bautista&quot;), the Catholic cathedral and one of the oldest buildings in Old San Juan. It is considered the oldest cathedral in the United States and the second oldest cathedral in the Americas (after the Santo Domingo Cathedral in the Dominican Republic). It contains various relics and tombs, including that of Juan Ponce de Leon.
* San José Church (&quot;Iglesia de San José&quot;) is one of the most important architectural landmarks of Old San Juan and the earliest surviving example of 16th century Spanish Gothic architecture in the Americas. The church was closed for renovation for many years and it reopened for visitors and religious services in 2021.
*Saint Francis of Assisi Church (&quot;Iglesia de San Francisco de Asís&quot;) is a Catholic parish church located in the San Francisco sub-barrio of Old San Juan. 
* Santa Ana Church (&quot;Iglesia de Santa Ana&quot;) is an often-missed historical 17th century church located on Tetuán Street.
* Santo Cristo de la Salud Chapel (&quot;Capilla del Santo Cristo de la Salud&quot;), popularly known as Capilla del Cristo, a small 18th century chapel which was saved from demolition in the 20th century that has become a famous landmark and cultural symbol of Puerto Rico and its folklore. The chapel also houses a small museum.

==Today==
With its abundance of shops, historic places, museums, open air cafés, restaurants, colorful homes, tree-shaded plazas, and its old beauty and architectural peculiarity, Old San Juan is a main spot for domestic and international tourism.

The district is characterized by numerous public plazas, which are filled with local shops that sell traditional craftwork, sculptures and typical musical instruments. Moreover, Old San Juan is known for its historical churches, such as San José Church and the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista, which contains the tomb of the Spanish explorer and first European to discover modern day Florida, Juan Ponce de León.

Tourists&#x27; main spot to visit at Old San Juan is Castillo San Felipe del Morro, a fort built by the Spaniards when settled on the Island. Besides the magnificent fort, tourists are drawn to La Perla, a colorful neighborhood outside of the historic city wall.

Old San Juan is one of the two &quot;barrios&quot;, in addition to Santurce, that made up the municipality of San Juan after 1864 and prior to 1951, in which the former independent municipality of Río Piedras was annexed.

==Blockhouses and subbarrios==

The oldest parts of the district of Old San Juan remain partly enclosed by massive walls. Several defensive structures and notable forts, such as the Fort San Felipe del Morro, Castle of San Cristóbal, and &quot;el Palacio de Santa Catalina&quot; (also known as La Fortaleza), acted as the primary defense of the settlement which has been subjected to numerous attacks. La Fortaleza continues to serve also as the executive mansion for the Governor of Puerto Rico. Many of the historic fortifications are part of San Juan National Historic Site. Old San Juan&#x27;s land area roughly correlates to the following subbarrios of barrio San Juan Antiguo: Ballajá, Catedral, Marina, Mercado, San Cristóbal, and San Francisco.

==Public transportation==
Old San Juan is the location for one of two transportation hubs serving Metropolitan San Juan. At one time, a free trolley provided limited service to Old San Juan seven days a week but is not available any longer. People get around the city on foot or by car. There have been plans to turn the historic district into a pedestrian-only zone, and to either rebuild the trolley system or build a new light-rail train system in the recent years.

== Popular culture ==
Old San Juan is the setting for films, books, song lyrics and music videos, including the following:

* Noel Estrada, a Puerto Rican composer, wrote the popular song &quot;En mi Viejo San Juan&quot; in 1943. The song has been recorded by over 1,000 times by artists around the world, including many Puerto Rican musicians such as Trio Vegabajeño, Danny Rivera, Marc Anthony, Luis Miguel, José Feliciano, among many others.
* &quot;The Rum Diary&quot;, a film starring Johnny Depp, based on Hunter S. Thompson&#x27;s novel of the same name was filmed in Old San Juan; the film is set in the 1960s.

<doc id="708910" wikidata="Q310636" url="?curid=708910" title="Aichryson">
<text>Aichryson is a genus of 16 species of succulent, subtropical plants, native to the Canary Islands, Azores, and Madeira.

The species of &quot;Aichryson&quot; are not frost-resistant. They are related to &quot;Sempervivum, Jovibarba, Greenovia, Aeonium&quot; and &quot;Monanthes&quot;, readily seen in their similar flowers.

The genus name comes from a contraction of the Greek &quot;aei&quot; (always) and &quot;chrysos&quot; (gold).

Several species are cultivated as ornamental plants. The hybrid cultivar &quot;Aichryson&quot; × &quot;aizoides&quot; var. &quot;domesticum&quot; &#x27;Variegatum&#x27; is a recipient of the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. 

==Taxonomy==
Recent phylogenetic studies of Crassulaceae indicate that &quot;Aichryson&quot; is closely related to &quot;Monanthes&quot; and &quot;Aeonium&quot; (both genera are also largely endemic to the Canary Islands). Two other genera of Crassulaceae that have many-parted (polymerous) flowers (&quot;Sempervivum&quot; and &quot;Jovibarba&quot;) are not closely related to the three Canary Island genera.

On the Canary Islands, the center of species diversity seems to be the island of La Palma.

Relationships within &quot;Aichryson&quot; were investigated by Fairfield et al. (2004) [&quot;Plant Systematics and Evolution&quot; 248: 71–83]. They found that the five subspecies of &quot;A. pachycaulon&quot; were not each other&#x27;s closest relatives (monophyletic) and additional species may need to be erected after additional study.

==Species==
16 species, and several naturally-occurring interspecies hybrids, are accepted.
* &quot;Aichryson × aizoides&quot; 
* &quot;Aichryson × azuajei&quot; 
* &quot;Aichryson bitumosum&quot; 
* &quot;Aichryson bollei&quot; 
* &quot;Aichryson × bramwellii&quot; 
* &quot;Aichryson brevipetalum&quot; 
* &quot;Aichryson × buchii&quot; 
* &quot;Aichryson × cumbrense&quot; 
* &quot;Aichryson dichotomum&quot; 
* &quot;Aichryson divaricatum&quot; 
* &quot;Aichryson dumosum&quot; 
* &quot;Aichryson laxum&quot; 
* &quot;Aichryson pachycaulon&quot; (five subspecies have been recognized)
* &quot;Aichryson palmense&quot; 
* &quot;Aichryson parlatorei&quot; 
* &quot;Aichryson porphyrogennetos&quot; 
* &quot;Aichryson × praegeri&quot; 
* &quot;Aichryson punctatum&quot; 
* &quot;Aichryson roseum&quot; 
* &quot;Aichryson santamariensis&quot; 
* &quot;Aichryson tortuosum&quot; – gouty houseleek
* &quot;Aichryson villosum&quot;

<doc id="708914" wikidata="Q140427" url="?curid=708914" title="Monanthes">
<text>Monanthes is a genus of small, succulent, subtropical plants of the family Crassulaceae. The about ten species are mostly endemic to the Canary Islands and Savage Islands, with some found on Madeira. Its center of diversity is Tenerife, with seven species occurring on this island. On Fuerteventura and Lanzarote, only &quot;M. laxiflora&quot; occurs.
&quot;Monanthes&quot; is a rare example where a species re-colonizes the continent from an island, after their ancestors have colonized the island from the continent.

&quot;Monanthes&quot; are not frost-resistant. They are linked with the genera &quot;Sempervivum&quot;, &quot;Greenovia&quot;, &quot;Aichryson&quot; and &quot;Aeonium&quot;, which is obvious from their similar flowers.

Species of &quot;Monanthes&quot; differ considerably in life- and growth-form. &quot;M. icterica&quot;, which is also genetically quite distant to other &quot;Monanthes&quot; species, is annual, while the other species are perennial.

==Taxonomy==
Accepted species include:
* &quot;Monanthes anagensis&quot; 
* &quot;Monanthes atlantica&quot; 
* &quot;Monanthes brachycaulos&quot; 
* &quot;Monanthes icterica&quot; 
* &quot;Monanthes laxiflora&quot; 
* &quot;Monanthes lowei&quot; 
* &quot;Monanthes minima&quot; 
* &quot;Monanthes muralis&quot; 
* &quot;Monanthes pallens&quot; 
* &quot;Monanthes polyphylla&quot; 
** &quot;Monanthes polyphylla&quot; subsp. &quot;amydros&quot; 
* &quot;Monanthes subcrassicaulis&quot; 
* &quot;Monanthes subrosulata&quot; 
* &quot;Monanthes tilophila&quot; 
* &quot;Monanthes wildpretii&quot; 

===Etymology===
&quot;Monanthes&quot; is Greek for &quot;single flower&quot;.

<text>Orthogastropoda was a major taxonomic grouping of snails and slugs, an extremely large subclass within the huge class Gastropoda according to the older taxonomy of the Gastropoda (Ponder &amp; Lindberg, 1997).

This taxon is no longer used according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet &amp; Rocroi, 2005.

Ponder and Lindberg (1997) in the book &quot;The Southern Synthesis&quot;, showed the Orthogastropoda as one of two subclasses of the Gastropoda, the other subclass being a very much smaller group called the Eogastropoda, which contained only 5 families of true limpets.

This subclass, Orthogastropoda, which one perhaps could call the &quot;true snails&quot;, was defined most concisely as all gastropods which were not members of Patellogastropoda, the true limpets.

The Orthogastropoda appeared to form a clade which was supported by unambiguous synapomorphies. These synapomorphies (a series of characteristics that appear in its members but not in the other forms it diverged from) were the identifying characteristics of the clade.

Some of the characteristics were:
*eyes with a vitreous body on eyestalks.
*paired jaws, with their position free from the buccal mass
*a single kidney on the right side of pericardium
*a flexoglossate radula (with a flexible radular membrane). The radula is the snail&#x27;s tongue, used as a rasping tool.
*unpaired osphradium (olfactory organ).
*lateral ciliated zones of osphradium
*a single left hypobranchial gland (on organ at gill, which releases secretions, such as the reddish dye Tyrian purple).
*an unpaired ctenidium (a comblike respiratory structure in certain mollusks)

<text>Constantine Falkland Cary Smythe MC (; February 1, 1895 – November 18, 1980) was a Canadian businessman, soldier and sportsman in ice hockey and horse racing. He is best known as the principal owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1927 to 1961 and as the builder of Maple Leaf Gardens. As owner of the Leafs during numerous championship years, his name appears on the Stanley Cup eight times: 1932, 1942, 1945, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1951 and 1962.

Smythe is also known for having served in both World Wars, organizing his own artillery battery in the Second World War. The horses of Smythe&#x27;s racing stable won the Queen&#x27;s Plate three times among 145 stakes race wins during his lifetime. Smythe started and ran a sand and gravel business.

==Early years==
Smythe was born on February 1, 1895, in Toronto to Albert Smythe, an Irish Protestant from County Antrim who immigrated to Canada in 1889, and Mary Adelaide Constantine, an English woman. Mary and Albert were married in the 1880s while immigrating to Canada, but their marriage was rocky and they did not live together for more than a few months at a time. Conn was the second of the couple&#x27;s two children; he had a sister, Mary, five years older, who died due to illness in 1903. Smythe remembered his mother Mary, who was known as Polly, as pretty, a drinker, and troublemaker, while Albert was quiet, a vegetarian, and a devoted member of Madame Blavatsky&#x27;s Theosophical movement. Albert Smythe was a charter member of the Theosophical Society of Canada in 1891, and edited its newsletter until the final years of his life.

Smythe&#x27;s first home was 51 McMillan Street, now known as Mutual Street, not far from the future site of Maple Leaf Gardens. The family was poor and moved several times during Smythe&#x27;s youth, the size of lodgings depending on Albert Smythe&#x27;s wages at the time. At one point, Albert and Conn moved to a house in Scarborough while Polly and Mary stayed on North Street. Mary died in 1906, and Smythe attributed his lifelong teetotalism to his mother&#x27;s drinking. At age eleven, Conn was christened, the occasion marking the first time that he insisted on the name &quot;Conn&quot; instead of his given name, Constantine. Albert and Conn became estranged after Albert began a new relationship with Jane Henderson. The two married in 1913 and had a daughter, Moira.

Smythe first attended high school at Upper Canada College, but disliked it and transferred to Jarvis Collegiate Institute after a year and a half. He developed his athleticism there, playing on the hockey, rugby football, and basketball teams, and playing on city championship teams in basketball and hockey in 1912. At the age of 16, Smythe met Irene Sands, his future wife, after a football game against Parkdale Collegiate Institute, which she attended. Albert Smythe wanted his son to attend university, but Conn defied his father, bolting at age 17 to become a homesteader on in Clute Township, near Cochrane, Ontario. After one summer building a home on the property only to have it destroyed by a devastating fire, Smythe returned home and enrolled in engineering studies at the University of Toronto in the fall of 1912. There he played hockey as a centre, captaining the Varsity Blues men&#x27;s ice hockey team to the finals of the 1914 Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) junior championships and to the OHA junior championship the following year. The coach of the losing team in 1915 was Frank J. Selke, who years later would work for Smythe at Maple Leaf Gardens. Smythe also played on the University of Toronto football team, although not as a starter.

==First World War==

A week after winning the OHA championship in March 1915, Smythe and his eight teammates enlisted in the armed forces during World War I. He recalled in his memoirs that he and several classmates had tried to enlist at the beginning of the 1914–15 season, but were told to come back when they had beards. After securing a provisional rank of lieutenant with the 2nd (Ottawa) Battery, 8th Brigade, on July 17, he headed to the Royal School of Artillery in Kingston, Ontario, in August for five weeks of training. He made full lieutenant on September 11, and was able to get himself transferred to the 40th (Sportsmen&#x27;s) Battery of Hamilton, organized by publishing figure Gordon Southam, son of William Southam. The unit, with Smythe as team manager, organized a team to compete in the OHA&#x27;s senior league; they were one of four Toronto-based teams in the league in 1916. He played one game at centre, and then decided to replace himself with a better player. The team did not complete the season, as the 40th Battery went overseas in February 1916.

The Battery was ordered into the Ypres salient. On October 12, shelling found their position. killing Major Southam and Sergeant-Major Norm Harvie, temporarily making Smythe commander of the Battery. The Battery fought for nearly two months in the trenches near the Somme before being relieved. In February 1917, Smythe earned a Military Cross, when during an attack the Germans counter-attacked with grenades. Smythe ran into the fight and killed three Germans and helped several wounded Canadian soldiers back to safety On March 5, 1917, Smythe was awarded the Military Cross for &quot;dispersing an enemy party at a critical time. Himself accounted for three of the enemy with his revolver.&quot; After an attack where several Canadians were killed because of what Smythe thought was poor planning by the Battery&#x27;s Major, Smythe wanted out. Smythe transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in July 1917. One of his instructors was Billy Barker, who would later become the first president of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Smythe served as an airborne observer, directing artillery fire. Smythe was shot down by the Germans and captured on October 14, 1917; he was imprisoned by the Germans at Schweidnitz (Swidnica) in Upper Silesia. Smythe made two failed escape attempts and ended up in solitary confinement as a result. He was a POW until the end of the war. Smythe would later make light of his fourteen months in captivity &quot;We played so damned much bridge that I never played the game again.&quot;
==Return to Toronto==
Following the war, Smythe returned to Toronto. With his accrued Army salary and the proceeds from the sale of his homestead plot, he started a sand and gravel business. For a while, the venture became a partnership with Frank Angotti, who owned a paving business. To support the need for sand and gravel, Smythe bought land northwest of Toronto for a sand pit. He returned to the University of Toronto and finished his civil engineering degree in 1920, marrying Irene during the school year. Smythe and his paving business partner split, and Smythe retained the sand and gravel business. The company was named C. Smythe Limited and the company slogan was &quot;C. Smythe for sand,&quot; which he had painted on his trucks, the lettering in white on the blue of the trucks. Frank Selke, who had moved to Toronto, was one of Smythe&#x27;s first employees in the business. Irene took sand and gravel orders over the phone while also caring for the couple&#x27;s newborn son, Stafford. Smythe would own the business until 1961.

In the evenings, Smythe coached the University of Toronto varsity team, and it was through his coaching of this team that he became involved in the NHL. The team traveled regularly to the Boston area for games against local colleges, with great success. In 1926, Boston Bruins owner Charles Adams recommended Smythe to Col. John S. Hammond, who oversaw the new New York Rangers franchise for its owners, Madison Square Garden. Hammond hired Smythe as general manager and coach, and tasked him with putting together a team. But on October 27, 1926, before the Rangers had played a regular-season game, Hammond fired Smythe in favour of Lester Patrick. Smythe believed Hammond fired him because of his refusal to sign two-time NHL scoring champion Babe Dye, against Hammond&#x27;s wishes. Smythe thought Dye was not a team player.

Smythe applied to coach the Toronto St. Pats, but was rejected in favour of Mike Rodden. He continued coaching for the University of Toronto and took on a new senior team made up of University of Toronto players, called the Varsity Grads. The team won the Allan Cup and represented Canada at the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz the following year. Smythe refused to go when two Varsity Blues players he had promised could be part of the team were blocked by what he described as a &quot;pressure play&quot; from two Grads players to get relatives placed on the team instead. One of the players was Joe Sullivan, who years later became a Canadian Senator.

Although Smythe was no longer a Rangers employee, Madison Square Garden president Tex Rickard invited him to the team&#x27;s opening game at the arena, an invitation Smythe nearly turned down because he had felt the Rangers had short-changed him (Hammond paid Smythe $7,500 to settle his contract, but Smythe felt he was owed $10,000). At the insistence of his wife Irene, they traveled to New York and attended the opener in Rickard&#x27;s private box. When the Rangers won the game, surprising the Montreal Maroons, Rickard offered Smythe a vice-presidency with the club. Smythe turned Rickard down partly because of the disputed $2,500, although Rickard ordered Hammond to pay off the rest. On their return trip to Toronto, the Smythes visited Montreal, where Conn bet the $2,500 on a university football game between Toronto and McGill. He then bet the $5,000 he won on the Rangers to defeat the St. Pats in Toronto, winning again, turning the $2,500 into $10,000 in three days. The Rangers won the Stanley Cup in 1928, their second year of existence, largely with the players Smythe had recruited.

==Smythe forms the Maple Leafs==
While the Rangers shot to the top of their division, Smythe&#x27;s hometown team, the St. Pats, were struggling. J. P. Bickell, a part-owner of the St. Pats, contacted Smythe about coaching the team. However, Smythe told Bickell that he was more interested in buying the team, or at least a stake in the team. Not long after, the St. Pats were put up for sale, and majority owner Charles Querrie agreed in principle to sell the club for ($ in dollars) to a group headed by C. C. Pyle, which would have moved the team to Philadelphia. Bickell contacted Smythe and told him that if Smythe could raise $160,000 and keep the team in Toronto, Bickell would not sell his $40,000 interest. After persuading Querrie that civic pride was more important than money, Smythe put together a syndicate that included Bickell and several other investors that bought the St. Pats; Smythe invested $10,000 of his own money. Soon after the sale closed on February 14, 1927, the new owners changed the St. Pats&#x27; name to the Toronto Maple Leafs.

At first, Smythe&#x27;s name was kept in the background. However, when the Leafs promoted a public share offering to raise capital, they announced that &quot;one of the most prominent hockey coaches in Toronto&quot; would be taking over management of the club. That prominent coach turned out to be Smythe. He succeeded Querrie as the team&#x27;s governor, and installed himself as general manager. He installed Alex Romeril as coach. For the next season (1927–28), Smythe changed the team&#x27;s colours from green and white to their present blue and white. According to the Maple Leafs, the blue represents the Canadian skies, while white represents snow. They were also the same colours as those of his sand and gravel business trucks, as well as of UofT, his alma mater. Smythe also took over as coach and for the next three years served as team governor, general manager and coach.

Smythe developed a public image as a &quot;red-faced, pepper-pot&quot; with nicknames such as &quot;little corporal&quot; or &quot;little dictator.&quot; Smythe was not reluctant to chase players and referees on the rink and off. Smythe also developed feuds with opposing coaches and general managers. He used any tactic available to disrupt the opponent. He advertised in a Boston newspaper inviting people to watch &quot;a real hockey team, the Toronto Maple Leafs.&quot; After learning that Boston general manager Art Ross suffered from hemorrhoids, he gave Ross a bouquet of flowers with a note in Latin describing where he should shove the flowers.
In 1929, Smythe decided, in the midst of the Great Depression, that the Maple Leafs needed a new arena. The Arena Gardens seated 8,000 people, but the Maple Leafs were regularly playing to standing-room-only crowds of 9,000 customers. Smythe knew it would take over a million dollars to construct the building, and he got backing from the Sun Life insurance company for half a million. He found a site owned by the T. Eaton Co. department store chain on Carlton Street, a site he selected because it was on a streetcar line. Smythe gave up the coaching position to concentrate on the arena project. The building started construction on June 1, 1931, and was ready on November 12, 1931, after five months. As part of a corporate reorganization, Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. was founded that year to own both the team and the arena. The construction workers on the project received 20% of their pay in the form of Maple Leaf Gardens stock. Selke (who had union connections) and Smythe were successful in negotiating this payment method in exchange for using unionized workers.

During the 1931-32 season (the Maple Leafs&#x27; first in their new arena), Smythe fired coach Art Duncan after five games and hired Dick Irvin to coach. Irvin promptly led the team to its first Stanley Cup under the Maple Leafs name, and the franchise&#x27;s third overall. While the Leafs would go to the Stanley Cup Finals every year during Irvin&#x27;s tenure except for 1934 and 1937, they were unable to win another Cup. By 1940, Smythe believed that Irvin had taken the Leafs as far as he could, and decided to replace him with former Leafs captain Hap Day, who had retired as a player. Smythe also knew that he would be away in the war and felt that Irvin would not be tough enough without Smythe to back him up. Meanwhile, the Montreal Canadiens had had a dreadful ten-win season, and were looking for a new coach. At Smythe&#x27;s suggestion, Irvin became the new coach of the Canadiens.

==Thoroughbred horse racing==
Smythe first became interested in horse racing as a boy, when he would take stories his father wrote at the track to the newspaper office downtown. Smythe started owning horses in the late 1920s, but he rarely had any success. One early purchase turned out to be one of his most famous. When Mrs. L. A. Livingston sold off her stable, he bought &quot;Rare Jewel&quot;, a filly, for $250. The filly regularly ran last. The horse was eligible for the Coronation Futurity Stakes, one of the best two-year-old races. Smythe was full of blind hope, and on the trainer&#x27;s advice, entered her in the race. The day of the race, both the trainer and his partner gave the horse some brandy, unknown to Smythe, who bet over $100 on &quot;Rare Jewel&quot;. She won the race, a 100–1 longshot paying $214.40 on a $2 bet, besting future Queen&#x27;s Plate winner &quot;Froth Blower&quot;. Between the winnings from his bets and his portion of the winner&#x27;s purse as horse owner, Smythe won more than $10,000 on that one race. Three weeks later, he put his windfall to work for the Maple Leafs by purchasing star defenceman King Clancy from the depression-strapped Ottawa Senators for $35,000. The purchase was only possible because of his gambling winnings, as the other Maple Leafs owners refused to pay the Senators&#x27; then-high price, and only agreed when Smythe volunteered to use his own money.

Smythe continued to own horses through the 1930s, but he sold them in 1940, when he made plans to fight in the Second World War. He did not re-enter the racing business until 1954. In 1951, Smythe bought land for a farm in Caledon, Ontario, originally looking for a new location for a gravel pit. At first he kept only cattle, but in 1954 he decided to get back into owning race horses, in partnership with Larkin Maloney, and an area was set aside to keep horses. Smythe learned about the business and went into breeding, buying mares in foal from top thoroughbred lines, and hiring future Hall of Fame trainer Yonnie Starr.

Maloney and Smythe&#x27;s most famous horse &quot;Wonder Where&quot;, also led to the breakup of the partnership. &quot;Wonder Where&quot;, named by Maloney, was bred at Frank Selke&#x27;s farm in Quebec and bought by Maloney and Smythe in 1957. In 1959, &quot;Wonder Where&quot; had an outstanding season, including winning the Canadian Oaks. The horse was voted Canadian Horse of the Year for the year and later, the filly was inducted in the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame. The Wonder Where Stakes was established in honour of the horse in 1965, becoming one of the Canadian Triple Tiara races for fillies in Canada in 1995. After the outstanding year in 1959, Maloney wanted to continue racing &quot;Wonder Where&quot; and Smythe did not, concerned over some tendon trouble. The horse broke down in a race in Fort Erie, and the partnership dissolved after that.

While not the largest operation, Smythe&#x27;s horses won 145 stakes races during his lifetime, a record second only to E. P. Taylor in Canada. Smythe&#x27;s stable won the Queen&#x27;s Plate twice, the first in 1958 with &quot;Caledon Beau&quot; and the second in 1967 with &quot;Jammed Lovely&quot;. In 1973, Smythe became a founding member of the Jockey Club of Canada. In 1977, he was inducted in the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame. After his death, the Smythe stable was sold in 1981 to Gardiner Farms and Harlequin Ranches, for an estimated $2.5 million. Smythe&#x27;s will gave the racing stable to the Conn Smythe Foundation, which as a charitable foundation, could not run a business. The new owners leased back the farm and stables. The only horse not in the sale was &quot;Jammed Lucky&quot;, Smythe&#x27;s favourite, which was given to Smythe&#x27;s grandson Tommy. &quot;Jammed Lucky&quot; was 23 years old and had sired 25 winning foals to that point.

==Second World War and the conscription crisis==

In the Second World War, at age 45, Smythe again served in the Canadian Army. Initially, he was a captain in charge of a troop within the Canadian Officers Training Corps, based at the University of Toronto. In 1941, along with Colonel Richard Greer, he formed the 30th Battery, a sportsmen&#x27;s anti-aircraft battery that was part of the 6th LAA Regiment, RCA (Royal Canadian Artillery), Canadian Active Army. Smythe was made acting major and Officer Commanding. He was offered a higher rank to become the army&#x27;s sports officer, but turned it down. After first serving on Vancouver Island to defend against Japanese attack, the Battery embarked in September 1942 to England. After being stationed in England for nearly two years, Smythe and his unit were sent to France in July 1944, where within three weeks he was badly wounded when the Germans bombed an ammunition depot. His spinal cord injury would mean that for the rest of his life he would walk with a limp and suffer bowel and urinary tract problems. He was sent back to Canada in September on a hospital ship.

Smythe, who had seen that the army was using improperly trained troops due to a lack of soldiers, interviewed other soldiers during his time in the hospital, compiling a record over which to confront Mackenzie King. King had developed an official government policy of voluntary service for political reasons and Smythe saw the detrimental effect it had on the Army. Volunteers tried to press home service troops into active service to assist and augment the undermanned troops overseas. From his bed in the Chorley Park Hospital, Smythe dictated a statement to &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; newspaper, which printed it on its front page on September 19, 1944:

Smythe was accused of acting solely for political gain. The publisher of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; at the time was prominent Conservative George McCullagh, and Smythe was friends with Ontario Conservative Premier George Drew. McCullagh and Drew may have used Smythe for their political ends to defeat King. The issue of lack of reinforcements was well known within the Army and Smythe did not make any complaints to senior officers while in active service. Despite being criticized, Smythe kept up his public criticism in the newspapers. After James Ralston, Canada&#x27;s defence minister, traveled to Italy, he saw for himself the shortage of skilled reinforcements. Ralston, who King did not trust, was replaced with Andrew McNaughton, who was against conscription. However, even King saw the need to send troops for the Canadian Army and he ordered 17,500 reserve troops to Europe in November 1944, which started to arrive in January 1945

==Majority owner of the Maple Leafs==
While Smythe was away, a committee, headed by Ed Bickle, Bill MacBrien, and Selke ran Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd., with Selke as acting general manager. Upon his return from the military, Smythe found himself in the middle of a power struggle over the presidency of the company. Smythe suspected that MacBrien, a member of the board of directors, wanted to succeed Bickle as president and make Selke general manager in his own right. Smythe wanted to be president and asked Selke for his support. Selke equivocated, and the relationship between the two long-time friends turned acrimonious, leading to Selke&#x27;s resignation in May 1946. Two months later, Selke became head of hockey operations for the Canadiens and manager of their home arena, the Montreal Forum, succeeding Tommy Gorman.

With the support of J. P. Bickell and the help of a $300,000 loan from Toronto stockbroker and Gardens shareholder Percy Gardiner, Smythe bought controlling interest in Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd., and was thus able to install himself as president on November 19, 1947. However, Smythe had been the face of the franchise for more than two decades before then. Acknowledging this, Andy Lytle, sports editor of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, said the appointment &quot;simply makes official what he has been for years in actuality ... Smythe and the Gardens are synonymous terms.&quot; MacBrien was made chairman. Smythe repaid his debt to Gardiner by 1960. He later succeeded MacBrien as chairman of the board.

Smythe oversaw one of hockey&#x27;s greatest dynasties when Toronto won six Stanley Cups in 10 seasons between 1942 and 1951. Hap Day coached the team to five of those Cups and was assistant general manager for the sixth. He was named in a poll of Canadian sports editors the &quot;most dominating personality in any capacity in sports&quot; for 1949. The Maple Leafs were masters of playoff hockey; their regular-season performances were usually fair to good or just good enough to make the playoffs. Smythe was known for caring little about gaudy regular-season records. However, he did care about winning the Cup, because &quot;winning sells tickets.&quot;

However, the Leafs spent most of the 1950s as a mediocre team, struggling under three different coaches while Day remained assistant general manager under Smythe. Even so, in 1955, Smythe turned over most responsibility for hockey operations to Day, but nominally remained general manager. However, just after the Leafs were eliminated from the playoffs in 1957, Smythe told the media that it had been &quot;a season of failure&quot; and that he did not know if the 55-year-old Day would be available for the next season. Day felt Smythe had cut his legs out from under him and resigned; he had spent 28 of the previous 30 years with the St. Pats/Leafs as a player, coach, or executive.

By this time Smythe had turned team operations over to a seven-person committee, headed by his son Stafford. Newspaper owner John W. H. Bassett was another member of the committee, as was Percy Gardiner&#x27;s son, George. The committee became known as the &quot;Silver Seven&quot; because the seven had been &quot;born with a silver spoon in their mouths.&quot; Initially, all members were in their 30s or early 40s, but that changed before the end of the year when 54-year-old Harold Ballard, president of the Toronto Marlboros, was appointed to the committee to fill a vacancy. The committee hired Punch Imlach as general manager; Imlach would later take over the coaching job as well.

Smythe was an NHL owner during the era before the advent of a players&#x27; union. Between the 1942–43 and 1966-67 seasons, the NHL consisted of only six teams (the Original Six), and players who failed to comply with team orders could easily be demoted to the minor leagues and replaced. Players who did not follow Smythe&#x27;s rules were traded or sent to the minors. Two players, Danny Lewicki and John McCormack, were both demoted to the minors for getting married without Smythe&#x27;s permission.

While the pay for an NHL player was relatively good, it still left many players looking for other jobs during the off-season, while the owners were all wealthy men. These conditions led to two efforts to organize a union, which Smythe was vehemently against. From 1957 onwards, Smythe, along with other owners, including James D. Norris of the Chicago Black Hawks and his half-brother Bruce Norris of the Detroit Red Wings, were accused of union busting activities related to Ted Lindsay&#x27;s attempt to form an NHL Players Association. Smythe&#x27;s role in those affairs are dramatized in the movie &quot;Net Worth&quot;. Jimmy Thomson, who was acting captain of the Maple Leafs when the players started to organize, was singled out by Smythe. Smythe detailed all the monies Thomson had been paid by the organization going back to junior, while arranging for Thomson to be left off the team. He also allegedly called Thomson a traitor and publicly blamed him for the team&#x27;s poor season. Thomson finally announced to the press that he would never play again for the Maple Leafs, and he and Tod Sloan were traded away to Chicago. The NHL owners eventually agreed to make some concessions to the players, such as contributing to the players&#x27; pensions. The owners were able to temporarily head off the formation of the union, although it would eventually be organized some ten years later.

==Later years==
Though the Silver Seven made most decisions involving the Leafs, Smythe was not a hands-off owner and was constantly fighting with his son. Stafford commented: &quot;My father has always given me lots of rope. When I was thirty, I was ten years ahead of everybody. But at forty, I&#x27;m ten years behind everybody.&quot; Finally, in 1961, Stafford resigned from the committee and this spurred Conn. After four years of fighting, he offered to sell his shares to Stafford and in November 1961, Smythe sold 45,000 of his 50,000 shares in Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. to a partnership of his son, Ballard, and Bassett for $2.3 million—a handsome return on his investment of 34 years earlier. Years later, Smythe claimed that he thought the sale was only to Stafford, and was furious to learn that he&#x27;d brought on Ballard and Bassett as partners. According to this account, Smythe had hoped that Stafford would eventually keep the Gardens for his son Tommy. However, it is not likely that Stafford would have been able to raise the money on his own.

As part of the arrangement, Smythe resigned as president and managing director, nominating Stafford to succeed him. At Stafford&#x27;s instigation, the board then granted Smythe a $15,000 annual allowance, an office at the Gardens, and a car and driver for the rest of his life. Stafford, Ballard, and Bassett then nominated Smythe as chairman of the board. Smythe stood down as governor of the Leafs on February 5, 1962–a position he had held since 1927. Smythe resigned the team chairmanship after Toronto won the Stanley Cup in 1962, and Bassett succeeded him.

In 1964, Smythe opposed the plan of Liberal Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson to replace the traditional Canadian flag with a completely new design. He wrote to Pearson, whom he had known since the 1920s: &quot;In the Olympic Games, the whole world is represented and when Canada sometimes wins a Gold Medal everybody knows, when the Red Ensign is raised to the masthead, that Canada has won.&quot; Smythe disagreed that a new flag would help to unify the country, and switched his support to John Diefenbaker and the Progressive Conservatives. Smythe wrote over 300 letters to Members of Parliament. In 1965, he unsuccessfully lobbied for the Red Ensign to be flown at the Gardens instead of the new Flag of Canada. Ballard ordered the new flag flown because calls were more than three to one in favour of the new flag.

In March 1966, Smythe sold his remaining shares in Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. and resigned from the board of directors after a Muhammad Ali boxing match was scheduled for the Gardens. He found Ali&#x27;s refusal to serve in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War to be offensive because, as he put it in his autobiography, &quot;The Gardens was founded by men – sportsmen – who fought for their country. It is no place for those want to evade conscription in their own country. The Gardens was built for many things, but not for picking up things that no one else wants.&quot; He also said that by accepting the fight, Gardens owners had &quot;put cash ahead of class.&quot;

Smythe stayed away from the Gardens and took shots at the ownership in the press, stating that he had been &quot;traded for $35,000 and a black Muslim minister.&quot; The seats at the Gardens had been replaced with new, narrower ones, and Smythe commented that &quot;only a slim, young man could sit in them but the prices are so high that only a fat rich man could afford them.&quot; He continued to be sought out for his views on hockey. When the NHL expanded to 12 teams from six in 1967, Smythe openly opposed the expansion on the basis that it would make for inferior hockey: &quot;We had the best players in the world split between six teams, and hockey was always worth the money.&quot;

By this time, Conn and Stafford were not on speaking terms, and it fell to Tom Smythe, Stafford&#x27;s son, to mediate between the two. Stafford built a new office suite at the Gardens for Conn, and the feud was over. After Stafford was charged with fraud in 1971 and became ill with a stomach ulcer, Conn was with him in hospital when he died. According to Conn, Stafford&#x27;s last words to him were &quot;see dad, I told you they wouldn&#x27;t put me in jail.&quot;

==Other accomplishments and honours==

After the Second World War, Smythe became involved in charities and would remain so for the rest of his life.

Always mindful of the well-being of his fellow veterans, he helped establish and was a founding director of the Canadian Paraplegic Association in 1945 (the foreparent of Spinal Cord Injury Ontario and other spinal cord injury organizations). He gave generously of his time, expertise and treasure to aid in the organization&#x27;s success, even housing its offices and storing its incoming batches of wheelchairs for his fellow veterans, at Maple Leaf Gardens.

He became heavily involved in the Ontario Society for Crippled Children. Smythe helped organize the financing and construction of their Variety Club Village complex in Toronto. In 1975, at the age of 80, Smythe organized the financing and building of the Ontario Community Centre for the Deaf, which opened in 1979.

In 1960, after paying off his debt to Percy Gardiner, Smythe set up the Conn Smythe Charitable Foundation, which distributes money to charities in the Toronto area. The foundation was operated by Conn, his children and Hap Day. Day continued to help with the Foundation until his death in 1990. Before he died, Conn arranged for his grandson Thomas Smythe to continue the Foundation after his death.

Smythe supervised the construction of the Hockey Hall of Fame building in Toronto in 1961. He served as the Hall&#x27;s chairman for several years, but resigned in June 1971 when Busher Jackson was posthumously elected into the Hall. Smythe said that it made him sick to think of Jackson alongside such Leafs as &quot;Apps, Primeau, Conacher, Clancy and Kennedy. If the standards are going to be lowered I&#x27;ll get out as chairman of the board.&quot; Jackson was notorious for his off-ice lifestyle of drinking and broken marriages. Frank Selke, head of the selection committee, defended the selection on the belief that a man should not be shut out &quot;because of the amount of beer he drank.&quot;

The National Hockey League honoured Smythe&#x27;s contribution to the game by introducing the Conn Smythe Trophy in 1965, to be presented to the Most Valuable Player in the Stanley Cup playoffs. After his death, the trophy was renamed the Conn Smythe Memorial Trophy. The league also named one of its four divisions, the Smythe Division, after him prior to the 1974–75 season. The division existed until league expansion and realignment after the 1992-93 season.

Smythe Park and Recreation Centre in Toronto is located on the site of his old gravel pit. The surrounding neighbourhood is named Rockcliffe-Smythe, partly a sub-division Smythe built for war veterans. Smythe made provisions for a portion of the lands of the sub-division to be reserved for the centre. A street north of Eglinton Avenue, west of Markham Road, is named &quot;Conn Smythe Drive&quot; in his honour.

His autobiography, &quot;Conn Smythe: If You Can&#x27;t Beat &#x27;Em in the Alley&quot;, written with Scott Young, was published posthumously in 1981. The title was taken from Smythe&#x27;s credo, &quot;If you can&#x27;t beat &#x27;em in the alley, you can&#x27;t beat &#x27;em on the ice.&quot; In Smythe&#x27;s memoir he describes it as the most misunderstood remark he ever made. Rather than meaning that his players should go out and bully the opposition, he meant the opposite; that his players should refuse to be bullied by the opposition.

Conn Smythe was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1998.

==Family and personal life==
Smythe married Irene Sands on March 17, 1920, at Central Methodist Church. The couple lived in an apartment on St. Clair Avenue, then moved to the Runnymede area of Toronto to be close to Smythe&#x27;s sand and gravel business, which operated a gravel pit north-west of Jane Street and St. Clair. (Smythe Park exists on the site today). In 1927, after their first two children, Stafford and Miriam, were born, they moved to the Baby Point enclave of Toronto, where they would live for the rest of their lives. Irene and Smythe had two other children, Hugh and Patricia. Hugh became a doctor; a specialist in rheumatology, and later a director of Maple Leaf Gardens. Patricia died due to an allergic attack at the age of ten, in 1945. Stafford became involved in the Smythe sand and gravel business and Maple Leaf Gardens before dying of complications from a bleeding ulcer in 1971. Stafford&#x27;s son Thomas was a stick boy with the Maple Leafs and later was involved with the Toronto Marlboros and Doug Laurie Sporting Goods at Maple Leaf Gardens, before becoming director of the Smythe Charitable Foundation after Conn&#x27;s death.

Smythe&#x27;s father died in 1947 at 86 years of age. Smythe had had a rapprochement with his father, seeing him at Christmas and at times when Albert came to Toronto to preach. After his father&#x27;s death, Smythe joined the Theosophical Society and remained a member for life. In 1977, Smythe explained why he was a theosophist: &quot;It&#x27;s because a theosophist teaches you that ya can&#x27;t get away with anything in this life anyway.&quot;

Irene Smythe was diagnosed with cancer after Christmas 1963. The illness progressed and Irene died on June 20, 1965. Due to the amount of pain Irene endured, Conn and Irene considered using a revolver to end her life, but near the end she told Conn that it was a &quot;coward&#x27;s way out&quot; and she endured. After the amount of pain Irene endured, Smythe called her death a &quot;blessed release.&quot; Smythe set up a foundation at the University of Toronto in her name, which opened the Irene Eleanor Smythe Pain Clinic at Toronto General Hospital.

On April 20, 1978, Smythe suffered a heart attack. He spent a month in the hospital, and got out in time to spend May 18 at Woodbine, where he had four horses racing that day. His health continued to deteriorate and Conn realized that he was dying. He arranged for his grandson Thomas Smythe to take over the Conn Smythe Foundation, and he made gifts of money to relatives. Conn Smythe died at the age of 85 in 1980 at his home on Baby Point. He is interred with Irene at Park Lawn Cemetery in Toronto.

<text>Katajanokka (; ) is a neighbourhood of Helsinki, Finland, with around 4000 inhabitants in 2005. The district is located adjacent to the immediate downtown area, though in the first major town plan for Helsinki from the mid-18th century, the area fell outside the fortifications planned to encircle the city.

Originally, Katajanokka was a headland of the Helsinki peninsula but is now technically an island, as a small canal was dug across the base of the headland in the 19th century. There are four bridges across the canal connecting Katajanokka with mainland Helsinki.

Buildings in Katajanokka include the former Katajanokka prison (now a Tribute Portfolio hotel by Marriott), the Uspenski Cathedral, the Katajanokka Casino, Wanha Satama, the Stora Enso head office designed by Alvar Aalto, the building of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Katajanokka Terminal used by Viking Line.

Katajanokka is one of the most distinguished neighbourhoods in Helsinki. Katajanokka&#x27;s residents have included former Finnish President (from 1982 to 1994) Mauno Koivisto, composer Einojuhani Rautavaara and author-artist Tove Jansson.

== Overview ==
The south side of Katajanokka is dominated by a passenger harbour which is frequented by large cruiseferries traveling between Helsinki, Stockholm, Mariehamn, Tallinn and Rostock. The rest of the district comprises co-operative apartment buildings and several small parks. The western part of the residential area, known as the &quot;Old Side&quot; of Katajanokka, is an upscale neighborhood and a well-preserved example of early 20th century Art Nouveau architecture, though up until the mid-19th century – while the centre of Helsinki was being filled with stone buildings – the area was essentially still a wooden shanty town. The eastern part was for a long time a closed military area containing a naval base and shipyard, later a commercial shipyard. It was redeveloped in the 1970s and 1980s into a mainly residential zone, often referred to as the &quot;New Side&quot; of Katajanokka. The new residential area is considered an exceptional example of modern town planning. A major part of the project was the conversion and extension of the old Russian naval barracks to house the Finnish foreign ministry.
The northern shore of Katajanokka still serves as a base for the Finnish coast guard, Helsinki maritime police as well as the Finnish icebreaker fleet.

Landmarks of Katajanokka include the Russian Orthodox Cathedral, also known as Uspenski Cathedral (architect Alexey Gornostaev, 1868), the Merikasarmi complex of the Foreign Ministry (architect Carl Ludvig Engel, 1825) and the Finnish headquarters of Stora Enso (architect Alvar Aalto, 1962; the most controversial of Aalto&#x27;s works).
Another famous building in Katajanokka is the former district prison of Southern Finland. The old prison dates back to 1837, and functioned as a prison until 2002. The prison underwent an extensive interior renovation to convert the cells of the prison into hotel rooms, with sets of two or three cells combined to make up the current hotel rooms. The Best Western Premier Hotel Katajanokka opened in May 2007 with 106 guest rooms. Renovations cost a reported 15 million euro. As a historic building, strict limits were imposed on the redevelopment due to the strict regime of protection for historically significant buildings that is in effect in Finland. Thus, as a hotel, the exterior of the building has been preserved, as has the central corridor of the old prison and even the old prison wall. A restaurant at the lowest level of the hotel has attempted to keep much of the character of the old prison alive. However, an actual former prisoner told a Finnish newspaper that the supposed &quot;prison cutlery&quot; is very different from what the prison actually used: for example, prisoners never drank out of tin cups.

During the development of Katajanokka in the 1970s and 1980s, many old red brick industrial buildings were spared by converting them for public uses, such as a primary school and an indoors sports arena. There was controversy over the demolition of the former cadet school of the Russian navy, built in the early 20th century. Vacated by the Finnish military in the 1980s, the building survived, with various uses, mainly as a cultural centre. In the late 1990s, the city of Helsinki announced that it was going to demolish the building to build a new apartment building in its place. This caused huge protests, and the demolition was put off for almost a decade, mainly because of opposition from local inhabitants, and the Green League party.

The navy school building was finally demolished in autumn 2006. However, additional problems resulted: Contrary to what the city of Helsinki and the architecture bureau responsible for the new building had thought, there was no solid rock bottom underneath the old building, but only scattered rocks here and there. Because the original building had stood there since Czarist Russia, no original construction plans were available, and therefore the new plans had to be redone from scratch.
The local community organisation of Katajanokka is called &quot;Katajanokkaseura&quot;. The organization publishes an annual regional magazine, &quot;Katajanokan kaiku&quot; (Finnish for &quot;The Echo of Katajanokka&quot;).

There is an annual running event called the Katajanokan ympärijuoksu, open for everyone who lives in Katajanokka or has relatives living there.

== History ==
Urban settlement of Helsinki expanded from what is now the Senate Square to Katajanokka already in the 18th century. The outskirts settlements formed on the peninsula remained mostly untouched for decades even after the rest of Helsinki had been completely rebuilt according to the zoning plan made by Johan Albrecht Ehrenström in the early 19th century. The Katajanokka canal separating Katajanokka from the mainland and connecting the South and North Harbours of Helsinki with each other, already proposed in Ehrenström&#x27;s plan, was ultimately only built in 1844.

=== Name ===
The name &quot;Katajanokka&quot; literally means &quot;Juniper Point&quot; but the connection with junipers is just a coincidence resulting from a mistranslation.

The neighbourhood was originally known in the 17th century by the Swedish name &quot;Estnäs Skatan&quot; (&quot;Estnäs Point&quot;). The Finnish-speaking population did not understand Swedish, so the word &quot;skata&quot; (&quot;point&quot;) became &quot;kataja&quot; (&quot;juniper&quot;).

The Swedish name Skat Udden can be found from a 1775 map, while the Finnish name Katajanokka was first mentioned in the &quot;Suometar&quot; newspaper in 1856.

=== Barracks ===
From the 1810s to the 1830s barracks buildings designed by Carl Ludvig Engel and Anders Fredrik Granstedt for the use of the Russian military were built on the eastern tip of Katajanokka. In 1831 the barracks were taken into use by the First marine crew of Finland, which also caused the name of the barracks to be established as Merikasarmi (&quot;Marine barracks&quot;) instead of the Katajanokka barracks. This branch of the military was disestablished in the 1880s when the Grand Duchy of Finland introduced conscription. After this, the area became the base of the Russian Baltic fleet. After Finland became independent the garrison moved to the Finnish Defence Forces. It hosted the Helsinki navy station and military station (until 1958), the broadcast station of the radio battalion (in the 1920s) and the Valmet docks until the middle 1970s. The command of the Finnish Navy was located in a red brick building built in the 1880s until 1983 and the Guard Jaeger Regiment used the barracks in the 1960s. The deteriorated barracks buildings were renovated and restored for the use of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs from 1984 to 1989. New side buildings on either side of the old artillery courtyard were also built at the same time. A gate dating to 1776 was left as part of one of the side buildings. It is part of the artillery magazine built at the same time as the Suomenlinna fortress. Also a copy of the western officers&#x27; barracks was built on the eastern side of the barracks according to Engel&#x27;s original plan.

===Zoning plan===
Up to the 19th century, most of the buildings on the western side of Katajanokka were old wooden buildings built in the 18th century, already badly deteriorated, and warehouses. Exceptions to this included the Uspenski Cathedral built in 1868, the building of the Mint of Finland (1836), the Helsinki County Prison located near the garrison and some apartment buildings built in the very end of the century. Katajanokka had been left outside the city&#x27;s zoning plan, until it became a subject of central interest in the 1870s. The zoning plan in the area was confirmed in 1895. According to it, the southern shore of the peninsula was reserved for a harbour and the area north to it as a residential area. The tip of the peninsula remained in the use of the garrison.

===Other building history===

A number of brick warehouses were built in the harbour area. The neighbouring residential area, the &quot;old side&quot; of Katajanokka, was mostly built during one decade in the early 20th century. The buildings in the area form a rare harmonious Art Nouveau architectural entity. For example the architects Gesellius, Lindgren, Saarinen designed three of the houses: the first to be completed was the Tallberg house, whose design was the trio&#x27;s first competition victory.

Rebuilding of a couple of houses destroyed in World War II or unbuilt lots has been done in accordance with the historical surroundings.

On the western side of Katajanokka is the Stora Enso headquarters designed by the academic Alvar Aalto (1962), a building clad in white marble, inspired by Italian renaissance palaces. It is visible as an ending to the Pohjoisesplanadi street from the Market Square, although a distinctive feature of the building is that it sort of lacks a frontal facade. The decorative red brick Norrmén house built in 1897 had been demolished to make room for Aalto&#x27;s building. There has been intense debate for several decades about whether Aalto&#x27;s building fits in with the Market Square milieu and the cityscape dominated by the Uspenski Cathedral. When a white office building for the use of the development assistance department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was built near Aalto&#x27;s building in 1993, the buildings have been seen as supporting each other and forming their own clear-bordered architectural entity.

In 1913 the so-called Chapel of Peace was built at the lot of the Uspenski Cathedral to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Treaty of Fredrikshamn. It was seen as a symbol of Russian oppression and in 1919 nationalistic students covered it with tar. It was impossible to get the tar off the rock surface, so the building was dismantled.

The buildings on the eastern tip surrounding the Merikasarmi building, in the so-called &quot;new side&quot;, consisted already in the 1920s of various buildings related to warehouse, workshop and dock activities. The Katajanokka Airport used by Aero Oy (now known as Finnair) was also located on the southern shore of the area, serving as an airport for route flights from 1924 to 1936. When the navy garrison and the military harbour had moved to Upinniemi and the Valmet dock had moved to Vuosaari, most of the old warehouse and industrial buildings were dismantled. The zoning plan designed by the architectural trio Vilhelm Helander, Pekka Pakkala and Mikael Sundman was confirmed in 1977 and from 1977 to 1986 a total of 21 new apartment buildings were built in the area. The last of the free lots were built from 2006 to 2009. The zoning plan sought to return to the tightly-built urban space in a contrast to the earlier suburban type of construction, which has later been seen as a turning point in Finnish city design. The plan was also praised for taking the architectural and cultural history of the surrounding area into account. Open spaces were sought to be measured in regard of the actual number of visitors. However, because of design norms, the building efficiency remained lower than that of the old part. The red brick facades were ordered to be laid in place, even though this was during the golden age of element construction. A large number of the houses were designed as rental or Hitas houses, which caused a restriction on the cost of construction. For example parking had to be done on ground level. In the latest buildings completed in 2007 parking is handled underground.

===Harbour===

In the late 19th century, the southern shore of Katajanokka was built into a cargo traffic harbour, which was part of the South Harbour. The Helsinki harbour rail, leading from the VR warehouses south of the Töölönlahti bay along the city&#x27;s coastline to the Katajanokka harbour, was built in 1894. The harbour was later changed into a passenger traffic harbour.

Rail transport to the South Harbour and Katajanokka ended on 30 April 1980. Traffic on the cargo harbour rail decreased as the South Harbour became mostly a harbour for car ferries. Car ferry traffic started on 9 July 1974 by the ship MS &quot;Viking 5&quot; to Stockholm, Sweden. The site of the old harbour rail yard now hosts a wide avenue called Katajanokanlaituri, and many old warehouse buildings along it have been renovated into hotels and conference centres.

The last of the fourteen tripodal cranes on Katajanokka were built in 1959. After this, the Katajanokka harbour could at some times use two cranes for each hatch on a cargo ship. One of the cranes was unloading cargo from the SS &quot;Niobe&quot; when a chain of cargo carriages crashed into one of the crane&#x27;s legs at a spot where the crane tracks and the railway tracks crossed. The crane fell down and was completely destroyed, but its driver suffered no injuries. The last four harbour cranes in Katajanokka were dismantled in January 1986.

Guarding the harbour area in Katajanokka was improved on 3 May 1994 to improve passport control and customs activity. All persons present at the harbour area had to have an identity document with a photograph with them. In early May 1997 the gate control of the entire South Harbour was transferred over to a security company.

The harbour activity also had side effects. From the 19th century to the middle 20th century Katajanokka was an area of ill repute, where illegal sales of liquor and prostitution were often practised. For a long time, the image of the northern shore of Katajanokka was dominated by large warehouses belonging to a freight forwarder. These have later been renovated into the use of restaurants and cafés. The northern shore used to also host a garbage pier, where excrement was loaded into barges which took it to the countryside to act as fertiliser for the country fields. However, sometimes garbage transporters dumped their cargo right into the sea.

===Icebreakers===

The Finnish icebreakers, with the exception of the multiple-use icebreakers, still spend their summers at the Katajanokka shore. Multiple-use icebreakers need to use the harbour only for installing and storage of equipment. This service is offered by the Kotka harbour. After the Valmet dock activity in Katajanokka had gradually moved to Vuosaari the old equipment pier was leased for the use of the icebreakers on 24 March 1975. The last ship launched from the dock was the tanker MT &quot;Tebostar&quot; on 26 April 1974. Individual icebreakers had been spending their summers at the shores of Katajanokka also before this. For example in summer 1971 an old system was kept in force, where two icebreakers were at Jätkäsaari, three at Hietalahti and three near the Valmet dock in Katajanokka. The icebreakers were connected to the city&#x27;s district heating network on 10 December 1979. Until this they had been generating their own heat and hot water themselves. The current icebreakers are &quot;Kontio&quot;, &quot;Otso&quot;, &quot;Voima&quot;, &quot;Urho&quot;, &quot;Sisu&quot; and &quot;Polaris&quot;. In summertime, the icebreakers spending their summer at Katajanokka can also be rented for private events.

===Plans===
There was a plan to build a house for architecture and design (Armi) in Katajanokka, with a architecture design competition held in 2001. The building would have been located next to the Stora Enso main office, in place of the Kanavaterminaali building. No funding could be found for the project and the organisations behind it parted ways, so the project was finally abandoned in 2006. In 2007 there was a plan for a hotel at the same site, named after Alvar Aalto and riding on his reputation, with the Swiss architecture bureau Herzog &amp; de Meuron invited to design it.

In 2006 there was a plan to build a bridge from Katajanokka to Laajasalo. The bridge would have been taken into use for trams and pedestrian traffic. In later versions the bridge was replaced with a tunnel, and a line going via Tervasaari and Sompasaari was found as an alternative route. Later, the Crown Bridges project was designed to pass through Hakaniemi.

There was a plan to build premises for the Helsinki emergency dispatch centre in Katajanokka. However, the rent of the premises was seen as too high, and the emergency dispatch centre was moved to Kerava. A new user for the caves was found, but its identity has not been made public. Explosions during the excavation of the caves caused damage in the properties along Luotsikatu.

== Architecture ==

Katajanokka is principally known for its fine examples of Jugendstil architecture. Other prominent styles apparent on the island are modernism, manifested in Alvar Aalto&#x27;s Enso-Gutzeit Building, and the red-brick industrial former harbour buildings and prison (now a Best Western hotel).

<text>Carl William Doy (born 1947) is a British-born New Zealand pianist, composer and arranger. One of New Zealand&#x27;s most successful musicians, Doy is probably best known for his multi-platinum selling &quot;Piano By Candlelight&quot; albums.

==Life and career==
Doy was born in Camberley, Surrey, England. He drew an interest in music as early as six years of age after he fell in love with his grandmother&#x27;s piano. Although he did not have a formal music education at that time, he had a natural gift for playing by ear, which he then used to play popular songs of the day. It was only when he was in the Grammar School, his talents were identified by his music teachers who guided him to take the preliminary exams at the Royal College of Music. At 18 years of age, he won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music and studied piano, organ and composition there for two years.

In 1967, having achieved highest grades for theory in music, he joined the Arcadia cruise ship of P&amp;O Cruises as its resident pianist. He spent the next few years playing between the cruise ship job and in UK clubs as well. In 1971, he was appointed the Musical Director aboard the Ocean Monarch cruise ship, which was one of the pioneers to have a full entertainment unit aboard.

After few years of work on cruise ships at the sea, Doy decided to settle down to pursue his musical career in a different domain. That resulted in him moving to New Zealand in 1973 with wife Kathy. He started work at Television New Zealand, where he got himself established quickly as a session pianist and arranger. That was the beginning of his career as a very popular writer and arranger of music for thousands of radio and television programs over the next decade or so. The most significant work at that time was the &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot; for Queen Elizabeth II. He also arranged the Pope&#x27;s Mass, which involved writing for two orchestras and a large voice choir. He had the opportunity to play and tour with a variety of visiting artists such as Shirley Bassey and The Seekers.

His immense success in popular commercial music scene started in late 1980s with the introduction of the best selling &quot;Piano by Candlelight&quot; sequel. It all started when Doy met Auckland record producer Murray Thom at an Auckland hotel in 1987. Thom heard something he knew would be a winner; Doy playing different kind of lounge music in the foyer and the two got talking. Within months Doy&#x27;s first Piano by Candlelight album was released. It was a big breakthrough for Doy and they decided to record an album with some popular music/songs in CD format. This was beginning of the ever popular &quot;Piano By Candlelight&quot; series, which made its entry to the NZ charts at number one in its first week. It was also one of the best selling albums ever by a NZ artist, selling in excess of one million copies in the US alone, and giving Carl the distinction of being the only New Zealand solo artist up until that time (1992) to have a certified platinum album in the US. The albums have also sold more than three million copies worldwide particularly in most European countries, the Far East, South America and Canada.

Eight more albums were recorded over the next twelve years under the same series. The second CD named &quot;Piano By Candlelight 2&quot; created a record in 1989 for most copies sold in New Zealand of a locally recorded album. Oprah Winfrey is one of his fans and his &quot;Together Collection&quot; was featured in her Favourite Things show in 2002 where she said &quot;It is so fabulous, I think it&#x27;s the best.&quot;

Dame Kiri Te Kanawa sang his arrangement of &quot;E te Tarakihi&quot; from Gisborne in the first live broadcast of the new millennium, to a worldwide television audience of over a hundred million people. Doy was also the music director/arranger of a series of CD albums created by another successful musician, NZ guitarist Martin Winch. One such album, &quot;Espresso Guitar&quot; released in 1998 has sold more than 100,000 copies in New Zealand alone.

In 1992, he received the Benny Award from the Variety Artists Club of New Zealand Inc, the highest honour available to a New Zealand variety entertainer.

Doy has completed five series of TVNZ&#x27;s &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. as its musical director.

In the 2009 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Doy was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to music.

Doy is a patron of the National Youth Theatre Company of New Zealand (NYTC).

<doc id="708931" wikidata="Q454065" url="?curid=708931" title="Amanda Peterson">
<text>Phyllis Amanda Peterson (July 8, 1971 – July 3, 2015) was an American actress, most known for her roles as Cindy Mancini in the 1987 film &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot; and Sunny Sisk on the NBC drama series &quot;A Year in the Life&quot; (1987–1988).

Peterson died at age 43 from an accidental drug overdose.

==Early life==
Peterson was born in Greeley, Colorado, the youngest of three children born to James Peterson—an ear, nose, and throat specialist—and his wife, Sylvia. She had two older siblings: a sister, Anne Marie, and a brother, James Jr. She was credited as Mandy Peterson at the beginning of her career; &quot;Mandy&quot; was how she was known to her friends and relatives. She later assumed &quot;Amanda Peterson&quot; as her professional name.

==Career==
At age seven, Peterson made her stage debut as Gretl von Trapp in a University of Northern Colorado production of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. At 11, she won a role in the musical film &quot;Annie&quot; as a dancing extra. Peterson went on to land guest spots on &quot;Father Murphy&quot; and &quot;Silver Spoons&quot;, while also appearing in more than 50 television commercials. Between 1983 and 1984, she co-starred as Squirt Sawyer on the NBC drama series &quot;Boone&quot;, which was canceled after one season.

In 1985, Peterson won her first major film role, playing Lori Swenson in the sci-fi fantasy &quot;Explorers&quot;. Despite performing averagely at the box office, the Joe Dante-directed feature went on to secure a cult following. Next, she co-starred as Sunny Sisk, the granddaughter of a successful businessman, in the Emmy Award-winning miniseries &quot;A Year in the Life&quot;; the third highest-rated miniseries of the 1986–87 U.S. television season. It was later adapted into a full series, airing on NBC from 1987 to 1988. For her work as Sisk on the show, Peterson won a Young Artist Award. Though initially well received, &quot;Life&quot; was canceled after one season.

In 1986, 15-year-old Peterson was cast to play the headline role of Cindy Mancini in the Buena Vista romantic comedy, &quot;Boy Rents Girl&quot;. The title was later changed to &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot; after producers secured the rights to The Beatles&#x27; 1964 song of the same name, which featured on the soundtrack. Released in August 1987, &quot;Love&quot; received mixed reviews but became the sleeper hit of the summer, with Peterson going on to achieve teen idol status as a result. In their critique of the film, &quot;The New York Times&quot; found Peterson&#x27;s portrayal of Mancini to be &quot;appealing&quot;, while highlighting her chemistry with co-star Patrick Dempsey.

In 1988, Peterson starred in a Roger Corman production, the post-apocalyptic adventure film &quot;The Lawless Land&quot;. This was followed by a co-starring role in the 1989 ensemble drama &quot;Listen to Me&quot;. She returned to her hometown of Greeley that same year to graduate from University High School, having been privately tutored while working in Los Angeles. Shortly afterward, she starred in the straight-to-video thriller &quot;Fatal Charm&quot; (1990), playing a naïve high schooler who forms a dangerous bond with a serial killer. That fall, Peterson enrolled at Middlebury College, where she appeared in a black box production of the Sarah Daniels play, &quot;Masterpieces,&quot; as well as guesting on &quot;Doogie Howser, M.D.&quot; while on semester break.

Following a recurring spot on the ABC drama series &quot;Jack&#x27;s Place&quot; in 1993, Peterson&#x27;s final appearance on-screen was a supporting role in the 1994 fantasy film, &quot;WindRunner&quot;.

==Sexual assault==
Peterson was raped at age 15, an incident she kept secret. This incident changed her attitude and led to trust issues. Some family members stated that the incident led to her drug use.

==Later years==
In 1994, Peterson retired from the entertainment industry and returned to her hometown of Greeley. According to her father, she left Hollywood to &quot;choose a new path in her life&quot;. After briefly attending Middlebury College, she enrolled at Colorado State University for a year. Peterson later studied at the University of Northern Colorado. In May 2012, she appeared in her last-ever photoshoot.

Peterson was twice married and had two children. She was first married to Joseph Robert Skutvik. After their divorce, she married David Hartley. Peterson and Hartley were reportedly divorced at the time of her death.

Between October 2000 and May 2012, Peterson was arrested five times for the offenses of third-degree assault, harassment, DUI, and possession of drug paraphernalia and suspicion of distributing a Schedule 2 controlled substance. From September to December 2005, she spent nearly three months in jail. Peterson&#x27;s last arrests were for a misdemeanor DUI and possession of narcotics equipment in April 2012, and suspicion of child abuse in May 2012, which was later dropped. According to her father, she had previously struggled with drug issues, but was drug-free at the time of her death and had become &quot;quite religious&quot;. He added that, in recent years, Peterson had suffered from sleep apnea, as well as bouts of pneumonia and sinusitis. For the last three years of her life, Peterson was receiving disability benefits and lived alone in an apartment in Greeley.

==Death==
Peterson was reported missing on July 3, 2015, after her family grew concerned when she failed to attend a planned dinner. Two days later, on July 5, she was found dead at her home by Greeley police, at the age of 43. Though her apartment door was unlocked, authorities found no evidence of foul play.

In an interview with &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; following Peterson&#x27;s death, her mother stated that while her daughter had dealt with drug issues in the past, she believed her to be drug-free at the time of her death, emphasizing that it &quot;was not in any way a drug thing&quot;.

An autopsy was scheduled for July 6 by the Weld County coroner, with results released on September 2, 2015. The examination revealed Peterson&#x27;s death resulted from an accidental drug overdose. She had recently undergone a hysterectomy and was prescribed Gabapentin for pain management. Additionally, she had been taking morphine, obtained from a friend a week prior. The coroner attributed her death to respiratory failure triggered by a &quot;morphine effect&quot;.

Two months after her death, in a September 2015 interview with talk show &quot;The Doctors&quot;, Peterson&#x27;s family revealed that she had been raped at age 15 and had not disclosed it at the time, even to her sister.

<doc id="708937" wikidata="Q50956" url="?curid=708937" title="Eugene Onegin (opera)">
<text>Eugene Onegin (, ), Op. 24, is an opera (designated as &quot;lyrical scenes&quot;) in 3 acts (7 scenes), composed by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. The libretto, organised by the composer himself, very closely follows certain passages in Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s 1825–1832 novel in verse, retaining much of his poetry. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s friend Konstantin Shilovsky contributed M. Triquet&#x27;s verses in Act 2, Scene 1, while Tchaikovsky himself arranged the text for Lensky&#x27;s arioso in Act 1, Scene 1, and almost all of Prince Gremin&#x27;s aria in Act 3, Scene 1.

&quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; is a well-known example of lyric opera, to which Tchaikovsky added music of a dramatic nature. The story concerns a selfish hero who lives to regret his blasé rejection of a young woman&#x27;s love and his careless incitement of a fatal duel with his best friend.

The opera was first performed in Moscow in 1879. There are several recordings of it, and it is regularly performed. The work&#x27;s title refers to the protagonist.

==Composition history==
In May 1877, the opera singer Yelizaveta Lavrovskaya spoke to Tchaikovsky about creating an opera based on the plot of Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s 1825–1832 verse novel &quot;Eugene Onegin.&quot; Tchaikovsky felt that the novel wasn&#x27;t particularly strong in plot – a dandy rejects a young country girl, she successfully grows into a worldly woman, he tries to seduce her but it is too late. The strength of the novel resided in its character development and social commentary, as well as in the beauty of its literary delivery. Soon after a sleepless night, Tchaikovsky came to embrace the idea. He created the scenarios in one night before starting the composition of the music.

Tchaikovsky, with some minor involvement by Konstantin Shilovsky, used original verses from Pushkin&#x27;s novel and chose scenes that involved the emotional world and fortunes of his heroes, calling the opera &quot;lyrical scenes.&quot; The opera is episodic; there is no continuous story, just selected highlights of Onegin&#x27;s life. The composer finished the opera by January 1878.

==Performance history==
Tchaikovsky worried whether the public would accept his opera, which lacked traditional scene changes. He believed that its performance required maximum simplicity and sincerity. With this in mind, he entrusted the first production to the students of the Moscow Conservatory. The premiere took place on 29 March (17 March O.S.) 1879 at the Maly Theatre, Moscow, conducted by Nikolai Rubinstein, with set designs by Karl Valts (Waltz).

Two years later the first performance at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow took place on 23 January (11 January O.S.) 1881 with conductor Eduard Nápravník.

Outside Russia the initial reception was lukewarm, and it was slow to reach European cities, being seen as a Russian curiosity. The first performance outside Russia took place on 6 December 1888 in Prague, conducted by Tchaikovsky himself, although the rehearsals had been the responsibility of Adolf Čech. It was sung in Czech and translated by Marie Červinková-Riegrová.

The first performance in Hamburg, on 19 January 1892, was conducted by Gustav Mahler, in the composer&#x27;s presence. Tchaikovsky was applauded after each scene and received curtain calls at the end. He attributed its success to Mahler, whom he described as &quot;not some average sort, but simply a &quot;genius&quot; burning with a desire to conduct&quot;.

The first performance in England took place on 17 October 1892 at the Olympic Theatre in London with Henry J. Wood conducting and Eugène Oudin in the title role. Fanny Moody sang Tatyana. This performance was sung in English, to a text translated by Henry Sutherland Edwards.

Vienna first saw &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; on 19 November 1897, conducted by Gustav Mahler.

The United States premiere was given on 24 March 1920 at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. The opera was sung in Italian. The first Russian performance by the Metropolitan Opera was on 15 October 1977.

==Synopsis==

Time: The 1820s

Place: St Petersburg and surrounding countryside

===Act 1===
&quot;Scene 1: The garden of the Larin country estate&quot;

Madame Larina and the nurse Filipyevna are sitting outside in the garden. They can hear Madame Larina&#x27;s two daughters, Tatyana and her younger sister Olga, singing a love song. Madame Larina begins to reminisce about her own courtship and marriage. A group of peasants enter, and celebrate the harvest with songs and dances. Tatyana and Olga watch. Tatyana has been reading a romantic novel and is absorbed by the story; her carefree sister, on the other hand, wants to join in the celebrations. Madame Larina tells Tatyana that real life is very different from her novels. Filipyevna announces that visitors have arrived: Olga&#x27;s fiancé Lensky, a young poet, and his friend Eugene Onegin, visiting the area from St Petersburg. The pair are shown in and Lensky introduces Onegin to the Larin family. Onegin is initially surprised that Lensky has chosen the extrovert Olga rather than her more subtle elder sister as his fiancée. Tatyana for her part is immediately and strongly attracted to Onegin. Lensky expresses his delight at seeing Olga and she responds flirtatiously. Onegin tells Tatyana of his boredom in the country and describes the death of his uncle and his subsequent inheritance of a nearby estate. Filipyevna recognizes that Onegin has had a profound effect on Tatyana.

&quot;Scene 2: Tatyana&#x27;s room&quot;

Tatyana is dressed for bed. Restless and unable to sleep, she asks her nurse Filipyevna to tell her about her youth and early marriage. Tatyana confesses that she is in love. Left alone, Tatyana pours out her feelings in a letter to Onegin. She tells him that she loves him and believes that she will never feel this way about anyone else, and begs him to understand and help her. She finishes writing the letter at dawn. A shepherd&#x27;s pipe is heard in the distance. Filipyevna enters the room to wake Tatyana. Tatyana persuades her to send her grandson to deliver the letter to Onegin.

&quot;Scene 3: Another part of the estate&quot;

Servant girls pick fruit and sing as they work. Tatyana waits anxiously for Onegin&#x27;s arrival. Onegin enters to see Tatyana and give her his answer to her letter. He explains, not unkindly, that he is not a man who loves easily and is unsuited to marriage. He is unworthy of her love and can only offer her brotherly affection. He warns Tatyana to be less emotionally open in the future. The voices of the servant girls singing are heard again. Tatyana is crushed and unable to reply.

===Act 2===
&quot;Scene 1: The ballroom of the Larin house&quot;

A ball is being given in honour of Tatyana, whose name day it is. Onegin is dancing with her. He grows irritated with a group of neighbours who gossip about him and Tatyana, and with Lensky for persuading him to come to the ball. He decides to avenge himself by dancing and flirting with Olga. Lensky is astounded and becomes extremely jealous. He confronts Olga but she cannot see that she has done anything wrong and tells Lensky not to be ridiculous. Onegin asks Olga to dance with him again and she agrees, as &quot;punishment&quot; for Lensky&#x27;s jealousy. The elderly French tutor Monsieur Triquet sings some couplets in honour of Tatyana, after which the quarrel between Lensky and Onegin becomes more intense. Lensky renounces his friendship with Onegin in front of all the guests, and challenges Onegin to a duel, which the latter is forced, with many misgivings, to accept. Tatyana collapses and the ball ends in confusion.

&quot;Scene 2: On the banks of a wooded stream, early morning&quot;

Lensky is waiting for Onegin with his second Zaretsky. Lensky reflects on his life, his fear of death and his love for Olga. Onegin arrives with his manservant Guillot. Both Lensky and Onegin are reluctant to go ahead with the duel, reflecting on the senselessness of their sudden enmity. But it is too late; neither man has the courage to stop the duel. Zaretsky gives them the signal and Onegin shoots Lensky dead.

===Act 3===
&quot;Scene 1: The house of a rich nobleman in St Petersburg&quot;

Five years have passed, during which Onegin has travelled extensively around Europe. Standing alone at a ball, he reflects on the emptiness of his life and his remorse over the death of Lensky. Prince Gremin enters with Tatyana, his wife, now a grand, aristocratic beauty. She is greeted by many of the guests with great deference. Onegin is taken aback when he sees Tatyana, and deeply impressed by her beauty and noble bearing. Tatyana, in turn, is overwhelmed with emotion when she recognizes him, but tries to suppress it. Gremin tells Onegin about his great happiness and love for Tatyana, and re-introduces Onegin to his wife. Onegin, suddenly injected with new life, realizes that he is in love with Tatyana. He determines to write to her and arrange a meeting.

&quot;Scene 2: A room in Prince Gremin&#x27;s house&quot;

Tatyana has received Onegin&#x27;s letter, which has stirred up the passion she felt for him as a young girl and disturbed her. Onegin enters. Tatyana recalls her earlier feelings and asks why Onegin is pursuing her now. Is it because of her social position? Onegin denies any cynical motivation: his passion is real and overwhelming. Tatyana, moved to tears, reflects how near they once were to happiness but nevertheless asks him to leave. He asks her to have pity. Tatyana admits she still loves Onegin, but asserts that their union can never be realized, as she is now married, and determined to remain faithful to her husband despite her true feelings. Onegin implores her to relent, but she bids him farewell forever, leaving him alone and in despair.

<text>The Henry VII Lady Chapel, now more often known just as the Henry VII Chapel, is a large Lady chapel at the far eastern end of Westminster Abbey, England, paid for by the will of King Henry VII. It is separated from the rest of the abbey by brass gates and a flight of stairs.

The structure of the chapel is a three-aisled nave composed of four bays, leading to an apse, which contains the altar, and behind that the tombs of Henry VII and his wife Elizabeth of York as well as of James I. There are five apsidal chapels.

The chapel is noted for its pendant fan vault ceiling.

The chapel is built in a very late Perpendicular Gothic style, the magnificence of which caused John Leland to call it the &quot;orbis miraculum&quot; (the wonder of the world). The tombs of several monarchs including Henry VII, Edward VI, Mary I, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles II and Mary, Queen of Scots are found in the chapel.

The chapel has also been the mother church of the Order of the Bath since 1725, and the banners of members hang above the stalls.

== History ==
In the 13th century, a movement toward devotion to the Virgin Mary inspired the building of chapels in her honour across Europe. Henry III’s Lady Chapel at Westminster Abbey was part of this trend. In 1502, Henry VII planned a new chapel. The old one was demolished in 1502 and construction of the new foundation began January 24, 1503.

Henry VII had three goals when planning his chapel. The first was to build a shrine to honour and hold the body of Henry VI, who was expected to be canonized. Ultimately, canonization did not occur and Henry VII and his wife, Elizabeth of York, were interred in the tomb intended for Henry VI. Second, Henry VII wished to dedicate a more elaborate chapel to the Virgin to replace the older, simpler structure; and third, he wanted a royal mausoleum for him, his family, and his heirs at an important religious site that would enhance his legitimacy as king and his legacy.

Henry VII allocated more than £14,000 for its construction between 1503 and 1509. In his will, he stipulated that more funds were to be provided as needed. The final cost of the chapel is estimated at £20,000. According to one nobleman, Lord Bacon, “He lieth at Westminster in one of the stateliest and daintiest monuments of Europe…So that he dwelleth more richly dead in the monument of his tomb than he did alive at Richmond or in any of his palaces.” 

In the eighteenth century, one observer commented that “[t]his chapel, it has been said, was designed as a sepulchre in which none but such as were of the royal-blood should ever be interred; accordingly the will of the founder has been so far observed, that all that have hitherto been admitted are of the highest quality, and can trace their descent from some or other of our ancient kings.” In the intervening years, some people not of aristocratic descent, including Oliver Cromwell, were buried there, but during the Restoration of the monarchy many of those people were disinterred.

== Pendant fan vault ==
The Henry VII Chapel is best known for its combination of pendant fan vault ceiling. Andrew Reynolds refers to the vault as “the most perfect example of a pendant fan vault, the most ambitious kind of vaulting current in the perpendicular period.” Notably, this ceiling was also the first to combine pendants with fan vaulting.

The fan vault is created by first dividing the ceiling into groin vaulted compartments. These groin vaults are created by the combination of arches along the wall and larger, transverse arches bridging the nave of the chapel. In the fan vault at the Henry VII Chapel, the compartments are nearly square in shape. The compartments are then ribbed and paneled. Ribs, of the same curve and size, are cut from single pieces of stone and rebated so to best fit with the panels. The curved ribs, extending from the same point on the wall, are spaced equidistant from each other, forming conoid shapes. The resulting conoids, however, require great compressive forces to keep shape.

Spandrels usually provide pressure along the upper edge of the conoids. In the Henry VII Chapel, these spandrels are replaced with hanging pendants. The pendants still provide the compression necessary to support the conoids and add complexity to the aesthetics of the room.

The pendants serve an additional structural purpose. The pendants are cut from single stones and inserted as wedge stones in the transverse arches. By combining with the transverse arches, the pendants do not require additional structural support.

At the time of the construction of the chapel, pendant vaults were very new; they were first seen in the Divinity School at Oxford.

==Other architectural features==
The chapel&#x27;s architect is unknown, but it is believed that Robert Janyns the Younger was responsible for the design of much of the structure. The structure of the chapel is a three-aisled nave composed of four bays. The aisles are divided by rows of mahogany stalls into the North, South, and Central aisles. All contain numerous monuments and floor stones dedicated to various nobles. Above the stalls, at the triforium level, are many sculptures. Interspersed between the sculptures are the heraldic banners of the Knights of the Order of the Bath. Above this is the clerestory, with three rows of smaller windows. The window tracery articulates four larger windows, one in each bay, each composed of these three rows of smaller lancet windows. As much of the original glass was destroyed during the English Commonwealth, the East Window, over the centre apsidal chapel, as well as the Donor Windows (in the west), in the chapels themselves, are new additions, installed in 2000 and 1995, respectively. The latter is the west window which depicts royal coats of arms, and was designed by John Lawson and made by Goddard &amp; Gibbs. In 2013, two new stained glass windows designed by Hughie O&#x27;Donoghue were installed on either side of the East Window.
The apse of the chapel contains the altar, and behind that, the tombs of Henry VII and his wife as well as of James I. There are five apsidal chapels. These chapels originally contained altars—they were screened off and intended for private prayer for members of the royal family—but their dedication is no longer known.

Upon entering the chapel, one passes through a set of bronze gates, which are elaborately crafted and “illustrate the…intense determination of Henry VII to put to the forefront every possible indication of his claims to the crown of England.” The gates are decorated with numerous royal crests that serve to legitimize his rule. Once inside, the mahogany stalls stand out to the viewer as they contrast with the light colored stone of the walls and ceiling. The stalls also contribute the verticality of the interior. They date from different times; while some are original others were added later to accommodate the increasing number of Knights of the Order of the Bath. The stalls were designated for all living Knights of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath. When a knight was installed, he received a stall that was subsequently adorned with his crest, coat of arms, and heraldic banner, the last of which remained in the chapel even after the knight&#x27;s death. These banners all remain to decorate the chapel. During the nineteenth century, there were too many knights to accommodate in the chapel and no more were installed until the twentieth century. Currently, only the most senior knights are assigned stalls in the chapel.

The altar and Henry VII&#x27;s tomb were crafted by the same Italian artist, Pietro Torrigiano. The Henry VII tomb was created first, beginning in 1512. The tomb was sculpted by a Florentine Renaissance artist, thus, the style is atypical of English art. The putti on the corners are particularly uncharacteristic. The altar was begun in 1517, but Torrigiano left the country before it was completed; Benedetto da Rovezzano finished its construction in 1526. Originally made of terracotta, white marble, and gilt bronze, it was destroyed during the Commonwealth. The current altar is based on images of the original. Two surviving pillars and two newly constructed ones support the reconstructed altar. Also significant are the aforementioned sculptures that adorn the triforium. The statues are of saints and the Apostles. According to Lindley, that “Henry VII’s will declares his trust in...‘Aungels, Archaungels, Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostels, Evangelists, Martirs, Confessours and Virgyns’” is critical to understanding his motivation in building the chapel: “Henry’s belief in the efficacy of ‘mediacions and prayers’ in his progress through purgatory is crucial to his purpose.” That is to say, he built the chapel and adorned it with numerous sculptures of important religious figures in part to ensure his acceptance into Heaven.

<doc id="708954" wikidata="Q3067635" url="?curid=708954" title="National Law School of India University">
<text>The National Law School of India University (NLSIU), commonly referred to as the National Law School (NLS), is a public state law university established under the National Law School of India Act, 1986, enacted by the Karnataka Legislative Assembly. Located in Bangalore, India, it is widely regarded as one of the country’s leading institutions for legal education and has consistently been ranked first in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) for law.

The University offers a five-year undergraduate Bachelor of Arts–Bachelor of Laws programme (BA LLB) and a one-year LLM programme. Entrance to these programmes is through the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT).

Additionally, the University has an undergraduate Bachelor of Arts (Honours) programme, a three-year LLB (Honours) postgraduate programme, a two-year Master’s Programme in Public Policy, and doctoral degrees in law and social sciences, humanities and public policy.

Spread over a lush 23 acres, the campus houses India&#x27;s largest legal library and hosts some of the country&#x27;s well-known competitions and events, including the &quot;NLS Debate&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Fields festival.&quot;

The NLSIU is the only Indian institute to have won the Philip C. Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition, having done so in 1999 and 2013. Furthermore, 25 alumni have been Rhodes scholars.

== History ==
The National Law School was founded after two decades of work by lawyers including former Chief Justice Mohammad Hidayatullah, Ram Jethmalani and Upendra Baxi, who petitioned the Legal Education Committee of the Bar Council of India to establish a university to rival Harvard Law School. Subsequently, the Bar Council of India Trust and Government of Karnataka reached an agreement to found the first National Law University in Bangalore. In 1986, the National Law University of India was established under the leadership of its founder, then Vice-Chancellor N. R. Madhava Menon.

Menon ensured that the teaching at the university was based on the case method at Harvard rather than the traditional lecture format that was then rampant across Indian law schools. He also introduced to the university the concept of collaborative teaching, wherein more than one professor would conduct classes, with different professors taking and arguing contradictory positions in jurisprudence.

The first batch of undergraduate law students were enrolled in 1 July 1988. Classes commenced before the school&#x27;s buildings had been fully constructed, with lessons delivered at the Central College of Bangalore University until November 1991. Thereafter, the school moved to its current location in the Nagarbhavi suburb.

In 1995, the first UNHCR Chair for Refugee Law was inaugurated at NLSIU, which serves as the Asian Centre for Refugee Law. Professor N. Subramanya worked on key issues pertaining to refugees during his tenure.

== Administration ==
The Chief Justice of India is the Visitor and de facto Chancellor of the school, with the ability to adjudicate and advise the operations of the school. The Vice-Chancellor of the school is the chief executive of the university and manages the day-to-day operations of the school. The school has had five more Vice-Chancellors since Menon, namely N. L. Mitra, A. Jayagovind, G. Mohan Gopal, R. Venkata Rao, and Sudhir Krishnaswamy, who took over in 2019.

The administration of the school is governed by the General Council, Executive Council, Academic Council, and Finance Council. These Councils comprise key figures from the Government of Karnataka, the Chief Justice of India, the Chairman of the Bar Council of India, Judges of the Supreme Court of India, the Advocate General of Karnataka, as well as Ministers and Secretaries from the Karnataka State Government. Additionally, distinguished legal scholars contribute to the governance of the institution.

== Admissions ==
Admissions to the 5-year undergraduate BA LLB (Hons) programme are based on the Common Law Admission Test-undergraduate (CLAT-UG). For the 2023-24 session of the undergraduate CLAT, a total of 56,472 students competed for 2644 total law seats, out of which 240 were offered at the NLSIU. In 2020, the NLSIU attempted to withdraw from the CLAT, announcing that it would hold its own entrance examination. This decision was soon overturned by the Supreme Court of India.

The postgraduate version of the CLAT screens candidates for the Master of Laws Programme. CLAT is administered by the Consortium of NLUs.

Candidates of the NLS BA (Hons), three-year LLB (Hons), Master of Public Policy, and Doctor of Philosophy are screened by the National Law School Admission Tests (NLSAT) conducted by NLSIU.

In June 2021, the NLSIU announced a plan to increase the number of students enrolled on campus from 660 in 2021 to 2,200 in 2028, led by increasing the batch sizes of the BA-LLB cohort and the establishing of a three-year LLB course.

The NLSIU has preserved 25% of seats for home students of Karnataka across admissions, but the Government of Karnataka has reservations on the manner in which this policy has been implemented.

==Academics ==

=== Undergraduate ===
The NLSIU offers graduates a five-year integrated BA/LLB which qualifies the student to sit for the bar in India. The curriculum consists of a blend of social science and law subjects. In the first two years, students attend courses in history, political science, sociology and economics, alongside legal subjects such as tort, contract and constitutional law. In the subsequent three years, students mainly study legal subjects.

In 2017, NLSIU overhauled its academic curriculum to allow students to choose a greater number of their upper-year courses, allowing students to explore areas of interest to a greater degree.

In 2025, the university introduced a three-year BA (Hons) programme with the option of an additional fourth year for research. The NLS BA (Hons.) Programme offers every student the option of electing a major-minor combination, or a double major. The majors and minors will be in the same areas/disciplines that are currently taught within the BA LLB (Hons.) programme. These disciplines are: 1) History, 2) Sociology &amp; Anthropology, 3) Economics, and 4) Politics.

=== Postgraduate ===
NLSIU launched a three-year LLB programme in 2022, making it the first National Law University to do so.

The school offers a one-year LLM by coursework, a two-year MPP, and doctorate programmes in law and social sciences, humanities and public policy. .

In addition to the above full-time programmes, the school&#x27;s Professional And Continuing Education (PACE) department offers several part-time distance learning programmes, including a Masters in Business Law and postgraduate diplomas in various fields.

===Rankings===
National Law School of India is widely considered the best law school in India. The National Institutional Ranking Framework ranked the institute first in its law ranking of 2023 and 2024, as did &quot;India Today&quot; &quot;India&#x27;s Best Colleges 2023: Law&quot;, and &quot;Outlook India&quot;″s &quot;Top 13 Government Law Institutes&quot; of 2023.

=== Narayan Rao Melgiri Memorial National Law Library ===
The NLSIU&#x27;s Narayan Rao Melgiri Memorial National Law Library is the largest law library in the country, housing a collection of over 50,000 books and 20,000 journals. It is named after Narayan Rao Melgiri, a lawyer in Gadag. The Melgiri Library was inaugurated by Chief Justice of India Ramesh Chandra Lahoti in 2005, and was funded by contributions from the University Grants Commission (India) and Sudha Murthy, chairperson of the Infosys Foundation and granddaughter of Melgiri.

In 2023, Chief Justice of India Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud and Bhutan Princess Sonam Dechen Wangchuck inaugurated a renovated library building, which now includes a number of accessibility features, including braille printers, screen readers, and desktop magnifiers.

==Student activities==

===Student Bar Association===
The Student Bar Association (SBA) is the umbrella body that coordinates all student activities. All students are &quot;de facto&quot; members of the SBA. The SBA oversees twelve activity-based committees (ABCs) that manage specific student activities. Institutional events include the Spiritus sports festival, Strawberry Fields music festival, the NLS-Trilegal International Arbitration Moot, the NLS Negotiation and Mediation Competition, and the Admit One theater festival. Students also run the publication of Quirk, an online magazine at NLSIU.

===Competitive debating===
NLSIU plays an active role in promoting parliamentary style debate in India. The school regularly participates in international competitions and is currently the highest-ranking Indian team in the debating world rankings.

NLSIU reached the ESL Finals in 2002 and in 2007 at the World Universities Debating Championship. It also recently won the 15th All Asian Debating Championships held in Dhaka in 2008. NLSIU was the first South Asian team to reach the second round of the Cambridge University Debate Competition. All three NLSIU teams reached the semi-finals in the inaugural Asians BP Tournament held in Chulalongkorn University, with two out of the top ten speakers being from the university. The school has also reached the semi-finals of the United Asian Debating Championships 2010.

Beginning in 2002, the NLSIU has hosted South Asia&#x27;s largest parliamentary debate competition, the National Law School Debate. In 2011, the NLSIU launched the NLS Union Debate and the NLS Debate Junior. Christ Junior College also organised a debate with NLS in 2011.

===Moot court competitions===
The NLSIU is the only law school in South Asia to have won the Philip C. Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition twice, in 1999 and 2013. It also reached the Jessup finals in 2018. The university has also won the Monroe E. Price Media Law Moot Court Competition at the University of Oxford in 2021. NLSIU has also won the Manfred Lachs Space Law Moot Court competition in 2009, 2012 and most recently in 2017.

<text>Triglav ( &quot;Three-headed one&quot;) was the chief god of the Pomeranian and probably some of the Polabian Slavs, worshipped in Szczecin, Wolin and probably Brenna (now Brandenburg). His cult is attested to in several biographies of the bishop St. Otto of Bamberg in the years immediately preceding his suppression of it in 1127. 

== Sources and history ==
In Latin records, this theonym is noted as , , , , , .

Information about Triglav comes from three sources, the oldest being &quot;Life of Saint Otto, Bishop of Bamberg&quot; () by an anonymous monk from Prüfening Abbey, written by 1146, the second source is the 1151 &quot;Life of Saint Otto, Bishop of Bamberg&quot; by the monk , the third is &quot;Dialog on the Life of Saint Otto of Bamberg&quot; by the monk , written around 1158-1159. These sources are biographies of St. Otto of Bamberg and describe his Christianization missions among the Baltic Slavs.

=== First mission ===
Otto, after receiving permission from Pope Callistus II, goes to Pomerania to Christianize. The bishop first arrives in Wolin (according to Anonymous on August 4, according to Ebo on August 13, 1124). Anonymous describes the local cult of &quot;Julius Caesar&#x27;s spear.&quot; However, the Wolinians refuse to accept the new religion and force Otto to leave the city; he goes to Szczecin. Herbord reports that Otto, after periodically hiding in the city, began Christianization on November 1, after receiving security guarantees from Boleslav III. An anonymous monk briefly introduces the cult of Triglav and the destruction of his temple and statue: in the city there were supposed to be two richly decorated temples () not far from each other that housed images of the gods, where the god Triglav was worshipped. One of the temples held a gilded and silver-plated saddle belonging to the god, as well as a well-built horse, which was used during prophecies: several spears were spread on the ground and the horse was led between them – if the horse, steered by the god, did not touch any spear with its foot, it meant good fortune and a good prediction for the upcoming battle or journey. Eventually, on Otto&#x27;s orders, the temples were destroyed and the offerings distributed to the inhabitants. The bishop single-handedly destroyed the wooden statue of Triglav, taking only three silver-plated wooden heads from the statue, which he sent to the pope as proof that the residents had been baptized. According to Herbord, there were four temples in Szczecin, including one richly decorated with paintings of people and animals, dedicated to the Triglav. Gold and silver &quot;kraters,&quot; bull&#x27;s horns decorated with precious stones that were drunk from or used as instruments, as well as swords, knives and furniture were dedicated to the god. The horse used during divination was black in color.

Ebo then goes on to describe how the priests of Wolin carted away the golden statue of Triglav to save it from destruction:&lt;poem&gt;
And when the pious Otto destroyed the temples and the images of the idols, the pagan priests stole the golden image of Triglav, which they worshipped as the most important, smuggled it out of the province and delivered it to the safekeeping of a widow who lived on a modest farm, where there was no danger that anybody would come in search of it. Once they had taken this gift to her, she looked after it as if it were the apple of her eye and guarded that pagan idol in the following manner: after making a hole in the trunk of a large tree, she placed the image of Triglav therein, wrapped in a blanket and nobody was allowed to see it, much less touch it; only a small hole was left open in the trunk through which to insert the sacrifice and nobody entered that house unless it was to perform the rituals of the pagan sacrifices [...] And thus, Hermann bought himself a cap and a tunic in the Slavic style and, after many dangers along a difficult road, when he reached the house of that widow, declared that he had not long since succeeded in escaping from the tempestuous jaws of the sea thanks to the invocation of his god Triglav, and that he therefore wished to offer him the sacrifice promised for his salvation and that he had arrived there, led by him, following a miraculous order through unknown stretches of the road. And she says: “If you have been sent by him, I have here the altar which contains our god, enclosed in the hole made in an oak. You may not see him nor touch him, but rather, prostrating yourself before the trunk, take note from a prudent distance of the small hole where you must place the sacrifice you wish to make. And after offering it, once the orifice is reverently closed, go and, if you value your life, do not reveal this conversation to anybody”. He entered joyfully in that place and threw a silver drachma into the hole, so that it would appear, from the sound of the metal, that he had offered a sacrifice. But after throwing it in, he took back out what he had thrown and, by way of homage to Triglav, he offered him a humiliation, specifically, a large gob of spit as a sacrifice. Afterwards, he looked carefully to see if there was any possibility of carrying out the mission for which he had been sent there and he realised that the image of Triglav had been placed in the trunk so carefully and firmly that it could not be taken out or even moved. Whereby, afflicted by no small sorrow, he asked himself anxiously what he should do, saying to himself: “Woe! Why have I travelled so fruitlessly such a long journey by sea! What shall I say to my lord or who will believe that I was here, if I return empty-handed?” And looking around him, he saw Triglav’s saddle hanging nearby on the wall: this was extremely old and now served no purpose and, immediately rushing towards it, he tears the hapless trophy off the wall, hides it and, leaving in the early evening, he hurries to meet up with his lord and his men, tells them what he had done and shows Triglav’s saddle as proof of his loyalty. And thus, the Apostle of the Pomeranians, after holding council with his companions, came to the conclusion that that they should desist in their undertaking, unless it should appear that they were driven less by a zeal for justice than by a greed for gold. After summoning and gathering the tribal chieftains and the elders, they demanded, by means of a solemn oath, that they abandon their cult to Triglav and that, once the image was broken, all of its gold would be used to redeem captives.
– Ebo, &quot; Life of Saint Otto, Bishop of Bamberg&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;
Otto then demanded that the inhabitants abandon the cult of Triglav. Then Otto established two Wolin churches: one in the city, dedicated to St. Adalbert and St. Wenceslas, and the other outside the city, large and beautiful, St. Peter&#x27;s Temple. On March 28, 1125, Otto returns to his Archdiocese of Bamberg.

=== Second mission ===
Soon afterwards, some Wolinians and Stettinians returned to their native faith, as Ebo describes: In Wolin, the inhabitants, after burning idols during the first Christianization mission, began to create new statues decorated with gold and silver, and celebrated the feast of deities. For this, the Christian God was to punish them with fire from heaven. He further states:
&lt;poem&gt;
Stettin, a big city, larger than Wollin, had three hills in its jurisdiction; the middle one of these, which was also the highest, was dedicated to Triglav, the most important god of the pagans. Its statue had three heads and its eyes and lips were covered with a golden bandage. About the idols, the priests said that their most important god had three heads because it ruled three kingdoms, namely, heaven, earth, and hell, and that its face was covered with a bandage so that it might ignore the sins of men as it did not see them and was silent.
– Ebo, &quot; Life of Saint Otto, Bishop of Bamberg&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;
There was once an epidemic in the city, which the priests believed was sent by the gods as punishment for abandoning their faith, and that they should start offering sacrifices to the gods if they wanted to survive. Since then, pagan rituals and sacrifices began to be performed again in Szczecin, and Christian temples began to decline.

In April 1127, Otto returns to Pomerania to continue his Christianization mission. In May and June, he carries out Christianization in Wolgast and Gützkow, and on July 31 he returns to Szczecin. Further, Ebo and Herbord report that pagan places of worship were destroyed, and that Christianization continued.

=== Other potential sources ===
It is possible that the cult Triglav was mentioned by the 13th-century writer , who was well informed about the battles for Brenna in the mid-12th century, according to whom a three-headed deity was worshipped in the stronghold, but he does not give its name.

Some authors believe that Adam of Bremen&#x27;s information about &quot;Neptune&quot; worshipped in Wolin may refer to the Triglav.

== Legacy ==

Scholars have tried to find any references to the Triglav beyond the Polabia and Pomerania. In this context, Mount &quot;Triglav&quot; in Slovenia and the legend associated with it are often mentioned: &quot;the first to appear from the water was the high mountain Triglav&quot;, although Marko Snoj, for example, found the mountain&#x27;s connection to a god unlikely. Aleksander Gieysztor, following , cites the &quot;Triglav&quot; stone near Ptuj, whose name was mentioned in 1322.

There is a village &quot;Trzygłów&quot; in Poland, but it is within the range of the Szczecinian cult. In northwestern Poland, folklorists have collected a number of local legends, according to which the statue of Triglav taken from Wolin was supposed to be hidden in the village of Gryfice, in Świętoujść on Wolin, in Tychowo under the erratic boulder &quot;Trygław&quot;, or in (&quot;Trzygłów&#x27;s Lake&quot;).

== In archaeology ==
The Hill on which Szczecin&#x27;s temple to Triglav was located was most likely identical to Castle Hill. At the top of the Hill there was supposed to be a circle surrounded by a ditch, which was originally a sacred circle (from the 8th century), later a temple of Triglav was built there, and later a Christian temple.

Brandenburg&#x27;s &quot;Mound of Triglav&quot; is located about 0.5 kilometers from the fortress located on the island. A bronze horse, iron and decorative objects, including a lot of pottery, were discovered in the stronghold, indicating its importance and that an extensive religious cult may have been associated with it.

== Interpretations ==
=== The chthonic God ===
According to Aleksander Gieysztor, it should be considered that Triglav was a tribal god, separate from Perun, as indicated by Herbord&#x27;s information that in Szczecin, in addition to temples, the place of worship included an oak tree and a spring, which are attributes of the thunder god. Gieysztor recognizes that Triglav was a god close to the chthonic Veles. According to him, this interpretation is supported by the fact that a black horse was sacrificed to Triglav, while Svetovit, interpreted by him as a Polabian hypostasis of Perun, received a white horse as sacrifice.

Andrzej Szyjewski also recognizes Triglav as a chthonic god. He mentions the opinions of some researchers that the names &quot;Volos&quot; (&quot;Veles&quot;), &quot;Vologost&quot;, &quot;Volyn&quot; and &quot;Wolin&quot; are related to each other, and Herbord&#x27;s information that &quot;Pluto&quot; – the Greek god of death – was worshipped in Wolin.

=== Trinity ===

According to Jiří Dynda, Triglav may have been a three-headed god who combined the three gods responsible for Earth, Heaven, Underworld. In doing so, he cites the pass of &quot;Neptune&quot; worshipped in Wolin and links this to Slovenian traditions regarding Mount Triglav, a three-leveled idol from Zbruch, a Wolin&#x27;s sacred spear attached to a pole, and an oak tree with a spring which, according to Dynda, corresponds to the Norse Yggdrasil and the wells beneath it, and the hiding of the god&#x27;s statue in the tree all of which are said to be connected to the &quot;Axis mundi&quot;. Dynda proposes the following interpretations:

# Relationship to Heaven: Triglav has his mouth and eyes covered to &quot;not see or hear the sins of men.&quot; In Indo-European mythologies, &quot;dark&quot; gods have a vision problem: Odin, Velnias, Varuna, Lugh. However, the blindfolds on the eyes of Triglav can be linked to the Sun in the context of &quot;paradoxical mutilation&quot; – a principle concerning some Indo-European deities proposed by Georges Dumézil – the Greek sun god Helios is called &quot;[he], who sees everything and hears everything&quot;; the Vedic Surya is called &quot;all-seeing&quot; or &quot;men-watching.&quot;
# Relationship to Earth: a description of the difficult journey to find the god&#x27;s statue and his &quot;rulership of three kingdoms.&quot; This may correspond to Hermes, the god of roads and paths, who is sometimes described as &quot;three-formed&quot; or &quot;three-headed,&quot; and the three-headed Hecate who is the protector of the crossroads and who was given a piece of sea, land and sky to rule equally from Zeus.
# The connection to the Underworld: the comparison of the Triglav to Neptune. This is supposed to correspond to Indo-European beliefs that the afterlife is beyond the Sea; in a Slavic context, this may correspond to a Czech text in which a man wishes his malicious dead wife to turn into a goose and &quot;fly somewhere beyond the sea to Veles&quot; with Veles being usually interpreted as god of death.

=== Alleged influence of Christianity ===

According to Henryk Lowmianski, the Triglav originated in Christianity – in the Middle Ages the Holy Trinity was depicted with three faces, which was later taken over by pagans in the form of a three-headed deity. However, this view cannot be accepted, since the depiction of the Holy Trinity with three faces is attested only from the 14th century, and the official condemnation by the Pope from 1628. The depiction of the Holy Trinity with three faces itself may be of pagan origin (Balkans).

According to Stanislaw Rosik, Christianity may have influenced the development of the Triglav cult in its declining phase. The significance may have been that for the Slavs the Christian God was a &quot;German god,&quot; associated with a different ethnic group, but known from neighborly contacts and the later coexistence of the cult of Jesus and the Triglav (the so-called &quot;doublefaith&quot;). As pagans understood it, they linked the power of the deity to the military-political strength of the tribe in question, so the Pomeranians reckoned with a new deity, and the monolatrous (or henotheistic) worship of Triglav may have fostered his identification with Jesus on the basis of &quot;interpretatio Slavica&quot;. Such an alignment of religiosity fostered a later highlighting of the separateness of Jesus and Triglav, in accordance with Christian theology, and further demonization of Triglav after the final christianisation of Pomerania, which perhaps finds an outlet in the 15th-century &quot;Liber sancti Jacobi&quot;, where Triglav is referred to as &quot;the enemy of mankind&quot; and &quot;the god or rather the devil.&quot;

== In culture ==
* Manuscript by Bronislaw Trentowski: With the word &quot;Halu&quot; Jessa created the world and all that existed in it. Therefore Triglav, having heard it, tore off his three heads, and from the blood that flowed from them arose hosts of three successive deities.
* It is possible that the Triglav was already depicted in 12th-century French epic, along with Muhammad, as a pagan enemy of Christianity (in Old French: &quot;Mahomet et Tervagnan&quot;). However, it&#x27;s also possible that this name was derived from Hermes Trismegistus, or from an &quot;occitanization&quot; of a vulgar Latin present participle from &quot;terrificans&quot; (&quot;terrifying&quot;).

<text>Mary White was a lifeboat based in Broadstairs, Kent, England, named in 1851 after the completion of an heroic rescue of a brig, the &quot;Mary White&quot;.

&quot;Mary White&quot; with her sister boat, &quot;Culmer White&quot;, took part in the rescue of &quot;Northern Belle&quot; in January 1857. &quot;Northern Belle&quot; was a US transatlantic ship which ran aground near Thanet in blizzard conditions. &quot;Culmer White&quot; and &quot;Mary White&quot; made repeated trips to the damaged &quot;Belle&quot; and saved the entire crew.

<text>The Defenders is an American courtroom drama television series that ran on CBS from 1961 to 1965. It was created by television writer Reginald Rose, and stars E. G. Marshall and Robert Reed as father-and-son defense attorneys Lawrence and Kenneth Preston. Original music for the series was scored by Frank Lewin and Leonard Rosenman. The series was spun off from the &quot;Studio One&quot; episode &quot;The Defender&quot;, which starred Ralph Bellamy and William Shatner as the Prestons.

This series is not related to the 2010s CBS series of the same name.

==Plot==
Lawrence Preston (Marshall) and Kenneth Preston (Reed) are father-and-son defense attorneys who specialized in legally complex cases, with defendants such as neo-Nazis, conscientious objectors, demonstrators of the Civil Rights Movement, a schoolteacher fired for being an atheist, an author accused of pornography, and a physician charged in a mercy killing.

==Cast==

*E. G. Marshall as Lawrence Preston
*Robert Reed as Kenneth Preston
*Polly Rowles as Helen Donaldson, the Prestons&#x27; secretary (24 episodes 1961–1962)
*Joan Hackett as Joan Miller, Kenneth&#x27;s girlfriend (5 episodes 1961–1962)

Several other actors appeared numerous times throughout the series. John Boruff, J.D. Cannon, Lonnie Chapman, and Ossie Davis each appeared in eight episodes; Walter Klavun appeared in seven episodes; Marc Connelly, Robert Gerringer, Murray Hamilton, Judson Laire, Kermit Murdock, Frank Overton, Lester Rawlins, and Dolph Sweet each appeared six times; and Simon Oakland, William Shatner (who had starred as Kenneth Preston in the original Studio One episode), and six others each appeared in five episodes.

==Episodes==

==Production==
===Development===
The series was a slight reworking of Rose&#x27;s 1957 two-part drama, &quot;The Defender&quot;, from the anthology series &quot;Studio One&quot;. In the original program, Ralph Bellamy played the father and William Shatner played his son. Shatner guest-starred in various roles in the later series, and the original drama later was incorporated into an episode of his series, &quot;Boston Legal&quot;.

According to creator Reginald Rose, &quot;the law is the subject of our programs: not crime, not mystery, not the courtroom for its own sake. We were never interested in producing a &#x27;who-done-it&#x27; which simply happened to be resolved each week in a flashy courtroom battle of wits.&quot; And unlike &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, which also ran on CBS, victory was &quot;far from certain on &quot;The Defenders&quot;—as were morality and justice.&quot;

Topics featured in the series included abortion, capital punishment, &quot;no-knock&quot; searches, custody rights of adoptive parents, the insanity defense, the &quot;poisoned fruit doctrine,&quot; immigration quotas, the Hollywood blacklist, jury nullification, and Cold War visa restrictions.

Writers for the show included Rose in many early episodes, with later episodes by Albert &quot;Al&quot; Ruben and Ernest Kinoy – both Jewish Americans holding socially liberal views. It was thought the move to “ratings graveyard” Thursday nights after a successful prime time reign on Saturday evenings, was a conservative corporate device to force the socially conscious program into cancellation, which it ultimately did.

===Controversial episodes===
A 1962 episode entitled &quot;The Benefactor&quot;—in which the father–son legal team defended an abortion care provider—was the most controversial; all of the series&#x27; three regular advertisers (Brown &amp; Williamson, Lever Brothers, and Kimberly-Clark) refused to sponsor the episode, so it was only transmitted after a last-minute sponsor was found, Speidel, for a discounted advertising rate. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation banned this episode when it was first shown on April 28. In 2008, this incident was used as the basis for a second season episode of the drama &quot;Mad Men&quot;, set in the 1960s.

The December 7, 1963 episode, &quot;Climate of Evil,&quot; was originally titled &quot;The Gentle Assassin&quot; but was changed two weeks earlier in the aftermath of the John F. Kennedy assassination. In addition, the January 4, 1964 episode, &quot;Clare Cheval Died in Boston,&quot; was originally scheduled for the weekend of the assassination, and subsequently had reference to &quot;President Kennedy&quot; deleted from the episode.

===Broadcast history===
Note: The most frequent time slot for the series is in bold text.

* Saturday at 8:30–9:30 p.m. on CBS: September 16, 1961 – May 25, 1963; November 30, 1963 – June 27, 1964
* Saturday at 9:00–10:00 p.m. on CBS: September 28 – November 16, 1963
* Thursday at 10:00–11:00 p.m. on CBS: September 24, 1964 – May 13, 1965

==Reception==
===Awards===
&quot;The Defenders&quot; won 14 Primetime Emmy Awards (including three in a row for Outstanding Drama Series) and received an additional eight nominations.
The Museum of Broadcast Communications called it &quot;perhaps the most socially conscious series the medium has ever seen&quot;, a show &quot;singularly resonant with New Frontier liberalism&quot;.

In 2002, &quot;The Defenders&quot; was ranked #31 on TV Guide&#x27;s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time, and in 2013 &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked it #8 in its list of The 60 Greatest Dramas of All Time, while the Writers Guild of America ranked it – and &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; – #84 on their list of the 101 Best Written TV Series.

===Ratings===
* 1961–1962: #26 (22.4)
* 1962–1963: #18 (23.9)
* 1963–1964: N/A
* 1964–1965: N/A

As a top 30 series, &quot;The Defenders&quot; has an average rating of 23.2.

==Home media==
On July 12, 2016, Shout! Factory released the complete first season on DVD in Region 1.

==Sequel and spin-offs==
A re-envisioned version of the series aired on the Showtime network in 1997 as a trilogy of television films. Still called &quot;The Defenders&quot;, it featured E. G. Marshall in his original role as Lawrence Preston. However, the three Showtime films focused on Beau Bridges as Don Preston, a previously unmentioned second son of Lawrence, and Martha Plimpton as M.J., the daughter of Ken Preston, who is said to have died (as had Reed in 1992). Don and M.J. worked as lawyers and carried on the family legacy. However, Marshall died after the completion of the second episode (&quot;Choice of Evils&quot;). Production was halted, and the remaining episode, &quot;Taking the First,&quot; aired as a movie special in 1998.
==References in other media==

The second season of &quot;Mad Men&quot; contains an episode named &quot;The Benefactor&quot; that featured a brief clip from &quot;The Defenders&quot;″ episode of the same name. In the &quot;Mad Men&quot; episode, the Sterling Cooper advertising agency is trying to secure sponsors for &quot;The Defenders&quot;″ episode, which contains a plot involving abortion (originally telecast on April 28, 1962), after the regular sponsors pulled out because they claimed the episode (and subject matter) was too controversial. The episode also offers a fictional backstory for the episode; that it was written for the third season of the series but rejected by the network for the usage of abortion as a plotline. The following season, the writers produced a script that revolved around the theme of cannibalism but the episode was rejected by the director who was assigned to film the episode due to the content. The director&#x27;s refusal led to the network being forced to film the abortion-centric script, which an executive assigned to find advertisers for the show proclaims was the plan all along.

In his memoir, Randy Barnett, a law professor at Georgetown, credits watching &quot;The Defenders&quot; as a child as the inspiration for him to enter the legal profession.

<doc id="708961" wikidata="Q7561165" url="?curid=708961" title="Song of the Mary White">
<text>&quot;Song of the &quot;Mary White&quot;&quot; is a ballad written in Broadstairs, England in the early 1850s.
It has been suggested that news of the loss of the Irish packet &quot;Royal Adelaide&quot; with 250 lives, on the sands off Margate on 6 April 1850, prompted Thomas White to present one of his lifeboats to his home town of Broadstairs that summer. The lifeboat saw its first use on 6 March 1851, when the brig &quot;Mary White&quot; became trapped on the Goodwin Sands during a severe gale blowing from the north. A ballad was written to celebrate the occasion, the &quot;Song of the &quot;Mary White&quot;&quot;.

The lifeboat itself was subsequently named the &quot;Mary White&quot; in recognition of the strange coincidence of the recurrence of the name White in this story: Thomas and John the lifeboat builders, the name of the brig &quot;Mary White&quot;, and also the name of its captain, Mr White.

==Lyrics==
:Come all you jolly sailors bold, and landsmen too, attend,
:I am inclined to sing in praise of those eight gallant men,
:who boldly left their native shore as you shall understand,
:to save the lives of those poor souls upon the Goodwin Sand.

:&quot;Chorus&quot; 
:Britons all, both young and old, think of those jolly sailors bold.

:On Thursday, &#x27;twas March the sixth, the wind blew from the land
:which drove the fated &quot;Mary White&quot; upon the Goodwin Sands.
:The lifeboat&#x27;s crew from Broadstairs flew, with hearts so light and gay,
:Right gallantly they made the wreck, those precious lives to save.

:&quot;Chorus&quot;

:John Crouch, a gallant sailor bold, likewise George Castle too,
:George Wales, Richard Crouch, this day, my praise is due to you
:Sol Holbourn, Sackett Ansel, John Wales, with great delight
:So gallantly did venture off to save the &quot;Mary White&quot;.

:&quot;Chorus&quot;

:Ned Chittingden, 17 your health I drink, I drink with thee,
:Times three and for your valour, my brave men, you shall rewarded be.

:&quot;Chorus&quot;

:You&#x27;ve done your best, and saved the lives of seven poor souls this day;
:May God receive the other three who did get cast away.

:&quot;Chorus&quot;

:So to conclude and finish now, my song is at an end,
:May God above a blessing give to those eight gallant men!
:&quot;Chorus&quot;

<text>State Roads in the U.S. state of Indiana are numbered rationally: in general, odd one-digit and two-digit highways are north–south highways, numbers increasing toward the west; even one-digit and two-digit highways are east-west highways, numbers increasing toward the south, the opposite of the Interstate Highway System. Three-digit highways are related, as a rule, to the single-digit or two-digit parent US or State Road; thus State Road 205 (SR 205) is related to SR 5, and SR 120 is related to U.S. Highway 20 (US 20).

Exceptions to this system are SR 37, SR 47, SR 56, SR 57, SR 62, and SR 67, diagonal routes, the defunct SR 100 beltline around Indianapolis, SR 135 (which acts like a two-digit state highway), and both SR 149 and SR 249 (which are arterials between SR 49 and SR 51). Another exception to the system was SR 265; this highway was an extension that existed between Interstate 265 (I-265) and I-65 and is over east of either SR 65 or SR 165, both located in Southwestern Indiana near Evansville. With the completion of the Lewis and Clark Bridge Indiana 265 now exists as a part of Interstate 265.

The numbers of several important U.S. Highways that travel through Indiana are not used as State Road numbers: these include 6, 12, 20, 24, 27, 30, 31, 33, 35, 36, 40, 41, 50, and 52. US 40, in fact, roughly corresponds in location to where &quot;SR 40&quot; would be; SR 38 is north of it and SR 42 is south of it. US 6 is located similarly, and, in fact, follows the general course of former SR 6.

<text>Stellaria is a genus of about 190 species of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae, with a cosmopolitan distribution. Common names include starwort, stitchwort and chickweed.

==Description==
&quot;Stellaria&quot; species are relatively small herbs with simple opposite leaves. It produces small flowers with 5 sepals and 5 white petals each usually deeply cleft, or none at all, all free. Stamens 10 or fewer.

===Uses===
Some species, including &quot;Stellaria media&quot; which is widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere, are used as leaf vegetables, often raw in salads. This is a favored food of finches and many other seed-eating birds.

Chickweeds are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including angle shades, heart and dart, riband wave, setaceous Hebrew character and the &quot;Coleophora&quot; case-bearers &quot;C. coenosipennella&quot; (feeds exclusively on &quot;Stellaria&quot; species), &quot;C. lineolea&quot; (recorded on &quot;S. graminea&quot;), &quot;C. lithargyrinella&quot; (recorded on &quot;S. holostea&quot;), &quot;C. solitariella&quot; (feeds exclusively on &quot;S. holostea&quot;) and &quot;C. striatipennella&quot;.

Several closely related plants referred to as chickweed, but which lack the culinary properties of plants in the genus &quot;Stellaria&quot;, include members of the genus &quot;Cerastium&quot;, of similar appearance to &quot;Stellaria&quot; and also in the (Caryophyllaceae).

<doc id="708970" wikidata="Q321936" url="?curid=708970" title="Taif Agreement">
<text>The 1989 Taif Agreement (, ), officially known as the (&quot;)&quot;, was reached to provide &quot;the basis for the ending of the civil war and the return to political normalcy in Lebanon&quot;. Negotiated in Taif, Saudi Arabia, it was designed to end the 15 year-long Lebanese Civil War, and reassert the Lebanese government&#x27;s authority in southern Lebanon, which was controlled at the time by the Christian-separatist South Lebanon Army under the occupational hegemony of Israel. Though the agreement set a time frame for withdrawal of Syrian military forces from Lebanon, stipulating that the Syrian occupation end within two years, Syria did not withdraw its forces from the country until 2005. It was signed on 22 October 1989 and ratified by the Lebanese parliament on 5 November, 1989.

==Overview==
The treaty was fathered by the Speaker of the Parliament Hussein El-Husseini and negotiated in Ta&#x27;if, Saudi Arabia, by the surviving members of Lebanon&#x27;s 1972 parliament. The agreement came into effect with the active mediation of Saudi Arabia, discreet participation by the United States, and behind-the-scenes influence from Syria.

The agreement covered political reform, the ending of the Lebanese Civil War, the establishment of special relations between Lebanon and Syria, and a framework for the beginning of complete Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon. Since Rafik Hariri was a former Saudi diplomatic representative, he played a significant role in constructing the Taif Agreement. It is also argued that the Taif Accord reoriented Lebanon toward the Arab world, especially Syria. In other words, the Taif Accord positioned Lebanon as a country with &quot;an Arab identity and belonging.&quot; The agreement was finalized and confirmed only after the development of an anti-Saddam Hussein international alliance. The alliance included Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria, France, Iran and the United States.

The agreement formed the principle of &quot;mutual coexistence&quot; () between Lebanon&#x27;s different sects and their &quot;proper political representation&quot; () as the main objective of post-civil war parliamentary electoral laws. It also restructured the National Pact political system in Lebanon by transferring some of the power away from the Maronite Christian community, which had been given a privileged status in Lebanon under the period of French rule. Prior to the agreement, the Sunni Muslim Prime Minister was appointed by and responsible to the Maronite President. After the Taif agreement the Prime Minister was responsible to the legislature, as in a traditional parliamentary system. Therefore, the agreement changed the power-sharing formula that had favoured the Christians to a 50:50 ratio and enhanced the powers of the Sunni Prime Minister over those of the Christian president. Prior to the Taif negotiations, a Maronite Christian, General Michel Aoun, had been appointed Prime Minister by President Amine Gemayel on 22 September 1988. This had caused a serious political crisis of a split premiership, as the post was reserved for a Sunni Muslim due to the National Pact of 1943, and Omar Karami held this office. The Taif agreement helped to overcome this crisis by preparing the election of a new president.

The agreement also provided for the disarmament of all national and non national militias. Hezbollah was allowed to stay armed in its capacity as a &quot;resistance force&quot; rather than a militia, fighting Israel in the south, a privilege obtained – according to the Swedish academic Magnus Ranstorp – in part by using its leverage as holder of a number of Western hostages. 
Although the Taif Agreement identified the abolition of political sectarianism as a national priority, it provided no timeframe for doing so. The Chamber of Deputies was increased in size to 128 members, shared equally between Christians and Muslims, rather than elected by universal suffrage that would have provided a Muslim majority (excluding the expatriate community, a majority of which is Christian). A cabinet was established similarly divided equally between Christians and Muslims.

According to As&#x27;ad AbuKhalil, the agreement greatly diminished the power of the President to the benefit of the Council of Ministers, although there is ongoing debate about whether this power has shifted to the Council as a whole or the Prime Minister. The president, having had significant executive power prior to the agreement, was reduced to a figurehead with no real and/or considerable power, as in most parliamentary republics. He also noted that the agreement extended the term of the Speaker of the Lebanese Parliament from one year to four years, although the position &quot;remains largely without meaningful authority&quot;.

The agreement was ratified on 5 November 1989. The Parliament met on the same day at the Qoleiat air base in North Lebanon and elected President René Moawad, 409 days after Amine Gemayel vacated this position upon the expiration of his term in 1988. Moawad was unable to occupy the Presidential Palace which was still in use by General Michel Aoun. Moawad was assassinated seventeen days later in a car bombing in Beirut on 22 November 1989 as his motorcade returned from Lebanese Independence Day ceremonies. He was succeeded by Elias Hrawi, who remained in office until 1998.

== Political reform ==

The agreement contained multiple constitutional amendments, which came into force following President Hrawi&#x27;s signature in September 1990. Among the most major changes:

* The ratio of Christians to Muslims in Parliament was reduced from 6:5 to 1:1.
* The term duration of the Speaker of the House was increased from one year to four years. (Article 44 of the constitution)
* Article 17 of the constitution was amended from &quot;the executive power is vested in the President of the Republic, who exercises with the assistance of his ministers&quot; to &quot;the executive power is vested in the Council of Ministers, who exercise it according to the dispositions of this constitution&quot;.
* Presidential prerogatives were somewhat curtailed. Among the powers lost were:
** Require parliamentary consultations before nominating the Prime Minister.
** Cannot dismiss or appoint individual ministers at will (requires approval of the Council).
** Introduce laws in Parliament. Instead, he introduces them to the Cabinet, who then vote to transmit it to Parliament.
** Nominate or dismiss state employees, which became the Council&#x27;s duty. In reality, this had little impact in political life as civil servants were generally nominated by ministers and then voted on in cabinet, before being appointed by the President.
* &quot;The Chamber of Deputies [...] shall take the appropriate measures to bring about the abolition of political confessionalism according to a transitional plan.&quot; (Article 95 of the constitution)

== Disarmament of militias ==

Hrawi’s government set 30 April 1991 as the final date imposing the surrender of all territory, heavy artillery, and disbandment of militias.

=== Jbeil-Keserwan ===

The LF had already agreed to hand over the Keserwan and Jbeil districts in April 1990 to the LAF under General Elie Hayek (Mount Lebanon commander), with the condition that its 10,000 men strong force remain intact.

=== Metn-Baabda ===

In 1989/90 the Metn and Baabda areas, which had been the heartland of the Phalange Party and the LF since the 1950s, experienced unprecedented fighting and shelling following Michel Aoun’s offensives against Samir Geagea’s LF. On 13 October 1990, during the Syrian assault on Baabda Palace, Aoun escaped to the French embassy. The LAF under General Elie Hayek began moving South from Kisrawan and East from Beirut into the Metn and Baabda. Following the battle for the Presidential Palace in which 150 of their soldiers were killed the Syrian army executed up to 80 of the defenders. Atrocities also occurred in the Metn where the SSNP and Hobeika’s LF were at the forefront of the Syrian operations.

=== East/West Beirut ===

Following the end of the Elimination War on 13 October 1990, LAF soldiers began dismantling militia positions on the Green Line. Soon after, barrages and checkpoints blocking access between the cantons were dismantled, allowing traffic to move freely between the East and West for the first time since 1976. In addition, the LAF moved into Martyrs’ Square, which had been the site of some of the most intense fighting in the entire Civil War.
On 3 December 1990 Samir Geagea’s LF officially withdrew from East Beirut with a 2,000 man parade featuring hundreds of vehicles, including tanks and artillery. They also stripped Beirut port of all its equipment including cranes and tugboats.

A few years later, the company Solidere would be mandated by the government to rebuild the completely destroyed downtown.

=== Aley-Chouf ===

The LAF had not been present in the Chouf and most parts of Aley since 1975 when fighting first broke out; in addition, the area was devoid of Christians following an ethnic cleansing committed by Jumblatt’s PLA during the 1983 Mountain War.
On 30 April 1991, the final date of militia disbandment, the Lebanese Army under the command of Hayek entered the Aley and Chouf districts, taking position at former PLA checkpoints and seizing all artillery material. The Chouf Mountains were the last areas of Mount Lebanon that the LAF moved into. Slowly after, Christians began returning to their homeland in these territories, but it was not until the Mountain Reconciliation in 2001 that the mass return of Christians was finalized.

=== North (LF-held) ===

Up until the 30 April 1991, all LF apparatus and positions were integrated into the national army. The army entered the districts of Bcharre (LF/Maronite heartland) to take command of any remaining positions, although there was no animosity or historic entrance as two presidents during the war (Bachir and Amine Gemayel) had been Phalangists, therefore army/LF cooperation had been an everyday affair.

=== North (Syrian-held) ===

Most Syrian troops withdrew from Akkar and Tripoli in the two years following Hrawi&#x27;s signature of the Accord to Tartous governorate in Syria or the Beqaa Valley in Lebanon (as there was no time limit on their presence in the Beqaa).

=== South ===
From 7 February 1991, the Lebanese army began deploying in villages next to the Israeli ‘security zone’. On 15 February Fatah fighters crushed a revolt by a group of their own members who refused to leave their positions in one of the villages. 10 people were killed in the fighting.

On 4 July 1991, following the failure of disarmament negotiations, as required by the Taif agreement, the Lebanese Army attacked Palestinian positions in Southern Lebanon. The offensive, involving 10,000 troops against an estimated 5,000 militia, lasted 3 days and ended with the Army taking all the Palestinian positions around Sidon. In the agreement that followed all heavy weapons were surrendered and infantry weapons only allowed in the two refugee camps, Ain al-Hilweh and Mieh Mieh. 73 people were killed in the fighting, and 200 wounded, mostly Palestinian.

As the South was occupied by Israel and the South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia, the army was not deployed there until the year 2000, when Israel and the SLA retreated South of the Blue Line. As a result of the occupation in 1989, the Taif Agreement enabled &quot;resistance&quot; groups to remain armed in the South until Israeli withdrawal (principally Hezbollah).

The LAF entered the South in 2000 for the first time since 1976 – 34 years after it retreated following the Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon.
Despite the IDF withdrawal in 2000, Hezbollah did not disarm - with approval from President Lahoud and Syria - in violation of the Taif Accord.

=== Beqaa Valley ===

The agreement stipulated the withdrawal of all Syrian troops to the Beqaa valley by 2 years at most, but did not provide a time frame for their full withdrawal of the country. This loophole enabled the Syrian Arab Army to occupy the Beqaa for the next 15 years and dominate political life for the same period, until its complete retreat in March 2005 following the Cedar Revolution and UN Resolution 1559.

<text>Leawarra railway station is a commuter railway station on the Stony Point line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Frankston in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Leawarra station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring one side platform. It opened on 30 November 1959, with the current station provided in 2008. It initially closed on 22 June 1981, then reopened on 27 September 1984.

Initially opened as [[Rail Motor Stopping Place]] No. 16, the station was given its current name of Leawarra in 1962.

The station serves the nearby Peninsula Campus of Monash University.

Langwarrin, a closed station on the Stony Point line, was located between Leawarra and Baxter.

==History==

Leawarra station opened on 30 November 1959 as Rail Motor Stopping Place No. 16. On 24 April 1961, a platform was provided to replace the stopping place. The following year, it was renamed Leawarra.

On 22 June 1981, the passenger service between Frankston and Stony Point was withdrawn and replaced with a bus service. On 16 September 1984, promotional trips for the reopening of the line began and, on 27 September of that year, the passenger service was reinstated.

In 1988, the platform was extended to accommodate a DRC railcar with an MTH carriage. Even then, at , it was the shortest platform in Victoria with a regular rail passenger service. In 1989, boom barriers were provided at the nearby McMahons Road and Hillcrest Road level crossings, located in the up and down directions of the station respectively.

In 2008, when Sprinter trains were introduced on the Stony Point line, the platform was again extended, and is now long.

==Platforms, facilities and services==
Leawarra has one platform, and is located on Bloom Street, which provides access. It has a small passenger shelter, and a myki ticket machine under another shelter. It is served by Stony Point line trains.

<doc id="708974" wikidata="Q702282" url="?curid=708974" title="Rapini">
<text>Rapini (broccoli rabe or raab) () is a green cruciferous vegetable, with the leaves, buds, and stems all being edible; the buds somewhat resemble broccoli. Rapini is known for its bitter taste, and is particularly associated with Mediterranean cuisine. It is a particularly rich dietary source of vitamin K.

== Classification ==
Native to Europe, the plant is a member of the tribe Brassiceae of the Brassicaceae (mustard family). Rapini is classified scientifically as &quot;Brassica rapa&quot; var. &quot;ruvo&quot;, or &quot;Brassica rapa&quot; subsp. &quot;sylvestris&quot; var. &quot;esculenta&quot;. It is also known as broccoletti, broccoli raab, broccoli rabe, spring raab, and ruvo kale. Turnip and bok choy are different varieties (or subspecies) of this species.

== Description ==

Rapini has many spiked leaves that surround clusters of green buds that resemble small heads of broccoli. Small, edible yellow flowers may be blooming among the buds.

== Culinary use ==

The flavor of rapini has been described as nutty, bitter, and pungent, as well as almond-flavored. Rapini needs little more than a trim at the base. The entire stalk is edible when young, but the base becomes more fibrous as the season advances.

Rapini is widely used in the cuisine of Rome as well as Southern Italy, particularly in the regions of Sicily, Calabria, Campania, Apulia, In Italian, rapini is called &quot;cime di rapa&quot; or &quot;broccoletti di rapa&quot;; in Naples, the green is often called &quot;friarielli&quot;. Within Portuguese cuisine, &quot;grelos de nabo&quot; are similar in taste and texture to broccoli rabe. Rapini is also popular in the Galicia region of northwestern Spain; a rapini festival (&quot;Feira do grelo&quot;) is held in the Galician town of As Pontes every February.

Rapini may be sautéed or braised with olive oil and garlic, and sometimes chili pepper and anchovy. It may be used as an ingredient in soup, served with orecchiette, other pasta, or pan-fried sausage. Rapini is sometimes (but not always) blanched before being cooked further.

In the United States, rapini is popular in Italian American kitchens; the D&#x27;Arrigo Brothers popularized the ingredient in the United States and gave it the name &quot;broccoli rabe&quot;. Broccoli rabe is a component of some hoagies and submarine sandwiches; in Philadelphia, a popular sandwich is Italian-style roast pork with locally-made sharp provolone cheese, broccoli rabe, and peppers. Rapini can also be a component of pasta dishes, especially when accompanied by Italian sausage.

==Nutrition==
Raw rapini is 93% water, 3% each of protein and carbohydrates, and contains negligble fat (table). In a reference amount of , raw rapini supplies 22 calories of food energy, and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin K (187% DV), vitamin C (22% DV), and folate (21% DV) (table). Vitamin A, vitamin E, and several B vitamins, along with the dietary minerals, iron and manganese, are in moderate amounts (10-19% DV) (table).

<text>Baxter railway station is a commuter railway station on the Stony Point line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the town and suburb of Baxter, in Victoria, Australia. It opened on 1 October 1888, with the current station provided in 1984. The station was initially closed on 22 June 1981, then was reopened on 27 September 1984.

Initially opened as Mornington Junction, the station was given its current name of Baxter on 6 May 1918.

Langwarrin, a now demolished station on the Stony Point line, was located between Leawarra and Baxter.

==History==

Baxter station opened on 1 October 1888, when the railway line from Frankston was extended. It remained a terminus until 10 September 1889, when the line was extended to Hastings and Mornington. Like the town itself, the station was named after Captain Benjamin Baxter, who was the proprietor of the nearby &quot;Carrup Carrup&quot; pastoral run.

In 1972, flashing light signals were provided at the Baxter-Tooradin Road level crossing, located nearby in the Stony Point (down) direction of the station.

Baxter was formerly the junction for the Mornington line, which was closed to traffic in 1981. The junction, which was relocated in 1962, existed at the down end of the station, though the points were spiked and the line baulked just after the level crossing. In the near future, this junction will be reinstated by the extension of the Mornington Railway, a heritage railway organisation.

On 22 June 1981, the passenger service between Frankston and Stony Point was withdrawn and replaced with a bus service. On 16 September 1984, promotional trips for the reopening of the line began and, on 27 September of that year, the passenger service was reinstated.

By March 1989, the station operated under no-one in charge conditions.

In 2009, boom barriers were provided at the Baxter-Tooradin Road level crossing.

In 2023, the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party stated that the journey to Baxter was &quot;too slow&quot; and urgent upgrades to the line were needed.

Also occurring in that year, the points for the junction were abolished, with the line straight railed.

==Platforms and services==

Baxter has one platform. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Stony Point line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Frankston; all stations services to Stony Point

==Transport links==

Ventura Bus Lines operates one bus route via Baxter station, under contract to Public Transport Victoria:
* : Frankston station – Pearcedale

<doc id="708978" wikidata="Q7559990" url="?curid=708978" title="Somerville railway station">
<text>Somerville railway station is a commuter railway station on the Stony Point line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the town of the same name in Victoria, Australia. Somerville is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring one side platform. It opened on 10 September 1889.

==History==

Somerville station opened when the railway line from Baxter was extended to Hastings. Like the town itself, the station was named after Sir William Meredyth Somerville, an Anglo-Irish Member of the British Parliament, for Drogheda between 1837 and 1852, and Canterbury, between 1854 and 1865.

The station opened due to rapid growth in the fruit (apples and pears) and dairy industries. The dairy industry needed a quick way of sending milk and cream to butter factories.

When the railway line reached Somerville, the station was some distance from the local school and hall which, at the time, were located on Lower Somerville Road. The town centre moved from there to its current site, adjacent to the station.

In the early years, Somerville station also operated as a post and telegraph office, and was a centre where people met as they collected their mail. The provision of special railway sidings serving new packing sheds and cool stores, over a period of six years from 1914 to 1920, supported the expansion in the apple and pear growing industry. The advent of iced T-vans made it possible to quickly transport fruit to Melbourne docks, to be loaded directly into refrigerated ships for overseas destinations.

Up until the end of World War II, a special train ran to the horticultural show at Somerville, which was reputed to be one of the biggest of its kind in Australia. The railway line also helped the fruit tree nurseries, and family-operated companies, such as Brunnings, Shepherds, Unthanks, Coles and Grants. They sent hundreds of thousands of bare-rooted trees to places such as the Goulburn Valley, the Murray Valley, and Sunraysia areas in Victoria, the Riverina districts of New South Wales, and to the Granite Belt area, centred on Stanthorpe in Queensland. The traffic was seasonal, and occurred from May to September.

The station building on the platform at Somerville was portable, meaning that it was delivered in sections and bolted together. It contained an office and a safeworking area, from which the staff and ticket system was operated. There was a van shed for small goods and parcels, two waiting rooms, one exclusively for the ladies and a general waiting room, and toilets. The building existed until February 1986, when it was replaced with an aluminium building. In the station yard, there was a general goods shed, a loading ramp, a crane, and a livestock loading facility. Later, two sidings were built for the Somerville Co-operative Cool Stores. By 2008, the up end connection to the yard was removed.

The station master&#x27;s house was at the Frankston-Flinders Road entrance to the station. Two Somerville youths set fire to the house during August 2009 and it was completely destroyed. The offenders were apprehended.

The station was usually staffed by a station master but, on occasions over the years, he was assisted by a lad porter or assistant station master from Baxter. Somerville was the banking station for all stations to Stony Point, and supplied some of them with stores and stationery. Safeworking was originally by the staff and ticket system, but that was varied from time to time, until the opening of the Long Island sidings, when the electric staff system was introduced.

In 1961, flashing light signals were installed at the Eramosa Road level crossing, located nearby in the up direction from the station.

On 22 June 1981, the passenger service between Frankston and Stony Point was withdrawn and replaced with a bus service. On 16 September 1984, promotional trips for the reopening of the line began and, on 27 September of that year, the passenger service was reinstated.

In 1991, boom barriers were provided at the Eramosa Road level crossing.

<text>Tyabb railway station is a commuter railway station on the Stony Point line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the town of Tyabb in Victoria, Australia. Tyabb is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring one side platform. It opened on 10 September 1889, with the current station provided in 1986. It initially closed on 22 June 1981, then reopened on 27 September 1984.

==History==

Tyabb station opened on 10 September 1889, when the railway line from Baxter was extended to Hastings. Like the town itself, the station has an Aboriginal name meaning &#x27;waterholes&#x27; or &#x27;mudhole&#x27;.

Signals were once provided at the station, however they were abolished in 1947.

In 1966, flashing light signals were provided at the Mornington–Tyabb Road level crossing, located nearby in the down direction of the station.

On 22 June 1981, the passenger service between Frankston and Stony Point was withdrawn and replaced with a bus service. On 16 September 1984, promotional trips for the reopening of the line began and, on 27 September of that year, the passenger service was reinstated.

Until February 1986, the station consisted of a waiting room, basic toilets and a ticket office. As part of a government rationalisation of public transport, these facilities were no longer deemed necessary, and the buildings were demolished and replaced with the current shelters.

In 2008, boom barriers were provided at the Mornington–Tyabb Road level crossing.

==Platforms and services==

Tyabb has one platform. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Stony Point line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Frankston; all stations services to Stony Point

==Transport links==

Ventura Bus Lines operates two routes via Tyabb station, under contract to Public Transport Victoria:

<text>Hastings railway station is a commuter railway station on the Stony Point line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It opened on 10 September 1889 and serves the town of the same name in Victoria, Australia. 

The station, along with the line, was closed on 22 June 1981, but both were reopened on 27 September 1984. Hastings station once had a goods yard opposite the platform, which has been closed and the tracks removed. A disused crane remains on site. The station building dating from 1986 was burned down on 21 December 2024.

==History==
Hastings station opened when the railway line was extended to there from Baxter. It remained a terminus until 17 December of that year, when the line was further extended to Stony Point. Like the town itself, the station was named after Hastings in Sussex, England.

In 1962, flashing light warning signals were provided at the High Street level crossing, located nearby in the down direction from the station. In 1973, a number of roads in the former goods yard were extended.

On 22 June 1981, the rail passenger service between Frankston and Stony Point was withdrawn and replaced with a bus service, with the line between Long Island Junction and Stony Point also closing on the same day. On 16 September 1984, promotional trips for the reopening of the line to Stony Point began and, on 27 September of that year, the rail passenger service was reinstated.

In February 1986, the current station building was provided, replacing the original timber building.

In 1998, boom barriers were provided at the High Street level crossing.

In 2004, points at the up and down ends of the station were removed, and the track was straight railed.

In the early hours of 21 December 2024, the station building was destroyed by fire, which led to temporary closure of the station and the suspension of services on the Stony Point line for a day.

==Platforms and services==
Hastings has one platform and is served by Stony Point line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Frankston; all stations services to Stony Point

<text>Sammy Fain (born Samuel E. Feinberg; June 17, 1902 – December 6, 1989) was an American composer of popular music. In the 1920s and early 1930s, he contributed numerous songs that form part of The Great American Songbook, and to Broadway theatre. Fain was also a popular musician and vocalist.

==Biography==
Sammy Fain was born in New York City, the son of a cantor. In 1923, Fain appeared in the short sound film, &quot;Sammy Fain and Artie Dunn&quot; directed by Lee De Forest filmed in DeForest&#x27;s Phonofilm sound-on-film process. In 1925, Fain left the Fain-Dunn act to devote himself to music. Fain was a self-taught pianist who played by ear. He began working as a staff pianist and composer for music publisher Jack Mills. In 1932, he appeared in the short film &quot;The Crooning Composer&quot;.

Later, Fain worked extensively in collaboration with Irving Kahal. Together they wrote classics such as &quot;Let a Smile Be Your Umbrella&quot; and &quot;You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me,&quot; (co-written with Pierre Norman) and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Seeing You.&quot; Another lyricist who collaborated with Fain was Lew Brown, with whom he wrote &quot;That Old Feeling&quot;. His Broadway credits also include &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Welcome&quot;, &quot;Right This Way&quot;, &quot;Hellzapoppin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Flahooley&quot;, &quot;Ankles Aweigh&quot;, &quot;Christine&quot; and &quot;Something More&quot;.

==Film works==
Fain also composed music for more than 30 films in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song ten times, winning twice, with &quot;Secret Love&quot; from &quot;Calamity Jane&quot; in 1954 and with &quot;Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing&quot; from the movie of the same title in 1956. He co-wrote both songs with Paul Francis Webster, another long-time collaborator. Fain wrote the second theme to the TV series &quot;Wagon Train&quot; in 1958, which was called &quot;(Roll Along) Wagon Train&quot;. He also contributed to the song scores for the Walt Disney animated films &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, and &quot;The Rescuers&quot; (the latter, soon to be his last effort, also earned him another Oscar nomination).

In 1963, he collaborated with Harold Adamson, in writing songs for the film &quot;The Incredible Mr. Limpet&quot;, which came out in 1964, and such songs as &quot;I Wish I Were a Fish&quot;, &quot;Be Careful How You Wish&quot; and &quot;Deep Rapture&quot; enhanced his fame.

==Recognition==
In 1972, he was inducted into The Songwriters Hall of Fame.

==Death==
Fain died from a heart attack in Los Angeles, California, and is interred at Cedar Park Cemetery, in Emerson, New Jersey.

<text>Hugo Makibi Enomiya-Lassalle (11 November 1898 in Gut Externbrock near Nieheim, Westphalia – 7 July 1990 in Münster, Westphalia) was a German Jesuit priest and one of the foremost teachers to embrace both Roman Catholic Christianity and Zen Buddhism.

== Biography ==
Hugo Lassalle passed his school days from 1911 to 1916 at the Gymnasium Petrinum in Brilon in 1917. Because of an injury in the First World War, Hugo Lassalle was admitted to the military hospital of Brilon in 1917. Enomiya-Lassalle joined the Society of Jesus on 25 April 1919. At the end of the usual Jesuit spiritual and academic training he was ordained priest on 28 August 1927.

He travelled to Japan as a missionary in 1929 and became interested in that country&#x27;s Buddhist practices. In 1940, he became the vicar of Hiroshima, and on 6 August 1945 he was critically wounded by the nuclear blast in that city, which is depicted in John Hersey&#x27;s book &quot;Hiroshima&quot;. Shortly thereafter, he returned to Germany.

In September 1946, he had an audience with Pope Pius XII, in which he revealed his plan to build in Hiroshima a cathedral dedicated to the idea of world peace. Designed by Japanese architect Togo Murano, construction on the cathedral began in 1950 and on 6 August 1954, the Memorial Cathedral for World Peace (ja) was dedicated.

In 1956, Enomiya-Lassalle began studying Zen with Harada Daiun Sogaku. In 1958, he published &quot;Zen: A Way to Enlightenment&quot;.

Following Harada&#x27;s death in 1961, Enomiya-Lassalle became an apprentice of one of Harada&#x27;s students, Yamada Kōun. Yamada was enthusiastic about the possibilities of Zen as a Christian practice, believing that &quot;Zen would become an important stream in the Catholic Church one day&quot;. With Enomiya-Lassalle&#x27;s active assistance, he attracted a number of Catholic priests and nuns as students. In the late 1960s, Enomiya-Lasalle was certified as a teacher in Yamada&#x27;s Sanbo Kyodan sect and given the title &quot;roshi&quot; (Zen master), while professing his continued belief in Christianity. After 1968, Enomiya-Lassalle spent much of his time in Europe leading Zen retreats and encouraging Zen practice among Christians. His books influenced symphony conductor Herbert von Karajan to study Zen and incorporate a Zen mindset into his conducting.

<doc id="708989" wikidata="Q1558889" url="?curid=708989" title="Drums in communication">
<text>Developed and used by cultures living in forested areas, drums served as an early form of long-distance communication, and were used during ceremonial and religious functions.

== Types ==
=== Talking drum ===
One is the Talking drum. While the tone and articulation of this type of hourglass-shaped instrument can be finely controlled, it cannot be heard at distances beyond a gathering or market-place, and it is primarily used in ceremonial settings. Ceremonial functions could include dance, rituals, story-telling and communication of points of order.

Some of the groups of variations of the talking drum among West African ethnic groups:

*Tama (Wolof of Senegal)
*Gan gan, Dun Dun (Yoruba of Nigeria and eastern Benin)
*Dondo (Akan of central Ghana and Côte d&#x27;Ivoire)
*Lunna (Dagomba of northern Ghana; Mossi of Burkina Faso)
*Kalangu (Hausa of northern Nigeria, Niger, northern Ghana, Benin and Cameroon)
*Doodo (Songhai and Zarma of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger)

In the 20th century the talking drums have become a part of popular music in West Africa, especially in the music genres of Jùjú (Nigeria) and Mbalax (Senegal).

=== Slit gongs ===
Message drums, or more properly slit gongs, with hollow chambers and long, narrow openings that resonate when struck, are larger all-wood instruments hollowed out from a single log. Slit-log drums are common in the drum communication systems of Papua New Guinea, where they are known in Tok Pisin as &quot;garamut&quot;. Variations in the thickness of the walls give varying tones when struck by the heavy wooden drum sticks. While some are simple and utilitarian, they can also be highly elaborate works of sculpture while still retaining their function.

A long slit is cut in one side of a log, then it is hollowed out through the slit, leaving lips (wooden ledges) on each side of the opening. Using a larger log enables a louder sound that can be heard over longer distances. By hollowing more under one lip and less under the other, the drum can be tuned to produce two different notes, a lower and a higher one. The drum&#x27;s lips are hit with sticks, beating out rhythms of high and low notes. Small stands are often placed under each end of the drum to keep it off the ground and let it vibrate more freely.

Under ideal conditions, the sound can be understood at , but interesting messages usually get relayed on by the next village. Drums used by the Bulu people of Cameroon might be heard as far away as 10 to 15 miles at night, compared to three to four during daytime. 

=== Cambarysu ===
The Catuquinaru tribe of Brazil reportedly used a drum called the cambarysu to send vibrations through the ground to other cambarysus up to 1.5 km away. Some scholars expressed skepticism about the claim that it sent vibrations through the ground (rather than the air), and about the claim that it existed.

In Africa, New Guinea and tropical areas of America, people have used drum telegraphy for centuries to communicate over long distances. When European expeditions came into the jungles to explore, they were surprised to find that people already knew they were coming and what their intentions were. By repeating a message in turn from one nearby location to another, African drummers can transmit that message a total distance of 100 miles in about an hour.

Among the famous communication drums are the drums of West Africa (see talking drum). From regions known today as Nigeria and Ghana they spread across West Africa, and to the America and the Caribbean during the slave trade. There they were banned because they were being used by the slaves to communicate over long distances in a code unknown to their enslavers.

Talking drums were also used in East Africa and are described by Andreus Bauer in the &#x27;Street of Caravans&#x27;, about his time as a security guard in the Wissmann Truppe for the caravan of Charles Stokes.

==What is transmitted==

Drum communication methods are not languages in their own right, though they can be based on spoken languages. In such cases, the sounds produced are conventionalized or idiomatic signals based on speech patterns. The drummed messages are normally very stereotyped and context-dependent; speakers of true languages have the ability to form new combinations and expressions that will immediately be understood by the listener, but that is not the case in drum communication.

In Central and East Africa, drum patterns represent the stresses, syllable lengths and tone of the particular language. In tone languages, where syllables are associated with a certain tone, some words are distinguished only by their suprasegmental profile. Therefore, syllable drum languages can often transfer a message using the tonal phonemes alone.

In certain languages, the pitch of each syllable is uniquely determined in relation to adjacent syllables. In these cases, messages can be transmitted as rapid beats at the same speed as speech, as the rhythm and melody both match the equivalent spoken utterance.

Misinterpretations can occur due to the highly ambiguous nature of the communication. The ambiguity is reduced by context effects and the use of stock phrases. For example, in Jabo, most stems are monosyllabic. By using a proverb or honorary title to create an expanded version of the name of a person, animal, or object, the indistinguishable single beat of an ordinary name can be replaced with a particular rhythmic and melodic motif for each subject. In practice not all listeners understand all of the stock phrases; the drum language is understood only to the level of each person&#x27;s immediate concern.

<text>Bittern railway station is a commuter railway station on the Stony Point line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the town of Bittern in Victoria, Australia. Bittern is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring one side platform. It opened on 17 December 1889, with the current station provided in 1986. It initially closed on 22 June 1981, then reopened on 27 September 1984.

==History==

Bittern station opened on 17 December 1889, when the railway line from Hastings was extended to Stony Point. Like the town itself, the station was named after the bird family of the same name.

Between 1921 and 1953, Bittern was the junction for a branch line to Red Hill.

On 22 June 1981, the passenger service between Frankston and Stony Point was withdrawn and replaced with a bus service, with the line between Long Island Junction and Stony Point also closing on the same day. On 16 September 1984, promotional trips for the reopening of the line began and, on 27 September of that year, the passenger service was reinstated. Also occurring in that year, flashing light signals were provided at the nearby Woolleys Road level crossing, located in the down direction of the station. In February 1986, the current passenger shelters were provided, replacing the original timber station building.

In 1991, a siding at the station was abolished.

In 2010, boom barriers were provided at the Woolleys Road level crossing.

==Platforms and services==

Bittern has one platform. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Stony Point line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Frankston; all stations services to Stony Point

==Transport links==

Ventura Bus Lines operates one bus route via Bittern station, under contract to Public Transport Victoria:
* : Frankston station – Flinders

<text>James Williams (August 4, 1825 – April 12, 1899) was an American farmer and politician from Smyrna, in Kent County, Delaware. He was a member of the Democratic Party, who served in the Delaware General Assembly and as U. S. Representative from Delaware.

==Early life and family==
Williams was the son of John (1775–1849) and Esther Williams in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His father was a lumber merchant, and his early education was by private tutoring. He first became an apprentice carpenter, intending to become an architect. In 1848 his father bought a large estate in Kent County, Delaware and young Williams moved to Kenton to take up farming and manage the property.

==Professional and political career==
Williams became politically active in the Democratic Party, and was elected to the Delaware House of Representatives, serving in 1857/1858, 1863/1864 and 1883/84. He next served in the State Senate from 1891/92, and was the Speaker of the Senate for 1869/70. In 1872 he was a delegate to the party&#x27;s national convention which nominated Horace Greeley for U.S. president. Williams was twice elected as Delaware&#x27;s only member in the United States House of Representatives, serving in two terms from 1875 until 1879, in the 44th and 45th Congress under U.S. Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes.

He remained a farmer throughout his public service. After returning to private life he expanded into fertilizer manufacturing, and increased his farm holdings in Delaware and Maryland. In 1891 he moved to Smyrna, Delaware, but continued farming for the rest of his life.

==Death and legacy==
Williams lived quietly, died at Smyrna, and is buried there at the St. Peter&#x27;s Episcopal Church Cemetery.

==Almanac==
Elections are held the first Tuesday after November 1. Members of the General Assembly take office the second Tuesday of January. State Senators have a four-year term and State Representatives have a two-year term. Williams completed part of an existing State Senate term. U.S. Representatives took office March 4 and have a two-year term.

<text>Cosmo&#x27;s Factory is the fifth studio album by the American rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival, released by Fantasy Records on July 16, 1970. Six of the album&#x27;s eleven tracks were released as singles in 1970, and all of them charted in the top 5 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album spent nine consecutive weeks in the number one position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and was certified 4x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1990. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 413 on its 2020 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Background==
With the release of &quot;Cosmo&#x27;s Factory&quot; in July 1970, Creedence Clearwater Revival hit their commercial zenith. It was their fifth album in two years and became an international success, topping the album charts in six countries. The band also toured Europe in 1970, playing London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall among other venues, and had emerged as the most popular band in America by largely ignoring the trippy acid rock that was typical of the era. However, despite the band&#x27;s blend of rockabilly, folk, and R&amp;B, some peers and rock critics dismissed them as a singles band with no substance. In a 2012 cover story, &quot;Uncut&quot; observed: &quot;While San Francisco longhairs across the bridge scoffed at their commercialism, Creedence henceforth made a point of releasing double A-sides. And invariably both songs would have an uncanny knack of cutting through to all sections of the population.&quot; Singer and lead guitarist John Fogerty, who had seemingly arrived out of nowhere, but had actually struggled with his bandmates throughout most of the 1960s as the Blue Velvets and the Golliwogs, composed the group&#x27;s songs and generally steered the band artistically, although his grip on the band – including his dubious role as manager – irritated the others, especially his older brother Tom Fogerty, who left the band by the end of 1970.

==Songs==
Perhaps more than any other Creedence album, &quot;Cosmo&#x27;s Factory&quot; displays the wide range of musical ingredients that provided the foundation for their &quot;swamp rock&quot; sound: R&amp;B (&quot;Before You Accuse Me&quot;, &quot;My Baby Left Me&quot;), soul (&quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot;, &quot;Long As I Can See the Light&quot;), country (&quot;Lookin&#x27; Out My Back Door&quot;), rockabilly and classic rock and roll (&quot;Ooby Dooby&quot;, &quot;Travelin&#x27; Band&quot;), and psychedelia (&quot;Ramble Tamble&quot;).

&quot;Travelin&#x27; Band&quot; was inspired by 1950s rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll songs, particularly those by Little Richard. In October 1972, the company that held the publishing rights to Richard&#x27;s &quot;Good Golly, Miss Molly&quot; felt &quot;Travelin&#x27; Band&quot; bore enough similarities to warrant a plagiarism lawsuit that was later settled out of court. The song&#x27;s flip side, &quot;Who&#x27;ll Stop the Rain&quot;, could not have been more different, with Fogerty telling &quot;Uncut&quot; in 2012: &quot;&#x27;Travelin&#x27; Band&#x27; was my salute to Little Richard, but &#x27;Who&#x27;ll Stop The Rain?&#x27; was part of the fabric of the times. From &#x27;68 to &#x27;74, Vietnam was probably the most important thing on the minds of young people.&quot; &quot;Run Through the Jungle&quot; mined similar territory, with many listeners believing the lyrics to be about the war. According to the band&#x27;s bassist Stu Cook, the song&#x27;s opening and closing both feature jungle sound effects created by &quot;lots of backwards recorded guitar and piano.&quot; The song was rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty&#x27;s favorite CCR song: &quot;My all-time favorite Creedence tune was &#x27;Run Through the Jungle&#x27;. It&#x27;s like a little movie in itself with all the sound effects. It never changes key, but it holds your interest the whole time. It&#x27;s like a musician&#x27;s dream. It never changes key, yet you get the illusion it does.&quot;

&quot;Lookin&#x27; Out My Back Door&quot; was a direct tribute to the Bakersfield Sound, a style of music that influenced John Fogerty and the Creedence sound – Buck Owens, one of the architects of the Bakersfield Sound, is even mentioned in the lyrics. The song is known for its upbeat tempo, its down-home feel, and a change in key and tempo towards the end. The lyrics, filled with colorful, dream-like imagery, led some to believe the song was about drugs (according to the drug theory, the &quot;flying spoon&quot; in the song was a cocaine spoon, and the crazy animal images were an acid trip). Fogerty, however, has repeatedly stated in interviews that the song was actually written for his son Josh, who was three years old at the time, and said the reference to a parade passing by was inspired by the Dr. Seuss book &quot;And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street&quot;.

Although CCR was well-known for its concise, tightly arranged songs, &quot;Cosmo&#x27;s Factory&quot; features two longer cuts: the seven-minute opener, &quot;Ramble Tamble&quot;, and an 11-minute cover of Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot;. The band had dabbled with psychedelia on their debut single, &quot;Susie Q&quot;, but &quot;Ramble Tamble&quot; is more ambitious, beginning with a rockabilly part before transitioning into a psychedelic wall of sound that lasts nearly four minutes and then transitioning back into the original rockabilly section near the end. The song has been singled out for critical praise, with music journalist Steven Hyden calling it &quot;the most rockin&#x27; song of all time&quot;. As Cook explained to Bill Kopp of musoscribe.com: &quot;Each album had a longish track on it, but they were never jams, per se...&#x27;Heard It Through the Grapevine&#x27; had a little jammy character to it, but they were all pretty structured. There was no space to noodle. Live, there was a little bit of noodling, but in the studio we always tried to nail the arrangement.&quot;

Several songs on the album pay tribute to the band&#x27;s blues and rock and roll roots, including Big Arthur Crudup&#x27;s &quot;My Baby Left Me&quot; (a notable cover of which had previously been recorded by Elvis Presley), Bo Diddley&#x27;s &quot;Before You Accuse Me&quot;, and the rockabilly classic &quot;Ooby Dooby&quot;.

==Album title and artwork==
The name of the album comes from the warehouse in Berkeley where the band rehearsed early in their career, which was dubbed &quot;The Factory&quot; by drummer Doug &quot;Cosmo&quot; Clifford, because bandleader John Fogerty made them practice there almost every day. In 2013, Clifford recalled to &quot;Goldmine&quot; that &quot;John knew the press would be all over us for the album, so he said that he would name the album after me and that I would have to deal with it. He wanted the pressure off of him. It was our biggest album ever and I tell people that they named it after me, so it had to be a hit [laughter]. That&#x27;s a joke!&quot;

The cover photo was taken by Bob Fogerty, brother of John and Tom. As David Cavanagh of &quot;Uncut&quot; wrote in 2012: &quot;The album&#x27;s front cover showed the four of them caught by a camera in an off-duty moment, a proudly uncool quartet who looked more like lumberjacks than rock stars.&quot; The handwritten sign affixed to the support post at the left of the photo that reads &quot;3RD GENERATION&quot; is an ironic reference to something rock music critic Ralph Gleason wrote in the liner notes of the band&#x27;s debut album: &quot;Creedence Clearwater Revival is an excellent example of the Third Generation of San Francisco bands&quot;.
==Critical reception==

In its original review, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; opined: &quot;It should be obvious by now that Creedence Clearwater Revival is one great rock and roll band. &quot;Cosmo&#x27;s Factory&quot;, the group&#x27;s fifth album, is another good reason why.&quot;

AllMusic states: &quot;On &#x27;Long as I Can See the Light&#x27;, the record&#x27;s final song, he again finds solace in home, anchored by a soulful, laid-back groove. It hits a comforting, elegiac note, the perfect way to draw &quot;Cosmo&#x27;s Factory&quot; – an album made during stress and chaos, filled with raging rockers, covers, and intense jams – to a close.&quot; An editorial review from Amazon.com calls the album &quot;the peak of a prolific streak.&quot;

===Accolades===
In 2014, &quot;Cosmo&#x27;s Factory&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.
In 2003, the album was ranked number 265 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time; it was re-ranked number 413 on the revised 2020 list.

==Commercial performance==
In January 1970, the double A-sided &quot;Travelin&#x27; Band&quot;/&quot;Who&#x27;ll Stop the Rain&quot; single peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. In April, the band released the double A-sided &quot;Up Around the Bend&quot;/&quot;Run Through the Jungle&quot; single, which reached number four on the Hot 100, and started their first tour of Europe. &quot;Cosmo&#x27;s Factory&quot; was released in July 1970, as was the band&#x27;s ninth single, &quot;Lookin&#x27; Out My Back Door&quot;/&quot;Long as I Can See the Light&quot;, which reached number two on the Hot 100.

The album was certified gold (500,000 units sold) by the Recording Industry Association of America on December 16, 1970. Almost 20 years later, on December 13, 1990, it received a certification of four times platinum, indicating sales of over four million copies.

<text>Morradoo railway station is a commuter railway station on the Stony Point line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the town of Crib Point in Victoria, Australia. Morradoo is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring one side platform. It opened on 7 November 1960, with the current station provided in 1996.

Initially opened as [[Rail Motor Stopping Place]] No. 15, the station was given its current name of Morradoo in 1996.
== History ==
By November 1963, an platform was provided at the stopping place. In December 1973, flashing light signals were provided at the Disney Road level crossing, located at the up end of the station.

On 22 June 1981, the passenger service between Frankston and Stony Point was withdrawn and replaced with a bus service, with the line between Long Island Junction and Stony Point also closing on the same day. On 16 September 1984, promotional trips for the reopening of the line began and, on 27 September of that year, the rail passenger service was reinstated.

In 1996, the platform was extended to 52 metres in length, and a new passenger shelter was erected. That made the platform the second-shortest with a regular service in Victoria (the shortest being at Leawarra, also on the same line). In that same year, the station was renamed as the result of a local competition, with the winning entry being Morradoo, suggested by Bree Saunders of Crib Point Primary School. Morradoo comes from an Indigenous word meaning &quot;powder and shot&quot;, and was the original name for Crib Point.

In 2011, boom barriers were provided at the Disney Road level crossing.
