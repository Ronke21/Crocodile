<text>Óscar Humberto Mejía Víctores (December 9, 1930 – February 1, 2016) was a Guatemalan military officer and politician who served as the Head of Government from August 1983 to January 1986. A member of the military, he was head of state during the apex of repression and death squad activity in the Central American nation. When he was minister of defense, he rallied a coup against President Ríos Montt, which he justified by declaring that religious fanatics were abusing the government. He allowed for a return to democracy, with elections for a constituent assembly being held in 1984, followed by general elections in 1985.

==Mejía Víctores regime==

===Return to democratic appearances===
Ríos Montt was deposed on 8 August 1983 by his own Minister of Defense, General Mejía Víctores. Mejía Víctores became then &quot;de facto&quot; president and justified the coup by saying that &quot;religious fanatics&quot; were abusing their positions in the government and also because of &quot;official corruption.&quot; Ríos Montt remained in politics, founding the Guatemalan Republican Front party in 1989. Elected to Congress he was elected President of Congress in 1995 and 2000. Due to international pressure, as well as pressure from other Latin American nations, General Mejía Víctores allowed a gradual return to democracy in Guatemala. On 1 July 1984, an election was held for representatives to a Constituent Assembly to draft a democratic constitution. On 30 May 1985, the Constituent Assembly finished drafting a new constitution, which took effect immediately. General elections were scheduled, and civilian candidate Vinicio Cerezo was elected president. Revival of democratic government did not end the &quot;disappearances&quot; and death squad killings, as extrajudicial state violence had become an integral part of the political culture.

===Continuing terror===
By the time Mejía Víctores assumed power, the counterinsurgency under Lucas García and Ríos Montt had largely succeeded in its objective of detaching the insurgency from its civilian support base. Additionally, Guatemalan military intelligence (G-2) had succeeded in infiltrating most of the political institutions. It eradicated opponents in the government through terror and selective assassinations. The counterinsurgency program had militarized Guatemalan society, creating a fearful atmosphere of terror that suppressed most public agitation and insurgency. The military had consolidated its power in virtually all sectors of society.

In 1983, indigenous activist Rigoberta Menchú published a memoir of her life during that period, &quot;I, Rigoberta Menchú, An Indian Woman in Guatemala&quot;, which gained worldwide attention. She is the daughter of one of the peasant leaders who died in the Spanish Embassy massacre on 31 January 1980. She was later awarded the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize—in the year of the Fifth Centennial celebration of America Discovery—for her work favoring broader social justice. Her memoir drew international attention to Guatemala and the nature of its institutional terrorism.

After the August 1983 coup, both the U.S. intelligence community and human rights observers noted that while cases of human rights abuses in rural Guatemala were on the decline, death squad activity in the city was on the rise. Additionally, as the levels of wholesale extrajudicial killings and massacres decreased, the rates of abduction and forced disappearance increased. The situation in Guatemala City soon resembled the situation under Lucas García. In Mejía Víctores&#x27;s first full month in power, the number of documented monthly kidnappings jumped from 12 in August to 56 in September. The victims included several U.S. Agency for International Development employees, officials from moderate and leftist political parties, and Catholic priests. In a report to the United Nations, Guatemala&#x27;s Human Rights Commission reported 713 extrajudicial killings and 506 disappearances of Guatemalans in the period from January to September 1984. A secret United States Department of Defense report from March 1986 noted that from 8 August 1983 to 31 December 1985, there were a total of 2,883 recorded kidnappings (3.29 daily), and kidnappings averaged a total of 137 a month through 1984 (a total of approximately 1,644 cases). The report linked these violations to a systematic program of abduction and killing by the security forces under Mejía Víctores, noting, &quot;while criminal activity accounts for a small percentage of the cases, and from time to time individuals ‘disappear’ to go elsewhere, the security forces and paramilitary groups are responsible for most kidnappings. Insurgent groups do not now normally use kidnapping as a political tactic.&quot;

Under Lucas García, part of the modus operandi of government repression during the Mejía government involved interrogating victims at military bases, police stations, or government safe houses. Information about alleged connections with insurgents was &quot;extracted through torture.&quot; The security forces used the information to make joint military/police raids on suspected guerrilla safe-houses throughout Guatemala City. In the process, the government secretly captured hundreds of individuals who were never seen again or whose bodies were later found showing signs of torture and mutilation. Such activities were often carried out by specialized units of the National Police. Between 1984 and 1986, the secret police (G-2) maintained an operations center for the counterinsurgency programs in southwest Guatemala at the southern airbase at Retalhuleu. There, the G-2 operated a clandestine interrogation center for suspected insurgents and collaborators. Captured suspects were reportedly detained in water-filled pits along the perimeter of the base, which was covered with cages. To avoid drowning, prisoners were forced to hold onto the cages over the pits. The bodies of prisoners tortured to death and live prisoners marked for disappearance were thrown out of IAI-201 Aravas by the Guatemalan Air Force over the Pacific Ocean (&quot;death flights&quot;).

Along with former Presidents José Efraín Ríos Montt and Fernando Romeo Lucas García, President Mejía was charged with murder, kidnapping and genocide in a Spanish court.

<text>Germain Henri Hess (; 7 August 1802 – ) was a Swiss-Russian chemist and doctor who formulated Hess&#x27; law, an early principle of thermochemistry.

==Early life and education==
Hess was born on 7 August 1802 in Geneva, France (Switzerland after 1815). His father was an artist and in 1805 moved the family to the Russian Empire to work as a tutor to a rich family. His mother was a tutor as well and Hess learned German and French at home. In 1817, his family moved to Dorpat, Russian Empire (now Tartu, Estonia), where he went to a private school for two years, and then to Dorpat Gymnasium, which he finished in 1822. In autumn of the same year Hess studied medicine at the University of Dorpat. During that time, the chemistry department was responsible for the Chemistry courses of the Medicine and Pharmacy departments and Professor Gottfried W. Osann was giving the lectures in German (an obvious advance for Hess). Under Osann&#x27;s supervision, Hess made chemical analyses, but also had an interest in the lectures of Professor of Physics Georges-Frédéric Parrot and Professor of Mineralogy Moritz von Engelhardt. Hess graduated with honors from Dorpat University receiving a doctor of medicine degree with his dissertation entitled &quot;Something about Curative Waters, Especially Those in Russia&quot;. He qualified as a physician in 1825. By application of Professors Osann and Engelhardt, Hess was sent to Sweden, to visit Swedish chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius. After this meeting Hess turned once and for all to chemistry. On his return to Russia, Hess joined an expedition to study the geology of the Urals before he was appointed a medical doctor at Irkutsk. According to the regulations of that time, new doctors had to practice at a Russian frontier town after having graduated. Hess went to Irkutsk in August 1826.

==Contributions to chemistry==
In 1830, Hess took up chemistry full-time, researching and teaching, and later became an adjunct professor of Chemistry at the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. His most famous paper, outlining his law on thermochemistry, was published there in 1840. His principle, a progenitor for the first law of thermodynamics, came to be called Hess&#x27; law. It states that in a series of chemical reactions, the total energy gained or lost depends only on the initial and final states, regardless of the number or path of the steps. This is also known as the law of constant heat summation.

Like most of his colleagues, Hess was primarily an experimental chemist interested in the discovery and analysis of new substances. However, he also developed a strong interest for theoretical investigations. In particular, he wondered how chemical affinity relates to heat in chemical reactions. His experiments on various hydrates of sulfuric acid showed that the heat released when they formed was always the same, whether the reactions proceeded directly or through intermediates (1840). Hess thus formulated a special case of the conservation of energy two years before Julius Robert von Mayer stated a more general principle, in 1842. Hess was fully aware of the importance of his own contribution.

In 1842, Hess proposed the law of thermoneutrality, which states that no heat is evolved in the exchange reactions of neutral salts in aqueous solution. A full explanation would only be given 45 years later, in terms of electrolytic dissociation, by the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius.

After these two major discoveries, Hess was influential in the development of chemistry in Russia. His book &quot;Osnovania Chistoy Khimii&quot; (&quot;Fundamentals of Pure Chemistry&quot;) went through seven editions and remained the standard Russian textbook for undergraduate chemistry until 1861. Hess was active as a teacher and mentor of young scientists, until his poor health forced him to retire, in 1848.

==Later research and final days==
Hess&#x27; investigation of minerals included the analysis of silver telluride (Ag2Te), which was named hessite in his honour. He also discovered that the oxidation of sugars yielded saccharic acid.

Hess died prematurely in 1850, at the age of 48, in St. Petersburg. He was buried at Smolenskoe Lutheran cemetery.

<doc id="721235" wikidata="Q4780426" url="?curid=721235" title="Apologeticus">
<text>Apologeticus ( or &quot;Apologeticus&quot;) is a text attributed to Tertullian according to Christian tradition, consisting of apologetic and polemic. In this work Tertullian defends Christianity, demanding legal toleration and that Christians be treated like all other sects of the Roman Empire. It is in this treatise that one finds the sentence &quot;Plures efficimur, quotiens metimur a vobis: semen est sanguis Christianorum,&quot; which has been liberally and apocryphally translated as &quot;the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church&quot; (&quot;Apologeticus&quot;, L.13). Alexander Souter translated this phrase as &quot;We spring up in greater numbers the more we are mown down by you: the blood of the Christians is the seed of a new life,&quot; but even this takes liberties with the original text. &quot;We multiply when you reap us. The blood of Christians is seed,&quot; is perhaps a more faithful, if less poetic, rendering. 

There is a similarity of content, if not of purpose, between this work and Tertullian&#x27;s &quot;Ad nationes&quot;—published earlier in the same year—and it has been claimed that the latter is a finished draft of &quot;Apologeticus&quot;. There arises also the question of similarity to Minucius Felix&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Octavius&quot;. Some paragraphs are shared by both texts; it is not known which predated the other.

Tertullian&#x27;s brief &quot;De testimonio animae&quot; (&quot;Concerning the Evidences of the Soul&quot;) is an appendix to the &quot;Apologeticus&quot;, intended to illustrate the meaning of the phrase &quot;testimonium animae naturaliter christianae&quot; in chapter 17).

==Authorship==
Not much is known about the life of Quintus Septimus Florens Tertullian. Some scholars believe him to have been a presbyter (priest) of the Christian Church, the son of a Roman centurion, and have him training to be a lawyer in Rome. Others, like David Wright, find that to be highly improbable. &quot;No firm evidence places him in Rome at all, or for that matter anywhere outside of Carthage… It is in the well-educated circles in Carthage,&quot; Wright argues, &quot;that Tertullian most securely belongs&quot;. Sometime after his conversion to the Christian faith, Tertullian left the Orthodox Church in favor of the Montanist movement, which he remained a part of for at least 10–15 years of his active life and whose influence can be seen in many of his later works.

==Ascribed date==
&quot;Apologeticus&quot;, his most famous apologetic work, was written in Carthage in the summer or autumn of AD 197, during the reign of :Septimius Severus. Using this date, most scholars agree that Tertullian&#x27;s conversion to Christianity occurred sometime before 197, possibly around 195. It was written before the edict of Septimius Severus (AD 202), and consequently, the laws to which Tertullian took exception were those under which the Christians of the 1st and 2nd centuries had been convicted.

==Oldest extant manuscripts==
&quot;The present treatise depends on three authorities, none of them comprising the entire work. The first printed edition, by Martin Mesnart at Paris in 1545, containing chapters 1-19, was made from a manuscript now lost, but which seems to have been a copy of the already mutilated original of the eleventh-century codex Agobardinus (now at Paris). This, our oldest extant authority, contains a number of Tertullian&#x27;s works, and of the present treatise chapters 1-30; in the first sentence of chapter 21 the copyist, following his original, which had lost a number of pages, passed on (without apparently noticing any discrepancy) to the middle of a sentence near the beginning of a different work &quot;On The Dress of Women&quot;.&quot;

&quot;The study of the manuscripts of Tert. has established that in the Middle Ages several collection of works of this author were in existence1:
# The collection of the Codex Agobardinus, the oldest extant manuscript of Tert.2.
# The collection of the manuscript of Troyes 523 (Codex Trecensis) of the twelfth century3.
# A collection represented by a number of manuscripts, which derive from a lost Codex Cluniacensis and a likewise lost manuscript from Hirsau (Württemberg), the Hirsaugiensis4.

==Addressees and audience==
This work is ostensibly addressed to the provincial governors of the Roman Empire, more specifically the magistrates of Carthage- &quot;that the truth, being forbidden to defend itself publicly, may reach the ears of the rulers by the hidden path of letters&quot;— and thus bears resemblance to the Greek apologues. It is structured as an appeal on behalf of the Christians and pleads &quot;for toleration of Christianity, attacking pagan superstition, rebutting charges against Christian morality, and claiming that Christians are no danger to the State but useful citizens&quot;. Its readership is likely to have been composed of Christians, whose faith was reinforced through Tertullian&#x27;s defense against rationalizations and rumours and who &quot;would have been hugely enheartened by Tertullian’s matchless confidence in the superiority of the Christian religion&quot;.

==Genre==
&quot;Apologeticus&quot; has the typical concerns of other apologetic works of his time, though it is presented in a much more complex manner. According to Wright, the text is constantly shifting &quot;from the philosophical mode to the rhetorical and even juridical&quot;. Drawing from his training in literature and law, Tertullian demonstrates his talents as a Latinist and a rhetorician in an attempt to defend his newfound Christian faith. Tertullian&#x27;s modern editor :Otto Bardenhewer further contends that Apologeticus is calm in tone, &quot;a model of judicial discussion&quot;. Unlike previous apologists of Christianity, whose appeals for tolerance were made in the name of reason and humanity, Tertullian, influenced by his legal training, spoke as a jurist convinced of the injustice of the laws under which the Christians were persecuted.

==Summary of &quot;Apologeticus&quot;==
The following outline and summary is based on Robert D. Sider&#x27;s translation of &quot;Apologeticus&quot;.

===Introduction and addressing of unjust treatment of the Christians (Chapters 1–6)===
The first section of Apology is concerned with the unjust treatment of the Christians, which Tertullian believes stems from the ignorance of the pagan populace. Simply put, he argues that people praise what they know and hate what they do not. To Tertullian this becomes evident in the cases of people who once hated because they were ignorant towards that they hated, and once their ignorance was gone, so was their hate. Their hatred prevents them from investigating more closely and acknowledging the goodness that is inherent in Christianity, and so they remain ignorant. And there is good in Christianity, Tertullian claims, despite the fact that people remain ignorant to it. Even when brought forth and accused, true Christians do not tremble with fear or deny their faith. It is the authorities that display bad behavior when they deny proper criminal treatment to the Christians. He argues that if Christians are to be treated as criminals, they should not be treated differently from ordinary criminals, who are free to answer to charges, to cross-question and defend themselves. In reality, the Christians are not free to say anything that will clear their name or ensure that the judge conducts a fair trial. If an individual says he is not a Christian, he is tortured until he says he is; if he admits to being a Christian, the authorities want to hear that he is not and torture him until he denies it. They resort to any means necessary to force them to either deny or confess, anything to acquit him. If all this done to someone simply for admitting to be a Christian, then they are surely making a mockery of Roman laws by basing all the charges on the name &quot;Christian&quot;. Before hating the name, one must look at and study the founder and the school.

In addressing the charges, Tertullian plans to show the hypocrisy that surrounds these charges, demonstrating that those crimes exist among the pagan prosecutors as well. Then he analyzes the laws, claiming it suspicious that a law should refuse to be examined for error and worthless if it demands obedience without examination. If a law is found having an error and being unjust, should it not be reformed or even condemned? Faulty laws have no place in a just judicial system and should thus not be applied and observed. Here Tertullian mentions :Nero, and to a certain extent :Domitian, as examples of emperors who raged against the Christians through the use of unjust laws, simply for condemning &quot;some magnificent good&quot;. He then brings up the good laws, and asks what has become of them; those that &quot;restrained extravagance and bribery&quot;, &quot;protected their [women&#x27;s] modesty and sobriety&quot;, of the &quot;conjugal happiness so fostered by high moral living that for nearly six hundred years after Rome was founded no sued for divorce&quot;. These traditions and laws are being ignored, neglected and destroyed and yet Rome chooses to concern itself with the &quot;crimes&quot; committed by the Christians.

===Charges based on rumor answered (Chapters 7–9)===
Tertullian begins by addressing the charges based on rumors, charges that vary from murdering and eating babies to committing incestuous and adulterous acts. Ultimately, he argues, they are simply rumors, for no evidence has ever been brought forth. No one has ever seen believers gather and supposedly commit impure acts or heard the cry of a crying baby because meetings and rituals are rarely performed in front of non-believers. It&#x27;s all just lies and rumors meant to slander the Christian faith. Tertullian then makes the claim that Romans themselves are guilty of the very crimes it claims the Christians do. People from every age are sacrificed to Saturn and Jupiter all throughout the empire. The arenas are filled with the blood of those that fight, and the Romans even consume the animals that eat the bloodied bodies of the dead. For the Christians, murder is strictly forbidden; there is to be no killing or spilling of human blood, and that includes the killing the baby in the womb, for it would be destroying its soul. Neither are Christians allowed to eat meat that still has blood. 

Of the charges of incest and adultery, Tertullian says that Christians are not guilty of them, for they refrain from adultery and from fornicating before marriage, thus ensuring that they are safe from incest. Such behavior is different from that of the Romans, who through their immoral acts commit incest. This comes about simply through the case of mistaken identity: men go off and commit adultery, begetting children all throughout the empire who later unknowingly have intercourse with their own kin by mistake. In his attempt to make the Romans acknowledge their engagement in these acts, Tertullian hopes to demonstrate that Christians behave much differently from what they are accused of and that the charges should not hold.

===Charges of more &quot;manifest crimes&quot; answered (Chapters 10–45)===

Of the more &quot;manifest crimes&quot;, as Tertullian refers to them, he first addresses the charges of sacrilege and says that Christians do not worship the pagan gods because the gods are not real, do not exist and thus hold no power or control over anything. Saturn, he claims, was once a mere man, as Roman lore and history will demonstrate. He then refutes further claims that the gods received their divinity through death, and wonders what business would the gods have with wanting ministers and assistants that are already dead. Such powerless beings cannot even be responsible for the rise and success of the Roman Empire. Furthermore, the character and nature of the gods themselves leave much to be desired; they are filled with rage, incestuous thoughts, envy, and jealousy. Why then should such imperfect and wicked beings be worthy of praise? He makes an even greater argument in referring to the pagan gods as demons, whose sole purpose is the subversion and destruction of mankind. They corrupt the souls of men by passions and lusts and rather successfully procuring &quot;for themselves a proper diet of fumes and blood offered to their statues&#x27; images.&quot; In this way they draw attention to themselves and prevent people from turning to the true God. But even the demons acknowledge the power of God, and acknowledging this should be enough to clear the Christians of charges of sacrilege. For Tertullian, the Romans are at fault here for worshipping the wrong religion, not that of the one true God. But if the gods are real, and if the Christians are guilty of sacrilege, what does that say about Rome? The people all worship different gods and often treat their images with less respect than they deserve, using any opportunity to pawn their statues off and use them as sources of income. Tertullian further criticizes their literature, practices and ceremonies, calling them absurd and criticizing their philosophers’ disgraceful actions. Socrates would swear by dogs and Diogenes and Varro made less than respectful comments concerning the deities. The plays constantly make jokes about and mockery of the gods. Surely, he argues, the plays and the masks must be disrespectful to the gods. It is the Romans then that are guilty of sacrilege and impiety. 

Christians do not venerate these false and dead gods, nor do they treat them in such a casual and careless manner. They worship the One God, the Creator of the universe. Unlike the pagan gods, He is real and His very existence is proven by the testimony of the soul, which cries out &quot;God&quot; despite its weakened and fallen state. His works and the works of his prophets are preserved from Moses—whose life took place 1,000 years before the Trojan War and predates both Saturn and much of ancient Rome&#x27;s literary tradition—to many other key biblical figures. Tertullian goes on to briefly discuss the revelation of God through Christ. In order to do that, he speaks of the relationship between the Jewish people and God; they once enjoyed much favor from God but became &quot;so filled with presumptuous confidence in their ancestors that they strayed from their teaching into manners of the world&quot;. Christ comes to re-establish the true doctrine; He is embodiment of Word and Reason, having been brought forth by God and thus having the title of Son of God. He adds, &quot;his ray of God, then, was ever foretold in the past descended into a certain virgin and, formed as flesh in her womb, and was born man mingled (later changed to ‘united’) with God&quot;. Having given an explanation of the nature and divinity of Christ, Tertullian shifts to the charges of treason. 

To the charges that Christians do not offer sacrifice to Caesar, Tertullian says that it is practically useless to do that, for it is not in their power to give Caesar health, wealth and power. What they can offer to him they do through the use of prayer, because only God has absolute power and from him comes the emperor. He alone brings up empires and takes them down and only he is responsible for granting Caesar power, health and wealth; &quot;We ask for them [emperors] a long life, undisturbed power, security at home, brave armies, a faithful Senate, an upright people, a peaceful world, and everything for which a man or a Caesar prays&quot;. Tertullian affirms that by praying for him, Christians are effectively putting Roman interests in God&#x27;s hands as well as commending Caesar to God. In no way do their meetings endanger the state, nor do they involve plotting against the emperor, the senate, or the empire. Their treatment of the Roman Empire exhibits the same respect and well wishes that they display upon to their neighbor. Any other behavior would not be the sign of a good Christian.

Tertullian has addressed the charges and demonstrated that the charges faced by Christians are based on lies and rumors and that no such things have been committed. After all he has demonstrated, Tertullian marvels at how the pagan prosecutors still claim that being a Christian is a crime against the empire. Christianity in general presents no threat to public order and thus its members should be allowed to meet and live in peace.

===Portrait of Christian society and of philosophy (Chapters 39–47)===
Tertullian then proceeds to give an explanation of Christian life and practices. He describes the manner in which they come together to worship and please God; to pray for each other as well as for the emperor and the empire, to study and consider the Holy Scriptures, and to share food—but not before offering prayers and thanks to God. Afterwards everyone is free to share a song or something they learned from scripture, praising God all throughout the night. He continues by explaining the practice of tithing, the concept of loving one another and of being brothers and sisters, being united by their way of life under the teachings of Christ. And being part of this world, Christians have to interact with it and with others. They shop at meat markets and local shops, go to the baths and stay at inns just like everyone else, though in everything they do, they &quot;bear in mind that we owe thanks to the Lord our God who created us&quot;. Despite this, the persecutors and accusers fail to recognize innocence when they see it, persecuting and treating the Christians unjustly. Christians know true innocence because they have learned and inherited it from God; they recognize and understand the eternal punishment that exists apart from God and acknowledge and fear the one who passes that real and true Judgment. Tertullian declares, &quot;in a word, we fear God, not the proconsul&quot;. He also addresses the claim that Christianity is more than a philosophy, bringing up the philosophers that say, &quot;it [Christianity] teaches the virtues and profess morality, justice, patience, moderation, and chastity&quot;. He makes the case that if Christianity is just another kind of philosophy, it should be treated the same way, granted with the freedom to teach and spread their beliefs and practice, customs and rituals.

===Concluding considerations and remarks===
Tertullian concludes his apology by likening the struggle of the Christians to a man fighting a battle. The Christians take no pleasure in being persecuted and enduring trials, but as soldiers of Christ they too must fight for the truth, all, of course, for the glory of God. Addressing the magistrates, he says &quot;Crucify us- torture us- condemn us- destroy us! Your injustice is the proof of our innocence... When we are condemned by you, we are acquitted by God&quot;.

<text>Fernando Romeo Lucas García (4 July 1924 – 27 May 2006) was a military officer and politician who served as the 37th president of Guatemala from July 1, 1978, to March 23, 1982. He was elected as the nominee for the Institutional Democratic Party (with the support of the Revolutionary Party). During Lucas García&#x27;s regime, tensions between the radical left and the government increased. The military started to murder political opponents while counterinsurgency measures further terrorized populations of poor civilians.

== Franja Transversal del Norte ==
The first settler project in the FTN was in Sebol-Chinajá in Alta Verapaz. Sebol, then regarded as a strategic point and route through the Cancuén River, which communicated with Petén through the Usumacinta River on the border with Mexico, and the only road that existed was a dirt one built by President Lázaro Chacón in 1928. In 1958, during the government of General Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) financed infrastructure projects in Sebol. In 1960, then Army captain Fernando Romeo Lucas García inherited Saquixquib and Punta de Boloncó farms in northeastern Sebol. In 1963, he bought the farm &quot;San Fernando&quot; El Palmar de Sejux and finally bought the &quot;Sepur&quot; farm near San Fernando. During those years, Lucas was in the Guatemalan legislature and lobbied in Congress to boost investment in that area of the country.

In those years, the importance of the region was in livestock, exploitation of precious export wood, and archaeological wealth. Timber contracts were granted to multinational companies such as Murphy Pacific Corporation from California, which invested US$30 million in the colonization of southern Petén and Alta Verapaz and formed the North Impulsadora Company. Colonization of the area was made through a process by which inhospitable areas of the FTN were granted to native peasants.

In 1962, the DGAA became the National Institute of Agrarian Reform (INTA) by Decree 1551, which created the law of Agrarian Transformation. In 1964, INTA defined the geography of the FTN as the northern part of the departments of Huehuetenango, Quiché, Alta Verapaz, and Izabal, and that same year, priests of the Maryknoll order and the Order of the Sacred Heart began the first process of colonization, along with INTA, carrying settlers from Huehuetenango to the Ixcán sector in Quiché.

The Northern Transversal Strip was officially created by the government of General Carlos Arana Osorio in 1970 by Decree 60-70 in the Congress for agricultural development.

In 1977, when he stepped down as defense minister to pursue his presidential campaign, General Fernando Romeo Lucas García also happened to hold the position of coordinator of the megaproject of the Northern Transversal Strip, whose main objective was to bring production of to facilitate oil exploitation of that vast land. By managing this project, Lucas García obtained greater knowledge and interaction with the transnational companies that were in the area and increased his own personal economic interests in the region, given that his family-owned land there and he had commercial relationships with Shenandoah Oil company.

=== Cuchumaderas case ===

In 1977, the municipality of San Mateo Ixtatán signed a contract with Cuchumaderas company for the &quot;sanitation, reforestation, maintenance and exploitation of forests, based on the urgent need to build and maintain natural resources attacked by the pine beetle.&quot; Upon learning of the negotiation between the municipality and the company, town people forced the authorities to conduct an open meeting and explain the characteristics of the commitment; each of the members of the municipal corporation gave their account of the negotiation, showing contradictions that led to resignation of the mayor at the very same meeting. Despite threats received by some residents of San Mateo, they organized a local committee to defend the forest and started a lawsuit against the company. As a result, forest extraction processes were stopped.

Cuchumaderas was closely related to the interests of the military leaders who held political power in the 1970s and spread throughout the defined territory of the FTN; the forest wealth of San Mateo Ixtatán made it the target of economic interests in the Northern Transversal Strip. Ronald Hennessey, pastor of San Mateo Ixtatán during the Guatemala Civil War, arrived in October 1980, amid people&#x27;s fight against the presence of Cuchumaderas and accused in his writings as Cuchumaderas partners the following people: Lucas Garcia, who FTN director when Cuchumaderas was founded, general Otto Spiegler Noriega, who was the Chief of Staff of the Army and later became Minister of Defense under Lucas García; Jorge Spiegler Noriega, manager of the National Forestry Institute (INAFOR), and then-colonel Rodolfo Lobos Zamora, commander of Military Zone of Quiché. However, later in the Commercial Register, investigations showed that the owner of the company was a different person: it was the engineer Fernando Valle Arizpe, and was well known for being the husband of journalist Irma Flaquer until 1965. Valle Arizpe had developed close relations with senior officials and close members of the government of Lucas García, especially Donaldo Alvarez Ruiz, the Minister of Interior.

During the Lucas García administration, the Army Engineers Battalion built the road stretch from Cadenas (Petén / Izabal) to Fray Bartolomé de las Casas.

After the overthrow of Lucas Garcia on 23 March 1982, rose to power a military triumvirate headed by General Efraín Ríos Montt, along with Horacio Maldonado Shaad colonels and Francisco Gordillo. On 2 June 1982, international journalists interviewed Ríos Montt, who said the following regarding Lucas García government and FTN:

== Rise to power ==

Due to his seniority in the military and economic elites in Guatemala and his fluency fluent in Q&#x27;ekchi, one of the Guatemalan indigenous languages, Lucas García was the ideal official candidate for the 1978 elections. To further enhance his image, he was paired with the leftist doctor Francisco Villagrán Kramer as his running mate. Villagrán Kramer was a man of recognized democratic trajectory, having participated in the Revolution of 1944 and was linked to the interests of transnational corporations and elites, as he was one of Guatemala&#x27;s main advisers of agricultural, industrial, and financial chambers. Despite the democratic facade, the electoral victory was not easy. The establishment had to impose Lucas García, causing further discredit to the electoral system —which had already suffered fraud when General Laugerud was imposed in the 1974 elections.

In 1976, a student group called &quot;FRENTE&quot; emerged at the University of San Carlos, which completely swept all student body positions that were up for election that year. FRENTE leaders were primarily members of the Patriotic Workers&#x27; Youth, the Guatemalan Labor Party youth wing (Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo (PGT)). This Guatemalan communist party had worked in the shadows since it was illegalized in 1954. Unlike other Marxist organizations in Guatemala at the time, PGT leaders trusted the mass movement to gain power through elections.

FRENTE used its power within the student associations to launch a political campaign for the 1978 university general elections. It allied with leftist faculty members grouped in &quot;University Vanguard.&quot; The alliance was effective, and Oliverio Castañeda de León was elected as President of the Student Body and Saúl Osorio Paz as President of the university; plus, they had ties with the university workers union (STUSC) through their PGT connections. Osorio Paz gave space and support to the student movement, and instead of having a conflictive relationship with students, different representations combined to build a higher education institution of higher social projection. In 1978, the University of San Carlos became one of the sectors with more political weight in Guatemala; that year, the student movement, faculty, and University Governing Board -Consejo Superior Universitario- united against the government and were in favor of opening spaces for the neediest sectors. To expand its university extension, the Student Body (AEU) rehabilitated the &quot;Student House&quot; in downtown Guatemala City; they welcomed and supported families of villagers and peasants already sensitized politically. They also organized groups of workers in the informal trade.

At the beginning of his tenure as president, Saúl Osorio founded the weekly &quot;Siete Días en la USAC&quot;, which, besides reporting on the university&#x27;s activities, constantly denounced the violation of human rights, especially the repression against the popular movement. It also told what was happening with the revolutionary Nicaragua and El Salvador movements. The state university was a united and progressive institution for a few months, preparing to confront the State head-on.

FRENTE had to face the radical left, represented then by the Student Revolutionary Front &quot;Robin García&quot; (FERG), which emerged during the Labor Day march of 1 May 1978. FERG coordinated several student associations at different colleges within the University of San Carlos and public secondary education institutions. This coordination between legal groups came from the Guerrilla Army of the Poor (EGP), a guerrilla group that had appeared in 1972 and had its headquarters in the oil-rich region of northern Quiché department -i.e., the Ixil Triangle of Ixcán, Nebaj and Chajul in Franja Transversal del Norte. Although not strictly an armed group, FERG sought confrontation with government forces all the time, giving prominence to measures that could degenerate into mass violence and paramilitary activity. Its members were not interested in working within an institutional framework and never asked permission for their public demonstrations or actions.

On 7 March 1978, Lucas Garcia was elected president; shortly after, on 29 May 1978—in the late days of Laugerud García government—in the central square of Panzós, Alta Verapaz, members of the Zacapa Military Zone attacked a peaceful peasant demonstration, killing many people. The deceased, indigenous peasants who had been summoned in place were fighting for the legalization of public lands they had occupied for years. Their struggle faced them directly with investors who wanted to exploit the mineral wealth of the area, particularly oil reserves—by Basic Resources International and Shenandoah Oil— and nickel -EXMIBAL. The Panzós Massacre caused a stir at the university because of the high number of victims and conflicts arising from the exploitation of natural resources by foreign companies. In 1978, for example, Osorio Paz and other universities received death threats for their outspoken opposition to constructing an inter-oceanic pipeline that would cross the country to facilitate oil exploration. On June 8, the AEU organized a massive protest in downtown Guatemala City where speakers denounced the slaughter of Panzós and expressed their repudiation of the Laugerud García regime in stronger terms than ever before.

== Presidency (1978–1982) ==

Whereas under the previous administration, the human rights situation in Guatemala had improved, the regime of Lucas Garcia brought the repression to much the same level observed during the &quot;State of Siege&quot; period under former President Arana Osorio (1970–1974).

=== Initial protests and early crisis ===

On 4 August 1978, barely a month after he took office, high school, university students, and other popular movement sectors, organized the mass movement&#x27;s first urban protest of the Lucas García period. The demonstrations, intended as a march against violence, were attended by an estimated 10,000 people. The new Secretary of the Interior under President Lucas García, Donaldo Alvarez Ruiz, promised to break up any protests done without government permission, as the new government had realized that the opposition and Marxist left had a powerful organization by the time the new president was inaugurated. The protestors, having refused to ask for permission, were met by the Pelotón Modelo (Model Platoon) of the National Police. Employing new anti-riot gear donated by the United States Government, Platoon agents surrounded marchers and tear-gassed them. Students were forced to retreat, and dozens of people, primarily school-aged adolescents, were hospitalized. This was followed by more protests and death squad killings throughout the later part of the year. In September 1978, a general strike broke out to protest sharp increases in public transportation fares; the government responded harshly, arresting dozens of protesters and injuring many more. However, due to the campaign, the government agreed to the protesters&#x27; demands, including establishing a public transportation subsidy. Fearful that this concession would encourage more protests, the military government, along with state-sponsored paramilitary death squads, generated an unsafe situation for public leaders.

=== Increased insurgency and state repression: 1980–1982 ===

The effects of state repression on the population further radicalized individuals within the mass movement. They led and led to increased popular support for the insurgency. In late 1979, the EGP expanded its influence, controlling a large amount of territory in the Ixil Triangle in El Quiche and holding many demonstrations in Nebaj, Chajul, and Cotzal. At the same time the EGP was expanding its presence in the Altiplano, a new insurgent movement called the ORPA (Revolutionary Organization of Armed People) made itself known. Composed of local youths and university intellectuals, the ORPA developed out of the Regional de Occidente, movement, which split from the FAR-PGT in 1971. The ORPA&#x27;s leader, Rodrigo Asturias (a former activist with the PGT and first-born son of Nobel Prize-winning author Miguel Ángel Asturias), formed the organization after returning from exile in Mexico. ORPA established an operational base in the mountains and rain forests above the coffee plantations of southwestern Guatemala and in the Atitlan, where it enjoyed considerable popular support. On 18 September 1979, ORPA made its existence publicly known when it occupied the Mujulia coffee farm in the coffee-growing region of the Quezaltenango province to hold a political education meeting with the workers.

Insurgent movements active in the initial phase of the conflict, such as the FAR, also began to reemerge and prepare for combat. In 1980, guerrilla operations on both the urban and rural fronts greatly intensified, with the insurgency carrying out many overt acts of armed propaganda and assassinations of prominent right-wing Guatemalans and landowners. In 1980, armed insurgents assassinated prominent Ixil landowner Enrique Brol and president of the CACIF (Coordinating Committee of Agricultural, Commercial, Industrial, and Financial Associations) Alberto Habie. Encouraged by guerrilla advances elsewhere in Central America, the Guatemalan insurgents, especially the EGP, began to quickly expand their influence through a wide geographic area and across different ethnic groups, thus broadening the appeal of the insurgent movement and providing it with a more extensive popular base. In October 1980, a tripartite alliance was formalized between the EGP, the FAR and the ORPA as a precondition for Cuban-backing.

In early 1981, the insurgency mounted the largest offensive in the country&#x27;s history. This was followed by an additional offensive towards the end of the year, in which many civilians were forced to participate by the insurgents. Villagers worked with the insurgency to sabotage roads and army establishments and destroy anything of strategic value to the armed forces. By 1981, an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 members of Guatemala&#x27;s indigenous community actively supported the insurgency. Guatemalan Army Intelligence (G-2) estimated a minimum of 360,000 indigenous supporters of the EGP alone.

=== Civil war in the city ===


On 31 January 1980, Guatemala got worldwide attention when the Spanish Embassy in Guatemala City was burnt down, resulting in 37 deaths, including embassy personnel, high-ranked Guatemalan former government officials, and former vice president Eduardo Cáceres. A group of native people from El Quiché occupied the embassy in a desperate attempt to bring attention to the issues they were having with the Army in that region of the country, which was rich in oil and had been recently populated as part of the &quot;Franja Transversal del Norte&quot; agricultural program. In the end, thirty-seven people died after a fire started within the embassy after the police force tried to occupy the building; after that, Spain broke its diplomatic relationship with Guatemala.

In the months following the Spanish Embassy Fire, the human rights situation continued to deteriorate. The daily number of killings by official and unofficial security forces increased from an average of 20 to 30 in 1979 to a conservative estimate of 30 to 40 daily in 1980. Human rights sources estimated that 5,000 Guatemalans were killed by the government for &quot;political reasons&quot; in 1980 alone, making it the worst human rights violator in the hemisphere after El Salvador. In a report titled &quot;Guatemala: A Government Program of Political Murder&quot;, Amnesty International stated, &quot;Between January and November 1980, some 3,000 people described by government representatives as &quot;subversives&quot; and &quot;criminals&quot; were either shot on the spot in political assassinations or seized and murdered later; at least 364 others seized in this period have not yet been accounted for.&quot;

The repression and excessive force used by the government against the opposition was such that it became a source of contention within Lucas Garcia&#x27;s administration itself. This contention within the government caused Lucas Garcia&#x27;s Vice President, Francisco Villagrán Kramer, to resign on September 1, 1980. In his resignation, Kramer cited his disapproval of the government&#x27;s human rights record as one of the primary reasons for his resignation. He then went into voluntary exile in the United States, taking a position in the Legal Department of the Inter-American Development Bank.

On 5 September 1980, took place a terrorist attack by Ejército Guerrillero de los Pobres (EGP) right in front of the Guatemalan National Palace, then the headquarters of the Guatemalan government. The intention was to prevent the Guatemalan people from supporting a massive demonstration that the government of Lucas Garcia had prepared for Sunday, 7 September 1980. In the attack, six adults and a little boy died after two bombs inside a vehicle went off.

There was an undetermined number of wounded and heavy material losses, not only from art pieces from the National Palace but from all the surrounding buildings, particularly in the Lucky Building, which is right across the Presidential Office. Among the deceased was Domingo Sánchez, Secretary of Agriculture driver; Joaquín Díaz y Díaz, car washer; and Amilcar de Paz, security guard.

The attacks against private financial, commercial, and agricultural targets increased in the Lucas Garcia years, as the leftist Marxist groups saw those institutions as &quot;reactionaries&quot; and &quot;millionaire exploiters&quot; who were collaborating with the genocidal government. The following is a non-exhaustive list of the terrorist attacks that occurred in Guatemala City and are presented in the UN Commission report:

Despite advances by the insurgency, the insurgency made a series of fatal strategic errors. The successes of the revolutionary forces in Nicaragua against the Somoza regime and the insurgency&#x27;s victories against the Lucas Garcia government led rebel leaders to falsely conclude that a military equilibrium was being reached in Guatemala. Thus the insurgency underestimated the government&#x27;s military strength. and found itself overwhelmed and unable to secure its advances and protect the indigenous civilian population from reprisals by the security forces.

=== Operation Ceniza ===

In response to the guerrilla offensive in early 1981, the Guatemalan Army began mobilizing for a large-scale rural counter-offensive. The Lucas government instituted a policy of forced recruitment and began organizing a &quot;task-force&quot; model for fighting the insurgency, by which strategic mobile forces were drawn from larger military brigades. The army, to curtail civilian participation in the insurgency and provide greater distinction between &quot;hostile&quot; and compliant communities in the countryside, resorted to a series of &quot;civic action&quot; measures. The military under Chief of Staff Benedicto Lucas García (the President&#x27;s brother) began to search out communities in which to organize and recruit civilians into pro-government paramilitary patrols, who would combat the insurgents and kill their collaborators.

In 1980 and 1981, the United States, under the Reagan administration, delivered $10.5 million worth of Bell 212 and Bell 412 helicopters and $3.2 million worth of military trucks and jeeps to the Guatemalan Army. In 1981, the Reagan administration also approved a $2 million covert CIA program for Guatemala.

On April 15, 1981, EGP rebels attacked a Guatemalan Army patrol from the village of Cocob near Nebaj, killing five personnel. On April 17, 1981, a reinforced company of Airborne troops was deployed to the village. They discovered foxholes, guerrillas and a hostile population. The local people to support the guerrillas fully. &quot;The soldiers were forced to fire at anything that moved.&quot; The army killed 65 civilians, including 34 children, five adolescents, 23 adults, and two elderly people.

In July 1981, the armed forces initiated a new phase of counterinsurgency operations under the code-name &quot;Operación Ceniza,&quot; or &quot;Operation Ashes,&quot; which lasted through March 1982. The purpose of the operation was to &quot;separate and isolate the insurgents from the civilian population.&quot; During &quot;Operación Ceniza,&quot; some 15,000 troops were deployed on a gradual sweep through the predominantly indigenous Altiplano region, comprising the departments of El Quiché and Huehuetenango.

Large numbers of civilians were killed or displaced in the Guatemalan military&#x27;s counterinsurgency operations. The army, to alienate the insurgents from their civilian base, carried out large-scale mass killings of unarmed civilians, burned villages and crops, and butchered animals, destroying survivors&#x27; means of livelihood. Sources with the human rights office of the Catholic Church estimated the death toll from the counterinsurgency in 1981 at 11,000, with most of the victims indigenous peasants of the Guatemalan highlands. Other sources and observers put the death toll due to government repression in 1981 at between 9,000 and 13,500.

As army repression intensified in the countryside, relations between the Guatemalan military establishment and the Lucas Garcia regime worsened. Professionals within the Guatemalan military considered the approach counterproductive because the Lucas government&#x27;s strategy of military action and systematic terror overlooked the social and ideological causes of the insurgency while radicalizing the civilian population.

Together with the government in neighboring El Salvador, the Lucas Garcia regime was cited as the worst human rights violator in the Western-Hemisphere. The daily number of killings by government forces and officially sanctioned death squads increased from an average of 20 to 30 in 1979 to a conservative estimate of 30 to 40 in 1980. An estimated 5,000 civilians were killed by government forces in Guatemala in 1980. In 1981, the number of killings and assassinations by government forces exceeded 9,000.

The United States, Israel, and Argentina all provided military support to the regime in the form of pipeline aid, sales, credits, training, and counterinsurgency advisors. Between FS 1978 and FS 1980, the U.S. provided $8.5 million in military assistance, mainly FMS credit sales, and approximately $1.8 million in export licensing for commercial arms sales, despite a 1977 congressional prohibition on military aid. In 1980 and 1981, the United States also delivered three Bell 212 and six Bell 412 helicopters worth $10.5 million to the army. In June 1981, the Reagan Administration announced a $3.2 million delivery of 150 military trucks and jeeps to the army, justifying these shipments by blaming the guerrillas for the violence perpetrated against civilians.

In its later years, Lucas Garcia&#x27;s regime was perceived as a threat by the military establishment in Guatemala, as it engaged in actions that compromised the legitimacy of the Guatemalan military with both the populace and within its ranks, thereby undermining the effectiveness of the counterinsurgency war. In the 1982 elections, Lucas Garcia went against both popular opinion and the military&#x27;s interests by endording Angel Anibal Guevara, his defense minister.

=== 1982 coup d&#x27;état and &quot;state of siege&quot; ===

On March 23, 1982, junior officers under the command of General Efraín Ríos Montt staged a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; and deposed General Romeo Lucas Garcia. Aside from the junior officers involved in engineering the coup, the coup was not supported by any entities within the Lucas government. At the time of the coup, the most of Lucas Garcia&#x27;s senior officers were unaware of any previous coup plotting on the part of the junior officers or any other entity. General Lucas was reportedly prepared to resist the coup and could have quickly opposed the coup with his contingent of troops stationed at the presidential palace, but was coerced into surrendering by being shown his mother and sister held with rifles to their heads.

== Prosecution ==

In 1999, the Audiencia Nacional of Spain began criminal proceedings for accusations of torture and genocide against the Maya population after a formal petition introduced by Rigoberta Menchú. However, the Venezuelan Supreme Tribunal denied the extradition on 22 June 2005, arguing &quot;...medical reports from García&#x27;s wife showing that her husband is severely affected by the Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.&quot;

He died in exile in Puerto la Cruz, Venezuela, where he had lived for 12 years with his wife, Elsa Cirigliano, suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s and various other ailments, at the age of 81.

In May 2018, his brother Manuel Benedicto Lucas García, who served as his Army Chief of Staff, would receive a 58-year prison sentence after being convicted for a 1981 incident that involved torture and rape.

<text>Kjell Eugenio Laugerud García (24 January 1930 – 9 December 2009) was a Guatemalan military officer who served as the 36th president of Guatemala from 1974 until 1978. A member of the National Liberation Movement, he previously served as General Staff of the Army from 1970 to 1972 and Minister of national defence from 1972 to 1973 under President Carlos Arana Osorio.

His presidency, which occurred during the Civil War, was characterized by being more tolerant of the opposition, by his efficient response to the 1976 earthquake and an increase in oil exploitation in the Northern Transversal Strip.
==Early life and career==

=== Early life ===
Kjell Eugenio Laugerud García was born on 24 January 1930. He was the son of a Norwegian father and a Guatemalan mother. 

=== Military career ===
During his military career, Laugerud received part of his training in the United States, attending classes at Fort Benning, Georgia, and at Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He would hold important positions such as the management of the Polytechnic School, as a delegate to the Inter-American Defense Board between 1968 and 1970, and as the head of the Army General Staff. During the presidency of Carlos Arana Osorio, Laugerud was promoted to general and appointed Minister of Defense. 

=== 1974 presidential campaign ===
Laugerud became a candidate for the 1974 general election, running on the endorsement of the National Liberation Movement-Institutional Democratic Party coalition (MLN-PID). In the second round of elections, Laugerud defeated Efraín Ríos Montt, candidate of the Guatemalan Christian Democracy party. However, the results of the election were marred by violence and were challenged by the opposition, which questioned the legitimacy of the electoral process. 

== Presidency (1974–1978) ==
Laugerud was sworn in as the 36th president on 1 July 1974, inside the legislative palace. In his inaugural address, he emphasized the need for national harmony and unity to promote the economic and social well-being of the country.

=== Earthquake of 1976 ===

Guatemala was struck with a 7.5-moment magnitude earthquake on 4 February 1976 which generated an unprecedented crisis in the country. Approximately 258,000 homes were destroyed as well as 40% of the national hospital infrastructure. Laugerud García established the National Reconstruction Committee and presented the reconstruction program at a press conference on 18 March 1976. Serious cases of corruption occurred during reconstruction. However, at the end of his government, the infrastructure was recovered and in ten years there were no more vestiges of destruction. In a 1990 interview, Laugerud revealed that he still had nightmares about the earthquake.

=== Civil War ===

==== Massacre of Panzós ====
Just before the end of his term, Laugerud was also faced with the consequences of a massacre of Kekchi Mayan demonstrators by the military in Panzós, in which the Army killed 53 unarmed civilians and another 47 were wounded.
=== Foreign policy ===
During his term, Guatemala had continuing disputes with neighboring Belize. In 1977, after the Carter administration published a report critical of the human rights situation in Guatemala, Laugerud announced that the country would no longer accept U.S. military aid. Guatemala did, receive funds that had already been appropriated for that year and later turned to other nations, such as Israel, Spain, Belgium, Sweden, Taiwan, and Yugoslavia, for military aid and arms supplies.

== Post-presidency ==
In 1983, Laugerud and three other ex-presidents were forced to retire from the Army.

<text>Comandante is a political documentary film by American director Oliver Stone. In the film, Stone interviews Cuban leader Fidel Castro on a diverse range of topics. Stone and his film crew visited Castro in Cuba for three days in 2002, and the film was released in 2003, having its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival early that year.
The film was partly produced by HBO and was planned for broadcast. Shortly before airtime, after Cuba executed three hijackers of a ferry to the United States and imprisoned more than 70 political dissidents, HBO pulled the program. To this day, it still has not been given a video release in the USA.

<text>Carlos Manuel Arana Osorio (July 17, 1918 – December 6, 2003) was a military officer and politician who served as the 35th president of Guatemala from 1970 to 1974. A member of the National Liberation Movement, his government enforced torture, disappearances, and killings against political and military adversaries, as well as common criminals.

Arana was born in Barberena, in the department of Santa Rosa. A Colonel in the Army, he oversaw counterinsurgency efforts in Zacapa and Izabal, where thousands were killed by the military from 1966 to 1968. In July 1970, he became president following an electoral process generally considered &quot;non-transparent&quot; on a platform promising a crackdown on law-and-order issues and stability; his vice president was Eduardo Cáceres.

In November 1970, Arana imposed a &quot;State of Siege,&quot; followed by heightened counterinsurgency measures. His government committed severe human rights violations and used state terrorism in its war against the guerrillas, including government-sponsored &quot;death squads.&quot; Security forces regularly detained, disappeared, tortured, and extrajudicially executed political opponents, student leaders, suspected guerrilla sympathizers, and trade unionists. Arana&#x27;s government received large-scale military support from the United States, including weapons, technical support, and military advisors. The Guatemalan Human Rights Commission estimated that 20,000 Guatemalans were killed or &quot;disappeared&quot; under the Arana administration.

Carlos Arana, a freemason, was the first of the string of Institutional Democratic Party military rulers who would dominate Guatemalan politics in the 1970s and 1980s (his predecessor, Julio Méndez Montenegro, while dominated by the army, was a civilian).
He also served as the ambassador to Nicaragua.

== Early life ==

Arana was born in Barberena, in the department of Santa Rosa, on July 17, 1918. He is the nephew of the former head of the Guatemalan armed forces, Francisco Javier Arana, who was one of the three members of the revolutionary junta that governed Guatemala from 20 October 1944 to 15 March 1945 during the early part of the Guatemalan Revolution. Carlos Arana Osorio joined the military and became an officer. He was also an anti-communist politician and freemason. In 1955, he was appointed director of a Polytechnic School that the government reopened following the 1954 Guatemalan coup d&#x27;état.

== Military career ==
In 1964 and 1965, the Guatemalan Armed Forces began engaging in counterinsurgency actions against the MR-13 in eastern Guatemala. In February and March 1964, the Guatemalan Air Force began a selective bombing campaign against MR-13 bases in Izabal, which was followed by counterinsurgency sweeps in the neighboring province of Zacapa under the code-name &quot;Operation Falcon&quot; in September and October 1965. These operations were supplemented by increased U.S. military assistance. Beginning in 1965, the U.S. government sent Green Berets and CIA advisers to instruct the Guatemalan military in counterinsurgency (anti-guerrilla warfare). In addition, U.S. police and &quot;Public Safety&quot; advisers were dispatched to reorganize the urban security structures.

In a clandestine operation in March 1966, a total of thirty Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo (PGT, Guatemalan Party of Labor) associates were seized, detained, tortured, and executed by the security forces. When law students at the University of San Carlos used legal measures (such as &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petitions) to require the government to present the detainees in court, some students &quot;disappeared.&quot; These &quot;disappearances&quot; became notorious as one of the first significant instances of mass forced disappearance in Latin American history. The use of this tactic was augmented dramatically after the inauguration of President Julio César Méndez Montenegro, who – in a bid to placate and secure the support of the military establishment – gave it carte blanche to engage in &quot;any means necessary&quot; to pacify the country.

With the explicit authorization of the Mendez administration and increased military aid from the United States, the army – accompanied by militarized police units – mounted an extensive pacification effort in the departments of Zacapa and Izabal in October 1966. This campaign, dubbed &quot;Operation Guatemala,&quot; was put under the supervision of Colonel Carlos Arana Osorio, with guidance and training from 1,000 US Green Berets.

Under Colonel Arana&#x27;s jurisdiction and in the city, military strategists armed and fielded various paramilitary death squads to supplement regular army and police units in clandestine terror operations against the FAR&#x27;s (Rebel Armed Forces, ) civilian support base. Personnel, weapons, funds, and operational instructions were supplied to these organizations by the armed forces. The death squads operated with impunity – permitted by the government to kill any civilians deemed to be either insurgents or insurgent collaborators. The paramilitaries or &quot;commissioners&quot; who comprised the clandestine terrorist groups organized by the army were primarily right-wing fanatics with ties to the MLN, founded and led by Mario Sandoval Alarcón, a former participant in the 1954 coup. By 1967, the Guatemalan army claimed to have 1,800 civilian paramilitaries under its direct control. One of the most notorious death squads operating during this period was the MANO, also known as the &quot;Mano Blanca&quot; (&quot;White Hand&quot;); initially formed by the MLN as a paramilitary front in 1966 to prevent President Méndez Montenegro from taking office, the MANO was quickly taken over by the military and incorporated into the state&#x27;s counter-terror apparatus. The members of the MANO were primarily army officers, and the organization received funding from wealthy landowners. It also received information from military intelligence.

Observers estimate that government forces killed or &quot;disappeared&quot; as many as 15,000 civilians in three years of the Mendez presidency. Amnesty International cited estimates that 3,000 to 8,000 peasants were killed by the army and paramilitary organizations in Zacapa and Izabal under Colonel Arana between October 1966 and March 1968. Other estimates put the death toll at 15,000 in Zacapa alone during the Mendez period. The victims included guerrilla sympathizers, peasants, labor union leaders, intellectuals, students, and other vaguely defined &quot;enemies of the government.&quot; Some observers referred to the policy of the Guatemalan government as &quot;White Terror&quot;—a term previously used to describe similar periods of anti-communist mass killing in countries such as Taiwan and Spain.

The growth of government-sponsored paramilitarism and the government&#x27;s use of &quot;any means necessary&quot; increased the opposition&#x27;s resistance level to ensure its survival. The &quot;White Terror&quot; (which led to the destruction of the FAR&#x27;s Ladino-peasant base in the eastern provinces) caused the MR-13 to retreat to Guatemala City. There, the MR-13 began to engage in selective killings of members of the security forces as well as U.S. military advisors. The insurgents assassinated the American ambassador to Guatemala, John Gordon Mein, in 1968 and the German ambassador to Guatemala, Karl Von Spreti, in 1970.

== Presidency (1970–1974) ==
In July 1970, with support from the Army, Colonel Carlos Arana Osorio assumed the presidency. He was the first of the string of Institutional Democratic Party military rulers who dominated Guatemalan politics in the 1970s and 1980s (his predecessor, Julio César Méndez, was nominally a civilian). Arana had served as the ambassador to Nicaragua during the Somoza regime. In a speech, President Arana stated, &quot;If it is necessary to turn the country into a cemetery in order to pacify it, I will not hesitate to do so.&quot; Despite minimal armed insurgent activity then, Osorio imposed a &quot;State of Siege&quot; in November 1970. During the &quot;State of Siege,&quot; the Osorio regime imposed a daily curfew from 9:00 PM to 5:00 AM. During that time, all vehicle and pedestrian traffic—including ambulances, fire engines, nurses, and physicians—was forbidden throughout the national territory.

The &quot;State of Siege&quot; was accompanied by increased government repression in the form of abductions, tortures, forced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings. A January 1971 secret bulletin of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency detailed how Guatemalan security forces &quot;quietly eliminated&quot; hundreds of suspected &quot;terrorists and bandits&quot; in the Guatemalan countryside. Though repression continued in the countryside, the &quot;White Terror&quot; of the Arana period was mainly urban and directed against the vestiges of the insurgency, which existed primarily in the city. High government sources were cited at the time by foreign journalists as acknowledging 700 executions by security forces or paramilitary death squads in the first two months of the &quot;State of Siege.&quot; According to Amnesty International and domestic human rights organizations such as the &#x27;Committee of Relatives of Disappeared Persons,&#x27; over 7,000 civilian opponents of the security forces were &#x27;disappeared&#x27; or found dead in 1970 and 1971, followed by an additional 8,000 in 1972 and 1973.

In October 1971, over 12,000 students at the University of San Carlos of Guatemala went on a general strike to protest the killing of students by the security forces; they called for an end to the &quot;state of siege.&quot; On 27 November 1971, the Guatemalan military responded to the upheaval with an extensive raid on the main campus of the university, seeking cached weapons. It mobilized 800 army personnel, tanks, helicopters, and armored cars for the raid. They conducted a room-to-room search of the entire campus but found no evidence or supplies.

The &quot;State of Siege&quot; remained in effect until the end of 1972, when the Osorio regime announced the military defeat of the insurgency. The end of the &quot;State of Siege&quot; coincided with the forced disappearance of much of the PGT&#x27;s central committee. In the period between January and September 1973, the Guatemalan Human Rights Commission documented the deaths and forced disappearances of 1,314 individuals by government death squads. This repression led to international human rights organizations characterizing the Guatemalan government as one of the world&#x27;s most repressive regimes. Amnesty International mentioned Guatemala as one of several countries under a human rights state of emergency while citing &quot;the high incidence of disappearances of Guatemalan citizens&quot; as a significant and continuing problem in its 1972–1973 annual report. The Guatemalan Human Rights Commission estimated that 20,000 people were killed or &quot;disappeared&quot; between 1970 and 1974 under the Arana government.

Under Arana, death squads were used not only as a counterinsurgency tactic but as a tactic for fighting crime. In one incident on 13 October 1972, ten people were knifed to death in the name of a death squad known as the &quot;Avenging Vulture.&quot; Guatemalan government sources told the U.S. Department of State that the &quot;Avenging Vulture&quot; and other similar death squads operating during the period were a &quot;smoke screen&quot; for extra-legal tactics the National Police employed against non-political delinquents. Overall, as many as 42,000 Guatemalan civilians were killed or &quot;disappeared&quot; during the Mendez and Arana regimes.

== Later life ==

Following his presidency, Arana withdrew from political life and founded a political party, Central Auténtica Nacionalista (CAN). The party participated in several elections but had little impact. He died in December 2003.

<text>Julio César Méndez Montenegro (November 23, 1915 – April 30, 1996) was a Guatemalan academic who served as the 34th president of Guatemala from July 1966 to July 1970. Mendez was elected on a platform promising democratic reforms and the curtailment of military power. The only civilian to occupy Guatemala&#x27;s presidency during the long period of military rule between 1954 and 1986. Nevertheless, his election and swearing in was considered a major turning point for the long military-led Guatemala. He was the first cousin of César Montenegro Paniagua whose kidnapping, torture and murder during the Julio César Méndez presidency is rumored to have been undertaken with presidential sanction.

== Presidency (1966–1970) ==

In 1966, the left-of-center Méndez defied odds after being elected and successfully sworn in as President of Guatemala. As a civilian who previously made a career as a law professor, Méndez&#x27;s election, despite challenges, was also considered a historical transition from longstanding military rule in Guatemala. At the time of Méndez&#x27;s election, Juan Jose Arévalo, who served as President of Guatemala from 1945 to 1951, was the only civilian to complete a full presidential term since Guatemala&#x27;s independence in 1847.

It was during the Mendez presidency that the United States dramatically expanded its military mission in Guatemala. Within days of Mendez taking office, US Colonel John Webber Jr. was dispatched to the country to assist in modernizing Guatemala&#x27;s counterinsurgency apparatus. Under Colonel Webber&#x27;s command, the United States expanded training within Guatemala&#x27;s 5,000-man army and outfitted the Guatemalan security forces with the most modern counterinsurgency equipment available. The United States also assisted the Guatemalan security forces in the implementation and use of counter-terrorism, and the establishment of counter-terror units under the supervision of U.S. police advisors. With increased US military support, the Guatemalan Army launched a counter-insurgency campaign that successfully combated and dispersed the left-wing guerrilla organizations fighting in the mountains and country. The guerrillas, including the Rebel Armed Forces (Fuerzas Armadas Rebeldes — FAR), then concentrated their attacks in Guatemala City, assassinating many leading representatives of the military government, U.S. military advisors, and the American ambassador John Gordon Mein, in 1968.

===&quot;White Terror&quot; and paramilitarism===

The repression that began to take shape under the presidency of Enrique Peralta Azurdia intensified under Mendez. With the onset of the Guatemalan army&#x27;s first major anti-guerrilla offensive, the army and security forces carried out widespread extrajudicial killing, torture and forced disappearances. The repression was most intense in the southeastern region of the country, particularly in the department of Zacapa, under the command of Colonel Carlos Manuel Arana Osorio.

In March 1966, thirty Guatemalan Party of Labour (PGT) associates were kidnapped, tortured, and killed by the security forces. This was one of the first major instances of forced disappearance in Latin American history. These 30 disappearances marked the beginning of a dramatic increase of state repression in 1966. When law students at the University of San Carlos used legal measures (such as &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petitions) to require the government to present the detainees at court, some of the students were &quot;disappeared&quot; in turn.

In exchange for military support of his administration, President Mendez authorized the armed forces to use &quot;any means necessary&quot; to suppress the insurgency. No longer bound to the rule of law, the security forces resorted to terror to control the population and dismantle the civilian support base of the insurgency. Guatemalan government forces killed or &quot;disappeared&quot; thousands of civilians during the escalation of the counterinsurgency. The repression was most intense in the eastern regions where the MR-13 operated, and in Guatemala City where the PGT operated. In eastern Guatemala, government forces engaged in the massacre of civilians and destruction of peasant communities as a means of breaking up guerrilla bases.

Some observers referred to the policy of the Guatemalan government as &quot;White Terror&quot; -a term previously used to describe similar periods of anti-communist mass killing in countries such as Taiwan and Spain- Observers estimate that as many as 15,000 Guatemalans were killed by the military and government-led death squads in three years of Mendez&#x27;s presidency to eliminate fewer than 300 Marxist guerrillas. Amnesty International cited lower estimates of 3,000 to 8,000 peasants killed by the military during that time. Colonel Arana, who commanded the Guatemalan army, earned the nickname &quot;Butcher of Zacapa&quot; or &quot;Jackal of the East.&quot; The victims included guerrilla sympathizers, labor union leaders, intellectuals, students, and people vaguely defined &quot;enemies of the government.&quot;

The government&#x27;s use of &quot;any means necessary&quot; resulted in the opposition increasing its level of resistance to ensure its survival. The &quot;White Terror&quot; (which led to the destruction of the FAR&#x27;s ladino peasant base in the eastern provinces) caused the MR-13 to retreat to Guatemala City. There, the MR-13 began to engage in selective killings of members of the security forces as well as U.S. military advisors. The insurgents assassinated the American ambassador to Guatemala, John Gordon Mein, in 1968, and the German ambassador to Guatemala, Karl Von Spreti, in 1970.

==== SCUGA ====

Following the inauguration of Méndez Montenegro, he appointed Colonel Rafael Arriaga Bosque to Defense Minister. Mendez activated the &#x27;Special Commando Unit of the Guatemalan Army&#x27; (SCUGA). The SCUGA was placed under the command of Colonel Máximo Zepeda in January 1967, after which point it assumed command over most of the Guatemalan government&#x27;s urban counterinsurgency operations against PGT. Composed of both military and civilian personnel, the SCUGA functioned both as a counter-terror apparatus and as an intelligence-gathering apparatus. SCUGA commandos routinely carried out abductions, bombings, street assassinations, torture, &quot;disappearances&quot; and executions of both documented and suspected communists. The SCUGA often collaborated with the Fourth Corps of the Guatemalan National Police, which carried out similar activities. Together these forces often carried out various counter-terror and counter-insurgency operations under the guise of fictitious paramilitary death squads and anti-communist front organizations (known by acronyms such as the NOA, CADEG, CRAG and RAYO). In addition to engaging in operations under the guise of para-militarism, the SCUGA nominally worked with paramilitary death squads such as the infamous &quot;Mano Blanca&quot; (&quot;White Hand&quot;).

==== Mano Blanca ====
Mano Blanca, or the Movement of Organized Nationalist Action, was set up in 1966 as a front for the MLN to carry out its more violent activities, along with many other similar groups, including the New Anticommunist Organization and the Anticommunist Council of Guatemala. These three groups operated within the United States supported government arm known as the Regional Telecommunications Center, which linked them to various government, military and police agencies. This network was built on the Committees against Communism created by the Central Intelligence Agency after the coup in 1954. The members of Mano Blanco were largely army officers, and the outfit received a lot of its funding from planters. It also received information from military intelligence. It was one of the only death squads directly affiliated with a political party. Most such groups were &quot;phantom organizations,&quot; created so that the Guatemalan military could carry out illicit activities.

Armed with this support, Mano Blanca began a campaign described by the United States Department of State as one of &quot;kidnappings, torture, and summary execution.&quot; One of the main targets of Mano Blanca was the &quot;Partido Revolucionario&quot; (PR), an anti-communist group that was the only major reform oriented party allowed to operate under the military-dominated regime. Other targets included the banned leftist parties. The PR drew a lot of its members from the activist base that had been created during the agrarian reform program begun by former president Jacobo Arbenz in 1952, and these individuals were targeted by the Mano Blanca. When it was founded, the group had the specific aim of preventing Méndez Montenegro from taking power. During the 1970s, Mano Blanca was led by Raúl Lorenzana.

Human rights activist Blase Bonpane described the activities of Mano Blanca as being an integral part of the policy of the Guatemalan government, and by extension the policy of the United States government and the Central Intelligence Agency. One of the deaths Mano Blanca was responsible for was that César Montenegro Paniagua, a communist politician who was killed in retribution for the killing of West German ambassador Karl von Spreti by FAR guerrillas. Mano Blanca also sent death threats to one of the leaders of a student organization. When he was questioned about the reason for the death threats, the leader of Mano Blanca stated that the student needed to be killed because he was a communist, and would &quot;give his life for the poor.&quot; Overall, Mano Blanca was responsible for thousands of murders and kidnappings, leading travel writer Paul Theroux to refer to them as &quot;Guatemala&#x27;s version of a volunteer Gestapo unit.&quot;

<text>Circus Circus Las Vegas is a hotel and casino located on the northern Las Vegas Strip in Winchester, Nevada. It is owned and operated by Phil Ruffin. Circus Circus includes the largest permanent circus in the world. It features circus and trapeze acts, as well as carnival games, at its Carnival Midway. The resort also includes the Adventuredome, an indoor amusement park.

Circus Circus was originally owned by Jay Sarno and Stanley Mallin. It opened without a hotel on October 18, 1968. It included a casino on its first floor, while a second floor contained carnival games for children. Circus Circus was among the first family-oriented casinos in Las Vegas. It struggled financially during its early years, in part because of its lack of a hotel. A 15-story tower, with 409 rooms, was added in 1972. Sarno and Mallin were subsequently investigated for tax code violations and alleged connections with organized crime.

In 1974, the casino was leased to Bill Bennett and William Pennington, taking over operations from Sarno and Mallin. The property thrived under its new management. Another 15-story tower was added in 1975, followed by an RV park in 1979. A year later, Circus Circus added a series of motel structures, increasing the total room count to 1,610. Bennett and Pennington eventually purchased Circus Circus in 1983 and added a 29-story tower in 1986. The amusement park was added in 1993, and a 35-story tower was completed three years later. The casino contains , while the hotel has 3,767 rooms. The Circus Circus property also includes the small Slots-A-Fun Casino, which Sarno opened in 1971.

The resort was owned through Circus Circus Enterprises, which was renamed Mandalay Resort Group in 1999. The resort was sold to MGM Mirage (later MGM Resorts International) in 2005. MGM intended to renovate and expand Circus Circus, but canceled such plans amid the Great Recession. Fifty years after its opening, Circus Circus remained popular among families. In 2019, MGM sold Circus Circus to Las Vegas casino owner Phil Ruffin. At the time, the resort included the only RV park on the Las Vegas Strip.

==History==
Circus Circus was originally owned by Jay Sarno and Stanley Mallin. Explaining the casino&#x27;s double name, Sarno said, &quot;At first I planned a Roman circus motif, but changed my mind and decided to build a circus like we are all familiar with – instead of a &quot;Roman&quot; circus, it&#x27;s a &quot;circus&quot; circus.&quot; A circus-themed casino was a departure from Sarno&#x27;s previous Las Vegas resort, the luxurious Caesars Palace. Sarno called Circus Circus &quot;the most exciting project of my life&quot;.

Planning for Circus Circus was underway at the end of 1967, and the opening was initially planned for August 1, 1968. The Nevada Gaming Control Board gave preliminary approval for Circus Circus, but this was overturned by the Nevada Gaming Commission, which noted that Sarno&#x27;s group had only 70 percent of the necessary funds to finance the project. Approval was granted after a $1.1 million loan was provided by relatives of Kirk Kerkorian.

Circus Circus was designed by the California firm of Rissman and Rissman Associates. The general contractor was R. C. Johnson and Associates, of Las Vegas. Circus Circus was built on the Las Vegas Strip, across from the Riviera resort, on property next to the Westward Ho motel. The opening was eventually delayed to October 1, 1968. The Circus Circus owners had $4.2 million to cover the construction costs, and R. C. Johnson estimated the project to cost $3.9 million. However, work was sped up during the final month to get the casino opened sooner, resulting in a higher construction cost. The casino included a circus tent structure, made of steel and concrete. The tent-shaped roof reached 90 feet in the air, and was made of a plexiglass material which was painted white and hot pink.

===Opening and financial problems===
The $15 million Circus Circus ultimately opened on the night of October 18, 1968. An invitational costume party preceded the public opening. The opening was attended by numerous government officials and film stars, as well as media from across the United States. Nevada governor Paul Laxalt declared a &quot;Circus Circus Premiere Week&quot; to mark the opening.

Circus Circus had 1,000 employees. Sarno served as the casino&#x27;s president, and held a 25-percent interest, while Jud McIntosh held 22 percent. The two-story building included an indoor balcony that overlooked the casino floor. Various high wire and trapeze acts took place over the casino, but Sarno said that such acts would not distract the gamblers below. The property also featured female shoeshiners in skimpy clothing. Sarno had wanted the trapeze artists and shoeshiners to be topless, an idea that was vetoed by the gaming commission. Other attractions in the casino, however, were allowed to feature topless women. The second floor included a midway with various carnival games for children. Circus Circus was among the first family-oriented casinos in Las Vegas, along with the Hacienda. 

The casino featured costumed table dealers and cocktail waitresses, as well as small, pink elephants that could be ridden. Several trained monkeys roamed the casino as well and interacted with guests, for instance by paying out jackpot winnings. In addition, an elephant named Tanya was trained to pull slot machine handles and toss dice with her trunk. According to some accounts, a short-lived publicity stunt involved baby elephants that were transported around the casino via an overhead tram, giving the illusion that they were flying. The property also included an all-you-can-eat dessert experience known as the Diet Buster.

Circus Circus attracted 26,000 people within its first eight hours of opening. However, it would struggle financially during its early years. It was mocked and criticized by skeptics, who doubted the idea of a circus-themed casino. Gamblers were put off by the many distractions, including the trapeze artists and other performers. Howard Hughes, who owned several Las Vegas casinos, believed that Circus Circus did not fit in with the upscale resorts on the Las Vegas Strip. Mallin later said Circus Circus was &quot;ahead of its time&quot; and acknowledged that it was not well received in its early years.

By the end of 1968, Circus Circus owed more than $1 million in construction debt, which led to rumors about its finances. Casino management stated that it was performing satisfactorily, and that the debt was the result of certain construction work being disputed, due to concerns about whether such work was ever authorized. Circus Circus alleged $271,000 in unauthorized construction work by R. C. Johnson. The Nevada Gaming Commission declined to issue a permanent gaming license to Circus Circus until its debt was paid off, giving the casino one month to do so. In addition, Circus Circus charged a $1 admission fee, and the gaming commission determined on short notice that the casino had to pay $30,000 in taxes on the fees. The casino filed a lawsuit against the state to oppose the tax. The admission fee was one reason that Circus Circus struggled, and it was eventually dropped.

The gaming commission granted several extensions, allowing the casino to continue operating on a temporary license. In April 1969, the gaming commission voted to let the Circus Circus gaming license expire at the end of the month, after the discovery of secret loans that were made to the casino but not reported to the state. Hours before the scheduled closure, the commission extended the license for another month. This came after Sarno resigned as president and put his ownership stake into a trust until it could be sold. Mallin was chosen to serve as the new president. A permanent gaming license was granted in May 1969, and planning was underway for more than $500,000 in improvements. In January 1970, the Nevada Gaming Commission approved Sarno to return as the operator of Circus Circus.

The casino was unable to attract high rollers, due to its lack of a hotel. In 1971, the Teamsters&#x27; Union pension fund provided a loan to Circus Circus to pay off debts and to add a hotel. A 15-story tower opened in July 1972. As part of the loan arrangement, the Chicago Outfit&#x27;s enforcer, Anthony Spilotro (under the name of Tony Stuart), was granted a gift shop concession in the hotel. In addition to a government investigation into the organized-crime connections, Sarno and Mallin were also being investigated for tax code violations. The casino&#x27;s financial problems also continued, and Sarno began discussions to bring in a new casino operator.

===Ownership changes and later years===
In April 1974, William Bennett and William Pennington were approved by the state as new operators of the casino. They leased Circus Circus from Sarno and Mallin, who remained as landlords for several years. Bennett and Pennington had been searching for a financially challenged Las Vegas casino that they could take over. They originally considered the Landmark, before settling on Circus Circus. Bennett was initially skeptical that a family friendly casino could succeed in Las Vegas. However, he and Pennington quickly turned Circus Circus into a profitable venture. Under their management, the casino contained mostly slot machines, and did not cater to big gamblers. Although the casino was mocked for its theme, it had wide appeal among the middle-class demographic. Various additions were made over the years, including an RV park in 1979, followed by motel structures the next year.

Bennett said in 1981, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe kids and gambling mix. If I had to start over, I would not use this concept. We end up being babysitters for the town, which is fine, but we have a lot of problems because of all the kids around. We have more security wandering the floors than most hotels.&quot; Bennett and Pennington operated the property through Circo Resorts, Inc, which would later become Circus Circus Enterprises. In their lease, they had an option to buy Circus Circus from Sarno, which they eventually did in 1983. By that point, Circus Circus was one of the most successful casinos in the state.
A 29-story hotel tower was added in 1986, followed by the Adventuredome amusement park in 1993. A 35-story tower was added during renovations in 1996, part of an effort to bring in new customers. Circus Circus officials also hoped to retain the resort&#x27;s core demographic: young families and retirees searching for bargains.

Circus Circus Enterprises was renamed as Mandalay Resort Group in 1999. MGM Mirage (later MGM Resorts International) bought out Mandalay Resort Group in 2005, and acquired Circus Circus as a result. In 2007, the company planned to build a multibillion-dollar resort on newly acquired property north of Circus Circus, where the El Rancho Vegas once stood. The Circus Circus motel structures and RV park were to be demolished to accommodate the new project, and the remaining structures would be renovated and expanded. However, MGM&#x27;s plans were canceled due to the financial impact of the Great Recession. The El Rancho land was later used as the site of MGM&#x27;s Festival Grounds, which opened in 2015.

Out of 10 resorts on the Las Vegas Strip, Circus Circus was MGM&#x27;s most popular property among Hispanic tourists. Fifty years after its opening, Circus Circus remained popular among families, although the aging facility was in need of renovations, including new carpeting and exterior paint. Circus Circus was the oldest Las Vegas property owned by MGM Resorts. Although 50 years is a long lifespan for Las Vegas casinos, the anniversary went uncelebrated.

In 2019, MGM Resorts International sold Circus Circus to Phil Ruffin, owner of the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino, for $825 million. The sale included the Festival Grounds. Like previous owners, Ruffin continued to operate Circus Circus as a budget property. He began a $30 million renovation project focusing on various parts of the resort, with work extending into 2023.

Early on, Ruffin had planned to build a 2,000-seat theater in front of Circus Circus at a cost of $11 million. He also intended to convert the RV park into a swimming pool complex with a wave machine, sand beaches and a lazy river ride. As of 2024, these features have yet to be built.

In January 2025, Ruffin stated that he was planning to sell Circus Circus in order to acquire another property on the Las Vegas Strip or elsewhere. Circus Circus and the Festival Grounds make up a total of 102 acres and could sell for up to $5 billion. If sold, a new luxury integrated resort could be built on the site. Other uses for the site could include Formula One-related developments or a film studio. 

==Features==

Circus Circus has of casino space, and 3,767 hotel rooms. When it opened, the casino originally had 19 blackjack tables, two roulette wheels, eight crap tables, and 686 slot machines.

The front exterior of the casino originally had various features which were eventually removed. A 306-foot-long fountain area marked the front, and some of the fountains could shoot water four stories high, while illuminating the water in a series of colors. Las Vegas artist Montyne was hired to sculpt several statues, which also stood in front of Circus Circus. A carousel was also located in front of the casino.

In its early years, Circus Circus included the Hippodrome showroom. It hosted the show &quot;Nudes in the Night&quot;, which at one point starred Babette Bardot. In 1970, Sarno launched &quot;Tom Jones&quot;, a topless show based on the eponymous 1963 film. Other shows would include &quot;Naked But Nice&quot;, &quot;Nudes Delight&quot;, and &quot;Hot Pants Sexplosion&quot;. The theater was soon walled off to public access and, as of 2024, has sat vacant for decades.

In 1974, the Guinness Book of World Records named Circus Circus as the world&#x27;s largest permanent circus, a distinction that it continues to hold. Pink coloring is used throughout the resort. Jo Harris was the original interior designer. She had previously designed Caesars Palace, and would later work with Sarno on other projects. The 1972 hotel tower gave the casino 409 rooms. Another 15-story tower was opened in April 1975, adding an additional 400 rooms, and a convention hall. The two original towers are connected, and are known as the Casino Tower. In the 1970s, the hotel included a two-story Royal Suite, which was designed by Harris and included a balcony. A wedding chapel, known as Chapel of the Fountain, also opened in 1975.
The Circus Circus carousel was removed in 1976, to make room for the resort&#x27;s new roadside sign, which stands 123 feet. The neon sign depicts a clown character known as Lucky. It was created by YESCO and is one of the most-photographed signs in Las Vegas. A sportsbook opened In September 1976, but closed seven months later, as management believed that the space could be better utilized through a different purpose.

In 1977, there were plans for an expansion, which would include a parking garage. The 1,000-space garage was completed in 1978, and the Circusland RV Park was added a year later. Circus Circus Manor, which opened in 1980, consists of five, three-story motel buildings with a total of 810 rooms. This brought the resort&#x27;s overall total to 1,610 hotel rooms.

A monorail, the Circus Sky Shuttle, was added in 1981. It was the first automated transit system in the Las Vegas Valley. The track, located 18 feet above street level, connected the main resort to the Circus Circus Manor rooms. A $7 million renovation and expansion project was underway in 1982, expanding the casino and a video game arcade. A valet parking lot was added in front of the resort, replacing the fountains.
Additional casino space and a second parking garage were added in 1985, and construction was underway on the 29-story Circus Skyrise tower, which would add 1,188 rooms for a total of 2,793. It would also include more casino space and a sportsbook, as well as a third parking garage. The general contractor was Marnell Corrao Associates, with Veldon Simpson as the architect. Groundbreaking for the tower took place on January 31, 1985. It was topped off on September 25, 1985, and opened the following year, on property that was previously occupied by the Savoy Motel.

A $100 million renovation began in 1996. It included the December opening of the $60 million, 35-story West Tower. The addition added about 1,000 rooms, for a total of approximately 3,700. The older rooms underwent refurbishment, and a retail area with 14 shops was opened in January 1997. Operations of the monorail were ended around 2000, due to the high cost of maintaining its outdated equipment, although the track remains intact.
Most of Montyne&#x27;s statues were disposed of in 2006, under MGM&#x27;s ownership. The company stated that the statues were in a state of deterioration. In 2012, Circus Circus introduced an exhibit dedicated to the work of animator Chuck Jones.

The Circus Circus midway includes a video game arcade and carnival-type games. It also features clown shows and trapeze acts several times a day. Clowns also roam the rest of the resort to amuse visitors. For decades, the midway featured a carousel that operated as a bar.

The hotel rooms were renovated in 2014. The RV park was also briefly closed and renovated; a portion of it was converted into additional space for MGM&#x27;s Festival Grounds, leaving the RV park with 170 spaces. It takes up 10 acres, and is the only RV park on the Las Vegas Strip.

In 2017, Circus Circus added the Splash Zone water park for its hotel guests, after several years of planning. By 2022, the pool area had been enlarged as part of Ruffin&#x27;s $30 million renovation project, which also made minor improvements to the property. This included a $10 million update of the resort&#x27;s elevators, and a new paint job consisting of bright colors, emphasizing the property&#x27;s circus theme. The property&#x27;s faux circus tent structure was also included in the renovation project.

===Adventuredome===

The Adventuredome is a indoor amusement park located within a large pink glass dome, which is connected to Circus Circus. It offers various rides and attractions, including the Canyon Blaster and El Loco roller coasters, as well as midway and arcade games.

Circus Circus added the amusement park in 1993, on property behind the resort. It was originally known as Grand Slam Canyon until 1997.

===Restaurants===
Circus Circus includes a popular restaurant known as the Steak House, which has won several awards. It opened in 1982, replacing a spa area. The two main restaurants in the 1990s were the Steak House and a buffet, although an Italian restaurant, Stivali, was added in 1997. The buffet averaged approximately 13,000 diners per day. Readers of the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot; voted the buffet as Las Vegas&#x27; worst for seven straight years, starting in 2001. In 2021, a portion of the buffet was replaced with a food court, which includes Dairy Queen, Einstein Bros. Bagels, Pick Up Stix, and Popeyes.

===Slots-A-Fun Casino===

Slots-A-Fun Casino is a small casino located on the Circus Circus property. It operates in a separate building along the Las Vegas Strip, directly south of the Circus Circus east entrance. It was opened in August 1971, by Circus Circus owner Jay Sarno replacing a merry-go-round. In 1974, management of the casino was assumed by Ross W. Miller, a former Circus Circus executive (and father of eventual Nevada governor Bob Miller). Miller was reported to be leasing the premises from the Teamsters Union, which had provided some of the financing to develop Circus Circus.
In 1975, gaming executive Carl Thomas bought into the casino as an equal partner with Miller, who died later that year. In 1979, however, Thomas was exposed as being involved in casino skimming operations on behalf of the Kansas City mob. Two FBI informants claimed that the mob owned a secret interest in Slots-A-Fun through Allen Dorfman, though that claim was never substantiated. Thomas&#x27;s gaming licenses were revoked, and he was forced to sell his casino interests.

Miller&#x27;s estate and Thomas sold Slots-A-Fun to Circus Circus Hotels, Inc., a company owned by Bill Bennett and Bill Pennington, who were the operators of the Circus Circus casino. Their company later became known as Circus Circus Enterprises, and then Mandalay Resort Group. In 1986, a woman accidentally crashed her car into the casino, injuring 14 people.

MGM Mirage (later MGM Resorts International) bought Mandalay Resort Group in 2005, and acquired Slots-A-Fun as part of the purchase. As of 2014, it was one of the last casinos to still offer coin-operated slot machines. Phil Ruffin bought Circus Circus and Slots-A-Fun in 2019. The casino is popular for its low-priced drinks and table games.

==In popular culture==
In 1969, Circus Circus served as the location for an episode of &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. It also appears in the 1970 film &quot;The Grasshopper&quot;.

In the 1971 journalistic novel &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;, author Hunter S. Thompson wrote, &quot;The Circus-Circus is what the whole hep world would be doing Saturday night if the Nazis had won the war. This is the sixth Reich. The ground floor is full of gambling tables, like all the other casinos . . . but the place is about four stories high, in the style of a circus tent, and all manner of strange County-Fair/Polish Carnival madness is going on up in this space.&quot; When the novel was adapted to film in 1998, the fictional &quot;Bazooko Circus&quot; was featured as a thinly veiled stand-in for Circus Circus, which had refused permission for the filmmakers to shoot on their property.

Circus Circus is a featured location in the 1971 James Bond film, &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;, which includes key scenes filmed in the casino and midway. Sarno himself has a cameo in the film, and Tanya the elephant is shown doing her slot machine-playing trick. A year later, Circus Circus appeared in an episode of &quot;Banacek&quot; titled &quot;A Million the Hard Way&quot;. It also made appearances in several other films of the 1970s, including &quot;Las Vegas Lady&quot;, &quot;Damnation Alley&quot;, and &quot;Corvette Summer&quot;. The 1999 film &quot;Baby Geniuses&quot; was partially shot at the Adventuredome, which stood in as the fictional Joyworld theme park.

In the 2004 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;, Circus Circus appears under the name Clown&#x27;s Pocket. A recreation of Circus Circus, called the Ringmaster, also appears in the 2014 racing video game &quot;The Crew&quot;, near the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip.

A robbery occurred at Circus Circus in 1993, when Heather Tallchief, a driver for an armored truck, drove away with $3 million, which was in the process of being distributed to ATMs. Tallchief carried out the robbery with the help of murderer Roberto Solis. They disappeared, but she eventually surrendered 12 years later. The robbery is chronicled in an episode of the 2021 Netflix docuseries &quot;Heist&quot;.

<doc id="721274" wikidata="Q879116" url="?curid=721274" title="Enrique Peralta Azurdia">
<text>Alfredo Enrique Peralta Azurdia (June 17, 1908 – February 18, 1997) was a Guatemalan military officer and politician who served as the Head of Government from March 1963 to July 1966. He took over the office of the presidency after staging a coup d&#x27;état against President Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes, under whom he served as Agriculture (1959–1960) and Defense minister (1961–1963). 

Peralta would later form the Institutional Democratic Party, a pro-military governing party modeled on the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which dominated Guatemalan politics until 1982. In the 1978 general election, he was the candidate of the National Liberation Movement but was defeated by Fernando Romeo Lucas García.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Peralta was born on June 17, 1908, in Guatemala City. He studied at the and enlisted in the Guatemalan Army in 1926.

=== Career ===
Peralta served as a military attaché for the embassies of Mexico, Chile, Costa Rica, El Salvador and the United States, and was later promoted to a plenipotentiary to Cuba, El Salvador and Costa Rica.

In 1958, Peralta became the Director General of Agricultural Affairs under Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes&#x27;s government, a position he served until 1959. From 1959 to 1960, Peralta was the Minister of Agriculture, and from 1961 to 1963, was the Minister of Defence.

=== Coup d&#x27;état and rise to power ===

On March 31, 1963, Peralta came to power via a coup d&#x27;état, overthrowing Ydígoras. However, Ydígoras was not the main target of the coup. Fearing the country would be overtaken by &quot;communists&quot;, Peralta&#x27;s coup also targeted the former left-wing president Juan José Arévalo, who had announced his candidacy for the upcoming elections and was coming back to Guatemala from exile.

=== Head of Government ===
After coming to power, Peralta suspended the Constitution, dissolved the Congress, and banned the Communist Party (PGT). However, in 1964, a year after he became head of government, Peralta ended press censorship and lifted the state of emergency. The same year, Peralta called for constituent elections where only two groups could contest: the National Liberation Movement (MLN) and the Revolutionary Party (PR).

Peralta&#x27;s government continued its repressive activities against left-wing rebels in the Guatemalan Civil War. His government funded the creation of &quot;death squads&quot;, which was in charge of eliminating dissidents. Another notable event occurred on March 3 and 5, 1966, when the G-2 (military intelligence) and the Judicial Police raided three houses in Guatemala City, capturing twenty-eight trade unionists and members of the PGT. The twenty-eight &quot;disappeared&quot; while in the custody of the security force, marking it one of the largest forced disappearances in Latin American history.

In 1965, a new Constitution of Guatemala was approved, and general elections were held on March 6, 1966, contested by the Peralta&#x27;s Institutional Democratic Party (PID), and the PR. The PR candidate Julio César Méndez Montenegro won, and Peralta peacefully handed power to Méndez on July 1.

=== Later life and death ===
Peralta unsuccessfully contested the 1978 elections as a candidate for the MLN. He died on February 18, 1997, in Miami, Florida.

<doc id="721283" wikidata="Q1946206" url="?curid=721283" title="Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge">
<text>Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge is a wildlife preserve operated by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, encompassing part of the Montezuma Swamp at the north end of Cayuga Lake. The 10,004-acre (40.48 km2) preserve is composed of swamps, pools and channels and is a stopping point for migratory birds. It is the largest contiguous wetland complex in the northeastern United States and comprises a portion of the larger Montezuma Wetlands Complex, which is a partnership between the USFWS, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, as well as several other non-profit support organizations.

A significant stopover along the Atlantic Flyway, the refuge plays a crucial role in offering essential migration and nesting grounds for various bird species, including waterfowl, marsh birds, shorebirds, raptors, warblers, woodpeckers, and more.

Opened in 1938 as the Montezuma Migratory Bird Refuge, the area has seen many developments over the years in terms of its land size and wildlife management strategy. In May 1973 The Montezuma Marshes were designated a National Natural Landmark.

The refuge lies between the cities of Rochester and Syracuse, New York (five miles [8 km] east of Seneca Falls, and ten miles [16 km] west of Auburn), including parts of Seneca, Cayuga, and Wayne counties. Most of the refuge lies in the Town of Tyre, in the northeast corner of Seneca County.

==Wildlife and ecology==
Recognized as an Audubon Important Bird Area, the refuge plays a crucial role in offering essential migration and nesting grounds for various bird species, including waterfowl, marsh birds, shorebirds, raptors, warblers, woodpeckers, and more. It is considered to be among the most important wetland complexes in the north eastern United States providing critical stopover habitat for millions of migratory birds. It also provides unique habitats for regionally breeding birds and wildlife, including many endangered species. Here a vast number of species interact, in a rich and robust ecosystem. The variety of habitats at Montezuma, including wooded wetlands, emergent marsh, and different vegetation stages in upland areas, supports a diverse range of resident and migratory species.

=== Flora ===
Most of the wetlands are dominated by emergent vegetation and therefore classified as marshes, which are home to diverse array of plants. Multiple species of fern, such as rattlesnake ferns, ebony Spleenwort, and the intermediate wood fern can be found within the refuge. Coniferous trees include eastern white pine, northern white cedar, and eastern red cedar. There are countless flowering plants which include the purple prairie clover, marsh pea, white avens, black raspberry, steeple bush and many more.

Invasive species are an ongoing concern for conservationist at the refuge. Among these are the purple loosestrife and phragmities.

=== Fauna ===

The refuge serves as crucial habitat for over 300 bird species, with more than 100 known to actively nest within its boundaries. Marsh and water birds found at the refuge include the great blue heron, green-backed heron, great egret, black-crowned night-heron, Virginia rail, sora, bitterns, common moorhen and pied-billed grebes. The refuge also has an area where bald eagles have been nesting in recent years. Ducks and geese, including Canada geese, snow geese, black ducks and mallards are common at the refuge.
Mammalian species that roam this refuge include raccoon, coyote, muskrat, squirrel, red fox, chipmunk, beaver, gray fox and bats. Reptile and Amphibian species include spring peepers, snapping turtle, and tree frogs.

In 2011, a new species, &quot;Calamoncosis carncrossi&quot;, was discovered in the Carncross Salt Pond Preserve, an extensive inland salt pond owned by the complex. The new species was assigned to the subgenus &quot;Calamoncosis&quot; of genus &quot;Calamoncosis&quot;.

==History==
The Finger Lakes Region was formed by the melting glaciers of the last glacial period, over ten thousand years ago. The northern and southern ends of the lakes gradually developed into extensive marshes. First the Algonquin Indians and later the Cayugas of the Iroquois Nation were the earliest known inhabitants to reap the rewards of the bountiful life in the marsh. The name &quot;Montezuma&quot; was first used in 1806 when Dr. Peter Clark named his hilltop home &quot;Montezuma&quot; after the palace of the Aztec Emperor Montezuma in Mexico City. Eventually the Marsh, the Village, and the Refuge all acquired the name.

There were no dramatic changes in the marsh until the development of the Erie Canal in the 19th century, when it became apparent that feeder canals from Seneca Lake and Cayuga Lake would in time link these lakes with the main line. With canal construction, there arose the possibility of draining the marshes, and an act was passed relative to the draining of the Cayuga Marshes. Work first began on the canal system on July 4, 1817, and the completion was marked by the first passage from Lake Erie to New York City on October 26, 1825. Construction of the Seneca-Cayuga canal began in 1818 and by 1828 boats passed from Geneva to the Erie Canal at Montezuma. The Erie Canal did not greatly affect the marshes as the Seneca River still flowed directly from Cayuga Lake into the marshes.

In 1910, the widening and reconstruction of the Seneca and Cayuga extension of the New York State Barge Canal altered the marshes. A lock was built at the north end of Cayuga Lake and a dam was constructed at the outlet of the lake. This effectively lowered the level of the river by and the waters drained from the marshes. The meandering rivers were straightened and deepened, thereby creating additional drainage-ways.

In 1937 the Bureau of Biological Survey, which later became the US Fish and Wildlife Service, purchased of the former marsh. The Civilian Conservation Corps began work on a series of low dikes which would hold water and restore part of the marsh habitat that had once existed.

The refuge was opened in 1938 as the Montezuma Migratory Bird Refuge. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 7971 which established the Bird Refuge on September 12, 1938. The refuge provides a stopping point for waterfowl and other migratory birds. The refuge restored marsh land lost to drainage from the construction of the Cayuga and Seneca Canal that linked the Finger Lakes to the Erie Canal.

In May 1973, the refuge was designated as the Montezuma Marshes National Natural Landmark by the Secretary of the Department of the Interior.

On September 22, 2000, &quot;Harmony With Nature&quot;—an eight-person team of musicians from around the country—performed a four-hour, afternoon/evening concert at the refuge, featuring the music of the late John Denver. The speakers and musicians/performers were: Pete Lee Baker, Tom Jasikoff (Montezuma NWR&#x27;s manager), Tim Bak, Rob Bidinger, Val Cooper, Frank DeLaMarre, Paul Swanton and Brian Taylor (who also served as emcee of the event). Baker and Jasikoff conceived the idea for the performance, which developed into a series of &quot;Harmony With Nature&quot; concerts by the group, held on this and other federally protected land over 2000–2001 (four concerts in total, counting Montezuma NWR). This concert at Montezuma NWR marked the first time that a musical performance had ever been held on federally protected wildlife land. These musicians donated their talents and time by joining together to promote Denver’s legacy and to continue supporting his lifelong commitment to ensuring the preservation of the earth and all its natural habitats. The fundraising efforts also benefitted Montezuma NWR and the other wildlife sanctuaries, supporting and celebrating wildlife conservation efforts, ecological awareness, environmental education and habitat protection. Baker and Jasikoff also appeared in local, in-studio television interviews regarding the event.

On September 24, 2017, another &quot;Harmony With Nature&quot; event was held there, with Rebecca Colleen, Bill Destler, Jim Clare and Perry Cleaveland providing a two-hour, afternoon music show at the refuge.

== Conservation management ==
The presence of vegetation significantly impacts both nesting birds and migratory species that rely on the Refuge as a stopover point. More than 1,100 acres of land are currently designated as grass or brush, featuring a variety of planted grass species. Grassland and shrubland habitats are also subjected to routine mowing and clearing to impede natural succession towards forest growth. A meticulously planned and executed fire management strategy is implemented to stimulate the growth of grasslands and maintain these areas in an early successional stage. Typically scheduled for April, prescribed burns demand careful planning and specialized training.

Present forest management practices involve overseeing the growth of trees, investigating the interaction of indigenous species on the environment, and monitoring for potential threats from invasive species. To enhance diversity and potentially boost insect availability, a mix of forbs or wildflowers have been introduced.

=== Water level management ===
The construction of dams and canals in the early 1900s led to the drainage of the marshes, causing local wildlife to disappear. The Civilian Conservation Corps intervened, implementing a system of constructed dikes that restored water levels and brought wildlife back to the area.

Today, the water level is controlled through impoundments to recreate historic habitat conditions. These impoundments are strategically rotated to cater to different groups of species, such as migrating waterfowl, shorebirds, black terns, American and least bitterns, and pied-billed grebes. Each species requires specific water levels and habitat conditions, and the impoundments are managed in a rotation to provide a diverse range of habitats at any given time.

Heavy equipment is used to construct dikes that contain water, forming each refuge pool. Additionally, every pool is equipped with a water control structure to facilitate controlled drainage for optimal habitat conditions. The Main Pool has an inlet from a nearby lake, allowing it to be filled by gravity-fed water. In contrast, other pools depend on pumped water or rainfall for refilling. Pools may be intentionally drained during spring and summer to facilitate plant regrowth and refresh the marsh or to create feeding habitat for migrating shorebirds.

Management aims for a 70/30 distribution between cover and open water. To achieve this, certain pools undergo a regular drawdown schedule to replicate natural drought conditions. During these intentionally dry periods, when water levels are lowered, the soils have the opportunity to reoxygenate, promoting the growth of vegetation.

Two sections of the Refuge are under specific management for shorebirds. The smaller of the two, Benning Marsh along the Wildlife Drive, requires more labor-intensive efforts. During the summer, water levels are intentionally kept low to prevent loosestrife germination. Prior to raising the water levels in late summer, the area undergoes plowing to expose bare soil, rapidly transforming it into a mudflat. This results in the growth of vegetation like smartweed and the emergence of numerous macroinvertebrates, providing a food source for the shorebirds, waterfowl, and gulls that gather in this area.

In addition to providing wildlife habitat, the refuge also provides opportunities for people to observe wildlife. The refuge is open during daylight hours seven days a week.
The Wildlife Drive is a one-way auto tour that provides many opportunities to observe and photograph wildlife. The main feature of the drive is the wetland which hosts a rich diversity of waterfowl, waterbirds and other wildlife. The drive is open most of the year with the exception of winter, when the road may not be passable.

A visitor center and gift shop are open from April 1 to December 1 and have educational brochures, exhibits and specimens about the refuge and its wildlife.The Esker Brook Trail and the Oxbow Trail are available to hikers and walkers and remain accessible throughout the year, though some are off-limits during the white-tailed deer hunting season. There are several platforms and towers throughout the grounds to gain perspective of the landscape.
The New York State Thruway passes through the north end of the preserve providing passing motorists with a glimpse of the preserve as they speed along the Thruway. A 22-foot steel statue of a bald eagle, dedicated in 2016 to mark the 40th anniversary of the Bald Eagle Restoration program in New York State, is visible from the Thruway.

<doc id="721291" wikidata="Q879275" url="?curid=721291" title="Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes">
<text>José Miguel Ramón Ydígoras Fuentes (17 October 1895 – 27 October 1982) was a Guatemalan military officer and politician who served as the 32nd president of Guatemala from 1958 to March 1963. He was also the main challenger to Jacobo Árbenz during the 1950 presidential election. Ydígoras previously served as the governor of the province of San Marcos.

==Early life and military career==
Ydígoras Fuentes was born on a coffee plantation, in Pueblo Nuevo in the Guatemalan department of Retalhuleu, on 17 October 1895. He retained a great fondness for coffee as an adult, claiming to drink 10 cups of it in a day, and describing it as a &quot;patriotic vice&quot;, referring to Guatemala&#x27;s high coffee production. He enrolled in Guatemala&#x27;s military academy, and graduated at the top of his class. He was commissioned in the Guatemalan infantry in 1915. He was posted to the Guatemalan embassy in Washington, D.C., in 1918, and to the Paris embassy in 1919. In the same year he represented Guatemala at the Paris Peace Conference. He subsequently held various posts in the military academy, before becoming a governor of the province of San Marcos in 1922.

Ydígoras was appointed a general in 1937. He served as governor under the government of dictator Jorge Ubico until 1939, when Ubico appointed him director of roads. After Ubico was overthrown in the October revolution, Ydígoras was sent first to Washington, D.C., and then London, in diplomatic exile. During the government of Juan José Arévalo, Ydígoras was linked to several of the 25 attempted coups during 1945–1951. He returned to Guatemala in 1950. In the 1950 Guatemalan presidential election, Ydígoras was the main opponent of Árbenz. The elections were broadly free and fair, except that women who could not read were still disenfranchised. Although Ydígoras had the support of landowners, he lacked popular support, and did not have the backing of major political parties as Árbenz did. Árbenz eventually won the election with 258,987 votes to 72,796 for Ydígoras, out of a total of 404,739.

The United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) considered Ydígoras as a candidate to lead the 1954 Guatemalan coup d&#x27;état, because he had support among the Guatemalan opposition. However, he was rejected for his role in the Jorge Ubico regime, as well as his European visage, which was unlikely to appeal to the mostly mixed-race &quot;mestizo&quot; population. Carlos Castillo Armas was chosen instead. Ydígoras later claimed that in 1953, he had been introduced to two CIA agents by Walter Turnbull, an official of the United Fruit Company, and offered support to overthrow Árbenz. Ydígoras said he refused their terms, which included favoring the United Fruit Company, abolishing the railway worker&#x27;s union, and establishing a dictatorship similar to that of Ubico. Ydígoras later agreed to help Castillo Armas in his own coup attempt, a fact which came to the attention of the Árbenz government before it fell. After Castillo Armas took power following the 1954 Guatemalan coup d&#x27;etat, Ydígoras was made ambassador to Colombia.

==Election as president==
Carlos Castillo Armas was assassinated in 1957, and elections were held immediately afterwards by a military junta. These elections were so fraudulent that popular outcry forced a fresh ballot. Another election was held in 1958, in which Ydígoras was elected. His administration saw continual corruption scandals. There was significant social turmoil following his election, and demonstrations and protests against the government and against electoral fraud were common during his administration. These protests eventually grew into the guerrilla group MR-13.

In July 1958 a senior CIA Chief described Ydígoras as, &quot;known to be a moody, almost schizophrenic individual&quot; who &quot;regularly disregards the advice of his Cabinet and other close associates&quot;. The beginning of the leftist rebellion led to Ydígoras being accused of being &quot;soft on communism&quot; by other figures within the army. During his presidency, Ydígoras allowed the CIA to train the Cuban exile force that would be used in the failed 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion.

Several coups were attempted against him in the early 1960s, but they all failed, including one rebellion by the air force in 1962. In 1963, Ydígoras&#x27;s defense minister Colonel Enrique Peralta Azurdia eventually toppled Ydígoras. Peralta claimed that the entire government had been infiltrated by communists, abrogated the constitution, and took over as the head of state. Peralta&#x27;s coup had the backing of several opposition parties, who wished to end the possibility that former left-of-center civilian president Juan José Arévalo would return to Guatemala and run as a candidate in the upcoming elections.

==Later life==
Later in his life, Ydígoras was bitter about the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion. In exile in El Salvador in 1974, he stated that he had been made a scapegoat for the failure, and that the US was responsible for his overthrow. Ydígoras died of a cerebral hemorrhage in October 1982, in a military hospital in Guatemala City, at the age of 87. He was survived by his wife and two children.

<text>Guillermo Flores Avendaño (17 June 1894 – 26 May 1982) was a Guatemalan military officer who served as president of Guatemala from October 1957 to March 1958. In March 1957, he was designated as second in the presidential line of succession by Congress (preceded by Luis Arturo González López). He assumed the role of provisional president in October of that same year after the results of the 1957 general elections were annulled after a coup on allegations of electoral fraud.

Flores Avendaño&#x27;s tenure ended upon the inauguration of Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes who won the 1958 general elections. He was subsequently appointed as Minister of Defense under the Ydígoras Fuentes government.

<text>The Tiffin River is a tributary of the Maumee River in northwestern Ohio in the United States. Headwater tributaries of the river rise in southeastern Michigan. The river drains a primarily rural farming region in the watershed of Lake Erie. Early French traders called the river &quot;Crique Féve&quot;, translated as Bean Creek, due to the natural growth of bean plants along the shores.

The stream was renamed officially as the Tiffin River in 1822 after Edward Tiffin, the first governor of the state of Ohio. The upper section of the river north of the Ohio Turnpike is still referred to as Bean Creek.

==Course==
Bean Creek, the name of the upper half of the Tiffin River, flows from Devils Lake in the Irish Hills region of southeastern Michigan. It travels west through the village of Addison before meeting Posey Creek on the right bank. Turning south, the stream travels before merging with Hillsdale Creek just north of the city of Hudson. From there it flows southwest toward the unincorporated settlements of Medina and Canandaigua. At Canandaigua, Bean Creek comes within a mile of Black Creek, a tributary of the Raisin River. Flowing south past Canandaigua, the Bean Creek travels another before picking up Lime Creek a mile north of the city of Morenci. After picking up Silver Creek toward the south end of Morenci, Bean Creek enters Fulton County, Ohio. Following a generally straight course, Bean Creek is joined by Old Bean Creek at the Tiffin River Wildlife Area southwest of Morenci.

Beginning a highly meandering course, the stream, now known as the Tiffin River, continues southwest toward the village of Stryker. It turns to the south for its lower , joining the Maumee River from the north west of Defiance.

<text>Luis Arturo González López (21 December 1900 – 11 November 1965) was a Guatemalan attorney and politician who served as the acting President of Guatemala from 27 July 1957 to 24 October 1957. He became president after the assassination of Carlos Castillo Armas, under whom he was designated as first in the presidential line of succession by Congress.

==Biography==
Born in the town of Zacapa, González López studied law, and served as a judge in several cities. He was a member of the Supreme Court for seven years from 1945 to 1951, before being removed: reports stated that he was removed due to pressure from the communist parties. He was appointed Vice-President to Carlos Castillo Armas in 1957. On 26 July 1957, Castillo Armas was assassinated by a member of the presidential guard in the presidential palace in Guatemala City. González López held the position of &quot;First Presidential Designate&quot;, and was sworn in as interim president in Congress on 27 July by means of decree 1191, a document which conditioned him to call elections.

Supporters of Castillo Armas were considering forming a military junta and seizing power, but were dissuaded by Edwin J. Sparks. the U.S. ambassador to Guatemala. The U.S. government preferred to preserve a facade of democracy, rather than have Guatemala revert to a blatant dictatorship. Elections were held in October 1957, complicated by pressure from the U.S. government, the government of Dominica, and the army.

The centrist Miguel Ortiz Passarelli won a plurality in these elections, but supporters of Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes, who had also been a candidate in the election, rioted. The Guatemalan government declared martial law for a period of 30 days. On 24 October, a group of 80 military officers marched into the Presidential palace and replaced González López with a three-person junta led by army Colonel Óscar Mendoza Azurdia. New elections were held in January 1958. Ydígoras Fuentes comfortably won this election and seized power for himself soon after.

<text>In the United States, a plat ( or ) (plan) is a cadastral map, drawn to scale, showing the divisions of a piece of land. United States General Land Office surveyors drafted township plats of Public Lands Surveys to show the distance and bearing between section corners, sometimes including topographic or vegetation information. City, town or village plats show subdivisions broken into blocks with streets and alleys. Further refinement often splits blocks into individual lots, usually for the purpose of selling the described lots; this has become known as subdivision.

After the filing of a plat, legal descriptions can refer to block and lot-numbers rather than portions of sections. In order for plats to become legally valid, a local governing body, such as a public works department, urban planning commission, zoning board, or another organ of the state must normally review and approve them.

==History==

The creation of a plat map marks an important step in the process of incorporating a town or city according to United States law. Because the process of incorporation sometimes occurred at a courthouse, the incorporation papers for many American cities may be stored hundreds of miles away in another state. For example, to view the original United States General Land Office plat for the city of San Francisco, California, filed in 1849, one must visit the Museum of the Oregon Territory in Oregon City, Oregon, as at that time Oregon City was the site of the closest federal land office to San Francisco.

== Types ==
A plat of consolidation or plan of consolidation originates when a landowner takes over several adjacent parcels of land and consolidates them into a single parcel. In order to do this, the landowner will usually need to make a survey of the parcels and submit the survey to the governing body that would have to approve the consolidation.

A plat of subdivision or plan of subdivision appears when a landowner or municipality divides land into smaller parcels. If a landowner owns an acre of land, for instance, and wants to divide it into three pieces, a surveyor would have to take precise measurements of the land and submit the survey to the governing body, which would then have to approve it. A plat of subdivision also applies when a landowner/building owner divides a multi-family building into multiple units. This can apply for the intention of selling off the individual units as condominiums to individual owners.

A correction plat or amending plat records minor corrections to an existing plat, such as correcting a surveying mistake or a scrivener&#x27;s error. Such plats can sometimes serve to relocate lot-lines or other features, but laws usually tightly restrict such use.

A vacating plat functions to legally void a prior plat or portion of a plat. The rules normally allow such plats only when all the platted lots remain unsold and no construction of buildings or public improvements has taken place.

Other names associated with parcel maps are: land maps, tax maps, real estate maps, landowner maps, lot and block survey system and land survey maps. Parcel maps, unlike any other public real estate record, have no federal, state or municipal oversight with their development.

== Reasons ==
* Subdivision of a property into multiple smaller lots, as described above.
* Designation of roads or other rights of way.
* Ensuring that all property has access to a public right of way. Without such access, a property owner may be unable to use his or her property without having to trespass to reach it. The platting process restricts the fraudulent practice of knowingly selling lots with no access to public right of way without revealing that such access does not exist. (Property that does not have access to public right of way may be sold, provided that the buyer is aware of the lack of a public means of access by water or land.)
* Creation or vacation of easements.
* Dedication of land for other public uses, such as parks or areas needed for flood protection.
* Ensuring compliance with zoning. Zoning regulations frequently contain restrictions that govern lot sizes and lot geometry. The platting process allows the governing authorities to ensure that all lots comply with these regulations.
* Ensuring compliance with a land use plan established to control the development of a city.
* Ensuring that all property has access to public utilities.

==Reading==

Plats contain a number of informational elements:

* The property boundaries are indicated by bearing and distance. The bearing is in the format of degrees, minutes, seconds with compass point letters before and afterward to indicate the compass quadrant. For example, N 38 00 00 E is 38 degrees into the northeast quadrant or 38 degrees east of north. Similarly, S 22 00 00 W is 22 degrees west of south. North here is true north, so magnetic orientation must be corrected for magnetic declination.
* The certification note provides information on the surveyor and is the location where recent US plats place the flood survey code in accordance with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968.
* The north arrow is familiar to most map readers
* The title block and lot numbers provide information specific to a development or land use plan
* An easement is usually indicated by a dashed line, although it is also common to have to look them up in supplementary documents (such as a title report)
* Streets are usually indicated by a graphical outline of the right of way; the outline also sometimes depicts the paved area.

<text>Meleager (, &quot;Meléagros&quot;; died 323 BC) was a Macedonian officer who served under Alexander the Great. He was among the generals that accompanied the king in his quest to conquer Asia Minor, and was one of the most experienced among them. The only military figure who was more experienced than Meleager was the Macedonian general Antipater, who remained in Macedon during Alexander&#x27;s entire Asian campaign.

== Career ==
Meleager, son of Neoptolemus, is first mentioned in the war against the Getae in 335 BC. At the Battle of the Granicus in the following year, he commanded one of the divisions of the phalanx, a post which he continued to hold throughout Alexander&#x27;s campaigns in Asia. He was appointed, together with Coenus and Ptolemy, the son of Seleucus, to command the newly married troops who were sent home from Caria to spend the winter in Macedon, and rejoined Alexander at Gordium during the following summer.

Meleager was present at the Battles of Issus and Gaugamela against the Persian Army under King Darius III, and was associated with Craterus in the task of dislodging the enemy who guarded the passes into Persia. He took part in the passage of the Hydaspes and in various other operations in India.

Despite a long series of services, Alexander did not promote Meleager to any higher position, nor did Meleager take part in any separate command of importance. There are accounts that suggest that the two did not get along or at least had a history of disagreements. For instance, when Alexander gave gifts to the Indian prince Taxiles, Meleager was recorded to have quipped bitterly that it was a pity for the king to travel all the way to India only to give a man such lavish rewards, with Alexander retorting that envious men only hurt themselves.

== Politics and death ==
After the death of Alexander in 323 BC, Meleager was the first to propose in the council of officers, that either Arrhidaeus or Heracles, the son of Barsine, should at once be chosen as king, rather than waiting to see if the pregnant Roxana would bear a son. There are sources who suggest that this proposal was motivated by a desire to install a king who was a Macedonian instead of one who had Persian roots or Persian sympathies. The Roman historian Justin, for instance, stated that Meleager was quoted saying: &quot;It was unlawful that kings should be chosen for the Macedonians from the blood of those kingdoms they had overthrown.&quot; The Roman historian, Curtius, states that Meleager broke out into violent invectives against the ambition of Perdiccas and then abruptly quit the assembly in order to encourage the soldiery to express their opposition against Perdiccas. The Greek historian, Diodorus, states that Meleager was sent by the assembled generals to appease the clamours and discontent of the troops, but instead of doing so, he joined the mutineers.

Meleager assumed the leadership of the opposition to Perdiccas and his party and placed himself at the head of the infantry, who had declared themselves (possibly at his instigation) in favour of the claims of Arrhidaeus to the vacant throne. Meleager ordered the execution of Perdiccas, but the implementation of this instruction was nullified by the boldness of the regent. The greater part of the cavalry, together with almost all the generals, sided with Perdiccas, and leaving Babylon, established themselves in a separate camp outside the walls of the city. A reconciliation between both sides was achieved, principally thanks to the intervention of Eumenes, and it was agreed that the royal authority should be divided between Arrhidaeus and the expected son of Roxana and that, in the meantime, Meleager should be associated with Perdiccas in the regency. 

It was impossible that Meleager and Perdiccas could long continue on friendly terms, and Meleager proved no match for Perdiccas. Perdiccas contrived to lull his rival into a false sense of security, while he made himself master of Philip Arrhidaeus. Then he struck the first blow. The whole army was assembled under the pretence of a general review. Then the king, at the instigation of Perdiccas, suddenly demanded the surrender and punishment of all the leaders of the recent disorders. The infantry were taken by surprise, with 300 of the alleged mutineers being singled out and executed. Although Meleager was not personally attacked, he fled and took refuge in a temple, where he was pursued and put to death on the orders of Perdiccas.

<doc id="721358" wikidata="Q13406210" url="?curid=721358" title="Bargoens">
<text>Bargoens () is a form of Dutch slang. More specifically, it is a cant language that arose in the 17th century, and was used by criminals, tramps and travelling salesmen as a secret code, like Spain&#x27;s &quot;Germanía&quot; or French &quot;Argot&quot;. It is speculated to originate from Rotwelsch.

However, the word &quot;Bargoens&quot; usually refers to the thieves&#x27; cant spoken between 1850 and 1950. The actual slang varied greatly from place to place; often &quot;Bargoens&quot; denotes the variety from the Holland region in the Netherlands. While many words from Bargoens have faded into obscurity, others have become part of standard Dutch (but are more often used in the &quot;Hollandic&quot; than in other Dutch dialects). &quot;Hufter&quot; (jerk), &quot;gappen&quot; (to steal) and &quot;poen&quot; (money) are examples of words now common in Dutch. As is the case for most thieves&#x27; languages, many of the words from &quot;Bargoens&quot; are either insults or concern money, crime or sex.

Bargoens has many Yiddish loanwords. Examples are &quot;sjacheren&quot; (to barter), &quot;mesjogge&quot; (crazy), &quot;jatten&quot; (hands, to steal), &quot;gabber&quot; (buddy, friend), &quot;tof&quot; (great), &quot;hachelen&quot; (to eat).

The name of this cant is close to &quot;baragouin&quot;, which means &quot;jargon&quot; in French. It is supposed to have been derived either from the Breton words &quot;bara+gwin&quot; (bread+wine) or from &quot;Bourgondisch&quot; (&#x27;Burgundish&#x27;, i.e. [the language] from Burgundy).

Many &quot;Woonwagenbewoners&quot; (indigenous Dutch Travellers and Romani) used to speak this language as well.

==Examples==
Also the nicknames of former Dutch guilders were Bargoens:

<text>Sharon Marguerite Gless (born May 31, 1943) is an American actress known for her television roles. She portrayed Maggie Philbin on &quot;Switch&quot; (1975–78), Sgt. Christine Cagney in the police procedural drama series &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; (1982–88), and played the title role in &quot;The Trials of Rosie O&#x27;Neill&quot; (1990–92). She was Debbie Novotny in the Showtime cable television series &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; (2000–2005) and Madeline Westen on &quot;Burn Notice&quot; (2007–2013). 

A 10-time Emmy Award nominee and seven-time Golden Globe Award nominee, she won a Golden Globe in 1986 and Emmys in 1986 and 1987 for &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot;, and a second Golden Globe in 1991 for &quot;The Trials of Rosie O&#x27;Neill&quot;. She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1995.

==Early life and career==
A fifth-generation Californian, Gless was born in Los Angeles, the daughter of Marjorie (McCarthy) and sportswear manufacturing executive Dennis J. Gless. She grew up Catholic. She has two brothers, Michael McCarthy Gless and Arick Dennis Gless. Her parents divorced when she was in her teens. 

Her maternal grandfather was Neil McCarthy, a prominent Los Angeles attorney for Howard Hughes who had a large clientele of major film-studio executives and actors. Wanting to become an actress, she asked her grandfather&#x27;s opinion. He told her, &quot;Stay out of it, it&#x27;s a filthy business!&quot; A few years later, though, when she spoke to him again about acting, he encouraged her and gave her money for acting classes.

Gless worked as a secretary for advertising agencies Grey Advertising and Young &amp; Rubicam, and then for the independent movie production companies Sassafras Films and General Film Corporation.

While she worked as a production assistant, Gless studied drama with acting coach Estelle Harman. In 1972, she signed a 7-year contract with Universal Studios, and remained under contract until Universal ended all contracts in 1981. Near the end of her contract, she was identified in the media as the last of the contract players. Universal was the last company to use the salaried, old Hollywood apprentice system.

Actress Elizabeth Baur was Gless&#x27; cousin.

==Career==

===Film and television===
At the beginning of her career, Gless appeared in numerous television series and TV movies, such as &quot;Revenge of the Stepford Wives&quot;, &quot;Faraday &amp; Company&quot; with Dan Dailey and James Naughton in 1973 and 1974, &quot;Adam-12&quot; season six, episode 24, &quot;Emergency!&quot; as a sculptor in 1975, and &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;. She played small parts in &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot; (1969–1976), until being offered the role of Kathleen Faverty, which she played from 1974 to 1976. That was in addition to a variety of guest-starring roles on television, including the part of the classy young secretary, Maggie Philbin, alongside Eddie Albert and Robert Wagner on the CBS private detective/con artist series &quot;Switch&quot; (1975–1978). Although she was a newcomer on the show, she got along very well with both Albert and Wagner, both on and off-screen. When the show was canceled after the third season, she thanked both Albert and Wagner for giving her career a jump start and remained close friends with them.

While under contract with Universal, she co-starred in a number of properties, including the 1979 Steven Bochco television sitcom, &quot;Turnabout&quot; (based on the Thorne Smith 1931 novel about a husband and wife who temporarily switch bodies), which failed to be a ratings blockbuster, and briefly in the sitcom &quot;House Calls&quot; (in which she replaced Lynn Redgrave, who had left due to a contract dispute).

Beginning with the series&#x27; seventh episode / first full season, Gless replaced actress Meg Foster in the role of NYPD police detective Christine Cagney on &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey.&quot; (The role was originated in the pilot installment, by Loretta Swit. Swit, like Foster, was chosen as Cagney because although the character of Cagney had been created with Gless herself in mind, she was unavailable for the pilot or the first seven installments of the first season.) In 1991, she married the series&#x27; executive producer, Barney Rosenzweig, who speaks in his book &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey...and Me&quot; about wanting Sharon Gless from the beginning and Gless being unavailable due to her contract with Universal. Rosenzweig created the 1990–1992 CBS drama series &quot;The Trials of Rosie O&#x27;Neill&quot; for Gless, and uncredited she played a psychiatrist, who was only partially seen. She has received six Emmy nominations–including two wins and a Golden Globe win for her role as Cagney–earned two additional Emmy nominations and a second Golden Globe win for the series.
In 1993 and 1995, Gless and her television partner, Tyne Daly, recreated their title roles in four critically acclaimed as well as popular &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; television movies. Gless and Daly jokingly called these &quot;The Menopause Years&quot;. In 1998, Gless narrated the documentary &quot;Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life&quot;, which received an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary Feature.

Between 2000 and 2005, Gless appeared as Hal Sparks&#x27; mother, Debbie Novotny, in her biggest and most critically acclaimed role since &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; in the acclaimed Showtime cable television series &quot;Queer as Folk.&quot; In 2000, she appeared on an episode of &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; entitled &quot;The Perfect Game&quot;. On May 26, 2005, she was one of the mourners at Eddie Albert&#x27;s funeral, along with ex-&quot;Switch&quot; co-stars Robert Wagner and Charlie Callas.

In 2006, Gless starred in the BBC television series &quot;The State Within&quot;. The next year she co-starred in the USA Network cable television series &quot;Burn Notice&quot;, playing Michael Westen&#x27;s (Jeffrey Donovan) mother, Madeline Westen. In addition, Gless was a guest star on several episodes of the FX Network cable television series &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot; as an unstable agent, Colleen Rose, a role that netted her an Emmy Award nomination. In 2009, Gless starred in her first leading role as a lesbian character in the independent film &quot;Hannah Free&quot; (Ripe Fruit Films), described as a film about a lifelong love affair between an independent spirit and the woman she calls home. The film is based on a screenplay by the Jeff Award-winning playwright Claudia Allen and directed by Wendy Jo Carlton.

In 2017, Gless was announced as appearing in one episode of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Casualty&quot;, the world&#x27;s longest-running medical drama, as surgeon Zsa Zsa Harper-Jenkinson. She appears in the 13th episode of the serial&#x27;s 32nd series. Gless called Zsa Zsa a &quot;wonderful character&quot;. Gless was invited to appear in the show by one of the producers, and expressed interest in reprising the role. Gless&#x27; appearance marked the first time the show has flown an American to the UK to film a role. She reprised the role on the October 13, 2018 episode.

Gless served on the advisory board of the Los Angeles Student Film Institute.

===Theater===
Gless made her stage debut in Lillian Hellman&#x27;s &quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot; at Stage West in Springfield, Massachusetts. Gless had two appearances in London&#x27;s West End, first in 1993 with Bill Paterson, when she created the role of Annie Wilkes in the stage version of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;Misery&quot; at the Criterion Theatre, and then in 1996, where she appeared opposite Tom Conti in Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Chapter Two&quot;, at the Gielgud Theatre.

She starred at Chicago playhouse The Victory Gardens Theater in Claudia Allen&#x27;s &quot;Cahoots&quot;, as well as several stints, including an evening at Madison Square Garden with the National Company of Eve Ensler&#x27;s &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;.

Gless&#x27;s most recent stage appearance was as Jane Juska in &quot;A Round-Heeled Woman&quot;, Jane Prowse&#x27;s stage adaptation of Jane Juska&#x27;s book &quot;A Round-Heeled Woman: My Late-life Adventures in Sex and Romance&quot;. The first production ran in San Francisco in early 2010. She starred in a new production in Miami, December 2010 - February 2011, directed by Jane Prowse. A production took place in London, transferring in November 2011 from Riverside Studios to the Aldwych Theatre, where the run closed on January 14, 2012.

<text>Elfego Hernán Monzón Aguirre (5 May 1912 – 6 June 1981) was a Guatemalan army officer who was President of Guatemala and leader of a military junta from 29 June 1954 to 8 July 1954, during the 1954 Guatemalan coup d&#x27;état.

== Early career ==
Monzón was an officer in the Guatemalan military, eventually attaining the rank of Colonel. He also served in the cabinet of Guatemalan President Jacobo Árbenz (in office from 1951 to 1954). Historian Jim Handy described him in 1985 as &quot;minister for government,&quot; while a U.S. government memorandum described him as a &quot;minister without portfolio&quot; on 14 January 1954. Sources within the U.S. embassy in Guatemala were reported to have said that Monzón had, in private conversations, expressed concerns over communist influence in Guatemala, after he had been approached with the suggestion that he led a coup against the government. Monzón stated that the army itself was anti-communist, but that conditions needed to worsen before the army would do anything. However, he anticipated that in a few months, the army would be willing to force Árbenz to resign, and he expressed hopes that other countries would place severe economic pressure on Guatemala. Monzón had heard of a coup attempt being planned, and was worried that it would lead to severe bloodshed. Tim Weiner, in his history of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), stated that Monzón had been bribed by CIA officer Henry Hecksher.

== Assumption of presidency ==
On 27 June 1954 Árbenz resigned as a result of a U.S. sponsored coup. Carlos Enrique Díaz replaced him as president, at the head of a military junta, which also included Monzón, and Jose Angel Sánchez. On 29 June Díaz was forced to resign, and a new three-person junta, headed by Monzón, took power. Witnesses later stated that Díaz&#x27; removal took place at 4 AM in Díaz&#x27; home. U.S. diplomat John Peurifoy, who had also played a role in the coup, had summoned all three members of the military junta there, and Díaz had announced that he was resigning after a meeting with Peurifoy and Sánchez. Monzón then entered and announced that he was forming the new junta. Historian Piero Gleijeses stated that Peurifoy was rough with Díaz at the meeting, berating him for allowing Árbenz to criticize the U.S. in his resignation speech. Díaz later stated that Peurifoy had presented him with a list of names, and demanded that all of them be shot by the next day, because they were communists; Díaz had refused, turning Peurifoy further against him. Gleijeses maintains that Peurifoy compelled Díaz to allow Monzón to become president, as Monzón was more staunchly anti-communist. The other members of Monzón&#x27;s junta were José Luis Cruz Salazar and Mauricio Dubois. &quot;Life&quot; magazine described Monzón as having &quot;a more impressive anti-Communist record&quot; than Díaz.

== El Salvador negotiations ==
Monzón was a staunch anti-communist, and had spoken repeatedly of his loyalty to the U.S. Nonetheless, he was not initially willing to hand over power to Carlos Castillo Armas, the leader of the US-backed rebels in the coup against Árbenz. The US State Department persuaded Óscar Osorio, the dictator of El Salvador, to invite Monzón, Castillo Armas, and other significant individuals to participate in peace talks in San Salvador. Osorio agreed to do so, and after Díaz had been deposed, Monzón and Castillo Armas arrived in the Salvadoran capital on 30 June. Monzón encountered difficulties negotiating with Castillo Armas, who wished to incorporate some of his rebel forces into the Guatemalan military: Monzón, however, was reluctant to allow this. Castillo Armas also saw Monzón as having entered the fight against Árbenz late. The negotiations nearly broke down on the very first day, and so Peurifoy, who had remained in Guatemala City to give the impression that the US was not heavily involved with the negotiations, traveled to San Salvador. Allen Dulles, director of the CIA, later said that Peurifoy&#x27;s role was to &quot;crack some heads together.&quot; Peurifoy was able to force an agreement due to the fact that neither Monzón nor Castillo Armas could have become or remained president without the support of the US. The deal was announced at 4:45 am on 2 July, and under its terms, Castillo Armas and his subordinate Major Enrique Trinidad Oliva became members of the junta led by Monzón, although Monzón remaining president. On 8 July 1954 Castillo Armas replaced Monzón as president; Castillo Armas led a new five-person junta, of which Monzón remained a member. The settlement negotiated by Castilo Armas and Monzón also said that the five-man junta would rule for 15 days, during which a president would be chosen.

== Aftermath ==
Soon after Castillo Armas took the presidency, he faced a coup attempt from within the army. An article in &quot;Life&quot; magazine stated that Monzón&#x27;s refusal to join the rebels proved to be the turning point of the revolt, and the attempt was crushed, leaving 29 dead and 91 wounded. Colonel Cruz Salazar and Colonel Dubois, who were seen as Monzón&#x27;s supporters in the junta, had made a secret agreement with Castillo Armas without Monzon&#x27;s knowledge, and resigned on 7 July. As a result, Monzon was outnumbered in the junta, and also resigned, on 1 September. This permitted Castillo Armas to be unanimously elected president of the junta. For their cooperation, Salazar and Dubois were paid 100,000 US dollars each. On 13 July, the new government was recognized by the US government. An election was organized in early October 1954, but all political parties were prohibited from participating in it. The only candidate was Carlos Castillo Armas, who won 99% of the vote. Monzón remained a part of Castillo Armas&#x27; administration.

==Death==

On 6 June 1981, Elfego Hernan Monzon Aguirre died in Guatemala; he was 69 years old.

<text>The St. Marys River (Shawnee: Kokothikithiipi, in Miami-Illinois: Nameewa siipiiwi) is a tributary of the Maumee River (Miami-Illinois: &quot;Taawaawa siipiiwi&quot;) in northwestern Ohio and northeastern Indiana in the United States. Prior to development, it was part of the Great Black Swamp. Today, it drains a primarily rural farming region in the watershed of Lake Erie.

It is formed in southern Auglaize County in western Ohio by the confluence of the short East Branch and Center Branch. It flows briefly west to St. Marys, approaching to within two miles of Grand Lake before turning to the north. In northwestern Auglaize County it turns sharply to the west-northwest, flowing past Rockford and Willshire into Adams County, Indiana. In northeastern Indiana it flows northwest through Decatur, then enters Fort Wayne. It hooks around in its last half mile (0.8 km) to join the St. Joseph River (in Miami-Illinois: &quot;Kociihsasiipi&quot;) from the west to form the Maumee in downtown Fort Wayne.

The World War II-era US Navy vessel &quot;St. Mary&#x27;s River&quot; was named after this river.

<doc id="721437" wikidata="Q1179189" url="?curid=721437" title="Daytime Emmy Awards">
<text>The Daytime Emmy Awards, or Daytime Emmys, are part of the extensive range of Emmy Awards for artistic and technical merit for the American television industry. Bestowed by the New York-based National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS), the Daytime Emmys are presented in recognition of excellence in American daytime television programming. The first ceremony was held in 1974, expanding what was originally a prime time-themed Emmy Award. Ceremonies generally are held in May or June, but starting in 2025, the ceremony will be held in October.

==History==
The first Emmy Award ceremony took place on January 25, 1949. The first daytime-themed Emmy Awards were given out at the Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony in 1972, when &quot;The Doctors&quot; and &quot;General Hospital&quot; were nominated for Outstanding Achievement in a Daytime Drama. That year, &quot;The Doctors&quot; won the first Best Show Daytime Emmy. In addition, the award for Outstanding Achievement by an Individual in a Daytime Drama was given to Mary Fickett from &quot;All My Children&quot;. A previous category &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Daytime Programming&quot; was added once in 1968 with individuals like &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; star Macdonald Carey nominated. Due to voting rules of the time, judges could opt to either award one or no Emmy, and in the end they decided that no one nominated was deserving of the golden statuette. This snub outraged then-&quot;Another World&quot; writer Agnes Nixon, causing her to write in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;...after viewing the recent fiasco of the Emmy awards, it may well be considered a mark of distinction to have been ignored by this group.&quot;

Longtime &quot;General Hospital&quot; star John Beradino became a leading voice to have daytime talent honored with special recognition for their work. The first separate awards show made just for daytime programming was broadcast in 1974 from the Channel Gardens at Rockefeller Center in New York. The hosts that year were Barbara Walters and Peter Marshall. For years, the gala was held in New York, usually at nearby Radio City Music Hall, with occasional broadcasts from Madison Square Garden. In 2006, the Daytime Emmys was moved to the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles, the first time they had ever been held outside of New York. The Kodak Theatre also hosted the 2007 and 2008 ceremonies, before it was moved again in 2009 to the Orpheum Theatre across town. In 2010 and 2011, the Daytime Emmys were instead held in Las Vegas. From 2012 onward, the Daytime Emmys have been held at various venues in Los Angeles, never to return again to New York (most likely as a reflection of the current state of American daytime dramas, where all New York-produced network soap operas have since been cancelled, and the ones left on the air are being recorded in Los Angeles).

In 2007, child voice actress Danica Lee, the voice for Ming-Ming in Wonder Pets! became the first Asian nominee overall in Daytime Emmy history while Eric Bauza became the first adult Asian nominee in Daytime Emmy history.

Due to the relatively small talent pool in daytime television, it has become common for the same people to be nominated repeatedly. The most infamous of these is &quot;All My Children&quot; star Susan Lucci, whose name became synonymous with being nominated for an award and never winning, after having been nominated 18 times without receiving an award before finally winning a Daytime Emmy for Best Actress in 1999.

In 2003, in response to heavy criticism of bloc voting in favor of shows with the largest casts, an additional voting round was added to all the drama acting categories. Known as the &quot;pre-nominations&quot;, one or two actors from each show is selected to then move on and be considered for the primary nominations for the awards.

With the rise of cable television in the 1980s, cable programs first became eligible for the Daytime Emmys in 1989. In 2013, in response to &quot;All My Children&quot; being moved from broadcast to streaming television, NATAS began accepting nominations to web-only series. The Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences (ATAS) also began accepting original online-only streaming television programs in 2013.

In October 2019, as part of several initiatives regarding gender identity, the NATAS decided to replace both the younger actor and actress in a drama categories with a single gender-neutral one for 2020.

The 47th Daytime Emmy Awards were postponed to June 26, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the traditional in-person ceremony being replaced by a television special featuring remote appearances, and the announcement of winners in leading categories.

In December 2021, the ATAS and NATAS announced major realignments to the Emmy Awards, accounting for the growth of streaming services by aligning their categories and the ceremonies&#x27; scopes around factors such as the themes and frequency of such programming, rather than dayparts. This resulted in most dramas (besides soap operas) now falling exclusively under the scope of the Primetime Emmy Awards, and categories for children&#x27;s television being spun out into the newly established Children&#x27;s and Family Emmy Awards.

NATAS has periodically awarded the Chairman&#x27;s Crystal Pillar Award, for special achievement in daytime television, including a 2011 award for Oprah Winfrey and her eponymous syndicated talk show. In 2021, the Crystal Pillar was awarded to 16 daytime television professionals who &quot;envisioned and implemented procedures that made safe production of media possible during the COVID pandemic&quot; as part of the 48th Daytime Creative Arts Emmy Awards.

==Rules==
Among the Daytime Emmy rules, a show must originally air on American television during the eligibility period between January 1 and December 31. Historically, in order to be considered a &quot;national daytime&quot; show, the program was required to air between 2 a.m. and 6 p.m., and to at least 50 percent of the country. Shows in syndication, whose air times vary between media markets, could either be entered in the Daytime or Primetime Emmys (provided they still reach the 50 percent national reach), but not in both. Game shows that reached the 50 percent threshold could be entered into the Daytime Emmys if they normally aired before 8 p.m.; otherwise, they were only eligible for the Primetime Emmys.

Web television shows must be available for downloading or streaming to more than 50 percent of the country, and like shows in syndication they can only enter in one of the national Emmy competitions. A show that enters into the Daytime Emmys cannot also be entered into the Primetime Emmy Awards or any other national Emmy competition. Entries must be submitted by late December. Most award categories also require entries to include DVDs or tape masters of the show. For example, most series categories require the submitted DVD to include any one or two episodes that originally aired during the eligibility period.

Voting is done by peer judging panels. Any active Academy member who has national credits for at least two years and within the last five years is eligible to be a judge. Depending on the category, voting is done using either a ratings score criteria or a preferential scoring system.

As of the 49th edition, eligibility for the Daytime Emmy Awards is now based on factors such as thematics and broadcasting frequency, with certain categories having been moved to other Emmy presentations. In particular:

* Only daytime serial dramas—defined as an episodic, multi-camera drama that airs on a weekday basis, or a reboot or spin-off of such a series—are eligible for drama awards at the Daytime Emmy Awards. All other scripted comedies and dramas now fall under the ATAS and Primetime Emmy Awards, regardless of scheduling.
* Programming targeting viewers aged 15 and younger were spun out into the new Children&#x27;s and Family Emmy Awards, also organized by the NATAS.
* Talk shows are divided between the Daytime and Primetime Emmy Awards based on &quot;format and style characteristics reflective of current programming in the daytime or late night space&quot;.
* Categories for game shows and instructional/do it yourself (DIY) programming remained split between the Daytime and Primetime Emmy Awards for 2022, pending realignment in 2023.
* Categories for morning shows were moved to the News &amp; Documentary Emmy Awards.

==Telecast==
The show originally aired during the daytime hours (except for the 1983 and 1984 awards, which weren&#x27;t televised) but moved to primetime in 1991. For many years, the show was produced by one of its own Lifetime Achievement honorees, Dick Clark. Each show from 2006 to 2008 was produced by White Cherry Entertainment.

NBC often aired special primetime episodes of its soaps (such as &quot;Another World: Summer Desire&quot;) as a lead-in to the ceremony. In 2002, 2005, and 2007, CBS aired special primetime editions of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; as a lead-in (the first of which tying into its then-host Bob Barker being host of the ceremony, and the last being a primetime encore of his final episode as host, which aired earlier in the day).

In August 2009, The CW broadcast the Daytime Emmys for the first time, due to the other networks declining to carry it (at the time the network did have one daytime program, &quot;Judge Jeanine Pirro&quot;). The airing delivered the ceremony&#x27;s lowest ratings ever (0.6/2 in 18–49, 2.72m), but it did outperform The CW&#x27;s weak averages on the night that summer. The second time around, Associated Television International brought the 37th Daytime Emmy Awards to CBS, as well as the 38th, the following year. On May 3, 2012, it was announced and confirmed that HLN would air the 39th ceremony on June 23, 2012. In that ceremony, an additional non-Emmy award was awarded by the program&#x27;s social media partner, AOL, for Best Viral Video Series. With 912,000 viewers (not counting four repeat broadcasts which brought the total to 2 million), the broadcast was &quot;the most watched regularly scheduled, non-news telecast&quot; ever on HLN, but by far the least-watched Daytime Emmy ceremony ever.

For the first time in the event&#x27;s four-decade history, the 2014 Daytime Emmy ceremony was not broadcast on TV and instead aired only online, but the Daytime Awards telecast eventually returned to television the following year thanks to a two-year deal with basic cable channel Pop. However, for 2016, the academy announced that ceremony would not be televised for the second time, citing the &quot;current climate for awards shows&quot;.

In 2020, the remotely-produced &quot;virtual&quot; ceremony for the 47th Daytime Emmy Awards aired on CBS, marking its return to both broadcast TV and CBS for the first time since 2011. On April 1, 2021, the NATAS subsequently announced a two-year deal with CBS, covering the 48th and 49th Daytime Emmy Awards.

<text>Taken, also known as Steven Spielberg Presents Taken, is an American science fiction television miniseries that first aired on the Sci-Fi Channel from December 2 to 13, 2002. Filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, it was written by Leslie Bohem, and directed by Breck Eisner, Félix Enríquez Alcalá, John Fawcett, Tobe Hooper, Jeremy Paul Kagan, Michael Katleman, Sergio Mimica-Gezzan, Bryan Spicer, Jeff Woolnough, and Thomas J. Wright. The executive producers were Leslie Bohem and Steven Spielberg.

The show takes place from 1944 to 2002 and follows the lives of three families: the Crawfords, who seek to cover up the Roswell crash and the existence of aliens; the Keyses, who are subject to frequent experimentation by the aliens; and the Clarkes, who sheltered one of the surviving aliens from the crash. As a result of the decades-long storyline, not a single actor or character appears in every episode of the series, though the voice of Dakota Fanning (who narrates as well as stars as Allie Keys) is in every episode. 
Reception was positive.
The series won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Miniseries and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Outstanding Miniseries or TV Movie.

When the show was launched, the Sci-Fi Channel used the simultaneous establishment of the organization Coalition for Freedom of Information in its promotion campaign.
Both the Sci-Fi Channel and the Coalition for Freedom of Information are clients of Washington, D.C. public relations firm PodestaMattoon, and this apparent co-mingling of clients was criticized. 
The Coalition for Freedom of Information is a group which seeks the release of classified governmental UFO files as well as scientific, Congressional, and media credibility for the study of this subject.

Actors starring in the series include Joel Gretsch, Steve Burton, Eric Close, Heather Donahue, Matt Frewer, Catherine Dent, Ryan Hurst, Adam Kaufman, Karen Austin, Julie Benz, Tina Holmes, Willie Garson, John Hawkes, Jason Gray-Stanford, Andy Powers, Ryan Merriman, Michael Moriarty, Michael Jeter, James McDaniel, James Kirk, and sisters Dakota &amp; Elle Fanning.

==Characters==
==Synopsis==
&quot;Taken&quot; spans five decades and four generations, and centers on three families: the Keys, the Crawfords, and the Clarkes. 
Nightmares of abduction by extraterrestrials during World War II haunt Russell Keys; the Roswell UFO incident transforms Owen Crawford from ambitious Air Force captain to amoral shadow government conspirator; and an alien visitor impregnates an unhappily married Sally Clarke. 
As the decades go by, the heirs of each are affected by the machinations of the aliens, culminating with the birth of Allie Keys, the final product of the aliens&#x27; experimentation and the key to their future.

===The Artifact===
The &quot;Artifact&quot; is a mysterious device connected to the aliens. 
The Artifact was initially on one of the alien ships flying over Earth on July 2, 1947, but the ship collided with a spy balloon and crashed, and most of its crew died. 
The Artifact itself was thrown clear of the ship and left half-buried in the ground. 
It was found and retrieved by Sue, a local woman who was the estranged girlfriend of ambitious Air Force Captain Owen Crawford.

Sue, seeing the small scrap of metal had alien writing on it and hoping it would rekindle her relationship with Owen, takes it to him. 
Owen, who is being phased out of the investigation into the crashed alien spaceship (which itself was retrieved), brutally murders Sue. 
Owen then shows the Artifact to his superior, Colonel Thomas Campbell, and blackmails him into promoting him to Major and making him head of the Roswell UFO Investigation Project.

Over the next 50 years, the Artifact remains in the possession of the Crawford family, and acts as the guide to each member&#x27;s efforts to understand the aliens&#x27; mission on Earth.

The Artifact&#x27;s true nature isn&#x27;t revealed until 2002, when the head of the Project, Mary Crawford, discovers new writing is still being formed on the Artifact&#x27;s surface. 
This reveals to the government that the Artifact is the recording device of the aliens&#x27; great genetic experiment: to create a hybrid being possessing the aliens&#x27; powers and more-evolved consciousness as well as humankind&#x27;s emotional core, which will lead them to the next step in their evolution. 
It has been continuously recording the events of the aliens&#x27; experiments over the decades since its arrival on Earth.

When the hybrid Allie Keys departs with the aliens, the Artifact is teleported away with them.

===Implants===
As part of their experiment, the aliens abducted thousands of innocent humans (exactly 46,367), mostly at night or while on airplanes, in order to find suitable breeding pairs and humans compatible with their DNA, to begin the process of creating the ultimate hybrid of human and alien. 
The aliens placed implants in an area of the brain that made it impossible to remove without killing or inflicting critical brain damage on the person (at least by the standards of human science). 
The implants also had a hand in manipulating a person&#x27;s memories following their abduction, and served as tracking devices, to allow the aliens to abduct their human test subjects wherever they may be.

The implants remained undiscovered until 1962, when Russell Keys&#x27; head was x-rayed to determine the cause of his seizures. 
The doctors treating him initially believed it was a tumor, but his son Jesse, suspecting it might be related to the aliens, demanded he have the same x-ray, and a similar implant was discovered.

Hoping to find a way to neutralize the implants and be free of the aliens&#x27; interference, Russell and Jesse arranged a meeting with Colonel Owen Crawford. Russell, in private, offered up his implant in order to save his son from grave harm, despite knowing it would most likely lead to his death to have it removed. Owen accepted, and Russell was escorted to a secret surgery facility. 
Upon his arrival, Russell realized Owen had betrayed him, but he was overpowered by the guards and sedated. 
The project&#x27;s doctor successfully removed the implant from Russell&#x27;s brain. 
Seconds later, it was revealed that the implant exerts some form of negative psychic effect on human minds. 
The scientists and guards were driven insane. 
One guard fires his machine gun at nearby oxygen tanks, causing the entire trailer to explode, killing Russell, Dr. Kreutz, and all within.

Learning from their mistakes, the UFO Project took precautions while retrieving and analyzing more implants from other test subjects or from their corpses. 
Eventually, a sophisticated tracking system was created by Doctor Chet Wakeman, which was used with great effect in tracking down abductees. 
Essentially, the implants give off a tracking signal based on the frequency of the basic element hydrogen, which once discovered made it relatively easy for the government&#x27;s UFO project to track the abductees as well.

The aliens kept using the implants as part of the experiment, ultimately using them to bring the Clarke and Keys families together to produce Allie Keys.

After John taught Allie how to remove the implants, she used the ability on everyone that came to protect her at the farmhouse so they wouldn&#x27;t be taken anymore, and would no longer be afraid.

===Aliens===
The Roswell Gray aliens depicted in the series are about as large as a child, but possess incredible psychic powers. 
According to Dr. Wakeman, they do not even originate from our dimension or plane of reality, though while here they are subject to our physical laws (accidentally hitting a weather balloon during a storm was enough to make the Roswell saucer crash). 
Their &quot;technology&quot; is so far advanced that it is essentially an extension of their minds, capable of being reformed at will. 
The aliens can also create utterly realistic hallucinations in humans, and often use this to try to interact with abductees. 
Sometimes they get a bit confused however, and re-use mental projections for one family member on another.

The reason the aliens are abducting humans is part of their hybridization experiment. 
When the aliens initially crashed in Roswell, it was just a scouting mission. 
However one surviving alien, &quot;John&quot;, evaded capture by the army and (after assuming a projection of human form) was given shelter by Sally Clarke until he was retrieved by another ship. 
As Dr. Wakeman eventually pieces together, and the alien &quot;John&quot; confirms, Sally&#x27;s simple act of kindness awoke an echo of something long dormant in the aliens. 
They had evolved to be millions of years in development ahead of humans, but the evolutionary tree is a branching path, so in the process they had evolved away from some of their more &quot;primitive&quot; aspects, such as emotions. 
John&#x27;s encounter with Sally made the aliens realize they had evolved away from emotion and morality, and even with this knowledge they could not simply re-attain it. Therefore, the aliens decided to hybridize themselves with humans to try to recover these qualities that they had lost. 
While their abductions were considered frightening and invasive by humans, John explains that the entire problem was that the aliens simply had no concept of &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot;, and were incapable of making such a value judgment.

Unfortunately, long-term contact with the aliens and their extra-dimensional technology leads to various health problems in most humans. 
For reasons even the aliens aren&#x27;t quite sure of, the Keys family is genetically able to be unaffected by these problems. 
Sally Clarke did not possess these genetic traits, and thus her hybrid child fathered by John was unable to fully harness his alien powers. 
All of this culminated in Allie Keys, the daughter of Charlie Keys and Lisa Clarke, who was capable of fully using her alien abilities.

==Production==
The series had a reported budget of $40 million.

<text>Francisco Javier Arana Castro (; 3 December 1905 – 18 July 1949) was a Guatemalan military leader and one of the three members of the revolutionary junta that ruled Guatemala from 20 October 1944 to 15 March 1945 during the early part of the Guatemalan Revolution. A major in the Guatemalan army under the dictator Jorge Ubico, he allied with a progressive faction of the army to topple Ubico&#x27;s successor Federico Ponce Vaides. He led the three-man junta that oversaw the transition to a democratic government, although he was personally reluctant to allow the elected President Juan José Arévalo to take office in 1945. He served as the Chief of the Armed Forces in the new government until 1949. On 18 July 1949 he was killed in a shootout with supporters of the Arévalo government after he threatened to launch a coup.

==Early and personal life==
Francisco Javier Arana Castro was born on 3 December 1905 in Villa Canales, Guatemala. His parents, Ángel María Arana and Margarita Castro, were from a lower-middle-class family. He had both Spanish and Indigenous heritage, and the latter trait was visually more prominent. He did not have a formal education, but he was relatively well read, and was described by his contemporaries as canny and intelligent, and as a charismatic and convivial person. He was described as a poor public speaker, but as a very persuasive man in intimate conversations. In 1946, during the Guatemalan Revolution, a staff member at the United States embassy described his politics as nationalist, as well as being slightly pro-American.

==October revolution==

In June 1944, a series of popular protests forced the resignation of dictator Jorge Ubico. Ubico appointed Federico Ponce Vaides leader of a three-person junta which would lead the provisional government. A few days later, Ponce Vaides persuaded the Congress to appoint him interim president. Ponce pledged to hold free elections soon, while continuing Ubico&#x27;s policy of suppressing the protests. This resulted in growing support for an armed revolution among some sections of the populace. By this time, the Guatemalan Army was disillusioned with the junta, and progressives within it had begun to plot a coup.

Arana became a member of this plot only in its later stages; the plot was initially led by Jacobo Árbenz and Aldana Sandoval. However, as the commander of the Guardia de Honor, Arana was in a position of substantial authority within the army. Sandoval was able to persuade Arana to join the coup in its final stages. On 19 October, Arana and Árbenz launched a coup against the government of Ponce Vaides. They were joined the next day by other factions of the army and the civilian population. Initially, the battle went against the revolutionaries, but after an appeal for support their ranks were swelled by unionists and students, and they eventually subdued the police and army factions loyal to Ponce Vaides. On 20 October, the next day, Ponce Vaides surrendered unconditionally. Both Arana and Árbenz fought with distinction in the coup. Arana, Árbenz and Jorge Toriello became members of a new three-person ruling junta, with Arana, who as a Major was the ranking army officer, becoming its senior member.

Arana did not wish to turn over power to a civilian administration. He tried to persuade Árbenz and Toriello to postpone the election, and after Juan José Arévalo was elected President in December 1944, he asked them to declare the election results invalid. Árbenz and Toriello insisted that Arévalo be allowed to take power, which Arana reluctantly agreed to, on the condition that Arana&#x27;s position as the commander of the military be unchallenged. Arévalo had no choice but to agree to this, and so the new Constitution of Guatemala, created in 1945, created a new position of &quot;Commander of the Armed Forces,&quot; a position which was more powerful than that of the defense minister. He could only be removed by Congress, and even then only if he was found to have broken the law. When Arévalo was inaugurated as President, Arana stepped into this new position, and Árbenz was sworn in as defense minister.

==Chief of the Armed Forces==
After Arana assumed his new and powerful position, an American embassy official stated in a dispatch that Arana was the type of personality that might assume dictatorial power. On 16 December 1945, Arévalo was seriously injured in a car accident and incapacitated for a period. The leaders of the Revolutionary Action Party (PAR), the party that supported the government, were afraid that Arana would take the opportunity to launch a coup. A handful of its leaders approached Arana and made a deal with him, which later came to be known as the &quot;Pacto del Barranco&quot; (Pact of the Ravine). Arana agreed to refrain from seizing power with the military; in return, the PAR agreed to support Arana&#x27;s candidacy in the next presidential election, scheduled for November 1950. This undertaking was given in writing. However, it was kept a secret; the American embassy only learned of it in 1947. Arévalo himself recovered swiftly, but was forced to support the agreement.

Although Guatemala was not completely democratized by the Guatemalan Revolution (illiterate women, for example, were still denied the vote) it nonetheless brought about substantial labor reforms. The parties that supported Arévalo&#x27;s government were led by young middle class individuals, who supported this process. The reforms alarmed Guatemala&#x27;s landowning elite, who looked for a political candidate who would support their cause. Thus, a number of wealthy Guatemalans began to cultivate Arana&#x27;s support against the labor reforms of Arévalo. Arana began to publicly complain about the labor reforms, without actually taking any actions against Arévalo. In the 1948 congressional election, he supported a number of anti-Arévalo candidates; however, none of them were elected to Congress.

After the electoral failure, Arana continued to try, through threats and persuasion, to get elected representatives to support him. He talked to José Manuel Fortuny, a leftist leader in the PAR. Fortuny later said that Arana asked him &quot;Why don&#x27;t you and your friends like me? I&#x27;m not a man of the right,&quot; to which Fortuny responded &quot;We are not against you. We appreciate the role that you played in the revolt against Ponce. It&#x27;s just that you have no sympathy for labour.&quot; By 1949 the National Renovation Party and the PAR were both openly hostile to Arana. A small faction of the Popular Liberation Front (FPL) supported him, but was soundly defeated at the FPL party convention in 1949. As a result, the faction split off to support Arana. The leftist parties decided to back Árbenz instead, as they believed that only a military officer could defeat Arana. In 1947, Arana had demanded that certain labor leaders be expelled from the country; Árbenz vocally disagreed with Arana, and the latter&#x27;s intervention limited the number of deportees.

==Death==
In order to run for election, the constitution required that Arana resign his military position by May 1950, and that his successor be chosen by Congress from a list submitted by the Consejo Superior de la Defensa (CSD) (&quot;Superior Defense Council&quot;). Elections for the CSD were scheduled for July 1949. The months before this election saw intense wrangling, as Arana supporters tried to gain control over the election process. Specifically, they wanted the election to be supervised by regional commanders loyal to Arana, rather than centrally dispatched observers. Arana called an emergency meeting of the CSD just before the scheduled election, at which no agreement was reached; but a few days later, Arana&#x27;s supporters suddenly gave in to the demands of Árbenz&#x27;s supporters.

On 16 July 1949, Arana delivered an ultimatum to Arévalo, demanding the expulsion of all of Árbenz&#x27; supporters from the cabinet and the military; he threatened a coup if his demands were not met. Arévalo informed Árbenz and other progressive leaders of the ultimatum, who all agreed that Arana should be exiled. A secret meeting of the permanent committee of the congress met and voted to dismiss Arana. Cuban President Carlos Prío Socarrás agreed to give Arana asylum there. Two days later, Arévalo and Arana had another meeting, at which Arévalo later said that Arana was highly threatening and abusive. On the way back, Arana&#x27;s convoy was intercepted by a small force led by Árbenz. A shootout ensued, killing three men, including Arana. Arana&#x27;s supporters in the military rose up in revolt, but they were leaderless, and by the next day the rebels asked for negotiations. The coup attempt left approximately 150 dead and 200 wounded. Many of Arana&#x27;s supporters, including Carlos Castillo Armas, were exiled. The details of the incident were not made public.

In a speech on 21 July, Arévalo made a speech describing Arana&#x27;s death. He suggested that Arana had flirted with conspiring against the president with people hostile to Arévalo, but had eventually refused to overthrow the government, and been assassinated for his refusal. He did not name the assassins, but suggested that they were members of the conservative opposition. He declared five days of national mourning in Arana&#x27;s honor. Prior to making this speech, Arévalo shared the text with his ministers. Árbenz and a few others had disagreed with its thrust, and suggested that the entire truth be told; however, they were overruled by the majority of the ministers. Historian Piero Gleijeses stated that if Arana had attempted a coup without delivering an ultimatum, he would likely have succeeded. However, his overconfidence in his hold over the military, as well as his lingering desire to take power in a legitimate manner, led to his effort being sabotaged before it truly began. Gleijeses also stated that Árbenz probably had orders to capture, rather than to kill, Arana.

<text>Jorge Toriello Garrido (23 April 1908 – 16 June 1998) was one of the three leaders of the first government that ruled Guatemala from 20 October 1944 to 15 March 1945 as part of the October Revolution. Toriello Garrido, a civilian, led the government along with Captain Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán and Major Francisco Javier Arana after overthrowing the military regime of Juan Federico Ponce Vaides, who had temporarily taken over from ousted dictator Jorge Ubico. He was the Minister of Finance in 1945.

<text>Juan Federico Ponce Vaides (27 March 1889 – 29 January 1956) was the acting President of Guatemala from 4 July 1944 to 20 October 1944. He was overthrown by a popular uprising on 20 October 1944 that began the Guatemalan Revolution.

== Life ==
Ponce Vaides was born in a wealthy upper-class family in Cobán, Alta Verapaz. His father was Mariano Ponce Contreras, his mother Victoria Vaides Arrivillaga. During the government of Manuel Estrada Cabrera, Vaides took part in the &quot;National Campaign of 1906&quot; against Honduras and El Salvador. After that, he became commander and political leader in different departments of state. After the downfall of Cabrera in 1920, he lost his brother, who was executed during a popular uprising.

==Presidency==
Jorge Ubico, the dictator of Guatemala from 1931 to 1944, was forced to resign on 1 July 1944 by a popular pro-democracy movement. Ubico appointed three generals, Ponce Vaides, Eduardo Villagran Ariza, and Buenaventura Pineda, to a military junta to succeed him. On 3 July, Ponce Vaides forced the Guatemalan congress at gunpoint to appoint him interim president. Ponce pledged to hold free elections soon, while at the same time suppressing the protests. Freedom of the press was suspended, arbitrary detentions continued, and memorial services for slain revolutionaries were prohibited.

=== Instability ===
Protests had grown to the point where the government could not stamp them out, and rural areas also began protesting the dictatorship. The government began to use the police to intimidate the indigenous population to keep it in power through the forthcoming election, resulting in more support for an armed revolution. The army itself had also begun to be disillusioned by the junta, and progressives within it had begun to plot a coup.

On 1 October 1944, Alejandro Cordova, the editor of &quot;El Imparcial,&quot; the main opposition newspaper, was assassinated. This led to the military coup plotters reaching out to the leaders of the protests, in an attempt to turn the coup into a popular uprising.

=== Stabilization attempts ===
Ponce Vaides announced elections, but the pro-democracy forces denounced them, citing his attempts to rig them in his favor.

He attempted to stabilize his regime by playing on inter-racial tension within the Guatemalan population. The most vocal support for the revolution had come from people of mixed descent, or &quot;Ladinos&quot; and Ponce sought to exploit their fear of the Amerindians by paying thousands of Indigenous peasants to march in Guatemala city in his support, and promising them land of their own if they supported the Liberal party that Ubico had begun as a front for the dictatorship.

== Overthrow ==
By mid-October, several different plans to overthrow the junta had been set in motion by the various factions of the pro-democracy movement, including the teachers, the students, and the progressive factions of the army. On 19 October, the government learned of one of these conspiracies. The same day, a small group of army officers launched a coup from within the army, led by the coup-plotters Francisco Javier Arana and Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán. They were joined the next day, 20 October, by other factions of the army and the civilian population. Initially, the battle went against the revolutionaries, but after an appeal for support their ranks were swelled by unionists and students, they eventually subdued the police and the army factions loyal to Ponce Vaides, and Ponce Vaides surrendered unconditionally.

== Aftermath ==
Ponce Vaides and Ubico were allowed to leave the country safely. The military junta was replaced by another three-person junta consisting of Árbenz, Arana, and an upper-class youth named Jorge Toriello. The junta promised free and open elections to the presidency and the congress, as well as for a constituent assembly. The presidential elections were won by Juan José Arévalo, who began a series of social and economic reforms that constituted the Guatemalan Revolution.

<text>Pierre de Manchicourt (c. 1510 – 5 October 1564) was a Renaissance composer of the Franco-Flemish School.

De Manchicourt was born at Béthune. Little is known of his early life other than that he was a choirboy at Arras in 1525. Further biographical information is scant, however the title-pages of his publications reveal that between 1539 and 1556 he held a succession of posts in Arras, Tours and Tournai, before going to Spain to be master of the Flemish chapel (capilla flamenca) at the court of Philip II, where he stayed for the remainder of his life. 

Similar to many composers of the early to mid 16th century, he predominantly wrote masses, motets and chansons. His motets are particularly significant as they show the three separate stages of early sixteenth century motet development, highly unusual to find in the work of a single composer. In his earliest motets one can hear the influence of Ockeghem; in his middle period works, the paired imitation style of Josquin des Prez; and in his late works the stylistic refinement, well-crafted melodic lines and pervasive imitation recall Gombert.

Manchicourt is an excellent example of a Franco-Flemish composer who learned his craft and art in northern Europe, and then assisted in the diffusion of the style by traveling to another region and composing and performing there. The movement of these many skilled composers out of Flanders and northern France created what was one of the first truly international styles since the original diffusion of Gregorian chant during the reign of Charlemagne.

He died in Madrid and was succeeded as maestro de capilla by Jean de Bonmarché.

<text>José María Reina Andrade (1 November 1860 – 25 April 1947) was the acting President of Guatemala from 2 January 1931 to 14 February 1931.

Reina Andrade was appointed by the Congress of Guatemala on 31 December 1930, as president of the Republic. On 2 January 1931, he called for Congress to take over the chairmanship of the republic. He remained in power just long enough while making the call for elections to the members of the Liberal Party to achieve taxation power for Jorge Ubico. It is said he received specific instructions from Jorge Ubico and the Liberal Party to convene elections quickly.

Andrade left power as a result of the elections that handed the presidency to Ubico on 14 February 1931.

== Manuel Estrada Cabrera government ==


Reina Andrade served as Secretary of the Interior during the second presidential term of Manuel Estrada Cabrera—from 1905 to 1911—and he was in charge of the investigations of the murder attempts against the president that took place on April 29, 1907 -&quot;The bomb&quot;- and on April 20, 1908 -&quot;Cadets assassination attempt&quot;-.

=== &quot;The bomb&quot; ===

In early 1907, lawyer Enrique Ávila Echeverría and his brother, physician Jorge Ávila Echeverría, along with Dr. Julio Valdés Blanco and electrical engineer Baltasar Rodil, planned a bombing attack on the president of Guatemala, Manuel Estrada Cabrera, which took place on 29 April 1907, and is generally known in Guatemala as &quot;The Bomb&quot;. The Echeverría brothers and their mates were from the elite class and had studied abroad, but when they came back to Guatemala, they did not like what they saw: a country where there was extreme abuse of power. When they decided to try to kill the president, they chose to use explosives. They prepared everything meticulously: the explosives, the detonators, the day and the exact time; even the president&#x27;s driver -Patrocinio Monterroso- was on board.

On the day planned for the attack, 29 April, the president was traveling in his chariot along his 13-year-old son, Joaquin, and his chief of staff, general José María Orellana. Around 10 a.m., they were on the 7th. S. Avenue, in between the 16th and 17th W streets when the bomb went off. However, by a miscalculation, Estrada Cabrera and those that were with him were unharmed. Only his driver and one of the horses died.

On 2 May 1907, Emilio Ubico, brother of Arturo Ubico Urruela -president of Congress- and uncle of Jorge Ubico Castañeda -political chief of Verapaz-, was appointed as Chief of Police, in charge of the investigations, along the Secretary of the Interior, Reina Andrade. A few days later, Congress issued Decree 737, by which any explosive related import was prohibited, unless previously authorized by the Secretary of War.

Over the next twenty two days, the four conspirators fled through the small streets and little holes that they could find, trying to escape from Guatemala City, but they could not escape because the government surround the city and slowly started to close in while combing every inch of terrain. Even their families were prosecuted and incarcerated. They were others conspirators, brothers Juan and Adolfo Viteri and Francisco Valladares, were arrested when they were trying to flee disguised as women in Guastatoya. Others, like Felipe and Rafael Prado Romaña, tried to flee to El Salvador, but were captured when somebody told on them- the Romaña brothers were in prison until their death-. Only the Colombian Rafael Madriñán escaped on a bike and left the country. The mother of the Romaña brothers took the Mexican Ambassador, Federico Camboa, to the house where the Avila Echeverría brothers and his friends were hiding, who, knowing that they had only days to live, gave him all their valuables and beg him to pass them on to their relatives.

At last, after several days of uncertainty, Rufina Roca de Monzón gave them shelter in the second floor of her home, # 29 Judío Place in Guatemala City, but a spy learned about it. on May 20, 1907, at 3 a.m. the house was surrounded by a soldier platoon. The troop brought down the door and tried to reach the second floor, but at that moment crossed gunfire started; by 6 a.m. the conspirators were out of ammo and exhausted and decided to kill themselves before becoming prisoners of the regime. The &quot;Diario de Centro América&quot;, then a semi-official newspaper owned by Estrada Cabrera, went as far as to publish the conspirators autopsy details.

=== &quot;The cadets&quot; assassination attempt ===


By 1908, Santo Domingo Church members had modified the path of its centennial and traditional Good Friday procession, such that now was passed in front of the Estrada Cabrera house on 7th S. Avenue in Guatemala City. That year, several Military Academy cadets, after noticing that the procession uniforms completely covered the face of the penitents, decided to disguise themselves and blend in the procession and by the time it passed in front of the president&#x27;s house, they would storm in and take him prisoner. However, the extremely efficient spy system that Estrada Cabrera had in place allowed him to thwart the kidnapping attempt. As soon as he learned about this, Estrada Cabrera prohibited the procession from passing in front of his house, placed a fence in front of it and prohibited the use of masks for the Holy Week processions.

On 20 April 1908, during the official reception of the new United States Ambassador in the National Palace, Military Academy cadet Víctor Manuel Vega, in revenge of what happened to his classmates and teachers, shot Estrada Cabrera point blank, but only managed to hurt him in his pinky. A flag from the official escort helped avoid the bullet from reaching the president. Enraged, and in order to set a precedent, Estrada Cabrera ordered to shoot all of Vega&#x27;s Military Academy unit, except two, Rogelio Girón and Manuel Hurtarte, who were taken prisoners without any legal document. Vega had died on the spot where he tried to attack the president, killed instantly by his bodyguards. The president also ordered the Military Academy to be closed, its building demolished and that salt would be spread on the field. Several military officers were sent to prison, including some loyal to the president.

<text>Lázaro Chacón González (27 June 1873 – 9 April 1931) was the acting President of Guatemala from 26 September 1926 to 18 December 1926 and President of Guatemala from 19 December 1926 to 2 January 1931.

Born in Teculután, Zacapa he was the son of Juan José Chacón Paiz and Soledad González Paiz who died during his birth. He is grandson of José Deciderio Chacón and María del Rosario Paiz, and also grandson of Vicente González Chacón and Josefa Paiz Cordón.

Chacón&#x27;s aunt, Cleta Chacón became his adopted mother. He married Josefina Pazos.

== Interim President ==

On 25 May 1926, &quot;El Imparcial&quot; -a private newspaper- had published a news flash: &quot;Martial law enacted&quot; which referred to executive decree 916, in which President Orellana had suspended the individual guarantees contained in the Constitution; the main reason for such decision was that &quot;insidious and unpatriotic activities of certain elements&quot; tended &quot;to disrupt the peace and development of the country&quot;, which, at once, made it impossible to solve the national economic problem. Although &quot;El Imparcial&quot; was not circulating regularly in the previous days -due to a government boycott-, after May 26 it ceased publication indefinitely. Thereafter, only the official news outlets, such as &quot;Diario de Centro América&quot; and &quot;El Guatemalteco&quot;, could circulate, carrying irrelevant information. The story took a sudden turn on Sunday September 26, when, at 0:15 pm, Orellana died during a vacation trip to Antigua Guatemala; he was in a room at Hotel Manchén. &quot;A violent angina attack ended the life of our illustrious president,&quot; explained &quot;Diario de Centro America&quot; in a special edition that day. These strange circumstances led to the suspicion that he was poisoned. General Lázaro Chacón assumed as interim President and immediately lifted Martial Law and allowed private newspaper to be published again.

==Presidency==

Chacón was first appointed to the position of Chairman and interim president following the death of General José María Orellana. He then called for elections in which his main opponent was general Jorge Ubico. Chacón defeated Ubico thanks in part to the strong campaign that journalist Clemente Marroquín Rojas made against the latter in his column called &quot;Desnudando al ídolo&quot;. Chacón government took some liberties such as creating the National Mortgage Bank (Crédito Hipotecario Nacional) as well as constructing the Faculty of Medicine building for the Faculty of Natural Sciences. During his tenure the Legislative Palace and the national railroad were also completed. During his presidency, the Guatemalan currency was stabilized, but Guatemala suffered the effects of the Great Depression in 1929.

=== Stroke and resignation ===

Beginning in December, 1930 the following events occurred in a rapid succession:
* On 12 December, General Chacón suffers a stroke that forces him to resign.
* General Mauro de León, first designated successor to the Presidency apparently resigns.
* Lawyer and cabinet member Baudilio Palma, second designated successor, is appointed interim President.
* On 17 December 1930 a coup d&#x27;etat led by general Manuel María Orellana Contreras forces Palma to resign after a short battle inside the Presidential Palace. During the fight, that lasted no more than an hour, both Palma and Mauro de León died. The Liberal Progresista party places general Roderico Anzueto in the key position of Chief of Police.
* On 2 January 1931 José María Reina Andrade is appointed interim President, after the foreign nations representatives refuse to deal with Orellana Contreras and calls for presidential elections.
* On 7 February 1931, general Jorge Ubico Castañeda wins the elections and is sworn as President. The Liberal Party joined with the Progressives to nominate Ubico as Andrade&#x27;s successor, and although he was the only candidate on the ballot, he received 305,841 votes in February 1931. In his inaugural address, he pledged a &quot;march toward civilization&quot;. Once in office, he began a campaign of efficiency that included assuming dictatorial power.

== Death ==

Chacón died in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States on 9 April 1931 at age 57 as a consequence of his stroke.

== Additional information ==

His granddaughter Josefina Chacon de Machado was a magistrate and President of the Guatemalan Supreme Court.

His grandson Carlos Gilberto Chacon Torrebiarte was also magistrate and President of the Guatemalan Supreme Court.

<text>José María Orellana Pinto (11 July 1872 – 26 September 1926) was a Guatemalan political and military leader. He was chief of staff of President Manuel Estrada Cabrera and President of Guatemala between 1921 and 1926, after overthrowing Conservative Unionist President Carlos Herrera. During his rule the Quetzal was established as the currency of Guatemala. Orellana Pinto died under suspicious circumstances in 1926 at the age of fifty-four. He was buried in the Guatemalan capital with state honors.

== Early life ==

José María Orellana Pinto was born in El Jícaro; he was the son of Esteban Orellana and Leonora Pinto. Orellana had a military career becoming General of the Guatemalan Army. He was elected to the Guatemalan legislature on several occasions, as a member of the Liberal Party, and was also Chief of Staff of the President Estrada Cabrera; when serving as such, on 29 April 1907, he was riding alongside the president&#x27;s coach when the latter suffered a bomb attack -which had been planned by the brothers Avila Echeverría and some of their relatives and friends-. Miraculously, both the president and Orellana were unharmed by the assassination attempt and almost immediately initiated the prosecution of the perpetrators.

== Coup d&#x27;état against Carlos Herrera ==

On 5 December 1921, General Orellana - sponsored by the United Fruit Company - lead a coup d&#x27;état against president Carlos Herrera who had resisted approval of the concessions granted to the United Fruit Company and its subsidiaries by his predecessor, Manuel Estrada Cabrera. Orellana had the help of several army officers, among them general Jorge Ubico.

== Presidency ==

On 5 December 1921, Orellana was appointed as Interim President, and eventually became Constitutional President after winning the elections the following year. During his term in office, he ratified concessions that the government of Estrada Cabrera had made to the United Fruit Company (UFCO) and that Herrera had refused to ratify. He also encouraged the creation of a tripartite republic formed by Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, but this was unsuccessful. In 1923, in celebration of the birth centennial of liberal writer and ideologist Dr. Lorenzo Montúfar y Rivera, the government erected a monument to his memory in &quot;Avenida Reforma&quot;.

=== Economy ===

Gum raw material extraction in the northern department of Petén was sold to Percy W. Shufeldt, who carried out the operation without paying taxes; unlike his predecessor—Carlos Herrera—Orellana gave favorable contracts such as the Shufeldt one to foreign companies. Another examples was the Electric Company, which had been expropriated from German shareholders after World War I, and was sold to the American Bond and Share Company on 4 May 1922.

Orellana promoted the construction of hundreds of kilometers of railways and was pressured by the International Railways of Central America to enforce the Méndez-Williamson railroad contract, signed in 1908 by then president Manuel Estrada Cabrera. When Estrada Cabrera was ousted, IRCA had intended to enact this agreement but the acting president Carlos Herrera refused to implement the contract; after Herrera was overthrown, Orellana ratified the contract on 10 March 1922.

The Guatemalan Congress issued the following laws during his term in office:
* Ratified the Central American Union Covenant held in San Jose, Costa Rica. 
* Approved the contract for light, heat and electric power services, held in Guatemala City between government representatives and the Central America Power Company.
* Hydrocarbons law 
* Ratified executive Decree 798, by which Archbishop Luis Javier Muñoz y Capurón remained in exile. 
* Approved the contract between the government and Emilio Capoulliez, proxy for Washington Serruys, for the installation of an electric tram.
* Approved the contract between the Ministry of Development and the All America Cables Incorporated company to build a public telegram office in Guatemala City
* Approved the contract with AEG from Berlin, Germany, to continue and complete the Los Altos Railway and the Santa María power plant.
* Approved oil exploration contracts with US companies. 
* Work Act 
* Endorsed and encourage a national soap industry development.

==== The United Fruit Company ====
# Dockworkers strike: In mid-1924, Puerto Barrios workers -key to banana transport- demanded an 8-hour day and increased wages. When UFCO refused to accept, workers went on strike, with the support from all workers in the farms of the &quot;frutera&quot;. UFCO asked the Guatemalan government for help, and Orellana quickly sent troops to restore order in Puerto Barrios; the collision was brutal and resulted in numerous workers injured or dead. The strike lasted 27 days, but repression tactics finished it: 22 leaders were jailed and then expelled from the country. 
# Railroad strike : In late 1924, the employees of International Railways of Central America (IRCA) demanded the reduction of working hours, higher wages and respect to their labor union. &quot;Railway Society&quot;. Again, the &quot;frutera&quot; flatly refused to accept these demands and ordered Orellana&#x27;s government to violently repress the strike of five thousand workers.

== Cultural references ==

* Rafael Arevalo Martinez talks about Orellana in numerous occasions in his biography of Estrada Cabrera &quot;¡Ecce Pericles!&quot;. 
* Orellana is also mentioned, though not by name, in the Guatemalan novels &quot;El Señor Presidente&quot;, &quot;Viernes de Dolores&quot; and &quot;Viento Fuerte&quot; of Nobel Laureate Miguel Angel Asturias. In Viernes de Dolores, Asturias calls Orellana by his nickname: Rapadurero. 
* Given that during his rule the Quetzal was instituted as the Guatemalan currency, his image appears on the one quetzal bills, which are colloquially called &quot;chemas&quot;. 
* His cousin, general Manuel María Contreras Orellana later would lead a coup against interim president Baudilio Palma in December 1930.

== Death ==

On 25 May 1926, &quot;El Imparcial&quot; -a private newspaper- had published a news flash: &quot;Martial law enacted&quot; which referred to executive decree 916, in which President Orellana had suspended the individual guarantees contained in the Constitution; the main reason for such decision was that &quot;insidious and unpatriotic activities of certain elements&quot; tended &quot;to disrupt the peace and development of the country&quot;, which, at once, made it impossible to solve the national economic problem. Although &quot;El Imparcial&quot; was not circulating regularly in the previous days -due to a government boycott-, after 26 May it ceased publication indefinitely. Thereafter, only the official news outlets, such as &quot;Diario de Centro América&quot; and &quot;El Guatemalteco&quot;, could circulate, carrying irrelevant information. The story took a sudden turn on Sunday 26 September when, at 0:15 pm, Orellana died during a vacation trip to Antigua Guatemala; he was in a room at Hotel Manchén. &quot;A violent angina attack ended the life of our illustrious president,&quot; explained &quot;Diario de Centro America&quot; in a special edition that day. These strange circumstances led to the suspicion that he was poisoned. General Lázaro Chacón assumed as interim President and immediately lifted Martial Law and allowed private newspaper to be published again.

<text>The St. Joseph River (Miami-Illinois: Kociihsasiipi) is an tributary of the Maumee River in northwestern Ohio and northeastern Indiana in the United States, with headwater tributaries rising in southern Michigan. It drains a primarily rural farming region in the watershed of Lake Erie. 

The St. Joseph River of Lake Michigan is an entirely separate river that rises in western Michigan, dips into Indiana, and flows west into Lake Michigan.

==Origin==
At the end of the Wisconsin glaciation, the glacier&#x27;s Erie Lobe retreated toward the northeast, leaving large debris deposits called moraines. The St. Joseph formed as a meltwater channel between the north limbs of two of these moraines, the Wabash Moraine on the west and the Fort Wayne Moraine on the east. At that time it joined the St. Marys River to drain into the Wabash River. Later, the shrinkage of Glacial Lake Maumee, the ancestor of modern Lake Erie, brought about the opening of the modern Maumee River, which captured the flow of the St. Joseph and the St. Marys, causing the St. Marys to reverse its course to meet the flow of the St. Joseph almost head-on.

==The St. Joseph today==
The St. Joseph River forms in northern Williams County, Ohio, at the confluence of the East and West branches at . Both branches rise in southern Hillsdale County, Michigan. The headwaters of the East Branch are within of those of the St. Joseph River of Lake Michigan. Both branches initially flow southeast, then turn to the southwest to flow across the northwestern corner of Ohio past Montpelier. The St. Joseph enters De Kalb County in northeastern Indiana, flowing southwest past Saint Joe and into the city of Fort Wayne, where it meets the St. Marys River to form the Maumee River at . The US Army Corps of Engineers built a flood control project in Fort Wayne that includes a floodwall and upper roadway along the St. Joseph River. (See photo)

<text>Carlos Herrera y Luna (26 October 1856 – 3 July 1930) was a Guatemalan politician who served as acting President of Guatemala from 30 March 1920 to 15 September 1920, and President of Guatemala from 16 September 1920 until 10 December 1921.

== Biography ==

=== Business ===

Herrera Luna was a successful sugar business man, developing Pantaleón Sugar Mill in Santa Lucía Cotzumalguapa, and Concepción and El Baúl sugar mills in Escuintla in the early 1900s. Pantaleón Sugar Holdings is today one of the top 10 sugar companies in America, with mills in Central and South America.

=== Presidency ===

After Manuel Estrada Cabrera was overthrown on April 14, 1920, the Unionist Party leaders, who were mostly conservatives, dealt with the liberal leaders from the Estrada Cabrera&#x27;s regime such that they could appoint the new cabinet. However, the liberal leaders outsmarted the conservatives and appoint Herrera Luna in office, in spite that he had served as a liberal representative for the whole 22 years that Estrada Cabrera&#x27;s government lasted; furthermore, they also appointed several key members of the ousted government in the new administration. Under these circumstances, the deals that Estrada Cabrera had set with the United Fruit Company were sure to hold. However, as an experienced business man, Herrera Luna realized that all of those concessions granted too much power to UFCO without any real benefit for Guatemala in return and did not accept them.

==== Education ====

Herrera Luna granted several benefits to the National University after its valuable contributions to the revolution against Estrada Cabrera&#x27;s regime:

* Autonomy to elect authorities
* A house for the students to assemble and create their Student Body.

==== Coup d&#x27;état ====


Herrera was deposed in a &quot;coup&quot;, led by José María Orellana, in December 1921 after Herrera resisted to approve the concessions granted to the United Fruit Company and its subsidiaries by his predecessor, Manuel Estrada Cabrera. He subsequently went into exile in France.

<doc id="721566" wikidata="Q704073" url="?curid=721566" title="Ars subtilior">
<text> (Latin for &#x27;subtler art&#x27;) is a musical style characterized by rhythmic and notational complexity, centered on Paris, Avignon in southern France, and also in northern Spain at the end of the fourteenth century. The style also is found in the French Cypriot repertory. Often the term is used in contrast with ars nova, which applies to the musical style of the preceding period from about 1310 to about 1370; though some scholars prefer to consider a subcategory of the earlier style. Primary sources for are the Chantilly Codex, the Modena Codex (Mod A M 5.24), and the Turin Manuscript (Torino J.II.9).

==Overview and history==

Musically, the productions of the are highly refined, complex, and difficult to sing, and probably were produced, sung, and enjoyed by a small audience of specialists and connoisseurs. Musicologist Richard Hoppin suggests the superlative &quot;ars subtilissima&quot;, saying, &quot;not until the twentieth century did music again reach the most subtle refinements and rhythmic complexities of the manneristic style.&quot; They are almost exclusively secular songs, and have as their subject matter love, war, chivalry, and stories from classical antiquity. There are even some songs written in praise of public figures (for example Antipope Clement VII). Daniel Albright compares avant-garde and modernist music of the 20th century&#x27;s &quot;emphasis on generating music through technical experiment&quot; to the precedent set by the movement&#x27;s &quot;autonomous delight in extending the kingdom of sound.&quot; He cites Baude Cordier&#x27;s perpetual canon &quot;Tout par compas&quot; (All by compass am I composed), notated on a circular staff.

Albright contrasts this motivation with &quot;expressive urgency&quot; and &quot;obedience to rules of craft&quot; and, indeed, &quot;&quot; was coined by musicologist Ursula Günther in 1960 to avoid the negative connotations of the terms &quot;manneristic style&quot; and &quot;mannered notation&quot;. (Günther&#x27;s coinage was based on references in &quot;Tractatus de diversis figuris&quot;, attributed to Philippus de Caserta, to composers moving to a style &quot;post modum subtiliorem comparantes&quot; and developing an &quot;artem magis subtiliter&quot;.)

One of the centers of activity of the style was Avignon at the end of the Babylonian Captivity of the Papacy and during the Great Schism (1378–1417), the time during which the Western Church had a pope both in Rome and in Avignon. The town on the Rhône had developed into an active cultural center, and produced the most significant surviving body of secular song of the late fourteenth century.

The style spread into northern Spain and as far as Cyprus (which was a French cultural outpost at the time). French, Flemish, Spanish and Italian composers used the style.

==Notational characteristics==
Manuscripts of works in the occasionally were themselves in unusual and expressive shapes, as a form of eye music. As well as Baude Cordier&#x27;s circular canon and the heart-shaped score shown above, Jacob Senleches&#x27;s &quot;La Harpe de melodie&quot; is written in the shape of a harp.

==List of composers==
The main composers of the (those from whom at least three compositions in this style are known) are Anthonello de Caserta, Johannes Cuvelier, Egidius, Galiot, Matteo da Perugia, Philipoctus de Caserta, Jacob Senleches, and Trebor. Other composers associated with the style include:
* Johannes Ciconia, &quot;Sus un fontayne&quot;
* Baude Cordier, &quot;Tout par compas&quot; (Rondeau-canon) and &quot;Belle bonne sage&quot;
* Martinus Fabri
* Paolo da Firenze
* Guido de Lange, &quot;Dieux gart&quot; (Rondeau)
* Johannes Symonis Hasprois
* Matheus de Sancto Johanne
* Solage, &quot;Fumeux fume par fumée&quot; (Rondeau)
*Antonio Zacara da Teramo, &quot;Sumite karissime&quot;
*Anonymous composers at the Nicosia court of King Janus of Cyprus

<text>Manuel Lisandro Barillas Bercián (17 January 1845 – 7 April 1907) was a Guatemalan general and acting president of Guatemala from 6 April 1885 to 15 March 1886 and President from 16 March 1886 to 15 March 1892. He was born in Quetzaltenango, and assassinated (at the behest of his enemy Manuel Estrada Cabrera, President of Guatemala at the time) in Mexico City in 1907.

== Government ==

Barillas Bercián became interim president of Guatemala after the death of President Justo Rufino Barrios in the battle of Chalchuapa in El Salvador in April 1885, by means of a clever scam: he went to the General Cemetery when Barrios was being laid to rest and told the Congress president: &quot;please prepare room and board for the 5,000 troops that I have waiting for my orders in Mixco&quot;. The congress president was scared by this, and declared Barillas interim president on the spot. By the time he realized that it was all a lie, it was too late to change anything.

Instead of calling for elections, as he should have, Barillas Bercián was declared President on 16 March 1886 and remained in office until 1892.

=== Remodelling Colón Theater ===


In 1852, Juan Matheu and Manuel Francisco Pavón Aycinena presented Rafael Carrera with a plan to build a majestic National Theater, that would be called Carrera Theater in his honor. Once approved, Carrera commissioned Matheu himself and Miguel Ruiz de Santisteban to build the theater. Initially it was in charge of engineer Miguel Rivera Maestre, but he quit after a few months and was replaced by German expert José Beckers, who built the Greek façades and added a lobby. This was the first monumental building ever built in the Republican era of Guatemala, given that in the 1850s the country finally was enjoying some peace and prosperity.

Appleton&#x27;s Guide to México and Guatemala of 1884 describes the theater as follows: «In the middle of the square is the Theater, similar in size and elegance to any of the rest of Spanish America. Lines of orange trees and other nice trees of brilliant flowers and delicious fragrances surround the building while the statues and fountains placed at certain intervals enhance even more the beauty of the place.

After the Liberal reform of 1871, the theater was called National Theater. In 1892, it was refurbished, removing the conservative coat of arms from its façade and substituting for it a sculpture and inscriptions. The orange trees, fountains and sculptures were removed, and in their place modern gardens were planted and a bust of José Batres Montúfar was erected.

During the government of general Barillas Bercián, the theater was remodeled to celebrate the Discovery of America fourth centennial anniversary; the Italian community in Guatemala donated a statue of Christopher Columbus -- Cristóbal Colón, in Spanish -- which was placed next to the theater. Since then, the place has been called &quot;Colón Theater&quot;.

=== 1892 Presidential elections ===

General José María Reyna Barrios, nephew of former president Justo Rufino Barrios, made it back to Guatemala in time to run for office in the 1892 presidential elections, after Barillas had expelled him a few years earlier. It was the first election in Guatemala that allowed the candidates to make propaganda in the local newspapers. The candidates who ran for office were:

Barillas Bercian was unique among all liberal presidents of Guatemala between 1871 and 1944: he handed over power to his successor peacefully. When election time approached, he sent for the three Liberal candidates to ask them what their government plan would be. The following anecdote recounts better what happened then:

First arrived lawyer Francisco Lainfiesta, and General Barillas, with the friendliest of smiles, said: &quot;Mr. Lainfiesta: you are one of the candidates in the upcoming elections and perhaps the more likely to win. Therefore, I would like to know what your attitude and your political system of government will be, if you get to win. Especially, I would like to know your attitude about my person; because I have made my mistakes, I do not deny it. I was a simple worker at my carpentry when General Justo Rufino Barrios sent for me to be appointed second presidential designate. I would therefore, Mr. Lainfiesta, know what conduct you will observe towards me.&quot; Mr. Lainfiesta said: &quot;General Barillas: if luck would favor me with the election victory, my government will be based on strict adherence to the Constitution; the law would be the law and anyone who has acquired some responsibility, will have to answer for it before the relevant courts. A firm and righteous compliance with the constitutional provisions shall be the standard of my conduct as president&quot;. &quot;Very well&quot; said general Barillas, and both parted cordially.

Barillas then brought in Dr. Montúfar and interrogated him in the same or similar way as he had done Mr. Lainfiesta. Dr. Montúfar responded in similar terms as Lainfiesta, stressing his claims to obedience of the Constitution and strict enforcement.

Finally general Reyna Barrios came in; when in the midst of pleasant conversation, General Barillas repeated his question, and Reyna replied, with a sincere smile: &quot;We should not even talk about that, general; because you and I are the same. Rest assured that I will know how to respect and protect you.&quot; And then both shook hands with effusion. By the election period, the first two days of voting favored Lainfiesta. But by the third day, a huge column of Quetzaltenango and Totonicapán Indigenous people came down from the mountains to vote for general Reyna Barrios. The official agents did their job: Reyna was elected president and, not to offend the losing candidates, Barillas gave them checks to cover the costs of their presidential campaigns. Reyna Barrios, of course, received nothing, but he went on to become President on 15 March 1892.

== After the government ==

Barillas stayed in Guatemala busy with his land properties during the government of Reyna Barrios – he owned the &quot;La Aurora&quot; &quot;finca&quot; near Guatemala City – but when Reyna was murdered in 1898 after his attempt to extend his term, Barillas had to go into exile in Mexico, as the new president, Manuel Estrada Cabrera, was his personal enemy. In Mexico, Barillas was involved in several conspiracies to take over the Guatemalan government.

== Death ==

Barillas Bercián was assassinated in Mexico City on April 7, 1907 by two assassins sent to kill him by President Manuel Estrada Cabrera, who had lost patience with the constant conspiracies led by Barillas while in exile in Mexico. The two murderers were from Estrada Cabrera&#x27;s personal guard, and never thought that they could be prosecuted for this crime, as they were accustomed to perpetrate crimes under total impunity in Guatemala. Once captured, they were interrogated and confessed that two senior officials in the Guatemalan government had sent them to Mexico to kill Barillas.

<text>Alejandro Manuel Sinibaldi Castro (1825–1896) was acting President of Guatemala from April 2, 1885, to April 5, 1885.

== Biography ==

Of partial Italian descent, Sinibaldi Castro was a businessman who was &quot;First Designate to the Presidency&quot;, the equivalent of Vice-President, during the presidency of Justo Rufino Barrios.

When Barrios was killed on April 2, 1885, in El Salvador, Sinibaldi Castro became acting president. However, given that Sinibaldi Castro had no political connections and was not in the military, he was pressured to resign within days of taking over. 

His successor was General Manuel Lisandro Barillas, who served as acting president, and was eventually elected as Constitutional President.

<text>U&amp;Alibi is a British premium television channel that was launched on 1 November 1997 as UK Arena. It was renamed UK Drama in 2000, and then UKTV Drama in 2004, Alibi on 7 October 2008, and U&amp;Alibi on 7 November 2024.

==History==
The channel originally launched as part of the new four-channel UKTV network on 1 November 1997. The channel, originally named UK Arena, focused on arts programming and was named after the BBC&#x27;s flagship arts programme &quot;Arena&quot; (The BBC, through BBC Worldwide, owning half of UKTV and therefore half the channel). The channel aired as a part-time service, airing from 3:00pm every day.

However, following disappointing ratings, the channel&#x27;s focus was broadened to include all drama series, and as a result was renamed UK Drama on 31 March 2000. However, the channel remained a part-time service, starting at 7:00pm.

On 5 November 2001, UK Drama began timesharing with a new sister channel, UK Food, which aired in UK Drama&#x27;s daytime slot.

On 10 January 2003, UK Food extended its broadcast hours while UK Drama reduced its broadcast hours to 9:00pm–5:00am.

On 8 March 2004, the channel, alongside all other UKTV channels, was renamed UKTV Drama to increase awareness of the UKTV brand. On 1 July 2004, UKTV Food extended its broadcast hours, leading to UKTV Drama moving to UKTV Food +1&#x27;s slot (which had been vacated by UKTV People), although still broadcasting the same hours as before.
On 9 April 2005, UKTV announced that UKTV Drama would expand to a full 24-hour schedule on 30 May. In order to prepare for the transition, the channel moved out of UKTV Food +1&#x27;s downtime slot to a newly purchased space and started broadcasting from 1:00pm at the end of April, before the full transition to a 24-hour network.

On 2 May 2006, a one-hour timeshift service - UKTV Drama +1, launched on Sky in the vacated broadcast space formerly home to UKTV People +1. It broadcast from 3:00pm–2:00am every day. Corresponding to the name on the main channel shows all programming from the channel one hour later, with no special idents or continuity used.

On 23 October 2007, UKTV Drama +1 was added to Virgin Media.

Following the successful relaunch and rebranding of the channel UKTV G2 as Dave on 15 October 2007, the remaining UKTV channels underwent the same changes. UKTV Drama and UKTV Drama +1 were renamed as Alibi and Alibi +1, respectively, on 7 October 2008, and the channel&#x27;s programmes were changed to focus specifically on crime dramas. All non-crime dramas were transferred to the rebranded Gold channel or to the newly created flagship channel Watch.

On 29 July 2011, UKTV announced that it had secured a deal with BSkyB to launch three more high-definition channels on Sky. As part of Virgin Media&#x27;s deal to sell its share of UKTV, all five of UKTV&#x27;s HD channels would also be added to Virgin&#x27;s cable television service by 2012. Alibi HD launched on 3 July 2012 on Sky and Virgin Media, while Dave HD and Watch HD launched in October 2011. All three channels are HD simulcasts of the standard-definition channels.
==Programming==
The output of the channel is a combination of drama series and serials comprising first-run exclusive and second run shows from the United States and Canada, together with second run showings of shows from the BBC and ITV.

<text>Kieren Francis Fallon (born 22 February 1965 in Crusheen, County Clare, Ireland) is a retired Irish professional flat racing jockey and was British Champion Jockey six times.

==Career==

===Stable jockey to Henry Cecil===
In 1997, Fallon became the stable jockey for Henry Cecil, one of Britain&#x27;s leading trainers. In May 1997 he recorded his first Classic win when taking the 1000 Guineas on the Cecil-trained filly Sleepytime. Cecil called him &quot;a very hard worker&quot; and a &quot;Group One Jockey&quot; while Richard Edmondson, writing in The Independent, praised Fallon&#x27;s riding ability while pointing out his poor disciplinary record. Both sides of Fallon&#x27;s character were soon evident as he was given a ten-day ban for his riding in a race in Italy, which he successfully had postponed to ride in The Oaks, which he won on Reams of Verse for Cecil. Fallon ended the season with 202 wins and his first Champion Jockey title.

Fallon retained the Jockeys&#x27; Championship for the next two seasons, riding more than 200 winners on each occasion. In 1999 he won his first Derby when he rode the Cecil-trained Oath to victory at Epsom and followed up by winning the Oaks on Ramruma for the same stable. Less than two months later Fallon was dismissed as Cecil&#x27;s stable jockey for reasons which were never fully explained.

===Stable jockey to Michael Stoute===
Following his dismissal, Fallon rode as a freelance jockey, riding for many top owners and trainers, before becoming stable jockey to the powerful stable of Michael Stoute. During his time with Stoute, Fallon rode the winners of many important races including successive runnings of the 2000 Guineas with King&#x27;s Best and Golan. Between these two victories, Fallon lost his Champion Jockey title after a serious arm injury sustained in a fall in June 2000 at Royal Ascot forced him to miss several months race-riding. The accident came shortly after a riding ban prevented him from riding in the Derby.

Fallon&#x27;s post at the Stoute stable came to an end in November 2001, when Stoute announced that some of his main owners did not want to use Fallon as a jockey for their horses, making his position untenable. Despite having no formal connection with the stable, Fallon continued to ride major winners for Stoute including the Derby winners Kris Kin in 2003 and North Light in 2004.

===Allegations of &quot;Conspiracy to Defraud&quot;===
In the spring of 2004 the &quot;News of the World&quot; newspaper made allegations of race fixing against Fallon. He was due to appear before the Jockey Club later in the year to answer the allegations when on 1 September 2004, he was arrested as part of a police investigation into the alleged fixing of over 80 races in the previous two years. On 15 December 2004 the Jockey Club discontinued its investigation into the allegations.

On 3 July 2006, Fallon was charged along with seven other people for conspiring to defraud the Internet betting exchange Betfair. Fallon was banned from riding in the UK until his trial was over, but was still able to race in the Republic of Ireland.

On 8 October 2007, his trial on charges of race-fixing began at the Old Bailey court in London. On 7 December 2007, the judge decided the defendants had no case to answer and he directed the jury to find Fallon and all his co-defendants not guilty because of lack of evidence. His suspension from British racing was lifted with immediate effect.

===Stable jockey to Aidan O&#x27;Brien===
In February 2005 Fallon accepted the post of first jockey to Aidan O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s powerful Ballydoyle stable. His new career began impressively, with a win on Footstepsinthesand in the 2000 Guineas. By the end of the season he had recorded further important wins on horses such as Yeats, George Washington and Oratorio. Fallon&#x27;s 2006 ban from riding in England curtailed his opportunities, but more important wins followed for the Ballydoyle team, notably on the 2007 European Horse of the Year Dylan Thomas. Fallon&#x27;s position with O&#x27;Brien ended with his 18-month worldwide ban imposed by the French racing authorities in January 2008.

===Positive tests===
On 29 November 2006 French racing authority France Galop suspended Fallon for six months after testing positive for a metabolite of a prohibited substance after riding at Chantilly on 9 July 2006. The ban ran from 7 December 2006 to 6 June 2007. On 8 December 2007, it came out that Fallon had tested positive again for a banned substance on 19 August 2007 at Deauville Racecourse in France. On 25 January 2008 Fallon received an 18-month riding suspension for this offence. He resumed race riding at Lingfield Park on 4 September 2009.

===Return as freelance===

The 2010 Flat racing season saw Kieren Fallon employed largely by trainers Luca Cumani, Mark Johnston and Kevin Ryan. Although major wins were less frequent, Fallon had success, riding 140 winners in 2010 and 154 in 2011. In the latter season he finished third in the Jockeys&#x27; championship behind Paul Hanagan.

In 2014, Fallon rode to victory in the 2000 Guineas. Allowing Night of Thunder to drift across the track to the left having been on the right of the track, Fallon got up in the final strides to win the race and to take his first classic in 8 years.

==Personal life==
Fallon has three children with his ex-wife Julie: Natalie Ann Fallon (b. 1994), and twins Brittany Michelle and Cieren Richard Fallon (b. 1999). He also had a child with another woman while married to Julie. Until his death, Brittany Fallon was the girlfriend of Italian jockey Stefano Cherchi. Cieren Fallon is also a jockey and won his first race at Leicester in 2018. He won the British flat racing Champion Apprentice title in 2019 and won his first Group 1 race in July 2020 when he rode Oxted, trained by Roger Teal, to victory in the July Cup at Newmarket.

As of 2010, Fallon writes a column in the &quot;Racing Post Weekender&quot; during the flat season.

In July 2016 Fallon announced that he had been diagnosed with depression and had decided to retire from racing.

Fallon released his autobiography &quot;Form&quot; in 2017, which was published by Simon &amp; Schuster.

<text>Pedro de Aycinena y Piñol (19 October 1802 – 14 May 1897) was a Guatemalan conservative politician and member of the Aycinena clan that worked closely with the conservative regime of Rafael Carrera. He was interim president of Guatemala in 1865 after Carrera&#x27;s death.

== Biography ==

Aycinena y Piñol was the son of Vicente Aycinena, the second marquis of Aycinena, and was the younger brother of cleric Juan José de Aycinena y Piñol, who inherited the title. Pedro&#x27;s uncle was Mariano de Aycinena y Piñol, also prominent member of the powerful family. Pedro married his first cousin, Dolores de Aycinena y Micheo, the daughter of a prominent member of the government of Ferdinand VII. Pedro served as Guatemalan minister of foreign relations (1854-71) and therefore played a major role in its foreign policy.

=== Concordat of 1854 ===

In 1854 a concordat was established with the Holy See, which was signed in 1852 by Cardinal Antonelli, Secretary of State of the Vatican and Fernando Lorenzana plenipotentiary -Guatemala Ambassador before the Holy See. Through this treaty -which was designed by Aycinena clan leader, Dr. and clergyman Juan José de Aycinena y Piñol - Guatemala placed its people education under the control of Catholic Church regular orders, committed itself to respect Church property and monasteries, authorized mandatory tithing and allowed the bishops to censor whatever was published in the country; in return, Guatemala received blessings for members of the army, allowed those who had acquired the properties that the Liberals had expropriated the Church in 1829 to keep them, perceived taxes generated by the properties of the Church, and had the right, under Guatemalan law, to judge ecclesiastics who perpetrated certain crimes. The concordat was ratified by Pedro de Aycinena and Rafael Carrera in 1854 and kept a close relationship between Church and State in the country; it was in force until the fall of the conservative government of Marshal Vicente Cerna y Cerna.

=== Wyke-Aycinena treaty: Limits convention about Belize ===

The Belize region in the Yucatan Peninsula was never occupied by either Spain or Guatemala, even though Spain made some exploratory expeditions in the 16th century that served as its basis to claim the area; Guatemala simply inherited that argument to claim the territory, even though it never sent any expedition to the area after the Independence from Spain in 1821, due to the Central American civil war that ensued and lasted until 1860. On the other hand, the British had established a small settlement there since the middle of the 17th century, mainly as buccaneers quarters and then for fine wood production; the settlements were never recognized as British colonies even though they were somewhat under the jurisdiction of the Jamaican British government. In the 18th century, Belize became the main smuggling center for Central America, even though the British accepted Spanish sovereignty over the region by means of the 1783 and 1786 treaties, in exchange for a cease fire and the authorization for the Englishmen to continue logging in Belize.

After the Central America independence from Spain in 1821, Belize became the leading edge of the commercial entrance of Britain in the isthmus; British commercial brokers established themselves there and created prosperous commercial routes with the Caribbean harbors of Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua.

The liberals came to power in Guatemala in 1829 after defeating and expelling the Aycinena family and the regular clergy from the Catholic church, and began a formal complaint before the English crown about the Belize area; at the same time, the liberal caudillo Francisco Morazán, then president of the Central American Federation, had personal dealings with British interests, especially on the fine wood market. In Guatemala, liberal governor Mariano Gálvez made several land concessions to British citizens, among them the best farmland in the country, Hacienda de San Jerónimo in Verapaz; these dealings with Englishmen were used by the secular clergy in Guatemala – who had not been expelled as the monasteries, but had lost the revenue from mandatory tithing which had left it weakened – to accuse the liberal government of heresy and to start a peasant revolt against the heretic liberals and in favor of the &quot;true religion&quot;. When Rafael Carrera, peasant revolt leader and commander, came to power in 1840, he stopped the complaints over Belize, and established a Guatemalan consulate in the region to oversee the Guatemalan interests in that important commercial location. Belize commerce was booming in the region until 1855, when the Colombians built a transoceanic railway, which allowed commerce to flow more efficiently to the port at the Pacific; from then on, Belize&#x27;s commercial importance began a steep decline.

When the Caste War of Yucatán began in 1847 in the Yucatan Peninsula – a Maya uprising that resulted in thousands of murdered European settlers – the representatives of Belize and Guatemala were on high alert; Yucatan refugees fled into both Guatemala and Belize and even the Belize superintendent came to fear that Carrera – given his strong alliance with Guatemalan natives – could support the native uprisings in Central America. In the 1850s, the British showed their good will to settle the territorial differences with the Central American countries: they withdrew from the Mosquito Coast in Nicaragua and began talks that would end up in the restoration of the territory to Nicaragua in 1894: returned the Bay Islands to Honduras and even negotiated with the American filibuster William Walker in an effort to avoid the invasion of Honduras. They also signed a treaty with Guatemala about its border with Belize, which has been called by Guatemalans the worst mistake made by the conservative regime of Rafael Carrera.

Aycinena y Piñol, as Foreign Secretary, had made an extra effort to keep good relations with the British crown. In 1859, William Walker&#x27;s threat loomed again over Central America; in order to get the weapons needed to face the filibuster, Carrera&#x27;s regime had to come to terms about Belize with the British Empire. On 30 April 1859, the Wyke-Aycinena treaty was signed between the English and Guatemalan representatives. The controversial Wyke-Aycinena from 1859 had two parts:

* The first six articles clearly defined the Guatemala-Belize border: Guatemala acknowledged England sovereignty over the Belize territory.
* The seventh article was about the construction of a road between Belize City and Guatemala City, which would be of mutual benefit, as Belize needed a way to communicate with the Pacific coast of Guatemala, having lost its commercial relevance after the construction of the transoceanic railroad in Panama in 1855; on the other hand, Guatemala needed a road to improve communication with its Atlantic coast. However, the road was never built; first because Guatemalan and Belizeans could not reach an agreement of the exact location for the road, and later because the conservatives lost power in Guatemala in 1871, and the liberal government declared the treaty void.

Among those who signed the treaty was José Milla y Vidaurre, who worked with Aycinena in the Foreign Ministry. Rafael Carrera ratified the treaty on 1 May 1859, while Charles Lennox Wyke, British consul in Guatemala, traveled to Great Britain and received the royal approval on 26 September 1859. There were some protests coming from the U.S. consul, Beverly Clarke, and some liberal representatives, but the issue was settled.

<doc id="721635" wikidata="Q914898" url="?curid=721635" title="Kingdom of Khotan">
<text>The Kingdom of Khotan was an ancient Buddhist Saka kingdom located on the branch of the Silk Road that ran along the southern edge of the Taklamakan Desert in the Tarim Basin (modern-day Xinjiang, China). The ancient capital was originally sited to the west of modern-day Hotan at Yotkan. From the Han dynasty until at least the Tang dynasty it was known in Chinese as Yutian. This largely Buddhist kingdom existed for over a thousand years until it was conquered by the Muslim Kara-Khanid Khanate in 1006, during the Islamization and Turkicization of Xinjiang.

Built on an oasis, Khotan&#x27;s mulberry groves allowed the production and export of silk and carpets, in addition to the city&#x27;s other major products such as its famous nephrite jade and pottery. Despite being a significant city on the Silk Road as well as a notable source of jade for ancient China, Khotan itself is relatively small – the circumference of the ancient city of Khotan at Yōtkan was about 2.5 to 3.2 km (1.5 to 2 miles). Much of the archaeological evidence of the ancient city of Khotan however had been obliterated due to centuries of treasure hunting by local people.

The inhabitants of Khotan spoke Khotanese, an Eastern Iranian language belonging to the Saka language, and Gandhari Prakrit, an Indo-Aryan language related to Sanskrit. There is debate as to how much Khotan&#x27;s original inhabitants were ethnically and anthropologically Indo-Aryan and speakers of the Gāndhārī language versus the Saka, an Indo-European people of Iranian branch from the Eurasian Steppe. From the 3rd century onwards they also had a visible linguistic influence on the Gāndhārī language spoken at the royal court of Khotan. The Khotanese Saka language was also recognized as an official court language by the 10th century and used by the Khotanese rulers for administrative documentation.

==Names==
The kingdom of Khotan was given various names and transcriptions. The ancient Chinese called Khotan &quot;Yutian&quot; (, its ancient pronunciation was &quot;gi̯wo-d&#x27;ien&quot; or &quot;ji̯u-d&#x27;ien&quot;) also written as and other similar-sounding names such as Yudun (), Huodan (), and Qudan (). Sometimes they also used &quot;Jusadanna&quot; (), derived from Indo-Iranian &quot;Gostan&quot; and &quot;Gostana&quot;, the names of the town and region around it respectively. Others include Huanna (). To the Tibetans in the seventh and eighth centuries, the kingdom was called Li (or Li-yul) and the capital city &quot;Hu-ten&quot;, &quot;Hu-den&quot;, &quot;Hu-then&quot; and &quot;Yvu-then&quot;.

The name as written by the locals changed over time; in about the third century AD, the local people wrote &quot;Khotana&quot; in Kharoṣṭhī script, and &quot;Hvatäna&quot; in the Brahmi script some time later. From this came &quot;Hvamna&quot; and &quot;Hvam&quot; in their latest texts, where &quot;Hvam kṣīra&quot; or &#x27;the land of Khotan&#x27; was the name given. Khotan became known to the west while the –&quot;t&quot;- was still unchanged, as is frequent in early New Persian. The local people also used &quot;Gaustana&quot; (&quot;Gosthana&quot;, &quot;Gostana&quot;, &quot;Godana&quot;, &quot;Godaniya&quot; or &quot;Kustana&quot;) under the influence of Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit, and &quot;Yūttina&quot; in the ninth century, when it was allied with the Chinese kingdom of Șacū (Shazhou or Dunhuang).

==Location and geography==

The geographical position of the oasis was the main factor in its success and wealth. To its north is one of the most arid and desolate desert climates on the earth, the Taklamakan Desert, and to its south the largely uninhabited Kunlun Mountains (Qurum). To the east there were few oases beyond Niya, making travel difficult, and access is only relatively easy from the west. 
Khotan was irrigated from the Yurung-kàsh and Kara-kàsh rivers, which water the Tarim Basin. These two rivers produce vast quantities of water, which made habitation possible in an otherwise arid climate. The location next to the mountain not only allowed irrigation for crops but also increased the fertility of the land, as the rivers reduced the gradient and deposited sediment on their banks, creating a more fertile soil. This more fertile soil increased the agricultural productivity that made Khotan famous for its cereal crops and fruit. Therefore, Khotan&#x27;s lifeline was its proximity to the Kunlun mountain range, and without it Khotan would not have become one of the largest and most successful oasis cities along the Silk Roads.

The kingdom of Khotan was one of the many small states found in the Tarim Basin, which included Yarkand, Loulan (Shanshan), Turfan, the Kashgar, Karashahr, and Kucha (the last three, together with Khotan, made up the four Garrisons during the Tang dynasty). To the west were the Central Asian kingdoms of Sogdiana and Bactria. It was surrounded by powerful neighbours, such as the Kushan Empire, China, Tibet, and for a time the Xiongnu, all of which had exerted or tried to exert their influence over Khotan at various times.

==History==
From an early period, the Tarim Basin had been inhabited by different groups of Indo-European speakers such as the Tocharians and Saka people. Jade from Khotan had been traded into China for a long time before the founding of the city, as indicated by items made of jade from Khotan found in tombs from the Shang (Yin) and Zhou dynasties. The jade trade is thought to have been facilitated by the Yuezhi.

===Foundation legend===
There are four versions of the legend of the founding of Khotan. It is important to note that these legends were not contemporary or primary accounts. They were written centuries after the kingdom was founded.&quot; These may be found in accounts given by the Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang and in Tibetan translations of Khotanese documents. All four versions suggest that the city was founded around the third century BC by a group of Indians during the reign of Ashoka. According to one version, the nobles of a tribe in ancient Taxila, who traced their ancestry to the deity Vaiśravaṇa, were said to have blinded Kunãla, a son of Ashoka. In punishment they were banished by the Mauryan emperor to the north of the Himalayas, where they settled in Khotan and elected one of their members as king. However war then ensued with another group from China whose leader then took over as king, and the two colonies merged. In a different version, it was Kunãla himself who was exiled and founded Khotan.

The legend suggests that Khotan was settled by people from northwest India and China, and may explain the division of Khotan into an eastern and western city since the Han dynasty. Others however argued that the legend of the founding of Khotan is a fiction as it ignores the Iranian population, and that its purpose was to explain the Indian and Chinese influences that were present in Khotan in the 7th century AD. By Xuanzang&#x27;s account, it was believed that the royal power had been transmitted unbroken since the founding of Khotan, and evidence indicates that the kings of Khotan had used an Iranian-based word as their title since at least the 3rd century AD, suggesting that they may be speakers of an Iranian language.

In the 1900s, Aurel Stein discovered Prakrit documents written in Kharoṣṭhī in Niya, and together with the founding legend of Khotan, Stein proposed that these people in the Tarim Basin were Indian immigrants from Taxila who conquered and colonized Khotan. The use of Prakrit however may be a legacy of the influence of the Kushan Empire. There were also Greek influences in early Khotan, based on evidence such as Hellenistic artworks found at various sites in the Tarim Basin, for example, the Sampul tapestry found near Khotan, tapestries depicting the Greek god Hermes and the winged pegasus found at nearby Loulan, as well as ceramics that may suggest influences from as far as the Hellenistic kingdom of Ptolemaic Egypt. One suggestion is therefore that the early migrants to the region may have been an ethnically mixed people from the city of Taxila led by a Greco-Saka or an Indo-Greek leader, who established Khotan using the administrative and social organizations of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. In Tibetan literature, a long list of Indian kings is preserved. Sten Konow, the Norwegian Indologist who critically examined the different versions of the tradition concluded as follows:
 According to the oldest detailed Chinese and Tibetan texts (including a Tibetan text which may be contemporary), which we cannot distrust, the colonizing groups of exiled Indians (including the son and ministers of Emperor Ashoka) founded the Kingdom of Khotan.

===Arrival of the Saka===
Surviving documents from Khotan of later centuries indicate that the people of Khotan spoke the Saka language, an Eastern Iranian language that was closely related to the Sogdian language (of Sogdiana); as an Indo-European language, Saka was more distantly related to the Tocharian languages (also known as Agnean-Kuchean) spoken in adjoining areas of the Tarim Basin. It also shared areal features with Tocharian. It is not certain when the Saka people moved into the Khotan area. Archaeological evidence from the Sampul tapestry of Sampul (Shanpulu; / ), near Khotan may indicate a settled Saka population in the last quarter of the first millennium BC, although some have suggested they may not have moved there until after the founding of the city. The Saka may have inhabited other parts of the Tarim Basin earlier – presence of a people believed to be Saka had been found in the Keriya region at Yumulak Kum (Djoumboulak Koum, Yuansha) around 200 km east of Khotan, possibly as early as the 7th century BC.

The Saka people were known as the Sai (塞, sāi, &quot;sək&quot; in Old Sinitic) in ancient Chinese records. These records indicate that they originally inhabited the Ili and Chu River valleys of modern Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. In the Chinese &quot;Book of Han&quot;, the area was called the &quot;land of the Sai&quot;, i.e. the Saka. According to the Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Shiji&quot;, the Indo-European Yuezhi, originally from the area between Tängri Tagh (Tian Shan) and Dunhuang of Gansu, China, were assaulted and forced to flee from the Hexi Corridor of Gansu by the forces of the Xiongnu ruler Modu Chanyu in 177-176 BC. In turn the Yuezhi were responsible for attacking and pushing the Sai (i.e. Saka) south. The Saka crossed the Syr Darya into Bactria around 140 B.C. Later the Saka would also move into Northern India, as well as other Tarim Basin sites like Khotan, Karasahr (Yanqi), Yarkand (Shache) and Kucha (Qiuci). One suggestion is that the Saka became Hellenized in the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, and they or an ethnically mixed Greco-Scythians either migrated to Yarkand and Khotan, or a bit earlier from Taxila in the Indo-Greek Kingdom.

Documents written in Prakrit dating to the 3rd century AD from neighbouring Shanshan show that the king of Khotan was given the title &quot;hinajha&quot; (i.e. &quot;generalissimo&quot;), a distinctively Iranian-based word equivalent to the Sanskrit title &quot;senapati&quot;. This along with the fact that the king&#x27;s recorded regnal periods were given as Khotanese &quot;kṣuṇa&quot;, &quot;implies an established connection between the Iranian inhabitants and the royal power,&quot; according to the late Professor of Iranian Studies Ronald E. Emmerick (d. 2001). He contended that Khotanese-Saka-language royal rescripts of Khotan dated to the 10th century &quot;makes it likely that the ruler of Khotan was a speaker of Iranian.&quot; Furthermore, he elaborated on the early name of Khotan:
Later Khotanese-Saka-language documents, ranging from medical texts to Buddhist literature, have been found in Khotan and Tumshuq (east of Kashgar). Similar documents in the Khotanese-Saka language dating mostly to the 10th century have been found in Dunhuang.

===Early period===

In the 2nd century AD a Khotanese king helped the famous ruler Kanishka of the Kushan Empire of South Asia (founded by the Yuezhi people) to conquer the key town of Saket in the Middle kingdoms of India: 
According to Chapter 96A of the &quot;Book of Han&quot;, covering the period from 125 BC to 23 AD, Khotan had 3,300 households, 19,300 individuals and 2,400 people able to bear arms.

===Eastern Han period===

Minted coins from Khotan dated to the 1st century AD bear dual inscriptions in Chinese and Gandhari Prakrit in the Kharosthi script, showing links of Khotan to India and China in that period.

Khotan began to exert its power in the first century AD. It was first ruled by Yarkand, but revolted in 25-57 AD and took Yarkand and the territory as far as Kashgar, thereby gaining control over part of the southern Silk Road. The town grew very quickly after local trade developed into the interconnected chain of silk routes across Eurasia.

King Guangde of Khotan submitted to the Han dynasty in 73 AD. Khotan at the time had relations with the Xiongnu, who during the reign of Emperor Ming of Han (57-75 AD) invaded Khotan and forced the Khotanese court to pay them large annual amounts of tribute in the form of silk and tapestries. When the Han military officer Ban Chao went to Khotan, he was received by the King with minimal courtesy. The soothsayer to the King suggested that he should demand the horse of Ban, and Ban killed the soothsayer on the spot. The King, impressed by Ban&#x27;s action, then killed the Xiongnu agent in Khotan and offered his allegiance to Han.

By the time the Han dynasty exerted its dominance over Khotan, the population had more than quadrupled. The &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot;, covering 6 to 189 AD, says:
Han influence on Khotan, however, diminished when Han power declined.

===Tang dynasty===

The Tang campaign against the oasis states began in 640 AD and Khotan submitted to the Tang emperor. The Four Garrisons of Anxi were established, one of them at Khotan.

The Tibetans later defeated the Chinese and took control of the Four Garrisons. Khotan was first taken in 665, and the Khotanese helped the Tibetans to conquer Aksu. Tang China later regained control in 692, but eventually lost control of the entire Western Regions after it was weakened considerably by the An Lushan Rebellion.

After the Tang dynasty, Khotan formed an alliance with the rulers of the Guiyi Circuit. The Buddhist entitites of Dunhuang and Khotan had a tight-knit partnership, with intermarriage between Dunhuang and Khotan&#x27;s rulers. Dunhuang&#x27;s Mogao grottos and Buddhist temples were also funded and sponsored by the Khotan royals, whose likenesses were drawn in the Mogao grottoes.

Khotan was conquered by the Tibetan Empire in 792 and gained its independence in 851.

The first recorded post-Tibetan King of Khotan was Viśa&#x27; Saṃbhava, who used the Chinese name Li Shengtian and claimed to a descendant of the Tang dynasty imperial family. While using the Indic-style title &quot;lion king&quot; (&quot;rajasimha&quot;) and the Near Eastern Emperor-like title &quot;king of kings&quot;, Viśa&#x27; Saṃbhava also used the Chinese title &quot;huangdi&quot; (emperor) in Khotan&#x27;s Chinese language court documents, and dressed in hats and robes of Chinese style. His son, Viśa&#x27; Śūra, used the combined title, &quot;king of kings of China&quot; (&quot;caiga rāṃdānä rrādi&quot;), portrayed himself as a Chinese emperor in portraiture, used Chinese-style imperial edicts signed with the character chi 勑 (&quot;edict&quot;, in imitation of the Tang and Song dynasties&#x27; edicts), and used a seal inscribed &quot;Han Son of Heaven of great Khotan&quot; (大于闐漢天子). Viśa&#x27; Saṃbhava married the daughter of Cao Yijin, the ruler of the Guiyi Circuit. Cao Yijin&#x27;s grandson, Cao Yanlu, married the third daughter of Viśa&#x27; Saṃbhava.

===Turco-Islamic conquest of Buddhist Khotan===

In the 10th century, the Iranic Saka Buddhist Kingdom of Khotan was the only city-state in the Tarim Basin that was not yet conquered by either the Turkic Uyghur Qocho Kingdom (Buddhist) or by the Turkic Kara-Khanid Khanate (Muslim). During the latter part of the tenth century, Khotan became engaged in a struggle against the Kara-Khanid Khanate. The Islamic conquests of the Buddhist cities east of Kashgar began with the conversion of the Karakhanid Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan to Islam in 934. Satuq Bughra Khan and later his son Musa directed endeavors to proselytize Islam among the Turks and engage in military conquests, and a long war ensued between Islamic Kashgar and Buddhist Khotan. Satuq Bughra Khan&#x27;s nephew or grandson Ali Arslan was said to have been killed during the war with the Buddhists. Khotan briefly took Kashgar from the Kara-Khanids in 970, and according to Chinese accounts, the King of Khotan offered to send in tribute to the Chinese court a dancing elephant captured from Kashgar.

Accounts of the war between the Karakhanid and Khotan were given in &quot; Taẕkirah of the Four Sacrificed Imams&quot;, written sometime in the period from 1700 to 1849 in the Eastern Turkic language (modern Uyghur) in Altishahr probably based on an older oral tradition. It contains a story about four Imams from Mada&#x27;in city (possibly in modern-day Iraq) who helped the Qarakhanid leader Yusuf Qadir Khan conquered Khotan, Yarkand, and Kashgar. There were years of battles where &quot;blood flows like the Oxus&quot;, &quot;heads litter the battlefield like stones&quot; until the &quot;infidels&quot; were defeated and driven towards Khotan by Yusuf Qadir Khan and the four Imams. The imams however were assassinated by the Buddhists prior to the last Muslim victory. Despite their foreign origins, they are viewed as local saints by the current Muslim population in the region. In 1006, the Muslim Kara-Khanid ruler Yusuf Kadir (Qadir) Khan of Kashgar conquered Khotan, ending Khotan&#x27;s existence as an independent Buddhist state. Some communications between Khotan and Song China continued intermittently, but it was noted in 1063 in a Song source that the ruler of Khotan referred to himself as kara-khan, indicating dominance of the Karakhanids over Khotan.

It has been suggested Buddhists in Dunhuang, alarmed by the conquest of Khotan and ending of Buddhism there, sealed Cave 17 of the Mogao Caves containing the Dunhuang manuscripts so to protect them. The Karakhanid Turkic Muslim writer Mahmud al-Kashgari recorded a short Turkic language poem about the conquest:

According to Kashgari who wrote in the 11th century, the inhabitants of Khotan still spoke a different language and did not know the Turkic language well. It is however believed that the Turkic languages became the lingua franca throughout the Tarim Basin by the end of the 11th century.

By the time Marco Polo visited Khotan, which was between 1271 and 1275, he reported that &quot;the inhabitants all worship Mohamet.&quot;

==Buddhism==
The kingdom was one of the major centres of Buddhism, and up until the 11th century, the vast majority of the population was Buddhist. Initially, the people of the kingdom were not Buddhist, and Buddhism was said to have been adopted in the reign of Vijayasambhava in the first century BC, some 170 years after the founding of Khotan. However, an account by the Han general Ban Chao suggested that the people of Khotan in 73 AD still appeared to practice Mazdeism or Shamanism. His son Ban Yong who spent time in the Western Regions also did not mention Buddhism there, and with the absence of Buddhist art in the region before the beginning of Eastern Han, it has also been suggested that Buddhism may not have been adopted in the region until the middle of the second century AD.

The kingdom is primarily associated with the Mahayana. According to the Chinese pilgrim Faxian who passed through Khotan in the fourth century:
It differed in this respect to Kucha, a Śrāvakayāna-dominated kingdom on the opposite side of the desert. Faxian&#x27;s account of the city states it had fourteen large and many small viharas. Many foreign languages, including Chinese, Sanskrit, Prakrits, Apabhraṃśas and Classical Tibetan were used in cultural exchange. A number of Buddhist monks who played an important role in the transmission of Buddhism in China had their origins in Khotan including Śikṣānanda and Śīladharma.

== Christianity ==
According to the 11th-century Persian historian Gardizi, there were two East Syriac Christian churches within the kingdom&#x27;s territory in the mid 5th–11th century, one inside the city of Khotan and one outside the city. A Christian cemetery has also been found in Khotan. In the &quot;Taḏkera&quot; of Maḥmūd-Karam Kābolī, it is recorded that Khotan was governed by a Christian ruler in the middle of the 12th century. Despite being a source of dubious historical value, this statement of the &quot;Taḏkera&quot; has been accepted as authentic by . A Chinese-manufactured Melkite cross with Greek inscription was bought at Khotan during the Mongol period. A supposed reference to Christianity in a Khotanese text has been proved illusory by .

== Social and economic life ==
Despite scant information on the socio-political structures of Khotan, the shared geography of the Tarim city-states and similarities in archaeological findings throughout the Tarim Basin enable some conclusions on Khotanese life. A seventh-century Chinese pilgrim named Xuanzang described Khotan as having limited arable land but apparently particularly fertile, able to support &quot;cereals and producing an abundance of fruits&quot;. He further commented that the city &quot;manufactures carpets and fine-felts and silks&quot; as well as &quot;dark and white jade&quot;. The city&#x27;s economy was chiefly based upon water from oases for irrigation and the manufacture of traded goods.

Xuanzang also praised the culture of Khotan, commenting that its people &quot;love to study literature&quot;, and said &quot;[m]usic is much practiced in the country, and men love song and dance.&quot; The &quot;urbanity&quot; of the Khotan people is also mentioned in their dress, that of &#x27;light silks and white clothes&#x27; as opposed to more rural &quot;wools and furs&quot;.

=== Silk ===

Khotan was the first place outside of inland China to begin cultivating silk. The legend, repeated in many sources, and illustrated in murals discovered by archaeologists, is that a Chinese princess brought silkworm eggs hidden in her hair when she was sent to marry the Khotanese king. This probably took place in the first half of the 1st century AD but is disputed by a number of scholars.
One version of the story is told by the Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang who describes the covert transfer of silkworms to Khotan by a Chinese princess. Xuanzang, on his return from India between 640 and 645, crossed Central Asia passing through the kingdoms of Kashgar and Khotan (Yutian in Chinese).

According to Xuanzang, the introduction of sericulture to Khotan occurred in the first quarter of the 5th century. The King of Khotan wanted to obtain silkworm eggs, mulberry seeds and Chinese know-how - the three crucial components of silk production. The Chinese court had strict rules against these items leaving China, to maintain the Chinese monopoly on silk manufacture. Xuanzang wrote that the King of Khotan asked for the hand of a Chinese princess in marriage as a token of his allegiance to the Chinese emperor. The request was granted, and an ambassador was sent to the Chinese court to escort the Chinese princess to Khotan. He advised the princess that she would need to bring silkworms and mulberry seeds in order to make herself robes in Khotan and to make the people prosperous. The princess concealed silkworm eggs and mulberry seeds in her headdress and smuggled them through the Chinese frontier. According to his text, silkworm eggs, mulberry trees and weaving techniques passed from Khotan to India, and from there eventually reached Europe.

=== Jade ===

Khotan, throughout and before the Silk Roads period, was a prominent trading oasis on the southern route of the Tarim Basin – the only major oasis &quot;on the sole water course to cross the desert from the south&quot;. Aside from the geographical location of the towns of Khotan it was also important for its wide renown as a significant source of nephrite jade for export to China.

There has been a long history of trade of jade from Khotan to China. Jade pieces from the Tarim Basin have been found in Chinese archaeological sites. Chinese carvers in Xinglongwa and Chahai had been carving ring-shaped pendants &quot;from greenish jade from Khotan as early as 5000 BC&quot;. The hundreds of jade pieces found in the tomb of Fuhao from the late Shang dynasty by Zheng Zhenxiang and her team all originated from Khotan. According to the Chinese text &quot;Guanzi&quot;, the Yuezhi, described in the book as Yuzhi 禺氏, or Niuzhi 牛氏, supplied jade to the Chinese. It would seem, from secondary sources, the prevalence of jade from Khotan in ancient Chinese is due to its quality and the relative lack of such jade elsewhere.

Xuanzang also observed jade on sale in Khotan in 645 and provided a number of examples of the jade trade.

=== Khotan coinage ===
The Kingdom of Khotan is known to have produced both cash-style coinage and coins without holes

==Genetics==
===Haplogroups===
At the cemetery in Sampul (Chinese: 山普拉), ~14 km from the archaeological site of Khotan in Lop County, where Hellenistic art such as the Sampul tapestry has been found (its provenance most likely from the nearby Greco-Bactrian Kingdom), the local inhabitants buried their dead there from roughly 217 BC to 283 AD. Mitochondrial DNA analysis of the human remains has revealed genetic affinities to peoples from the Caucasus, specifically a maternal lineage linked to Ossetians and Iranians, as well as an Eastern-Mediterranean paternal lineage. Seeming to confirm this link, from historical accounts it is known that Alexander the Great, who married a Sogdian woman from Bactria named Roxana, encouraged his soldiers and generals to marry local women; consequentially the later kings of the Seleucid Empire and Greco-Bactrian Kingdom had a mixed Persian-Greek ethnic background.

According to other genetic studies, the Khotanese Sakas had paternal haplogroups Q1a, O3a, O2a, R1a, R1b.
Among the maternal haplogroups were H6a, H14b, U3b, U4b, M3, U5b, H, U4a, C4a, W3a, H6a, U5a, H2b, H5c, T1a, J1b, R2, N.

===Autosomal DNA===
Genetically, the Khotanese Sakas were of heterogeneous origin, primarily descended from steppe pastoralists associated with the Andronovo/Sintasha and Afanasevo cultures, with significant contributions from Bronze Age populations associated with bmac, Baikal HG, Yellow farmer and local Tarim mummies, and minor contributions from APS and AASI. During the Iron Age, the inhabitants received minor gene flow associated with the Xiongnu.

<doc id="721666" wikidata="Q521660" url="?curid=721666" title="Sierra Nevada (stratovolcano)">
<text>Sierra Nevada is a stratovolcano located in the La Araucanía Region of Chile, near the Llaima volcano. Its last certain eruptions were in the Pleistocene period, but its activity may extend into the Holocene. Its primary lavas are andesitic and basaltic flows, although it has also produced pyroclastic flows. Lahars are also a hazard of this volcano. This stratovolcano is located in Conguillío National Park.

<text>Good Food (formerly UK Food and UKTV Food) is a retired subscription cookery channel broadcasting in the United Kingdom and Ireland, latterly as part of the Discovery, Inc. network of channels. The channel originally launched on 5 November 2001 and relaunched in its final format on 22 June 2009. Good Food was available on satellite through Sky, on cable through Virgin Media, and through IPTV with TalkTalk TV, BT TV. From 2015 to 2018, Good Food was temporarily rebranded as Christmas Food.

==History==
Prior to the launch of the channel, UK Style was the home to food programmes in the UKTV network. The increasing addition of more lifestyle programmes on UK Style led to these programmes overcrowding the schedule. On 11 July 2001, UKTV announced they would launch UK Food in November. The channel officially launched on 5 November, broadcasting from 7:00am to 7:00pm everyday, timesharing with UK Drama.

On 29 May 2002, UK Food launched on NTL.

On 10 January 2003, after a successful first year gaining 7.5 million viewers since its launch, UKTV announced that UK Food would extend broadcast hours to 5:00 am – 9:00 pm, gaining four more hours in its slot. To make up for this, UK Drama reduced its hours to 9:00 pm – 5:00 am. On 12 November, a one-hour timeshift service - UK Food +1, launched, airing between 6:00 am and 7:00 pm every day.

On 8 March 2004, UK Food and UK Food +1 were renamed as UKTV Food and UKTV Food +1, respectively. On the same day, UK Horizons&#x27; half-replacement UKTV People launched in UKTV Food +1&#x27;s evening slot, airing from 7:00 pm to 4:00 am. On 22 June, it was announced that UKTV Food would extend its broadcast hours to end at 1:00 am, with the possibility of going 24 hours at the end of the year. At the same time, it was also announced that UKTV People would move out of UKTV Food +1&#x27;s downtime slot and extend its broadcast hours as well. With the extension of the broadcast hours, UKTV Drama moved into the vacated evening slot on UKTV Food +1&#x27;s slot.

After UKTV Drama extended its broadcast hours to the daytime in May 2005, UKTV Food +1&#x27;s evening slot remained vacant, and on 23 February 2006, to coincide with Sky&#x27;s EPG shuffle, it was announced that UKTV Food +1 would extend broadcast hours to include the entire day.

As part of the rebranding of all UKTV&#x27;s channels to a unique name and identity, UKTV Food rebranded as Good Food on 22 June 2009, the last of UKTV&#x27;s brands to do so. The name was based on that of the &quot;BBC Good Food&quot; cookery magazine, published by Immediate Media Company. The channel and the magazine continued to be operated separately. On 13 July 2009, Virgin Media revealed that they were &quot;currently in active talks&quot; with UKTV about launching a high-definition version of Good Food on their cable television platform.

On 31 August 2010, Good Food became the first UKTV channel to broadcast in high definition when Good Food HD launched as a Sky exclusive. As with a majority HD channels, Good Food HD was an HD simulcast of the channel&#x27;s schedule.

As part of Virgin Media&#x27;s deal to sell its share of UKTV, all five of UKTV&#x27;s HD channels were added to Virgin&#x27;s cable television service by 2012. Good Food HD was added to Virgin Media on 7 October 2011.

On 1 April 2019, it was announced that UKTV co-owner Discovery Inc. would acquire the BBC&#x27;s stake in Good Food. They took it over along with sister channels Home and Really in June. On 5 September 2019, Discovery announced that Good Food would merge with Food Network and close on 12 September 2019, with its programmes moving to the sister channel. Good Food was removed from Virgin Media on 11 September, while the channel itself was shut down on 12 September 2019, after which the channel space created in 2001 by UK Food ceased to exist. The last programme shown was an episode of &quot;Choccywoccydoodah&quot;.

==On-air identity==

When UK Food launched in 2001, the channel adopted a branding package based around circular shaped foods with a spiral pattern located in the centre when looked at from above. The channel&#x27;s logo at the time featured the name, stylised as UK Food, and a two lined spiral extending outwards from the right of the name. The majority of UKTV channels had some pattern located there to distinguish the channel, and this spiral also featured in the idents themselves as well as channel promotions.

Following the rebranding as UKTV Food, the channel&#x27;s identity was altered. The swirling motif was retained within the idents themselves: the logo was the only thing changed. Indeed many of the previous idents survived rebrand reuse. The primary difference was the addition of the two lined UKTV logo, aligned to the left of the screen. The channels colour was orange, and was used in different shades as the background colour to all promotion end boards and static slides both on the channel and for promotion across the network.

Following the rebrand to Good Food, the idents changed to sequences involving the coming together of ingredients to events such as a picnic barbecue, a dinner party and a family Sunday roast. The idents finished with an endboard featuring the circular Good Food logo in the centre of a screen with food imagery in the background, such as fish outlines, knife and fork or wine glasses.

==Former programming==
Good Food used a large amount of programming from the BBC&#x27;s programme archive, and was similar to a former international channel run by BBC Worldwide called BBC Food, as both use similar programming and both have a similar format. The channel also aired programmes from the ITV and Channel 4 programming archive and programming aired on other domestic and international channels bought in by the channel. These programmes included:

==Website==
The Good Food website, originally devised and launched by Ian Fenn and Ally Branley, provided information on programmes shown on the channel, recipes, message boards, and a wine club. Recipes came from the various shows on Good Food and some included videos taken from the demonstrations. In September 2006 Good Food&#x27;s website overtook the BBC Food site in popularity for the first time, achieving a 10% market share, compared to BBC Food&#x27;s 9.63% share. The channel&#x27;s website now redirects to Food Network&#x27;s UK website.

<text>Bringing Up Father is an American comic strip created by cartoonist George McManus. Distributed by King Features Syndicate, it ran for 87 years, from January 2, 1913, to May 28, 2000.

The strip was later titled Jiggs and Maggie (or Maggie and Jiggs), after its two main characters. According to McManus, he introduced these same characters in other strips as early as November 1911.

==Characters and story==
The strip centers on an immigrant Irishman named Jiggs, a former hod carrier who came into wealth in the United States by winning a million dollars in a sweepstakes. Now nouveau-riche, he still longs to revert to his former working class habits and lifestyle. His constant attempts to sneak out with his old gang of boisterous, rough-edged pals, eat corned beef and cabbage (known regionally as &quot;Jiggs dinner&quot;), and hang out at the local tavern were often thwarted by Maggie, his formidable, social-climbing (and rolling-pin wielding) of a wife, their lovely young daughter Nora, and infrequently their lazy son Ethelbert, later known as Sonny. Also a character presented in the strip (portrayed as a miserly borrower) was named, fittingly, Titus Canby (&quot;tight as can be&quot;).

The strip deals with &quot;lace-curtain Irish&quot;, with Maggie as the middle-class Irish American desiring assimilation into mainstream society in counterpoint to an older, more raffish &quot;shanty Irish&quot; sensibility represented by Jiggs. Her lofty goal—frustrated in nearly every strip—is to bring Father (the lowbrow Jiggs) &quot;up&quot; to upper class standards, hence the title, &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot;. The occasional malapropisms and left-footed social blunders of these upward mobiles were gleefully lampooned in vaudeville and popular song, and formed the basis for &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot;.

Varied interpretations of McManus&#x27;s work often highlight difficult issues of ethnicity and class, such as the conflicts over assimilation and social mobility that second- and third-generation immigrants confronted. McManus took a middle position, which aided ethnic readers in becoming accepted in American society without losing their identity. A cross-country tour that the characters took in September 1939 into 1940 gave the strip a big promotional boost and raised its profile in the cities they visited.

Jiggs and Maggie were generally drawn with circles for eyes, a feature also associated with the later strip &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;.

==Origin and sources==
McManus, who numbered Aubrey Beardsley among his influences, had a bold, clean-cut cartooning line. His strong sense of composition and Art Nouveau and Art Deco design made the strip a stand-out on the comics page.

McManus was inspired by &quot;The Rising Generation&quot;, a musical comedy by William Gill that he had seen as a boy in St. Louis, Missouri&#x27;s Grand Opera House, where his father was manager. In &quot;The Rising Generation&quot;, Irish-American bricklayer Martin McShayne (played by the fat Irish comedian Billy Barry in the stage production McManus saw) becomes a wealthy contractor, yet his society-minded wife and daughter were ashamed of him and his lowbrow buddies, prompting McShayne to sneak out to join his pals for poker. McManus knew Barry and used him as the basis for his drawings of Jiggs. McManus&#x27;s wife, the former Florence Bergere, was the model for daughter Nora.

One of McManus&#x27;s friends, restaurateur James Moore, claimed he was the inspiration for the character Dinty Moore, the owner of Jiggs&#x27;s favorite tavern. James Moore changed his name to Dinty and founded a real-life restaurant chain. The restaurant owner, however, did not begin the successful line of Dinty Moore canned goods marketed today by Hormel.

A surrealistic running gag throughout the strip, always removed from the main action of the story, involved hanging wall paintings that &quot;come to life&quot;, with subjects often &quot;breaking the fourth wall&quot;, escaping the confines of the picture frames, or changing position from panel to panel within the same strip. None of the nominal stars of the strip ever seemed to notice the animated figures, or anything unusual happening on the walls in the background directly behind them.

Comics historian Don Markstein wrote about McManus&#x27;s characters:
:On January 12, 1913 [actually January 2], he debuted &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot;, about an Irishman named Jiggs, who doesn&#x27;t understand why his ascension to wealth via the Irish Sweepstakes means he can&#x27;t hang out with his friends, and his nagging, social-climbing wife, Maggie. The strip was an instant hit, possibly because of its combination of an appealing cast of characters with a unique look of art-nouveau splendor... Before McManus died, in 1954, &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot; made him two fortunes (the first was lost in the 1929 stock market crash). By that time, Jiggs&#x27;s Irishness had faded—the new generation saw him as just a rich guy that liked to hang out with a regular crowd.

An uncredited script collaborator on the strip was McManus&#x27;s brother, Charles W. McManus, who was 61 when he died August 31, 1941. He also had his own comic strips in the 1920s, &quot;Dorothy Darnit&quot; and &quot;Mr. Broad&quot;.

==Topper strips==

In 1926, McManus added a Sunday topper strip above &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot;, beginning with &quot;No Brains But&quot; (January 10 to May 9, 1926) and &quot;Good Morning, Boss!&quot; (May 16 to June 6, 1926). Starting on June 13, 1926, McManus changed the topper to &quot;Rosie&#x27;s Beau&quot;, a revival of his previous Sunday page (which ran from October 29, 1916 to April 7, 1918). &quot;Rosie&#x27;s Beau&quot; continued as the topper until November 12, 1944.

On April 17, 1938, an absent-minded character named Sir Von Platter in &quot;Rosie&#x27;s Beau&quot; realized he was in the wrong place and climbed down into the first panel of &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot;, arriving in the living room of Maggie and Jiggs.

Starting on November 19, 1944, McManus replaced &quot;Rosie&#x27;s Beau&quot; with &quot;Snookums&quot;, itself a revival of a 1904-1916 McManus strip, &quot;The Newlyweds and Their Baby&quot;, now focused on their son, the titular character. &quot;Snookums&quot; remained as the topper for &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot; until December 31, 1956, at which point it became a standalone Sunday feature distributed until the early 1960s.

In the final episode of HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Pacific&quot; (2010), Robert Leckie (James Badge Dale) is seen reading &quot;Snookums&quot;.

Other minor topper panels overlapping with the above were &quot;Things We Can Do Without&quot; (July 23, 1933 to April 22, 1934), &quot;How to Keep From Getting Old&quot; (April 1, 1934 to May 19, 1935), &quot;It&#x27;s the Gypsy in Me&quot; (May 26, 1935 to April 25, 1937) and &quot;What&#x27;ll I Do Now&quot; (January 5 to March 15, 1936).

==Artists==

Between 1935 and 1954, McManus&#x27;s assistant Zeke Zekley made a major contribution to the strip in both writing and art. Other artists, including Bill Kavanagh and Frank Fletcher, also contributed. When McManus died in 1954, King Features replaced Zekley with Vernon Greene. With Greene&#x27;s death in 1965, Hal Campagna stepped in, and Frank Johnson (&quot;Boner&#x27;s Ark&quot;) replaced Campagna in 1980. Hy Eisman ghosted the strip for a short time after Greene&#x27;s death. King Features wanted him to take it over, but Eisman was close friends with Greene, and he was unable to agree to take the strip on. The strip&#x27;s popularity faded, and &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot; limped along until its 87-year run came to a close on May 28, 2000.

In 1995, the strip was one of 20 included in the Comic Strip Classics series of commemorative US postage stamps. &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot; went digital in 2007 when King Features made the strip available as one of the selections in its DailyINK email package.

==International syndication==
In Mexico, the strip was titled &quot;Educando a Papá&quot;, with Jiggs and Maggie being renamed as &quot;Pancho&quot; and &quot;Ramona&quot; respectively. In Chile, Jiggs was known as &quot;Don Fausto&quot;. In Argentina, it was known as &quot;Trifón y Sisebuta&quot;, and in Brazil as &quot;Pafúncio e Marocas&quot;. In Yugoslavia and Serbia it has been published as &quot;Porodica Tarana&quot; since 1935. In Turkey, the strip was published daily by &quot;Hürriyet&quot; until the late 1990s under the name &quot;Güngörmüşler&quot; (The Worldly-wiseds) with Jiggs renamed to Şaban and Maggie renamed to Tonton (darling). In Italy, Jiggs and Maggie became &quot;Arcibaldo e Petronilla&quot; and the strip, published by the children magazine &quot;Corriere dei Piccoli&quot; since 1921, was very popular.

&quot;Bringing Up Father&quot; still enjoys popularity in Norway. Known as &quot;Fiinbeck og Fia&quot;, the strip was published weekly in the family journal &quot;Hjemmet&quot; from 1921 until the early 2000s; and a Christmas book with the strip has been published every year since 1930, in the last few decades mostly reprints of material produced by McManus in the 1940s and 1950s. A similar publication was also an annual event (from 1931 to 1977) in Sweden, where the strip is known as &quot;Gyllenbom&quot;. In Denmark the series went under the name &quot;Gyldenspjæt&quot;. In Finland, the strip was called &quot;Vihtori ja Klaara&quot; and appeared in the major daily &quot;Uusi Suomi&quot; from 1929 until the paper folded in 1991. In the Finnish version, Jiggs&#x27; favorite dish of corned beef and cabbage became &quot;lammaskaali&quot; (literally &quot;mutton cabbage&quot;), which under the name &quot;fårikål&quot; is actually a Norwegian national dish.

In Japan, &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot; was first published in April 1, 1923 in the &quot;Asahi Graph&quot;, as &quot;Oyaji kyōiku&quot;. The strip was published daily in the magazine (interrupted by the Great Kantō earthquake, resuming to be published weekly from November 14 afterwards) until 1940; its success inspired strips by Japanese comic artists, like Yutaka Asō&#x27;s &quot;Nonkina tōsan&quot; (&quot;Easygoing daddy&quot;).

==Maggie and Jiggs in other media==
===Stage===

Gus Hill&#x27;s production of &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot; opened on Broadway in 1914, with music composed by Frank H. Grey, lyrics by Elven E. Hedges, libretto by John P. Mulgrew and Thomas Swift, choreography by Edward Hutchinson, and directed by Frank Tannehill, Jr. Hill produced many more theatrical versions of the strip that toured the country, including &quot;Bringing Up Father in Florida&quot;, &quot;Bringing Up Father on Broadway&quot;, &quot;Bringing Up Father in Ireland&quot;, &quot;Bringing Up Father Abroad&quot;, and &quot;Bringing Up Father in Wall Street&quot;.

&quot;Bringing Up Father at the Seashore&quot; opened on Broadway at the Manhattan Opera House in 1921, but closed after 18 performances; a revised version reopened in 1928. Another of Hill&#x27;s productions of &quot;Father&quot; opened at the Lyric Theatre in 1925. According to The Holloway Pages&#x27; history of the strip: &quot;Reportedly, this version had Maggie following a fleeing Jiggs from Ireland to a yacht headed for Spain, but the story was halted frequently for various vaudeville acts. The show closed after 24 performances&quot;.

Sponsored by Lever Brothers, the &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot; radio series aired on the Blue Network from July 1 to September 30, 1941, starring Mark Smith (1887–1944) as Jiggs and Agnes Moorehead as Maggie. Neil O&#x27;Malley also portrayed Jiggs. Their daughter Nora was played by Helen Shields and Joan Banks. Craig McDonnell (1907–1956) was heard in the role of Dinty Moore. The 30-minute program aired Tuesdays at 9pm.

===Animation===
The following are silent animated cartoons based on &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot;, all produced by International Film Service and released through Pathé Exchange:
* &quot;Father Gets into the Movies&quot; (1916)
* &quot;Just Like a Woman&quot; (1916)
* &quot;A Hot Time in the Gym&quot; (1917)
* &quot;The Great Hansom Cab Mystery&quot; (1917)
* &quot;Music Hath Charms&quot; (1917)

* &quot;Father&#x27;s Close Shave&quot; (1918)
* &quot;Jiggs and the Social Lion&quot; (1918)
In 1924, a Chilean studio created a feature-length film entitled &quot;Vida y milagros de Don Fausto&quot; (&quot;Life and Miracles of Jiggs&quot;), which used the strip&#x27;s characters (likely without authorization). This is the second oldest-known animated film made in the country.

In 1927, Norwegian filmmaker Ottar Gladtvet produced one of the country&#x27;s earliest animated films, a commercial featuring Jiggs and Maggie titled &quot;Fiinbeck er rømt&quot; (&quot;Jiggs Has Run Away&quot;), in which Maggie purchases the finest tobacco Tiedemanns Tobakk AS has to offer in a bid to keep Jiggs from going out.

===Live-action two-reel shorts===

A series of live-action silent comedies featured comedian Johnny Ray as Jiggs, Margaret Cullington as Maggie and Laura La Plante as daughter Nora. Directed by Reggie Morris, these were produced by International Film Service and released through Pathé Exchange. Confusingly enough, a couple of the titles were duplicated from the earlier cartoons. This series included:
* &quot;Jiggs in Society&quot; (1920)
* &quot;Jiggs and the Social Lion&quot; (1920)
* &quot;Jiggs&#x27; Close Shave&quot; [aka &quot;Father&#x27;s Close Shave&quot;] (1920)

===Live-action feature films===
The following feature-length films were based on the strip:
* &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot; (1928) Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer: Silent comedy directed by Jack Conway, written by Frances Marion with titles by Ralph Spence, starring J. Farrell MacDonald as Jiggs, Polly Moran as Maggie, Gertrude Omstead as their daughter (renamed &quot;Ellen&quot;), and Jules Cowles and Marie Dressler as Mr. and Mrs. Dinty Moore.
* &quot;Vihtori ja Klaara&quot; (Finland, 1939): The first sound comedy based on the strip, although the characters are speaking Finnish; directed by filmmaker Teuvo Tulio.

The &quot;Jiggs and Maggie&quot; film series, all released by Monogram Pictures:
* &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot; (1946) directed by Edward F. Cline and written by Cline, Barney Gerard and Jerry Warner, starring Joe Yule as Jiggs, Renie Riano as Maggie, George McManus (as himself), Tim Ryan as the stingy and belligerent Dinty Moore, and Pat Goldin as the ever-silent Dugan.
* &quot;Jiggs and Maggie in Society&quot; (1948)
* &quot;Jiggs and Maggie in Court&quot; (1948)
* &quot;Jiggs and Maggie in Jackpot Jitters&quot; (1949)
* &quot;Jiggs and Maggie Out West&quot; (1950)
The series was discontinued due to the death of Joe Yule in March 1950. Yule is the father of Mickey Rooney, who expressed interest in reviving Jiggs onstage in the late 1980s. Both Martha Raye and Cloris Leachman were considered for the part of Maggie, but the project was never produced.

==Parodies and guest appearances==
* In issue #17 of &quot;Mad&quot;, Harvey Kurtzman&#x27;s story &quot;Bringing Back Father&quot;, illustrated by Will Elder and Bernard Krigstein, depicted Jiggs as the victim of domestic abuse, bruised and bleeding after physical assaults by the domineering Maggie, who has struck Jiggs with thrown kitchen utensils and crockery. When Kurtzman died in 1993, slides from this parody were shown by Art Spiegelman at Kurtzman&#x27;s memorial service in the Time-Warner building.
* In his book &quot;In the Shadow of No Towers&quot;, Spiegelman drew himself as Jiggs and his wife as Maggie. He also included a reprint of a &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot; Sunday strip.
* In the comic strip &quot;Arlo and Janis&quot; (March 17, 2006), Jiggs is invited to the home of Arlo and Janis for corned beef and cabbage in honor of the day. He enjoys himself immensely, and entertains his hosts with his stories, jokes and witticisms. Everyone has a happy St. Patrick&#x27;s Day.
* In Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Power Pack&quot;, Jiggs is the King of Elsewhere and receives a visit from Katie Power. Maggie is the Queen, wiser and more powerful than the King.
* Jiggs and Maggie renew their friendship with Walt Wallet in &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot;, by Jim Scancarelli, on April 30, 2013. This continues on August 10, 2018.

<text>Sierra Nevada, also known as Sierra Nevada de Lagunas Bravas, is a major ignimbrite-lava dome complex which lies in both Chile and Argentina in one of the most remote parts of the Central Andes.

Activity in the complex started in Argentina and formed two stratovolcanoes. Later, 12 or more vents formed, some with craters up to wide. Lava flows up to long with flow ridges are also found. It covers a total area of 225 km2. Radiometric dating has yielded ages of 1.7 ± 0.4 to 0.431 ± 0.012 million years ago, a lava flow from the neighbouring Azufrera Los Cuyanos volcano that is sometimes considered part of Sierra Nevada is 140,000 years old. Together with Cerro el Condor and Peinado it forms the Culampaja line, a line of volcanoes that reaches Cerro Blanco. Strong seismic attenuation is observed beneath Sierra Nevada. Hydrothermally altered rocks in Sierra Nevada may be the source of sulfate and arsenic in the Juncalito and Negro rivers, and heat sources for regional hot springs. The snowline in the area lies at altitude at Cumbre del Laudo.

== First ascent ==
Sierra Nevada&#x27;s main summit was one of the last peaks climbed in the Andes. It was thought that its secondary summit, , which sits on the border, was the highest. New measurements however show that the main summit is entirely in Argentina, east. The complex has 9 main summits.

<doc id="721696" wikidata="Q8052976" url="?curid=721696" title="U&amp;Yesterday">
<text>U&amp;Yesterday is a British free-to-air television channel broadcasting in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It launched on 30 October 2002 as UK History and relaunched in its current format on 2 March 2009. It is available on satellite through Sky, Freesat and through the digital terrestrial provider Freeview. Hours on Freeview had previously been cut, with transmissions finishing at 6pm, but were restored on 1 June 2010.

==History==
On 30 June 2002, UKTV announced the closure of Play UK at the end of the year, citing that the closure of ITV Digital was the reason for its demise. On 13 September, UKTV announced the closure of the channel would be moved forward to the end of September, and that to prepare for the launch of Freeview, the bandwidth space would be replaced with a new channel - UK History.

Play UK closed as planned at the end of September, and the following month on 30 October, the launch date for the Freeview platform itself, UK History launched, becoming an offshoot of UK Horizons with most of its factual and documentary programmes moving over; however, the launch of UK History allowed Horizons to broadcast more programmes in their schedule.
On 28 January 2004, a timeshift service - UK History +1 was launched on Sky Digital. The channel broadcasts the UK History schedule one hour later than the main channel, but contains no special programming or branding, with the occasional exception of a different DOG. The channel launched on Telewest the following week on 4 February. On 8 March 2004, the channel&#x27;s &quot;UK&quot; prefix was changed to the full &quot;UKTV&quot; name, renaming the networks as UKTV History and UKTV History +1, as with the rest of the UKTV network. 

The channel was available full-time on all platforms until 15 October 2007 when the hours were reduced on the Freeview platform, resulting in the channel stopping broadcasting at 6pm each day. This was a result of the launch of Dave, which took over UKTV History broadcast capacity. UKTV History took over the slot used by the unsuccessful UKTV Bright Ideas that was sharing a slot with Virgin1 and Babestation. The channel&#x27;s inability to broadcast in prime time on Freeview resulted in a ratings drop. In November 2007, the channel had a 0.3per cent share of all television viewing, compared to 0.5per cent a year earlier.

As part of a network-wide programme of relaunching all the UKTV channels under unique names and brands, UKTV History and UKTV History +1 were renamed as Yesterday and Yesterday +1, respectively, on 2 March 2009. The new channel also took on extra programming including historical fact drama series and factual programmes previously broadcast on UKTV Documentary concerning the natural history of the British Isles.

On 1 June 2010, Yesterday reinstated its full broadcast hours on Freeview, following the closure of the Virgin1 +1 channel.

On 7 October 2011, Yesterday +1 was reinstated on Virgin Media. 

On 24 July 2012, Yesterday offers more entertainment-led content along with a design refresh, which includes a new logo and idents, in order to attract a wider and younger audience, along with a new slogan, &quot;Entertainment Inspired By History&quot;. For example, the channel has broadcast more repeats of situation comedies, such as &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; or &quot;Butterflies&quot;. The network moved to channel 19 on 19 September 2012, swapping with sister channel Dave.

In late 2014, Yesterday began slowly decreasing the amount of comedy and drama shown on the channel and branching out into more factual content, with notable additions including natural history, science and engineering alongside the classic slate of history programming.

On 8 December 2015, Yesterday became available on Freesat together with two of its UKTV sister channels Drama and former sister channel, Really.

Yesterday +1 launched on Freeview channel 99 on 22 November 2018, but was removed on 16 January 2019.

On 10 June 2019, Yesterday moved to channel 25 on Freeview, a space previously occupied by its former sister channel Home, which Discovery, Inc. acquired along with Good Food and Really as part of a deal with its current owner BBC Studios.

Yesterday +1 returned on Freeview on channel 75 on 15 April 2020, with the channel moving up one slot, next to UKTV&#x27;s newly acquired sister channel CCXTV, on 7 December 2020 (though channel 74 is only currently used for two hours of teleshopping a night rather than broadcasting any of Yesterday&#x27;s programmes). On 4 November 2020, the channel moved to channel 26 as part of a move up where every channel from channel 24 to 54 on the platform moved up one place to allow BBC Four to move to channel 24 in Scotland due to new Ofcom rules regarding certain PSB channels requiring greater prominence on EPGs.

On 8 July 2022, test transmissions for the HD feed of Yesterday commenced, using the frequency 12226 H 27500 2/3 DVB-S2 8PSK. A month later, on 8 August 2022, Yesterday&#x27;s HD feed officially launched on Sky Q and Sky HD channel 155 where it replaced the standard definition feed on the EPG. The HD feed was added to Virgin Media on 14 December 2022.

On 16 July 2024, Yesterday &amp; Yesterday +1 were renamed to U&amp;Yesterday &amp; U&amp;Yesterday +1, respectively as part of a network wide rebrand with the &quot;U&quot; masterbrand.

On 16 October 2024, U&amp;Yesterday +1 was replaced by U&amp;Eden on Freeview.

==Programming==
The majority of the channel&#x27;s programmes are sourced from the BBC programme archives; however, some are bought in from other terrestrial stations and some productions are commissioned by UKTV themselves. Programmes previously shown on terrestrial channels like BBC One, Two and Four are usually edited for timing, to accommodate the current three commercial breaks within each hour-long programme. The most obvious example of this is for programmes originally broadcast on the BBC, as material lasting 58 minutes will be edited down to 42 minutes when shown on U&amp;Yesterday. Some of U&amp;Yesterday&#x27;s notable programmes include:

<text>WCVO is a radio station in Gahanna, Ohio, United States located at 104.9 MHz broadcasting family-friendly Christian music as &quot;104.9 the River&quot; in Central Ohio. The station was started by the Christian Voice of Central Ohio (CVCO), which was incorporated in 1964. In 2008, the parent company changed its name to One Connection Media Group. Since 2015, the organization has called itself River Radio Ministries. 104.9 the River&#x27;s slogan is &quot;Uplifting and Encouraging&quot;.

==History==

WCVO began broadcasting with 3,000 watts on 104.9 FM in 1972, with the studios and tower located at 4400 Reynoldsburg New Albany Road, just south of Ohio 161. An illuminated cross at the top of the tower made the station&#x27;s facilities easy to locate for several miles. The station&#x27;s facilities remained located here until 2011, when they relocated the studios to 881 East Johnstown Road. The transmitter is now located along Hamilton Road, broadcasting at 6,000 watts.

The station was the first Christian station to serve Columbus and area communities. For over 25 years the station broadcast a mix of Christian talk, preaching broadcasts, and Christian music of various genres. In 1982, a sister station with a similar format, WCVZ 92.7 FM was started in Zanesville, Ohio.

Christian Voice of Central Ohio, Inc. (CVCO) valued prayer to the point of dedicating a room in their facilities as a &quot;Prayer Chapel&quot;, and broadcast a daily &quot;Prayer Line&quot; program that invited listeners to call and share prayer needs, which were lifted in prayer by volunteer hosts.

CVCO is a non-profit 501c3 organization, and has relied throughout its history on donations from listeners and business underwriters. Each year a &quot;Sharathon&quot; event invited participation by listeners.

In April 2016, the Ohio Supreme Court determined that WCVO-FM is considered a place of &quot;public worship&quot; and therefore exempt from property taxes, overturning an earlier decision by Ohio tax commissioner Joseph Testa.

WCVO broadcasts in the HD Radio format.

<text>The St. Joseph River (known locally as the St. Joe) is a river that flows in a generally westerly direction through southern Michigan and northern Indiana, United States, before emptying into Lake Michigan. The St. Joseph River drainage basin covers , and is the third largest watershed draining to Lake Michigan. The land within its bounds is primarily used for agriculture. The river and its tributaries provide a variety of paddling and fishing environments. Historically, the river served as an important canoe transportation route for various Native American tribes, and for French Canadian Voyageurs.

==Description of the watershed==

The St. Joseph River watershed drains from 15 counties: Berrien, Branch, Calhoun, Cass, Hillsdale, Kalamazoo, St. Joseph and Van Buren in Michigan and DeKalb, Elkhart, Kosciusko, LaGrange, Noble, St. Joseph and Steuben in Indiana. The watershed includes 3,742 river miles (6,022 km) and flows through and near the Kalamazoo-Portage, Elkhart-Goshen, Mishawaka-South Bend, and St. Joseph/Benton Harbor metropolitan areas. The St. Joseph River main stem is long, rising in southern Michigan in Hillsdale County flowing from Baw Beese Lake, within of the headwaters of the other St. Joseph River of the eastward-flowing Maumee River watershed. Baw Beese Lake was historically named for the Potawatomi Chief Baw Beese.

The river follows a zigzag route generally westward across southern Michigan, dipping into northern Indiana. From its headwaters, it flows initially northwest past Hillsdale into southeastern Calhoun County, then turns abruptly southwest to flow past Tekonsha, Union City, Sherwood, and Mendon. At Three Rivers it is joined from the north by the Rocky and Portage rivers, and by the Prairie River from the east, after making an abrupt turn south. At Constantine it receives the Fawn River from the east. Next, after returning to a southwest course, it receives the Pigeon River from the east, near the Michigan–Indiana state line. In northern Indiana, the river flows west-southwest through Elkhart, Mishawaka, and South Bend, where it turns abruptly to north to re-enter southwestern Michigan in southeastern Berrien County. In southwestern Michigan, it follows a wide meandering route generally northwest through Niles and past Berrien Springs. Just North of Niles it receives the Dowagiac River. It divides St. Joseph and Benton Harbor, receiving the Paw Paw River from the north approximately from its mouth in St. Joseph on Lake Michigan.

There are 190 dams in the St. Joseph River watershed, and 17 on the river mainstem. Most of these dams block fish passage, although fish ladders constructed on the lower dams allow salmonine passage as far as the Twin Branch Dam in Mishawaka, Indiana. But, the fish ladders are not adequate for many native species, such as sturgeon, and the dams tend to be built on the higher gradient portions of the river, which are the most critical river habitats for fish spawning.

==History==
saakiiweesiipiiwi (Outlet River, also historically spelt &quot;Sakiwasipi&quot;), as it was called by the Miami people, was inhabited for thousands of years by various indigenous tribes as it served an essential trade avenue in the Great Lakes region. The most recent indigenous inhabitants of the area were the Miami and Potawatomi peoples. Two different portages allowed nearly continuous travel by canoe among different watersheds of the region. The first major transfer point was at the headwaters in southwestern Michigan, where travelers could make a portage to the St. Joseph River of the Maumee River watershed, which drained into Lake Erie. The second major transfer point was at South Bend, Indiana, where a short portage to the nearby Kankakee River allowed access to the Illinois River and subsequently to the Mississippi. Another major access point along river was at Niles, Michigan, where the Old Sauk Trail, a major east-west Indian trail, crossed the river.

The indigenous trade and navigation networks in the area allowed for extensive trade and movement of people, which allowed early Europeans access to the area in 1675 when Père Jacques Marquette was guided up the Mississippi River via the Illinois River, then to the Kankakee River and portaged to Sakiwasipi and then down to Lake Michigan. On November 1, 1679 René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle sailed southeast across Lake Michigan and built Fort Miami at the mouth of the river. La Salle named the river La Rivière des Miamis (River of the Miamis).

At the end of 1679, La Salle followed indigenous trade routes in the opposite direction of that taken by Marquette; heading up the St. Joseph River and portaging to the Kankakee River, getting as far west on the Illinois River as modern-day Peoria, Illinois, before returning to Fort Miami. After giving up on the return of his ship, &quot;Le Griffon&quot;, in April 1680, he became the first European to walk the well traveled indigenous routes east across the Lower Peninsula of Michigan back to the Detroit River and Canada. The French established Fort St. Joseph at the crossroads of Old Sauk Trail and this well-established east–west trail in 1691.

The watershed was later used as canoe route by early French fur trappers in the Illinois Country. European American settlement of the St. Joseph river basin area began to increase in earnest after southwestern Michigan was surveyed in 1829. From the early 1830s until 1846, the river bore various commodities from upstream to a busy port at St. Joseph, where they were loaded onto lake boats for shipment to Chicago and elsewhere.

On April 11, 1893, a Lake Michigan &quot;seiche&quot; (a phenomenon similar to an ocean tsunami) pushed a wall of water, high, up the river at St. Joseph and Benton Harbor. This raised the level of the river by . The cause of the seiche was unknown, but has been attributed to a sudden squall or change in atmospheric pressure.

===South Bend Race Canals===
Factories located in South Bend because of access to the river and hydro-power created in the East and West Races.
The water rights to what would become the East and West Races were claimed by Alexis Coquillard and Lathrop Taylor in 1831, when the city of South Bend was founded. 
Although the idea of digging a mill race (man-made canal) was put forth in 1835, a dam and the East and West Races were not constructed until 1843. The construction was done by the South Bend Manufacturing Company, incorporated in December 1842 for this very purpose. The South Bend Manufacturing Company thus became owner of the water power rights on the West Race canal, while Samuel L. Cottrell purchased the water rights along the East Race canal.

In 1867 the South Bend Hydraulic Company purchased the rights to the East Race canal for $100. In 1903 the ownership of stock, property rights, and property of the South Bend Manufacturing Company on the West Race canal passed to the Oliver Chilled Plow Works. Over the next two years the Oliver Chilled Plow Works constructed a hydro-electric power plant on the waterway to supply electricity for light, heat, and power to the Oliver Opera House, Oliver Hotel, South Bend factories, and other Oliver buildings.

Other sources of energy and changes in technology resulted in the canals no longer being used for industrial purposes. In the late 1940s the Indiana and Michigan Electric Company purchased the rights along the East Race canal. They began filling it in around 1954 for re-use for other purposes. In 1973 the Oliver Chilled Plow Works hydro-electric plant was demolished to make room for construction of the Century Center, which was completed in 1977. The West Race still exists as a canal North of Jefferson Boulevard and South of Colfax Avenue on the banks of Century Center, between Pier Park and Island Park.

In the early 1980s, the East Race canal was re-excavated. It was converted to a man-made whitewater kayaking course, now known as the East Race Waterway.

====East Race Waterway====

In 1984, the abandoned East Race canal in South Bend, whose outlets were both at the river, was converted into the East Race Waterway, North America&#x27;s first artificial whitewater waterway and the first of four in the United States. Locals first proposed in 1973 that the 19th-century waterway be reopened; construction began in August 1982 and the East Race reopened on June 29, 1984. Through the use of movable barriers and obstacles, the East Race can be configured to provide a whitewater course for recreational and competitive canoeing, kayaking and rafting. In 2021, the East Race was temporarily closed for construction. The City of South Bend is building a hydroelectric dam on the waterway. The project was funded by the University of Notre Dame.

===Historic sites===

Two sites in the river basin, Moccasin Bluff and Fort St. Joseph, are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Carey Mission, Fort Miami, and Burnett Trading Post are listed as State Registered Historic Sites.

==Ecology and conservation==
Before European settlement, the watershed was dominated by deciduous forests consisting of maple, ash, oak, elm, walnut, and beech species, along with pockets of white, red and jack pine species. There were also prairies up to several miles across, which were grazed by elk (&quot;Cervus canadensis&quot;), white-tailed deer (&quot;Odocoileus virginianus&quot;), moose (&quot;Alces alces&quot;), and bison (&quot;Bison bison&quot;). By 1900 the virgin forests were mostly logged, and the prairies largely converted to agricultural use, as were many drained wetlands.
Among the unique natural features that remain in the watershed are prairie fens, coastal plain marshes, bogs, floodplain forests, hardwood swamps, and moist hardwood forests. Rare plants include prairie dropseed (&quot;Sporobolus heterolepis&quot;), rosinweed, tall beak rush, and umbrella grass.

The wetlands and floodplain forests provide habitat to nearly half of all migratory birds in Indiana and Michigan and are a vital habitat for resident species as well, such as wild turkey (&quot;Meleagris gallopavo&quot;), coyote (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;), fox, beaver (&quot;Castor canadensis&quot;), mink (&quot;Neogale vison&quot;), Indiana bat (&quot;Myotis sodalis&quot;), eastern box turtle (&quot;Terrapene carolina carolina&quot;), and the rare spotted turtle (&quot;Clemmys guttata&quot;) and northern redbelly snake (&quot;Storeria occipitomaculata occipitomaculata&quot;), both protected by the state of Michigan. The lower Pigeon River is home to the federally endangered Indiana Bat.

In 1969, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources began stocking the lower of the river for steelhead trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;), Chinook salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha&quot;) and coho salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus kisutch&quot;). In 1975, Michigan constructed a fish ladder at the Berrien Springs Dam to enable the salmonids to run an additional upstream to the Buchanan Dam. In 1980 the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, Indiana Department of Natural Resources and United States Fish and Wildlife Service signed the &quot;St. Joseph River Interstate Cooperative Salmonid Management Plan&quot;, which led to construction of fish ladders at the Buchanan, Niles, South Bend and Mishawaka dams. By 1992 the salmonid runs were extended to the Twin Branch Dam in Indiana, a distance of from Lake Michigan. This enabled the trout and salmon to spawn in coldwater tributaries such as McCoy Creek.

Although completion of fish ladders on the lowest five mainstem dams in 1992 allowed salmonine passage as far as Twin Branch Dam in Mishawaka, Indiana, 94% of the fish that pass are salmon and trout, as the ladders were not designed to permit passage of migrating native fish. Historically, the migrating native species included lake sturgeon (&quot;Acipenser fulvescens&quot;), bass (smallmouth and largemouth), redhorse (silver, golden, shorthead, river, and greater) (&quot;Moxostoma ssp.&quot;), walleye (&quot;Sander vitreus&quot;), lake trout (&quot;Salvelinus namaycush&quot;), lake whitefish (&quot;Coregonus clupeaformis&quot;), northern pike (&quot;Esox lucius&quot;) and American pickerel (&quot;E. americanus vermiculatus&quot;). Every spring the Potawatomi and early settlers used spears, seines and dip nets to catch their annual supply of fish. The abundance of lake sturgeon made the area around Niles famous in the mid-to late-1800s. Fish up to long and were taken by anglers, and their roe was exported to Russia as caviar. Sturgeon used to migrate as far as Hillsdale County, Michigan, and Sturgeon Lake near Colon, Michigan, still bears the name of this mighty fish. Now the spawning sturgeon rarely reach Niles, as they are impeded by the dam at Berrien Springs, reducing the length of the river used by them for spawning by . Historically, ninety-seven species of fish were native to the St. Joseph River Basin.

In 1994, the Friends of the St. Joe River (FotSJR), a non-profit conservation organization, was founded by Athens, Michigan, residents Al and Margaret Smith, to organize the river communities to clean and restore the river. In 2002 FotSJR developed the St. Joseph River Watershed Management Plan, with grant support from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. The river delivers significant pollutants to Lake Michigan - including sewage overflows from riverside communities, sediments and toxic substances such as mercury and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB). When the plan was developed, the river carried the greatest portion of atrazine into Lake Michigan. It is an agricultural herbicide associated with cancer even at low levels and is a very common contaminant of drinking water.

==Recreation==
The St. Joseph River is a trout and salmon sport fishery, encompassing of river in Michigan and in Indiana. The economic benefits to local Michigan and Indiana communities are estimated at several million dollars annually.

Canoeists can travel the entire length of the main stem, if they are prepared to portage. Many of the larger tributaries offer opportunities for paddling, hiking, hunting, and fishing.

<text>WNND and WNNP, branded Rewind 103.5/104.3, are two FM radio stations serving the Columbus, Ohio, market. Owned by Saga Communications and operated as part of its Columbus Radio Group, WNND broadcasts on 103.5 MHz from Pickerington, Ohio, and WNNP broadcasts on 104.3 MHz from Richwood, Ohio. Rewind 103.5/104.3&#x27;s studios are located in Upper Arlington.

These frequencies have simulcast for most of their history, joining from 1999 to 2009 and again since 2010. WNND launched in 1989 as WSWZ and switched to smooth jazz as WJZA in 1998. WNNP launched in 1995 as a separate jazz station, WZJZ, before flipping to a simulcast of WJZA as WJZK in 1999. The simulcast was broken in 2009, when 104.3 switched to classic hits as WODB &quot;Big Hits B104.3&quot;. Both stations were relaunched, again as a simulcast but this time in the classic hits format, on July 30, 2010, adopting their present call signs.

At 4:35 p.m. on July 30, 2010, after a brief stunt airing songs with an &quot;end&quot; theme, WJZA and WODB became &quot;Rewind 103.5/104.3: Columbus&#x27; Greatest Hits,&quot; and adopted a 1980s-based classic hits format. The first song on &quot;Rewind&quot; was &quot;Let&#x27;s Groove&quot; by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire. On August 6, 2010, WJZA and WODB changed their call letters to WNND and WNNP, respectively.

WNND broadcasts in the HD Radio format.

==History==
WNND and WNNP are now one of two radio stations in the Columbus market to have a Classic Hits format, joining Newark-based WNKO. They also feature the second 1980s-derived classic hits format in Columbus radio history, as sister station WVMX was all-1980s WXST (&quot;Star 107.9&quot;) back in the late 1990s.

===WSWZ (FM), later WJZA (103.5 FM)===

On 103.5 MHz, WSWZ (FM) signed on the air at 6 AM on October 7, 1989 with 6 kilowatts from a non-directional antenna on Tower Hill north of Lancaster that also reached into nearby Columbus, more than 30 miles distant. &quot;Z-103&quot; programmed an oldies format to Lancaster and Columbus that ultimately proved so popular that two more powerful FM stations in Ohio&#x27;s capital city also switched to an oldies format. Along with the oldies format, WSWZ-FM also programmed local newscasts twice an hour in the mornings, and twice an hour in the afternoons. In its later years, the station received most of its oldies from a satellite playlist service, but kept 8 hours of local programming along with news inserts during morning and afternoon drive times.

New owners changed the call letters of WSWZ to WJZA on February 13, 1998, and switched the format to smooth jazz, taking the format previously aired on 107.5 in Columbus. That station dropped the WJZA calls and smooth jazz format on December 26, 1997 in exchange for WCKX&#x27;s calls and format, which were dropped from 106.3 FM (now known as WHTD).

In time, the usage of the &quot;smooth jazz&quot; name was taken very liberally as WJZA shifted to a hybrid of Adult Contemporary, Urban AC, and instrumental covers, while the majority of WJZA&#x27;s programming was soon derived from Broadcast Architecture&#x27;s &quot;Your Smooth Jazz&quot; service, which chiefly operated under this hybrid style. The jazz and smooth jazz formats proved sustainable, but not as popular as the original oldies format on WSWZ.

===WNNP (104.3 FM)===
WNNP began broadcasting in 1995 as WZJZ with a jazz format. In 1999, WZJZ switched to a simulcast of WJZA&#x27;s smooth jazz programming under the WJZK call letters. Their classic hits format, known as &quot;Big Hits B104.3&quot;, launched on February 2, 2009 at 12:00PM, taken from the former &quot;Big Hits B107.9&quot; WODB at 107.9, which a few days earlier, switched to a Hot AC format as WVMX, &quot;Mix 107.9.&quot; Morning host Dave Kay was the only local personality on the station, with the rest of the programming having been satellite-fed from Dial Global (but under a different channel than the one WTDA carried).

Due to WNNP&#x27;s transmitter originating 40 miles northwest from Columbus in Richwood, the 104.3 signal suffers coverage problems in the Columbus metro, mainly in the eastern and southern portions. While still WODB, the station filed an application to change its city of license and transmitter location from Richwood to West Jefferson, Ohio, along with increasing power from 3.4 KW to 6 KW, so as to offer better coverage in the Columbus area. The move ultimately was rejected by the FCC.

<text>Karisimbi is a commune in Goma in the North Kivu Province of the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The commune takes its name from the nearby Mount Karisimbi, a prominent volcano in the Virunga Mountains. Spanning an area of approximately 33,372 square kilometers, Karisimbi extends from Goma International Airport to the outskirts of the Mugunga neighborhood. It is bordered by the Masisi Territory to the south and Rwanda to the east. 

Primarily a residential area, Karisimbi hosts limited commercial activity and a structured administrative division. The commune is organized into 11 neighborhoods—Murara, Ndosho, Virunga, Bujovu, Mugunga, Kasika, Mabanga Nord, Mabanga Sud, Majengo, Kahembe, and Katoyi—which are further subdivided into 39 cells and 209 avenues.

== Administrative subdivision ==
Legally, both the city and commune function as decentralized administrative entities endowed with juridical personality, whereas the neighborhoods are merely administrative entities devoid of representation or legal personality (referenced in Article 82-006). Furthermore, each neighborhood is subdivided into smaller entities known as avenues, cells (&quot;cellules&quot;), and &quot;nyumba kumi&quot; (a cluster of ten houses overseen by an appointee designated by the neighborhood chief).

The commune is administratively segmented into 11 distinct neighborhoods:

# Ndosho: Formerly encompassed by the Keshero neighborhood, Ndosho occupies a hill and derives its name from the term &quot;round stone&quot; found between the villages Kyeshero and Bugamba. These villages amalgamated to form the Ndosho locality, extending from the Mudja &quot;groupement&quot; within the neighboring Bukumu Chiefdom. Presidential Decree No. 89-127 of 22 May 1989, redefined Goma&#x27;s neighborhoods, transforming this locality into the Ndosho neighborhood. It is geographically delimited to the north by the Mudja &quot;groupement&quot;, to the south by the Goma-Sake Road and the Keshero neighborhood, to the east by Katoyi, and to the west by the Mugunga neighborhood. Ndosho comprises seven cells and 31 avenues.
# Mugunga: Situated at Goma&#x27;s threshold when approaching from the Masisi Territory and South Kivu Province, Mugunga is bordered by Rusayo to the north, Lac Vert to the south, Ndosho to the east, and Virunga National Park to the west. It is subdivided into six cells and 20 avenues.
# Virunga: Formerly referred to as &quot;Brazza&quot;, Virunga was one of the original four neighborhoods constituting the former city of Goma. Decree No. 89-127 officially established its boundaries on 22 May 1989. Bordered by Majengo to the north, Murara to the south, Bujovu and Goma International Airport to the east, and Mabanga-Nord to the west, Virunga is subdivided into four cells and 21 avenues.
# Murara: Known colloquially as the &quot;Office neighborhood&quot; due to the presence of homes constructed for state officers during the Belgian colonial period, Murara is bounded to the north by the CBCA Virunga General Hospital street, to the south by the Goma-Sake Road and Les Volcans neighborhood, to the east by Goma International Airport, and to the west by Denis Road. Notable landmarks such as the Paluku and Instigo-two lamps road, now referred to as &quot;Un kilomètre témoin&quot;, demarcate its division from Mabanga-Nord and Mabanga-Sud. It is subdivided into four cells and 34 avenues.
# Majengo: Majengo was formally recognized under Presidential Order No. 029/127 on 22 May 1983. It is bordered to the north by the Munigi groupement of the Bukumu Chiefdom, to the south by Virunga and Mabanga-Nord, to the east by Bujovu and Goma International Airport, and to the west by the Kasika and Katoyi neighborhoods.

<text>The U.S. Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) is a direct reporting unit of the U.S. Army that formerly provided command and control of the Army&#x27;s fixed-facility medical, dental, and veterinary treatment facilities, providing preventive care, medical research and development and training institutions. On 1 October 2019, operational and administrative control of all military medical facilities transitioned to the Defense Health Agency.

MEDCOM is commanded by the Surgeon General of the United States Army. The Surgeon General is also head of the U.S. Army Medical Department (the AMEDD).

== Peacetime garrison medicine until 2019==
MEDCOM maintained day-to-day health care for soldiers, retired soldiers and the families of both. Despite the wide range of responsibilities involved in providing health care in traditional settings, as well as on the battlefield, it was claimed that quality of care compared very favorably with that of civilian health organizations, when measured by civilian standards, according to findings of the DoD&#x27;s Civilian External Peer Review Program (CEPRP).

== Deployments ==
Historically, when Army field hospitals deployed, most clinical professional and support personnel came from MEDCOM&#x27;s fixed facilities. In addition to support of combat operations, deployments were for humanitarian assistance, peacekeeping, and other stability and support operations. Under the Professional Officer Filler System (PROFIS), up to 26 percent of MEDCOM physicians and 43 percent of MEDCOM nurses were sent to field units during a full deployment.

Medical personnel are now MTOE Assigned Personnel, referred to as &quot;MAPED&quot; or &quot;Reverse PROFIS.&quot; Under the new system, personnel are assigned to the MTOE (Modified Table of Organization and Equipment) unit with duty assigned elsewhere to support TDA facility operations. To substitute staff, Reserve units and Individual Mobilization Augmentees (non-unit reservists) are mobilized to work in medical treatment facilities. The department also provides trained medical specialists to the Army&#x27;s combat medical units, which are assigned directly to combatant commanders.

Many Army Reserve and Army National Guard units deploy in support of the Army Medical Department. The Army depends heavily on its Reserve component for medical support—about 63 percent of the Army&#x27;s medical forces are in the Reserve component. The concept of the Expeditionary Resuscitative Surgical Team (ERST) has been around for several years. However, an official force requisition for ERST Teams was relayed to LTG Nadja West, former Army Surgeon General, in January 2016. ERST falls under the command and control of Medical command (MEDCOM) for the US Army. ERST Training consists of 3 weeks that is split between Fort Sam Houston, TX and Camp Bullis, TX.

The first ERST Team was rapidly integrated and deployed in May 2016 as ERST 1. The training conducted to prepare the clinicians chosen for ERST is austere, arduous, and stressful. Often, clinicians must do complex procedures and care for patients in these training environments for prolonged periods of time, and with limited resources. ERST is also trained on operational decision making and planning to better posture them for the Special Operation Forces (SOF) environment. The members of the team are selected by their respective military occupational specialty&#x27;s (MOS) consultant to the surgeon general. The consultant for the MOS then sends the candidate&#x27;s name to The Surgeon General (TSG) for final approval. Selected members must be physically fit, subject matter experts in their fields, and ready to serve in a highly demanding position. An ERST Consists of elite 8 members. One Certified Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA), One General Surgeon, One Orthopaedic Physician&#x27;s Assistant (PA), One Emergency Department Physician, One Critical Care Intensivist, One Surgical Technician, One Emergency Department Critical Care RN, and one Intensive Care/Critical Care RN. These members have also usually served on prior deployments within their medical capacity.

The team can be broken into three sub-units; Damage Control Resuscitation (DCR Team), Damage Control Surgery (DCS Team), and Critical Care Evacuation Team (CCET). The DCR Team is composed of the ED Physician and ER RN. The DCR Team consists of the General Surgeon, Ortho PA, CRNA, and the Surgical Technician. CCET Team includes the Intensivist and ICU Critical Care RN. ERST&#x27;s mission is to deploy far forward with SOF units, decreasing the time between point of injury (POI) to surgical care in austere environments while also being as light and mobile as possible. At this time, ERST has only served in Africa Command&#x27;s area of responsibility (AOR).

Currently, there are only six ERST Teams in existence. With the deactivation of Medical Command (MEDCOM), the ERST Mission will be assumed by another organization within the Army as Defense Health Agency (DHA) continues to gain control over all TDA medical facilities in the Army, Air Force, and Navy.

== History ==
As the post–Cold War Army shrank, the U.S. Army&#x27;s Health Services Command (HSC) decided to change the way it did business and operate more like a corporation. In 1992, HSC launched &quot;Gateway To Care&quot;, a businesslike approach to health-care delivery. This was to be localized managed care, with improved quality, access and cost. In a design based more on catchment-area management than the previous &quot;CHAMPUS Reform Initiative&quot; (CRI), U.S. Army hospital commanders received more responsibility and managerial authority. Eleven &quot;Gateway to Care sites opened in the spring of 1992. By that fall, all HSC facilities had submitted business plans which were favorably received. Starting in 1994, &quot;Gateway To Care&quot; was gradually absorbed into a new regional Defense Department tri-service managed-care plan called TRICARE, which was modeled on CRI.

In August 1993, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff approved a plan to reorganize the AMEDD. The merger of several medical elements resulted in a new, expanded medical major command under the Surgeon General. In October 1993, the &quot;U.S. Army Medical Command (Provisional)&quot; began a one-year process of replacing HSC and absorbing other AMEDD elements. Surgeon General Lt. Gen. Alcide M. Lanoue commanded the provisional MEDCOM, while Maj. Gen. Richard D. Cameron continued as HSC commander. In November 1993, DENCOM and VETCOM were formed as provisional commands under the MEDCOM, to provide real command chains for more efficient control of dental and veterinary units—the first time those specialties had been commanded by the same authorities who provided their technical guidance. The next month, seven MEDCEN commanders assumed command and control over care in their regions. The new &quot;Health Service Support Areas&quot; (HSSAs), under the MEDCOM, had more responsibility and authority than the old HSC regions.

In March 1994, a merger of Medical Research and Development Command, the Medical Materiel Agency and the Health Facilities Planning Agency resulted in creation of the Medical Research, Development, Acquisition and Logistics Command (MRDALC), subordinate to the provisional MEDCOM. The MRDALC was soon renamed the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRMC). Then, in June 1994, an additional HSSA was formed to supervise medical care in Europe, replacing the 7th Medical Command, which inactivated. That summer, the Army Environmental Hygiene Agency formed the basis of the provisional Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (CHPPM).

Thus, in an unprecedented process of unification, U.S. Army medicine gradually came together in a new home under the command of the Surgeon General. Except for the field medical units commanded by the combat commanders, virtually all of Army Medicine became part of the MEDCOM. The MEDCOM became fully operational, dropping the &quot;provisional,&quot; in October 1994. In 1996, the HSSAs were renamed Regional Medical Commands and later in 2016, to Regional Health Commands.

===Transition circa 2019 ===
&quot;The Defense Health Agency is assuming administration and management responsibilities from the Army, Navy and Air Force for all military hospitals and clinics [as of] 1 Oct. 2019. Congress initiated this change in administration and management because they saw a need for a more flexible, adaptable, effective and integrated system to manage [U.S. military medical] facilities.

DHA will initially oversee these facilities through a direct support relationship with the Military Medical Department intermediate management organizations. The DHA will relieve the Military Departments of this support during a transition period in which responsibility for specific health care and administrative functions are fully transferred from the Military Departments to the DHA.

DHA is establishing a market-based structure to manage the hospitals and clinics. These market organizations will provide shared administrative services to the hospitals and clinics in their region. They will be responsible for generating medical readiness of active duty members and families in their regions, as well as ensuring the readiness of their medical personnel.&quot;

Other responsibilities formerly assigned to MEDCOM have also been transferred, as of 1 October 2019. Logistics and materiel research and supply have been assigned to United States Army Materiel Command, and medical training is now the responsibility of Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC). The Army Medical Department Center &amp; School (AMEDDC&amp;S) has been renamed the Army Medical Center of Excellence. The Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, MD, was transferred to the direct control of the Defense Health Agency.

Previous subordinate commands of MEDCOM also included the United States Army Dental Command, Fort Sam Houston, TX.

The Army Medical Department (&quot;the AMEDD&quot;) remains, as an overall administrative body, including the Medical Corps, Nurse Corps, Dental Corps, Veterinary Corps, Medical Service Corps, and Medical Specialist Corps.

<text>is a Japanese manga by Maekawa Tsukasa, originally published in the mid-1980s. The title roughly translates to &quot;Greater Tokyo Poverty Living Manual&quot;, and is an apt description of the comic&#x27;s premise.

==The story==
The protagonist of &quot;Dai-Tokyo&quot; is Kōsuke, a college graduate who decides to live a simple &#x27;no frills&#x27; lifestyle on little money in the Greater Tokyo Area. He has no full-time employment, and instead works only part-time jobs and does chores around the neighborhood in exchange for goods and services. He spends his free time enjoying life&#x27;s simple pleasures, reading, conversing with neighbors, and going out with his girlfriend. In this way Kōsuke breaks many traditions of Japanese society, such as not taking on the role of salaryman and striving for personal economic betterment. Despite this, Kōsuke is well respected and liked by his neighbors and friends, even if they do find him and his philosophy a bit peculiar. In the end, Kōsuke&#x27;s philosophy of mixing &#x27;poor&#x27; living with intellect and traditional Japanese values affirms much of Japanese culture and its traditions, rather than tears them down.

==Use of the word &quot;binbō&quot;==
In the title of, and throughout the manga, Maekawa chose to spell the Japanese word for poverty, &quot;binbō&quot;, using katakana instead of the usual kanji for two reasons. First, using katakana instead of a more traditional spelling gives a word a stronger emphasis (similar to italicizing or bolding a word in English). Second, using katakana can indicate that a word&#x27;s usage does not fall into the traditional meaning or sense of the word. The katakana lends emphasis since the manga revolves around Kōsuke&#x27;s &#x27;poor lifestyle&#x27;, and it differentiates his lifestyle (which he explicitly chose for himself) from the usual definition of poverty. So despite there being a common and easily recognizable kanji compound for &quot;binbō&quot; (貧乏), a katakana spelling is used instead (ビンボー).

==&#x27;Binbō&#x27; as a philosophy==
The very first page of the manga declares its philosophy: an army of characters from the manga holding up miniature Japanese flags yelling, &quot;Extravagance is the enemy!&quot; (ゼイタクは敵だ!! &quot;Zeitaku wa teki da!!&quot;). Two banners are held up in the background exclaiming, &quot;Poverty is fashion&quot; (ビンボーはファションだ &quot;Binbou wa fashon da&quot;) and,
&quot;Poverty is an ideology, it is life itself&quot; (ビンボーは思想だ 人生そのものだ &quot;Binbou wa shisou da / Jinsei sono mono da&quot;).

Maekawa&#x27;s use of the Japanese flag is to show that the image most associated with Japan—that of the hardworking, self-sacrificing, upwardly mobile Japanese salaryman—is not all there is to life in Japan. It is at the same time a condemnation of the excessive luxury and rampant consumption of much of the Japanese dominant society, and a championing of those left out of mainstream Japanese society. (Indeed, the first chapter&#x27;s title announces, &quot;I&#x27;m an ally of the poor man&quot; (私、ビンボー人の味方です &quot;Watashi, binbou-jin no mikata desu&quot;).) His message that you don&#x27;t have to have a lot of money and material goods to make yourself happy is repeated again and again throughout the story.

The manga&#x27;s &quot;binbō&quot; philosophy can be seen as similar to the voluntary simplicity movement, despite Maekawa&#x27;s somewhat different reasons for rejection of a consumerist lifestyle.

==&quot;Dai-Tokyo&quot; as a living guide==
Although &quot;Dai-Tokyo&#x27;s&quot; main concern may be entertainment and political statement, it also serves as a how-to guide for pulling off a successful and happy poor lifestyle. The entire second page of the manga is devoted to examples of &#x27;cheap living&#x27;, with several practical instances given, including ways to save money on food, drink, shoes, clothing accessories, and others. More examples are sprinkled throughout the rest of the manga as story elements. Outside of specific money-saving examples, many free or cheap activities, including games, cultural events, festivals, and so on are portrayed throughout the manga.

Despite the manga&#x27;s Japan-only availability, at least one writer has recommended &quot;Dai-Tokyo&quot; to people traveling to Japan as a good guide on how to enjoy their stay without spending too much.

==Publication==
There have been no official English translations of the manga as a whole (and thus no official English title), but Mangajin has translated several chapters in their magazine and small portions of it (a panel at a time) for use in various books as a teaching aid for those learning Japanese.

The original Japanese manga first appeared in the weekly manga &quot;Morning&quot; (モーニング) from March 1986 to October 1989. A total of 167 episodes appeared during this time, and two new episodes were written for the 2005 reprint. It has been collected in five volumes (tankōbon) twice, and again most recently as a two volume set:

<text>U&amp;Dave is a British free-to-air television channel that mainly broadcasts comedy-oriented factual programming. It is owned by UKTV, a subsidiary of BBC Studios.

Launched in October 1998 as UK Gold Classics, the channel would undergo various identity and formats changes before adopting the Dave branding on 15 October 2007. It was renamed U&amp;Dave in July 2024.

U&amp;DaveJaVu is its sister timeshift channel.

==History==

===UK Gold Classics and UK Gold 2 (1998–2003)===
UK Gold Classics was UKTV&#x27;s first digital-only channel. It was launched on 2 October 1998, and was only broadcast from Friday to Sunday on Sky Digital from 6.00pm to 2.00am. Around this time, UK Gold began to move away from older programmes and towards newer ones. Their &#x27;classics&#x27; line-up included a number of early shows, and some black-and-white programmes, which had been acquired in the early years of the UK Gold service. While Gold Classics showed some recent shows from the main Gold channel, its main purpose was older shows from the early years of UK Gold. On weekdays, the channel was off air, showing a still caption of all the UKTV channels and start-up times.

Some of the programmes that aired on UK Gold Classics were a repeat run of the ITV comedy series &quot;Oh No It&#x27;s Selwyn Froggitt&quot;, BBC comedy series &quot;Open All Hours&quot;, BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;, ITV police drama series &quot;The Bill&quot;, and ITV comedy series &quot;Gingerbread Girl&quot;. Some of UK Gold&#x27;s original commissioned programming that were recently aired on the main channel at the time (&quot;Wow-fab-Groovy&quot;, &quot;Tellystack&quot;, &quot;Sports Anorak of the Year&quot;, stand-up comedy show &quot;Live at Jongleurs&quot;, &quot;Rowland Rivron Bites The Bullet&quot; and music show &quot;Gold Goes Pop&quot;) also received airings on Gold Classics

The &#x27;Classics&#x27; format lasted just six months; ending on 28 March 1999. The following day, UKTV announced that the channel would be relaunched as UK Gold 2 from 2 April 1999, and eventually expand its broadcast hours. UK Gold 2 essentially functioned as a secondary timeshift service, with the channel screening UK Gold&#x27;s programmes from the morning of that day. On 24 May 1999, it was officially announced that the channel would start broadcasting daily from 1 June.

On 11 February 2002, UK Gold 2&#x27;s downtime within the day became home to UK Style +. On 29 May, the channel launched on NTL. and eventually on Telewest. On 1 August, the channel moved from 110 to 111 on the Sky EPG, to make room for UK Gold +1, which launched that day. In July 2003, UK Style + vacated the downtime slot used by UK Gold 2 and extended its broadcast hours.

====UK G² and UKTV G2 (2003–2007)====
On 28 October 2003, it was announced that UK Gold 2 would be relaunched and rebranded as UK G2 (stylized as UK G²) on 12 November. UK G2 was promoted as being an edgier alternative to UK Gold; airing programmes aimed at an 18-34 year-old youth audience. Some of the programmes that already aired on UK Gold moved to the new network, in addition to some programmes from Play UK (which had closed the year prior). The broadcast hours were also changed, with the channel now operating from 8:00pm to 5:00am.

On 8 March 2004, in-line with its sibling channels, the channel would adopt the full &quot;UKTV&quot; name, becoming UKTV G2. On 1 November, near the channel&#x27;s first anniversary, a one-hour timeshift service, UKTV G2 +1, was launched on Sky and Telewest., broadcasting from 9:00pm to 4:00am.

On 7 October 2005, it was announced that UKTV G2 would pilot a sports programming block titled &quot;UKTV Sport&quot;. The block would include a new show by the same name, as well as its own logo and digital on-screen graphic. The block was planned to be a pilot for a dedicated TV channel of the same name, which never came into fruition.

====Expansion of broadcast hours and addition of live sports (2006–2007)====
On 10 December 2005, UKTV announced that UKTV G2 would expand broadcast hours to the daytime and begin operations at 9:00am beginning on 16 January 2006. The expansion of hours was to prepare for the full launch of the UKTV Sport strand, which would fill out some of the daytime hours during sports events. Standard programmes featured included pre-watershed comedy programmes already seen on the channel, alongside the addition of popular-factual and magazine shows which were already running on UKTV People, such as &quot;Top Gear&quot; and &quot;Airport&quot;. The extended hours did not apply to UKTV G2 +1, which remained an evening-only service.

In February 2006, UKTV obtained the rights to show highlights of the Six Nations rugby union championship, with a highlights show broadcast on the evening of the games previously shown live on the BBC. On 16 March 2006, they announced a deal to air extensive coverage of the 2006 FIFA World Cup as a sub-licensing of the BBC&#x27;s rights to the tournament. UKTV G2 simulcast the BBC&#x27;s live matches, including the opening match between Germany and Costa Rica, England&#x27;s game with Paraguay and the final. The channel also showed highlights of every match in the tournament.

In April 2006, the channel acquired the rights to the quarter-finals of the EuroLeague Basketball and in August, UKTV G2 also picked up rights to the 2006 FIBA World Championship, forming the programme &#x27;UKTV Slam&#x27;.

===Relaunch as Dave and Freeview launch (2007–2022)===

In August 2007, UKTV announced they were considering on adding a planned relaunch of UKTV G2 to the digital terrestrial platform Freeview, replacing UKTV Bright Ideas. On 20 September 2007, UKTV officially announced that the relaunch of UKTV G2 would be called Dave; and that it would occur on 15 October, and would be added to Freeview on the same day. The channel&#x27;s name was chosen with UKTV saying that &quot;everyone knows a bloke called Dave&quot;. To prepare for the launch, UKTV Bright Ideas was shut down permanently, with UKTV History taking over its timesharing bandwidth with Virgin1, while Dave would launch in UKTV History&#x27;s former Freeview bandwidth. To ensure that all Freeview viewers received Dave on channel number 19, UKTV briefly placed a re-tuning notice on the programme&#x27;s information. The timeshift service UKTV G2 +1 was effectively renamed Dave +1 and expanded its own broadcast hours to match its parent network.

Dave used the tagline &quot;the home of witty banter&quot;, and had Ralph Ineson as an announcer; along with David Flynn, Phill Jupitus, Iain Lee and BBC Radio 1 DJ Greg James.

On 31 January 2008, the channel began broadcasting in widescreen, along with the other UKTV channels.
On 22 January 2009, following UKTV&#x27;s acquisition of a further Freeview broadcast slot, Dave +1 was made available on the digital terrestrial platform. Dave +1 would be renamed Dave ja vu (a play on the phrase &quot;déjà vu&quot;) on 24 February, in order to &quot;strengthen the brand&#x27;s positioning as the home of witty banter&quot; according to UKTV bosses. In April 2009, they aired three new instalments of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, entitled &quot;Back to Earth&quot;. This marked the channel&#x27;s first foray into scripted original programming. During the airing of the &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; mini-series, the Dave DOG in the top left corner of the screen had the word &#x27;Lister&#x27; added after it in the same font, after the show&#x27;s lead character; during the special it is even suggested that the station is named after him. &quot;Back to Earth&quot; brought record breaking viewing figures, not just in the context of the channel&#x27;s past, but for digital television in general. Subsequently, three full series of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; have been produced for Dave which aired in 2012, 2016 and 2017, along with a feature-length special in 2020. In June 2009, the logo was updated to incorporate the &#x27;circle&#x27; logo branding of all the new UKTV channels. At the same time, the voice of Dave became Nigel Grover, aka Scott Saunders, who had previously worked at a number of local radio stations.

On 14 June 2011, UKTV announced that Really would launch on Freeview on 2 August 2011. To facilitate this, Dave ja vu&#x27;s broadcast hours on the platform were reduced from 8.00 am-4.00 am to 2.00 am-4.00 am in order to keep the space for future use. On 29 July 2011, UKTV announced that it had secured a deal with BSkyB to launch three more high-definition channels on Sky UK. As part of Virgin Media&#x27;s deal to sell its share of UKTV, all five of UKTV&#x27;s HD channels would also be added to Virgin&#x27;s cable television service by 2012. Dave HD launched on 10 October 2011 on Sky and Virgin Media, two days before &quot;Watch HD&quot;, while &quot;Alibi HD&quot; launched in July 2012. All three channels are HD simulcasts of the standard-definition channel.

In September 2012, the channel swapped its Freeview EPG number with Yesterday, moving to channel 12. On 22 November 2012, UKTV confirmed that it had secured a deal for another 24-hour DTT slot and would use it for Dave ja vu until it firmed up permanent plans for the slot. Dave ja vu began to broadcast its full schedule on the platform again from 3 January 2013. Drama permanently took the slot from 8 July 2013, however Dave ja vu continued to broadcast between 2.00 am-5.00 am.

On 29 April 2014, the &#x27;circle&#x27; logo was removed and the original 2007 logo was restored. On 20 November, Dave ja vu returned to 24-hour broadcasting on Freeview.

Dave HD along with Good Food HD and Eden HD launched on BT TV on 3 October 2016.

In June 2019, Dave moved back to channel 19 on Freeview, a space previously occupied by Yesterday. This was following owner BBC Studios breaking up its joint venture with Discovery, Inc., with Discovery acquiring Good Food, Home and Really.

In November 2020, following UKTV&#x27;s purchase of CCXTV, Dave ja vu moved to channel 23, whilst CCXTV moved to Freeview 73.

After the relaunch of BBC Three (and with BBC Four in Scotland taking the next slot), Dave ja vu moved down to channel 25. This lasted until March 2022, when UKTV revealed that Dave would be going back to the 70s section on the Freeview EPG, as the channel number was used by UKTV for their female-skewing W channel. From 28 March 2022, Dave Ja Vu took Drama+1&#x27;s slot on Freeview 74, with that one-hour timeshift of Drama moving up to channel 60.

===2022–present===

On 9 November 2022, Dave was given a on-air refresh, including a new logo, idents, and a new slogan (&quot;Add a bit of Dave&quot;). 

On 16 July 2024, the channel was rebranded as &quot;U&amp;Dave&quot;, as part of the realignment of UKTV&#x27;s free-to-air networks under the new &quot;U&quot; masterbrand.

==Reception==
Within just one month of its launch, Dave was the tenth most viewed television channel in the UK. In November 2007, the broadcaster listed daily viewing averages at around 3 million viewers, although, much of the growth was attributed to its presence on Freeview; nonetheless, it was performing significantly better in pay TV homes than UKTV G2. Over the month since its launch, Dave averaged a 1.32% share in multichannel homes and a 3.2% share in the 16–34 male demographic.

Dave received 4 million viewers throughout 18 November 2007 for its coverage of &quot;Car of the Year&quot;, pushing it to second place in multichannel behind ITV2.

The first episode of &quot;Red Dwarf: Back to Earth&quot; attracted 2,060,000 viewers on the first viewing, though over 4 million viewed the episode at some point over its debut weekend. The highest rating original commission before this had been &quot;Red Bull X-Fighters&quot; (about 185,000).

In late May 2016, Dave broadcast full live coverage of the 2016 BDO World Trophy darts tournament.

In 2017, Dave started broadcasting live MMA with promotion BAMMA.

===Films===

In its early years, Dave aired a mix of black-and-white films like &quot;The Lavender Hill Mob&quot; and 90s films like &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot;.

In 2012, Dave introduced its &#x27;film club&#x27; where a different film would be shown every week, including &quot;Barton Fink&quot;, &quot;City of God&quot;, &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;, &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot;, &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, and &quot;Clerks&quot; to name a few.

In early 2016, Dave and Yesterday aired Western films during the daytime. From 2017, Dave mostly show films on Friday and Saturday nights, with Friday being a repeat of the film that was shown on a Saturday.

In 2019 and 2023, Dave showed a season of Quentin Tarantino movies.

<text>Bridgewater State University is a public university with its main campus in Bridgewater, Massachusetts, United States. It is the largest of nine state universities in Massachusetts. Including its off-campus sites in New Bedford, Attleboro, and Cape Cod, BSU has the fourth-largest campus of the 29 institutions in the Massachusetts Public Higher Education System. BSU&#x27;s sports teams are called the Bears. Its school colors are crimson, white, and black.

==History==
===Foundation===

Bridgewater State University was founded by Horace Mann as Bridgewater Normal School. It opened on September 9, 1840, making it the oldest permanently-located institution of public higher education in Massachusetts. As one of the first normal schools in the nation, its initial mission was to train school teachers. Today Bridgewater, which is regarded as the &quot;home of teacher education in America&quot;, has the largest enrollment of teacher education students in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Since the 1960s, the school has expanded its program to include liberal arts, business, and aviation science. It became a university and took on its present name, Bridgewater State University, in 2010. During its history, it has also been known as Bridgewater State Normal School (1846), Bridgewater State Teachers College (1932), State Teachers College at Bridgewater (1960), and Bridgewater State College (1965).

The normal school opened in the basement of the Old Bridgewater Town Hall, in a 40-foot by 50-foot space, divided into three rooms: an ante-room for students, an apparatus room, and a classroom. The first class consisted of 21 women and seven men. Nicholas Tillinghast, the first principal (1840–53) was initially the only instructor. The school year consisted of two 14-week terms. Students were not required to attend consecutively.

In 1845, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts finally agreed to construct a building for Bridgewater State Normal School, the first building ever erected in America for the preparation of teachers. This two-story wooden building, 64 feet by 42 feet, accommodating 84 students, was to be the institution&#x27;s educational plant for almost half a century. There were small and large classrooms, with blackboards in each. Since changes were made to the school, the board of education required people to attend three terms for fourteen consecutive weeks, establishing a year&#x27;s course. The building was dedicated on August 19, 1846, with Horace Mann saying on the occasion: Among all the lights and shadows that ever crossed my path, this day’s radiance is the brightest...I consider this event as marking an era in the progress of education—which as we all know is the progress of civilization-on this western continent, and throughout the world. It is the completion of the first normal schoolhouse ever erected in Massachusetts,—in the Union,—in this hemisphere. It belongs to that class of events which may happen once, but are not capable of being repeated. Coiled up in this institution, as in a spring, there is a vigor whose uncoiling may wheel the spheres. This first normal school established a professional standard for the preparation of teachers, breaking away from traditional academics for attendance. It was the next step toward establishing educational institutions for specific purposes.

Bridgewater Normal School trained its students in elementary-school subjects; expansion subjects above the elementary level including mathematics, philosophy, and literature; and pedagogy, including philosophy of teaching and discipline based on child psychology, and as much practical experience under constant supervision as possible at the model school.

===1924 fire===
An early-morning fire on Wednesday, December 10, 1924, destroyed three of the college&#x27;s buildings, over half of the campus: Tillinghast Hall, the Training School, and old Woodward dormitories. The Normal School and the boiler room were saved. The fire was so large that other towns&#x27; fire departments had to be called to assist. The cause of the fire was not definitely established, but it is believed to have been either &quot;rats or mice&quot; gnawing in the heating ducts, or a spontaneous combustion. There were reportedly no injuries.

The Normal School and boiler room were repaired immediately. Tillinghast Hall was rebuilt and a new Woodward dorm built. The training school was housed in a different building temporarily and later a new building was built for it exemplifying a well equipped elementary school, with a gym and playground. The total State appropriation for the Normal School repairs and rebuilding of the training school was $606,566, in addition to $86,500 from the town. The Normal Building and Tillinghast Hall were rebuilt and opened in June 1926, now renamed as Boyden Hall and Harrington Hall.

===Mid twentieth century to present===
In the 1950s, many veterans of the Korean War enrolled and proms were the highlight of the year for them. In 1957 the John J. Kelly Gym was built and in 1959 SAT scores were required to be submitted for the first time.

During the 1960s the liberal arts curriculum was introduced. The Ivy Exercises, in which the junior class would form an archway with ivy leaves leading up to the school on graduation day, were dying out. In 1960 Pope Hall was built as an all-women&#x27;s dorm. Scott Hall was built in 1961 as an all-men&#x27;s dorm. The Marshall Conant Science Building was built in 1964 and was named after the school&#x27;s second principal. In 1967 Shea and Durgin Halls were built as co-ed dorms.

In 1971 The Clement C. Maxwell Library was completed. In 1976 the tennis courts opened and students could enjoy movies on Sundays and Tuesdays for 25 to 75 cents. From 1970 to 1990 the college expanded and enrollment quadrupled. The number of faculty tripled. During this time, Education became the most popular major, and remains so today.

In 1992 the college established the School of Education and Allied Studies and the School of Arts and Sciences. In 1995 the Moakley Center opened. From 1999 to 2002 the college had an endowment campaign to raise 10 million dollars to support academics.

In 2010 Bridgewater State was one of the Massachusetts state colleges that chose to become a university. This would boost its popularity, attract more contributions, increase student applications and enrollment, and give the school a higher profile. On July 22, 2010, the Massachusetts House of Representatives and Senate voted to give the college university status and change its name to Bridgewater State University. The measure was signed into law by Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick on July 28, 2010.

==Academics==
Bridgewater State University is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education. It is also among America&#x27;s oldest teacher education institutions and the first to have a building devoted to education of teachers.

The university has 108 majors in 35 areas of studies starting with the popular education, aviation, psychology, accounting, criminal justice and many others. The university has 30 academic departments ranging from Accounting and Finance to Theatre and Dance.

===Schools to colleges===
On July 1, 2010, the former School of Arts and Sciences was split into the School of Humanities and Social Sciences and the School of Science and Mathematics. In October 2010, the School of Humanities and Social Sciences, the School of Science and Mathematics, the Ricciardi School of Business and the School of Graduate Studies, were all renamed colleges, and the Department of Social Work was renamed the School of Social Work. The College of Humanities and Social Sciences currently consists of fifteen academic departments, the Bartlett College of Science and Mathematics has six departments, the College of Education and Health Sciences has five departments, and the Ricciardi College of Business has three.

===Honors program===
Pope Hall is the home to the residential Honors first-year living-learning community. Weygand Hall is the home to the residential Honors upperclassman living-learning community

===Research===
The Adrian Tinsley Program (ATP) is the university&#x27;s undergraduate research program.

==Residential life==
Normal schools, because they were state institutions, received no bequests from wealthy alumni. After the Civil War, in 1869, the first college dormitory was constructed, called Normal Hall. This was a coed dormitory that was split half and half. Boys on one side, girls on the other. Students would contribute a specific amount of money for food, and the principal would then purchase supplies at the nearest wholesale. Any surplus amount of money at the end of the year was split up between those who had paid. In the 1890s this procedure was discontinued and a set price for board was established.

In later years, as enrollment grew beginning in 1933, new dormitories were constructed: Woodward Hall and Tillinghast. In the post-war period, more dormitories were built: Pope Hall, Scott Hall, Durgin Hall, and Shea Hall.

==Student life==
===Clubs and organizations===
Bridgewater State University has over 160 clubs and organizations.

Four sororities, three fraternities and one co-educational fraternity are offered at BSU: Alpha Sigma Tau, founded in 2014, Delta Phi Epsilon, founded on December 8, 2010, Gamma Phi Beta, founded November 22, 1987, Phi Sigma Sigma, founded in 1989, Kappa Delta Phi, founded on April 14, 1900, Phi Kappa Theta, founded in 1889, Sigma Pi, and Phi Pi Delta.

Bridgewater State&#x27;s Student Government Association (SGA) is an organization of students who represent the Bridgewater State community. Through SGA, the student body can express their academic and social wants and needs. SGA is made up of five different boards: the policy board, finance board, events board, election board, and media board.

===Student newspaper===
&quot;The Comment&quot; had its start in 1927. At the time &quot;The Comment&quot; served “as bulletin of school affairs and to make each class better acquainted with the activities and interests of other classes.&quot; Today, &quot;The Comment&quot; has about 20 staff writers and prints nine newspapers per semester printing 1100 copies each time. It is funded by the SGA (Student Government Association). &quot;The Comment&quot; has a website that is updated daily with news about the school and sports at Bridgewater State University, but also with current news of the nation. Their main motive is to relate the stories back to Bridgewater students. With that being said, it is a common occurrence to see faces and stories of students in the newspaper. &quot;The Comment&quot; focuses on upcoming events rather than reviews to catch hold of the reader&#x27;s interest.

== Athletics ==
Bridgewater State University fields 22 varsity athletic teams (10 men&#x27;s 12 women&#x27;s) competing at the NCAA Division III level.

==Future expansion==
===West Campus===

The college had planned a $100 million renovation and expansion of the 1964 Marshall Conant Science Building (), but the plans changed, and instead, most of the old building was demolished and replaced with a new facility, which opened in 2011.

Additions to Pope and Scott Halls opened in fall 2009, increasing their capacity by 150 beds each.

Renovations and additions to the Rondileau Campus Center (RCC) began in spring 2013 and were finished by December. The project cost the school more than $3.5 million and included lowering the main entrance on Park Avenue to street level, with the stairs being replaced by ramps for improved accessibility, installation of larger, more energy-efficient windows and doors, and interior upgrades.

In April 2014, construction began on a new Welcome Center on Plymouth Street. The building is a two-story, 15,000-square-foot facility, and it houses the undergraduate and transfer admissions offices, along with the university&#x27;s financial aid offices. Construction of the Welcome Center was completed in the Spring of 2015.

Renovations and additions to Woodward Hall began in June 2014 and finished shortly before the Fall 2014 semester commenced. The renovation included the installation of new floors, ceilings and walls, along with new bedroom furniture and the installation of an elevator &amp; entrance stairs.

===East Campus===

Crimson Hall, a new 400-bed residence hall on the East Campus, opened in the fall of 2007.

The college has constructed a new 600-space parking area, the Tower Lot, behind the Operations Center. The lot where the new residence hall is being built was a 1,000-spot parking lot. The new building has taken 400 of those 1,000. The Tower Lot has been built in an attempt to regain some parking spots lost during the construction.
There has been a discussion of building a fine and performing arts center in the distant future.

A new residence hall, Weygand Hall, was constructed on East Campus in 2013. The building uses geothermal and solar energy to minimize energy usage.

The roughly 200-space parking lot next to the MBTA railroad underpass on East Campus has been converted into a park to balance the construction of a parking garage behind Crimson Hall. Construction on the park was completed in late 2012.

===Cape Cod campus===
In November 2013, the university announced plans to open a satellite campus on Cape Cod. The opening of this satellite campus helped to accommodate the high number of students who commute daily to the main campus from Cape Cod. Approximately 600 Bridgewater State students reside on or commute from Cape Cod to the main campus in Bridgewater. The campus is located in the former MacArthur School in South Yarmouth, Massachusetts. This satellite campus opened in January 2015, offering undergraduate and graduate courses in Early Childhood Education, Educational Leadership, Secondary Education, Reading, and Special Education, along with certificate programs in Business and Social Work. The campus offers a number of undergraduate credit courses in History beginning in Summer 2015.

=== Attleboro campus ===
In January 2009 a small location was opened up in Attleboro, Massachusetts. It is attached to Bristol Community College. Located at 11 Field Road, Attleboro, MA 02703

==Media==
Bridgewater State University has a student-run radio station, 91.5 WBIM-FM.

Bridgewater State University has had its own student-run newspaper since 1927, called &quot;The Comment&quot;.

&quot;The Bridge&quot;, Bridgewater State University&#x27;s student journal of literature and fine art, was established in 2004. The journal has won many national awards, including multiple Gold Crown and Gold Circle awards from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association, and the 2006 and 2011 National Pacemaker Award for collegiate magazines from the Associated Collegiate Press.

<text>WDHT (102.9 FM &quot;Hot 102.9&quot;) is an urban-leaning rhythmic contemporary radio station in Urbana, Ohio serving the Dayton–Springfield area. WDHT is currently owned by Alpha Media, which also owns WING, WROU-FM, WCLI-FM and WGTZ. Its transmitter site on Miller Road in Springfield is shared with that of WULM, as this was previously the transmitting site of the former WBLY/WAZU. Its studios are in Kettering, Ohio.

==History==
=== MOR (1958–1979) ===
Prior to becoming WDHT, the 102.9 frequency was originally licensed to Springfield as WBLY-FM from 1958 to 1979, simulcasting MOR-formatted WBLY.

=== Album rock (1979–1993) ===
In the late 1970s, the station changed their call letters to WAZU under their brand spanking new name &quot;WAZU, The New FM 103 The Zoo...from W to A to Z to U!&quot; The station played AOR and sometimes they also played AC as well. Then in the mid to the late 1980s they renamed their moniker as &quot;Rockradio FM 103 WAZU&quot; and then later as &quot;102.9 WAZU&quot;. On January 15, 1989, the station briefly went dark and when they returned to the airwaves later that day they become a fully fledged AOR format and began calling themselves &quot;102.9 WAZU, The Big Wazoo!&quot; the highly successful AOR format ran until March 19, 1993, by which time the station had evolved into a harder edged AR format.

=== Classic rock (1993–2001) ===
WAZU flipped their format to CR as &quot;Classic Rock 102.9 The All New WAZU, The Big Wazoo!&quot; (In between the flip from Active Rock to Classic Rock, WAZU briefly stunted as &quot;102.9 WZEP-All Led Zeppelin, All The Time&quot;). In 1992, WAZU was sold to Osborn Communications by Robert &quot;Smilin&#x27; Bob&quot; Yountz&#x27;s Champion City Broadcasting, owners of the former WBLY (now WULM), and moved the studios to Dayton. WAZU&#x27;s studios were originally located in its city of license of Springfield. After then owner Great Trails Broadcasting dropped the iconic WAZU calls in May 1995 the WAZU calls moved to 107.1 FM licensed to Circleville, south of Columbus in late 1996. They also used their moniker as &quot;107.1 The New WAZU, The Big Wazoo!&quot; along with their Active Rock format as well as using exactly the same imaging as 102.9 did in early 1993. (That station is now WJYD with an urban gospel format). During their run as an AOR station WAZU competed fiercely with WTUE. The 102.9 frequency changed their calls to WING-FM in May 1995 and continued the Classic Rock format.

=== Rhythmic (2001–present) ===

In 2001, Radio One acquired WING and flipped it to Rhythmic Contemporary on August 3 of that year. The station changed call letters to WDHT on October 24 to match the &quot;Hot&quot; moniker. Two years later, Radio One bought out rival urban station WROU, which was Dayton&#x27;s last locally owned FM radio station, and was converted to Urban Adult Contemporary, a move that allowed WDHT to evolve into a Mainstream Urban direction, even though its presentation is more along the lines of that of a Churban-formatted station (like WPGC-FM/Washington, D.C.).

Under Radio One, WDHT was known for voice-tracking programming and repetition of songs in their playlists, which tends to favor Churban-friendly Rhythmic hits, but since the change in ownership to Main Line in 2007 and later on to its new owner Alpha Media in 2014, it has taken on a more live and local presentation. Also, in the wake of Top 40 sister station WGTZ&#x27;s flip to Adult Hits, it has also taken on a more broader Rhythmic direction than ever, which might be due to the competition it has with rival Top 40 WDKF, whose direction leaned Rhythmic. The station also aired the Russ Parr morning show, which was dropped in August 2014 in favor of &quot;The Breakfast Club.&quot; By September 2009, WDHT was officially moved from the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop panel to the Rhythmic Airplay Panel by Nielsen BDS as it began to incorporate more Rhythmic Pop tracks into its playlist. The move to Rhythmic might have been spurred by WDKF&#x27;s decision to shift away from a local presentation to adopting Clear Channel&#x27;s Premium Choice presentation. That approach, of course, would result in WDKF being dropped from both Mediabase and BDS Top 40 reporting panels in 2009, only to be reinstated in 2013 when it began re-adding air staffers.

In 2006, Radio One announced that sister station WKSW would relocate its frequency from 101.7 to 101.5 and change its city of licence from Urbana to Enon. The move was later approved by the FCC. As part of a trade off, WDHT switched its city of license from Springfield to Urbana in 2010, but the station&#x27;s transmitter remained in Springfield after WKSW&#x27;s move. This move was planned before Radio One sold its Dayton area cluster to Main Line.

On May 17, 2007, Philadelphia-based Main Line Broadcasting announced the acquisition of Radio One&#x27;s stations in the Dayton and Louisville market areas. Main Line took over the Dayton stations on September 14, 2007. In 2014 Main Line would be acquired by Alpha Media, thus becoming the new owners of WDHT and its sister stations in the Dayton cluster.

<text>Blighty was a British pay television channel broadcasting as part of the UKTV network of channels. The channel was originally launched on 8 March 2004.

==History==
The channel launched on 8 March 2004 as UKTV People, showing repeats of lighter factual programming, based on the people of the world with programmes such as &quot;Top Gear&quot; and the docusoap &quot;Airport&quot;. Much of this programming had come from the spinoff for UK Horizons, which had closed down the day before. The channel itself, along with UKTV Documentary, replaced this channel formally. For the channel&#x27;s first few months, it timeshared with UKTV Food +1, airing from 7pm-3am, but soon expanded to a full 24-hour schedule by 1 July.

On 9 October 2008, UKTV announced plans to rebrand UKTV People and UKTV Documentary in early 2009. The news came just two days after UKTV&#x27;s entertainment channels were rebranded to Watch, Gold and Alibi. They announced that UKTV People would be rebranded as Blighty and this rebrand took place on 17 February 2009. As part of the rebrand, some programmes were transferred to channels such as sister channel Dave, while the channel acquired some other programmes looking at British life.

The channel closed at midday on 5 July 2013, replaced by Drama (now U&amp;Drama) on 8 July.

==Timeshift==
On 12 January 2005, UKTV launched a time shift service called UKTV People +1 It was exclusively available on Sky Digital, and ran exactly the same broadcast on a one-hour delay. It also ran for the same hours as its main channel, except an hour ahead.

For unknown reasons, the service closed on 18 April 2006, and was removed from the Sky EPG afterwards. Its bandwidth would be reused for UKTV Drama +1 which launched two weeks later on 2 May, however unlike UKTV People +1, UKTV Drama +1 initially aired as a part-time service.

==Identity==
When the channel launched as UKTV People, the idents all featured people depicted from different angles set against a screen split in four, before fading into the stacked UKTV People logo. Later in 2007, the idents features a live-action footage where the people are working or having activities (e.g. building site, shopping centre) before a red part moving into the stacked UKTV People logo over a three striped red background. This same background also featured on promotions for the channel, both on the channel and across the network.

When the rebrand to Blighty occurred, a new logo was designed consisting of a brightly coloured Union Flag. This is seen on a large scale flying behind the scenes depicted in front. These scenes included many people and centred on a number of typically British themes: rain, with large wellies, business men with umbrellas and people camping; sun with beach scenes, and other summer activities; tea, with all methods of making tea celebrated alongside cakes and biscuits and multicultural, featuring foreign dances and Indian food and spices.

==Programming==
Much of the channels programming focused on repeated programming, mainly but not exclusively from the BBC, who held a 50 percent stake in the channel through commercial arm BBC Worldwide. Additionally, BBC programmes were edited to fit the time slot as an original broadcast for an hour-long programme on the BBC might be as much as 58 minutes long, whereas the same programme on Blighty might be 42 minutes long without the commercials.

<doc id="721807" wikidata="Q329891" url="?curid=721807" title="Nuclear program of Iran">
<text>Iran has research sites, two uranium mines, a research reactor, and uranium processing facilities that include three known uranium enrichment plants.

Commencing in the 1950s with support from the US under the Atoms for Peace program, Iran&#x27;s nuclear program was geared toward peaceful scientific exploration. In 1970, Iran ratified the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), subjecting its nuclear activities to IAEA inspections. After the 1979 Iranian Revolution, cooperation ceased and Iran pursued its nuclear program clandestinely.

An investigation by the IAEA was launched as declarations by the National Council of Resistance of Iran in 2002 revealed undeclared Iranian nuclear activities. In 2006, Iran&#x27;s noncompliance with its NPT obligations moved the United Nations Security Council to demand Iran suspend its programs. In 2007, the US National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) stated Iran halted an alleged active nuclear weapons program in 2003. In November 2011, the IAEA reported credible evidence that Iran had been conducting experiments aimed at designing a nuclear bomb, and that research may have continued on a smaller scale after that time. On 1 May 2018 the IAEA reiterated its 2015 report, saying it had found no credible evidence of nuclear weapons activity after 2009.

Operational since September 2011, the Bushehr I reactor marked Iran&#x27;s entry into nuclear power with Russia&#x27;s assistance. This became an important milestone for Rosatom to become the largest player in the world nuclear power market. Anticipated to reach full capacity by the end of 2012, Iran had also begun constructing a new 300 MW Darkhovin Nuclear Power Plant and expressed plans for additional medium-sized nuclear power plants and uranium mines in the future.

Despite the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) aimed at addressing Iran&#x27;s nuclear concerns, the U.S. withdrawal in 2018 prompted renewed sanctions, impacting diplomatic relations. The IAEA certified Iran&#x27;s compliance up until 2019, but subsequent breaches strained the agreement. In a 2020 IAEA report, Iran was said to have breached the JCPOA and faced criticism from signatories. In 2021, Iran faced scrutiny regarding its assertion the program was exclusively for peaceful purposes, especially with references to growth in satellites, missiles, and nuclear weapons. In 2022, Atomic Energy Organization of Iran head Mohammad Eslami announced a strategic plan for 10 GWe of nuclear electricity generation. In October 2023, an IAEA report estimated Iran had increased its uranium stockpile 22 times over the 2015 agreed JCPOA limit. In the last months of the Biden Administration, new intelligence persuaded US officials that Iran was exploring a cruder design for a nuclear weapon that could enable Iran to manufacture a usable nuclear weapon in a matter of months.

==History==
===1950s - 1960s===
Iran&#x27;s nuclear program was launched in the 1950s with the help of the United States. On 5 March 1957, a &quot;proposed agreement for cooperation in research in the peaceful uses of atomic energy&quot; was announced under the Eisenhower administration&#x27;s Atoms for Peace program.

In 1967, the Tehran Nuclear Research Center (TNRC) was established, run by the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI). The TNRC was equipped with a 5-megawatt nuclear research reactor supplied by US company American Machine and Foundry, which was fueled by highly enriched uranium.

Iran signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1968 and ratified it in 1970, making Iran&#x27;s nuclear program subject to IAEA verification.

A Central Treaty Organization nuclear sciences institute was moved from Baghdad to Tehran after Iraq left CENTO.

The participation of the United States and Western European governments in Iran&#x27;s nuclear program continued until the 1979 Iranian Revolution that toppled the last Shah of Iran. Following the Revolution, most of the international nuclear cooperation with Iran was cut off. In 1981, Iranian officials concluded that the country&#x27;s nuclear development should continue. Negotiations took place with France in the late 1980s and with Argentina in the early 1990s, and agreements were reached. In the 1990s, Russia formed a joint research organization with Iran, providing Iran with Russian nuclear experts and technical information.

===1970s===
The Shah approved plans to construct up to 23 nuclear power stations by 2000.
In March 1974, the Shah envisioned a time when the world&#x27;s oil supply would run out, and declared, &quot;Petroleum is a noble material, much too valuable to burn ... We envision producing, as soon as possible, 23,000 megawatts of electricity using nuclear plants.&quot;
US and European companies scrambled to do business in Iran. Bushehr, the first plant, would supply energy to the city of Shiraz. In 1975, the German firm Kraftwerk Union AG, a joint venture of Siemens AG and AEG, signed a contract worth $4 to to build the pressurized water reactor plant. Construction of the two 1,196 MWe reactora was to have been completed in 1981.

In 1975, Sweden&#x27;s 10 percent share in Eurodif went to Iran. The French government subsidiary company Cogéma and the Iranian Government established the Sofidif (&quot;Société franco–iranienne pour l&#x27;enrichissement de l&#x27;uranium par diffusion gazeuse&quot;) enterprise with 60 and 40 percent shares, respectively. In turn, Sofidif acquired a 25 percent share in Eurodif, which gave Iran its 10 percent share of Eurodif. The Shah lent dollars (and another dollars in 1977) for the construction of the Eurodif factory, to have the right of buying 10 percent of the production of the site.

In 1976, US President Gerald Ford signed a directive offering Iran the chance to buy and operate a US-built reprocessing facility for extracting plutonium from reactor fuel.
The Ford strategy paper said the &quot;introduction of nuclear power will both provide for the growing needs of Iran&#x27;s economy and free remaining oil reserves for export or conversion to petrochemicals.&quot;

A 1974 CIA proliferation assessment stated &quot;If [the Shah] is alive in the mid-1980s ... and if other countries [particularly India] have proceeded with weapons development we have no doubt Iran will follow suit.&quot;

===Post-revolution, 1979–1989===
Following the 1979 Revolution, most of the international nuclear cooperation with Iran was cut off. Kraftwerk Union stopped work at the Bushehr project in January 1979, with one reactor 50 percent complete, and the other reactor 85 percent complete, and fully withdrew from the project in July 1979. The company said they based their action on Iran&#x27;s non-payment of in overdue payments, while other sources claim it was due to American pressure. The United States also cut off the supply of highly enriched fuel for the Tehran Nuclear Research Center, forcing it to shut down for a number of years. Eurodif also stopped supplying enriched uranium to Iran. Iran later argued that these experiences indicate foreign facilities and fuel supplies are an unreliable source of nuclear fuel supply.

In 1981, Iranian governmental officials concluded that the country&#x27;s nuclear development should continue. Reports to the IAEA included that a site at Esfahan Nuclear Technology Center (ENTEC) would act &quot;as the center for the transfer and development of nuclear technology, as well as contribute to the formation of local expertise and manpower needed to sustain a very ambitious program in the field of nuclear power reactor technology and fuel cycle technology.&quot; The IAEA also was informed about Entec&#x27;s materials department, which was responsible for fabricating UO2 pellet fabrication, and chemical department, whose goal was the conversion of U3O8 to nuclear grade .

In 1983, IAEA officials assisted Iran in chemical aspects of fuel fabrication, chemical engineering, and design aspects of pilot plants for uranium conversion, corrosion of nuclear materials, LWR fuel fabrication, and pilot plant development for production of nuclear grade . However, the US government &quot;directly intervened&quot; to discourage IAEA assistance in  and UF6 production. A former US official said &quot;we stopped that in its tracks.&quot; Iran later set up a bilateral cooperation on fuel cycle related issues with China, but China also agreed to drop most outstanding nuclear commerce with Iran, including the construction of the plant, due to US pressure.

In April 1984, the BND leaked a report that Iran might have a nuclear bomb within two years with Pakistani uranium; this was the first public Western intelligence report of a post-revolutionary nuclear weapons program in Iran. Later that year, Minority Whip of the US Senate Alan Cranston asserted that Iran was seven years away from being able to build its own nuclear weapon.

During the Iran–Iraq War, the two Bushehr reactors were damaged by multiple Iraqi air strikes and work on the nuclear program came to a standstill. Iran notified the International Atomic Energy Agency of the blasts, and complained about international inaction and the use of French-made missiles in the attack. In late 2015, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani revealed that Iran considered pursuing weapons of mass destruction during the war against Iraq (Specifically for the scenario where Saddam Hussein would have operationalized nuclear weapons during the Iran-Iraq War : &quot;When we first began, we were at war and we sought to have that possibility for the day that the enemy might use a nuclear weapon. That was the thinking. But it never became real,&quot; Rafsanjani said in the interview, which was carried by state news agency IRNA).

In 1985, Iran began to pressure France in order to recover its debt from the Eurodif investment and to get the enriched uranium delivered. French hostages were taken in Lebanon from spring 1985; in 1986, terror attacks were perpetrated in Paris and Eurodif manager Georges Besse was assassinated. In their investigation &quot;La République atomique, France-Iran le pacte nucléaire&quot;, David Carr-Brown and Dominique Lorentz pointed to the Iranian intelligence services&#x27; responsibility. It was later ascertained, however, that the assassination was committed by the left-wing terror group Action directe. On 6 May 1988, French premier Jacques Chirac signed an accord with Iran: France agreed to accept Iran as a shareholder of Eurodif and to deliver enriched uranium &quot;without restrictions&quot;.

In 1987–88, Argentina&#x27;s National Atomic Energy Commission signed an agreement with Iran to help in converting the reactor from HEU fuel to 19.75 percent low-enriched uranium, and to supply the latter fuel to Iran. According to a 2006 Argentine report, during the late 1980s and early 1990s the US pressured Argentina to terminate its nuclear cooperation with Iran, and from early 1992 to 1994 negotiations between Argentina and Iran took place with the aim of re-establishing the three agreements made in 1987–88. Some have linked attacks such as the 1992 attack on Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires and the AMIA bombing as part of an Iranian campaign to pressure Argentina into honoring the agreements. The uranium was delivered in 1993.

===1990–2002===
From the early 1990s, Russia formed a joint research organization with Iran called &quot;Persepolis&quot; that provided Iran with Russian nuclear experts, as well as technical information. Five Russian institutions, including Roscosmos, helped Tehran improve its missiles. The exchange of technical information with Iran was personally approved by SVR director Trubnikov. President Boris Yeltsin had a &quot;two track policy&quot; offering commercial nuclear technology to Iran and discussing the issues with Washington.

In 1991, France refunded more than $1.6 billion, while Iran remained a shareholder of Eurodif via Sofidif. However, Iran refrained from asking for the produced uranium.

In 1992, Iran invited IAEA inspectors to visit all the sites and facilities they asked. Director General Blix reported that all activities observed were consistent with the peaceful use of atomic energy. The IAEA visits included undeclared facilities and Iran&#x27;s nascent uranium mining project at Saghand. In the same year, Argentine officials disclosed (under pressure from the US) that their country had canceled a sale to Iran of civilian nuclear equipment worth $18 million.

In 1995, Iran signed a contract with Rosatom to resume work on the partially complete Bushehr plant, installing into the existing Bushehr I building a 915 MWe VVER-1000 pressurized water reactor.

In 1996, the US convinced China to pull out of a contract to construct a uranium conversion plant. However, the Chinese provided blueprints for the facility to the Iranians, who advised the IAEA that they would continue work on the program; IAEA Director Mohamed ElBaradei even visited the construction site.

===Overview of 2002–2012===
In 2002, the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) exposed the existence of an undisclosed uranium enrichment facility in Natanz, leading to emerging concerns about Iran&#x27;s nuclear program. In 2003, after the Iranian government formally acknowledged the facilities, the Atomic Energy Agency inspected them, finding that they had a more advanced nuclear program than had previously been anticipated by U.S. intelligence.
That same year, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) first reported that Iran had not declared sensitive enrichment and reprocessing activities. Enrichment can be used to produce uranium for reactor fuel or (at higher enrichment levels) for weapons. Iran says its nuclear program is peaceful, and had then enriched uranium to less than 5 percent, consistent with fuel for a civilian nuclear power plant. Iran also claimed that it was forced to resort to secrecy after US pressure caused several of its nuclear contracts with foreign governments to fall through. After the IAEA Board of Governors reported Iran&#x27;s noncompliance with its safeguards agreement to the UN Security Council, the Council demanded that Iran suspend its nuclear enrichment activities while Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has argued that the sanctions are &quot;illegal,&quot; imposed by &quot;arrogant powers,&quot; and that Iran has decided to pursue the monitoring of its self-described peaceful nuclear program through &quot;its appropriate legal path,&quot; the International Atomic Energy Agency. The initial discovery of the enrichment facility in Natanz, as well as Iran&#x27;s refusal to fully cooperate with the IAEA, heightened tensions between Iran and Western powers.
After public allegations about Iran&#x27;s previously undeclared nuclear activities, the IAEA launched an investigation that concluded in November 2003 that Iran had systematically failed to meet its obligations under its NPT safeguards agreement to report those activities to the IAEA, although it also reported no evidence of links to a nuclear weapons program. The IAEA Board of Governors delayed a formal finding of non-compliance until September 2005, and reported that non-compliance to the Security Council in February 2006. After the Board of Governors reported Iran&#x27;s noncompliance with its safeguards agreement to the Security Council, the Council demanded that Iran suspend its enrichment programs. The Council imposed sanctions after Iran refused to do so. A May 2009 US Congressional Report suggested &quot;the United States, and later the Europeans, argued that Iran&#x27;s deception meant it should forfeit its right to enrich, a position likely to be up for negotiation in talks with Iran.&quot;

In exchange for suspending its enrichment program, Iran was offered &quot;a long-term comprehensive arrangement which would allow for the development of relations and cooperation with Iran based on mutual respect and the establishment of international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran&#x27;s nuclear program.&quot; However, Iran has consistently refused to give up its enrichment program, arguing that the program is necessary for its energy security, that such &quot;long term arrangements&quot; are inherently unreliable, and would deprive it of its inalienable right to peaceful nuclear technology. In June 2009, in the immediate wake of the disputed Iranian presidential election, Iran initially agreed to a deal to relinquish its stockpile of low-enriched uranium in return for fuel for a medical research reactor, but then backed out of the deal. Currently, thirteen states possess operational enrichment or reprocessing facilities, and several others have expressed an interest in developing indigenous enrichment programs.

To address concerns that its enrichment program may be diverted to non-peaceful uses, Iran offered to place additional restrictions on its enrichment program including, for example, ratifying the Additional Protocol to allow more stringent inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, operating the uranium enrichment facility at Natanz as a multinational fuel center with the participation of foreign representatives, renouncing plutonium reprocessing, and immediately fabricating all enriched uranium into fuel rods. Iran&#x27;s offer to open its uranium enrichment program to foreign private and public participation mirrors suggestions of an IAEA expert committee which was formed to investigate the methods to reduce the risk that sensitive fuel cycle activities could contribute to national nuclear weapons capabilities. Some non-governmental US experts have endorsed this approach. 

In every other case in which the IAEA Board of Governors made a finding of safeguards non-compliance involving clandestine enrichment or reprocessing, the resolution has involved (in the cases of Iraq and Libya) or is expected to involve (in the case of North Korea) at a minimum ending sensitive fuel cycle activities. According to Pierre Goldschmidt, former deputy director general and head of the department of safeguards at the IAEA, and Henry D. Sokolski, executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, some other instances of safeguards noncompliance reported by the IAEA Secretariat (South Korea, Egypt) were never reported to the Security Council because the IAEA Board of Governors never made a formal finding of non-compliance. Though South Korea&#x27;s case involved enriching uranium to levels near weapons grade, the country itself voluntarily reported the isolated activity and Goldschmidt has argued &quot;political considerations also played a dominant role in the board&#x27;s decision&quot; to not make a formal finding of non-compliance.

A 23 March 2012 US Congressional Research Service report quotes a 24 February IAEA report saying that Iran had stockpiled 240 pounds of 20-per-cent-enriched uranium as an indication of their capacity to enrich to higher levels. The authoritarian politics of Iran may pose additional challenges to a scientific program requiring cooperation among many technical specialists. Some experts argue that the intense focus on Iran&#x27;s nuclear program detracts from a need for broader diplomatic engagement. US intelligence officials interviewed by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in March 2012 said they continued to assess that Iran had not restarted its weaponization program, which the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate said Iran had discontinued in 2003, although they have found evidence that some weaponization-related activities have continued. The Israeli Mossad reportedly shared this belief.

===2002–2006===
On 14 August 2002, Alireza Jafarzadeh, a spokesman for the National Council of Resistance of Iran, publicly revealed the existence of two nuclear sites under construction: a uranium enrichment facility in Natanz (part of which is underground), and a heavy water facility in Arak. It has been strongly suggested that intelligence agencies already knew about these facilities but the reports had been classified.

The IAEA immediately sought access to these facilities and further information and co-operation from Iran regarding its nuclear program. According to arrangements in force at the time for implementation of Iran&#x27;s safeguards agreement with the IAEA, Iran was not required to allow IAEA inspections of a new nuclear facility until six months before nuclear material is introduced into that facility. At the time, Iran was not even required to inform the IAEA of the existence of the facility. This &quot;six months&quot; clause was standard for implementation of all IAEA safeguards agreements until 1992, when the IAEA Board of Governors decided that facilities should be reported during the planning phase, even before construction began. Iran was the last country to accept that decision, and only did so on 26 February 2003, after the IAEA investigation began.

In May 2003, shortly after the US invasion of Iraq, elements of the government of Mohammad Khatami made a confidential proposal for a &quot;Grand Bargain&quot; through Swiss diplomatic channels. It offered full transparency of Iran&#x27;s nuclear program and withdrawal of support for Hamas and Hezbollah, in exchange for security assurances from the United States and a normalization of diplomatic relations. The Bush administration did not respond to the proposal, as senior US officials doubted its authenticity. The proposal reportedly was widely blessed by the Iranian government, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.

France, Germany and the United Kingdom (the EU-3) undertook a diplomatic initiative with Iran to resolve questions about its nuclear program. On 21 October 2003, in Tehran, the Iranian government and EU-3 Foreign Ministers issued a statement known as the Tehran Declaration in which Iran agreed to co-operate with the IAEA, to sign and implement an Additional Protocol as a voluntary, confidence-building measure, and to suspend its enrichment and reprocessing activities during the course of the negotiations. The EU-3 in return explicitly agreed to recognize Iran&#x27;s nuclear rights and to discuss ways Iran could provide &quot;satisfactory assurances&quot; regarding its nuclear power program, after which Iran would gain easier access to modern technology. Iran signed an Additional Protocol on 18 December 2003, and agreed to act as if the protocol were in force, making the required reports to the IAEA and allowing the required access by IAEA inspectors, pending Iran&#x27;s ratification of the Additional Protocol.

The IAEA reported 10 November 2003,&lt;ref name=&quot;IAEA-GOV/2003/75&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; that &quot;it is clear that Iran has failed in a number of instances over an extended period of time to meet its obligations under its Safeguards Agreement with respect to the reporting of nuclear material and its processing and use, as well as the declaration of facilities where such material has been processed and stored.&quot; Iran was obligated to inform the IAEA of its importation of uranium from China and subsequent use of that material in uranium conversion and enrichment activities. It was also obligated to report experiments with the separation of plutonium. However, the Islamic Republic reneged on its promise to permit the IAEA to carry out their inspections and suspended the Additional Protocol agreement outlined above in October 2005.
A comprehensive list of Iran&#x27;s specific &quot;breaches&quot; of its safeguards agreement, which the IAEA described as part of a &quot;pattern of concealment,&quot; can be found in a 15 November 2004 report of the IAEA on Iran&#x27;s nuclear program. Iran attributed its failure to report certain acquisitions and activities to US obstructionism, which reportedly included pressuring the IAEA to cease providing technical assistance to Iran&#x27;s uranium conversion program in 1983. On the question of whether Iran had a hidden nuclear weapons program, the IAEA&#x27;s November 2003 report states that it found &quot;no evidence&quot; that the previously undeclared activities were related to a nuclear weapons program, but also that it was unable to conclude that Iran&#x27;s nuclear program was exclusively peaceful.

In June 2004, construction began on IR-40, a 40 MW heavy water reactor.

Under the terms of the Paris Agreement, on 14 November 2004, Iran&#x27;s chief nuclear negotiator announced a voluntary and temporary suspension of its uranium enrichment program (enrichment is not a violation of the NPT) and the voluntary implementation of the Additional Protocol, after pressure from the United Kingdom, France, and Germany on behalf of the European Union. The measure was said at the time to be a voluntary confidence-building measure, to continue for some reasonable period of time (six months being mentioned as a reference) as negotiations with the EU-3 continued. On 24 November, Iran sought to amend the terms of its agreement with the EU to exclude a handful of the equipment from this deal for research work. This request was dropped four days later. According to Seyed Hossein Mousavian, one of the Iranian representatives to the Paris Agreement negotiations, the Iranians made it clear to their European counterparts that Iran would not consider a permanent end to uranium enrichment:

In February 2005, Iran pressed the EU-3 to speed up talks, which the EU-3 refused to do. The talks made little progress because of the divergent positions of the two sides. Under pressure from US, European negotiators could not agree to allow enrichment on Iranian soil. Although Iranians presented an offer, which included voluntary restrictions on the enrichment volume and output, it was rejected. The EU-3 broke a commitment they had made to recognize Iran&#x27;s right under NPT to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.

In early August 2005, after the June election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president, Iran removed seals on its uranium enrichment equipment in Isfahan, which UK officials termed a &quot;breach of the Paris Agreement&quot; though a case can be made that the EU violated the terms of the Paris Agreement by demanding that Iran abandon nuclear enrichment. Several days later, the EU-3 offered Iran a package in return for permanent cessation of enrichment. Reportedly, it included benefits in the political, trade and nuclear fields, as well as long-term supplies of nuclear materials and assurances of non-aggression by the EU (but not the US). Deputy head of AEOI Mohammad Saeedi rejected the offer as &quot;very insulting and humiliating&quot; and independent analysts characterized it as an &quot;empty box&quot;. Iran&#x27;s announcement that it would resume enrichment preceded the election of Ahmadinejad by several months. The delay in restarting the program was to allow the IAEA to re-install monitoring equipment. The actual resumption of the program coincided with the election of Ahmadinejad, and the appointment of Ali Larijani as chief nuclear negotiator.

Around 2005, Germany refused to continue exporting nuclear equipment or refund money Iran had paid for such equipment in the 1980s.

In August 2005, with Pakistani assistance, a group of US government experts and international scientists concluded that traces of bomb-grade uranium found in Iran came from contaminated Pakistani equipment and were not evidence of a clandestine weapons program in Iran. In September 2005, IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei reported that &quot;most&quot; highly enriched uranium traces found in Iran by agency inspectors came from imported centrifuge components, validating Iran&#x27;s claim that the traces were due to contamination. Sources in Vienna and the State Department reportedly stated that, for all practical purposes, the HEU issue had been resolved.

In a speech to the United Nations on 17 September 2005, Ahmadinejad suggested that Iran&#x27;s enrichment might be managed by an international consortium, with Iran sharing ownership with other countries. The offer was rejected out of hand by the EU and the US.

The IAEA Board of Governors deferred a formal decision on Iran&#x27;s nuclear case for two years after 2003, while Iran continued cooperation with the EU-3. On 24 September 2005, after Iran abandoned the Paris Agreement, the Board found that Iran had been in non-compliance with its safeguards agreement, based largely on facts that had been reported as early as November 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAEA-GOV/2005/77&quot; &gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 February 2006, the 35-member Board voted 27–3 (with five abstentions: Algeria, Belarus, Indonesia, Libya, and South Africa) to report Iran to the UN Security Council. The measure was sponsored by the EU-3 and backed by the US. Two permanent Council members, Russia and China, agreed to referral only on condition that the Council take no action until March. The three members voting against referral were Venezuela, Syria, and Cuba. In response, on 6 February 2006, Iran suspended its voluntary implementation of the Additional Protocol and all other voluntary and non-binding cooperation with the IAEA beyond that required by its safeguards agreement.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAEA-GOV/2006/15&quot; &gt;GOV/2006/15 Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement in the Islamic Republic of Iran, 27 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In late February 2006, IAEA Director ElBaradei proposed a deal whereby Iran would give up industrial-scale enrichment and limit its program to a small-scale pilot facility, and agree to import its nuclear fuel from Russia (see nuclear fuel bank). The Iranians indicated that while they would not be willing to give up their right to enrichment in principle, they were willing to consider a compromise. However, in March 2006, the Bush administration made it clear that they would not accept any enrichment at all in Iran.

The IAEA Board of Governors deferred the formal report to the Security Council of Iran&#x27;s non-compliance (required by Article XII.C of the IAEA Statute) until 27 February 2006. The Board usually makes decisions by consensus, but in a rare decision it adopted the resolution by vote, with 12 abstentions.

On 11 April 2006, Ahmadinejad announced that Iran had successfully enriched uranium in a televised address from the northeastern city of Mashhad, where he said &quot;I am officially announcing that Iran joined the group of those countries which have nuclear technology.&quot; The uranium was enriched to 3.5 percent using over a hundred centrifuges.

On 13 April 2006, after US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the previous day that the Security Council must consider &quot;strong steps&quot; to induce Tehran to change course in its nuclear ambitions, Ahmadinejad vowed that Iran would not back away from uranium enrichment and that the world must treat Iran as a nuclear power, saying &quot;Our answer to those who are angry about Iran achieving the full nuclear fuel cycle is just one phrase. We say: Be angry at us and die of this anger,&quot; because &quot;We won&#x27;t hold talks with anyone about the right of the Iranian nation to enrich uranium.&quot;

On 14 April 2006, the Institute for Science and International Security published a series of analyzed satellite images of Iran&#x27;s nuclear facilities at Natanz and Esfahan. Featured in these images is a new tunnel entrance near the Uranium Conversion Facility at Esfahan and continued construction at the Natanz uranium enrichment site. In addition, a series of images dating back to 2002 shows the underground enrichment buildings and its subsequent covering by soil, concrete, and other materials. Both facilities were already subject to IAEA inspections and safeguards.

On 28 July 2006, the UN Security Council approved a resolution to give Iran until the end of August to suspend uranium enrichment or face the threat of sanctions.

Iran responded to the demand to stop enrichment of uranium 24 August 2006, offering to return to the negotiation table but refusing to end enrichment.

Majlis speaker Qolam Ali Hadad-adel said on 30 August 2006, that Iran had the right to &quot;peaceful application of nuclear technology and all other officials agree with this decision,&quot; according to the semi-official Iranian Students News Agency. &quot;Iran opened the door to negotiations for Europe and hopes that the answer which was given to the nuclear package would bring them to the table.&quot;

In Resolution 1696 of 31 July 2006, the Security Council demanded that Iran suspend all enrichment and reprocessing related activities.

In Resolution 1737 of 26 December 2006, the Council imposed a series of sanctions on Iran for its non-compliance with Resolution 1696. These sanctions were primarily targeted against the transfer of nuclear and ballistic missile technologies and, in response to concerns of China and Russia, were lighter than that sought by the United States. This resolution followed a report from the IAEA that Iran had permitted inspections under its safeguards agreement but had not suspended its enrichment-related activities.

===UN Security Council===

The UN Security Council has passed eight resolutions on Iran&#x27;s nuclear program:
* Resolution 1696 (31 July 2006) demanded that Iran suspend its uranium enrichment activities,
* Resolution 1737 (23 December 2006) imposed sanctions after Iran refused to suspend its enrichment activities, required Iran to cooperate with IAEA,
* Resolution 1747 (24 March 2007) expanded the list of sanctioned Iranian entities,
* Resolution 1803 (3 March 2008) extended those sanctions to additional persons and entities,
* Resolution 1835 (27 September 2008) reaffirmed the preceding four resolutions,
* Resolution 1929 (9 June 2010) imposed a complete arms embargo on Iran, banned Iran from any activities related to ballistic missiles, authorized the inspection and seizure of shipments violating these restrictions, extended the asset freeze to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL), and established a Panel of Experts (whose mandate was extended three times by Resolution 1984 (8 June 2011), Resolution 2049 (7 June 2012), and Resolution 2105 (5 June 2013)).

===IAEA reports, 2007–2015===
The IAEA has consistently stated it is unable to conclude that Iran&#x27;s nuclear program is entirely peaceful. Such a conclusion would normally be drawn only for countries that have an Additional Protocol in force. Iran ceased its implementation of the Additional Protocol in 2006, and also ceased all other cooperation with the IAEA beyond what Iran acknowledged it was required to provide under its safeguards agreement, after the IAEA Board of Governors decided, in February 2006, to report Iran&#x27;s safeguards non-compliance to the Security Council. The Council, invoking Chapter VII of the UN Charter, then passed Resolution 1737, which obligated Iran to implement the Additional Protocol. Iran responded that its nuclear activities were peaceful and that Security Council involvement was malicious and unlawful. In August 2007, Iran and the IAEA entered into an agreement on the modalities for resolving remaining outstanding issues, and made progress in outstanding issues except for the question of &quot;alleged studies&quot; of weaponization by Iran.&lt;ref name=&quot;GOV/2008/59&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Iran said it did not address the alleged studies in the IAEA work plan because they were not included in the plan. The IAEA did not detect the actual use of nuclear material in connection with the alleged studies and said it regrets it was unable to provide Iran with copies of the documentation concerning the alleged studies, but said the documentation was comprehensive and detailed, and therefore needed to be taken seriously. Iran said the allegations are based on &quot;forged&quot; documents and &quot;fabricated&quot; data, and that had not received copies of the documentation to enable it to prove that they were forged and fabricated.

In 2011, the IAEA began to voice growing concern over possible military dimensions to Iran&#x27;s nuclear program, and has released a number of reports chastising Iran&#x27;s nuclear program to that effect.

In February 2007, anonymous diplomats at the IAEA reportedly complained that most US intelligence shared with the IAEA had proved inaccurate, and none had led to significant discoveries inside Iran.

On 10 May 2007, Iran and the IAEA vehemently denied reports that Iran had blocked IAEA inspectors when they sought access to Iran&#x27;s enrichment facility. On 11 March 2007, Reuters quoted IAEA spokesman Marc Vidricaire, &quot;We have not been denied access at any time, including in the past few weeks. Normally we do not comment on such reports but this time we felt we had to clarify the matter ... If we had a problem like that we would have to report to the [35-nation IAEA governing] board ... That has not happened because this alleged event did not take place.&quot;

On 30 July 2007, IAEA inspectors spent five hours at the Arak complex, the first such visit since April. Visits to other plants in Iran were expected during the following days. It has been suggested that access may have been granted in an attempt to head off further sanctions.

====August 2007 Report and Agreement between Iran and the IAEA====
An IAEA report to the Board of Governors on 30 August 2007 stated that Iran&#x27;s Fuel Enrichment Plant at Natanz was operating &quot;well below the expected quantity for a facility of this design,&quot; and that 12 of the intended 18 centrifuge cascades at the plant were operating. The report stated that the IAEA had &quot;been able to verify the non-diversion of the declared nuclear materials at the enrichment facilities in Iran,&quot; and that longstanding issues regarding plutonium experiments and HEU contamination on spent fuel containers were considered &quot;resolved.&quot; However, the report added that the Agency remained unable to verify certain aspects relevant to the scope and nature of Iran&#x27;s nuclear program.

The report also outlined a workplan agreed by Iran and the IAEA on 21 August 2007. The workplan reflected agreement on &quot;modalities for resolving the remaining safeguards implementation issues, including the long outstanding issues.&quot; According to the plan, these modalities covered all remaining issues regarding Iran&#x27;s past nuclear program and activities. The IAEA report described the workplan as &quot;a significant step forward,&quot; but added &quot;the Agency considers it essential that Iran adheres to the time line defined therein and implements all the necessary safeguards and transparency measures, including the measures provided for in the Additional Protocol.&quot; Although the workplan did not include a commitment by Iran to implement the Additional Protocol, IAEA safeguards head Olli Heinonen observed that measures in the workplan &quot;for resolving our outstanding issues go beyond the requirements of the Additional Protocol.&quot;

According to Reuters, the report was likely to blunt Washington&#x27;s push for more severe sanctions against Iran. One senior UN official familiar said US efforts to escalate sanctions against Iran would provoke a nationalistic backlash by Iran that would set back the IAEA investigation in Iran. In late October 2007, chief IAEA inspector Olli Heinonen described Iranian cooperation with the IAEA as &quot;good,&quot; although much remained to be done.

In late October 2007, according to the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;, the head of the IAEA, Mohamed ElBaradei, stated that he had seen &quot;no evidence&quot; of Iran developing nuclear weapons. The IHT quoted ElBaradei as saying &quot;We have information that there has been maybe some studies about possible weaponization. That&#x27;s why we have said that we cannot give Iran a pass right now, because there is still a lot of question marks. ... But have we seen Iran having the nuclear material that can readily be used into a weapon? No. Have we seen an active weaponization program? No.&quot; The IHT report went on to say that &quot;ElBaradei said he was worried about the growing rhetoric from the U.S., which he noted focused on Iran&#x27;s alleged intentions to build a nuclear weapon rather than evidence the country was actively doing so. If there is actual evidence, ElBaradei said he would welcome seeing it.&quot;

====November 2007 report====
A IAEA report of 15 November 2007 found that on nine outstanding issues listed in the August 2007 workplan, including experiments on the P-2 centrifuge and work with uranium metals, &quot;Iran&#x27;s statements are consistent with ... information available to the agency,&quot; but it warned that its knowledge of Tehran&#x27;s present atomic work was shrinking due to Iran&#x27;s refusal to continue voluntarily implementing the Additional Protocol, as it had done in the past under the October 2003 Tehran agreement and the November 2004 Paris agreement. The only remaining issues were traces of HEU found at one location, and allegations by US intelligence agencies based on a laptop computer allegedly stolen from Iran which reportedly contained nuclear weapons-related designs. The IAEA report also stated that Tehran continues to produce LEU. Iran has declared it has a right to peaceful nuclear technology under the NPT, despite Security Council demands that it cease its nuclear enrichment.

On 18 November 2007, Ahmadinejad announced that he intended to consult with Arab nations on a plan, under the auspices of the Gulf Cooperation Council, to enrich uranium in a neutral third country, such as Switzerland.

Israel criticized IAEA reports on Iran as well as the former IAEA-director ElBaradei. Israel&#x27;s Minister of Strategic Affairs Avigdor Lieberman dismissed the IAEA reports as being &quot;unacceptable&quot; and accused IAEA head ElBaradei of being &quot;pro-Iranian.&quot;

====February 2008 report====
On 11 February 2008, news reports stated that the IAEA report on Iran&#x27;s compliance with the August 2007 workplan would be delayed over internal disagreements over the report&#x27;s expected conclusions that the major issues had been resolved. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner stated that he would meet with ElBaradei to convince him to &quot;listen to the West&quot; and remind him that the IAEA is merely in charge of the &quot;technical side&quot; rather than the &quot;political side&quot; of the issue. A senior IAEA official denied the reports of internal disagreements and accused Western powers of using the same &quot;hype&quot; tactics employed against Iraq before the 2003 US-led invasion to justify imposing further sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program.

On 22 February 2008, the IAEA issued its report on the implementation of safeguards in Iran. ElBaradei stated that &quot;We have managed to clarify all the remaining outstanding issues, including the most important issue, which is the scope and nature of Iran&#x27;s enrichment programme&quot; with the exception of a single issue, &quot;and that is the alleged weaponization studies that supposedly Iran has conducted in the past.&quot;

According to the report, the IAEA shared intelligence with Iran recently provided by the US regarding &quot;alleged studies&quot; on a nuclear weaponization program. The information was allegedly obtained from a laptop computer smuggled out of Iran and provided to the US in mid-2004. The laptop was reportedly received from a &quot;longtime contact&quot; in Iran who obtained it from someone else now believed to be dead. A senior European diplomat warned &quot;I can fabricate that data,&quot; and argued that the documents look &quot;beautiful, but is open to doubt.&quot; The United States has relied on the laptop to prove that Iran intends to develop nuclear weapons. In November 2007, the United States National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) believed that Iran halted an alleged active nuclear weapons program in 2003. Iran has dismissed the laptop information as a fabrication, and other diplomats have dismissed the information as relatively insignificant and coming too late.

The February 2008 IAEA report states that the IAEA has &quot;not detected the use of nuclear material in connection with the alleged studies, nor does it have credible information in this regard.&quot;

====May 2008 report====
On 26 May 2008, the IAEA issued another regular report on the implementation of safeguards in Iran, in which the IAEA has been able to continue to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran, and Iran has provided the IAEA with access to declared nuclear material and accountancy reports, as required by its safeguards agreement. Iran had installed several new centrifuges, including more advanced models, and environmental samples showed the centrifuges &quot;continued to operate as declared&quot;, making low-enriched uranium. The report also noted that other elements of Iran&#x27;s nuclear program continued to be subject to IAEA monitoring and safeguards as well, including the construction of the heavy water facility in Arak, the construction and use of hot cells associated with the Tehran Research Reactor, the uranium conversion efforts, and the Russian nuclear fuel delivered for the Bushehr reactor.

The report stated that the IAEA had requested, as a voluntary &quot;transparency measure&quot;, to be allowed access to centrifuge manufacturing sites, but that Iran had refused the request. The IAEA report stated that Iran had also submitted replies to questions regarding &quot;possible military dimensions&quot; to its nuclear program, which include &quot;alleged studies&quot; on a so-called Green Salt Project, high-explosive testing and missile re-entry vehicles. According to the report, Iran&#x27;s answers were still under review by the IAEA at the time the report was published. However, as part of its earlier &quot;overall assessment&quot; of the allegations, Iran had responded that the documents making the allegations were forged, not authentic, or referred to conventional applications. The report stated that Iran may have more information on the alleged studies, which &quot;remain a matter of serious concern&quot;, but that the IAEA itself had not detected evidence of actual design or manufacture by Iran of nuclear weapons or components. The IAEA also stated that it was not itself in possession of certain documents containing the allegations against Iran, and so was not able to share the documents with Iran.

====September 2008 report====
According to 15 September 2008 IAEA report on the implementation of safeguards in Iran, Iran continued to provide the IAEA with access to declared nuclear material and activities, which continued to be operated under safeguards and with no evidence of any diversion of nuclear material for non-peaceful uses. Nevertheless, the report reiterated that the IAEA would not be able to verify the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran&#x27;s nuclear program unless Iran adopted &quot;transparency measures&quot; which exceeded its safeguards agreement with the IAEA, since the IAEA does not verify the absence of undeclared nuclear activities in any country unless the Additional Protocol is in force.

ElBaradei stated that &quot;we have managed to clarify all the remaining outstanding issues, including the most important issue, which is the scope and nature of Iran&#x27;s enrichment programme&quot; with the exception of a single issue, &quot;and that is the alleged weaponization studies that supposedly Iran has conducted in the past.&quot; According to the report, Iran had increased the number of operating centrifuges at its Fuel Enrichment Plant in Isfahan, and continued to enrich uranium. Contrary to some media reports which claimed that Iran had diverted uranium hexafluoride (UF6) for a renewed nuclear weapons program, the IAEA emphasized that all of the UF6 was under IAEA safeguards. Iran was also asked to clarify information about foreign assistance it may have received in connection with a high explosive charge suitable for an implosion type nuclear device. Iran stated that there had been no such activities in Iran.

The IAEA also reported that it had held a series of meetings with Iranian officials to resolve the outstanding issues including the &quot;alleged studies&quot; into nuclear weaponization which were listed in the May 2008 IAEA report. During the course of these meetings, the Iranians filed a series of written responses including a 117-page presentation which confirmed the partial veracity of some of the allegations, but which asserted that the allegations as a whole were based on &quot;forged&quot; documents and &quot;fabricated&quot; data, and that Iran had not actually received the documentation substantiating the allegations. According to the August 2007 &quot;Modalities Agreement&quot; between Iran and the IAEA, Iran had agreed to review and assess the &quot;alleged studies&quot; claims, as good faith gesture, &quot;upon receiving all related documents.&quot;

While once again expressing &quot;regret&quot; that the IAEA was not able to provide Iran with copies of the documentation concerning the alleged studies, the report also urged Iran to provide the IAEA with &quot;substantive information to support its statements and provide access to relevant documentation and individuals&quot; regarding the alleged studies, as a &quot;matter of transparency&quot;. The IAEA submitted a number of proposals to Iran to help resolve the allegations and expressed a willingness to discuss modalities that could enable Iran to demonstrate credibly that the activities referred to in the documentation were not nuclear-related, as Iran asserted, while protecting sensitive information related to its conventional military activities. The report does not indicate whether Iran accepted or rejected these proposals.

The report also reiterated that IAEA inspectors had found &quot;no evidence on the actual design or manufacture by Iran of nuclear material components of a nuclear weapon or of certain other key components, such as initiators, or on related nuclear physics studies ... Nor has the Agency detected the actual use of nuclear material in connection with the alleged studies&quot; but insisted that the IAEA would not be able to formally verify the peaceful nature of Iran&#x27;s nuclear program unless Iran had agreed to adopt the requested &quot;transparency measures.&quot;

====February 2009 report====
In a report on 19 February 2009 to the Board of Governors, ElBaradei reported that Iran continued to enrich uranium contrary to the decisions of the Security Council and had produced over a ton of low enriched uranium. Results of environmental samples taken by the IAEA at the FEP and PFEP5 indicated that the plants have been operating at levels declared by Tehran, &quot;within the measurement uncertainties normally associated with enrichment plants of a similar throughput.&quot; The IAEA was also able to confirm there was no ongoing reprocessing related activities at Iran&#x27;s Tehran Research Reactor and Xenon Radioisotope Production Facility.

According to the report, Iran also continued to refuse to provide design information or access to verify design information for its IR-40 heavy water research reactor. Iran and the IAEA in February 2003 agreed to modify a provision in the Subsidiary Arrangement to its safeguards agreement (Code 3.1) to require such access. Iran told the IAEA in March 2007 that it &quot;suspended&quot; the implementation of the modified Code 3.1, which had been &quot;accepted in 2003, but not yet ratified by the parliament&quot;, and that it would &quot;revert&quot; to the implementation of the 1976 version of Code 3.1.&lt;ref name=&quot;GOV/2008/22&quot;&gt;GOV/2007/22 Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement and Relevant Provisions of Security Council Resolutions in the Islamic Republic of Iran, 27 May 2007, paragraphs 12–14.&lt;/ref&gt; The subsidiary arrangement may only be modified by mutual agreement. Iran says that since the reactor is not in a position to receive nuclear material the IAEA&#x27;s request for access was not justified, and requested that the IAEA not schedule an inspection to verify design information. The IAEA says its right to verify design information provided to it is a &quot;continuing right, which is not dependent on the stage of construction of, or the presence of nuclear material at, a facility.&quot;

Regarding the &quot;alleged studies&quot; into nuclear weaponization, the IAEA said that &quot;as a result of the continued lack of cooperation by Iran in connection with the remaining issues which give rise to concerns about possible military dimensions of Iran&#x27;s nuclear programme, the Agency has not made any substantive progress on these issues&quot; and called on member states which had provided information about the alleged programs to allow the information to be shared with Iran. IAEA said Iran&#x27;s continued refusal to implement the Additional Protocol was contrary to the request of the Board of Governors and the Security Council and that it was able to continue to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran. Iran said that for the six years the Agency had been considering its case, the IAEA had not found any evidence to prove that Tehran is seeking a nuclear weapon.

Regarding the IAEA report, several news reports suggested that Iran had failed to properly report the amount of LEU it possessed because Iranian estimates did not match the IAEA inspector&#x27;s findings, and that Iran now had enough uranium to make a nuclear bomb. The reporting was widely criticized as unjustifiably provocative and hyped. In response to the controversy, IAEA spokesman Melissa Fleming asserted that the IAEA had no reason at all to believe that the estimates of low-enriched uranium produced by Iran were an intentional error, and that no nuclear material could be removed from the facility for further enrichment to make nuclear weapons without the agency&#x27;s knowledge since the facility is subject to video surveillance and the nuclear material is kept under seal.

Ali Asghar Soltaniyeh, Iran&#x27;s Ambassador to the IAEA, said the February report failed to &quot;provide any new insight into Iran&#x27;s nuclear program.&quot; He asserted the report was written in a way which clearly causes misunderstanding in public opinion. He suggested the reports should be written to have a section about whether Iran has fulfilled its NPT obligations and a separate section for whether &quot;fulfillment of Additional Protocol or sub-arrangements 1 and 3 are beyond the commitment or not.&quot;

In a February 2009 press interview, ElBaradei said Iran has low enriched uranium, but &quot;that doesn&#x27;t mean that they are going tomorrow to have nuclear weapons, because as long as they are under IAEA verification, as long as they are not weaponizing, you know.&quot; ElBaradei continued that there is a confidence deficit with Iran, but that the concern should not be hyped and that &quot;many other countries are enriching uranium without the world making any fuss about it.&quot;

In February 2009 ElBaradei reportedly said that he believed the possibility of a military attack on Iran&#x27;s nuclear installations had been ruled out. &quot;Force can only be used as a last option ... when all other political possibilities have been exhausted,&quot; he told Radio France International. Former Director General Hans Blix criticized Western governments for the years lost by their &quot;ineffective approaches&quot; to Iran&#x27;s nuclear program. Blix suggested the West offer &quot;guarantees against attacks from the outside and subversive activities inside&quot; and also suggested US involvement in regional diplomacy &quot;would offer Iran a greater incentive to reach a nuclear agreement than the Bush team&#x27;s statements that &#x27;Iran must behave itself&#x27;.&quot;

====August 2009 report====
In July 2009, the incoming head of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, said: &quot;I don&#x27;t see any evidence in IAEA official documents&quot; that Iran is trying to gain the ability to develop nuclear arms.

In September 2009, ElBaradei said that Iran had broken the law by not disclosing the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, its second uranium enrichment site near Qom sooner. Nevertheless, he said, the United Nations did not have credible evidence that Iran had an operational nuclear program.

====November 2009 report====
In November 2009, 25 members of the IAEA&#x27;s 35-nation Board of Governors approved a demand of the US, Russia, China, and three other powers that Iran immediately stop building its newly revealed nuclear facility and freeze uranium enrichment. Iranian officials shrugged off the resolution, but the US and its allies hinted at new UN sanctions if Iran remained defiant.

====February 2010 report====
In February 2010, the IAEA reported that Iran had failed to explain purchases of sensitive technology as well as secret tests of high-precision detonators and modified designs of missile cones to accommodate larger payloads, experiments closely associated with atomic warheads.

====May 2010 report====
In May 2010, the IAEA reported that Iran had declared production of over 2.5 metric tons of LEU, which would be enough if further enriched to make two nuclear weapons, and that Iran has refused to answer inspectors’ questions on a variety of activities, including what the agency called the &quot;possible military dimensions&quot; of Iran&#x27;s nuclear program.

In July 2010, Iran barred two IAEA inspectors from entering the country. The IAEA rejected Iran&#x27;s reasons for the ban and said it fully supported the inspectors, which Tehran had accused of reporting wrongly that some nuclear equipment was missing.

In August 2010, the IAEA said Iran has started using a second set of 164 centrifuges linked in a cascade to enrich uranium to up to 20% at its Natanz Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant.

====November 2011 report====
In November 2011, the IAEA reported that inspectors had found credible evidence that Iran had been conducting experiments aimed at designing a nuclear bomb until 2003, and that research may have continued on a smaller scale after that time. IAEA Director Yukiya Amano said evidence gathered by the agency &quot;indicates that Iran has carried out activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device.&quot; A number of Western nuclear experts stated there was very little new in the report, and that media reports had exaggerated its significance. Iran charged that the report was unprofessional and unbalanced, and had been prepared with undue political influence primarily by the United States.

In November 2011, IAEA officials identified a &quot;large explosive containment vessel&quot; inside Parchin. The IAEA later assessed that Iran had been conducting experiments to develop nuclear weapons capability.

The IAEA Board of Governors passed a resolution by a vote of 32–2 that expressed &quot;deep and increasing concern&quot; over the possible military dimensions to Iran&#x27;s nuclear program and calling it &quot;essential&quot; that Iran provide additional information and access to the IAEA. The United States welcomed the resolution and said it would step up sanctions to press Iran to change course. In response to the IAEA resolution, Iran threatened to reduce its cooperation with the IAEA, though Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi played down talk of withdrawal from the NPT or the IAEA.

====February 2012 report====
On 24 February 2012, IAEA Director General Amano reported to the IAEA Board of Governors that high-level IAEA delegations had met twice with Iranian officials to intensify efforts to resolve outstanding issues, but that major differences remained and Iran did not grant IAEA requests for access to the Parchin site, where the IAEA believes high-explosives research pertinent to nuclear weapons may have taken place. Iran dismissed the IAEA&#x27;s report on the possible military dimensions to its nuclear program as based on &quot;unfounded allegations.&quot; Amano called on Iran to agree to a structure approach, based on IAEA verification practices, to resolve outstanding issues. In March 2012, Iran said it would allow another inspection at Parchin &quot;when an agreement is made on a modality plan.&quot; Not long after, it was reported that Iran might not consent to unfettered access. An ISIS study of satellite imagery claimed to have identified an explosive site at Parchin.

The February IAEA report also described progress in Iran&#x27;s enrichment and fuel fabrication efforts, including a tripling of the number of cascades enriching uranium to nearly 20 percent and testing of fuel elements for the Tehran Research Reactor and the still incomplete IR-40 heavy water research reactor. Though Iran was continuing to install thousands of additional centrifuges, these were based on an erratic and outdated design, both in its main enrichment plant at Natanz and in a smaller facility at Fordow buried deep underground. &quot;It appears that they are still struggling with the advanced centrifuges,&quot; said Olli Heinonen, a former chief nuclear inspector, while nuclear expert Mark Fitzpatrick pointed out that Iran had been working on &quot;second-generation models for over ten years now and still can&#x27;t put them into large-scale operation&quot;. Peter Crail and Daryl G. Kimball of the Arms Control Association commented that the report &quot;does not identify any breakthroughs&quot; and &quot;confirms initial impressions that Iran&#x27;s announcements last week on a series of &#x27;nuclear advances&#x27; were hyped.&quot;

====May 2012 report====
In May 2012, the IAEA reported that Iran had increased its rate of production of low-enriched uranium enriched to 3.5 percent and to expand its stockpile of uranium enriched to 19.75 percent, but was having difficulty with more advanced centrifuges. The IAEA also reported detecting particles of uranium enriched to 27 percent at the Fordu enrichment facility. However, a diplomat in Vienna cautioned that the spike in uranium purity found by inspectors could turn out to be accidental. This change drastically moved Iran&#x27;s uranium toward bomb-grade material. Until then, the highest level of purity that had been found in Iran was 20 percent.

====August 2012 report====
In late August, the IAEA set up an Iran Task Force to deal with inspections and other issues related to Iran&#x27;s nuclear program, in an attempt to focus and streamline the IAEA&#x27;s handling of Iran&#x27;s nuclear program by concentrating experts and other resources into one dedicated team.

On 30 August, the IAEA released a report showing a major expansion of Iranian enrichment activities. The report said that Iran has more than doubled the number of centrifuges at the underground facility at Fordow, from 1,064 centrifuges in May to 2,140 centrifuges in August, though the number of operating centrifuges had not increased. The report said that since 2010 Iran had produced about 190 kg of 20-per-cent-enriched uranium, up from 145 kg in May. The report also noted that Iran had converted some of the 20-per-cent-enriched uranium to an oxide form and fabricated into fuel for use in research reactors, and that once this conversion and fabrication have taken place, the fuel cannot be readily enriched to weapon-grade purity.

The report also expressed concerns over Parchin, which the IAEA has sought to inspect for evidence of nuclear weapons development. Since the IAEA requested access, &quot;significant ground scraping and landscaping have been undertaken over an extensive area at and around the location,&quot; five buildings had been demolished, while power lines, fences, and paved roads were removed, all of which would hamper the IAEA investigation if it were granted access.

In a briefing to the Board of Governors on this report in early September 2012, IAEA Deputy Director General Herman Nackaerts and Assistant Director General Rafael Grossi displayed satellite images for its member states which allegedly demonstrate Iranian efforts to remove incriminating evidence from its facility at Parchin, or a &quot;nuclear clean-up.&quot; These images showed a building at Parchin covered in what appeared to be a pink tarpaulin, as well as demolition of building and removal of earth that the IAEA said would &quot;significantly hamper&quot; its investigation. A senior Western diplomat described the presentation as &quot;pretty compelling.&quot; The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) said that the purpose of the pink tarpaulin could be to hide further &quot;clean-up work&quot; from satellites. However, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, Iran&#x27;s envoy to the IAEA, denied the contents of the presentation, saying that &quot;merely having a photo from up there, a satellite imagery ... this is not the way the agency should do its professional job.&quot;

According to the Associated Press, the IAEA received &quot;new and significant intelligence&quot; by September 2012, which four diplomats confirmed was the basis for a passage in the August 2012 IAEA report that &quot;the agency has obtained more information which further corroborates&quot; suspicions. The intelligence reportedly indicates that Iran had advanced work on computer modeling of the performance of a nuclear warhead, work David Albright of ISIS said was &quot;critical to the development of a nuclear weapon.&quot; The intelligence would also boost fears by the IAEA that Iran has advanced its weapons research on multiple fronts, as computer modeling is usually accompanied by physical tests of the components which would enter a nuclear weapon.

In response to this report, the IAEA Board of Governors on 13 September passed a resolution that rebuked Iran for defying UN Security Council resolutions to suspend uranium enrichment and called on Iran to allow inspections of evidence that it is pursuing weapons technology. The resolution, which passed by a vote of 31–1 with 3 abstentions, also expressed &quot;serious concerns&quot; about Iran&#x27;s nuclear program while desiring a peaceful resolution. Senior United States diplomat Robert Wood blamed Iran for &quot;systematically demolishing&quot; a facility at the Parchin military base, which IAEA inspectors have attempted to visit in the past, but were not granted access, saying &quot;Iran has been taking measures that appear consistent with an effort to remove evidence of its past activities at Parchin.&quot; The resolution was introduced jointly by China, France, Germany, Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

====November 2012 report====
On 16 November, the IAEA released a report showing continued expansion in Iranian uranium enrichment capabilities. At Fordow, all 2,784 IR-1 centrifuges (16 cascades of 174 each) have been installed, though only 4 cascades are operating and another 4 are fully equipped, vacuum-tested, and ready to begin operating. Iran has produced approximately 233 kg of near-20 percent enriched uranium, an increase of 43 kg since the August 2012 IAEA report.

The IAEA August 2012 report stated that Iran had begun to use 96 kg of its near-20 percent enriched uranium to fabricate fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor, which makes it more difficult to further enrich that uranium to weapons grade, since it would first need to be converted back to uranium hexafluoride gas. Though more of this uranium has been fabricated into fuel, no additional uranium has been sent to the Fuel Plate Fabrication Plant at Isfahan.

The November report noted that Iran has continued to deny the IAEA access to the military site at Parchin. Citing evidence from satellite imagery that &quot;Iran constructed a large explosives containment vessel in which to conduct hydrodynamic experiments&quot; relevant to nuclear weapons development, the report expresses concern that changes taking place at the Parchin military site might eliminate evidence of past nuclear activities, noting that there had been virtually no activity at that location between February 2005 and the time the IAEA requested access. Those changes include:
* Frequent presence of equipment, trucks and personnel.
* Large amounts of liquid run-off.
* Removal of external pipework.
* Razing and removal of five other buildings or structures and the site perimeter fence.
* Reconfiguration of electrical and water supply.
* Shrouding of the containment vessel building.
* Scraping and removal of large quantities of earth and the depositing of new earth in its place.

Iran said that the IR-40 heavy water research reactor at Arak was expected begin to operate in the first quarter of 2014. During on-site inspections of the IR-40 design, IAEA inspectors observed that the installation of cooling and moderator circuit piping was continuing.

====February 2013 report====
On 21 February, the IAEA released a report showing continued expansion in Iranian uranium enrichment capabilities. As of 19 February, 12,699 IR-1 centrifuges have been installed at Natanz. This includes the installation of 2,255 centrifuges since the previous IAEA report in November.

Fordow, the nuclear facility near Qom, contains 16 cascades, equally divided between Unit 1 and Unit 2, with a total of 2,710 centrifuges. Iran is continuing to operate the four cascades of 174 IR-1 centrifuges each in two tandem sets to produce 19.75 percent LEU in a total of 696 enriching centrifuges, the same number of centrifuges enriching as was reported in November 2012.

Iran has produced approximately 280 kg of near-20 percent enriched uranium, an increase of 47 kg since the November 2012 IAEA report and the total 3.5 percent LEU production stands at 8,271 kg (compared to 7,611 kg reported during the last quarter).

The IAEA February 2013 report stated that Iran had resumed reconverting near-20 percent enriched uranium into Oxide form to fabricate fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor, which makes it more difficult to further enrich that uranium to weapons grade, since it would first need to be converted back to UF6 gas.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAEA GOV/2013/6&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The February report noted that Iran has continued to deny the IAEA access to the military site at Parchin. Citing evidence from satellite imagery that &quot;Iran constructed a large explosives containment vessel in which to conduct hydrodynamic experiments&quot;. Such installation could be an indicator of nuclear weapons development. The report expresses concern that changes taking place at the Parchin military site might eliminate evidence of past nuclear activities, noting that there had been virtually no activity at that location between February 2005 and the time the IAEA requested access. Those changes include:
* Reinstatement of some of the chamber building&#x27;s features, for example wall panels and exhaust piping.
* Alterations to the roofs of the chamber building and the other large building.
* Dismantlement and reconstruction of the annex to the other large building.
* Construction of one small building at the same place where a building of similar size had previously been demolished.
* Spreading, leveling and compacting of another layer of material over a large area.
* Installation of a fence that divides the location into two areas. Most of these activities have also been documented by ISIS in satellite imagery reports, dated 29 November 2012, 12 December 2012 and 25 January 2013.

Iran said that the IR-40 heavy water-moderated research reactor at Arak was expected begin to operate in the first quarter of 2014. During on-site inspections of the IR-40 design, IAEA inspectors observed that the previously reported installation of cooling and moderator circuit piping was almost complete. The IAEA reported that Iran will use the Tehran Research Reactor to test fuel for the IR-40 reactor, which the UN Security Council has demanded that Iran stop building because it could be used to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons. The IAEA report states that &quot;on 26 November 2012, the Agency verified a prototype IR-40 natural uranium fuel assembly before its transfer to TRR for irradiation testing.&quot; Since its last visit on 17 August 2011, the Agency has not been provided with further access to the plant so is relying on satellite imagery to monitor the status of the plant.

====March 2015 report====
In March 2015, IAEA Director General Amano reported that Iran did not provide sufficient access or information to resolve a dozen issues related to the possible military dimensions of its nuclear program, giving only very limited information on only one of those issues.

====December 2015 report====
In December 2015, the IAEA issued a report concluding:
The Agency assesses that a range of activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device were conducted in Iran prior to the end of 2003 as a coordinated effort, and some activities took place after 2003. The Agency also assesses that these activities did not advance beyond feasibility and scientific studies, and the acquisition of certain relevant technical competences and capabilities. The Agency has no credible indications of activities in Iran relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device after 2009.

Following this report, the IAEA Board of Governors passed a resolution closing its consideration of the issues in the report and terminating previous resolutions about Iran.

====December 2020 report====

In December 2020, the IAEA reported that Tehran &quot;holds more than 12 times the amount of enriched uranium&quot; permitted under the JCPOA, and that &quot;work has also begun on the construction of new underground facilities close to Natanz, its main enrichment facility&quot;.

====2021====

Until 2021, Iran consistently asserted that its nuclear program was solely for peaceful purposes, reinforced by a fatwa issued by Ayatollah Khamenei against the development of nuclear weapons. But in an interview in November 2021, on the anniversary of the assassination of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, former head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran Fereydoun Abbasi-Davani mentioned the country&#x27;s growth &quot;involving satellites, missiles, and nuclear weapons&quot; and said that although Iran&#x27;s stance on nuclear weapons being haram was quite clear, Fakhrizadeh had &quot;created this system.&quot;

====October 2023 report====

As of 2023, the IAEA stated in an October quarterly report that Iran is estimated to have further increased its uranium stockpile twenty-two times over the 2015 agreed JCPOA limit. The IAEA also noted that Iran has continued to push back against inspections of its nuclear program and several inspectors had been barred by Iran, a move that received condemnation by the agency.

===Iranian views===
Interviews and surveys show that the majority of Iranians in all groups favor their country&#x27;s nuclear program. Polls in 2008 showed that the vast majority of Iranians want their country to develop nuclear energy, and 90% of Iranians believe it is important (including 81% very important) for Iran &quot;to have a full fuel cycle nuclear program.&quot; Though Iranians are not Arab, Arab publics in six countries also believe that Iran has the right to its nuclear program and should not be pressured to stop that program. A poll in September 2010 by the International Peace Institute found that 71% of Iranians favored the development of nuclear weapons, a drastic hike over the previous polls by the same agency. However, in July 2012, a poll on an Iranian state-run media outlet found that 2/3 Iranians support suspending uranium enrichment in return for a gradual easing of sanctions. Meir Javedanfar, an Iranian-born commentator with the Middle East Economic and Political Analysis Company, stated that while Iranians may want nuclear energy, they don&#x27;t want it at the price the government is willing to pay.

In explaining why it had left its enrichment program undeclared to the IAEA, Iran said that for the past twenty-four years it has &quot;been subject to the most severe series of sanctions and export restrictions on material and technology for peaceful nuclear technology,&quot; so that some elements of its program had to be done discreetly. Iran said the US intention &quot;is nothing but to make this deprivation&quot; of Iran&#x27;s inalienable right to enrichment technology &quot;final and eternal,&quot; and that the United States is completely silent on Israel&#x27;s nuclear enrichment and weapons program. Iran began its nuclear research as early as 1975, when France cooperated with Iran to set up the Esfahan Nuclear Technology Center (ENTC) to provide training for personnel to develop certain nuclear fuel cycle capabilities. Iran did not hide other elements of its nuclear program. For example, its efforts at mining and converting uranium were announced on national radio, and Iran also says that in consultation with the Agency and member states throughout the 1990s it underlined its plans to acquire, for exclusively peaceful purposes, fuel enrichment technology. Iran&#x27;s contracts with other nations to obtain nuclear reactors were also known to the IAEA – but support for the contracts was withdrawn after &quot;a U.S. special national intelligence estimate declared that while &#x27;Iran&#x27;s much publicized nuclear power intentions are entirely in the planning stage,&#x27; the ambitions of the Shah could lead Iran to pursue nuclear weapons, especially in the shadow of India&#x27;s successful nuclear test in May 1974&quot;. In 2003, the IAEA reported that Iran had failed to meet its obligations to report some of its enrichment activities, which Iran says began in 1985, to the IAEA as required by its safeguards agreement. The IAEA further reported that Iran had undertaken to submit the required information for agency verification and &quot;to implement a policy of co-operation and full transparency&quot; as corrective actions.

The Iranian government has repeatedly made compromise offers to place limits on its nuclear program beyond what the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Additional Protocol require of Iran, in order to ensure that the program cannot be secretly diverted to the manufacture of weapons. These offers have included operating Iran&#x27;s nuclear program as an international consortium, with the full participation of foreign governments. This offer by the Iranians matched a proposed solution put forth by an IAEA expert committee that was investigating the risk that civilian nuclear technologies could be used to make bombs. Iran has also offered to renounce plutonium extraction technology, thus ensuring that its heavy water reactor at Arak cannot be used to make bombs either. More recently, the Iranians have reportedly also offered to operate uranium centrifuges that automatically self-destruct if they are used to enrich uranium beyond what is required for civilian purposes. However, despite offers of nuclear cooperation by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany, Iran has refused to suspend its enrichment program as the council has demanded. Iran&#x27;s representative asserted that dealing with the issue in the Security Council was unwarranted and void of any legal basis or practical utility because its peaceful nuclear program posed no threat to international peace and security, and, that it ran counter to the views of the majority of United Nations Member States, which the council was obliged to represent.

&quot;They should know that the Iranian nation will not yield to pressure and will not let its rights be trampled on,&quot; Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told a crowd 31 August 2006, in a televised speech in the northwestern city of Orumiyeh. In front of his strongest supporters in one of his provincial power bases, the Iranian leader attacked what he called &quot;intimidation&quot; by the UN, which he said was led by the US. Ahmadinejad criticized a White House rebuff of his offer for a televised debate with President Bush. &quot;They say they support dialog and the free flow of information,&quot; he said. &quot;But when debate was proposed, they avoided and opposed it.&quot; Ahmadinejad said that sanctions &quot;cannot dissuade Iranians from their decision to make progress,&quot; according to Iran&#x27;s state-run IRNA news agency. &quot;On the contrary, many of our successes, including access to the nuclear fuel cycle and producing of heavy water, have been achieved under sanctions.&quot;

Iran insists enrichment activities are intended for peaceful purposes, but much of the West, including the United States, allege that Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons, or a nuclear weapons &quot;capability&quot;. 31 August 2006, deadline called for Iran to comply with UN Security Council Resolution 1696 and suspend its enrichment-related activities or face the possibility of economic sanctions. The United States believes the council will agree to implement sanctions when high-level ministers reconvene in mid-September, US Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns said. &quot;We&#x27;re sure going to work toward that [sanctions] with a great deal of energy and determination because this cannot go unanswered,&quot; Burns said. &quot;The Iranians are obviously proceeding with their nuclear research; they are doing things that the International Atomic Energy Agency does not want them to do, the Security Council doesn&#x27;t want them to do. There has to be an international answer, and we believe there will be one.&quot;

Iran asserts that there is no legal basis for Iran&#x27;s referral to the United Nations Security Council since the IAEA has not proven that previously undeclared activities had a relationship to a weapons program, and that all nuclear material in Iran (including material that may not have been declared) had been accounted for and had not been diverted to military purposes. Article XII.C of the IAEA Statute requires a report to the UN Security Council for any safeguards noncompliance. The IAEA Board of Governors, in a rare non-consensus decision with 12 abstentions, decided that &quot;Iran&#x27;s many failures and breaches of its obligations to comply with its NPT Safeguards Agreement&quot; as reported by the IAEA in November 2003 constituted &quot;non-compliance&quot; under the terms of Article XII.C of IAEA Statute.

Iran also minimizes the significance of the IAEA&#x27;s inability to verify the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran&#x27;s nuclear program, arguing the IAEA has only drawn such conclusions in a subset of states that have ratified and implemented the Additional Protocol. The IAEA has been able to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran, but not the absence of undeclared activities. According to the IAEA&#x27;s Safeguards Statement for 2007, of the 82 states where both NPT safeguards and an Additional Protocol are implemented, the IAEA had found no indication of undeclared nuclear activity in 47 states, while evaluations of possible undeclared nuclear activity remained ongoing in 35 states. Iran ceased implementation of the Additional Protocol and all other cooperation with the IAEA beyond that required under its safeguards agreement after the IAEA Board of Governors decided to report its safeguards non-compliance to the UN Security Council in February 2006. Iran insisted that such cooperation had been &quot;voluntary,&quot; but on 26 December 2006, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1737, invoking Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which among other things required Iran to cooperate fully with the IAEA, &quot;beyond the formal requirements of the Safeguards Agreement and Additional Protocol.&quot; The IAEA reported on 19 November 2008, that, while it is &quot;able to continue to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran,&quot; it &quot;has not been able to make substantive progress&quot; on &quot;key remaining issues of serious concern&quot; because of a &quot;lack of cooperation by Iran.&quot; Iran has maintained that the Security Council&#x27;s engagement in &quot;the issue of the peaceful nuclear activities of the Islamic Republic of Iran&quot; are unlawful and malicious. Iran also argues that the UN Security Council resolutions demanding a suspension of enrichment constitute a violation of Article IV of the Non-Proliferation Treaty which recognizes the inalienable right of signatory nations to nuclear technology &quot;for peaceful purposes.&quot;

Iran agreed to implement the Additional Protocol under the terms of the October 2003 Tehran agreement and its successor, the November 2004 Paris agreement, and did so for two years before withdrawing from the Paris agreement in early 2006 following the breakdown of negotiations with the EU-3. Since then, Iran has offered not only to ratify the Additional Protocol, but to implement transparency measures on its nuclear program that exceed the Additional Protocol, as long as its right to operate an enrichment program is recognized. The UN Security Council, however, insists that Iran must suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, and the United States explicitly ruled out the possibility that it would allow Iran to produce its own nuclear fuel, even under intense international inspection.

On 9 April 2007, Iran announced that it has begun enriching uranium with 3 000 centrifuges, presumably at Natanz enrichment site. &quot;With great honor, I declare that as of today our dear country has joined the nuclear club of nations and can produce nuclear fuel on an industrial scale&quot;, said Ahmadinejad.

On 22 April 2007, Iranians foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini announced that his country rules out enrichment suspension ahead of talks with EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana on 25 April 2007.

Reacting to the November 2009 IAEA Board of Governors resolution demanding that Iran immediately stop building its newly revealed nuclear facility and freeze uranium enrichment, Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast described the resolution as a &quot;show ... aimed at putting pressure on Iran, which will be useless.&quot; The Iranian government subsequently authorized the country&#x27;s Atomic Energy Organization to begin building ten more uranium-enrichment plants for enhancing the country&#x27;s electricity production.

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on 1 December brushed aside the threat of UN sanctions over his country&#x27;s failure to accept a UN-proposed deal on its nuclear program, stating that such a move by western nations would not hinder Iran&#x27;s nuclear program. Ahmadinejad told state television that he believed further negotiations with world powers over his country&#x27;s nuclear program were not needed, describing warnings by Western powers that Iran would be isolated if it fails to accept the UN-proposed deal as &quot;ridiculous.&quot;

Watched by senior officials from Iran and Russia, Iran began fueling Bushehr I on 21 August 2010 the nation&#x27;s state media reported, in an effort to help create nuclear-generated electricity. While state media reported it will take about two months for the reactor to begin generating electricity, Russia&#x27;s nuclear agency says it will take longer. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran&#x27;s supreme leader, recently asserted Iran&#x27;s right to establish nuclear plants.

On 17 September 2012, speaking at the IAEA General Conference, Iranian nuclear chief Fereydoon Abbasi attacked the IAEA, saying that &quot;terrorists and saboteurs&quot; had possibly infiltrated the IAEA in order to derail Iran&#x27;s nuclear program. Abbasi said that on 17 August 2012, an underground enrichment plant was sabotaged, and IAEA inspectors arrived in Iran to inspect it soon after. The Associated Press noted that his comments reflected a determination in Iran to continue defying international pressure regarding its nuclear program. Mark Fitzpatrick of the International Institute for Strategic Studies said that Iran&#x27;s accusations regarding the IAEA &quot;are a new low. Increasingly cornered, they are lashing out wildly.&quot; Abassi&#x27;s allegations were viewed by some Western experts as providing a potential pretext for Iran to officially downgrade its level of cooperation with the IAEA. Abbasi also met separately with Director General Amano, after which the IAEA pressed Iran to address concerns in its nuclear program, and said that the IAEA was ready for negotiations soon. The IAEA did not comment on Abbasi&#x27;s statements regarding &quot;terrorists and saboteurs,&quot; but did say that it was vital that Iran cooperate with IAEA inspectors in order to clarify suspicions regarding its nuclear program. In an interview on the sidelines of the IAEA General Conference. Abbasi was quoted as saying that Iran had intentionally provided false information about its nuclear program to mislead western intelligence. Abbasi, who had been an assassination target in 2010, said Iran sometimes exaggerated and sometimes understated its progress.

The negotiations between Ahmadinejad&#x27;s government and the P5+1 group did not end the dispute due to Iran&#x27;s firm stance on not suspending uranium enrichment. At the same time, the top clerics in Tehran felt Ahmadinejad&#x27;s firm standing against the West would destabilize their regime. Ahmadinejad had some tendency toward Iranian nationalism, which deviated from the clerics&#x27; theocratic rule. Hence they labeled the faction associated with him as &quot;deviant current&quot;. When Ahmadinejad became a lame duck president in the last year of his second term (2012–2013), the clerics bypassed him and the Majlis, and tried to negotiate secretly with US officials. They sent a separate team to Muscat to negotiate a nuclear deal through a back channel with the White House. Oman&#x27;s Sultan Qaboos bin Said acted as mediator between the two governments.

In September 2013, in an interview with the Washington Post, the newly elected President of Iran Hassan Rouhani said that he wanted a resolution to the nuclear issue within &quot;months, not years.&quot; Rouhani said he saw the nuclear issue as a &quot;beginning point&quot; for US–Iran relations.

On 12 April 2022, Iran&#x27;s supreme leader said on Tuesday that his country&#x27;s future should not be linked to the success or failure of nuclear discussions with international powers, according to Iranian state media, adding that efforts to resurrect a 2015 nuclear deal &quot;are progressing well.&quot;

In April 2022, former Iranian MP Ali Motahari admitted that Iran aimed to make a nuclear bomb from the very beginning of its nuclear program. A day later, he said he meant &quot;creation&quot; of atomic bomb to frighten the enemy is alright, as Quran says &quot;frighten thereby the enemy of Allah&quot;, but &quot;use&quot; of it (to actually attack the enemy) should be forbidden.

In June 2022, Iran promised on Friday to respond &quot;immediately&quot; to any action taken against it by the United States and European countries at the United Nations&#x27; nuclear watchdog IAEA, according to Iranian official media.

===US views===
President George W. Bush insisted on 31 August 2006, that &quot;there must be consequences&quot; for Iran&#x27;s defiance of demands that it stop enriching uranium. He asserted &quot;the world now faces a grave threat from the radical regime in Iran. The Iranian regime arms, funds, and advises Hezbollah.&quot; The IAEA issued a report saying Iran had not suspended its uranium enrichment activities, a United Nations official said. This report opened the way for UN Security Council sanctions against Iran. Facing a Security Council deadline to stop its uranium enrichment activities, Iran has left little doubt it will defy the West and continue its nuclear program.

A congressional report released on 23 August 2006, summarized the documentary history of Iran&#x27;s nuclear program, but also made allegations against the IAEA. The IAEA responded with a strongly worded letter to then US House Intelligence Committee Chairman Peter Hoekstra, which labeled as &quot;outrageous and dishonest&quot; the report&#x27;s allegation that an IAEA inspector was dismissed for violating a supposed IAEA policy against &quot;telling the whole truth&quot; about Iran and pointed out other factual errors, such as a claim that Iran had enriched &quot;weapons-grade&quot; uranium.

John Bolton, then US ambassador to the UN, said on 31 August 2006 that he expected action to impose sanctions to begin immediately after the deadline passed, with meetings of high-level officials in the coming days, followed by negotiations on the language of the sanctions resolution. Bolton said that when the deadline passed &quot;a little flag will go up.&quot; &quot;In terms of what happens afterward, at that point, if they have not suspended all uranium enrichment activities, they will not be in compliance with the resolution,&quot; he said. &quot;And at that point, the steps that the foreign ministers have agreed upon previously ... we would begin to talk about how to implement those steps.&quot; The five permanent members of the Security Council, plus Germany, previously offered Iran a package of incentives aimed at getting the country to restart negotiations, but Iran refused to halt its nuclear activities first. Incentives included offers to improve Iran&#x27;s access to the international economy through participation in groups such as the World Trade Organization and to modernize its telecommunications industry. The incentives also mentioned the possibility of lifting restrictions on US and European manufacturers wanting to export civil aircraft to Iran. And a proposed long-term agreement accompanying the incentives offered a &quot;fresh start in negotiations.&quot;

In a 2007 National Intelligence Estimate, the United States Intelligence Community assessed that Iran had ended all &quot;nuclear weapon design and weaponization work&quot; in 2003.

IAEA officials complained in 2007 that most US intelligence shared with it to date about Iran&#x27;s nuclear program proved to be inaccurate, and that none had led to significant discoveries inside Iran through that time.

Through 2008, the United States repeatedly refused to rule out using nuclear weapons in an attack on Iran. The US Nuclear Posture Review made public in 2002 specifically envisioned the use of nuclear weapons on a first strike basis, even against non-nuclear armed states. Investigative reporter Seymour Hersh reported that, according to military officials, the Bush administration had plans for the use of nuclear weapons against &quot;underground Iranian nuclear facilities&quot;. When specifically questioned about the potential use of nuclear weapons against Iran, President Bush claimed that &quot;All options were on the table&quot;. According to the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot;, Bush &quot;directly threatened Iran with a preemptive nuclear strike. It is hard to read his reply in any other way.&quot; The Iranian authorities consistently replied that they were not seeking nuclear weapons as a deterrent to the United States, and instead emphasize the creation of a nuclear-arms free zone in the Middle East. The policy of using nuclear weapons on a first-strike basis against non-nuclear opponents is a violation of the US Negative Security Assurance pledge not to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear members of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) such as Iran. Threats of the use of nuclear weapons against another country constitute a violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 984 and the International Court of Justice advisory opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons.

In December 2008, President-elect Barack Obama gave an interview on Sunday&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Press&quot; with host Tom Brokaw during which he said the United States needs to &quot;ratchet up tough but direct diplomacy with Iran&quot;. He said in his view the United States needs to make it clear to the Iranians that their alleged development of nuclear weapons and funding of organizations &quot;like Hamas and Hezbollah,&quot; and threats against Israel are &quot;unacceptable.&quot; Obama supports diplomacy with Iran without preconditions &quot;to pressure Iran to stop their illicit nuclear program&quot;. Mohamed ElBaradei has welcomed the new stance to talk to Iran as &quot;long overdue&quot;. Iran said Obama should apologize for the US bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II and his administration should stop talking to the world and &quot;listen to what others are saying.&quot; In his first press interview as president, Obama told Al Arabiya that &quot;if countries like Iran are willing to unclench their fist, they will find an extended hand from us.&quot;

In March 2009 US National Intelligence Director Dennis C. Blair and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lieutenant General Michael D. Maples told a United States Senate Committee on Armed Services hearing that Iran has only low-enriched uranium, which there were no indications it was refining. Their comments countered ones made earlier by an Israeli general and Maples said the United States was arriving at different conclusions from the same facts.

On 7 April 2009, a Manhattan district attorney charged a financier with the suspected misuse of Manhattan banks employed to transfer money between China and Iran by way of Europe and the United States. The materials in question can be used for weapons as well as civilian purposes, but some of the material can potentially be used in making engine nozzles that can withstand fiery temperatures and centrifuges that can enrich uranium into atomic fuel. The charges would carry a maximum of up to a year in jail for fifth-degree conspiracy and a maximum of four years for falsifying business records. David Albright, a nuclear weapons expert who assisted in the prosecution, said that it is impossible to say how Iran used or could use the raw materials it acquired.

A document released by the US State Department&#x27;s Bureau of Intelligence and Research in August 2009 assessed that Iran was unlikely to have the technical capability to produce HEU (highly enriched uranium) before 2013, and the US intelligence community had no evidence that Iran had yet made the decision to produce highly enriched uranium. In 2009, US intelligence assessed that Iranian intentions were unknown.

On 26 July 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton explicitly ruled out the possibility that the Obama administration would allow Iran to produce its own nuclear fuel, even under intense international inspection.

Following the November 2009 IAEA Board of Governors resolution demanding Iran immediately stop building its newly revealed nuclear facility and freeze uranium enrichment, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs avoided mentioning sanctions but indicated harsher measures were possible unless Iran compromised: &quot;If Iran refuses to meet its obligations, then it will be responsible for its own growing isolation and the consequences.&quot; Glyn Davies, the chief US delegate to the IAEA, told reporters: &quot;Six nations ... for the first time came together ...[and] have put together this resolution we all agreed on. That&#x27;s a significant development.&quot;

A 2009 US congressional research paper said that US intelligence believed Iran ended &quot;nuclear weapon design and weaponization work&quot; in 2003. Some advisors within the Obama administration reaffirmed the intelligence conclusions, while other &quot;top advisers&quot; in the Obama administration &quot;say they no longer believe&quot; the key finding of the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate. Thomas Fingar, former Chairman of the National Intelligence Council until December 2008, said that the original 2007 National Intelligence Estimate on Iran &quot;became contentious, in part, because the White House instructed the Intelligence Community to release an unclassified version of the report&#x27;s key judgments but declined to take responsibility for ordering its release.&quot; A National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) is the most authoritative written judgment concerning a national security issue prepared by the Director of Central Intelligence.

The impending opening of the Bushehr I plant in late 2010 prompted the White House to question why Iran is continuing to enrich uranium within its borders. &quot;Russia is providing the fuel, and taking the fuel back out,&quot; White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said in August. &quot;It, quite clearly, I think, underscores that Iran does not need its own enrichment capability if its intentions, as it states, are for a peaceful nuclear program,&quot; he said.

On 8 January 2012, US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said on Face the Nation that Iran was not trying to develop a nuclear weapon, but was trying to develop a nuclear capability. He also urged Israel to work together rather than make a unilateral strike on Iran&#x27;s nuclear installations. On 1 August 2012, US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta while in Israel said that the United States had &quot;options,&quot; including military options, to prevent Iran from attaining a nuclear weapon, should diplomacy fail. In 2012, sixteen US intelligence agencies, including the CIA, reported that Iran was pursuing research that could enable it to produce nuclear weapons, but was not attempting to do so. The senior officers of all of the major American intelligence agencies stated that there was no conclusive evidence that Iran has made any attempt to produce nuclear weapons since 2003.

On 14 January 2013, the Institute for Science and International Security (a US think tank) published a 154-page report by five US experts titled &quot;U.S. Nonproliferation Strategy for the Changing Middle East&quot;, which stated that Iran could produce enough weapon-grade uranium for one or more nuclear bombs by the middle of 2014. Therefore, the report recommended that the United States should increase sanctions on Iran in order to curb its ability to develop weapon-grade uranium. In addition the report states: &quot;The president should explicitly declare that he will use military force to destroy Iran&#x27;s nuclear program if Iran takes additional decisive steps toward producing a bomb.&quot;

On 2 February 2013, speaking at the Munich Security Conference, US Vice President Joseph Biden said that the Obama administration &quot;would be prepared to meet bilaterally with the Iranian leadership. We would not make it a secret that we were doing that. We would let our partners know if that occasion presented itself. That offer stands, but it must be real and tangible, and there has to be an agenda that they’re prepared to speak to. We are not just prepared to do it for the exercise.&quot; A few days later Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rejected the offer and added ambiguously: &quot;The U.S. policies in the Middle East have failed and the Americans are in need of a winning hand. That is bringing Iran to the negotiating table.&quot; On 4 February the Italian news-wire &quot;Agenzia Nova&quot;, citing &quot;sources in Teheran,&quot; reported that &quot;from the beginning of the year Ali Larijani, Speaker of the (Iranian) Parliament, secretly traveled twice to the United States&quot; to launch direct negotiations with the Obama Administration. The Italian Agency explained that US diplomacy was waiting for the Presidential election in Iran, that most probably will see a dramatic change in Iranian approach. It was reported on 17 June Iran&#x27;s newly elected president Hassan Rohani had expressed readiness for bilateral talks with Washington, with conditions.

In April 2015, hailing the agreement between the P5+1 and Iran on parameters for a comprehensive agreement, President Obama said &quot;the United States, together with our allies and partners, has reached an historic understanding with Iran, which if fully implemented, will prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon.&quot; In 2018, Mike Pompeo, US Secretary of State nominee, said he believed that Iran had not been &quot;racing&quot; to develop a nuclear weapon before the finalization of the Iran deal and that it would not do so if the deal were to unravel, although he favored a &quot;fix&quot; of the deal. In 2021, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken did not rule out a military intervention to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. In 2022, a French diplomatic source stated that the US is unlikely to agree to remove Iran&#x27;s elite security force from its list of foreign terrorist organizations anytime soon.

In June 2023, an assessment by the U.S. Director of National Intelligence concluded that Iran was not developing nuclear weapons, though it was improving its nuclear capabilities, reporting that &quot;Iran is not currently undertaking the key nuclear weapons-development activities that would be necessary to produce a testable nuclear device&quot;.

===Negotiations between Iran and the P5+1===
Iran has held a series of meetings with a group of six countries: China, France, Germany, Russia, United Kingdom, United States. These six are known as the P5+1 (the permanent five members of the UN Security Council plus Germany) or alternatively as the E3+3. These meetings are intended to resolve concerns about Iran&#x27;s nuclear program.

====January 2011 Istanbul meeting====
Negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 were resumed on 21 January 2011 in Istanbul after about a 14-month break. The two-day meetings were led by EU High Representative Catherine Ashton and Iran&#x27;s chief nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili. The talks deadlocked after Iran imposed two preconditions: recognition of Iran&#x27;s right to enrich uranium and dropping the United Nations economic sanctions on Tehran.

====April 2012 Istanbul meeting====
The first session of fresh negotiations in April went well, with delegates praising the constructive dialogue and Iran&#x27;s positive attitude. Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said, however, that Iran had been given a &quot;freebie&quot;, a charge that was sharply rebutted by Barack Obama. In the lead up to the second round of negotiations in May, and in what may foreshadow a significant concession, an unnamed senior US official hinted the United States might accept Iran enriching uranium to five percent so long as the Iranians agreed to tough international oversight of the process. The US shift was reportedly made for the pragmatic reason that unconditional demands for zero enrichment would make it impossible to reach a negotiated deal. Netanyahu had insisted a few days before that he would tolerate no enrichment, not even to the three percent required for nuclear power. In a shift on the Iranian side, April saw members of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps urging Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to maintain a policy of keeping uranium enrichment at or below 20 percent. The EU&#x27;s High Representative for Foreign Affairs Catherine Ashton felt compelled to make a special visit to Netanyahu, partly to keep him from again voicing his negativity and opposition to the negotiations. At the meeting, which included Avigdor Lieberman, Ehud Barak and Shaul Mofaz, the Israelis demanded a guaranteed timetable for cessation of all uranium enrichment by Iran, the removal of all enriched uranium, and the dismantlement of the underground facility at Fordo. Otherwise, they said, Iran would use the talks to buy time.

===Second enrichment plant===
On 21 September 2009, Iran informed the IAEA that it was constructing a second enrichment facility. The following day (22 September) IAEA Director General ElBaradei informed the United States, and two days later (24 September) the United States, United Kingdom and France briefed the IAEA on an enrichment facility under construction at an underground location at Fordow, north of Qom. On 25 September, at the G-20 Summit, the three countries criticized Iran for once again concealing a nuclear facility from the IAEA. The United States said that the facility, which was still months from completion, was too small to be useful for a civil program but could produce enough high-enriched uranium for one bomb per year. Iran said the plant was for peaceful purposes and would take between a year and a half to two years to complete, and that the notice Iran had given had exceeded the 180 days before insertion of nuclear materials the IAEA safeguards agreement that Iran was following required. Iran agreed to allow IAEA inspections. Iran&#x27;s nuclear chief, Ali Akbar Salehi, said the site was built for maximum protection from aerial attack: carved into a mountain and near a military compound of the powerful Revolutionary Guard.

Also in October, the United States, France, and Russia proposed a UN-drafted deal to Iran regarding its nuclear program, in an effort to find a compromise between Iran&#x27;s stated need for a nuclear reactor and international concerns that Iran harbors a secret intent on developing a nuclear weapon. After some delay in responding, on 29 October, Ahmadinejad voiced an openness towards cooperation with other world powers. &quot;We welcome fuel exchange, nuclear co-operation, building of power plants and reactors and we are ready to co-operate,&quot; he said in a live broadcast on state television. However, he added that Iran would not retreat &quot;one iota&quot; on its right to a sovereign nuclear program.

In November 2009, the IAEA Board of Governors passed a resolution that criticized Iran for defying a UN Security Council ban on uranium enrichment, censured Iran for secretly building a uranium enrichment facility and demanded that it immediately suspend further construction. It noted the IAEA chief Mohammed El-Baradei cannot confirm that Iran&#x27;s nuclear program is exclusively geared toward peaceful uses, and expressed &quot;serious concern&quot; that Iran&#x27;s stonewalling of an IAEA probe means &quot;the possibility of military dimensions to Iran&#x27;s nuclear program&quot; cannot be excluded.

===Cooperation with Venezuela, 2009===
In October 2009 Hugo Chávez announced that Iran was helping Venezuela in uranium exploration. He said that &quot;We&#x27;re working with several countries, with Iran, with Russia. We&#x27;re responsible for what we&#x27;re doing, we&#x27;re in control&quot;. A number of reports suggested that Venezuela was helping Iran to obtain uranium and evade international sanctions.

===Enrichment, 2010===
On 9 February 2010 the Iranian government announced that it would produce uranium enriched to up to 20 percent to produce fuel for a research reactor used to produce medical radioisotopes, processing its existing stocks of 3.5 percent enriched uranium. Two days later during the celebrations in Tehran for the 31st anniversary of the 1979 revolution, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced that Iran was now a &quot;nuclear state.&quot; IAEA officials confirmed it has enriched uranium &quot;up to 19.8%&quot;.
Responding to criticism, Ahmadinejad said, &quot;Why do they think that 20 per cent is such a big deal? Right now in Natanz we have the capability to enrich at over 20 per cent and at over 80 per cent, but because we don&#x27;t need it, we won&#x27;t do it.&quot; He added &quot;If we wanted to manufacture a bomb, we would announce it.&quot; On the same day as Ahmadinejad&#x27;s announcement, Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, told Reuters that their 20 percent enrichment production, was going &quot;very well,&quot; adding &quot;There is no limit on enrichment. We can enrich up to 100% ... But we never had the intention and we do not have the intention to do so, unless we need (to).&quot; He maintained that the 20 percent production was for a Tehran medical reactor, and as such would be limited to around 1.5 kg per month.

Iran has reportedly breached its nuclear pact with world powers by surging its enriched uranium stock and further refining its purity beyond allowed standards, the UN atomic agency, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said.

Diplomats closely monitoring the work of International Atomic Energy Agency&#x27;s (IAEA) in Iran have said that investigators found traces of uranium at a secret atomic facility based in Tehran.

===Tehran Nuclear Declaration, 2010===

US President Obama reportedly sent a letter dated 20 April 2010 to President Lula of Brazil, in which he outlined a proposed fuel swap. While expressing skepticism that the Iranians would now be willing to accept such a deal, having provided &quot;no credible explanation&quot; for the previous deal&#x27;s rejection, President Obama wrote &quot;For us, Iran’s agreement to transfer 1,200 kg of Iran’s low enriched uranium (LEU) out of the country would build confidence and reduce regional tensions by substantially reducing Iran’s LEU stockpile.&quot; Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan received a similar letter. A senior US official told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that the letter was a response to Iran&#x27;s desire to ship out its uranium piecemeal, rather than in a single batch, and that during &quot;multiple conversations&quot; US officials made clear that Iran should also cease 20 percent enrichment; however, the official stated &quot;there was no president-to-president letter laying out those broader concerns&quot;.

On 17 May 2010 Iran, Brazil, and Turkey issued a joint declaration &quot;in which Iran agreed to send low-enriched uranium to Turkey in return for enriched fuel for a research reactor.&quot; The proposal was welcomed by Arab leaders and China. France&#x27;s Prime Minister called the agreement a &quot;positive step&quot; toward resolving the Iran nuclear program dispute, if Iran were to cease uranium enrichment altogether. EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton played down the agreement, saying it was a step in the right direction but did not go far enough and left questions unanswered. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the proposal had &quot;a number of deficiencies,&quot; including Iran&#x27;s intention to continue enriching uranium to high levels.

Meanwhile, the United States was also pursuing other action to address the situation in Iran, in the case that the more diplomatic method not produce a satisfactory deal, and on 18 May 2010, announced a &quot;draft accord&quot; among UN permanent Security Council members for additional sanctions on Iran, designed to pressure it to end its nuclear enrichment program. Turkey and Brazil criticized the sanctions proposal. Davutoglu said that the swap agreement showed Iran&#x27;s &quot;clear political will&quot; toward engagement on the nuclear issue. Brazil&#x27;s Foreign Minister also expressed frustration with the US stance, saying of Brazil&#x27;s vote against the sanctions resolution: &quot;We could not have voted in any different way except against.&quot;

Early analysis from the BBC stated the swap deal could have been an &quot;effort by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to deflect pressure for fresh sanctions&quot; and that &quot;Iran watchers are already criticising Washington for moving the goal posts&quot;. Iran also described the agreement as a major boost to trilateral relations with Brazil and Turkey, and Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Ali Khamenei criticized the continuing call for sanctions, stating that the &quot;domineering powers headed by America are unhappy with cooperation between independent countries.&quot;

Mohamed ElBaradei, former director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, wrote that &quot;the only way to resolve the Iranian issue is to build trust. Moving 1200, half, or at least more than half of the Iranian nuclear material out of Iran is a confidence-building measure would defuse the crisis and enable the US and the West [to gain] the space to negotiate. I hope that it would be perceived as a win-win situation. If we see what I have been observing in the last couple of days that it is an &quot;empty dressing&quot;, I think it is a wrong approach...we lost six years of failed policy frankly vis-à-vis Iran. And it&#x27;s about time now to understand that the Iranian issue is not going to be resolved except, until and unless we sit with the Iranians and try to find a fair and equitable solution.&quot; &quot;If this deal is followed up with a broader engagement of the IAEA and the international community, it can be a positive step to a negotiated settlement,&quot; UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon said.

===Possible espionage and assassinations===
Several Iranian nuclear scientists died in alleged assassination attacks between 2010 and 2012.

According to former Iranian chief of staff Hassan Firouzabadi, the West used tourists and environmentalists to spy on Iran: &quot;In their possessions were a variety of reptile desert species like lizards, chameleons… We found out that their skin attracts atomic waves and that they were nuclear spies who wanted to find out where inside the Islamic Republic of Iran we have uranium mines and where we are engaged in atomic activities.&quot;, however these plots were foiled by Iran.

===2013–2015===
==== September 2013 Ministerial meeting ====
Foreign Ministers of the P5+1 met in September 2013 on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly, and were joined by Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif.

==== October–November 2013 negotiations ====
Lead negotiators for the P5+1 and Iran met in Geneva 15–16 October to discuss elements of a possible framework for resolving questions about Iran&#x27;s nuclear program. Experts from the P5+1 and Iran met in Vienna 30–31 October to exchange detailed information on those elements. Lead negotiators met again 7–8 November to negotiate that framework, joined at the end by Foreign Ministers from the P5+1, but despite extending the talks past midnight 9 November were unable to agree on that framework and agreed instead to meet again 20 November.

On 24 November, the foreign ministers of Iran and the P5+1 agreed to a six-month interim deal that involves the freezing of key parts of the Iranian nuclear program in exchange for a decrease in sanctions, to provide time to negotiate a permanent agreement. Iran will stop enriching uranium beyond five percent, and will stop development of their Arak plant. The UN will be granted greater access for inspections. In exchange, Iran will receive relief from sanctions of approximately US$7 billion (£4.3 billion) and no additional sanctions will be imposed. President Obama called the agreement an &quot;important first step.&quot; Following further negotiation of implementation details, a summary of which was released by the White House on 16 January 2014, implementation began 20 January 2014.

==== Implementation ====
On 20 February 2014 the IAEA reported that Iran was implementing its commitments to the P5+1 and its commitments to the IAEA under the Joint Statement of 11 November 2013.

==== February–July 2014 negotiations ====
During February to July 2014, the P5+1 and Iran held high-level negotiations on a comprehensive agreement on Iran&#x27;s nuclear program in Vienna, Austria. After six rounds of talks the parties missed the deadline for reaching a deal and agreed to extend the negotiations through 24 November. Additionally, it was agreed that the US will unblock $2.8 billion in frozen Iranian funds, in exchange for Iran continuing to convert its stocks of 20 percent enriched uranium into fuel.

The EU Court of Justice annulled a freeze of the Iranian Sharif University&#x27;s assets since the EU could not provide sufficient evidence of the university&#x27;s links to the nuclear program of Iran.

===Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action===

An Iran nuclear deal framework was reached in April 2015. Under this framework Iran agreed tentatively to accept restrictions on its nuclear program, all of which would last for at least a decade and some longer, and to submit to an increased intensity of international inspections. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was finally reached on 14 July 2015. The final agreement is based upon &quot;the rules-based nonproliferation regime created by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and including especially the IAEA safeguards system&quot;.

=== 2016–present ===
In January 2016, it was announced that Iran had dismantled major parts of its nuclear program, paving the way for sanctions to be lifted.

In 2018 the Mossad reportedly stole nuclear secrets from a secure warehouse in the Turquzabad district of Tehran. According to reports, the agents came in a truck semitrailer at midnight, cut into dozens of safes with &quot;high intensity torches&quot;, and carted out &quot;50,000 pages and 163 compact discs of memos, videos and plans&quot; before leaving in time to make their escape when the guards came for the morning shift at 7 am. According to a US intelligence official, an &quot;enormous&quot; Iranian &quot;dragnet operation&quot; was unsuccessful in recovering the documents, which escaped through Azerbaijan.
According to the Israelis, the documents and files (which it shared with European countries and the United States), demonstrated that the Iranian AMAD Project aimed to develop nuclear weapons, that Iran had a nuclear program when it claimed to have &quot;largely suspended it&quot;, and that there were two nuclear sites in Iran that had been hidden from inspectors. Iran claims &quot;the whole thing was a hoax&quot;. This influenced Trump&#x27;s decision to withdraw the United States from the JCPOA and reimpose sanctions on Iran.

In February 2019, the IAEA certified that Iran was still abiding by the international Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) of 2015.

On 8 May 2019, Iran announced it would suspend implementation of some parts of the JCPOA, threatening further action in 60 days unless it received protection from US sanctions. In July 2019, the IAEA confirmed that Iran has breached both the 300 kg enriched uranium stockpile limit and the 3.67% refinement limit. On 5 November 2019, Iranian nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi announced that Iran will enrich uranium to 5% at the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, adding the country had the capability to enrich uranium to 20% if needed. Also in November, Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, stated that Iran can enrich up to 60% if needed.

President Hassan Rouhani declared that Iran&#x27;s nuclear program would be &quot;limitless&quot; while the country launches the third phase of quitting from the 2015 nuclear deal.

In January 2020, following the killing of Iranian Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani, Iran stated that it would no longer abide by the JCPOA&#x27;s restrictions on its enrichment program.

In March 2020, the IAEA said that Iran had nearly tripled its stockpile of enriched uranium since early November 2019.

In June 2020, following reports by IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi in March and June describing the IAEA&#x27;s efforts to resolve questions about the correctness and completeness of Iran&#x27;s declarations, the IAEA Board of Governors passed a resolution calling on Iran to cooperate fully in implementing its safeguards agreement and Additional Protocol and to grant access to two suspected former nuclear sites and address doubts regarding undeclared nuclear material. Iran denounced the resolution.

In late June and early July 2020, there were several explosions in Iran, including one that damaged the Natanz enrichment plant (see 2020 Iran explosions).

On 2 July 2020, the above-ground main advanced centrifuge assembly facility at Natanz was destroyed by physical sabotage by Israel&#x27;s Mossad. After the July explosion, Iran started moving three cascades, or clusters, of different advanced models of centrifuge to its below-ground Fuel Enrichment Plant (FEP).

In September 2020, the IAEA reported that Iran had accumulated ten times as much enriched uranium as permitted by the JCPOA.

In November 2020, the IAEA reported that Iran had started feeding uranium hexafluoride (UF6) into a newly installed underground cascade of 174 advanced IR-2m centrifuges at Natanz, which the JCPOA did not permit.

Iran&#x27;s top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, was assassinated in Tehran, Iran on 27 November 2020. Fakhrizadeh was believed to be the primary force behind Iran&#x27;s covert nuclear program for many decades. The New York Times reported that Israel&#x27;s Mossad was behind the attack and that Mick Mulroy, the former Deputy Defense Secretary for the Middle East said the death of Fakhirizadeh was &quot;a setback to Iran’s nuclear program and he was also a senior officer in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and that &quot;will magnify Iran’s desire to respond by force.&quot;

In January 2021, Iran told the IAEA that it would enrich uranium to 20%, as it had done before the JCPOA. In February 2021, Iran&#x27;s Foreign Ministry confirmed that the country has informed IAEA about its plans to reduce the commitments made to the agency, alongside limiting the IAEA&#x27;s access to Iran&#x27;s nuclear facilities. Later in February the IAEA confirmed that Iran had begun to produce uranium metal, in contravention of the JCPOA. Iranian leaders have claimed that &quot;the country’s nuclear program has always been intended solely for peaceful civilian purposes.&quot; The UK, France, and Germany said that Iran has &quot;no credible civilian use for uranium metal&quot; and called the news &quot;deeply concerning&quot; because of its &quot;potentially grave military implications&quot; (as the use of metallic enriched uranium is for bombs). In March 2021, Iran started enriching UF6 uranium at its underground Natanz plant with a second type of advanced centrifuge, the IR-4, in a further breach of the JCPOA.

On 10 April, Iran began injecting uranium hexafluoride gas into advanced IR-6 and IR-5 centrifuges at Natanz, but on the next day, an accident occurred in the electricity distribution network.

In May 2021, the IAEA reported that Iran produced 60% highly enriched uranium in limited amounts. Iran said this was in response to the Natanz incident. The head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, stated that &quot;only countries making bombs are reaching this level&quot;. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; reported in January 2022 that &quot;the so-called &#x27;breakout&#x27; time for Iran to produce enough fuel for a bomb has plummeted, from more than a year to as little as three weeks.&quot;

In March 2022, Iran defied Western powers by turning part of its enriched uranium to near-weapons-grade into a form that is more difficult to retrieve, dilute, and transport out of the country, according to a report released by the United Nations nuclear watchdog.

In March 2022, Iran and the IAEA agreed to a three-month plan that, in the best-case scenario, would handle the long-stalled issue of uranium particles discovered at old but undeclared locations in the nation, removing a roadblock to the Iran nuclear deal being resurrected.

In April 2022, Iran handed over documents linked to pending concerns to the IAEA as it requested for the agency&#x27;s inquiry into uranium particles discovered at three undeclared facilities to be closed.

On 14 April 2022, the IAEA said in a report seen by Reuters that Iran is starting to operate a new workshop at Natanz that would build parts for uranium-enriching centrifuges using machinery relocated from its now-closed Karaj plant.

On 29 April 2022, according to IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi, Iran&#x27;s new workshop at Natanz for fabricating centrifuge parts was set up underground, presumably to protect it from possible attacks. In May 2022, Grossi warned that Iran has been dragging its feet on information about uranium particles found at old undeclared locations in the country.

During a video posted on social media in May 2022, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett showed a stack of compromising documents stolen by Iran from the IAEA and later obtained by the Mossad during a 2018 raid in a warehouse in Tehran. The documents in Israel&#x27;s possession includes what appears to be a request by the then Iranian defense minister to come up with a cover story to hide evidence from the UN&#x27;s atomic agency in case of inspections.

In June 2022, Iran turned off two IAEA surveillance cameras that were installed at a nuclear facility as part of the 2015 nuclear deal. Shortly after, the IAEA board of governors rebuked Iran for failing to explain uranium traces found at three undeclared sites. The US, UK, Germany and France urged Iran to cooperate with IAEA. Later Iran decided to remove 27 surveillance cameras belonging to IAEA from several nuclear sites.

On 25 June 2022, in a meeting with the senior diplomat of the EU, Ali Shamkhani, Iran&#x27;s top security officer, declared that Iran would continue to advance its nuclear program until the West modifies its &quot;illegal behavior.&quot;

On 9 July 2022, according to an IAEA report seen by Reuters, Iran has increased its uranium enrichment through the use of sophisticated equipment at its underground Fordow plant in a configuration that can more quickly vary between enrichment levels.

In September 2022, Germany, United Kingdom and France expressed doubts over Iran&#x27;s sincerity in returning to the JCPOA after Tehran insisted that the IAEA close its probes into uranium traces at three undeclared Iranian sites. The IAEA said it could not guarantee the peaceful nature of Iran&#x27;s nuclear program, stating there had been &quot;no progress in resolving questions about the past presence of nuclear material at undeclared sites.&quot; United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres urged Iran to hold &quot;serious dialogue&quot; about nuclear inspections and said IAEA&#x27;s independence is &quot;essential&quot; in response to Iranian demands to end probes.

On 22 October 2022, the Iranian hacktivist group Black Reward leaked 50 gigabytes of internal emails, contracts, and construction plans related to Iran&#x27;s Bushehr power plant. The group stated that they released the documents after the government failed to respond to their demand of releasing the protestors arrested during the Mahsa Amini protests, whom Black Reward described as political prisoners. Iran&#x27;s civil nuclear arm acknowledged that hackers had breached their email system, which was being used by the Nuclear Power Production and Development Company who operates the country&#x27;s sole nuclear power plant in Bushehr.

In February 2023, the IAEA reported having found uranium in Iran enriched to 84%. The Iranian government has claimed that this is an &quot;unintended fluctuation&quot; in the enrichment levels, though the Iranians have been openly enriching uranium to 60% purity, a breach of the 2015 nuclear deal. In the same month, the U.S. Intelligence Community said in its annual threat report that &quot;since the assassination of Fakhrizadeh, Iran has accelerated the expansion of its nuclear program and undertaken research and development activities that would bring it closer to producing the fissile material for completing a nuclear device following a decision to do so.&quot;

On 27 August 2023, Iran&#x27;s nuclear chief, Mohammad Eslami, confirmed the continuation of uranium enrichment activities, based on parliamentary legislation. It followed reports of Iran slowing its 60% uranium enrichment, potentially easing tensions and reviving nuclear talks with the US.

As of 2023, the IAEA stated in an October quarterly report that Iran is estimated to have further increased its uranium stockpile twenty-two times over the 2015 agreed JCPOA limit. The IAEA also noted that Iran has continued to push back against inspections of its nuclear program and several inspectors had been barred by Iran, a move that received condemnation by the agency.

On 22 November 2024, Iran announced that it would make new advanced centrifuges after IAEA condemned Iranians&#x27; non-compliance and secrecy.

==Research and development in nuclear weapons==
The continuing controversy over Iran&#x27;s nuclear program revolves in part around allegations of nuclear studies by Iran with possible military applications until 2003, when, according to the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate, the program was ended. The allegations, which include claims that Iran had engaged in high-explosives testing, sought to manufacture green salt (), and design a nuclear-capable missile warhead, were based on information obtained from a laptop computer allegedly retrieved from Iran in 2004. The US presented some of the alleged contents of the laptop in 2005 to an audience of international diplomats, though the laptop and the full documents contained in it have yet to be given to the IAEA for independent verification. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;:

On 21 August 2007, Iran and the IAEA finalized an agreement, titled &quot;Understandings of The Islamic Republic of Iran and the IAEA on the Modalities of Resolution of the Outstanding Issues,&quot; that listed outstanding issues regarding Iran&#x27;s nuclear program and set out a timetable to resolve each issue in order. These unresolved issues included the status of Iran&#x27;s uranium mine at Gchine, allegations of experiments with plutonium and uranium metal, and the use of polonium-210. Specifically regarding the &quot;Alleged Studies&quot;, the Modalities agreement asserted that while Iran considers the documents to be fabricated, Iran would nevertheless address the allegations &quot;upon receiving all related documents&quot; as a goodwill gesture. The Modalities Agreement specifically said that aside from the issues identified in the document, there were &quot;no other remaining issues and ambiguities regarding Iran&#x27;s past nuclear program and activities.&quot;

The United States was opposed to the Modalities Agreement between Iran and the IAEA, and vehemently objected to it, accusing Iran of &quot;manipulating&quot; IAEA. Olli Heinonen, the IAEA Deputy Director General for safeguards, underlined the importance of the Iran-IAEA agreement as a working arrangement on how to resolve the outstanding issues that triggered Security Council resolutions:

Following the implementation of the Modalities Agreement, the IAEA issued another report on the status of Iran&#x27;s nuclear program on 22 February 2008. According to this report, the IAEA had no evidence of a current, undeclared nuclear program in Iran, and all of the remaining issues listed in the Modalities Agreement regarding past undeclared nuclear activities had been resolved, with the exception of the &quot;Alleged Studies&quot; issue. Regarding this report, IAEA director ElBaradei specifically stated:

The US had made some of the &quot;Alleged Studies&quot; documentation available to the IAEA just a week prior to the issuance of the IAEA&#x27;s February 2008 report on Iran&#x27;s nuclear program. According to the IAEA report itself, the IAEA had &quot;not detected the use of nuclear material in connection with the alleged studies, nor does it have credible information in this regard.&quot; Some diplomats reportedly dismissed the new allegations as being &quot;of doubtful value ... relatively insignificant and coming too late.&quot;

It was reported on 3 March 2008, that Olli Heinonen, the IAEA Deputy Director general of safeguards, had briefed diplomats about the contents of the &quot;Alleged Studies&quot; documents a week earlier. Reportedly, Heinonen added that the IAEA had obtained corroborating information from the intelligence agencies of several countries, that pointed to sophisticated research into some key technologies needed to build and deliver a nuclear bomb.

In April 2008, Iran reportedly agreed to address the sole outstanding issue of the &quot;Alleged Studies&quot; However, according to the subsequent May 2008 IAEA report, the IAEA was not able to actually provide these same &quot;Alleged Studies&quot; documents to Iran, because the IAEA did not have the documents itself or was not allowed to share them with Iran. For example, in paragraph 21, the IAEA report states: &quot;Although the Agency had been shown the documents that led it to these conclusions, it was not in possession of the documents and was therefore unfortunately unable to make them available to Iran.&quot; Also, in paragraph 16, the IAEA report states: &quot;The Agency received much of this information only in electronic form and was not authorised to provide copies to Iran.&quot; The IAEA has requested that it be allowed to share the documents with Iran. Nevertheless, according to the report, Iran may have more information on the alleged studies which &quot;remain a matter of serious concern&quot; but the IAEA itself had not detected evidence of actual design or manufacture by Iran of nuclear weapons or components.

Iran&#x27;s refusal to respond to the IAEA&#x27;s questions unless it is given access to the original documents has caused a standoff. In February 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the US refusal to provide access to those documents was a source of friction between the Bush Administration and then Director General ElBaradei. ElBaradei later noted that these documents could not be shared because of the need to protect sources and methods, but noted that this allowed Iran to question their authenticity. According to Iran&#x27;s envoy to the IAEA, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, &quot;The government of the United States has not handed over original documents to the agency since it does not in fact have any authenticated document and all it has are forged documents.&quot;

The IAEA has requested that third parties allow it to share the documents on the alleged studies with Iran. The IAEA has further stated that though it has not provided full documents containing the alleged studies, information from other countries has corroborated some of the allegations, which appear to the IAEA to be consistent and credible, and that Iran should therefore address the alleged studies even without obtaining the full documents. There have also been questions about the authenticity of the documents, and that investigations into the alleged studies are intended to reveal intelligence about Iran&#x27;s conventional weapons programs. Some IAEA officials have requested a clear statement be made by the agency that it could not affirm the documents&#x27; authenticity. They cite that as a key document in the study had since been proven to have been fraudulently altered, it put in doubt the entire collection.

On 30 April 2018, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed thousands of files he said were copied from a &quot;highly secret location&quot; in Tehran which show an Iranian effort to develop nuclear weapons between 1999 and 2003. Many analysts said there was little new information in Netanyahu&#x27;s presentation, which they speculated was designed to influence President Trump&#x27;s decision on the Iran deal. The IAEA reiterated its 2015 report, saying it had found no credible evidence of nuclear weapons activity in Iran after 2009. According to David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security, the archive revealed that Iran&#x27;s weapon program was more advanced than had been previously believed in the West and that should Iran pull out of the JCPOA it would be able to produce weapons swiftly, possibly within a few months.

On 26 October 2024, Israel launched three waves of strikes against twenty locations in Iran, Iraq and Syria. One site that was claimed to be destroyed was an active top secret nuclear weapons research facility in Parchin according to US officials.

In February 2025, based on intelligence collected during the last months of the Biden administration, the New York Times reported that a team of Iranian engineers and scientists has been exploring a faster method but cruder method for the production of nuclear weapons, if Iran&#x27;s leadership decided to race for a bomb. According to US officials, such a crude weapon could be built within months but could not be miniaturized to fit on a ballistic missile and would be less reliable than the more sophisticated designs Iran had considered in the past, which might take a year or more to build. The New York Times further reported that as of 2025, Iran had enough fuel to produce at least four nuclear bombs.

==Nuclear power as a political issue==
===Iran&#x27;s nuclear program and the NPT===

Iran says that its program is solely for peaceful purposes and consistent with the NPT. The IAEA Board of Governors has found Iran in non-compliance with its NPT safeguards agreement, concluding in a rare non-consensus decision with 12 abstentions, that Iran&#x27;s past safeguards &quot;breaches&quot; and &quot;failures&quot; constituted &quot;non-compliance&quot; with its Safeguards Agreement In the decision, the IAEA Board of Governors also concluded that the concerns raised fell within the competence of the UN Security Council.

Most experts recognize that non-compliance with an NPT safeguards agreement is not equivalent to a violation of the NPT or does not automatically constitute a violation of the NPT itself. The IAEA does not make determinations regarding compliance with the NPT, and the UN Security Council does not have a responsibility to adjudicate treaty violations. Dr. James Acton, an associate in the Nonproliferation Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, has said the 2010 NPT Review Conference could recognize that non-compliance with safeguards agreements would violate article III of the NPT. Director of the Australian Nonproliferation and Safeguards Organization and then Chairman of IAEA Standing Advisory Group on Safeguards Implementation John Carlson wrote in considering the case of Iran that &quot;formally IAEA Board of Governors (BOG) decisions concern compliance with safeguards agreements, rather than the NPT as such, but in practical terms non-compliance with a safeguards agreement constitutes non-compliance with the NPT.&quot;

A September 2009 Congressional Research Service paper said &quot;whether Iran has violated the NPT is unclear.&quot; A 2005 US State Department report on compliance with arms control and nonproliferation agreements concluded, based on its analysis of the facts and the relevant international laws, that Iran&#x27;s extensive failures to make required reports to the IAEA made &quot;clear that Iran has violated Article III of the NPT and its IAEA safeguards agreement.&quot; Testimony presented to the Foreign Select Committee of the British Parliament drew the opposite conclusion:

The 2005 US State Department compliance report also concluded that &quot;Iran is pursuing an effort to manufacture nuclear weapons, and has sought and received assistance in this effort in violation of Article II of the NPT&quot;. The November 2007 United States National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) asserted that Tehran halted a nuclear weapons program in fall 2003, but that Iran &quot;at a minimum is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapon&quot;. Russian analyst Alexei Arbatov, said &quot;no hard facts on violation of the NPT &quot;per se&quot; have been discovered&quot; and also wrote that &quot;all this is not enough to accuse Iran of a formal breach of the letter of the NPT&quot; and &quot;giving Iran the benefit of the doubt, there is no hard evidence of its full-steam development of a military nuclear program.&quot;

NPT Article IV recognizes the right of states to research, develop and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, but only in conformity with their nuclear nonproliferation obligations under Articles I and II of the NPT.

The UN Security Council has demanded that Iran suspend its nuclear enrichment activities in multiple resolutions. The United States has said the &quot;central bargain of the NPT is that if non-nuclear-weapon states renounce the pursuit of nuclear weapons, and comply fully with this commitment, they may gain assistance under Article IV of the Treaty to develop peaceful nuclear programs&quot;. The US has written that Paragraph 1 of Article IV makes clear that access to peaceful nuclear cooperation must be &quot;in conformity with Articles I and II of this Treaty&quot; and also by extension Article III of the NPT. Rahman Bonad, Director of Arms Control Studies at the Center for Strategic Research at Tehran, has argued that demands to cease enrichment run counter to &quot;all negotiations and discussions that led to the adoption of the NPT in the 1960s and the fundamental logic of striking a balance between the rights and obligations stipulated in the NPT.&quot; In February 2006 Iran&#x27;s foreign minister insisted that &quot;Iran rejects all forms of scientific and nuclear apartheid by any world power,&quot; and asserted that this &quot;scientific and nuclear apartheid&quot; was &quot;an immoral and discriminatory treatment of signatories to the Non-Proliferation Treaty,&quot; and that Iran has &quot;the right to a peaceful use of nuclear energy and we cannot accept nuclear apartheid.&quot;

Russia has said it believes Iran has a right to enrich uranium on its soil. Former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice suggested that there could be work toward an international nuclear fuel bank instead of indigenous Iranian enrichment, while Richard Haass, President of the Council on Foreign Relations, has said &quot;the United States should be willing to discuss what Iran describes as its &#x27;right to enrich&#x27; ... provided that Iran accepts both limits on its enrichment program (no HEU) and enhanced safeguards&quot;. Officials of the Iranian government and members of the Iranian public believe Iran should be developing its peaceful nuclear industry. A March 2008 poll of 30 nations found moderate support for allowing Iran to produce nuclear fuel for electricity alongside a full program of UN inspections.

===Iranian statements on nuclear deterrence===
The Iranian authorities deny seeking a nuclear weapons capacity for deterrence or retaliation since Iran&#x27;s level of technological progress cannot match that of existing nuclear weapons states, and the acquisition of nuclear weapons would only spark an arms race in the Middle East. According to Ambassador Javad Zarif:

Iran&#x27;s President Ahmadinejad, during an interview with NBC anchor Brian Williams in July 2008, also dismissed the utility of nuclear weapons as a source of security and stated:

According to Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran&#x27;s Atomic Energy Organization:

===Nuclear Weapon Free Zone in the Middle East===
Historically, until its own nuclear program began development, Iran had consistently supported the creation of a nuclear-weapons free zone in the Middle East. In 1974, as concerns in the region grew over Israel&#x27;s nuclear weapon program, Iran formally proposed the concept of a nuclear weapon free zone in the Middle East in a joint resolution in the UN General Assembly.

<text>The Federation of Baptist Associations of Costa Rica (Federación de Asociaciones Bautistas de Costa Rica) is a Baptist Christian denomination of churches in Costa Rica. It is affiliated with the Baptist World Alliance. 

==History==
In 1888, the &quot;Jamaica Baptist Missionary Society&quot; sent J. H. Sobey to labor in Costa Rica. Four Baptist churches formed the &quot;Baptist Convention of Costa Rica&quot; in 1947. This convention labored in cooperation with the International Mission Board until a dispute arose in 1980 and the relationship was severed. In 1981, those wishing to continue cooperation with the &quot;International Mission Board&quot; organized the National Union of Baptist Churches.

According to a census published by the association in 2023, it claimed 2,600 members and 27 churches.

<text>Die Prinzen (&quot;The Princes&quot;) is a German pop rock band, consisting of former members of the Thomanerchor, and a former member of the Dresdner Kreuzchor.

==Overview==
Early albums consist of a cappella music. The band&#x27;s first name was &quot;Die Herzbuben&quot;, but it was changed to &quot;Die Prinzen&quot; in 1991 to avoid confusion with the Volkstümliche Schlager duo &quot;Wildecker Herzbuben.&quot; The lyrics of their songs are often humorous, tongue-in-cheek critiques of German government or society. The group&#x27;s most popular singles have been &quot;Alles nur geklaut&quot;, &quot;Gabi und Klaus&quot;, &quot;Millionär&quot;, &quot;Küssen verboten&quot;, &quot;(Du musst ein) Schwein sein&quot;, &quot;Mein Fahrrad&quot;, &quot;Olli Kahn&quot; (about German World Cup goalkeeper Oliver Kahn) and &quot;Deutschland&quot;.

In reference to the group&#x27;s name and the Brothers Grimm fairy-tale &quot;The Frog Prince&quot;, the group&#x27;s logo is a green frog wearing a crown. The frog logo has appeared in a number of album and single covers.

Their hit song &quot;Millionär&quot; appeared in the accompanying video to the German textbooks &quot;Komm mit&quot;, &quot;Stationen&quot;, and &quot;Kontakte&quot;.

&quot;Deutschland&quot; is a very cultural and ironic song about everything in Germany. It was written by German songwriter Steve van Velvet.

<text>UKTV Bright Ideas was a digital television channel broadcast in the United Kingdom, which was part of the UKTV family of channels. The channel broadcast a variety of programmes, often originally aired on UKTV Style, UKTV Food and UKTV Gardens, and are thus mainly cookery, DIY and gardening. The channel broadcast from 6:00am-6:00pm every day, timesharing with Ftn.

==History==
On 3 October 2002, the channel was announced under the name of UK HomeStyle, as part of a preparation of networks on the Freeview service. Unlike the other free-to-air offering from UKTV - UK History, UK HomeStyle would be a highlights network that would showcase programming from UK Style and UK Food for the Freeview audience, offering them what is shown on their paid networks. On 12 December, it was announced that the channel would officially launch as UK Bright Ideas, due to trademark issues with the original name and its other planned name UK Homes.

The channel was launched on 15 January 2003. The channel was initially only shown on the Freeview digital terrestrial television platform, but later expanded to air on Sky Digital, NTL and Telewest.

Along with the rest of the UKTV network, the &quot;UK&quot; prefix was changed to &quot;UKTV&quot; on 8 March 2004 and it became &quot;UKTV Bright Ideas&quot;.

===Closure===
On 8 August 2007, it was announced that UKTV would replace UKTV Bright Ideas with a relaunched version of UKTV G2 on the Freeview platform. This was finalised in September 2007, when they officially announced that UKTV G2 would be rebranded as Dave and launch on Freeview, replacing UKTV Bright Ideas. Another reason for its closure was because the channel only averaged 0.1% of the audience share.

UKTV Bright Ideas ceased broadcasting on all platforms on 14 October 2007 at 6pm. The last programme on the channel was an episode of &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;, followed by a promotion of Dave. The following day, the bandwidth space that UKTV Bright Ideas used with Virgin1 (the ex-Ftn) would become home to UKTV History, downgrading its hours on the platform, while Dave launched in UKTV History&#x27;s bandwidth.
